Does any one know any way to set up auto-answer for google video calls on an Ubuntu machine? I don't care which client is used (Empathy, Pidgin, in-browser, anything else, etc.), and I don't care how hacky it is (as long as it doesn't take more than a couple of hours to set up).\nFor concreteness, by auto-answer I mean that all incoming video calls are automatically answered, with a two-way voice and video connection.\nThanks!\n\nA: So this does not answer the question exactly as written, but being the OP, I know that it's close enough. The trick I was was to use google hangouts instead of google video calls as follows:\nCreate a circle which includes those people you want to allow to call the machine. Start a hangout for this circle on the machine you wanted auto-answer on. Now everyone in the circle will be able to start video communication with this computer.\n", "Q: How to install Riak on Ubuntu 12.10? Has anyone been able to install riak from the basho package?

You can verify it by going to http://apt.basho.com/dists, as you can see that the directory for quantal is not present.\n\nSo, the best option before you is to install Riak from Source. Follow the instructions mentioned on their Official Website.\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Riak from Source\nI am summarizing the installation instructions for you here. Open your Terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T). Then follow as below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dependencies for Riak:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libc6-dev-i386 git\n\n\n*Install Erlang from Source:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the necessary development libraries:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev openssl libssl-dev\n\n\n*Download and build Erlang:\nwget http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_R15B01.tar.gz\ntar zxvf otp_src_R15B01.tar.gz\ncd otp_src_R15B01\n./configure && make && sudo make install\n\n\n\n*Download and install Riak:\nwget http://downloads.basho.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/riak/1.3/1.3.0/riak-1.3.0.tar.gz\ntar zxvf riak-1.3.0.tar.gz\ncd riak-1.3.0\nmake rel\n\n\n*If the build was successful, a fresh build of Riak will exist in the rel/riak directory.\n\nA: Aditya's answer is good, but if you really want a package you can build your own .deb and install it using dpkg. Start by following Aditya's instructions for getting dependencies (e.g. erlang). Then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clone the riak source code\ngit clone git://github.com/basho/riak.git\n\n\n*Build\ncd riak\nmake package RELEASE=1\n\n\n*Install\nsudo dpkg -i package/packages/riak_1.3.0rc2-f87560a7-1_i386.deb\n\nThe name of your .deb file will probably be different than mine.\n", "Q: What is skew value in Mongo DB Database replication?

Thanks in advance!!\n\nA: The \"skew\" column represents how skewed each host perceives the others' system clocks to be relative to its own.\nIf you're running a version 2.0 or later of MongoDB, these numbers are just for your information and not something to worry about — the servers are aware of the skew and will compensate for it.  (See https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-3132 for gory details.)\n", "Q: How to find an application's command, graphically or otherwise? I often find that I need to figure out the command to execute a certain application, such as an Alarm Clock application or the System Monitor. However, many of the actual CLI commands to run these are not directly evident. What I usually do is just go to the Ubuntu Software Center, then search for the application's \"common name\" and hence find its package/command name. I would like to know if there is an easier or more efficient way of doing this. \nI was wondering if there is a command similar to xprop, where clicking on an open (graphical) application would output its command in the terminal. In other words, I am interested in a graphical way of finding an application's command.\nFor example, if I run such a command and click on System Monitor, the terminal would output gnome-system-monitor, etc. Thanks.\nPS. If a solution is not currently available, I would be interested in writing my own script with this functionality. I only know basic bash, however. I realize that should probably go under a separate question, but I'm just throwing it out there.\n\nA: I know you prefer a graphical route but here's my effort as a learner of CLI stuff ...\nTo list names with commands:  \ngrep '^Name=' /usr/share/applications/*.desktop > ~/Desktop/mgtl1.txt && grep -h '^Exec=' /usr/share/applications/*.desktop > ~/Desktop/mgtl2.txt && paste -d':' ~/Desktop/mgtl1.txt ~/Desktop/mgtl2.txt > ~/Desktop/mgtl3.txt && perl -p -i -e 's/\\/usr\\/share\\/applications\\///'g ~/Desktop/mgtl3.txt && perl -p -i.bak -e 's/\\n/\\n\\n/'g mgtl3.txt && perl -p -i.bak -e 's/:/\\n/'g mgtl3.txt  \n\nwill create four files on the desktop and mgtl3.txt will look like this in part:  \napport-gtk-mime.desktop  \nName=Report a problem...  \nExec=/usr/share/apport/apport-gtk -c %f\n\naudacity.desktop  \nName=Audacity  \nExec=audacity %F\n\nblueman-manager.desktop  \nName=Bluetooth Manager  \nExec=blueman-manager\n\nTo find the command for any software\nLaunch the software. Then, run  \nCOLUMNS=150 ps -ef > ~/Desktop/out.txt  \n\nExamine the last few lines of out.txt for the relevant command.\n\nA: using UNITY\nDash -> Search for Terminal\nDash -> More Apps -> 'See More Results'\nDash -> More Apps -> Accessories \nusing Terminal\nKeyboard Shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + T \nread this http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix1.html\n\nA: I wrote this (rather ugly) script to find the command to execute a running application  by clicking on it. It uses xprop to get the \"clicking interface\" and to get information about the selected window:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nxprop > ./tmp\n\nchk_desk=`grep -c \"_NET_WM_DESKTOP_FILE(STRING)\" ./tmp` #Checks whether application has a corresponding .desktop file. The '-c' counts the number of matches.\n\nif [ $chk_desk -ne 0 ] ; then\n    desk_line=`grep \"_NET_WM_DESKTOP_FILE(STRING)\" ./tmp` #Extract line containing .desktop path \n    desk_path=${desk_line/\"_NET_WM_DESKTOP_FILE(STRING) = \"/} #Extract only the .desktop path\n    desk_path=${desk_path//\\\"/} #Removes quotes\n    exe_line=`grep \"Exec=\" $desk_path | head -n1`\n    exe=${exe_line/\"Exec=\"/}\nelse #If .desktop doesn't exist, it uses the PID to find the executable\n    pid_line=`grep \"_NET_WM_PID(CARDINAL)\" ./tmp` \n    pid=${pid_line/\"_NET_WM_PID(CARDINAL) = \"/}\n    exe_path=`readlink -f /proc/$pid/exe`\n    exe=${exe_path/\\/usr\\/bin\\//}\nfi\n\necho $exe\n\nrm ./tmp\n\nexit 0\n\nIn case you are wondering, I could not have used only the PID for matching since /proc/$pid/exe gives you the path of the \"real\" executable, or of the underlying service running the program. So if you used it on say 'geogebra', the script would output java instead. Or in the case of Firefox you would get the path /usr/lib/firefox/firefox, which I suppose is where the actual firefox executable exists, which means the /usr/bin/firefox points to it.\nWhile firefox is not a big problem (you could use the \"real\" executable), for the java based applications the .desktop file is needed to get the command to run the actual application and not a blank java session. \nThis script, of course, will only work if you are using X as your display server (since it uses xprop). I'm sure there must be a way to make the script cleaner, though my main problem was having to create many variables to hold the grep line outputs and the multiple substitutions.\n", "Q: How do I minimize all windows in Ubuntu 12.10? Does anyone know the good working way to minimize all windows in Ubuntu 12.10 ? I saw a few articles and didn't find any valuable. For example, \n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + Super + D doesn't work.\n\n*System ➜ Preferences ➜ Keyboard Shortcuts - doesn't exist in Ubuntu\n12.10.\n\n*CompizConfig Manager doesn't work properly, it sometimes doesn't\nminimize all windows for some reason. Besides, it's not recommended to use it (it was said here on AskUbuntu)\n\n\nA: Maybe you can try MyUnity.

I have it installed, multiverse reps are done too, it's all there. \nIf I remove --enable-libfdk-aac from ffmpeg ./configure, then it complaints about libx264. \nI installed libx264-dev and it works but eventually comes with failed error mentioning x264:\nlibavcodec/libx264.c:552: error: undefined reference to 'x264_encoder_open_130' collect2: ld returned 1 exit status make: *** [ffmpeg_g] Error 1 \n\n\nA: We solved the problems after various discussions in the comments where I linked to my detailed guide, which also references the official ffmpeg guide.\nAndrej's system was Ubuntu 12.04 server.\nIt is only possible to list some general points below, as there was no one single issue that was the problem in the failed compilation attempts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly, it is necessary to remove any existing packages  with \nsudo apt-get remove ffmpeg x264 libav-tools libvpx-dev libx264-dev\n\nso that possible conflicts are avoided when trying to compile ffmpeg and its libraries later.\n\n*In the official ffmpeg guide  the dependencies are slightly different for desktop and server, and there are also several notes throughout the guide that should be followed if installing on a server. The sets of build dependencies for desktop and server are listed in the official guide.\n\n*One thing Andrej mentioned was that he had got dependencies such as libx264-dev, but actually that is one of the things that should be removed (as in the first command above). If you want x264 support or aac support, etc, you must compile x264, fdk-aac, libvpx and opus before you build ffmpeg. Compiling ffmpeg should be the last thing done; you should not download the build dependencies and then begin compiling ffmpeg as you need to compile several libraries yourself if you want the various support for certain audio/video types.\n\n*If it is proving problematic to compile certain libraries or build ffmpeg with support for them, you should be able to edit the ffmpeg ./configure line in the guide; e.g. to remove an --enable-libxxx line. Conversely, for opus support, you need to add --enable-libopus. I was about to suggest further tweaking the ./configure line, when Andrej solved his problem, but it is useful to remember this for future builds if problems occur.\n\n*For more details on compiling ffmpeg and possible problems that can arise, see my detailed answer for this question.\n", "Q: How to solve the access permission problem for any folders in ubuntu?

Here's my problem.\nI was running Ubuntu 10.04, and I got Mullvad , a VPN service because it is anonymous and cheap.\nMullvad VPN service installed perfectly on 10.04 and I used it for a couple of months without any issues.\nIn January I installed Ubuntu 12.04 via upgrade from 10.04, leaving Mullvad installed. Everything still worked properly.\nRecently, however, with no changes to the software (as far as I know other than Ubuntu updates) Mullvad isn't working correctly. It says it's connected, but without the green checkmark indicating this which was previously displayed in 12.04 and 10.04.\nI could browse the Internet until about two days ago.\nMy subscription expired, and I started up Mullvad (but without the option to block connections on failure, because I was not a subscriber). I still left Mullvad installed, however. Later I restarted my computer, and this time did not start Mullvad/VPN at all. I could no longer access domain names, except for by typing in IP addresses of sites. I searched via startpage, and I found a couple articles. Apparently, I was supposed to move /etc/resolv.conf. \nEDIT: I followed the post here and did this: \nsudo mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/backup.resolv.conf\nI did this and now cannot access DNS.\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: Mullvad has futzed with /etc/resolv.conf. If I understand correctly you are no longer using Mullvad. Disable and/or de-install Mullvad. Then, to restore resolv.conf,\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\nand reboot.\nBackground: The Mullvad component /usr/share/mullvad/dnsconfig.py moves /etc/resolv.conf away to /etc/resolv.conf.pre-mullvad and writes a new /etc/resolv.conf. This presumably happens just after the VPN connection is established. To clean up, it moves /etc/resolv.conf.pre-mullvad back to /etc/resolv.conf. The problem with this is that in Ubuntu 12.04, /etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link which should never be touched; programs like Mullvad should interface with resolvconf to update the resolv.conf file. If the machine is ever rebooted without Mullvad being stopped cleanly then the symbolic link is gone and /etc/resolv.conf is an obsolete file. Bad. To repair the damage (as I already said) run sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf and reboot. To avoid recurrence, either don't run Mullvad, or contact the Mullvad developers and ask them to make Mullvad interface with resolvconf, or edit /usr/share/mullvad/dnsconfig.py yourself to do that.\n", "Q: How can clients authenticate to a proxy without user intervention? I would like to set up a number of computers that need to go through a proxy server to get to the outside world.  The OS is Ubuntu 12.04 but the issue seems common to all versions (are far as I can tell).\nEvery post I read says to put user:password@proxy:port in the apt.conf file, and yes that works, but it's not really a option.  The computers are being used by non technical people with a 3 month password change policy.  \nAsking them to store their password in plain text, or encrypt their password and put it in a text file is just not going to happen.\nI can get the computers authenticating to an AD domain and Firefox will happily pass the credentials along, but I can't get the Update or Software Centre to do the same thing.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: Change your point of view.\nDon't configure the authentication task on the clients, do it on the server side.\nThe approach is either to set up an restricted web proxy with either no or an \"static\" password. This web proxy should use a white-listing that allow access to well-known package repositories, but inhibits the use of custom web sites. This way the approach should not interfere with the web access policies for the users in your organization.\nAs an alternative to a traditional web proxy like squid you may have also a look at something like apt-cacher.\n", "Q: How to make a directory permanently writable? I am using LAMP stack for development and I have a problem with making /var/www permanently writable. I use this command:\nsudo chmod -R a+rwX /var/www\n\nThis works, but after putting a web app and accessing it through a browser, it show a \"permission denied\" error.

So doesn't matter what user or group owned it or used Lampp. \nHowever, that isn't recommended if your computer is public access. \n\nA: Usually the command you used should change the permissions permanently.\nTry sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/ (which basically is the same). If that doesn't work you might need to change the owner [and maybe the group] of the directory via sudo chown <user>[:<group>] /var/www/.\nAlso, you might consider the 'permission denied error' could be caused by insufficient access rights in your database or elsewhere.\n", "Q: Wifi connected but no internet i hope someone can help me with this, it was the story of today for me:\nEverything was going ok and my internet worked perfectly for every device I had (computer, tablet, phone) except for my two Nexus 4.

The CPU usage went down significantly (20% on highest cpu thread). Yet I still get the:\n\nYour system is too SLOW to play this!\n\nmessage from MPlayer.\n\n*Playing with -lavdopts skiploopfilter=all made the video play properly. The CPU hovers at around 93% and A-V sync hovers around 0.263s\n\nQuestion\nSo my question is this - would you say it's reasonable for mplayer to have this much trouble playing back that video on my hardware, or do you figure that there is a software problem here? Maybe the nvidia driver?\nAny ideas would be appreciated!\n\nA: TLDR? Ensure your CPU frequency governor is not being altered by some daemon or event-triggered script (e.g. a power management script).\nHistory (boring)\nI have had this problem on two different Ubuntu systems, especially when playing back h264/x264 videos.  Video playback slows down, while audio continues as normal.  Sometimes it catches up by itself, but sometimes it takes over 30 seconds before that happens!\nUsing a realtime chart of CPU usage, I noticed that CPU usage gets much larger when the problem occurs (at least as a proportion of the current frequency, which I am unfortunately not tracking).\nOne temporary fix is to interact with MPlayer, causing it to catch up fairly quickly, by using one of the following methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change playback speed by pressing [ then ]\n\n*Switch in/out of fullscreen by pressing F twice\n\n*Rewind and forward-wind by pressing Left then Right\n\n\nBut curiously when I wrote a script to send those keys automatically, the workaround did not catch up as expected!  It appears actual physical interaction with the keyboard was required...\nThe cause: powersave governor!\nFinally, I have found the problem was to do with CPU governor.  It seems the script /etc/pm/power.d/cpu_frequency (on my Ubuntu 12.04) is intermittently setting the frequency governor to powersave, even though I remain plugged in to AC power.  (This may be due to a software bug, or hardware, e.g. a dodgy power cable.)\nShortly afterwards (sometimes seconds, sometimes minutes) the script sets the governor back to ondemand, so it might not be easy to detect this happening!  (I detected it by adding some logging into the script: echo \"[$(date)] $0 was run with args $*\" >> /tmp/cpu_frequency.log)\nTemporary workaround (good for testing)\nInitially I worked around the problem by running this little script in a terminal while watching a video:\nwhile true; do cpufreq-set -c 0 -g performance ; cpufreq-set -c 1 -g performance ; sleep 2; done  \n\nThis script requires that you have the package cpufrequtils installed: sudo apt-get install cpufrequtils.\nIt simply ensures that the CPU will run at full speed at all times, enforced every 2 seconds.  (Very occasionally I might see A/V lose sync for a moment, but then it catches up.)\nAs you can see, that script was written for two cores.  But I have adapted this script to work for any number of cores:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile [[ 1 ]]\ndo\n  for CPUFREQ in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\n  do\n    [ -f $CPUFREQ ] || continue\n    echo -n performance > $CPUFREQ\n  done\n  sleep 2\ndone\n\nThis does exactly the same thing, and doesn't require the cpufrequtils package, but it's not a one-liner.\nPermanent solution\nRather than using one of those scripts above, we can instead make the solution more permanent, by disabling the script that is causing trouble.\nOne way to do that is to remove the troublesome script:\nsudo rm  /etc/pm/power.d/cpu_frequency\n\nBut a less destructive way would be to edit the script.  Simply add two lines somewhere near the top of the file:\n# <date_here> Disabled by <your_name> to assist mplayer A/V sync\nexit 0\n\nBut beware, this permanent solution will mean that the script won't switch to powersave when you really are unplugged from AC power, so your battery may not last as long as usual!\n(Although on my system, an Asus X453M, it didn't actually switch to powersave permanently until the battery charge had dropped really low anyway.)\nI hope this helps you.  This problem was very frustrating for me!\n\nA: I'm not sure if you're still in need of assistance, but I'll post for future users... I believe the problem that you're having is that mplayer's default configuration only uses one processor core...

I tried for many days to install my Huawei Dongle E153 on to my computer with OS Ubuntu. But I had no success. Can anyone help me to do it. \nI'm a total Ubuntu novice.\n\nA: If you are using the cd, it doesn't need it. You can just plug it in and go to your network connections and enable it. \n", "Q: Can I boot Ubuntu from a DVD? I don't want to erase my Windows 7 but I want to use Ubuntu. Is there an easy way to make a boot-able Ubuntu dvd? I really want to try out Ubuntu on my Windows 7 and having Ubuntu everywhere i go.\n\nA: Yes, you can create Ubuntu CDs and DVDs. You can download the .iso files here.\nYou can also create bootable USB sticks - see here for a tutorial on how to do that with Windows and here for one on how to do it with Ubuntu.\nYou can use any CD or bootable stick for live system testing. On USB sticks you can even even create an area to store changed settings and additionally installed software.\nBut don't forget that using a live system will always be significantly slower than an installed version of the operating system.\nIf you want to install it alongside Windows, see here for information on dual boot.\n\nA: yes. you can download ISO and burn it dvd. Boot using the dvd. But as the dvd is  readonly, you won't able to save your changes. like downloaded software will get deleted once you reboot. \nI suggest using a usb with persistance mode so that you can save your changes. \nMany program can confugure your usb  for that. One of them is Linux live Usb creater (LILI)\nalso remember using a os from USB will seriously reduce life span  of the usb\nAt last i will say, you can install ubuntu without deleting windows 7. There are in many tutorial on web. If you need help on that just create a new question.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 failing to install on Alienware M17x I would describe myself as quite familiar with Linux and Linux installations and I use Ubuntu every day at work, however I have been completely unable to install 12.10 on my new alienware laptop at home.\nI boot from a 12.10 ISO and I can get to the installer, however no matter which options I select (try Ubuntu or install) the installation process starts and eventually I get a black screen and the computer just hangs there indefinitely. \nI have tried standard 'legacy boot' and UEFI booting, following the respective forum guides for each. I have also tried installing using 'nomodeset' and on one occasion 'acpi=off' without success. \nThe furthest the installation has gotten is simply to the Ubuntu splash screen with the little boxes underneath. No further than this, and certainly not to the point where I can select any other options.\nThe laptop specs are:\nAlienware M17x: Standard base\nProcessor i7-3740QM (6MB Cache, up to 3.7Ghz w/ Turbo Boost 2.0) (this is disabled in the BIOS currently)\nDisplay is WideFHJD (1920x1080) WLED LCD\nMemory - 12288 1600 MHz Dual Channel DDR3\nGraphics: 2GB GDDR5 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680M\n\nI'm installing onto a fresh SSD with no previous grub / Linux installations. All it has on it currently is a fresh install of Windows 7 ultimate, which I haven't even logged into yet.\nThere is no BIOS option to specifically disable optimus if that could be causing the issue. \nI would be very grateful for any insight into how I could resolve this. I specifically wish to have a dual boot installation rather than running Ubuntu in a virtualized environment from within Windows. \n\nA: I have encountered a similar issue when installing Ubuntu 12.10 alongside UEFI-enabled Windows 8.\nIn my case, after disabling the UEFI booting and enabling the legacy boot, I created a Ubuntu live USB stick. Then after booting with the USB and installing the Boot-Repair with the command\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update  && sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (sudo boot-repair &)\n\nI have successfully managed to make both of the OSs bootable.\n\nA: I was getting the same thing and tried many many suggestions but only one of them actually worked.  I have an Alienware M18X R2 laptop and the problem is the graphics driver.  It has an NVidia card along with integrated Intel HD graphics chipset.  When you get to the menu that has the \"Try Ubuntu...\" type in \nvga=normal nomodeset\n\nbefore the -- in the command line that appears below the menu.  I found this suggestion in another thread here.  You do not need to press F6 for Options and select nomodeset because you are doing it manually.  There were other options people suggested but they did nothing.  The key was the vga command, that was the fix.  It is already in focus and I use the left arrow to move the cursor back before the -- and type in the vga command above without the quote.  For me that works.  I finally can see the next screen which is a Ubuntu progress screen.  I use a CD to install so after that progress screen it does go black again for many seconds.  At first I thought it wasn't really fixed.  But be patient because if you have gotten to the progress screen after the menu it is working.  Eventually it goes into a \"Try\" type of Ubuntu.  From there you can select the desktop icon for installing Ubuntu.\nThis worked for me and hopefully others who have an Alienware laptop or similar problem with their laptop. \nHope that helps.\n-Steve\n", "Q: Update/Upgrade ubuntu I have ubuntu 10.10 maverik meerkat.

I've been looking at some example apps from the Ubuntu SDK and from the Touch Developer Preview source code, and I've noticed that some images used as assets in those apps have a suffix with an @ sign followed by a number. E.g. avatar@8.png\nWhat is the purpose of naming images like that?\n\nA: This is related to Resolution Independence in the Ubuntu SDK. Currently the documentation for this part is missing, but it should be added soon.\nTaking the avatar@8.png image file name as an example, the @8 suffix refers to the DPI in which the original image was created.\nThat information will be used in the resolution independence calculations that will happen when scaling the image. When referencing to the image in the code, you should use the name without the suffix, e.g. avatar.png\n", "Q: How can I find the package name of the program I want to install?

I have an Ubuntu Quantal MAAS server and some computing nodes. I'm trying to set up an OpenStack cloud by following the Ubuntu Cloud Infrastructure walkthrough. Everything looks okay...I can bootstrap juju, deploy the charms (maas nodes are booting precise), log into the dashboard, register images, and even boot vms, BUT networking is not working at all. I'm trying to use the FlatDHCPManager on nodes with two ethernet interfaces. I've verified separately that connectivity is not an issue (e.g., all the eth0s are on the same switch, all the eth1s are on a different switch, and if I just statically assign IP addresses on either network the nodes can communicate with each other). When I ssh into the nova-cloud-controller or nova-compute machine I can see that the bridge is never created and eth1 is not active. Also, nova-network is never installed on any machine.\nI've successfully gotten openstack up and running using devstack, so I know it will all run on my system, but I'd really like to get things working with juju.\nSo,\n\n\n*\n\n*should nova network be installed?\n\n*if openstack is installed correctly should I be able to connect to nova-cloud-controller and nova-compute and see the bridge set up? (and if so, does this happen before or after setting up relations)\n\n*and does anyone have any ideas on what I could try to fix the problem?\n\n\nA: I've had the same problem. Also the vnc packages is also never installed. It seems to me that the charms is not fully functioning, or i may be missing something...\nHowever i made it work by setting up the networking my self. \nCreated a bridge 'br100' and made sure the interface linked to the bridge was set for promiscuous mode. This has to be done on controller and all compute nodes. Then of course you have to update nova.conf with the right information and use the command nova-manage to  create the networks.\nThis blog post was crucial for me:\nhttp://www.mirantis.com/blog/openstack-networking-single-host-flatdhcpmanager/\n", "Q: Unity cropping external monitor: how do I fix it?

Right now I am using ' Precise 12.04`.  I have created many custom launchers for bash scripts, and never had any problem until yesterday.\nI have installed a software suite which has multiple executables. The main executable abaqus is  located in \\opt\\softwaresname and is a symbolic link to the executable abq610i in  /opt/softwaresname/executables/. \nThe main exe abaqus requires some command-line arguments. I use the argument cae, (i.e. abaqus cae) but with another command to render the graphics in a better mode, hence the final call is:\nXLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 abaqus cae\nI made an alias for this long  command in .bash_rc file as:\nalias abaquscae=\"XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 abaqus cae\"\nEverything worked perfectly fine, as the alias runs the software.  Being a lazy champ, I thought of creating a Cairo-dock launcher for this. So I entered abaquscae in the box \"command to launch on click\" and checked \"Run in a terminal\". However to my dismay, upon click the launcher it gave an error::\nThere was an error creating the child process for this terminal\nFailed to execute child process \"abaquscae\" (No such file or directory)\n\nConsequently I wrote a small bash script file \"abaquscae.sh\":\n#!/bin/sh\n\"XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 abaqus cae\"\n\nand saved in, made it executable and upon running it in bash shell I again got the similar error, i.e. :    \n./abaquscae.sh: 2: ./abaquscae.sh: XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 abaqus cae: not found \n\nNow I am totally lost, I have tried many tricks e.g.\n1- removing commas in the bash script,\n2- making it dos2unix,\n3- using full path to the executable\nbut this script is not running through bash terminal.\nPROBLEM:\nThe command (as well as its alias) are work fine in the bash terminal, however when they are run through some other channel (e.g. scripts/launchers) the terminal miserably fails to recognize them :( ..\nIf any expert has advice/information about how to solve this problem, please share. I will be very thankful.\n\nA: I think the script should be like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nXLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 /opt/softwaresname/abaqus cae\n\nYou can also create the launcher using the following command:\nbash -c 'XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 /opt/softwaresname/abaqus cae'\n\nSetting environment variables before the executable file name in a command line is a feature of CLI (Command Line Interface) shells. If you put VARIABLE=value /path/to/executable in a launcher, the program that reads the launcher (and effectively launch the executable) will try to find a file named \"VARIABLE=value\" and, of course, will fail.\nThat command launches bash, the default user shell in Ubuntu, and tell it to execute (the -c option) the string \"XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 /opt/softwaresname/abaqus cae\", so it will be interpreted like it is when you type that in the CLI. \n\nA: For me, I was using #!/bin/bash/ instead of #!/bin/bash (had an extra / at the end). The complaint was very similar but said, \"child process not a directory\".

How can I find out how many IP addresses have been assigned to the clients. How do I control/monitor the DHCP daemon service(stop/start/status)?\n\nA: To monitor Dhcp leases just type in terminal :\ngedit /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases \n\n\nA: All the answers above are partial. And to be honest there is no simple solution. 1) You can parse the dhcpd.leases database file and get information on active leases, but \n\n\n*\n\n*you will not get information on any FIXED addresses (assigned by a line like:\nhost switch1      { hardware ethernet a1:b2:c3:d7:2f:bc ; fixed-address switch1.mydomain.com; }\n\n\n*and this also is not really giving any information on when was the last time a dhcp ack was sent to the machine.\n2) on the other hand you can parse the dhcpd.log file to search for ack lines (they look like this):\n2017-03-12T08:44:52.421174+01:00, Linuxx, info, dhcpd: DHCPACK on 10.0.0.63 to 68:ab:35:59:9c:a1 via 10.0.0.1\n\nWhich is giving you information on DHCPD requests and replies but there is no information about actual leases (time, status). \nWhat you should really do is to do BOTH. First parse the log file, and then update the file with information obtained from dhcpd.leases file with database for missing information like lease start-end etc.\nNow: I have played circa 2 full workdays till I have created a solution which creates a HTML table with ALL active leases, both FIXED and dynamic.

This is by design (what I personally needed to see each mac address which was present in my network during last days) - you can easily modify it, there is a ready section for this in code, just add one condition.\nHope you like it.\n\nA: The script used to control the DHCP daemon depends on which one you're using. I'm assuming isc-dhcp-server. Then it would be:\nservice isc-dhcp-server stop\nservice isc-dhcp-server start\nservice isc-dhcp-server status\n\nIf that doesn't work, look in /etc/init for a config file named after dhcp, and use that. Say your config file is called dhcpd3.conf, then you'd replace isc-dhcp-server in the above commands with dhcpd3.\nTo see \"how many ip addresses have been assigned to clients\", which was your original request, you can do this:\ngrep \"^lease\" /var/lib/isc-dhcp-server/dhcpd.leases |sort |uniq |wc -l\n\nThis will plainly give you the number of assigned addresses.\nAgain, if you get an error about /var/lib/isc-dhcp-server not being findable, look in /var/lib and replace it with something suggestind a dhcp server, usually dhcp or dhcp3\nNote that as mentioned in another answer, this will miss the distinction between assigned and active  (i.e. with a system using them at the moment) addresses. Also, if a client is forcefully shutdown and doesn't release the lease, you will also get unused addresses reported as assigned. \n\nA: To list all the active Clients IP's you can use nmap. It can list both DHCP as well as static clients.\nyou can install nmap in your PC with\nsudo apt-get install nmap\n\nThen to list all the active clients you can do like ,\n nmap -v -sP 192.168.0.0/255\n\nhere the IP's from 0 to 255 will be scanned and active IP's will be showup.\nThe better network monitor I can found my self is nethogs.\nyou can get it by installing with\nsudo apt-get install nethogs\n\nThen simply\nsudo nethogs <connection_name>\n\nCan show the traffic monitor in your terminal.\nhope this can help you.\n\nA: If you are using isc-dhcp-server on UBUNTU 14.04 headless server \nTo control the isc-dhcp-server\nservice isc-dhcp-server stop\nservice isc-dhcp-server start\nservice isc-dhcp-server status\n\nTo monitor the isc-dhcp-server\nThis method will work on a headless server (non-GUI) for \"assigned DHCP leases only\", login, enter the following command from the terminal \ncat /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases \nIf NMAP has been installed enter this command from the terminal\nnmap -v -sP 192.168.0.0/24 \nThis method will work on this subnet and scan 256 addressees, and output IP and MAC addresses. This will respond if the HOST is down with an IP Address that has no assignment and will respond with MAC and IP Address if the HOST is up. \nDepending on if a switch or router is between the PC and the network, and depending what \"network layer 2/3/4\" router or switch operates at.  \ntail -f /var/log/syslog will output DHCP addresses being actively assigned.\ntcpdump -i eth0 port 67 or port 68 -e -n will capture DHCP packets on port 67 and port 68 on network interface eth0\nIf DHCPDUMP has been installed enter this command from the terminal\ndhcpdump -i eth0 will DUMP \"as it implies\" DHCP information from the server to the client.\n", "Q: how to install KDE icon theme in ubuntu? (ROSA Icons) I recently got the great ROSA icon theme from the ROSA repo, I extracted the archive and put it into the .icons folder, under KDE I can select the icons no problem, but under unity using gnome tweak tool they can't be selected (nor in ubuntu tweak) so I assume that there needs to be further steps in order to use a KDE icon theme in the unity/gnome desktop?\nAny ideas?\nThanks\n\nA: Different Desktop Environments (Gnome, KDE, XFCE, LXDE, etc.) have different Icon Themes which cannot be used in another DE.

It shown forbidden errors.\nSo how to create partitions?\n\nA: I think English may not be your first language, so I am going to attempt to answer what I think is your question(s). I can only imagine what it would be like trying to ask a similar question in your language.\nFirst off, formatting a linux installation like a windows drive is not necessarily the right way to go. Windows formatted things that way because it, well is windows and like to do things, backwards and sometimes badly.\nThe three general configurations that linux systems are configured are:\nEverything in \"/\"\nEverything in is basically put in root except boot and swap. You actual disk will look something like...\n/boot\n/swap\n/\nEverything in \"/\" except \"home\"\nThis is the same as above, except you put the \"home\" directory off in a separate partition. Some people think that this makes it a bit easier to totally blow away your OS base install and not have to backup/recover or do anything with your \"home\" if you do. Which it does in a way, but there can be some other things that come up as well. You drive will look like...\n/boot\n/swap\n/\n/home\n\"/\", \"home\", \"/-other things\"\nIn some configurations, typically server installations, where for instance the log directory is going to take up a lot of space or potentially eat up the file system, the \"/var/log\" directory might be put on its on partition. These are all custom configurations... So your drive might look like...\n/boot\n/swap\n/\n/home (optionally if you chose this)\n/var/log\nDuring installation when you come to the disk partitioning scheme if you want to set up anything other than the default partitioning scheme, then you will need to choose the custom or manual option and set the disk up yourself. If you don't know how to do this, there are a lot of guides online that can walk you through it.\nIf you are worried about some issue later like having your linux disk layout mirror a windows disk layout to use some samba shared configuration that a windows machine is going to access, don't. In the configuration of that you can make the windows client see essentially what you want it to see.\n", "Q: Download to VMware I burned an ISO disk of ubuntu 12.10 to boot into VMware.

I seem to have reformatted my /home partition (previously ext4) as ext3 during an Ubuntu installation. It took me a couple of mounts to figure that out. Which, of course, is a bad thing. I've tried some of the usual data recovery tools - photorec gives me ~60000 files, but of course completely unsorted.\nI've stumbled across ext4magic, which is able to restore accidentally deleted files while preserving the directory structure, metadata etc. However, as the doc states:\n\nWas accidentally created a new file system on the old, and thus the file system meta data are completely overwritten, this option can not help because, then only a empty file system will be found.\n\nI'm now wondering if there is any way to extract the old metadata from the image so as to feed them to ext4magic separately. This, I guess, would require that the journal/superblocks of the new file system have been written to different blocks than they were before. Are those blocks the same on every format (which would defeat my endeavor), or are they somehow randomly assigned? Any chance that the change from ext4 to ext3 comes in handy here?\nOf course, other solutions are welcome as well.\n\nA: Save the journal data of a ext3/4 file system to a file:\ndebugfs -R \"dump <8> /PATH/journal.copy\" /dev/DEVICE \n\n(see Wiki ext4magic)\nThis copy can be used with ext4magic or extundelte. But these are not all the metadata. These are just some old inode. Also needed to restore the inode table and the directory data blocks. Without this it will not work, especially with ext3.\n(ext4 and ext4magic, possibly many files can restored but without original name and path.\nThis metadata could be stored with e2image, but at moment extundelete and ext4magic can not use such a additionally dump file.\n", "Q: Is Photoshop possible on Ubuntu Touch Is it possible to run a full version of Photoshop on Ubuntu Touch.  I'm thinking about switching my wife from a standard laptop to a tablet (Nexus 10), but she does a lot of photo editing and I don't want her to be stuck with the limited Photoshop touch version.  Has anyone managed to use the full version on a tablet yet?\n\nA: At this time Ubuntu Touch is only available as Developer Preview. \nMany things do not work yet as they will be on a finalized version. This might be earliest end of 2013 or beginning of 2014. \nTill that time it is just meant to give a preview for Developers. They can work on the first apps and on the core system itself to make it work well and to make it look beautifully. \nYou will have to wait or you will have to check for a device with a different operating system. \nAdditionally you should try it out before you buy - My personal opinion is, that the use of phontoshop or any other similar program will be completely different on a desktop pc with mouse or graphic tablet than on a tablet computer itself.

It will probably look somewhat like this:\n$ route\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         192.168.18.1    0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0\n192.168.18.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     1      0        0 eth0\n10.124.64.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     1      0        0 wlan0\n...\n\nNow you will want to replace the default gateway by a gateway on the 10.124.64/24 net. You can find out its IP by running route when eth0 is disabled or unplugged. Assuming it is the .1, you would then execute:\nroute del default\nroute add default gw 10.124.64.1\n\nIf you want to automate this, you could add these commands to an up statement in the appropriate stanza in /etc/network/interfaces (see man interfaces).\n\nDISCLAIMER: route is considered old fashioned and I ought to be doing this using the ip route command; the effect however is identical. Also, adding an up statement to /etc/network/interfaces may be perceived by some as pre-historic. I'll be happy to upgrade my knowledge. \n", "Q: How can I install ubuntu in VMware workstation in windows 8?

I want to change the keyboard layout both with Left Alt+Left Shift and Right Alt + Right Shift.

I use ubuntu 12.04.\nThanks!\n\nA: Ok, yet another try, this one will do the trick I hope... ;)\nCredits are due to reverendj1, who described a way of assigning a Custom key to toggle keyboard layout, using setxkbmap, which featured in the workaround alluded to in Edit 2 of my previous answer...\n\nHere is the slightly more involved way, but will give you more\n  flexibility for the key combination. First, copy and paste this script\n  I wrote and name it something like kb_toggle.sh. Make sure to edit\n  LANG1 and LANG2 to be the keyboard layout codes you need.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nLANG1=\"us\"\nLANG2=\"de\"\nCURRENT_LANG=$(setxkbmap -query | tail -n 1 | cut -f6 -d ' ')\nif [ \"$CURRENT_LANG\" = $LANG1 ]; then\n    setxkbmap $LANG2\nelse\n    setxkbmap $LANG1\nfi\n\nmake the file by right-clicking on it -> \"Properties\" -> \"Permissions\"\n  tab, then select \"Allow executing file as program.\nNow, open \"System Settings\" -> \"Keyboard\" -> \"Shortcuts\" tab and\n  select \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the + button on the bottom and name\n  the shortcut \"Keyboard Toggle\" or whatever you want, really. Then give\n  the full path to the script you made earlier in the command box. Hit\n  Apply. Click where it says \"Disabled\" then you can set the shortcut to\n  whatever you want by clicking your key combination!\n\nI think you'd need to change \"de\" to \"ir\".\nAgain, good luck!\n\nEdit\nYou may even get away with a one-liner, if you prefer:\n\nsetxkbmap us,ir -option \"grp:alt_shift_toggle\"\n\nNow you can switch by pressing alt+shift\n\nSee also http://wiki.lxde.org/en/Change_keyboard_layouts and http://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/man/man1/setxkbmap.1.xhtml\n\nEdit 2\nDepending on how you decide to achieve your goal, you may want to include lv3:ralt_alt in your command, resulting in\nsetxkbmap us,ir -option \"lv3:ralt_alt,grp:alt_shift_toggle\"\n\nSee man xkeyboard-config | grep lv3 for  details:\n\nlv3:ralt_alt\nRight Alt key never chooses 3rd level\n   xkeyboard-config  provides  the  description files for the X Keyboard Extension (XKB). The configuration options below are\n   usually applied with setxkbmap(1).\n\n\n\nA: The \"right Alt key\" is often (always ?) not the same as the \"left Alt key\", but corresponds to the AltGr, see for instance\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr_key\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_keyboard\nand as such has a different-and-distinct function.\nYou may want to try to try using xdotool to emulate certain key combination behaviour. Thus, you could set the\n\n\n*\n\n*Left Alt + Left Shift in the way described by Abdulkader in his answer, and\n\n*the second combination as Right AltGr + Right Shift) with xdotool.\n\n\n\nEdit\nFor a detailed example of how this can be done in general, with screenshots, plz refer to izx's excellent answer here. Regarding your questions specifically, you could try\n\nxdotool key --clearmodifiers alt+shift\n\nand then assigning this command to the Shift+Level3 Shift (don't type this, just press right_Shift + right_AltGr) shortcut in Custom Shortcuts. Again, plz refer to the relevant part of izx's answer.\nVoilá, you're sorted.\n\nNote that if you tried to do it \"the other way around\" like so\n\nxdotool key --clearmodifiers ISO_Level3_Shift+Shift\n\n(or alternatively, but less likely to work, Alt_R+Shift_R), noting that AltGr is \"equivalent to\" ISO_Level3_Shift,\nyou'd probaly get stuck, because \"Alt_R+Shift_R\" does not seem to be offered in the standard layout switching key dialog.\n\nFurther reading: from the xdotool man page:\n\nGenerally, any valid X Keysym string will work. Multiple keys are\n             separated by '+'. Aliases exist for \"alt\", \"ctrl\", \"shift\",\n             \"super\", and \"meta\" which all map to Foo_L, such as Alt_L and\n             Control_L, etc.\n\nalso Remapping the AltGr key to Control  with setxkbmap may be of interest to you...\n\nEdit 2\nSee https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xdotool/+bug/696247 and http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=13 ... and the workaround suggested therein (and confirmed to be working as of Nov 2012) of \"The workaround, for now, is to use setxkbmap to force your keymap in xmodmap (setxkbmap dvorak, etc)\". Thusly, plz refer to my 2nd, separate answer.\n\nA: You can use Alt-Shift for both languages\nSystem Settings... → Keyboard Layout → (click on \"+\" to Add new Language layouts) → \nOptions... → (click on) \"Key(s) to change layout\" → (tick) \"Left Alt+Left Shift\" → Close\n\n\n\nA: Simply add this command as a startup application:\nsetxkbmap -option lv3:ralt_alt,grp:alt_shift_toggle us,ir\n\nThis should enable both Alt-Shift toggles. However, you will lose the compositing functionality of the right Alt key (e.g.: you won't be able to draw a Euro sign (€) by hitting RightAlt+E).\nsetxkbmap's options, including language codes, are documented under /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst.\nYou could test the command out in a terminal first before adding it to your autostart applications.\nSource: http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=11038 (post #7)\n\nA: go to keyboard layouts from dash, and then click options, there's an option key(s) to change layout check alt+shift.

A short time ago I installed Ubuntu alongside Windows.\nA lot of things went wrong and I decided to reainstall Ubuntu on the partitions the old Ubuntu was using.\nFor this installation I created four different partitions: \\, \\home, \\boot and swap, I indicated the old ubuntu partition to be the new home partition (maybe I didn't chose to format it).\nNow when I turn on the PC, there are two ubuntus in the grub list, one which is functioning well (the latest) and one which is not functioning well (the earlier). I suppose the earlier ubuntu installation is still surviving in the \\home partition.\nIs it possible to format ONLY the home partition while keeping it structure (or format it and reinstall the structure without getting into new chaos)?\nSome images\nImage 1 - This is my partition list\n\nImage 2 - This is what I get when I click \"File system\"\n\nImage 3 - This is what I get when I click \"home\". It is different from my current home folder.\n\nImage 4 - Inside there is another! \"Home folder\" which contains the folder Imagination3, the name of my profile on the old installation. It is the home folder of the old installation.\n\nImage 5 - Returning to image 3, the Temitope folder is the home folder of the new installation, i.e. clicking on it bring me to my current home folder. Note that the new home folder is not equal to the partition \\home. I'm trying to say: clicking on my current home folder doesn't open the media \\home, but open \\home\\temitope.\n\n\nSo, what I need is to put an order in this home directory and partition issue, which I suppose implies eliminating the parasitic old installation, which should solve the grub entry issue.\n\nA: Run gksu nautilus to get a file browser window with root access, then open /home, and select everything except your home directory ( and any other home directories if you have more than one user ) and delete it.  Hold down shift when pressing delete so it doesn't go to the trash bin, and then close the window when done.\nYou can run sudo update-grub to update the boot menu without the removed system.\n", "Q: Why can't I move my License key to the correct folder? I just purchased Transition DJ for Ubuntu. It's installed but it won't launch. When I talked to the software developer, he said I need to add a file that has the license key in it to the Transitions DJ folder. \nI created the file, but when I tried to copy it into the Transitions DJ folder, I am told that I am not allowed because I am not the owner of the file, but I don't understand since the folder is on my own computer. \nWhy am I not allowed to copy a file into any folder I want?\n\nA: \nWhy am I not allowed to copy a file into any folder I want?\n\nShort answer: you are both a user and an administrator on your system. As a user you are not allowed to access parts of your system (since you are a user and those files are owned by the administrator). This is the same person but with a different hat on.\n\nI am told that I am not allowed because I am not the owner of the file, but I don't understand since the folder is on my own computer.\n\nThe answer is simple: you need to do this as administrator and not as a user. And you can do that by adding sudo in front of your command. So it will be something like this...\nsudo cp /dir/to/licence/key /dir/where/TransitionDJ/is/\n\nAfter entering your password it will be copied to the location you want it to be copied too. Change the directories to what is needed for your file.\n\nA: Ubuntu, and Linux in general, is set up so regular users cannot do certain things that would compromise the system. Although you own the computer, you are still a regular user. However, because you do own the computer, you have access to its administrative abilities. However, for security reasons, Ubuntu does not allow you to use your special privilages by default. You must specify you want to, and you do this using the sudo command when working from the command line.\nSo, if you want to be able to move any file anywhere, open a terminal by searching in the Dash for \"Terminal\", and type\ngksu nautilus\n\nThis will start a file manager as administrator, so then you can copy any file to anywhere. But be careful so you don't do something wrong by mistake!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 10.04 not seeing SCSI scanner (Scanpartner 15c) I'm unable to see my old-school SCSI scanner in Ubuntu 10.04.\nHere's what dmesg, lsscsi, and lsmod show:\nroot:~# dmesg | grep Adaptec\n[   18.586163] scsi5 : Adaptec AIC7XXX EISA/VLB/PCI SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 7.0\n[   18.586164]         <Adaptec 2902/04/10/15/20C/30C SCSI adapter>\n\nThis suggests to me that the SCSI card is being seen, and there is a valid driver.\nlsmod output:\nscsi_transport_spi     26284  1 aic7xxx\nlsscsi ouput:\nroot:~# lsscsi -H\n[0]    ata_piix      \n[1]    ata_piix      \n[2]    ata_piix      \n[3]    ata_piix      \n[4]    usb-storage   \n[5]    aic7xxx       \n[6]    usb-storage  \n\nMy question is: What other troubleshooting steps should I take?\n\nA: Recent releases of the sane (Scanner Access Now Easy) packages apparently removed support for the Fujitsu scanpartner.\nSo while the sane-fujitsu system of backends no longer \nApparently the sane-sp15c backends do. \nWill test and report results here.\nDetails: http://www.sane-project.org/man/sane-sp15c.5.html\nSee also: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.sane-project.org/man/sane-fujitsu.5.html\n", "Q: Is there a modern equivalent of python-vm-builder?

For the purpose of this question, \"large directory\" means for example a Linux kernel git repository, or the Chromium source.\nIf I rm -rf a large directory like this from the shell, it is deleted in only a couple of seconds at most.\nIf I move it to trash first and then empty the trash, the first operation takes under a second, then the actual delete takes several minutes (we are talking double figures.)\nWhy is emptying the trash so slow? What is it doing when it says \"preparing.\" How much preparation does it actually take to run rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/?\n\n\nA: When the first operation occurs it just moves the files to the trash.\nWhen you \"trash\" those files it loads the entire tree file into memory and then deletes each file one by one. This allows for timing calculations to know how long it takes to delete the file, how many files are to be deleted, how big those files are, although most of the parameters are not used here, and allows you to press that little red cross to stop the process.\nThats why I always delete from the shell\n", "Q: Publish from shotwell to piwigo I'm using Kubuntu 12.10 and I want to publish from shotwell to piwigo.

In fact, Mark Shuttleworth seems quite opposed to the rolling release model.\n\nA: Rolling release means that the software and the operating system get not only software updates that fix bugs and security related problems, but also get upgrades with new features added to the software stack. \nIn the current model, once Ubuntu gets a new release, the software that gets bundled are \"feature frozen.\" That means that any software update through Update Manager gets only fixes (bugs and security). For example, if you have Libreoffice in Ubuntu 12.04, if you want the latest release, you would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait for backports\n\n*Add an external PPA\n\n*Or, upgrade to Ubuntu 12.10\n\n\nIn contrast, a rolling release model includes not only fixes but also the latest versions of software. This means that you wouldn't need external PPAs because Update Manager would always bring in the latest versions. That also includes parts of the operating system (kernel, drivers, libraries etc.)\n\nA: Rolling Release means that there is no definite release date. The only quality assurance that will be done is that maybe some kind of snapshot is defined.\nIf you look at debian, you find both models.\n\n\n*\n\n*stable is an ordinary release branch.\n\n*testing is the development branch. It is renamed to stable if it gets released.\n\n*unstable is a rolling release branch.\n\n\n13.04 / raring will be released as planned.\n\nA: @Suman is on the money here, but not mentioning a critical point. @H.-DirkSchmitt is completely wrong.\nThe arguably most attractive part of a rolling release is the fact that there's never going to be any active upgrade on your part. Such as getting 13.10 to upgrade your 13.04 system.\nAll upgrades are performed continuously, there is no such thing as a \"release\" (like Precise, Quantal, Raring, Saucy), although a rolling distribution may simultaneously be the foundation for a regular release cycle (such as with Debian).\nThink of it as Google Chrome-style updates for your OS.\n", "Q: how to reinstall mysql? A software upgrade broke, among other things, mysql and I have not been able to get it back up yet.\nSuspected cause: I had a near-full boot disk; the upgrade filled up the disk before completing and thus left everything in a mess. I have given the system more disk and moved /var to its own partition. I am still unsuccessfully trying to revive mysql. \nBelow is what I attempted so far (all as root).\nFirst, mysql does not start (443). Attempts to fix (444, 445) fail. Attempts to remove mysql and (?) apparmor fail (446, 7, 8). A more energetic attempt to remove mysql seems to succeed (449) and the previous errors are no longer seen (450, 1, 2). Mysql can't be reconfigured because it's no longer there (453) but attempting to reinstall it gives back the old error messages and we're back to square one (454).\nI also checked this question (even though in my case it did not break because of an upgrade to 12.04: it was already working on 12.10)\nFixing broken myslq-server package after upgrade to 12.04\nand tried the suggestions in there (458, 461, 462) to no avail.\nWhat else should I do?\nThis is on 3.5.0-25-generic #39-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 25 18:26:58 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n    443  service mysql start\n         start: Job failed to start\n\n    444  dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.5\n         /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure: mysql-server-5.5\n         is broken or not fully installed\n\n    445  apt-get -f install\n         ...\n         Setting up mysql-server-5.5 (5.5.29-0ubuntu0.12.10.1) ...\n         start: Job failed to start\n         invoke-rc.d: initscript mysql, action \"start\" failed.\n         dpkg: error processing mysql-server-5.5 (--configure):\n         subprocess installed post-installation script\n         returned error exit status 1\n         dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of\n         mysql-server:\n         mysql-server depends on mysql-server-5.5; however:\n         Package mysql-server-5.5 is not configured yet.\n         dpkg: error processing mysql-server (--configure):\n         dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\n         No apport report written because the error message\n         indicates its a followup error from a previous failure.\n         Errors were encountered while processing:\n           mysql-server-5.5\n           mysql-server\n         E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n    446  apt-get remove mysql-server\n         ...\n         Removing mysql-server ...\n         Setting up mysql-server-5.5 (5.5.29-0ubuntu0.12.10.1) ...\n         start: Job failed to start\n         invoke-rc.d: initscript mysql, action \"start\" failed.\n         dpkg: error processing mysql-server-5.5 (--configure):\n         subprocess installed post-installation script\n         returned error exit status 1\n         No apport report written because MaxReports is reached already\n         Errors were encountered while processing:\n           mysql-server-5.5\n         E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n\n    447  apt-get remove apparmor\n         ...\n         Package 'apparmor' is not installed, so not removed\n         0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\n         1 not fully installed or removed.\n         After this operation, 0 B of additional disk space will be used. \n         Setting up mysql-server-5.5 (5.5.29-0ubuntu0.12.10.1) ...\n         start: Job failed to start\n         invoke-rc.d: initscript mysql, action \"start\" failed.\n         dpkg: error processing mysql-server-5.5 (--configure):\n         subprocess installed post-installation script\n         returned error exit status 1\n         Errors were encountered while processing:\n           mysql-server-5.5\n         E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n\n    448  apt-get remove mysql-server\n         Reading package lists...

Unfortunately, these commands could not be executed : \ndu -h --apparent-size /media/win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk\nfsck -f /media/win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk\n\nThe error message tells me:\ncannot access `/media/win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk': No such file or directory\n\n\nA: For that sort of resize you need to boot a live CD/USB and mount the NTFS partition containing the root.disk. Then use the full path to the root.disk in all the instructions.\nIn summary. You can't do that from a Wubi install and you have to know where the root.disk is.\ne.g. you installed on C:\\ and that happens to be /dev/sda3, then you would first mount /dev/sda3:\nsudo mkdir /media/win\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /media/win\n\nAnd then you can address the root.disk as: /media/win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk\nIf instead you want to do a resize while running the Wubi install, this alternate method will create a new duplicate root.disk: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ResizeandDuplicateWubiDisk.

Too bad that when I finished the modification and rebooted to apply the changes it broke Elementary's beauty UI! It was showing me an ugly one -- I think it was the X11 -- so I decided to reinstall sharing partitions from the beginning just in case it would finally work... but it didn't.\nI think this is caused by sharing /home partition because before I changed fstab it worked nicely, but not after. Maybe this is related to some UI information Ubuntu saves in the ~ directory?\nWell, I don't know, but the fact is that there's something that's interfering with Elementary UI. Can you think of anything that would cause this -- and how to fix it?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Sharing home dir is not best solution. Your $HOME contains dotfiles that determine UI and behavior of some applications.\nIt would be better to mount home of your main OS to Elementary /media/, and then use soft links to directories with your files.\nYou can also create links for some single config files, like .bashrc, .emacs and so on.\nAlso vitalization is useful if you are interested in testing different operation systems. \n", "Q: How to make Postfix use new IP address?

One of those things that I like in Ubuntu 12.10, is that for some reason my ntfs partition is automatically mounted on boot, without having to use some application like ntfs-config.\nHowever, it's not mounted \"when I need\", because (for example), I have a symbolic link of my Dropbox folder (which is originally placed in that ntfs partition). Therefore, when I login, the Dropbox is started first than the ntfs filesystem is mounted, and I find that error that the Dropbox folder is not found. If I exit dropbox and start again, it works fine then (because the filesystem is mounted by then).\nHow can I do to prevent this?\n\nA: had the same problem.

The web server workers write using syslog(3) to some memory buffer and rsyslogd(8) sends the data to an actual file in parallel, and at its own pace, so processes don't block on IO when logging.\nSo far so good.  The problem is that ocassionally rsyslogd is prevented from writing (e.g. a momentary/prolonged network outage) and the incoming buffer quickly fills up.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can a client ever block when writing to rsyslogd using syslog(3)?\n\n*Is there a way to look at rsyslogd stats, e.g. how big/full is the buffer?\n\n*Is there a way to increase the size of the rsyslogd incoming buffer? \n\n\nA: As far as I remember the default mode for the main message queue in rsyslog is fixed size array. It has a limit for 10k elements or so. Try to change this to linked list queue it should  handle your occasional message bursts much better. \nYes, there are FixedArray and LinkedList queues. \n\nA: The answer to your first question is:\n\nYes, any call to syslog() is blocking. Maybe for a very short time,\n  but it's still a synchronous call involving a file descriptor. See man 3 syslog for more detials.\n\nUnless your servers use asynchronous architectures and primitives, there will always be some locking. Thsi can be mitigated, but not eliminated, for example by using a separatethread for logging.\nFor the other two questions I don't really know but inspection to the rsyslogd source code (as well as to the one for the syslog() family of functions) is the only way to know.\nMore in general, if you move the logging to an external server via the UDP:514 \"network syslog protocol\", then you bring the possibilities to create locks to almost zero.\nWith the drawback of possible loss of some logging during high loads.\nFirst, in the \"originating\" servers you need to ensure all logging happens via syslog.\nFor example, in Apache2 you need to specify:\nErrorLog \"syslog:daemon\"\n\nFor other servers please refer to the proper man page. If you cannot ensure this, please keep in mind that logging on filesystems can create\nSecond, in the originating rsyslogd configuration you ask to direct all syslog traffic for the facility you choose (\"daemon\" in this example) to one or more external syslog servers. In the rsyslog configuration file you can specify:\ndaemon.* @192.168.128.1\ndaemon.* @192.168.254.1\n\nto have two copies of the logs to be sent to two different servers at the same time.\nThird, in the destination server(s) you enable the reception of the  syslog message over UDP:514.  It's in the (destination) rsyslogd configuration file and is normally disabled by defualt (it'd be enough to remove the leading #s:\n$ModLoad imudp\n$UDPServerRun 514\n\nFourth, optional but highly recommended, I would also enable high resolution timestamps:\n$ActionFileDefaultTemplate RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat\n\nAlso this option is normally disabled by default (why on Earth?).\n", "Q: how to do a pbuilder-dist build with dependencies in a ppa?

My problem is when I try to shutdown, Ubuntu refuses to turn off. When I check the running processes, I see that PostgreSQL 9.1 is still in \"stopping process\" (I guess). The next time I try to stop PostgreSQL before shutdown, the case is still not solved.\nAfter a frustrated time, I start to think to uninstall the metasploit with command ./uninstall but the result is still the same.\nIs there anyone who know how to solve this problem?\n\nA: If you have already done sudo halt, sudo shutdown -h now, sudo shutdown now or even init 0 and the system still does not actually shutdown, I suggest to first see in the logs which process is not shutting down correctly. I would start with syslog:\ncat /var/log/syslog or better yet tail -n50 /var/log/syslog and see if there is anything in there mentioning the problem.\nAs you mentioned, you have removed several apps that you thought were the issue, even removing postgresql because it was the one that was showing as shutting down too slow.\nAnother very important part to check is your BIOS. Make sure, in the power management settings has the correct options enabled or set so that an OS can shutdown the computer.\nLastly, you can check some kernel options to see if the problem is power management related. In the terminal type:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nand on the line that says:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nAdd in the second line one of this options:\n\n\n*\n\n*noapic - Will turn off APIC.\n\n*acpi=off or noacpi - Will turn off ACPI.\n\n*acpi=force - Will Force use of ACPI.\nIt should look like this after editing (Example showing noapic)\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"noapic\"\n\nMore information about this 2 options in What are the F6 options during installation?\nAfter setting one of those, save the file and type in the terminal sudo update-grub. then reboot and test to see if the system shuts down.\nIf you still have a system that does not shutdown and has what you commented:\ngnome-session[2464]: WARNING: Unable to stop system: Authorization is required\n\nYou might be suffering from one of this bug reports\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-greeter/+bug/861171\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rabbitmq-server/+bug/670289\n(App Related, but might apply to another specific app)\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upstart/+bug/880240\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/netbase/+bug/903825\nYou will find there suggestions that go from editing /etc/default/halt to changing the order of some services in the rc folders (rc0.d...rc6.d).\nWhat I would suggest, at least until the bug is eliminated is to do a sudo kill -9 PROCESSID or sudo killall PROCESSNAME command on the process that is giving you a problem.\n", "Q: javac and javaws works but not java javac and javaws work from the command line but java for running a .class won't work.\nI have updated my PATH, set JAVA_HOME, and checked links.\nWhen I type java myclass I get \"java\" found in default-jre and a few others.

I have been using Windows OS for a long time and there i needed to install a separate Anti virus Program (included with firewall, anti spam) etc..\nWith my mentor's recommendation, I have replaced Windows with Ubuntu12.10 64 bit.

Do I also need to have an antivirus program on Ubuntu.\nCan anybody guide me about how can I secure the Ubuntu 12.10 64bit System.\nYour advice matters to me a lot.\n\nA: It seems your problem is more about adware and malware than a virus, and blocking such sites could be the solution you require.\nYou can try using a utility like hostsblock to prevent all connection between your computer and such sites. There is a deb file that can be downloaded as well. If the blocklists are not blocking those sites you complain about, you can also add them manually to the list. It also includes a script (hostsblock-urlcheck.sh) to identify the URL addresses involved so that you can add them easily to the block list.\n\nA: As there are very few viruses for Linux (and most of them are for experimental purposes), you shouldn't worry about a virus infecting your system. However, if you are also working with Windows (or with Windows users), it may be useful to scan your system for any file containing viruses, as you may infect the Windows machine when exchanging files.For a list of Anti-Virus software for Linux, check this page.Also, you can visit this page for getting more info about viruses in Linux.\nHave a great day,Alex\n\nA: olha amigo, ate onde eu sei ainda não foi desenvolvido nenhum tipo de vírus ou spyware que seja capas de afetar sistemas operacionais com kernel linux, que é o caso do ubuntu! \nEntão no meu ponto de vista você pode ficar tranquilo,por que seu ubuntu esta seguro!\nsem antivírus algum!!!\n\n                                          English\n\nFriend looks, as far as I know has not been developed any kind of virus or spyware that is covers affect operating systems with Linux kernel, which is the case of ubuntu!

As Windows 8 is awful, I decided to attempt to dualboot Ubuntu.  Did some research, and found out that it is not as simple with UEFI enabled.  If there is some way to keep UEFI enabled (unless it is completely pointless) I would love a step-by-step tutorial.  Either way, I could really appreciate some help as I have seen multiple methods, all of which are different.  If you require any more information about my system, feel free to ask.\nThanks in advance.\nBTW I am a first time Ubuntu installed, so like I said STEP-BY-STEP instructions would be appreciated.\nSeth, like I said I haven't installed Ubuntu on a system before, so I haven't even gotten to that point.\n\nA: UEFI is not completely pointless, but you have to turn it off to install Ubuntu 12.10 (32 bit at least) I'm pretty sure. And computers didn't used to have it, but it is safer. I did this recently, I think it was in the boot menu.\nSTEP 1: Seth is correct. If you want to install Ubuntu 12.10 in 32 bit you have to switch from UEFI to Legacy at least temporarily. He provided a great guide that was upvoted 46 times. Do that first. Once you've turned off UEFI you can install Ubuntu.\nALTERNATIVELY, if you have a 64 bit system you can follow this guide to installing Ubuntu in UEFI: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nSTEP 2: Did you put Ubuntu on a CD/DVD or USB? You need to make a bootable CD/DVD or USB with Ubuntu. There are a million great guides online to do this.\nSTEP 3: Change your boot menu order so that when you turn your computer on, it reads the usb and boots from that instead of from your harddrive. This means you'll be running your OS from your USB or CD as you install it. This will also be included in pretty much every installation guide.\n", "Q: How to change Date/Time format to English?

(where ?? is your other language)\n\nOr, you can go for another solution. Instead of doing what mitch suggested, you can change specifically what you want to change. \nFrom the terminal enter locale to see a list of the different language variables in your system, and then you can just change them, all, or specific. For example, entering:\nLC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8\n\nwill change the date and time back to US-English. \n\nA: \nChoose the New York time when installing Ubuntu 13.04, And do the following steps for you local time.\n\n1.Click on settings > Click on Time & Date\n\nIt need to me check, By default it will be, if not check it\n2.Click on Clock and check Time in auto-detection location\n\n3.Wait few minutes and you will see you local time just above shutdown button \n\nOR\n\nClick on it \nDone\n\n\n", "Q: trying to install from usb- ubuntu 12.04 I have a netbook running Windows XP.  I'm trying to install Ubuntu on it but am running into the same error message that's described on the following post:\nHard disk error\nI basically booted from USB and then once Ubuntu was loaded, i tried to install by creating a separate partition.  It failed with the hard disk error.  Now I'm in a situation where Windows XP won't start either.  I just get a flashing white cursor on my screen.\nIn the above post, one of the suggestions is to check out the disk utility in Ubuntu. i'd like to just format the drive altogether and only have Ubuntu on it... but i have a basic question\nif i format the drive, will the computer still have the smarts to boot from usb so that i can then retry installing the Ubuntu OS?\nsorry for the remedial questions but i haven't tried anything like this before.  I've always bought windows machines that came pre-installed ...\nthanks in advance for the help.\n\nA: The boot sequence used by your computer is mainly a function of the BIOS, see a basic explanation here, when you first turn the computer on, as the BIOS posts, you should be able to access the settings to verify the Boot Sequence, and ensure that it will boot form USB so that you can continue with your Ubuntu installation. Most computers will briefly display some sort of message  telling you which key to press to enter the bios, but I am sure if you look up the make/model of your netbook you will quickly find how to access the BIOS too.\n\nA: Just like the other guy said. You most likely want to hit F2 repeatedly (could be another key depending on your system) as soon as the netbook boots up, then you'll get into the BIOS (a blue menu with options about your computer's hardware) and you can alter the boot list. For example the boot list has booting from the hard drive, CD/DVD, USB, Network, etc.\nAnyway, if you've gotten into the Ubuntu installation before Windows XP loads at all then you've already succeeded in doing this, so I don't know why  these guys just left it at that. If you try to install Ubuntu and still get error messages, I would say you should download a fresh version of Ubuntu and make a bootable USB on another computer. Just google \"how do I make a Ubuntu bootable usb.\" Sometimes downloads are corrupts or something goes a bit wrong and it doesn't want to work.\nIf you don't mind using only Ubuntu, then yah, do the whole disk, because that will be more straightforward and less problems with a boot menu to choose your OS.\nCan you get into the Ubuntu installation? If you can, then wipe the whole thing if you don't mind losing all your XP data.\nAlso, if your computer is an older model, I highly recommend using Lubuntu, the lightweight version of Ubuntu, which works in much the same way.\n", "Q: Nautilus description versus /usr/share/applications file directory When using Nautilus and I navigate to the /usr/share/applications directory I get a listing of the meta data that is extracted from all of the .desktop files that live in that directory.\nSo the file in my example called \"Oracle Java 7 Runtime\" in Nautilus translates to the file JB-java.desktop which I took a wild guess at.

Short of looking for the string \"Oracle Java 7 Runtime\" in all of the files in the directory which is a bit clumsy.\n\nA: The reply by @green7 is OK if you like the terminal.\nHowever, this can be done directly from Nautilus, although it requires a script.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have written the script for you.

I live in Iran and as you know there's a blocking system here. The people here use VPNs to access websites. I did the same. But days ago VPNs (PPTP, L2TP,SSTP) ports was blocked too. The alternatives was Freegate and free software similar to it. People mostly use these software in Windows. But I want a thing which supports Ubuntu too. Furthermore I know that port 443 is not filtered. Do you think is it possible to use OpenVPN in this situation?\n\nA: There are a number of different ways to bypass government bans on websites. And one of them is Tor Browser.\nFurther information can be obtained from: www.torproject.org\nAnd download options are here: www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en\nEDIT:\nAlthough it's fairly straightforward as this Tor Browser Bundled runs as a portable tool, a PPA channel might also come very handy, at least for automatic updates:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://launchpad.net/~upubuntu-com/+archive/tor\n\n*https://launchpad.net/~upubuntu-com/+archive/tor64\n\nA: While Tor is an easy way, it is soooo slooow. The better one would be an SSH tunnel. Mass block of SSH is nearly equal to mass block of Internet. You can easily create your own SSH Tunnel gate on any server abroad that you own. There are even some free tunnel providers, but beware of scams. \n\nA: I certainly recommend you to install Tor. Because it is safer than VPNs and lots of people are using it around the world. So there will be lots of documentations to use.\nYou can run tor (not tor browser) on every browser you like and modify it as you want.\nJust use the code below:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tor\n\nYou can just start a new session on your browser(for example: torify firefox) or  use extensions like FoxyProxy.

This may be changed by listing\n    the desired domain search path following the search keyword with spaces or tabs\n    separating  the  names.  Resolver queries having fewer than ndots dots (default\n    is 1) in them will be attempted using each component of the search path in turn\n    until a match is found.  For environments with multiple  subdomains  please read\n    options ndots:n below to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks and unnecessary traffic\n    for the root-dns-servers.

It provides a bit more clarity.\nBeware of the resolv.conf file being managed by the service resolvconf.\ndns-search appears to be a necessary line in the stanza of a logical interface.\n  3.4 ifupdown\n    * Remove any \"up\" or \"down\" commands from /etc/network/interfaces\n      that futz with /etc/resolv.conf and remove any scripts from\n      /etc/network/if-*.d/ that futz with /etc/resolv.conf.\n    * For each inet static logical interface through which a nameserver is\n      accessible, add lines like the following to /etc/network/interfaces .\n\n          dns-nameservers 11.22.33.44 55.66.77.88\n          dns-search foo.org bar.com\n\n      Other recognized option words are 'dns-domain' and 'dns-sortlist'.\n      These option names correspond to the option names used in the\n      resolv.conf file with one exception: whereas one lists several\n      nameserver addresses in /etc/resolv.conf on several \"nameserver\"\n      lines, here one should list them all on a single \"dns-nameservers\"\n      line.  See resolv.conf(5) for more information.  The lines entered\n      in /etc/network/interfaces will be added to the resolver\n      configuration file (without the \"dns-\" prefix, of course) when a\n      physical interface is brought up as that logical interface.\n      Note that the resolver configuration is updated AFTER all the \"up\"\n      commands have been run; therefore \"up\" commands cannot make use of\n      nameservers listed on \"dns-nameservers\" lines in the same logical\n      interface stanza.  Changing this will require modifying ifupdown\n      so that it talks to resolvconf; currently resolvconf hooks into\n      ifupdown using the script /etc/network/if-up.d/000resolvconf.

When you enter into corporate licensing agreements with Microsoft you often sign over rights for them to come into your business to check that you're only running the number of licenses you've purchased.\nThey do this because some companies have in the past signed up for near-unlimited MSDN licenses and have then ended them but kept the software.\nYou will likely find that your contract with Microsoft allows them to come over and look at the computers for a certain number of years past the contract date. You have a few choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*You allow them in per the terms of that contract. This assumes there is a contract that does allow them access but if this is something you have agreed to, let them come over and marvel at all the lost business they've created.\n\n*You tell them where to stick it and prepare for a fight (or to fight a contract-agreed fine).\n\n*If you can't find anything in your contract (talk to a lawyer please!) about these sorts of check-ups, tell them where to stick it.

How?\n\n*Is it healthy and safe for the HDD with otherwise 512 block size partitions?\n\n\nCheers.\n\nA: I'm assuming you're using ext4. The default is to use a blocksize that has the best performance for the filesystem, and this is usually 4kb already. You can see it by running this command:\n$ sudo tune2fs -l <partition device>\n\nThere's no problem if the HDD has smaller blocks, it just means more than one underlying block is used by the filesystem.\next4 is clever about how it uses blocks, so for large files it will not keep going backwards and forwards in single 4kb calls. A larger block size is not directly possible (mkfs.ext4 -b 8192 <device> will not work, for example). There's an undocumented -C option to specify a cluster size, which effectively increases the block size.\n\nA: \nWould that make sense to format a separate partition with 4096 block size?\n\nUsually yes. It is also the default size used for most filesystems. \n\nWould my IO operations on the files improve? How?\n\nSince you would use the defaults they would not change.\nNow if you wanted to format the low level sectors on the disk (and not the way the filesystem on top of those disk blocks is used):\nIf the disk allows 4KB sector reads you could read 8x more data in a single IO operation. That is not the same as 8x faster, since reading might take longer. It is likely to be somewhat faster though.\n\nIs it healthy and safe for the HDD with otherwise 512 block size partitions?\n\nI suspect that it is neither what you wanted to ask, nor that it is possible with tools which are available to end users.\nThe closest thing I ever did was low level reformat old IBM mainframe SCSI disks from 520 bytes per sector to 512 bytes per sector. That was the entire disk, including spare sectors.\nBy now SATA disks use the same trick as those old SCSI disks: When sector reads fails it will try to read the sector a few times. If a re-read works: no big deal. If it happens a few times to the same sector it is assume to fail soon, and a spare sector is used instead. Thi sis all done in the firmware and the end user does not notice this.\nNow if you start changing physical sector sizes on the disk then you will also need to rewrite the firmware so it is aware of the different sector sizes and uses the right spares. Technically that is possible, but in praxis you will need factory tools and inside knowledge.\n\nA: The block size is relevant to read and store files on the Hard disk. \nWould that make sense to format a separate partition with larger than 4096 block size (e.g. 64k)? \nDepends upon the size of your photographs. If all or at lease most of the files are of a size that are multiples of this or slightly less than multiples of this, it would surely help, otherwise they would just eat up more space.\nWould my IO operations on the files improve? How? \nIf the file-size of a file is in multiples of the block size or again slightly less than the block size, it may help to some extent, since reading and writing is done in blocks, not bytes.\nIs it healthy and safe for the HDD with otherwise 512 block size partitions?\nI am not aware of any ill-effects caused to the HDD because of change in block size.\n", "Q: How can I trace the files and functions a particular terminal uses? In Openstack, lets say for example, i'm entering the command and i start up an instance using the image myimage and use flavor 1.\nnova boot --image myimage --flavor 1 server1 \n\nHow can i actually trace this command and get details like what functions are executed, which files it enters while executing the command etc.,\nSorry I'm a linux noob and i'm trying to find ways to trace few calls. Instead of doing this by going through all the files and doing this. \nIs there a simple way to do this?\n\nA: STRACE\n\nstrace - trace system calls and signals\nIn the simplest case strace runs the specified  command  until  it \n  exits.   It  intercepts  and records  the  system calls which are\n  called by a process and the signals which are received by a process. \n  The name of each system call, its arguments and its return value are\n  printed on  standard error or to the file specified with the -o\n  option.\n\nstrace <command>\n\nYou can filter what you would like to trace using the -e trace= option. For example, strace -e trace=file <command> \"trace all system calls which take a file name as an argument\".

I found a couple of softwares for Windows but I don't want to use Wine and windows dlls in my pc.\nThanks\n\nA: I'd recommend Sigil (http://code.google.com/p/sigil/). I don't think Sigil is java based, but I also don't see the problem with this as you can compile sigil on any platform running ubuntu even if it has no x86 based architecture, if this is your problem (but I don't think so as you were talking about installing wine which is only possible when using a x86 based architecture, so you can simply download ).\nBy the way: Calibre is not a program for making ebooks but for managing and converting it.\nIf you have a x86 based processor (if windows is able to run on your system, the answer to this question is yes, however you can find out by typing uname -m on the command line, if the result contains \"86\" you have this kind of processor) then you can install sigil from a ppa by typing three commands on the command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rgibert/ebook this will ask you for your password\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install sigil\nOtherwise you could compile it from source.\n", "Q: GRUB error while trying to run fully installed Ubuntu 12.04 from SSD Due to my laptop having a RAM problem, I removed its SSD(which contains an Ubuntu 12.04 installation, with my personal data) and attempted to boot it from my old P4 machine lying around. This P4 machine has Windows XP installed on its drive.\nSo what I did was:\n\n\n*\n\n*I disconnected the hard drive of the P4 machine.\n\n*I connected the SSD to the USB port via an adapter, and configured the (c2001) BIOS to boot from the SSD.\n\n\nI am then presented with a GRUB rescue prompt. This is the first time seeing the GRUB prompt and I have no idea what commands to use to even poke around. \nMy first guess is that the problem is with the bootloader as I'm assuming the BIOS would have to load the bootloader in order to display the grub prompt in the first place.

I need a persistent, unique identifier of a USB drive that never changes, to make a mount point folder.\nCan you explain the difference between Disk Identifier, Vendor ID and UUID?\nCan you also advise how I should set this mount point.\n#fdisk -l | cut -f3 -d'/' | cut -f1 -d',' | grep 'Disk identifier:'\n\ngets the Disk identifier.\nand \n#lsusb \n\nshow me the vendor id \nand \n#blkid\n\nand \n#ls /dev/disk/by-uuid\n\nshow me the UUID\nI've read about UUID , but couldn't find and comparison between those three \nplease  help\n\nA: Lets take these in turn:\nDisk Identifier:\nThis applies to an entire hard disk drive (not a single partition). A Disk Identifier/Disk Signature is a 4-byte number that is randomly generated when the Master Boot Record/Partition Table is first created and stored. The Disk Identifier is stored at byte offset 1B8 (hex) through 1BB (hex) in the MBR disk sector. Windows Vista uses the Disk Signature to locate boot devices so changing it can prevent Vista from booting. Apart from being able to display it I am not sure if this is used by Linux.\nVendor ID\nEvery USB device has a Vendor ID (VID), Product ID (PID) and optionally a serial number. The Vendor ID is intended to identify the manufacturer of a product: all USB devices from the same manufacturer should have the same VID irrespective of what they are so a mouse, a phone, a disk drive, etc. if made from the manufacturer should be the same.  \nEach manufacturer is supposed to assign a unique PID to each product they make so the VID:PID combination should uniquely identify a particular product (make and model) some manufacturers choose to assign unique serial numbers to their products but others don't so you can not use the VID and PID to uniquely identify a device because if you ever buy another one of the same make and model It will be the same.  In addition some manufacturers have been known to use the same PID for different similar models.  The output of the lsusb command contains the VID:PID combination.\nUUID\nA UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number. UUIDs are used to identify many different things including some filesystem partitions. Where the UUID is stored for a filesystem depends on the filesystem. Linux ext2/ext3 and Windows NTFS identify filesystems by UUID. UUIDs are generated randomly using either the current time or a random number generator. The UUID is generated and stored when the filesystem is formatted and then does not usually change.\nWhen you copy a partition or disk as raw binary data (for example, with \"dd\") the Disk Identifier or UUID is also copied. That can result in two disks or two partitions with the same identifier. There are utilities to change the UUID to a new (random) number. There are also utilities to change the Disk Identifier in the Master Boot Record.\nThe advantage to a UUID is that no matter where you move a filesystem, an operating system can find that particular filesystem. For filesystems that have no UUID the Disk Identifier can at least be used to locate the disk drive.\nWhile it is possible to change the UUID in normal use this its unlikely to change.\nLinux can use device names for partitions when UUIDs are not available. I would recommend using the UUID to identify your mount point.\nTo set the Mount point there are two options for drives that are permanently connected see the FSTAB -Community Documentation  or for drives that are not always available if you are happy for it to appear as a subdirectory of /media/ but with a known name see RenameUSBDrive\nA USB Drive can be formatted in lots of different formats. Many are formatted FAT by default because its a format that can be read by almost anything. But if this drive is only used on Linux it may be preferable to reformat it ext3 or ext4 see this question How to format a USB or external drive? \n", "Q: Tabs in fullscreen Chrome/Chromium I love Chrome and Chromium, but when I go full screen, I can't get to my other tabs anymore, which I can with Firefox.

I cant merge these two partitons together like in this picture:\n\nThe NTFS partition is my data, I don't want to delete it.

The NTFS is fully supported in Ubuntu. You can install Ubuntu in either of sda1 or sda2 because, both of them have exuberant space for a Ubuntu system. After installing Ubuntu you can use the NTFS partition as you did it in windows.\nIf you want to merge sda1 & sda3 so badly, then you have to delete one of the ext2 partition and use that unallocated space to move NTFS partition by making unallocated space available adjacent to your Ubuntu installation partition. Then you can use the unallocated space to resize your Ubuntu installation partition. Warning!

I would like to swap a number of them so that they perform that function under normal operation and are a function key while the Fn key is being held.\nI assumed that the function keys were just normal keys codes with the set of keys being large enough to include all the possible speical keys. I tried to so as this tutorial suggests (How do I remap certain keys or devices?) and use xev to obtain the key codes and then would use xmodmap to swap their value.\nThis does not seem to work though. The F12 key gives the xev output:\nKeyPress event, serial 41, synthetic NO, window 0x4a00001,\n    root 0xb1, subw 0x0, time 468005, (23,-15), root:(89,37),\n    state 0x10, keycode 96 (keysym 0xffc9, F12), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nWhich I think is to be expected.

Ubuntu loads without any problem.\nWhenever I try to load the Windows 8 OS, I get the following error:\n\nGrub Can't find command 'Drive Map'\n\nI have tried accessing the M4 drive from Ubuntu to see if I can find the boot location on the NTFS windows drive, but I can't mount the Windows drive to Ubuntu, because it gives this error:\n\nFailed to mount '/dev/sdb1': Operation not permitted\n  The NTFS partition is hibernated. \n\nIs there an easier way to fix the grub boot commands that involves not mounting the Windows 8 drive to Ubuntu?\nEDIT:  I tried using the Ubuntu Boot Repiar tool from a LinuxLive USB loader.  The \"Recommended\" fix didn't fix anything, but it gave me this paste file, detailing my boot setup, if it helps:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/5600941/\nI think the major problem lay in that the Windows partition is on another disk, which can't be mounted in Ubuntu, hence I can't use grub probe without getting errors.\nEDIT 2: [SOLUTION]  I ended up just reformatting the Ubuntu drive again, and installing Ubuntu via LiveUSB with the LinuxSecureRemix Ubuntu ISO found here.  This was installed across two partitions on the drive - one for Swap and one for Ubuntu.\nThen I loaded Ubuntu on the new partition, and used GParted to create an EFI partition alongside the Ubuntu and Swap partitions, making sure the EFI partition was created first and then flagged boot_EFI second.  Then I ran Boot-Repair, and used recommended settings.\nBoot-Repair was finally able to detect the now-blank boot_EFI partition, and install Grub.  For whatever reason before, it was not able to use EFI partition created with the Ubuntu install.  \nNow Ubuntu Grub works with windows 8.\nIF you are having trouble with Windows 8 and Ubuntu grub, boot-repair, or burg I would recommend reading here first before you try the reformat that I did.\n\nA: You could try installing rEFInd, which is an alternative to GRUB that usually handles Windows more reliably. If you're using Ubuntu 12.10 with its default installation settings, you should be able to install the rEFInd Debian package and everything will work correctly, although there may be duplicate menu entries.

I'm currently using Ubuntu 12.10, but I also want to install Windows 7 and be able to dual-boot. \nHow would I go about doing this?\n\nA: I had to reinstall Windows 7 recently, and your situation is similar, so here's an overview: shrink and partition or reformat one of your current non-Ubuntu partitions, install Windows 7, then recover Grub2.\nCreate a live USB of Ubuntu using Universal USB installer. Alter your boot order from BIOS and boot into the live USB.\nOpen up GParted (or install it with sudo apt-get install gparted from terminal). Create an NTFS partition either by resizing/formatting an existing partition, or shrinking your current Ubuntu partition (not preferred).\nNow, remove your live USB, insert Windows 7 install disc and reboot into Windows 7 installer. Follow through the installation procedure, making sure to select the NTFS partition you just created above as the Windows install location.\nOnce the Windows install is done, you will find that Ubuntu is not accessible. Again, reboot into the Ubuntu live USB/disk and follow these steps to recover your Grub2 boot menu.\nReboot and you will find Grub2 back in all its glory, with both Windows 7 and Ubuntu as options. You can use Grub Customizer to tweak the order of the boot menu entries.\nIf you have any issues, try searching here on Askubuntu or any search engine, and if you don't find satisfactory answers, leave a comment below!\n", "Q: Mouse freezes randomly I have tried tons of different \"solutions\" to no avail.

The last is used as a cache. This thing is called Intel Rapid Storage Technology. As far as I can tell, it \"uses\" RAID. So I don't want to disable it in Windows. How to proceed?\n\nA: It looks like there's some question about how big the disk is. This type of problem usually occurs for one of three reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You've got a hardware RAID array and you've added a disk to the array. If this is the case, you can tell parted to fix the problem (at the prompt you quoted and cancelled out of).\n\n*Your motherboard supports its own software-based RAID configuration, and this was active when the disk was partitioned, despite the fact that you've got just one disk. This results in the OS (probably Windows) thinking that the disk is smaller than it is. This works fine so long as you're in any OS that honors the software-based RAID setup. If you've booted Linux with such support disabled, though, Linux will see the entire disk, and the problem you report appears. The solution is to bring the two OSes into sync, either by activating the relevant type of RAID support in Linux or by disabling it in the firmware and in Windows. For a single-disk setup, I recommend the latter option, although that means you'll still see the error message in parted. Once the motherboard-based software RAID support is disabled, though, you can tell parted to fix it and everything should be fine. (You may also need to type sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda to erase the errant RAID metadata.)\n\n*Something has set a Host Protected Area (HPA) on the disk, but one of your OSes doesn't honor the HPA. You can check for this in Linux by typing sudo hdparm -N /dev/sda; you should get a report that specifies whether the HPA is active or disabled. How to proceed if you find this depends on why the HPA was active to begin with and what OS is not honoring it.\n\n\nUnless you know you've got a hardware RAID array, I recommend checking for an HPA first, since the results of the hdparm command should be pretty definitive. If there's no HPA, you can then focus on figuring your your software RAID settings and, once you understand them, bringing your two OSes into line.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 Boots to a Black Screen - Intel HD Graphics I am a new to linux.

I do a lot of collaborative work at university, and the main method of communication (and most convenient) for students use is Facebook. I would love to integrate Facebook messages with Ubuntu.\nI know this is almost possible with Pidgin, but this is only really for chat, it doesn't allow me to be offline or see offline messages. It also constantly tells me people are going on and offline as I basically have every person I've ever met on there, and most of they check Facebook on an hourly basis.\nI've seen android apps which have this functionality, so there must be an API for it. Is there an Ubuntu app which handles this nicely?\n\nA: Most of these apps are using XMPP for the service, this means that they have to be online to check for new messages, XMPP supports invisible state. Default chat client for ubuntu is empath - use that instead of Pidgin, in empathy you can set your state to invisible and it wont inform you when users go online. (You can also change that in pidgin settings window.)\n", "Q: Brightness function keys not working I have an  ASUS X55A-SPD0204O laptop. The rest of the FN+Fx (where x = number) like sound + - mute, screen turn off, wireless etc. work perfectly.\nThe problem is with the 2 brightness keys. They just won't work. Any suggestions?\n\nA: You can try to control it from command line and give mesage back if this works in general:\nYou will need xrandr\nxrandr --current --verbose - this will display your current display mode / modes\nimportant is name of your output (clould be LVDS1 or LVDS-0)\nxrandr --output <outputname> --brightness 0.5 - this should control your brightnes, you can try different values. Do not use zero (0) what means lamp is switched off and you will see Big nothing.\nbe careful, some types of devices have completely different set of values (as 0-255, etc. Unfortunatelly I do not have your ASUS to test it)\nThis will work probably independently of the brightness settings reachable normally via keys. If this works, I recommend to watch for key bindings. Advantage is, you can control brightness of external VGA output as well. \n\nA: Try adding acpi_backlight=vendor as a boot option. To do that, open a terminal window, and run\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nLocate this line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\". \nEdit it to look like this: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_backlight=vendor\"\nSave the file, then, in a terminal, run sudo update-grub.\nReboot, and check if the brightness keys work.\n\nA: Upgrade the grub and try you may be able to get the brightness working properly. You may follow this link and to upgrade and fix the brightness problem for your PC.\n\nA: Are you able to change the brightness in system settings (Power manager)? \nIf yes, then maybe just keys are not binded. \nYou could install xbacklight and bind your special keys to appropriate commands. \n\nA: try that .. i had your same problem and it work with me \nOpen a terminal window and type the following:\nsudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nThis will open your X server configuration (after prompting for your password).

I tried changing the boot options (editing-updating grub and stuff) and that didn't work. As I have seen in many forums (and in my case too), the change in the xorg.conf file won't work because there is no such file... so?\nAfter searching a couple hours, I found something interesting:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nsudo reboot\n\nthose lines supposedly get the driver working as it should, but the original problem remains. The important thing is that those lines CREATE the xorg.conf  file, so now it is possible to apply the second solution (adding the Option \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\" line to the file).\nHope this helps someone, I used this on a Samsung R580, with a Nvidia GeForce310m and worked just fine.\nBy the way, I used sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf instead of the nano command, it's just a matter of tastes I guess...\n\nA: Try this app .. for problem in brightness controlling.

I'm having a confusing issue with my SSD. I will describe some of the symptoms.\n\n\n*\n\n*Randomly the GUI will crash. The launcher and panel disappear, programs won't launch and eventually everything blanks out.\n\n*I can switch to another TTY, but when I try to log in I get the message\n\n\nI/O error, dev sda, sector [some sector number]\n\n\n*I then have to force reboot my machine at which point the BIOS fails to recognize my disk and leaves me at a blank command prompt.\n\n*The first time this happened, I thought my drive was dead, but it turns out if I just shut down my machine and start it back up, the drive appears again and I can boot into Ubuntu.\n\n\nIt seems like everything points to a failing drive. BUT besides this issue I can't find any evidence of this.\n\n\n*\n\n*All the SMART tests are positive.\n\n*I've run e2fsck on both partitions and it seemed to be fine.\n\n*I rad badblocks to check for bad sectors and nothing was found.\n\n*I've checked dmesg after an incident and nothing jumps out.\n\n*Most importantly, this issue is reproducible. As long as I force shut down, then bring the machine back up, everything is fine for an hour or so. If I reset the machine, the BIOS can't load the drive. I've done this probably 10 times now and the results are always the same.\n\n\nI just don't know what else to check now. I'm fine with getting a new drive if I need to, but since I can't actually prove that it's broken, I don't want to replace it unnecessarily.\nBasically, can anyone recommend any other tests or debugging steps to prove one way or another the state of my disk?\nAt Tom Brossman's suggestion, I tried switching the SATA port used by the drive. This had no effect. I also changed SATA cables which didn't work either.\nHere's the output of e2fsck.\nHere's the output of `badblocks -v'\nDrive information\n\nSMART status\n\n\nA: I have the same problem with my Dell Latutide E6530 and  ADATA SSD SX900 512GB.\nIt looks like a problem with disk controller and the cache.\nI found some workaround.\nEven if cache is on I enable it again by:\nsudo hdparm -W1 /dev/sda\n\nVery seldom (do not ask me why) it do not work so in this case I disable cache:\nsudo hdparm -W0 /dev/sda\n\nDid you check it out with any Windows? It should answer if it is hardware of software problem.\n\nA: As I originally surmised and as others suggested, this turned out to be a hardware issue.\nI solved the problem by updating both the SSD firmware and the SATA drivers for my motherboard. Since I did these steps at the same time, I'm not sure what actually fixed it. Given that I have several other disks on the same controller, it's likely that the firmware update fixed it.\nBoth updates required me to boot into Windows, which wasn't a huge issue for me since I already had it installed on a different disk.\n\nA: For what I could read about all that you have done I am more certain that it is case similar to one I had about 4 months ago. The problem at the end was the SATA Cable. After changing it the I/O problems were gone.\nNow this does not automatically mean this is the same issue as yours but since you checked the SMART data and even did a fsck on the drive (Which would have thrown a lot of I/O problems) I am more a favor of a hardware problem (Not related to the drive) than the actual SSD drive.\nI would first, test the same drive on another computer. This means, different power supply, different motherboard, different SATA cable and power cable. Test that for the amount of time you need to make sure the SSD drive is the culprit. If the checks you did are all as you mention them, the SSD drive should work and have no problems at all.\nIf they are, then the chipset within the SSD is bad (Very unlikely).\nAfter checking the SSD drive, start changing each important part, first SSD Cable, then motherboard and last the power supply.\nIn my case, like I said, it was the cable. In your case it could be any of the parts related/connected to the drive.\n\nA: LEIGH BARTON\nSectionalize, localize, and isolate the problem.\nMy first step in assessing this problem would be to run the computer from an installation disk using the try ubuntu feature. Try to determine if the computer functions properly using the live operating system. If it does, then it's down to data storage/recovery system in the computer. If not, it's an issue with the computer itself, such as overheating. Assuming the live operating system functions properly, it becomes a hardware/software problem in data management. Your test results indicate that the hardware is functioning within specifications, bearing in mind that Solid state drives are relatively recent and still have some bugs to be worked out. That leaves software and the multitude of problems that can strike. That means data corruption, viruses, or program conflicts. The only feature of the operating system that shuts down the screen is the screen saver, try disabling the screen saver, tell it never to shut down the screen. I don't know what type of decontamination software you run on the computer, but I went for Clam-TK right after installation. Scan for viruses. Finally, there's the possibility of program conflicts, if you didn't install any programs just prior to these symptoms developing it's unlikely, and since I'm relatively new to LINUX myself I can't tell you what software to use to look for conflicts. You'll have to research that on your own. That's as much as I can offer.  \n", "Q: The package system is broken: I can't update my apps on Ubuntu 12.10 64bit screen shot:\n\ntext:\n\"Check if you are using third party repositories.

I have recently installed Ubuntu Server on my machine - successfully. However, the system does not read my keyboard input on the password on login. Is there something I did not do right? How do I go about fixing this problem?\n\nA: Passwords are meant to be secure, and therefore (to prevent 'shoulder surfing') are usually suppressed (or replaced with an 'asterisk' per character).\n\nFor a graphic interface ('GUI') that makes sense, and you may even have a dialog box option to 'view password'.\nFor a server (which may be remote) it is more secure to simply suppress any response, or visible cue, to what is being typed. That may be confusing the first time, but will be second nature once you understand the reason.\n", "Q: How can I increase battery life in Ubuntu? I really like Ubuntu, and I want to work with it always instead of windows. But the problem I find is that the battery runs out very fast (< 2 hours) when I use Ubuntu.

In Ubuntu if the brightness is not increased or decreased you can refer here . Moreover try updatating the kernel.\n\nA: you can use TLP: is an advanced power management command line tool for Linux that tries to apply these settings / tweaks for you automatically, depending on your Linux distribution and hardware\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2013/04/improve-power-usage-battery-life-in.html\n\nA: I recommend trying laptop-mode-tools.

So I've decided to remove it from a couple of machines which went OK (except the extra effort of moving/resizing partitions to the left and sometimes having to repair Windows boot manager).\nIn one of the machines, however, I was surprised to see that the new partition numbers start from 2 in GParted. And the output of fdisk -l is like this:\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb2   *        2048    52426751    26212352    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sdb3        52426752   942684159   445128704    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sdb4       942684160   976773119    17044480   12  Compaq diagnostics\n\nIt took me some time to discover that the reason for this was the fact that somehow a zero-size invisible partition was left after I deleted that partition as seen in the output of sfdisk -l below:\n   Device Boot Start     End   #cyls    #blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1          0       -       0          0    0  Empty\n/dev/sdb2   *      0+   3263-   3264-  26212352    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sdb3       3263+  58679-  55416- 445128704    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sdb4      58679+  60801-   2122-  17044480   12  Compaq diagnostics\n\nApart from the unseemly partition numbering, I'm curious to know how I can ged rid of this weird partition?\n\nA: You can't, because it's not there. On an MBR disk, there are always precisely four primary partition entries, but some of them can be unused. The sfdisk -l command you used lists all of these entries, even if they're unused. In other words, sfdisk -l is showing a \"ghost\" entry -- the data structures are present, but they don't define a partition. You could shift the numbers so that you've got partitions 1-3 rather than 2-4, but then using sfdisk -l would show a similar \"ghost\" partition #4. This is not an error, a bug, or a problem; it's just the way the MBR data structures are defined.\nI mentioned you can shift the partition numbers. AFAIK, this is awkward to do with fdisk, sfdisk, or parted, and you also risk rendering Windows unbootable if you try, since Windows can be fussy about its partitions. Thus, I don't recommend you try; just live with the fact that your partitions begin with #2. If, however, this bugs you enough to risk an unbootable Windows installation, you could try my FixParts program. It includes an s option that sorts the partitions; that should shift their numbers down by 1. If you try this and Windows doesn't boot, though, I can't help you, since I'm not a Windows expert.\n", "Q: Minecraft server (Bukkit) .sh bash file not opening My Minecraft server (Bukkit) .sh bash file is not opening!

Alternatively you could add the absolute path to the script:\n#!/bin/bash\njava -Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -jar /path/to/craftbukkit.jar -o true\n\nAlso you should execute the script in a terminal to be able to see the output.

Starting from (notice the wildcards before and after \"some text\")\nfind . -type f -name '*some text*'\n\nhow can one exclude/ignore all hidden files and directories?\nI've already been googling for far too long, came across some -prune and ! (exclamation mark) parameters, but no fitting (and parsimonious) example which just worked.\nPiping | to grep would be an option and I'd also welcome examples of that; but primarily I'm interested in a brief one-liner (or a couple of stand-alone one-liners, illustrating different ways of achieving the same command-line goal) just using find.\nps: Find files in linux and exclude specific directories seems closely related, but a) is not accepted yet and b) is related-but-different-and-distinct, but c) may provide inspiration and help pinpoint the confusion!\nEdit\nfind . \\( ! -regex '.*/\\..*' \\) -type f -name \"whatever\", works. The regex looks for \"anything, then a slash, then a dot, then anything\" (i.e. all hidden files and folders including their subfolders), and the \"!\" negates the regex.\n\nA: You don't have to use find for that. Just use globstar in shell it-self, like:\necho **/*foo*\n\nor:\nls **/*foo*\n\nwhere **/ represents any folder recursively and *foo* any file which has foo in its name.\nBy default using ls will print file names excluding hidden files and directories.\nIf you don't have globbing enabled, do it by shopt -s globstar.\nNote: A new globbing option works in Bash 4, zsh and similar shells.\n\nExample:\n$ mkdir -vp a/b/c/d\nmkdir: created directory 'a'\nmkdir: created directory 'a/b'\nmkdir: created directory 'a/b/c'\nmkdir: created directory 'a/b/c/d'\n$ touch a/b/c/d/foo a/b/c/d/bar  a/b/c/d/.foo_hidden a/b/c/d/foo_not_hidden\n$ echo **/*foo*\na/b/c/d/foo  a/b/c/d/foo_not_hidden\n\n\nA: find $DIR -not -path '*/\\.*' -type f \\( ! -iname \".*\" \\)\n\nExcludes all hidden directories, and hidden files under $DIR\n\nA: This prints all files that are descendants of your directory, skipping hidden files and directories:\nfind . -not -path '*/.*'\n\nSo if you're looking for a file with some text in its name, and you want to skip hidden files and directories, run:\nfind . -not -path '*/.*' -type f -name '*some text*'\n\nExplanation:\nThe -path option runs checks a pattern against the entire path string. * is a wildcard, / is a directory separator, . is a dot (hidden filenames start with a dot on Linux), and * is another wildcard. -not means don't select files that match this test.\nI don't think that find is smart enough to avoid recursively searching hidden directories in the previous command, so if you need speed, use -prune instead, like this:\n find . -type d -path '*/.*' -prune -o -not -name '.*' -type f -name '*some text*' -print\n\n\nA:  The answer I originally posted as an \"edit\" to my original question above: \nfind . \\( ! -regex '.*/\\..*' \\) -type f -name \"whatever\", works. The regex looks for \"anything, then a slash, then a dot, then anything\" (i.e. all hidden files and folders including their subfolders), and the \"!\" negates the regex.\n\nA: @Flimm's answer is good, particularly because it prevents find from descending into hidden directories. I prefer this simplification:\nGenerally to exclude all hidden paths (regular files, directories, etc):\nfind <start-point> -path '*/.*' -prune -o <expression> -print\n\nFor example, using your working directory as the start point, and -name '*some text*' as the expression:\nfind . -path '*/.*' -prune -o -name '*some text*' -print\n\nIn contrast to what @Flimm's answer suggests, no hidden files or hidden directories is the simple case. The -path '*/.*' expression is true for any path (regular files, directories, etc) that has a . immediately after your file separator, /. So this line will prune both hidden files and directories. \nAllowing hidden files while excluding hidden directories is the case that requires a further filter. This is where you would include -type d in the the expression being pruned.\nfind <start-point> -type d -path '*/.*' -prune -o <expression> -print \n\nFor example:\nfind . -type d -path '*/.*' -prune -o -name '*some text*' -print\n\nIn this case -type d -path '*/.*' is true only for directories, and so only directories are pruned. \n\nA: This usually works too\nfind * [expression]\n\nUsing * shell wildcard for input all paths from working directory, usually * wildcard doesn't expand to hidden files but this could be changed in the shell options.\nExample:\nfind /path/* -iname file -mtime -3\n\n\nA: This is one of the few means of excludes dot-files that also works correctly on BSD, Mac and Linux:\nfind \"$PWD\" -name \".*\" -prune -o -print\n\n\n\n*\n\n*$PWD print the full path to the current directory so that the path does not start with ./\n\n*-name \".*\" -prune matches any files or directories that start with a dot and then don't descend\n\n*-o -print means print the file name if the previous expression did not match anything. Using -print or -print0 causes all other expressions to not print by default.\n\n\nA: A variant on https://askubuntu.com/a/749708/321070\nfind  -name '.?*' -prune -o -print\n\nInstead of setting the directory to a full path, instead filter out things that mat ch .?* - a literal dot, any character, and then 0 or more characters.\n\nA: find has neat logic switches such as -and and -not you can use them to your advantage to find a matching file with two rules like so:\n$ touch non_hidden_file.txt .hidden_file.txt somethings/.another_hidden_file.txt                                                 \n\n$ find . -type f -name '*hidden_file*' -and \\( -not -name \".*\" \\)                            \n./non_hidden_file.txt\n\nAs you can see, find uses two rules  -name '*hidden_file*' and -and \\( -not -name \".*\" \\) to find those filenames that match both conditions - filename with hidden_file in it but without leading dot. Note the slashes in front of parenthesis - they are used to define parenthesis as find arguments rather defining a subshell (which is what parenthesis mean otherwise without slashes)\n\nA: $ pwd\n/home/victoria\n\n$ find $(pwd) -maxdepth 1 -type f -not -path '*/\\.*' | sort\n/home/victoria/new\n/home/victoria/new1\n/home/victoria/new2\n/home/victoria/new3\n/home/victoria/new3.md\n/home/victoria/new.md\n/home/victoria/package.json\n/home/victoria/Untitled Document 1\n/home/victoria/Untitled Document 2\n\n$ find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -not -path '*/\\.*' | sed 's/^\\.\\///g' | sort\nnew\nnew1\nnew2\nnew3\nnew3.md\nnew.md\npackage.json\nUntitled Document 1\nUntitled Document 2\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*. : current folder\n\n*remove -maxdepth 1 to search recursively\n\n*-type f : find files, not directories (d)\n\n*-not -path '*/\\.*' : do not return .hidden_files\n\n*sed 's/^\\.\\///g' : remove the prepended ./ from the result list\n\n\nA: This answer to a similar question, is the only one that gave me the same results I'd get if I went into each folder, and then did an ls.

Also make sure that the path to the actually usb device, not a partition. For example if the usb device was sdb you might see a primary partition, sdb1 in /dev. of=/dev/sdb1 will not work. You must write to the actually usb device with of=/dev/sdb or the usb device will not be recognized as a boot disk.\nWhen you want to use the usb device for anything else, you can make a partition with the remaining space and it will still function as a boot disk or you can reformat the entire disk and use it again for whatever purpose. dd is a real gem that is often overlooked.

Apparently there needs to be one to be able to write feedback to the launcher (Like Message Counts) but so far I haven't been able to find one. So I am wondering if its even possible to make it work. Here's the explanation.\nI am using the KildClient Mud Client, which is written in Perl. So far so good right? Well, if I want to write a plugin to allow feedback to the Launcher, I'm going to need something that can use Perl. Right? Unless of course there's command-lines to be used for that (Which theoretically would make it even easier)... \nKildClient is a MU Client, or Chat Client, and I want to have a message count added so I stop missing every messages while I'm checking videos on youtube or something. I've seen X-chat being able to do those messages when receiving an important message, so I would like to be possible to do the same via perl! Thank you.\n\nA: You need to use the Glib::Object::Introspection module, and load the Unity package through it to get access to the API for launchers. For indicators, you'd want to use Indicate for example.

I first chose \"Install Ubuntu\", then \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\", but in the next step, when I tried to allocate disk space by dragging the divider, I wasn't able to give Ubuntu less than 32 GB.\nMy harddisk has 500 GB, and as the guide states, \"Ubuntu needs about 4.5 GB to install, so add a few extra GB to allow for your files.\" - This surely does not mean more than 10-15 GB? Is there a quick and easy way to install Ubuntu on a partition of exactly this size, i.e. without having to choose the \"Something else\" option at the beginning of the installer procedure?\nMaybe someone can explain me why appaerently there is a minimum of 32 GB, given the overall size of my HDD?\n\nA: I think you are answering your question when you say:\n\nIs there a quick and easy way to install Ubuntu on a partition of exactly this size,   i.e. without having to choose the \"Something else\" option at the beginning of the installer procedure?\n\nThe quick an easy way is to select the options given to you. The other way is to use the option 'Something else'.\nAbout the 32GB, most users trying ubuntu don't want to have the bare minimal use of hard drive for it, install a few applications and games and find out that they just ran out of space. I think Canonical is trying to give you an useful partition you can actually live with for a while before running out of space.\nFinally, there are great guides for installing using the \"Something else\" and once you do it once you will find it quick, easy and better since you have more control over what is going on.\n", "Q: How to make Ubuntu backups readable on Windows I want to backup my files in Ubuntu 12.04 to an external drive in a way that they are accessible from my wife's computer which is not Ubuntu, it's Windows. How do I do that? I don't want any compression or encryption, just the files in their trees in a way that is readable when the external drive is connected to a Windows-based machine.\n\nA: \nThe following is not suitable as a backup solution for Ubuntu\n\nTo save files for importing to a Windows OS the easiest would be to just format the external drive with FAT32 or NTFS and copy your files there. By this all files and their trees will be accessible from any Windows computer.\nHowever with this method you will loose all Ubuntu file permissions. It is therefore not advisable to copy these files back to Ubuntu, it is more a one-way solution for sharing files from Ubuntu but not from Windowsb back to Ubuntu.\nIn case you need to keep your file permissions you will have to format your external drive with e.g. ext4, and install software on the Windows computer to read an Ubuntu file system:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to read ext4 partitions in Windows?\n\nA: The issue you have here is the filesystem you need to choose. The  systems where the different OS's are default happy with are not compatible, but there are ways around this.\nThe easiest is to format the disk in FAT32. This is a bit old, and you will have trouble with big files. There is a quite low upper-file-size limit of 4 Gb. So if you have DVD's, blu-ray or the like, you might get in trouble.\nYou can also use the windows-filesystem (NTFS) for linux. There used to be some trouble, but there is support for it now-adays. Choose this if you can't use FAT32\nI would advice against choosing one of the 'default' systems from linux (EXT3, ReiserFS, etc) as their support in windows is limited to non-existend. WIth the above 2 options your wife will not have any problem reading the disk.\n", "Q: How to run a bash .sh after starting a program in PlayOnLinux? I have a little script that needs executing every time I open a wine program. The script is pretty simple:\n#!/bin/bash\nxdotool windowmove 67108871 1440 0\n\nHow do I get PlayOnLinux to run this script every time I open a certain program?\n\nA: I don't use PlayOnLinux, but maybe a generic approach will be of some use.\nThe basic idea is to replace the invoking script - the one that runs your program now - with a new one that runs your your new script before or after running the invoking script (whichever best suits what you want to accomplish - probably after, in your case).\nIf your script can run before your program, then all you have to do is find the script or program that invokes your program and replace it by another script (with a different name, if possible, so as not to cause confusion or worse).\nThe new script would run your setup script and then run the original script to invoke your program (using the full path to the invoking script if your new script has the same name as the original one - to avoid an infinite loop.)\nIf your script has to run after your program has started (as it might in your case), that's a lot trickier. I have no idea how to do that, but I'd start looking by getting the program's process number and seeing if I could look up the window from the process number. (I have not used xdotool, but looking at its description suggests that maybe using xdotool search or xdotool getactivewindow windowmove ... might be useful. It looks like you can do anything you want as long as you know the window's unique name.)\nIf you can get that to work, then invoking it would just involve invoking the original script and then your script. To do that, your new invoking script would invoke the original script then your new script. But, your invoking script probably won't relinquish control back to your script until your program is completely finished and it's too late to run your new script.\nIf you can run your invoking script with an & after it to let it run in background, then control will come right back to your script and you can immediately run your new script to modify the window. If this works, then $! will contain the process number of your invoking script, if that helps.\nHTH\n\nA: Try this :\nAssuming file name of program to launch is birds.exe from C:\\Program Files\\\nIn the beginning of bash script copy this code (with modified  file name).\nwhile ! ( ps aux |grep -v 'grep' | grep 'Birds.exe' >/dev/null ); do echo 'waiting for pgm to start...'; sleep 1; done; echo \"Program 'Birds.exe' stared'\"  \n\nChange Birds.exe to correct file name. Thus the rest of script is executed only if the program started.\n", "Q: Will I have problems installing multiple desktop environments? I currently have Unity and Gnome 3.6 installed on my computer and I want to check out the KDE desktop environment. Is there any problem with installing multiple desktop environments on my desktop?   \n\nA: That is rather difficult to answer depending on what will be considered a problem and on your level of tolerance to what are arguably small or negligible problems. (Some people are very tolerant to errors in Linux just because they haven't payed for it.)\nYou can install as many desktop environments you want, but... is that reasonable? - Isn't that even crazy? - If the camel's back didn't brake it doesn't mean we have to try to break it. \nThere are also problems and bugs that can happen, and conflicts are also possible even without multiple desktops.\nI think these risks will increase the more DEs are installed on the same system,  the greater the difference is between them, and the heavier/complex they are.\nThe greatest difference I can see is that between KDE/Qt and GTK systems. Unity, Gnome and KDE/Plasma are all rather large and complex (compared to Xfce. LXDE, Openbox, Fluxbox).\nAs for my own experience, I have always had problems with multiple desktops, usually only in one of them. That is: there may be a big chance to have some problems at least in one of them.\nI wouldn't dream installing as many desktops environments as possible, whatever that means.\nWant KDE? Go for Kubuntu.  \nWant Xfce? Go for Xubuntu.  \nWant LXDE? Go for Lubuntu.\nWant GNOME? Go for Ubuntu GNOME.  \nWant GNOME alongside Unity alternatively?  \nThat seems reasonable, but some say no on that also: https://askubuntu.com/a/491049/47206.\nJust to test them on the short term, one could go with a virtual environmen (VirtualBox), a bootable live-usb system, or even a separate partition in multi-boot. The latter is more complicated (you have to know what you do) but I prefer it to mixing DEs.\n\nA: You can install as many desktop environments you want, but installing anything takes up space which might be something to consider if you have a machine with lesser storage space.\n\nA: You won't have problems installing them, you might even be able to permanently change to a new DE, if you're ready to spend a relatively long time tinkering around and adjusting settings.\nBut desktop environments are big complex things designed to be usable, not swappable. So if all you want to do is check out another DE, you will get a better idea by running a distro that uses the DE of your choice (either in a VM or booting a live CD/USB)\n\nA: You won't have any problems installing multiple desktop environments. Nothing in the system will stop you from installing KDE, GNOME, Unity, Enlightenment, and all the others all at once (except for disk space).\nHowever, desktop environments will often \"argue\" with each other and overwrite settings. For example, installing KDE on a system will very often break a Unity installation by overwriting GTK or similar properties. Similarly, installing Unity will break KDE most of the time.\nUnfortunately for you, these incompatibilities are very hard to repair after they've happened, so this is a risk you must be willing to take with your system. If you want to explore different environments, I'd highly recommend you use VMs until such time as you find one you like. Then, install that one and only that one on your system.\n\nA: You can install as many desktops you want, but only to test them. \nForget what everyone says. \nAn open source OS can be used the way you like it, that's why its open source. But to make something work correctly, you have to install it's ppa and all their dependencies too.\nIf you do that, then all desktop environments will work just fine. If you miss something , then yes you will have many issues.\nAlso about ram. All desktop environments won't be running at the same time. At login you choose one.\nDisk space is the only thing you need. That's all.\n\nA: As long as your system having a lot of RAM and Storage it wont be a big problem. How ever it is better to have less desktop environment. I would suggest you KDE and Gnome because most of the softwares developed on the top of these distros only.\n\nA: There can be problems but depends on the desktop environment you are working on vs which you prefer to install. The main problem comes with the dependencies and default packages as many packages are same for different desktop environments.\n\nI once installed pantheon desktop environment on top of an existing\n  Ubuntu Unity installation, after installing the new pantheon\n  desktop(which was in beta..loki early releases) was full of bugs and\n  glitches and was not pleasant at all to use. So i decided to uninstall\n  my pantheon and return back to unity. As it happens after purging\n  pantheon daily ppa and its packages it broke my unity installation, almost to the point where i had to reinstall Ubuntu itself.\nOn a similar case i installed budgie-remix stable from ppa and wanted to try out its cool new looks, as it turns out again the experience was not quite upto my expectations  so i purged and removed budgie-remix and it did not cause any problems with my desktop at all.\n\nSo, As long as the installation environment does not have any problems with the existing environment it's all good!.\nP.s: These are my observations, you can do whatever the hell you want if you have some terminal experience up your sleeve.\n", "Q: How to add support of windows-1251 encoding for mp3 tags for VLC player I'm having trouble viewing mp3 tags info using VLC player.

The games won't run when i try to run them(Faster Than Light crashes the system, The Cave just won't start).

Although Ubuntu works fine, I have not been able to boot back into Windows 8 since then. After some digging, I found something called Boot Repair and used it. That didn't help either, but it generated this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5602278/. I'm new to this kind of stuff, so any help will be appreciated. If there's something else you need to see, please tell me. Thanks in advance.\nUPDATE 1: So I went into the terminal, typed sudo update-grub, rebooted, entered recovery mode, and selected update grub bootloader. I let it do its thing, and when it finished, it told me to press Enter, so I did. Then I chose the reboot option, and it failed. So I shut down and started up again. I chose Windows 8 (loader), and this came up: \n\nPressing F8 and Enter both just refresh that image. I had to reboot again.\nI then chose Ubuntu in the GRUB menu (the one you use to boot into Ubuntu), and it glitched, so I had to restart. This happened to me 4 times; each time it glitched differently. It finally worked on the 5th time.\nUPDATE 2: I have a recovery partition, but everything in it except for the option to open the terminal is disabled. Again, thanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: Please update your grub and next time when you boot into ubuntu, select recovery mode and upgrade grub bootloader.. And then, reboot.. I think it should solve the problem.\n\nA: For my problem, I had two OS flags on the same partition. For this, I went into Ubuntu and used G Parted to make sure I only had one flag set. This is where you can check to see that you only have one boot flag set. Otherwise, you'll have issues. If this does not apply to you, then ignore this step.\nI then went back into the funky Windows shell that is in the advanced options or whatever it is when you can't boot normally in Windows.

So, in the interest of feeling informed about the varied desktop environments that exist, I've performed two apt-get install for xubuntu-desktop and lubuntu-desktop in recent months.  I didn't really much care for either one, I guess I've just come to appreciate the Unity UX.\nAt any rate, and entirely anecdotally speaking, I can't help but feel like ever since the first apt-get for xubuntu-desktop that load time was a little slower than before.  Talking from Power On to the login screen here.  Not only that, but it replaced my loading screen with the xubuntu one :(  After downloading lubuntu-desktop, I feel more certain that the computer takes a little longer from power button to login screen (and the splash screen wasn't even present at last login, but honestly that seems cosmetic to me so I'm not terribly concerned).  Of course, I've never taken a stopwatch with me to watch things boot up, so this is nothing but my limited perception.\nI'm on the verge of doing a re-install just to clear the Win7 partition (and possibly the Win7 recovery partition, if that's safe) off this computer altogether as I just don't use it, so this may be a moot point.  But that doesn't mean I won't get an itch to try out something like Cinnamon desktop or any of the myriad that are out there, and so before I go recreating the same problem for myself - is it conceivable that the startup sequence gets a little wonky after installing all those desktop environments?\n\nA: Installing lots of packages can definitely have a negative impact on performance.  Many people argue about the actual impact; some call it insignificant, which theoretically might be true if none of the packages install start-up daemons. The reality is that many packages install daemons, and each daemon will require additional resources at boot time.  \nIf you want to rectify this perceived problem, I recommend you carefully review your packages, and remove those you deem extraneous.  Without knowing the packages, and what each one provides, this can be a very confusing task.  You may find you've over-removed, and might have to install specific packages again.\nTo make the process less risky, I highly recommend installing deborphan.  It will help you locate orphaned dependencies.  Additionally, you may want to also use debfoster, to identify which meta-packages should be removed.  Just proceed with caution, and investigate package names if you're unsure.  \nTo install Deborphan and Debfoster, run:\nsudo apt-get install deborphan debfoster\n\nHere is a small list of commands, which I use to help this process:  \n\n\n*\n\n*List Installed Packages: dpkg -l | cut -d' ' -f 3 | sort\n\n*List Orphaned Lib Packages deborphan --guess-all\n\n*List Orphaned Packages deborphan -a | awk '{ print $2 }' | sort\n", "Q: Moving from Windows Install to full install for Ubuntu 12.10 I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 inside windows but would now like to do a full install. Is this a matter of uninstall and reinstall or is there a short cut given that all updates are downloaded?\n\nA: There is no way to make a Wubi install the only OS.\nI am assuming you used the Wubi installer. Because you used Wubi, which installs inside Windows like a program, you need to do a complete install.\n1.) Back up all of your data (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, USB key, SSD, etc.). This method will completely format your hard disk.\n2.) Download the appropriate Ubuntu .iso from here.\n3.) Use the built in function inside Windows to burn the .iso to an DVD.\n4.) After you have burnt the .iso to the disc, completely shut down your machine and boot into the Ubuntu install DVD you have just burnt.\n5.) Follow the instructions to install. If it detects Windows 7, tell it to erase it. It is up to you if you want to encrypt.\n6.) Enjoy Ubuntu!\n", "Q: How can I prevent the screen from going black in vnc when inactive?

I am thinking of starting a small side project and developing a piece of software. I would like to base it's design on Geary, which I like very much. Which GUI library can I use to achieve this?\nGeary is written in Vala, which I am not very interested in using. It would also be a shame if the method I used was not cross compatible.\nThanks\n\nA: Geary's UI is GTK+ 3 based.  The folder list (left column) and conversation list (middle column) are Gtk TreeViews.  The conversation viewer and email composer are both WebKitGTK WebViews, so that's all HTML and CSS you're seeing.\nGTK+ and WebKitGTK both provide C interfaces.  There's standard bindings for many other languages, including Vala, Python, C++, etc.\nFor the most part the toolbars, dialogs, account management windows, etc. were built using Glade.  The cool thing about Glade is it saves your UI as an XML file which can be loaded into any GTK+ app, regardless of the language it's written in.\nEven if you don't write your application in Vala I'd encourage you to look at the Geary source if you'd like to see how things work since GTK is pretty similar in any language.  You can browse the source online here:\nhttp://git.yorba.org/cgit.cgi/geary/tree/\nHope that's enough to get started!

Is there an easy way to achieve this and still retain the automount behavior that I get with ecryptfs-setup-private?\n\nA: I also wanted to accomplish the same thing, so I've tested a little bit and realized that symlinks alone can do what we want.\nYou can simply move the .Private folder to some other partition, and create a symlink at the old location pointing to the location of .Private in the new partition.\nAutomount and unmount still works perfectly.\n\nA: You can add volume definitions to /etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml:\n<volume user=\"steve\" mountpoint=\"/home/steve/.Private\" path=\"/dev/loop0\" fstype=\"crypt\" />\n\nand make sure pam includes this by adding @include common-pammount in /etc/pam.d/login and /etc/pam.d/gdm.\nDuring bootup the loop device is setup by adding in /etc/rc.local:\nlosetup /dev/loop0 /data0/private/steve\n\nMake sure the file setup as the loop device is the LUKS encrypted file (run file on the datadirectory).\nYou can check beforehand if this should work by running the following commands (run them one by one so you can type in the password), and assuming the file with the encrypted partition is /data0/private/steve and that /home/steve/.Private is an empty directory:\nlosetup /dev/loop0 /data0/private/steve\ncryptsetup luksOpen /dev/loop0 home.crypt\nmount /dev/mapper/home.crypt /home/steve/.Private\n\nFor the automount to work, I had to make my login password the same as for the encrypted file on the big partition.\n", "Q: What exactly is non-interactive program? man page for wget says\nNAME\n   Wget - The non-interactive network downloader.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n   Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background,\n   while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a retrieval\n   and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work.  By\n   contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence,\n   which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.\n\nwget is an example of non-interactive program I know. Now my question is,\n\n\n*\n\n*How can wget be used without user logged on?\n\n*How does non-interactive programs work?\n\n\nA: \nHow can wget be used without user logged on?\n\nBy including the wget command in a daemon/service or a program where you as a user do no initiate the download. \n\nHow does non-interactive programs work?\n\nWhen you create a deamon and have this daemon active it can continue to probe a server and ask for a download. If the servers is dead the non-interactive program will continue when the server is back up without any need for the user to act.\nUpdating Ubuntu, for instance, can be done without any action from a user and even without logging in. \n\nA: For me the easiest way of running things while you are not logged in is by including a line in your crontab file:\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n*/30 * * * * test -x /home/koju/bin/yourscript && /home/koju/bin/yourscript\n\nThe test is there to not to have cron complain via email when yourscript cannot be found.\nFor the format of the first fields look at man 5 crontab.\nFrom yourscript you call wget, since it is non-interactive it will not prompt you to interact by asking for input. As long as the command line options of wget get you the information you need, the above set up will run for you every 30 minutes.\nOf course you should test yourscript by starting it by hand, before committing it to run on a regular basis. You might find that wget is not powerful enough to do what you want, especially on web pages that require user-interaction above the basic login.\n", "Q: I can not updated my ubuntu 12.04 Failed to fetch 403 \"Two Host Req Hdr\" I have a problem these days, I can not update system.

You can do this in the server installer.  Create a partition on each disk designated as a raid component, then create a raid array out of the components.  You can then install the whole system onto the raid array, but it is a better idea to use the raid array as an LVM physical volume, and use LVM to divvy up the array into different logical volumes, and leave some space for later use.  If you care about handling the possibility of one of the 4 disks failing, then you should use either raid5, or raid10.  Raid5 will give more usable space, and better sequential write throughput.  Raid10 will give better random IO throughput and may even handle a second disk failing, depending on which one it is.\nSee wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm for more information on lvm.\n\nA: It seems that there's a \"virtual filesystem\" solution here: \nhttp://romanrm.ru/en/mhddfs\n", "Q: Want some advanced configuration with ufw I've read the ubuntu developer docs regarding the ufw here, but couldn't find what I was looking for.

Therefore I decided to do clean install on HP Laptop. I contacted HP, they said they don't have drivers for Linux OS.\nI suppose that vendor specific drivers can be obtained (not sure though).\nBut I have heard that using Ubuntu machine gets heated up and it might cause hardware problems.\nTherefore I am afraid to install.\nI need suggestions.\n\nA: Try the Live version of the USB/CD.  Linux kernel typically has the drivers you need.  The live version of Ubuntu, aka Try Ubuntu,  is the default option on the install disk.  Once running it allows you to run \"System Testing\" your computer for compatibility.\n\nUbuntu also has pretty \"sane\" defaults -- and is quite stable and one of the most installed and tested desktop distrobutions.  I suggest using Ubbuntu 12.04LTS -- as its most stable and will have security patches until 2017.  But 12.10 might have more ubdated drivers if you have a particularly new laptop.  In general HP has pretty good support for open source drivers.\n\nA: I also own an HP pavilion g6 laptop. I also had that overheating issue and very low battary lifetime issue with Ubuntu 13.04 and before. I solved both of those issues by simply turning off my discrete graphics card,i.e. AMD Radeon graphics card and leting ubuntu work with only intel card. You can do this as follows if you hope to use earlier version of ubuntu such as 13.04,12.10,12.04 so on and so forth.\nchmod -R 705 /sys/kernel/debug \nchown -R <your_username>:<your_username> #replace <your_username> with your username\necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch \n\nAnd also I had to include the above 3rd command in /etc/rc.local file to turn the AMD card off at every startup.\nBut now, Ubuntu 13.10 supports Hybrid Graphics(AMD Radeon and intel HD graphics), means that you can now switch graphics between AMD radeon and Intel HD graphics as in windows. For this you need to install fglrx drivers as follows.\nsudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-pxpress\n\nReboot the system and you can start Catalyst Control Center either in dash or from terminal. To start in terminal, run the following command.\nsudo amdcccle\n\nRemember to run this as root, otherwise you won't be able to switch graphics. And also, unlike in windows you need to reboot ubuntu after switching to make it work.

Given your setup, installing it from Windows may be necessary, and unfortunately, there's no installation script for that scenario, so you'll need to do so manually. When you install, set up the ext4fs driver (assuming that's what you're using on the Linux /boot partition). With any luck, rEFInd will boot either Windows or GRUB, which will then boot Linux. With the ext4fs driver installed, there should also be at least one entry to boot Linux directly (bypassing GRUB), but it/they won't work until you create a /boot/refind_linux.conf file with your Linux options. You can do this by running the mkrlconf.sh script that comes with rEFInd. If you can't get into Linux via GRUB, you may be able to get the direct-boot entry to work by hitting F2 or Insert twice, which will open an editor in which you can type extra kernel options:\nro root=/dev/sda7\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Wubi 12.04 LTS won't mount I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS alongside Windows 7 32-bit as a Wubi install, but I get this:\n\nAn error occurred while mounting /tmp.

Everything works (keys, audio, full screen) but I am unable to adjust the resulting screen resolution.\nThe display setting is always at the lowest possible resulting in heavily pixelated output. Changing the game settings has no effect. I already tried a better resolution from Wine windows configuration, and from changing settings in my ~/.dosbox/dosbox.conf but these seem not to be respected.\nMy system: Ubuntu 12.10 amd64, Wine 1.4, Dosbox 0.74, Nvida Gforce 6, nvidia-current-updates 304.51.\nHow do I make Wine to call Dosbox with my custom settings for screen resolution and geometry?\n\nA: I know this tread is a little old, but I just ran into this problem myself and solved it.\nIn the install folder that wine uses to run the game, there is a DOSBOX.CONF file (mine read dosboxDK.conf, where DK was the initials of the game).

When I try to use grep in this fashion:\nservice --status-all | grep network\n\nIt still lists all the services even though I piped it into grep to restrict it to the \"network\" string only\n\n\nAfter the Fact: \nNoticed this article that explains why the command behaves this way, that's what I like about linux, there is always a good reason, but not necessary intuitive \n\n\nA: Try:\nservice --status-all |& grep network\n\nCommand-line applications can print to two text streams known as standard out (stdout) and standard error (stderr). By default, the terminal just displays the output for both identically.\nStdout is given the number 1, and stderr is given the number 2. By default, redirection operators, like >, | and < apply only to stdout, number 1.\n|& pipes both stdout and stderr together to the process on the right's standard input (stdin) stream, which makes grep work as you expected.\nI don't know why service --status-all is printing to stderr here, but in general, having a separate stderr stream is very useful, as it lets you see errors even when stdout is silenced.\n\nA: You need to redirect standard error stream (2) to standard output (1):\nservice --status-all 2>&1 | grep network\n\nOperator > normally redirects to file (e.g. 2>/tmp/file). To redirect to other stream using descriptor, it needs to be preceded with & (note no spaces between characters).\n", "Q: Command line FTP download latest files I am trying to use the command line ftp to download files from a specific date and onwards.

Make sure, the system is fully updated, as updates provide bug fixes and stability improvements. The ultimate solution, if nothing else helps, is to disable the error reporting service.

I got them working before after a lot of difficulty. The solution was to add a setting to the boot config to increase memory allowed for display. Then, I had to do a complete reinstall. After searching for a long time, I found the setting and got three screens working again. I just had to do a reinstall again. Now, I've been searching and searching. I cannot find the setting to add to the boot config to increase the amount of memory allowed for display. Does anyone happen to know what it is? Perhaps this time I will write it down and try not to lose it.\n\nA: I got this working. It is very difficult if you don't know a lot about xorg.conf files. Here is my setup: 2 nvidia cards. The main one has 4 outputs, but only 2 may be used in Linux at any time (kernel limitation apparently). The second one has 3 outputs, but I only use one. To make the three screens that I am using work, I must define all 7 outputs in xorg.conf (Why? I don't know. If I remove just one definition of one output, it fails to work.) So, in the ServerLayout section, I have:\nIdentifier \"default display\"\nScreen 0 \"Screen0\" 0 0\nScreen 1 \"Screen1\" RightOf \"Screen0\"\nScreen 2 \"Screen2\" RightOf \"Screen1\"\n...repeated through Screen 6, which is RightOf Screen5\nInputDevice \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\nInputDevice \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n\nThe Files section, Module section, and InputDevice sections don't make a difference here. I have 7 Monitor sections, all with bare descriptions, just changing the monitor number.\nIdentifier \"Monitor0\"\nVendorName \"Vendor\"\nModelName \"model\"\n\nI have 7 Device sections, all with bare descriptions. It is important to get the BusID correct. I have four of them for Card0 on PCI:1:0:0 and three for Card1 on PCI:2:0:0. They look like:\nIdentifier \"Card0\"\nDriver \"modesetting\"\nBusID \"PCI:1:0:0\"\n\nNotice, the driver is not nouveau or nvidia. Neither one of those will work (I even tried nv).\nOf course, I have 7 Screen sections. I made these the minimal settings, but I did hard-code a request for depth 24. They all look the same, just changing the number for each one:\nIdentifier \"Screen0\"\nDevice \"Card0\"\nMonitor \"Monitor0\"\nSubSection \"Display\"\n    Viewport 0 0\n    Depth 24\nEndSubSection\n\nNow, when I run, I get all three screens up. The two on the primary card are joined with xrandr. The third monitor active, but not part of the main display. So, I cannot drag windows to it from the main two screens. But, I can open a window in that display if I want to. Now, I am going to experiment with using xinerama to make all three screens one desktop instead of two on a desktop and one off on its own.\n", "Q: I am looking for software/command to control IrDA Just like hcitool controls bluetooth, I am looking for command or software(I prefer to use console so I can make scripts) to control IrDA port.

This, however, is wrong.\nWhat you should do is right click the ISO that you intend to write to a CD and click 'Burn to disk'. You will then be asked to insert a writeable CD away you go.

When I tried to partition the HDD and it kept making extra 1 MB partitions at the beginning and the end and they looked like unformatted free space. I figured out it was because of the GPT system, so I looked up some things on the net, and managed to change GPT to MBR via live CD and Gparted.\nAfter I managed to install Xubuntu, it wouldn't boot and kept throwing me back to that HUB thing where you can select the device from where you want to boot. It doesn't even get to grub, it just throws me back.\nOh, and since I installed Xubuntu, I can't enter the BIOS either.\nSo if I change to GPT, the BIOS comes back, but then I can't install Xubuntu, and if I change to MBR, I can't boot Xubuntu.\nPlease help me!\n\nA: The \"1MB partitions\" you mention were probably free space, not partitions. The one at the start was there because modern partitioning tools align partitions on 1MiB boundaries, and since both MBR and GPT use some space at the start of the disk, the first partition normally begins at 1MiB, leaving a gap of a bit under 1MiB. (Note that this is true for both MBR and GPT; it's not a GPT-specific issue.) The gap at the end is likely present because the final partition was sized as a precise multiple of 1MiB, leaving a gap between its end and the end of the disk (which likely is not sized in 1MiB boundaries). Neither of these gaps is a problem, and treating them as problems to be fixed led you to create real problems.\nSo: Switch back to GPT. If you want to dual-boot with Windows, restore it. You can then install Linux. You claim that you \"can't install Xubuntu\" after switching back to GPT, but you provide no details of what the problem is, unless you're referring to concerns over those tiny 1MiB gaps. If that's the issue, ignore it; it's not a problem. If there's something else that's preventing you from installing Linux at that point, please elaborate.

Neither were recognized during start-up.\nI'm hesitant to try to install it over my main boot (disk 0 :core) as this is a NTFS file system versus the ext4 file system that I'm trying to install Ubuntu with.\nI've now tried installing the bootloader on /dev/sda (Disk 0) -- where my Windows boot is located. I've checked to make sure BIOS is booting from this disk first, and I still have no boot options to select Windows 7 or Ubuntu. How can I diagnose this problem further?\nI'm just looking for the easiest way to get things running without affecting my Windows too much.\nAny tips/advice?\n\nA: You need to install it on the disk selected as primary boot disk in Bios: in your situation, on disk 0. This has no problem (people with only 1 disk has no other option).\nIf you prefer not modifying your current disk 0, you can install the bootloader on disk 1 and select disk 1 to boot from BIOS. You can after that (if the installer didn't do it already) update grub to find your windows installation and boot it from there too using the grub menu.\nEDIT: How to reinstall grub2 from Live CD (or USB)\nobs: I think better re-installing grub as you already installed it many times I suppose and this way we are sure it is installed in the right place.\n\n\n*\n\n*boot with the live USB\n\n*check the name of your main ubuntu system partition with sudo fdisk -l (will be /dev/sdb1 or 2 probably in your case)\n\n*mount it: sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt (obs: sdXY is what you found on previous step)\n\n*Reinstall grub2 with: sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdX (obs: do not include partition number in /dev/sdX, not sdXY, it is better not to install on a partition) - This should be /dev/sdb for disk1 and /dev/sda for disk 0 and it has to be the disk used by BIOS as primary boot.\n\n*unmount the partition: sudo umount /mnt\n\n*reboot (select in BIOS the disk you used to install grub as primary boot disk)\n\n\nIf you don't see grub menu at boot, try pressing and holding SHIFT key during boot and the menu should be displayed.\nIf you don't have windows option in menu, after booting in Ubuntu use sudo update-grub and reboot.\nMore complete documentation on grub and Ubuntu can be found at: Ubuntu Documentation - Grub2 install\n\nA: Try installing the boot loader to Disk 1, or it should be /dev/sdb in Ubuntu. On boot you must enter the bios (common keys to do  this are Delete, F11 or F12) and choose which disk to boot from. I do this myself with Win7 and Ubuntu installed. \n\nA: If your grub loader is messed up, or you can't boot to ubuntu you can chose to repair Grub 2 or use \"EasyBCD\" under windows 7 and configure it to load Grub 2, this is better if you plan to ditch ubuntu later on:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repairing Grub:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to ubuntu using live usb or live cd.\n\n*Launch FireFox and search for \"ubuntu boot-repair\".\nDirect link to ubuntu boot-repair: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair.\n\n*Follow boot-repair instructions.\n\n\n*EasyBCD under Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the non commercial edition of \"EasyBCD\" from: http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/\n\n*Install it.\n\n*Once inside EasyBCD on the left panel click on \"Add New Entry\".\n\n*On the right panel click on \"Linux\" tab.\n\n*Change type to \"Grub 2\".\n\n*Click on \"Add Entry\".\n\n*On the left panel click on \"BCD Deployment\".\n\n*On the right panel select \"Install the Windows Vista/7 Bootloader to the MBR\" and then click on \"Write MBR\".\n\n*Reboot, now you can choose between \"windows 7\" and \"NeoSmart Linux\".\n\n\n", "Q: gtkentry is editable but not work, can't write!

Some video drivers don't have a correct management of power saving. I see you have a Radeon HD 7600M Series, so you have the choice beteween the proprietary drivers (aka fglrx) or the radeon open-source drivers. Normally, both should implement power saving correctly, but maybe if you use one of them you should try the other.\nNow, the trip points. Those are the temperature points at which the fan begins to operate. Everything which is related to temperature in the system is in the folder /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/TZ0. Once you're in the directory (in a terminal), you can see the CPU temperature with the command cat temperature and also the trip points with cat trip_points. Here, you can see if there is a problem with your trip_points (if they're too high ..). You can change them, but be very careful, since a CPU without proper fan management overheats FAST.\nA last thing could be a buggy BIOS. I had this problem on my Toshiba laptop, which is that the BIOS doesn't return the right power state and the system is not able to operate the fan correctly. I had to add this at the end of my grub boot command : acpi.power_nocheck=1 (more explanations here : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2022147&page=2&p=12101889#post12101889 ).

I have set it up using a script I have written myself which is drawn from various different tutorials I have come across online (http://www.markmearns.com/sandbox/pptp.sh).\nThe service installs fine and I can connect to it using any Windows machine using built-in VPN clients, via my iPhone and Android tablet. The connection works fine and all traffic is routed over the VPN. It works quickly and never drops out.\nHowever, I have invested in a Mikrotik routerboard as I want a wifi network that just routes over the VPN. The router connects to the PPTP server, but after about 1m20s it disconnects and reconnects. The VPN server also does not exchange any data with the router.\nThe router and its settings are working fine as I can connect to commercial PPTP VPN services (like hidemyass.com) and the connection works fine and never drops out. This leads to me to believe that the router is not at fault, but my PPTP server is the problem.\nWould be grateful if anyone could shed any light on this for me. The configuration is obviously that as seen in the script I have written.\nMark.\n\nA: In my case, the cause was that the mtu size of the vpn, was bigger than the path to the host, so you can use traceroute to discover the lower mtu in the path to the host.\nthe command is:\ntraceroute <host> --mtu\nIn my case the lower MTU was 1280, so I used 1200 to make the vpn in the router configuration.\n\nA: Sounds to me like pptpd can't establish a connection and retries endless. Please check your system log. This can be done in in a terminal in real time via this command:\n    tail -f /var/log/syslog\n\n(Issue that command in terminal, then start pptpd in another terminal. Abort listing in first terminal with CRTL-C.)\nPPTP uses GRE protocol. You must open your firewall for outbound connections via protocol 47 (GRE).\n\nA: Thanks for your suggestion - turns out it was more simple than I thought - in /etc/pptpd.conf I have specified the server IP to be the server's external IP whereas I should have made it a local IP, part of the same range as the client IPs.

Clamav was not able to delete or quarantine the file.\nShould i be concerned or is this a false positive? I have scanned the same file multiple times and it picks it up as a threat each time. Also i tried googling the issue before posting and found no information.\nA point I forgot to mention, clamav picks it up as PUA.script.packed-1\n\nA: That file seems to belong to package libruby1.9.1, which should be installed when you installed Ruby.\nIf that package comes from the default repositories I guess that warning should be nothing to you worry about. If it comes from a PPA then you should take a closer look.\nTo see from where the package comes you can use apt-cache. From my system:\n$ apt-cache policy libruby1.9.1\nlibruby1.9.1:\n  Installed: (none)  <-- This shows the installed version (not installed on my case)\n  Candidate: 1.9.3.0-1ubuntu2.5\n  Version table:\n     1.9.3.0-1ubuntu2.5 0\n        500 http://pt.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security/main amd64 Packages\n     1.9.3.0-1ubuntu1 0\n        500 http://pt.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/main amd64 Packages\n\nAlso consider checking that file in an online scanner like VirusTotal. If only clamav marks it as a potencially threath probably it is a false positive.\n\nA: According to a similar post elsewhere, PUA stands for \"Potentially Unwanted Application\" and the script.packed \"usually means it was packed using something which causes AV alerts due to the method used to package the software for install\".\nIt goes on and says that\n\nHundreds of small developers get the laughable \"you gave my PC a virus email\" simply because they decide to use a packer to build their install.\n\nAs another answer here indicates, if you got the packages installed from repositories, probably this is also a false positive.\nEDIT: For websites at least, here and here, it has been ruled out as a false positive, but you can always upload the file to a service such as VirScan.org for a check with multiple antivirus engines.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Ubuntu automatically disable wireless networking when a wired connection is active? When I have Wireless enabled and plug in my Ethernet cable, the wireless connection stays active, even when the wireless and wired connections are through the same network.\nI'm aware of this question that tells how to disable it, but I want to know why this isn't Ubuntu's default behavior or why Ubuntu does not have an option in its settings to allow for this.\nThe only reason I can imagine to keep the wireless connection active is to be able to reach other LAN devices on that network, but that argument doesn't hold when the wireless and wired connections are with the same network. Another reason may be so that you don't lose precious seconds when unplugging your Ethernet, but I doubt this is a valid argument because removing Ethernet mostly means you are moving to another place and most people don't use their PC when moving.\n\nA: To put it simply, your wired network card and your wireless card are two different cards. Therefore, you have two different possible connections. Since it can connect to both of them, it doesn't assume that you want it any other way.\nAs for why one would use both network connections, there are a number of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Network stability - no loss of connection when one or the other goes out, as long as both don't go out at the same time. This also allows you to keep things that require internet access for one reason or another from being disconnected (just because you're not actively typing or surfing the Internet, doesn't mean you have zero use for the Internet while in transit).\n\n*Load balancing - advanced usage may be able to allow for things like gaming over the wired connection, and downloads over the wireless, keeping both from slowing to a crawl unless they tax the common connection point (the router, incoming connection, etc).\n\n*Maintain Internet access when using a VPN connection - VPN connections often cut off your access to the Internet. One way around this is to simply use one connection for the VPN, and the other for Internet.\n\n\nA: I agree with @Shauna, but, if you want to set your system up so that wired and wireless are never on at the same time, and, if you are command-line literate, read man 5 interfaces, especially:  \nIFACE OPTIONS\n       The following \"command\" options are available for every family and method.

I tried doing a resize-command:\nfor p in *.tga; do convert -resize 800x800 $p $p; done\n\nWith this added, it works, but I have and 800x800-movie in the end. \n\nI've already installed the following packages:\nGlut:\nsudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev\n\nffmpeg:\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\nThere was a \"curl command not found\" error. I fixed it with:\nsudo apt-get install curl\n\nThere was another \"convert: command not found\" and I fixed it with:\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\nAny idea what is missing?\n\nA: A misleading situation\nFirst of all, the so-called \"ffmpeg\" from the Ubuntu repository is not really ffmpeg from the FFmpeg project, but a fake version from a fork. It's a confusing situation. See:\n\n\n*\n\n*Who can tell me the difference and relation between ffmpeg, libav, and avconv?\n\n*The FFmpeg/Libav situation\nSecondly, this fake \"ffmpeg\" (and avconv) are terribly buggy. FFmpeg development is very active, and using a recent version of real ffmpeg will most likely resolve this issue.\nGetting the real ffmpeg\nYou have several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compile ffmpeg on Ubuntu - customizable, gives most recent code, but you must compile (not that hard and shouldn't take too long). Non-intrusive to the system.\n\n*Use a static build - easiest to use but not customizable; also non-intrusive.\n\n*Use Jon Severinsson's FFmpeg PPA - easy to enable and install but old and not customizable\n\n\nEach has their advantages and disadvantages as described above.\nUsing a static build\nYou just need to download the archive, extract it, and execute the binary. No compiling or installing is necessary:\nwget http://ffmpeg.gusari.org/static/32bit/ffmpeg.static.32bit.2013-06-19.tar.gz\ntar xzvf ffmpeg.static.32bit.2013-03-19.tar.gz\n\nNow you can use it. You can either navigate to the directory containing ffmpeg, and run (notice the preceding ./):\n./ffmpeg -i input ... output\n\n...or provide the full path to it as in:\n/home/andy/ffmpeg/ffmpeg -i input ... output\n\nChoose your $PATH\nIf you want the real ffmpeg whenever you use the ffmpeg command without having to use ./ or having to provide a full path to the binary, then place the ffmpeg binary in the bin directory in your home:\nmkdir ~/bin\nmv ffmpeg ~/bin\nhash -r\n\nNow you can just run ffmpeg and you'll be ready to encode stuff. If you want to use a different directory other than ~/bin, then you will have to add the directory to your $PATH as shown in How to add a directory to my path?\nChecking for spies\nNow using the ffmpeg command should show something like (note the \"FFmpeg developers\" phrase):\n$ ffmpeg \nffmpeg version N-54152-g730e07f Copyright (c) 2000-2013 the FFmpeg developers\n\nIf it shows the following then you'll know that you are cursed and the fake version is still being used (note the \"Libav developers\" phrase):\n$ ffmpeg\nffmpeg version 0.8.5-6:0.8.5-0ubuntu0.12.10.1, Copyright (c) 2000-2012 the Libav developers\n\n\nA: What helped me is to change the image conversion format from png to jpeg. So the makemovie.sh has to look like this:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd output_images\nfor F in $(ls *.tga); \ndo \n    convert -quality 100 $F ${F%.tga}.jpg; \n    #convert -quality 100 $F ${F%.tga}.png;\n    rm $F;\n    echo done with converting $F; \ndone\ncd ..\n\nTHISPATH=$(pwd)\nexport PATH=$PATH:${THISPATH}/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-install/bin/\n\necho Making the movie now...\n\ncd final_movie\nrm final_movie.avi\nffmpeg -i ../output_images/particles%04d.jpg -r 30 -b 30000k final_movie.avi\ncd ..\n\n", "Q: filesystem is \"read only\" even though `mount` lists it as \"rw\" I'm not sure what happened, but right now all filesystems (except for / which is on a separate drive) are \"read only\" even though mount lists them as \"rw\":\n$ mount\n/dev/sda1 on /media/Data type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,user_xattr)\n\nBut when trying to create a file, I get:\n$ cd /media/Data/; touch hello\ntouch: cannot touch `hello': Read-only file system\n\nTrying to remount as rw leads to an error:\n$ sudo mount -o remount,rw -t ext4 /dev/sda1 /media/Data\nmount: cannot remount block device /dev/sda1 read-write, is write-protected\n\nAny suggestions?

I want to replace Libreoffice with Openoffice.org o Ubuntu 12.10 with GNOME Classic.But i want to install the italian version because I'm italian.\n\nA: It is possible.\nFirst, you would need to remove LibreOffice:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge libreoffice-core libreoffice-common\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge\n\nThen, you need to download Apache OpenOffice from their website: http://www.openoffice.org/download/other.html.\nDownload the Italian \"full installation set\" for Linux Intel DEB or Linux x86-64 DEB if you are running Ubuntu 64-bit.\nThen, follow the installation instructions.

This piece of information is golden because it eliminates many possible causes.  It means that your hardware and your (kernel) drivers and the connections inside the corporate network all look fine.  This is also confirmed by the fact that the ifconfig output shows packets being sent and received and no (zero) errors, collisions, or retransmissions.  At this point I'm sure your issue is in your configuration only.\nI notice that your internal DNS server is at (non-public) IP: 10.24.2.171, this is not on your immediate subnet 10.24.5.0, you can tell this by this ifconfig output line:\ninet addr:10.24.5.50  Bcast:10.24.5.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n\nNote that your mask leaves only the last of the 4 octets as 0, meaning you're broadcasting only over the 10.24.5.x subnet.  You may not have a full route to your internal DNS server.\nThe experiment I would do now would be to try and verify the routes to your essential components:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your gateway 10.24.5.1\n\n*Your name server 10.24.2.171\n\n\nIt is essential to do these by IP since we don't yet know if your DNS server is ok and if you can talk to it.\n# first traceroute the gateway:\ntraceroute 10.24.5.1\n\nIf this fails with an error like no route to host or destination is unreachable, it is almost certain that your issue is in the routing table.  If it is successful you've just made a huge step forward because routing is a big subject by itself.\n# if successful traceroute the DNS server\ntraceroute 10.24.2.171\n\nIf this fails, your issue may be that the netmask is too restrictive.  Try to change it to 255.255.0.0. You can set this in /etc/network/interfaces by adding:\nnetmask 255.255.0.0\n\nunder eth0.\nOnce you fixed this, you would need to restart your network:\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\nHTH\n\nA: One of the problems is that resolvconf did not get configured properly. Ref: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/resolvconf/+bug/1000244. To fix this, run\n    sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\nThis, however, can't be the reason that you cannot ping other machines by IP address.\n\nA: eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 1c:c1:de:fa:cd:9f  \n      inet addr:10.24.5.50  Bcast:10.24.5.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n\n10.* interfaces often have netmask 255.0.0.0.

Type in which  (including the space at the end), and press Tab twice.\nThen you'll be prompted with something like:\nDisplay all 3734 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nPress y. You can scroll down through the list of commands by pressing Spacebar. Press q at any time to leave the list.\nThis way of viewing the list is inconvenient, because you can only move down in the list, not up. To create a file containing the list, run:\nscript ~/Desktop/command-list.txt\n\nThis will create the list in a file called command-list.txt located on your Desktop. You can change it accordingly. If you just run\nscript\n\nthen it will put it in a file called typescript in the current directory.\nThe script command records all the text in the Terminal. So after running script, type which  (with the space, as before), type Tab twice, and press y when prompted.\nNow, scroll down through the list by holding down the spacebar key. Once you get to the end of the list, you'll be back on the line where you're typing the which command. Type Ctrl+C to get a new line, then run exit. Now script is no longer recording.\nTo view the file, open it in a text editor--in Lubuntu, Leafpad; in regular Ubuntu, Gedit. (Those editors are installed by default, but of course you can install and use whatever text editor you like.)\nAs you view it, you'll see imperfections where you were prompted for More. But that shouldn't interfere with your ability to read through the file, to look up commands in it, nor to search through the file to find a particular command (or commands containing specific text).\nIf you want, you can filter out those lines. If the file is ~/Desktop/command-list.txt, you can run:\ngrep -ve --More-- ~/Desktop/command-list.txt > ~/Desktop/command-list2.txt\n\nThen command-list2.txt on the desktop won't have those lines.\n: will be the first command listed. The last command listed may vary from system to system (it depends on what software you have installed). On my system it is zsyncmake but you might not have that, or you might have a command that ranks after it alphabetically.\nIf you like, in the text editor you can manually remove text before the first command and after the last command. (It's just a few lines at the beginning and end; removing it by hand is much easier than if you had to remove all the --More-- lines by hand.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu Release Calendar, is it maintained?

Usually it's installed in ubuntu. Have a look at man logrotate (or if you do not have it installed look at the online manpage or install it with sudo apt-get install logrotate)\nfrom the manpage:\n\nlogrotate  is  designed to ease administration of systems that\n  generate\n         large numbers of log files.  It allows automatic rotation, compression,\n         removal, and mailing of log files.  Each log file may be handled daily,\n         weekly, monthly, or when it grows too large.\n\n\nA: As follow up to @D-E-N answer\nThis will find all log files in /var/log and truncate them to 0 bytes.\nfind /var/log -type f -iname '*.log' -print0 | xargs -0 truncate -s0\n\n\nA: If you want to clear all your log files, not just those in the first-level log folder, you could use:\nshopt -s globstar                  # if needed\ntruncate -s 0 /var/log/*.log       # first-level logs\ntruncate -s 0 /var/log/**/*.log    # nested folders, like /var/log/nginx/access.log\n\nNoting that if you already have logrotate running, you'll need to clear out the rotated .gz logs as well:\nfind /var/log -type f -name '*.[0-99].gz' -exec rm {} +\n\nA valid use for this could be building a VM appliance container for distribution, for example.\nYou should not need to do this as part of routine maintenance: as D-E-N quite correctly suggested, use logrotate for that.\n\nA: There's couple methods to fully truncating a file, generally applicable to most POSIX-compliant OS. Most common that you'll see with shell scripting is something like true > file.txt or : > file.txt ( and in case of bash shell, > redirection alone is sufficient ). That's due to the way how > opens files via open() or openat() syscall with O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC flags - that reads write-only OR create if filename doesn't exist, OR truncate existing filename. \nWith that in mind, we can implement something like that in C ourselves: \n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <fcntl.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv){\n    if (argc == 2){\n        int fd = open(argv[1],O_TRUNC);\n        close(fd);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nName the file that stores this code as trunc.c and compile that with gcc trunc.c -o trunc, and you have yourself a small utility that will truncate a filename argument it's provided as in trunc ./foobar.txt. Of course, this code doesn't do other checks, it only truncates first positional parameter. I'll leave it up to the readers to figure out how to deal with more than one positional parameter. On side note, there is truncate() syscall which we could use as well, and truncate a file to variable length.\nNow, if you are not a fan of C, Python might be easier for you. open() command operates on the same principle in Python - opening file for writing and truncating if filename exists. Thus we can do\npython -c 'import sys;open(sys.argv[1],\"w\").close()' passwd.copy \n\nAs for finding all .log files, that's been covered in other answers already - use * glob or extended glob in bash. There's also find -type f -name \"*.log\" , which has -exec flag for running commands (in this particular case sh -c '' to take advantage of > because > is a shell operator and not an external executable). Thus you can do\nfind /var/log -type f -name \"*.log\" -exec sh -c 'true > \"$1\"' sh {} \\;\n\nIt's also worth noting that log files in directory such as /var/log often are rotated by logrotate service, so there will be filenames such as /var/log/service.log, /var/log/service.log.1, etc , so you may want to use *.log.[1-9] pattern instead\n\nAmong other things, we can copy /dev/null into the desired file. Oddly enough, even though /dev/null is a special character  device type of file, when you copy that elsewhere the result is empty regular file, at least with GNU cp. Thus we can do\ncp /dev/null foo.txt\n\nor \ndd if=/dev/null of=foo.txt\n\nOther suggested reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*What's the difference between > and >>\n\n*Python's open function documentation\n\n*How to clean log file\n\n*Empty contents of a file\n\nA: It is good practice to rotate the logs in /var/logs to rotate with logrotate functionality but not whenever we wish to do. System logs will be printed her and they will be handy to debug any failures. \nIf it is a requirement not to use logrotate, then options can be explored. Though truncate is easy option in few flavors of unix system this command is not available readily, need to be installed.If not allowed to install the new command then below loop can be used. \nfor logfile $(ls /path/*.log)\ndo \n  cat /dev/null > $logfile\ndone\n\n", "Q: cannot install goldendict because of package dependencies I'm running 32-bit Ubuntu 12.10.

What is the easiest to do this? I am new to Linux and Ubuntu but am learning quickly, using 12.10.\nI want to have my mp3 files in the GUI be listed purely alphabetically: AaBbCc, not ABCabc as they appear now. If there's a way to make file names all one case, I'd do that. I have files for bands beginning in both upper and lower case for the same bands; thousands of them. I want the band names to appear in one group.\n\nA: From the Debian introductory tutorials:\n\nUNIX filenames are case-sensitive.\n\nSorry, you're stuck with it.\nThere are some extreme hacks you could pull with ciopfs (originally meant for Wine), but they'll affect your whole system (read: break everything). At such a point it's more productive to complain to your music app's developers.\n\nA: The LC_COLLATE environment variable determines sorting. If it is set to POSIX then files sort in a case-sensitive manner. Setting it to something human (like en_GB.UTF-8) will sort alphabetically without respect for case.\nExecute locale in a command shell to see your current settings. Set your locale by picking it when logging in to your Unity session. Set the system locale in /etc/default/locale. \nNote that if LC_COLLATE is not set, then LANG is the fallback default. You may want to set that instead. Note also that if LC_ALL is set to some value, then it will override LC_COLLATE.\n\nA: As you stated in your comment, you'd be content with making file names of mp3s all lower case. You can do this from command line with:\nrename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *.mp3\n\nRename is based on the Perl scripting language and should be installed by default on your Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How can I get rid of the GNOME volume overlay? I installed GNOME Shell a while back, but then removed it. However, even while using Unity, I still get GNOME-style volume overlays/notifications.\nHow can I get back the default Unity-style volume notification?\n\nA: As a temporary workaround, you can run the following command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure notify-osd\n\nThis appears to, almost never but still occasionally, cause notifications to completely disappear for the session.\nAlso, this command only works for the current session. The workaround survives suspends and locks but not restarts and logouts.\n", "Q: How to set up environment variable properly?

Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Its not recommended to use .profile file anymore to store user specific environment variables.\nUse ~/.pam_environment file instead.\nSee: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables\n\nA: Environment variables can be defined permanently by editing the .profile file in your home directory. Here's how:\nEdit your .profile file with a command like gedit ~/.profile.

Temperature between 60 ° C and 85 ° C, with few programs operating.\nWith Windows the machine doesn't overheat.\n\nA: I have same problem with my Lenovo T500 and Ubuntu 12.04. The only release that was working for me was 10.04. With that my laptop didn't overheat. Since that time I have always problems. It doesn't help not even jupiter or indicator-cpufreq. Problem is that is not overheating just the processor but entire laptop. When I have Windows running, my laptop is much more cooler. My opinion is that there is still some problems with kernel. The only solution for me was to put AC - powersave mode in BIOS. But this solves just the temp of processor.\n\nA: I would suggest that you use cpufrequtils to reduce the CPU frequency, specifically by setting the governor to ondemand. \nSee also: \n\n\n*\n\n*producing lot of heat and fan sound, while using ubuntu 12.04 on dell xps-l502x\n", "Q: Why are there so many \"linux-\" kernel packages on my machine, and what do they all do? In my usage of Ubuntu, I have noticed a baffling array of different Linux kernel packages.  Some of them are listed below:\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-generic\n\n*linux-headers-generic\n\n*linux-headers-generic-pae\n\n*linux-headers-x.x.xx-xx\n\n*linux-headers-x.x.xx-xx-generic\n\n*linux-image-generic\n\n*linux-image-generic-pae\n\n*linux-image-x.x.xx-xx-generic\n\n*linux-image-x.x.xx-xx-generic-pae\n\n*linux-image-extra-x.x.xx-xx-generic\n\n*linux-image-extra-x.x.xx-xx-generic-pae\nMy question is, why are there so many different kernel packages, often for the same version number (e.g., 3.5.0-24), and what are the differences between them?\nEdit to deduplicate: This question is not asking about the differences between generic, server, and virtual kernel packages; instead, it is asking about what all of those packages (as well as the ones in the list) are.\n\nA: Generally when you do an apt-get dist-upgrade it will upgrade everything that is available including your kernel. Ubuntu generally keeps 3 or 4 version of kernel (if i remember correctly) just in case the new kernel causes major issue or problems. If new kernel doesnt work well on your drivers etc, you can boot back to the older kernel. That is what it is for. You can remove the kernel using apt-get remove linux-kernel-* or using Synaptic Package Manager(which has to be installed seperately). But it would be safer to leave at least one older kernel version as backup.\n\nA: A kernel image package is related to the kernel image and modules which are loaded when your OS is booted. A header package provide files that are necessary to build out-of-tree kernel modules and/ or some other programs from source.\nlinux-image-generic\nUsually you install the linux-image-generic package. That is a meta-package that does not ship any files itself. Instead, it depends on the latest kernel version provided by Ubuntu, for example linux-image-3.8.0-19-generic. This package is needed to receive kernel updates.\nlinux-headers-generic\nA similar story holds for the linux-headers-generic package. You need to install this package if you use external kernel modules such as proprietary video drivers. The linux-generic package is a meta-package that ensures that both the linux-headers-generic and linux-image-generic packages are installed.\n-generic-pae\nThis is a variant of the -generic packages. See What's the meaning of \"-pae\" at the end of kernel version?\nlinux-image-extra-*\nThis package was introduced with Ubuntu 12.10 and provides additional kernel modules (drivers). See What is the linux-image-extra package for and do I need it?.\nWhy multiple linux packages with the different version numbers?\nThe kernel is a critical piece of your system. Newer kernel versions may introduce a bug that make you unable to start your system successfully. With multiple kernels installed simultaneously, you can change the kernel version in the boot menu.\n", "Q: unable to get windows 8 comptuer to boot into live CD ubuntu 12.10 I have an Asus X401A, brand new with Windows 8 on it.

I burned a live CD Ubuntu 12.10, but when I restart the computer with the live CD inside the dvd drive, nothing happens, asus just boots into Windows. Why?\n\nA: You're going to get a ton of the same answers for that question. My guess, as is everyone elses, is that you have to go into your system's bios and change the boot order so that dvd/optical drives are higher than harddrives.\nWindows 8 replaces bios with uefi.

It just say's a error has occurred Any opinion's?\n\nA: It's advisable to install FLASH from Adobe on your system for watching YT-video's. \nOpen the softwarecenter and typ in the search-field: restricted extra's\ninstall the pack for Ubuntu (not Xubuntu or Kubuntu !!) this will deliver you automatically the desired FLASH-player. \nUpdates for FLASH come with the updatemanager, so no worry's there. Only updates , not new versions of Flash since Adobe stopped making new versions for Linux in general. (doesn't matter, all YouTube video's work fine with this version Adobe releases)\nJAVA is not used for watching YouTube-video's, so there you are wrong. \nSome YouTube video's however come already in HTML5, what is to become the new standard. \nSucces ! \nYou can also install Chromium from the softwarecenter, if desired. \n", "Q: Is /etc/sudoers file only suppose to have read only permissions? -r--r-----   1 root root     723 Jan 31  2012 sudoers\n\nMy dist-update frequently fails.\nAt boot my system frequently asks for file system check.

It's usually easier to install Windows first.  Fortunately its not difficult to fix.  Take a look here \nThe easiest way is \n\n\n*\n\n*Insert your Ubuntu CD, reboot your computer and set it to boot from CD in the BIOS and boot into a live session. You can also use a LiveUSB if you have created one in the past.\n\n*Install and run Boot-Repair\n\n*Click \"Recommended Repair\".\n\n*Now reboot your system. The usual GRUB boot menu should appear. If it does not, hold Left Shift while booting. You will be able to choose between Ubuntu and Windows. \n\nA: There are two possible answers:\n1) The easy answer is just reinstall Ubuntu. Backup the data of your Linux partition onto a thumb drive and \"nuke and pave\" that is to say format and install right over top of the old Linux.\n2) A bit more tricky. You'll want to install a Linux boot option into your boot.ini file in windows.

Unnecessary packages filling up the space.\nThe following command will remove all automatically installed packages, which aren't required any more.

You may investigate the current situation with:\ndpkg -l \"linux*{tools}*\" |grep ^.i\n\nRemove any kernel versions you doesn't need any more\n4. Hidden storage\nOther mounted partitions may hide used storage. To investigate this mount the root file system temporary on a second location:\nmkdir /tmp/2ndRoot\nmount /dev/sda1 /tmp/2ndRoot\n\nNow look on every directory, that is normally hidden by another mount, e.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*tmp\n\n*home \n\n*run\n\n*var\n\n*usr/local\nand in your case also: \n\n*sites\n\n\nCaveat\nDon`t forget to control at the end the consistency of your installation with:\napt-get install -f\n\nNotes\nReserved storage\n/dev/sda1       5.7G  5.4G     0 100% /\n\nThe output shows that you have still some space, but it seems to be reserved for root.\nThe good point is that your system functionality is currently still be given.  \nBut you should fix the problem soon.\nSpace consumption of ubuntu 12.04\nTo have only 5.7 Gb for an ubuntu installation seems to be a bit too little.\nYou should remove some unessential software packages.\nMy current installations have 10-14 Gb for the root and binary (aka /usr) partitions.\n\nA: You made the filesystem too small.\nUnless you REALLY know what you are doing, and are trying to build a tiny appliance, either grow the root filesystem, or rebuilt the system with a more sane value.\nI usually start with a minimum of a 16gb disk when building an Ubuntu VM.  If you want to keep things simple and not have to mess with growing devices, 32gb might be a good place to start... I tend to be conservative with disk space, knowing I can grow it later if needed.\nDocumentation recommends a absolute minimum of 8gb for root, but experience tells me that an inexperienced user should start with more.\nHere is some relevant documentation:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DiskSpace#:~:text=Description%3A%20the%20root%20partition%20contains,it%20at%20least%2015%20GB.\n\nA: Another solution would be to use ncdu, eg:\nsudo ncdu -x /\n\nWhere / is the partition/drive you wanna check.\nFor my example, the result is\n    4,0GiB [##########] /usr\n  579,3MiB [#         ] /root\n  487,4MiB [#         ] /opt\n   41,7MiB [          ] /lib\n   22,7MiB [          ] /sbin\n   21,2MiB [          ] /boot\n   18,6MiB [          ] /etc\n    9,1MiB [          ] /bin\n    3,6MiB [          ]  core\n  260,0KiB [          ] /build\n   88,0KiB [          ] /tmp\ne  16,0KiB [          ] /lost+found\n    8,0KiB [          ] /media\n    4,0KiB [          ] /lib64\ne   4,0KiB [          ] /srv\ne   4,0KiB [          ] /mnt\n>   0,0  B [          ] /var\n>   0,0  B [          ] /sys\n>   0,0  B [          ] /run\n>   0,0  B [          ] /proc\n>   0,0  B [          ] /ovhbackup\n>   0,0  B [          ] /home\n>   0,0  B [          ] /dev\n\nThen you can navigate through the folders using your keyboard arrows and simply press the D key to delete a folder/file.\nncdu can be installed from the apt packaging tool on Debian based systems:\nsudo apt install ncdu\n\n\nA: Lubuntu users ?\n/home/XXX/.cache/lxsession/run.log\n\nwas over 85G of space, they even know about it! \n\nA: Check the \"/home/yourname/.local/share/Trash\" folder with \"du\" command (see above):\nI was having this same problem and used the trick mickael posted above to concisely print out disk usage. I found that if you delete things using the window manager and you don't have sufficient permissions at the time you do it, the files you thought you deleted (both by command line using \"rm\" and \"apt autoremove --purge\", and by emptying trash bin) may have ended up in the \".local/share/____\" of the root partition.\n\"Filesystem\" in the left pane of the window manager was saying nearly full of the 50gb I set aside for installation files for Ubuntu/Mint. Turns out the lectures I mistakenly copied to this partition weren't deleted when I moved them to the partition I originally meant to copy them to. It is now 36gb free which makes way more sense (mine is large mainly because I keep HD graphics on this partition too for quick previewing of large sets of images).\nDefinitely make sure you get a good understanding of permissions before you delete / manage your files or may wind up having things you thought were deleted crowding your SSD.\nAs a side note, my 16gb of ram was loading on boot at 92% while my root partition was housing said deleted files, and staying there steadily because of this same issue too. The ram is used to cache items on the disk to vastly improve linux's performance. The operating system will assume you're using the installation partition correctly (which was not the case for me in this instance) so it will cache what it can to accelerate system responsiveness. Now this is only a point of note, since disk caching doesn't reserve that space in memory; it would yield the used ram space to other programs that need it when they request it (that's just how disk caching works), but it's a needless use of resources loading 14.5gb of deleted files into ram every time I booted.\nHope it helps!

Other wise you will get error about root system.\nSecondly, choose booloader location as your hard disk (probably sda) not your usb (sdb). This options is located in the same screen where partition are shown (just after something else)\nIf it fails again after installation,boot with live disk (Try ubuntu) & use boot-repair\n\nA: Most likely what you did was select a partition for your bootloader that was not the active partition or the mbr. Since we can not be sure exactly what you did we'll just do it again. Boot to your usb drive and install Ubuntu. Be careful to set Grub (the bootloader) to the drive (probably sda) do not set it to sda1, sda2 or anything with a number. It sounds like you only have one hard drive on this computer. That's good. If you happen to have two or more drives be sure you install your bootloader to the drive you boot from, or you'll have to change the bios to reflect your new boot-drive.

Bash always reads at least one complete\n  line of input before executing any of the commands on that line. Aliases are expanded when a command is read, not when it\n  is executed. Therefore, an alias definition appearing on the same line as another command does not take effect until the\n  next line of input is read. The commands following the alias definition on that line are not affected by the new alias.\n  This behavior is also an issue when functions are executed. Aliases are expanded when a function definition is read, not\n  when the function is executed, because a function definition is itself a compound command. As a consequence, aliases\n  defined in a function are not available until after that function is executed. To be safe, always put alias definitions on\n  a separate line, and do not use alias in compound commands.\n\n\nA: You can alias it properly if you substitute the backslash \\ with the proper string code \\\\. The right alias would be:\nalias cccc=\"find {,/usr}/{,s}bin -printf '%f\\\\0' | xargs -0 whatis | sort | less\"\n\n", "Q: PDF file renaming according to metadata? Is there something I can use that renames PDF files according to their content? Basically an equivalent of http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=27620 in Ubuntu.\n\nA: This is very easy to achieve with exiftool.\nFor instance, the following command would rename all files in the current directory to <title>.extension:\nexiftool '-filename<$title.%e' .\n\nYou can install exiftool on Ubuntu with:\nsudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl\n\n\nPlease consult the official documentation for more information:\nhttp://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/filename.html\n\nA: If you are comfortable with python you could use the script on http://blog.matt-swain.com/post/25650072381/a-lightweight-xmp-parser-for-extracting-pdf-metadata-in. I have just tested the scripts he provides (for a start, you can pip install pdfminer) and they work nicely. The result they give is something along the lines of:\n[{'ModDate': \"D:20050422142709+02'00'\", 'CreationDate': \"D:20050422142709+02'00'\", 'Producer': 'Mac OS X 10.3.8 Quartz PDFContext', 'Creator': 'Word'}]\n\nThat output you could use to rename your files.\n\nA: There is another alternative. You could sudo apt-get install pdftk. With that library you can run a command like pdftk myfile.pdf dump_data which results in something in a set of info and value:\nInfoKey: Creator\nInfoValue: Word\nInfoKey: Producer\nInfoValue: Mac OS X 10.3.8 Quartz PDFContext\nInfoKey: ModDate\nInfoValue: D:20050422142709+02'00'\nInfoKey: CreationDate\nInfoValue: D:20050422142709+02'00'\nPdfID0: d7af25c8df737276d8d6b5de49d94d92\nPdfID1: d7af25c8df737276d8d6b5de49d94d92\nNumberOfPages: 58\n\nAgain you could use that information in a renaming script. If feel the latter is something best customized because it depends on whether you just want the title, title-author, or something else.\nSource\n\nA: If you're looking for an out-of-the-box solution and your PDFs are academic in nature, you might try Zotero, the Firefox plugin.\nUnfortunately this takes several steps to do, each of which can be a bit slow if you are trying to work with a lot of PDFs at once: \n\n\n*\n\n*Drag and drop your PDFs into Zotero.\n\n*Right-click them to retrieve the metadata (and automatically download the bibliographic information).\n\n*If the files were recognized correctly, right-click them again to automatically rename.\n\n*Export or directly move the renamed files where you want them.\n\n\nThe answer to a similar question on Superusers shows how to do the same thing using Mendeley. In Zotero this process can be further automated using Zotfile. Finally, here is an extensive list of potentially useful tools along these lines. \n\nA: If you are in search of a GUI solution KRename  is a very powerful renaming tool, able to handle your requirements.\n\nto install:\nsudo apt install krename \n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04: WiFi not working after suspension here is my configuration:\n- S.O.: Ubuntu 12.04\n- Kernel: 3.5.0-25\n- Laptop: Sony Vaio VGN-FZ21E\n- WiFi car: Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan]\n- driver: iwl3945\nAfter suspension my WiFi isn't working, even restarting network or reloading modules.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm using a custom theme called Twilight for Gedit and I'm trying to change some of the colors of the theme. \nI went to: /home/user/.local/share/gedit/twilight.xml\nThe default color I'm trying to change is:\n<color name=\"steelblue3\" value=\"#4f94cd\"/>\n\nto\n<color name=\"moon_grey\" value=\"#f7f7f7\">\n\nThe code I'm changing:\n<style name=\"bracket-match\" background=\"steelblue3\"/>\n\nTo this:\n<style name=\"bracket-match\" background=\"moon_grey\"/>\n\nBut after I do use the line above, nothing happens.

When using task switching in the default graphical mode of Ubuntu 12.04, if they are multiple windows of the same kind, eg. multiple Terminal windows, you can see them all together and select which one you want.\n\nMy problem is that the order of these windows is constantly changed. It follows the \"last used\" order.\nI want them in a fix order always; how can I do it?\n\nA: Rather than changing the unity codebase, you might consider using desktops to arrive at your desired result. \nExample using Compiz Desktop Cube in CompizConfigSettingsManager\nOpen CompizConfigSettingsManager (ccsm) and change settings to match the following:\n\n\nOpen terminal 1 \nUse the keyboard shortcut CTRL-ALT--> (right arrow) to go to the next desktop to the right.\nOpen terminal 2\nUse the keyboard shortcut CTRL-ALT--> (right arrow) to go to the next desktop to the right again.\nOpen terminal 3\nUse the keyboard shortcut CTRL-ALT-<- (left arrow) to go to the previous desktop containing terminal 2 (or twice to get back to terminal 1)\nAnother Option\nUse the Viewport manager in CompizConfig SettingManager and assign a key combination to go directly to the desktop of your choices\nNote: Thus far I've only been able to get 10 to work although 12 should be possible with this method.\n\nUpdate: based on concerns expressed in comments:\nSimply Right Click on gedit title bar and choose always on visible workspace...\nAnother Option:\nRather than opening seperate terminals (or workspaces) for your numerous activities you can also use  tabs in gnome terminal. Shortcut keys for tab switching are available from terminal preferences. See below:\n\n\nA: Another option, if your desktop is large enough, is to set some windows to \"always on top\" and arrange them around so that you can switch using the mouse. It's a kludge... but I sometimes find it useful when working with multiple windows of the same type.\nYet another is to define several terminal profiles with different color schemes and use a different one for each terminal... it would make them easy to identify.\nYeah, this one is a workaround too.\n\nA: I think that you can achieve this by modifying the source code of Unity 7. Just follow the steps described on the developer site but before starting the building process open: ./trunk/plugins/unityshell/src/unityshell.cpp and take a look at SetUpAndShowSwitcher function:\nvoid UnityScreen::SetUpAndShowSwitcher(switcher::ShowMode show_mode)\n{\n  RaiseInputWindows();\n\n  if (!optionGetAltTabBiasViewport())\n  {\n    if (show_mode == switcher::ShowMode::CURRENT_VIEWPORT)\n      show_mode = switcher::ShowMode::ALL;\n    else\n      show_mode = switcher::ShowMode::CURRENT_VIEWPORT;\n  }\n\n  auto results = launcher_controller_->GetAltTabIcons(show_mode == switcher::ShowMode::CURRENT_VIEWPORT,\n                                                      switcher_controller_->show_desktop_disabled());\n\n  if (switcher_controller_->CanShowSwitcher(results))\n    switcher_controller_->Show(show_mode, switcher::SortMode::FOCUS_ORDER, results);\n}\n\nHere you can clearly see that this is exactly the function what we were looking for. The upper part is responsible for the switching of the viewport modes:\n\nThis toggling appears each time we move into a group of Apps or if we move out of the group. optionGetAltTabBiasViewport indicates when this happens.\nThen GetAltTabIcons is involved in order to get the right icons. And finally the Show function with the SortMode::FOCUS_ORDER is called to display our sorted icons. SortMode is an enum:\nenum class SortMode\n{\n  LAUNCHER_ORDER,\n  FOCUS_ORDER,\n};\n\nand changing FOCUS_ORDER to LAUNCHER_ORDER should solve your problem. You could insert an additional if statement before calling Show to prevent launcher order sorting in ShowMode::ALL case.\nPlease note that the source code of Unity 8 looks completely different. So this solution may work for Unity 7 only. After half an hour fixing missing dependencies and after another hour fighting with cmake I decided not to ruin my system and try it out in VM tomorrow ;)\n", "Q: Managing Software Sources I'm using Lubuntu 12.04.\nI cannot add or remove repositories neither by using Software Sources menu item (which usually crashes) nor by using Synaptic Package Manager via Settings > Repositories option.\nThis is possibly due to having installed 'Debian Package Search' from *buntu-software-center, after which I ran sudo apt-file update. Should I run sudo apt-file purge ? This sounds drastic!\nI can manage repositories via sudo add-apt-repository. \n\nA: You can add or remove sources manually.\nOpen /etc/apt/sources.list and add or remove the source(s).\nShortcut to add sources echo <source> >> /etc/apt/sources.list\nAfter adding or deleting sources you should run apt-get updade && apt-get upgrade\nMore information here.\n", "Q: Remove Settings Access For Students Running Ubuntu 12 on a class set of netbooks and looking to block SETTINGS access to the standard user (student) Any suggestions?\nThanks,\n\nA: Anything a logged-in user can do using the settings panel, s/he can do by editing files on the file system.\nIn a class situation, with many students logging in through one account, the better way is to reset the home directory of the student account after every logout.\nSet up a template home directory and overwrite /home/student at the appropriate moment. Students will be free to change whatever setting they want for the duration of their session, but the next user will have an entirely standard environment again.\nOh and pick a seriously long password for the administrator user. ;-)\n", "Q: Vstfpd and many accounts creation: is there a howto? I've been googling around and didn't find valuable answer.\nI have 98 students. I want to create, for each student a directory where they can upload their own files.\nUnless I'm wrong, it seems I'll have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a student account\n\n*change its password to a strong one\n\n*do this again 98 times!\n\n\nI would like:\n1 - to avoid if possible creating accounts i.e. just configuring vsftp properly and avoid useradd (= avoid the step # 6 of this tutorial)\n2 - find a way to change all those students passwords to strong ones, (and of course be able to print them to mail them individually).\n\nA: This is a template to get the ball rolling. It's a perl script that prints out commands so it will not do anything until you decide to hilight the commands and cut/paste it back into the console.\nIt does the hard work of generating to user accounts, sets passwords and optionally create or not create a homedirectory. The trick is when creating passwords for the adduser command it needs to be in crypt3 format. So if you run this script...\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse strict;         \n\nmy $SALT=\"jhgk^djfh*gkdh(jghkdhj786876erg98rhj44\";\nmy $user=\"student\";\nmy $pass=\"password\";\nmy $encrypted;\nmy $studno=1;\nmy $studentstogenerate=20;\n\nfor ($studno;$studno<$studentstogenerate;$studno++) {\n $pass='p'.int(rand(100000000000000));\n $encrypted=crypt($pass, $SALT); \n print \"sudo useradd -p '$encrypted'  $user$studno --no-create-home -G ftpgroup # actual pass ($pass)\\n\";\n}\n\nIt will generate...\nsudo useradd -p 'jhVU3sDajDruY'  student1 --no-create-home -G ftpgroup # actual pass (p67228866189634)\nsudo useradd -p 'jhViMGmmQ7d4.'  student2 --no-create-home -G ftpgroup # actual pass (p20494616343373)\nsudo useradd -p 'jhMr3VKBG2.ow'  student3 --no-create-home -G ftpgroup # actual pass (p13933001113231)\nsudo useradd -p 'jhqPnvxZCcQTg'  student4 --no-create-home -G ftpgroup # actual pass (p45579091049416)\nsudo useradd -p 'jhWqVroWUraWk'  student5 --no-create-home -G ftpgroup # actual pass (p35233656259977)\nsudo useradd -p 'jhlWOWyt0AKYE'  student6 --no-create-home -G ftpgroup # actual pass (p39944882363487)\nsudo useradd -p 'jhJd1AVEU/FE6'  student7 --no-create-home -G ftpgroup # actual pass (p71192849790380)\nsudo useradd -p 'jh1I6aDAkq3iA'  student8 --no-create-home -G ftpgroup # actual pass (p41868457411791)\n\nAs it uses a random number generator everytime you run it the password will be different.\nSo in this case student1 has a password of p67228866189634\nYou can play with this script to generate different output by chnaging the variables. Should be easy enough even if you don't program in perl.\nNote: I have added the students to ftpgoup which you might need to change based on the group you used.\n", "Q: Shortcut keys to create Empty Text Document in Nautilus?

You can find them in the \"Additional Drivers\" tab of the \"Software Sources\" app. If you don't see any Nvidia drivers listed, make sure you have the \"Proprietary drivers for devices (restricted)\" box checked in the \"Ubuntu Software\" tab and your system is up to date (search \"update\" in the Unity dash and run the software updater).\nOnce you've installed the Nvidia drivers, you no longer use the built-in display manager. Instead, you use Nvidia's. Just search for \"Nvidia\" and you'll find it. I don't remember the section name off hand, but it says something along the lines of \"X Server Configuration,\" and when you go to it, it will look similar to the built-in display manager (showing two screens and allowing you to adjust their position, resolution, and whatnot).

I am slowly adopting Ubuntu as my primary OS, and Open Source software for my applications. Libre Office is fine for me, GIMP will take a steep learning curve to replace Photoshop, Tax Act has an online version that imports last year's Win Desptop tax filing, ThunderBird is great, Chromium easily replaces Chrome, there are others with which I've had marginal success.  I am pretty stumped by my iphone, iCloud synch for pictures, and transfering music. I'm keeping my Win 7 installation in tact for just a few applications while I learn and adopt to Linux / Ubuntu. \nIs there a relatively straight forward method for my iPhone 4 (ios 6.1.2) to work with my desktop running Ubuntu 12.10 - gnome session fallback?\n\nA: Functionality is very limited for iPhone users on Ubuntu, But there are some workarounds.\nFor your images I would suggest syncing them with dropbox, you can set your phone up to do this automagically, (when the app is open), thus automagically syncing them to your computer.\nFor Music: This directions are for the iPod but I imagine the steps will be the same for iPhone.\nConnect the iPod to your computer using the iPod's USB cable. It may take a few seconds for the computer to recognize the iPod. Note than Ubuntu distributions prior to 10.04 do not recognize the iPod as an MP3 player, but rather, as a storage device.\n2\nUbuntu automatically loads the Music Player application.\n3\nClick on \"Music\" in the Music Player window. Select \"Import File\" from the drop-down menu to import music into your library.\n4\nClick the music on your computer that you want to add to your iPod and drag it to the iPod’s icon. This icon has your iPod’s name on it under the Devices heading. Each time you drag and drop music on the icon, your iPod will update.\n5\nClose out of Music Player when you are finished loading music on your iPod. Right-click the iPod icon on your desktop and click \"Eject.\" Wait for Ubuntu to tell you that the iPod has been disconnected. Unplug the iPod from the computer and enjoy your music.\nRead more: How to Put Music on Your iPod Using Ubuntu | eHow.com http://www.ehow.com/how_2113536_put-music-ipod-using-ubuntu.html#ixzz2NL0wOiAR\n\nA: As listed in the libimobiledevice website , functionality with iOS devices is limited and varies by feature. In particular, Music synchronization will not work with an up-to-date iPhone. This has nothing to do with the particular desktop setup you have, but with the libraries used to sync with your iPhone.\nOther things might or might not work (look at the table on the website for details).\n", "Q: Replacing dots (.) in sed So actual question is - does anyone have an idea how to remove M-BM- special character without risking losing other characters?\nI have a string of text:     \n\" . . .\"\n\nthat is\nspace dot space dot space dot\n\nI am trying to replace all occurence of this string in text file to\n\"...\"\n\nthat is \ndot dot dot\n\nI was trying to do with sed:\nsed -r 's:\\s\\.\\s\\.\\s\\.:...:g' -i sed-dots\n\nUnfortunately, it does not change input file even a bit.\nFile: https://www.dropbox.com/s/46zmiruy3ln85a1/sed-dots\nWhen I try to do replace same string in text editor (I use geany) it is found and replaced properly.\nOnly reason I can think of is that some (or all) of those spaces are not really spaces, but some special character.\nDoes anyone have idea how to find and replace that string with sed (or any other command line tool)? Please test your idea on my file, as problem is not as obvious as it might seem to be - this is why I asked about it.\nAfter using cat -A myfile it seems problem that those spaces are not spaces, but M-BM- special character. Using any symbol . suggested for search is not a good idea as there is risk some other characters will be removed.\n\nA: First I would start by testing with echo and piping that into sed, than using a real file. Secondly, you can use a {n} in the extended regex model to denote multiples and limits.\nYou were pretty much there but your regex expected a leading space. \n$ echo 'cheese . . . muffins' | sed -r 's/(\\s?\\.){3}/ dot dot dot/g'\ncheese dot dot dot muffins\n\nNote the \\s? is still greedy enough to ruin the output, so I've added a space to the output. You might not want that. I've also made the space optional, so it'll match all of the following:\n...\n. ..\n.. .\n. . .\n . . . \n\nJust remove the optional ? flag.\n\nGiven your problem with unicode (in the comments) you can force the data to its ASCII equivalence with iconv and then sed it:\n$ iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii//translit sed-dots | sed -r 's/(\\s?\\.){3}/ dot dot dot/g'\nLorem ipsum dot dot dot\nSome dot dot dot more text\n\n\nA: Try the following to replace all \". \" to \".\"\nsed -r 's/\\. /\\./g' -i sed-dots\n\nBut for \". . .\" to \"...\"\nsed -r 's/\\. \\. \\./\\.\\.\\./g' -i sed-dots\n\n\nA: I could use your file when I ran it through:\ntr '\\240' ' ' < sed-dots.txt > sed-dots.new\n\n\nThis worked without a conversion step:\nsed 's/[[:blank:]]\\.[[:blank:]]\\.[[:blank:]]\\./.../g' sed-dots.txt\n\n", "Q: How can I install ruby 1.8.7? I am not ruby guy, but I have good experience with apache and php, but I find it really difficult to setup ruby 1.8.7, cause I find a lot of ways to do the same and I am pretty much confused. I want to install open source project management system fedena in ubuntu 12.10 which required ruby 1.8.7 to run.\n\nA: In ubuntu 12.10 the ruby1.8 package gives you ruby 1.8.7-p358. The binary it installs is compatible with fedena.\nI would also suggest looking into something like rvm in order to maintain different versions of rubies. If you don't need something quite as heavy as rvm you could try rbenv which is a similar idea but allows you to install rubies using the ruby-build plugin or any other method you choose such as source or apt-get.  It just makes sure that your projects use the ruby you want it to using a file in the source directory.  If you want to go even lighter weight than rbenv there is one more potential alternative you can check out called chruby. It is a similar idea to rbenv but implements it in a slightly different way.\nMy first suggestion is the only pure apt-get solution but I would suggest using at least chruby to make sure projects use the correct ruby once you have multiple installed.\nEdit:\nSee @berkes comment about using symlinks for default ruby. If you don't like rbenv, rvm, or chruby it can be a great alternative allowing you to quickly change the system rubies.  The command update-alternatives is a great way to automate this process. Add an alternative using the command:\nsudo update-alternatives --set ruby /path/to/ruby\n\nYou can also check which alternatives are configured and selected using:\nsudo update-alternatives --config ruby\n\n", "Q: Lenovo X200s volume buttons stopped working on Ubuntu 12.04 I have Lenovo X200s and I have been using Ubuntu on it for several years now, it is running Ubuntu 12.04 since it was released in April 2012.\nEverything was fine until a week or so ago volume buttons stopped working correctly.\nI think that this error appeared after I ran updates for Precise, but I am not sure. Previously I was able to adjust sound output volume and Ubuntu was showing the output volume change on upper right corner, under the sound icon, everything was working fine.\nThe behavior I am getting now is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mute button works as expected - it turns off any sound. Pressing any of volume buttons actually turns the sound on, but the volume will not change as I press any of those buttons repeatedly. Pressing mute button and any of volume-up or volume-down buttons will turn the sound on and off, which means that physical buttons are working correctly.\n\n*When I turn the sound on and I hear the sound of some youtube videos or whatever, the sound volume icon on top right corner of the screen still shows as if it was muted and it does not allow me to adjust the volume with that slider.\n\nA: Maybe this helps: pull off the power brick, remove the battery, press on/off for at least ten seconds, reassamble, turn on.\nBtw: the similar problem I had definitely was a thinkpad bug, not an ubuntu bug. Happens with windows aswell.\n", "Q: How can I identify the name of the last played xscreensaver? Is there a way to identify the name of which screensaver was last playing an xscreensaver session? Is there a log or of which screensaver played last in xscreensaver, in a scriptfile or on the system somewhere? If, for example, you have it set to cycle or random?\n\nA: Indeed, there is a way to show this information via a log, and it is usually used for debugging purposes. Your user session, whether it is Gnome or Xfce, will usually auto-load xscreensaver with the options xscreensaver -no-splash &, as it does in Xfce, for example, using the file /etc/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc. \nTemporary Setting\nSo if you want to load up xscreensaver with different options just for that session (until you log out), you can kill any running instances with\nkillall xscreensaver \n\nand then launch it with the appropriate new parameters:\nxscreensaver -verbose -no-splash -log /home/$USER/xscreen2.log &\n\nThis command launches the xscreensaver daemon process with the verbose option so that it reports on exactly what it does, which is then saved in the specified log.\nFor this experiment, run xscreensaver-demo to set the screensaver options to random, and choose very low 'blank after' and 'cycle after' values in the settings. Now  when the timeout you specified is reached, xscreensaver will start and write to the log. (The settings changed by xscreensaver-demo are saved in ~/.xscreensaver.)\nMore 'permanent' setting (example used is for Xfce)\nIf you want xscreensaver to always save its data to a log (passwords used to unlock screens are not copied to the log), first copy xfce4's systemwide xinitrc to your home folder:\ncp /etc/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc $HOME/.config/xfce4/xinitrc\n\nNow change the two occurences of \nxscreensaver -no-splash &\n\nat around lines 199 and 208 (in my version) to\nxscreensaver -verbose -no-splash -log /home/$USER/xscreen1.log &\n\nIf you want to revert to the default setting, just change the commands back in the file or delete $HOME/.config/xfce4/xinitrc so that no custom xfce4 xinitrc settings are applied on login.\n(You will have to logout and login for this setting to take effect)\nA sample of the log created contains just what you were looking for: a way of identifying which screensavers were playing in a random session (I have shortened the log as it is extremely verbose)\nxscreensaver 5.15, copyright (c) 1991-2008 by Jamie Zawinski <jwz@jwz.org>.\nxscreensaver: 00:55:14: 0: spawning \"glschool -root\" in pid 8392.\nxscreensaver: 00:56:14: 0: killing pid 8392 (glschool)\nxscreensaver: 00:56:14: 0: visual 0x21 (TrueColor,   depth: 24, cmap: 256)\nxscreensaver: 00:56:14: 0: saver window is 0x2e0000c.\nxscreensaver: 00:56:14: 0: destroyed old saver window 0x2e00009.\nxscreensaver: 00:56:14: 0: spawning \"glmatrix -root\" in pid 8393.\nxscreensaver: 00:56:14: 0: child pid 8392 (glschool) terminated with signal 15.\nxscreensaver: 00:57:14: 0: killing pid 8393 (glmatrix)\nxscreensaver: 00:57:14: 0: visual 0x21 (TrueColor,   depth: 24, cmap: 256)\nxscreensaver: 00:57:14: 0: saver window is 0x2e0000f.\nxscreensaver: 00:57:14: 0: destroyed old saver window 0x2e0000c.\nxscreensaver: 00:57:14: 0: child pid 8393 (glmatrix) terminated with signal 15.\nxscreensaver: 00:57:14: 0: spawning \"fiberlamp -root\" in pid 8395.\nxscreensaver: 00:58:14: 0: killing pid 8395 (fiberlamp)\nxscreensaver: 00:58:14: 0: child pid 8395 (fiberlamp) terminated with signal 15.\nxscreensaver: 00:58:14: 0: visual 0x21 (TrueColor,   depth: 24, cmap: 256)\nxscreensaver: 00:58:14: 0: saver window is 0x2e00012.\nxscreensaver: 00:58:14: 0: destroyed old saver window 0x2e0000f.\nxscreensaver: 00:58:14: 0: spawning \"fuzzyflakes -root\" in pid 8396.\n\nFor more information, see man xscreensaver, man xscreensaver-demo, and the Ubuntu manpages online.\n", "Q: Problems runnung VirtualBox in Ubuntu 12.10 I am trying to start a VM using VirtualBox, however I get the following errors.\n\n\nI have read many pages on this error (some on this forum) but none of the suggested fixes I have found seem to work.

It is fully customisable; all options are described in the script. This script is based off a combination of my clock.lua script and my rings.lua script.\n\nIMPORTANT: if you are using the 'cpu' function, it will cause a segmentation fault if it tries to draw a ring straight away. The if statement on line 145 uses a delay to make sure that this doesn't happen. It calculates the length of the delay by the number of updates since Conky started. Generally, a value of 5s is long enough, so if you update Conky every 1s, use update_num>5 in that if statement (the default). If you only update Conky every 2s, you should change it to update_num>3; conversely if you update Conky every 0.5s, you should use update_num>10. ALSO, if you change your Conky, is it best to use \"killall conky; conky\" to update it, otherwise the update_num will not be reset and you will get an error.\n\nTo call this script in Conky, use the following (assuming that you save this script to ~/scripts/rings.lua):\n    lua_load ~/scripts/clock_rings.lua\n    lua_draw_hook_pre clock_rings\n\nChangelog:\n+ v1.0 -- Original release (30.09.2009)\n   v1.1p -- Jpope edit londonali1010 (05.10.2009)\n*v 2011mint -- reEdit despot77 (18.02.2011)\n]]\n\nsettings_table = {\n    {\n        -- Edit this table to customise your rings.\n        -- You can create more rings simply by adding more elements to settings_table.\n        -- \"name\" is the type of stat to display; you can choose from 'cpu', 'memperc', 'fs_used_perc', 'battery_used_perc'.\n        name='time',\n        -- \"arg\" is the argument to the stat type, e.g. if in Conky you would write ${cpu cpu0}, 'cpu0' would be the argument.

So, regardless of the version of nmap it can't scan non-open ports.  Something bound to your localhost (127.0.0.1) just can't be scanned from externally.\n\nA: Nmap uses it's own \"/etc/service\" file, for reference to additional ports.\nOn Ubuntu it is located at /usr/share/nmap/nmap-services.

How can I prevent users accessing anything but their own home directory?\nFor example, I have a NTFS partition mounted under /media/ntfs, so if the user logs in through ssh he can reach this partition. How can I disable the users to cd out from their home directory?\n\nA: To complete the answer of @Willman, you can simply do this :\nFirst, for users to not list all users home directories :\nchmod 701 /home\n\nBut if you know the path of a user's home directory, you can still access it with cd.\nSo you could just chmod 750 all of your already-created users directories.\nBut what we want here is to prevent any new user's home directory to have a 755 permission on it. There is a file responsible of the configuration of new users : /etc/adduser.conf :\nJust change DIR_MODE=0755 to DIR_MODE=0750\n\nA: In addition to restricting access to other directories, particularly other users' home directories, I also didn't want a user to ll /home and see the names of the other users on the system.  \nTo prevent this, as root run chmod 701 /home. This makes the /home directory itself \"read/write/execute\" to root of course, but only \"execute\" to everyone else. /home is still accessible to cd to, but users cannot read its contents- the other users' home folders and therefore usernames.\n\nA: Reassess your requirement first. What is the problem you are trying to solve? Why do you want to prevent users from leaving their home directory? Isn't it rather that you don't want them to rummage through specific other directories -- such as the home directories of other users?\nIt is very difficult to prevent users from leaving their home directory. It is actually a bit silly, too (explanation follows). It is much simpler to prevent users from entering directories you don't want them to enter.\nFirst off, yes you can give users a so-called restricted shell, see man rbash. This will prevent them from cd-ing elsewhere, but only inside that shell. If the user starts vi or nano (or any other program capable of opening a file) they can again open files anywhere on the system. As a matter of fact, a restricted shell does not prevent e.g. cat /etc/passwd.\nThe next step up is a root jail. More info on the community wiki and in this question. Though a root jail will lock users inside a walled garden, within which they have access to nothing but the files and commands that you intentionally put there, root jails really are intended for isolating untrusted software rather than users. In particular, they are for software that needs to run with elevated privileges -- hence a root jail.\nUsers, on the other hand, are trusted: they have had to authenticate and run without elevated privileges. Therefore file permissions suffice to keep them from changing files they do not own, and from seeing things they must not see. To prevent users from reading the content of a file, remove its world-readability with chmod o-r FILE . To keep users out of a directory, make it world-inaccessible with chmod o-rwx DIR.\nWorld-readability is the default though, for good reason: users actually need most of the stuff that's on the file system. Don't lock users in their homes just because there exist secrets outside.\nWhy locking users in their home directory is a bit silly\nTo do anything useful, users need access to commands and applications. These are in directories like /bin and /usr/bin, so unless you copy all commands they need from there to their home directories, users will need access to /bin and /usr/bin. But that's only the start. Applications need libraries from /usr/lib and /lib, which in turn need access to system resources, which are in /dev, and to configuration files in /etc and /usr/share. \nThis was just the read-only part. Applications will also want /tmp and often /var to write into. So, if you want to constrain a user within his home directory, you are going to have to copy a lot into it. In fact, pretty much an entire base file system -- which you already have, located at /.\n\nA: I needed to provide access to user sam on /var/xyz only and block listing contents of other folders inside /var/\nI used the following sequence of commands:\nsetfacl -R -m user:sam:--- /var/\n\nsetfacl -m user:sam:rx /var/\n\nsetfacl -R -m user:sam:rwx /var/xyz/\n\nSo the user can see directories listed under /var/ but cannot see contents under sub directories except /var/xyz.\n\nA: This is what worked for me:\nsudo adduser --home /the/only/accessed/directory baby_user --no-create-home\n\nchown baby_user:baby_user /the/only/accessed/directory\n\nchmod 755 /the/only/accessed/directory\n\nThen:\nsetfacl -m user:baby_user:rx /the/only/accessed/directory\n\nAnd voila baby_user cannot cd upwards ...\n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following command:\nvi /bin/restrictedbash\n\n\n\n*Then add the following to the file:\n#!/bin/bash\nbash --restricted\n\n\n\n*Then change the permissions of the file using the following command:\nchmod 755 /bin/restrictedbash\n\n\n\n*Then run the following command to edit the passwd file:\nvi /etc/passwd\n\n\n\n*Then replace the line that belongs to the user as follows:\nali:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/ali:/bin/bash\n\nwith\nali:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/ali:/bin/restrictedbash\n\nThen user ali will be restricted to his own home directory.\n", "Q: How to make a device (With a Windows application on it) ask to install a program on Wine? Ok, lets say I insert a HTC phone into my laptop.\nOn Windows, it says:\n\nWould you like to install HTC sync manager?\nYes Or No.\n\nAnd I would click 'Yes'. But On Ubuntu it does nothing like that. It just lets me use 3G and/or view it's files.\nI have Wine installed.\nSo, can I get it to install a Windows Application on Wine?\n\nA: I don't think Ubuntu has an auto-run functionality of its own. Only auto-mount and show the drive in the file explorer. Wine might have some sort of setting for that, though. I know you can add CD-ROM drives to it. So maybe you could add this drive to it.\nDo you just need to do the same thing the auto-run would do, however? You can usually just look at the files and run whatever autorun.inf lists as the auto-run executable. \nNote that if you are trying to install HTC Sync, I don't know if it works in Wine. You don't need it for development drivers on Linux, though, or for mounting phones as storage. No drivers are needed. \nIf you are trying to use the media transfer UI, then it might be worth trying to run it.

If that link doesn't work for you come back here and we'll solve it old school.\nThis is not a good fix, but as a work-around you can switch your bios settings to choose which hard drive you boot from. With one Linux hard drive and one windows hard drive that should ease the problem until you can fix it properly.\nYou need to update your bios. To dual boot Linux & win 8 you need to enable \"Legacy boot\" and/or disable \"Secure boot\".

Should I worry? My SATA drive is from 2009 and has been under some circumstances where it's not \"Pleasant\" for the drive, such as blackouts (lots of them).\nOn Ubuntu 12.04 SMART reported 4029 bad sectors. I often do a zero-fill on the drive and I read that it reallocates those bad sectors. So, if it do a reallocate, why \"a failure is imminent\"? Why should I worry?\nAlso, any tips on how to prevent this will also help!\n\nA: First of all you should take a backup.\nNow should you worry! Mmmm. Ok let's first define a bad sectors.\nThere are two types of bad sectors — often divided into “physical” and “logical” bad sectors or “hard” and “soft” bad sectors.\n\n\n*\n\n*A physical — or hard — bad sector is a cluster of storage on the hard drive that’s physically damaged. The hard drive’s head may have touched that part of the hard drive and damaged it, some dust may have settled on that sector and ruined it, a solid-state drive’s flash memory cell may have worn out, or the hard drive may have had other defects or wear issues that caused the sector to become physically damaged. This type of sector cannot be repaired.\n\n*A logical — or soft — bad sector is a cluster of storage on the hard drive that appears to not be working properly. The operating system may have tried to read data on the hard drive from this sector and found that the error-correcting code (ECC) didn’t match the contents of the sector, which suggests that something is wrong. These may be marked as bad sectors, but can be repaired by overwriting the drive with zeros — or, in the old days, performing a low-level format.\nOk now how to repair these bad sectors in Linux:\nOpen a terminal window.\nType the following command:\n sudo e2fsck -cfpv /dev/sdXX\n\nReplace \"sdbX\" with your actual device name, this can be an entire drive, such as \"sda\" or a partition, such as \"sda1. \"\nThe parameters have the following meanings:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"c\" searches for bad blocks and adds them to the list\n\n*\"f\" forces a check on the file system\n\n*\"p\" repairs anything that can be safely repaired\n\n*\"v\" is verbose mode so you can see the command progress.\n\n\nThe \"e2fsck\" command can take a long time to run, even several hours on a particularly large drive.\nExit the terminal after the \"e2fsck\" command is finished.\nNow it's better to run e2fsck on unmounted disks, so I advise you to do it using a live CD.\nLearn more about e2fsck man e2fsck\nsource\n\nA: Define \"worried\"?\nHow valuable is your data ? If you value your data you should have a working backup period. It is not a matter of if a hard drive will fail, but when.\n4029 bad sectors and having to zero fill your hard drive are indications that the drive is failing.\n", "Q: Is the pm-suspend command equivalent to the GUI suspend option?

I have found a dozen import scripts to import the metadata (ratings, play count) to Rhythmbox. But the comments I have found all indicate that they do not work very well, and none of them are in active development/have had any fixes to them after being initially dumped on the Web. Considering that this is something a user/developer only has to do once\nDoes anyone have experience with importing an iTunes library in Rhythmbox? Any importer scripts that can be recommended?\nAlso, I do not understand how these scripts are supposed to import the music itself. The directory structures and paths will be different, for example, and they do not seem to address that.\nThe scripts I’ve seen are itunes2rhythm and itunes-to-rhythmbox-ratings.\n\nA: I faced the same issue and wrote migrate-itunes-to-rhythmbox.

I've heard that the ext4 filesystem does not need to be defragmented because the way it stores information is engineered to avoid exactly that problem.\nAt them same time, I have a program called Bleach Bit, which is essentially the Unix version of CCleaner for Windows, except a lot more detailed and advanced (not to mention several times faster).\nFor a few months now I've been running BB before shutting down, but if clutter and fragmentation generally is not a problem for Linux and ext4, then is there really a point to using Bleach Bit? Or could I just install it once a month to do a clean, and then immediately uninstall it?\nI'm not quite savvy with the deep innards of the filesystem, so a detailed technical explanation would be great if possible.\nThanks\n\nA: Pretty certain that CCleaner DOES NOT perform a defrag, on my Win 7 installations I've used it's sister program Dfraggler for that purpose. More details HERE\nFrom what I've gathered in reading defrag is not a real concern on ext4 file system, however cleaning up clutter and old files is a separate function. You've probably noticed when running BB quite a number of files are eliminated. For my ancient Dell laptop it really makes a difference by using BB frequently.\n\nA: It's possible that things are being mixed up here. Bleachbit is primarily for deleting files that may not be needed anymore provided the user knows what is safe to delete. It doesn't appear to be a tool for defragmenting disks. The closest it comes to \"defragmenting\" is the vacuuming of databases:\nQ: Will BleachBit make my computer faster?  \nA: BleachBit probably won't make your computer faster in general, but ... you may see your computer become faster. ... vacuuming SQLite databases speed up applications that use them. Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome are some of the applications that stores various data, such as URL history, in an SQLite database. With heavy browsing, the databases become defragmented and bloated, and this happens at a level higher than the disk storage, so standard disk defragmentation tools are completely useless. BleachBit shrinks the SQLite database (saving disk space and disk I/O effort) and defragments them. ...\n(I don't use Bleachbit and I don't vacuum. Instead, I delete cache and browsing history.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 fails to reconnect to wireless On 12.10 if my laptop goes to sleep (i.e. by closing the lid) or restarts it fails to connect to my wifi again.

The next time you try to write to the sector, the drive will try to write there, and if writing fails, it will reallocate the sector from the spare pool, if there are any spare sectors left.  If writing worked, then the count of bad sectors would go down.  This can happen because the sector was scrambled, but physically fine.

Can someone explain what p25p1 actually means and what advantages it has over eth0..ethX?\n\nA: Eventually I found the answer.  I'm surprised no one else answered this question.\nIt would appear to be a function of the newer kernels and is called Consistent Network Device Naming\nThe new naming scheme is:\nLan-On-Motherboard interfaces\n\nem<port number>_< virtual function instance / NPAR Index> (ethernet-on-motherboard <1,2 ..>)\n\nPCI add-in interfaces \n\np<slot number>p<port number>_<virtual function instance / NPAR Index>\n\nOther Linux conventions, such as . and : suffixes remain unchanged and are still applicable \n", "Q: My computer is running hotter then usual?

It was a default plain blue color.  \nAny idea why that happened? \nThis was the first time I shut my computer down since I installed ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n\nA: If the image you set as wallpaper resides in partition other than the ones that are mounted automatically when Ubuntu starts, then your wallpaper is sure to be reset as the file cannot be opened and read since it does not mount the partition on its own(may be a bug).\nUsually, partitions other than ext partitions(/, /home, /boot, etc.) are not mounted at boot time.

I already setup Samba on Ubuntu Server. It's working fine, but I would like to have it accessed by any user using their username and password, in any windows PC that a user would choose to use. Please help me how to do that. Is that possible? Any help will be appreciated.\n\nA: Samba has a built in user authentication mechanism. You can give users permission to access your shares and use smbpasswd to set their passwords. You can also synchronize user's login password with Samba password. Samba Server Configuration tool can help you on this, as illustrated here.\nWhen you set up password for users, they'll be automatically required to enter it to access your shares from any computer that can access your Samba server. If your point is accessing with the same passwords they use on clients then you either need to set same passwords on clients and server, or you need a centralized authentication mechanism based on LDAP, Kerberos, etc. \n", "Q: How to create a bash file allowing a folder from CD be transferred to Documents? i want to transfer the myfiles folder from CD to Documents in a more decent way of transferring. I think creating an executable bash file is better. this bash file when clicked will allow the transfering of files. How will I create this?\n\nA: If you want to use script for that, then write a script like that:\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"Transferring myfiles folder from CD to Documents...\"\ncp /media/(((CD Name)))/myfiles /home/(((username)))/Documents\necho \"Transferred Successfully\"\n\nAll done.\n\nA: The following bash script detects the mount point of the first CD/DVD drive and copies the myfiles folder to the Documents folder.

However, if this is going to load for each login shell, then you do partly need to be concerned about whether ZSH runs it or some other shell language runs it.\n\nA: You might try using Startup Applications.\nHere is what you have to do, to automatically start the command unity-2d-shell on startup. unity-2d-shell is just an example, you can have your own .sh scripts.

Since I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Acer 4310 laptop I have noticed that the system freezes on occasions and the screen showing the program I am running shows a grey colour. I have done a clean install of Ubuntu and it still happens. One person said that either my 80GB hard drive is not enough or I need more RAM (I have 512mb). I did notice when I reinstalled Ubuntu 12.04 for the second time as a clean install it did say that it was using the whole drive, but of course i didn't believe it. Are there any diagnostic tools I can use to check???\n\nA: The bare minimum of system requirements rarely leads to a acceptable level of performance.\nThings you can easily do to increase performance include:\nA) Adding more RAM\nB) Replacing the hard drive with one that packs more data onto a single track (higher capacity) or one with a faster rotational speed (a 7200 RPM drive will typically outperform a 5400 or 4200 RPM drive for obvious reasons).\nC) Replacing the hard drive with a SSD (this approach will not only increase performance by being limited only by the speed of your interface (SATA-150) but also by drastically reducing seek time from 10's of ms to a fraction of a ms as there are no moving parts (heads to reposition to the appropriate track)\n", "Q: Wireless is disabled after reboot, suspend, hibernate in 12.04 I have Ubuntu 12.04 in my laptop (Samsung Q330).

I have the fglrx-updates installed. The problem is that my gpu fan, upon startup, ramps up to 100% and stays that way. It's the  same way on my Windows partition, but I can manually set it there. I can manually set it to 20% fan speed with:\naticonfig --pplib-cmd \"set fanspeed 0 20\"\n\nHowever, the problem is, that upon reboot, the manual fanspeed setting is forgotten and it defaults back to 100% fan speed. How can I make this permanent?\nNote: I am only somewhat confident that 20% fan speed would be sufficient, as I will not be doing anything graphically intensive with it. I cannot be completely sure as the following:\naticonfig --adapter=0 --od-gettemperature\n\nsimply/suspiciously gives me a value of 0C.\n\nA: I wrote a little ruby script which exactly does that. Maybe you want to translate it into plain bash, though. You can execute it on startup but my purpose was to have a continuous temperature based fan speed adjustment so I call it every 2 minutes with cron.  \n", "Q: Changed Partition from NTFS to EXT4 and owner is set to root I just changed the file-system of one of my partitions to be able to install games from steam on it.

Where can I find that in ubuntu?\n\nA: \nI can not create any folders there or do anything with it. \n\nYes, you can... if you are root that is (since as you claim: root owns it).

My problem is that I have my default profile for gnome terminal set to 80x43. However, most of the time when launching Gnome terminal from the launcher, it defaults to some slightly smaller size (row-wise). It maintains the correct column width, but instead of 43 rows tall, it's something smaller (about 38-40). The confusing parts are:\n1) It sometimes opens with the correct terminal size.\n2) It always opens to the correct terminal size when I create a new window while within Gnome terminal.\nAny ideas as to this inconsistency.\n\nA: I suspect that running gnome-terminal via the launcher looks at gnome-terminal's .desktop file in /usr/share/applications.\nTo test this, copy the relevant .desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications. Then, open the copied file in gedit, no need of sudo, and look at the line that starts with Exec=. Insert --geometry 80x43 after gnome-terminal leaving a single space. Save the file. Close it and try running gnome-terminal from the launcher again.\nI can't test this since I don't have gnome-terminal installed but nothing destructive can happen. If it doesn't work as desired, just delete the copied file and the launcher will then use the original file in /usr/share/applications.  \n", "Q: How do I know if an app is safe to use?

Could you go with the \"Run from USB stick\" to verify compatibility with hardware or will that run in some kind of virtual environment?\n//Daniel\n\nA: It will run on your Hardware except the HDD, but this shouldnt be a Problem. Ther is no virtual environment.\nYou can try Ubuntu from USB Stick to gain an insight, if your Hardware would make trouble or not, but is is NOT a guarantee, that a real installation will not make some troubles.\nFor the beginning, you can try to install a dualboot to save your Windows installation.\nNeedless to say, that you should make a backup bevor you do anything!\n", "Q: C and V keys not working..Help! I am using Ubuntu 12.04. I was tinkering around learning the commands and stuff in terminal. I was a bit irritated that I couldn't copy and paste using only the keyboard. So I googled on how to add these shortcuts to my terminal.. I came upon these commands on DistroGeeks:\ngconftool-2 -s /apps/gnome-terminal/keybindings/copy -t str 'c'\n\nfor adding Ctrl + C to copy... and\ngconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/gnome-terminal/keybindings/paste 'v'\n\nto paste using Ctrl + v...\nI ran these lines of code on my terminal and  the c and v no longer gives the input... Uppercase works well...\nNow typing c causes copy and simply typing v causes paste!\nCan I undo these actions?\n\nA: The command gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/gnome-terminal will unset all settings you added to the gnome-terminal.\nYou can also unset only one key with the --unset option.\nYou might need to log off and back on for the settings to take effect.\n", "Q: Sound Not playing through HDMI I am running Ubuntu 12.10 using the \"wubi\" tool on my HP Pavilion dv5-1080ei with Windows 8.\nWhen I ran Ubuntu for the first time my monitor/tv connected via the hdmi had no picture coming to it even though it was showing up in the display settings.

The typical behavior is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right after login, I select the ssid I'm interested in in the list in the network manager, and after a few seconds it reports that it connected. ifconfig seems to agree with that.\n\n*I try to ping something or access a page through the browser, which fails. \nSometimes it disconnects by itself after a few seconds.

To update your kernel go to the \nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\nand download 4 kernels according to your system\n32bit - linux-image-xxx-i386, linux-image-extra-xxx-i386, linux-headers-xxx-i386 and linux-headers-all.deb\n64bit - linux-image-xxx-amd64, linux-image-extra-xxx-amd64, linux-headers-xxx-amd64 and linux-headers-all.deb\nthen open the terminal and locate the folder you downloaded all the files, let's say Download folder\ncd Downloads\n\nThen make sure you do not have any other files in the download directory (I mean other .deb files) to make sure it won't mess up the installation and install the kernel\nsudo dpkg -i linux*.deb\n\nThat's it!\n", "Q: qtchoose doesn't run due to \"'/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/bin/qtchooser': No such file or directory\" error When I try to start qtchooser i get this notification:\nqtchooser: could not exec '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/bin/qtchooser': No such file or directory\n\nI've installed Qt5 from ppa:canonical-qt5-edgers/qt5-beta-proper\nI hope you can help me.\n\nA: The error message is normal, although uninformative. In essence you're trying to execute qtchooser with itself, which doesn't work. Run the man qtchooser command on a terminal for how to use qtchooser, or just keep the ubuntu-sdk (and qt5-default) packages installed, in which case you don't need to care about qtchooser existing.\nUpstream has fixed the problem with a more helpful text nowadays, but that version of qtchooser is not yet in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: 11.10 file extension what file extensions does ubuntu 11.10 use ?\ni am trying to install google chrome.\nin google chrome site there are two types of files available for Ubuntu \".deb\" and \".rpm\"\ni downloaded both, but neither one works...\n\nA: .rpm files (Red Hat Package Manager) are for Red Hat based Linux versions like Fedora and CentOS.  Ubuntu is a Debian based version of Linux, so you will want the .deb file.\nOnce you are done with your download, you can install Chrome by double-clicking on the .deb file or by executing the following command via terminal.\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\n\nNote, that this command assumes the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have changed to the directory which contains the .deb file.\n\n*The name of the Chrome download file is \"google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\"\n\n", "Q: Resize the window control buttons (close, restore, maximize) How can I change the size of the close/restore/maximize/minimize buttons of the windows?\nThey are too small for me. With a big monitor, it's difficult to position the mouse over them.\nIs there a setting or theme or something in Mint or Ubuntu?\nI'd really like the buttons to be at least 48 pixels wide. Currently they are ~20 pixels.\n\nA: This is something which is managed by your theme. The reason for this is because themes use bitmap images which are not scaleable so for each button size a theme author must provide the images which are pre-scaled to that size. I'm not 100% sure but I believe this is something newer themes may be able to get around by using SVG images (but either way this setting will still be in the same place)\nIf you don't see an option to alter the button size in your theme 'Window Decorations' tab then it won't be available. The best way to get the button size you want is probably going to be to choose a theme you like. \nAnother alternative which you may or may not prefer is to adjust the DPI settings for your desktop. Unfortunately, you haven't mentioned the desktop you use so I can't really help anymore unless I wanted to list instruction for each desktop (which I don't). If you manage to find this setting though it'll allow you to effectively 'zoom' the entire screen. This will enlarge everything (not just the buttons). Personally, I like to do this because it makes everything nice and big yet the resolution stays high so it is still nice looking.\n", "Q: AWN dock doesn't differentiate the active window I have installed Avant Window Navigator 0.4.1 in Ubuntu 12.10 (64 bit) and am pretty much satisfied with its looks.

Everything looks the same.\nAs shown in the screen-shot below, I use multiple profiles in firefox and open multiple instances of firefox and get confused between which window I am currently working with.\n\nIs there any way to highlight the active window  in awn?\n\nA: I found a setting under awn theme customization called Active Rectangle which was exactly what I was looking for. After changing that setting to my need, I was able to see a rectangle on the active window icon.

In this case (1st -e), the s command performs a substitution: s/foo/bar/ replaces the 1st occurrence of foo on each line by bar.  To be sure we work on complete line, I added ^ (beginning of the line) and $ (end of the line).\nYou can prefix a command by a selector.  In this case (2nd -e), the s command is applied only to a line matching ^FFLAGC=-Wall -O$.\nYou could even use the -i flag to replace the file:\nsed -i -e 's/^FCOMPL=g77$/FCOMPL=gfortran/' \\\n       -e '/^FFLAGC=-Wall -O$/s/$/ -fno-backslash/' makefile\n\n", "Q: How to control fan noise in Ubuntu 12.04? After upgrading from 10.04 to 12.04 I could find that my fan noise is heavier than before. Even though my my CPU usage is less than 10%.\ncan anybody tell me how to control the noise\nThanks.\n\nA: It's hard to give a solution without knowing the details of your hardware. The main offender in my experience has been the dual graphics card that is found on many laptops these days. Ubuntu's default graphics drivers sometimes use the discrete GPU by default, or uses the graphics card inefficiently, resulting in more heat which causes the fan to run more often and louder.\nTo solve this, I have installed the recommended proprietary drivers (System Settings > Additional Drivers) and adjusted my settings to use the integrated GPU rather than the discrete GPU (by executing sudo aticonfig --px-igpu; sudo restart lightdm though your system is likely different).\n\nA: I had a very similar issue with my laptop when first installing Ubuntu.\nFor me, the fix was as follows: Open up a terminal (ctrl-alt-T), and type gksu gedit /etc/default/grub. Input your password when requested.\nFind the line which reads as follows:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nand edit it so that it instead reads\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash pcie_aspm=force\".\nSave the file and quit gedit, then type into your terminal sudo update-grub. Once this is done, reboot and you should be good to go.\n\nA: Check out How to control fan-speed, it has answers that might help you. Keep in mind that it's almost always better to let the system decide how fast the fan should run, rather than controlling it manually.\n\nA: I had this problem, too. My problem was that my laptop has two graphic cards. It is a problem with the kernel. You must disable the discrete graphic card. It's easy. You can install jupiter in ubuntu and then choose \"internal display only\" from that. My fan works very cool. I hope this will be useful to you.\n\nA: In my opinion the fan noise need a bios update  , so check your board model and install its update , the fan noise should disappear ( Update bios solved my problem )\n\nA: I had used another power manager before to solve this problem. Using Jupiter on my new 12.04 installation worked well. So the answer above (quoted) was able to solve this problem for my Compaq 610 model.\n\"I had this problem, too.

Why? I'm a Windows user but am interested in trying Ubuntu.\nI've found the official download site and have tried to download Ubuntu 12.04.\nI believed I was downloading Ubuntu 12.04 but I seem to have downloaded Roxio Creator instead. \nCan someone explain to me what I've done wrong?\n\nA: You very likely did not download Roxio Creator. In Windows, a file sometimes appears and behaves as though it is the application configured to open it. The Ubuntu downloads are .iso images. This means they are a virtual image of a disk (basically, the digital version of your CD or DVD). Roxio is one application that is designed to open such files.\nRoxio Creator is very likely what your computer has chosen for the default application to open .iso files with. The file will show the Roxio icon, and when you double-click it, Roxio will open (because Roxio opens the file). By default in Windows, extensions for known file types like .iso are hidden, so you likely cannot see \".iso\" at the end of the filename. Assuming this is what's happening, the file is not Roxio itself, and was probably even downloaded correctly.\nTo check and see if this is what happened, look at the name of the file. It should have \"ubuntu\" in it. In particular, if you downloaded Ubuntu 12.04, the filename should be something like ubuntu-12.04.2-desktop-i386 or ubuntu-12.04.2-server-amd64.\nIn order to use your Ubuntu download, you have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can burn it to a disk. This is what Windows thinks you want to do with it, hence determining that Roxio is the most suitable application. You should be able to use Roxio to burn it, but if you prefer not to (or have problems doing so), there are other options (see below). Then boot from the burned CD/DVD to install Ubuntu.\n\n*You can write it to a USB flash drive (see below for details).\n\n*If you want to use the Windows installer (Wubi), you have the additional option of mounting it with virtual drive mounting software. However, such software is not in Windows by default.\n\n\nThe Ubuntu documentation has a good tutorials for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Burning an Ubuntu ISO image to a CD/DVD. (See also: How to burn a DVD on Windows)\n\n*Writing an Ubuntu ISO image to a USB flash drive.\n(See also: How to create a bootable USB stick on Windows)\n\n\nAs a related but somewhat different situation, sometimes an ISO image appears to be a different, non-executable file type.

I thought of installing Ubuntu 12.04 and I used the option \"install alongside windows\". So every thing went down good except Network Manager icon did not show the wireless connection that I get in Win 7. I have gone through almost all forums. I followed some instruction (terminal commands) but i just came to know that those command require internet connection. So, its no benefit. And just recently i removed network manager using the code\nsudo apt-get remove --purge network-manager-gnome network-manager\n\nfor some stupid reasons (don't ask) and now i can't re-install using the code\nsudo apt-get install -d --reinstall network-manager network-manager-gnome\n\nI  guess that code also needs internet connection. I am FRUSTATED out of my mind. Need help badly.  \n\nA: It would be best if you could find a wired connection and connect your laptop to that and then reinstall the network manager.\nAfter that, you should check the 'Additional Drivers' to see if you can find the drivers available there for your network card - it requires a network connection as well to download those and requires you to reboot after installing them.\nIf you have no luck with getting a wired internet connection, you might be better off re-installing Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Please help me with instalation of 64bit version Hi, I have Intel(R) Core(TM) Quad CPU q8200 @ 2.33Ghz but I wasn't able to install the 64bit version, Ubuntu 12.10 desktop-amd64. Can you help find the right ( x64 ? ) distribution that would work on my PC?\n\nA: amd64 is used for both AMD and Intel processors, as they have (more or less) the same architecture.

(Enter root password where necessary)\nsudo cp script /usr/local/bin\nsudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/script\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/script\n\nUbuntu automatically puts ~/bin on your user path (you have to log out and back in or start a new log in shell) and /usr/local/bin is already on the default path.\nMake sure #! /usr/bin/env python is at the very top of the script and that the script is executable (chmod 755)\n\nA: Make an alias for your command using this syntax:\nalias COMMAND_NAME='COMMAND'\n\nThis way, you made your own shortcut to your command ( And of course, you can pass parameters to your alias, as it's your command, nothing less, nothing more. Also you can link this alias to run an script, for example, I made an alias to open steam + dota2 instantly like this:\nalias steamz='sh ~/Games/steam.sh'\n\n)\nBut, your shortcut will be removed once you close your Terminal, so to save this alias and use it daily, add this piece to ~/.bashrc, this file contains commands running on each Terminal run, so if you add your alias definition to this file, your alias will be automatically defined on each Terminal run.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu wont boot, Grub error, will boot repair mess with windows boot files?

The thing is, will it mess my windows ?! Or does repair Ubuntu and linux distributions only ?!\n\nA: I haven't heard of boot repair, but I might have a working solution for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a live USB and boot into the system.\n\n*Find out which partition is Ubuntu. You can do this via running disk utility (palimpsest in terminal). Then click on your harddisk and select your ubuntu partition. Write down the device, for example: \"/dev/sda5\".\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and mount the ubuntu partition:\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\n\n*Install grub on your ubuntu partition:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\nThe command above assumes your hardrive device is /dev/sda, so it will install the grub bootloader on the harddrive. If everything goes well, grub will try to find all the operating systems located on your computer. After that you should be able to reboot and see a normal grub menu. Good luck!\n\nA: you have to reinstall grub.\nuse boot-repair. it is easy to use. go on live ubuntu and the install boot-repair. open boot-repair and go to recommended repair. one thing, you have to write down the link showed before reboot message. \n", "Q: World of Warcraft under primus/crossover getting Direct3D9 is not available without opengl I'm running Ubuntu 12.10 64bit and having issues using primus (due to nvidia optimus) to run World of Warcraft in Crossover..\nI'm getting the following:\nsteorra@perpetual:~$ primusrun /opt/cxoffice/bin/wine --bottle \"World of Warcraft\" --cx-app \"Wow.exe\"\np11-kit: couldn't load module: /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkcs11/gnome-keyring-pkcs11.so: /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkcs11/gnome-keyring-pkcs11.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nXlib:  extension \"NV-GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\nDirect3D9 is not available without OpenGL.\nDirect3D9 is not available without OpenGL.\nDirect3D9 is not available without OpenGL.\n\nI've tried installing the Runtime Libraries for Direct3d9 under the relevant crossover bottle to no avail.

The thing is that since ubuntu 11.04 ubuntu can't see my home wifi. I have an Acer aspire 5742 with a broadcom bcm 43225 wireless card. In ubuntu 10.10 the wifi worked perfectly, but since then I can connect everywhere but my home wifi. \nI don't have changed anything in the configuration of the router. Now, with ubuntu 12.10 running from a live-usb it can see my wifi and connect to it, but when I start the install process, it disconnects and again can't see my wifi. Any ideas? Thanks for your help.\n--EDIT--\nWell, correct me if I'm wrong. I'm from Spain, and my router manual says that the wireless channel should be put in channel 13. With a little googling I discovered that the BCM43225 don't like channels from 12-14.\nSo, is there any problem if I change my wireless channel to channel 1? Is there any significant difference between channel 1 and 13 apart from the bandwidth?\nThanks\n\nA: For anybody reaching here. The solution was changing my router channel to a channel less than 11. Then, it works like a charm.\n\nA: The problem is set when the owner does not want to change the channel, or you are in a panel house where channels 12 and 13 are currency-loaded. In addition, Windows 10 can use these same channels without the slightest bug. This is a big bug in Linux.\n", "Q: EFI Dual-boot issue with Windows 7 and xubuntu 12.10 Thank you so much for reading. I'm pretty desperate for an answer at this moment.\nSo anyways, I recently solved this issue allowing me to install xubuntu 12.10 correctly. This was a problem with the MBR. (even though I use EFI? :/ )\nNow when I boot up the computer, I get to go into grub. OK. xubuntu works perfectly, no weird things over there. But when I try to boot Windows, there is this error: \"error: invalid EFI file path\".\n(Both OSs are x64 and they also both use EFI.)\nThis is the log from boot-repair. I can't seem to understand why Windows won't boot :(\nAny help is greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Your GRUB configuration is set up for booting Windows in BIOS mode, but this won't work because you've clearly got an EFI-mode installation of Windows. There are a number of possible solutions. Here are a couple....\nFirst, you could edit the file called /etc/grub.d/40_custom and add an entry like this:\nmenuentry \"Windows 7 (custom)\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt3)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi.grb\n}\n\nThen type sudo update-grub. With any luck that will create a new GRUB entry called \"Windows 7 (custom)\" that should work. This isn't guaranteed, though; GRUB is pretty finicky and flaky about launching Windows. What works on one system may not work on another. You'll also probably continue to have the non-functional entry in the GRUB menu.\nA second option is to install rEFInd, which is an alternative to GRUB. If you install it via the Debian package, it should set itself up automatically and launch the next time you boot; however, the Windows icon in its menu will probably launch GRUB, thanks to the way the Boot Repair tool \"fixed\" things. To fix this problem, you can type the following commands in Ubuntu:\ncd /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/\ncp bootmgfw.efi.grb bootmgfw.efi\n\nThereafter, the Windows entry should boot Windows. You'll also have an entry with an Ubuntu icon that will boot GRUB and one or more Linux penguin icons that will launch Ubuntu directly. If the penguin icons work to your satisfaction and you don't want the GRUB icon any more, you can remove it by deleting the /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu directory or by editing /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf, uncommenting the dont_scan_dirs or dont_scan_files line, and adding entries to them to keep GRUB out of the menu.\n\nA: I don't think your grub install messed up the path to Windows efi, in your pastebin it is still there, /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi, just try to get to it from your computer boot menu, press F10 or F12 when it starts up. On the other hand, I've never managed to load an efi Windows from within grub, although I wish.\n", "Q: nexus 7 onboard keyboard issues when i start up ubuntu on my nexus 7, i am greeted with the first time setup screen.

I am using Ubuntu 12.10.

But when I right-click in Downloads and choose \"open containing folder\", it opens Thunar and not Nautilus.\n\nHow can I change that?\n\nA: I also encountered such problem, but in my case - just switching default File Manager to something and back to needed one, using standard gui, was helpful. \n\nA: If the already mentioned solutions don't work, try this.\nWrite the following to /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.FileManager1.service:\n[D-BUS Service]\nName=org.freedesktop.FileManager1\nExec=/usr/bin/thunar --gapplication-service\n\nChange the Exec line to your liking. (Default nautilus.)\n\nA: There is an old bug that points to some setting in the file /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache.\nThe line that starts with inode/directory= in my system looks like this:\ninode/directory=nautilus-folder-handler.desktop;nautilus.desktop;\n\nI guess yours points to Thunar instead.\nTo make the change, you need to edit mimeinfo.cache with:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache\n\n\nA: If you don't want to modify the system settings, or don't have access to it, you may copy & personalize the line starting with inode/directory= (from /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache) to ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\n\nA: After a lot of tries, I came upon the very simple method given above by Gill Bates, which was to\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into System Settings\n\n*Switch default manager to something else\n\n*Switch it back\n\n\nSo I did that, then closed and reopened Firefox and sure enough, it worked like a charm.  Maybe I can invoke Occam's Razor here...\n\nA: The suggestion by @carnendil is not wise because the system generates this list at startup and it therefore should not be directly edited by the user. In fact, each entry is supposed to contain all the options available on the system and sometimes the first entry is not the preferred one.\nIn theory, the suggestion by @Fab should work, but it turns out that sometimes programs attempt to reference defaults.list exclusively. For example, the discussion on Bugzilla reveals that Firefox doesn't even know to look for either of the user's local lists, defaults.list and mimeapps.list.\n\nTherefore, I suggest you edit one of the following files, with the first option probably being the wisest choice unless you are on a multiuser system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /usr/share/applications/defaults.list; or\n\n*Edit both ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list and ~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list; or\n\n*Edit one of the files within ~/.local/share/applications/ and then create a symbolic link to that file from the other (e.g. edit ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list and link to it from ~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list).\n\n\nTo one of the following options above, add (or change) the following line:\ninode/directory=Thunar-folder-handler.desktop\n\n\nA: I had the same issue as you guys but none of the answers really worked for me. \nI had downloaded Konqueror (so that I can listen to Spotify independently of Firefox) and it had installed Dolphin as a prerequisite. Firefox started opening files in Dolphin after that.\nAs I do not use Dolphin for anything and Konqueror is only being used for Spotify, I decided to do away with Dolphin. Every distro has some kind of option to uninstall packages while leaving the packages that depend on them alone.\nIn arch it was: \nsudo pacman -Rdd dolphin\n\nI don't use Ubuntu but since this channel is called askubuntu, I did a bit of research for the Ubuntu equivalent:\nsudo dpkg -r --force-depends dolphin\n\n(based on this thread)\nFor Thunar it should be:\nsudo dpkg -r --force-depends thunar\n\nObviously this won't apply to everyone. It's a judgment call, you have to be sure that the extra filebrowser you're removing is not essential to something that will break without it. As long you're certain no system apps need it, you can always uninstall it and see if things are stable and just re-install it if they are not.\n\nA: Solution for those running an XFCE environment, based on the other answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run xfce4-mime-settings (or Settings Menu -> Mime Type Editor).\n\n*Find inode/directory in the list\n\n*Set Open Folder with Thunar or similar\n\nA: had the same problem (Kubuntu 14.04, download-folder are opened with audacious). Ultimative solution explained here: https://mtekk.us/archives/guides/make-firefox-use-dolphin-for-open-containing-folder/\nIn my case: I had to remove audacious and gwenview from the list and it worked (opens with my default file-manager dolphin)\n\nA: The solution presented in other answers here and here involving refreshing the setting for file manager also works, but you need the GUI setting for that, and it also may be temporary, as the culprit may take over after programs installations or updates (see link below).\n\nThis is a problem that also appeared for me in more recent Ubuntu versions and ubuntu-based systems, and also in other Linux systems like Manjaro. It also appears in the same way in other browsers like Chrome and even other programs (like uGet, a downloader that also has the option \"open containing folder\"). The problem may appear also in more severe forms, where the default file manager is not replaced by other file manager, but by a different program (text editor, multimedia player).\nThe problem is, as indicated here, triggered only by the certain programs.\nThe best solution is to create or edit ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list: edit the line that starts with inode/directory= and add the name of the file manager that you use if it is not there already; if that is already there but another program is listed there first, put the file manager first (if you need the other program(s) to open folders).\nFor Pantheon Files it should be like\n[Default Applications]\ninode/directory=nautilus-folder-handler.desktop\n\nIf the desktop environment is not freedesktop complient, like my Manjaro Cinnamon, the file to be created/edited should be ~/.local/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache like so:\n[MIME Cache]\ninode/directory=nautilus-folder-handler.desktop\n\nAlso here.\n\nA: I found a solution which works for Firefox, Thunderbird and even for XNview.\nFirst open a console window as non-root. Then past the following command:\nxdg-mime query default inode/directory\n\nThis will output the current default browser. In my case it confirmed, that every application which is no part of TDE, uses Thunar. The next step is to determine the browser which you prefer:\nxdg-mime default kfmclient_dir.desktop inode/directory\n\nkfmclient_dir.desktop has to be replaced by the name of the filemanager you wish. If you don't know the exact name, open the \"file allocations\"-window in the settings of your desktop environment.\nIf more than one desktop environment is installed, I strongly recommend to change this only per user.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: No mounting device after update I was updating Ubuntu on my computer, but I didn't have time to wait for it so I restarted my computer, now when I boot it, it says it doesn't have a mounting device. What can I do?\n\nA: Try booting your system with Live CD and check with GPARTED for all your mounts which are supposed to be there.

Is there a command or a scripting interface to organize the desktop?\n\nA: It's not entirely clear what your question is. However, if it is that you want to be able to \"organise desktop icons\" (i.e. into a grid) from the command-line then this will likely depend on what flavour and version of Ubuntu you are using, because they use different managers.\nThere is a similar question here with no answer. However, there is quite a lot of discussion here with some very good answers, including a custom-made perl script that appears to do exactly that.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 12.10 not obtaining IP address until a user logs in I just did a recent install of Ubuntu Server 12.10 (no GUI, command line only) on a new system.  I noticed that upon booting the server does not obtain an IP address from my router.  However, once I log into the machine locally the server shows up on my list of DCHP clients and I can connect remotely without issue.  After some initial research, I looked at my /etc/network/interfaces/\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo eth0\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nOthers who had similar issues usually were missing either \"auto eth0\" or the \"dhcp\" and were able to fix their problem by adding those lines in.  My set up seems to be fine the way it is.\nNext up, I tried looking at /etc/local.rc and made two different attempts for the server to add eth0 on boot:\nAttempt #1\nifup eth0\nexit 0\n\nAttempt #2\ndhclient eth0\nexit 0\n\nYet neither of these changes caused the server to obtain IP before an initial local login.  Since I'm trying to run this server headless, being able to remotely login upon boot is pretty important for my needs.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated since most forums suggest to make the changes that I've already tried.  Thanks for your help.\n\nA: I've never seen more than one device named on an auto line before. This could be a dud suggestion but try this instead:\nauto lo \niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nAnd also check that it is eth0 and not eth1 or eth2.

I hibernated Windows 7, then booted Ubuntu. When I tried to mount the Windows partition, I got this error:\n\nI'd just read that switching OSes via hibernating was OK as long as you didn't modify files on the other OS's partition, and I'm glad Nautilus ensures you don't, but I need to copy some files from that partition. Is there a way to make Nautilus temporarily mount it as read-only? I was hoping I could just do something like \"right-click->Mount as Read-Only\" but that's not an option.\nUpdate: For the record, I was able to do it from a terminal using sudo mount -t ntfs-3g -r /dev/sda3 /media/adam/. It usually mounts to /media/adam/OS/, although it wouldn't let me do that since the OS folder didn't exist. Also, I had to authenticate as an admin to unmount it from Nautilus since it was mounted as root (the mount command I listed had to be run as root). However, I still a graphical solution would be better and a bit more user-friendly.\n\nA: I don't think there is an option in Nautilus to mount a partition/device as read-only.\nBut, for the record, there is another terminal command to mount the partition as read-only:\nudisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sda3 --options ro\n\nThis works at least in Ubuntu 13.04. It mounts to /media/user/label, even if the folder doesn't exist, and can be run as user (and unmounted in Nautilus without password prompt). The user must be an administrator (i.e. can use sudo), I think.\nudisksctl is probably what Nautilus uses to mount devices. The older command that mounted to /media/label is udisks, if I am not mistaken.\n\nA: If you prefer GUI, use Disks to indicate how a partition should be mounted. Add the read-only option to always have access to your hibernated W7 partition: http://www.hecticgeek.com/2012/10/make-ntfs-partitions-read-only-in-ubuntu/\n", "Q: What is the best alternative to Google Reader? I enjoy using Lightread in Ubuntu 12.10. The thing is Google Reader is being shutdown and Lightread is a client for Google Reader, so it's feed will be cut of.\nWhat is the best alternative as a RSS reader for Ubuntu 12.10?\n\nA: It's being overloaded with traffic, but look at Newsblur. The code is open and on Github, the site is designed in a freemium model.\n\nA: At the moment I would recommend Liferea due to the ease with which you can import your feeds from google reader and the aesthetics are closest to that of Lightread compared with other readers like RSSOwl for instance. \nShame google reader is disappearing. \nI hope Lightread might get a feature to work without google reader. \n\nA: This site should help you decide:\nhttp://www.replacereader.com/\nCurrently Feedly has more supporters on that site.\n\nA: I have the exact same issue indeed. Liferea Feed Reader seams to be a good alternative but I'll also give another try to Yarssr. Both are in the ubuntu software center.\n\nA: Commafeed and Tiny Tiny RSS are also two free RSS readers.\n\nA: If browser based, I am switching to Feedly. It will import your Google Reader account automatically. Google will help you find a suitable replacement.\nEDIT; I have now settled on InoReader, far classier than Feedly, (actually has a working Chromium extension with unread count!) Also can subscribe to feeds via RSS Subscription Extension (by Google). Double lovely, indeed, super nice!\n\nA: If importing isn't a big concern, consider Pulse (pulse.me). It offers a Web UI plus Android and iOS apps.\n\nA: In my opinion the best alternative is Opera Browser. It has a mail and rss reader integrated in the browser easily read to feed and open switch between rss, mail, surfing and other features in one app. \n\nYou could also try Thunderbirds - Evolution.\n\nA: A good alternative could be Stringer. Is a self-hosted RSS Reader that you could run in Heroku or any other server instance, so, as its creator says, When BIG_FREE_READER shuts down, your instance of Stringer will still be kicking.\n\nA: Check out Feedbro - an excellent feed reader (RSS, Atom, RDF) to replace Google Reader. Works as a standalone Chrome extension! Very fast, feature rich & easy to use. \nHome page & link to Chrome Web Store at: http://nodetics.com/feedbro\n\nA: Thanks for the great post. I like feedly. Its very best in design and very easy to handle. There are many new readers are coming in market. Recently digg Started Its digg Reader which is a good start. Here are some alternatives to help you.\nI belive Feedly is best and others such as newsblur/ pulse are also worth a try. If you are looking for Browser friendly then Aol reader , Tiny Tiny RSS , Feedbin , Yoleo is best options.\n\nA: There is also The Old Reader, which is very similar to Google Reader.

My internet connection is too slow to download this file in one stretch. Is there any way to do this in offline mode?\n\nA: Simply put both wubi and ubuntu iso(which you downloaded) in same folder(try to put wubi and ubuntu iso only no other files in that folder) and run wubi it will work.\nYou don't need to download wubi from website, just open ubuntu iso file in winrar and you can find wubi as last file, extract only wubi outside.\nYou should disconnect your internet connection before running wubi.\n\nA: Where did you get ubuntu-12.04-amd64.iso because the latest is ubuntu-12.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso. Wubi will reject an iso if it doesn't match the latest releases, or the online md5sum check fails.\nIf you run the wubi.exe you don't need a bootable USB. Just the iso and wubi.exe.\nThis is what to do if you want to install Wubi offline:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest iso for the release you want\n\n*Download the latest matching wubi.exe for the same release\n\n*Save both in the same directory before running wubi.exe.\n\n\nIf Wubi downloads the diskimage ubuntu-12.04.2-wubi-amd64.tar.xz then it's likely that it's not finding the iso (not in same folder) or it's corrupt.\n\nA: One best thing that can be done is download the wubi installer of the same version as the iso,\nIf it is windows 7, you need tools like daemon tools, which could mount the iso image. In Windows 8, this feature is already present.\nNow run the downloaded wubi.exe installer, and no need of usb or cd.\nHope this works fine, if it doesn't, let us know.\n", "Q: How to open a new tab via a button using the Ubuntu Touch Qt SDK?

I'm about to buy parts for a new home server and I'm planning on using Ubuntu(perhaps 12.04 LTS)\nFor the OS, I'll use an SSD.\nFor cold storage(big files, rarely accessed), I'm planning on setting up Samba and an array of hard drives. Specifically, I'm planning on 4 Western Digital Green 3TB drives on a RAID 10 (ten) array.\nWill the Ubuntu automatically spin the drives down if no programs are actively reading/writing?\nDoes RAID make a difference? Are there any configuration setting I should know about?\nSecond, Any potential problems with my plan? 1 SSD for the OS and RAID 10 for 6TB of storage? I will need a GUI from time to time, so I might install the Ubuntu desktop version instead of the server version. (For work, I need a back-up desktop machine on occasion, so I need a GUI. I do not want to buy two machines.)\n\nA: First, we all would suggest you to use 16.04 LTS version. It has great amount of improvements over its predecessors and also very suitable for SSD. (16.04 has default TRIM function for SSDs.)\nIf you are planning to use RAID10 I would suggest mdadm tool as an OS based RAID software. It competes very well against hardware RAID, performs better than cheap RAID cards, and is supported very well on Ubuntu. (mdadm works better than hardware RAID with consumer grade hardware).\nRAID10 is a good choice since it gives you fast access times and a copy of your data. It does make a difference when accessing/writing files in large numbers or when working with big files. Improvement in transfer speed can be ~1.5 to 2 times with double the number of disks (but access speed also depends on cached data hence can be confusing to compare that without cleared cache). You can go through this page for detailed benchmarks (raid benchmarks on Ubuntu).\nUbuntu would treat the RAID array as any other drive and its spin down times can be modified by the user. It is suggested to use noatime parameter in fstab to prevent spin-down. This is good since spinning down and spinning up reduces the lifetime of the drive considerably. (most server configurations suggest not to play with spin up/down times but just buy drives with low power consumption).\nI see no problems with your plan of OS on SSD and RAID10 array for storage. Good luck. \n\nfstab\nfstab is a file in which the drives which would be mounted automatically during boot are mentioned and several parameters of those drives are controlled there. You can read more about fstab here fstab at Ubuntu community wiki\nOnce you create RAID10 array you would list it in the fstab file and then save the file. There you will need to specify noatime for never spin down function.\n", "Q: fglrx works on Ubuntu 12.10 (32-bit), but not Ubuntu 12.10 (64-bit) on the same computer.

Since lshw is a command line utility, it will work best with sudo.\nAlso, in the link that you've mentioned, one of the person has posted the use of --.\nit tells the app to stop reading options.

He's still running it but somewhere along the way, he started having trouble with his nvidia drivers and seemingly his whole system.  Remotely, I've been trying to help him start from scratch and install fresh with 12.10.  The problem is that his CD-rom is broken, and his BIOS will not allow him to boot from external media, i.e., usb cd/dvd rom and/or usb flash drives.  Space on his system partition was very low but has deleted enough to give him just over a gig.  I thought the best solution would be to boot from a local iso file through grub2.  However, his system hasn't been updated/upgraded to grub2, he is still using the legacy version.  We can't seem to upgrade him because, well, I guess you could say apt-get is (broken?) and apt-get -f install isn't fixing it.  We can't remove or add packages until this is resolved.

I had been struggling with Chromium Java and I gave up using Chromium while ago.  And now it's working.  I'm not sure when and where this fix has been done. \n(Update on Feb 18, 2014) Recent update on Java to update 51 causes Live Meeting to stop saying \"Security Permission errors\".  This time, we need to change the security lever pulling down to \"Medium\" instead of \"High\".\n(Update as of June 30, 2014) Java update 60 has no change.  Continue to put the security level as \"Medium\" in Java plugin conrol panel.\n(update on July 20, 2014) Java updated 65, but no change in above.\n(update on September 9, 2014) Java updated 67.

I have enabled verbose mode in grub2, but I see nothing on the screen.\nOr sometimes in low resolution mode.\nHowever, sometimes it boots correctly and prints all the things at startup.\nAnd sometimes it gets stuck after printing \"detecting usb number 3...\"\nMy system is a Lenovo u410 with Ubuntu 12.04. I have installed bumblebee, and it works fine (I tried it with optirun). I have checked the pci devices, and both my graphic cards are known. I think there is a problem with my usb 3.0\n\nA: I reinstalled my ubuntu again. And this time I did not install mesa-utils. (for showing my intel GPU name in system details)\nAfter that I installed bumblebee to support optimus technology.

Can I Install the 32bit version from this download or will I need to download the 32bit version? \n\nA: You will have to download the 32-bit version. The 64-bit version is functionally identical, but contains binary files which are entirely different.\n\nA: Basically - no, you cannot install a 64bit O/S on a 32bit host.\nThe O/S image has been compiled specifically to the processor architecture.\nIn the murky world of virtualisation, it is possible to run a 64bit O/S virtual image on a 32bit host - this is explained in the linked question.\nThus - if you are using a 32bit O/S such as Windows 7 - then install virtualbox and then install the 64bit O/S.\nSince you mentioned you have an old computer - this may not be appropriate since you may be short of resources in terms of CPU strength, RAM, disk-space etc.\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use virtualbox with a 64 Bit image in a 32 bit host\n\nA: You will need to download the 32-bit version and install that.\nNewer processors are 64-bit capable and you can install either the 64-bit version or the 32-bit.  The 64-bit version is recommended because it makes better use of the processor.  It can handle wider numbers and has more registers so these can be used to produce faster code.\nIf you try to do it the other way around it just wont work as a 32-bit processor won't understand 64-bit code.\nAs a side issue since  you have an \"old computer\" you may want to consider a lighter variant such as Xubuntu. This will run faster on older hardware and is also supported here.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One: File Sync in Progress on Mac I use Ubuntu One on Windows, Ubuntu and Mac computers. I've not had any issue with UbuntuOne on the windows or Ubuntu machine and it has been file for months on the Mac until yesterday. Now it stalls at the File Sync In Progress and doesn't do anything. I have tried disconnecting and reconnecting.\n\nA: more information is necessary to figure out what's going on - could you please contact support via https://one.ubuntu.com/help/contact/ ?\nIf the Ubuntu One Client is behaving strangely, disconnecting and reconnecting is not likely to help much - quitting the app (from the menubar icon to quit the background processes too) and restarting is more likely to help. Rebooting may also clear up any processes that have become unresponsive, if you can reboot.\nIf none of that helps, our support people can help you fix things.\n", "Q: How can I run SSH as a different user on the same Ubuntu installation? I am creating a script which runs a series of command that would download a website to a machine and sets up everything.\nSo most of the commands require root access. For example adding a vhost in /etc/apache2/sites-available, enabling it, restarting apache, etc...\nSo in order to do that, I need to run the script with sudo.\nsudo ./install-website.sh\n\nThe website is located on a server with a git repository which is setup with a password-less SSH access. But that only works for the user dan since the keys are in my home folder and not in the root's home folder.\nSo when it reaches this part:\ngit clone user@host.com:git-repo $PATH_TO_INSTALLATION\n\nSince I started the script with sudo, the user that is trying to initiate the git command is root. So the host keeps asking for the host's user's password.\nI have tried the following command:\nsudo -u $SUDO_USER git clone user@host.com:git-repo $PATH_TO_INSTALLATION\n\nBut it was still asking for the host's user's password.\nIs it possible to tell sudo to use the $SUDO_USER's home path?\nMost of the stuff are variables, and have to be variables as I will run this on more than 1 machine.\n\nA: Alternative 1 - Configuring sudo\nSudo is configure in the sudoers file which you should only edit through the visudo command.\nThis configuration file can override certain environment variables with the option env_reset. How to proceed:\nvisudo\n\nThen find a line that states:\nDefaults env_reset \n\nand add after it (e.g. example with the HOME environement):\nDefaults env_keep = \"HOME\"\n\nThis example is for every sudo configuration you may have. You can also specify it on a per user/group basis. See sudoers manual page.\nAlternative 2 - configuring SSH\nYou can use the configuration file of SSH to specify users, key to use, etc. I have explain that at SuperUser.\nProposed solution (but you will have to correct the missing and assumed bits), edit the file /root/.ssh/config and set its permission chmod 0600 /root/.ssh/config:\nHost host.com\n  User dan\n  IdentityFile /home/dan/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nThen as root, you can do the next command and it will use the proper SSH identifications:\ngit clone host.com:git-repo $PATH_TO_INSTALLATION\n\n\nA: Since the script is running as root, it can su straight to the unpriviliged user. Roots don't need to sudo, sudo is for lusers ;-).\nAssuming the unprivileged user is dan, and $PATH_TO_INSTALLATION is set in the surrounding script:\nsu -lc \"git clone user@host.com:git-repo $PATH_TO_INSTALLATION\" dan\n\nNote that $PATH_TO_INSTALLATION must be writable by dan.\n\nA: When I generated my ssh key a long time ago with ssh-keygen, I didn't choose the default path ~/.ssh/id_rsa. Thanks to zwets' comment, I remmebered that. I changed my key, and put it in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.\nNow both of the commands work:\n\n\n*\n\n*With sudo\nsudo -u $SUDO_USER git clone user@host.com:git-repo $PATH_TO_INSTALLATION\n\n\n*As suggested in zwets' answer\nsu -lc \"git clone user@host.com:git-repo $PATH_TO_INSTALLATION\" $SUDO_USER\n\n", "Q: How do I use ffmpeg's -filter_complex I am using FFmpeg version SVN-r0.5.9-4:0.5.9-0ubuntu0.10.04.3 and it doesn't allow me to use -filter_complex.\nIt shows:\nffmpeg: unrecognized option '-filter_complex'\n\nI want to overlay 2 videos, how can I get that option?\n\nA: Too old\nYour version is way too old, and in fact I don't think it even supports any filters if I recall correctly.

I am setting up an Openstack cloud based on MAAS and Juju. Once I have this cloud ready then is it possible to Run different operating systems on this cloud or its limited to Ubuntu OS only. Remember I am not talking about Base OS used by MAAS but the operating system that I am gonna use later in 'i think' Openstack dash board or somewhere on top of this cloud. \nI have got some tiny OS that I want to RUN on this cloud so is that possible or Ubuntu Cloud Infrastructure does not support any other operating system then Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can run any OS that is supported by KVM and by your CPU. Examples are for a typical x86_64 CPU: most of the BSD family, most Linux based Distro, Windows, etc.\nNote that some OS have requirements, so you need to be able to cover those when setting up a VM to be able to run the OS.\n\nA: MAAS and Juju are designed to deploy the Ubuntu operating system primarily. You will able to successfully use MAAS and Juju to run your Openstack cloud. As Huygens mentioned, you will be able to create VMs that running many different operating systems.\nHowever, Juju is designed to deploy VMs that run an Ubuntu operating systems. This means that if you want to use the juju command to deploy VMs and VM clusters, they will have to be using the Ubuntu operating system. \nFracisco Souza of Globo.com, Brazil's largest TV network, has posted info on how Globo has modified Juju to be able to deploy CentOS.

If I create a proper LiveCD and run the OS from the disc does it save any information on a hard-drive or is it ALL saved to the PC's memory? I've looked around for a clear, direct \"yes/no\" answer to this question but I can't seem find it anywhere. Common sense would say yes but you never know and what I need to do requires an OS that does not use Flash(usb) or Magnetic(hd) storage of any kind while in operation.\n\nA: From the answers to this question, we can safely believe that no data is stored on the hard disk unless we choose to save it to hard disk(persistence).  \nAs for a definitve answer check out this post on stackoverflow which explains that it is a ramdisk.\nQuoting from the Stackoverflow answer to the above said question:\n\nBelieve it or not, it's a ramdisk :) All live distros mount a\n  temporary hard disk in RAM memory. The process is completely\n  user-transparent and is all because of the magic of Linux kernel.\nThe OS, in fact, first allocates an area of your RAM memory into a\n  virtual device, then mounts it as a regular hard drive in your file\n  system.\nOnce you reboot, you lose all your data from that ramdrive.\n\nFor more detailed information regarding this, check out the Wikipedia article on Live Cd explaining the technique of its working.\n\nA: Booting an Ubuntu live session from a live CD will not be able to write data on a harddrive unless the drive was mounted.\nBut there is a caveat to this in case you are concerned about data security issues.\nIf you boot your live CD on a system with an existing swap partition the live environment may also use this as swap. We therefore have to disable swap after booting the live environment.

I checked few programs such as htop or top command but couldn't find any features for logging per minute.\nIs there a way to do that for tracking memory issues ?\nedit: I was using linode and decided to use Longview. \n\n\nA: Install and configure the sysstat package, which does just what you're asking for.\nsudo apt-get install sysstat\n\n\nA: If I were doing this I'd probably script something up with RRDtool.\nRRDtool is something that is built for interval-based data-collection and then building graphs off the back of the data. If you've ever seen a netgraph on an ISPs control panel, it was probably done with RRDtool.\nHow you implement it is up to you. There are \"pure\" bash solutions with cron but there are also nice Python and Perl options floating around out there too:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/icc/rrdtool-bash-scripts/blob/master/memory.sh\nAs far as I can see, this updates an image in a set location. That could be on your webserver or scrobbled away over NFS into your homedir.\n\n*http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.co.uk/2008/05/python-rrdpy-round-robin-databases.html\nThis holds its own timer and does pretty much whatever you like. I prefer this to bash because it's easier to poke around but whatever floats your boat. It's probably harder for a non-Pythoneer to get set up.\nIf you want a lot more than this, check out Munin. This uses RRDtool prolifically to log a whole load of system data and generates static HTML pages at a set interval.\n\nA: There is one more way to do this.  By using cron jobs we can get this.\n* * * * * username /path/to/./script.sh\n\nthe script is simply \n#!/bin/bash\necho \"$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S) $(free -mt | awk 'END{print $4}')\" >> ~/memlog.txt\n\nbefore placing the script do \nchmod +x script.sh\n\nso create above script and do it as I said then place the script at /usr/bin location . then open your /etc/crontab with \nsudo nano /etc/crontab\n\nand place the first line there . That script executes for every minute and gives memory details for every minute .\nSo finally that log.txt file will hold the Memory log details for every minute.\nand I have got one more useful information for you that \nwatch cat log.txt will show the log.txt file in terminal and it will update the content live.so in the current terminal it self with one time typing you can have live watch of the log.txt file.\n\nA: vmstat -S M 60 would do (in megabytes).\nYou only have to remember that actually free RAM is \"free + cache + buf\".\nFor logging purpose it might have sense to print it out time stamped which can be accomplished in various ways, for e. g.:\nvmstat -nS M 60 | while read _vmstat; do echo $(date --rfc-3339=seconds) $_vmstat; done\n\nA: Here my trick.

Are there any projects out there working to add touch sensitivity to Grub2?  \nIf not what touch libraries exist in Ubuntu 13.04 that may be a possible candidates to implement this after integrating?\n\nEdit: March 14, 2013 @ 5:10PM PST\nI have been searching hard and have found the following packages under Ubuntu 13.04:\n\n\n*\n\n*muTouch  ( I believe this came from uTouch, an older package that Ubuntu used to use. )\n\n*libfile-touch-perl\n\n*tslib\n\n*pymt\n\n*touchegg\n\n*libframe6\nI will be going through these and hopefully come up with a answer soon.  If you are familiar with any of these libraries a reply would be beautiful.  In my brief passing of each of these it seemed that tslib and pymt as they are not platform dependant like grub.\n\nA: I was able to ask Stephen Webb who currently leads the Unity Technical Team about touch input. I contacted him because he used to be the lead developer on the uTouch-geis package which was split into three different packages Frame, Geis, and Grail.  These are the primary touch screen controls for 13.04 and he is also heavily involved in other multi-touch projects. I asked him about learning more about touch device input and my idea.  Here is what he had to say:\n\nI want to have Grub2 register a single tap event, no more (multi touch not needed-I think).  Purpose would be to select from the boot menu. \n\nYou're going to have a challenge getting touch to work from boot\n  loader code.\nMany (but not all) touch input devices have device drivers that work\n  to the Microsoft HID protocol.  You'd need to replicate that driver\n  technology into GRUB2, and then figure out how to map that into\n  something GRUB2 would understand as input.  Sounds like work.\n\nIs there any resources you can lead me to that would help me understand how touch devices work?\n\nThat's complicated.  There's a lot of different technologies,\n  connected to the host in different ways, talking different protocols,\n  delivering different data.\nThere's some good documentation here.\n\nAre there any single tap libraries you can suggest or multi touch one? Do you have any other suggestions on how to move forward?\n\nWell, in the Linux stack there's the firmware in the touch processor,\n  which feeds data to the device driver in the kernel, which translates\n  into the evdev protocol, which is read by the x.org driver and\n  converted into the XI2 protocol, or if there's nothing looking for XI2\n  touch events, then converts that into an XI mouse event, and an X11\n  event gets sent to the client.  All you have at the boot loader level\n  is direct input from the touch processor.\n\n", "Q: How to configure and run hadoop cluster on LVM(Logical Volume Manager) Well i am new to the concepts of LVM(Local Volume Manager) and have create volumes in Ubuntu\nActually I am using windows and putty.Now i have also created LVM in that putty. \nMy question is whether it is possible to configure and run hadoop cluster in LVM(Logical Volume Manager) and if yes how to do it\n\nA: check this one, it looks lvm can help avoid some maintenance hassle with trade-off some performance\nhttp://nicktj.tumblr.com/post/10201994102/hadoop-on-lvm2\n", "Q: Firefox multi-core when opening a list of bookmarks? Is there a way to configure Firefox to use all available cores when opening a list of bookmarks?\nFor example, if I open a list of 10 bookmarks in one go, I would like Firefox to use all 4 cores available in my Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit laptop to speed up the rendering of the pages. But it seems like the only 1 core is used of the processor use in the System Monitor Widget.\nDo I need to explicitly configure this in any way? According to Google, Firefox got multi-core improvements in the last 2 years. I am using version 19 but also downloaded version 20, so far with same results.\nPS: I am not sure if this question is Ubuntu or Linux-specific, so if it is generic enough to Firefox that would make it more adequate to go to superuser.com or elsewhere, please let me know.\n\nA: Most \"advanced\" configuration settings are available via about:config. (Just for completeness, this is accessed by typing about:config in the address bar, pressing Enter and accepting the caution.)  \nNow, the about:config page itself has a filter field: when I typed core in there, all I got was services.sync.globalScore;0. When I typed cpu, I drew a blank. And this is with Firefox 20 on a humble Dell Inspiron 1545 dual core machine.\nIf you can think of something more suitable to type into about:config, do try. There are additional custom entries that can be made in about:config but you may have to ask in mailing lists such as support-firefox -- Firefox help community or dev-apps-firefox -- Development discussion about Firefox for help on such advanced options.

Using empathy and \"people nearby\" in Ubuntu 12.04, my contacts appears twice. \nThis bothers me, how can I correct this ?\n\nA: This is due to avahi which will probe ipv6 and ipv4 network as you can see with:\navahi-browse -t _presence._tcp\n\nEach user presence is broadcasted in ipv6 and ipv4.\nThus, if you don't need ipv6, you can set ipv6 to no in /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf.

In this case VMWare 4's documentation (that you're citing) is 10 years old. Ignore it.\nAlso, if you need database performance, you don't want to be emulating anything.\nEven a \"raw\" disk in VMWare is going through a virtual (read: emulated) disk controller. That's better than going through a virtual disk controller and then VMFS and then NTFS - but only just.\nI'll be frank, your options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install MySQL in Windows. I haven't tried it for yonks, but I believe it still works. Even if you keep the virtualised environment that interacts with the database, this would be better for high IO applications.\n\n*Dump or virtualise Windows, make Ubuntu the host. If your main application is Linux-based, ditch windows or at least kick it to a portion of the system that doesn't require much in the way of resources.\n\n*Move the database disk onto another disk controller and set VMWare to pass that through. I'm not sure if you can do this with the Workstation variants but \"passthrough\" is a good way to give VMs real native access to hardware. The overhead is fairly minimal too but it doesn't always work and it does require extra hardware if you only have one bus.\n\n*Split the system into two (or more) bare-metal installations.\n", "Q: Why did I stop getting Thunderbird email notifications?

In actuality the alert was working, only it was inaudible. From a terminal session I ran 'sudo pavucontrol'. I selected the 'Playback Tab' then adjusted the 'System Sounds' slider to midway between 'Silence' and '100%(0db)'.

I had some issues with ImageMagick and I was told Ubuntu's default ImageMagick package is an ancient version and I should upgrade to resolve my issues.\nHow can I do that? I have the latest Ubuntu version (12.10). Synaptic shows me 8:6.7.7.10-2ubuntu4 as the latest version of IM. It means my IM version is 6.7.7.10 (convert --version outputs the same). IM does not provide deb binaries itself. Debian has something newer, but in some testing/experimental branches if I understand it well. I found IM on Launchpad, but there are no instructions how to add this to my sources, it seems it is not one of the usual PPAs I meet when searching for the latest/beta software. I don't know how to work with this one.\nIs there a way how to mark a package to be taken from some bleeding edge sources and leave the rest of my system to be taken from standard sources? It would be probably the best to upgrade to the last stable version of IM (6.8), but that is probably sci-fi as it is not even in Debian. However, I need at least 6.7.9.\n\nNote: I want to avoid compilation from source. I hate having installed something and not being able to manipulate with it easily with apt-get or Synaptic. Moreover, there are no updates for compiled programs. Always I compile I feel like going against the system, like using glue, wires and duck tape. No, I do not want to compile it for sure.\n\nA: Please Note: Even though Honza initially said that he did not want to compile, we discussed using checkinstall to install the compiled package in the comments above. That was just what Honza wanted, as programs installed with checkinstall can be removed like any other package with the package manager.\n\nAs we are installing to /opt using checkinstall after the build, we can leave the original imagemagick package in place. (Infact, install the repository version if it is not already installed.) The dependencies can be left installed, and they are no different for the most recent version of imagemagick. What we need to do is install the build dependencies and some other tools first of all:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall && sudo apt-get build-dep imagemagick\n\nDownload the source code from the official site and, using terminal, cd to where the source package is and extract it:\ntar -xzvf ImageMagick-6.8.3-9.tar.gz\n\nNow move to that folder with\ncd Imagemagick-6.8.3-9\n\nNow, if you want to find out the available options for the build, run\n./configure --help\n\nHowever, mostly everything is already set to enabled, so there is little need to specify anything further, apart from the necessary --prefix. You could use other locations, but we shall use /opt here. Now run configure and make:\n./configure --prefix=/opt/imagemagick-6.8 && make\n\nNow, the last thing to do is to use checkinstall to install the package. Make sure you are in the Imagemagick-6.8.3-9 folder and run\nsudo checkinstall\n\nYou can of course run checkinstall with parameters such as --pkgversion= or choose them after you have run sudo checkinstall, but all the defaults are fine here. The package name that will be created will be called imagemagick-6.8.3-9 and it will be installed in /opt/imagemagick-6.8.\nYou will now be also able to see the package in Synaptic and manage it just like any other packages, and removing it will not cause problems with other packages.\nIf you want to run your new versions, you will need to use /opt/imagemagick-6.8/convert, for example, as /opt is not in $PATH, and just running convert will call the repo version. You could create some symlinks if you wanted to always run the /opt version of the programs.\nPlease note that this is what Honza wanted, even though he initially was averse to compiling, until checkinstall was discussed. \n\nA: Nowadays you can get an AppImage for ImageMagick (here). You only need to mark the file as executable, with chmod +x magick, for instance, and then put the file in some folder belonging to your PATH (issue the comand echo $PATH valid folders). I usually put these files under $HOME/.local/bin.\nOf course, these operations can also be done via graphical utilities such as Nautilus, if you do not want to use the terminal.\nWith this approach, you're effectively \"installing without compiling\". Please note that you must have FUSE and libc (which is already the case in many Linux distributions).\nAssuming you have wget, you can use these commands:\ncd ~\nwget https://download.imagemagick.org/ImageMagick/download/binaries/magick\nchmod +x magick\nmkdir -p ~/.local/bin\nmv magick ~/.local/bin \n\n", "Q: What does it mean that my GPU is running 0 ops per second I am currently running an Ubuntu 12.04 laptop built by System76.

I need to connect to my computer remotely(all ports), but that ip changes. I have everthing figured out on how the comp woukd know my current ip, but i don't know how to add an ip on all ports and remove that ip (dynamic ip so I'll remove one and add a new one). Don't i need to save the changes during commands?\nFor the people answering, i already have a no-ip account, and the computer checks that to see when it changes. All i have to do now is add the new ip and remove the old one. Also i have my router allow only the ports i need.Thanks for trying though.\n\nA: To answer your question, the IP you get is assigned by your ISP.  You have to contact them to get your IP to be held as \"static\" and that may cost you additional money.\nAs for access after that, you're looking at just having to port-forward relevant ports in your router. and open the firewall for those ports on the target machine.\n\nA: The best way to go about doing this is with a system like No-Ip, I use this personally on my MediaPC here at the home. This automatically updates your IP when it changes to no-ip's system and sets the subdomain there to your new IP.\nThe initial account is free to setup, and some routers actually have no-ip in their config, so no need for software on PC.\nNow for software on PC they do offer Daemon based software:\nInit.d startup script not working for No-IP\nI had set this up myself as well. You can download their software from here:\nhttp://www.noip.com/downloads.php?page=linux\nThen setup the Daemon upstart script as I did in the post above and all works perfect at startup. I have it checking every 10 minutes myself.\nThe other thing that needs to be done is you need to go into your Modem or Router (depending on your ISP) and set Port Forwarding. For instance I use plex on my Media PC. So to connect from the outside I have to tell my router to forward port 32400 which is the plex default port to XXXX port on the outside world. I use another port than 32400 so it's not default.\nThis Port Forwading is crucial as it allows incoming access from the outside of our Router through the ISP.\nNow for most Routers they do not have a * for port forwarding, you must do each port manually. They do this for security, the only real way to allow all ports is set your Router up with no firewall or on some routers DMZ zones will allow all port forwarding, other routers it does not, it only disables filtering. You would need to check your routers manual to know if DMZ allows all port forwarding for your model.\nA few links on setting up basic port forwarding for a router.\nhttp://www.cctvcamerapros.com/DLink-Port-Forwarding-Setup-s/119.htm\nhttp://www.wikihow.com/Port-Forward/Open-Ports-on-a-Linksys-Router\nhttp://foscam.us/blog/foscamipcameras/guide-to-port-forwarding-netgear-router/\nNow a quick solution is in some routers they will allow port ranges, for this you would enter port 1 as the first port and 65534 as the end range, this would allow ALL ports to forward to X ip address from the outside. This is again on some routers only, the cheaper ones or routers locked down by your ISP will only allow single port forwards.\n\nOnce changes are done most routers do require you to restart your router for changes to take effect, most new routers will ask you to do this and restart using software. If not you must unplug your router for a few seconds then plug back in after saving changes.\n\nA: sudo iptables -I INPUT -i eth1 -s $currip -j ACCEPT\n\nAdds an IP\nsudo iptables -D INPUT -i eth1 -s $lastip -j ACCEPT\n\nRemoves an IP\nTested\nThanks to those who tried.

I'm working with very wide windows that are longer than my screen width. \nWhen I'm in my office I use two monitors (laptop + external monitor) and such windows are spreaded over this extended desktop.\nWhen I'm using my laptop only and I move the wide window behind the edge of workspace 1, part of it disapears, but does not appear in workspace 2. \nI believe there is should be a feature that joins workspaces and makes a sort of extended desktop, but I did not find it. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.\nI will appreciate any suggestion.\nThank you!  \n\nA: You cannot do this with GNOME Classic (no effects) because it uses metacity as the window manager, which uses actual workspaces, and not viewports, as compiz does. I don't think there is any way to do that with metacity either. If however, you switch to using compiz, either by using GNOME Classic with effects, or the standard Ubuntu session with Unity (3d), then you will get the behavior you desire.\nYou can use compiz as the window manager, and simply turn off the extra effects which are enabled by default, in the configuration, as well; if they are annoying for you.\n", "Q: How to run a nested accelerated xserver?

The Problem is, when I restart my Laptop, the system showed up a secure boot menu (to choose between Win7 or Ubuntu), after I click into Ubuntu, the system did not demand me to set up any Partition...\nSo, I am kind of messed up now, I don't know what is the Limit Disk Space for Ubuntu and Windows 7. How do I set up partition after I dual boot it\nPlease help me, kindly reply to me ASAP... Thanks!\n\nA: Installing using Wubi, is just like installing any windows application, so no partitioning is done.  \nWubi allows you to install Ubuntu easily in the same fashion you’d use to install any other software program in Windows. It doesn't require the creating of another partition.\nIf you want to install Ubuntu in its own partition, then you'd uninstall it, just like a windows program, and then download Ubuntu, put it on a DVD or USB flash drive, and follow the instructions described here.\n\nA: Your mention of Secure Boot makes me think you're running a UEFI system. The last I heard, WUBI was incompatible with UEFI. Thus, if I'm correct, you should remove any files created by your attempt to set up WUBI and begin again with a standard dual-boot configuration.\n", "Q: Dell D520 getting hot | 12.10 I know the my laptop is quite hot when it was in win7, but after I changed OS (ubuntu 12.04), I notice that it gets even hotter. \nI also notice that when it gets hotter, it's starting to act slow :( ..

Well, assuming bash is installed... but it should be :-)\nBash implicitly support per-user customization though various resource files it reads on startup: ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, as well as some global files as well. \nFamiliarize yourself with bash's startup procedure here: Bash Reference Startup files. This will tell you where to put what so that your bash environment behaves they way you expect (especially the differences between interactive, login and non-interactive/non-login shells which can trip up anyone).\nThen, The Bash Hackers Wiki seems like a good source for learning about everything else concerning bash.\nAlso, though, you might consider the Z-Shell: ZSH and it's thorough community setup up Oh My Zsh. Oh My Zsh can get you quite far along the customization path with little effort.\nThere are others as well: The Korn shell (tsh), T-shell (tcsh) and others. \n\nA: All of the command line utilities you mention (bash, tmux, vim), and many others, run a dotfile in your home directory as part of their start-up sequence. Traditionally, these dotfiles were called after the name of the command with rc appended. So vim has .vimrc, bash has .bashrc and tmux has ... you get the pattern. If my memory serves me, the rc suffix stands for run commands.\nIf you want to persist your settings for any of these tools, put them in the rc-file. For instance, to enable syntax highlighting in vim, add syntax on to ~/.vimrc. The man pages for the tools usually document the format of the rc-file (for bash it is plain bash, vim has its information in its online help :help vimrc). If you want to carry your settings to another machine, just copy the dotfiles over, or indeed put them under version control at Github.\nDotfiles are part of Unix lore and if you search the internet you'll find the most elaborate examples of things you can do with them. There actually is a place on Github for dotfile fanatics to share their inventions with others: Github does dotfiles.

I have a live USB that can sucsessfully boot on another machine.\nWhen I boot, i can get to the grub menu. However, when I select any of the options, \"Try ubuntu without installing\" for example, i get a dark screen and the OS doesn't boot. My only option at that point is to power off.\nHas anyone else had this issue? I've researched everywhere I can think of. Any ideas what might be wrong?\nThanks for the help.\n\nA: Aside from all of the obvious things that one can read from the internet about booting from USB on the Surface Pro (i.e. hold down volume button, disable secure boot, etc.), there are a few important things that you need to do to the USB drive before your Surface Pro will boot from it.  Why these things are frequently ignored on the \"how to boot from USB on your Surface Pro\" websites, I don't know.  Anyway, here's what you need to know about the media you're trying to boot.\n1. The Surface Pro will ONLY boot from disks that are partitioned with a GPT partition scheme AND configured for a UEFI firmware interface.  So, if your Surface seems to be ignoring your attempts to boot from USB and going straight into Windows 8, this is likely your problem.  Unlike just about every other computer sold today, the Surface has no support for legacy boot. In other words, that USB stick that boots just fine on every other computer in the world (except your Surface) is likely partitioned with an MBR scheme and/or designed for a BIOS firmware interface.\n2. The Surface Pro will only boot 64 bit operating systems.  In my experience, when trying to boot a 32 bit OS, things will look like they're booting properly for a little while, and then crash, and then boot into Windows 8.  Take note, this is different from what happens when it's issue #1 is preventing you from booting from your USB.\n3. The Surface Pro will only boot from partitions that are formatted in FAT32 (and possibly FAT16 and FAT12 - I've never tried booting a FAT16 or FAT12 partition and have read conflicting reports as to what is possible with the Surface.)  This is a condition of UEFI boot.  If you're trying to boot a disk formatted in NTFS, ext3, ext4, etc. it won't work.\nYour probably saying to yourself, \"Great, now that I know the rules, how to I make my drive conform?\".  If you have a drive that doesn't meet the above rules, you may or many not even be able to make it conform.  I'll let someone else tackle that hurdle.\nHowever, if you have an .iso file that you want to make bootable from your USB, you just need to do the following:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the .iso file is for a 64 bit OS\n\n*Download Rufus (http://rufus.akeo.ie/) and use it to create your bootable USB.  Be sure to select \"GPT partition scheme for UEFI computer\".  There may be other programs out there, but Rufus is the only one I've found that sets up the partitioning properly for the Surface.\n\n*Make sure secure boot is disabled on your Surface.\n\n*Power down the Surface, hold the volume button down and power the Surface up while continuing to hold the volume button down.\n\n\nVoila!\n\nA: I discovered a solution to my particular issue:\nThe Surface Pro has 3 ways of booting to a USB:\n\n\n*\n\n*Accessing the \"Advanced Startup\" menu in Windows 8\n\n*Holding SHIFT while booting/re-booting (this takes you to the same place as #1)\n\n*Holding the Down Volume button while booting (boots directly to the USB)\n\n\nThe first two options allow me to get to the grub menu but then freeze when I make one of the selections (see my original post above). However, if I power down the device then boot while holding the Volume Down button (on the side of the Surface Pro) I am able to progress past the grub menu and boot successfully to the OS.\nSo, for anyone interested, my successful process from start to finish was this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Live USB with Ubuntu 12.10\n\n*From a powered-down state, hold UP volume key and power on\n\n*In the resulting menu disable Secure Boot and then exit\n\n*Power on the device, plug in the USB and then power down\n\n*Power on again while holding the Volume Down button and then proceed through boot process\n\n\nHope someone finds this useful and thanks again to those who offered help.\n\nA: Also turn on Legacy Boot if you can.  I haven't played with the Surface Pro but have worked on other UEFI boot devices (Dell XPS 12) and been able to get live boot distros to start.\nHere is some good info from the Community: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nGood luck.\n", "Q: How can I fully maximize wine applications?

I would like to get rid of this bar in wine either by integrating the two bars or omitting the wine bar. Does anyone know how to do this?\nI am aware of the askubuntu question at end, which is related, but slightly different.

The \"class=Wine\" attribute is set by wine on the windows it opens, and \"state=maxhorz\" matches any window that is horizontally maximized.  The exclamation point reverses the entire expression (e.g. windows have decorations if they're not maximized wine windows).\nIf you want to make sure that your setting catches any app that behaves this way and not just wine, you can simplify the decoration windows setting to just !state=maxhorz\n", "Q: virtualbox in Ubuntu host no internet connection My hair is in fire trying to make Internet connection work in guest OS. \nI have Ubuntu 12.10 machine with VirtualBox 4.1.18 installed from Ubuntu Software Center\nI set PC-BSD and FreeBSD to work as GuestOS\nNow both GuestOS have no internet connection.

From this point on, VirtualBox (not Ubuntu) handles the traffic from the guest out to the network. As far as Ubuntu is concerned, VirtualBox is just another application using the network. It's no different from e.g. Firefox.\nThe NAT-ting, DHCP-ing and communicating with the guest is purely VirtualBox's business. Assuming VirtualBox works, what this means is that you'll need to solve this issue at the BSD end.

Here is my story:  I loaded Ubuntu 10.04 some time back.  I tried version 11 and hated it.  So I went back to 10.04.  Over time Canonical informed me that they would stop supporting it and I declined all requests for upgrades and new installations.  It was working fine - if it's not broke, don't fix it (my reasoning).  Okay a little more time passes by and I install version 12.10 onto my girlfriend's computer and ... wow what an amazing software.  Okay so now I'm impressed and I decide to upgrade my 10.04.  The worst mistake.  For starters there is no longer an upgrade feature in the \"software centre\".  So I go the route of getting a CD prepared and do the upgrade.  My computer has totally crashed.  No matter what I do, Ubuntu won't load up.  Something appears to be wrong with corrupted \"squashfs files\". Now for the real freaky part.  It appears a series of files on my 10.04 are corrupt and I cannot format my hard drive and start from scratch, even when I try load up from the CD/DVD.  Simply put Ubuntu won't work.\nNow for the freaky stuff:  So I had 10.04 for quite a long while and I was able to disconect all the requests for software upgrades and disconnect any \"searching for new software\".  In essence my software Centre went dead as far as looking for software.  For one or other reason I installed NetHogs which allowed me to check who (if anyone) is using my internet connection.  I saw it register my name every time I connected to the internet (whether email or internet surfing), but I was stumped to see that \"root\" would log onto the net and go to some site described by numbers at strange hours of the night or morning.  Is it posible that someone hacked into my Ubuntu?  Or did Canonical use their \"root\" status to log into my computer?  Is it possible I got a virus on Ubuntu?\nWhat ever the story, I wish I could simply format my hard drive and start from scratch.  Can anyone help?\n\nA: You're trying to upgrade from an LTS version to a version beyond the next LTS version.\nFor the sake of others looking to upgrade from 10.04 - there's no direct upgrade path to 12.10 (it's basically like trying to upgrade your Windows 2000 machine to Windows 8). You have to upgrade to 12.04 (the next LTS version), and then upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10.\nThat said, at this point, you probably should do a clean install (which actually isn't a bad idea, even if you hadn't already mucked up your system, due to the major jump in versions that you're doing). If you have stuff to back up, you can do so from the LiveCD and back it up to a USB drive or networked location. Once that's done, just tell Ubuntu to wipe your drive and install the latest version and you should be golden.\nIf you run into the same problem with the CD you have, try burning a new CD. You may even want to try downloading from a different source (ie - if you did the direct download, try the torrent). \n", "Q: Run Ubuntu Alongside my current OS(Windows Vista) I would like to run Ubuntu alongside my current OS.

Everything works fine bunt when i logout the program causes an internal error ( Something with X Display ... i don't remember exact ). It's the same error i get when i connect without ' -Y'. \nSo what can i do if i want to logout and keep the X-Server running? or is it something else?\nThank You for Your help!\n\nA: Running the script with an ampersand behind it means that it will be backgrounded in the shell. So, it is still running even though you get a prompt. (Type jobs at that prompt and you will see it.)\nTo not get the error when exiting the ssh session, either foreground the script first by typing fg at the prompt, then stop it with Ctrl+C, or stop it by typing kill %1 at the prompt.\n", "Q: Intel hd3000 with HDMI output causes USB mouse and keyboard conflicts? I really don't know where to look for help with this problem, so I'm starting here.\nI am running a clean install of 12.10, on Gigabyte z68a-dh3-b3 mobo, Core i5 2500K, integrated Intel HD 3000 (Sandy Bridge). Dual Monitor setup; Samsung (1440x900) on DVI and Acer (HD 1080p) on HDMI.\nWhenever the HDMI output is \"active\", i.e. Acer screen configured \"On\" in Display Settings, my wireless keyboard and mouse are very unresponsive - characters dropped while typing, and mouse super slow. When I configure the Acer screen \"Off\", everything immediately returns to normal.\nThe questions I have are is this an Intel Graphics driver issue ? A USB issue ? An Xorg issue ? Just don't know where to start.\n\nA: There's some weirdness with Sandybridge graphics right now. I have a Mini-ITX AsRock Z68 board + a 2500k, and I use the iGPU with all three displays connected (VGA monitor + DVI  monitor + HDMI projector), with any one of them disabled at any given time since it can't drive all three at once. I too have some occasional stability issues that are hard to reproduce and aren't documented anywhere (though my wireless KB + mouse are fine).\n12.04 was fine, but since going to 12.10 things have been tricky, and I eventually switched to 13.04 sources about a month ago because I wasn't having any luck. I've had the best luck with kernel 3.8.06; hopefully this will get straightened out in the relase version of Raring.\n\nA: So I followed serilain's lead and moved on to 13.04, and confirm problem went away immediately. I cannot report if the solution was in the graphics driver, usb, or anything else.\n", "Q: Non-PAE system updating to PAE kernels? I just had an Ubuntu system of mine completely die on me after upgrading it and now I am confused.\nBasically, it is an older machine (Intel P3, 512MB RAM, etc) that I use as a command line only test bed. It's CPU does NOT support PAE extensions. PAE is mandatory when installing 12.04 LTS so what I basically did was install 11.10 x86 and then updated to 12.04 LTS and that worked fine. It even detected the CPU didn't support PAE, ignored the PAE kernels, and updated all the relevant non-PAE packages correctly (including using non PAE kernels under 12.04 LTS). \nFast forward a few months as I hadn't used the thing so I wanted to update it. Did apt-get update and it listed a bunch of packages including a new kernel. At the top, it did saw something along the lines of \"these packages are being ignored\" and then listed several *PAE packages. So I proceeded with the update as everything it was going to do look OK to me, however, the update failed (see screenshot below) and now the machine won't even boot.\n\nWhat is going on? Is it not possible to update 12.04 LTS anymore on non-PAE machines? How come it tried to (seemingly) update *PAE packages when my CPU can't support them? I feel like this is the root of the problem but if you have any other idea's or suggestions, please mention them! \n\nA: I would not recommend Ubuntu for a PC with a non PAE core.  If you can get it to run performance is unlikely to be satisfactory.\nYou can however use Lubuntu 12.04 on non PAE systems.  Lubuntu is a much lighter desktop than Ubuntu but as you use it mainly from the command line it should be fine for your needs and its supported in this forum.\nDownload is here\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/12.04/release/\nLubuntu 12.10 requires a PAE however.\nIf you want to try installing Ubuntu 12.04 on a non PAE system however Take a look here.\n", "Q: iptables and skype Does anyone here use iptables with skype? The only way I have been able to get it working so far is to allow all the high ports- something like \niptables -A OUTPUT -p UDP --dport 1024:65535 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 1024:65535 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p UDP --dport 1024:65535 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 1024:65535 -j ACCEPT\n\nwhich is obviously less than ideal. The problem is as far as I can tell the ports skype uses are somewhat random. I was hoping it might be possible to allow application level firewalling by using setuid or setguid, for example\nsudo addgroup skypeGrp\nsudo usermod theUser -G skypeGrp\nsudo chgrp skypeGrp /usr/bin/skype\nchmod g+s /usr/bin/skype\niptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --gid-owner skypeGrp -j ACCEPT \n\nbut this didn't seem to work.\nPerhaps other have a better solution?\n\nA: Set it up to allow all outbound.  And then allow related/established as one of the first rules.\nSomething like:\n# Accept loopback & established/related connections\niptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n\n# Drop invalid on tcp\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP\n\n# Set default DROP policy\niptables -P INPUT DROP\niptables -P FORWARD DROP\n\n# But allow everything out\niptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT\n\n# Now set what you want to allow in.\n\n# e.g. SSH in\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n\n\nA: In my experience if you allow all outgoing trafic you can make calls but you cant receive calls from others unless you open a port for incoming connections.\nIn Skype 4.2.0.11\nGo to \nSkype > Options > Advanced > Connections\nYou can decide what port skype uses. It was 7004 by default.\nI think you need to allow both tcp and udp.\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 7004 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 7004 -j ACCEPT\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Google connection problem I have problem with connection to the Google services.

Could you try the following in a terminal ?\ntelnet accounts.google.com 80\n\nIf the connection to accounts.google.com establishes, enter :\nGET / HTTP/1.1\n\nAnd end the line with two line breaks.\nIf the answer comes almost immediately (it should say 302 Moved after the HTTP headers), then your computer is perfectly able of establishing a connection to the Google accounts services. If you get a timeout issue at this step, or before, then it is browser independent.\nIn this last case, I would recommend checking firewall and global network configuration. There's also the very unlikely case where your router has set up restrictions for your machine.\n", "Q: OS Uninstaller killed Windows 7, can't boot I used OS Uninstaller started from a live cd to remove old tries to install Ubuntu and Zorin(and 2 already installed Ubuntu distros), but now when I try to boot, the PC tells me there's no boot device.

Looking at the page source the characters that display correctly are simply é while those that do not are written as &eacute, &amp;eacute or &#233 (I think).\n\nA: Check the character codification settings. Open the menu Edit | Preferences and select the tab Content. There click on the Advanced... button under Fonts and Colors (highlighted in the image, below).\n\nThe Typography window will open and there you can check/adjust the character codification. Or perhaps you would need to change any of the other settings, like default fonts or not allowing webpages to show their own fonts.\n\n\nAnother possibility is that the Firefox is using the wrong character encoding for those webpages. You can check what character encoding (if any) those sites use by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting \"View page source\".\nYou might also want to check the settings under the menu View | Character encoding to see if the encoding selected corresponds to the one set by the webpage (here, whatever is selected would probably be different for different webpages), and under Autodetect to see if autodetecting is deactivated.\n\n", "Q: How can I get chromium-browser to run fullscreen (not kiosk) in 12.04? I have created a restricted user which logs in automatically and Chromium runs the default home page with the screen starting maximized but I want it to run in fullscreen (F11) mode.

We install our own Debian packages from our own maintained repository and this fails unless we provide an i386 version of the package. I'm aware that it's possible to override the architecture in the specific repository configuration but it'll be cleaner to just disable the non-64 architecture altogether.\n\nA: The standard way to remove an architecture would be through dpkg: \nsudo dpkg --remove-architecture i386\n\nTested on Ubuntu 16.0.4 LTS. \nIt is also faster & simpler than to add architecture after every deb ... in sources.list.\n\nA: It appears that tumbleweed's comment solved your issue.\nYou can add an option to the Apt sources definition that restricts the architectures of that source:\ndeb [arch=amd64] ...\n\nFor more information see the Community Wiki page on multi-architecture package management.\n", "Q: How does Juju \"co-exist\" with Chef, taking the automation process \"one step further\"? It is clear from this post that Juju sits at a different layer than Chef Server. Juju sits at the orchestration or service layer, while Chef sits more at the individual server or configuration layer.\nAt one of Canonical's main Juju pages, it states that Juju is designed to \"co-exist\" with tools like Chef and Puppet, taking the process \"one step further\". I have scoured the internet for the past several weeks on this subject and cannot find a good explanation of how , though, a tool like Chef will co-exist with Juju.\nSo, to breakdown the overarching question in the title: (particular interest in Juju working together with a Chef Server)\n\n\n*\n\n*What is an example of a charm \"written in Chef\"? Is it simply a charm written in bash that then calls the chef-solo command? If so, can a charm call the chef-client command to work in concert with a Chef Server?\n\n*Where is the overlap between Juju and Chef? For instance, the apache2 charm has its config-changed hook where it makes config changes that, in the Chef world, would take place in a recipe by applying a template file. If a Juju charm were to work along with a Chef cookbook on deploying an apache2 service (cluster) it would almost seem that an \"apache2-chef\" charm would have to be written so that you could separate out the tasks. In this case, the apache2 charm in the Charm Store would be less than helpful.\n\n*If you have Chef roles applied to nodes (service units) that are deployed/managed by Juju and your sysadmin decides to change the firewall rules for a particular server role and does this in the Chef role, is Juju going to ever overwrite those changes?\n\n*More simply, can Juju be a Chef Server wrapper, like Ironfan?\n\n\nI view Chef Server as the how whereas Juju can do the how, but also brings what to the table. Meaning that the real current state of services and machines can be queried and acted upon. You can't do this in Chef Server. My goal is to bring Juju's awareness and service orchestration capability into a Chef Server-managed infrastructure.\nIt almost seems that a whole set of charms would have to be written where all Chef-managed tasks/config info are left out. \nI would love to hear weigh-ins from someone at Canonical (like Jorge Castro) and from Opscode (like A. Jacob or J. Timberman).\n\nA: awesome questions!\nthe tl;dr\nI'd like to break your question(s) down over a couple of comments... first off, here're\na couple of general approaches to integrating chef and juju:\n\n\n*\n\n*charms hooks can use existing chef recipes that run solo-style on service\nunits (recommended)\n\n*juju service units register with an existing chef-server using a chef-node subordinate\nservice\nThese ideas haven't been implemented/tested yet for chef, but the puppet\nequivalents exist.\nthe... um.. not-so-short answer\nHere's a little more of a breakdown of two approaches to integrating chef and juju:\nJuju as top-dog\nHere juju runs the show.  The biggest value juju provides is event coordination\nduring distributed configuration management... hence the \"service\norchestration\" moniker.  Juju charms consist of hooks which are called by juju\nat \"the right time\" when coordinating service management.  The implementation\nof these hooks is pretty much open.  They're shell scripts, source code, puppet\nmanifests, or... chef recipes.\nJuju breaks bits of any service config up into:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"installation\".. the bits that're specific to installing a particular service\nonto a node\n\n*\"relation\".. the bits of config that're needed to relate that service to some\nother service\nThe key to using chef recipes as hook implementations is exactly this... you\nhave to make sure that the recipes you're using respect this separation of\nconcerns.  Otherwise, there's nothing that prevents using off-the-shelf\ncookbooks.  You can leverage existing recipes you've spent time/money to develop.... You\njust need to make sure you can call the relation-specific stuff separately from\nthe installation-specific stuff.\nWe need some examples of this, but I think it'll be popular b/c chef has a\ngreat dsl, a great templating tool, and is much more pleasant to use than bash\nwhen writing complex config.  For simple config, chef recipes are a little\noverkill imo, so this method of integration is pretty much the best of both\nworlds... and has serious legs going forward.\nChef as top-dog\nThe idea here is to integrate juju services into an existing chef-server\nmanaged infrastructure.  To do this, you'd need to write a chef-node\nsubordinate charm.  This subordinate service would be attached to primary juju\nservices and would effectively register these services as nodes (in particular\nroles) with the chef server.  Subs can be attached during juju service startup,\nor anytime later throughout each service's lifecycle.\nI'm thinking this'd be quite similar to the puppet-node sub.  All necessary\nkeys, roles, etc would be specified via config to the chef-node subordinate\ncharm.  I'd start there.  A more sophisticated approach would be for the\nchef-node sub to interrogate both the primary service it's attached to and its\nchef-server to dynamically determine roles, but that'd be quite a bit harder\nthan just specifying them in config for the sub.\nOpinions\nI'd definitely recommend method 1 above, if possible.  Having the coordination layer on top of the configuration tools will probably work well long-term.  Needless to say, real-world infrastructures might be some combo or variation of both approaches for a period of time...  especially during migration.    Planned coexistance using method 2 would probably only work if the components managed by both tools were somewhat orthogonal to each other.  Not sure exactly what that would look like.  Perhaps juju and chef manage separate relatively decoupled services?  I suspect it might work well to let juju manage primary services and have chef manage more infrastructure aspects.  Dunno.  That's a bit of a longer discussion though :)\nSide note... you can also use juju to manage chef-server itself... even large\ncomplex multi-tier chef-server installations.  I haven't looked at the\nchef-server charm lately, but if it doesn't currently handle tiering and\nseparation of services, then it can certainly be made to.\nI'd love to see more examples of both types of chef integration mentioned\nabove... it's been on my wish / todo list for a while, but has yet to bubble up\nhigh enough in priority to get done...  please help if you're interested!\nok, that's a decent chunk of rambling :)... let's start there, then we can go into more detail in subsequent comment blocks.\n", "Q: xfce4-terminal goes 'blank' occasionally while in drop-down mode It happens whilst I hit my keyboard shortcut to access the terminal.

It's an Acer Aspire 5100-5023 if that means anything to anyone. It has an integrated graphics card, ATI Radeon Xpress 1100. ATI (I guess AMD now) no longer provides legacy support for this card.\nNow I have Ubuntu 12.10. It has xorg 1.13. Unity wont run correctly with out that version of xorg. However, any existing catalyst drivers aren't compatible with xorg 1.13. The OpenGl drivers I currently have seem to be sufficient for my usualy activities. Any graphics problems encountered thus far have been tolerable, I'm even at 1920x1080 resolution (I have a monitor attached, the built in screen on my laptop could never dream to do that. It's really a dinosaur now.)\nThe problem arises when I try to run games. Particularly I've been trying to run Starcraft 2 through PlayOnLinux which is a front end for Wine. I have to enable the debugger to see what's wrong and it points to OpenGl not being able to render a 3d environment. Particularly err:winediag:wined3d_dll_init The GLSL shader backend has been disabled. You get to keep all the pieces if it breaks. But that's irrelevant information to my problem.\nSO here's my question: What is the best alternative graphics driver for my graphics card? The proprietary drivers are not compatible with the current version of xorg while OpenGl drivers are inefficient. There are probably people working on creating a compatible driver, but I figure I'd ask to see if there are any projects out there for creating the driver that I so need.\nChances are there are other older graphics cards that are in need of compatible drivers. With such a need there is bound to be a solution.\nThis information may or may not be relevant.

I disabled secure boot. Am able to boot live DVD via boot menu only which brings up Ubuntu' s manual installation menu, I believe. But when trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 I get a blank screen. Completely black. So what I believe the problem is is that I did not create an EFI partition. If I'm wrong someone please correct me and assist. \nQuestion: How do I create an EFI partition? Do I do this in Windows 8? Appreciate any help I can get.\n\nA: Since your desktop came with Windows 8 preinstalled I believe you already have an EFI partition.\nWhile in the live DVD Ubuntu session try to get gdisk installed via apt-get, and list the partitions with sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda.\nThe partitions would be most likely in this order\n\n\n*\n\n*A small, under 1MB partition with code EF02 \n\n*The EFI partition with code EF00\n\n*A windows Recovery Environment partition, code 2700\n\n*A windows System Reserved partition containing the BCD, MSR code 0C01\n\n*followed by the OS partition, perhaps code 0700\n\n\nThese short codes are gdisk's internal, in the GPT they have GUID corespondents.\nIf this is the partitioning scheme that you already have, you can leave the first four partitions untouched and either shrink or delete the Windows OS partition to make room for Ubuntu partitions. To shrink you'll have to get gparted installed, otherwise for deletion/creation you can stay within gdisk. If you deleted everything try to recreate this partitioning scheme under gdisk.\nedit You can also do the partitioning from within Windows Disk Management, shrink the Windows NTFS partition and make the linux partitions, leaving them unformatted and with no assigned letters, then in the Ubuntu installer just assign them their respective mount points, type and format. It is potentially safer to continue partitioning the disk using the same tool that it was started with. /edit\nAbout your blank screen, you might have a graphic card that still uses old BIOS functions, try to temporarily enable BIOS compatibility while doing the install, and make sure that you are booting your DVD under UEFI. If you boot the DVD under BIOS while trying to do an EFI install you might get into GPT issues.\nIf you install your Ubuntu with grub-efi-amd64-signed I believe you won't have to turn secure boot off.\n\nA: Use gparted to create a FAT partition labeled EFI. You can then install grub2 onto it and use it as a boot device.\n\nA: GPT fdisk (AKA gdisk) is a really useful tool for everything to do with EFI and GPT. It is a utility from Rod Smith (he answers questions here on AskUbuntu I believe). \nYou can find the utility here:\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/\nI believe it allows for EFI System Partition (FAT) creation.\n", "Q: Restore files lost from adduser I have a web server set up using the www directory with a whole bunch of files that have not received their monthly backup.

I'm assuming its the combination with the mail server creating directories but what I really need to know is how to get the files back!\nedit: My problem has been solved by me forgetting to close gedit. Thank god! On the other hand this is rather odd and supposedly not because of the adduser behavior. Most likely the default behavior of an e-mail server. But I've heard no mention of it being an issue. So it must be the combination. If it didn't delete the files they should have gone somewhere though and photorec should have been able to recover something that was only missing its link in the file table. Still a puzzle on multiple fronts.\n\nA: It's hard to tell, but I think the /var/www directory was recreated (rm -rf then mkdir). It's hard to tell because I'm not sure exactly what adduser does when you add a user with a new home directory that already exists.\nYou wouldn't want to give a user a new home cluttered with files. I think adduser scrapped your work.\nA program like photorec might be able to save you, but if you have to recreate everything it will be good practice and you'll learn not to use adduser on a directory you want to keep.\nThis is just a theory. \n", "Q: Cross compile SQLite for ARM I am using SQLite 3 for Database management in my ARM9 based microprocessor.\nI want to cross compile the latest version of the SQLite 3 for my project in Linux (Ubuntu 10.04).

I don't know what should I do in order to have highest security secure on my home network and internet. \nI got a router have only one port and I connect it to hub and split it to 3 of my computers. 2 computers are windows ( Client ) which I use to browse internet and do some school work. And the other 1 computer is ubuntu-server and I ready to use it as web server and mysql server. If my server is been attacked, at least the others 2 of my computers wouldn't be affected.\nSo, any suggestion which is the best way for me to achieve it. I am a very new beginner to network so forgive me asking this kinds of silly question\n\nA: I assume your router has two ports, not one: one outside port and one inside port. To be secure, what you want to achieve is that no traffic originating from outside can travel in, unless you explicitly allow it to. You also want to achieve that traffic originating inside can travel out, and responses to it can travel back in and arrive at the originating computer.\nIf your router does NAT and offers port forwarding, then this is sufficient to achieve the above situation. Assign local IP addresses to the internal computers, and make the router NAT these to the outside. Local IP addresses are in the ranges 10.*, 192.168.* or 172.16-31.*. To expose your web server to the outside, set up a port forward of port 80 on the outside to port 80 on the server. Disallow any other port forwards, virtual hosts, or the like on your router.\nThis is not \"the highest security\" that you ask for. Security can always be improved on, but it's a good baseline.\n\nA: There is a python program known as denyhosts http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/\nthis will make sure that if some one tries to login maliciously to your webserver he will automatically get blocked after 3-4 attempts (the number can be decided by you)\nhttp://www.thefanclub.co.za/how-to/how-secure-ubuntu-1204-lts-server-part-1-basics\nhttp://www.ubuntugeek.com/securing-ssh.html\nOnce you install this learn about IPTABLES on Linux\n", "Q: Copying from mount share drive to local folder through script This is my first time trying to work with Linux Scripts so this may be something obvious.\nHere is what I am trying to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all contents from local folder - rm /home/user/Documents/Exercise/\n\n*Copy files from a shared windows network drive - cp smb://server/arc/Exercise%20Files/Word/\n\n\nSo from my understanding my command should look like this\n  rm /home/user/Documents/Exercise/\n  cp smb://server/arc/Exercise%20Files/Word/ /home/user/Documents/Exercise/\n\nBut anytime I try and run either of the above commands I get the following error:\n  \"rm: cannot remove `/home/user/Documents/Exercise/': Is a directory\"\n  \"cp: cannot stat `smb://server/arc/Exercise%20Files/Word/': No such file or directory\"\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nKind Regards,\nM\nEDIT:\nI now have the rm function working yet am still troubled by the cp function.

The speed of the computer is not just determined by the amount of memory available, but also the access speed for that memory. For RAM, that speed is extremely high as compared to say, access speed on a usb flash drive. So even though you could extend your total memory, access speed to the part of the memory on the flash drive would be extremely slow, defeating your very purpose. For that purpose, a swap partition is created on your hard disk itself. What windows does is the same, it creates a swap space on the flash drive. So all in all, if you're running out of ram, adding more swap space isn't really a viable alternative. You're much better off upgrading your RAM.

This shortcut produced the following:\n\nIs there something similar in Ubuntu? The only way I found is to either\n\n\n*\n\n*use Displays settings, which is bothersomly slow\n\n*use Fn shortcut, which is not optimal, because you don't know, which mode you'll be turned to\n\n\nA: Why is Displays slow? Because it is too many clicks away, or because changing what is needed (necessarily using mouse) is clumsy? If the former, you can either use the launcher with Win+A, displays (or disp should be enough), Enter; and if that is not enough, use ccsm command bindings to invoke gnome-control-center display with one keystroke.\nIf the latter, I believe there still may be a remedy: if you are using say two or three typical monitor setups, you may use the command bindings as above for mapping appropriate xrandr invocations, e.g. Fn+F1 for the first setup, etc. You still will not see what configuration you are going to end up with, but you will know which one you are setting.\n\nA: As I switched to XFCE, I am very happy with the XFCE's display swicher. It's as easy as hitting Win+p and selecting the output via arrows and hitting alt+o. Once you remember the shortcuts, it's lightning fast.\n\n", "Q: Folder Recovery after upgradation Hi I upgraded my ubuntu 10.10 to 12.04 and I found one folder named 'www' inside '/var' was missing Can you plese tell me how to recocver it .\nThanks..\n\nA: Unfortunately, this probably can't be done, as 10.10's / partition has been overwritten by 12.04's /. It is recommended to take a backup of all important files before upgrading your system.\n", "Q: How can I change the permissions of a folder from create or delete to list files only on a NTFS partition? I have many NTFS partitions on my PC.\nIf I change the permissions of a folder on a NTFS partition from \"create and delete files\" to \"list files only\", its permissions will return to \"create and delete files\" permissions.\nBut, if I copy that folder and paste it onto the desktop, a Linux partition, the feature works. That is, it will change from \"create and delete files\" to \"list files only\". \nHow can I make the permission changes stay without copying the folder to my desktop?\n\nA: On Linux partitions, in Linux (example: ext4, reiserFS)\nIn Linux, if you don't have the ownership of a file, you wont be able to change the permissions. You can use sudo to change the permissions for a file you don't own.\nIt is possible to launch Nautilus as root by doing alt+F2, then: gksudo nautilus\nThe system will ask for your password. This way, you can change any permission on any file. Take care, it is possible to change permissions or delete system files too!\nOn Windows partitions, in Linux\nOn partitions like NTFS and Fat, there are not so many rights like in Linux/Unix filesystems:\n\n\n*\n\n*On Fat partition, there are no right management;\n\n*On NTFS partition, ownership can be managed.\n\n\nYour case\nOnce a file from a NTFS partition is copied on your desktop, it is on a Linux partition like Ext4. So the file can be managed the Linux way, with all the options about owner, group, other, read, write, execute.\n", "Q: How do I wake up the printer when it sleeps? I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on an LTSP network.\nI have attached a printer to the server via USB.\nThe printer is an HP LaserJet Pro P1102 with driver Foomatic/foo2zjs-z2 (recommended).\nOften the printer goes to sleep, and then jobs submitted do not get printed. Even when the printer is turned on to force waking.\nHow can I wake up the printer so the print jobs will be executed?\n\nA: Type  \ncupsenable printername\n\nin konsole \n\nA: I had the same problem with HP P1102 and CUPS server and here is what I did. Open your server terminal (I assume CUPS has been already installed and P1102 hooked up in one of your server USB ports). In terminal enter:\nlsusb\n\nYou should see the following for your HP P1102:\nBus 001 Device 003: ID XXXX:XXXX HP, Inc LaserJet P1102\n\nThe first XXXX is your Vendor ID and second XXXX is your Product ID.\nThen create a file:\nsudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/51-printer.rules \n\nAnd insert the following (change XXXXs relevant to your values from lsusb output):\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"XXXX\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"XXXX\", MODE:=\"774\", GROUP=\"lp\"\n\nSafe the file and reload udev rules:\nsudo udevadm control —reload-rules\n\nNow CUPS will be able to wake up your printer next time you start using it.\n", "Q: Copy speeds drop down all the time? I use Ubuntu 12.04.\nI have a good PC , a Dell XPS, with 8 GB of memory and a 1TB HDD and an i5 processor.\nWhen I copy files internally (to and from the internal HDD), nautilus initially shows speeds of about 30 Mb/s.\nBut, the problem is, it always, keeps dropping by 0.1 Mb/s at a time (every 5 seconds or so), till it stabilizes at around 1Mb/s (if the copying isn't finished already).\nI'm trying to backup my PC into a 1TB WD My Passport external  HDD (USB 3.0).\nIt started at 36 Mb/s and is now 8Mb/s in 15 minutes and still falling regularly.\nI have around a 100 GB of data to copy and it doesn't seem it will happen.\nAny ideas about the problem?\nEDIT:\nWhile I couldn't really find out what caused th problem, using a tool like rsync helped and it is much faster than the traditional cp.\nSebastian Werk's answer helped too, but it doesn't tell what caused it.\n\nA: Have not the required reputation for comments, that’s why I post this as an answer:\nI assume the external HDD is not a SSD, but a „normal“ HDD.\n\n\n*\n\n*Was it empty?\n\n*How much data do you copy? 1 entire TB?\n\n*Which file system do you use? (FAT, NTFS, ext, ...)\n\n*Do you copy a lot of small files or a handful of big files?\n\n\nIf the harddisk was not empty and FAT as a filesystem was used, there might be the problem, that big files have to get split up amoung different locations, this usually slows down.\nSome filesystems (ext for instance) distribute the files all over the disk (which is good!), but if you copied first a lot of small files, then you might run in the same problem when big files arrive.\nWhen a disk is almost full, the performance usually drops a lot.\nAnd finally, the nautilus speed display is not very precise in general.\nProbably it is too late now, but you can test the performance of a disk via the „Disks“-program, if this drop to 1 MB/s is a general problem.\n", "Q: Kubuntu and KDE clock I have some very strange behavior of the KDE clock in latest Kubuntu with KDE 4.10 backports.

The option _netdev is always recommended for cifs mounts in fstab. This switch delays mounting until the network has been enabled, though excluding this option won't create a problem. \nThe warning is because you didnt provide the password during the mount.\nA similar but slightly different(in the way that the credentials are stored in a file and the file is referenced in fstab) method has been described here.\nEdit: Use noauto(like you did), if you wish to mount during login instead of boot. user and sync options are also optional, use them according to your needs.\n\nA: I have the same problem with Pluma (MATE Desktop's Gedit fork); it seems to be caused by difference in resolution of file modification timestamp between local GNU/Linux machine (nanosec) and remote Windows machine (~2 sec for FAT32).\nWhen Pluma finished writing the file, it queried and remembers modification timestamp of the file; in CIFS case, this information is cached (thus show the original nanosec time). But when time passed, cached attributes expired, and Pluma tried to check file's timestamp for external modification again, it would now get the server-side timestamp (which is rounded up to 2-sec resolution); Pluma interprets this as external modification, and displayed the warning.\nI worked around this by stopping CIFS from caching file attributes: specifying actimeo=0 option in fstab:\n//qnap/share /data  cifs noauto,user,username=qnap,uid=1000,gid=1000,actimeo=0 0 0\n\nSo when Pluma saves the file and read the timestamp, it will always get the already-rounded server-side timestamp, and stops giving the annoying message.\n", "Q: Can I disable updatedb.mlocate?

You could eventually gain some speed with \"low-resources\" Ubuntu flavors like lxbuntu or xubuntu, but this is IMO a matter of taste.\n\n*about applications: there are a lot of external applications to be found in “ PPAs ” (personal package archives) on http://launchpad.net/ . Applications are most easily found in “ packages ” (even via PPAs) and the system manages them for clean installation/configuration/deinstallation. Installation outside standard locations is always possible, but not recommended unless you are a developper or you know exactly what you are doing. \n\n*there are 2 main sorts of executables in Ubuntu (and Linux/Unix generally speaking): the binary compiled ones (=real executable programs, non human-readable) and scripts (text files that begin with '#!…' and refer to an interpreter like a shell). Either should be marked executable via a permission flag to be executed, but that's starting to be technical. There are other kinds (like windows executables that can be detected and run by third-party programs) but I think it's out of scope.\nFor more information, you should head to your local ubuntu user group or read web tutorials. I think this current forum is for more precise questions. Perhaps a good start is http://ubuntu-manual.org/\nregards,\n\nA: Before changing the place where apps are installed, you may first learn a bit how Gnu/Linux works.\n\n\n*\n\n*For the GUI, you can close your session, and at loging, click on the small Ubuntu logo next to you name, choose Ubuntu 2D, and log in you session. Desktop effects are not activated and it should be faster.\n\n*In order to install apps outside of the sofwate center, you can download .deb packages. It is necessary for Google Chrome, as an example. But you be able to find most of what you need in the sofwate center. You can try Synaptic instead, \"sudo apt-get install synaptic\" in a terminal, or of course, you can install it in the software center ;-)\n\n*And yes, most of things in Linux can be executable. If you look at the properties of a file, you will see in the permition section \"read / write / execute\". In windows, you can run .exe, .msi, etc. In Linux, any file can be executed, if what is needed is installed. Most of scripts you will find are .sh files.\n\n", "Q: How can I get guake to start? When I try to start guake it fails and I get the following error message:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/guake\", line 1422, in <module>\n    if not main():\n  File \"/usr/bin/guake\", line 1365, in main\n    instance = Guake()\n  File \"/usr/bin/guake\", line 653, in __init__\n    notification.show()\n  glib.GError: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.freedesktop.Notifications was not provided by any .service files\n\nI can use guake-prefs to alter the settings back to their defaults, but guake still fails to load. Even if I reinstall or reboot, it still doesn't run.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: This often happens because your desktop environment's notification daemon cannot be started or is unavailable, as noted at the official site. It is not a guake bug because a notification program is one of guake's dependencies and should be installed with the program, or should be running in the background anyway. Therefore it is legitimate to speak of ways of addressing this problem, which is specific to the user's desktop environment, rather than being a deficiency in guake itself.\nThis error message unfortunately means guake fails to load, but there is a way to get around it, as opening the preferences with guake-prefs and unchecking 'enable popup notifications at startup' should enable guake to load. If this is unsuccessful you can make sure you have the notify daemon installed for your desktop environment (and python-notify), and that the notification daemon is running. Notification daemons are usually automatically started at login for most desktops such as Xfce, which uses xfce4-notifyd.\nLastly, if these solutions are unsuccessful, you can also try this patch at the official site, and patch the source code and compile it, just as I did (for another guake feature) in my answer here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to change Guake cursor from block to I-Beam?\nThat answer has all the general information about how to patch guake and compile it, if the other options do not solve the problem.\n(As the op noted, what worked for him this time was was to reinstall python-notify, which was one of the dependencies I mentioned in the answer. The other approaches may well be useful when that particular solution is unsuccessful.) \n", "Q: Ubuntu alongside Windows 8 I already installed Ubuntu on my Laptop -it is an Hp1000 Notebook PC with windows 8 on it so i installed ubuntu alongside windows 8- I went through all the installation process and it displayed a message telling that the intallation was completed and that i needed to reboot my computer. I did it and it just went into Windows 8 OS, however it created the partition for ubuntu but when i try to open it on windows it tells me that the partition is corrupted. Why does the Ubuntu OS doesn't appear?\n\nA: Windows can not open Extfs partitions, only fat and ntfs. So in Windows, you can not see any file on the Ubuntu partition. However, in Ubuntu, you can open most of partitions types, and so you can see the Windows files.\nIf you don't have the Grub menu at startup to choose between Ubuntu and Windows, the Ubuntu installer was not able to write the bootloader in the MBR. It may be because of the UEFI bios.

Checking mount points and lsof are the normal things to look for. In my case it was corruption caused by an old bug, since fixed:\nThe normal things to check for:\n\n*\n\n*lsof +D <path> - This will list all open files. You cannot delete a folder that contains open files, though that would also normally give a slightly different error: \"Device or resource busy\". Note that if you leave out the \"+D <path>\", lsof will show a listing for all folders on all filesystems - which will waste time. ;)\n\n*mount: This will show you the currently mounted filesystems. You cannot delete an actively-mounted mountpoint or its parent folders.\n\n*btrfs sub list <path>: Similar to a mount point, you cannot delete a btrfs subvolume except by using the btrfs-specific command: btrfs subvolume delete <path>.\n\nCorruption Workaround\nIn the case of corruption where it cannot easily be fixed, the basic workaround is to back up, format the filesystem, and then restore (leaving out the bad data). Depending on how much data you have in the filesystem, this can be a chore. :-/\nIn my case the problem folder was inside a subvolume so I was able to do the above but by deleting only the subvolume instead of the entire filesystem. I backed up my data and deleted the subvolume: btrfs sub del <subvolume-path>. I was then able to restore into a new subvolume, leaving out the problem folder.\nCorruption of i_size\nThe cause in my case was found to be corruption of i_size, where it was non-zero. Btrfs uses the i_size to tell whether or not the folder is empty. To check on this, run:\nstat -c %s <foldername>\n\nThe i_size of an empty folder in btrfs should be zero. In ext it is typically 4k.\nRelated links:\nhttps://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Problem_FAQ#I_cannot_delete_an_empty_directory\n\nA: Go to the folder right before the one you want to delete and execute this command changing foldername by the name of your folder:\nrm -rf foldername\nR means recursive, and f means force. \n\nA: I have folders in Windows that are mounted to an Ubuntu VirtualBox virtual machine (VM).

I hope this little script helps, this is what I've just done (and worked so far):\nInstallation procedure on this link helped a lot!\nOnce Ubuntu was Up & Running I had little issue to boot Windows 8, which I fixed with  boot-repair, also in the same link above.\nBoot repair:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair  \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n$ boot-repair\n\nAnd last step was fixing the overheating (I'm still testing but it is good so far) with bumblebee, that is for Nvidia & Intel dual graphic cards.\nInstallation on this wiki:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia linux-headers-generic\n\nThx!\n\nA: It wouldn't mess with windows...\nYou can try a partition software and re-arange your partitions\n(Windows 8 should have a small ~100MB system partition and another one for the OS ~50GB)\n\nA: Yes you can reduce partition 4, but it's safer to do it with Windows partitioning tools, not Linux tools.\n\nA: To resize/shrink a partition or volume in Windows, open the Disk Management tool.\nThis can be found through a simple search in the Start Menu search bar.\nOnce you open the tool, either select an existing volume/partition to shrink/resize, or select unallocated space to create a new volume/partition with. \nIf you choose to make a new partition, you will be asked for the desired size in MB, that of which cannot exceed the amount of unallocated space on your HDD(s), depending upon your hardware configuration (and whether or not you have any separate storage locations, like an actual secondary or 'jaz' drive).\nIf you choose to shrink an existing partition/volume, you will be asked for how many MB you wish for the requested partition to be reduced by. The system will perform a query when you choose to do the shrink, indicating the amount of space you can shrink from your chosen volume/partition. Your MB size cannot exceed the maximum delineated, for the sake of the existing file system (unless you wish to risk overwriting files and corrupting existing the file system). This will leave you with more unallocated space when complete, which you can use to create a new partition.\nOnce performed, you can then create a new partition and delineate it as a sort of virtual drive, which can be formatted, allowing for read-write access. This partition is the one you can mount a new OS to, if you so choose. Just be sure to choose the correct file system format type first.\nAs an added note, Linux and some UNIX OSs tend to need at least 6-10 GB of free space. Mac OS X needs 10-20 GB. A new Windows or DOS-based system may need at least 10-20 GB or more. ChromeOS and Android are a bit more forgiving, needing only 8-16 GB. \nGood Luck!\n", "Q: Autoexec.bat equivalents for Ubuntu that run with root privelidges? On Ubuntu there must be several \"autoexec.bat\" equivalents as I can see files like rc.local which seem to do very little because the comments in the file says it doesn't work by default and I tried putting this command in there and it didn't work.\nWhat I need to know is where I place this line.\necho 0 | /usr/bin/tee -a /sys/class/leds/smc::kbd_backlight/brightness\n\nI also saw a rc.local in /etc/init.d as well but where I would place the cmd to make it work is a mystery as there are two functions in there so do I place it at the end of one of those functions or at the last line?\nThe command needs root permission to run and ideally it should be executed when the computer starts. As the command dims the keyboard of my MacBook Air.\nAlso, I would also like to know what file I'd need to edit if only a specific user would have this command run. As its an root command and I don't want to give admin or sudo access to that user I would like this command to execute as root when the user logs in and the user cannot stop that command from running.\nAdditional Discoveries\n$HOME/.profile is the login script but doesn't run as root, it works if you sudo the command but thats not want I need. \n\nThe /etc/profileis weird, it doesn't execute at boot but when I go into a shell and execute sudo -i\" it runs as soon as the sudo goes into interactive mode\nA neat short cut\nWith version 14.04, might have worked in earlier versions, you simply add a line to crontab using sudo crontab -e and add a line \"@reboot whatevercommandwithfullpath\" and it works. But with this new version I created a upstart script which is closer to how it should be done.\n\nA: You can create a daemon witch is the right way to do it.

Just searched for several hours, but nothing i did worked. \nThe thing i want to do is setup a little NAS. As a test i took a memory stick to serve as storage. The memory stick is formatted with a fat32 filesystem. \nBecause fat32 is a windows filesystem it's not compatible with the way of changing permissions the linux way. In the several hours i searched the web i came across many different ways to change the permissions in the mounting process, but not the right one, every time the permissions are 755 for my mounted directory.\nmy fstab looks like:\n/dev/something       /mnt/something      vfat    ...        0       0 \nI tried many things in the option field. At first just defaults, then the write option, also tried fmask, dmask and umask options.\nTo test if the fstab wasn't the error I also tried mounting with the mount command using the fstab options.\nAnybody knows the real solution? Just using NTFS filesystem? Use other mount options?\n\nA: If you use the flash drive with LINUX ONLY, I suggest you reformat and use ext2 or ext4.\nIf you use it with Windows, you ccan use fat, use this entry in fstab\n/dev/something  /mnt/something  noauto,users,uid=1000,gid=100,dmask=0000,fmask=0000,utf8  0  0\n\nyou can change the uid or gid if you wish.\n\nA: Why does a FAT file system work differently\nFAT, FAT32 and exFAT are file systems designed for file transfer and multiple system compatibility. They don't take into account user privileges or permissions. That makes them very useful for things like USB memory drives as they can be moved from one computer to another.\nThat said a mounted partition in a Linux system is expected to be part of the OS and therefore security permissions have to be added to the mounting command (or configuration at the fstab file).\nHow to add permission configuration\nThe secret to adding permissions is using a mask in the mounting command/configuration.\nAs @Panther had mention before, using the options dmask (directory mask) and fmask (file mask).\n/dev/something /mnt/something  noauto,users,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0000,fmask=0001,utf8  0  0\n\nUnlike Panther's recomendation, I assinged fmask=0001 to avoid any random user from executing any file in those directories.\nYou can read more about mask permissions in this other answer.\nCreate a custom user / group for the NAS share\nI would also suggest creating a user and group (at least a group) to specify who may actually access and edit this content.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Where are the shortcuts listed under the Places menu stored? How can I edit the contents of the Places menu on Ubuntu 12.10?\nFor example, say I didn't have any videos and wanted to remove the shortcut to Videos?\n\n\nA: You can edit the contents by modifying the contents of ~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks.\nEach entry represents a single entry in the Places menu.

This might be helpful: https://chrislea.com/2013/03/15/upgrading-from-node-js-0-8-x-to-0-10-0-from-my-ppa/\n\nAlso to note is that the nodejs-dev and npm packages don’t exist anymore. The new nodejs package contains everything that these separate packages used to, because npm needs all the development files, and you’re not really using node these days if you’re not using npm. So we figured we’d just simplify things with the single package.\nThe upgrade will uninstall the previous versions, but apt can be a bit obstinate about doing this.

However, since you previously installed npm the \"old\" way i.e. like any other globally installed npm package, the old version (that exhibits the bug) is still picked up from your $PATH after the upgrade.\nUse which npm to find out whether you get the package installed one from /usr/bin/npm. If you're still getting the \"old\" one, remove it (it's only a symlink) and you'll get the \"new\" version from the Ubuntu package.\n\nA: Okay. the issue can be resolved by deleting the .npm and .node-gyp directories from the home folder and then reinstalling nodejs again.

It did do it, and ... there was also a great pleasant surprise to me: on the first Ubuntu screen was a little window asking for the PIN code of my SIM card! ... I gave it, and there emerged an application asking for the data necessary to establish the Internet connection. So, I could have connection apparently without any previous installation of the TP-Link software! ... I can also tell you that the Ubuntu connection was faster than that with Windows 7. Then, leaving TP-Link active, I rebooted into my HDD Ubuntu. There, I could have Internet access with the same procedure.\nMay 7, 2014. Now, I can access the Internet from Ubuntu with TP-Link MA180 - even without the micro SD card - on my dual-boot, Ubuntu-Windows system in a simpler way: 1) boot into HDD Windows 7, and establish a greenly blinking network connection by just giving the PIN code; 2) with TP-Link installed (I even removed it for a few seconds), reboot into HDD Ubuntu, which asks for the PIN code on its first screen (the application does not emerge any longer).\nProbably, there are more similar manners to gain Internet access with TP-Link from Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Can not find class org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp.BasicDataSourceFactory in Tomcat7/Ubuntu 12.10?

The other two Windows options both boot Windows.  I had trouble installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 where I wanted Ubuntu to be on a separate SD.\nThe system now works the way I want it too, I am at the stage now of just wanting to clean it up alittle bit.\nAny information would be helpful (if the image doesn't work than please let me know, again I am a newbie at this).\nThank you,\n~Dan\n/home/daniel/Pictures/2013/03/15/DSCN1058.JPG\n\nA: Some of an answer regarding GRUB I just posted might help you with GRUB and your boot situation.\nPlease be certain that you actually want those entries removed prior to deleting them form GRUB.\n", "Q: ssh refusing connection with message \"no hostkey alg\" My SSH connections worked well, but from last week SSH from my laptop to my board refusing connection.

I have the encryption passphrase.\n\n\nA: I took the dive and installed anyway. I used the same user password, as with my previous install, instructed the installed to use the home partition (option called “Reinstall Ubuntu”) and everything worked flawlessly. I do seem to have a new passphrase now, but that is okay.\n\n\nA: If your /home is a completely separate partition, when you are in the install portion of 13.04 it should ask you where your /home is, you can then point to your previous /home.  \nThe installer should not even be able to mount your /home. its encrypted, and I don't think it will ask you for permission. \n", "Q: ubuntu won't boot So my configuration is such that my windows 7 is installed on a msata ssd drive and I am trying to install ubuntu on my regular sata hdd. Overall the windows installer copies the files but ubuntu doesn't show in the boot menu. Could you tell me the solution for that?\n\nA: You need to use grub, its a boot manager. It will load a list of boot options eg win 7 win 8 ubunutu.\nHowever grub works on a linux system, and your MBR (master boot record) is on the windows drive. So windows boots before even know there are other drives with other options.\nfor safety sake I say tell your bios to boot the sata hdd first, you will then need to configure grub to offer the option to boot the ssd. \n\nA: My installation scenario is very similar to yours, Win7 On SSD, and Ubuntu 12.10 on an internal SATA drive. When I installed Ubuntu I opted to manually partition the HDD.\nAfter installation I changed my bios to boot from HDD; since there are 2 distinct OSes installed GRUB presents the option to boot Ubuntu (1st option) or Win 7 (second option) without having to mess with bios settings. If you wish to have Win 7 as the first option (therby after a short timeout GRUB will automatically boot Win 7 - Grub Customizer is available for installation\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\n", "Q: Making a metapackage that depends on a package with a different architecture I'm making a metapackage to install a number of packages that comprise my standard setup, like the package ubuntu-desktop.  One package that I'd like to install is [Adobe Reader][1], which has a deb.  I've added this deb to my custom repo (using reprepro), and it installs fine by itself.  However, when I attempt to install the metapackage, which Depends on adobereader-enu, apt-get install metapackage says\nmetapackage: Depends: adobereader-enu but it is not installable\n\nI suspect this is because adobereader-enu is i386-only, and this is a amd64 system.  The metapackage itself is basically just a control file, so it's Architecture: all.  I'm wondering if there's a conflict here, and if so, how to fix.\n\nA: It can't be done, unless adobereader-enu declares itself to be MultiArch: allowed or MultiArch: foreign.\nInstead, create an i386-only metapackage, which depends on adobereader-enu, and is MultiArch: allowed.\n", "Q: sudo service apache2 restart: already running As the title says, when I run sudo service apache2 restart, the message returned says that Apache is already running.

What gives?\n\nA: It's possible for apache to get stuck and forget to remove its PID file (if it crashes, say).\nCheck if the file /var/run/apache2/apache2.pid exists. If it does, rm it.\nAlso check if there are apache processes running:\nps auxwww | grep apache\n\nIf there are, kill -9 them.

I'm working on a project for a nonprofit cultural center. \nI’m trying to develop a limited desktop using Lubuntu. The idea is to provide a basic desktop, maybe only four icons, Chrome, OpenOffice, Adobe reader, calculator and printing services and nothing else.\nAs part of their service to the community, they provide computers, printing and internet access. Currently in place are PCs running different versions of windows and MS Office which are problematic due to licensing, access to system settings, viruses and the like. \nI’m trying to provide the center a machine that gives the patrons everything they need without allowing the users able to muddle with any OS features and provide a machine that requires as little administration as is possible.\nSo far, I’ve been able to comment out all menus and other desktop functionality. \nThe machine boots to a login prompt, and the Patron user I've setup simply presses the login button and they get the mini desktop. Logging off is done with ctrl-alt-backspace, it works great except that I’ve been unable to find a way to remove the “desktop preferences” from the right click mouse menu or completely disable the desktop mouse menu, either solution would work. \nIn addition, can I disable the terminal session for this user? \nAny advice or different approaches to creating such a mini session would be welcome. \nThanks.\n\nA: I don't think you can get rid of it, since it's part of PCmanFM (Lubuntu's default desktop manager).\nBut you can replace it: right-click the desktop, then select Desktop Preferences > Advanced and tick Show menus provided.\nThis will use openbox's right-click menu.\nYou can then edit out any entries you don't want in:\n/usr/share/lubuntu/openbox/menu.xml\n\nBy the way, to restore pcmanfm's menu, you must run this command in a terminal:\n pcmanfm --desktop-pref \n\n", "Q: How to disable Zend Server CE auto start? I'm using Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) and Zend Server CE 5.6. For some reason I want to try XAMPP, but Zend Server CE automatically start every time I boot up my laptop. Is there a way to stop it?\nI don't want to uninstall Zend Server CE.\n\nA: Zend Server CE installs a run script in /etc/init.d/zend-server (which is in fact a symlink to /usr/local/zend/bin/zendctl.sh).  The easiest way how to stop Zend Server CE from starting is to remove the symlink, e.g.:\nrm /etc/init.d/zend-server\n\nThat way the original file will be kept on your system, but it will not run at startup.\n[Edit]: If you want the service back just symlink it back:\nln -s /usr/local/zend/bin/zendctl.sh /etc/init.d/zend-server\n\n\nA: This is happening because the OS is starting the default HTTP service when it boots.  Zend Server has a dependency on the Linux httpd service when it installs. So you'll have to configure httpd to not start automatically and start it manually when you want.\n\nA: You can do it with bum.\nType sudo apt-get install bum, then launch it with sudo bum.\n", "Q: how to set up root account on a new install?

Notice that I didn't give it a username? It's not recommended that you log in as a root user since you can easily mess up your computer, so Ubuntu forbids anyone except the root user from logging in as the root user.\nInstead, if you need to run any commands as a root user you use the 'sudo' command followed by whatever your trying to do. Now, here's the how you log in as root. NEVER DO IT, but I'll tell you anyway. Since the root user can only log in as the root (huh? That's circular, how does that even work?), you can use sudo to become root. i.e. sudo su. But don't do this, even though I just told you how.\nNow, the password for root is the same as the password on your user account (assuming it has administrator priviledges). So really all you need to do is change your regular password with passwd.\nNow, this is the important part. Forget everything I told you about sudo su!!!\n", "Q: Differentiating between the windows and ubuntu drive space I am installing ubuntu for the first time. I followed the instructions online and created a usb disk for the install on my Acer Aspire One netbook. My netbook came with windows preloaded and I am wary of completely removing windows since this is my first time with ubuntu.  I am currently in the middle of the install right now, how do I differentiate between the drive space allocated for ubuntu and the drive space allocated for windows?\nThe installation program has what I can only assume is the optimum drive allocation at 70/30 but I want to be sure which is which. Help?\n\nA: welcome to AskUbuntu!\nWhen setting up a dual boot system, you will have one existing NTFS partition for Windows and will be resizing it to add an ext4 partition and a swap partition for Linux. NTFS, ext4, and swap are just names for the types of partitions.\nWhen you install Ubuntu, Windows will not be able to recognize the partition (the part of the disk) that Ubuntu is installed on. Windows will recognize that Ubuntu partitions exist, but will not be able to tell you what type they are, or read and write data to them. There are a couple ways you can access Linux partitions from Windows, like with the free programs Explore2fs, DiskInternals Linux Reader, or the Ext2 File System for Windows.\nUbuntu, however, will recognize your Windows partition, and you will be able to \"mount\" it, read and write data to it. Upon login, you will see a link on your desktop to access your Windows partition, and there will be a sidebar entry in the file manager for easy access. Upon opening it, you can explore much of the user data in the \"Users\" folder.\nUpon boot, you will see a menu with the option to boot from Linux or Windows, with a couple of other options (which happen to be on your Linux partition) for diagnostic purposes.\nIn Ubuntu, you can install GParted. This will allow you to view a simple visualization of the layout of your disk partitions, and has quite a few tools for manipulating them as well. You will only want to manipulate your partitions when making more free space, installing other operating systems, or doing other system-related tasks.\nGood luck with Ubuntu! I hope your experience is a good one.

You may want to read more about bus errors. \nIf you have a second CPU that fits in the same socket, you could swap it to test. If you have multiple sticks of RAM, you can pull them all out, and only use one at a time in the first DIMM slot, to test with. If one of them starts giving you a lot more crashes, and you get this same error, but don't with the rest, then that is the bad stick of RAM.\nYou could also choose the Memory Test option at the boot menu, to run some more rigorous tests of the memory.

How can't I own my computer (only account on this laptop).\n\nA: Your user does not own the file. On all Linux and Unix systems, there is a special user called root, who's job is to \"own\" all system files so an ordinary user cannot accidentally break the system. You must also be root to perform some administrative actions. \nYou can perform changes as root by prefixing a command with sudo, and entering your password. To open a root file explorer (WARNING!!! VERY dangerous, easy to cause a lot of harm), press CTRL+ALT+T and then type gksudo nautilus followed by Enter. Enter your password at the prompt, and change away (be VERY careful).\n\nA: It is one of the basic security features of Linux that you never have root rights by default. This is the reason why you have to type your password every time you want to install software, e.g. via Ubuntu Software Center.\nOpen the files you want to change using the \"sudo\"-command. You will have to type your password (the same you use to login to Ubuntu).\nNow you are able to save your changes.\n", "Q: Can I set up a symbolic link-esque alias from (e.g.) \"mybinary dothing\" to \"dothing\"?

However, while it seems to work under Windows fine, I can't get it working on Ubuntu 12.10.\nIt wants to use some software from the tigr-glimmer package, long-orfs, extract, etc. (see below), and it seems like the script provided expects them to be separate binaries.  When installed, however, they actually seem to be \"sub-programs\"(?) of a binary tigr-glimmer, that need to be run as tigr-glimmer long-orfs, or the like.  I attempted making an alias to turn long-orfs into tigr-glimmer long-orfs, but that seems to have no effect.  \nCan I somehow make a link between the two, or rather, how should I go about fixing this?  The Python script is open to me, but I would rather avoid opening that can of worms.

Thanks.\n\nA: You don't.  The intel fakeraid caching option is not supported in Linux.  If you want to install Ubuntu, you will have to do so either on a non cached volume of the hd, or on the ssd, and not have it cache the hd.\n\nA: Assumption: I guess that you don't have hybrid drive.\nThen, you should normally see more partitions and are free to choosing how it will be organized. I would recommend installing the OS this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*root partition (\"/\") on SSD\n\n*boot partition (\"/boot\") on SSD\n\n*\n\n*If not working, try having the /boot on your HDD\n\n\n*for other huge data (like \"/home\") => HDD\n\n*consider having the \"/var\", \"/tmp\" also on your SDD\n\n*SWAP: if you're using hibernation, place it on SSD...otherwise, try buying more RAM and don't use swap at all\n\n", "Q: Editing sources.list I have edited the sources.list file in order to install a distribution of ns2.

After that they did the following:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sdc\nwhere sdb is the 1TB hdd that was resized to 120GB (The rest was left empty/unused as I was told). sdc is a new 160GB HDD. So they cloned the 1TB to a 140GB because apparently, they tried to copy the partitions before with gparted (They copied sdb1 and sdb2 to sdc1 and sdc2 respectively. But this did not work even after activating the boot flag on the disk).\nNow, they also said that after starting the cloning process, obviously after getting to the max real size of the 160GB hdd, dd gave an error. Am guessing a read/write error since there was no more blocks to write to since there was no more space left (Remember, they are copying 1TB total space to 160GB.) So they pressed CTRL+C to cancel the process.\nThey went to test the system and yes the system showed the GRUB boot menu and could select from there any of the kernel images but the system did not correctly boot.

It would be useful in some situations where the window of a certain program disappears (happens to me sometimes).\nFor example, every time when i'm heading to close hexchat, it shows a dialog for confirmation. If i click cancel, the window is gone anyway, but the process continues running in the background. ( I can pgrep it's id ).\nIs it possible to restore the window, given I know the pid?\n\nA: Unfortunately, no — there is generally no way to get an X Windows application to reconnect to the windowing system if it loses its connection and its window is destroyed. And windows will generally only disappear if there is a bug in the program itself — in which case the process is probably in a hung state without knowing it, waiting on I/O that will never occur because it does not realize its window has gone away.\nUnless the application is of a very rare design and lets you send it a special signal or message to reconnect to the X server, or rebuild a new window, or unless it is still present on the screen somewhere as an icon or docked icon and you can interact with it that way, the program's process must simply be killed and you have to restart it.\nThe behavior of closing its last window without exiting the process is generally a bug that you can report upstream about the application.\n(Note: there are rare exceptions, like web browsers that keep a running process even once their last window is closed — but in those cases, re-clicking the browser's icon or re-running it from the command line simply tells the already-running process to open a new window. Again, an app has to be specially written to handle temporary windowlessness if this is to work.)\n\nA: As Brandon Rhodes explained, if the window is destroyed/hidden by its parent process, no way to recover/recreate/show it from outside the process or application itself.\nYou can confirm from window manager, try: wmctrl -l -p, no window related to its PID is listed.\nSo, It possible that hexchat is still responsive, try:\nhexchat -e --command=\"gui show\"\n\n-e Open URL or execute command in an existing HexChat\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*man hexchat\n\n*HexChat 2.9.6.1 documentation: Controlling the GUI\n\n*man wmctrl\n\nA: If the process is simply in the background, perhaps this answer fits here too:\nUse fg to bring the process back to foreground. \nSee the full answer for more instructions.\n\nA: I don't know hexchat, but possibly the program uses a tray icon which makes it possible to get the main window back. Unfortunately, there are multiple tray implementation on linux and not all of them work together.\nI had such a problem with the program RadioTray which didn't show up anymore after the update to Xubuntu 14.04. The solution was reconfiguring it (the file ~/.local/share/radiotray/config.xml had the option 'gui_engine' with the 3 possible values 'appindicator', 'systray' and 'chooser').\nIf this doesn't help, try to check the options/preferences of your application. Possibly you find an option 'Minimize to tray'. Disable it and try closing the window again.\n\nA: You could try Ctrl + Alt + Del, then end the process. Hope this helps.

Guest access works fine, and strangely while the Wubi installer says I'm about to install 12.04, it actually ends up downloading and installing 13.04. Any ideas would be appreciated.\n\nA: There is a bug that Wubi will install the dev release (13.04) if you are using an out of date installer e.g. for 12.04 or 12.04.1.

If you are using VMware full-screen, this is the same resolution as you have your monitor at.\nIf your Ubuntu server video resolutions don't go up that high in the preferences, you probably haven't given the virtual machine enough video ram.

In the systemd world, this distinction is important.\nIn the systemd world, you similarly (to upstart) have to adjust what command options a particular getty program is spawned with to include --autologin root.  Whilst there are two ways to do this with a kernel virtual terminal, there's really only one for a serial device, because there's no tweakable service alias akin to autovt@.service for serial device login services.\nWrite one or more unit file override files under /etc/systemd/system with systemctl edit serial-getty@ttyS0.service or just directly with a text editor.

After trying out Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Xubuntu by working in them for a few \nweeks, I have now decided on which distribution to use. Now I want to delete the partitions that holds the versions that I no longer need. \nI use GParted to manage my partitions, but it will only show me partition names, and not the content. I can't seem to find any place when booting the different partitions that informs me of the partition.\nHow do I see what content is on which partition?\n\nA: The easiest way, or at least the way that I think will lead to the fewest mistakes, is probably to check while running the operating system you want to keep.\nIn the Installed System (that you are keeping)\nBoot into the Ubuntu system that you want to keep (if you're not in it already).\nOpen a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run:\nmount\n\nThen look at the output. Remember that this will be different depending on what OS you're in when you run it. You won't get the information you need if you run it from the live CD/DVD/USB!\nLook for the root partition, /, first. If you have any other data partitions, like a separate partition for /home, find that too. (By default, there is no separate partition for /home.)\nTo see the / partition only, run:\nmount | grep 'on / '\n\n(Remember the final space before the ending ' character.)\nFor example, when I run that, I get:\n/dev/sda8 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro,commit=0)\n\nThis indicates that my / partition is /dev/sda8.\nYou probably also have a swap partition. To find out which one that is, run:\nswapon -s\n\nFor example, I get:\nFilename                Type        Size    Used    Priority\n/dev/sda7                           partition   4194300 792048  -1\n\nThis indicates that my swap partition is /dev/sda7.\nNow, it's possible that your devices will have different device names in the live CD/DVD/USB system than in the installed system. While unlikely, substantial data loss could result as a consequence of assuming they are the same. There are several ways to verify this--one of them is to compare the UUID's (with blkid; Rostislav Stribrny's answer uses this method).\nSince if you've followed this method then you've started out in the installed system, and you have the device names of the / and swap partitions (and any other partitions you need to keep, if any), the most user-friendly way to make sure they're the right ones is probably to look at them visually.\nTo do this, install GParted. Remember, this is in the installed system that you want to keep (the live CD/DVD/USB already has GParted). Please do not attempt to repartition inside an installed system--just use GParted to see where the partitions are.\nThen you can verify their positions before removing the others.\nIn the Live Environment\nMake sure all important files are backed up, somewhere other than this computer. Both human and computer error can lead to serious data loss when repartitioning. I am talking about files like your documents, and anything else you'd be sad to lose. You probably do not have to back up your Ubuntu system files, because if things go way wrong, you can always reinstall Ubuntu.\nBoot to the live CD/DVD/USB, select Try Ubuntu, open the GParted Partition Editor, verify that the partitions you're keeping are where they were before, and then repartition however you like. Make sure to look not just at the relative positions of the partitions, but to double check the device names too (names like \"sda2\").\nYou can remove all partitions except the ones you found to be associated with the particular installed system that you decided to keep. But do not remove the extended partition (which is a kind of container partition but has its own device name), unless you're removing everything in it. If you remove an extended partition, that gets rid of the partitions it contains also. (If this is a UEFI system, then there will be no extended partition. Otherwise, given the number of OSes you have installed at the same time with their own partitions, you'll almost certainly have one.)\nYou can stretch the remaining partitions out to give them more room, or add additional storage partitions, or leave things be for the time being--whatever you prefer.\nAfter applying your changes, you'll probably have to reinstall GRUB2 to the MBR. You can try booting from the hard drive and see if it works (then if it doesn't, boot back into the live system to reinstall GRUB2). But I recommend just reinstalling it before even rebooting.\nTo reinstall GRUB2 to the MBR, you can use the techniques presented here, or any of these methods.\nOnce you boot from the hard drive, assuming all goes well, you should make sure swap is working by running swapon -s. If nothing is listed, you'll have to check the new device name for the swap partition, and edit /etc/fstab accordingly. Usually, swap will still work, because usually its fstab entry is by UUID rather than by device name.\nSimilarly, if you have other partitions that are mounted by device name in /etc/fstab (like a separate /home partition, though again, the entry will typically use the UUID and thus continue working even when the device name changes), you may have to fix those manually as well.\n\nA: I assume that you've got one GRUB configuration that contains all Linux distributions you tried.\nIn such case, please check /boot/grub/grub.cfg and look for \"menuentry\".\n- Each menuentry contains lines starting with \"search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root\" followed by your unique partiotion ID.\n- The above mentioned line contains the \"root\" filesystem of given Linux distribution identified by given unique partiotion ID.\nThe list of these unique IDs could also be displayed by using the \"blkid\" command from command line.\n=> Therefore, if you have installed your OS (given Linux distribution) just to one partiotion (ie. root = \"/\") and no other partiotion was used (e.g. shared between installations), than you can simply erase the identified (unnecessary) partition.\nDon't forget running \"sudo upgrade-grub\" command afterwards.\nHope this helps a little bit.\n", "Q: 12.04 Install Problem , Configuring Hardware Been trying different things for several hours now, the install comes to a halt when I reach the configuring hardware part of the installation.\nhave nvidia gtx580 and asus rog maxius gene-z. did have gpu hangup when i instaled without disabling the feature in f6 like I read on the net.\nany ideas ?\n\nA: Just after you BIOS finishes displaying its stuff, press shift a few times to make the GRUB menu appear.

Internet download speeds are dependant on alot more than link speed. Things like congestion at your ISP as well as remote server load. This speed does not sound abnormal. \nWhat are local copies like? The info provided looks fine. Dont worry about eth0 etc.. They are just names assigned to the NIC . eth0, eth1 etc.. yours likely has a name derived from the module or model of card. \n", "Q: How to install software provided in software-center via terminal? Can anyone help me providing terminal command to download and install the software provided by Software center?\nActually I'm searching for command to download and install KDbg (Debugger) via terminal.\n\nA: Short and sweet:\nRun the following commands in terminal to install kdbg:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install kdbg\n\n\nGeneralized Solution:\napt-get is the command line package management tool to install/update/remove softwares. To install any software you may run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update   # This updates/synchronizes the package index files with the update server (not always necessary to run this command, but preferred)\nsudo apt-get install <package_name>   # This command actually installs the package\n\nMost of the times <package_name> is same as the name of the software you want to install. However, if you can't seem to figure out the name of the package, you have a couple of options before you.\nSuppose you want to install dconf Editor - it's package name differs from it's name.\n1. GUI - Using Ubuntu Software Center:\nSearch for the software you want to install, then look at the Version field. It consists of two parts separated by a space, the first part before space is the package name and the second part gives the version information. For dconf Editor the package name is dconf-tools.\n\n2. Command Line - Using apt-cache:\nWe run the command as apt-cache search <software_name>\n$ apt-cache search dconf\ndconf-gsettings-backend - simple configuration storage system - GSettings back-end\ndconf-service - simple configuration storage system - D-Bus service\ndconf-tools - simple configuration storage system - utilities\nlibc-bin - Embedded GNU C Library: Binaries\nlibdconf-dbg - simple configuration storage system - debugging symbols\nlibdconf-dbus-1-0 - simple configuration storage system - D-Bus library\nlibdconf-dbus-1-dbg - simple configuration storage system - D-Bus debug symbols\nlibdconf-dbus-1-dev - simple configuration storage system - D-Bus development files\nlibdconf-dev - simple configuration storage system - development files\nlibdconf-doc - simple configuration storage system - documentation\nlibdconf1 - simple configuration storage system - runtime library\nasoundconf-gtk - Applet to select the default ALSA sound card\ndconf - collect system information\nlibdconf-qt-dev - dconf Qt bindings (development files)\nlibdconf-qt0 - dconf Qt bindings (library)\nlibgrabcd-readconfig-perl - rip and encode audio CDs - common files\nlibmed-tools - Runtime tools to handle MED files\nxnetcardconfig - A simple network card configuration wizard for X\n\nThis lists dconf-tools at third place. Not quite helpul, but still good enough in most of the cases.\nI almost always tend to use apt-cache, if not satisfied, then use the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nTip: Use simulation with apt-get:\nIf not quite sure, use the -s flag with apt-get to simulate the working of the command. Make sure to put the flag at the end. Thus, run the command as:\nsudo apt-get install <package_name> -s\n\n\nA: open your terminal with CTRL+ALT+T\nthen type\nsudo apt-get install kdbg\n\nthis will install the software you need.\nIf you want to know more about installing any software in Ubuntu I suggest you to read the Installing software Documentation.\nI hope this will help you.\n", "Q: Touch Pad is detected as a generic mouse device in 12.04 My touchpad seems like PS/2Generic Mouse device with the output xinput.

My objective is to create a binary file.I have searched but didn't found anything helpful to me. So may I know how can I create a .bin file.\n\nA: Extensions are irrelevant, you can name a file dead.letter and it can still print \"hi\".\nThe following terminal commands will create a file named hello.bin, make it executable and print \"hello\" when executed:\ncat > hello.bin <<EOF\n#!/bin/sh\necho Hello World\nEOF\nchmod +x hello.bin\n\nExecuting ./hello.bin gives:\nHello World\n\nThis is a shell script, interpreted by the /bin/sh program (which is actually the /bin/dash program on Ubuntu).\nThe following writes source code to hello.c, the following command creates a binary program from this code:\ncat > hello.c <<EOF\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main(void) {\n    puts(\"Hello World\");\n    return 0;\n}\nEOF\ngcc hello.c -o hello.bin\n\nExecuting ./hello.bin gives you Hello World too.\n\nA: I am new to ubuntu community but had this as a bookmark on my browser.\nYou can see if this helps.\nhttp://www.ehow.com/how_5962897_create-bin-file-ubuntu.html\n", "Q: How to install weather indicator on ubuntu 12.04?

I just noticed because I couldn't write files or anything on my home directory during my open session. I rebooted and complained of 'cannot creat file .ICEauthority'.\nWhat could have caused this weird change in ownership to owner 1016? A virus perhaps?\nI logged in as guest and did a ssh albert@localhost to then do a: sudo chown -R albert:albert /home/albert/. Is that going to be enough?\n\nA: Thanks @IlluminAce for the answer:\n\nThis seems to be a common complaint; if the veetle installation script\n  is run as root, then ownership of your home directory is changed as\n  you describe. Apparently, Veetle should only be installed as your\n  user, not root.\n\n\nA: I would have expected you to use: \nsudo chown -R albert:albert /home/albert\n\nAs for why; have you installed any new programs recently?\nIn response to your comment regarding having installed Veetle, I ran up a 64-bit 12.04 VM, installed ia32-libs, and tried installing Veetle as root. The first thing I noticed is a warning message prior to installation:\nYou are running this script as root. Veetle recommends against installing\non the superuser account. We suggest you press <Control-C> now and reinstall\non the user account you typically use to run Firefox or Mozilla.\nPress <ENTER> to continue installing anyway as root.\n\nHowever, since this comes directly after paging through a multi-page licence agreement, and looks identical at first glance to the acceptance prompt for the licence, I grant you it isn't easy to spot.\nI continued with the installation. Post-installation, I saw the following:\nace@ace9:~$ ls -l /home\ntotal 4\ndrwxr-xr-x 21 1016 1016 4096 Apr  2  2010 ace\n\nace@ace9:~$ ls -la /home/ace | grep 1016\ndrwxr-xr-x 21 1016 1016     4096 Apr  2  2010 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 1016 1016     4096 Apr  2  2010 .mozilla\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 1016 1016     4096 Apr  2  2010 .veetle_vlc\n\nTherefore, to fix this, I suggest running:\nsudo chown -R albert:albert /home/albert\nsudo rm -r ~/.veetle_vlc/\nsudo rm -r ~/.mozilla/plugins/libveetle*\n\nYou can then reinstall Veetle as your user:\n./veetle-0.9.17-linux-install.sh\n\nand all should be well. \nVeetle should consider exiting the script if the executing user is root, or at the very least default to aborting the installation (and require the user to type 'y' if they wish to proceed regardless, for example), instead of causing damage to people's systems. Something like:\nWARNING\nVeetle should NOT be installed as root. \nPlease exit and install under your normal user account. \nContinue with installation anyway?

This is really great. \nsome feature of KidZui add-on.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*KidZui is a Firefox add-on that with one click turns Firefox into a\n  kid-safe environment with over a million kid-friendly websites, games,\n  pictures, and YouTube videos.\n  \n*Parents and teachers review content for KidZui so your kids can surf\n  independently.\n  \n*The KidZui browser uses a Zooming User Interface paradigm to make\n  browsing easier for children. \n  \n*Search results appear as scaled down images of websites, videos, and\n  pictures that children click on to zoom in and see content.\n  \n*Children build avatars called Zuis to represent themselves online.\n  Children can share KidZui content with friends online.

Some time ago I noticed a strange behaviour on my computer running Ubuntu 12.04.\nHere's a detailed description of the problem: I log into my account, work for some time, and then somebody else wants to use the computer so I switch users to the guest session.\nAfter some time I get back and also switch back to my account (without logout/login all the time).\nNow my display always freezes upon actions with the Unity desktop. If I select an Application or scroll through the sidebar or even if I start a program and a window is created. Everytime my computer freezes for about ~10sec before continuing.\nAlso there are strange artefacts appearing (yellow or green blinking fields sidebar descriptions) and if I scroll through a page in firefox the upper \"taskbar\" is somehow \"mirrored\" into the page (but upside down).\nI usually then have to restart lightdm to fix this problem, but it's a bit annoying  to always restart lightdm.\nHow can I fix this behaviour? \nThank you very much !\n\nA: are you completely logging out of guest session after they are done or just switching users again.

I tried looking at the logs in /var/log/dist-upgrade but I couldn't find any useful error information.\n\nA: I would check around, because I believe at one time you could change the repository name from say precise to quantal to produce the same effect. The process was ensure that you updated everything in your current version with repo's and then switch them and run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.\n\nA: Dropbox and Citrix ICA clients blocked my attempts at removing dpkg and apt processes.

There's an option in kde settings to select opengl or xrender.  If you select opengl it will change itself to xrender.\nMyself I'm convinced that the cedarview driver packages don't support opengl.  Period.  I don't think you're ever going to get full graphics performance out if that gpu in linux.  It's closed source.  I use it on a netbook so I don't care personally, though I can see how others might.\nI tried the alpha 2 and beta versions of kubuntu 13.04.  That has the drivers incorporated into the kernel (linux kernel >= 3.7).  No driver downloads needed, but the same situation.  No opengl capability.\nWhich will also mean you won't be able to use 12.10 or later unity releases.  They dropped the 2D option.\nThis may not  be what you'll want to hear but I'd just install xubuntu or kubuntu.  KDE (kubuntu) uses similar memory to unity and it's faster and much more powerful.

So you can look through this log file with any tool you like.\nI use less var/log/syslog for reading it later or tailf var/log/syslog for \"just in time\" purposes. \nAs zwets has just pointed out:  /var/log/dmesgcontains the dmesg output collected during system boot.\n\nA: As I know, there are two another ways.\nThe first one is \ncat /proc/kmsg\n\nAnd the second is using \n'Ctrl + Alt + Fn' to switch to virtual console.\nThen every kernel message(include inserting kmod) will be printed on the screen.\n", "Q: USB bootable computer doesn't recognize the content of the key I'm a noob and this is my deflowering with Ubuntu.

And what can I do to solve this?\nMany thanks in advance\n\nA: Consider the partition from which you want to install Ubuntu (for example the USB stick) could not be NTFS. \nTo enable USB boot, check the BIOS for HDD boot priority. In some hardwares to boot from a USB stick, you must choose HDD in boot priorities and USB stick in HDD priorities  (of course you should insert USB stick before you enter the BIOS).\n\nA: Old computers tend to have different ideas about what is a bootable USB where even the type of USB key can make a differenece.\nAs your computer can boot from a CD I think you will have more sucess with the Live CD which you can gt here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD\nIt will alo allow you to see what Ubuntu will see of your computer without installing anything. ie wether Network card works\n", "Q: retrieveing files Is it possible to retrieve files that I prevoiusly shift+delete ed ?

Meanwhile I'll keep trudging across the tundra, mile after mile...\nGood day and thanks in advance.\n\nA: you can always press the CTRL+ALT+x, where:\n\n\n*\n\n*x from 1 to 6 are simple terminals\n\n*x = 7 is X window system\n\n\nSo you can start cracking it from the command line.\nTry starting with the following logs and configs:\n/var/log/syslog\n/var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nIf everything works well from the USB, but not from the HDD, you can also compare the GRUB boot options:\n/boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nfor given \"menuentry\" (as you already mentioned)\nYou can also change the /etc/default/grub to make the changes permanent.\nPlease see this for example: http://www.intdblog.com/2009/09/grub-2-graphical-boot-tips-to-set.html\n\nA: Just a shot in the dark but it seems to me that it would be using drivers already installed when running from cd but after install video card drivers need to be updated before it can run correctly?\n", "Q: Ubuntu in Windows 8 Do I need to install a specific version of Ubuntu to run it alongside my Windows 8? I've downloaded the typical version.\n\nA: Install Ubuntu 12.10. Since Ubuntu 12.10, there's support for Secure Boot as the ISO is firmed and you'll be allowed to boot from it by default. The installer also supports UEFI, as far as I know.\nOf course you can also install Ubuntu 12.04.2, but you'll have to disable Secure Boot from your BIOS configuration (if you're able to) and perhaps installing it will be a bit trickier as you may have to deal with UEFI partitions.\nNote that those Secure Boot/UEFI things are only important if your machine came with Windows 8 by default; if you upgraded Windows 7 to Windows 8 you shouldn't have any problem related to that. Then I'd recommend 12.04 over 12.10 because it has Long Time Support and (for me) it's more stable and fast - but you don't get some of the amazing 12.10 features like previews in the Dash or the online accounts integration.\nSee also\n\n\n*\n\n*See this question for the differences between Quantal (12.10) and Precise (12.04).\n\n\nA: It all depends on what you want. I would recommend the 12.04 seeing as it has Long Term Support. 12.10 has a few extra bells and whistles. Also, if you're using a 64-bit machine be sure to get the 64-bit version. It will allow you to use your RAM more effectively.\nAlso be careful during the install as it is possible to overwrite your Windows 8 install. Just read all of the options and select wisely.\n\nA: The best thing you can use is the wubi installer \nAssuming you have the iso image, download from ubuntu website wubi installer for the corresponding distribution.\nNext, since it is windows 8, one of the best things you could do is right click -> Mount Iso the particular iso file (iso image), as if it were some CD Drive.\nNext run the wubi.exe and follow the steps, specify the user name and password, and give  the partition, and its size, and you are done.\n", "Q: a noisy sound is came out from HDD (nokia booklet 3G) I just installed Ubuntu LTS 10.04 on my Nokia Booklet 3G. It's working smoothly. But I found a problem. I heard a noisy sound from HDD when I turned off the booklet. What should i do to resolve this issue? thanks before\n\nA: first of all, I would suggest you installing at least some minimal version of LTS 12.04 (if possible).\nAnyway, I still would be smart performing some HDD sanity check.\nFor example something like this: http://www.howtoforge.com/checking-hard-disk-sanity-with-smartmontools-debian-ubuntu\n", "Q: How are log files persisted with the Logstash charm? I'd like to use the Logstash Juju charm and was wondering how the log files are persisted. In other words, if I lose a Logstash instance will I still have access to past logs? \n\nA: Currently, there isn't much safe guard if you're just using the logstash-indexer charm with no datastore. However, if you add the elasticsearch charm to your logstash-indexer instance, then the data will instead be stored there. So if the indexer does go away, the data is still kept in elasticsearch and should still be reachable by Kabana or other means. However, if elasticsearch went away you'd be in the same situation as before, where the data wouldn't be available anymore.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu 12.10 wifi keep disconnecting?

I have a web server which requires a client certificate to establish an SSL connection (SSLVerifyClient require in apache). In firefox or chrome, I simply import the .p12-file containing my certificate in PKCS 12 format in the tab \"Your Certificates\", and this works like it should. \nNow I want to use other applications, which afaik don't have the functionality to provide a client SSL certificate themselves (e.g. nautilus). I guess that there has to be a system-wide location where I can store my client certificate, but the only thing I find when googling is where to store CA certificates. \nSo my question is how can I add SSL client certificate / key files (either .p12 or .crt and .key I guess) so that they are used systemwide?\n\nA: You would need to install your cert under: /etc/ssl/certs. It would need to have the .crt extension. Your application would need to be configured to look in the /etc/ssl/certs path for the certs, but it should work. I have Fetchmail configured to pull reference /etc/ssl/certs. \n", "Q: Is ubuntu installation binded to the installed-on hardware? If Ubuntu was installed (full installation) on a USB flash memory, and then tried to boot that flash memory on another PC, will it boot?\nI am trying to decide whether to use full installation or use a live cd image with a persistent file.\n\nA: Yes it will boot, the only thing you need to be careful about it installing proprietary drivers, so if you have the Nvidia drivers installed on the USB key and you boot it on a machine with ATI graphics, that likely won't work. \nBut generally speaking installation to a USB stick should work on most computers out of the box. \n\nA: Other than Windows Ubuntu will detect your hardware on boot, not on installation. Therefore it is possible to install Ubuntu to a portable drive for booting on another machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? (without using Startup Disk Creator)\nHowever sometimes there may be issues when the hardware of the target machine needs additional drivers to be installed, or in case you had installed additional drivers for hardware that are not compatible with the target machine.\n\nA: There should also be NO problem if you've got some unique additional drivers. The system will boot anyway.\nThe only problem (with X) could be when you've forced using some graphical drivers in the OS configuration (e.g. /etc/modules, /etc/X11/xorg.conf).\nIf you're using common kernel drivers, than there should be no problem at all.

One of my colleague having same model who had just installed ubuntu told me that there is some issue with its wireless driver , as I remember it was some dis-connectivity happening but that wasn't a major issue. He told me 2 commands, which I don't remember, I executed around a month ago. And from then I am facing connectivity problem. At home, I have to use cable instead of wifi and at office I have to use TP-link USB stick by one of my colleague. Otherwise for a week, don't know due to some ubuntu release or some other reason, I am unable to connect and use my internet through wifi. I can have a TP-link USB that just work fine, but my questions is:\nThat how can I check that why all that happened?\nIf it was working before, then their should be its solution with any external hardware by installing some driver or configurations, so what is that solution?\nIs there some command I need to execute to get further information and post here?\nthanks in advance guys\n\nA: *\n\n*I hope that you're not using the command line often.

Or \"everything\" if necessary.\n During the reinstallation, the package installer should ask you whether you want returning the default configuration back or not...\nI also had problems with Wifi on my old Lenovo laptop, but newer Ubuntu version solved it for me automatically. The previous solution was uninstalling the network-manager and installing the \"wicd\" instead.

Depending on his type of usage, an Ubuntu user may spend a lot of time in front of a terminal. Knowing some keyboard shortcuts can make you save a lot of time (ex: copy/paste text, move between the prompt text, etc).\nSo which bash tips/shortcuts do you guys know?\n\nA: Output management\n\n\n*\n\n*Shift+PageUp/Shift+PageDown - Scrolling the terminal output. This is very handy when using an tty: in Gnome Terminal works the same way as dragging the scroolbar. \n\n*Ctrl+s - Pauses the output: the command keeps running, only their output stops.\n\n*Ctrl+q - Resume the output: when output is paused, this will make the command show their output again.\n\n*Ctrl+l - Clear terminal output.\n\nPrompt text manipulation\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+u - Deletes all the text currently typed in the prompt.\n\n*Ctrl+k - Deletes all the text from the right of the cursor\n\n*Ctrl+w - Deletes a word, from right to left.\n\n*Ctrl+a - Move to the beginning of the text.\n\n*Ctrl+e - Move to the end of the typed text.\n\n*Ctrl+Left/Right arrow - Move to the beginning/end of the previous/next word.\n\nCommand execution\n\n\n*\n\n*Tab - Lists available commands from the typed text.\n\n*Up/Down arows - Shows previous/next command executed.\n\n*Ctrl+r - Searches the last command executed from the given text.\n\n*Ctrl+c - Stops the current command.\n\n*Ctrl+z - Sends the program to the background.

Lets say a update is available for the kernel version x.\nDoes it mean following higher versions of the kernel will include that update?\nThanks\n\nA: If you're running the generic Ubuntu kernel, then kernel updates flow in as part of normal system updates. After installing the update, the \"old\" kernel will still be in use until you reboot your machine.\nVersioning is handled automatically - you don't need to worry about it. If you \"miss\" installing, say, update 15, and you install update 16, then that's fine - 16 includes update 15's changes. \nThe same applies for the upsteam Linux kernel: 3.5.2 includes 3.5.1's changes to 3.5.0.\nIn other words, each update is a \"full\" update, not a \"delta\" update.\nThe general advice for when to install kernel updates - when you want to. Bear in mind they require a reboot to switch over anyway. \nIf the update incorporates important security updates, then obviously it's more important; but nothing to get too uptight about. If you feel so inclined, you can keep on top of Ubuntu security notices here: http://www.ubuntu.com/usn\n", "Q: Why does Providesupport Chat Console not produce event sounds?

Whenever I search for a file on synapse and try to open it from there or from any other location, like a quick launcher from Awn, the system opens up the default file manager and navigates to the actual location, before it opens the file. \nIf the default file manager is set to nautilus, the file will actually not open. However I use dolphin as my default and while it does open the file and it does not hamper functionality, it is a very annoying action as it leaves unwanted file manager windows open.\nHow can I stop the system doing this without using Unity or opening the file directory from the file manager as some files are several directories deep?\n\nA: @MHC Thanks for the links and suggestions. The problem was indeed with exo-utils. I installed it as an easier route to make dolphin the default file manager rather than editing a script. With exo-utils installed. xdg-open and gnome-open they opened the file as a folder and so called up the file manager. However exo-open will open the file straight. When I uninstalled exo-utils then gnome-open and xdg-open worked normally. I also realized that I had to set the files defaults from inside nautlius and not just dolphin if I want synapse to open files by default in my preferred application.\n", "Q: How can I run a script before Deja-dup back up starts?

I don't need it to do anything specific accept allow me to login via ssh. I have attempted this before and had the following issues: \n - My dns kept changing and the only way to log into the server was to use the site \"whatsmyip\" to log directly into my home network. I was able to login when I am sitting at home, but if I was to go to \"StarBucks or any place like that I wasn't able to login.\n\nA: You could use a free service like http://www.noip.com/ - you'll get free no-ip subdomains and you can run a little service on your Linux box that communicates with their servers and adjusts DNS records if they need to be changed. \nI use it at home, it's great!\nEdit: Another way you could do this could be to create a Virtual Machine on your Windows or Mac laptop using virtualbox - you can download it from https://www.virtualbox.org/.\nThen, from inside the Virtual Machine, you could turn on SSH if you wanted to. You could then SSH to it from your laptop as if it were a server on the internet.\n\nA: First off all you need to select a linux version i recommend ubuntu or debian but its a personal choice. If you choose ubuntu server in the setup you could setup ssh. Because your ip is constantly changing you will need a program that updates your ip adress. So you could just remember a url and you will know that the ip adress is correct.\nA possible ip updater DynDNS: http://dyn.com/support/clients/linux/\nIt keeps your ip up to date with a sub-domainname or a real domainname.\n\nA: honestly, i went the same route you did at first. With the relative cheapness of second level domains it might be ALOT easy if you register a low cost domain and forward the nameserver for that name to a ddns service (I love dnsexit.com) they are both easy to setup and will save you TONS of issues. That way, if you want it to be more later then one step is already done and configured. 1and1.com has the easiest domain interface (i feel) but godaddy seems to have more flexibility.

I ran the aplay -l command and the results are this:\n    dell1@Dell-Inspiron-M5110-Laptop-Ubuntu:~$ aplay -l\n\n    **** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\n    card 0: Generic [HD-Audio Generic], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n      Subdevices: 1/1\n      Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n    card 1: Generic_1 [HD-Audio Generic], device 0: STAC92xx Analog [STAC92xx Analog]\n      Subdevices: 1/1\n      Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n    dell1@Dell-Inspiron-M5110-Laptop-Ubuntu:~$\n\nFrom what was listed above, Ubuntu does not detect a HDMI Audio output, nor is it listed in the Sound Settings.\nI also altered the /etc/default/grub file from this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nto this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash radeon.audio=1\"\nOnce I did that, a HDMI/DisplayPort 1 audio device showed up in Sound Settings, but it didn't work. So I reverted my changes in that file to its default, since it didn't work.\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: I altered the Grub file again and found out that it works, though the first time I did it, it didn't work.\nThis time the HDMI/DisplayPort showed up, but with no number after it. There is a little 1 second delay before the Audio goes to the TV but it is nothing major. \n", "Q: kubuntu 12.10 amd 64 live cd unbootable I recently bought an asus s56c ultrabook, it cames with windows 8 pre-installed.\nIt's my first time with uefi technology so I'm not 100% sure of what I'm doing. :)\n\nI disabled secure boot and I'm pretty sure I disabled fast boot too, I will attach a screen shot about this. Anyhow I successfully installed Lubuntu 12.10 from alternative cd and ubuntu 12.10 from regular dvd.\n\nNow I cannot install Kubuntu: I downloaded kubuntu 12.10 amd64 iso and burn it to a dvd.\nI pressed f2 and selected UEFI to boot my dvd.\nThen I saw a screen selection like grub and I selected Try Kubuntu. The process started, I saw the logo of kubuntu and after a while everything stopped with a black screen.\n\nI tried replacing quite splash with nomodeset in the options, but the starting process always stops at a different point.\nWhat can I try now?\n\nA: I solved using usb-creator-gtk and creating a usb bootable stick. Then I deleted 'quite splash' in the options of 'run kubuntu'\n\nA: Have you tried pressing ESC right before or after the screen went black? Sometimes this skips any graphical environment that might have crashed and lets you see the current log output which might help you debug your problem.\nIf you find no other solution, you may want to try the normal Ubuntu 12.10 installer and install the kubuntu-desktop package to get KDE installed afterwards.\nShould this fail there is also the option to try the 12.04 alternate installer, then install the kubuntu-desktop package and upgrade to 12.10 from there. \n", "Q: How to correctly reinstall network-manager I tried to install connman and it didn't work, so I removed it. Then I tried to      sudo apt-get install network-manager network-manager-gnome` and that obviously didn't work so I found the correct .deb packages and installed them. Ethernet now works, but wireless doesn't. Did I do something wrong? Whenever I press my hardware wireless switch it doesn't react. The applet tells me that wireless is disabled by a hardware switch, but my only hardware switch doesn't do anything.\n\nA: Try something like:\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\nsudo aptitude reinstall network-manager*\n\n\nA: It was on airport mode by default, I just had to switch it. [[facepalm]]\n", "Q: Install .tar.gz and .tar files? Cody again. I'm still sort of a noob at installing things so I need your help... Im trying to install hping3 and of course it's a .tar.gz file... I've looked everywhere even on here and no solutions... Please help!!\n\nA: the above answer is an easy and efficient solution but if you want to install through tar.gz first you need to extract is using \ntar -xvvf [filename.tar.gz]\n\nthen you need to configure the source code contained in tar.gz with command\n./configure\n\nafter that do\nmake\nmake install\n\nto install your program and you are done.\nPS: you need to be present in the specific folder extracted. that's all.\n\nA: AFAIK, it should be already available in Ubuntu repositories (12.10), so simply do this:\nsudo apt-get install hping3\n\nIn case that it's really tar.gz, then you can extract it by using:\n    tar -xvzf hping3.tar.gz\nThen, you have to compile the source code, typically by using \"make\" command (you'll need installing the build tools):\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nTake this as a hint ;-).\n", "Q: How to install django? Help to install Django. When I extract the file the contents have been just dumped all over my Home folder and when I try to either import django or sudo install it I get errors. \n\nA: Unless you need some cutting-edge newest version of Django, I would recommend installing it from Ubuntu's software repositories instead. From a terminal you can do this by typing\nsudo apt-get install python-django\n\nThe most popular free open source software needed is available in Ubuntu's software repositories so that you won't have to do installations manually.\nIf you want to list all the subpackages of django that are available, you may use the command\napt-cache search django python\n\nIf you prefer not to use the terminal for installation, you can open up Ubuntu Software Centre and search for the packages there. You might have to check \"Show technical items\" in the bottom left corner for some packages.\n\nA: An incredibly cool way to install django is this way:\nsudo apt-get install python python3 python-pip\nsudo pip install django\n\n", "Q: Need help with GTK# and mono In my quest for platform-independence, I built a simple hello-world app on my windows machine using monodevelop 4.0 and gtk# 2.12. When I try to run it on my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, I get the below runtime error:\n\nUnhandled Exception: System.TypeLoadException: Could not load type\n  'MainWindow' from assembly 'hellogtk, Version=1.0.4824.3971,\n  Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'.

Can you suggest what could have gone wrong ?\n\nA: Found answers to my question. On Ubuntu, below dependencies need to be furnished (apart from the mono runtime environment) before running a gtk# program compiled with Framework 4.0:\nlibgtk2.0-cil\nlibmono-posix4.0-cil\n\n", "Q: Dual booting Lubuntu with Windows 8 I've got an older laptop (HP G62) that has Windows 8 as its primary OS and I want to dual boot it with Lubuntu. It does not come with Secure Boot,m nor does it come with UEFI.\nI've been looking at this guide and it says that I need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink the Windows partition.\n\n*Create a primary ext4 partition (using the free space) with the mount point set to /\n\n*Create a swap (logical) partition.\nNote: For me it would be 6GB.\n\n*Choose the Lubuntu partition and click Install Now.\nI am 100% aware that the link that I provided does talk about Windows 7, but I haven't seen any valid guide on how to dual boot Lubuntu with Windows 8 on a laptop or PC without UEFI.\nI have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will GRUB replace my Windows 8 bootloader?\n\n\n*Should I make the main partition (/) primary?\nI know this guide is for Ubuntu, but since they're pretty much the same I though this guide would work for Lubuntu users as well.\n\nA: *\n\n*Grub will replace your boot-loader and it will look like a standard Linux GRUB menu. You can however make Linux OR Windows as your default after successfully installing Linux. \n\n*Let Ubuntu installer handle partitioning. You do not need to create partitions manually before installation. Ubuntu installer will provide visual tool where you simply slide and adjust the space desired to Linux and Windows. The gui partition tool/installer will handle the rest and update GRUB boot menu. You can not have the Windows boot-loader BUT it will boot to both OS just fine. \n", "Q: What are all possible ways to login into an Ubuntu system? I am running Ubuntu 12.10 on my laptop and I would like to make a set up such that without a login password, no one would be able to login into my system. Currently it seems that one can, quite easily, login into Ubuntu operating system using the recovery mode, or using an Ubuntu Live USB. When I realized that the system can be logged in so easily without a password, I wonder what's the purpose of the login password anyways ! \nAnyhow, how can I temporarily disable recovery mode and live USB boot? If there are other ways to get into USB, I would like to know that as well. \nThis is to prevent my roommate from getting access to my laptop when I go for vacation. So if some logging method requires a change of password before displaying my home directory, that's a less significant security risk for me, 'cause then I wont be able to login myself and will \"detect\" that someone has used my system (so your friend wont do that 'cause he knows you will find out and more importantly cannot login anymore).  \nAlso I would like to password protect USB ports temporarily so that data cannot be copied out (or a keyloger cannot be copied in) without entering my root password. \nThanks\n\nA: You seem to be concerned about attackers who are going to bypass your operating system completely and access the files on your hard driver directly (by booting a different operating system such as a rescue image or live CD, or anything, really).\nClearly the only thing that's going to help you there is to encrypt all your filesystems and your swap. You will have to enter a passphrase on the console at boot time. Without the passphrase, the filesystem can be destroyed, but not accessed.\nStill, you should be aware that if the attacker has physical access, there are still some things that they could do (or might have already done!) such as installing a keylogger.\n", "Q: How to make ls produce ISO 8601 format In older versions of Ubuntu, like 9.10, ls(1) produced ISO 8601 format by default, in the way\nls -l --time-style=long-iso\n\ndoes it.  With 12.04, we're back at the older Unix style. Thus replacing the year by minutes and seconds for recent dates.\nHow can I - in the least intrusive manner change this back to long-iso? Is there maybe some general configuration option?\n\nA: I know this question is quite old (more than 1 year old), but for posterity, let me share the tip as originally described in this blog post (not mine). In summary, this one line does everything you want:\nexport TIME_STYLE=long-iso\n\nstick that line into /etc/profile, or a file in /etc/profile.d/, or even in ~/.bashrc, and you're good to go.\n\nA: I was convinced that ls took its default arguments from the environment variable LS_OPTIONS, but its man page makes no mention of this.\nMy solution would be to set an alias to ls in ~/.bash_aliases or ~/.bashrc:\nalias ls='ls --time-style=long-iso'\n\nWhich instantly makes it work for the common ll alias as well.\n", "Q: Hierarchy in Launcher? Help! My launcher is full! And scrolling through the icons is so painfully slow!\nIs there any possibility to apply a hierarchy in the launcher? Some folder-like icon where you can put in a bunch of launcher icons? And when you click on it, they will be shown. So you can start an app in the launcher with two clicks instead of one and you don't have to scroll all the way down every time.\n\nA: You can use Drawers for it. It creates a drwaer (like a folder) in the launcher and you can drag and drop several other icons in it.\nInstall it like this:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ian-berke/ppa-drawers \nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install drawers\n\nAnd then when you start the application, you can choose what to name it and then it will be added to the Launcher.

Its split in two parts. As per the manpage filefrag reports on how badly fragmented a particular file might be. It makes allowances for indirect blocks for ext2 and ext3 filesystems, but can be used on files for any filesystem.. If you're expecting it to do something else, you're doing it wrong.\nOf course without know what or where 'dump' is from, we can't tell very much. EF53 is a 'magic' number, that refers to EXT2/3 and 4 and is the filesystem the harddrive dump is on is using.

How can I merge an unallocated partition with an extended partition ?\nI'm having trouble moving this unallocated space to the Linux portion.\nHere is my partition space:\n\n(source: axgig.com)\n\nA: As I see your partition table, the 268 GB parition lies in between the free space and the extended partition,which makes it (perhaps) impossible to merge without deleting the 268 GB partition. You need to delete this one and then reallocate the free partition to the extended one and then create the 268 GB extended partition. \n\nA: Free space must be adjacent to a partition to make increasing the size of that partition possible. \nYou can use gparted running from a Live CD to move that 268GB partition (mysteriously called \"C\") to the front of the free space. Then you can increase the size of the extended partition.\nIf you get an error from gparted during the resize process (it boils doen to partitions cannot overlap) then you've hit a bug in the gparted version shipped with Ubuntu 12.10 (it is 0.12.1).\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest version of Gparted Live\n\n*burn that to a CD\n\n*boot your Computer from that CD (you have to answer a few uncritical questions here)\n\n*the last question allows you to \"autostart gparted\", which is what you want\n\n*now select the drive you need and there the extended partition (easiest done in the table)\n\n*right click on that line and select \"resize/move\" to get the following\n\n\n*now you can drag the left arrow as far as you want to increase the partition\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. Could not merge unallocated space to the extended partition next to it using gparted. After hours of trying many things with the live CD, I tried Parted Magic LiveCD. I could make all the changes fine. The were warnings that the system / dual boot may not work.

This seems like such a glaring problem that I figure I'm doing something wrong on my end. What's the proper way to get a camera to work on 64-bit Ubuntu?\n\nA: I have the same issue on Ubuntu 12.10 (64-bit) with a Canon EOS 400D. I found reports about this only happening when connecting the camera through a USB3.0 port, but not when plugging in the cable to a USB2.0 port; however, this workaround is not working for me with an Asus N76VM laptop. Maybe it works for you.\n\nA: A workaround that worked for me was killing both gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor and gvfs-mtp-volume-monitor. I killed the gphoto2-one first, so I don't know if it was necessary or if just killing the mtp-one would have worked.\n\nA: Blizzara's answer led me to a proper solution - gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor is interfering. I tried killing it, but it's keeps coming back.\nSo I took the sledgehammer and whacked it right upside the head like this:\nsudo chmod 644 /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor \n\nAnd that did it! (Of course, I did have to do a ps ax | grep gvfs-gphoto once and kill the already-running process.) Shotwell now downloads my pictures like a charm! I'm sure there's a better solution to this problem, not to mention that we shouldn't be having this problem in the first place, but I'll take this for now.\nBtw, since Blizzara led me to this, B's answer deserves an upvote.\n", "Q: mp4 to mp3 conversion I have worked on multiple tools that convert a \"mp4\" file to \"mp3\" format, but what I am really interested in, is there a way I can convert multiple mp4 files to mp3 format in a single go.\n\nA: Sound Converter can convert Videos to Audio, and allows multiple files. It is the best program I have found to convert anything audio wise. It is installable from the Ubuntu software center.\nWhen you run the program make sure to change your preferences, under the edit drop down menu, to what format you want to convert as well as many other settings. \nHere is an example of converting a video into audio (MP4 to MP3) as you have requested.\n\n\nA: A Nautilus Script Solution\n#!/bin/sh\n#Nautilus Script to convert selected MP4/M4A file(s) to MP3 format at highest quality using Variable Bit Rate\nIFS_BAK=$IFS\nIFS=\"\n\"\nfor filename in $@; do\nfile_name_in=$(basename \"$filename\")\nfile_name_out=\"$(basename \"$filename\" | sed 's/\\.[^.]*$//').mp3\"\nfile_to=\"$(echo \"$filename\" | sed 's/\\.[^.]*$//').mp3\"\n(ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -y -i \"$file_name_in\" -acodec libmp3lame -aq 0 \"$file_name_out\") 2>&1 | zenity --progress --title \"Converting...\" --text \"<b>From:</b><i> $filename </i>\\n\\n<b>To:</b><i> $file_to </i>\\n\" --pulsate --auto-close\ndone\nfi\nIFS=$IFS_BAK\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that you have ffmpeg and libmp3lame installed.\n\n*Copy and paste the text block above in your text editor, save this new file in the Nautilus Scripts folder (e.g. ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts) giving it a name like Convert MP4 to MP3, and make it executable.\n\n*In Nautilus file manager, select the MP4 file(s) to be converted, right click, choose Scripts and then Convert MP4 to MP3.\nYou should get new MP3 files side by side with MP4 files shortly.\n\nA: I have just converted six .mp4 to .mp3 using Winff 1.4.1 in Ubuntu 12.04, and it has worked smoothly.\nThe terminal window that opens up doesn't show errors but the conversion process and it will only tell you to 'Press enter to continue' after it's completed.

How do I prevent Skype from automatically starting every time I boot my Xubuntu 12.10 netbook?\nThings I've tried:\n\n*\n\n*Removing it from the Settings Manager->Session and Startup->Application Autostart - couldn't find it in the list.\n\n*Checking for a relevant setting in Skype itself - couldn't find anything of the sort.\n\n*Using BUM to turn it off - again, couldn't find it in the list.\n\n*Uninstalling Skype with apt-get remove skype --purge and hoping that it removes all the settings as well - it didn't.\n\nSave for reinstalling, what else can I try?\nWhile on the same note - how is it possible for Skype to autostart without going through the normal Upstart route?\nEDIT: Couple of more things I tried:\n\n*\n\n*Looking for anything similar in Skype support - I didn't expect to find anything, and I didn't.\n\n*Looking through the .Skype folder in my home directory. I did find a couple of files which looked promising (.Skype/shared.xml, .Skype/[my username]/config.xml, .Skype/[girlfriend's username]/config.xml), but looking through them didn't yield anything. Plenty of SQLite files though. Could it be that this setting is somewhere within?\n\n\nA: Go to Tools -> Options -> General settings. Uncheck the option \"Start Skype when I start\". Save and Quit Skype.\n\nA: For the new 2017 version of skype that's impudent enough to add itself to autostart each time it's started (seriously? Never installing it on my own machine) it's enough to create a folder with the same name as a file it's trying to create:\nrm ~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop\nmkdir ~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop\n\n\nA: Since it seems the answers here change all the time, as of an install of skypeforlinux from earlier this week (version 8.11.0.4), I managed to get the autostart to cease with two steps.\nFirst, open up Skype, go to Tools > Settings and uncheck \"Automatically start Skype\". \n\nThen, inspired by azeam's suggestion, go to  (Xubuntu) Settings > Sessions and Startup > Application Autostart, and remove the item for Skype. I'm not sure if unchecking works; I tried that first, but it may have conflicted with Skype's internal settings when I tried it. \n\nA: All of these answers didn't work for me because I have installed Skype by Snap. I needed to delete .desktop file from ~/snap/skype/current/.config/autostart/. After relogin Skype stops starting automatically.\n\nA: Had the same problem and the following seems to have taken care of it: go to (Xubuntu) Settings > Sessions and Startup > Session, find Skype and left click where it says \"If Running\" and change it to \"Never\".\n\nA: In Kubuntu 14.04, the problem was solved by going to Startup and Shutdown, then Session Management and checking Start with an empty session and Apply.\n\nA: Skype (for Linux) Settings\nOpen Skype - Menue: extras -> settings -> category: start and close\n1.

When the window opens, just remove the tick from Skype to prevent it starting at boot, then click remove while you selected Skype to clear it from the list.\n\nA: I had this same issue. I was able to prevent it from starting automatically by removing skypeforlinux.desktop from ~/.config/autostart/. I'm using lubuntu; the location of your autostart folder may vary. You can find by using: \n$ locate skypeforlinux.desktop\n\nYou'll really only want to delete the copy in the directory called autostart, otherwise you won't be able to start the app from the icon.\nI'm assuming that the next time you actually, intentionally run Skype (I hope, for the sake of your sanity, that this day is far in the future) that it will try to put that file back. In which case you might have to delete it again or scour Skype for the setting that will prevent that behavior. \n\nA: Closing Skype is not the same as Quitting Skype. I did three things in Kubuntu 14.04.\nAfter Opening Skype I went to Skype(Menu)>Options>General and checked \"Start Skype Minimised in System Tray\". Then Options>Advanced and unchecked \"Check for updates on Startup\". Finally, rather than \"Sign out\" I clicked \"Quit\" at the bottom of the menu.\nI believe that it was the final step that did the trick.\n\nA: Just use GNOME Tweaks. Find Startup Applications. Find Skype and remove. That's all.\n\nA: The solution above is not enough any more. Both skype and teams take the liberty to add themselves to the autostart category on every start - not just at installation.\nThere is a simple counteraction:\ncd ~/.config/autostart\nrm skypeforlinux.desktion\nmkdir skypeforlinux.desktop\nchmod 755 skypeforlinux.desktop\n\nNow skype can't do this any more.\nThe same can be used for teams.desktop.\n\nA: TL;DR: Insert \"app.autoStartEnabled\":false into ~.config/skypeforlinux/settings.json\nSince the \"Skype\" package continuously changes, here is what works as of\n2021-01-08 for users who cannot/do not want to log in to open the Settings page.\nAs others have pointed out, you can use various means to stop Skype from\ncreating/overwriting the autostart desktop file (~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux)\nevery time it starts again. If you think that's too hacky and want a \"proper\",\nhopefully future-proof way, here goes.\nWerner Nöbauer points out above\nthat ~.config/skypeforlinux/settings.json contains the user preferences in\njson form.\nHowever, neither app.onCloseKeepRunning nor app.launchMinimized are what\nyou want to change, it's app.autoStartEnabled, as can be discovered using a\nbit of de-obfuscation magic:\n/* main.js */\nt.SettingsKeys = {\n    AutoStartEnabled: \"app.autoStartEnabled\",\n[...]\n\n\nA: In my case (Ubuntu 20.04) Skype was install via a snap. So the file to remove was:\n/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications/skype_skypeforlinux.desktop\nAs I'm not using it and I'm annoyed by this automatic start that I didn't ask for, I also uninstalled by running:\nsudo snap remove skype\n\nA: Prevent skypee startup at start time in ubuntu.\nLogin skypee and in menu items.\nIn Skypee Menu -> Tools-> Settings -> General -> Automatically start skypee.\n\n\nA: There are Three simple steps to disable skype from starting on screen or automatically on booting in ubuntu.\nStep1: Open skype and click on three dots(...)appearing on top menu bar\nthen click on setting option.\nStep2: Then click on >>General setting option.\nStep3: Where you will find option >>Automatically start Skype option\ndisable it if it is enabled.\n\nA: Mine was under my snap install.\nrm ~/snap/skype/current/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop\n\nA: It seems to be the case that 'closing' Skype isn't actually really closing it. You can notice that also by the fact that if you 'reopen' it, it is already logged in. \nYou can really close it by typing in the command line:\nkillall skype\n\nThis way it won't be saved in your working session when you log out of your computer, and so won't be automatically restored when restarting your computer.\n", "Q: Error Creating .deb File of AMD Catalyst Driver I was following the steps to install AMD Catalyst Driver from wiki.cchtml.com.\n\nWhile I was creating the .deb file the following error occured--\n\n$ sudo sh ./amd-driver-installer-catalyst-13.1-linux-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/precise\nCreated directory fglrx-install.jItiVW\nVerifying archive integrity...

After \"successful\" installation and reboot, my computer got stuck at the stage of starting X. Luckily I had made a backup of my Ubuntu partition with Clonezilla. If you're lucky, it might work under Ubuntu 12.04, but just in case I recommend making a backup first. Also perhaps it might be a better idea to install those proprietary drivers from Ubuntu repositories (start Software Sources > Additional Drivers). They gave me a functioning desktop at least, although neither Unity nor Compiz was functioning ;-)\nSo, I found the only working solution to control this fancy Hybrid Graphics Card here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics\n\n*http://asusm51ta-with-linux.blogspot.com\nAs a result, after checking that my system has got vga_switcheroo support, I've become content with automatically turning the discreet graphics on and off when I switch between AC and Battery power supply by simply adding a small executable script file named 11_hybrid_graphics_switch into the folder /etc/pm/power.d with the following contents:\n#!/bin/bash\nif on_ac_power; then\n    echo ON > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch &\nelse\n    echo OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch &\nfi\nexit 0\n\n", "Q: Keyboard volume shortcuts in XUBUNTU don't work I have a Logitech K270 but I can't get the volume button shortcuts to work. \nActually when I click them, I see the popup on the top left of the window but the volume is not changed...\ng@g-on-linux:~/LendLib$ uname -a\nLinux g-on-linux 3.5.0-25-generic #39-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 25 18:26:58 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nI am running Xubuntu - Xfce 4.10.\n\nA: After searching for the best way to do so, I found that I was over-complicating things :D\nYou can just set the Media button like here:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Go to System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts\n  \n*Click on Sound and Media.\n  \n*Assign Appropriate Keys to shortcuts for Volume up, down and mute.\n  \n\nIf it doesn't work for you, do reply!

I am really new to linux Ubuntu 12.04  and just starting to figure things out, could someone give me a install guide for the Sabrent SBT_USC6K usb to serial adapter. I have the install cd here with the drivers if needed\n\nA: As far as I can see from their driver package they provide drivers for Redhat Linux only.\nIf you look into the Linux Folder and extract the file SBT-USCxxLinux.rar you get 3 folders named Redhat73, Redhat8 and Redhat9.\nI looked some more and found several references to \"Prolific\", adapters with those chipsets are supposed to work without any additional drivers, please see if answers to the old question How to connect to a terminal to Serial-USB device on ubuntu 10.10? on Stackoverflow can help you.\n", "Q: Gwibber doesn't work I have linked two accounts to it: twitter that seems to work because it is authorised and facebook that doesn't work at all, it is impossible to authorise :\\ how to fix it? thanks!\n\nA: That looks very much like a known bug.\nIn Post #77 they mention a workaround.\n\nA: make sure your social network is signed-in before using qwibber sometimes works when you get answers like this Facebook Error app not set up.

I downloaded the .bin file.\nI have tried doing this:\nchmod a+x /file\n\nfollowed by\nsudo ./file\n\nWith the file being of course the full path of the bin file..\n(/home/username/downloads/CL1386A0.bin)\n\nI would get in response to that command not found from the terminal.\nHow to I freaking install that Dell diagnostics? no help files regarding bin files on Dell website..thanks Dell! o_o\nAnyone care to help? :)\n\nA: There is a link on the Dell website to the file you mentioned here. If you follow this link and scroll down to the Categories list, you will find a category called \"Installation Instructions\" with a green arrow next to it. Click the arrow to display the installation instructions for this file. The installation instructions include information about how to run a Diagnostic Media Creation script in Linux.\nYou should also take note that some of the installation instructions in this section apply only to computers that run Windows.\n\nA: It seems to run fine: it is not installable, as you run it from the downloaded .bin file. (If you wanted to install it, you would have to manually copy it to a system folder.)\nUse the download link from the site or run\nwget \"http://downloads.dell.com/diags/CL1386A0.bin\"\n\nNow cd to the download folder. You can find the md5 signature with\nmd5sum CL1386A0.bin\n\nand compare it to that listed under the 'checksum' drop down menu at the Dell site.\nWhile at the folder with the .bin file, make the file executable with\nchmod u+x CL1386A0.bin\n\nThe bin file is a program that allows you to make a diagnostic cd or usb, and if you run it without superuser privileges you won't be able to create your diagnostic disks, etc.\nAs this is a graphical application, gksudo is preferred, so cd to the folder with the downloaded file and run:\ngksudo ./CL1386A0.bin\n\nYou get this screen:\n\n", "Q: System Settings has two online account icons? I have two Online Accounts icons in System Settings. I'm pretty sure it's a bug.\n\nClicking the red one shows me my facebook account, Clicking the blue shows nothing, so I can probably deduce those are different applications.\nIs it possible that it's related to my switch from Unity to Gnome-Shell? (No other icon is doubling)\nIf it is, how/should I remove the Unity version?\n\nA: It is not a bug. One is gnome-online accounts and the other one is ubuntu online accounts. Removing one may affect other installed app.\n", "Q: Not able to change permission of a file to add +x I am not able to understand what is the issue here ?\nvks@vksTP:~/dropbox/shells$ ll sssh.sh\n-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1218 Mar 17 17:58 sssh.sh\nvks@vksTP:~/dropbox/shells$ sudo chmod +x sssh.sh\nvks@vksTP:~/dropbox/shells$ ll sssh.sh\n-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1218 Mar 17 17:58 sssh.sh\n\nI am not able to change the permission of the to +x. \nEdit:\nI have a dual boot machine, and I share the same dropbox folder. This dropbox folder is on a ntfs mount of my D drive for windows.

This bit is the x. Set the mask to e.g. 002 to just clear the write bit for others, and leave the r and x bits intact. \n", "Q: How can I install OpenCL in Ubuntu 12.10 with a Lenovo G570 laptop? Is it possible, and if so, how do I install OpenCL drivers for a Lenovo G570's default graphics card?\nEdit: Lenovo's website says my graphics are Intel® HD Graphics (integrated).\n\nA: I think that you have to download OpenCL for Intel, but not for the HD Graphics, as (my guess), it is not a GPU. \nSo , if you want to use OpenCL, you really need to install OpenCl to use with the CPU , that is , Intel.\nTake a look here\nhttp://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/tools/opencl-sdk\nhttp://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-opencl-sdk\np.s  My Lenovo has NVidia, then, I had installed NVidia driver and it comes with OpenCL ..\nI hope it helps you.\n", "Q: How do I show the pwd at the top of a terminal? How do I display my present working directory (PWD) at the top of a terminal? I do not want the PWD in the body of the terminal. Presently my PS1 is !:.\n\nA: I was able to get this to work by invoking lxterminal with sending pwd in backticks with the -t flag, like this:\nlxterminal -t `pwd`\n\n\nNow of course you wouldn't want to have to invoke lxterminal from terminal (that would be silly).  So you'll want to add it to your launcher panel, and edit the command properties of the lxterminal laucher to include the -t flag.\nNote that this also works with (regular) terminal as well.\n", "Q: 1:1 Backup of System on USB Thumb Drive I installed Ubuntu 12.04 from a USB drive to a USB drive (16 GB) and configured it to my needs. Now I'd like to have a 1:1 backup of the system on the USB drive and was wondering on how to accomplish that.\nI found dd seems to the trick (How to replace my disk without having to rebuild my Ubuntu install?) but I was wondering if I could run into any problems following this route.\nEg: Do I have to preformat the target USB drive? Do I have to do something special regarding the boot loader? Can I run dd from within the running system (with mounted source partitions and running processes)? I looked into the /etc/fstab and it included these lines:\nproc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\n# / was on /dev/sda1 during installation\nUUID=77d02669-c088-4e3f-9a9c-4bb1bd6b1d05 /               ext4    noatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1\n# swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation\nUUID=ca609ad6-5690-4dc6-af78-edfd3a6d0b9b none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nI guess those need to be changed when I want to boot from the backup drive?\nAny insight is welcome. Thanks.\n\nA: Just for the curious ones: dd copys the UUID of the USB drive as well so the result of the command found under the link in the questions really creates an exact copy which boots fine without any modification.\n", "Q: Problem installing ubuntu TOSHIBA Satellite P855-32U I have a new laptop which runs win 8 (UEFI firmware), I want to install Ubuntu 12.04.2 but I cannot even make the liveUSB start booting.\nI have test the USB in another laptop and I know it was created without problems.\nIf I switch the Boot Mode in BIOS from UEFI to CSM, it doesn't recognize the USB or the HDD.\nWhile booting if I press F12 sometimes it recognizes the USB sometimes not, but even when it does, if I select it the laptop boots to Windows and just ignores the USB.\n\nA: turn off secure boot and change setup order to run cd/dvd first and burn ubuntu to dvd and reboot and should start up from cd. \n\nA: I just got my hands on a Toshiba satellite p855-33C and had a similar problem. After entering the BIOS to disable \"secure\" boot and switching to CSM mode from \"advanced\" tab, I was able to boot Ubuntu 12.04 64bit from a bootable usb stick created as per ubuntu instructions. I then inserted the stick on a usb 3.0 slot and powered-up.\nI chose \"Try without install\" and the system came-up in 73 sec. Pretty decent for a live usb system. The start-up script even detected that I was using a Greek keyboard added the Greek layout to the list of available layouts and offered to change the default folder names (even though I selected English at start-up for system language - is this cool or what?).\nOn your dual-boot question I suppose that the only way is to manually switch the BIOS settings each time you want to switch OS, as this is actually a design issue (win8 will not boot otherwise - congrats to micro$oft for \"improving\" the desktop experience once again). Now as far as the win8 partitions are concerned, I am pleased to report that they are visible through Nautilus like any other normal partition. Just mount and explore/explode.\nOn a broader note, most of the hardware seems to be working properly. Bluetooth works fine, LAN is functioning properly, Function keys to increase - decrease volume and play/pause prev/next song work fine, wifi on/off doesn't work, brightness control not working. Also I'm having some trouble with the sound. Webcam works fine. \nHaving said that, most of these issues should be resolved with a full install and update of h/w drivers. I just ordered a Kingston SSD to replace the internal hdd and I'm itching to do the complete install :-)\nHope this was helpful. My apologies for the lengthy post.\nNote: In order to run the BIOS setup you need to boot to win8, then hold \"shift\" key while selecting \"Shutdown\" to force a complete shutdown. Then switch on the computer and press \"F2\" to enter BIOS setup utility.\n\nA: If you have a new video you may need to add this to your grub boot line. This lets the live cd boot in the basic video settings. \nxdriver=vesa nomodeset\n\n", "Q: ListItem.Subtitled id not defined error in Qt SDK I've made a list displayed on Tab Page, its suppose display a Subtitled List Item: conversation (An item that displays Icon + Text), I've got a button that allows the user to change the text of that List item:\nconversation.text : \"\"\n\nhowever, whenever I'm using it, Qt displays an error stating that \"conversation is not defined\" when clearly I have defined it underneath, but for some reason the button is not being able to access or see it, so is there anyway to overcome this? \nListView {\n    id: conversationList\n    anchors.fill: parent\n    model: 1\n    delegate:\n    ListItem.Subtitled {\n        id: conversation\n        icon: Qt.resolvedUrl(\"avatar_contacts_list.png\")\n    }\n}\n\nthankyou :)\n\nA: First of all: please allways show complete code examples. There is so much guessing involved in answering your question as it is now...\nI GUESS that you want to access the items in the listview by there id. In your special case there seems to be only one item (because you wrote model: 1, but in general, there are N elements. \nBased on your logic, they would all have the same id, because all are based on the same delegate. This however is not possible and the id of the delegate can only be used in the item itself. \nSince you only have one item, why do you have the ListView at all? Why not simply use the ListItem.Subtitled itself? Then you can use the id as you indent to use it.\n", "Q: Serverprocesses ending with '-d'? I just realized, that every serverprocess ends with a d?\nLike:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache: httpd\n\n*MySQL : mysqld\n\n*Unreal IRC : unrealircd\n\n\nWhy is this? Is there any reason, or is it to recognize them from each other? \n\nA: It's a convention for programs that run in the background to perform a task.\nIt means Daemon - inspired by Maxwell's Daemon, an imaginary creature from the world of physics charged with reversing entropy by sorting molecules.\n", "Q: Make linux look like windows 8 I have seen tutorials about making linux look like windows 7, but is there a tutorial about making it look like windows 8.\n\nA: No not currently, but me and my team are working on a project with he UX metro start menu for windows 8 and the exact theme of windows 8 for ubuntu 12.04LTS and above. We should hae it finished by the end of June. When we are finished i will put a link up to the themes and instructions in this conversation on ubuntu.com\n", "Q: Is there a GUI application for adjusting monitor color? I have an Asus laptop with an i5 processor, and an nVidia 610m graphics card, and an external monitor that is slightly pink. It was easy to fix this with the Windows control panel.\nSeeing that Ubuntu lacks a GUI for color adjustment/calibration I searched for the nVidia driver in hopes that I could use its control panel but my card, like many others, isn't supported (for Linux).\nI was able to import my old .icc profile from Windows but it's pretty useless to me now unless I can adjust it.\nAnd as fantastic as command-line is, color adjustment is something that really, really should be done with a GUI.\nAre there any applications out there that can create/adjust ICC profiles?\nAre there any applications that can simply adjust the monitor colors?\n\nA: Your card is supported by nvidia legacy drivers and the gui for color works fine there.\n\nA: Firstly try installing from Additional Drivers in Dash (version current-updates)I can't remember how I did my NVidia install on Ubuntu, but am pretty sure it worked with this otion.\nI also ran it manually following a guide (on Suse) but on Ubuntu it worked straight away (if you do it in non-X run-level) by installing additional drivers. If it's really important to you, back-up your system and work away. Some links:\nCommunity Ubuntu Documentation HOW-TO\nNVidia download page Where you can download drivers and check if your card is supported. As Arup says it is (it looks like, G610M is supported), but you can double check by running in terminal:\nsudo lshw -c video | grep product\nand compare with the list they provide (claim ;). Just make sure you install the proper one, preferably Legacy (304) version.\nHere's another how-to - read it and especially comments (cause it looks familiar to me).\nHope you'll manage.\n", "Q: Desktop environment in Ubuntu I have a Dell Optiplex GX270 that I wanted to run Ubuntu 12.04 on, after installing it on VirtualBox it was very sluggish and was using 100% CPU so I switched the desktop environment to LXDE but it installed Openbox and GNOME/Openbox is it safe to remove them is it also safe to remove Unity? If it is safe how would I remove them?\nThanks\n\nA: You may do the below two things:\n[1] Go to Startup-Applications from the main menu on the top, and disable all unneeded services such as bluetooth-monitor, sharing-service, etc.\n(Sometimes, all startup items are hidden from view by default for security purposes. If that is the case, then issue below command in a terminal, and then open the startup applet:\nsudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop\n\n)\n[2] Login in Ubuntu-2D mode instead of the default one.\n[3] In your virtual machine settings, check how much RAM you have actually allocated to your vm.

AFAIK, Unity is based on 3D graphic operations only and it MAY cause these problems.\nTherefore, it seems to be related to my old graphics card.

Anyway, I just loaded ubuntu onto my desktop machine (Dual booted) and everything went fine. The only issue, is that (I have been researching my problem for a while and have decided this is the issue) the gaming keyboard that I have plugged in to the machine isn't supported by the kernel.\nI found this: http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-usb/msg62270.html\nWhich is somebody else who had the same problem, and fixed it by applying that patch to their kernel.

The machine is dual booted, and it works perfectly fine with windows 7, and it works perfectly in the bios and starting up until the moment that ubuntu loads.\n\nA: The best way how to apply a patch is installing a new kernel binary. That's the easier way for most of the population.\nIf you have Ubuntu 12.10, the last kernel binary could be found here:\n - http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\nUnder directory \"v3.6.3-quantal\" (date 21-Oct-2012 18:04).\nYour referenced patch date is Wed, 25 Apr 2012, so I guess that the 3.6.3 will already contain it (will check in a few moments).\nIn order to install the kernel packages, please follow steps described here:\n - How do I add the kernel PPA?\n\nA: You have basically two options.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, to find a prebuilt kernel which includes that patch.\nIf the patch is good (i.e. accepted by the community), there is a possibility that someone already distributes kernels with it. (Maybe even, in the best case, the latest  distributions' releases include it already.)\nHowever, as you may know, installing binary files from varios third parties has all sorts of trust issues.\n\n*Compile the kernel yourself.\nIn this case be sure to read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile carefully.\n", "Q: Why does Wireless on my OEM 32bit notebook not work?

It has created a separate boot option in uefi boot mode. So everytime I need to run ubuntu I have to go to bios setup, change the boot order and select ubuntu there and restart machine and similar for windows 8.\nSo is there any option I can add ubuntu boot details to windows boot loader or window booting details to ubuntu efi boot option.\nThanks\n\nA: You can add Windows entries to your GRUB menu (Ubuntu bootloader) via the Recommended Repair of Boot-Repair.\n\nA: Are you positive that Ubuntu is booting in EFI mode? Check for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you're booting in EFI mode. If it's absent, you're probably booting in BIOS mode.\nIf you're booting in EFI mode, then you can reconfigure GRUB to boot Windows, too, and the Boot Repair tool recommended by LovinBuntu will do this, although in an inelegant way that may create complications in the future. Alternatively, you can edit the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file and add an entry like this to it:\nmenuentry \"Windows 8\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt1)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nYou may need to change the set root= line to point to your EFI System Partition (ESP). Typing sudo update-grub will probably get it working. This option isn't guaranteed to work, though; GRUB is pretty finicky about booting Windows in EFI mode, and what works on one system might not work on another.\nIf you're not booting in EFI mode, then using Boot Repair will just make matters worse. If you're in this boat, then I recommend you check your firmware to be sure that Secure Boot is disabled (it's enabled by default on Windows 8 systems) and either re-install Ubuntu in EFI mode or install an EFI-mode boot loader. The latter can be tricky if you don't know what you're doing, though. See my Web page on the topic for details about what's available and how to do it.\n", "Q: Requires installation of untrusted packages I have been trying to update Ubuntu, but these three updates below are not letting me update anything else.

In short, as compared to the historical method on Windows or Mac, where you go to various websites, download the piece of software you want, and install it, most Linux distributions (Ubuntu included) rely on a repository.  The repository is a community resource administered by maintainers that is basically a huge source of available software for your machine.  The upside is that installing software from the repository ensures that you do not install rogue software (i.e., malware), and that all software on your machine stays automatically up-to-date.\nWhenever the community repositories update a package, they also update meta information about the package (the version number, basically).  The meta information includes a digital signature that ensures that when you download the update, that you downloaded the correct update, and that it wasn't corrupted in transit.  The message you are receiving is basically saying that the package updates you would be downloading do not match what your copy of the repository indexes suggest they should be.  Nine times out of ten, this means that you need to grab an updated copy of the indexes.  Hence, sudo apt-get update is your friend.\nFor more information on \"this repository thing,\" check out the Ubuntu wiki entry.\n", "Q: Samsung Series 5 getting hot I've just installed Ubuntu 12.04.02 64bit on my Samsung however I noticed it is getting too hot :(\nIt has 2 VGAs (Intel HD4000 & Nvidia GT 630M 2GB) however I'm using only Intel.

When I hit reply to an email, the recipient's signature i removed if it is preceded by \"--\". Is there a way to stop this in Thunderbird? Many thanks! \n\nA: This behavior is actually by design.  The \"-- \" (dash-dash-space line) is the \"signature cut line\" and is placed by conforming mail clients (e.g., Thunderbird, Gmail, etc.) for precisely the reason that they can be trimmed automatically from responses.\nSome background: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature_block\nI believe they originally came out of Usenet circles, and the idea was that if someone had posted to a list, the signature was already recorded and seen by subscribers.  Since bandwidth was at a premium (is still, worldwide), cutting it would not needlessly waste time, space, and money.\nAs far as actively including it when replying, I don't know of a way.  Either trawl the Thunderbird extensions, or hire someone to build one for you.\n\nA: Thunderbird has a hidden option to do this. Go to Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> General -> Config Editor…\nFilter on mail.strip_sig_on_reply and toggle the preference to false.\n", "Q: Install Kernel to Other Partition I have two Linux partitions, each running Ubuntu 12.04. One I was using as a legitimate partition for all my real computing. The other I was using as a honeycomb and a fallback partition. However, while working in the legit partition, I was apt-get installing and removing and I must have accidentally included a * or something. The kernel ended up being removed.

I was messing around with Cinnamon and GNOME and trying new things out and I got carried away.\nThe entire filesystem from the legit partition seems to be intact, and the /boot directory had only a grub folder in it and a memtest file.\nHow can I install a kernel into the legit partition, FROM the honeycomb?\n\nA: You could do a chroot into the partition with missing kernel:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo mkdir /mnt/ubuntu\n\n*sudo mount /dev/ubuntuPartitionWithMissingKernel /mnt/ubuntu\n\n*sudo mount -t proc proc /mnt/ubuntu/proc\n\n*sudo mount -t sysfs sys /mnt/ubuntu/sys\n\n*sudo mount -t devtmpfs /dev /mnt/ubuntu/dev\n\n*sudo mount -t devpts /dev/pts /mnt/ubuntu/dev/pts\n\n*sudo cp -L /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/ubuntu/etc/resolv.conf\n\n*sudo chroot /mnt/ubuntu /bin/bash\n\n*source /etc/profile\nThen you can install the missing kernel via apt-get. (I'm not sure if you have to update the bootloader configuration file afterwards or if it is done automatically after installing the kernel. If not run sudo update-grub).\nYou don't have to chroot from your honeycomb, you can use a Ubuntu LiveCD for that.\nIf you aren't able to install the kernel via apt-get you can copy the initrd.img file and the vmlinuz file from a LiveCD in /boot to /boot in your partition without kernel and update the bootloader, this way it'll at least boot.\n", "Q: Trying to install Erlang on Ubuntu 12.04, error with make install I am trying to install Erlang R16B on my laptop with Ubuntu 12.04.

I have gcc 4.6.3 installed:\ngcc --version\n\ngcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) 4.6.3\n\nI have installed newer version:\napt-get install gcc-4.7\n\nBut i still get result \"gcc 4.6.3\" when I type gcc --version. How to fix it? \nI am using ubuntu 12.04 and i have done\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nA: This is because you have both versions installed, with 4.6 being treated as the default one.\nYou can explicitly choose which one to use.\n$ gcc-4.7 --version\ngcc-4.7 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.2-22ubuntu4) 4.7.2\n[...]\n\n$ gcc-4.6 --version\ngcc-4.6 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-15ubuntu3) 4.6.3\n[...]\n\nThe easiest way make gcc-4.7 the default gcc is to move the symlink of /usr/bin/gcc:\nsudo rm /usr/bin/gcc\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-4.7 /usr/bin/gcc\n\n\nA: If you are looking for installation of old version of gcc, then install directly from command line. For instance if you want install gcc-4.4.6, and latest available version is 4.7.3. If you type:\nsudo apt-get install gcc\n\nthen by default latest version will be installed. To install gcc-4.4.6, just type:\nsudo apt-get install gcc-4.4\n\nBut still your default compiler is latest gcc. To remove latest gcc as default type:\nsudo rm /usr/bin/gcc\n\nNow making gcc-4.4.6 as default compiler (this is replacement of gcc by gcc-4.4.x), type:\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-4.4 /usr/bin/gcc\n\nHope this will clarify above mentioned problem.\n\nA: please follow this instruction:\nBuild gcc (Here: version: 4.7.2)\ntar -xf gcc-4.7.2.tar.bz2\nmkdir gcc-build\ncd gcc-build\n../gcc-4.7.2/configure --enable-languages=c,c++\nmake -j 4\nmake install\nmake clean          (OPTIONAL)\ncd ..\n\nCurrently, the self-check of the gcc is not working, so this step is omitted here.\nNow you should check that the new compiler version 4.7.2 is called instead of the compiler used for the build process (here gcc-4.5.3). Enter the following commands:\ngcc --version; g++ --version\n\nThe new compiler has been installed in /usr/local/bin. It is now the default compiler, because in the PATH variable /usr/local/bin  is before /usr/bin.\n", "Q: x-server won't start - black screen (after purging *nvidia* files on HD4000 system) For about three months now I've been trying to fix a problem with my x-server.\nThe problem occured after lightdm starts as usual.

I don't understand how purging a useless driver on a intel HD 4000 graphics machine can result in a black screen. This confuses me most.\n\n*reconfiguring xserver-xorg\n\n*set kdm instead of lightdm\n\n*start xserver from console using startx -v: first resulted in the errors attached below, now delivers X: /tmp/.X11-unix has suspicious mode (not 1777) or is not a directory, aborting.\nxinit: giving up\nxinit: connection to server lost\n\n*sudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg xorg plymouth-x11\n\n*reinstalled the kernel: I can't explain myself how this could possibly NOT fix the black screen problem, the newer kernels as mine (...0.23) all have the HD4000 drivers on board, it must have the correct drivers now! So in my opinion this can't be a graphics issue, but the blackscreen appeared the next time after purging the nvidia drivers.\n\n*add the x-swat repository and install HD4000-driver from there: again nothing\n\n*boot from live-media: drops back to busybox initramfs interface\n\n*boot without quiet option\n\n*boot without splash: enables me to get at least reliable access to console login & interface\n\n*boot with nomodeset quiet splash: works sometimes an brings me to console login & interface, sometimes not\n\n\nAs mentioned a new account created as a test worked, so I thought there might be a problem with the authorities. But checking an changing the owners' rights of files known to cause such problems. Unfortunately this didn't solve the problem.\nAfter some webresearch I found out that nvidia driver updates recently caused similiar problems, so i removed and purged the driver files.

Ubuntu's System Setting/Details shows 3.7GB (but this small decrease is not a great issue for me)\nQuestion:\nIs this a possible Ubuntu issue or it has to do with my pc hardware (faulty memory, etc..)?\nSorry, I am a noobie, but what I mean is: if it should be an Ubuntu issue, would the BIOS show the right RAM amount (8GB)? Or Ubuntu \"affects\" also what is shown in the BIOS settings?\nThanks a lot in advance for your patience and for your help with this.\nAlex\n\nA: If the BIOS shows only 4GB, it's a hardware problem. One of your chips is not working, or quite possibly, one of your chips is not properly seated. (Or you actually have 4GB.)\nUnder Linux, the command sudo dmidecode -t 6 (from the dmidecode  package) will tell you which memory banks have a chip connected and what size chip. If some banks are reported empty but you think there is a chip in them, take the cheap out and insert it back, making sure to seat it properly.\n", "Q: \"Could not retrieve the required disk image files\" when using wubi.exe + iso in same folder I've downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 iso + wubi installer and put the both of them in the same directory. I get an error when running the installer (with no internet connection). Here's the log: http://pastebin.com/Tzv4EwNX What am I doing wrong? I'm trying to install the 64 bit version on Windows 7.\n\nA: This is the problem:\n03-18 01:11 DEBUG  Distro:   checking Ubuntu ISO C:\\Users\\Ofer\\Desktop\\ubuntu-12.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso\n03-18 01:11 DEBUG  Distro:     does not contain casper\\vmlinuz\n\nI know this is an existing bug in the development release 13.04, but I wasn't aware it was in 12.04.2 as well. There is no workaround to this, because you'd have to update the ISO (possible but painful).\nReference: https://bugs.launchpad.net/wubi/+bug/1134770 (just updated with this latest info).\nWorkarounds\nYou could either use the 12.04.1 Wubi.exe with the 12.04.1 ISO available at old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/12.04.1/\nOr you could use the 12.10 Wubi.exe plus the 12.10 ISO.\n\nA: Download the latest wubi release from http://ftp.ticklers.org/releases.ubuntu.org/releases//precise/wubi.exe\nPut this in the ISO and replace the previous file. You should be good now.\n\nA: I have just successfully installed ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-i386 using the latest wubi version; as Igniterminator said: early days.\nBut before that I failed to install it by the  wubi supplied in the .iso file. I referred to the log file and found out that one of the causes was that the iso-inclued wubi only supported 12.04.2 but not 12.04.3. I guessed that the older wubi was integrated to the newer .iso file by mistake.\nBTW, another problem prevented me from installation is that wubi automatically downloaded the amd64 version, though I chose to install the i386 version. I solved this problem by runing  Wubi from the command prompt with the --32bit argument (you can refer to the Wubi guide).\nTo sum up, used the latest wubi and forced the wubi to install the 32-bit version of Ubuntu, and I managed to install it.

Not being an expert in either Linux not Unix I'm wondering what the difference between these 2 method of stringing 2 commands on the same line?

The first argument is evaluated, and the second one is evaluated only if the first one returns true. The reason is that \"false AND something\" is always false, so no need to evaluate the second argument in this case.\nSo using && you make sure that the second command is not executed if the first one reports an error (true is represented by the exit code 0, which indicates that there was no error). In contrast, ; executes both commands, no matter what the outcome of the first one is.\nConclusion: Chaining commands with && is a good habit. In contrast to ; it won't execute subsequent commands if something went wrong.\n\nA: ;\nSequentially executes the commands, no matter what the previous exit status was:\n# sh -c \"exit 0\" ; echo \"2nd command\"\n2nd command\n# sh -c \"exit 1\" ; echo \"2nd command\"\n2nd command\n\n&&\nLogical AND\nExecute the next command, but only if the previous command succeeded (the exit status was 0):\n# sh -c \"exit 0\" && echo \"2nd command\"\n2nd command\n# sh -c \"exit 1\" && echo \"2nd command\"\n#\n\n||\nLogical OR\nExecute the next command, but only if the previous command failed (the exit status was not 0):\n# sh -c \"exit 0\" || echo \"2nd command\"\n#\n# sh -c \"exit 1\" || echo \"2nd command\"\n2nd command\n\n", "Q: laptop screen won't show up I just installed ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop, and for some reason I can't use the laptop screen WITHOUT an external monitor; it functions fine as the only monitor in windows 8, and it functions fine as the primary monitory in a dual monitor setup in ubuntu...it just doesn't work as the ONLY monitor in ubuntu.

Given the symptoms, it's possible that some library files were corrupted when they were installed.\nReboot and run a memory test. Let it run for at least one full pass (keep it running over lunch or overnight). If any of the RAM chips is faulty, change it immediately.\nIf you can compare the library files on your system with a clean installation, single-bit errors always at the same bit position are a sure sign of faulty RAM (but the error can follow other patterns as well).\nIf you've identified bad RAM, verify every file on your system against good versions, including all your data. Beware that backups may themselves have become corrupted. Don't attempt restoring anything until you know that the RAM is good.\n\nA: You can try to reinstall manually some of the packages that provide those files (libc6 and libstdc++6), but I doubt it would help. Those segfaults should have other origin.\nDownload the debs from here and here. Then install each using dpkg:\nsudo dpkg -i /path/to/each/file.deb\n\nreboot and check if you get less errors. If so you can try to reproduce the same procedure to each file (use apt-file to find which package provide each file).\nAlso if you know when the system started to misbehave you can try to check /var/log/apt/history.log and see if there was any update/package installation that could be causing this.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Permission Issues with command in rc.local I am using a command to start a screen session and run a bash script for a user.\n/bin/su username -c \"/usr/bin/screen -dmS test bash -c '/home/username/test.sh; exec bash'\"\nWhen I boot, I am seeing the screen session appear for that user, but when I open it, I see a permission denied error.\nI checked permissions on the file and it is:\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 username www-data    816 Feb 18 00:59 test.sh\nAnyone have a theory why I am seeing this error?

Run chmod +x /home/username/test.sh to make it executable.\nIf test.sh is doing things like setting environment variables, they only survive for the duration of the process. So if you run /home/username/test.sh; exec bash then the final interactive shell won't have the environment variables from that process. To keep the environment variables, set them in the parent bash process: source the script, instead of running it as a separate program.\n/bin/su username -c \"/usr/bin/screen -dmS test bash -c '. ~/test.sh; exec bash'\"\n\n", "Q: How to find internal hard drive when booting from USB? Trying to rescue a friend's computer. Put Ubuntu 12.10 on a Flash drive, changed the boot order, and fired it up; no problem. But now that I'm in, I can't seem to find the internal drive!\nAny thoughts? I ran sudo fdisk -l in the Terminal and got this:\nDisk /dev/sdb: 15.6 GB, 15610576896 bytes\n119 heads, 55 sectors/track, 4658 cylinders, total 30489408 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0xc3072e18\n\n   Device Boot     Start         End      Blocks  Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *       8064    30489407    15240672   c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)\n\n99% sure that's the flash drive; it's 16GB. If that is the internal drive, I'm just not sure how to mount it. When I tried to mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/point it told me mount: only root can do that.\n\nA: The few times I've done that sort of thing, I used Puppy linux, (newer version is called Slacko), and previous to that Knoppix and AntiX, which were supposed to be better at \"finding\" hard drives.  Best, and easiest way to make a USB, in my opinion,is to use LinuxLive. If the drive is readable, should show up on the desktop in the lower left corner, and you can just click on it.  Hope this helps.\n\nA: See the comments for more info on this question, but I think the only real problem was that the hard drive is damaged. Reboots and prayer were the only thing making it go...we'd reboot, see it mounted, copy some stuff, then it would presumable hit a bad sector, freeze/go gray, and disappear until we rebooted again.\n", "Q: Text editor that can wrap text in predefined HTML tags like Notepad++ I'm new to Ubuntu and am trying to figure out some things. In Notepad++ it is possible to use WebEdit plugin and define keyboard shortcuts for different HTML tags. E. g. \"Ctrl + p\" can wrap the text in paragraph tags.\nIs there such an option in some of Ubuntu's editors. Gedit seems quite slim without plugins so I have installed Geany which seems more powerful, but I can't find such a plugin.\nThank you in advance for your suggestions.\n\nA: Found it! Bluefish does it (http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html). It's powerful, simple and available in Software Center (old version though). It seems that it isn't very popular or at least talked about on forums (never heard of it before), but it seems as capable as Notepad++. The only problem is that it's quite complicated to change the shortcuts, but the existing ones aren't that bad either.\n\nA: Sublime Text, isn't free nor open source.\nI recommend that you look at Geany or Eclipse. Geany is a 'basic' IDE. Geany is to Gedit, on ubuntu, as Notepad++ is to Notepad on Windows. \nEclipse, is a full featured and robust IDE. If you're willing to put in the effort to learn how to use it - it can really kick ass and has plugins (perspectives, etc) for practically any programming task you could find yourself facing. \nI personally use Geany for one-off text editing and Eclipse for focused project work. While I'm not sure that they specifically have the ability to \"wrap\" text as you described. I'm certain that both offer code completion in many situations. Snippets, etc.\n\nA: Can you use Sublime Text for example, multi-plataform and high recommended by professional developers, and to create plugins are very easy.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 installation hang on console screen : \"Output LVDS-1 is running on CRTC 1 using output A\" I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 (32 bits) on a (rather old) HP Pavilion zd7010CA laptop.

Once I have it configured with a base Data set I want to Snapshot that and be able to hand it off to my development partners to use. Basically I want to be able to clone/snapshot a ready to use LAMP server.\nI am under the impression I would want to assign a static IP / Hostname and then open port 3306 using iptables. I would then provide this info to anyone using this database server.\nTo that end I am installing Ubuntu Server 12.04 and LAMP and then following the standard tutorials on setting a static IP.

But it has been almost two and a half hours and ubuntu is still stock on that process. Is that normal? I gave ubuntu 200 Gb and the total of the hard drive is 640GB.\n\nA: No, that is not normal. Normal is taking 1-5 minutes. You should make sure your installation media is good and start again. If you get the same problem twice you should go into the bios and turn off as many extra features as you can: I'm thinking touchpad and switchable graphics. If you're overwriting windows 8 your probably having a problem with secure boot. Good luck.\n\nA: Definetly it is not normal. Try another media or whether possible, a USB stick, which is quicker as well.\nFor instance, I've just finished the installation of my Ubuntu (using it right now) and created / resized some partitions on a 1TB disk. Even formatting the partitions was pretty quick, took just few seconds.\nIf it still taking too long, try booting with a live distro in order to check the disk.\n", "Q: Best way to encrypt file on Ubuntu but readable on a Windows machine?

You can achieve this easily by using a program called unetbootin (http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/). You can install it from the Ubuntu Software Center (or the package manager interface of your choice) or by typing sudo apt-get install unetbootin. If you are on Windows or Mac OS X right now, you can download it from the website.\nTo install the Ubuntu ISO on the pendrive just go through the steps provided by unetbootin. You probably need admin permissions on windows or root permission on Mac OS X or GNU/Linux.\nPendrive as installation target\nIf you really want to install Ubuntu to a pendrive (not using it as installation medium, but as \"main harddrive\" for your Ubuntu), one way is to simply install it to the pendrive via the regular installer. Theres another way providing some kind of hybrid mode between installation and Live-Medium, but I don't really know how this works.\n", "Q: Read out loud feature on acroread I just installed adobe reader 9(acroread ) package from the ubuntu software center.

Is it possible to do it with avconv?\n\nA: Additional method with avconv is to use vflip and hflip filters. Should run faster and maybe better quality:\navconv -i video.mp4 -vf vflip,hflip out.mp4\n\n\nA: It is possible using the transpose video filter. You cannot rotate by 180 degrees, but you can rotate by 90 degrees and chain the filter.\navconv -i video.mp4 -vf transpose=1,transpose=1 out.mkv\n\nSee transpose in the avconv manpage:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/quantal/en/man1/avconv.1.html\n\nA: Yes, but you'll need to add some additional options to your command for it to work properly. Transpose and vflip/hflip should do the trick, but if you don't tell avconv more detail about what you want, you'll likely get very low quality output try:\n avconv -i original.mp4 -vf \"hflip,vflip\" -codec:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 20 -codec:a copy flipped.mp4\n\nNotice the -crf option. That sets the output quality. It goes from 0 (lossless) upwards logarithmically. You'll probably want a value between 19 and 25 in most cases. -preset sets the speed of the encoding, either \"slow\", \"medium\", or \"fast\". Slow should get you smaller file sizes with an obvious tradeoff. You should adjust -codec:v to match the original. If you don't set these options you'll get the defaults, which don't work well when flipping iphone video.\n\nA: I did this:\navconv -i invertedOne.mp4 -c:a copy -vf \"hflip,vflip\" rightOne.mp4\n\nFull HD video, great results with non perceivable quality loss\n\nA: For avconv or ffmpeg Under 14.04 or later\nThere have been some changes to the libav documentation since @phoibos quality answer to this question. You can rotate a video 180 degrees avoiding flipping entirely by chaining 2 90 degree commands together (separated by a comma) I accomplished this with the command\navconv -i inputfile -vf transpose=clock,transpose=clock outputfile\nfor clockwise rotation.\nin ffmpeg the syntax is the same.\nffmpeg -i inputfile -vf transpose=clock,transpose=clock outputfile\nwhere inputfile is your supported input video file and outputfile is your desired output file.\nFor counter clockwise rotation replace clock with cclock\nSources:\nhttps://libav.org/avconv.html#transpose\nTesting on Ubuntu 14.04.5 and 16.04 LTS\n", "Q: 'Client not found in Kerberos database' when joining domain with Likewise I have installed Lubuntu and I'm trying to connect it to my works Domain, but I'm getting an error from Likewise -\n\nLW_ERROR_KRB5KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN - \n  Client not found it Kerberos database\n\nAt first I thought this could be because Linux did not create a computer object in the OU when joining to a domain, so I created on with the name that I was giving the computer and tried again, but I got the same error.\nI really have no clue why this is happening, so I wonder if any one can give me some pointers?

This will setup Ubuntu on a different partition and allow you to boot into Ubuntu.  \n\n*You can uninstall Ubuntu like you would any other Windows Program. \n\n\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer \n\nA: Dustin, you do need a flash drive or DVD/CD if you want that, and it is definitely a worthy investment and these days isn't expensive at all. Even after installing Ubuntu and replacing Windows 7 with Ubu (good decision from your part!), you always have a Live image to boot your PC,if anything would happen, or other PCs with to show others without installing, or write future releases of Ubuntu onto the medium!\n\nA: If you install Wubi from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\nThis installs ubuntu inside windows and then migrate wubi to a partition instructions  in link below\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MigrateWubi\n\nA: remember to restore the grub for ubuntu , other wise it may cause some problem during boot up of the ubuntu u install \nhttp://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd\n", "Q: Can I force window to open on top of other windows when opened by keyboard shortcut? I use SpaceFM as my primary file manager on Ubuntu. I typically open folder directly by keyboard shortcuts, so, e.g. Ctrl+Super+W opens my Work folder.\nSpecifically, I use execute the command spacefm -w /home/rasmus/Work/ by the above shortcut, with the -w ensuring that SpaceFM opens a new window.\nHowever, this new window is not always open on top of the last active window on the workspace. This is rather annoying, as it means I sometimes have to \"dig\" for the newly opened window.\nSo, my question is: Is there something additional I can add to the executed command that will ensure that the fresh window is opened on top?\nAlternative solutions to the same effect are welcome.\n\nA: As spacefm used single process. New command just pass signal to the running process and this creates the new window at level just above its last created window.\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n\n*\n\n*With function: It has 1sec delay.\nsfm() { spacefm $* & pid=`pgrep spacefm | head -1`; sleep 1;  wmctrl -i -R `wmctrl -lp | grep \" $pid\" | tail -1 | awk '{ print $1 }'` }\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Run spacefm with same arguments $* were passed to the function, & in background\n\n*pgrep spacefm | head -1 get PID of main process which is in the head then store it in pid variable\n\n*sleep 1 wait for new process to terminal, to avoid raise of two windows (I don't know why, try removing it)\n\n*wmctrl -lp get window list | grep \" $pid\" filter related ones to $pid, | tail -1 filter last line/window then | awk '{ print $1 }' filter out window id (WID) which is in the first column $1\n\n*wmctrl -i -R WID  Move the window WID to the current desktop, raise the  window, and give it focus.\n\n\n*With alias: This will raise 2 windows the new one on the top but simpler.\nalias sfm=\"wmctrl -i -R \\`wmctrl -lp | grep ' $(pgrep spacefm)' | tail -1 | awk '{ print $1 }'\\`; spacefm\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*wmctrl -lp get window list | grep \" $pid\" filter related ones to spacefm, | tail -1 filter last line/window then | awk '{ print $1 }' filter out window id (WID) which is in the first column $1\n\n*wmctrl -i -R WID  Move the window WID to the current desktop, raise the  window, and give it focus.\n\n*Run spacefm with arguments coming after. The new window will be created on the top.\n\n\n\n- How to use: similar way to the original command.\n    sfm -w /home/rasmus/Work/\n\nReferences: Please look for the man pages.\n\nA: It's an old question but still relevant, so I'll add an alternative solution.\nThis sounds like a result of Compiz' focus prevention, trying to prevent windows from \"stealing\" focus while you're working somewhere else.\nFocus prevention can be set to different levels (default: low) or completely disabled through CompizConfig Settings Manager.\nIf not installed yet, do this by running:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nThen, run it with ccsm, navigate to General Options, switch to the tab Focus & Raise Behaviour and change the field Focus Prevention Level (in your case, you'll probably want Off).\n", "Q: Upgrade by restoring back up I am upgrading my ubuntu 12.04 to 12.10, and my question is, after upgrading ubuntu, if i make back up of 12.10 then install 12.04 again and then if i restore the backup, will 12.04 upgrade to 12.10?\nplease answer immediately,\nthanks\n\nA: If you restore a Full-Backup of your system on a Bare-Metal you will have the identical system that you have backuped. If everything goes well, you will have a running ubuntu 12.10, but this is not an upgrade - it is deleteing or overwriting all existing files and replace them with you backup.\nNot every Backup-Software is able to make a Bare-Metal-Restore.\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu shipped with firefox? I'm just curious, and some of my friends too. Personally I think \"chromium-browser\" is better (faster, less crashing) than \"firefox\", and, why Ubuntu not shipped with more than 1 web browser?\n\nA: There's no reason to come with more than one browser pre-installed as that will just take up more space on any installation media. It isn't difficult to download a variety of others one everything is installed.\nAs for why Firefox, I would say that the ethics of Firefox as a open source web browser match more with Ubuntu than that of the Google sponsored Chrome or it's open sourced experimental arm with Chromium.\n\nA: From an interview in 2011:\n\nCanonical founder Mark Shuttleworth is a big fan of Google Chrome, and says the browser could replace the standard Firefox in future versions of Ubuntu Linux. <..>\n<..>In fact, Shuttleworth says, \"We looked at it closely in the last cycle and the decision was to stick with Firefox in 11.10.\"\n11.10 is the next version of Ubuntu, to be released in October as part of Canonical's twice-a-year release cycle. Chrome probably won't replace Firefox in 12.04, due out in April 2012, either, because that will be the long-term support version, making it an unlikely candidate for major changes.\n\"That probably keeps us on Firefox for another year, at least, and we'll see from there,\" Shuttleworth said.\nIf that sounds like a wishy-washy answer, Shuttleworth also made it clear that he is a believer in the future of Chrome on Linux.\nThe work Google is doing with the Chrome operating system, which runs the Chrome browser on top of a generic version of Linux, \"is having a hugely positive impact on the performance of Chrome on Linux,\" Shuttleworth said.\n\nSo... it is up for discussion (as are all other default packages) with every release that is not LTS. This time around Firefox wins. Maybe next release it will be Chromium.\n\nWhy Ubuntu not shipped with more than 1 web browser.\n\nUbuntu ships with at least 10 browsers: you can find them in Ubuntu Software Center. There is of course only 1 default browser and as such only 1 is installed directly. In our case Firefox but you are seconds away from installing another one.\n\nA: One reason may be because Webkit has so many rendering issues? According to this article \"jQuery Core has more lines of fixes and patches for WebKit than any other browser. In general these are not recent regressions, but long-standing problems that have yet to be addressed.\"\nUbuntu developers might also see the Firefox as more community driven vs more Apple & Google driven development, which may be another reason they continue with Firefox.\n", "Q: Admin to root privileges I'm trying to put up a CS:S(srcds) server, but when I use the given instructions, the terminal says that I don't have the permission to change it.\nMy account is an admin account right now.

I want to go around the root login, and only use my admin account.\n\nA: If you follow this guide: http://www.srcds.com/db/engine.php?id=1098643920\nThis guide should guide you through the installation part.

I can't figure out why I'm getting the following results:\nls -l tells me the size of a given file (HISTORY) is \"581944\":\n$ ls -l HISTORY \n-rw-rw-r-- 1 waldyrious waldyrious 581944 Feb 22 10:59 HISTORY\n\nls -s says it is \"572\":\n$ ls -s HISTORY\n572 HISTORY\n\nI obviously need to make the values use a comparable scale. So first I confirm that using --block-size 1 in ls -l gives me the same result as before:\n$ ls -l --block-size 1 HISTORY \n-rw-rw-r-- 1 waldyrious waldyrious 581944 Feb 22 10:59 HISTORY\n\nThen I do the same to ls -s to get a value in the same scale:\n$ ls -s --block-size 1 HISTORY \n585728 HISTORY\n\nDifferent results! 581944 ≠ 585728.\nI tried generating comparable values the other way around, using -k, but I get:\n$ ls -lk HISTORY \n-rw-rw-r-- 1 waldyrious waldyrious 569 Feb 22 10:59 HISTORY\n$ ls -sk HISTORY \n572 HISTORY\n\nAgain, different results, 569 ≠ 572.\nI tried specifying --si to make sure both options were using the same scale, to no avail:\n$ ls -lk --si HISTORY \n-rw-rw-r-- 1 waldyrious waldyrious 582k Feb 22 10:59 HISTORY\n$ ls -sk --si HISTORY \n586k HISTORY\n\n...again, different values: 582k ≠ 586k.\nI tried searching the web but the only thing I could find that seemed relevant was this:\n\nSome files have \"holes\" in them, so that the usage listed by ls -s (...) is less than the file size listed by ls -l.\"\n\n(note that in my results the opposite happens: ls -s returns sizes bigger than ls -l, not smaller.)\nMeanwhile, this page says that\n\nthere is no elegant way to detect Unix file holes.\n\nSo, how can I deal with this discrepancy? Which of these values can be considered correct? Could this possibly be a bug in ls?\n\nA: Short answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*ls -l gives the size of the file (= the amount of data it contains)\n\n*ls -s --block-size 1 gives the size of the file on the file system\n\n\nLet's create two files:\nA sparse file of 128 bytes length (A sparse file is a file containing empty blocks, see Sparse File):\n# truncate -s 128 f_zeroes.img\n# hexdump -vC f_zeroes.img \n00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000020  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000030  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000040  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000050  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000060  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000070  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000080\n\nAnother file with random data, also of 128 bytes size:\n# dd if=/dev/urandom of=f_random.img bs=1 count=128\n# hexdump -vC f_random.img \n00000000  bc 82 9c 40 04 e3 0c 23  e6 76 79 2f 95 d4 0e 45  |...@...#.vy/...E|\n00000010  19 c6 53 fc 65 83 f8 58  0a f7 0e 8f d6 d6 f8 b5  |..S.e..X........|\n00000020  6c cf 1b 60 cb ef 06 c6  d0 99 c6 16 3f d3 95 02  |l..`........?...|\n00000030  85 1e b7 80 27 93 27 92  d0 52 e8 72 54 25 4d 90  |....'.'..R.rT%M.|\n00000040  11 59 a2 d9 0f 79 aa 23  2d 44 3d dd 8d 17 d9 36  |.Y...y.#-D=....6|\n00000050  f5 ae 07 a8 c1 b4 cb e1  49 9e bc 62 1b 4f 17 53  |........I..b.O.S|\n00000060  95 13 5a 1c 2a 7e 55 b9  69 a5 50 06 98 e7 71 83  |..Z.*~U.i.P...q.|\n00000070  5a d0 82 ee 0b b3 91 82  ca 1d d0 ec 24 43 10 5d  |Z...........$C.]|\n00000080\n\nSo, as you can see in the hex representation, both files have the same amount of data, although the content is quite different.\nNow, let us look at the directory:\n# ls -ls --block-size 1 f_*\n1024 -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 128 Mar 18 15:34 f_random.img\n   0 -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 128 Mar 18 15:32 f_zeroes.img\n   ^                         ^\n   |                         |\nAmount which the           Actual file size\nfiles takes on the fs\n\nThe first value is given by the -s --block-size 1 option, it is the amount of space used by the file on the file system. \nAs you can see, the sparse file takes up zero space, since the file system (ext3 in this case) was smart enough to recognize that it only contains zeroes. Also, the file with random data takes up 1024 bytes on the disk!\nThe value depends on how the underlying file system treats files (block size, sparse file capability, ...).\nIn the sixth column is the size of the file if you would read it - it is the amount of data the file contains and it's 128 bytes for both files!\n\nA: ls -s tells you the allocated size of the file, always a multiple of the allocation unit. ls -l tells the actual size.\nAn easy way to test:\n$ echo 1 > sizeTest\n$ ls -l --block-size 1 sizeTest \n-rw-rw-r-- 1 g g 2 Mär 18 15:18 sizeTest\n$ ls -s --block-size 1 sizeTest \n4096 sizeTest\n\n", "Q: Cannot get correct privileges using Samba on NFS mounted partition I have read/scanned for Samba/NFS problems and answers on the forum, which were quite interesting, many thanks for those :) Setting up NFS can be quite a pain in the ... but getting a warning before the problems arise is really a nice thing to have.\nMy problem:\nI installed two PC's with Ubuntu/Kubuntu, both as server, but need some help getting things right. Ubuntu is working fine, on both machines (called P and N), and I installed Samba on machine P to make an easy interface with all the Windows machines in the office, and installed NFS client on the same machine P. The other machine N is setup with NFS server.\nEverything is working fine, Windows shows the Samba user home directory, logs in fine on machine P, and the NFS mount is also visible, and when I use a linux shell to login on a linux account, I can see the NFS mounted directory, and I am able to write to it (create new files).\nWhat is working:\n  A Samba user can read files on the NFS mount, and can even rename files on it.\nWhat is not working:\n  A Samba user cannot create a new file.\nI synchronized the GUID/UID on both machines as to not fall into the NFS users pitfall, so that cannot be the problem. At this moment I don't have that many users installed, so it's easy to keep track.\nIt might well be that my problem is version related: Machine P runs 12.04 Ubuntu, machine N runs 12.10 (Kubuntu). And I am using PuTTY to get a shell \n\nA: You'll have to browse the internet for more details (as I am just passing by), but the issue is due to file locking--specifically opportunistic locking not playing well with NFS. You can tell Samba that the Linux kernel (or really NFS in this case) doesn't support opportunistic locking by adding the following to the smb.conf file:\nkernel oplocks = no\n\nThere are drawbacks to this approach, but it's the quickest and easiest resolution I know of. \nIt's been a year since you asked the question, so I hope you haven't STILL been waiting for an answer but I hope that this ends up helping someone else!\nCheers,\npolymathcoder\n", "Q: Script to run sets of commands I would like to run fdisk and automatically do a particular command, like p (print)\ninstallation.sh:\nfdisk /dev/sdc1\n\nI don't know how to give the process input to the programm.\n\nA: You Can use  crontab\ncrontab -e\n\ncrontab tool in linux is used to run script automatically.\nyou have to write MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW CMD your_script in crontab shell than you script will run automatically.\nsuppose if min=1 and remaining things are * than your script will run in every 1 min.\nFor more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron\n", "Q: High number of ethernet errors.

For this reason, I want to configure a honey-trap that will allow the laptop to run Prey if a thief boots the laptop.\nTo do this, I want to move the standard GRUB, kernel and inital ramdisk onto a USB stick that I'll keep with me at all times. I'll install a copy of Tiny Core Linux (Or dare I say - Windows) on my laptop which will only boot when I don't plug in my USB stick.\nTo stop a potential thief from wiping the hard drive, I'm going to apply a BIOS password and disable booting from external devices. Obviously this wouldn't stop them removing the HDD and wiping it, but it's a step against a low-level thief.\nIf I do this, I won't be able to boot from my USB - so I'll need a way to chainload GRUB on my USB from GRUB on my hard drive.\nIs this possible - if so, how can I do this/where can I find suitable documentation? Everywhere I've looked suggests using PLoP, LILO or some other software, when I'm sure this should be possible from GRUB alone.\nSimilarly, I could use UEFI Secure Boot to restrict booting onto only my honey trap and \"true\" kernels and initial ramdisks, but my laptop isn't UEFI-compatible :(\nSimilarly this could be an X/Y problem, so if you think I'm going about this the wrong way, feel free to suggest changes.\n\nA: I think that you can try to mount the /boot partition on the usb key, but let the boot loader in the internal drive MBR. I am pretty sure that you can configure something like that with the Ubuntu installer: it is possible to mount nearly any point to any partition, and to choose in wich drive is written the MBR.\nThis way, the Bios would find the MBR on the internal drive, so you can disable external drive boot.\nHere is the link to the complete doc about Grub 2: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html\nMaybe you should have a look at it and check if you can make a Grub script to check if your usb key is available. If it is, it would start your main system entry in Grub Menu as default. If not, it would start the entry with \"Tiny Core Linux\" and \"Prey\".\nAlso, you should go in #grub on the Freenode IRC.\n\nA: GRUB treats USB drives like other hard disks.   I've had success booting kernels/installations on USB sticks from a grub installed to the MBR of an internal drive, by using something like:\n root (hd1,0)\n(To boot off the first partition of the second hard disk.)\nThat does assume consistent arrangement of drives.   It is probably also possible to specify a partition by UUID - as ttoine said, check them man pages.\nYou can test at boot-up, by using c at the GRUB menu to access the GRUB command line (or edit an existing entry).   Then (start up and) set up your config file with USB-boot as default, and presto.\n(Just re-read that - yes, you can have GRUB load a new cfg from the usb stick, rather than a kernel.)\nFWIW, I wouldn't expect much help from the police most places, even if you have the location of your machine.   You might want to keep your /home/ on the USB; if not, at least back it up frequently.\n\nA: Hide the GRUB boot menu with the hiddendelay option, make the default boot option your Prey installation, and password protect the menu.  When you start it, you hit escape during the delay period, enter the password, and boot your regular installation.  Somebody who's stolen it will just boot straight into Prey without even seeing that there are other boot options.\nNow you don't have to worry about losing your USB drive.\nIf you really want to have the extra instructions on a USB drive, don't worry about chainloading.  Instad just put the alternate grub.cfg on your thumbdrive and load it with the configfile directive.  Grub2 has tab completion for paths so finding it should be relatively easy.  Since you have to type in a password to boot anyway, just hitting c for command-line and pointing it at the second config file doesn't add significantly to the difficulty of booting.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Oracle VM VirtualBox running SLOWLY So I am super new, not only to ubuntu, but also to VirtualBox. I have Linux/Unix experience, though I would not call it particularly strong experience. I have recently installed ubuntu using VirtualBox on my windows 8 home machine. I used all of the default download settings. It unfortunately runs supppper slowly. \nWhile trying to figure out my problem, I am reading a lot of similar posts that offer that the problem is a game engine called Unity 2D/Unity 3D, but most of the time, when someone mentions that it is the cause of the problem the person asking the question says \"OF COURSE, good answer.\" Which isn't particularly helpful to me, as a new user. Otherwise I have read that it could be my graphics card, VGA driver, memory allocation or something to do with guest admissions AND Unity. I really have no clue which of these could actually be causing me trouble so I was hoping someone could walk me through common problem solving tasks.\nI installed Ubuntu through VirtualBox. Base memory 512 MB, video memory 12 MB. My computer: Surface Pro 4 GB of installed mem, 64 bit operating.\nNote: Changing base mem to 1000MB did not allow for much faster speeds.\nCan anyone guide me through some steps to solve this matter?  \n\nA: Take a look at the minimal requirements for ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements\nYou are running your VM at the minimum. Try to increase the RAM and Video Memory.\nHow fast is your CPU? (Is it a Tablet-PC?)\nYou can try to use xubuntu instead of ubuntu. It runs faster on hardware with minmal ressources.\n\nA: I'm assuming you're running Ubuntu 12.10 or newer. Try installing 12.04.\nI had the same problem as you, but I had given it 4GB ram on a very fast computer. It was still slower than molasses. 12.04 fixed all the speed issues.\n", "Q: Remove osx partition I triple boot OSx, Windows 8, and Ubuntu on an Imac. I rarely use the OSx and only boot into Windows to play some video games on occasion. my question is what is the process for removing OSx and giving the free space to Ubuntu with out wrecking my boot up? I should also mention that I have rEFit installed on the osx side so I'm not sure how that would work with osx gone..\n\nA: A default rEFIt installation goes in the OS X root (/) partition, so deleting that partition will also delete rEFIt.\nThe safest thing for you to do is nothing. Triple-boot setups like yours on Macs are very delicate, and attempting to mess with them is asking for trouble. If you need the disk space, it's better to add a new disk than to try messing with what you've got. If that's out of the question, though, the safest way to proceed is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Either re-install rEFIt to the EFI System Partition (ESP) or install the newer rEFInd there. Doing this is documented but not supported for rEFIt, and both documented and supported (but not recommended) for rEFInd. (The problem is that some Macs suffer from a ~30-second delay when booting rEFIt or rEFInd from the ESP.)\n\n*Test the above to be sure that rEFIt/rEFInd is working acceptably from the ESP. If you have problems, back out by re-installing rEFIt or rEFInd to the OS X root partition.\n\n*In Linux, use mkfs on the OS X partition. For instance, if it's /dev/sda2 in Linux, you could use sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda2.\n\n*Optionally, us gdisk to change the type code for the partition from AF00 to 8300. Linux doesn't really care about this, but if you subsequently boot OS X (even as an emergency disk), this should keep OS X from doing something nasty to the partition.\n\n\nAt this point, you should be able to use the new space for user files. Most desktop environments will present it as an empty disk device that they'll auto-mount somewhere under /media. Alternatively, you could mount the partition wherever you like by creating an entry in /etc/fstab. If you need to store system files, you'll need to boot into an emergency system, mount your main system somewhere, mount the new partition somewhere convenient, move files, create an /etc/fstab entry, and reboot.\nA still more radical option is to use gdisk to convert the disk from GPT to MBR and begin treating the computer like a conventional BIOS-based machine. This may be cleaner in the long run if you want to use nothing but BIOS-mode OSes, but it's riskier in the short term. You could end up with something that won't boot until you re-install GRUB or make other repairs. You would not use rEFIt or rEFInd in such a configuration, just GRUB. Once the conversion is done, you can do the type of filesystem conversion I've described on it.\n", "Q: Latex, Kile IDE, Ubuntu 12.10 I have been using Latex for a while on Windows but I just converted my Windows machine to Ubuntu only now.  Unfortunately, I have never used Kile before.  I have downloaded texlive 2012 and Kile.  How do I open the Kile IDE with ubuntu?\n\nA: Are you using Unity? My guess is you are (as that's the default one) and it is simple to access your programs. Click on the Ubuntu Button (Home Button or BFB, \"Big Freakin' Button\") and then type in Kile in the search box. It should show up and you can start it. \nNote: \nThis will only work if you have installed Kile (logically).

I will be getting a Mac G4 laptop, will post the exact specs when I get it, and I was wondering if it would be safe to install Ubuntu alongside OSX (probably tiger) and would the hardware (graphics, sound, HDD size) be enough?\n\nA: As Apple is always ahead of the hardware curve I'd bet on it that it will work. I have a Mac that is 6 years old that I run the current version without any issues. \nThe only \"trick\" is to install http://refit.sourceforge.net/ which will allow you to boot from into Ubuntu.\nUbuntu has always been better than the other distroes when it comes to installing and recognizing OSX partitions.\nI recommend you use mac tools to resize the partition to make room.

Hi, I want to open Firefox from the terminal with SOCKS proxy setting enabled.

While reading about speeding up Linux, particularly the boot process I found that concurrency is suggested for multiple core PC's.

This was deemed obsolete as of 12.04 \nSee /etc/init.d/rc and change concurrency to makefile. Remarks and option in that file: \n# Specify method used to enable concurrent init.d scripts.\n# Valid options are `none` and `makefile`. \n# Obsolete options used earlier are `shell` and `startpar`.\n# The obsolete options are aliases for 'makefile' since 2010-05-14.\nCONCURRENCY=makefile\n\nIf you have none set it to makefile. \nBy the way: install bootchart first, create a bootchart, edit rc and make a new bootchart if you want to see if it improves boot time. \n", "Q: How to turn off Libnotify notifications only when sound is in muted state? I have a multimedia keyboard that allows me to easily mute the sound (Ubuntu 12.04). It would be nice to \"link\" this to also turn off libnotify messages that pop-up in the top right corner (i.e. Pidgin messages). \nSo when Ubuntu is muted, no libnotify messages would pop up. When not muted, messages show as normal.\nIs this possible with a script of some kind or would it require changing source code?\n\nA: It would require changing the source code of notify-osd to turn off all notifications (or at least, to filter some; you may want to keep the sound/brightness/etc… notifications active for example, or urgent ones).\nOutside of changing the source code of notify-osd (the daemon which runs in the user session and handles the display of the notifications), there is no way to disable all notifications like this.\n\nA: See my script on github.\nThis answer includes a script to toggle notify-osd notifications on Ubuntu 12.04, and shows how to bind it to a keyboard shortcut.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shortcut to hide libnotify\n\n*How can I customize/disable notification bubbles?\n\nA: I'd try two approaches if I needed this facility.\nOption 1:\nBind the key that does the mute to a script.

I have a somewhat old computer with mid-range hardware.\nHere's what my computer has:\n1.8 Ghz Willamette Pentium 4 256 Kb L2 Cache\nnVidia Geforce 6200 LE 256 mB DDR2\n1024 mB DDR at 133 mhz\n40 GB HD 5400 RPM\nBefore, I used Fedora 17 with my computer, and installation was somewhat long, about 25% (All night installation) longer than Windows XP (Which took 2 hours). It ran at an OK speed, but it was slow and constantly lagged in all areas. This included starting LibreOffice in Fedora 17, loading the Applications screen, scrolling down the Applications screen, and even when switching a wallpaper and it took more than 15 seconds just for Mozilla Firefox to start up, so I eventually switched back to Windows XP in frustration with disappointment at the speed of Fedora 17.\nHowever, I've gotten tired of XP and I want to go back to Linux. I'm looking at the Ubuntu 12.10 & 12.04 requirements which demand 512 mB of RAM and a 1.0 Ghz Pentium 4 processor, but I'm not sure if I should install Ubuntu, or try going with another desktop environment such as Lubuntu, which I've been looking into. With my previous experience with Fedora 17, I'm not sure whether or not my computer will run very smoothly using Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10. As a result, I'm kind of stuck between Lubuntu and Ubuntu...\n\nA: I'd suggest going directly to Lubuntu (but try the Lubuntu live USB before) because of your hardware specs. I currently use Lubuntu 12.10 on an older computer and it runs very smooth.\n\nA: I use my Windows 10 x64 PC which is:\nUbuntu 12.04 on Virtualbox\nDual core processors(Intel Celeron 2.16 GHz\nRAM @ 2GB 1.88 usable\n500GB Hard Disk\nSo when I run Ubuntu, It boots up quickly then It showing Login Screen at 15 sec.\nVery smooth and runs perfectly.\nWhen I open Mozilla Firefox browser, It takes 20 sec. to launch the browser. Just like my Firefox browser in Windows launched at 58 sec.\nMeaning, the firefox browser on Windows, than the linux Mozilla Firefox browser is much great to use.\nMy secret is to getting fast the system is the Swap.

I've written a few scripts to manage LXC containers, and I can get their IP addresses via ifconfig, assuming I'm connected to the console.\nI now want to connect to these containers via ssh. How do I get their IP address in such a way that I can write a script? I also don't want to set the addresses manually (but I'll do it, if that's the only option).\nSo far, I've tried using lxc-start, but the machine doesn't have an IP address before I run /sbin/init.\n\nA: Technically speaking you should be able to use lxc-attach to connect and fire in a command (and process the output), like so:\nsudo lxc-attach --name containername -- ifconfig\n\nThis requires the container to be running.\nNote: I couldn't get this to work. I installed LXC and tried this but just saw a mush of namespace errors, missing files and other nonsense. But my only experience with LXC is the 10 minutes I've spent on this question. It might work. It might not. Good luck!\n\nA: This works on Ubuntu 14.04: \nlxc-info -n $name -i\n\nand if you want only the IP address (useful for scripts), (thanks @JulianHLam):\nlxc-info -n $name -iH\n\n\nA: Or query dnsmasq (which gives IPs to the containers)\ndig @10.0.3.1 $container-name +short\n\n\nA: Python version to do it :\n#!/usr/bin/python\nfrom pylxd import Client\n\nclient = Client(endpoint='https://10.185.96.208:8443', verify=False,    cert=('.config/lxc/client.crt', '.config/lxc/client.key'))\n\nmyCtr = client.containers.get('YOUR_CTR_NAME')\naddresses = myCtr.state().network['eth0']['addresses']\nfor a in addresses:\n   if(a['scope'] == 'global'):\n      print \"Found IP [%s]\" %(a['address'])\n      break\n\n\nA: The easiest way to do this now is:\nlxc-info -n container-name -iH\n\nThis returns the IP address with no other text.\nThe -i option specifies that the IP address should be returned and the -H option disables human readable output i.e. labels. For more info see the lxc-info man page.\nEDIT for newer version of LXC:\nlxc info container-name\nThen you get detailed info. Look at the \"Ips:\" block, which should look like the one below. You might one to grab the first IPv4 address (10.121.48.241) in this case:\nIps:\n  eth0: inet    10.121.48.241   vethSBP4RR\n  eth0: inet6   fda5:b9a9:f3b9:ba32:216:3eff:fe4a:4d7d  vethSBP4RR\n  eth0: inet6   fe80::216:3eff:fe4a:4d7d    vethSBP4RR\n  lo:   inet    127.0.0.1\n  lo:   inet6   ::1\n\n\nA: Seeing as running things in containers doesn't appear to be supported in Ubuntu, my next best suggestion is to look at the IP address leases that dnsmasq is handing out. That's really simple:\n$ cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases\n1363699477 00:16:3e:4a:ce:a4 10.0.3.83 containername *\n\nThere are only two parts there that are of any use, so we can format that up a lot nicer:\n$ awk '{ print $4,$3 }' /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases | column -t\ncontainername  10.0.3.83\n\n\nA: The command below replaces lxc-attach example in previous post\nsudo lxc-execute --name containername --rcfile /usr/share/doc/lxc/examples/lxc-macvlan.conf /sbin/ifconfig\n\nIt runs ifconfig inside the container and shows the output.\nThe --rcfile argument might not be required. Without it the command failed with \n\nlxc-execute: No such file or directory - failed to exec /usr/lib/lxc/lxc-init \n\nlxc-execute: invalid sequence number 1. expected 2\n\nIt sounds like something is not configured properly. As a workaround I've used the predefined configuration template provided by the LXC documentation to make it work without further investigation.\n\nA: If you are running LXD, you may find this command useful for obtaining the IP address of a running container\nlxc exec <container-name> -- ip addr show eth0 | grep \"inet\\b\" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1\n\n\nA: sudo lxc-ls --fancy -F ipv4 $my_container_name | tail -1\n\nA: Let dnsmasq do it for you.\nConfigure your host machine's dnsmasq instance to query lxc's dnsmasq instance for the .lxc top-level domain.\nIn /etc/default/lxc-net, uncomment this line:\nLXC_DOMAIN=\"lxc\"\n\nIf your host's dnsmasq instance is launched by NetworkManager (as is the case with most current Ubuntu desktop installations) create a file called /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/lxc.conf with this line inside:\nserver=/lxc/10.0.3.1\n\nIf your host's dnsmasq is launched by something other than NetworkManager, add that line to /etc/dnsmasq.d-available/lxc instead:\nserver=/lxc/10.0.3.1\n\nThen restart things so they pick up the changes:\nservice lxc-net stop\nservice lxc-net start\nservice network-manager restart\n\nYou might have to restart your lxc containers or make them request new DHCP leases before they appear in DNS. (I don't remember whether it was necessary when I did this.) It's also worth mentioning that I saw a bug report about lxc-net not picking up dnsmasq changes when it was restarted, so you might want to reboot your host system just to be sure.\nThen try it:\n$ host mycontainer.lxc\nmycontainer.lxc has address 10.0.3.21\n\n$ ssh ubuntu@mycontainer.lxc\nWelcome to Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-39-generic x86_64)\nubuntu@mycontainer:~$\n\n\nA: Simple answer is \nsudo lxc-ls -f | grep \"container_name\"\n\nIf you dont remember the container_name just type sudo lxc-ls -f.\n", "Q: apt-get count the number of updates available currently I use this to count the number of available updates\nNUMOFUPDATES=$(aptitude search \"~U\" | wc -l)\n\nIs there a way to do the same with apt(not aptitude) but not using the update-notifier?\n\nA: I suppose the fastest method is shown in apticron:\nhttps://salsa.debian.org/debian/apticron/blob/master/apticron#L121-154\nThis can be distilled to:\napt-get -q -y --ignore-hold --allow-change-held-packages --allow-unauthenticated -s dist-upgrade | /bin/grep  ^Inst | wc -l\n\n\nA: You could use apt-check from update-notifier-common:\n$ /usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check --human-readable\n0 packages can be updated.\n0 updates are security updates.\n\nThis is the same tool that updates the motd message.\n\nA: You can use apt-get -s to simulate an upgrade process and extract only the number of upgraded packages by \nLANG=C apt-get upgrade -s |grep -P '^\\d+ upgraded'|cut -d\" \" -f1\n\nThis will result in just the number of packages\n\nA: I just run the command:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAfter performing the update process, it gives the output for upgrade command as:\nReading package lists...

Quite amazing for a device developed on a linux kernel.\nIs there a way to do it without a virtual box ? \nI don't consider the virtual box option because my system is very light. And this is another question.\n\nA: After a little research, I can give a response :\nUnless you have different infos, and i hope you will, response is NO.\npyTomtom (developed in python) and jTomtom (developed in Java) are 2 projects that are able to updates several model of GPS. \nUnfortunately, they don't support Via 130 (and most of the recent models).\nThis because the device is not recognized as an external drive or storage device, but as a network interface card. Funny confirmation of this : when you plug in your GPS and switch it on, you will have the standard Network Connection message (Network enabled / Network disabled).\nSo it seems that the solution of updating a Via130 Tomtom Model goes through virtualization (with an emulator that support USB) or wine.\n", "Q: Shrink Root partition and allocate free space to Home partition While Installing Ubuntu I did the partition and allocate Disk space like that\n\n\n*\n\n*4 GB for Home\n\n*1 GB for linux-swap\n\n*95 GB for root\n\n\nBut sooner I realilized that my /Home partition is almoast occupied all space in Home folder.\nNow I want to resize my /home partition.\n\nNow I want to shrink my Root partition and allocate the free space to my Home partition.\nHow can I do it ?\n\nA: Making Changes to Installation Partitions\nIf you want to make changes to the partitions on your hard disk, they have to be unmounted first.  This means that you will have to boot into a live environment either off of a CD/DVD or a USB drive, then use GParted or a similar program to alter your partitions.  I'll warn you, though, doing this CAN DAMAGE YOUR INSTALLATION!  Make sure that you check and double check the changes before you apply them.  This is the order that you will likely want to follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup all your data\n\n*Boot into live environment and start GParted\n\n*Shrink the root partition to whatever size\n\n*Expand the home partition to fill in the space.\n\n*Apply changes\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nNote that if you are expanding a partition that has data on it, the process could take quite long because the data has to be copied to the new addresses.\nI can't stress enough that you need to CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK!  I know from experience what kind of problems a simple little error can cause.\nIn Case of Boot Failure\nIf, after you make the changes, your installation no longer boots, boot back into the live environment, and install and run boot-repair\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\nthen run the default recommended repair to fix your GRUB installation.\n", "Q: trouble in updating my xubuntu 12.04.02 When I try tp update my xubuntu in \"Update Manager\" I get this error:\nFailed to download repository information\n\nWhen I try to update through terminal I get this:\nW: Failed to fetch cdrom://Xubuntu 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release i386 (20120423)/dists/precise/main/binary-i386/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nW: Failed to fetch cdrom://Xubuntu 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release i386 (20120423)/dists/precise/multiverse/binary-i386/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nW: Failed to fetch cdrom://Xubuntu 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release i386 (20120423)/dists/precise/restricted/binary-i386/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nW: Failed to fetch cdrom://Xubuntu 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release i386 (20120423)/dists/precise/universe/binary-i386/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nE: Some index files failed to download.

I second @Mordoc's comment above. Backup and remove D:. Do not format, keep in unallocated so that Ubuntu installation process can find it and create its own sets of partitions / and swap.\nIf you want more space for Ubuntu, you can shrink C: and make the unallocated space a bit bigger.\nSecond, The 32GB SSD is used by Windows in such a way that is not compatible with Ubuntu installation. This has been discussed before in another question.

I am in need of expert advice:\nOur system admin who is new to Ubuntu in particular and *nix in general is reluctant to install any updates. His view is what if after installing updates the system becomes unstable and doesn't boot up? He has some horror stories from past life as Windows sys-admin.\nSome in our team believe this is suicidal as not installing (at least) security updates is opening up to malicious attacks.\nIt was suggested to run sudo unattended-upgrade so that at least security updates be installed, however even this sometimes requires system to be restarted.\nI really appreciate expert comments on this? \nThanks.\n\nA: Personally, I think that's a hard position to defend. Machines should periodically have security updates installed. This includes kernel security updates, which require reboots (unless you fancy living life on the edge with Ksplice). \nHe should be paying attention to the security flaws applicable to the platform as they emerge. Recently, notably, we've seen a number of privilege escalation bugs (which allow normal users to become root). There are in-the-wild exploits for at least one of these (albeit, I don't think it affects 12.04). There are a steady stream of bugs getting patched for lesser applications which fix remote code execution, DOS, priv escalation flaws, etc. There are plenty of attack vectors getting patched regularly.\nThat said; the final decision of whether or not to patch depends entirely on the context. If you're talking about an Internet-facing webserver, or end-user boxes, then your sysadmin is insane. If you're talking about a high-availability internal production system behind layers of network security in a trusted environment, then that's a little different, and your sysadmin may be being quite pragmatic. \nI.e, if the main threat to the box is from its own employees, then is patching a few DOS holes really worth the downtime and risk to production stability? Probably not, no. \nOf course, threats can get inside the network perimeter. But again, it depends on your network, your company, your setup... in many small companies, that may already be pretty much game over. The attacker may already have all the access he needs to access these boxes via passwords or keys stored elsewhere on the network, or via impersonation, sniffing, etc. In other words, patching a few holes on a couple of systems might be like starting to build a fence after the horses have bolted.\nBottom line: machines should really see security updates. It doesn't have to be a total unknown; test systems can be (and should be) brought up and upgraded in the same manner as a test-run prior to the event. \nBut don't ever forget that security is a balancing act. The totally secure system is one buried miles underground, with no connectivity, no power, and no data. If all you're protecting yourself from are a few trusted employees, then what's the point?\n\nA: I have never faced a problem with ubuntu 12.04 updates becoming unstable, if not updated every thing would run normal but the bugs will never be fixed.  Linux is quite secure but like you said needs security updates.  There haven't been any attacks on linux but you should be safe any ways by installing an anti-virus software again I have never seen an update that's makes LTS unstable you can also chose what updates to install in the update manager.\nI hope this helps\n", "Q: Did I install Python 3.3 in the right folder? I downloaded and installed it (thanks mostly to these guys in the how-to section: How do I install Python 3.3?) and the learning guide that I am using explains that placing the installation in the downloads folder might not be the best idea for windows users. Is this the case for me using ubuntu? If so, can I simply copy and paste it elsewhere? Where might be a good place?\nThanks!\n\nA: If you're on 12.10, you can (and should, unless you have any special requirements) simply install Python 3.3 from the repositories. This way it will be updated as part of the rest of your installation, and it will be easier to install supporting libraries.\nsudo apt-get install python3.3\n\nIf you do want to compile and install it yourself, you would usually put the resulting binary in either /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin. For things I compile myself, I normally choose the latter.\nNow, source like python comes with its own directory structure: bin, include, lib, src, etc. You can see this under the Python-3.3.0 directory. \nIf you poke around your /usr filesystem, you'll see a similar structure - /usr/bin, /usr/src, /usr/include, /usr/lib, etc. Software which is installed from the repositories is slotted into this /usr file structure, with the relevant files being placed in the appropriate places. \nIf you're compiling Python from source, you'll have a Python directory with all these different kinds of files contained within it. If you try to divide it up yourself into the structure under /usr, you're going to end up in a real mess, and it'll be devilishly hard to remove it all afterwards.\nSo the way this is usually done is to place the whole directory under /opt. You can compile it there, and then you can either copy the resultant binaries into /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, or you can make symlinks to them.\nThe instructions you're following show you how to compile python under /opt and create a symlink to the primary python binary in /usr/bin. This is a perfectly acceptable convention to follow.\nI should also add: I'm talking about conventions here. Conventions don't always need to be followed rigidly. But for first steps, these conventions are a good way to start. You can (and will, no doubt) develop your own \"style\" as you progress.\nTo learn more about the filesystem structure (this really does come in handy), have a quick look at Ubuntu's nice and succinct Filesystem Tree Overview. \n", "Q: Black screen on boot nvidia optimus card Whenever I boot my screen comes up with a black screen with the same text as if I hit Control Alt F1.\nMy graphics card is an Nvidia Optimus card using Bumblebee.

I let Ubuntu create the partitions as it saw fit on my single disk system and I ended up with sda1 as I expected and sda5 as swap, but I also got a single block sda2 in between the swap and root.  Does anybody know why this would have been created? The desktop is old and not efi.  Also bonus points for explaining why the swap partition is on sda5 and not just sequential as I would have expected.\n\nA: The numbers sda1-4 are reserved for \"primary\" partitions, of which there can be only four. Numbers sda5+ are for logical partitions which reside in an extended partition.\nExtended partition is basically a partition holder, which can hold multiple logical partitions. This limitation of 4 partitions is from the old ages when DOS was used - extended/logical partitions are a workaround to allow more partitions in modern systems (however, GPT/EFI partitions are better and allow way more partitions on a single device).\nIn your case, I would expect this sda2 to be the extended partition which holds the logical partitions, sda5 (swap) in this case. You should be able to confirm this via a graphical partitioning tool such as GParted.\nEdit: You can find more information about this here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning (Check below headings \"Primary partition\" and \"Extended partition\".)\n", "Q: Intermittent Internet connection using wireless LAN, Acer Aspire S3, Ubuntu 12.10 I have an Acer Aspire S3 running Linux Mint 14 / Ubuntu 12.10.

It provides you with the possibility to use different wine versions for different programs and easily uninstall software as each program has it's own environment which can be deleted as a whole so you don't have to uninstall any software.\n", "Q: Unable to install latest version of Codeblocks I am presently using Kubuntu, and now I want to install Codeblocks latest version.\nI tried using \n$ sudo apt-get install codeblocks\n\nbut, it gives me Codeblocks 10.05.\nI don't know where is the problem.

For example, /path1 and /path2 are auto mounted, but I want to disable automount for /path1, because I want to use a local folder instead, so I added this to /etc/auto.master:\n/path1 -null\nBut it doesn't seem to have any effect. So what is the proper way of overriding/disabling such specific mounts on client side for a automount map loaded via LDAP?\nI don't have control over the LDAP server, and it automounts 10 or so paths out of which I want one disabled.\nEdit:\nWhen I run mount command I see something like this\nhome.xxx.com:/home1 on /mnt/home1 type nfs \ngit.xxx.com:/git on /mnt/git type nfs \n\nI thought /mnt/home1 and /mnt/git are loaded separately from ldap, but automount -m shows only one entry\nMount point: /mnt\n\nsource(s):\n\n  type: ldap\n  map: ldap:ou=auto.mnt,ou=automount,dc=xxx,dc=com\n\nThat said wouldn't /mnt/git -null' in/etc/auto.master` work, or I will have to make whole /mnt null?\n\nA: Have you configured the key MASTER_MAP_NAME in /etc/default/autofs to point out your ldap directory master map ? \nIf so this will override and not use your local auto.master map, see auto.master man page.\nYou can also verify which maps are in use with automount -m.\n\nA: One way to prevent an LDAP map from being automounted is to move /path1 and replace it with a symbolic link.  e.g.\n# mv /path1 /localpath1\n# ln -s /localpath1 /path1\n\nThere may be side effects to doing this (like more messages in the log, if enabled), but it will enable you to access your local folder of the same name while using LDAP automounts (i.e. MASTER_MAP_NAME = \"ou=...\" as noted by ThinLinc).  I have successfully tested this on Ubuntu 12.04 with libnss-ldapd, but I don't see why it wouldn't work with sssd.\nIf you choose to do this, then /path1 will become a logical path and /localpath1 will be the physical path.  The default will be the logical path; hence, from the user's perspective, /path1 is still the local /path1, but sudo will default to the physical path.  There are -L and -P options to pwd and cd which may assist you in displaying or changing between the logical and physical paths in cases where the logical path creates problems.\n", "Q: Unable to bind to port 80 [bitnami, OSQA, Ubuntu 12.04] For some reason I can't open port 80, so my install is using 8080.  \nhow can I find the exact service using port 80 and terminate it or uninstall it?\n\nA: To find out what processes are using which ports, you can use the '-p' option to netstat (this must be done as root).  the command I always use is:\nsudo netstat -alutp\n\nThis shows all open, listening, udp, tcp sockets, and what process has them open.\n\nA: you downloaded the stack instead of the module. go to https://bitnami.com/stack/xampp?utm_campaign=XAMPP%2BModule&utm_medium=installer&utm_source=bitnami to get the module that works with xampp\n", "Q: Log in fails after installing additional drivers So I updated my graphic drivers using the additional drivers option and restarted my computer upon completion. \nNow when I try to log in everything looks fine, I put in my password and hit enter, what comes up next is the screen with one(1) distorted icon on the desktop, and the background, nothing more.\nHow can I revert back to the default graphic drivers so I can boot into Ubuntu again?\nLet me know if you need anymore details.\n\nA: Try starting a previous version of Ubuntu and see if that fixes it.\nIf this fixes it, run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade. Once this is complete open up Update manager and uncheck ALL of any updates having to do with graphics, then select one (1 - only one) again and write down the graphic update you selected. \nInstall these updates and restart, if you get the same problem, you probably have found the problem.

From the command line, I can chmod, rmdir among other things using sudo without any issues.\n\nA: How to allow creating symlinks on windows this page helped me a lot which explains that this happens even if your shared folder is writable.\nTo fix it, you need to enable symlinks feature in VirtualBox.\nRun at cmd prompt:\nVBoxManage setextradata YOURVMNAME VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/YOURSHAREFOLDERNAME 1\n\nThen verify by:\nVBoxManage getextradata YOURVMNAME enumerate\n\n\nIf your user belongs to Administrators group then start VirtualBox with \"Run as Administrator\"!\nBy default Windows 7 security policy does not allow creating symlinks as it's a potential security threat. Run \"secpol.msc\" and navigate to \"Local Policies-User Rights Assignments\" and add your user to \"Create symbolic links\". I didn't try that but could be that after that virtualbox could be run as a regular user.\n\n\nA: Agree with lorem, but it's not enough.\n\n\n*\n\n*run Virtualbox 'as an admininstrator' on Windows.\n\n*make sure you executed: VBoxManage.exe setextradata YOUR_VM  BoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/YOUR_SHARED_FOLDER 1\nReplace the YOUR_VM and YOUR_SHARED_FOLDER with your values.\nYou can check the value via: VBoxManage.exe getextradata boot2docker-vm enumerate\nThere is a virtualbox bug tracking this issue.\n\nA: Running with --no-bin-links fixed it for me:\nnpm install --no-bin-links\n\n--no-bin-links tells npm to not create any symbolic links.\nOccasionally, for some packages that create symlinks even with the --no-bin-links directive, or in the case where using this directive causes other errors, you can remove the symlinks from the package(s) that is showing error with the command:\nnpm unlink <package>\n\nThere is definitely no way to translate symlinks to a Windows share.\n\nA: The newer versions of VirtualBox should allow symlinks if you start VirtualBox as Adminstrator (right click: Run as administrator).\nSame applies to vagrant boxes: just run your cmd.exe/PowerShell as admin and you are good to go.\n\nA: in this npm issue @drmyersii give a great solution, I'll only copy and paste to don't link the answer only.\n\nThe real solution here would be to set your configuration to allow\n  symlinks on Windows hosts in your Vagrantfile. Here's an example\n  (assuming that you are running it in VirtualBox):\n\nconfig.vm.provider \"virtualbox\" do |v|\n    v.customize [\"setextradata\", :id, \"VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/vagrant\", \"1\"]\nend\n\nthis worked great for me and now I can use gulp with scotchbox.\n\nA: For me none of these answers worked. I'm not sure why but I believe it's because my share is nfs. So I couldn't get it to allow symlinks even when running as Administrator and changing the setextradata settings. I was working with gulp and some other packages that seem to have issues obeying --no-bin-links. It was STILL trying to create some symbolic links and obviously failing. Finally this thread on Github clued me into a \"solution\", hacky as it may be.

It has established connections like\ndropbox   2409          myuser   17u  IPv4 220578      0t0  TCP     127.0.0.1:37255->127.0.0.1:8080 (CLOSE_WAIT)\ndropbox   2409          myuser   23u  IPv4 221364      0t0  TCP     127.0.0.1:37273->127.0.0.1:80y80 (CLOSE_WAIT)\ndropbox   2409          muser   26u  IPv4 221496      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:37279->127.0.0.1:8080 (ESTABLISHED)\ndropbox   2409          myuser   27u  IPv4 216008      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:37261->127.0.0.1:8080 (CLOSE_WAIT)\n\n(I should perhaps mention that I have privoxy and dansguardian installed too, so only privoxy is allowed http, https outbound to port 80, and only dansguardian is allowed local outbound to privoxy which listens on 8118, and firefox is then forced to connect to dansguardian on 127.0.0.1:8080. This means Dropbox connects through a \"proxy\" of 127.0.0.1:8080 too, just like firefox does. Not sure this has any relevance but just incase. Pretty much all other standard outbound is allowed. )\nMy iptables rules for reference are set to drop and log all inbound connections unless tracked by\niptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A OUTPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n\nAs I say the strange thing is that Dropbox appears to otherwise work fine, so whatever it wants with this inbound connection must be pretty minor, but it is annoying to continually see it in the logs.\n\nA: The reason you're seeing this is because only root can open ports below 1024 so any application that wants an outgoing connection will open a port higher than that.\nYou can open ports between 1025 and 65335 inclusively as a non-root user.\n", "Q: How do I make my BIOS boot on shimx64.efi file?

I recently got a quad-core smartphone, and I am wanting to squeeze out every bit of performance and productivity out of it. I have been looking around and can't seem to find a straight answer on some questions I have.\nFirst off, is Ubuntu for Phones actually a full fledged distribution or is is stripped down to be more of a phone-like OS? Would I be able to download programs that are available for linux? Be able to run .deb packages? Open a Terminal?\nAnd lastly, is there a way to install the latest distro of Ubuntu onto my mobile device? In replacement of Android (for experimental purposes)? The only answers I can find is to VNC into it on your phone, but it is still too slow and laggy. I understand one would have to pull the drivers from one owns device but surely this is possible?\nThank you for your time in reading this and I am very interested in hearing your thoughts or information leading me to my answers!\n\nA: It's too early to provide a fully satisfying answer as Ubuntu Touch has only started as a Developer Preview yet. \nThe idea is that the final Ubuntu Touch will allow you to connect the device (should be a powerful one) via docking station to monitor and keyboard/mouse and can be used as a normal workstation. \nThere are already devices which are powerful enough and Ubuntu with all components is already fully available for arm machines.\nIt will be exciting to find out if it's powerful enough but we will have to wait for at least half a year.\nThe only thing you can see right now is the new mobile version of unity and you can connect to your Ubuntu Touch via adb or ssh and you can run all possible command line programs.\n", "Q: mv: Directory not empty I want to move content of a directory within another directory with the same folders.\nHere's an example:\nI have ./backup which has the directories base and test. Now, I want to move these directories to ./backupArchives.\nI use this:\nmv ./backup/* ./backupArchives\n\nbut I got the error\nmv: cannot move './backup/base' to './backupsArchive/base': Directory not empty\n\nI tried using --force, but no luck. Is there a way to move it when folders already exists?\nNote: I just want to merge contents, there's no overwriting.\n\nA: Quick and dirty, if you know what you are doing:  \ncp -r ./backup/* ./backupArchives && rm -R ./backup/*\n\n\nA: Sure rsync does work, but this might work as well for machine that does not support rsync (i.e in cpanel, which rsync is not installed by default).\nWhat about using:\ncd /path/to/backup/ && cp -R --parents ./* ../backupArchives\n\nThen remove the backup directory if necessary\nNote1: You need to cd to the backup directory before executing the cp -R --parents ... \nNote2: Double check the backupArchives directory if you got the new files from backup.\n\nA: Though its man page doesn't document it, mv will refuse to rename a directory to another directory if the target directory contains files. This is a good thing in your case because you turn out to want to merge the content of the source into the target, which mv will not do.\nUse rsync -a backup/ backupArchives/ instead. After that rm -rf backup/*.\nInstead of using rsync, you also can do the classical\n(cd backup && tar c .) | (cd backupArchives && tar xf -)\n\nwhich earns you more geek points.\n\nA: I had to copy a very large directory with a lot of large files, so I created hardlinks to the original files in the target directory like this:\ncp -al ./backup/* ./backupArchives\n\nThen I deleted the originals, leaving only one hardlink to each file.\nSince hardlinks are quite space efficient, you could even use hardlinks to copy the backupArchives and backup directories to a new trial location, and check that the file counts are as you expect, as a dummy run. This assumes that your filesystem supports hardlinks - ext4 does.\n\nA: After the directory you moving you need * (represents any text or number). For example:\nmv /var/www/* /recovery/wwwrecovery/\n\nthats all, if you moving files, than you move as:\nmv /var/www/index.php /recovery/index.php\nAnother way is to pack that folder content by using tar:\ntar -cvzpf backup.tar.gz /var/www \n\nThen move it lie any other file. Also I recommend this step because tar compresses it and make it smaller in size.\nTo extract the files to another folder use\ntar -xvzpf /var/www/\n\nIf you need to copy to a location you don't own, make sure to prepend your command with the sudo command after whichever option you decide to use.\nsudo tar -cvzpf backup.tar.gz /var/www/\n\n\nA: Before asking the question, let's consider a simplified case. \nSuppose in /home/admin we have two folders foo and bar which have the same subdirectory structure, but each contains different files in it. Now we want to merge them into one. When we do things like mv foo/* bar, the error mv: directory not empty occurs.\nMy solution is to give up command line tools and switch to a GUI file manager, for example, dolphin. When you rename foo to bar in dolphin, it gives you the option to write into the destination folder, and asks you whether to overwrite existing files, interactively. This avoids copy and delete, which in effect saves your time without a single line of code.\nPS: I didn't test every file manager out there. But most of them should have this feature.\n\nA: When moving directory during a script execution, you need to consider non-existing or empty directories, and also force override and removal without confirmation:\n# If old directory exists, and isn't empty\nif [[ -d old_dir ]] && [[ -n `ls -A old_dir` ]] ; then\n\n  # Make a new directory (skip if already exists)\n  mkdir -p new_dir\n\n  # Copy all files to the new directory (-afr : Keep attributes, Force overwrite, Recursive copy)\n  cp -afr old_dir/* new_dir/\n\n  # Remove old directory\n  rm -rf old_dir\nfi\n\n", "Q: unable to connect mobile broadband ubuntu 12.10 i recently installed ubuntu 12.10 on my desktop. now the mobile connection was not working, which i later found out to be a bug in modem manger so i downgraded it to v0.5.2 but still the problem persists. whenever i try connecting, the mobile broadband option gets automatically disabled.\ni have a bsnl EVDO connection, which i had to manually configure as the device was not automatically detected at first.\n\nA: first be sure to have all info about your contract with provider, than click on network button on top of the screen, and select : edit connections.\nwhen that window is opened select: mobile broadband.\nnext click on add.\nthen select your device or select any if not on list.\nselect your country, provider and contract type in next steps, than just create. also check on that network menu (after clicking on network button on top of screen) that:\nfirst- networking is enabled (checked)\nalso- mobilebroadband is enabled (checked)\nafter creating, unplug and plug device back in, after few seconds, click network button, and click on that created network when you see it on the list. if not work this, leave me comment i will see what could be.\n", "Q: Software center installation stuck after script cancellation Attempted to add the Matlab installation and it asked me where my current installation was -- never have tried to install it before -- I hit cancel when it asked for the installation directory and now Ububtu Software Center bogs down the machine and everything in line to download and install behind it in the queue is hosed.\n   No places to hit pause or cancel for any of the line items.

No hardware required. Just physical access is enough. \n\nIs there any way I can setup my Ubuntu PCs authentication (login) username / password system via some cloud / online account.\n\nNo, and it would be rather pointless since it would create a false sense of security. \n\nReason for this is, in case I lose access to my PC I can change my credentials online and therefore disabling access to PC and my data on my HDD.\n\nYou are wrong there. If someone has physcial access to your machine they will be able to access your data if it is not encrypted: all they need is a live cd or to enter grub rescue. Both will grant them root access. There is not even any form of password hacking required since these 2 are the general methods for resetting your admin password in case you forgot them.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nIf you are that worried about your system please use (full disc or /home partition) encryption. This will make all data unreadable and only accesible when you log in with a password. Use a strong password and others will have a hard time getting to your data. Still not impossible (but it would take a long time to decrypt it). \nAnd even full disc encryption is flawed: if someone really really wants your data nothing stops them from asking you to provide your password. 1 knife, 10 fingers.

Links?\n\nA: First, my apologies for not giving you a concrete answer. I know how frustrating it can be when you ask what is a plainly obvious question, and get no response. I just posted a similar question about an hour ago:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/284817/100-no-non-sense-native-c-c-development-or-not\nI strongly suspect that you will not have the native development that you see. You are already familiar with Android's claim to support native C++ development. They even named their kit \"NDK\". But I don't need to tell you that every person has their own interpretation of native development.\nThat said, I have a gut feeling that Ubuntu is following the same path. The give you you the ability to compile C++ code into machine code, but they sandbox your application so that you do not get true native development, as in native access to the machine. Then they start giving you libraries, in a controlled mannner, piecemeal, which might turn out to be extremely frustrated.\nI wish someone at Ubuntu would clear this up. And please, do not be shy. We are experienced engineers who know what compiles and translation-look-a-side buffers are. Don't beat around the bush, please. Just tell us the truth. Do we get access to the entire native API surface exposed by Linux or not?\n", "Q: How to generate a MOV-file from PNG images? I have 400 PNG images, from which I want to generate a Quicktime movie (.mov). The filenames have the style:\nimg1.png\nimg2.png\n...\nimg10.png\nimp11.png\n...\nimg100.png\nimg101.png\n...\n\nI used to do that on a Mac using ImageJ but unfortunately this requires a 32 bit version of Java. I also tried it using ImageJ on Ubuntu, but the option to create a Quicktime movie does not exist there.\n\nA: I'd do it with avconv (or ffmpeg),  but you have to do it on the command line.\nInstall required program\nOpen the terminal application and install the required programs:\nsudo apt-get install libav-tools libavcodec-extra-53 libavdevice-extra-53 libavformat-extra-53 libavutil-extra-51 libpostproc-extra-52 libswscale-extra-2\n\nGo to the directory containing the image sequence:\ncd /path/to/images/\n\nConvert:\navconv -i \"img%d.png\" -r 25 -c:v libx264 -crf 20  -pix_fmt yuv420p img.mov\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-i \"img%d.png\" uses these files as the input, %d is a placeholder for the number\n\n*-r 25 the desired frame rate, 25 FPS in this case\n\n*-c:v libx264 use the h264 codec x264\n\n*-crf 20 the video quality, 20 is pretty high, the default is 23\n\n*-pix_fmt yuv420p a compatible pixel format \n\n\nNote that in contrast to e.g. VLC, older quicktime players are pretty picky about what they play. Be sure to test it in quick time, you may have to adapt the codec options / output format (For example, you could replace img.mov with img.mkv to get a Matroska video)\navconv doc\n\nA: I'd highly recommend Imagemagick for this. After installing it, an example of a command for what you're trying to do would be:\nconvert -delay 5 img[1-9].png img[1-9][0-9].png img[1-9][0-9][0-9].png output.mov\n\nNote that the command would be simpler (and the images would still show up in numerical order) if you had leading zeros in your image filenames. Then you could use:\nconvert -delay 5 img*.png output.mov\n\n\nA: You could use the Fiji distribution of ImageJ on ubuntu and enable the FFMPEG repository, which gives you the option to export (File > Save as) as MPEG movie. Although this depends wether an MPEG is ok for you or you have to go for QuickTime.\nFor help in enabling the FFMPEG repository, see the corresponding page in Fiji's excellent wiki.\n", "Q: long wait time on Login I have to wait a long time (about 15s) after entering login credentials.

I want to permanently prevent Ubuntu 12.10 from creating a \"recently used\" file list. This list seems to be stored in the file:\n/home/user/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\nI have tried deleting this file, but it keeps being recreated every time I start a new login session. I need to know how to prevent this file from being recreated.\n\nA: I've found that fiddling with the recently-used.xbel file has no effect (at least on Ubuntu 17.04+). You can delete it, clear it, /dev/null it, set it immutable, shoot it in any way and it won't work. For example Nautilus has a \"Recently used\" section hardwired into the side panel - and it's not deletable by any means and survives the .xbel file being wiped.\nOn GNOME / Ubuntu do this (which worked for me):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and start gnome\n\n\n\n$ gnome-control-center\n\n\n\n\n*Navigate to the \"Privacy Group\" and click on \"Privacy\" \n\n*Click on \"Usage & History\" and on the following dialog set the \"Recently Used\" toggle to OFF.\nRight when you do this, you can see the \"Recently used\" list in Nautilus going empty. (This also wipes the .xbel file - check it out.) Done.\n\nA: As before, whatever you do, it's always there. But you can make it immutable so it stops logging and stays empty. Command: sudo chattr +i ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel .The system, and you as well, will not be able to do anything with it, until you change +i(immutable). This is the reverse command to restart logging back again: sudo chattr -i ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel .(only if you want recently-used functioning again for some reason). I've had success clearing logs out by moving the folder to /dev/shm and shutdown computer. The folder comes back, empty.\n\nA: Why not just disable recently-used files through gsettings?\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.privacy remember-recent-files false\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.privacy remember-app-usage false\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.privacy recent-files-max-age 0\n\nThis should work; If not please reply and point out any errors!\n\nA: To disable the list for GTK 3 based applications follow these steps:\nrm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\nIf THERE ISN'T a \"~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\", then\nmkdir -p ~/.config/gtk-3.0\n    echo -e \"[Settings]\\ngtk-recent-files-max-age=0\\ngtk-recent-files-limit=0\" > ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n\nIf THERE IS a  \"~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\", then\necho -e \"\\ngtk-recent-files-max-age=0\\ngtk-recent-files-limit=0\" >> ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n\n(note the \">>\" vs the \">\" difference ; \">>\" appends to a file while a single \">\" completely overwrites it, without backup, if it already exists)\nAnd in either case:\nrm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\nTo disable the list for GTK 2 based applications follow this step:\necho gtk-recent-files-max-age=0 >> ~/.gtkrc-2.0\n\nThese steps are better than changing permissions on the file as they prevent error messages from being shown when launching GTK based applications that rely on the file.\nDetailed information can be found here - https://alexcabal.com/disabling-gnomes-recently-used-file-list-the-better-way/\n\nA: So far this file gets recreated even if you chown it to root or make it immutable. Even if you set the max-age settings to 0, it still remembers directories.\nI have implemented a workaround that clears this file every 5 minutes. It's a very nasty workaround: create a cron entry that clears the file frequently:\ncrontab -e\n# clear gtk recently used list every 5 minutes\n*/5 *   *   *   *   echo \"\" > .local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\nCertain applications still default to the recently used list, but this satisfies your question to permanently prevent Ubuntu 12.10 from creating a \"recently used\" file list.\n\nA: Assuming it's only that file that you want to prevent from being written, you could try changing its permissions so it cannot be accessed.\nFirst, delete the file. Then, create a new, blank one. Then, customize its permissions.\ncd ~/.local/share\nrm recently-used.xbel\ntouch recently-used.xbel\nchmod 000 recently-used.xbel\n\nIf you want, you can even change its ownership so no program running as your user can change its permissions and write to it:\nsudo chown root:root recently-used.xbel\n\nSome programs might issue errors (with or without that final customization).\n", "Q: can't connect to wireless network on hp mini after installing ubuntu 12.10 i got a used hp mini yesterdayand installed ubuntu 12.10 today. like others, i cannot connect to a wireless network. \"enable networking\" is checked but no connection options appear. ethernet works. network settings only gives the options \"wired\" and \"network proxy\". \ni tried the command \"sudo lshs -c network\" but get \"command not found\".\nin addition, suddenly my arrow keys aren't working (pretty sure they were working yday though). so when i reboot, i can't choose ubuntu since i can't go down...

As such when I run /etc/int.d/networking restart I receive an error message.:\n\nFailed ... eth0\n\nI have been trying for a couple of days.

Routers usually use IPs of the following type 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x, depending on the router. These are private IPs, and they are always different from the ones assigned by ISPs. The result of putting such an IP into the config file is - you get no internal IP, as the router can't provide the one you ask for. There are numerous examples of the interfaces config file on the net. Here is one from the LinuxJournal you might find useful:\nauto eth0  \niface eth0 inet static   \naddress 192.168.1.200   \nnetmask 255.255.255.0   \ngateway 192.168.1.1   \ndns-nameservers 192.168.1.1\n\nThe title seems irrelevant to the body of the question, but if you need a static public IP, either contact your ISP, or use services like NOIP or DYNDNS.\n\nA: If your ISP gave you a static IP, the info for the static IP should be entered where the ISP cable is plugged. You say you take info from router so you have a router and the ISP cable is plugged in this router. The static IP must be configured on the router, not on your server. Your server should revceive local IP from your router (NAT) and you have to use port forwarding on the router to access the server from internet.\nIf you want the static IP on the server and not the router, you have to plug the ISP cable on the server.\n\nA: If your router has the ip 192.168.1.1 the configuration would be:\naddress 192.168.1.4 (for example)\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.1.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-servers (provider by isp)\n", "Q: How to configure auto lock screen?

Well, my problem is that I was trying to make a Windows XP installer for a USB Flash Drive using WinToFlash.

Deleted the partitioned and then tried to recover it with gparted. It worked.\nNow, that was the only test I did with gparted. I have used recovery tools like testdisk (And photorec), foremost and scalpel. With testdisk I can actually say that even after formatting a partition 3 times, installing stuff on top of it and well, doing a lot of stuff on it, I could still recover a very old partition, almost entirely. I even tested a Windows XP partition that after recovering, booted up and everything was working. Windows did not know the difference.\nSo from experience and much trust put into testdisk, I would first go with this one. I know is not GUI like, but it has a very intuitive terminal menu that tells you step by step what to do or what it has found.\n", "Q: After LibreOffice updated it won't start!

This is an ordinary firewall--you can use it to filter packets based on their headers.\nAn IP address and port are included in a packet's headers, but what web document is being retrieved is not. Instead, this information is transmitted in the bodies of packets, after a connection is already established.\nAs you're probably aware, it is possible to block access to certain websites (though it's usually pretty easy for someone to circumvent the block), and there are utilities that provide the granularity to block specific pages while allowing access to other pages on the same server. But to address what you've asked: ufw will not do this.\n\nA: You can block access to a port on a server with ufw. man ufw has a whole raft of examples but assuming it's enabled, it should be like this:\nsudo ufw deny out to <<ip address>> port 80\n\nI've just tested this against my own server and it works. Remember that port 443 is used for SSL so that might want blocking too.\nRemember, this blocks the whole of port 80 on this server.\n\nIf you want to start filtering based on subfolders (allowing some paths but not others) you're going to need something that proxies the requests. A firewall doesn't look at the content, it looks at the connections. To a firewall, a request for /subfolder is the same as a request to /a-different-subfolder.\nSo what you're looking for is a transparent proxy that you can twist into nixing some of your traffic. Parental-control software is probably your best bet for a quick setup. Something like dansguardian certainly used to be popular and I would say it warrants exploration.

Like a microphone jack, a line in jack is for capturing audio--you would plug a device in that sends a sound signal to your computer, not the other way around.\nIf you've done something like this with your computer before (in Windows, you said), then either:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's not really your line in jack, or\n\n*your line in jack doubles as an output jack for some of the speakers in your surround sound system. (Then it still cannot send output to speakers when used as a line in, but it has other uses also.)\n\n\nIf it worked in Windows, it should work in Ubuntu, but you would have to provide much more information about your computer for us to know. In particular, we'd need to know exactly what motherboard you have and what sound chipset it uses. A detailed description of all the audio jacks (including their colors and and symbols) would be especially helpful, and a picture might be a good idea.\n\nA: In the sound setting, go to \"Hardware\".\nIn it, click \"Profile\", and try one of \"5.1\" settings.\nThe default is usually \"Analog Stereo Duplex\". \nI don't gurantee that any of 5.1 Analog works with your hardware, but surely \"Analog Stereo Duplex\" would never work to output the surround sound out from the line in ports.\n", "Q: Why should users never use normal sudo to start graphical applications?

This means the directory for any configuration files touched will be under /root directory and not /home/regular_userID directory (aka $HOME).\nThis makes this whole Q&A a moot point to a large degree for Ubuntu 19.10 users and greater.\nTo see whether sudo is working like sudo -H in your distribution try these short tests:\n$ sudo printenv | grep HOME\nHOME=/home/rick\n\n$ sudo -H printenv | grep HOME\nHOME=/root\n\nAs you can see, sudo above does not perform like sudo -H so using plain sudo can harm your user configuration files.\n\nAn alternative to gksu nautilus, gksu gedit or sudo -H gedit is to use the nautilus-admin add-on. It allows you to browse files and directories with Nautilus and then open them as root (Administrator).\nInstallation is straight forward:\nsudo apt install nautilus-admin\n\nNow when you are in Nautilus you'll have an extra option to Edit as administrator:\n\n\ngedit as root doesn't allow preferences\nWhen you run gedit as root you can't use the preferences you've set up as a regular user for tab stops, convert tabs to spaces, font name, font size, line wrap, etc.\nTo solve this I've written the script sgedit to inherit user preferences and apply them to root: How can I sync my root gedit with my user gedit's preferences?\n\n*\n\n*Call using sgedit filename1 filename2 ...\n\n*Gets user's gedit settings for tab stops, fonts, line-wrap, etc.\n\n*Elevates to sudo -H to preserve file ownership whilst getting root powers.\n\n*Requests password if last sudo has timed out.\n\n*Gets sudo's gedit settings\n\n*Compares differences between user and sudo gedit settings\n\n*Runs gsettings set on the differences only (reduces 174 set commands to a dozen or less.

See WinEunuuchs2Unix's answer as well as this question.\n\nGraphical applications often store settings and other user-specific data in configuration files written inside the user's home folder. The main mechanism applications use to determine what they should use as the user's home folder is the HOME environment variable. (You can inspect it yourself with echo $HOME).\nSuppose you're running gedit (a graphical text editor) as root. If you run sudo gedit, HOME will continue to point toward your home directory, even though the program is running as root. Consequently, gedit will write configuration files as root into your home directory. This will sometimes result in the configuration files being owned by root and thus inaccessible to you (when you later run the program as yourself and not as root). This mainly happens when the application has to create a new configuration file. Newly created files, by default, are owned by the user who creates them (who in this case is root, not you).\nThat's the primary reason why you should run graphical applications with a graphical sudo frontend rather than with straight sudo. In Ubuntu and most of its derivatives (including Xubuntu and Lubuntu), the standard graphical frontend is gksu/gksudo. In Kubuntu it is kdesudo. (It depends on the desktop environment being used.)\nIf you want to use sudo directly to run a graphical application like gedit, you can run:\nsudo -H gedit\n\nThe -H flag makes sudo set HOME to point to root's home folder (which is /root).\nThat still won't automatically handle the ownership of .Xauthority by copying it to a temp folder (this is the other thing that graphical sudo frontends take care of for you). But in the infrequent event that .Xauthority is inaccessible, you'll get an error saying it is, and then you can fix the problem by deleting it (sudo rm ~/.Xauthority), as it's automatically regenerated. Thus, protecting .Xauthority's ownership and permissions is less important than protecting the ownership and permissions of configuration files.\nIn contrast to a root-owned .Xauthority, when configuration files become owned as root, it's not always as obvious what the problem is (because graphical programs will often run, but not work very well, and output any useful errors to the console). And it's sometimes a bigger hassle to fix, especially if you're in a situation where you want one or more files in your home directory to be owned by someone other than you (because then you cannot fix it simply by recursively chowning all your files back to yourself).\nTherefore, sudo (at least without -H) should not be used to run a graphical application unless you are highly familiar with the app's inner workings and know for sure that it does not ever attempt to write any configuration files.\n", "Q: Plymouth messed up I used Plymouth manager, trying to the usual thing (changing the boot splash).

I have been reading about the issue of Samsung laptops bricking when attempted booting from live USB. I have Samsung Series 7 NP700Z5C (-S02UB to be specific) laptop. It came with Windows 8 preloaded. Some posts claim that they disabled secure boot and installed Ubuntu in EFI mode.  On the otherhand comments on this bug report state the issue to be with UEFI implementation and not with Secure Boot.\nI really want to dual Ubuntu with Windows 8. Can someone help with UEFI mode installation process ?\n\nA: Is it safe to install any OS on Samsung UEFI Laptops ?\nShort answer No\nAs far back as August 2012 in Launchpad Bugs reports began that installing Ubuntu could brick certain Samsung Laptops. Initially this was seen as an Ubuntu problem or perhaps a wider Linux issue.  However, It has since become clear that this is not a problem with Linux or Ubuntu but a problem with the firmware in some Samsung Laptops.\nA report by Matthew Garett shows that this is not limited to Linux but is possible in Windows too.  The original belief was that the samsung-laptop driver was doing something that caused the system to stop working. However while changes have been made to mitigate this; and some people have successfully installed Ubuntu; it does not fix the problem.  It just avoids one way of triggering it.\nUEFI is supposed to make it easier to record information on system crashes but appears that this information is causing the problem.  Microsoft have requested that there is 64KB available for this and the problem has been seen with 10KB or less of this space used so it likely that if if Windows crashes this will brick your laptop too.\nSamsung laptops in the 300E5C, NP700Z5C, NP700Z7C and 530U3C series are affected and there may be others too as it would seem reasonable that Samsung will want to keep the firmware across its range of Laptops as similar as possible. For the moment I would assume that this bug exists in all there Laptops Using using UEFI. Samsung are working on a firmware update but this has yet to be released.\nFor now the advice has to be do not install any OS on a Samsung UEFI Laptop.  However there does appear to be a work around by disabling UEFI but that will require you to re-install Windows 8 (if you want Windows on your machine) You should then be able to install Ubuntu or any other OS.\nLinks:\nhttp://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2013/02/11/linux-samsung-deaths-2/1\nhttp://www.bit-tech.net/news/hardware/2013/01/31/linux-samsung-deaths/1\nhttp://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/02/01/linux_samsung_laptop_fix_advice/\n", "Q: Why I can't put LibreOffice icons on the desktop?

Don't fret however there may be a solution for you, the first drop-down box contains a list of Types.  \nWindow class will be very broad: normal, dialog, modaldialog etc. \nWindow Title is, you guessed it by title (probably where I would start if I were the op). \nWindow Name is likely a hex name or a name given to the window by the WM, and might work, as it might not be unique to one and only one window. \nWindow ID will be unique, but might change per session, I'm not to certain I would try it. \nWindow Role is another generic label: notification, panel, toolbox, etc.\nWindow Type is likely to be another generic name convention, and it's not likely to work for you.\nNote: I could be wrong about the types, but I would try xprop on the window to get all relevant information on it first, before making any changes, just to be certain that you select the right type.\nxprop spews more info than you will need, look for these:\nWM_NAME(STRING) = \"Window Name\"\nWM_CLASS(STRING) = \"windowclass\", \"Windowclass\"\nWM_TRANSIENT_FOR(WINDOW): window id # 0xc00003\nWM_CLIENT_LEADER(WINDOW): window id # 0xc00001\nBeware: some windows (most i think) will give output like this:\n_NET_WM_...\nI'm fairly certain that what is in these field isn't what your looking for.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to use old Windows 7 install in Ubuntu?

I've got as far as getting a full LAMP setup running, but have hit a dead end trying to get a domain name to point to my server.\nI've set up a virtual host in an Apache .conf file, and set up the IP address in the hosts file with the domain name, and have pointed the A record to the IP address with no luck. I've also installed bind9, but thought I'd see if I'm going in the wrong direction rather than messing anything up with that.\nWhat is the best way to get a domain name up and running - ideally in a way that would be production ready rather than a temporary setup\nEDIT: Thanks for the tips - just to better inform the situation - I have a few spare domain names registered that I can use, and I'm renting a VPS to play with. Currently I have the DNS * and @ A record pointing to the IP, but the nameservers are with the registrar if that makes a difference?\n\nA: You should start by seeing if you can change your domain's DNS in their control panel.  If you can, then you shoud set the domain to use an A record to point to the IP address for your VPS you're running stuff on.  Once you do that, wait 24 hours and check to see if the domain correctly points to your server.\n\nA: You don't need to install bind9 or manage your own DNS server for your purpose, that would make things more complex.\nI suggest to setup an account on http://freedns.afraid.org and use their DNS servers.

Before you proceed, though, you may want to read my Web page on EFI boot loaders for Linux. It contains a lot of background information you may find helpful. Also, I recently heard that Ubuntu 12.04.2 has been released, and it includes some improvements to its EFI support. Thus, if you're not already using that version, you might want to give it a try.\nBeyond that, here's what I suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Before installing, use a Linux emergency disk to pre-partition the disks. Use a GUID Partition Table (GPT) scheme, create an EFI System Partition (ESP) on at least one disk, and create a separate non-RAID Linux /boot partition that uses ext2/3/4fs or ReiserFS. The former is required to boot an EFI-based computer. The latter isn't required by all boot loaders, but if you don't have such a partition, you'll be limited to using GRUB 2, which doesn't always work well. With a separate /boot partition, you'll be able to choose from among several boot loaders.\n\n*When you boot the installer, drop to a shell and look for the directory /sys/firmware/efi. If it's not present, you've probably booted in BIOS mode, which won't work -- or at best, it will require jumping through some extra hoops after installation. Thus, if this directory is missing, reboot and try to find your firmware option to select the boot mode (BIOS/legacy/CSM vs. EFI/UEFI).\n\n*If you still see the error that you report or if you can only boot in BIOS mode, you should be able to complete the installation and then install your boot loader or boot manager from an emergency system. This will require extra effort, but it can be done. See the page I referenced earlier on EFI boot loaders for details. If you can't figure out how to boot the installer in EFI mode, though, it's conceivable that your computer is BIOS-only or has such a buggy or restrictive EFI that it's not worth the effort to try to force an EFI-mode boot.\n\n\nA: I reformatted my main partition with ext4:\n\n\n*\n\n*Went into terminal with Ctrl+Alt+F1.\n\n*Then formatted the partition as super-user:\nsudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda2\n\n\nA: Jake, \nI had same error when I was trying to install EFI ubuntu 12.04.

However now I cannot run the drivers without a password.  Nor can I create one in the settings.

I am running 12.04 LTS. There are a number of shared resources that I use that are housed remotely on a local server. When disconnected from the network (on say a network, or router failure), I would like to dynamically archive, rename, and un-archive directory backups to continue the use of these shared assess until the network is restored.\nIs there a preferred method of gaining this data and triggering scripts or other system actions when the connected state changes?\nEDIT: After some additional research I see that there is the possibility of doing this with udev from Triggering an action when a specific volume is connected. However is this the best way? Also is there an alternative tool for udevinfo? It does not appear to be part of the package.\n\nA: When a network interface is brought up or down, scripts under /etc/network are executed. You can put your script in /etc/networking/if-down.d or in /etc/networking/if-post-down.d. The former runs with the interface still available while the latter runs with the interface already disconnected; of course, the interface may have been brought down automatically because the local network failed, in which case you won't be able to use the network even from if-down. The script gets information about the network interface through environment variables as documented in the interfaces(5) manual page. Be sure to react only to a loss of the interface(s) that matter.\nIf the network connection drops due to a failure somewhere outside the local link, or even because the first router stops working properly, your machine won't be notified. To detect such loss of service, you need to run some kind of heartbeat service that periodically checks that the remote server is still alive and responding. There isn't a one-size-fits-all solution here because different use cases call for different thresholds between “the network/server is slow” and “the network/server is down”. Also, determining whether the server is alive is application-specific; it can be a ping, or an HTTP request, or a keepalive packet on a TCP connection, etc.\n", "Q: Radeon HD 6850 Incorrect Graphics Drivers?

And why did Wubi set me up with a non-admin account?\n\nA: I'd recommend filing a bug and attaching your logfile (from the %TEMP% directory in Windows: wubi-12.10-rev273.log. \nYou could try to fix it manually by booting into the Recovery menu: hold the Shift key after selecting Ubuntu, select Advanced options and then Recoverymode. Once you see the recovery menu select the root prompt.\nFirst you need to remount the drive read/write:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nAnd then add yourself to the sudo group and reboot:\nusermod -a -G sudo nathanbrauer\nreboot\n\nI've never heard of this problem before on a Wubi install, so don't know if this will fix it or whether there is some other underlying problem. But it's probably quicker to try than reinstalling. I do recommend filing that bug report though.\n\nA: you can type\nsudo su -\nEnter your user password now you are in a root user then you can change your root password by typing\npasswd\nit will ask for password and re-enter it again\n", "Q: Icons and bars on desktop not showing I am using ubuntu 12.10 and today after i updated my software, when the computer restarted, the icons and menu bars on the desktop did not show.

I have a wacom intuos 2 9x12 that will will not map correctly to my second monitor which is also 9x12(1400x1050). The reason I need to solve this is because I have created a homemade cintiq and I draw on the screen (you can see what I'm talking about here: http://forum.bongofish.co.uk/index.php?topic=2096.0). The pen matches quite accurately on the x axis of my screen, so I believe the width of my wacom tablet area is okay. I think the problem is the y axis of my wacom. The cursor matches my pen towards the bottom of the screen, but as I move to the top of the screen, the distance from my pen tip to the cursor increases(the cursor is about 1 inch below pen when at top of screen).\nI have looked on the Internet for hours trying to find a solution and I cannot find any. \nAlso, I want to say that this problem only happens in Ubuntu, I also have Windows 7 installed, and the wacom matches the screen perfectly. I'm also a complete noob to linux so I don't know much about navigating terminal.\n\nA: I found out what my problem was. Intuos2 wacom tablets have an allocated portion of the tablet area that is meant for custom buttons that work with the pen.\nIn windows, they are configured to be seen. In Ubuntu, the section is included as being a part of the area and this distorts the mapping. To fix it, I had to configure my xsetwacom \"device name\" Area 0 0 30480 24060 to Area 0 1400 30480 24060.\nI still would like to know how to make the changes permanent. All I can do now is do a startup script that does this, but it doesn't work very well.\n\nA: Don't know if this will help you, but I have a script with the following in it:\nxsetwacom set \"Wacom BambooFun 6x8 stylus\" MapToOutput HEAD-0\nxsetwacom set \"Wacom BambooFun 6x8 eraser\" MapToOutput HEAD-0\n\nWhich seems to correctly map the stylus and eraser to my primary monitor. I don't remember where I originally got it nor if I had to do any configuration before it worked.\nRunning the script on startup seems fine to me.\n\nA: Here is a small bash-script, based on Starbucks answer, that changes the monitor output of all wacom devices to your main monitor (or the id of a given monitor, if provided as an argument).\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#check if monitor number was given\nif test -z \"$1\" \nthen\n  #no monitor number was given, use the main display\n  MON_NO=0\nelse\n  MON_NO=$1\nfi\n\n\n#get connection of monitor with number $MON_NO\nMON_CON=$(xrandr --listactivemonitors | grep \"$MON_NO:\" | tr -s \" \" | cut -d \" \" -f 5)\n\n#check if monitors id could be found\nif test -z \"$MON_CON\"\nthen\n  #no monitor with given number found!\n  echo \"no monitor with number $MON_NO was found!\"\n  MON_COUNT=$(xrandr --listactivemonitors | grep \"Monitors:\" | cut -d \" \" -f 2)\n  echo \"(A total of $MON_COUNT monitors were found.)\"\n  exit -1\nfi\n\n#for each id of wacom devices set correct output monitor\nxsetwacom list devices |\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n  #get id of wacom device in line\n  WACOM_ID=\"$(echo $line | sed 's/.*id: //' | cut -d \" \" -f 1)\"\n  #set monitor as output\n  xsetwacom --set $WACOM_ID MapToOutput $MON_CON\ndone\n\necho \"Changed monitor for all wacom devices.\"\n\n\nA: First, determine how your system recognizes your tablet.\nIn a terminal enter: xsetwacom --list devices \n\nWacom BambooPT 2FG 4x5 Pen stylus id: 10  type: STYLUS\nWacom BambooPT 2FG 4x5 Finger touch    id: 11  type: TOUCH\nWacom BambooPT 2FG 4x5 Pad pad     id: 12  type: PAD\nWacom BambooPT 2FG 4x5 Pen eraser  id: 17  type: ERASER\n\nNext determine which display or \"output\" to map your tablet to in your systems display settings or in the terminal with xrandr --listactivemonitors\non my system that shows: \n\n0: +*HDMI-2 1920/521x1080/293+1600+0  HDMI-2\n1: +HDMI-1 1600/443x900/249+0+0  HDMI-1\n\nFinally, using the information you just gathered, use\nxsetwacom --set \"[YourWacomDevice]\" MapToOutput [your display] (repeat for each device listed ).\n[YourWacomDevice] = device name or id:#\nso, for me that would be \n\nxsetwacom --set \"10\" MapToOutput HDMI-2\nxsetwacom --set \"11\" MapToOutput HDMI-2\nxsetwacom --set \"12\" MapToOutput HDMI-2\nxsetwacom --set \"17\" MapToOutput HDMI-2\n\nSince these settings aren't kept after a reboot, you may want to save them in a script that runs on startup.\n\nUsing xsetwacom --help lists possible options and commands. With the --list parameters command, we can see a list of all the supported parameters.

I've tried checking my system drive using both touch /forcefsck and fsck from a DVD boot of Ubuntu, and both times it's been done remarkably quickly; like a few seconds for a 101 GB partition. Is that... normal?\nThis is being done due to some slightly odd behaviour on my computer -- a disappearing GRUB, and the failure of the computer to boot beyond powering up once or twice. The filesystem is well-established (a partition on a 500 GB drive), and the computer works normally when it boots, so I was trying to fsck for drive errors. \n\nA: I would expect that a 100+GB drive should be taking longer than a few seconds.  Somewhere closer to a minute would probably be more like what you should see.\nA clean FS on a partition of that size should be checked in a span closer to minutes not seconds.\nThe answer to the question is going to vary based on a number of parameters.  How fast the drive is, how much data is on the actual filesystem, and what condition the hard disk is in are all going to lend to the speed with which a fsck is performed.\n", "Q: installing ubuntu on windows xp I want to put ubuntu 12.10 on a Sandisk Cruzer 4gb USB flash drive, and then plug in the flash drive to my dell dimension 3000 so I can boot off the flash drive and install ubuntu.

Use the -p option of sshfs\n\n*Use the debug option of sshfs: -o sshfs_debug\n\n*Is login with ssh as root on the server possible at all? Some distros disable this by default.\n\n*The user must be a member of the fuse group: sudo addgroup YOUR_USER fuse\n\n*The mount point must be writeble by the user and empty\n\n\nExample:\nmkdir ~/mnttest\nsshfs -o sshfs_debug -p 22 root@myserver:/ ~/mnttest\n\nUnmounting:\nfusermount -u ~/mnttest\n\n\nA: In my case when sshfs did not work without a good error message, it turned out that \"on the other side\" there was a symbolic link pointing to another folder.\nSo sshfs user@myserver:/home/user/symboliclink does not work,\nbut mounting to original folder does work,\ni.e. sshfs user@myserver:/opt/realfolder.\n", "Q: How to install Virtual box on Ubuntu Can someone help me install Virtual box on my Ubuntu machine?

Thank you so very much! Have a wonderful day!\n\n\n*\n\n*Cody.\n\n\nA: Installing the package using the Software Centre provides you with the VirtualBox program itself. You will be able to make new VM's, or add existing ones, and run them with the interface it provides.\nThere are some hardware features, like USB 2.0, that need additional files in order to be usable. Highly recommended are the VirtualBox Guest Additions, which provide the guest operating system with drivers that help it run better. Also, you can get the VirtualBox Extension Pack, which enables features like USB 2.0.\n\nA: First, open a terminal using Ctrl+Alt+T and type in the terminal to update repositories and stuff:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nWe want to really install VirtualBox now, so when sudo apt-get update finishes with no errors, run this command in the terminal (again):\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-4.2\n\nIf you have issues, it most likely is beacuse of the VirtualBox kernel. Type in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install dkms\n\nAnd again:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThe package \"dkms\" helps if you are having issues with the Virtualbox kernel.\nNow you have successfully installed VirtualBox 4.2. Enjoy your virtual operating systems!\n", "Q: How can I make a .jar file executable? I'm trying to run a jar application under Ubuntu, so I installed OpenJDK Java 7 Runtime, but when I open this application I got this message :\n\nThe file '/home/aimad/Programms/jMerise/JMerise.jar' is not marked as\n  executable.  If this was downloaded or copied from an untrusted\n  source, it may be dangerous to run.  For more details, read about the\n  executable bit.\n\n\nA: Right click on the file, click on properties, then go to the Permissions tab, and check the box that says \"Allow executing this file as a program\".\n\n\nA: Since you run your jar application with java -jar application.jar then that means java is on your path. You need two simple things:\n1) add an interpreter (which apparently is #!java -jar) in the first line of your jar file jut like you do that with your shell scripts: \n\necho '#!java -jar' > app.jar\ncat application.jar >> app.jar\nmv app.jar application.jar\n\nIf you cat the contents of your jar file you'll see it starts with ex.:\n#!java -jar\nPK\n    ^lN                  BOOT-INF/PK \n.....\n.....\n\n2) add execute attribute by chmod +x application.jar\nNow you are able to \"self-run\" it via ./application.jar.\n\nA: First you'll need to make sure you have a suitable Java runtime environment on your system. Ubuntu has openjdk in the official repo which is 99.99% combatible with Oracle Java, to install it type:\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre\nNext create a file called java-jar-launcher.desktop in ~/.local/share/applications and put the following contents in it:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Java Application Launcher\nIcon=java\nExec=/usr/bin/java -jar %U\nCategories=Application;Java\nTerminal=False\n\nNext add the following line in ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list:\napplication/x-java-archive=java-jar-launcher.desktop;\nNow you should be able to just double click jar files to launch them, if nothing happens then right click on a jar file, select properties then  go to the \"Open With\" tab and there you should see \"Java Application Launcher\", select that. \nThis method is prefferable (IMHO) because this way you are not giving execute permissions to jar files which can be potentially dangerous. This method will only work in a graphical environment and needs the user to manually double click on the file.\n\nA: You can always run a jar file by doing java -jar JMerise.jar.\nHowever, to make the jar file itself executable, you need to set the executable bit, as the message hints. chmod +x /home/aimad/Programms/jMerise/JMerise.jar will accomplish this.\nAfter that you can do ./JMerise.jar to run it.\nman chmod will provide you with information about how chmod works.\nAlso see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/ExecutableBit\n\nA: If running a .jar file from the command line works (java -jar myFile.jar), but double-clicking it in the GUI does not, and if sudo chmod +x myFile.jar appears to succeed but you still can't open with double-click, and if right-clicking the .jar file > Properties > Permissions > \"Allow executing file as program\" does not work (i.e., the checkbox switches back just after you click it), then probably the .jar file is on an NTFS file system, which does not allow execute permissions on a per-file basis. (You may have this problem if you dual-boot, for example, and have a shared NTFS partition between Ubuntu and Windows). \nCreating a launcher (as @tusharkant15 describes) will work because behind the scenes you're executing /usr/bin/java, not the .jar file itself. Moving the .jar file to some other file system that is not NTFS will also work.\n", "Q: How can I merge unversioned MonoDevelop code back into a git repository?

His portion of the code is now hosted on GitHub, and we're wondering how we might use git to merge my unversioned code in with his. Any suggestions?\n\nA: His code, and your code, should share a common origin.\nWhat you need is a git repository with this common origin as a revision.\nHis code state should use this common origin as a parent, so should yours.\nThat copy he gave you should do - if you still have an archive of it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new git repo\n\n*Copy the origin code into it\n\n*Add and commit\n\n*Now create and check out a new branch for his code (git checkout -b his-code)\n\n*Delete all the origin code, put his new code in\n\n*Add and commit\n\n*Check out the origin code again (git checkout master)\n\n*Make a new branch for YOUR code (git checkout -b my-code)\n\n*Delete the origin code, put in your code\n\n*Add and commit\n\n\nNow you have a repository with the history of both your changes from a common origin.

Some agencies encrypt everything regardless of need. If this is non-sensitive data argue that it doesn't need encrypting. If they can use alternative software (like a Truecrypted USB drive) that would also work for you. You never know, they might even listen.\n\n*Ask Check Point Software for a Linux version. Unless they're already working on it, don't hold your breath. This is serious software that will require serious (long and expensive) testing.\n\n*Install Windows in VirtualBox, install Check Point and try to copy the data out.

However, by default it looks quite alien to the Ubuntu desktop as it doesn't appear to use a GTK theme. Unfortunately there is no setting to change is.\nIs there anything I can do to make yEd more integrated into the Ubuntu desktop?\n\nA: yEd uses Java's metallic theme by default. What you want is Java's GTKLookandFeel theme. Normally you would be able to do this by starting yEd with:\njava -Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKLookAndFeel -jar yed.jar\n\nDue to a bug in yEd/Java this does not work currently. For now you will have to apply the \nfollowing workaround:\n1.) Navigate to yEd's installation folder\ncd $HOME/.yed\n\n2.) Edit yed.jar and delete the class causing the theme issues\nmv yed.jar yed.zip\nzip -d yed com/jgoodies/looks/plastic/Plastic3DLookAndFeel.class\nmv yed.zip yed.jar\n\nYou can now start yEd in GTK mode.\nWith some Java versions you might run into a scenario where all fonts in the GTK theme are formatted in bold. You can troubleshoot this by uninstalling a korean font package:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge  fonts-unfonts-core \n\nIf you don't feel like removing packages just to troubleshoot Oracle's bugs you can try out the workaround outlined in this comment.\n\nReferences:\nhttp://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/java-programm-yed-aussehen-anpassen/#post-5244382\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-7/+bug/937200\n", "Q: Can I upgrade from 12.10 to 13.04 via an ISO image?

Is it possible?\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes it is very possible and I would do it except my computer is too old. \nI think you might be able to just download the ISO and put it on a USB via UNetBootin/Startup Disk Creator (the unpacked image is now too large for most CDs) and then boot the ISO from the USB drive. \nI believe the startup disk will recognize you have a lower version installed and give you the option of upgrading from the disk.\nBest of luck!\n", "Q: Can I change LXDE default file browser to I have to use LXDE as my DE because of the age of my computer/hardware, and I like it a lot, but I also like using Nautilus as my File Manager (it appears to have more options) for basic file browsing.\nIf I can I would like to change my default file manager from pcmanfm to Nautilus.

(This consists mostly of proprietary drivers for officially supported devices.)\nMultiverse provides non-free software that is supported by the community.\nThe Partner repository, practically speaking, provides non-free software. The Extras repository provides some free software but mostly provides non-free software.\nMany repositories provide both binaries and source code. These are enabled separately in your APT configuration, however. Both binaries and source code from Main are free (as in freedom), for example.\nThere are no repositories in Ubuntu that are actually called Source code or Independent. Perhaps some other OS has repositories called that.

So I searched and read all of these solutions involving manually re-configuring GRUB system files, uninstalling and re-installing Windows, etc. All of these are terrible solutions.

I did not use 'Unsettings' to do this, as, for whatever reason, it could not render my launcher transparent in the least. While the launcher auto-hides properly, in accordance with my settings, it has left behind a large, colored bar (the same size as the launcher) in its place. This bar does not go away at any time, except for when a window is dragged across it, at which point it disappears entirely, around the window, and reappears when the window has left its premise.\nI am trying to rid myself of this colored bar; changing the desktop background has not fixed it, and logging out and logging back in has not fixed it either.\n\nA: unity --reset should reset your unity configuration if you're on 12.04 or earlier release.

Normally, any uid between 100 and 999 are dynamically created by packages installed on the system.  You can search through package postinst scripts to find packages which may have created it:  $ fgrep backup1 /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.postinst.  Does the user have a password in /etc/shadow?  Is the account locked?  What is the user's default shell?\n\nFollowup to additional information:\nA uid of 1006 is a \"normal\" login account, not a system account.  Additionally, since the user has a home directory in /home, has a login shell, and has a password this all indicates that the account was created by someone running adduser as root.  The account is not locked.  A locked account will have an '!' before the password hash.  You can lock the account by running passwd -l backup1.\nPotential sources for the creation of this account include:\n\n\n*\n\n*other system administrators\n\n*third-party software installers or packages that are not from the official Ubuntu repositories\n\n\nYou can also use the lastlog command to see when that account last logged in.\n", "Q: How to solve visual problems with the dash home?

I already installed Windows 7, and now i want to install Ubuntu, but when i load to the disk, goes the purple screen, i select the language, and then install ubuntu, after this is the problem. It either goes a black screen with flashing cusor for awhile before freezing, or goes the ubuntu loading screen the freezes after awhile. Now I've tried making a new disc and partions, and still have the samething happening. I've recently built this computer, it has i5 processor, 8gb ram, and a TB hard drive. So if any suggesting would be very helpful, because i've read every thing my CompTIA book has to offer, muiltiple thread, and nothing i've tried has worked. \n\nA: When you say 'disk', are you referring to a manufactured installation CD that you ordered online or purchased at a store, or a CD you made yourself by downloading an iso and burning it to the disk? If the latter is true, you may have gotten a bad download (as uncommon as it seems, trust me, it happens to all of us).\nIn addition to this, I generally recommend against using physical disks when installing Ubuntu (I have had some mess-ups when doing so myself); I have found one of the most reliable tool to use when installing more widely used distros (like Ubuntu & Mint) is Linux Live USB (Or LiLi, for short; link). It puts the image onto a flash drive, as opposed to a disk, so any 1GB flash drive will generally do. All of this, of course, is optional, and CDs may work fine for you, so I advise to redownload the iso before trying it on a flash drive.\nTo check for iso file corruption, as well, you can use md5sum. I would just google it, as it's a bit easier to explain without words.\n\nA: I had the same issues as well, when I did this, but eventually found this page: WindowsDualBoot: Ubuntu.com I hope it helps you, as it helped me greatly.\nI also used a USB and when I tried installing it via restart it wouldn't work, however, I went into it the USB's files in windows, found the installer, and used it that way, and installed it on my pre-prepared linux partition.\n", "Q: Wubi installer stuck on \"Downloading ubunt-12.04.2-wubi-amd64.tar.xz\" I downloaded and mounted the iso to install the 64 bit wubi, but every time I run it it gets stuck on \"Downloading ubuntu-12.04.2-wubi-amd64.tar.xz .

I have right here when running uname -a the version 3.5.0-26\nSo let's do an sudo apt-get update followed by a sudo apt-get upgrade and then reboot. When doing that, verify that any bluetooth related package (including python) gets updated. This update might be the solution. You would have to reboot to see if it works.\nThe output of bluetoothd suggest that it needs an update or a python library update. In both cases, the suggested update of the system might fix it. At least it worked for me but on a Desktop PC and a bluetooth dongle.\nIf not, maybe you can add the output of dmesg to include more information but am very positive that it will work after the update.\nUPDATE: Ok now am certain that after upgrading you have a 99% chance of getting it to work.

Good day,\nI have just downloaded ubuntu 12.10 today using windows 7 and installed it to my SD card. I booted up using the sdcard, and everything was going perfectly well until Ubuntu said i currently have no operating systems. So instead, I tried the 'Something Else' option, but it said that my hard drive is blank. Please help.\n\nA: I never heard of installing to an SD card before that's an interesting idea but it could also be your problem, I would recommend installing the .iso to a USB [also called a pendrive] with at least close to a gig of free space [it's easer if it's empty but that's not mandatory] you can find some software for doing this at pendrivelinux.com [YUMI is my favourite] also make sure if you have a 64bit computer you download the 64bit .iso . Some computers [mine included] do not work well with the 32bit version [64bit does not work at all on 32bit computers!]\nGood Luck!!!!\n\nA: The symptom of a blank hard disk is most often caused by one of two conditions:\n\n\n*\n\n*A partition table error -- Overlapping partitions, ambiguous GPT/MBR status, partitions too big for the disk, and other problems cause libparted (upon which most Linux partitioning tools are based) to flake out. A common symptom is a disk that appears to be empty. My FixParts program (included in the Ubuntu gdisk package, IIRC) can fix many of these problems.\n\n*Leftover RAID data -- A disk that used to be used in a motherboard-based software RAID configuration may have leftover RAID data that will confuse the system. You can usually remove this data by typing sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda (substituting the disk device filename for /dev/sda, if necessary). You must be sure that the disk is no longer used in a RAID configuration before you do this, though. You might also want to check your motherboard's firmware settings to be sure that RAID support is disabled.\n\n\nA: Check whether there is only one primary disk drive using any partitioning tools.If more than one primary drive is found convert it into logical drive. Don't change the windows drive to logical. There will be no problem in converting primary to logical, i.e, no data loss. I used Easeus Partition Master to do it and done it successfully. \n", "Q: Logitech Touchpad T650 does not click I have just received this Logitech Touchpad T650. The problem is that on my Ubuntu 12.10 desktop, the left or right tap clicks don't work while I can navigate and scroll with the touchpad. Any ideas to fix this?\nThanks\n\nA: As far as I've read/found, it behaves like a basic laptop touchpad on Ubuntu with the exception of two-finger scrolling (old school, not natural like touch screens). Tap clicks don't work and there aren't any pointer tools for it like those available for Windows...\nFor those wondering, it sort of gets the job done, but it's not really fully working yet. Unless some update has escaped me, the T650 is definitely NOT worth buying for Ubuntu machines right now.\n\nA: You need to update the touchpad T650 firmware. In order to do that, you will need a Windows box.\nGo to the link below and follow instructions.\nhttp://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/touchpad-t650?section=downloads&crid=398&bit=32&osid=14&softwareid=11370\nAfter firmware upgrade, it's working as expected on Ubuntu.\n\nA: I am adding this to expand on the firmware upgrade, which helps to enable all functionality under linux.\nI have spent some time figuring out how the update works, so I want to leave it for you to pick up when needed.\nYou will NOT do this with the USB cable connected, this update happens via BT:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to download the 'Logitech Unifying Software' (LUS) from the same page above and install it on a windows box (There is no firmware update you can download for XP, I did this on W7 via VirtualBox VM)\n\n*You need to download the update file that is called something like: RQM_041_001_00038.exe, and RUN it, seemingly nothing happens, but the file copies itself from to the LUS install location so it can be picked up\n\n*Restart\n\n*Start LUS and click 'Advanced' to see the paired devices\n\n*Add the touchpad by switching it ON with the receiver in USB\nI use the same brand keyboard, so it is useful to look at something like Solaar package to enable use of just one receiver for both devices.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:daniel.pavel/solaar\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install solaar\n\n\nA: On most Ubuntu distros 18.04 and beyond, at least, the Logitech T650 works fine; I use it everyday. There is one caveat with Lubuntu/Kubuntu, i.e., the KDE desktop; tapping-as-click and \"natural scrolling\" are not enabled by default. To enable them, you must run xinput and the appropriate commands. An example sequence is below. It's possible that installing synclient might fix these issues more permanently, but I found the default config with synclient even worse, so I abandoned it. \nHere's an example sequence: \nxinput\nCheck your devices; look for the Logitech touchpad's device number. Let's pretend it's number 12. \nxinput list-props 12\nLook for the libinput tapping enabled and libinput natural scrolling enabled to find their numbers. Let's pretend tapping is 290. 0 is off, 1 is on. \nxinput set-prop 12 290 1\nUnfortunately, this resets every time the computer restarts; I've yet to figure out how to make the changes permanent, though it may just be that I need to sign in as root or something. You can write a bash script to speed it up, but the number assigned to the device will sometimes change, meaning you may need to include a variety of numbers to ensure you'll get the slot it's using at the moment. \n", "Q: LXC: Can I guarantee a certain level of CPU resources to a given container We're going to use LXC to multi-purpose our hardware while keeping the various applications easy to manage, develop, upgrade, and logically segregated.\nWhat I want to know is if I can guarantee certain resources, such as CPU, to a certain container. \nWe have one process which will run in its own container that is a critical component of our application infrastructure.

In /etc/acpi/ there are several scripts that can be customized to do something when a particular event happens on your physical computer, like the lid.sh script which is called when the laptop lid is opened or closed, but I'm looking for a way to detect when something is plugged into or disconnected from the Mini DisplayPort, so that I can run a command.\nI don't see any such script in there (unless I've missed something).\nThe command would be to configure the multi-monitor setup automatically using xrandr. This used to happen automatically in Gnome (using ~/.config/monitors.xml I believe) but I've now switched to xmonad completely and it doesn't automatically detect this.\n\nA: Yes it should be possible using udev.\nI have asked/answered here a similar question (change sound output on HDMI (dis)connect). First you will need to create a udev rule like this:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"drm\", ACTION==\"change\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/update_screen_config\"\n\nIt should be on the same location as in my answer but you can change the name. To know exactly which SUBSYSTEM and ACTION you need use udevadm and connect your DP.

I have used a Python script but you can use anything you want, since it can be executed. This will be the script that is called when the cable is connected/disconnected, so it must find the current state and use xrandr to do what you need. See how I made the detection of the state of the screen and if it suits your needs.\nNote: this script is executed as root by udev, so test it as a normal user before you put him on udev. \n", "Q: Is it possible for /etc/hosts to include a file from my home directory?

I tried going to File, looking for a Save option, but it is not present. What should I do?\n\nA: The command line interpreter for Python is not an editor and does not have a save option. This is just something for testing your commands.\nYou need something like gedit (or another editor) to type your commands. Those editors all have save option. \n\nA: If you want to program with Python on Ubuntu, I suggest you use IDLE. IDLE was built entirely using Python and tK (a window module for python) and it works fine for anything I have ever done. \nIt gives you syntax highlighting and debugging features, very handy for tracking down bugs and the like.\nGedit also works, and it has several languages that it can syntax highlight, but it doesn't have the debugging features (at least that I have seen.)\nAnother one you could look into is Stani's Python Editor, another IDE developed by a user. \nLike @Rinzwind said, the python command line doesn't provide an option for saving your source files, it is just a way to test out commands and ideas without actually having to write a full program to do it.\n\nEDIT:\nAnother one I found very useful was Geany. \nI don't remember if I had to install it or not (probably did, simple search in the Software Center should bring it up). It gives code highlighting, auto-indentation, the ability to increase & decrease the indents on chunks of code, the ability to comment out chunks of code, and run the code directly from the IDE. You can also quickly swap between running it with python (default) and python3 or another.\n", "Q: How can I disable the SPAM notification from a known contact in Thunderbird? I am running Thunderbird Mail on Ubuntu 12.10. \nHow can I un-mark the SPAM notification from known contacts?\n\nA: If you are talking about the classification that Thunderbird itself does, there's a way. Go to your account settings, there go to \"Junk-Filter\" (I'm retranslating from German here, so I'm not 100% sure about the wording). There you should find something like \"Don't mark messages as junk automatically, if the sender is in one of the following address books\". There you can choose one or more address books. If somebody from those address books sends you an e-mail, Thunderbird automatically categorizes it as ham (no spam). \nIf, on the other hand, you are talking about the markings in the mail subject that some server-side tools like SpamAssassin set (\"**SPAM** the original subject of the mail\"), it's a different case. In that case you'd have to talk to your mail provider, if and how you can whitelist sender addresses.\n", "Q: DVD and VCD to Mp3 Is there any package that allows me to rip the DVD and VCD to MP3. I have few DVD and VCDs that I would like to put into MP3 Disc. Recording in software like Audacity is not an option for me.

This is what you would use for DVDs:\nmplayer dvd://$SourceTrack -dvd-device \"${SourceVtsPath}/${SourceVts}\" -aid \"128\" -dumpaudio -dumpfile \"$Outfile\"\n\nSearching online brings up the following example from the manual:\nmplayer vcd://2 -cdrom-device /dev/hdc\n\nThe most simple way of getting MP3 output of the MP2 audio dump would be:\nffmpeg -i input.mp2 output.mp3\n\nOr it wasn't standards compliant and you already have MP3.\n", "Q: How can I access shared folders on an Ubuntu host and a Windows XP guest?

Upgrading from 10.10 to 12.04 is unsupported, while 10.04 -> 12.04 should work.\n10.10 is no longer supported, and there is no upgrade path to any supported currently release. Just backup, and reinstall.\n12.04 will be supported until Aprl 2015.\nTo upgrade from 10.04 server to the next LTS, install update-manager-core, \nthen edit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades, and set Prompt=lts.\nYou'll obviously have to edit the /etc/apt/sources.list and reset every line back to lucid first.\n\nA: By far the easiest thing to do, and in practice less time consuming (although you might not think so) is to plan for this in advance and separate out your home and system directories onto different partitions. Use your home for any documents, files, scripts, and custom stuff - and keep system for things installed via dpkg or its descendents (ie: apt-get and any of the update GUIs) ONLY. If you need to change config files for X, samba, etc. keep a backup in your home directory.\nIf you run up gparted (use sudo apt-get install gparted if it's not already on your system), you can (to some extent) non-destructively split a single partition into two, and resize them later if you get space requirements wrong.\nOnce you've done that, just grab a new installer of 12.04 (I assume you want that specifically because it's LTS), and run it. \nI've been following this procedure on numerous operating systems (usually putting system and home on different physical drives) and it works well.\n", "Q: aptitude upgrade linux 3.2.0-39 problem since yesterday I am trying to upgrade my system to the latest version.

Anyone know how I could migrate my current ubuntu system to a vm?\n\nA: You can image your Ubuntu install from a live CD using dd. You can then boot the raw image with most any virtualization technology or convert the raw image.\nAs you are doing so you may run into problems, especially if you installed the ATI drivers, and so as advised it may be better to simply do a fresh install.\nAssuming your Ubuntu is installed to /dev/sda , from a live CD run dd\ndd if=/dev/sda1 of=/storage/ubuntu.img bs=1024 \n\nThe final ubuntu.img will be as large as your Ubuntu install and will need to be stored on a separate partition or external storage.\nYou can boot the raw image as a hard disk or convert it to a virtualbox (or other) image\nVBoxManage convertdd ubuntu.img ubuntu.vdi\n\n\nA: It's not much different from machine-to-machine disk copy. Try using Clonezilla.\nBefore running clonezilla to make a partition image, I'd run e2fsck -f then resize2fs -M to make the original partition to the smallest, so that when you are moving the partition to the VM, you can make it to any size you want.\nNote that, though I've done resize2fs -M many times and successful, it can go wrong. So be sure to have a backup.\nI'd install a new Ubuntu in a VM so that you can do the partition as you like, then overwrite the partition from the original partition image created by Clonezilla. That way, you know the bootstrap works in the VM, and you are replacing the partition.\nOnce the partition is restored, while still in Clonezilla resize2fs (with no option) makes the file system to fit to the partition map (aka enlarged to the max).\nThis is how I usually transfer system from one system to other, reglardless of VM or non-VM.\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu on my phone (Sony Ericsson w8)?

I tried to find what actions are executed for this keys.\nany idea appreciated ;)\n\nA: Synetech gives a very readable explanation about the Fn keys here\n\nTechnical Details\nWhen you press a key on a keyboard, the keyboard controller (a small\n  IC chip inside the keyboard) detects the electrical circuit and\n  processes it to decode which key was pressed and then sends the\n  scancode to the motherboard. The operating system receives\n  scancode from the BIOS and then performs whatever action it needs to\n  in order to process that keypress.\nWith most keys, this is simple enough. If you press the A\n  key, its keyboard controller sends the scancode to the motherboard\n  which then passes it to the OS which in turn usually prints 'A'. (If\n  the OS detects that one of the modifier keys is currently held down,\n  then it may do something different. In fact, you can configure it to\n  do whatever you want when the A key is pressed with or\n  without modifiers.)\nNow the Fn key is special. When you press it by itself,\n  nothing happens because it is exclusively a modifier key and is not\n  (generally) meant to do anything on its own. When you hold it and\n  press another key, the keyboard controller detects that and looks in\n  its built-in table to see if it is a known combination. If the combo\n  is not in the table, then it just ignores it, but if the combo is in\n  the table, then it looks up the associated scancode and sends that.\nWhat does the OS end up seeing? It does not see the scancode for\n  the Fn key and the scancode for the other key. Instead, it\n  sees a single scancode associated with whatever function the Fn-combo\n  has been set to. For example, if the laptop manufacturer has set the\n  Fn+Down Arrow combo to reduce the volume, then\n  the OS sees the scancode associated with the Volume Down,\n  which some keyboards actually have.\n\nAlso note that the Fn key works independently from the operating system.\nMoreover, this article may help point you in the right direction:\n\nThe kernel has its own scancode to\n  keycode mapping table, so it maps a certain scancode to a\n  keycode. You can look into /usr/include/linux/input.h to see what your\n  kernel uses for scancode to keycode mapping – it is called a\n  keymap.\n\n\nPostscript\nI might need to somewhat renege on the earlier claim that the Fn keys work entirely independently of the OS; without going into more technical details here, the upshot seems to be that your OS might not \"support\" all or some of your keyboard's Fn keys, see, for instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/extra_keyboard_keys\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/274715/blue-fn-function-keys-not-working-with-lubuntu-on-my-thinkpad\n", "Q: failed to load file amd-ucode/micrcode_amd.bin kickstart vm new kickstart iso.. when I restart my ubunutu server I get the following error ubuntu failed to load file amd-ucode/microcode_amd.bin I tried to search for the file on my \"regularly\" installed ubunutu-server but I couldn't find it.. and I don't get the error message when I reboot it \n\nA: The package is named amd64-microcode\nContents:\n\n/lib/firmware/amd-ucode/microcode_amd.bin\n/lib/firmware/amd-ucode/microcode_amd_fam15h.bin\n/usr/share/doc/amd64-microcode/README.Debian\n/usr/share/doc/amd64-microcode/README.gz\n/usr/share/doc/amd64-microcode/changelog.Debian.gz\n/usr/share/doc/amd64-microcode/copyright\n/usr/share/doc/amd64-microcode/microcode_amd.bin.README\n/usr/share/doc/amd64-microcode/microcode_amd_fam15h.bin.README\n/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/amd64-microcode\n/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-premount/amd64-microcode\n\nSo a \nsudo apt-get install amd64-microcode\n\nshould fix that error if it failed to install during the installation.\n", "Q: Why have I lost the 2.1 sound settings on my Asus N76VZ DH71?

I have tried to do this by going to \nSettings > User Accounts > My Account \nand pressing the Unlock button in the top right corner of the window. I get the Authentication is required to change user data pop up and I enter my password to get access. This is what i see. (I've blacked out my account name)\n\nAs you can see Automatic Login is set to OFF but like I said, when I click my account from the login screen I get automatically logged in with out requiring a password. I guess that is not what they mean by automatic login. \nUPDATE 1: The user Rinzwind explained to me how Ubuntu On/Off switches work so I made sure that it was set it to Off but when I restart, I get automatically logged in. Then when I open my user account and look at Automatic Login, it is set to On again. Something, maybe a setting in a script, is resetting Automatic Login back to On. Any ideas on why this is happening?\nUPDATE 2: The user Rinzwind suggested I see if anything changes in the /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf when I switch Automatic Login -> On and Off. I did that and did see a change. \nWhen I set Automatic Login to Off \n\nthe lightdm.conf file looks like this:\n[SeatDefaults]\nautologin-guest=false\nautologin-user=max\nautologin-user-timeout=0\nautologin-session=lightdm-autologin\nuser-session=ubuntu\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\n\nbut when I set Automatic Login to On \n\nthe lightdm.conf file looks like this:\n[SeatDefaults]\nautologin-guest=false\nautologin-user=\nautologin-user-timeout=0\nautologin-session=lightdm-autologin\nuser-session=ubuntu\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nmax@siddhion:~$ \n\nSo as you can see the difference is that when Automatic Login is On autologin-user equals nothing but, when Off, autologin-user equals max which is me. Not sure what difference this makes since even when I set it to Off, I still get logged in automatically. Any ideas?\nNOTE 1 When I suspend my laptop and return to it again, I am presented with a prompt to enter my password to access my account. So at least that is working.

It does not bother me again about unlocking it ;)\n\nedit: the color of the background of the slider changes color. \n\n\nA: I just had same problem, and solve it after reading this wiki about users and groups.\nI found an other GUI application to manage users: \nThis application is users-admin part of Gnome System Tools.\nInstall it with this command line: \nsudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools\n\nLaunch it with the command:\nusers-admin \n\n\nIn front of Password you should have Not requested at logon (translated from french)\nClick then on Modify and a new window will appear.\n\nJust untick the last option Do not ask password at connection\nAnd problem should be solved.\n\nA: I think it's a misunderstanding between automatic and passwordless. In automatic login, the system bypasses the lightdm greeter screen, and goes straight to the named user's desktop session. In passwordless login the user must still select or enter (depending on the show-manual-login flag) their username at the greeter screen, but is not required to authenticate using a password. Only a single user can be the nominated autologin-user, but multiple users may have passwordless logins by adding them to the nopasswdlogin group. \nYou can see which users (if any) are allowed to log in without supplying a password by examining the group membership e.g.\n$ getent group nopasswdlogin\nnopasswdlogin:x:112:steeldriver\n\nTo turn off the behavior, you can follow the GUI method described by @Boris using the Gnome users-admin tool, or simply remove the user from the nopasswdlogin group using the command-line gpasswd command i.e\nsudo gpasswd --delete user nopasswdlogin\n\nA: I have managed to fix this on my PC running 12.10. I created another user account with administrator privileges and password and switched automatic login off on the new account. I rebooted my PC and the old account then allowed me to login but still did not ask for my password. However the new administrator account created required a password to login. I then logged out of my old administrator account and logged into my new administrator account using the new account's password. I then disabled the old administrator account using the new administrator account. I then rebooted my PC. Then logged into my new administrator account again. I then re-enabled my old administrator account and set a new password and automatic login switched off. I then rebooted my PC again and it worked. My old administrator account required a password before I could log in. The used the new password I set for my old account and it logged in. Fixed. I then used my old administrator account, which now needed a password to login, and removed the new administrator account I created. Problem solved. My original administrator account now requires a password to login each time I switch my PC on. Hope this helps!\n", "Q: Ubuntu suspended - external harddrive no longer powers? I recently got a new laptop and I've just installed Ubuntu 12.04 on it. I went to transfer files over from my old laptop using my external hard drive and closed the lid when I went away, forgetting I hadn't changed the power settings to do nothing when the lid is closed, so the laptop suspended.\nWhen I reopened the lid, later on, I realised this and got errors that the folders could not be transferred anymore as they did not exist.\nMy external harddrive is no longer powering up. Is this normal? Can it be fixed?\n\nA: This is the result of the ( brain-damaged imho ) way Linux handles USB disks during suspend.  It can't be sure that you didn't unplug the disk, plug it into another computer, modify it, and plug it back in to this one while it was suspended, so it just assumes you did unplug the drive, and breaks the mount point.\nYou'll have to make sure the drive is unmounted ( a reboot will be sure to do the trick ), and then plug the drive back in, and fsck it.  You can do this with either the gnome-disk-utility or gparted.\n", "Q: How to run Ubuntu without GUI in Virtual Box?

It goes like this:\nISP->NAT Router (contains a wireless part and ethernet ports)->My computer(wired), my laptop (wireless), my mom's computer (wireless), and my server (wired).\nbefore I installed the Ubuntu server I had WHS1 for backups only, my DHCP was the router, DNS - set to router's IP which had the ISP's DNS servers set.\nYesterday I decided to switch to Ubuntu server. I installed the DHCP server on ubuntu, configured it completely, everything works. It's hostname is 'ubuntuserver' and the domain (I think that's what it is) is 'home'.\nThen I set up the server to be a DNS server as well to cache the answers from an external DNS servers (Google's and OpenDNS).\nThe problem is that I just can't get to ping  internal hostnames in my local network (e.g. From my computer 'ping ubuntuserver'/vice versa -> unknown host).\nNow I know that all what I've configured has nothing to do with it because these are external DNS server.\nI know there is the hosts file, but I DO NOT want to configure it in each PC, my question is - Where/How I configure a table ON THE SERVER so all the local machine will identify hostnames?\nit fails in Ping HOSTNAME and dig HOSTNAME...\nWhen 'ping ubuntuserver.local' it works.\nLong story short - Doing 'ping ubuntuserver' doesnt work, doing 'ping ubuntuserver.local' does work. Where do I configure ON THE SERVER a table for local Address Resolution so it applies for all local machines connected to the DNS?\nEdit:\nWell, I deleted bind9 because I found out that it's name caching is not worth it.\nI figured out I don't mind using \"ping hostname.local\" instead of \"ping hometaname\" and configuring a zone file is too much trouble just for a 4 computers LAN.\n\nA: You have to configure you LAN servers / desktops into your local DNS server. The configuration varies by DNS server and it gets a little more difficult in that you are going to want to assign static IP addresses on your LAN.\nPersonally on a small LAN I use dnsmasq as I find it easy to configure.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Dnsmasq\nhttp://wiki.debian.org/HowTo/dnsmasq\nIf you are using BIND see\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BIND9ServerHowto\nIf you are having a specific problem with a specific server, we need to know what you are using and you need to post configuration information.\n", "Q: How do I obtain updates on Ubuntu Server?

Heed the messages Ubuntu is giving you. Your drive is failing. I don't care what Windows (especially XP) says. By the time Windows figures it out, you probably won't even be able to boot to the drive.\nYes, brand-new drives can fail.

Dnsmasq forwards DNS queries to the DNS servers whose addresses have been provided by the DHCP server. It is also possible to set these DNS server addresses statically using the Connection Editor.\nThe dnsmasq executable is provided by the dnsmasq-base package on which the network-manager package depends. There is also a package called simply \"dnsmasq\" which also depends on dnsmasq-base, but this \"dnsmasq\" package should only be installed if you want to run dnsmasq independently of NetworkManager in order to take advantage of features other than mere DNS forwarding.\n\nA: You're using the 217.0.43.129. if both your primary and secondary DNS are not found, it'll go to your router and use the DNS server configured in the router. If that DNS fails as well, it'll probabely try to connect to the openDNS server. as configured in /etc/resolv.conf.\nhttps://lists.isc.org/pipermail/bind-users/2006-October/064570.html\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove all the packages installed from a specific repository?

Having used Lenovo Easy Setup to configure the raid (1 array with 2 1tb drives) I chose \"Yes\".\nIt takes me to the Partition manager where I can see three options, and a blank line after the first:\n* Configure iSCSI\n* ___________________\n* Undo Partition Changes\n* Write changes to disk\n\nI have no idea what iSCSI is but I'm pretty sure it's not for me.\nUndo partition changes just hangs the system at a purple screen.\nWrite changes to disk gives me an error stating no root files system is defined.\nWhat should I do to get Ubuntu installed with the RAID?\n\nA: Hei man, I had successful install the Ubuntu 12.04 amd64 to my RD330.\nThe point is error of install grub to the mega raid disk.\nThe way to get through this problem is :\nI suppose your RD330 is the default BIOS setup (include the RAID setup).\nAnd you need a DVD of Ubuntu amd64 installation.\nAnd then you can boot up from the DVD, install the Ubuntu step by step.\nIn the step of partition, install program will report that it found a ATA-RAID device, you should chose \"use it\", then you will partition the hard-disk by manual, I use the full disk for / directory. You should note that, the disk device file is strange--/dev/md126p1, /dev/md126p2, /dev/md126p5...\nOK, you should go next, until you got the error \"install GRUB to disk\" step. Don't worry, just go through, and restart by DVD again.\nOnce you restart , you should enter the ubuntu command-line mode provided by the DVD.\nNow we start to install GRUB by our hand:\n# mount /dev/md126p1 /target\n\nIf you had partition the /home to a seperated partition, you should do next:\n# mount /dev/md126pX /target/home\n\n\"X\" is your partion dev number, you should know it from prev installation process.\n# mount -o bind /proc /target/proc\n# mount -o bind /sys /target/sys\n# mount --rbind /dev /target/dev\n\n（Now we do a chroot to the mount system.）\n     # chroot /target /bin/bash\n\n(Now create the file device.map, used by GRUB.）\n# echo \"(hd0) /dev/md126\" > /boot/device.map     \n\nNOTE THAT: use /dev/md126, NOT /dev/md126p1, it should the md126!\n# cp /boot/device.map /boot/grub/\n\nNow install grub\n# grub-install --root-directory=/ /dev/md126\n# grub-setup /dev/md126\n\n     # update-grub     grub\nIt will build the file: /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nDone.\nThe key process is echo \"(hd0) /dev/md126\" > /boot/device.map \nBecause the Ubuntu installation program use the /target partition /dev/md126p1 directory in grub-install, so it can't be done in a raid. The RAID MBR is not on the first partition /dev/md126p1,  but on the base devices file /dev/md126.\nI had tried weeks for this problem, finally win! Woo!\n\nA: Lenovo ThinkServer RD 330 Supports only SUSE, RHEL, and Windows OSs and unofficially supports Nix distros based on the former like CentOS 6.\nSadly, I wasn't here when this machine was purchased or we would have went with something more flexible.\n", "Q: No lock screen option for certain user I seem to have lost the lock screen option for one user of the system. It does not appear in the menu in the top right hand corner (with Log Out etc) and nor does Ctrl+Alt+L do anything despite being listed in the keyboard shortcuts of my system settings to lock screen. If I go to Brightness and Lock the lock area is just greyed out.\nThis facility is available to other users on the system so I'm not quite sure what the problem is. I should note that this particular user is not an admin user and does not have sudo privileges whereas the user is works for does (just in case that is important).\nI can't remember if I perhaps turned this facility off a long time ago for this user, but if so now I don't seem to be able to get it back.\nSome things I've tried:\n\nRemoved xscreensaver, re-installed gnome-screensaver (currently the newest version)\nSet gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled true\nI created a new test user with no admin privileges and for them the lock screen option was available.\n\n\nA: In the mean time I got some form of lock capability back by just purging gnome-screensaver reinstalling xscreensaver and adding a custom keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+Alt+L (after disabling the existing one in system) to launch the xscreensaver-command --lock command and lock my screen with that. I still don't have a Lock Screen in the drop down nor can I work out how I got rid of the original lock screen for this user.\n\nA: On my installation, the issue appeared when upgrading from 14.04 to 14.10\nFound the solution by looking at another question :\nScreen truns off when I lock, but doesn't lock. \"Lock\" settings grayed out\nI don't know why but the Unity Security option had disabled locking and user session on a non sudoer admin.

Since Switch tags a port with only single vlan ID. \nIf I convert the switch port to trunk mode, is there some way to tag virtual nic packets  with certain vlan ID?\nI just recently started using Ubuntu, I will much appreciate if answered in detail :)  \n\nA: *\n\n*Install the vlan package: apt-get install vlan or via software center.\n\n*Load the 8021q kernel module sudo modprobe 8021q.\n\n*Configure a vlan vconfig add eth0 2\nNow you can configure the interface like a normal one.

Try this:\n$ arch\nx86_64\n\nThat tells me I'm running 64-bit linux.  So I can choose to run either 32-bit mongo or 64-bit mongo.  If there were a \"32\" in there, I'd be running a 32-bit linux distro, and could only run 32-bit mongo atop it.\nNow, take all this with a grain of salt, as I personally use apt-get for practically everything except mongodb, which I manage several versions of concurrently.  \nSo, I find it simpler and more predictable to just go to the 10gen distributions page, and download and untar the version I want.  After that, executing the right bin/mongod just works right out of the box.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Recording Software for multiple input devices Does anyone know of any software that will allow me to record from multiple sound cards at once?\nI tried Audacity but they seem to only support one at a time.\n\nA: Your question sounds similar to this question but the previous one refers to a command line needs.

I realize now that many of my PPAs were automatically disabled (as it always happens) Now, the issue is that I can't re-enable them, the Software Sources GUI won't let me. I can un-check already checked PPAs but that's it.

How can that be done in fail2ban?\nA convincing argument against doing this says that it lets an attacker know whether or not a username is valid, and thus dramatically decreases the search space of a brute-force attack.\n\nI found your question while trying to do the same thing, but now I've changed my mind. Apart from the secrecy benefit, why save an attacker time by cutting them off early?\n\nA: I cannot help you with fail2ban, but I am using denyhosts quite successfully for exactly this thing.  You can tune quite a lot parameters and it also have a distributed database where you can send and receive other badhosts.\nHere's more detailed howto:\nInstall denyhosts package (sudo apt-get install denyhosts)\nLook at the default configuration in /etc/denyhosts.conf, you might be interested in DENY_TRESHOLD_INVALID, DENY_TRESHOLD_VALID and DENY_TRESHOLD_ROOT options.\nAs for the sync server it's disabled by default and you will need to enable it by uncommenting SYNC_SERVER option.\nIt's also not bad to set PURGE_DENY option to 1w or something like that in case you block-out yourself, so the entry will get purge after one week and you will be able to login again.\n\nA: Why not just deny all root logins entirely over SSH, rather than using Fail2Ban or other stuff?  By doing that, and denying the use of the root login, you remove the issue of having to block everyone, because even if they guess the root password, it'll deny them login.  Regardless of how many times they try.\nIn /etc/ssh/sshd_config, find the line containing PermitRootLogin.  Edit that with whatever text editor, but make sure you use sudo/gksudo (gksudo only if you're using a GUI text editor).

Please bare with me and help me out of this.\nAs the question states I am now feeling dizzy after struggling with my ubuntu machine from the last 4 days. I accept that should have posted a question here first, but being a windows user and newbie to Linux even to ask questions I lacked some understanding. Hence after one good week of struggle with linux and learning few things about it here I come to ask the question.\nSpecs\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux - Installed Ubuntu 12.10 (but says 13.04 in the about menu)\n\n*Machine - Dell PWS 450 Board - Intel chipset\n\n*Graphics Card - Nvidia quadro fx 1000 \n\n*RAM - 3 GB DDR \n\n*Dual monitors to support Stereoscopy (I work in my University Lab, where a machine has been given to me for testing the robotics software using Ubuntu)\n\n*Desktop environment - GNOME (sorry but Unity sucks for me)\n\n\nProblems\nVideo card problem - Login Screen, Blender and WebGL (not working fine)\nThough the installation of Ubuntu went like a charm but post install it was nothing but a lot of trouble all the while. The first problem I faced was the unity desktop with the login screen blank only with the wallpaper, mouse cursor, volume icon and power icon on the top. The users list was not visible at all. Adding to this the desktop was really slow, slow like hell. Hence removed Unity and installed GNOME which is much much better.\nThough randomly my problems arose and got fixed by the million commands on the terminal given by me after reading websites and solutions on askubuntu until I decided to seek the help of experts here to stabilize it once for all.  \nI am a Masters student, with a project on robotics. The robotics software requires Ubuntu to work. Hence switched to Ubuntu. Also I work on Webgl and Blender which is also part of my project. When I say blender, the models made by me are fairly simple enough to only test my code but still I need it. \nThough the machine was never performing at its best until yesterday when I installed the nvidia driver downloaded from the nvidia site itself. The link is here.\nWhen I ran the .run file it went smooth and I was very glad to even see the nvidia splash  screen show up before the login - WOW. The login screen worked fine.\nBut to my dismay webgl was not working(it was never working) and also blender stopped working(was working fine all the time). At this stage except webgl and blender everything else in the desktop was fine (login screen fixed, system was uber cool fast with gnome, etc., )\nNow I started the troubleshooting process to install webgl and fix the blender problem and eventually ended up screwing up the whole machine. Sorry to say but this is the truth. The truth is I had screwed up the video driver again when following the guidelines to fix the webgl and it blasted everything. I again tried to install the downloaded nvidia drivers but they refused to install because somehow my kernel was updated to 3.7 and had the driver now had problems. So degraded it to 3.5 and installed the drivers which was successful. Currently the state of my machine is \nThe problems now (solved the login problem temporarily by editing the /etc/gdm/custom.conf to do autologin)\n1 - Login screen - Has Mouse Cursor, Wallpaper, icons on the top but the users list is not visible and neither the buttons. And it looks blank.\n2 - Blender - Is now working fine\n3 - Webgl - Is not working neither with chrome or firefox\nI am glued to this machine from sterday without sleep, have not even gone home to have my food or anything else. My eyes are even refusing to open and to look at things clearly. So thought before I go into the REM mode will post this question so that souls out there can come to my aid.\n\nA: Friends,\nFixed the issue.\n1 - Did a clean re-install of ubuntu 12.10\nStarted with the login screen problem first, but now i am not an amateur anymore so handled it with nomodeset.\n2 - Unity was really slow. Yeah I know this so installed Gnome.\n3 - Installed the NVIDIA*.173.14.36.run downloaded from Nvidia drivers website.\nLost the login screen again. But still with my windows laptop lying nearby found out the solution that I have add the following \nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nThe above line was taken from the article here\nAfter adding it to the repository\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThe above fixed the problems\nNow I am able to see and configure both monitors in the nvidia settings panel. \nAlso with a minor tweak with firefox using about:config in the address bar of firefox and changed two settings after which the webgl started working like charm(but a bit slow, which I am least bothered about)\nwebgl.force_enabled = true\nwebgl.min_capability_mode = true\n\n(even if the above settings do not exist in your machine then add it yourself)\nInstalled blender works without any problems. Now I have left to do is install my robotic software from scratch again :-)\n", "Q: Why does pylint Gedit plugin give me an error when I try to enable it? I downloaded and installed the pylint gedit plugin. I then copied the pylint.gedit_plugin file and the pylint directory to \n/usr/lib/gedit/plugins\n\nI couldn't see it in the gedit plugins menu so I renamed pylint.gedit_plugin to pylint.plugin and changed the first line of the file from\n[Gedit Plugin]\n\nto\n[Plugin]\n\nNow I can see it in the menu. But when I select it, the red circle error icon appears and I cannot enable to plugin. What else do I need to do to use the plugin? Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: This is a good question, as it is sometimes tricky to setup the pylint plugin for gedit. The following tutorial was tested with gedit 3.4.1 on 12.04.\n1) The first thing you need to do is install pylint itself from the repositories, as without this program, the pylint plugin won't work. So please run:\nsudo apt-get install pylint \n\nThis is the necessary dependency and is not the plugin itself, and it should install as well python-logilab-common and python-logilab-astng, which are also necessary.\n2) You may be using the wrong version of the plugin. It is of foremost importance that you use the forked version of the pylint plugin from the Launchpad page, which is called gedit-pylint-2, as that supports gedit 3.x versions; other versions of the plugin will not work with gedit 3.x. (However, if you are using an earlier version of gedit than 3.x, you should use the 1.1 version of the pylint plugin from the Launchpad page.)\nDownload the latest version of the source: it does not need compiling, but it is important to follow my installation procedure, as parts of the included README in the download are inaccurate. (I recommend you start again and follow this guide, as it worked for me. You should not need to tweak or rename anything, as you say you are doing.)\nMove to the folder with the downloaded file (after checking the md5) and extract it with\ntar -xzvf gedit-pylint-2-2.1.tar.gz\ncd gedit-pylint-2-2.1\n\nNow, you can actually install it to ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins without placing it in any of the system directories. I should remove your installed version, and install it again as detailed below, as I think you had the wrong version anyway: the plugin name must be pylint-2.plugin, not pylint.gedit_plugin.\nWhile in the downloaded plugin folder, run the following:\nmkdir -p ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins\ncp -R pylint-2/ ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins\ncp pylint-2.plugin ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins\n\nNow, you need to install the gsettings schemas, before you try to activate the plugin in gedit. (The included README is accurate here). \nIndeed, this is probably why you could not activate the plugin properly, as you must install the schemas. (The following commands assume you are in the downloaded plugin folder)\nsudo cp gedit-pylint-2.gschema.xml /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/\nsudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/\n\nNow, run gedit and enable the plugin from edit > preferences > plugins (screenshot 1), and you will be able to use it from tools > pylint (screenshot 2). Make sure you have the bottom panel enabled, as that is where the output from the plugin will go (screenshot 3).\n1) Enable the plugin from preferences:\n\n2) It should be listed in the tools menu:\n\n3) You can now analyse your python scripts: note the bottom pane is enabled. Click 'check' in the bottom pain to run the plugin. \n\n", "Q: Why when I disabled bluetooth from startup applications does it still run on boot? I saw Bluetooth in startup applications and disabled it, but the process is still run when I boot the system.\nEdit 1\ni disabled it via BUM, and still appear in bootchart, look at this  https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwS0_GGz-wuDYkc5S2p2Y1JyYnM/edit?usp=sharing and most of services that i disabled via BUM \nEdit 2\nI uninstalled it before via ubuntu software center, but reinstalled automatically when update system\n\nA: That is because of its damon\nyou can remove it from runway to forbid it to be executed\none of the graphical ways is using BootUp-manager (\"bum\") program you can install it from ubuntu software center. it's easy to use or if you don't use it at all just uninstall it\n", "Q: How do I change the options that appear in the generated Grub 0.97 menu.lst file? I'm working on systems that have 10.04.3 installed as an upgrade from 8.04. So these systems have Grub 0.97 installed.\nI want to get verbose console output during startup, so I want to eliminate the \"quiet\" option being passed to the kernel by the generated Grub menu options. I see there's a commented option in the /boot/grub/menu.lst file:\n## additional options to use with the default boot option, but not with the\n## alternatives\n## e.g. defoptions=vga=791 resume=/dev/hda5\n# defoptions=quiet splash\n\nI know edits to the menu.lst would be lost upon the next 'update-grub'. So where, or what, do I set so that a subsequent 'update-grub' invocation will build the menu.lst file the way I want?\nI have some newer systems (10.04 and 12.04 clean installs) that have an /etc/default/grub file, but my Grub 0.97 systems don't have that file. Could I just create it and add\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\"\n\nto get what I want (no \"quiet\" arg to the kernels) in menu.lst?\n\nA: ...turns out that for Grub 0.97 (ie Grub legacy) you just edit the config file in place. So I went into '/boot/grub/menu.lst' and changed the\n# defoptions=quiet splash\n\nto\n# defoptions=splash\n\nand then ran 'update-grub'.\nYes, the 'defoptions' line is a comment in the menu.lst file. After update-grub all my kernel boot options no longer had the 'quiet' argument.\n\nA: Use grub-customizer, it is a GUI tool to edit list configuration, timeout and appearance settings\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\n", "Q: Why won't my netbook read by USB drive? I have a problem installing Ubuntu via USB storage using unetbootin:\nMy notebook BIOS does not read the USB key, instead of another notebook that I tried that does.\nI think the problem is that USB ports are not active because if I go in BIOS settings in the page in which I can set what device is ran first, the bios does not show me the name of the USB drive, instead of the other notebook that does.\n\nA: Are you shure, that your BIOS supports booting from USB?\nIf your BIOS does not list USB, make shure you pluged in your device BEFORE starting your laptop.\nDo you have UEFI? Maybe this is your problem.\nMaybe this site will help you.\nEDIT:\nMaybe you have to activate your USB device in the BIOS, search for \"Inegrated Peripherals\"\n\nA: Maybe that computer doesn't like the way your software boots [I've had that problem before] there's a lot of good software for booting Linux from USB at pendrivelinux.com [all free!]\n\nA: Look for something called USB Legacy Support in the BIOS or similar. Enabling that should allow the machine to pretend the USB key is a hard drive and boot from it. Ubuntu should take over from there. \n", "Q: Where to configure syndaemon settings? Where do I configure syndaemon default parameters?\nBy default it is called with\n\n -i 2.0 -K -R -t\n\n.\nI have a script that re-runs it with parameters that I need, but how do I do this properly?\nI am on ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: As Rinzwind already pointed out, these settings are hardcoded in unity-settings-daemon:\nhttps://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/vivid/unity-settings-daemon/vivid/view/head:/plugins/mouse/gsd-mouse-manager.c\nAs a workaround, rename syndaemon to syndaemon.orig\nmv /usr/bin/syndaemon /usr/bin/syndaemon.orig\n\nand create a script syndaemon that just calls the original binary with the correct parameters:\ncat << EOF > /usr/bin/syndaemon\n#!/bin/bash\n/usr/bin/syndaemon.orig -K -R -i0.5\nEOF\n\nMake it executable with\nchmod +x /usr/bin/syndaemon\n\n\nA: Dash -> Startup Applications\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Add\n\n*Give it a name and put the command in for the script you need:\n\n\n\nReason for this ... there is not config file and those settings are hard coded.\n\nA: For those using Xubuntu:\nhttp://www.computercorrect.com/2012/operating-systems/linux/xubuntu/configure-disable-touchpad-while-typing-delay/\nI've found that making it half a second delay works well for me.

I've recently installed and started using htop instead of the System Monitor included in default Ubuntu installations and I noticed something weird.  I arranged htop to display the processes by memory usage and noticed I have 9 instances of GNOME-Shell running, all with different PID's.  \nIs this normal for GNOME?  I never noticed it before on other Ubuntu installs, but to be fair I've never looked either.  \n\nA: They are probably threads. Are they consecutive PIDs, and show up in branches under one gnome-shell process when you run ps fx|grep gnome-shell?\nThis is quite common when a process fork/execs or uses multiple threads.\n", "Q: Don't really want a Web Dev version of Ubuntu I got this version of Ubuntu v12.10 desktop (AMD64) online, burned it to disc back on 2013-01-30, and finally got around to installing it alongside Windows 7 Pro x64 on this box.  I haven't even checked to see if it dueal boots as expected...  Here's the problem and it may or may not actually be a problem.  This installation booted up as \"Ubuntu Studio\" and at first glance seems tailored for Web developers or other types far more artistically inclined than I am.\nIf \"Ubuntu Studio\" is meant to be similar to \"Visual Studio\" in connotation, a programmer's environment, I can deal with it.. If it is a Web developer's platform it will mean a lot of work deleting crap I don't want or need and installing a version of 12.10 that actually is loaded with programmer's tools.\nWhat I'd really like to do is completely uninstall this thing and make sure Windows7 Pro still boots and performs as it did yesterday, then install a cleaner, more useful-to-me version of Ubuntu.\nSo far, I'm liking the look of the UI of this version of Ubuntu...the last one I used much was v10.4, I think.\nAnyway, is there a way to, and should I bother to, install a more software development oriented edition of Ubuntu on this machine without hosing it in the process?  In my experience, uninstall routines are often disastrously buggy.  I do have the option to just wipe the 256GB SSD and restore it from the RAID1 virtual drive I use for backup and long-term storage.  I'm hoping someone has a better solution to what may be a non-problem.\n[Added a few minutes later...]  I'm gonna figure out how to keep this desktop's appearance...too much orange gets on my nerves, but light grays and blues are easy on tired eyes. \n\nA: Ubuntu Studio is just tuned more for multimedia editing and stuff, if you need a development platform for web dev or similar, you're better off starting from scratch.\nFormat your Ubuntu partitions, and then install normal Ubuntu, and install web development software, or whatever software you need, as you need it.\n(answer shamelessly stolen from @Rinzwind's comments on the question :P)\n", "Q: How to find ghostscript files in ubuntu? I'm working with the terminal and im trying to find ghostscript files in all the computer. How can I do that? I know that I must use the comand \"find\", but is there anything else I should type?\n\nA: If you want results that include recently created files, try this:\nfind / -type f -name \\*.gs\n\nHowever, if you want an answer quickly, instead of find try locate, which uses a database of files that is updated every night or every week\nlocate *.gs\n\n\nA: Ghostscript files tend to have an extension .ps. You can find files ending in .ps with...\nsudo find / -name *.ps -print \n\nYou will need sudo if you want to search the whole disc. If you want to put the result into a text file you can append > results.txt after that command.\nIf you know more about the file name you can change the * to search for that.\nExamples:\n$sudo find / -name *.ps -print\n/usr/share/ghostscript/9.06/Resource/Init/gs_cidfm.ps\n/usr/share/ghostscript/9.06/Resource/Init/gs_cet.ps\n/usr/share/ghostscript/9.06/Resource/Init/gs_mro_e.ps\n/usr/share/ghostscript/9.06/Resource/Init/gs_cmap.ps\n/usr/share/ghostscript/9.06/Resource/Init/gs_std_e.ps\n/usr/share/ghostscript/9.06/Resource/Init/gs_agl.ps\n/usr/share/ghostscript/9.06/Resource/Init/gs_dps2.ps\n/usr/share/ghostscript/9.06/Resource/Init/gs_cidtt.ps\n/usr/share/ghostscript/9.06/Resource/Init/gs_dpnxt.ps\n/usr/share/ghostscript/9.06/Resource/Init/gs_diskn.ps\n\n", "Q: access to data via LiveCD I have a problem with my Ubuntu 12.04. After one of the updates I could not boot successfully. There was apparently some graphical problem. A message popped up with four options to choose but I could not select anything: pressing the arrow keys or Enter had no effect.\nNow, I want to make a fresh install but before that I need to get some of the data on my hard disk. How can I do that? I tried by using the LiveCD but I got a message saying I had no permission to access the home folder. I expected that at least I get a chance to enter my password somewhere in order to identify my self, but no. As I was installing Ubuntu, I encrypted my home folder (still have the passphrase). May be that is important. Does anyone know a way how to get to my data? Perhaps not through the LiveCD but by somehow booting without a GUI, just with a terminal because of the graphics problem. I guess that would be sufficient to copy the data I need on a USB stick.\n\nA: You can access encrypted data from a live cd but it requires some extra steps...\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the disc\n\n*Execute sudo ecryptfs-recover-private from a terminal session and answer the questions.

I reverted to a pre-loaded theme but I think some of the dependency GnomishDark applied may be the problem.  \nHowever, whenever I go to uninstall it with sudo apt-get remove GnomishDark I am getting this: E: unable to locate package GnomishDark.\nIf I do cd /usr/share/themes and then ls, the theme is present and listed as GnomishDark.\nAm I doing something wrong?\n\nA: That is normal, because GnomishDark is not a package that can be removed with the apt-get command.\nWhen you install a theme, you are just putting the files into the appropriate folder. So all you need to do is remove the GnomishDark folder (and its subfolders). You can do this as described below:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have the theme in the /usr/share/themes directory, enter:\nsudo rm -r /usr/share/themes/NAME_OF_THEME_FOLDER\n\n*If you have the theme in the ~/.themes directory, enter:\nsudo rm -r ~/.themes/NAME_OF_THEME_FOLDER\n-r is for recursive and tells rm to remove the parent folder as well as subfolders.\n"]
