["Q: How can I update 12.04 without update manager? \nPossible Duplicate:\nUnable to use package manager due to “exclusive lock” error \n\nWhen I try to update Ubuntu - I know that I have 233 updates - I get this message every time:\nUnable to get exclusive lock\n\nThis usually means that another package management application (like apt-get or aptitude) already running. \nPlease close that application first.\n\nAnd I don't find this application.\n\nA: It means there are other package management applications currently running e.g. Software Center, Synaptic, apt-get. \nTo make sure no other packaging management applications are running, open the terminal and run:\nsudo killall -9 apt-get\n\nthen do another update by running:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf the problem persist, it's because the lock file still exist. You need to delete it by running this in the terminal:\nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock\n\nNow try to update or upgrade again.\n\nA: Its mostly because software center, or synaptic or the two you mentioned are running. If you don't see any of those running, try restarting your PC and try to update it it. But the terminal way to update it is\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: Running sudo apt-get update will update the package lists (what packages can be updated, new packages etc), so you want to run that to find out what can be updated, and sudo apt-get upgrade to action the updates.\nAn all-in-one command for updating from the terminal:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: How to install 12.04 on Samsung Series 5 Ultrabook? A few days ago, I bought this laptop, and now I want to change its OS (Windows 7) to Ubuntu but failed.\nI burn it to a USB stick, set BIOS to startup from USB and it worked. I followed the install steps to install Ubuntu, it was a success. But when I restart the computer after installation, it's not working, it'll be continual reboot at start up until I shutdown or let it start up from USB stick.\nCan anybody to tell me this is why? Please help me to resolve it.\n\nA: It might be because you installed GRUB on a partition. To resolve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the Live USB.\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T).\n\n*Run the following commands:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\nHere, /dev/sda is the name of the harddrive. To check the name of the harddrive, run sudo fdisk -l.\n\nIn the screenshot, the devices /dev/sda1, etc are the partitions, whereas /dev/sda is the harddrive.\n", "Q: Is there any way to recover my sudo power? \nPossible Duplicate:\nRegain Sudo rights after removing from admin group \n\nI created a new user and changed the ssh config. I forgot to add root permission to the newly created user. \nNow I need to undo my changes in ssh config. Is that possible without any sudo command?\n\nA: No. Can't you log in as the admin user (who was created at installation time)? If yes, log in and add the new user to the sudo group, where's the problem?\nIf no, do you have physical access to the machine? If yes, boot from a Ubuntu CD, mount your harddrive and add the user to the group manually. For example, assuming that /dev/sdb1 is the partition on your hard drive that is mounted as root (/), then after booting the live CD, do:\nsudo -i\nmount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\ncd /mnt/etc\nnano group\n\n(yeah, you can do that all from a GUI as well)\nA simple text editor opens. Search for the line starting with \"sudo\". It may look something like this:\nsudo:x:27:oldadmin\n\nAssuming that oldadmin is the user name of the admin. If the new user's login name is newuser, modify that line to\nsudo:x:27:oldadmin,newuser\n\nsave the file and reboot the computer. The newuser should have now the privilege to run sudo.\nIf you do not have physical access to the machine, you lost your administrative password and the root is not permitted to log in, then you have a problem, sir.\n", "Q: Unable to install Ubuntu on Asus EeePC1011CX: BIOS not listing bootable USBs I had been trying to install Ubuntu 12.4LTS on my netbook Eee PC 1011CX with preloaded Windows7. \n\n\n*\n\n*I successfully created a bootable USB stick (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows) following pendrivelinux.com\n\n*Then with Esc key at powering up, I could pick the bootable USB and load Ubuntu successfully. Ubuntu loads, so far so good. Now I decide to install it \"within win7\" dual boot. \nNow here is the issue: \n\n*With Esc key, I could see that there are three devices listed to pick: (1) The main SAT drive, (2) Generic USB 0.0, (3) UEFI generic USB 0.0 -- out of these three, options (1) and (3) load Win7, and (2) is what loads Ubuntu. \n\n*But when I get into BIOS using F2 key to change the boot order, I see only device options (1) and (3) listed there. Option (2) \"Generic USB 0.0\" is missing. \n\n*So: the system cannot reboot into Ubuntu during installation process and the process is terminated every time the system restarts. Installation doesn't proceed even if I manually pick to install using Esc key. \nIs there anyway to ask BIOS to show the generic USB option? I have tested the USB on another machine, and also I have tried doing the same procedure using an ext.HDD only to see the same trend. \n\n\nPlease advice. \nThanks. \n\nA: What is the exact option you are choosing Install ubuntu alongside Windows or Within Windows? Because within windows means wubi installation. If you are booting via usb it should not be wubi install.\nFor Dual boot:\nNo nothing can be done from ubuntu side to make BIOS understand the USB. Possibly a firmware bug in vendors firmware. See if there are any BIOS update available.\nIf updating BIOS / No update is there for BIOS. I would recommend to manually resize windows 7 disk and create partition for ubuntu and install ubuntu into it. In this method you don't need to reboot until installation is finished. \nHere is a guide. There are many in internet and this site.\n\nA: Plug in your bootable pendrive \nGo to your bios by presssing F2\nGo to last option tab in BIOS where you will find list of bootable pendrive\n ( I dont know tab name(other than boot option) but one of the tab will list the bootable device attached)\n", "Q: How do I secure my SSH access? So I have a VPS, and I have no idea how to administer it. I understand one of the first things to do is secure it, and the first concrete step in that direction I've found so far is in moshen's comment:\nAlso, you should secure your SSH access as soon as possible. I recommend changing the default port, using key-based authentication and disabling password authentication and root logins (basically create a standard user account for you to log in with)\n\nSo far, all I know how to do is use my VPS provider's web interface to open a console with root access. So how do I follow moshen's advice?\n\nA: \nSo I have a VPS, and I have no idea how to administer it.\n\nThat's the single biggest argument for managed hosting I've ever seen. Hacked servers are responsible for a large portion of the nonsense that makes the internet a bad place. Hosting phishing pages, spreading malware. If you're going to do this, I hope you do it properly.\nTo give you some sort of idea of the long term undertaking, I'd read through this: What Can Be Done To Secure Ubuntu Server? There are other questions like it on the site (dozens) with good answers but this one has some nice vast answers.\nFor SSH, I've been over all of these in long-form on my blog but the key points are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move it to another port. Something high, in the 10,000-60,000 range.\n\n*Install fail2ban.\n\n*Use key based authentication.\n\n*Disable password authentication.\n\n*Disable root login (make sure your user is in the admin group).\n\n*Make sure your user doesn't have a guessable name (eg admin).\n\n\nJust moving the port will deflect 99.99% of drive-by hacking attempts. fail2ban will stop any brute attempts from being viable. Forcing key-based auth means the number of guesses a brute would take is now in the range of billions of billions. Disabling root login and having a harder-to-guess username means they don't even have a username with which to start bruting: they have to brute for the username before they even get to the password element.\nThis results in a fairly secure SSH server. There would have to be a pretty horrific exploit in it for people to get through it... But don't put all your focus on making the door as impenetrable as possible and then ignoring the open window.\n\n\n*\n\n*Web applications (of all dynamic languages) are hackable. If you're using open source scripts, you need to keep on top of their updates.\n\n*A firewall should be stopping people getting to services that shouldn't be exposed to the internet (MySQL for example).\n\n*Otherwise secure services will let people right in if you're not applying patches to them (and restarting them after patching).\n\n\nA: For start what you actually only need to do is add your user,\nby typing in:\nadduser username\nusermod -a -G sudo username\n\nAfter you supply your password and other data you can login into your server as user using ssħ username@yourserverip. You can still run root commands using sudo for ex.\nsudo apt-get install something\nI recommend making root password strong using command:\npasswd\n...as root which will issue password changing.\nThere's no need to change ssh port if you have strong passwords, ssh is secure enough and it's totally ok to run it on default port. Ssh will be the last thing hackers will hack if that would be the case.\n\nA: To change sshd settings open /etc/ssh/sshd_config file change file as you need. To change the port search fort Port 22 line and change the 22 to another value for example  4530.\nSo when you connect to your server via ssh you have to use ssh user@host -p 4530\nDisable root login change PermitRootLogin yes to PermitRootLogin no\nMost of the time key based authentication is enabled by default but make sure it is enabled PubkeyAuthentication yes.\nBefore disabling the password authentication create a ssh key for you using ssh-keygen if you haven't before and add it to your VPS user account. usually ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nFirst check your keybased authentication is working and then disable the password authentication - PasswordAuthentication yes\nThen install a tool like denyhosts to block IPs from accessing sshd.\n", "Q: Dual boot with encrypted Windows partition I tried to make the Windows option on GRUB boot menu the default by following the instructions I found on the internet. The instructions were good, graceful but since I encrypted the Windows partition after I installed Ubuntu, the graceful approach didn't work for me when I did update-grub. The option simply disappeared because decryption does not work under Ubuntu.\nI found on the Internet some codes for grub.conf to restore Windows startup. It was successful but there is an error message after I select the Windows option. \nI wonder whether update-grub automatically backs up a copy of grub.conf or any other config files it changes? If so, I can probably retrieve that config and get rid of the error message.\nI didn't mean to encrypt, it's a company PC and encryption of Windows partition is mandatory. I do not want to decrypt the Windows partition, fix GRUB and encrypt again - it simply takes too much time.\n\nA: Try installing Windows Bootloader on another partition then chainload from GRUB then from there boot into Windows.\n", "Q: Is this external drive (verbatim 47564 320gb) recognized by Linux?

(This support is in the Linux kernel itself from v2.4, so any distribution from the past decade or so will support it.)\nIf you want to be able to read and write files to the same filesystem under both Windows and Linux, you should format it as NTFS.\n", "Q: remmina server & remmina client I am a total beginner. I am totally frustrated in partial answers and I am unable to understand and the alphabet soup. The answers just confuse me. The instructions say to do this, but I have no idea how to do this. What fits in each of the required setup fields? How do I find out the correct format and data that each field requires? There is nothing I have been able to find that explains the basics of setting up remmina between two computers over the internet where the IPv4 addresses are known. Is the connection secure (encrypted en-route)? Where is the server to be located or is the client also the server? Any assistance would be helpful.\nThe two computers are Ubuntu 12.04 32 located in Argentina and Ubuntu 12.04 AMD64 located in the States (both are in America).\nMy first problem starts under 'Profile':\n'Name' May anything may go here?\n'Group' Since there will be only the two ends, does Group require an entry?\n'Protocol' Which would be best and which would be default supported by both ends?\n'Basic' That should be the computer in the States, but what name should apply and in what format? Does it require a domain name or will an IP address suffice?\n'Advanced' Seems the server must initiate the contact as 'Client name' 'Startup program' 'Startup path' fields are requested. What goes in each field and in what format?\n'SSH' tunnel? Does that require a separate setup or is that built into either or both the server and client? Where is the server? and How do I get it? or Is it built into the client? What is the server-client relationship? or Are they interchangeable?\n\nA: Good answers to your questions fill whole bookshelves.\nBut, it is quite easy to set up an rdp connection...\nI try to answer some of those questions and leading you in the right direction:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to know formats for things, like you know formats for Date, currency and temperature in your Country. At least I hope you do or know how to ask Wikipedia for the correct format.\n\n*You should use an RDP or VNC Connection. RDP should work out of the box, while VNC needs an extra VNC-Server Software on the machine you want to connect to.\n\n*Relation: You have an RDP Client which loggs into another machine over network and sends back the Desktop, giving you the ability to interact with it from a distance.\n\n*Profile Name ist the name of your connection Profil. Just choose a remarkable Name for your connection (I always use the name of the machine I connect to in the profile, but that is for you to choose.).\n\n*Server Name: IP or Hostname of the Machine you want to connect to. ipv4 Ips have the format 000.000.000.000, where minimum is 0.0.0.0 and max is 255.255.255.255, Read an Article about TCP/IP if you are interestes in how this IP thingy works.\n\n*User Name: Set the Username from an active user on the machine you want to connect to. Remeber the relation. All you do is connectiong to another machine with user Credentials.\n\n*Passwort: read the last paragraph and guess for urself.\n\n*Advanced: is for advanced users, if you are not an advanced user (if you do not know, you are not!) just do not touch the settings. Maybe you want to adjust the Quality of tansmitted Desktop pictures to higher Quality, if you have a fast Internet connection.\n\n*In the end: you need to reach the machine you want to connect to. Since I cannot know how your networks are build, I cannot help you with that. I just want to point out that you might need some port forwarding at your remote machines network router (remote machine is the machine you want to connect to), so the connecting client can reach the remote Desktop.\n", "Q: Can't install windows I try to boot from the Windows XP disc and it wont let me, it says there is no Harddrive, when i do have a hard drive. I just want to uninstall ubuntu and get windows.\n\nA: Whilst installing Ubuntu the hard disk was formatted as Ext4, and windows does not recognise Ext4 or your hard disk.   \nYou need to format the disk using a file system that windows recognises such as NTFS or FAT.   \nThe simplest solution is to boot your computer using the Ubuntu live install disc,\n select Try Ubuntu,\nand then use Disc Utility or Gparted to format the hard disc as NTFS or FAT.      \nOnce that is done windows will recognise the disc and allow you to install windows XP.\n", "Q: My Ubuntu 12.04 LTS slowed down My Ubuntu 12.04 LTS worked fine for few months after I installed it.\nBut it has now slowed down considerably.

Any ideas please?\n\nA: It might be because you have a low amount of RAM. And I believe LibreOffice does take a good junk of RAM, so upgrading RAM might help (4 GB should be fine) Also Use Startup Applications to check what useless applications are running when you turn on computer.\n\nA: There can be many factors responsible for this.\nOne of them is installing more packages. As you install more and more packages, the computer slows because they might have their daemons which take memory and hence slow down your computer.\nIf there is a process which is taking more memory, you can fix the problem using the commands given in the answer to this question: Ubuntu slows down over time?.\n", "Q: Changes made in gconf-editor have no effect I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with Gnome 3.4.2.

I'm looking for a feed reader that has both: web-interface and a standalone client for the dektop. Like that, I could read my feeds from every omputer with an internet connection and from my PC even if I'm currently offline. Both interfaces should sync.\nI'm know there are Google Reader clients (at least one) but I don't want to rely on a company to host the common database and the web-interface. I'd like the server part to be open-source, too.\nIs there something like this out there?\n\nA: Edit: I've just read your second paragraph. You could always build something on your own steam but you'll won't have the same level of integration and convenience as Google Reader unless you spend a very long time on this. Ultimately I think you have to settle for just a web interface and a browser on the desktop.\nAnd out of all of the self-hosted solutions, unless able to build something perfect for your requirement, Fever looks like the best client (albeit at $30). It's all a bit Apple-flavoured but there you go.\nIf that's too rich, Tiny Tiny RSS might hit the bill. Oh and apparently they have an Android client in beta. You'll still be limited to the web interface on the desktop and it's not the prettiest (neither is Google Reader in all honesty) but worse things have happened at sea.\nEdit 2: I've just read your first paragraph (yeah I'm doing things backwards today). If you want proper offline sync, I think it's possible that you want to be running this server on your computer, not an external server. For external access you'd need to expose it to the internet (port forwarding plus something like dyndns or similar). That's the only way I can possibly see you getting something even remotely like this.\n\nI've recently moved from just using Liferea to:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Google Reader account (web access)\n\n*Lightread (the new app from the recent app competition)\n\n*The Google Reader app on my phone.\n\n\nNow I can be made angry by news whereever I am and it's all in sync.\n\nA: Take a look at FeedStore (for google chrome).\n\nA: I now found a rather good solution: Using TinyTinyRss on the server (backend and web interface) and Liferea on the desktop.

I am experiencing some serious performance issues with my Ubuntu 12.04 setup and thus looking for the culprit by running htop alongside my usual tasks.\nAside from the usual suspects like chromium, compiz and conky, I noticed this process:\n/usr/bin/X :0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -nolisten tcp vt7 -novtswitch -background none\nNot only is it running constantly, but it's also one of the main ressource hogs in the process list, both in regards of cpu usage as well as memory consumption.\nIt's the number one performance eater most of the time, only topped from time to time by an especially ressource-hungry task like flash player or the like.\nJudging by the name, I'm totally unsure what it does. X and lightdm seem to indicate a relation to the gui while tcp seems network related.\nMy question(s): is this process supposed to run all the time? Is it legit that it uses this much ressources? Do I need it to run or is it safe to kill, if so, how to?\nFYI: My system is completely up-to-date, I'm even using the xorg-edgers ppa for the very latest nvidia drivers and compiz-packages (for specific bug-related reasons).\nAny suggestions would be very much appreciated.\n\nA: This is the system graphics server and should not be killed. It converts the layout of desktop applications into low-level drawing operations on your graphics card, and routes keyboard and mouse input to the correct application that should receive them.\nThe reference to LightDM is that this is the first client it starts (the Ubuntu login screen); the reference to tcp is because X is designed to be network-transparent - it can work quite happily with input devices, applications and display devices all running on different computers. (I think that in Ubuntu it is configured not to accept network connections, only those coming through SSH, but may be wrong).\nCheck the statistics you are using are for X itself rather than X and children, since the children include all applications you run in a graphical environment. Excess resource usage by X itself is usually down to misbehaving desktop applications, but this can be very hard to debug.\n\nA: That's the X server. That's the graphical interface of which all other graphical applications are clients to.\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes it's supposed to run all the time.\n\n*LightDM is just the login manager that loads first\n\n*Using a lot of resources is usually a sign that X is either struggling with a crappy driver or that there's a crappy application (historically usually Compiz) trying to push a driver too hard.\n\n*Using xorg-edgers is a good way to run crappy untested software.

Hi :) I'm comfortable with Xubuntu 12.04 because I have an older computer, but I was reading about the LTS support:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04: Supported until april 2017.\n\n*Xubuntu 12.04: Supported until april 2015.\n\n\nI want a 5 years support, then my question is: Will be those 3 years support just for XFCE packages or for all packages? I want ask: After 3 years, will Xubuntu have updates for packages as Firefox, LibreOffice, kernel...? \nIf the answer is no (I suppose it), I could change the 'apt' repositories, from 'xubuntu' to 'ubuntu'. How do you see this solution?\n\nA: The core aspects of Ubuntu get full support for the full period. That includes kernels, pre-installed applications. You should be fine with Firefox updates. It's the XFCE stuff that will start to lag behind.\nThe repositories for Xubuntu and Ubuntu are the same — it's just a different selection of packages. If you want full Xubuntu support indefinitely you either need to upgrade in a timely manner or maintain (or pay somebody else to maintain) all the packages you need indefinitely.\n", "Q: Xmonad and panels in gnome-shell I run 12.04 with gnome-shell (so it looks like Gnome 2 with horizontal panels on the top and the bottom of the screen) with Xmonad. \nWhat I want to do is create a keybinding that would toggle these panels, basically switching applications on the screen to fullscreen and back. \nCan anyone tell me what should I write in xmonad.hs in order to achieve it? (I'm totally innocent of Haskell, unfortunately.)\n\nA: Assuming you've setup your XMonad using gnomeConfig then the panels should be handled as struts.\nIn your xmonad.hs you then want to use the ManageDocks module.\nThe docs page provides the steps necessary to enable it but it surmounts to modifying your manageHook and layoutHook as follows:\nimport XMonad.Hooks.ManageDocks\n...\nmanageHook = ... <+> manageDocks\n...\nlayoutHook = avoidStruts (tall ||| mirror tall ||| ...)\n        where tall = ResizableTall 1 (3/100) (1/2)\n...\n\nThere already exists a key binding in XMonad to toggle struts: Mod+b is the default.

I want to install Guest Additions in a virtual Windows 7 running inside Ubuntu.  The VirtualBox instructions are:\n\nIn the \"Devices\" menu in the virtual machine's menu bar, VirtualBox\n  has a handy menu item named \"Install guest additions\", which mounts\n  the Guest Additions ISO file inside your virtual machine. A Windows\n  guest should then automatically start the Guest Additions installer,\n  which installs the Guest Additions into your Windows guest.\n\nHow do I get to the \"Devices\" menu in the virtual machine's menu bar?\n\n\n\nA: Right There, Third Menu option.Click it a drop down menu will appear, the last Option is to Install Guest Additions.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you boot into Windows Press Host+D (Host is usually the right\nControl key). That will mount the Vbox Guest Additions ISO into Windows and the autorun prompt will appear.\n\n\n\n\nA: When you boot into Windows press Host+Home (Host is usually the right Control key).\n\nA: You have Scale Mode enabled. Disable it (Right-CTRL + C) and you will see the Devices Menu for your VM. You can then install the Guest Additions\n\nA: There are a couple of ways to run a VirtualBox VM in Ubuntu, the most used is windowed mode, when using it the Virtual Machine is inside a window, it looks like this:\n\nThe menu should be in the same place that other windows. Bellow the title, or if you are using unity, it will appear when you hover over the bar that is located at the top of the screen.\nI believe that you could be running it on seamless mode. In this mode the virtual machine will try to mend with the Ubuntu desktop and it doesn't has its own window.\nIf this is your situation you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the mouse to the middle bottom of the windows taskbar, try to put it as low as possible. Let it hold there for a second or two. A new menu bar should appear.\n\n*Hit CTRL+L while you have windows selected, this should change it to above mode (in a window), you should then be able to access the menu in the normal way.\n\n\nA: I had the same issue....beating my head against the wall.  Once the Win7 device is and you log in, go to My Computer and open the CDROM...the iso will be there.  Run the installer and reboot.  You'll be good to go.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem when I tried to install the guest additions. My case is installing a win& virtual machine in OS. Finally I realized, at least in my case, you have to make the virtual machine window to be full screen, then move  your cursor to the top of the screen, then the hidden menu bar appeared!!!! Then Device is there, you can just install the guest additions as other tutorials said. \nHops this can help!\n\nA: The best answer I found is to create the shortcut yourself.\nGo to the VirutalBox Manager and select File > Preferences.\nPreference Window pops up, select \"input\" from the menu on the left AND Virtual Machine (not Virtual Manager) from the top of the \"input\" window that appears.\nScroll down to \"Insert Guest Additions CD image...\" and create a shortcut.\nI use Ctrl-Ins (to insert the CD).\nSave and Run the VM Guest and hit Ctrl-Ins (vola, CD image is mounted).\n", "Q: repair broken packages-\"dpkg: error: conflicting actions -f (--field) and -r (--remove)\" Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. if more information will be needed, tell me and'll give.\nthe main problem is:\ntzach@tzach-pc:~$ sudo apt-get install docky\n[sudo] password for tzach: \nReading package lists...

I have a Toshiba Satellite Intel centrino duo laptop running ubuntu 12.04\nWhat files are responsible for the keyboard working / Where are the keyboard drivers located?\nSay hypothetically the caps lock light doesn't light up and pressing a key does nothing and I needed to install \"drivers\" to get it working... where would those drivers go?\n/lib/modules ?\n/proc ?\nWhere?\n\nA: From what i've read you have 2 situations, where keyboard is handled by some kernel module, and if you install XORG server, for example, it can be also handled by it.\nSo with the kernel drivers, they should be in something like:\n/lib/modules/2.6.2x.xx/kernel/drivers/input/keyboard/\nFor XORG:\n/usr/lib/xorg/modules/input/kbd_drv.so\n", "Q: Difference between Update Manager and apt-get dist-upgrade Is the Update Manager (or Software Updater) the frontend of apt-get dist-upgrade?\n\nA: In a way yes. However the Update Manager combines a lot of apt-get commands that may depend on your update settings.\n\nYou can have a better understanding of apt-get options if you read the AptGet/Howto.Then you can figure out which GUI option correspond to which apt-get command.\n\nA: Update-manager is essentially a GUI frontend for apt, which includes apt-get update, upgrade, and dist-upgrade functionality.  Using the Update Manager is more convenient than using apt-get dist-upgrade, because using this command to upgrade to a new version of your distribution requires the modification of configuration files.  There is less room for error using the Update Manager than using apt-get dist-upgrade.\ndo-release-upgrade is a command line tool similar to the Update Manager, which also does not require modification of apt configuration files.\n\nA: Strictly, Update Manager, Software Centre and the apt suite (apt-get and apt-cache) are all front-ends to dpkg so anything that can be done with one can done with the others, but it is usually much easier to use the GUI tools which will also handle editing the config files automaically.\nNote that the only dpkg command that most people use directly is dpkg --configure -a to fix things up when an install fails.\n", "Q: System blacks out when resuming on opening lid It is happening now and then but frequently these days.

The downside to encrypting the entire device is that TC must already be installed on the OS in order to use the TC device. Because of that, I format the device as FAT32 so that both Win and Linux can easily read it, then put a TC container/file on the device, along with copies of both the Windows and Linux executables for TC stored on the device (not in the encrypted container). You can then launch the appropriate TC executable that is on the device from any OS, and use the GUI to open the encrypted container. When you connect it to your own computer that already has TC installed, just ignore the TC executable on the device (cuz your TC GUI should have already launched.)\n", "Q: Alt+F2 set to \"Activities\" view in GNOME Shell, can't access the command prompt anymore Today I discovered that my gnome-shell doesn't let me run commands using Alt+F2 anymore.

If you install Ubuntu with Wubi there is huge performance drop. I recommend installing native Ubuntu(Not with Wubi).\n\nA: I had the same problem.  To fix it, switch from Wubi to a native installation.\nTo see what's going on, open a terminal shell (Ctrl+Alt+t) and run top (type top and press Enter).  This will give you a live display of what's using the system resources.  When your system slows down, you should see that a process called mount.ntfs is using 99% of the CPU.  mount.ntfs is the driver that Wubi uses to access the underlying Windows filesystem and, as you can see, this is what's slowing things down.\nAnother thing you can try is upgrading the RAM.  The reason you're using the HDD so much is that, with just 1 GB, the system has to spend a lot of time moving data between RAM and HDD.  It's this combination of poor HDD performance and lack of RAM that is really killing performance.\n", "Q: After flash player update, videos speeds up on YouTube As stated in the title, the videos which I was watching with normal speed, now I see with x2 the speed or even more. \nI was so excited that there was a Flash Player update and now (like always) it doesn't work properly.

Mathematically spoken, we'll just compute the absolute value of the argument and still add 0.5 as we normally would. But since we (unfortunately) have no built-in abs() function at our disposal (unless we code one), we will simply negate the argument if it's negative.\nBesides, it proved very cumbersome to work with the quotient as a parameter (since for my solution, I must be able to access the dividend and divisor separately). This is why my script has an additional third parameter.\n\nA: I'm still looking for a pure bc answer to how to round just one value within a function, but here's a pure bash answer:\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Insert the price you want to calculate:\"\nread float\necho \"This is the price without taxes:\"\n\nembiggen() {\n  local int precision fraction=\"\"\n  if [ \"$1\" != \"${1#*.}\" ]; then  # there is a decimal point\n    fraction=\"${1#*.}\"       # just the digits after the dot\n  fi\n  int=\"${1%.*}\"              # the float as a truncated integer\n  precision=\"${#fraction}\"   # the number of fractional digits\n  echo $(( 10**10 * $int$fraction / 10**$precision ))\n}\n\n# round down if negative\nif [ \"$float\" != \"${float#-}\" ]\n  then round=\"-5000000000\"\n  else round=\"5000000000\"\nfi\n\n# calculate rounded answer (sans decimal point)\nanswer=$(( ( `embiggen $float` * 100 + $round ) / `embiggen 1.18` ))\n\nint=${answer%??}  # the answer as a truncated integer\n\necho $int.${answer#$int}  # reassemble with correct precision\n\nread -p \"Press any key to continue...\"\n\nBasically, this carefully extracts the decimals, multiplies everything by 100 billion (10¹⁰, 10**10 in bash), adjusts for precision and rounding, performs the actual division, divides back to the appropriate magnitude, and then reinserts the decimal.\nStep-by-step:\nThe embiggen() function assigns the truncated integer form of its argument to $int and saves the numbers after the dot in $fraction.  The number of fractional digits is noted in $precision.  The math multiplies 10¹⁰ by the concatenation of $int and $fraction and then adjusts that to match the precision (e.g. embiggen 48.86 becomes 10¹⁰ × 4886 / 100 and returns 488600000000 which is 488,600,000,000).\nWe want a final precision of hundredths, so we multiply the first number by 100, add 5 for rounding purposes, and then divide the second number.  This assignment of $answer leaves us at a hundred times the final answer.\nNow we need to add the decimal point.  We assign a new $int value to $answer excluding its final two digits, then echo it with a dot and the $answer excluding the $int value that's already taken care of.  (Never mind the syntax highlighting bug that makes this appear like a comment)\n(Bashism: exponentiation is not POSIX, so this is a bashism.  A pure POSIX solution would require loops to add zeros rather than using powers of ten.  Also, \"embiggen\" is a perfectly cromulant word.)\n\nOne of the main reasons I use zsh as my shell is that it supports floating point math.  The solution to this question is quite straightforward in zsh:\nprintf %.2f $((float/1.18))\n\n(I'd love to see somebody add a comment to this answer with the trick to enabling floating point arithmetic in bash, but I'm pretty sure that such a feature doesn't yet exist.)\n\nA: I had to calculate the total duration of a collection of audio files.\nSo I had to: \nA. obtain the duration for each file  (not shown)\nB. add up all the durations (they were each in NNN.NNNNNN (fp) seconds )\nC. separate hours, minutes, seconds, subseconds.\nD. output a string of HR:MIN:SEC:FRAMES, where frame = 1/75 sec.\n(Frames come from SMPTE code used in studios.)\n\nA: use ffprobe and parse duration line into a fp number (not shown)\nB:\n # add them up as a series of strings separated by \"+\" and send it to bc\n\narr=( \"${total[@]}\" )  # copy array\n\n# IFS is \"Internal Field Separator\"\n# the * in arr[*] means \"all of arr separated by IFS\" \n# must have been made for this\nIFS='+' sum=$(echo \"scale=3; ${arr[*]} \"| bc -l)# (-l= libmath for fp)\necho $sum \n\nC:\n# subtract each amount of time from tt and store it    \ntt=$sum   # tt is a running var (fp)\n\n\nhrs=$(echo \"$tt / 3600\" | bc)\n\ntt=$(echo \"$tt - ( $hrs * 3600 )\" | bc )\n\nmin=$(echo \"$tt / 60\" | bc )\n\ntt=$(echo \"$tt - ($min *60)\" | bc )\n\nsec=$(echo \"$tt/1\" | bc )\n\ntt=$(echo \"$tt - $sec\" | bc )\n\nframes=$(echo \"$tt * 75\"  | bc ) # 75 frames /sec \nframes=$(echo \"$frames/1\" | bc ) # truncate to whole #\n\nD:\n#convert to proper format with printf (bash builtin)        \nhrs=$(printf \"%02d\\n\" $hrs)  # format 1 -> 01 \n\nmin=$(printf \"%02d\\n\" $min)\n\nsec=$(printf \"%02d\\n\" $sec)\n\nframes=$(printf \"%02d\\n\" $frames)\n\ntimecode=\"$hrs:$min:$sec:$frames\"\n\n# timecode \"01:13:34:54\"\n\n\nA: I know it's an old question, but I have a pure 'bc'-solution without 'if' or branches:\n#!/bin/sh\nbcr()\n{\n    echo \"scale=$2+1;t=$1;scale-=1;(t*10^scale+((t>0)-(t<0))/2)/10^scale\" | bc -l\n}\n\nUse it like bcr '2/3' 5 or bcr '0.666666' 2 --> (expression followed by scale)\nThat's possible because in bc (like C/C++) it's allowed to mixin logical expressions in your calculations.\nThe expression ((t>0)-(t<0))/2) will evaluate to +/-0.5 depending on the sign of 't' and therefore use the right value for rounding.\n\nA: bc() {\n        while :\n        do\n                while IFS='$\\n' read i\n                do\n                        /usr/bin/bc <<< \"scale=2; $i\" | sed 's/^\\./0&/'\n                done\n        done\n}\n\n\nA: You can use awk, no pipes necessary: \n$> PRICE=48.86\n$> awk -vprice=$PRICE \"BEGIN{printf(\\\"%.2f\\n\\\",price/1.18+0.005)}\"\n41.41\n\nSet the price beforehand with the environment variable PRICE=<val>. \n\n\n*\n\n*Then call the awk - $PRICE will go into awk as an awk variable\nprice. \n\n*It is then rounded up to the nearest 100th with +.005. \n\n*The printf formatting option %.2f limits the scale to two decimal\nplaces.\nIf you have to do this a lot this way is a lot more efficient than the selected answer: \ntime for a in {1..1000}; do echo $(round 48.86/1.18 2) > /dev/random; done\nreal    0m8.945s\nuser    0m6.067s\nsys 0m4.277s\n\ntime for a in {1..1000}; do awk -vprice=$PRICE \"BEGIN{printf(\\\"%.2f\\n\\\",price/1.18+0.005)}\">/dev/random; done\nreal    0m2.628s\nuser    0m1.462s\nsys 0m1.275s\n\n\nA: PRINTF NOT RELIABLE:\nThe printf method is very neat, easy to use & listed in lots of how to's.\nHowever, if you have hard coded a decimal point, you should know that your code will probably fail if used one of the many countries that use a comma separator.\nA surprising number of countries actually do use this & many of them in Europe. Probably as many as use a dot. According to Wikipedia > Decimal_separator the comma is noted as an ISO/IEC Directive ...\nThis is what happens if your computer has its number system set to use commas:\nprintf %.2f 573,5489   \n\n573,55\n\nbut\nprintf %.2f 573.5489   \n\nprintf: 573.5489: invalid number\n\nHow do we get around this?\nUsing 'bc' is one way. On its own, simply with scale=n. It doesn't need to be piped as in some of the examples. Remember that scale only works on division and to divide your input sum by one. See the answer by @user525061\nThe other, especially if you have already code using the printf method, could be to change the locale of your shell session using 'export'.\nTry:\nexport LC_NUMERIC=C\n\nBut then this negates the printf simplicity ....\n\nA: An easy and accurate way to do this is via calculation. Rounding a number up or down (and either with zero or the integer as starting point) to a specified significance is doable with just some calculations and not too difficult code. I use calc for this, but it works as well with bc.\nFor example, to round number up to specified (multiple of) decimals(s) with integer as starting point:\n1. The numerical value (number) that is to be rounded up is obtained.\n2. The numerical value / significance (decimal(s)) to which [1] has to be rounded up to is obtained.\n3. Of the numerical value [1] is obtained its integer.\n4. Of the numerical value [1] are obtained the decimals.\n5. A multiplication factor is generated; how many times does [2] fit into [4].\n6. In case the multiplication factor is not a whole number, the multiplication factor will be its integer + 1\n7. The numerical value to round up to at [2] is multiplied by the multiplication factor of [5], resulting in a new (decimal) numerical value that is rounded up to [2]\n8. And so we can add up: INTEGER + NEW_DECIMALS = ROUNDED_NUMBER\nYou can basically do this in any code. I use bash for it, but since I'm noob with code in general, you might create it different than I did. Or, if you want you can just rip it from here https://github.com/bveldhuyzen/rounding-module\n\n[EDIT]\nHere's a bc example:\n\n*\n\n*rounding up with bc scale=10 (or 100, whatever you want)\n\n*rounds up to specified significance (any decimals)\n\n*takes integer as starting point\n\n#Input number\nFULL_NUMBER=$(<full_number_1.txt) \n\n#Significance \nROUND_TO_THIS=$(<round_to_this.txt) \n\necho \"$FULL_NUMBER\" | awk '{print int($0)}' > integer.txt \nINTEGER=$(<integer.txt) \n  \necho \"scale=10; $FULL_NUMBER - $INTEGER\" | bc > leftover_decimals.txt \nDECIMALS=$(<leftover_decimals.txt)\n\necho \"scale=10; $DECIMALS / $ROUND_TO_THIS\" | bc > MPF.txt \nMPF=$(<MPF.txt) \n  \necho \"$MPF\" | awk '{print int($0)}' > MPF_total.txt \nMPF_TOTAL=$(<MPF_total.txt) \n\necho \"scale=10; $MPF - $MPF_TOTAL\" | bc > steps_leftover_decimals.txt \nSTEPS_LEFTOVER_DECIMALS=$(<steps_leftover_decimals.txt) \n\nawk '$1>0 {$1=1} 1' steps_leftover_decimals.txt > steps_leftover_decimals_1.txt \nSTEPS_LEFTOVER_DECIMALS_1=$(<steps_leftover_decimals_1.txt) \n\nif [[ $STEPS_LEFTOVER_DECIMALS_1 -eq 1 ]] \nthen \necho \"scale=10; $MPF_TOTAL + 1\" | bc > MPF_done.txt \nelse \nhead -1 MPF_total.txt > MPF_done.txt \nfi \n \nMULTIPLICATION_FACTOR_TOTAL_DONE=$(<MPF_done.txt) \n  \necho \"scale=10; $MULTIPLICATION_FACTOR_TOTAL_DONE * $ROUND_TO_THIS\" | bc > new_decimals.txt \nNEW_DECIMALS=$(<new_decimals.txt) \n  \necho \"scale=10; $INTEGER + $NEW_DECIMALS\" | bc > rounded_number.txt \n\n\n#Output / rounded number\nROUNDED_NUMBER=$(<rounded_number.txt)\n\nYou can of course make the code shorter by removing the intermediate text files (sorry I'm used working like this).\nHope it makes sense.\n[EDIT2]\nFor rounding down number to (multiple of) specified decimals with integer of full number as starting point, if multiplication factor is not a whole number, just take integer of multiplication factor * round_to_this.\n[EDIT3]\nOr just use the build-in rounding module of the calc app..\n\nA: Now isn't this ugly?

(you can see the kernel image listed there).\nBut, in 12.04, The DVD version doesn't have an text mode installer.  Though the page still saying The combined install/live DVD allows you either to install Ubuntu permanently on a computer, or (by entering 'live' at the boot prompt) to try Ubuntu without changing your computer at all. This doesn't mean it has a text installer.\nWhy? Because it lacks the .deb files required for installation.... You can see some .deb files there but those are Libreoffice languages files and some other packages. It lacks the complete package suit need for installation, such as kernel images.\nThe change in policy happened since Ubuntu 11.10. 11.10 excluded this feature for maintainability of the DVD image and from then DVD image becomes just an extension of the CD image which includes some more softwares (like gimp, pitivi) and full language packs. The release note is saying this\n\nIn Ubuntu 11.10 there is now a revised, smaller (in size) DVD based on community feedback over the last few cycles. This new DVD has a more manageable size of 1.5G, and is an extension of our current CD image that includes all the language packs and some other useful applications, such as Inkscape, GIMP, Pitivi, and a more complete LibreOffice suite. \n\nIf you are looking for alternate installer.

Unfortunately, it seems that the latency to run a thread that has become runnable has significantly increased from the 2.6 kernel to the 3.2 kernel. In fact the latency numbers we are getting are hard to believe.\nLet me be more specific about the test. We have a program that has two threads. The first thread gets the current time (in ticks using RDTSC) and then signals a condition variable once a second. The second thread waits on the condition variable and wakes up when it is signaled. It then gets the current time (in ticks using RDTSC). The difference between the time in the second thread and the time in the first thread is computed and displayed on the console. After this the second thread waits on the condition variable once more. So, we get a thread to thread signaling latency measurement once a second as a result.\nIn linux 2.6.32, this latency is somewhere on the order of 2.8-3.5 us, which is reasonable. In linux 3.2.0, this latency is somewhere on the order of 40-100 us. I have excluded any differences in hardware between the two host hosts. They run on identical hardware (dual socket X5687 {Westmere-EP} processors running at 3.6 GHz with hyperthreading, speedstep and all C states turned off). We are changing the affinity to run both threads on physical cores of the same socket (i.e., the first thread is run on Core 0 and the second thread is run on Core 1), so there is no bouncing of threads on cores or bouncing/communication between sockets.\nThe only difference between the two hosts is that one is running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS with kernel 2.6.32-28 (the fast context switch box) and the other is running the latest Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with kernel 3.2.0-23 (the slow context switch box).\nHave there been any changes in the kernel that could account for this ridiculous slow down in how long it takes for a thread to be scheduled to run?\n\nA: Off the top of my head I don't know why this would be, but if this is deemed as a severe performance regression to you I suggest filing a bug to get a kernel team member to look at it.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I report a bug?\n", "Q: How do I access Ubuntu filesystem from Windows on dualboot? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to read ext4 and btrfs partitions in Windows? \n\nI am dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows.

I would like to get a notification whenever a system cron job prints some output or just fails.\nI know it is possible to install a mail server (e.g. postfix), configure it for local-only delivery, set up an alias so that root's mail is delivered to my normal user account and configure a mail client to check my local mailbox.\nAre there any lightweight alternatives to this solution in Ubuntu?\n\nA: You could redirect the error output of your cronjob command to a file. Here is an example of a line in /etc/crontab:\n01 3    * * *   user    /bin/command 2>> /var/log/some.file\n\nThen at least you got a clue if errors occured. You might even write a script to notify you over notify-osd or similar tools when the file changes.\nEdit:\nThe file /var/log/syslog reports messages from cron as well. You might want to take a look at that. To get a dedicated log-file for the cron deamon edit /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf and uncomment/edit the line that says:\n#cron.*             /var/log/cron.log\n\nDon't know what you'll find there but worth the try. Report how it went.\n\nA: \"I would like to get a notification whenever a system cron job prints some output or just fails.\"\nI'd recommend using some sort of cron monitoring tool. There are a few out there but I currently use Dead Man's Snitch (https://deadmanssnitch.com) and like it. It will alert you when a cron job doesn't check in. Like you're doing, just curl your unique snitch URL after the job and hit the url. There are a few others out there like probyapp but they aren't free...good luck.\n\nA: Jenkins is a fairly helpful tool for this sort of thing. I know people tend to think of it as a CI, but it's really just a job execution tool. It will capture the output, run time and exit code status of a job which it uses to determine whether or not the job is a failure.\nYou can setup ssh-agent to have Jenkins connect to a remote machine, schedule jobs to run just like crons, automatically space them based on run time (instead of \"3am\"), chain dependencies, rotate logs of output on a per-job basis and integrate with a bunch of outside systems (Slack, Hipchat, etc) via plugins to be notified of failures.\nLast time I set this up, it was a huge help. We knew immediately if there were issues anywhere and were able to centrally control and track crons from multiple different systems.\n\nA: I have done something like the follows, but my use case is for a script or executable set in cron :\n0 1,13 * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/html/script.php > /tmp/script.log 2>&1 ; [ $? -ne 0 ] && mail -s \"Cron Failure Report `date` \" my.email@mail.com <<< \"Cron script.php Failed in Execution\"\n\nhope it helps!\nFor system wide application, DMS is an option.

My sound set up used to be able to handle sounds from different applications simultaneously.\nCurrently, though, if one application is playing a sound, it takes exclusive control of the sound device. If I try playing any sound from a second application, that second application is likely to freeze. Sometimes the first application will freeze or crash too.\nThere has been no hardware changes at all so I assume simultaneous sounds is still possible. There have been various software upgrades and configuration settings over time, but I couldn't say when in all of that I lost the capacity for simultaneous sounds.\nMy system has a computer running Mythbuntu that acts as a Pulseaudio sound server. It has a USB digital sound system attached to it. All computers on my network send sound over the LAN to that machine, and so any sounds from any computer come out of the same speakers.\nWhere should I be looking in order to troubleshoot this problem of no longer being able to handle simultaneous sounds?\n\nA: This sounds* like you've removed or have otherwise broken or hobbled PulseAudio and things are connecting directly to ALSA. To work out what's going on, I would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop X via sudo stop lightdm.\n\n*Check htop to make sure any graphical applications aren't lurking.\n\n*Attempt to run killall pulseaudio && pulseaudio This should run PA in the foreground so you can see any debugging output. If you see any errors at this point, that's where you go from... Be that reinstalling pulseaudio (if it's missing) or spotting the configuration errors.\n\n*If the above works without error, run sudo start lightdm in another TTY and play some audio from multiple places. This should all work. Assuming it all does, there's a problem in the way that PulseAudio is being loaded on normal boot. I'm ashamed to admit I don't know where PA is loaded from. Anwsers on a post card.\nPast that it's anybody's guess but I'm fairly sure PulseAudio is crashing on boot or isn't being loaded.\n* The pun wasn't originally intended but what the heck.\n", "Q: HDMI not working on GMA500 I have a Dell Mini 1010 (wich has  a GMA500/Poulsbo video card) with Ubuntu 12.04, everything works fine except the HDMI output. When I plug in a HDMI cable just nothing happens. When I look at the screen settings it says that there´s just one screen: the default laptop screen.\nCould someone help me to fix this problem??\nThanks!\n\nA: HDMI used to work like a charm in 10.10. I was surprised to find out that it doesn't work anymore after upgrading to 12.04. I specifically waited until 12.04 to upgrade as it seemed that the drivers were in good shape. \nSince I use my dell to give presentations every week, I just boot to windows and setup the dual screen. Then, when I boot back to Linux, it magically works -- the chipset keeps the settings and ubuntu doesn't overwrite them. It gets the job done.\n\nA: I saw this answer for your question\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/120894\nDell Mini HDMI port is unsupported.

I know there is a bug in 12.04 which makes the Super+W shortcut only show open applications/programs from the current workspace, not all workspaces like it should.\nIs there a workaround until this bug is fixed?\n\nNote: This is not off-topic or a duplicate of this closed question because a workaround now exists.\n\n\nA: A patched compiz-core which fixes this bug is available from PPA\n\n*\n\n*As mentioned, this is a Compiz bug which will not be officially fixed until 12.04.2 (expected January 2013.)\n\n\n*But one of the compiz-core developers has made a PPA with a fixed version of Compiz that solves this bug.\n\n*\n\n*If you are unfamiliar with PPAs, you may want to read What are PPAs... and Are PPAs safe...\nTo install from the PPA:\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Add the PPA with sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bsantos/ppa\n\n*Run sudo apt-get update\n\n*Update Compiz with sudo apt-get install compiz\n\nNote: Installing this workaround will not break any future updates to compiz; between now and the release of 12.04.2, any official compiz updates may make the old (faulty) Super+W behavior return for a few days until the developer fixes it and releases the updated version to his PPA.\n\nDemonstration:\nTerminal, Software Center, Firefox and Nautilus are open in separate workspaces:\n\nAfter installing the fixed PPA version, Super+W shows all four:\n\n\nA: Many years later, in the time of writing this, it is necessary to press Super+Shift+W.\n", "Q: /var/lib/apt/lists is huge I've noticed that /var/lib/apt/lists is HUGE. It's as large as 86MB. Which seems a little too big. Is this normal? If not, what should I do?\n\nA: When you run sudo apt-get update (or use the Refresh button in a package manager), a list of packages will get downloaded from the Ubuntu servers. These files are then stored in /var/lib/apt/lists/.\nYou can safely remove the contents of that directory as it is recreated when you refresh the package lists. If you remove the files, but do not run apt-get update to fetch the lists, commands like apt-cache will fail to provide information (since the cache is empty).\nTo shrink the directory and speed up fetching package lists, consider disabling some repositories that you do not need (see How to remove a repository?). This includes PPAs (see also How can PPAs be removed?)\n\nA: If you feel like that, then try with this command:\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: Mine is 142M, so i guess it's normal.\nThe reason can be because /var/lib/apt/lists/ is the storage area for state information for each package resource specified in sources.list\n", "Q: Where can I find the Ubuntu drivers for a Dell 1700 printer. I have Hewlett Packard Compaq D230 PC running Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 LTS 32 bit.

The printer should however run fine in Ubuntu without the drivers.\n\nUsing Printers with Ubuntu\nIn the application System Settings (by default in the dock) there is a section called \"Printing\".\n\nAlternatively, you can access it via the System Menu:\n\nFrom that tool you can add and manage your printers.\nOnce you have a printer added you can manage it by right-clicking on it and choosing \"Properties\"\n\nFrom here you can see, edit and control various aspects of your printer like status, name and ink levels (if supported).\n\n\nA: The best linux printer driver I've found for this printer is Generic PCL 6/PCL XL Printer Foomatic/ljet4.  If you have problems with slow printing I'd recommend giving it a try.\n\nA: Some configurations result in printer \"escape\" codes appearing in the printout as well as output that is not centered on the sheet or completely garbled output. I've had intermittent trouble with the following:\nGeneric PCL 6/PCL XL Printer Foomatic/pxlcolor (recommended)\nGeneric PCL 6/PCL XL Printer Foomatic/ljet4d\nGeneric PCL 6/PCL XL Printer Foomatic/CUPS\n\nSo I'm not recommending the one labelled \"recommended\". I'm now using: \nGeneric PCL 5e\n\nThis one seems to be better in my experience.\nYou can set this up the usual way using System Settings > Printing.\n\nA: I just found out you can use the Lexmark E230 printer driver!\nI am not 100% sure why this worked but I was checking which printers used the same toner, Lexmark E230.\nSo this driver worked for me!\n\"Lexmark E230 Foomatic/pxlmono (recommended)\"\nReally glad this device still works for me after so many years and no longer limited to use Windows. I need to test out all the other functionality and may update this post accordingly.\nI am using Linux mint 20.2 which is pretty much the same as Ubuntu.\nFunny enough when you check the models online Dell 1700n and Lexmark E230 they look eerily similar! just the button placement of the dell is from the top instead of the front.\nIf more people can confirm this we can keep this printer alive for the prolonged future!\n", "Q: How do I find out my motherboard model? Is there a way to find what motherboard model I have?\nIf yes, how, please?\n\nA: Non-root user variant\nI would like to suggest a variant for the unprivileged users, since it's not always possible to execute commands as root (some users simply cannot and however it is always a good practice to avoid running commands as root when it's not needed) and or there is no intention or possibility to install new programs:\ncat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_{vendor,name,version}\n\nthat it is a short version, shell expanded, of cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_vendor /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_name /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_version and gives as a spartan output respectively  vendor, name and version:  \nFUJITSU\nD3062-A1\nS26361-D3062-A1     \n\nNote:\nInside the path /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/ it's possible to find some files with information about BIOS, board (motherboard), chassis... not all are readable by an unprivileged user due to a security or privacy concerns.  \n\nPrivileged user variant\nOf course, e.g, a sudo cat board_serial (that usually is readable only by root, -r--------) or a sudo cat board_* can easily overcame this limit... \n...but, maybe, if privileges are available it's more convenient to use dmidecode as suggested in other answers as well.  \nBelow is the version I prefer, due to the compactness of its output: \nsudo dmidecode -t 1                   # or \nsudo dmidecode  | grep -A4 '^Base'    # output more short and compact\n\nThe previous command with -A3 will show only the first 3 lines and it is the short version for\nsudo dmidecode  | grep -A4 '^Base Board Information'\nthat should be better to use if in a script.\nExample output:\nBase Board Information\n    Manufacturer: FUJITSU\n    Product Name: D3062-A1\n    Version: S26361-D3062-A1            \n    Serial Number: MySerialNumber(1)\n\n(1) if it is protected for unprivileged users, then maybe it's better to avoid posting it :-)\nPs> The following works fine too sudo lshw | grep -A5 \"Mot\" (again \"Mot\" is the short for \"Motherboard\" and only \"Mo\" will not filter words as Model or Mobile...), but I find it a little lazier than dmidecode to answer with its output (lshw 0.906s vs dmidecode 0.024s).\n\nA: This worked for me: \nsudo dmidecode --string baseboard-product-name\n\nsee: https://charlieharvey.org.uk/page/motherboard_model_make_serial_linux_or_debian_bash_shell\n\nA: Simple one-liner in Ubuntu variants\nsudo dmidecode -s baseboard-product-name\n\nwill give you motherboard model name\nYou can also find out motherboard's manufacturer, version, serial-number, asset-tag, and other string commands for other devices.\n\nA: This will directly show you motherboard info:\nsudo dmidecode -t 2\n\nor\nsudo dmidecode | more\n\nYou can also try:\nlspci\n\n\nA: You can also use lshw.

MUCH slower than the old Xubuntu on the 8GB stick.\nStarting takes minutes, all applications \"fade\" because they respond too slow.\nI first thought that the NVidia graphics card is responsible for this, because there seem to be some known problems with that. Doing the adjustment (uncheck the sync checkbox) did not help.\nI believe the root cause is that the access to the USB stick is extremely slow. Running the read benchmark of the disk utility then brought the message \"disk is too slow to benchmark\"!\nBUT: When I do the same benchmark with the live CD I get around 20MB read performance and have a very responsive system! \nSo how can I find out what is going one here?\n\nA: I wonder if this is because there are a load of dirty pages being written back and this is causing the CFQ I/O scheduler some issues on a slow device.

This setup with the config for dhclient and dnsmasq, and the same resolv.conf and hosts files worked on my old Debian box. \n\nA: I worked out what the problem was. \nAfter way too long struggling to work out what was wrong with resolvconf or dnsmasq, I finally decided to double-check the firewall. Since I hadn't changed anything in my iptables rules for 5 years, I didn't think this would be the problem. But I couldn't figure out why dnsmasq was listening on port 53 but not writing any DNS look-ups in its logs. So it had to be the firewall. \nAlong time ago, I wrote a rule to allow everything through that wasn't from the external interface. \niptables -A INPUT -i !eth0 -j ACCEPT\n\nThat worked fine on the old machine I had because I wasn't using dnsmasq for DNS look-ups on the actual server. So dnsmasq worked happily on requests coming in on eth1. But on my new machine, I started testing it with look-ups on lo. With Ubuntu 12.04 that rule does not allow \"all interfaces except eth0\". I played around with the rule and found that it should be this:\niptables -A INPUT ! -i eth0 -j ACCEPT\n\nMaybe if I'd put the hour of work in back at the start to configure my new machine with ufw I would've been up and running on the same day.

After that, you can add an POP3 account to Claws Mail, which receiving server will be localhost and set the port to use to 2000 in the Advanced tab. The username to use consists of a complete email address, like johndoe@hotmail.com, so that FreePOP can know which type of account it is.

If possible then How?\n\nA: If you are running 12.04 with all the updates you are running 12.04.1\n12.04.1 is just a \"point release\", which adds the updates into the ISO file. You can read about the process here. It is not a distribution upgrade so you won't see the option to upgrade in update manager.\n\nA: To verify if you have updated to Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS. \nRun this command on your Terminal:\ncat /etc/issue\n\nA: You don't need to do anything special. Just update your PC either using the Upgrade Manager (how you normally get updates) or use the following command:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThere isn't anything special about the point releases, they are just bundled updates. It's more for when you download an iso, so it will have more of the updates already.\n", "Q: Low sound issues on HP p7-1227c PC using IDT 92HD73E1X5 chip Anyone else ever encountered issues with low sound? \nInstalled a fresh new install of ubuntu 12.04 x64 alongside Win7.

Let's start with the questions first:\n\n\n*\n\n*The command sudo grub-install /dev/sdb    (where sdb is my USB drive) should work when booted from the hard drive with USB drive connected. However, since GRUB puts its config files in /boot/grub, where those will go depends on what kind of Ubuntu installation you have in the USB drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*If it is a live USB, the /boot/grub folder includes a loopback.cfg\nand installing the rest of grub there may have unintended effects.\n\n*If you have a full installation of Ubuntu in a 8GB or larger USB drive, See more at\nHow do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? (without using Startup Disk Creator),\nthen GRUB should be installed at the time of Ubuntu installation. If\nfor some reason GRUB is not installed, you can mount the USB boot\npartion (assuming sdb1) and specify where the rest of grub goes by\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\nsudo grub-install –boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdb\n\n\n\n*Yes, you can get a GRUB menu from USB drive provided you have a full Ubuntu installation in that USB drive.\n\n*No, update grub should not delete information from the internal drive. You can control which GRUB will be updated by using sudo chroot /mnt after mounting sdb1 to mnt.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Maybe you could, but this isn't the preferred way to do it. The Live USB is already a rescue disk by default. It doesn't make much sense because you would still need to restore/repair GRUB on the target disk.

Granted I am very new to Linux and know only the GUI aspect of what it does from finding similarities that Windows 7 has. I would like to become a Linux Power User and I figured this would be a good step to get started. \nI was able to successfully install my graphics driver and it shows in use. I connect the HDMI to my HD TV and I get no sound. I don't care about auto switch for sound, that would be great but not necessary.

Currently, whenever Dropbox has an internet connection it syncs. This is an issue when I am tethering with my mobile because of the cost of mobile data.\nThe Dropbox application doesn't let me choose which wifi networks to use but I can use a proxy server. So I was thinking I could setup a local proxy server with wifi rules.\nDoes anyone know of a proxy server which has network rules based on wifi? Or does anyone have a better option for limiting Dropbox to particular wifi networks? Apart from simply closing Dropbox ;)\n\nA: I have no experience with the proxies, but you can use UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to redirect the outbound traffic.

None of them have worked.\nDetails of my experience are as follows:\nI have just recently installed Ubuntu 12.04.1 (32-bit). Ubuntu installed on my system seemingly fine, and I even formatted my hard drive during the process. It's as if it were a new desktop computer.\nDuring the installation I was asked to connect to a Wireless Network. I have a USB Wireless Card connected which I have used to connect desktop PC's, laptops, and a Wii to the internet from approximately the same area of the house (thus the same distance from the Wireless Router). I chose my network, entered the correct password for it (I double checked; it's definitely the right password) and proceeded with the installation. Several times before the installation was complete, I was asked to authenticate the connection, and this seemed to do nothing each time. On the repeated screens the password was already entered in the appropriate box.\nWhen Ubuntu booted up the first thing I was faced with (other than something about Language settings, or something) was another request for authentication. Again, the password was already there, so I clicked connect. It did not connect. Instead, I was once again faced with repeated requests every few minutes.\nI went onto my laptop, which is connected to this network, checked the details of the network, and entered them manually into my Ubuntu PC (including the IPv4 and IPv6 information) but this didn't work either, so I set it back to finding the settings automatically. Note, also, that the \"Connect automatically\" and \"Available to all users\" boxes are checked, and have been unchecked & rechecked countless times. I have also tried having my User account connect automatically, and to need a password entered at the welcome screen.\nWhilst I've been writing this, it has gone through a spat of connecting successfully to the network for less than a minute, before coming offline again, only to repeat the process. But it has now returned to prompting me for a password every couple of minutes.\nThis computer has already run on the Fedora OS, and had no trouble connecting to, and maintaining a connection. I also have a laptop running Windows 7 less than a metre away from this desktop PC, which is connected and has no trouble maintaining a connection at 50%-100% strength (fluctuating).\nTherefore:\n\n\n*\n\n*I know it's not the wireless card\n\n*I know it's not the PC itself\n\n*I know it's not the access point\n\n*I know it's not the location of my PC or wireless card\n\n*It is solely because of Ubuntu\n\n\nEverything else has worked fine, but the moment Ubuntu was introduced into the equation, it has gone completely wrong. Honestly; I prefer Ubuntu as an OS to Fedora, but if I can't solve the problem it'll be straight back to Fedora that I'll have to go.\nCan anyone help me at all?\n\nA: Click the NM applet on the panel. Then select \"Edit Connections...\". In the Wireless tab of the dialog, select and delete the connections in question (or all of them). Save and close the dialog. Click the NM applet on the panel again and select the wifi name that previously not be able to connect. If you can't see the name that you want, try finding it in \"More networks\". Hope this can help. (Writen on 20130222)\n(Editted on 20130226) It was a shame that I did not check the connection thoroughly. The connection type was ad-hoc (which was not infrastructure type) so it did not work the way it usually did. Sorry. (Writen on 20130226)Since I have BCM43228, I followed NikTh's suggession in http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2084508&highlight=BCM43228 and got connected. However, I did not know what really caused the problem and when because I was working in a not stable environment. The AP worked on and off and the computer got new update continually. That was why I could not reallized when the connection changed from working fine to not working. (Writen on 20130226 + about 2 hrs after the first edition)\nI have to say sorry again for the problem has come back after I disabled wireless connection and used wired connection for printing jobs. I have to do more research or go back to Lucid. Sorry for not a good answer. (Writen on 20130226 + about 5 hrs after the first edition)After a short research I found and followed http://pkgs.org/ubuntu-12.04/ubuntu-multiverse-i386/broadcom-sta-common_5.100.82.112-4_all.deb/download/. After restarting and did an off and on on a Enable Wireless it connected. This gave me a bit better feeling even though the connection was set to connect automatically. I also found that I got different IP every time I managed to connect. The university dhcp server remembers a served IP and always serves the same IP if the computer reconnects within 5 days. I meant I was not sure this would solve the problem instantly. (Hope this is the last edition) The time I posted these messages was about 24 hours after the (hopefully) last edition. The connection was made in the condition that (1) the computer was shutdown previously with wireless disabled status and (2) no LAN cable was connected to the computer when starting up. What I did was enabling the wireless via NM's menu and got connected. This might not be a good answer but it could be a work-around.This post was done 16 hours later (20130228:0230 UTC). Now what I said to be a work-around could be promoted to be an answer. The computer must not be connected with a LAN cable. The status of wireless connectivity when previously shutdown was not a matter. What really to be done when started up was enabling the wireless network. If the wireless was enabled you might see the NM applet blinks endlessly. In such a situation, just disable it and enable it back again and you'll be fine.\n\nA: I had the same problem: new Ubuntu version caused endless password authentication requests. The workaround of deleting the connection helped BUT ONLY WITH RESTARTING THE COMPUTER. In other words, I first deleted the connection. Then, I restarted the computer. Then, I added the connection again. Adding the connection without the restarting caused endless trying by the system to connect after it asked for a password. No successful connection followed without restarting the computer.\n\nA: System Settings -> Network (-> Forget Network) -> Type/Select desired network Name / SSID (in the Network name box) -> Options (lower right corner) -> Wireless security (4th tab) -> Enter Key -> select \"save\" ( -> Restart).\n", "Q: how can I recursively set pemission to all sub directories of a directory specified? with this command \n\nsudo chmod 777 /var/www/\n\nI get 777 on www but not under www/subdir1/subdir2 \nhow can I set all subdirectories recursively to 777 with one command?\n\nA: Use the -R flag. \nso the command would be sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/.\nThis is, however a bad idea and you should normally do it one at a time.\n", "Q: Wireless Stop Working After Kernel Updates 3.2.0-29-generic Two or three days back, I have updated to kernel 3.2.0-29-generic from kernel 3.2.0-27-generic.

How do i fix this. I am unable to find any setting for this.\n\nA: There is actually a better solution implemented in Sublime Text.

The resulting file should look like this: \n{\n    \"remember_open_files\": false,\n    \"hot_exit\": false\n}\n\n(All the possible settings can be seen in Settings - Default.)\nJust restart Sublime Text afterwards (it may be required to restart the program two times, one time to apply the settings) and it should start up without any open files.\nNote: I only was able to test this with Sublime Text 3, but I am pretty sure that this settings exist in version 2 as well.\n\nA: Sublime Text 2\nCheck the content of the directory ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Settings for a file called Session.sublime_session\nIf those files are included in there, remove them\nSublime Text 3\nST3 stores the session files under:\n~/.config/sublime-text-3/Local/Session.sublime_session\n\n\nA: In Sublime Text 3, below worked for me. \n\n$ rm ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Local/Auto\\ Save\\\n  Session.sublime_session\n\n", "Q: How to reset fonts is there any way to reset fonts? my recent customization made the desktop ugly, now the fonts are not smooth and some are very small.I used ubuntu tweak tool to reset fonts. but it didn't work as thought.is there a configuration file to edit or delete to reset this?\n\nA: OK...I found \"a way\"...I installed Unsettings tool and made all font settings default. now it's charming like before.

They are usually just formatted as one lump.\nYour desktop should find it automatically and mount it for you.\nFailing that, try plugging in the device and running dmesg -- that will give you details about what you just plugged in, including device info and any partition tables.  From that point, you should be able to do execute a sudo mount /dev/XXX /media/YYY with XXX being the device and YYY being an existing directory.\n\nA: Ok, I just got this to work...albeit with a USB flash drive.  I know you're trying to get a USB hard drive to work, but give this a shot.\nI took Jeremy and pgschks' advice and ran a dmesg | tail -n 50:\n\nI noticed the 3rd line from the bottom mentioned \"sdb: sdb1.\"  I then tried the following:\nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/usb\n\nI can now cd to the /media/usb dir, and see the files that are on my flash drive.\n\nA: First, you can try to see if the USB device is detected, then we'll check about partition table.\nTo do this, you can try the lsusb command (it works as a regular user, no need to be root).\nRun this command before and after plug-in your external drive; then compare results.\nIn my case, I have a new line at the bottom :\nBus 002 Device 018: ID 059f:100d LaCie, Ltd\n\nIf you got the same list before and after plugging your device, that may be hardware related (not enough power on USB connector, USB disabled in BIOS, etc...).\nAs said Jeremy, the dmesg command can be helpful to track what is going on when you plug your drive.\n\nA: It is possible that ntfs-config is missing.\nYou can install it with\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\n\nand then try once more to see your drives with:\nsudo fdisk -l | grep NTFS | awk '{print $1}'\n\n\nA: It will be mounted automatically when plugged-in. If not, boot into Windows and try to browse it on Windows and try it again on Ubuntu. (Remember Safety Remove Device on Windows!)\n\nA: *\n\n*I think that if you formatted it in FAT32, your Ubuntu will see it. If it is an NTFS drive then install ntfs-3g. Install it using sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g\n\n*For the \"mounting the drive\" part, you can have a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount/USB.\nInstructions:\nFirst of all, after you installed ntfs-3g, check the device is there using sudo fdisk -l\nThen create a mount point using sudo mkdir /media/external.\nIf the drive is formatted in NTFS, use sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/external. If if is in FAT32 or FAT16, use sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/external -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137. If you want to unmount it use sudo umount /media/external.

Is something wrong? I'm attempting to install on a freshly formatted 80 gig hard drive (in the ext4 format).

Alternatively you can modify the boot menu via Control Panel >\n  System > Advanced > Startup and Recovery and pressing \"Edit\". For\n  Windows 98 you have to edit C:\\config.sys and remove the Wubi block.\n  For Windows Vista/7, you can use the built-in bcdedit command or\n  install EasyBCD to edit the boot menu. To use bcdedit, run cmd.exe as\n  an administrator, then enter bcdedit to show all boot entries, note\n  the {GUID} specified for the Ubuntu entry, and then remove it: bcdedit\n  /delete {GUID}\n\nIf registry entry still present then , \n\nTo remove Wubi from the add/remove list, delete the registry key:\n  HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\Wubi\nAn easy method of removing this registry key is to paste the following\n  text into a plain editor such as Notepad, close and save the file as\n  something like removeWubiKey.reg (you may wish to go to Folder Options\n\nView and disable the \"Hide file extensions for known file types\" option to check that the .reg extension has been applied correctly).\n    Then you can perform the rest automatically by opening the file in the\n    normal Windows manner, or choosing the \"Merge\" option from the right\n    click context menu. Note: The formatting is rather strict, so copy the\n    text exactly for best results. You may need to be logged in as the\n    administrator to delete the key, depending on the version of Windows\n    you are using. User Account Control in Vista may also ask for\n    permission, in the typical fashion.\n\nREGEDIT4\n[-HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\Wubi]\nAfter deleting the registry key, Ubuntu may still appear in the\n  program list.

Does Canonical offer any online support (such as online chat) to help people like me? I try to understand the posts but the language is just too technical for me to understand what to do to help myself.\n\nA: Related to support , \nThey have lot of subject based IRC Chat channels here as Chat support IRC\n\nThere are several Internet relay chat (IRC) channels on the freenode\n  network (irc.freenode.net) used for Ubuntu support and development.\nThe best place to start for general help with Ubuntu or just to meet\n  other Ubuntu users is #ubuntu or one of the many local language\n  channels.\nSpecific channels are available for Ubuntu derivatives: #kubuntu,\n  edubuntu, #lubuntu and #xubuntu and separate channels relate to development, bugs,local community (LoCo) teams, accessibility and\n  documentation.

My LAN port was working well and good till yesterday when I shut down my system. When I wanted to use my laptop today the wired network was not being detected. When the port works the blue light glows as an indicator but right now just an orange light indicating failure is glowing. \nThis light keeps glowing and tries to connect even when I have removed my LAN cable.

This is how vi is programmed you cannot change the behavior.\nBut say if you are in line number 3. If you try :r !date. It will insert the date value into line number 4.\nIf you want the date value to be appeared on line number 3, then you try :2r !date will insert the date value in line number 3.\n\nA: You can paste the contents of the clipboard buffer between characters with Ctrl-R * in insert mode (and a similar approach for other buffers).  So if you can get the system command into a buffer, you should be set.  (Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1491135/paste-multi-line-string-into-gvim-at-cursor-position ).\n:let @a=system(\"ls -l\") will put the output of ls -l into register a.  You can then paste it (in insert mode) with ^R-a.\n\nA: Here is alternative way of pasting output from external command before the cursor:\n:exe 'norm i' . system(\"ls -l\")\n\nor use expression register (:help @=):\n\"=system('ls -la')\n\nthen hit P. Or shorter way by:\n<CTRL-R>=system('ls -la')<CR>\n\n\nA: In addition to let and p, we can also employ vim's functions setreg() and put like so:\n:call setreg('f',system(\"ls\"))\n\n:put f\n\nNote, register f was chosen in this example simply for mnemonic representation for the word \"files\". There's nothing particularly special about it and you're free to choose your own register. \n\nA: The :r command takes a line range into which the results will be read. In vim command lines, \".\" in a range means \"the current line.\" So :r ... is equivalent to :.r ..., and means \"put what I'm reading after the current line.\nYou're free to specify the range to write to using an expression based on ..

I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 as a VirtualBox guest with a PC keyboard, and whenever I press Alt, the menus for the currently focused application appear. While holding Alt, if I press other keys, sometimes the menus open. I never want this. There are no cases when I ever activate menu items from the keyboard. Is there a way to permanently and completely turn this off, so that no menu can ever appear or open in response to any key press?\nIt seems like this question must have been asked a million times, but I have searched and searched and can't seem to find any answer. I have already turned off the dashboard, but now I need to unplug any and all menus from my Alt key, so that I may use it.\n\nA: It turns out the easiest way is to remap the left-alt key using xmodmap. This is sufficient because I only use the left-alt for my keyboard shortcuts. Most apps don't have any features linked to the alt key anyway, but in case one comes along, I still have the right-alt key for it. \nI would still prefer to simply disable the default \"alt activates the application menu\" feature.

I have Windows as well as Ubuntu on same hard-disk on my computer. Whether any remedy or I have to fresh load Ubuntu?\n\nA: I would personally opt for a clean install.\nBoot to a LiveCD, backup your home files (which should all be accessible still) and any others that you want to keep to another drive and reinstall. The whole process takes about half an hour (depending on how much stuff you have) and you get a shiny clean install.\nYou might want to try recovering the upgrade process first - just in case it's that simple.

How can I find just the *.mp3 files with a recursive command like ls -R *.mp3 in a directory that contains several sub-directories and at the end copy these files in a directory that I choose.\nThanks for your support.\n\nA: There is also another way to do it which I think will suit your purpose perfectly. You can combine find with a while loop and not even need to use either of exec or xargs at all. If, for example you wanted to copy your mp3s from your download folder to your music folder, you would use the following script, which I have used many times. \nYou can modify it how you want by changing the directories that find searches and places the resulting files in; if no directory is stated, find will search the entire home folder. You can also change cp to mv or other commands. It is pretty fast, as I have just tested it with 3945 .jpg files! Copy it into a text editor, save it and then make it executable by running chmod +x myscript.\n#!/bin/bash\n# a script to recursively find and copy files to a desired location\nfind ~/Downloads -type f -iname '*.mp3' -print0 |\nwhile IFS= read -r -d '' f; \ndo cp -- \"$f\" ~/Music ;\ndone\n\nAt this noted Bash wiki it is shown how useful it is to combine the while loop and read commands to process the output of the find command; and the way I have done it makes sure that the script will not break if it comes across file names with spaces or other unexpected or special characters.\nFor more general information on the find command, enter in the terminal man find or see the Ubuntu manpages online. For a great introduction to the use of find, see this article as well.\n\nA: The command is:\nfind /path/to/directory -name \"*.mp3\" -exec cp {} /some/other/dir/ \\;\n\nAlternative:\nfind /path/to/dir/ -name '*.mp3' | xargs cp -t /target/\n\nExample:\nalex@MaD-pc:~/test$ ls\n1  2  3\nalex@MaD-pc:~/test$ ls 1 2 3\n1:\n1.txt  2.mp3  3.txt\n\n2:\n4.txt  5.mp3  6.txt\n\n3:\nalex@MaD-pc:~/test$ find . -name \"*.mp3\" -exec cp {} 3/ \\;\nalex@MaD-pc:~/test$ ls 3\n2.mp3  5.mp3\n\nFor more information:\nman find\n\n", "Q: Why does integrity check fail for the 12.04.1 Alternate ISO? I have followed various recommendations from the Ubuntu Documentation to create a bootable Ubuntu USB flash drive using the 12.04.1 Alternate install ISO-file for 64-bit PC. But the integrity test of the USB stick has failed and I do not see why.\nThese are the steps I have made:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download of the 12.04.1 Alternate install ISO-file for 64-bit PC (ubuntu-12.04.1-alternate-amd64.iso) from http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04.1/, as well as the MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 hash files and related PGP signatures\n\n*Verification of the data integrity of the ISO-file using the MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 hash files, after having verified the hash files using the related PGP signature files (see e.g. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToSHA256SUM and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto)\n\n*Creation of a bootable USB stick using Ubuntu's Startup Disk Creator program (see http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu)\n\n*Boot of my computer using the newly made 12.04.1 Alternate install on USB stick\n\n*Selection of the option \"Check disc for defects\" (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/CDIntegrityCheck)\n\n\nSteps 1, 2, 3 and 4 went without any problem or error messages. However, step 5 ended with an error message entitled \"Integrity test failed\" and with the following content:\nThe ./install/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64/pxelinux.cfg/default file failed the MD5\nchecksum verification. Your CD-ROM or this file may have been corrupted. \nI have experienced the same (might only be similar since I have no exact notes) error message in previous attempts using the 12.04 (i.e. not the maintenance release) Alternate install ISO-file. I have in these cases tried to install anyway and have so far not experienced any problems to my knowledge.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is failed integrity check described above a serious error?\n\n*What is the solution? \n\n*Or can it be ignored without further problems?\n\n\nA: This is an error in mastering the ISO, but can safely be ignored\n\n*\n\n*You get this error because the install/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64/pxelinux.cfg/default file does not exist in the 64-bit alternate ISO image, although it does in the ISO's file-checksum list (md5sum.txt):\n\n*\n\n*573bf62a1f14cdcef0e8299863547a5a  ./install/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64/pxelinux.cfg/default\n\n\n*See this pastebin for the actual contents of the install/netboot folder.\n\n\n\n\n*It can be ignored because the files refer to the minimal \"netboot\" ISO version, which is irrelevant when you are using a full alternate ISO.\n\n\n*If you really want to \"solve\" the error, you can download the missing file into the appropriate folder; beware that this may not be the last though because apparently there are six such missing files...\n\nA: This stopped my installation dead in its tracks doing an alternate install with an encrypted volume.  Using unetbootin to create the image, the six files mentioned above were missing.  I am convinced this is an issue with filename and path length restrictions causing these long filenames to be missing.  This issue is marked as an invalid bug here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1041911\nUltimately adding the files didn't help.

You might want to track down powertop's Ubuntu maintainer to see what they feel.\nOtherwise, you're left to get this from another source. In this case I think you should be fairly safe to look at the available builds here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/powertop\n... And just snatch Quantal's version.

If Libre Office is better than in which situations and circumstances? Why Ubuntu has decided to switch from Open Office to Libre?\n\nA: LibreOffice is exactly the same as OpenOffice.\nHowever, OpenOffice became the property of the company Oracle when Oracle bought Sun Microsystems that oversaw the development of OpenOffice. Some people fear that Oracle might make changes that go against the philosophies of open source software.\nLibreOffice was created by taking the exact same code as OpenOffice, and releasing it under a name that was not owned by Oracle.\nSo, to answer your question from the point of view of usage, there is no advantage or difference in terms of using the OpenOffice or LibreOffice... at least, not yet, as, so far as I know, Oracle has no significantly changed it.

I then fire up XBMC from a terminal on the PC monitor using:\nDISPLAY=:0.1 xbmc\n\nXBMC fires up quite nicely on the TV however I can no longer use the main PC monitor/mouse/keyboard as XBMC on the TV screen seems to have focus. I was hoping to have XBMC running on the TV and let the kids use the MCE remote whilst I get on with my work on the PC monitor.\nDoes anyone have any idea how to overcome this? I'm presuming there's some xorg.conf fun and games needed but I've no idea where to start to be honest.\n\nA: I was searching for the same.\nI found you question first, but after searching a bit more I found a working answer and came back here to share. \nThe page that has the answer is located:\nhttp://blog.burlock.org/xbmc/77-fullscreen-xbmc-without-locking-the-mouse\nA copy and paste of the basics:\nFirst, you'll need to install a clever little application called \"wmctrl\", which permits us change certain window properties, such as hiding the border or making a window full-screen.\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nNext, you'll need the following script. I've called it \"xbmc-fs\" for obvious reasons. It's pretty self explanatory, so take a look at the comments. The only thing you might need to change is the fifth line where the display is selected. In my case, the TV is on display 1, so that's what I've set in the file. If yours is on display 0, then simply change the 1 to a 0 on line 5.\n#! /bin/bash\n# Launch XBMC in windowed mode, then use wmctrl to remove the titlebar\n\n# Select display 1\nDISPLAY=:0.1\n\n# Start XBMC without blocking this script\nxbmc &\n\n# Wait for the XBMC window to appear\nstatus=0\nwhile [ $status -eq 0 ]\ndo\n   sleep 1\n   status=`wmctrl -x -l | grep \"XBMC Media Center\" | wc -l | awk '{print $1}'`\ndone\n\n# Force XBMC window to fullscreen\nwmctrl -x -r XBMC Media Center.XBMC Media Center -b toggle,fullscreen\n\nThe only other thing you'll have to do is make sure that you've set XBMC to the same resolution as the monitor/TV it will be displayed on, otherwise certain events can trigger the XMBC window to revert to the size that's set in it's configuration.\n\nA: The above script is perfect; assuming the DISPLAY is correct for your setup.  If it doesn't work for you, it's probably either the DISPLAY, or the final wmctrl line.\nIt wasn't working for me, but simplifying the line to the following did the trick:\nwmctrl -r \"XBMC Media Center\" -b \"toggle,fullscreen\"\n\n", "Q: Monitor Black after Update today 12.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? \n\nToday after installing all available updates, I restarted my PC and my monitor won't display anything. It is strange as I cannot even get it to display a BIOS screen during startup.\nThe PC is however booting up - the media player is picking up mediaTomb and streaming perfectly well.\nI have tried a second monitor, same thing, absolutely no response during any part of boot sequence or thereafter. I have also tried a second cord as well, no difference.\nI did recently upgrade monitors and when doing so enabled the nvidia driver rather than using the generic one, but have had no problems until this afternoon.\nI am totally aware that this is a question that lacks a lot of details, but I am fairly new to Linux.\nAs the PC is up and running, I am happy to CTRL-ALT-T a terminal window and type in any suggestions you folks might have to get the monitor displaying anything.\n\nA: It seems that the latest nvidia drivers that came down in the update somehow threw the system out.\nAfter opening a terminal using CTRL-ALT-T I entered:\nsudo nvidia-settings --uninstall\n\nthen typed in my password waited for a half hour (no idea how long the process would take), then restarted the machine. Loaded up perfectly fine.\n", "Q: GIMP extended input devices settings problem I have a Trust graphics tablet. Today I realized how to make GIMP use the tablet's sensitivity features: by going to Edit > Preferences > Input Devices > Configure Extended Input Devices, and there change the settings for the tablet. This works fine, until I close GIMP and reopen it. Then no input device is able to do anything and I need to go through the menus again to enable the tablet.\nWhat happens is that there are two entries for extended input devices to the tablet: one for the tablet's stylus, and one for its mouse (not my PS/2 moues, but rather a mouse that arrived packed with the tablet and that is used by it). Whenever I change the settings for the stylus entry, it works, but when I quit GIMP and reenter, it somehow transfers the settings I used for the stylus to the second entry: that of the mouse.\nIt's probably because GIMP recognizes the two input devices with the same name (I can see two \"UC-LOGIC Tablet WP8060U\" entries in the settings dialog) and somehow it attributes the settings I made to the mouse before it does to the stylus. Maybe if I change the name of one input device it will work properly? How do I do that? And if that doesn't work, what else can I try?\nEDIT: After reading a little, I tried tinkering with the options found in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d, but I only managed to make The X server ignore the stylus instance of the tablet and not the mouse instance. I don't understand how that's possible, as I went through everything in the driver that activates the tablet and disabled it. Any other ideas?\n\nA: There is a \"Save input device settings on exit\" right on the \"Input Devices\" tab in the Preferences dialog. Use it :)\n\nA: You might try something like\nSection \"InputClass\"\n     MatchUSBID \"5543:0005\"\n     MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/mouse*\"\n     Option \"Ignore\" \"on\"\nEndSection\n\nWhich should ignore just the mouse interface, you can replace the USBID with the correct one, but I believe that is the correct one for the WP8060. Hopefully that helps.\n", "Q: Is there a way to switch to the old netbook interface? Is there a way to switch to the old netbook remix interface?

How do you add a little margin for icon space next to menu items in Unity bar menu? I'm trying to make menu items appear more consistently aligned when there are both menu items with/without icon in the menu. I'm talking about this\n\n\nI'm guessing this takes only few lines of changes in unity.css in /gtk-3.0/apps but I'm not sure what to change there. This is the default Ambience theme.\n\nA: Not the clean solution you're looking for, but you could create an icon full of transparency.  \nIt would accomplish the goal of consistent layout/indentation.  Using transparency would also make it portable across themes.\n", "Q: Is it worth upgrading RAM? I'm thinking about upgrading my RAM from 1GB to 2 or 4 GB. I would like to have some idea as to whether buying more RAM would be worth the expense. How can I know whether I will see  better performance after upgrading RAM?\n\nA: I upgraded from 1 GB to 2 GB and I saw a huge performance boost.\nI had the standard Ubuntu Pangolin install + Google Chrome.  If I opened Google Chrome and opened, say, 10 different webpages, the system would slow right down.  With 2 GB the problem disappeared.\n\nA: Are you spending a lot of time waiting for data to be loaded or written to the hard disk? RAM helps with that. It doesn't make computations faster, it reduces the time the computer pauses between computations because it can't get at the data fast enough.\nIf you want to rely on more objective measurements, open your usual applications and work normally for a bit. Then open a terminal and run the command free -m. You'll see output like this:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          3965       3618        346          0        157        276\n-/+ buffers/cache:       3184        780\nSwap:        16383        774      15609\n\nor\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          1851       1798         52          0        338        489\n-/+ buffers/cache:        971        879\nSwap:        15257         11      15245\n\nLook at the values on the line with -/+ buffers/cache. The one in the “used” column tells you how much of your memory is used for applications proper. The second one tells you how much memory is used to store data that is also on the disk (cache and buffers). On a healthy desktop system where you use multiple applications (say, a web browser and a word processor and a music player and a couple more), the cache and buffers should represent about half the total memory, i.e. the two values on the -/+ buffers/cache line should be roughly the same. This is a crude approximation: 60%/40% is just fine, 80%/20% says you could use RAM. The first system above could use more RAM, the second one is fine.\n\nA: Of course you will see better performance when you will run more processes at a time. But if you run only a few processes then you may not feel it. \n\nA: It also dependes on the distribution you have installed, and the applications you run. On more recent distributions with heavier applications you'll see a better performance.\nIf run like Openbox and you use the terminal most of the times, the performance boost won't be so clear.\n", "Q: Are Discrete Graphic Cards needed to run Unity 3D?

I want to upgrade my system ( I don't want to buy a new one )\nto 2 GB RAM ( 1+1 GB). There is a slot for AGP3 graphics card. But Is Graphic card necessary for Ubuntu 12.04 ?\n\nA: Most of the Motherboard comes with inbuilt Graphics Module, minimum though but enough to run Ubuntu / Linux based system.

As it is mentioned here: https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA/BuildingASourcePackage you have to use debuild -S and then upload your source via the .changes file that is being created.\nSo, what you have to understand is that a package isn't being built by launchpad exactly when you upload your source code for building. So you have to wait some time (usually 10 mins to 1 hour). Then Launchpad starts building your source code into a DEB, depending on what you have specified in your debian/control file. For example, if you have specified that your package is only for the i386 architecture, then it will build a package only for it, but if you have specified Any architecture, then it will build for both i386 and amd64 architectures. The supported architectures are listed here: https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA#Supported_architectures\nTill the package is waiting at the queue, it will be at the \"Needs building\" state, and, as you can understand, the DEB packages haven't been created yet. If the building process is finished, then launchpad provides you with the DEB packages that it produced. You can see the DEB packages on the 'View Package Details':\n\nand then you click at the arrow on the left of the package:\n\nBasically, you can use this so as to build your packages to all the available architectures if you have an i386 machine or so as to distribute your software to more people using the add-apt-repository method. With this method everyone will be able to receive updates from the specific PPA.\n", "Q: Can I install the drivers offered by HP on my Laptop using Wine?

DigiNotar On Wednesday, I installed an old copy of Ubuntu 10.04LTS onto a pristine desktop PC that I built w/ brand new hardware--DSL modem, too--except for the CPU. Then, I downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 from Ubuntu.com, and compared hash values before erasing v10.04 & installing the new OS. The old 10.04 disk & the virgin CD onto which I burned the Ubuntu v12.04 ISO file are the only external media this PC has seen. \nAs a new convert to Open Source & a paranoid ex-Windows user (for good reason), I have been scanning every file I download, and randomly scanning the entire system every few hours, with ClamTk. It found trojans in \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu's built-in Ruby program; \n\n*a Photoshop file and \n\n*a SysInternals tool I downloaded last night; and \n\n*several files in the Firefox cache. \n\n\nAll but one malware specimen belong to the same family. When instructed to quarantine the infected files in the Firefox cache, ClamTk appeared to do so but the quarantine list was empty. As a precaution, I emptied the cache. Note: ClamTk REFUSES to quarantine the infected Ruby & Photoshop files. Is that normal?\nGoogle provided sparse info about the trojans, except they were first noted about 10 years ago. There does seem to be a surge of inquiries about them in Google over the past 2 weeks. It's unlikely that Ruby has had a known trojan all this time, that ClamTk simply ignored till now... I doubt these malware are false-positives.\nSome questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is anyone else finding PUA.Win32.xxxxx with ClamTk? \n\n*Is Ubuntu naturally immune to malware named \"Win32\"? \nActually, what compels me to post here is finding, while I was checking my Firefox Preferences, six DigiNotar entries in the list of security certificates (Advanced-->Encryption-->View Certificates). The IT security world ostracized DigiNotar last Fall, & Mozilla permanently removed DigiNotar from its list of approved certification providers (see http://blog.mozilla.org/security/2011/09/02/diginotar-removal-follow-up/). \nSo, I am wondering:\n\n*Did Ubuntu developers forget to remove DigiNotar from Ubuntu's version of Firefox in v12.04? \n\n*Does anyone else have DigiNotar in your list of certification authorities? \n\n*Are the DigiNotar certificates and the trojans I am finding related?\n\n\nThanks for any information you can provide.\n\nA: *\n\n*If anybody was able to find it successfully, it would be either because of Dual boot in other Partition, Torrents Downloads or Untrusted Third party sharing or Downloading. I never found it in my system.\n\n*Ubuntu is not immune to any trojan named under win32.\nAnd you don't have to worry about that. DigiNotar is Not Trusted by Default. To see, select the Edit trust option under it. So it is as good as non-existent. Just make sure that the option Ask me Every time option is selected.\n\n\n*To confirm, the Security team did address this issue here under version nss (3.12.11-3) unstable; urgency=high stating it as Explicitly Distrust not Deleted, whereas current version stands at nss (3.13.1.with.ckbi.1.88-1ubuntu6.1) precise-security. So you don't have to worry at all.\n\n\n*Actually there are two Certificates menus in Certificate Manager as Server and Authorities. DigiNotar is present in my Server section, the first listed one is Expired, need to delete it manually.\n\n\n*Only the Affected Certificate authority or Security testing team can confirm.\n\nA: *\n\n*No, and not in anything Ruby-related either.\n\n*No, the 'name' of malware doesn't matter. If you mean malware executables intended to run on Windows, then yes, those wouldn't work on Ubuntu.\n\n*I don't think so, Mozilla does that and Debian/Ubuntu just packages stuff, and adds patches and configuration tweaks for their own distro's\n\n*I can't find any such certificates in Firefox on 12.04\n\n*I have no idea, maybe? You mention in the beginning a 'fresh' system, but then you go on saying you find trojans in a Photoshop file, and in stuff you downloaded...\n\n\nA: It seems that you have two systems here - One running Windows and the other Ubuntu - is that clear?\nOne - Your Windows looks like it got a Trojan, and now your Ubuntu has maybe the same Trojan...\nSecondly - Trojans, is malware coming in without you knowing it is actually there, that is why you have an anti-virus to scan an pick it up.\nThirdly - The Trojan went form Windows, over to you Ubuntu installation files - infecting your Ubuntu, while most of the Trojans that comes from (actually all) Windows, won't be able to even run and do anything in Ubuntu, as they are not created for Ubuntu \nFourthly - You can scan and delete things, but with ClamTK, but remember, ClamTk isn't that good, because they don't tent to work on that anti - virus as much, because there shouldn't be viruses, so why creating a supper ClamTk and waste time developing it if they aren't going to use it actually...\nYou can try to install a better anti - virus like Avast, look on Google how to do that, and look what you can do... I doubt that you will have any problem - as Ubuntu is so immune to viruses, and definitely to that Photoshop files. Go into Windows and scan the disk - Hard disk and get it clean from that side, then everything should be fine....\n", "Q: in Ubuntu 10.04 - make your i5 processor run all cores I would like to know if this is possible in Ubuntu 10.04. \nI would like to make my i5 processor run all cores at the same level, bringing the first core down, so that the other cores can work also, and not just the first core,  other wise the computer is making the first core run most of the time at full, while the last core doesn't even go up...\nHope you understand. Is there something?\n\nA: Linux automatically tries to spread each process across the available CPU's as long as Symmetric Multiprocessing is enabled at the kernel level\nlook in /boot/config-(fill in kernel version here) for the following:\nCONFIG_SMP=y\n\nThen at least at the kernel level, processes are attempted to be distributed evenly. \nUnfortunately the situation is slightly more complicated at the user level. Unless a program has Multithread support it may only run on one core. Many process intensive programs do have this, but you may need to enable it with a specific option. \nFor example ffmpeg has the -threads option\nIs there a specific processor intensive program you want to be spread out over the cores?\nAnother thing that may be an issue is the age of the kernel in 10.04 (two years old). With a newer processor, it's possible not all the hooks are in there. You may want to try updating your kernel to the latest version or consider upgrading to a linux distrobution with at 3.0+ version kernel. It looks like there are still significant revisions to how the linux kernel handles the sandy bridge architecture.\n", "Q: mongod fails to start with error: mongod: symbol lookup error: mongod: undefined symbol: _ZN7pcrecpp2RE4InitEPKcPKNS_10RE_OptionsE I am trying to start mongod but I get\n$ mongod\nmongod --help for help and startup options\nmongod: symbol lookup error: mongod: undefined symbol: _ZN7pcrecpp2RE4InitEPKcPKNS_10RE_OptionsE\n\nSearching on google it seems to be related with libpcre; I tried to install last versions of libpcre3 and libpcre++ but it doesn't work.\nMongoDB shell's version (and mongodb-server's version) is 2.0.4.

I am running a program in the terminal that I can't escape with Ctrl-C and that I want to kill. How can I find its PID?\n\nA: If you want only the pid (useful for autokill scripts, etc...)\npgrep -f desired_program_name\n\n\nA: I don't think there is any need of such long commands when you can accomplish the same commands with pgrep, pkill, pidof etc...\nTo get the PID of a running program you can use commands like pgrep or pidof:\npgrep\npgrep [options] pattern\n\npgrep looks through the currently running processes and lists the process IDs which match the selection criteria to stdout.  All the criteria have to match.  For example,\n\n*\n\n*To find process named sshd owned by root.\n$ pgrep -u root sshd\n\n\n\n*List the processes owned by root OR daemon.\n$ pgrep -u root,daemon\n\n\n*List the processes searching the full command line (-f) and list the full command line as well as the process ID (-a).\n$ pgrep -fa needle\n\npidof\npidof finds  the process id's (pids) of the named programs. It prints those id's on the standard output.\npidof program_name\nTo kill a program by pid use pkill. Example:\npkill pid    \npkill -f process_name    \npkill -o process_name    \npkill -n process_name    \npkill -l process_name\n\n\n*\n\n*-f flag: Searches the process_name (see man pkill)\n\n*-o flag: Select only the oldest of the matching processes.\n\n*-n flag: Select only the newest of the matching processes.\n\n*-l flag: List the process name as well as the process ID.\n\n\nA: The easiest way to know the pid of a running program is using:\npidof <application name>\n\nFor example, if you started vim and want to know its pid:\npidof vim\n\nRemember that you will need to provide the exact program name that has been started.\nFor example, if you are running vi and execute pidof vim you won't get correct results.\nRefer to pidof's manual page for more info.\n\nA: I have found it is nice to use a case insensitive search by adding the \"-i\" and using \"aux\" instead of \"ax\" to get a more descriptive output:\nps aux | grep -i firefox\n\nIf you would like to kill all the processes you may use:\nps aux | grep -i firefox | awk {'print $2'} | xargs kill -9\n\nThat is a forceful kill. Drop the \"-9\" if you want a soft kill.\n\nA: For those running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, you must use ps ax and not just ps at the command line, otherwise you will just get the processes spawning from the particular terminal instance that you're in. (usually just 'bash' [the shell you're in] and 'ps' [what you just ran])\n\nA: Open another terminal and run ps ax  | grep foo where foo is the name of the unresponsive program. This should return a line of output  that looks something like this:\n$ ps ax | grep firefox\n2222 ?        S      0:00 /bin/sh /usr/lib/firefox-3.6.9/firefox\n2231 ?        Sl   514:36 /usr/lib/firefox-3.6.9/firefox-bin\n30290 pts/2    S+     0:00 grep --color=auto firefox\n\nThe first field of each line of output is a number which represents the Process ID of the program matched by grep (you can safely ignore the last one, which represents grep itself. \nTo halt the offending process, do:\nkill pid where pid is the Process ID of the program. You might have to use your judgment as to which of the matches needs to be killed, or you could use top instead. Using kill by itself sends SIGTERM, which you should try first as it allows the program to properly clean up after itself. If SIGTERM fails, try SIGHUP, which is stonger medicine: kill -HUP pid. If all else fails, send SIGKILL. But, you should only do so as a last resort, because SIGKILL causes the kernel to terminate the process immediately with no possibility for cleanup. This can at times result in data corruption or other problems. So again, only send SIGKILL as a last resort. To do so, do kill -KILL pid or kill -9 pid.\nIf you are running a graphical interface, of course, you don't have to fool with this crazy command-line stuff to get the job done. Just open \"System Monitor\", navigate to the Processes tab, choose the process you want to halt (Hm, could it be the one using 90% CPU?) and right-click it. Since the process is already stopped, (that's the problem, right?) choose End Process or Kill Process from the resulting menu.\n\nCredit to koanhead\n\n\nA: To get PIDs for all running services, you can use this command:\npstree -p -a\n\n\nA: You can also open another terminal (or switch to another tty) and run top, which is basically a text version of the System Monitor. The first column lists the PID of each running process, which you can kill by pressing K, entering the PID and then entering a numeric signal to send.\n\nA: You could do:\nps ax | grep firefox | cut -f2 -d\" \" - | xargs kill -9\n\nfirst two pipes get process info, next we try to get PID column by using the old-school cut and then we give the resulting PID to kill.\n\nA: top\n\nor\nscreen -list|ls\n\nlist all pid with corresponding process\nkill -[pid]\n\n\nA: sed (stream editor) for process id(s) or pgrep:\necho $(p=\"bash\"; ps -e | sed -E \"s/^ +([[:digit:]]+).+${p}$/# \\1/;s/^[^#].+$//;/^$/d;\" -)\n\n", "Q: How to smooth subtitle fonts in SMPlayer?

Just wondering if anyone successfully ran Frazer in Ubuntu 12.04 with WINE?\nFrazer is an inventory management software for auto dealerships, it's extremely outdated, runs off of a server which provides a *.exe link to access it.

I have tried several times by deleting the account and adding again but nothing i got .Previously its worked but now its not . I am not getting the issue . i can add the account successfully but i am unable to get the mails both new and old. \nEDIT: In trails i have figured out one thing , with IMAP i can get the mail & i can read them . So now i came to a conclusion there is something with POP . \nhelp me to solve this. \nthank you .\n\nA: I'm not sure about this, but I think that only Yahoo Plus accounts can work with email programs like Thunderbird and Outlook. That's what happened when I tried to set up Outlook, so I switched to Google.\n\nA: First - send yourself a e-mail. It doesn't matter if you send the e-mail to your Yahoo e-mail, it will just return successfully. This would determine if the Yahoo inbox is working fine, sending and receiving emails.\nThen test - \"get mail\" in Thunderbird, and look if that email you send to yourself was received by Thunderbird, and that the email is in the inbox.\nSecondly - If that didn't work, look if that email is in the online inbox at Yahoo, and if it is - just make double sure that your settings like the pop3 and smtp is correct. Make also sure that your incoming and outgoing port numbers are correctly - have a look at Yahoo's settings for that...\nThirdly - if that isn't working - double check your offline mode in Thunderbird, you can be offline there, if that isn't the problem. Try using a different email client just to see if it is Thunderbird the problem causing.\nFourthly - if that isn't working, test another email address in Thunderbird if you can, to see if your Yahoo is rejected to Thunderbird, but that shouldn't be a problem. Also have a look at your settings at in your Yahoo online inbox, that you are able to use the account with an email client...

If you do not want to use the ATI Radeon HD5670 you can blacklist the module and it will not load and fall back to the GeForce if modules are available.\n", "Q: Do I need any drivers? I am new to Ubuntu so I have some doubts regarding Ubuntu. My system is Dell Inspiron N4010 with 3GB RAM and preloaded with Windows 64 bit. I would like to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. So I downloaded the 64 bit version. Will it work perfectly on my machine? Last time I used some old versions of Ubuntu and the WiFi was not working properly. Will there be any issue like that?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: You could try the live CD and check if it works or not? It will not install anything to your harddrive, all you have to do is run it from a disk or USB drive.\nThis Ubuntu wiki article is a good place to start with if you are unsure about booting from the live CD. The live CD is essentially a full Ubuntu install, except it runs on CD/DVD/USB, doesn't modify your harddrive in anyway (unless instructed to explicitly) and it does not save any changes you make.  This way you can check if everything you need works or not.  \n\nA: Do I need any drivers?\nYES and NO.  It depends ..\nThe need for additional (or alternate) Ubuntu drivers, particularly for WiFi, is a generally related to two underlying causes.\n\n(1.) The device or platform is so new that the chipset or model is as yet unknown to Ubuntu.\nThis can often be resolved by:\n(a.) Waiting a few weeks, for someone else to find and resolve the issue.  They will then post a comment or workaround.  Often this will simply require a 'blacklist' or settings change, so the new device is not mistaken for a similar (but not identical) device.\n(b.) bleeding edge - Going to the (chipset's) manufacturers website, and downloading and  compiling a custom driver.  While this heroic approach may suit some people, it will often be defeated by the next update, kernel change, or simple be inferior to option (a.) or (c.).\n(c.) Waiting a month (or more), from when the device first reaches the market. By this time any changes or exceptions for this platform will be incorporated into updates that Ubuntu will install on first update (after installation). You will still need to work around wireless issues, i.e. connect first by Ethernet cable, to easily and simply resolve this.\n\n(2.) The device or platform is older, little known, or not intended (by vendor) to support Ubuntu.\nThis can really only be resolved by:\n(a.) Finding and visiting websites dedicated to installing Ubuntu on this platform.  Example would include: HP TouchPad, (various) gaming platforms, embedded designs (including TV decoders), etc.\n(b.) bleeding edge - Going to the (chipset's) manufacturers website, and downloading and  compiling a custom driver.  And not forgetting that this heroic approach will often be defeated by the next update, kernel change, or something else ..\n\nSO ..\nTry to install Ubuntu, and report back (to this forum) on any issues (or success) with your efforts.\n\nA: Live CD is the preferred way to go, if you need to make sure about everything working properly.\nAlthough it won't let you save any modified settings like changing font size of your terminal, or if you want to manually change some settings for your wifi if its not working by default.\nFor the above to work there is tool named Universal USB installer, available for windows, to make Linux work from a thumbdrive, here you can set the persistent file size which acts as a free space where all your data can be saved.\n\nA: You can still try NDisWrapper, if your wifi does not work. It is wrapper around windows wifi drivers.\n", "Q: Windows XP/Ubuntu Dual Boot - Separate Drives - going straight to a GRUB prompt \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? \n\nJust installed Ubuntu for the first time.

In Terminal that is possible by using apt-fast (using Axel). \nBut is it possible to put to work Axel and apt-fast in Synaptic Manager?\nI found this suggestion, but I would not attempt it without the assistance from Ask Ubuntu :)\n\nA: The method in the forum thread (tricking Synaptic by renaming apt-fast to apt-get and vice versa) will not work with Ubuntu, because our Synaptic does not use apt-get. I've verified this by quickly looking at the source code, and also by moving /usr/bin/apt-get elsewhere -- Synaptic still works fine. Synaptic does reuse bits of code from apt-get, and it does use the actual dpkg binaries to perform installation, configuration, etc., but it does not use the apt-get binary.\nAlternatives\n\n*\n\n*I would first recommend trying to find a fast, \"networkically\"-close mirror to try to max out speed. Please see the command-line method in this answer for a very reliable way to do so.\n\n\n*The second is to mark packages to install in Synaptic and then generate a download script from the File menu. This is a bash script with multiple wget -c entries, one for each deb file. Simply use sed -i -e 's/wget -c/axel/g' scriptname to use axel instead, run the script in an empty directory, and then do sudo dpkg -i *.deb.\n\nA: Personally, I would do what LnxSlck said in his comment, set up a VM with Ubuntu and test there.  That would allow you to test without any real issue.  If it breaks, don't do it.  If it works, you can be semi-safe in the idea that it will work correctly without any true incident.\nI tend to do this with every \"test\" i do with Ubuntu, so its a good practice if you dont want to explode your installation by accident.\n", "Q: How can I pair up wiimote plus to my Ubuntu 12.04 machine?

I want to make my application use dynamic unity quicklists. For building my application I am using C++ and the QtCreator IDE. When a menu action is triggered I want to be able to have access to a non-static function of my MainWindow class so as to be able to update the Graphical User Interface which can be accessed from inside 'normal' MainWindow's functions.\nSo, I am building up my quicklist like this (mainwindow.cpp):\nvoid MainWindow::enable_unity_quicklist(){\n    Unity_Menu = dbusmenu_menuitem_new();\n\n    dbusmenu_menuitem_property_set_bool (Unity_Menu, DBUSMENU_MENUITEM_PROP_VISIBLE, FALSE);\n\n    Unity_Stop = dbusmenu_menuitem_new();\n    dbusmenu_menuitem_property_set(Unity_Stop, DBUSMENU_MENUITEM_PROP_LABEL, \"Stop\");\n\n    dbusmenu_menuitem_child_append (Unity_Menu, Unity_Stop);\n\n    g_signal_connect (Unity_Stop, DBUSMENU_MENUITEM_SIGNAL_ITEM_ACTIVATED, G_CALLBACK(&fake_callback), (gpointer)this);\n\n    if(!unity_entry)\n        unity_entry = unity_launcher_entry_get_for_desktop_id(\"myapp.desktop\");\n\n    unity_launcher_entry_set_quicklist(unity_entry, Unity_Menu);\n\n    dbusmenu_menuitem_property_set_bool(Unity_Menu, DBUSMENU_MENUITEM_PROP_VISIBLE, true);\n    dbusmenu_menuitem_property_set_bool(Unity_Stop, DBUSMENU_MENUITEM_PROP_VISIBLE, true);\n}\n\nvoid MainWindow::fake_callback(gpointer data){\n    MainWindow* m = (MainWindow*)data;\n    m->on_stopButton_clicked();\n}\n\nvoid MainWindow::on_stopButton_clicked(){\n   //stopping the process...\n}\n\nmainwindow.h:\nprivate slots:\n   void enable_unity_quicklist();\n   void on_stopButton_clicked();\npublic slots:\n   static void fake_callback(gpointer data);\n\nThis suggestion was taken from http://old.nabble.com/Using-g_signal_connect-in-class-td18461823.html\nThe program crashes immediately after I choose the 'Stop' action from the Unity Quicklist. Debugging the program shows that I am not able to access anything MainWindow related inside the on_stopButton_clicked() without crashing. For example, it crashes when doing this check (which is the first 2 lines of code inside this function):\nif (!ui->stopButton->isEnabled())\n        return;\n\nI have also tested lots of other things that I found at the internet, but nothing of them worked. One interesting solution would be to use gtkmm (http://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm-tutorial/stable/sec-connecting-signal-handlers.html.en) but I am not used at all working on GTK applications (I work solely in Qt) and I don't know if this even suits to my occasion.\n\nA: Edit: okay, after a fair amount of investigation (which involved running valgrind), I have finally managed to figure out what's going on here. Your callback's signature isn't correct.\nThe signature for the static method should be:\nvoid MainWindow::fake_callback(DbusmenuMenuitem *, guint, gpointer data)\n{\n    //...\n}\n\nNotice the addition of DbusmenuMenuitem * and guint. The first is a pointer to the DBus menu item emitting the signal and the second is a timestamp. Both must be present in the signature even if you don't use them.\ng_signal_connect is invoked at runtime and has no way of knowing what parameters your function accepts and blindly just pushes the parameters on the stack assuming that the signatures match. (This differs from what you are probably used to in Qt where the MOC (Meta Object Compiler) generates enough information to know when you are trying to connect a signal to a slot with an incompatible signature.)\n", "Q: What is the best downloading program for ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nGood Download Manager for Ubuntu \n\nI want to know the best downloading program for ubuntu, like IDM(Internet Download Manager) on windows and have the features of IDM .\n\nA: There are a few good graphical download managers, i'll give you a run by some of my favorite:\n\n\n*\n\n*ProzGui - Provides the user with a windows environment that allows to manage the ProZilla download manager with greater ease. This comes in very handy to accelerate the speed of our download, because it uses a technique that consists in dividing the files in various parts to be able to download them simultaneously from various servers.\n\n*KGet - If you use KDE this comes installed by default.\n\n*Downloader for X (d4x)\nDownloader for X is a powerful graphical download manager. It supports both HTTP(S) and FTP protocols and has nice graphical user interface, though some actions can also be performed using the command line.\nAmong others, its key features include proxy and SOCKS5 support, recursive downloading, wildcard matching, download scheduler, multiple download queues and more…\nInstall d4x in Ubuntu\nsudo aptitude install d4x\n\n\n*Gwget (frontend to wget) - it’s a download manager for the Gnome Desktop. The main features are:\n-Resume: By default, gwget tries to continue any download.\n-Notification: Gwget tries to use the Gnome notification area support, if available. You can close the main window and gwget runs in the background.\n-Recursivity: Gwget detects when you put a html, php, asp or a web page dir in the url to download, and ask you to only download certain files (multimedia, only the index, and so on).\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag & Drop: You can d&d a url to the main gwget window or the notification area icon to add a new download.Firefox\n\n\nInstall GwGet in Ubuntu\nsudo apt-get install gwget\n\n\n*wxDownload  - wxDownload Fast (also known as wxDFast) is an open source download manager. It is multi-platform and builds on Windows(2k,XP), Linux and Mac OS X(binary still not available). Besides that, it is a multi-threaded download manager. This means that it can split a file into several pieces and download the pieces simultaneously.\n\nA: Aria2, supports all functions you can imagine.\nMulti-Connection Download\naria2 can download a file from multiple sources/protocols and tries to utilize your maximum download bandwidth. Really speeds up your download experience.\nLightweight\naria2 doesn't require much memory and CPU time. The physical memory usage is typically 4MiB (normal HTTP/FTP downloads) to 9MiB (BitTorrent downloads). CPU usage in BitTorrent with download speed of 2.8MiB/sec is around 6%.\nsource and download\n\nA: I would recommend JDownloader. It is really great download manager with the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Platform independent. (Windows, Linux, Mac, ..)\n\n*Runs on Java 1.5 or higher\n\n*Complete Open-Source (GPL)\n\n*Download several files at once\n\n*Download with multiple connections\n\n*JD has an own powerful OCR module\n\n*Automatic extractor (including password list search) (Rar archives)\n\n*Theme Support\n\n*Multilingual\n\n*About 110 hoster and over 300 decrypt plug-ins\n\n*Reconnect with JDLiveHeaderScripts: (1400 router supported)\n\n*Webupdate\n\n*Integrated package manager for additional modules (eg.

I've seen many articles about HOW to install Java. My question is WHICH one should I install for Java development? OpenJDK 6, OpenJDK 7, Oracle Java 6, or Oracle Java 7? Some sites tell me to install Oracle Java 6 AND 7, some say just 7. So, what are the advantages and disadvantages of them both?\n\nA: It clearly depends on which Java version you might want to develop on. Please see this link for the differences between Java 6 and Java 7. Some sites suggest java 6 because it is considered to be more stable than 7. Please note that anything you can do with java version 6, you can do with 7 too.\nIf I were in your shoes, I would use the OpenJDK 7, but be sure to download the SDK and not the runtime if you want to be able to do software development with. I do not know if it is 100% compliant with the Oracle version of Java, however it should be enough to cover most developer's needs.\n", "Q: How to set a short password on Ubuntu? When I install the Ubuntu, I set a short password(<4). Now I want to change the other short password by \"passwd\" or change passphrase on \"Password and Keys\" program, it needs a password >4 char.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.04 none of other solutions worked for me. I had to replace both of these lines:\npassword    requisite                   pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=8 difok=3 dcredit=-1 enforce_for_root lcredit=-1 ocredit=-1 reject_username ucredit=-1\npassword    [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so obscure use_authtok try_first_pass sha512\n\nin /etc/pam.d/common-password with:\npassword    [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so minlen=2 sha512\n\nThese changes let me changed my password easily and after changing password I restored file to it's original form.\n\nA: To set up a simple password, I tried the simple sudo passwd username method, but it failed on my Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS.\nSo I tried to remove the obscure option from /etc/pam.d/common-passwd config file, but it still failed.\nSo I also removed the obscure option from /usr/share/pam-configs/unix config file. And then it worked :-)\nI do agree that it should be simplier, when acting as su to set up a weak password, whatever the reason why one wants to do it! A warning saying \"weak password, confirm?\" would be perfect...\n\nA: By default, Ubuntu requires a minimum password length of 6 characters, as well as some basic entropy checks. These values are controlled in the file /etc/pam.d/common-password, which is outlined below.\npassword        [success=2 default=ignore]      pam_unix.so obscure sha512\n\nIf you would like to adjust the minimum length to 4 characters, add the appropriate variable (minlen=4) to the end of the line. The modification is outlined below.\npassword        [success=2 default=ignore]      pam_unix.so obscure sha512 minlen=4\n\nSource.\n\nA: Bring up a terminal and edit /etc/pam.d/common-password\nChange this line:\npassword    [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so obscure sha512\n\nto:\npassword    [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so obscure sha512 minlen=4\n\nPassword also need a certain amount of complexity, as specified by the obscure parameter above.\npassword    [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so minlen=2 sha512\n\nremoves that check also.\nThis all presupposes that you think this is wise.\nSee man pam_unix\nThese work on my system.\n\nA: Use following command in Terminal:\nsudo passwd <user>\n\nReplace <user> with the username whose password you wish to change.\nThis works because passwd suppresses all checks for length or entropy when you use it as the root user.\n\nWarning: if the target user has an encrypted home directory, this will\n  cause problems!\n  (see comments below)\n\n\nA: This can be done with PAM pwdfile module.\nThe way described here changes only the desktop login (lightdm service), but can be applied to other services as well if you wish.\nAlso, this allows you to have your original strong password for \"sudo\", while maintaining a fairly easy way to login to Ubuntu desktop.\nCommands can be issued in the terminal program.\nInstalling the software\nFirst, we install a software package named libpam-pwdfile:\nsudo apt-get install libpam-pwdfile\n\nCreating the user-password file\nWe will then create the user/password file. You will be prompted to enter a new PIN password. Your password will be encrypted and saved to a file named passwd.like\npinpass=$(mkpasswd -5)\necho \"$pinpass\" | sudo tee /etc/passwd.like\n\nAlternatively, you may use: openssl passwd -1 yourpinpasswordhere and create a file named /etc/passwd.like and that password.\nSetting up the desktop login service\nThe next step is to prepare the desktop login service to accept the PIN password before other password procedures. I've mentioned already the name of the desktop login service, lightdm.\nTake a look at the file:\ncat /etc/pam.d/lightdm\n\nIf you don't have this file, then your desktop (login) service is a different one, and you should find your desktop manager before going further. As explained before, this guide is for Ubuntu 16.04 but can be used for other login services as well.\nIt could be useful if you also create a backup:\nsudo cp /etc/pam.d/lightdm /etc/pam.d/lightdm.backup\n\nNow, you may edit the file using nano or gedit or any other text editor:\nsudo gedit /etc/pam.d/lightdm\n\nAt the top of the file mine had:\n#%PAM-1.0\nauth    requisite       pam_nologin.so\nauth    sufficient      pam_succeed_if.so user ingroup nopasswdlogin\n@include common-auth\n\nI have modified it like so:\n#%PAM-1.0\nauth requisite pam_nologin.so\nauth sufficient pam_succeed_if.so user ingroup nopasswdlogin\nauth required pam_pwdfile.so pwdfile=/etc/passwd.like\nauth required pam_permit.so\n#@include common-auth\n\nSave the file and close your text editor.\nLog out and log back in.\nYou should be able to use the PIN password you set. By following this guide, the PIN password is only used for the desktop login service, not for the password of sudo commands. \nSource: http://blog.radevic.com/2017/11/how-to-set-pin-password-or-short.html\n", "Q: How to uninstall LibreOffice? Which package should I remove to completely remove libreoffice?  I have no need for office tools.\nThat's the one gripe I have with package managers like apt, there's no simple way to perform the essential task of removing unwanted software :S\n\nA: In 16.04+ removing this is slightly easier.  You only need to issue one slightly different command.  I should add the old way still works as well if you like using it.\nsudo apt purge \"libreoffice*\"\n\n\nA: On newer Ubuntu versions (16.04+, maybe earlier), just to provide an up-to-date answer (the others work too):\nsudo apt purge -y libreoffice*\nThis does the whole job, including autoremove and stuff.\n\nA: Type the following in terminal to remove libreoffice:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge libreoffice*\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nNote that some terminals (e.g. zsh) will require the wildcard to be escaped:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge libreoffice\\*\n\n\nA: Use synaptic manager. Just download it, and mark for uninstall.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nAfter installation, open synaptic manager as superuser.\nsudo synaptic\n\nNow, find LibreOffice in the search bar. Right click, and choose \"mark for complete installation\".\nAfter that, click \"apply\" in the menu bar. Done\n1\n\nA: An especially thorough removal technique.\nSuitable generally, but especially when removing LibreOffice to replace it with a manually installed LibreOffice or OpenOffice.\nAssuming LibreOffice is provided by official Ubuntu packages on your system (which it generally is, unless you've installed it yourself from other packages or from the LibreOffice website), you can thoroughly remove it in the Terminal:\nsudo apt-get remove fonts-opensymbol libreoffice libreoffice-\\* openoffice.org-dtd-officedocument1.0 python\\*-uno uno-libs3-\\* ure ure-dbg\n\nIf you want to remove global configuration files too (this does not affect per-user configuration in users' home directories), replace remove with purge.\nI think it's unlikely that removing any of this will break other programs, because Lubuntu doesn't come with LibreOffice, and Lubuntu users are able to run just about any Ubuntu program, without having to install LibreOffice.\nStill, that is a legitimate concern and I cannot guarantee that nothing depends on your existing LibreOffice installation. Fortunately, the most serious breakages can be averted by making sure that nothing you need is removed with the LibreOffice packages. You can either be very careful while running the removal command (watch out for whatever else it says will be uninstalled), or simulate the removal first:\napt-get -s remove fonts-opensymbol libreoffice libreoffice-\\* openoffice.org-dtd-officedocument1.0 python\\*-uno uno-libs3-\\* ure ure-dbg\n\n(That is, put -s right after apt-get, and, optionally, remove the sudo.)\nI haven't heard about any problems arising from removing fonts-opensymbol but those are fonts, and not enough people remove the package to know if problems viewing documents are common. So if the simulation reveals that a number of other packages you need or are unfamiliar with would be removed, try simulating without removing fonts-opensymbol and see what happens. And you might decide just not to remove that one at all.\nThe above technique uninstalls all LibreOffice packages provided in Ubuntu. I got the list of packages from here.\nTo shorten the command and avoiding having to type the name of every individual package, and also potentially to extend the life of this procedure in case differently named packages are provided in later versions of LibreOffice, I used the * wildcard to cover many packages at once. It is itself escaped with \\ so that it won't be expanded by the shell into the name of some unrelated file or directory, before it is passed on to apt-get.\nRelated: How to replace LibreOffice with OpenOffice?\n\nA: Hmm, the easiest way should be to use the software manager. uninstall libre-office from there. if you didnt manualy installed certain by libre-office needed libs (uno, ure) those libs will be also uninstalled automaticaly.\n\nA: Here's another way I found (at libre-software.net):\nTo remove prior installations of LibreOffice:\nsudo apt-get remove libreoffice-core\n\nIf you also want to remove LibO configuration files, use the purge switch:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge libreoffice-core\n\n\nSo, by \"main package\", gemue2010 probably meant \"libreoffice-core\". The \"clean\" and \"autoremove\" arguments to apt-get that karthick87 provided are always a good idea.\nWhile I appreciate the command-line (terminal) as much as the next enthusiast, I like having a GUI front-end alternative, a mouse-only solution to trivial matters. In this case, in Synaptic, you can mark the libreoffice-core package for complete removal, and it offers to remove the following additional (related/dependant) packages as well:\n\nlibreoffice-base libreoffice-base-core libreoffice-calc\n  libreoffice-draw libreoffice-gnome libreoffice-gtk\n  libreoffice-help-en-us libreoffice-impress libreoffice-math\n  libreoffice-ogltrans libreoffice-pdfimport\n  libreoffice-presentation-minimizer libreoffice-writer python3-uno\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a seasoned linux user, in fact I'm new to this world. I realize this method may not be satisfactory to some, and this answer may come too late to be of any use to the original asker, but I'm only sharing my findings in hopes they will be of use to others looking for something like this. So while this method might not remove all associated packages, some of which have been mentioned, it seems safer and good enough at removing most of the packages, to me, so maybe for others as well. Lastly, a note: in my case, mint-meta-xfce is also among the packages to be removed.\n\nA: As a corollary, you can use aptitude to search for which packages to uninstall:\naptitude search '~i' | grep libreoffice\n\nwhich returns a list of all installed packages that contain the text 'libreoffice'. Grep is neat!\nThen use apt-get to remove the main package that you have installed, and apt-get autoremove will remove all the smaller packages which are no longer necessary. Hope that piece of advice helps!\n\nA: This will uninstall ALL libreoffice packages in ubuntu 16.04\nsudo apt-get autoremove -y libreoffice-\\*\n\nA: With zsh this doesn't work:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge libreoffice*\n\nit gives this zsh: no matches found: libreoffice*\nThis does work:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge libreoffice\\*\n\n\nA: To completely remove LibreOffice with all its dependencies:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge -y libreoffice*\n\nRemove the unneeded packages that were once installed as a dependency for it:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nRemove the retrieved packages from the local cache:\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nCheck that it was completely removed:\ndpkg --list | grep libreoffice*\n\n\nA: To uninstall it on Fedora:\nsudo dnf remove -y libreoffice* libobasis*\n\nTo also remove the user profile:\nrm -rf /home/$USER/.config/libreoffice\n\n", "Q: How do I access my previous ubuntu disk when booted to usb key When prompted about the upgrade to 12.04 I clicked yes.

(12.04) After spending hours trying to get my wired Comcast Internet to work on Ubuntu, I thought I had finally got it to work when I discovered that I needed to set it as a static IP by setting the Ipv4 as manual and filling in the required information (I was able to see the up and down arrows afterwards). It only took a few minutes to realize I still had more work to do. Firefox pages load indefinitely and downloads from the software center stay in waiting mode. My question is, what did I do wrong?\nMy stats and such:\nMac is BC:AE:C5:99:FD:14\n\n(For cloned I just put the same). \nI don't think there is any 802.1x security so I left it unchecked. \nIP is 24.23.188.52.\nSubnet mask is 255.255.255.0.\nGateway is 192.168.1.1.\nDns servers are 75.75.75.75, 75.75.76.76, 192.168.1.1, 208.67.222.222.\nSearch domains I didn't know any so I put google.com (that's probably the issue but I don't know).\nAlso Ipv6 I left as Automatic.\nMy pc is dual booted with Windows 7 64bit and Ubuntu 12.04 64bit.\nEDIT: Ok, I tried NlightNfotis's directions, here is what happened:\nPinging www.askubuntu.com returned tradping: unknown host www.askubuntu.com  Doing traceroute returned the program 'traceroute' can be installed in the following packages:  inetutils-traceroute \n traceroute\nIt then told me I could install it with sudo apt-get, and I tried that but it \"could not find the package\"\nAdding 8.8.8.8 to DNS did nothing, unfortunately.\n 8.8.4.4 does nothing also.\nI am very new to Linux and Ubuntu, by the way.\nSetting the connection to DHCP doesn't disconnect it, but the internet still refuses to load anything. \nStill have nothing, netstat -nr doesnt show any items under any category.\nHere is a random pic with data, maybe it'll help.\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/view/?zk2yjn7khfocf94# (IPv4 from when its on manual)\nAny and all help is appreciated.\n\nA: Try to set your DNS server to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (Google's public dns servers) and see if this shows any changes.\nAlso try to change the network settings from manual mode to Automatic (DHCP).

Things having been working fine, but a few minutes ago I copied a 14Gb file and it said it had copied the file very quickly--so quickly I don't believe it. I was hoping that someone could give me some insight into what Ubuntu is doing here. Is it just making some sort of link to the file or perhaps continuing to copy the file in the background and not telling me? Thankyou :)\n\nA: Generally you will see a progress bar if you use Nautilus to do the copy, however a key part of how Linux gets great disk performance is through disk buffering.  At any time a large proportion of the available free RAM can be given over to disk buffering.\nYou can get some idea how this is working if you type\nfree\n\nin a terminal window.  Under the Column 'free' you will see three figures.  The first is the actual free memory, while the second is the free memory less disk buffering.  The third figure is of course free swap memory, which we are not really concerned with here.\nIf you are copying a file from one partition to another you should indeed see a progress bar and it should take an appreciable amount of time. An icon for it will appear immediately in the target folder (in Nautilus) however.\nAnother key point is that if you are actually moving a large file on the same partition then it really takes no time at all since only the logical pointers to the data need to be changed.\n", "Q: Bluetooth headset A2DP works, HSP/HFP not (no sound/no mic) My Philips SBH9001 headset pairs fine using Ubuntu 12.04.

I get to the part where it asks to install the boot-loader into the Windows 7 MBR on the main hard drive so of course I say no, but then it asks where instead I would like to install it, I type in the name of the unencrypted volume on the thumb drive /dev/sdb1 but it gives an error and will not install. \nAm I doing something wrong? Any help is appreciated as I am about to have a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nA: I have extracted everything from here. Pasted the important parts here incase the link goes dead.\nDelete the partition table for the devices that will be used. This will delete everything on the selected device, so make sure that you have everything backed up on external media.\nCreate a new partition for the boot files.\nThe boot partition must be unencrypted for the system to boot.\nNo more than 256MB is needed for this partition and it can be kept on a usb drive for extra security.\nThe file system should be set to Ext4 and set the mount point “/boot”.\nSince this is the boot partition, “Bootable flag” should be “on.”\nCreate another partition to be an encrypted volume for the swap space.\nThe size of this partition varies depending on the computer. Personally, I make it around 2xRAM.\nSet “Use as” to “Physical for Encryption.”\nCreate a third partition for the root file system that should be around 6GB.\nSelect “Physical for Encryption” on this partition, also.\nThe last space that needs to be defined is the home partition which will be encrypted by Ubuntu and decrypted at user log in. This is where documents, pictures, music, desktop files and downloads are stored.\nMake this partition any size that you’d like.\nPersonally, I use separate physical disks for my home folder and system files.\nChoose “Ext4″ at the “Use as” prompt.\nSet “Mount point: /home”.\nWith the partitions created, the swap and root volumes need to be configured:\nSelect “Configure encrypted volumes.”\nThen “Create encrypted volumes.”\nHighlight and select the volumes that are listed as “crypto” by pressing spacebar, then continue.\nEnter a strong passphrase for each encrypted volume. This is the passphrase that you will be required before the system will mount the volumes and boot.\nFinish and write changes\nEach encrypted volume will now have space available inside of it. To configure these volumes, select the space listed under each encrypted volume.\nSetup the first encrypted volume as swap space (choose this option under “Use as”).\nThe second encrypted volume, which was previously reserved for root system files, should be set to Ext4 and set the mount point to: “/”.\nThe final configuration should contain:\nEncrypted volume > Swap space\nEncrypted volume > Ext4, Root (“/”) volume\nUnencrypted Ext4 Boot partition\nUnencrypted Ext4 Home partition.\nWith everything setup, select “Finish partitioning and write changes to disk” and continue through the remaining installation prompts.\nCreate a username and password (different than encrypted disk passphrase)\nWhen asked to “Encrypt your home directory”, select “Yes”.\nThis actually encrypts the user folder inside of the home directory but not the home partition itself.\nThe first time that the first user logs in to Ubuntu, a strong key is generated and can be recorded at that time. This is different than the passphrase(s) used for the root and swap partitions.\nAt the prompt regarding GRUB boot loader, select “yes” to install it on the master boot record, changing this could result in your system not booting.\nAfter rebooting, Ubuntu will prompt for a preboot authentication passphrase that’s needed to unlock encrypted system disks. With this method there will be a prompt for the swap disk and one for the system disk, even if the passphrases are identical. In my experience, there will be an error on boot that says: “No video mode active”, this is caused by missing font files and is nothing to worry about it.\n", "Q: No Sound detected in Ubuntu 12.04 After executing lspci, this is the output:\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 82X38/X48 Express DRAM Controller (rev 01)\n00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82X38/X48 Express Host-Primary PCI Express Bridge (rev 01)\n00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #4 (rev 02)\n00:1a.1 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #5 (rev 02)\n00:1a.2 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #6 (rev 02)\n00:1a.7 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB2 EHCI Controller #2 (rev 02)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 02)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 1 (rev 02)\n00:1c.2 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 3 (rev 02)\n00:1c.4 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 5 (rev 02)\n00:1c.5 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 6 (rev 02)\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #1 (rev 02)\n00:1d.1 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #2 (rev 02)\n00:1d.2 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #3 (rev 02)\n00:1d.7 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB2 EHCI Controller #1 (rev 02)\n00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801 PCI Bridge (rev 92)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation 82801IR (ICH9R) LPC Interface Controller (rev 02)\n00:1f.2 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82801IR/IO/IH (ICH9R/DO/DH) 4 port SATA Controller [IDE mode] (rev 02)\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) SMBus Controller (rev 02)\n00:1f.5 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) 2 port SATA Controller [IDE mode] (rev 02)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI RV670 [Radeon HD 3870]\n01:00.1 Audio device: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI RV670/680 HDMI Audio [Radeon HD 3690/3800 Series]\n02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 12)\n03:00.0 IDE interface: JMicron Technology Corp.

Lets say the brightness increases by 1 unit. How do I make it increase by 0.5 units? I hope you understand my question. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit. If thats important.\n\nA: Using xbacklight you can increase or decrease your brightness by whatever percent you prefer.\nxbacklight -set 1\n\nor xbacklight -set 0.5\nit accepts integer of even fractions.\n\nA: Sometimes it is only possible to increase and decrease it by a sections like from 1 to 3 any nothing in between can be selected, otherwise you should get software that you can get a slider so you can manually slide the brightness according to your preferences. \nBetter explained, using the sound as an example. By using the shortcut on you keyboard, the sound can also just increase and decrease by amounts that is default by the key, when you use the slider of the window of the computer, then you can manually change it to 0.5 or 0.8 just as you would like it.\nHope you understand, so look for something that can bring up a slider for the brightness - there should be software on the internet.... \n", "Q: Monitor and Ubuntu screen resolution don't match Few days ago I manage to have 1366x768 resolution option in my Ubuntu 12.04 (nvidia x driver), but the screen (fiscal) and the option resolution in the system settings under monitor, doesn't match each other, I have chosen 1366x768 as the option, but seems that in the screen its just show 1280x768 this is the image : \n\nOn the right hand side is nvidia x setting and the left is monitor resolution. Should both be on the same setting or doesn't it matter?\nShould I only focus on the setting that is reflecting in Ubuntu 12.04 by the system setting monitor?\nWhat about the refresh rate, does that play a role to improve the viewing and my driver for my graphics? \n\nA: i mabey think the answer you are looking for are bumblebee for your GFX card. \ni am not sure but i think it is.\nhttp://bumblebee-project.org/\nBut give it a try ;)\n", "Q: Wubi Grub Prompt \"Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported\" I just installed Ubuntu today with WUBI.

For the first word, TAB \nlists possible command completions. Anywhere else TAB lists \npossible device or file completions.\n\nGRUB>\n\nI tried repeatedly to reboot, and no luck. What is wrong?\n\nA: Follow the steps below one by one.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the Ubuntu Live cd/usb and select \"try ubuntu\".\n\n*When the desktop is loaded, download the boot script. It contains script and a changelog file.\n\n*Now cd to the directory of the extracted zip file.\n\n*sudo bash boot_info_script.sh\nThe above steps should get you through.\n\n\nA: When the machine first froze, did you just switch it off, because you did not know how to regain control? If so, you have probably corrupted the file system and that has apparently prevented grub finding its files.\nThe first thing to try is to boot from the livecd, open a terminal, type su to become root, enter the root password (root for a standard livecd) when prompted, and then run fsck -fy /dev/sdax where ax is the letter and number of your pclos partitions. To find out which they are you can use fdisk -l (that's a lower-case 'L'). You don't need to (and can't, in fact) fsck the swap, but the / and /home or whatever you have need to be done. They must be unmounted, but should be by default with the livecd. If not, use umount /dev/sdax to unmount them.\n", "Q: How to partition HDD and dual boot Ubuntu with Windows 7 (first installed win7) \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I set up a dual boot Windows  and Ubuntu? \n\nHello'World'!\nI am coming from another planet (Windows planet) but i'm friendly and i hope you are also !?!\nI recently bought a new hardware (a laptop) because i got accepted at a good Computer Science University in my country .\nI also heard that we're going to study Linux alot so i thought why not getting started with it . I tryed some Virtualization in Windows for Kubuntu 8.x(an older version)  and now Ubuntu 12.04 .\nFor a few days now i'm getting more into Linux, and i decided to not just use it in VirtualBox. \nSo i kept on this new machine, when i partitioned it,  some unallocated/free space (as you see from the screenshot) to install Ubuntu on it .( Note that i allocated for other partitions the exact size that i wanted by using 1GB=1024 MB -joke :) ).\nhttp://s17.postimage.org/kr0mtkhfz/Capture.png\nNow, even though i'm a tourist here , i managed to do a live usb for ubuntu and some additional repair tools on it if necessary.\nBut when it comes to how to partition the 100.66 GB left i'm blocked out. Here's what i want to have :\n\n\n*\n\n*a partition with Ubuntu installed - which i want to make it PRIMARY (the forth and last one i can) but i don't know how much space should i use (for Windows 7 on C: i kept 50 giga)\n\n*the required partition for system repair  or Ubuntu creates this automatically?\n\n*the swap partition and size more or even 4 gb RAM , should i go more than 4 GB ? Windows's page file is bigger but i wanted to shrink it anyway\n\n*the partition where to keep most user files/games/kits i don't remind exactly but is this called home/ partition ? Should i make it fat32 so i can make this a \"shared with win partition\" ?\n\n\nOH MY GOD when did i wrote so much text ?!?! ...\nPlease , if you're still here, tell me your opinion about how should i allocate the free space considering what i said before \n\nA: If you have three partitions already, the best course of action is to create an Extended Partition with the remaining Linux logical partitions inside.\nSince you already have an extended partition, there is no problem creating as many logical partitions as you need from the unallocated space in the picture.\nIf I understand correctly you should create:\n\n\n*\n\n*A root partition for Ubuntu (/). This should be ext4, or whatever the current default is.\n\n*\n\n*A home partition for Ubuntu (/home). You should NOT use fat32, since it is a really old system with many problems. A better choice is ext3 -- there are windows drivers with read/write support that exist for it (http://www.fs-driver.org/ is one).\n\n*A swap partition (swap space). This is necessary for linux, and should be the same size as your RAM.\n\n\n\nThese are pretty much standard.\nHope that helps!\nsemitones\n", "Q: Issue while installing Ubuntu 12.04.1. \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install Ubuntu?\nWhat's the right terminology for Unity's UI elements? \n\nI am trying to install Ubuntu 12.04.1 through a usb stick following the instructions (which ones?) but I am stuck at the second step because I do not know what dash is to search for the Startup Disk Creator.\nCould someone explain to me what Dash is and how can I find it?\n\nA: Welcome to AskUbuntu. Dash is the 1st button (by default) of the Unity Sidebar on your left (which has many application launchers). By pressing that button, you get access to a nice interface which is very similar (in purpose) to what the windows start menu is.\nAs for the program you want to run, you can find it here:\n\n", "Q: How to make annotations on .PDF files like on Okular, but without using Okular? What .PDF viewer should I use? So guys, I'm answering some question from a school test (saved in .pdf) and I would like to do it like I did once on Okular, using a cursor-pen to mark the alternatives. Like on this screenshot from Okular official website. As you can see, he traced the title with a cursor-pen, this is what I want to do. And I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 not Kubuntu.\n\n\nA: You can try Xournal:\n\nI don't have it on my system right now, but it's a good program for this purpose.\n\nA: Why not use Okular? You could see if non-opensource readers like foxit or adobe have that feature, but they would be far less native than Okular. KDE apps actually don't look as bad in Ubuntu anymore.\n\nA: The evince package which is built-in in Ubuntu and is called Document Viewer can add annotations to PDFs. Starting with Ubuntu 15.04, Document Viewer can also remove annotations. Evince 3.18.2 from the Ubuntu 16.04 default repositories has support for adding highlight annotations, as well as squiggly highlight annotations and moving text annotations.\nIf you do not have a visible side pane on the left side of the opened document's window, click View -> Side Pane or press F9 to make the side pane visible. At the top of this side pane, there is a dropdown menu with options like Thumbnails, Index and Annotations (some of which may be dimmed for some documents).\nTo create an annotation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Annotations from the dropdown menu. You should now see List and Add tabs under the dropdown menu.\n\n\n*Select the Add tab.\n\n*Click on the icon to add a text annotation.\n \n\n*Click on the spot in the document window you would like to add the annotation to, preferably a blank spot where the annotation will not cover anything else in the document. Your annotation window will open.  \n\n*Type your text into the annotation window. You can resize the note by clicking and holding the left mouse button on one of the bottom corners of the note, and moving it around. \n\n*Close the note by clicking on the x in the top corner of the note. You might need to hover over the x with the mouse to make it visible.\n", "Q: Can't install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 because it says I have multiple operating systems I am completely new to Ubuntu but am looking forward to giving it a shot. \nI downloaded 12.04 64-bit and burned it to a DVD. Booted my laptop from the DVD and tried to install it alongside Windows 7 64-bit, but it says that my laptop has multiple OS and it only gives me the option to either erase the disk and install or the advanced install. \nAs far as I know the only OS I have is Windows 7 64-bit. Has this happened to anyone else? Is there a way to fix this?\n\nA: Click on the advanced install and your hard drive partition information will appear. You could have a recovery partition that is preventing Ubuntu from automatically making a partition for you. Post the hard drive info that the advanced installation option reports if you want some help deciding how to install.\n", "Q: different icons on different workspaces When I install an icon on one workspace it is installed on all four workspaces. Is it possible to install different icons on different workspaces? I am using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: Not an expert answer, but to the best of my knowledge, every default icon setting appears to be global in scope. Unity Tweak Tool, Gnome Tweak Tool, Gconf editor, Ubuntu Tweak (not a distribution package), and any other method appear to have a single, unified theme and icon set. The workspace settings in gconf-editor were deprecated after Gnome 2.12, and even then, don't believe individual workspaces with unique icons were available.\nIt is a nice idea, but the code around that idea is not at present available to the best of my knowledge.\n", "Q: Correct Display configuration.

I believe the problem has something to do with the rotation it is set up. My Ubuntu Display application has only clockwise and counterclockwise options for the TV display. I really don't know why this is happening.\n\n*Basic procedure: Plug in cable, did not get the resolution I wanted. Changed settings, applied them. Re-peat until desired display is shown.

Also, note the TV1 unknown connection which I have no idea what it is.\nNote, also, that this has nothing to do with the display since W7 on the computer works fine and since while boot up, and also, before starting session in ubuntu the rotation is normal.\nI'll also mention that I HAVE re-installed Ubuntu since I had posted this question from a Live CD of 12.04 LTS. And that before the posting of the question also using 12.04 before another backup that I had to do, the VGA setup was fine without any problems.\n\nA: I don't think the problem has anything to do with the rotation of the screen. If you think so because of the word \"inverted\" on the output from xrandr, don't worry. That word is always there even if your setup is not inverted.\nI believe you are getting that error because your hardware doesn't support Unity 3D at that resolution. If my guess is correct, you will need to switch to Unity 2D, which is less demanding in terms of graphics.\nIn order to do that, go to the login screen (the screen before you start the session), click on the Ubuntu icon to the right of your username and select Ubuntu 2D. Then log in and try to set the desired resolution.\n\nA: I had the same issue.  I resolved it by using ARandR.  There is a nice little GUI interface that you can find by searching for the application.\n\nA: I had this error (exceeds 3D hardware limit (2048, 2048)) also with an old Toshiba with Linux Mint. I had a laptop with a screen 1280x800 and a monitor 1980x1080. I Solved the problem by placing the displays on top of each other.

If you run  apt-cache search linux-headers, you'll see there are many different versions. To install the correct version, run\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\nThis will automatically install the linux-headers for your particular system. After this point, the rest of the commands (make, etc) should work fine.\nAnd regarding copying/pasting in the terminal versus elsewhere: Ctrl+Shift+C copies text you've selected in the terminal, whereas Ctrl+C copies text you've selected elsewhere (e.g., Firefox/Chrome). Similarly, use Ctrl+Shift+V to paste in the terminal and Ctrl+V to paste elsewhere.\n", "Q: Which players are known to be able or not to be able to play DVD saved as a directory on a Toshiba AC100 (ARM) The answer to this question should help one to choose the player to run in Ubuntu 12.04 on Toshiba AC100 (ARM) if one wants to play a DVD saved in a directory in the filesystem.

The first error I encountered, (just like the first time Unity came out - after witch I waited to try Ubuntu again until now) is, that it hanged after login at the desktop wallpaper, with only the mouse cursor. Well actually the first problem was with the live CD, but I managed to install it, using the install now, not the try now. Live CD has the same problem, as after install. \nSo, after installing and getting the error, I searched of course before asking this:) \nI found this: Ubuntu hangs at purple screen\nThe accepted answer there helped me to get to this. (note, that the below picture is a screen taken from a working desktop, and then erased the parts that don't show on mine.)\n\nNote that there is nothing at the top except the brown bar. No shutdown button, no nothing. The system hangs, I can't click on anything, I can only wiggle around with my mouse XD \n\nA: So I continued my research. \nFor testing purposes I've installed gnome3 from the console. After that I've noticed a mistake I've made. I've forgotten to test the Ubuntu 2D desktop enviroment.\nSo I did it quick, and Ubuntu 2D works perfect. Then I've tried gnome. Gnome3 and Gnome classic do the same thing as the Unity desktop. Namely freeze. So I've tried Gnome classis(no effects) and of course, that works. \nSo conclusion: \nUnity/Gnome/Gnome Classic - produce the same problem\nUnity 2D/Gnome Classic (no effects) - work flawless\nThen I've decided to reinstall my ati drivers using: What is the correct way to install proprietary ATI Catalyst Video Drivers (fglrx) directly from AMD?\nThe outcome remained the same.\nOf course I've confirmed if the drivers were working using: \"fglrxinfo\"\nAnd they are working.\nThen I've decided to try out some games. And the outcome: the games work 100% no problem. \nAt this point I'm done with trying, and accepted the fact, that this is the best thing I can get, at this point in time.\nFinal thoughts.\nThe first time Unity came out, the problem stuck at the drivers. No games would work, all would freeze. Only Gnome classic (no effects) worked at that time. I'm happy to see, that this is some form of improvemen. Because altough I can't use the defauld desktop, I can use Ubuntu the way I want, well at least to this point in time. Video card demanding thigs seem to work correctly, desktop is usable. The problem I have is, that in this state Ubuntu isn't as user friendly as it wants to be. You can't give somebody an Install disk and rest easy, because you know, that there will be something wrong. In my opinion, Ubuntu takes steps forward, but unfortunately it also takes steps backward. Well the final test will of course be, steam and Left 4 Dead 2, if it really comes out. \nThank you for your time. \n", "Q: Suspend not properly working with ASUS.

When writing with the stylus pen (in for example Xournal) the multitouch function is very annoying: When I place my writing hand on the display it produces random lines and figures.\nSo I would like to (temporary) deactivate (multi)touch completely, so that only the stylus pen is accepted for input.\nIs there any command that does this?\n\nA: You can achieve this by writing a small script to toggle \"device enabled\" property of the multi-touch input device. You can then bind this script to one of the keys for easy access or just execute it using any other method you prefer.\nFirst you need to get the device name using xinput utility. Open a Terminal and type xinput list.\n:~$ xinput list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                        id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                  id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Wacom ISDv4 E6 Pen stylus                   id=10    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Wacom ISDv4 E6 Finger touch                 id=11    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint                       id=14    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Wacom ISDv4 E6 Pen eraser                   id=16    [slave  pointer  (2)] \n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                  id=13    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                       id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard                 id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                                id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                   id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                                id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Integrated Camera                           id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard                id=12    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ ThinkPad Extra Buttons                      id=15    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nAs you can see in this case the name of multi touch device is Wacom ISDv4 E6 Finger touch and its id is 11. Yours may be different. You can use the id as well, but I prefer the name since adding/removing devices could cause the id of some of the devices to change. Here is an example script that could get you started. All this does is toggle between two commands -- one to enable the multitouch device and one to disable it.\n#!/bin/bash\n#!/bin/sh\n# This script can be used to toggle enable state of wacom multitouch screen for\n# Thinkpad Tablet Series. You may need to change the name of multitouch device \n# which can be found by running *xinput list* command\n\nTOGGLE=$HOME/.multitouch_toggle\n\nif [ ! -e $TOGGLE ]; then\n    touch $TOGGLE\n    xinput set-prop 'Wacom ISDv4 E6 Finger touch' 'Device Enabled' 0\nelse\n    rm $TOGGLE\n    xinput set-prop 'Wacom ISDv4 E6 Finger touch' 'Device Enabled' 1\nfi\n\nI hope this will help you get around the problem for now. If you need any help with customizing or running the script above feel free to ask.\n", "Q: Resume to login screen after suspend I have managed to change keyboard shortcuts to use the login screen instead of the lock screen, see this question.

This enables other ubuntu members of 'photography' group to add these files to their version of Shotwell.  \nI find modifying the Folder Properties/Permissions will NOT set the Group on 'Apply Permissions to Enclosed Files'  \n\nA: So, if I understand you correctly, you want files (pictures) that are put into a specific folder to automatically get assigned to a specific group (photography).  \nA possible solution is setting the \"setgid permission\" on the parent folder, where all images are stored. The setgid permission (see e.g. wikipedia) ensures that all files and folders that are created in a folder with the setgid bit set obtain the group of that folder (instead of the group set by the file creator).\nSince this does not effect files and folders that are already created inside this directory, first change their group recursively using  \nchgrp photography -R <your shotwell photo folder>\n\nNow set the setgid bit on that folder. To do so, run  \nchmod g+s <your shotwell photo folder>\n\nAfter both commands, your shotwell photo folder and all its contents belong to the group \"photography\", and the setgid is set:\nls -ld <your shotwell photo folder>\ndrwxrwsr-x 2 <your user> photography 4096 Aug 27 20:42 <your shotwell photo folder>\n\nNotice the s in drwxrwsr-x. That \"s\" indicates that the setgid bit is set.\nNow each time photos are copied into your shotwell folder, they are automatically assigned to group \"photography\".\nCaution:\nIf files and folders are moved into that directory (instead of copied). Their group is not changed. This is because of the tool itself. \"mv\" basically just renames the file, keeping its original ownerships and permissions, while \"cp\" creates a new file in the target directory.\n\nA: The setgid bit solution in ceage answer will work perfectly (+1) if you have only one group of people and everybody has the same permissions on the files but if you need more control with many groups, different permissions or even a per user rule, you can use acl. You can have a look at man setfacl.\nFor example in your case, you could define an acl for the photography group:\nsetfacl -Rm d:g:photography:rwX,g:photography:rwX /photo_dir\n\n    -R : recursive to all sub-folders and files\n    -m: modify using arguments in command line (can be used from config files)\n    d:g:photography:rwX: apply default (d:) permissions (rwX:) for photography group (g:group) on new files/directories\n    g:photography:rwX: same as above on existent files/directories (no d:)\n\nrwX: capital X defines x only for directories\n\nYou can check the permissions applied with getfacl /photo_dir\nIf you need a second group with read-only permissions for example, you define another acl and apply it the same way for the new group with rX instead of rwX. \nACLs can be defined for whole directories or individual files.\nThis will be permanent and you won't need to redefine permissions when you add delete or modify pictures. You define the ACLs once and \"forget\" about it.\nThe user and group seen with ls -l will no more be relevant/sufficient to control the file access (they are transformed in acl when you first run setfacl) and there will be a \"+\" at the end of the permission list like drwxrws---+ 6 root.....\n", "Q: Script to Mute an Application My goal is to be able to mute the Spotify application, not the entire system.

Now with that index number I would then need to  to run this command: pacmd set-sink-input-mute 0 1 to mute Spotify and pacmd set-sink-input-mute 0 0 to unmute Spotify. For those commands, the first number would need to be replaced with the index number found earlier, and the next number is the boolean to turn on or off the mute.

I managed to use the scripts provided here to fix my problem. Since I had to modify them a bit, here I join the improved version.\nThe reason the original scripts didn't work for me is because some applications can have several instances, i.e. several PID, but maybe only one of them is producing sound, and is thus actually connected to Pulseaudio. Since the script only used the first PID found, it would typically /not/ mute the desired application.\nSo here is a version where the argument is the application name as registered in PulseAudio. You can find this name by running the pacmd list-sink-inputs command and look for application.name field.\nAn alternative solution would be to mute/unmute all PIDs which have the same application name.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Adapter from glenn jackman on http://askubuntu.com/questions/180612/script-to-mute-an-application\n# to depend directly on the name of the PulseAudio client\n# rather than the application name (several instances of one application could\n# run while only one is connected to PulseAudio)\n\n# Possible further improvement: it could be useful to also mute all clients having\n# the specified name. Here, only the first one is muted.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmain() {\n    local action=mute\n    while getopts :hu option; do\n        case \"$option\" in\n            h) usage 0 ;;\n            u) action=unmute ;;\n            ?) usage 1 \"invalid option: -$OPTARG\" ;;\n        esac\n    done\n    shift $((OPTIND - 1))\n\n    if [[ \"$1\" ]]; then\n        $action \"$1\"\n    else\n        usage 1 \"specify the name of a PulseAudio client\"\n    fi\n}\n\nusage() {\n    [[ \"$2\" ]] && echo \"error: $2\"\n    echo \"usage: $0 [-h] [-u] appname\"\n    echo \"where: -u = ummute application (default action is to mute)\"\n    exit $1\n}\n\nmute()   { adjust_muteness \"$1\" 1; }\nunmute() { adjust_muteness \"$1\" 0; }\n\nadjust_muteness() {\n    local index=$(get_index \"$1\")\n    if [[ -z \"$index\" ]]; then\n        echo \"error: no PulseAudio sink named $1 was found\" >&2\n    else\n        [[ \"$index\" ]] && pacmd set-sink-input-mute \"$index\" $2 >/dev/null\n    fi\n}\n\nget_index() {\n#    local pid=$(pidof \"$1\")\n#    if [[ -z \"$pid\" ]]; then\n#        echo \"error: no running processes for: $1\" >&2\n#    else\n        pacmd list-sink-inputs |\n        awk -v name=$1 '\n            $1 == \"index:\" {idx = $2}\n            $1 == \"application.name\" && $3 == \"\\\"\" name \"\\\"\" {print idx; exit}\n        '\n#    fi\n}\n\nmain \"$@\"\n\n\nA: Even though the question is asking for a script, I wanted to leave this here.\nI have written a C application that does this on Ubuntu. Even better, it sits on the indicator tray (using libappindicator) and checks what Spotify is playing, on short intervals. If it is playing an ad (checks against a blacklist) it mutes the Spotify. If a new ad is being played, you simply click Mute on the indicator menu and it adds it to the blacklist. \nWhat it does, is looks for an X window, for which XFetchName returns Spotify - Linux Preview. Then it calls XGetWindowProperty to query the _NET_WM_ICON_NAME property of that window, which returns a string in the \"Spotify – <Artist> – <Song>\" format. When playing ads, it returns something like this:\n\"Spotify – Spotify – Premium Free Trial Cancel Any Time\"\n\nIt maintains a Ternary Search Tree of the list of ads, to efficiently check whether the current title is in the list.\nIt also uses the PulseAudio Asynchronous API to query the sink-inputs and set-mute:\npa_context_get_sink_input_info_list()\npa_context_set_sink_input_mute()\n\nSince it is just simple C code, it is light-weight. Check out the source code and Ubuntu .deb package at: indicator-muteads. It would probably beat a shell script by 2-3 orders of magnitude. \n\nA: First of all, the \"more correct\" way to find an application's PID like spotify, is to use:\npidof spotify\n\nI've built up a script that does the job, I don't know if it is the best way to do it, but it works perfectly:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Script to mute an application using PulseAudio, depending solely on\n# process name, constructed as answer on askubuntu.com: \n# http://askubuntu.com/questions/180612/script-to-mute-an-application\n\n#It works as: mute_application.sh vlc mute OR mute_application.sh vlc unmute\n\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n   echo \"Please provide me with an application name\"\n   exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ -z \"$2\" ]; then\n   echo \"Please provide me with an action mute/unmute after the application name\"\n   exit 1\nfi\n\nif !

Is installing LXDE in ubuntu is equivalent to installing a fresh copy of Lubuntu?\nMy computer is 2005 Made,Intel D 101 Processor with 512 MB RAM and 80 GB Hard disk. Dual Boot with XP.\nI feel a bit slow and have Ubuntu with LXDE desktop now.\n\nA: There are packages that provide the LXDE desktop environment for an Ubuntu system that is already installed without LXDE. Usually, the best one to install is lubuntu-desktop. This does give you the same software that you'd have if you installed Lubuntu from scratch. But it does not uninstall the other software present on your system, and it does not reset settings, or clear out users' home directories, or repartition, or any of the other things that might happen when actually installing Lubuntu (or Ubuntu or any other Ubuntu derivative).\n\nA: The short answer is no. Like Eliah Kagan mentioned, installing lubuntu-desktop on an ubuntu installation does not remove the other packages normally installed with ubuntu but not with lubuntu.\nSo while using a lighter window manager will help improve performance it will not be as fast as a clean lubuntu installation.\nIt's a question of deciding between speed and functionality.\nSee Lubuntu_vs_Ubuntu\nand Which *buntu to pick?\n", "Q: I have downloaded 12.04 but I cannot install it.

What I downloaded isn't an iso image, it was a zip folder, and when I unzipped it, I found many folders in there, but there wasn't any .iso image in it.

Check Your booting options.\nBut first of all when I trying to download Ubuntu 12.04 (Desktop or Server) from http://www.ubuntu.com/ it will download ISO file. Try this again, because Your Zip can be a WUBI for example, or other instalation option.\n\nA: As Mazeryt has explained ... \nExplaining a little further...\nOnce you have burnt the ISO to a CD. If you wish to install ubuntu within windows, insert your Ubuntu CD and you will see WUBI.exe on the CD to install. \nThere is lots on info on the net for you about WUBI\nAnother option if you dont have any CD's is to use USB creator\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nwhich you can then boot from\nHope this is of help\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 question I want to install Ubuntu.

I chose an Openbox DE at the time of login and the system took ages to load the DE. So I switched to CLI (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and rebooted my system (but I wanted to logout from the GUI and not restart the whole system). \nMy question is, can I issue some command at CLI to log me out from the GUI so that I can select different DE. (I don't want to restart my system every-time DE hangs.)\n\n$ DISPLAY=:0 gnome-session-quit --force\n\n** (gnome-session-quit:3144): WARNING **: Failed to call logout: The name org.gnome.SessionManager was not provided by any .service files\n\n\nA: To end all user processes and be sent back to the login screen, you can use:\nkill -9 -1\n\nDon't run it as root though, for reasons discussed here.\n\nA: As an alternative, you can terminate user sessions using the following, works well to log out users except for the root user- when doing maintenance for example. \nloginctl | egrep -v \"root|SESSION|listed\" | awk '{print $1}' | xargs loginctl terminate-session\n\n\nA: This can be done using the gnome-session-quit command. It needs the --force option to suppress the confirmation dialog that would appear without it.\nUnlike applications run from an X terminal emulator, ending a session from a TTY requires you to append the DISPLAY variable to indicate which X display is running the session. Hence:\nDISPLAY=:0 gnome-session-quit --force\n\nassuming that you are running GNOME on :0, which is the case in normal situations.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Ubuntu 12.04LTS running GNOME, the command \n\"DISPLAY=:0 gnome-session-quit --logout --no-prompt\" \n\nworks.  The \"--force\" argument doesn't exist in the current update level]\n\nA: Another way,\nsudo pkill -u NameOftheUser\n\nor\nsudo pkill x\n\nwhich kill all users.\n\nA: The real problem is that the DBUS session variables must be set and match the session you're trying to control.\nI've created this script that does set the DBUS session variables from the gnome-session environment in case you want to logout other users/sessions:\nHow to restart Gnome-Shell from command line?\nfunction logout() {\n    local USERNAME\n    export USERNAMES=( ) \n    while [ -n \"$1\" ]; do case \"$1\" in\n        -* ) break ;;\n        *) USERNAMES+=( \"$1\" ); shift ;;\n    esac; done\n\n    for USERNAME in \"${USERNAMES[@]}\"; do\n        local SESSION_PID=$(pgrep -fu \"$USERNAME\" gnome-session|head -1)\n        if [ -n \"$SESSION_PID\" ]; then\n            (\n                sudo -u \"$USERNAME\" cat \"/proc/$SESSION_PID/environ\" | xargs -0 -n 1 echo export\n                echo \"gnome-session-quit --logout $@\"\n            ) | sudo -u \"$USERNAME\" sh -;\n        fi\n    done\n}\n\n\nA: In modern systemd Linux distros, the answers are all a little too complicated.\nThe solution is one tool: loginctl.\nIn a good shell you even have autocompletion, so make use of Tab to see the options and parameters and it is quite intuitive.\nThe command to search for is kill-session.\nIf you tab, you'll notice each session has an ID, but in my case it also showed the username and TTY (that is the Ctrl+Alt+number you type) and the seat.\nHere is how it looks to me, e.g.:\n\n$ loginctl kill-session 10  \n10  -- 1000 rugk seat0 tty2\n\n\nYou can tab through the sessions to find the correct one.\nOtherwise, if that does not work you can find the session ID by running loginctl list-sessions or just loginctl. You get something like this:\n\n$ loginctl list-sessions                            \nSESSION  UID USER SEAT  TTY \n    10 1000 rugk seat0 tty2\n\n\nI guess it's quite obvious the first column contains the session ID you need to pass to loginctl kill-session.\nThis works very well if the GUI hangs and you need to force-kill it, which seems to be your use case.\nIf you want that to be explained in a more elaborate way here is how you can kill your own session if the GUI is not responding or you cannot use your keyboard.\n\nA: Please follow takkat's suggestion. The standard is Ctrl+Alt+Backspace.\nYou can also run:\n$ sudo service lightdm restart\n\n\nA: If you are in a xubuntu session or similar, must use xfce4-session-logout insted of gnome session commands, that's why you see warnings\n\nA: This is what works best for me (with xfce, lightdm and ssh):\n$ DISPLAY=:0.0 xfce4-session-logout --logout\n\nOr\n$ sudo service lightdm restart\n\n\nA: If you are using Openbox then you can use\nopenbox --exit which will exit the Openbox session and go back to the login manager, in my case LightDM.\n\nA: This command will log out whichout showing logout prompt and take you to the log in window\ngnome-session-quit --no-prompt\n\nTo power off you can use this command this will open a dialog box to conform power off\n\ngnome-session-quit --power-off\n\nYou can get rid of dialog box using --no-prompt\n\nA: You can use the command killall gnome-session to log out. This will work for all GNOME sessions and if I remember correctly all GNOME-related ones. It takes you right back to LightDM so you can select a new DE or a new user. :)\n", "Q: flash problem after installed nvidia a few days ago I install nvidia xserver because I have a monitor (DELE207WFP) with was saw with maximum resolution 1024x740, and I read that on xserver is possible to write own monitor configuration.

Printers & folders I don't seem to be able to share between my Ubuntu (fresh install) and any of my Windows machines. I tried using this guide: How to Share Folders in Ubuntu & Access them from Windows 7.  The problems is that I cannot see the Ubuntu machine in my network pane on the Windows machine.\nAny Ideas of what I should check?\nUltimately what I am looking to do is make mobile media server that I can put in the Van, attach a WiFi router, and stream to an iPad, tablet, laptop, etc.  Any advice on setting this up would be appreciated.\n\nA: Because they are different file systems (Ubuntu 12.04 defaults to ext4), you need to be careful about Unix writing to any Windows partition.\nAdditionally, Windows 7 doesn't share easily even with other Windows machines because 7 started using the homegroup instead of the typical windows network workgroup.  Per Microsoft, \"Computers must be running Windows 7 to be part of a homegroup. With Windows 7 Starter and Windows 7 Home Basic, you can join a homegroup, but you can't create one.\"\nIn the tutorial link that you provided, there was an option to specify the workgroup - but perhaps this only exists in Windows 7 Ultimate edition. In any case, I'm running Windows 7 and do not have that feature.\nUse Samba\nThe first solution that comes to mind is to install Samba. I'd recommend using the Ubuntu Software Center and searching for \"system-config-samba.\"  This search will yield the GUI option to configure your Samba server. For command-line, this step-by-step guide will help you install and configure Samba.\nYou mentioned hooking up your Ubuntu to a wireless router.  Make sure that you assign your machine a static IP address/lease using your router configuration utility.  Even if your router operates DHCP, you should be able to designate a fixed LAN address by either 1)MAC address or 2)computer name (depending upon your router type/model).\nOnce configured, Samba should pretty much be ideal for you.\nNetwork Attached Storage (NAS)\nMy network had an Xbox360 that I wanted to be able to browse and play content from.  I purchased a separate NAS (network attached storage). This provided the benefit of also being able to share media globally even with a dynamic IP from my ISP (the device updates a sort of proprietary DNS server with its current IP address). Then the NAS storage handles incoming requests from the WAN through UPnP configuration of my router.\nAll of my machines, including Ubuntu 12.04 can discover and use the NAS device.  Also tested and works on 14.04 lts.\nUpgrade your Router\nWhile the OPs original question was about Ubuntu configuration, I thought I would add this section for thoroughness.  Now many brands of routers have built-in file sharing and printer sharing abilities.  One example of an entry-level model lets you attach either an external drive OR a printer via USB is the Netgear N300 Router.  But for more advanced customization, be on the lookout for models proven compatible with Open Source firmware initiatives and Linux derivatives.  By way of firmware upgrade, users can install a\n\nembedded operating system....OpenWrt can be run on CPE routers, residential gateways, smartphones (e.g. Neo FreeRunner), pocket computers (e.g. Ben NanoNote), and laptops (e.g. One Laptop per Child (OLPC)). Also, it is possible to run OpenWrt on ordinary computers (e.g. x86 architecture). Many patches from the OpenWrt source base have been included upstream in the Linux kernel mainline. -excerpt from the OpenWrt wiki page\n\nOpenWrt is just one example.  Some software packages even allow SAMBA to be run from the device itself!  Other features may include Dynamic DNS services to DLNA media streaming. \n", "Q: How do I give back to the Ubuntu community? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I contribute to Ubuntu? \n\nI made a switch to Ubuntu about 3 years ago and I'm more than happy with it.

Is there any antivirus or any sort of scanner available for Linux so that one can insure the security of system and is it so that Ubuntu is hack-proof? \nIf not than what are the basic steps which a new Ubuntu user keep in mind for security concern.\n\nA: Setup a Virtual Machine using Virtualbox or VMWare and install Backtrack. Once Backtrack is setup and installed, configure Nessus. Once Nessus is installed access it via a browser and scan the Ubuntu system. Nessus will provide a report on any security vulnerabilities it finds. Keep in mind it won't find everything.

(So the password is still valid.) \nHow can I gain access again via the normal login procedure (welcome screen)?\nUpdate:\nWhen I tried to log on with my new password, it again was denied. When I deliberately tried to log on with a faulty password, an error message came back, saying: \nAccess denied - wrong password. \n\nI suppose, the first time the password was not rejected, but the procedure was aborted for some reason.\n\nSome additional info after trying to find a solution: I am conviced it is a Compiz-issue. Why?\nbefore this happened, all sessions came to a grinding halt, regardless of being logged on in a 2D or 3d environment.

Only after that, the above mentioned troubles appeared.\nIn the meantime I have  happened to find a thread with reference 17381, describing exactly what I have experienced.\nFor now, I will try to cure this situation (later this week) and revert with the results, hopefully to close this post.\nIn the meantime I cordially thank you all, even if you didn't kill the problem; you gave me the inspiration to look further and find a possible cure. \nUpdate2:\nAfter 15 hrs of trial-and-error I callled it quits (When I decided to tackle this problem, I've given myself 12 hrs, to avoid massive loss of time.)

I want to install ubuntu but I want to have both operating systems: Ubuntu and windows xp. What can I do?\n\nA: Many if not most people choose to do just that, installing Linux (Ubuntu) for daily usage and keeping their default Windows install for certain programs not supported on Linux (such as Netflix, iTunes, several games, etc.).\nTo install Ubuntu alongside Windows on a separate (aka a separate segment of your hard drive from your default C: drive), burn or purchase an Ubuntu live CD, pop it in your DVD drive and reboot. You can create one by downloading the proper .iso (64 or 32-bit) from Ubuntu's website and burning it onto a completely new, blank DVD.\nOnce you boot with the DVD in the tray, you should be prompted to install Ubuntu. Follow the directions and make sure you select the option to install alongside Windows, not to replace/remove Windows. If all goes well, after you install Ubuntu you'll be prompted with a screen after boot to select Windows XP or Ubuntu to load.\nThere's another, much easier option to simulate an Ubuntu dual-boot, however. Download the Windows installer for Ubuntu off of Ubuntu's website and run it. You'll create a virtual hard drive within your Windows partition and be able to run Ubuntu almost like you would a dual-boot. However, this will cost a slight performance decrease and you won't be able to hibernate (which is notable for laptops). It is easier to install and easier to remove, though, as you can uninstall it just like a program in Windows.\n\nA: Have you ever used ubuntu before?  If not, I highly recommend installing wubi here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-ubuntu-with-windows\nThis installs ubuntu within windows and allows you to pick windows or ubuntu on boot up.\nIt's not a traditional install but it is much easier.  \nNow if you are really hard set on installing it to it's own partition, I would recommend using the steps provided in this video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LokDqte3sA4\nHonestly the traditional install is not too difficult but if you're not comfortable with messing with partitions than I wouldn't recommend it just yet.\n\nA: You can definitely have them both.\nIn the installation of Ubuntu you will be asked if you'd like to install Ubuntu alongside with Windows or if you'd like to totally replace windows. Just pick the alongside option and you're good. :) \n", "Q: I need help on starting up 12.04 on my computer I have just downloaded 12.04 Windows installer.

It is the highest level portal to install, remove and troubleshoot software/hardware conflicts. It offers the most specific, nuanced installations relative to your PC manufacturer, resident OS, etc. The other gentleman dosen't like Wubi, however it offers some ease of installation. The alternative seems to be a lot of exhausting,complex coding entries. They likely offer better stability when done (correctly) for dual boot OS's on a single disk drive. \nBe that as it may,there are a lot of incredibly helpful people in the Linux community.\nIf you have Firefox, install the add on ubuntusers. The site is from Germany,and very useful links are mirrored in the states if you do not know German. Skip the forums (IMHO).Go to the \"official\" sites. Post the blurb about the kernel there. I daresay you will find your solution in short order.It may seem daunting, however the properly executed commands are like a magic key that opens the dungeon door. Even is your system is old, the terminal will rip thru your problem , effecting solutions that are amazing. (Much safer, faster and better than the overrated synapse.\nLast, there are nuggets of info. on these sites, e.g., IF ONLY I realized 2 months ago what I learned today-- namely that in Kubuntu (the flavor I've settled on ) the Os gets sensitized to multiple pc's inj the same household who share common DNS DHCP adresses on the same router. It can get to where your pc will refuse to \"talk\" with another in the same household, fearing some cyberinvasion. Imagine-- built in attitudes for the OS. Some of it is maddening. The BEST workarounds are the \"backports\" \"restricted \" packages, and \"ppa\" portals for software. Though not oficially in the \"Cannon\" the best and most effective solutions lie there. Solutions involving routers, passwords, security, firewalls, etc -- PROCEED SLOWLY. They can sensitize all those demons that make Linus so blazingly fast. Nothing worse than a pack of angry demons. A lot of water must be applied to cool their jets.\nJohn \n", "Q: How can I tell Ubuntu fix my RAM disk as non-pageable? I'd like to make sure that the memory allocated for a RAM disk never gets paged to a HDD. How can it be done in Ubuntu?\n\nA: There are two types of filesystem commonly used for RAM-disks in Linux, ramfs and tmpfs.\ntmpfs is the more modern on the two, and will put unneeded files in swap. As far as I am aware, there is no option to disable this.\nramfs is older and more primitive, and cannot use swap. Be warned, however, that unlike tmpfs a ramfs filesystem will continue to grow until you are out of RAM, at which point your system will hard-freeze. Therefore, if you use ramfs, you must be vigilant of its size at all times.\n", "Q: WMP600N keeps disconnecting I recently upgraded my aging 802.11b wireless card to a WMP600N.

Just trying to ping my router results in a Destination Host Unreachable message.\nThe syslog shows no indication that there has been any problem. The only way to address this is to reconnect to the wireless network using the network dropdown beside the clock.

Your best bet is to try a newer in-kernel driver.\nTo build and install the driver:\nWe will download a recent compat-wireless-pc driver package, install build dependencies, select the RT2x00 module rt2x00, build and install it.\nType/paste the following, line-by-line, in a terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-`uname -r`\nwget -O- http://linuxwireless.org/download/compat-wireless-2.6/compat-wireless-2012-07-03-pc.tar.bz2 | tar -xj\ncd compat-wireless-2012-07-03-pc\n./scripts/driver-select rt2x00\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nYou should then reboot, and then see if the wireless works any better.\n\nA: There are several reasons for that, possible causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*your disk have hardware failure, like I/O errors...\n\n*You have multiple firewalls enabled, and it is better to have only one, maybe \"gufw\" is the best... and it needs to deny all with rules to allow out udp 53 and allow out tcp 25,53,80,110,143,993,5060\n\n*Your OS is not with all modules inserted, type: lsmod > list1.txt\nThen create an USB installer with the \"startup disk creator\" using the ISO of your installation CD (a pen of 2 GB is enough) then boot from that USB PEN and choose \"try Ubuntu\" and type there: lsmod > list2.txt and copy this file to the same location the one above and open  both in text editor and see if there is missing modules in list1.txt...\nTo install missing modules use first modinfo \"name of the module\" after the description see if it needs dependencies and install those first if not, just copy the full path of the ko file and type sudo insmod \"paste path/file.ko\" after all modules inserted no need for reboot things should start working fine...\n", "Q: clicking on link opens blank firefox window i'm using firefox 14. \nWhen i click a link outside the browser it opens a new firefox window showing google.com(My home page). \nI have tried setting into \n\nxdg-settings set default-web-browser firefox.desktop\n\nbut that does not seems working.\nPlease suggest anything possible for this problem\nThanks.\n\nA: I am having the same issue.

Now, sources I found say that to activate it you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install laptop-mode-tools.\n\n*Append LAPTOP_MODE_ENABLED=true (if it doesn't exist; otherwise make sure that it's set to true) inside /etc/default/acpi-support.\n\n\nHowever, even after doing this, laptop mode is not running (I have it set up in /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf to be always on):\n~$ cat /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode \n0\n\nDoes anyone know how can I enable laptop-mode?\nIt is mentioned here that the Ubuntu package is \"crippled\".

I was able to extend my battery life from 2 hours to 3 and a half.\n\nA: The steps listed in the question are correct, the only thing remaining is to reboot your machine (possibly a couple of times). After that laptop mode will be enabled:\n~$ cat /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode \n2\n\nOnce laptop-mode is working, you can follow these steps to configure laptop-mode...\nEdit /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf and change\nENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ON_AC=0\n\nto\nENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ON_AC=1\n\nAlso check for the battery mode on battery state and turn it on if it is off by changing the value to 1\ne.g.:   ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ON_BATTERY = 1\nYou can set many other option in this config file (the file has many self-explanatory comments). You should try setting them to your liking.\nWhen you're done, restart laptop-mode with:\nsudo /etc/init.d/laptop-mode restart\n\nP.S. If laptop-mode is still not on after rebooting the machine, you can try playing with this command as well to manually enable it:\nCheck that it's active on AC with for example:\n$ sudo laptop_mode start\n\nwhich should output:\nLaptop mode \nenabled, \nactive [unchanged]\n\nHope this helps..\n\nA: In Lubuntu Menu choose Preferences -> Default applications for LXSession -> Settings -> Laptop mode -> yes\n", "Q: How can I delete my older versions of Ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there a way to remove/hide old kernel versions? \n\nI'm running from a low disk space two Ubuntu versions.

I want to delete this old version so that I can free up disk space, as only 1 GB is left now.\n\nA: The bootloader shows \"Older Versions of Ubuntu\" this means older Kernel version actually, you can use programs like  Ubuntu Tweak  that let you run a janitor thruought your system and delete innecesary files such as older kernel versions\nYou can also use Synaptic Package Manager to do that, here  Nixie Pixel  explains it all in a cool little video :)\n\nA: You can delete the older Ubuntu version using Gparted to delete the partition where it's installed and later expanding the partition you want to occupy this empty space. Don't forget to save the files you have inside this partition (the one with old Ubuntu version).\nTo install Gparted type the following command on the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nYou can also install it via the Ubuntu Software Center\nAfter modifying the partitions type the following command on the terminal to update the O.S. selection menu list:\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Java doesn't work I was writing a program on my laptop to run on my server in Java.

The Intel DZ68DB motherboard with an Intel I7 2600 CPU.\n\nA: Virtualbox supports running a 64-bit guest VM on a 32-bit physical host, but there are some requirements and other caveats:\nFrom the manual:\nVirtualBox supports 64-bit guest operating systems, even on 32-bit host operating systems, provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need a 64-bit processor with hardware virtualization support (see the section called “Hardware vs. software virtualization”).\n\n*You must enable hardware virtualization for the particular VM for which you want 64-bit support; software virtualization is not supported for 64-bit VMs.\n\n*If you want to use 64-bit guest support on a 32-bit host operating system, you must also select a 64-bit operating system for the particular VM. Since supporting 64 bits on 32-bit hosts incurs additional overhead, VirtualBox only enables this support upon explicit request.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Warning:\n  \n*On any host, you should enable the I/O APIC for virtual machines that you intend to use in 64-bit mode. This is especially true for 64-bit Windows VMs. See the section called “\"Advanced\" tab”. In addition, for 64-bit Windows guests, you should make sure that the VM uses the Intel networking device, since there is no 64-bit driver support for the AMD PCNet card; see the section called “Virtual networking hardware”.\n\n", "Q: GTK Recent Chooser Menu callback not working I am currently very puzzled why something so simple fails so hard:\nThis is the source code for a very very simple recent chooser menu, but it fails. \nMy output is this:\nDisplay name: recentchoosermenu.c\nFile URI: file:///home/wolf/Downloads/recentchoosermenu.c\nLast application: gedit\nDisplay name: recentchoosermenu.c\n...\n\nfor every entry, it's always the first file. \nI really have no idea why. \nThanks for any help,\nWolf\nEDIT: Well this is embarassing, forgot to append the link: https://gist.github.com/3483363\nSorry.\n\nA: Well, it seems that it's a bug in the global menu somewhere.

If your universe repository is also based at Canonical (e.g. not a local mirror), see below on how to install traceroute withouth apt.\nIf this command outputs anything, then Telia is most likely the cause of your problems.\nIf this command does NOT output anything, it is still possible, that you are affected, because of asynchronous routing.\nThis problem is not within Canonicals reach, so they cannot really do something about it (besides building global redundancy), but it should be temporary.\n(This answer is only valid close to the time of writing!

Just for an anology, if you had a script or alternate setup to resume a download whenever you connect to internet, and it starts working when you connect to this wifi and you have not yet accepted the agreement, the tool will dutifully dump the same page and declare that the file has been downloaded, potentially overwriting any previous part of the original file.\n\n\nIf you are connected to internet, It should be perfectly safe to delete the entire folder /var/lib/apt/lists and do a update.

When I attempt to boot, I get the error, \"Invalid EFI File Path.\"  I tried to change the boot parameters for the entry in GRUB from /dev/sdc1 to /dev/sda* (the asterisk representing 1-3) to see if that's the issue since there's actually no Windows install except for on /dev/sda, but that didn't exactly work.\nHere is the paste from Boot Repair: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1169189/\nI understand that repairing the Windows Boot loader would disallow me from booting in to Ubuntu, but I need to get in to Windows to do some things, so is that worth a shot?\n\nA: I think your problem is this:\nmenuentry \"Windows bootmgfw.efi.bkp, generated by Boot-Repair\" {\nsearch --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root 0648-FFF7\nchainloader (${root})/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi.bkp\n}\n\nmenuentry \"Windows memtest.efi, generated by Boot-Repair\" {\nsearch --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root 0648-FFF7\nchainloader (${root})/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/memtest.efi\n}\n\nmenuentry \"Boot bootx64.efi.bkp, generated by Boot-Repair\" {\nsearch --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root 0648-FFF7\nchainloader (${root})/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi.bkp\n}\n\nNote in particular the filenames on the chainloader lines -- bootmgfw.efi.bkp and bootx64.efi.bkp are not valid EFI boot loader files, and they don't seem to exist on your disk. The files bootmgfw.efi and bootx64.efi, however, do exist and are valid EFI boot loader filenames. (I can't guarantee the files you've got are valid, of course, but the filenames are.) I recommend you change these filenames in the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file and then type sudo update-grub to pass those changes on to the GRUB configuration file. You could also manually check the contents of /dev/sda1 to be sure that those files exist with the proper filenames; there's a possibility that something has improperly renamed the files and then updated your GRUB configuration to match that. I have no idea how GRUB would respond to such abuse.\n\nA: First try to update the grub with this command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nMaybe that fixes the grub. If not try to fix the windows MBR (Master Boot Record) with a windows Media. This action will corrupt your grub, but no need to worry. You can fix the grub any-time with just a live media of Ubuntu\n\nA: You should use your own Windows 7 installation media to install the Windows boot loader, then use \"EasyBCD\" to create a boot entry for Ubuntu on windows boot loader.\n", "Q: How to change GUI on DVD? I downloaded Edubuntu 12.04 LTS DVD and when I boot from it, all I get is a white screen, after selecting to install or run from DVD.  I'm almost sure it is a graphic card problem since I'm using NVDIA GeForce 6100 nForce 405/PCI/SSE2. I tried to update but it'll take too long and I don't have the time.  \nMy PC is AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4200+ × 2 with 8Gb Ram and Edubuntu 11.10 OS.\n\nA: Have you tried booting the install DVD on a different computer in order to verify that it is an issue with the GPU/Driver as opposed to an issue with the install medium?\nIf the problem is indeed a lack of out-of-the-box support for your graphics card, you may need to perform a installation in text-only mode. As far as I know, there is no \"Alternate Installation\" (i.e. text-only) .iso image of Edubuntu available to download, so if you have your heart set on upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04, I think your options are: 1) Start the update before you go to bed/work/wherever, so the time will not be an issue, or  2) perform a text-only installation of the standard Ubuntu desktop using the Alternate Install .iso here, then activate whatever drivers with which you are currently having success on 11.10, and proceed to essentially convert your new Ubuntu installation to Edubuntu with the very simple instructions here. The latter option would obviously take longer and be more of a hassle, though there are certainly positive things to be said about fresh installations as opposed to upgraded installations in most cases.\n", "Q: How to make shortcuts to executables I'm a little bit noob. I can run a program in terminal with;\n$sudo /opt/eclipse/eclipse\n\nbut I don't know how to create a shortcut that starts it with root privileges (They are installed in /opt so it needs root)\n\nA: Usually the easiest way is just making a shell script.  What ever command you use to launch eclipse use the same.\nYou probably want to use \"gksudo\" and then your command which looks like\ngksudo /opt/eclipse/eclipse\nThen put that in a regular file with a .sh extension.  Right click the file and add execution permissions.  You can also use chmod +x filename.sh\nHere is a good tutorial to get you the basics of bash scripts.  Its really easy and powerful.\nhttp://linuxconfig.org/Bash_scripting_Tutorial\nI haven't tried launching eclipse from the command line, but I believe it is built with java.  If that is the case you might also need to specify java -jar in there some where, but I'm not sure.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: ALL of the default programs which come preinstalled with Ubuntu or which can be installed from repositories are \"installed as root\" in system directories, yet you do not need to superuser privileges to run them.\nYou're confusing the permissions necessary to read/execute a program with permissions necessary to override or delete the file. The program file may be owned by root, but if your user has execute privileges, you'll be able to run the program. The running process will have User ID of your user, so it won't be able to modify files owned by root.\nThis is an important security measure and running with super-user privileges should be reserved only for a small set of trusted applications which actually require this (i.e. the ones which make change to system configuration (Software Center and Update Manager) or directly access hardware devices (gparted).\nEclipse does not require root privileges regardless of whether it is installed in /opt or in your home directory (which I personally prefer). What's probably happening is that you started it as root the first time so the directory in your home folder which stores Eclipse configuration (home/(yourusername)/.eclipse) is owned by root. You need to change the directory's owner to give Eclipse to write there when started as non-privileged user:\nchown -R yourusername:yourusername ~/.eclipse\n\n", "Q: Run python script IN TERMINAL after Lubuntu login? I've spent the night trying to figure out how to run a python script in a terminal at startup.\nAdding it to init.d will run the script, but I don't see a terminal window or any other indication the script is running other than the audio output the python script produces. I would like to be able to see and interact with this script in a terminal just as if I'd ran it from a terminal.\nMy next successful step was to make a .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart. My Exec is\nExec=lxterminal -e \"python ~/scripts/myscript.py\"\n\nWhen I log in, I see a terminal window flash for just a brief moment - but then disappear. No sound is produced from the python script so I assume it quit running. How do I start a terminal window at system startup and run a Python script in it?\n\nA: It seems your script is running, but you want the term to stay open.  If that's the goal:  \nExec=lxterminal -e \"python ~/scripts/myscript.py && /bin/bash\"  \n\nShould keep the term open for you...\n\nA: I also had experienced some problems with lxterminal as for calling it with the -e argument from inside a .desktop file.\nThe solution for me was the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make an executable file, named launch_myscript.sh with the content: lxterminal -e python ~/scripts/myscript.py.\n\n*Point to this file at your Exec field of the .desktop file that you have placed\nTips: You can try to directly place in your Exec field lxterminal -e python /home/username/scripts/myscript.py.

In this time, I've tried my best to follow directions and not screw everything up but I have. I'm new to Linux. I tried to install Firestorm and this is what happened:\nparent@ubuntu:~$ sudo '/home/parent/Downloads/Phoenix_Firestorm-Release_i686_4.2.1.29803/install.sh' \n[sudo] password for parent: \nEnter the desired installation directory [/opt/firestorm-install]: /home/parent/downloads\n - Installing to /home/parent/downloads\n/home/parent/Downloads/Phoenix_Firestorm-Release_i686_4.2.1.29803/install.sh: line 80: /home/parent/downloads/etc/refresh_desktop_app_entry.sh: Permission denied\nparent@ubuntu:~$ sudo opt/firestorm-install\nsudo: opt/firestorm-install: command not found\nparent@ubuntu:~$  ./etc/refresh_desktop_app_entry.sh\nbash: ./etc/refresh_desktop_app_entry.sh: No such file or directory\nparent@ubuntu:~$ sudo '/home/parent/Downloads/Phoenix_Firestorm-Release_i686_4.2.1.29803/install.sh' \nEnter the desired installation directory [/opt/firestorm-install]: /home/parent\n - Backing up previous installation to /home/parent.backup-2012-08-27\n - Installing to /home/parent\ncp: cannot stat `/home/parent/Downloads/Phoenix_Firestorm-Release_i686_4.2.1.29803/*': No such file or directory\nFailed\nparent@ubuntu:~$\n\nNow whenever I go into my files it says it can't find anything. Like Cannot find home/parent/Downloads. Now, I KNOW there are downloads. I don't know why it's doing this all of a sudden. I'm so frustrated that I'm ready to just go back to Windows. I've already had to uninstall/reinstall Ubuntu once today. It's looking like I\"m going to have to do it again. How can I fix my file problem that I'm now having and can someone please, please tell me how to install Firestorm? I mean they don't even have their repository listed. It's ridiculous to have to go through this over a program. Spotify wasn't hard at all to install so why is this? Someone please help, and I'm sorry if I sound like a total idiot. I'm pretty tech savvy but I'm honestly pretty upset after struggling with this for hours.\nEdit Okay, I see the problem with the directory files (showing the error I mentioned above when I try to click on them). I can only access my downloads, desktop, ect, through the backup that was created when I tried to install Firestorm. It's like that's the real home now. How can I get it back to the way it was?\nEdit Ubuntu has stopped working for me on reboot now. It doesn't go past the login screen. This is exactly what happened when I had to uninstall it before after trying to install Firestorm. Maybe I'm giving up too easily but I think I'm just going to go back to Windows. If this is what's going to happen every time I innocently try to install a program then it's just not worth it. I installed it specifically to run Firestorm because Windows sucks up a lot of CPU and causes lag. I still appreciate any input but this is just too much hassle for something that shouldn't be hard.\n\nA: \nI had a go running the same program. It worked fine for me. \n\nAccording to the 'README-linux.txt' file:\n\nThe Firestorm Linux client can entirely run from the directory you have\n  unpacked it into - no installation step is required Run ./firestorm from the >installation >directory to start Firestorm.\n\nSo in my case, running the program was relatively simple:\nGo to the Downloads folder, extract the archive, and then go into the extracted Phoenix folder:\ncd ~/Downloads/\ntar -xvf Phoenix_Firestorm-Release*.tar.bz2\ncd ./Phoenix_Firestorm-Release*\n\nProvide a script with permission to execute. Executing the script then adds Firestorm to the menu.\nchmod u+x ./etc/refresh_desktop_app_entry.sh\n./etc/refresh_desktop_app_entry.sh\n\nAfter that Firestorm should appear in your menu. It can then be run directly from the extracted archive.\nI think your problem with logging in may related to this output:\n\nparent@ubuntu:~$ sudo '/home/parent/Downloads/Phoenix_Firestorm-Release_i686_4.2.1.29803/install.sh'\n  Enter the desired installation directory [/opt/firestorm-install]: /home/parent\n  - Backing up previous installation to /home/parent.backup-2012-08-27\n  - Installing to /home/parent\n  cp: cannot stat `/home/parent/Downloads/Phoenix_Firestorm-Release_i686_4.2.1.29803/*': No such file or directory\n  Failed\n\nIn particular, it seems as if you choose to install the program in the same location as your home directory (due to typing '/home/parent' at the command prompt). Therefore, the installer moved the contents of the home directory to \"/home/parent.backup-2012-08-27\", which would have lead to some important files being moved.\n\nA: You need to be careful with what you type into the command line. I can see quite a few typos in your paths.\n\n\n*\n\n*You sometimes type Downloads and sometimes type downloads.\n\n*opt/firestorm-install should be /opt/firestorm-install, which is why you get the error sudo: opt/firestorm-install: command not found\n\n*Finally, ./etc/refresh_desktop_app_entry.sh looks strange. Should it be /etc/refresh_desktop_app_entry.sh?\n\n\nA: is you problem solved ?\nthis is how i found firestorm running on ubuntu 12.04\neven if you are running in 64 bit, you need to install 32 bit library \nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nhope that works.\n", "Q: Regarding \"Host key verification Failed\" I use Ubuntu 10.04 in 2 virtual machines.

Please provide me a solution for this issue. Thanks.\n\nA: You can skip strict host key verification check using following command.\nsshpass -p '<your_password>' ssh <your_server_ip> -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no\n\nNote that above command will solve your problem when key is not present in /root/.ssh/known_host file, but if older key will be present than you have to remove that first by following command\nssh-keygen -R hostname\n\n\nA: The first time you connect to another system you will be shown a fingerprint of the remote system's encryption key (which, if you're feeling paranoid, you can check offline).\nOn the remote system, the command ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key will show the fingerprint that should be shown the first time you connect to it.\nWhen you confirm that this is the expected fingerprint, it is stored in the file $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts along with the name of the remote system, so that if you try and connect again and find the key has changed you are warned that the remote system has been changed, or your communications are being intercepted (unlikely, but still...).\nIn this case, you have maybe re-installed the remote system (so it has a new SSH key but the same name), and hence you are being warned that it has changed.\nTo correct this, you need to remove the existing entry from the known_hosts file. If you don't mind being asked again to confirm the identity of other machines you connect to, you can just delete known_hosts and it will be recreated the next time you use SSH. Alternatively, you can use the ssh-keygen command to delete the offending key, by doing ssh-keygen -R HOSTNAME (where HOSTNAME is the name of the remote machine).\n", "Q: 'Input not supported' error and no Grub after upgrading from 10.10 to 11.04 Running Windows Vista and Ubuntu 11.04 on an Acer tower.

Or make a new partition on the empty space for Ubuntu to access?\n\nA: I am not sure if you installed the grub to the mbr or the root of the Linux partition. If you did install it to the mbr, you can move the Linux partition and merge it with the new space. If the grub is on the Linux root partition use my second suggestion to avoid the headaches of adding a partition back to grub once the move is finished.\nA second suggestion would be to use the new empty partition for Ubuntu as that would answer your first problem of not enough space, and you could make it accessible from windows as a file or document partition.\nI hope this helps\n\nInstalling Ubuntu reference\nHow do I install Ubuntu?\nIllustrative guide of Dual Booting\n", "Q: 12.04 can't detect my D-Link Airtel Net Setter I had purchased a D-Link Net Setter and insert a Airtel Prepaid Sim in it.

This is a good practice if portability is a concern, but many people do so because they're copying something they've seen without understanding it.\nUnless your script needs to run on a non-desktop Linux system (e.g., running shell scripts on Android devices is quite different), I recommend using the Bash shebang line at the beginning:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nThis line, when it's the first line in the script, determines which interpreter (shell such as bash or sh, Python, etc.) is called to execute it. If you use the above line, you'll get the same behavior (almost) as you do from the command line, assuming you use the default shell. If for reasons of portability or preference you use a different shebang line, be aware that you'll have to consult the documentation for the shell you've referenced, even if the shell you reference is a symlink to Bash.\n\nA: You need to exit zsh and activate bash as shown:\nexec bash\n\nThe run the command\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nAfter which you can reactive zsh:\nexec zsh\n\nHope that helps\n", "Q: How can I create a movie from an .hdr file?

Numerous fine-control settings and features like layers, paths, masks, and scripting give you total control over your images.\nMany image file formats are supported, including JPEG, PhotoShop (.psd), and Paint Shop Pro (.psp) files. It can also be used to scan and print photos.\n\nBut this is mainly for editing images (as is PhotoShop) and putting them after one another (but that is not a movie but a slideshow).\nIf you are talking about movies then Blender might be what you are looking for.\n\nBlender.\n\n\n\nBlender is an integrated 3d suite for modelling, animation, rendering, post-production, interactive creation and playback (games). Blender has its own particular user interface, which is implemented entirely in OpenGL and designed with speed in mind. Python bindings are available for scripting; import/export features for popular file formats like 3D Studio and Wavefront Obj are implemented as scripts by the community. Stills, animations, models for games or other third party engines and interactive content in the form of a standalone binary are common products of Blender use.\n\nSome external links to video's where someone used HDR images to create movies and/or recorded a movie with HDR:\n\n*\n\n*HDR Lighting Tutorial\n\n*Setting Up HDR for Image Based Lighting\n\n*HDR video Blender nodes tutorial\n\n*Simple HDR video using Blender's VSE\n", "Q: os-prober doesn't find Arch Linux until I manually mount Arch Linux partition Title says everything.

Once there was a Gnome-applet in Ubuntu (Seahorse?) which helped me with encryption/decryption of PGP text messages. It was able to encrypt or decrypt the clipboard.\nSince Unity I have no idea, how to integrate this applet into my desktop. What is the recommended way to encrypt/decrypt text messages like emails or just some text from the web?\n\nA: For email, there is a thunderbird addon called Enigmail which performs email encryption or signing, and is quite nicely integrated. Install it from the Software Center or with sudo apt-get install enigmail.\nSeahorse still exists (it is called \"Passwords and Keys\" if you search in the dash), but does appear to have lost built-in support for text encryption/signing (I think - I don't have a GPG key on this system to test with).\nThis thread gives the syntax for signing, encrypting, verifying and decrypting text in the console with the gpg command.\nThis answer explains how to add gpg integration to gedit, although I must admit I was expecting to find better plugin support for encrypt/sign in both gedit and tomboy notes without obvious success.\n\nA: Pyrite was written just for this purpose. It's not packaged yet -- so not in the repos; you'll have to follow a few instructions to download and extract it to a location of your choice manually, but it works wonderfully IMHO. (I would say that though.. since I'm the developer.)\nAs bessman mentioned, seahorse-nautilus is the way to go if you want to asymmetrically-encrypt files in the file browser. (In addition to text, pyrite can do symmetric & asymmetric encryption of files, but it's not integrated with Nautilus.)\nFinally, check out the answer on this older question for more details on setting up gedit with gpg.\n\nA: You can integrate Seahorse with Nautilus by installing seahorse-nautilus.

I do not want a browser plugin, but rather an OS wide block.\n\nA: You can set up a transparent proxy. As Wikipedia says,\n\nAlso known as an intercepting proxy or forced proxy, a transparent\n  proxy intercepts normal communication at the network layer without\n  requiring any special client configuration. Clients need not be aware\n  of the existence of the proxy. A transparent proxy is normally located\n  between the client and the Internet, with the proxy performing some of\n  the functions of a gateway or router\n\nDoing it with /etc/hosts is fine, as long as the user doesn't know about the file or doesn't have the permissions to edit the file. But I guess what you want to achieve would be easier if you use proxy, although it will take some time to set it up.\nTo set up the transparent proxy, you can use squid.

It can sometimes make it easier with finnicky GRUB configurations if /boot is primary and the partition table isn't changed anywhere before it.\n\n*You shouldn't share /root and /etc as if you will be experimenting with Arch, you may be messing up configuration.

How do I gain root privileges in Ubuntu Desktop 12.04? I installed to a USB stick to try it out. Now when I installed it on a VM, I don't have the same options as I did on the USB stick, such as opening remote desktop, installing drivers, and some of the video capabilities.\n\nA: There are 2 ways to do things with elevated permissions.\nsudo lets you run commands in your own user account with root privileges. \nsu lets you switch user so that you're actually logged in as root.\nBut this options is by default disabled on Ubuntu. Instead you can simply start a root shell with sudo -i.\nRead What are the differences between \"su\", \"sudo -s\", \"sudo -i\", \"sudo su\"? for more information.\nUse either method only as and when needed, they can cause your system damage if used without caution.\n\nA: This should make you root after you enter your user's password, assuming you were the first account to be created.  Be careful when you're root.  Only login as root when you really need to, and logout as soon as you're done.  \nsudo su -\n\nAlternatively you can run specific commands with root privileges by prepending them with sudo.  For example:\nsudo cp -p foo bar/\n\n\nA: You cant gain something you already have. If you can use sudo, than you dont need to gain it.\nUa, excuse me... But sudo is not how you \"gain\" root privileges. sudo is used when you \nalready have root level access from the admin group and want to use it.\nThe question implies \"gain\" as something that you do not have. Probably not written\ncorrectly.\nCommon Example:\nSo you need sudo, or root on your computer but you can't use sudo BECAUSE you need\nto \"gain\" the privilege because you accidentally locked your self out etc. by editing sudoers and removing yourself because you thought you could login as root on Ubuntu. \nsudo doesn't solve everything. And you can't gain something you already have. \n", "Q: External display is not working under Ubuntu with a Thinkpad W530 I have a new Thinkpad W530. It has a K2000M graphics card (with Optimus) and a Intel Chipset graphic. I can't connect an external display.\nHere is what I tried with more or less success.\n1) Installed bumblebee: It allows me to run CUDA codes but no external display. Moreover, my graphic card is not detected as the correct one (Q2100 instead of K2000M).\n2) Installed hybrid-screenclone and follow this http://sagark.org/optimal-ubuntu-graphics-setup-for-thinkpads/ : It allows to have an external displays but it is very slow and not automatic (no screen detection and no resolution auto-detection).\n3) Installed thinkdisp : It is supposed to simplify the previous point but it doesn't work on my computer.\n4) Installed new driver 304.37: It is supposed to support my K2000M but it doesn't work. My graphic card is not detected and external display are still not working.\nHere is where I am. \nNB: the rest (keyboard,wifi) is working perfectly.\nI think a lot of people are facing the same problem but there is a lack of unified documentation.\n\nA: I gave up on trying to use Optimus on my Thinkpad W530.

The new PCManFM 1.0 version is not yet in the repos; how to get it?\n\nA: This answer is entirely taken from here.\n1) Download both PCManFM-1.0 and libfm-1.0 to a working directory. Download links:\nPCManFM: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcmanfm ... z/download\nlibfm: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcmanfm ... z/download\n2) Working in a terminal emulator (e.g., LXTerminal), unzip libfm-1.0 in the working directory:\n$ tar -xvzf libfm-1.0.tar.gz\n\n3) Change to the new 'libfm-1.0' directory and issue the following command:\n$ ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc\n\nSome requirements may not be satisfied. ('intltool,' 'libgtk2.0-dev,' or 'libmenu-cache1-dev' and other dependencies to install in addition to those three packages, but just let synaptic take care of all that) \n4) Upon successful completion of 3), issue the following command in the 'libfm-1.0' directory:\n$ make\n\n5) Optionally, you can run the following command to make sure everything compiled properly:\n$ make check\n\n6) Install 'libfm-1.0' by issuing the following command:\n$ sudo make install\n\n7) Working in a terminal emulator (e.g., LXTerminal) in the working directory, unzip pcmanfm-1.0.tar.gz:\n$ tar -xvzf pcmanfm-1.0.tar.gz\n\n8) Change to the new 'pcmanfm-1.0' directory\n9) Issue the following commands in succesion, waiting for each to complete before the next:\n$ ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc\n$ make\n$ make check\n$ sudo make install\n\n10) Kill the current running version of PCManFM by issuing the following command from LXTerminal:\n$ killall pcmanfm\n\n11) When trying to start PCManFM from the command line (e.g., $ pcmanfm --desktop), it may indicate that a library (libfm-gtk.so.3) was missing. The library actually may be on the system (in /usr/local/lib/), but not in the place PCManFM is looking (/usr/lib/), so a link is to be created. Two links in fact, to two different libraries (both libfm-gtk.so.3 and libfm.so.3). These are the commands to be used:\n$ cd /usr/lib\n$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libfm-gtk.so.3.0.1 libfm-gtk.so.3\n$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libfm.so.3 libfm.so.3\n\n12) Issue the following command to start PCManFM (or restart computer):\n$ pcmanfm --desktop\n\n", "Q: What is zeitgeist used for? For what does Ubuntu use Zeitgeist?  \nI am using Ubuntu right now and found out that Ubuntu desktop (so unity) work with Zeitgeist core and much more.  \nAre there differences between the film Zeitgeist and the package Zeitgeist. Does this go back to the word's original meaning?\n\nA: Pretty-simplified answer, is that Zeitgeist logs your files accessed, sites visited, etc. (your computer-use-actions) and stores them LOCALLY. If your password is vulnerable, then the Zeitgeist database is just as vulnerable.  Several Linux programmers have deeply investigated 'is Z uploading anything on you', and the answer is no, it is not.  It is to facilitate searches and 'best-fit' to your local query only.  That said, if you are using Firefox, Chrome, etc. as a browser, your browser is already logging your actions and THEY ARE being uploaded, depending on the site you visit and what they want to know relative to metadata.\nIf you want to turn your local Zeitgeist off, simply go to SYSTEM SETTINGS>SECURITY AND PRIVACY SETTINGS (In 14.04LTS, your version may vary), and then on the Files and Applications tab, turn off 'Record Files and Applications' button.  If you're really concerned, delete your history there, too. This clears the database.  Now, Zeitgeist is resident, but turned off.\nMy paranoia stems far more from the logging of ANY browser I use, then from Linux or Ubuntu.\n\nA: Zeitgeist is a German word meaning approximately: \"the spirit of the times\" reference \nIn the context of Ubuntu, it is a software package that remembers your activities to try and assist in narrowing down what you want to do without having to tell the computer as explicitly.  \nIt is no more associated with the movie \"Zeitgeist\" than Hollywood is associated with the production of boards made from holly bushes.  \nMerged in from a comment (thx @izx): Something you might want to read\n", "Q: What is apt-cache used for? Can anyone please define what exactly the APT cache is?\n\nA: apt-cache is a command to manipulate and obtain information from the packages at apt's cache.\nIt creates a repository of information about the packages that are avaiable from your sources list, so this way you can search packages and information about it.\nLet's say you want to install a chat program but you don't know the name of a package for it.\nYou would open a console and type:\nsudo apt-cache search chat\nThis would return a list of packages available and that refer to the word chat.\nTypical operations with apt-cache:\napt-cache add\n\nAdds a package file to the source cache.\napt-cache gencaches\n\nBuilds both the package and source cache\napt-cache showpkg\n\nShow some general information for a single package\napt-cache stats\n\nShow some basic statistics\napt-cache dump\n\nShow the entire file in a terse form\napt-cache dumpavail\n\nPrint an available file to stdout\napt-cache unmet\n\nShow unmet dependencies\napt-cache check\n\nCheck the cache a bit\napt-cache search\n\nSearch the package list for a regex pattern\napt-cache show\n\nShow a readable record for the package\napt-cache depends\n\nShow raw dependency information for a package\napt-cache pkgnames\n\nList the names of all packages\napt-cache dotty\n\nGenerate package graphs for GraphVis\nDon't forget to add package name after the commands listed above.\nSource1\nSource2\n", "Q: Sync custom dictionary: firefox & libreoffice & ubuntu & MS office in windows Something I've wanted to do for years is have all custom dictionaries synching so i never have to add the same words ever again.\n\nThere are some guides for how to sync windows MS office dictionaries across windows machines using dropbox/similar, since Ms office allows one to move the custom dictionary file and point office to it (i.e., in the dropbox folder).\nThere's a guide for how to do this with Firefox in windows, using a program called SyncBack to sync the firefox dictionary between its location and dropbox, so this would keep all firefox dictionaries synched, probably irrespective of OS. [edit: can use hard symbolic links to do this in windows & linux: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/ ]\n\nWhat I really want: a way to sync all dictionaries, all the time. I dual boot between ubuntu & winXP at home, and I have winXP in the office which will be windows 7. This seems like 4 problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Office on windows (easy)\n\n*Firefox, OS unimportant (relatively easy with symbolic link)\n\n*Libreoffice on Ubuntu (potentially easy with symbolic links: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.documentfoundation.libreoffice.user/17000)\n\n*Sharing/syncing/merging MS office's custom.dic, firefox's prefdict.dat and libreoffice's standard.dic.\n\n\nNumber 4 seems like the biggie. My guess would be that libreoffice & word synching looks easiest simply because they're similar programs and use the same extension - I've not looked at the structures.\nCan anyone pitch in with any ideas on how to accomplish this? It seems like this is a problem that (somewhat) plagues users of all OSs and text entry programs, that lends itself to cloud syncing more than many things (tiny files), and yet is still stuck in the wilderness...\n\nA: The problem with syncing all of these things, is that they don't use the same spelling dictionaries and formats. So one would have to create a tool which converted the data between all of the different systems. And also because the systems are all different, they may store different pieces of data, so you may lose some information going from one to another, for example.\nHowever, if all you need to sync is a list of words, and those lists simply have to be converted to different storage formats for each system, then u1db would be a perfect solution for the synchronization portion. You would just need to write all the translation pieces on top.\n", "Q: Is there an easy way to change Ubuntu flavor during upgrade?

The loopback networking interface\n\nis a virtual network device implemented entirely in software.  \n\nBut how is this implementation actually accomplished and how do you manipulate it? \nAs far as I know, IPs are marked as local in the local routing table:  \nip route show table local  \n\nSending to an IP marked as local will trigger the loopback device.  But is this detection done by purely by routing tables or also by some other kernel operations?\nEdit: My ultimate goal is to manipulate the loop-device configuration, so that sending datagrams among my interfaces (two wlan adapters) on my laptop will result in real traffic / datagrams in the network and not in local loops.\n    Interface 1 -> WLAN -> Interface 2 and NOT: Interface 1 -> LOOP -> Interface 2\n\nA: It's entirely handled through the routing tables.\nIt's pretty easy to try out in a virtual machine, if you want to have fun. I don't take responsibility for anything that might happen on the machine where you try this.\nFirst let's change the netmask of lo to 255.255.0.0:\nsudo ip addr del 127.0.0.1/8 dev lo; sudo ip addr add 127.0.0.1/16 dev lo\n\nNow let's look at our lo:\n$ ip -4 addr show dev lo\n1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 16436 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN \n    inet 127.0.0.1/16 scope host lo\n\nWhere would packets to 127.1.1.1 go?\n$ sudo ip route get 127.1.1.1\n127.1.1.1 via 172.16.22.2 dev eth0  src 172.16.22.130 \n    cache  mtu 1500 advmss 1460 hoplimit 64\n\nWe start pinging in another terminal:\n$ ping 127.1.1.1\n\nLet's monitor ICMP traffic on eth0:\n$ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 icmp\ntcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode\nlistening on lo, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes\n07:28:42.060077 IP 172.16.22.130 > 127.1.1.1: ICMP echo request, id 5665, seq 4, length 64\n07:28:43.059920 IP 172.16.22.130 > 127.1.1.1: ICMP echo request, id 5665, seq 5, length 64\n\nI'll leave you with the exercise of changing the netmask of lo on a remote machine to 255.255.0.0 and adding the IP address 127.1.1.1 to their network interface. You can see ICMP replies coming back.

It looks like this version of the package doesn't handle upgrades properly.\nThe easiest solution would be to wait for a fixed version of the package. Since this seems to be a third-party package, you'd have to report this as a bug to whoever made that package.\nYou should be able to work around the bug by moving the /etc/init.d/avgd file out of the way:\nsudo mv /etc/init.d/avgd /etc/init.d/avgd.old\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nThis may leave avgd in a non-working state or cause other trouble.

I installed 12.04 on a brand new hard drive.  I partitioned the hard drive between root, home and swap like I have often read how to do.\nI cannot get this machine to properly shutdown.  I have to hold the power button down now.  Although, for the first few days it properly shutdown.  \nI also cannot get the system to hibernate or suspend properly.

Also, I wonder if it's really bad for the hard drive to force the CPU to shutdown.\n\nA: By swap he means the swap partition. Swap or paging\nTo check your swap partition, you could do one of these:\nGo to Ubuntu Software Center, and install gparted.\nThere you can check all your disk partitions.\n\nA: I don't know is you have solved your problem but if not, check if you have enough swap.\nThe swap partition must provide to receive the contents of the memory. Usually a 1 GB Swap enough. But if you want to hibernate the machine, the easiest way is to make sure the swap size is larger or equal to the amount of RAM you have.\n\nA: To use hibernation, your swap partition should be at minimum the same size as your RAM.\nIn your case it has to be at least 8 GB \n", "Q: building monolithic kernels will improve performace of the system ? i am using ubuntu 12.04 .\n                                  If I build monolithic kernels for device drivers i.e driver will have its own kernel as i understand , will it really improves system performance and device performance ? are there any disadvantages ? \n\nA: A pedantic note: \"monolithic kernel\" means something completely different. Linux kernel is always monolithic, regardless of whether some or all of its modules are built as LKMs or compiled directly into the kernel.\nhttp://tldp.org/HOWTO/Module-HOWTO/x73.html#AEN77\nWhen LKMs are loaded into the kernel, there's absolutely no difference in performance compared to built-in modules as LKMs code runs in the same process as the rest of the kernel, there's no inter-process communication or anything. \n\nLKMs are not slower, by the way, than base kernel modules. Calling\n  either one is simply a branch to the memory location where it resides.\n\nHowever, LKMs can be loaded upon request, so if you take the stock-standard Ubuntu kernel and recompile it with all modules built-in, you'll get a humongous kernel which probably will slow the system down because of using much more RAM for all those unused modules (which possibly will also cause all sorts of conflicts with each other).\nOn the other hand, if you compile a kernel which is custom-tailored to your particular machine and only has the modules for the actual machine's hardware built in, such kernel will likely to be faster than the stock-standard kernel, especially at boot time. I've been playing with a custom kernel for my EeePC on Arch Linux and can report that it's actually noticeably faster:\n\n\n*\n\n*the kernel can be made very slim, including only features your machine actually uses. The whole kernel-eeepc thing is just 4Mb, which makes it faster to load from disk and it uses less RAM when loaded, leaving more memory for user-space programs.\n\n*no modules to load means less disk I/O during boot.\n\n*having hardware drivers built in means no need for hardware probing during boot, which saves time.\n\n*Built-in hardware drivers eliminate the need in the initial ramdisk, so the kernel can be loaded directly by GRUB.\n\n*you can disable other kernel features you don't need, which again shrinks the kernel size and make it faster.\nThe downsides, however, are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatic kernel upgrades become useless, you have to build new kernels from source\n\n*If the machine dies and you plug the disk into another computer the machine probably won't boot.\nAll in all, this is a fun and educational exercise but not something I would consider doing on a machine which is not too hardware-restricted.\n\nA: The only advantage I see at that point is the ability to disable module loading (so even if someone gets root/superuser access they can't load a \"bad\" module).  \nThat being said, it used to be that you got a small performance hike by disabling unused drivers and compiling in loadable modules.  As hardware performance increases, these slight improvements become more and more negligible.\n\nA: I wanted to chime in here. I used to make only monolithic kernels years ago but the kernel today is pretty advanced using a lot of features. As far as I can tell, it won't let you go 100%. I may be mistaken though.\nFrom what I gather, the kernel will unload modules efficiently allowing your system more memory and resources. For me, I only make things module if it's not important. A USB device, for example, will be a module but my EXT4 is all compiled in. Everything with networking too. In addition, I compile the kernel after I've removed everything that I can and I use some additional methods\nFirst, install all your hardware. It might be a USB device like an iPod or flash drive. Then run this:\nmake localmodconfig\nThat will modify the .config to include all your detected hardware and tick it M.\nmake xconfig\nXconfig will give you the menu to remove things but be careful. I make my kernel a low latency for desktop and I add support for my hardware specifically.\nFinally, the additional features of your CPU can be used if GCC is up to date and you use the following:\nCONCURRENCY_LEVEL=getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN CFLAGS=\"-march=bdver1 -mtune=bdver1\" CXXFLAGS=\"${CFLAGS}\" make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-MyKernelVersionNameHere kernel_image kernel_headers\nThat will start the kernel building process using all of the available CPUs to build it, PLUS special support for the AMD Zambezi CPU. Change \"bdver1\" to match your specific CPU and chance MyKernelVersionNameHere to fit your own kernel naming convention.\nIn the end is it faster? I think YES. I recompiled the kernel, GCC, WINE and I can play most Windows PC games better in Linux than they play in Windows. \n", "Q: python3 support in quantal? In quantal, python3 is supposed to be the default version of python. However, it seems that e.g. python-matplotlib package is only packaged for python 2.7 (and there is no python3-matplotlib). What is the transition plan? When is python3 going to be fully supported, including major packaged 3rd party modules?\n\nA: While Python 3.x will be included by default in Quantal, it does not mean it will be the default (/usr/bin/python will remain python2, and without python2 installed will not exist). Also, as you have noticed, all upstreams of python packages have not added support for Python 3 yet.\nFor all upstreams to be able to support Python 3, it is going to be a very long and arduous journey. Even while Ubuntu may have only python3 installed by default, it doesn't mean python2 won't be used by other applications, or that all packages will support it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 not starting (dual boot) I have Windows XP and Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop.  I've had XP on the laptop for years, and installed Ubuntu 12.04 a few months ago.  For some reason, Ubuntu 12.04 has stopped working.\nWhen I power on the laptop, I get the GRUB menu, and I can select Windows XP or Ubuntu 12.04.  If I select Windows XP, it boots up perfectly and I can use it as normal. However, if I select Ubuntu 12.04, It just displays a terminal type blank screen with no text except the blinking cursor, but no commands execute if I try typing something in.\nHow do I fix this so I can boot back into Ubuntu 12.04?  I know I can try a reinstall, but I don't want to lose the files I have in Ubuntu 12.04.  Is it possible to somehow do a repair?\n\nA: There are many things that could have happened. \n\n\n*\n\n*you can try reinstalling grub. \n\n*try booting with usb/live cd and hunt for issue there, ie, disk check, log check\n\n*you can try to access recovery in the grub menu list, maybe its a graphics error\n\n\nA: It is possible that the grub MBR has been damaged, or that it is pointing to the wrong place for Ubuntu.\nYou can repair the grub using BootRepair (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair).\nAlternatively, you can try this simple procedure first. If it doesn't solve the problem, use BootRepair:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot with Ubuntu Live CD\n\n*Open terminal (command prompt)\n\n*Type: sudo fdisk -l\nYou will get a list of partitions, similar to the following list:\n/dev/sda1 13 102400 de Dell Utility\n/dev/sda2 * 13 1926 15360000 7 HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda3 1926 30892 232676566 7 HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda4 30893 60802 240245761 5 Extended\n/dev/sda5 30893 59584 230467584 83 Linux\n/dev/sda6 59585 60802 9777152 82 Linux swap / Solaris \n\nUbuntu partition is the one with the name \"Linux\" (not necessarily the one with the star, although could be).\nOn this case is on '/dev/sda5' so we have to mount it:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\n(replace 'sda5' with the partition name in your case)\n\n*And then install grub: sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\n\n*Reboot and verify that all is working fine.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: I had more or less the same problem last week...

The installer will reinstall all the packages that were previously installed and it worked for me.\nvar is overwritten, so by example as the home of postgres was in var, this one was gone... \n", "Q: Sound lag in VLC after I resume from a paused movie I recently made a shift to Linux and this never used to happen when I was using windows. After I pause a movie and I press play again, there is a sound lag. I have to restart the movie every time I have to pause it. Is this fixable?\n\nA: Most likely, your videos are poorly encoded.  \nThis doesn't happen with all videos in my experience.  It has to do with there being a large chunk of audio/video data without key-frames or re-syncs of audio and video.  \nI've seen it occur, but when it happens in VLC it is most often a poorly encoded video.  \nIn order to fix it, re-encode the video with the h264/aac presets, and it should be fine.\n", "Q: Array manipulation in gsettings' set command Is there an easy way to do array manipulation in gsettings? I am comparing gsettings to OS X's defaults command  that offers the defaults domain --array key overwrite-value and defaults domain --array-add key added-value interface for manipulating arrays.\nAs far as I can tell there is only gsettings set domain key \"['overwrite-value']\" available to gsettings. Not really pretty for when you want to add or remove one entry from an array.\nI have seen a suggestion that allow me to add to an array, but I would rather use a interface if there is one.\n\nA: No, gsettings doesn't support any array operations except getting and setting the whole array.\n", "Q: Sony Vaio PCG-71315L \"Wireless is disabled by hardware switch\" Help!

When I did so, it did everything like normal. Whatever. But whenever I want to re-enable Wifi and Bluetooth, it just has \"Enable Wireless\" and \"Enable bluetooth\" grayed out in the respective things on the top-right of the desktop. I am using 12.04 Precise Pangolin on a Dell laptop that has never had wireless problems before. Clicking the grayed-out part does nothing. Re-logging and restarting has no effect, and I'm on an account that has full administrative permission. \nMy attempts:\n~$ sudo dmesg | grep wlan0\n[19.960211] ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready\n\n.\n~$ sudo dmesg | grep blue\n\n[[nothing]]\nWhat do I do to manually re-enable wireless and bluetooth? \n\nA: I found that under my \"Bluetooth settings\", I couldn't click anything and it said it was disabled by hardware switch. \nSo, I looked at my keyboard, and there's kind of this radio tower over \"F2\" in the color of the FN button.

Don't mess with the system configuration files as this will make system upgrades more complicated.\n\nA: I solved this for my system by removing the Calibri font, installing Carlito, which is \"metric-compatible with Calibri\" and is packaged with \"a mapping entry to fontconfig (local.conf),\" refreshing my font cache, and restarting LibreOffice:\n$ rm ~/.fonts/microsoft/CALIBRI*\n$ sudo apt install fonts-crosextra-carlito\n$ fc-cache\n\nHere's a before and after with Microsoft at the top and Carlito below:\n\nYou can do the same with Caladea for Cambria with fonts-crosextra-caladea and you can use Croscore fonts Arimo, Tinos, and Cousine for Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier New with fonts-croscore.\nSee my full post for more details.\n\nA: Fonts like Calibri and Cambria resort to using embedded bitmaps when adjusted to small sizes.\nTo disable this font behaviour, put the following into $HOME/.fonts.conf:\n<match target=\"font\" >\n     <edit name=\"embeddedbitmap\" mode=\"assign\">\n         <bool>false</bool>\n     </edit>\n</match>\n\nCreate the file if it doesn't exist.\nRestart to take effect.\nSources\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=724818 (registration required)\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man5/fonts-conf.5.html\nNOTE:\n$HOME/.fonts.conf is deprecated in Ubuntu 12.10\nInstead, paste the above XML code (as root) in /etc/fonts/conf.d/50-user.conf\n\nA: I ran into this issue on Ubuntu LTS 18.04, and then again after upgrading to 20.04 LTS. Calibri looked horrible on LibreOffice and Firefox. The above method worked for me as follows:\nCreate the file described above and save as fonts.conf in $HOME/.config/fontconfig\nThen rebuild the font cache: sudo fc-cache -fv\nI'm not sure if the last step was necessary, but I did it anyway before checking the font rendering.\nCalibri now looks perfect on LibreOffice and in Firefox.\n", "Q: Broken BURG install after backup/restore Long story short:  BURG is stuck in text mode and I can't seem to get it back to the eye-candy.  I have purged and then re-installed to no avail.  I am running 12.04.\nThe long story:  I originally installed onto 12.04 using Super-boot-manager (BURG-manager) and then stopped using it in favour of GRUB because I had too many entries.  I then had to backup and restore Ubuntu (partition was deleted and re-created) due to unrelated issues.  I re-installed GRUB2 and booted into Ubuntu to re-install BURG, but after re-booting it appears to be stuck in text mode (looks exactly like GRUB 1).\nAny ideas?  I know I'm not supposed to be using it on 12.04 (I think) but it worked before, so what's up?\n\nA: You need to uninstall BURG with:\nsudo apt-get purge burg burg-common burg-pc burg-themes burg-themes-common\n\nAnd manually delete \"burg\" folder in \"/boot\".\nAfter this install BURG again.\n\nA: Problem seems to be gone after a reinstall of entire multiboot - but I still don't know why.

I also tried ntfsundelete in Linux which shows that this file cannot be recovered. \nI would appreciate any help very much! I have lost a lot of data. What could have happened? Is there any chance of recovering this file?\n\nA: Two things could have happened.  \n1)The resize/shrink had some bug that caused the file to get \"lost\" (possible, but not horribly likely)  \n2)The partition was forcibly unmounted before cached disk writes were flushed (a lot more likely with a 30GB write to an external drive, even moreso if you piped tar or something to that effect)  \nIn the prior case, recovery may be possible with FTK, foremost, scalpel, or some other tool.  In the latter case, complete recovery is a LOT less likely.  \nEither way, complete recovery is less than likely.\n\nA: I'd try with human error - is there a chance that you didn't uncheck \"format\" checkbox for this ntfs partition?\n", "Q: Why I'm not able to install wine on x64?

Now, under 12.04 LTS (64 bit) I can access the card in the camera and see the various folders, but cannot see the image files, nor can I import them to the HDD. \n\nA: There are basically two main options here:\n1) The first solution is that perhaps your camera isn't properly mounted; you can actually browse the files in the .gvfs folder in your home folder if it has been mounted correctly (you will need to check show hidden files in your file browser).\nThe location of the gvfs folder for Ubuntu 12.10 and beyond is now: /run/user/username/gvfs.\nSee also my other answer below where I go into more details about manually mounting a camera (it is actually not model specific so may be very useful for you):\n\n\n*\n\n*Can't transfer photos from Kodak Easy Share C195 Camera\n2) Take the memory card out and use a card-reader to access the files and use software that is specifically designed for that purpose and can import your photos into a meaningful directory structure.

I've been trying to enable sound for the linux-virtual kernel as I want to run an ultra slim Ubuntu server under VirtualBox but need audio. The resource usage difference between virtual and generic/server is surprisingly large, with the virtual kernel system using 80Mb less RAM after a clean boot (130Mb vs 210Mb), and I really want to squeeze every clock cycle and available byte I can out of the system. Besides, the virtual kernel has some additional optimisations enabled specifically for virtual machines (or so I am told). \nNow I have compiled my own kernel a few times in the past, for example to include the Intel-PHC module (for improved power management on Thinkpads), so the concept is not entirely alien to me, but I've run into a strange problem which I'm hoping someone can help explain: When I do a diff between the config files for Linux-generic and Linux-virtual there are precious few differences, and certainly none which pertain to sound support; there are really only five or six lines which differ, and they're mainly to do with i/o timing, sleep state and priorities. What gives? I expected the differences to be extensive, and that I would be able to identify the options that enabled audio by looking at them, but my problem doesn't seem to be related to the config file at all (yes, I know about the sound drivers section - it is identical between the two kernel configs). Am I looking in the wrong place? \nMany thanks! \n\nA: The -virtual kernel does not auto-load the snd module, that's the only difference (it contains snd and all its various sub-modules).\nSimply run sudo modprobe snd to enable sound. To make this permanent, just add snd to the list in /etc/modules and run sudo update-initramfs -u.\nIf any modules appear to be missing, please install the linux-image-extra-virtual (Linux kernel extra modules for virtual machines) package.\n\nNote: in my experience, the other things a -virtual kernel may suffer from and which may need manual loading include no support for Unity 3D/OpenGL emulation, no bluetooth and no enhanced USB HID support.\n\n", "Q: Mount network NTFS drive as NFS I have a NTFS NAS mounted on my Ubuntu PC (11.10) to /mnt/nas2/\nI wish to set this up as an network drive so my Windows PC can access it.

Bear with me, to be honest I have no idea what Wireless radio portions are.... At my school, I was told my the user support that the wireless network in my dorm uses 801.11 A/B/G/N. For some reason, the wireless in my room doesn't work. However, other buildings use only A/B/G, they say.

Now he is my friend and I trust him so I was not reluctant in sharing my password. And I did change it afterwards.\nBut it just struck me how can I view all the commands that were executed by some other user remote logging into my system (obviously not my friend. I mean in general).To what extent can they access my data (especially my passwords eg I use Last Pass so can they access my account passwords as well??)\nAnd if they open any browser after logging into my system do they have access to all my passwords provided I have saved them using the \"remember password\" option given by chrome\nAlso what precautions I should take when I am allowing some one to remote login in my system and how can I track the various commands used by them or the changes they made in my system. Also is there some simple way to get notified whenever some one logs into my system apart from checking the /var/log/auth.log file??\n\nA: There was a similar problem that struck me after reading this question here on AskUbuntu and checking my VPS, only to see a bazillion of brute force attempts. That is when I decided to take action.\nNow according to the question I linked to, if you would like to see failed login attempts on your machine over ssh (could be brute force attempts or anything), try typing this:\ngrep sshd.\\*Failed /var/log/auth.log | less\n\nIf the output consists of multiple lines, that is many brute force attempts, especially if they have happened between short intervals, you might want to do the following pieces of action:\nChange the ssh configuration file\nTo do this, open the file located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config with your favourite editor, like this vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\n1. Try to move ssh from port 22:  Now locate the line that reads:\n# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for\nPort 22\n\nand comment out Port 22, and use anyone you might like. Example:\n# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for\n# Port 22\nPort 28934\n\nPlease remember that ports below 1024 need special (root) permission. I do not know how this could interfere with it, but I am just saying.\n2. Disable Root logins via ssh: Since the root username is predictable and provides complete access to your system, providing unfettered access to this account over SSH is unwise. Locate the line reading PermitRootLogin and set it to no.\nPermitRootLogin no\n\n3. Disable password authentication: Generate and use SSH keys to log into your system. Without passwords enabled, attackers will need to guess (or steal) your SSH private key in order to gain access to your server. Something that is very very difficult. Proceed to find the line that reads PasswordAuthentication and set it to no\nPasswordAuthentication no\n\n!WARNING! Before doing so, please consult this guide over here on how to set up certificate authentication.\nNOTE: After you have made the changes use sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart. To connect to another port via ssh use: ssh username@hostname.com -p <port_number>.\nSetup a firewall\nPlease check out this guide on how to set up the extremely powerful and effective firewall, which is integrated into Linux, IPTables.\nSetup scripts to help you with security\nOne that I use personally and quickly comes to mind is Fail2Ban. Fail2ban will monitor your log files for failed login attempts. After an IP address has exceeded the maximum number of authentication attempts, it will be blocked at the network level and the event will be logged in /var/log/fail2ban.log. To install it: sudo apt-get install fail2ban\nCheck command history via ssh\nThere is a linux command, named history, which allows you to see which commands have been input up until that point. Try typing history in a terminal to get to see all commands up to that point. It could help if you were root.\nTo search for a particular command try: history | grep command-name\nTo list all commands after ssh: fc -l ssh\nYou can also edit commands using vi (haven't tried it vim, though I assume it works as well): fc -e vi\nYou can also delete the history: history -c\nNOTE: If you are not a fan of the command history there is also a file in your home directory (cd ~), called .bash_history (if you are using bash) that you can cat to see all that has been typed in the bash shell.\n\nA: SSH is not fully secure in its default configuration.\n\nIf you provide a password to allow a remote user to connect via SSH to your computer, these rights need to be revoked to stop ongoing access.\nChanging your password does NOT revoke these rights.\n", "Q: /etc/postfix/transport missing; what should it look like?

Ubuntu in general case can't run Windows executables, just as Windows can't run Linux or MacOS executables. \nSome of those files are self-extracting archives - to assist you with using such files, Ubuntu can open them using the standard archive program. This explains the error you see when clicking on the file - Ubuntu thinks it's an archive and it isn't.\nThere is a compatibility layer, called Wine, which can be installed in Ubuntu to enable you to run Windows exe files (to some extent). After you install it, you'll be able to right-click on a file and choose Open With -> Wine program loader from the dropdown menu.\n\nA: This happens because the file you attempt to open is a Windows .exe, which means that the file format follows the PE (Portable executable) which Linux doesn't handle. Linux executables are in a file format called ELF (Executable and Linkable Format). So unless you have software in the exact file format the operating system can operate on, I doubt that you may be able to use it.\nYou are not completely out of luck though, as there are several compatibility layers. As Sergey mentioned Wine is a relatively mature piece of software that allows Windows executables to be run on Linux. While it succeeds most of the time, it would be wise to check its software compatibility database, to make sure that it can support the specific software you are attempting to run.\n", "Q: Where I'm making the mistake in here document?

And specifically, what does the @ symbol mean in this example? \nI have read that these files have a security function, and that is why I am concerned. I am new to Ubuntu and don't know whether “unknown” file type is as ominous in Ubuntu as it is in Windows. My computer is not networked to any other, and was not attached to the Internet when these files were created.\nAre these “unknown” files any indication of intrusion or hijack of my system? Anything I should worry about?\n\nA: Most of those files relate to your X server and are totally benign. Their contents is specific to the application which created them and generally you should not change them.\n\n\n*\n\n*.ICEauthority is explained here.\n\n*.XAuthority is explained here.\n\n*.xsession-errors is an error log.\n\n*.pulse-cookie is a PulseAudio authentication cookie.\n\n*.profile contains commands which are executed when you log in.\nYou may edit this file's contents.\n\n\nA: \"unknown\" in this case means that the file browser you are using doesn't know what format (image, text, etc) they are, and has nothing to do with security or security  problems.  A different file browser would likely show a different file type for those rather than \"unknown\".  \nAll of the files you listed are normally created by legitimate programs on your computer, and your computer will not operate correctly without them.  \nIf you are concerned about malicious programs on your computer, install and run something like chkrootkit:  https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/chkrootkit\n\nA: The file browser uses MIME type detection to identify a file and show its type. MIME type detection utilizes a series of heuristics, like looking at the file's content, maybe its extension, and so on, to try to intelligently determine the kind of data it contains. Files that show as \"unknown\" didn't contain any data that MIME type detection could identify. That doesn't mean they're suspect or invalid; it just means that the MIME type detection didn't know about those file types.\nYou can use the mimetype command on the command line to see how type detection is done for each file. Use the -D parameter to see the criteria it used to determine file type:\n$ mimetype -D .ICEauthority \n> Data dirs are: /home/roadmr/.local/share, /usr/share/ubuntu, /usr/share/gnome, /usr/local/share, /usr/share\n> Checking inode type\n> Checking globs for basename '.ICEauthority'\n> Checking for extension '.ICEauthority'\n> Checking globs for basename '.iceauthority'\n> Checking for extension '.iceauthority'\n> File exists, trying default method\n> First 10 bytes of the file contain control chars\n.ICEauthority: application/octet-stream\n\nContrast this with a known file:\n$ mimetype -D .xsession-errors\n> Data dirs are: /home/roadmr/.local/share, /usr/share/ubuntu, /usr/share/gnome, /usr/local/share, /usr/share\n> Checking inode type\n> Checking globs for basename '.xsession-errors'\n> File exists, trying default method\n.xsession-errors: text/plain\n\nFrom this you can see that files that are detected as \"application/octet-stream\" will be shown as \"unknown\".\n", "Q: Best control panel for Ubuntu 12.04 server I am looking for up-to-date control panel that is compatible with 12.04 and easy to install.

Use synaptic to do this.\n", "Q: Software for picture database I would like to organise my growing collection of pictures into a database, which is searchable by filename or associated words (tags).\nHow would I best accomplish this?\n\nA: My personal favourite is gthumb image viewer. You should search for it in the Ubuntu Software Centre and give it a try to see if it suits your needs.\n\nA: Probably the best photo database program for your purposes is Shotwell, which is available in the repositories and the official site is here. \nThis program has excellent tagging and search features. The two screenshots demonstrate this and show how you create a tag by going to the tag menu and selecting new tag and entering the name for it; you can also give it multiple tags at once which is very useful. You can also highlight with the mouse all the pictures you want to be tagged, click new tag and then your tag wil be applied to them all so you don't have to individually tag each one. You will then see an entry in the left hand sidebar (see second screenshot) which will give a list of your tags and you will be able to click them to see all the tagged pictures.\nThere is also a lot of search functionality built in to Shotwell so you can find pictures by tag, rating and by date as Shotwell reads the exif information of the photos. \nYou can import what you want into Shotwell by cancelling the auto import when it starts and going to the file menu and selecting 'import from folder'. If the database ever gets corrupt, you can remove it from the hidden .shotwell folder in your home folder; and of course you can back it up as well.\n\n\n\nA: The major choices would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shotwell - installed by default in 12.04 desktop\n\n*Picasa - Google have discontinued providing linux packages, but the latest Windows version installs and runs quite happily with the wine emulation layer. (Install wine using apt-get or the Software Center then download the windows installer and run with wine).\n\n\nA: I would recommend F-Spot is a personal photo manager.\n\nImport your pictures from your hard drive, a digital camera or even an\n  iPod and F-Spot will quickly import them, ready for you to view.\nYou can tag and categorise your photos, make a Photo CD, export to the\n  online Flickr service, perform basic colour-correction and editing,\n  and much more. Towards the top of the main F-Spot window is a timeline\n  - just drag the slider to view the photos you took around a specific date. There is a fullscreen mode and a slideshow feature for showing\n  your photos to others, and a full image metatdata display for the\n  technically-minded.  Part of the default Ubuntu installation 1\n\n1Source:Ubuntu Documentation\n\nA: DigiKam is an absolute monster of an image management program, completely dwarfing any competing program in comparison. \n\nI used to use F-spot to manage my 50K+ library of photos - it was ok-ish although it didn't understand some file formats (more annoyingly, sometimes support disappeared in newer versions) and more than once I had to deal with database corruption when upgrading from version to version. When it was demoted from the position of the default image manager in Ubuntu, the development slowed. I liked f-spot to the point of checking out its source and spending a few days trying to figure out if I can fix some most pressing problems myself. \nThen I briefly tried to use Shotwell. Didn't like it - it was (and I believe is) extremely simplified even compared to f-spot.  @eric-yorba suggests that it could actually address some of my problems with f-spot, but when I tested it felt very feature-incomplete compared to f-spot and I couldn't find a way to get photos into it without physically \"importing\" all 200+Gb of photos, which would create a copy of all my files.\nThe main weakness of the above programs is that they use their database as the principal source of information about your collection - i.e. there's a notion of \"importing\" photos into the program, you can't just copy a few folders from a flash drive into your library. Which leads to all sorts of issues with \"orphan images\", database corruption etc. Another important thing is to make sure the program writes all the metadata (tags etc.) back into images' EXIF and can then successfuly re-import your collection and restore all the tags in case the database gets corrupt and you have to delete it.\nDigiKam, apart from supporting any feature you can think of (especially regarding tagging/labelling/searching photos), uses the filesystem as the primary source - i.e. if you manually place some files into your image library they'll appear in the program automatically. New versions come out regularly.\nDigiKam is available in Ubuntu repositories, although, as a KDE application, it pulls down a few dependencies from KDE world.\n", "Q: Automated login and screen lock My computer only has a single user that is used for normal log in.\nOn boot, it would be convenient of the system would log in that user automatically, and then optionally, lock the screen, such as by launching a password protected screen saver.\nSuggestions?\n\nA: Set your user for automatic login in System Settings -> User Accounts -> Automatic Login (you will need to press the \"unlock\" button and enter your password before you can change the automatic login setting).\nThe command gnome-screensaver-command -l will cause the screen to be immediately locked, which can probably be added to your autostart items.\nUsing gedit (or other text editor of choice), create /home/USERNAME/.config/autostart/screen_lock.desktop with contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Lock Screensaver\nExec=gnome-screensaver-command -l\n\nAnd hopefully it will automatically login and then lock the screen.\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS with Gnome 3.28.2 and this worked for me.\nSet a user to auto-login, either via the GUI or by editing /etc/gdm3/custom.conf.\nOn the desktop, click on Show Applications, type in \"Start\" and you'll see the \"Startup Applications Preferences\", open it, click on Add, give it whatever Name and Comment you'd like and put the following in the Command input:\ndbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.gnome.ScreenSaver /org/gnome/ScreenSaver org.gnome.ScreenSaver.Lock\n\nOn re-boot, it will auto-login and immediately lock the screen for whatever user you set up in /etc/gdm3/custom.conf.\n\nA: What you ask is almost a normal setup.

This image shows the checkbox as off (You can not use automatic log in with an encrypted home).\n\nAfter install you can still set this at the accounts settings:\n\nThe screen lock is by default set to ask for a password. Have a look at this topic for more information: How do I disable the screensaver/lock? on where to find it. The setting where you can do this looks like this:\n\nIt is about not setting the lock but you just have to set it the other way.\n\nA: This is an old question but this is the best option:\nSet your user for automatic login\necho \"AutomaticLoginEnable=True\" | sudo tee -a /etc/gdm3/custom.conf\necho \"AutomaticLogin=$(whoami)\" | sudo tee -a /etc/gdm3/custom.conf\n\nOr change in Settings -> Users -> Automatic Login\nWrite a script\ngnome-screensaver can do the job but we have to make shure its available when the machine runs the code.

The reason I put this issue in the askubuntu is because we used to use OpenSuse and never had an issue with it, admittedly that was version 11.2 or earlier so its still and old kernel, but I figured I would ask here first anyway.\nAny suggestions of places to look would be appreciated.\n\nA: The messages you see in kern.log indicate that there is a bug in the kernel you are using, possibly this one: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16206.\n", "Q: Which version of Ubuntu can I install on these specs? I want to install Ubuntu on my PC. Which version would suit a desktop and these specifications?\nMy specs :-\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD Atholon 64 3000+\n\n*1GB DDR RAM\n\n*750GB\n\n*ASUS K8V-MX main board\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Xubuntu is perfect for your computer. Personally, I have used Xubuntu on a 10 year old laptop with 1 GB of RAM, a Pentium 4 processor and with poor SiS integrated graphics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xubuntu uses the Xfce Desktop Environment, which is much less resource intensive than standard Ubuntu. With hardly anything running, I am only using 150mb+ as opposed to at least 300+ on standard Ubuntu with 2d Unity.\n\n*An absolute necessity with Xubuntu is to go to settings > settings manager > Windows Manager Tweaks > compositing tab and disable all special compositing effects. This increases performance of all gui programs and makes moving and opening multiple windows much snappier. Also, having the compositor on interferes with full screen video and hardware accelerated video for some players such as VLC. I wanted to point this out as it is very useful for someone who is trying out Xubuntu; it makes a massive difference to performance.\n\n*Also, use command-line programs instead of resource demanding gui programs to do certain tasks; it's quicker and more efficient; for example, use ripit to rip cds, wodim and growisofs to burn disks, and ImageMagick to rename/covert photos. There are many more examples, and once you start experimenting with command-line programs you realise that you can do much more with a relatively small amount of memory.\n\n*Thunar, the file browser on Xubuntu is very light weight and an excellent alternative to Nautilus. In general, if you use the lightweight Xfce apps such as Ristretto (image manager), Xfburn, gmusicbrowser, etc, you should be ok with less than 1 GB RAM.\n\n*Obviously keep startup items and running services to a minimum and remove those you don't need like Bluetooth etc.\n\n*Use keyboard shortcuts- it's amazing how using just some of these makes the OS feel more responsive and increases productivity. On Xubuntu, for example, the quickest way to resize windows is with alt + right mouse click; and the best way to move windows is with alt + left mouse click. \nWith these tips you should get great performance on Xubuntu, as I do on my ancient machine. \nThe screenshot below shows the neat desktop I have arranged for Xubuntu with the menu at the top left; key launchers and apps pinned to the panel on the top right and workspaces in the bottom right. Programs when launched appear on the bottom panel.\n\n\nA: What counts most here is not the \"version\" (e.g.Precise 12.04 instead of Oneiric 11.10), but the desktop environment that comes on top of the Ubuntu OS (Xfce/Xubuntu vs Unity vs KDE/Kubuntu). Beyond all these, there is one operating system.\nSorry to disagree with people here, but I do not think that 1 GB of RAM is sufficient to run in full comfort (that is smoothly, especially in using the Internet) the Ubuntu desktop which in fact is Unity. It is true that official sources state that Ubuntu/Unity will be installed and will run with 512 RAM etc but a question like the above does not refer to pure technical facts but to the practical and personal experience of the user in these circumstances.\nI myself have a 1GB RAM computer and had to migrate from Windows to Ubuntu because decisive software like the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome would not run as good as before due to the new standards and demands of the Internet environment. As going from XP to Win7 would not have improved things for me, I installed Xubuntu. Everything changed instantly, my computer rejuvenated. But at the same time I installed Gnome and Unity, and there my computer was dead sluggish. So, I understood that Unity (and also KDE/Kubuntu) is for users that come to Ubuntu for other reasons than for trying to put to work older computers. From my point of view I would not use Unity on a computer that would not be able to run Win7 as well.\nTo continue my little story, in my 1GB RAM computer Xubuntu runs like XP would have in the era of Firefox 3.5. But here I am now up to date with all main programs. But  I have succeeded even more with the same computer, a better experience than I ever had in Windows (even when this PC was up to date). I was able to get more speed, snappy response, and also stylish appearance by employing the 1GB RAM PC into the LXDE/Lubuntu enviromnment. Which, along with Xubuntu/Xfce, I recommend for similar specs. For KDE and Unity, get 2GB RAM.\nTo really understand how the computer copes with the different desktop environments, one can install all the other desktop environments: Unity, Gnome, KDE, Xfce and LXDE (to have the specific dependencies use lubuntu-desktop instead of LXDE and so forth) although, in order to avoid risks of conflicts with the main installation, a usb-live testing is the best.\nI think that the illustrative pictures that people see on the Internet for Xubuntu and Lubuntu desktops are misleadingly simplistic compared to Unity, and so people tend to chose the later no matter their specs. But to make the former ones look stylish is easy. Here is a Xubuntu desktop:\n \nAnd Lubuntu/LXDE:\n\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS will work on those specs.\nI would not personally use 64-bit, unless you add further RAM.  Anything over 2GB would be fine.\n\nA: You can install one of the following Ubuntu derivative on your machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lubuntu 12.04\n\n*Xubuntu 12.04\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity 2D session\nLubuntu and Xubuntu are very light weight and suitable for Old PC, you can see their web site and compare their features, but i recommend you install Ubuntu 12.04 and use Unity 2D.\n\nA: Pretty much the standard 12.04 LTS.\n\nThe minimum memory requirement for Ubuntu 12.04 is 384 MB of memory\n  for Ubuntu Desktop. Note that some of your system's memory may be\n  unavailable due to being used by the graphics card. If your computer\n  has only the minimum amount of memory, the installation process will\n  take longer than normal; however, it will complete successfully, and\n  the system will perform adequately once installed.\n\nSource.\nFeel free to download Ubuntu from its official download site, and burn it on a LiveCD to test it on your computer without any changes to see if it suits your needs.\n", "Q: Firefox losing functions after opening a link from Dash I'm using Firefox as default browser in 12.04.1 LTS.

Ever since I joined the *nix side of the world I've been hearing about mailing lists a lot (especially when it comes to development).\nCan someone explain to me what they are and how I can interact with them?\n\nA: Not sure how this relates to Ubuntu, but a mailing list is like a collection of names (emails) and addresses used by an individual or an organization to send material to multiple recipients. \nFor example there's a mailing list of Ubuntu, it would be like a collection of people's email, that would send and receve emails to all of the people that belong to that list.\nThe mailing list term is often extended to include the people subscribed to such a list, so the group of subscribers is referred to as \"the mailing list\", or simply \"the list\".\nOn mailing lists you can subscribe or unsubscribe to the list, thus belonging or not and receiving or not all the info that is beeing exchanged by the mailing list users.\nListwashing is the process through which individual entries in mailing lists are removed. These mailing lists typically contain email addresses or phone numbers of those that have not voluntarily subscribed. An entry is removed from the list after a complaint is received.\nSource\n\nA: Mailing lists are used in a lot of open source projects. They are essentially a server you send email to and that broadcasts the email on to a load of subscribers. This simple model has a few functions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Few to many/announcements. It's common that a release mailing list will have a few people who can broadcast email about updates and releases. People who need to know about these subscribe.\n\n*Devel/discussion. These are more like a forum where developers are free to table and talk over development topics.\n\n*Support. Identical in method to a discussion list but set aside for users to ask support questions, like here.\nHow you use them is largely up to you. You can read Ubuntu's without anything more than a browser as they are all publicly archived. If you want to subscribe (so that new messages are delivered into your inbox) you can from the list's listinfo page.\nIf you want to be able to post, most lists will require that you subscribe first. For some subjects this also requires that a moderator authorises you to send email. But sending the messages after that point is no harder than sending an email to the list's email address.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can see all the Ubuntu lists here: https://lists.ubuntu.com\n\n*Each list might run its own rules (see the listinfo page, example)\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to share an Exchange calendar with another outlook user using Thunderbird/Lightning?

Dont want it chewing through all my memory ha!\nThanks\n\nA: \nThis sets the maximum amount of memory in bytes that a script is\n  allowed to allocate. This helps prevent poorly written scripts for\n  eating up all available memory on a server. Note that to have no\n  memory limit, set this directive to -1.\nPrior to PHP 5.2.1, in order to use this directive it had to be\n  enabled at compile time by using --enable-memory-limit in the\n  configure line. This compile-time flag was also required to define the\n  functions memory_get_usage() and memory_get_peak_usage() prior to\n  5.2.1.\nWhen an integer is used, the value is measured in bytes. Shorthand\n  notation, as described in this FAQ, may also be used.\n\nThis is a quote from php documentation. Basically its gives your php scripts access to as much memory as they need. Probably not good practice. But there you go.\nThanks \nBill\n", "Q: I can't turn on wifi after installed Ubuntu It shows that my laptop is now airplane mode, i can't turn on wifi.

Made my day going. \n", "Q: Using WiFi with 12.04 causes network to crash I just came home to my parents' house after a year abroad, during which I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop. In that year I was using wired internet via the Ethernet port on my laptop almost exclusively, and had very few problems with my laptop.\nHowever, when I came home I started to use the wireless and the problem started.\nFirstly, when I use the WiFi in Ubuntu, the connection is exceptionally weak, usually no more than two bars of signal (judging by the indicator applet) and speed is fairly minimal.\nSecondly, using the WiFi for more than about an hour (I haven't actually measured it, but sometimes it's more, sometimes less) causes not only my laptop to disconnect from the network, but any other connected device to disconnect as well. The only solution is to restart the router.\nThirdly, when I do connect to the network, I get an error message telling me that there's a problem with using a .local address (I can't remember the exact wording).\nCurrently, I am writing this in Windows 7 (on the same laptop) with no issues whatsoever, so it is nothing to do with my laptop/wireless card. It is just a problem with Ubuntu.\nThis is the router we use, and these are the specifications of my laptop.\nI've had a good search already, but not much seems to work.\nI intend to try this next, and I will post an update when I have tried it.\nI am open to just about any solution, barring buying a new router/laptop/wireless card etc.\nUPDATE: This only appears to be an issue when I've used the battery at any point whilst Ubuntu is loaded. \n\nA: The Acer Nplify adapter you have is most probably a rebranded Atheros card. Try installing the latest drivers and see if it makes a difference:\nType/paste the following, line-by-line, in a terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-`uname -r`\nwget -O- http://linuxwireless.org/download/compat-wireless-2.6/compat-wireless.tar.bz2 | tar -xj\ncd compat-wireless-*\n./scripts/driver-select atheros\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThen reboot.\n\nA: With Ubuntu you should use routers running open source software (DD-WRT, OpenWRT).  You can find them in any junk computer shop or a friend's pile of gear he has replaced with newer stuff, or on kijiji or any classified service that has electronics.\nDD-WRT and OpenWRT and their derivatives like Tomatao just have no problems, ever, with a Linux driver for Wi-Fi.  You can find answers to any conceivable problem online as well, or from a knowledgeable friend who is already using DD-WRT or OpenWRT on their own router.\nEven if you can't replace your existing router or modem combination for some reason, just put another router running the open source software on an Ethernet wire connected to your existing router.  Put that extension router on another floor, ideally where you have poor Wi-Fi connectivity.  Put it on \"ad hoc\" mode with an IP number high enough (say 200) not to interfere with your existing router's operations.  Tell it to hand out IP numbers in some high range (say .201+) that will not interfere with your main router.  Then make all your secure and high reliability connections through that DD-WRT router.  If you got one with a USB port, great, you now have a secure network drive too.\nMake sure also to set your Tx (transceiver) power to the maximum.  On old Cisco/Linksys WRT54G and WRT54G2 for instance the default (which you can't change with stock software) is 71 mw, but the radio is actually capable of 251mw (which DD-WRT lets you set).  Voila triple router power.  That resolves quite a few wireless problems as well.\nSeriously, are you using an operating system from the company that made your desktop or laptop?  No?  Then why are you using an operating system from the company that made your router?  Hardware companies can't do software, they can't hire the best software people.  Get your router software from people who do that, only that, all the time.\nAnd tell your ISP to start shipping and supporting open source software on devices, not the garbage from the vendors they presently use.\n", "Q: How to start Ubuntu installer in a graphical safe mode?

If you have restored whole of your home folder, then these should be already restored.\nThe system wide configuration files are in /etc (etc stands for editable text configuration). If you decide to restore the whole of /etc from your previous installation, you may want to backup the current one first, in case something in the old configuration files break something in the new install.\nIt is easier to re-install applications rather than restore them from backups. One way to keep track of which applications you have in which computer is by using Ubuntu One. \nAlternately you can save a list of installed application from the terminal and back it up. To do this, in a terminal type:\nsudo dpkg --get-selections > apps.txt \nTo restore the applications on the list:\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < apps.txt\nsudo dselect update\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade show\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Failing to set an /29 network address I'm trying to set up a server with a /29 network address (I've been given a subnet on my DSL connection).\nI set the router's LAN IP to the gateway for the range (call it xxx.xxx.xxx.176).\nI then proved the routing with a Windows box and pinging google - setting the IP address to xxx.xxx.xxx.177 and with a subnet of 255.255.255.248\nThen I tried to set my server up - I downed the network service and edited the interfaces file:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address xxx.xxx.xxx.178\n    netmask 255.255.255.248\n    gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.176\n\nBut when I restarted the network service, I got a message SCIOADDRT no such process\nI could ping the 177 computer, but not the gateway - and routing to external addresses was right out.\n\nA: With a /29 your gateway address is not valid\n248 = 11111 000\n176 = 10110 000\nSince it is a network address, not a valid host one.  \nEdit: Try router .177, winbox .178, linbox .179 and you should be fine.\n", "Q: How to disable Ubuntu Software Centre for user?

The information I've found is not precise.\nI would appreciate your advice/links on:\n\n*\n\n*Preparation of SSD.\n\n*Partitions on a 240Gb SSD: Boot/Ubuntu/Windows/data.\n*\n    \n*Size of partitions.\n    \n*Steps.\n\n\n*Installing Ubuntu 12.04.\n\n*Installing Windows 7.\n\n\nI intend to prepare a document with all the steps once the installation is completed.\nThanks!\n\nA: Ok, I'll take a shot at this...  Keep-in mind that there really is no one, true way to accomplish each of the steps you have indicated.  Especially with partitioning strategy, there are multiple schools of thought on how to do that efficiently.  What I have here is based-on my experiences (and failures).\nFor some specific points on Ubuntu filesystems on an SSD, you should see this question: Installing Ubuntu on a SSD\nThis is the order that I would go with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows (leave space for Ubuntu as \"unallocated\")\n\n*Adjust Windows partitions as-needed (OS, Data, etc...)\n\n*Install Ubuntu\n\n\nFor a partitioning strategy on a 240GB drive, it really depends on what you want to do with your system.  I've installed Ubuntu on as little as 20GB before, but I usually prefer to have 80GB if I can help it.  But I mainly use Ubuntu for internet, school and coding.  I don't really do a whole lot with video, photos or games in Linux.  If you do, you'll want to take that into consideration.  Without really knowing how you intend to use it, I would set-aside 50-80GB for Ubuntu.\nThe Ubuntu installer will recommend a partitioning strategy for you.  One mistake that (I feel) many new Linux users make, is that they put their \"home\" mount point on the same partition as root.  I feel it's a good idea to have your \"home\" directory on its own partition.  This way, your data is isolated if you should happen to (mess up and have to) reinstall Ubuntu at some point.  Again, the size of your \"home\" partition will vary on what you want to do with Ubuntu.\nAnother key Linux partition is your \"Swap Space\" partition.  There's an old rule of thumb that says you make this equal to twice the size of your RAM.  Here is an article explaining why that's not necessarily the case (any longer).  Opinions may vary, but for a typical desktop install, you shouldn't need to go much beyond 2GB.  You might need more if you're doing Linux kernel development or planning on using \"suspend to disk.\"  But if you are not a very experienced Ubuntu/Linux user, just accept the value suggested by the Ubuntu installer, and you should be ok.\nA Windows 7 install will take 20-30GB for the OS right away.  As updates come in, that will grow, too (mine does, at least).  So I would plan on a 50-60GB OS partition for windows.  Again, opinions differ here, but I would use the remaining disk space (~100GB or whatever you end-up with) as a data partition for Windows 7.  For me, this is where I install all of my games (Left4Dead2, KOTOR1 & 2, BF2142, etc...).  Again, having a separate data partition offers a level of protection against any issues that might befall your OS.\nAlso during the Windows install, make sure you leave the remaining 90GB (or whatever) of your disk as \"unallocated\" for Ubuntu.\nAs long as I'm talking about Windows 7, make sure that you do that installation first.  Windows isn't designed to \"play well with others\" by default.  If you install it after Ubuntu, you'll have to (do some Googling and) take some extra steps to make Ubuntu bootable again.  I always find that it's much easier to install Windows first, and then Ubuntu and GRUB (boot loader) second.  Typically, GRUB finds Windows and puts it into the boot menu for you.\nThe Ubuntu installer is fairly easy to use.  The only issues I've typically had at this point (with many Linux flavors), is that the installer fails to find certain kinds of hard drives.  In that case, you might need to provide an additional boot parameter of \"pci=nomsi\", etc.  Once it finds your hard drive, be sure to tell it to use the unallocated space after your Windows partition.  This is the point where it should suggest a partitioning strategy.\nOnce you get all of that selected and provide information for locale, you should be all set to go.  That should be enough to get you started.  Be sure to let us know how it goes.\n", "Q: tlmgr viaTeX Live Backports PPA I just installed TeX Live 2012, --on ubuntu 12.04-- via a this PPA, but cannot seem to figure out how to install tlmgr.

I would like to be able to set three custom keyboard shortcuts to be able to decrease, increase and mute the volume in Ubuntu 12.04 (Unity). On my old Ubuntu 10.04 (Gnome) system I made CTRL + [, CTRL + ] and CTRL + \\ my commands to achieve this. \nWhat is the simplest way to go about this?\n\nA: @dobey's solution works if you want to have only one keyboard shortcut for increasing / decreasing the volume.\nIf instead you want to have multiple key bindings controlling the volume (like to keep the default volume buttons on your laptop working, while adding additional keyboard shortcuts to use when you connect an external keyboard that does not have volume controls), then:\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Custom Shortcuts.\n\n\n*Click + to add a new keyboard shortcut. Set the \"Name\" to Volume up, \"Command\" to\namixer -D pulse sset Master 5%+ and click Apply.\n\n\n*Click Disabled next to your new key and choose the desired binding on your keyboard.\n\n\n*Add another shortcut with name Volume down and command\namixer -D pulse sset Master 5%-\n\n\nA: Usually, this command works just fine as a command for lowering the volume (Ubuntu 16.04):\namixer -q -D pulse sset Master 5%- \n\nOn Ubuntu 18.XX (Gnome) escape the % symbol:\namixer -q -D pulse sset Master 5%%-\n\nWorked for me!\n\nA: Open System Settings, go to Keyboard, then the Shortcuts tab, and finally choose Sound and Media in the list on the left. You can then choose the Volume related items in the list on the right side, and select which keybinding to use.\n(Reverse usage of left and right here, for RTL languages.)\n\nA: I had the same type of issue, I can confirm this syntax works:\namixer set Master 5%%-\namixer set Master 5%%+\n\nAlso be sure to not use - or + characters inside your custom shortcut name.\nI first used \"Volume -\" and \"Volume +\" which failed.

If I forget, and type ` e, I get an accented e character.\nI am only able to fix this temporarily, for the current session, by running:\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 49 = grave asciitilde'\n\nThe problem is, I can't figure out how to make this change permanent. I have found many related questions on Ask Ubuntu, but none that solve this specific problem.\nI am using KDE.\n\nA: In system preferences, keyboard layouts, there's three UK \"variants\":\nLayout          Variants\n------          --------\nEnglish (UK)    Default\nEnglish (UK)    English (UK, extended WinKeys)\nEnglish (UK)    English (UK, international with dead keys)\n\nMy keyboard has windows keys, so I'd selected the second variant during the install process, as seemed reasonable.\nIn fact, the difference between \"Default\" and the \"extended WinKeys\" variant seems to have nothing to do with the Windows keys at all.  The \"extended WinKeys\" variant actually makes many changes to the AltGr key behaviour, most of them for the better, for example, the AltGr-shifted apostrophe and circumflex keys add the acute and circumflex accent to the next letter that's pressed, rather than the random results that the \"Default\" variant gives.\nHowever, the \"extended Winkeys\" variant also corrects the AltGr-shifted backtick, and returns a broken-bar as is printed on the key rather the incorrect solid-bar provided by \"Default\".  That in turn means that the AltGr-backtick can't be used to add the grave accent to the next letter, as would be consistent with the \"extended Winkeys\" variant, so somebody evidently decided to just replace the backtick with that function.\nSince any UK Linux user would use the Compose-key functionality to write accented letters, nobody knows about the differences between these keyboard variants and it just catches people out.  In the various forums that mention the backtick-key giving this unexpected behaviour, everybody was mystified about why it happened.\nThis is the sort of thing that this bug causes. If I wanted to display the content of a shell script that somewhere on the path, I might type:\n$ cat `which zegrep`\n\nBut instead, I get:\n$ cat ẁhich zegrep\n\n...the backtick and \"w\" combine into w-with-grave\nThis is the mapping of the backtick key with the UK \"extended WinKeys\" layout:\n$ xmodmap -pke | grep \"keycode  49\"\nkeycode  49 = dead_grave notsign grave notsign brokenbar notsign bar bar\n\nAnd if you change the keyboard layout to UK \"Default\", the dead_grave key mapping gets shifted to the third position, which is the \"mode_shifted\" position (enabled by a Mode_shift key if you had one defined on your keyboard) which makes much more sense:\n$ xmodmap -pke | grep \"keycode  49\"\nkeycode  49 = grave notsign dead_grave notsign bar bar brokenbar notsign\n\nI'm thinking that I should report a bug, since evidently other people run into this, but I'm not sure what to recommend.  Maybe rename \"UK, extended WinKeys\" to \"UK, deadkeys via AltGr\", so that people generally wouldn't select it unless they knew what \"deadkeys\" were and specifically wanted that behaviour. Or shift the dead_grave function to the AltGr-shifted position on the backtick key, which would make it consistent with the other deadkeys.\nAnyway, just goto the keyboard layouts, add a new layout and select the UK Default keyboard. \n\nA: This is called a \"dead key\". Look for a variant of your keyboard layout that says something like \"eliminate dead keys\" or a variant which is not \"dead keys\". For the gb keyboard, the variant is called English (UK) I think. You can also set it with command line:\nsetxkbmap -layout gb -variant basic\n\nHowever, this will not be permanent. Fint the basic \nIf you do not find one like that, it is possible (and quite easy) to create your own layout. \n\nA: Thanks to @dave-farrance answer https://askubuntu.com/a/183368/54123.\nIf you otherwise like the 'extended WinKeys' layout (it was the only UK layout that allows me to type AltGr + a vowel to produce áéíóú)\nHere's a slightly advanced method to fix.  It should just change the grave key and nothing else.\nxmodmap -pke |grep ' = dead_grave' | sed 's| = dead_grave| = grave|g' > ~/.fix-grave\necho 'xmodmap '$HOME'/.fix-grave' | sudo tee -a /etc/rc.local\n\nThe changes to /etc/rc.local should get your modifications applied each timeyou login.\nTo test and apply them right away you'd execute xmodmap ~/.fix-grave\n", "Q: Brightness control works only in Ubuntu, doesn't in Xubuntu/Lubuntu/Kubuntu/Mint (Toshiba Satellite L30) All tested OS were in latest versions (12.04.1 and Mint 13 Mate&XFCE). \nAlready tried xfce panel aplet for screen brightness, acpi_backlight=vendor argument in GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and replacing xfce-power-manager with gnome-power-manager.\nDefault keyboard shortcut for brightness control should be Fn+F6/F7. \nShortcuts for mute, volume up, down and for disable/enable wifi are working properly.\nFor now, I'm able to control brightness only by terminal echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness.\nJust checked Debian Wheezy with Gnome 3 - also works, but I really want to install Xubuntu on this machine.\n\nA: I had this problem, i unchecked \"Power Manager\" from \"Application Autostart\" list in Settings -> Session and Startup and added another application with this command xfce4-power-manager --no-daemon then i have not have this problem yet.\n", "Q: Howto cleanly unmount a root filesystem that's using aufs Preface: I've made a boot-image that boots up Debian/Ubuntu using SquashFS and aufs.\nThe image contains a cleaned up debootstrap install, compressed into a squashfs image.\nThe squashfs image is considered the readonly part of my filesystem.\nThe local harddrive is considered the writable part of my root filesystem.\nAll setup of the rootfs is done from initramfs which calls switch_root to boot-up Debian/Ubuntu. The rootfs itself is mounted using aufs on the squash image (ro) and the harddrive (rw).\nWhen the initramfs is running, I check if the harddrive is cleanly unmounted. I make sure it's clean before I mount it by calling 'fsck -Cp' (I know, I shouldn't).\nThe Problem: The problem that I have, is that the writable part of my root filesystem is never unmounted properly, leaving it (eg, the hdd) in an unclean state.\nThe base of the problem is obviously that the hdd is in use by the aufs filesystem. The aufs filesystem is obviously in use by the rootfs. Next to that, I figure that the Debian/Ubuntu shutdown procedure must be modified to allow this.\nWhat have I done so far:\nI have tried to shutdown by hand, by first going into runlevel 1, and forcing ro-remounts of the rootfs and the hdd, but the hdd is still never unmounted cleanly.\nI also changed the way aufs is mounted by adding an option to create the xino file outside the harddrive mount. I never see the file being created, nor can I see any open files on the harddrive using lsof.\nLast but not least, I added the harddrive to the fstab of the Ubuntu install to have it recognize it. Didn't change a thing when Debian/Ubuntu shuts down though :(\nFrom the looks of it, I have created a \"chicken and egg\" problem, as I can't unmount the harddrive without first unmounting the root filesystem, which I need to unmount the harddrive lol.\nI haven't got the faintest idea of what commands to run, in order to unmount it properly, so any help is very much appreciated.\n\nA: You can never unmount root filesystem, sorry -- no matter if you're using squashfs+aufs, or just plain ext2/ext3/ext4...\nWhat you can do is remount it read-only, which is the same from data integrity standpoint. For regular filesystem:\nmount -oremount,ro /\nsync # initiate writing any pending writes to disk\nsleep 5 # and give writes some time to finish.\n\nnote that aufs is somewhat different as you should make sure the rw-backing of it still writeable while aufs itself is being put read-only... for example, assuming /mnt/sq/rw is ext4 read-write part of your aufs \"/\" mount:\n cat /proc/mounts > /etc/mtab # may not be needed if your mtab is symlink or otherwise reflects real situation\n fuser -mv / # show debug of what is using this disk and blocking unmount/ro-remount, if anything\n auplink / flush \n mount -oremount,noxino,noplink,ro /\n mount -oremount,sync /mnt/sq/rw\n mount -oremount,mod:/mnt/sq/rw=ro /\n mount -oremount,ro /mny/sq/rw\n sync\n sleep 5\n cat /proc/mounts\n dmesg\n sleep 300 # to give you time to read mounts/dmesg info\n halt -d -f\n\nin production you obviously won't need debug info... \nIn short, you flush to disk and disable aufs features that require writing to ext4 overlay, then force ext4 itself to sync and go read-only, so it will be marked as cleanly unmounted next time you boot.\n", "Q: Where can I find logs regarding the user creation?

In Xubuntu is still ok, but in KDE and Unity it is not. (The condition of my PC appears clearly in this answer).\nCompared to these DE-s, where stands Cinnamon? I am in the mood to try it but I thought maybe to ask first :)\n\nA: Cinnamon vs...\nI haven't found anyone who has done a direct Cinnamon vs anything else resource usage study.\nIts arguable that Phoronix has done the closest to this looking at the performance comparison between gnome-shell (Mutter) & unity (compiz) using both NVIDIA and ATI graphics. They have also looked at battery usage between Gnome, KDE, LXDE and XFCE.\nSince Cinnamon's Muffin is a fork of Mutter - you should perhaps assume the performance and resource usage will be similar or the same i.e. you could argue there is a direct read-across for the Gnome results to Cinnamon.\nMy reading of the results - and making the assumption that better performance is equivalent to less resource usage for the same work - is that gnome-shell and unity were equally resource hungry.  Thus expect Cinnamon and Unity to be similar.\nResults varied depending on the actual graphics card - when using NVIDIA drivers, these were equally resource hungry, whereas gnome-shell using ATI was more resource hungry than Unity.\nThus - you should expect Cinnamon to have the same resource profile as Gnome-Shell.\nThe study also revealed KWin trumped both Mutter and Compiz - LXDE and XFCE trumped these all.\nUsual caveats should apply when trying to interpret Phoronix results & methodologies - arguments should be directed to the Phoronix forums!\n\nA: I will post considering IDLE conditions in 64 bit system.\nStarting from system requirements , they actually Require the same as can be seen here for Ubuntu \n\nThe minimum memory requirement for Ubuntu 12.04 (32-bit) is 384 MB and\n  (64-bit) 512 MB of memory for Ubuntu\n\nAnd for Cinnamon \n\nx86 processor (Linux Mint 64-bit requires a 64-bit processor.

Well its only Traditional Desktop compared to Unity's Concept. \nMy Usage derived result says, there is exceptionally No Performance difference between them apart from Different Desktop Experience depending on Compiz and Cinnamon. \nYou should definitely give it a try to judge it personally.\n\nA: No, using Cinnamon should not slow down your computer in any way. So feel free to use Unity or Cinnamon or GNOME.\n\nA: In theory, nothing should slow down. The performance should be somewhere along the lines of unity's performance, perhaps even a little better.\nIn practice, on the other hand, the remains of Unity and thus remaining GTK/GNOME-based software might cause a drop in performance, compared to a bare cinnamon install/Mint.\nThat said, there is no real benchmark for performance of DEs, so ... we can't really give actual stats - and your best bet is to just try it out.

If you are on Precise, it is unlikely that the bug fix will be backported to the Web-apps Preview PPA.\nIf you are desperate or feeling adventurous, you can download the deb file of signon-ui that is available in Quantal currently and install it manually.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install a .deb file via the command line?\nThough I must warn you I haven't tested whether the deb file actually fixes your problem. And it is very likely that it might cause other unforeseen problems, including but not limiting to breaking dependencies of other packages, not actually being functional, etc.\nA relatively safer and a promising solution to fix your problem would be to upgrade to Quantal, but upgrading to a pre-release version is never a sane idea, giving the amount of development going on at the moment.\nTo wrap up, the bug you are facing is fixed. Either wait for Quantal to be released and upgrade your system or try out the deb file available in Quantal.\n", "Q: How to get the default Ubuntu graphic  driver for 12.04?

Up to today I've been trying to solve this problem by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using another driver and graphic card.  \n\n*Using newest kernel and Xorg from Quantal backports. \n\n*Resetting Compiz settings and whole profile. \n\n*Changing Alt+Tab button bindings (I've readed that can be related).\n\n\nWhat can I do more to resolve this issue?\n\nA: I had these and other problems in compiz. You can find a bug report here. In short, the solution to that particular bug was to install an alternative, older version of the packages:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:vanvugt/compiz-preproposed\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install compiz=1:0.9.7.8-0ubuntu1vvpreproposed2 compiz-core=1:0.9.7.8-0ubuntu1vvpreproposed2 compiz-gnome=1:0.9.7.8-0ubuntu1vvpreproposed2 compiz-plugins=1:0.9.7.8-0ubuntu1vvpreproposed2 compiz-plugins=1:0.9.7.8-0ubuntu1vvpreproposed2 compiz-plugins-default=1:0.9.7.8-0ubuntu1vvpreproposed2 libdecoration0=1:0.9.7.8-0ubuntu1vvpreproposed2\n\nRestart compiz:\ncompiz --replace &\n\nIf that does not work better for you, the packages will be replaced during the next system update. Or just do\napt-get update\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf, however, you have better experience with that older package (that was my case), you can make the change more permanent (\"pin\" the package at a certain version). For this, install synaptic:\napt-get install synaptic\n\nSynaptic is an alternate package manager that also allows to pin the packages.\nAlternatively, you can run:\n{ echo compiz hold ; echo compiz-core hold ; echo compiz-plugins hold ; echo compiz-gnome hold ; echo compiz-plugins-default hold ; echo libdecoration0 hold ; } | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\n", "Q: How to increment a value appended to another value in a shell script I have a shell script that executes a backup program and saves the output in a folder.

So I know that under 'system settings'>'keyboard'>'shortcuts' I can create a custom key combo but I do not know that the command is of the sleep setting. So, please help.\nThank you\n\nA: All of the following commands require root permissions.  The most common way to do this is prefix the command with sudo.\nThe command for Suspend (Sleep) is pm-suspend (sudo pm-suspend etc.)\nThe command for Hibernate is pm-hibernate (Note that Hibernation mode is not compatible with all hardware, please test this before using it.)\nThe command for the hibrid of them both is pm-suspend-hybrid\nThe hybrid command saves the session to the Hard Disk (safer storage place), but the system will stay running, allowing for faster resume.  This does not mean you can turn off your computer and have your session saved.  You will need to use the regular hibernate command for that.\nThese commands are provided by the package pm-utils, installed by default in Ubuntu 12.04LTS\nSource: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/pm-action.8.html\n\nIf you have problems with those commands, please see the source.  It states that\n\nOn some hardware putting the video card in the suspend state and\n         recovering from it needs some special quirk handling. With the\n         --quirk-* options of the pm-suspend and pm-suspend-hybrid commands you\n         can select which quirks should be used.\n\nA list of these quirks, and what they mean can be found here\n\nA: As an FYI, you can get the hibernation option back in the system menu by making the following changes (you should test the hibernate function from a terminal before doing this to ensure that it works properly):\n gksu gedit /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla\n\nThe previous command will open a new text file. Copy and paste the following into this new file:\n[Enable Hibernate]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\nResultActive=yes\n\nSave and close the file.\nLog out and log back in, and Hibernate should appear as an option in the system menu.\n", "Q: Multiple computers on Ubuntu One I have added files from 4 computers to Ubuntu One.  One computer failed.  What happens to the files that I uploaded?  Are they still on Ubuntu One?  How come when I upload a file from computer A, computer B with the same Ubuntu One account does not sync and load that file into computer B - that has created this question. What happens to files from computers from which I uploaded documents when those computers are no longer active or failed, or no longer have Ubuntu One on that computer from which the files were uploaded? Have I lost the files?  \nThe follow-up question is how come files from Computer A uploaded to Ubuntu One don't sync to Computer B?  That is a related question.  I need to shutdown a computer, reformat the hard drive and install Linux on the entire hard drive instead of a dual boot with Windows XP, as I am going to use Virtual Machines instead.\nWhat happens to the files from the Windows Dual Boot that were uploaded to Ubuntu One?  Are they removed from Ubuntu One and then have I lost those files if I don't backup to another service first.\n\nA: Ubuntu One is a sync service, not a bckup service. When you add files from 4 coumputers to Ubuntu One: \n\n\n*\n\n*Do you use the same user-id (lets call the user-id \"LRBellmore\") and password to configure the Ubuntu One app in all the computers? I am talking about Ubuntu One user-id.\n\n*Do you copy the files in the \"Ubuntu One\" folder in your home folder,\nor upload the files using the web interface?\n\n\nIf the answer to Question 1 is yes, it may take sometime, but files from computer A will show up in computer B, C, and D if: \n1) the same user remains logged in, on the other computers (B, C, and D)\n2) Internet is working, and\n3) Ubuntu One is running in them.\nAs for what happens if a computer fails, depends on how the computer fails. \nIf the user \"LRBellmore\" is logged into the computer A and Ubuntu One app is running (as it should) and some malware (or a toddler) deletes files from a synced folder like \"Ubuntu One\" folder. The app will send this information to the server and the corresponding file will be deleted from the server. When \"LRBellmore\" logs on to computer B, and connects to the Internet, the file will be deleted from computer B.\nIf the computer A has a second user (Lets call him \"EvilTwin\"), and EvilTwin logs into EvilTwin's account and somehow manages to delete files from a synced folder like \"Ubuntu One\" folder of \"LRBellmore,\" then the files will not be deleted from the Ubuntu One server at that time, as \"LRBellmore\" was not logged in at that time and the Ubuntu One was not running with \"LRBellmore\" credential. However, when \"LRBellmore\" logs into the computer and connects to the Internet, The Ubuntu One app will notice that files are gone and will sync those changes to the server, and eventually to the other computers.\nIf the computer was turned off and falls in a swimming pool, then the user \"LRBellmore\" was not logged in and the Ubuntu One app was not running. So no information was sent to the server. So no file in the server will be deleted. When the user \"LRBellmore\" logs on to the computer B, the file will continue to exist there as well.\nIf the computer was booted from a Live CD and reformatted, the user \"LRBellmore\" was not logged in and the Ubuntu One app was not running. So the file will remain in the server and in computer B, C and D.\nThe same principle holds for dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu, on the same computer. Once the files are synced to the server from the Windows boot, you have to boot Ubuntu and log-in to your account so that the files can sync between the server and the Ubuntu's local \"Ubuntu One\" folder. If you delete the Windows partition while booted from LiveCD or Ubuntu in the other partition of your hard drive, Ubuntu One will not be able to sync with the Windows part of the computer and no files will be deleted.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: \"Unable to connect\" error with apt-get: possible proxy?

VNC/RDP/? I have a Windows 7 laptop that's going out and about and I'd like to be able to admin' it from my Ubuntu (precise) desktop.\nWhile the laptop is in my office I can use Gnome's \"Remote Desktop Viewer\" (Vinagre) to connect via RDP. However, when it's in the office I don't really need RDP of course! And when it's out of the office I cannot control the routers/firewalls along the way, so I won't know the IP and cannot set up port forwards.\nI'm looking for a Ubuntu compatible way to achieve this.\nNb. I can set up port forwards at the my office end, so a service on the laptop could try a \"backwards\" connection to my client.\n\nA: You can install a VPN server on your office machine and have the laptop to connect as a client suggestion: openvpn or you can use teamviewer under wine on your ubuntu machine. For frequent remote connections, I would prefer the VPN solution. It is also more powerful as with the VPN, your laptop will behave as if it was connected in your LAN (use internal resources easily as shared directories, internal webpages, printers, central authentication possibly, etc...) and not only share its desktop as with teamviewer.\nUpdate:\nopenvpn will show the log of the last connection with cat /etc/openvpn/openvpn-status.log\nTo fix the ip assigned to the client, you can use in server config file:\nifconfig-pool-persist ipp.txt 0\nipp.txt is used with ifconfig-pool-persist (without 0) to persist the ip when reconnecting after connection is down. Using 0 the server will never update the file so the IP will always be the same.\nIn ipp.txt you enter host,ip pairs like:\nmylaptop,192.168.2.6\nto assign 192.168.2.6 to host mylaptop.\nObs: Don't forget to change ipp.txt file if you change the ip pool assignment for the clients.\n", "Q: How to reverse colors for the current window in gnome shell? I dislike that most websites use a black font on white background for their sites, as it gets too tiresome for me to read.\nBack in the days of 11.04, using Gnome2 with compiz, there actually was a Negative feature that could negate the content of any window, making the background black and the font white. Much easier on the eyes for me.\nYet since 11.10, using gnome shell with mutter, I have no idea if there is something alike out there.\nHence my question: How do I negate the currently active window in gnome shell? \nI am not interested in alternative methods, e.g. user styles. I am aware of their existence but I find it much easier to just invert the screen by the hit of a key shortcut. I also want the solution to be application-agnostic. As I also from time to time would want to invert libre-office or some other glaringly white application.\n\nA: Partial solution\nPerhaps, you can use a high / inverse contrast that sort of negates the windows. While this does not work for a browser's web pages (you could use browser specific solutions for that), it generally works for desktop applications. \nGo to Universal Access and choose High / Inverse for Contrast. You could know have a white text in black background. While I admit this isn't the best solution, it should help you somewhat if you are desperate.  \n\n\nMaking the windows or the screen negative is, unfortunately, a Compiz feature. If I am not wrong, gnome-shell uses Mutter as its window manager and Mutter currently doesn't have any feature that allows the users to negative the windows.\nThe reason why you were able to make your windows negative in 11.04 or earlier versions were because you were using GNOME classic, which apparently used either Metacity or Compiz as its window manager.\nIf you really want to make your windows negative, I strongly urge you to use Unity, as it uses Compiz and can easily be configured to make your current window negative. \nOr, you can also use gnome-classic in 11.10 and enable Compiz in gnome-classic.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I enable compiz in Gnome Classic?\n\nA: Unless you are willing to write a Gnome-Shell extension, this is not possible.\nIt also depends on whether Clutter is able to support this feature.\nYou can read about writing Gnome-Shell extensions here:\nhttps://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Extensions\n\nA: To invert the entire screen you can use the program xcalib:\nxcalib -invert -alter\n\nFrom the xcalib man page\n\nxcalib  loads  'vcgt'-tag  of  ICC  profiles  to the X-server using the\n         XVidMode Extension in order to calibrate your display.\n\nThat means it does not depend on compiz being used.\nYou can install it using sudo apt-get install xcalib. To make it more convenient assign a keyboard shortcut opening the Keyboard settings.\n\nThere, navigate to shortcuts. Add a custom shortcut by pressing the plus button, add the name and the command. It will be disabled by default, so assign a shortcut by clicking on Disabled and perform the wanted shortcut, e.g. meta + i\nBefore:\n\nAfter xcalib -invert -alter was launched (mapped to <meta-i>:\n\nPressing it again restores to the normal not inverted screen.\n\nA: This is a beautiful question which I asked myself multiple times since gnome2. \nHere is a gnome extension which allows shading of inactive windows. The trick is to activate another window while reading in the shaded one. https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/650/shade-inactive-windows/ \nBtw: redshift is also a great tool for keeping your eyes calm.\nEdit: Now I have created my own first extension. It shades the whole desktop with a panel button click. By scrolling over the button, the brightness can be customized. It is called \"Dim Desktop 70\" and is available under https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1130/dim-desktop-70/\n\nA: This wonderful Gnome Shell extension do the job:\nhttps://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1041/invert-window-color/\nand once installed you only use Super+i to invert 100% colors on the window currently focused!\n", "Q: How to connect to \"alt.os.linux.ubuntu\" newsgroup I want to access the alt.os.linux.ubuntu newsgroup and read the threads. I appreciate if someone could tell me how to add this newsgroup. I downloaded PAN, but they are asking for server names for connecting. \nI am using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: You've got a newsreader, but now you need a newsgroup server.  In the \"old\" days, lots of ISPs included access to newsgroup servers for free, but those days appear to be over.  You'll need to buy access to such a server, unfotunately.  I can't tell you which is best, but this link (newsgroups) will explain how it works and give you links to lots of servers.\nMost are not very expensive, but there are different levels of service for different rates so you'll have to evaluate your needs and decide what you need.\nIt's much like getting a web browser for free, but you still have to pay for Internet access.  The browser doesn't really give you access to the web, just the ability to \"read\" the web once you've obtained access.\n\nA: I think alt.os.linux.ubuntu \n is no more available.

This ZFS guide claims:\n\nThe Ubuntu desktop installer may add dev, proc, sys, or tmp lines to the /etc/fstab file, but such entries are not strictly necessary for a modern system. Add them now if you want them.\n\nHow true is this? My Ubuntu 12.04 installation contains an explicit /proc mount. If it's unnecessary, why does Ubuntu include it?\n\nA: The claimed statement is generally true:\n\nIt is not necessary to list /proc and /sys in the fstab unless some special options are needed. The boot system will always mount them. (Debian Wiki)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The only reason Debian (and by extension, Ubuntu) includes it is as a forgotten remnant of the bad old days when it used to be necessary.\n\n*This behavior is a bug in the installer package partman-target and was recently fixed in Debian Testing (wheezy) on June 15, 2012. \n\n*So, you can expect Ubuntu to \"fix\" this in 12.10...\n\n", "Q: Opening up a CMYK PSD file in GImp (2.8) I am running Gimp 2.8 and tried to open up a CMYK psd file and got this error:\n\nOpening 'homepage.psd' failed: Procedure 'file-psd-load' returned no return values\n\nAm I missing a plugin?

Ubuntu's great. It's very fast and easy to use. The only problem I'm having at the moment is running Minecraft. See, Minecraft runs at a smooth 60-70 FPS, fast graphics + tiny render distance on Windows, but on Ubuntu, the FPS is capped at 30. The only mod I have installed at the moment is the Optifine mod, which boots the performance of Minecraft substantially. In the video options, I have the performance option set to \"Max FPS\" which is supposed to uncap the FPS. I'm really stumped here.\nHere's my system specs, because I'm sure they'll help:\nThese specs are completely stock, by the way.\nModel: ASUS Essentio CM5571-BR003\nCPU: Intel Pentium dual core @ 2.70 GHz x2\nGPU: Intel G43/G45 Express chipset\nRAM: 6GB DDR3\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks!\n\nA: Do you get more fps in windows? If so, it is weird, because you seem to be using a integrated graphics chipset, which are not known to be that great in gaming (except for maybe the Sandy Bridge and later gpu chipsets, but even those are not suitable for anything but very casual gaming). It surprises me that the game is even playable, to be honest.\n\nA: Minecraft has an FPS limit built-in. Try setting it to Unlimited.\n\nIgnore the fact that I am using Windows.

My system is Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit + Unity and it uses ~480Mb with no other processes-apps open, just the core system. Is this the expected amount?

Please look there, select the partition and click on 'Mount Partiton'. Then should pop up a new window. If not, look at '/media' :)\n\nA: I recommend installing the program < pysdm >. It's in the repository. This program allows you to control any hard drive which is on your machine.

This computer has two SSDs. One, the \"main\" one, on which the operating system is installed, is 8 GB; the other, which I use for storage, etc., is 32 GB.\nUsing pysdm has solved the problem of having two hard drives and using them both together.\nGive it a try. You'll have to study it a bit to learn how to use it but, once learned, it is easy. I suggest that you have your second drive start in /boot; that how I have mine configured.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: I would like to replicate my Ubuntu 12.04 SSD install onto an identical SSD How do I replicate a SSD drive and copy the MBR so that that replicated SSD is identical?\n\nA: I've had success cloning system installed on USB sticks using dd command.\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb\n\nWhere I'm assuming /dev/sda is your source and /dev/sdb is your destination.  It's important not to mess these up or you're overwriting your good disk with 0s.\nYou'll probably want to run dd from a bootable utility disk.  Don't dd a live system, because you may get a corrupt filesystem on the destination disk.\nYou can identify disks attached using fdisk -l.  But this won't tell you which one's source and destination.  You'll have to mount them and see which one contains your system files and then proceed to dd it.\nAlso, when you're cloning whole device, it will likely work when both your device is by same manufacturer and same type.  Even though disks say they're 16 GB, some are a few bytes longer, some are shorter.  fdisk -l will report size and make sure these are the same.  If your source is larger than destination you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*gparted to resize source partition\n\n*gparted to create partition on destination drive of the same size\n\n*dd /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 to copy partitions\n\n*grub to make /dev/sdb bootable.  You'll have to search how to install grub.\n\n\nA: Using dd will certainly work, but it's not ideal for SSDs because it will cause all sorts of problems with TRIM and garbage collection, as it will be writing to the entire SSD. A better option is to use something that only copies used parts of the drive -- I think partimage and similar type utilties can do this.\n\nA: I've always found that clonezilla, which uses dd is the easiest way to accomplish your task. It is a modified Debian distribution.\n", "Q: All printouts condensed into left half on a Samsung Color Laser printer CLP-365W After installing the Samsung Color Laser Printer CLP-365W in 12.04, the printout is condensed into the left half of the A4 page (regardless whether 'fit to page' on or off).

The original question\n\nOne of the strength of Unity are the various standardized indicators. I want to customize  the sound indicator with an additional menu entry that runs a small shell script. I'm not afraid of a little Python code and I hope someone can point me to the right subroutine in the right file.

I know it is possible as the marvelous Skype-Wrapper does it.\n\nEdit 2 - Now a dirty DBus hack\nThe one click problem from one edit before has now turned into a DBus problem.

A dirty hack navigates around that problem:\n#!/bin/bash\n# This is '/home/confus/bin/toggleSpeaker.sh'\n\nnotify-send \"Toggle Speaker\" \"$(date)\"\nqdbus \\\n    com.canonical.indicator.sound  \\\n    /org/ayatana/indicator/service \\\n    org.ayatana.indicator.service.Shutdown\nexit 0\n\nHelp from the community is appreciated as I don't have experience any with DBus whatsoever.\n\nEdit 1 - Takkat found a solution but only clickable once?\nFor some reason the solution proposed by Takkat has the drawback that the resulting entry in indicator sound can only be clicked once per session. If someone has a fix for, than please comment or answer, you will be upvoted. Here you can see the result:\n\nI strongly suspect the issue is related to the .desktop-file in /home/confus/.local/share/application/toggleSpeaker.desktop, which is this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\n\nName=toggleSpeaker\nGenericName=Toggle Speaker\n\nIcon=gstreamer-properties\n\nExec=/home/confus/bin/toggleSpeaker.sh\nTerminal=false\n\nAnd here is a minimal example of the script in /home/confus/bin/toggleSpeaker.sh for your consideration:\n#!/bin/bash\n# This is '/home/confus/bin/toggleSpeaker.sh'\n\nnotify-send \"Toggle Speaker\" \"$(date)\"\nexit 0\n\n\nA: By running dconf-editor from the dconf-tools  we may incorporate an MPRIS complatible media player application to the sound menu with the key \"com.canonical.indicator.sound.interested-media-players\".\n\nIn the example here test was included which points to a test.desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications where we can run our appplication from the Exec= field. Restart your session to take effect.\n\nAs an entry in this menu is closely related to a media player, application control is done by DBus session bus com.canonical.indicator.sound.

I'm trying to read The Art of Assembly Language as per this answer on Stack Overflow. When I open it on my Ubuntu 12.04 box, it looks like this:\n\nI haven't tested it on another machine, but this can't be intentional. What is going on, and how can I fix it?\nEdit: The above screenshot is from Chrome. It look like this in Evince:\n\nStill squished and hardly readable, but better. Is there anything I can do to fix it?\n\nA: The document specifies a bunch of fonts (for instance, Garamond which is the main font used in the document) but doesn't have them embedded. So your system renders it with what it considers the closest font it has. I'd consider this a malformed PDF; if you're using a font that's not widely available and don't embed it, users will have a hard time reading it.\nYou can install Garamond from here: http://www.fontage.com/pages/garamond.html\nDownload the garamond.zip file, uncompress it, and open each of the .ttf files that appear. They will open in Font Viewer. Click the \"install\" button to install them to your system. They will be installed for your user only, under .fonts. Once they're installed, open the document with evince which should pick up the new fonts and show the document as it was meant to be seen.\nTo know which fonts a document uses, open it in evince, go to File -> Properties, then to the Fonts tab. Any fonts that say \"Not Embedded\" are, well, not embedded, and in order for the document to render 100% accurately you'd need to have all these fonts installed on your system.\n", "Q: emacs keybindings in ubuntu 12.04 I am trying to get Emacs-like Keybindings in GTK, Firefox, Chrome, etc.  I have followed the directions recommended here (and in lots of places) but to no effect.\nIn other words, I added gtk-key-theme-name = \"Emacs\" to my .gtkrc-2.0, and I also ran gconf-editor and set /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_key_theme to \"Emacs\".

Windows 7 was unable to boot so I reinstalled windows on a completely different partition and The original windows 7 partition isn't recognized.\nSo I'm back in ubuntu and using disc utility I can see the partition in question and I'm wondering how I can convert it back to nfts with out loosing any of my data from that partition (originally containing windows 7)\nI noticed an edit partition option but I can not find an literature on what that does specifically in the department of file preservation. \n\nA: You data may still be physically on the disk, but only if Ubuntu haven't actually used the partition as a swap area (if you did not turn the swapping off yet, you need to do this right now although it may already be too late). \nWhen creating a swap area, mkswap command does not actually format or erase the partition, however, it does erase the first block of the partition to make any previous filesystem invisible, and then it writes a swap header (see man mkswap) - which, in total, overrides the first 4096 bytes of the partition. \nA useful question: https://superuser.com/questions/172724/what-file-system-is-swap-on-linux\nMy reading suggests that NTFS header is 16 sectors (8192 bytes) long, so you've only zapped a half of it. Moreover, \n\nWhen you format an NTFS volume, the format program allocates the first\n  16 sectors for the $Boot metadata file. First sector, in fact, is a\n  boot sector with a \"bootstrap\" code and the following 15 sectors are\n  the boot sector's IPL (initial program loader). To increase file\n  system reliability the very last sector an NTFS partition contains a\n  spare copy of the boot sector.\n\nSo, basically, you need to somehow copy the last sector of the partition into the very first sector and that should allow OS to see the partition. It won't be bootable, but the data should be accessible.\nGoogling for \"NTFS restore boot sector\" finds a program called TestDisk which claims to be able to do what you need. \nThere's also software called Photorec which can recover files from a damaged partition by scanning the partition and looking for file signatures. It can recover data even from a partition which cannot be accessed by the OS.\n", "Q: Content that uses Flash begins to play in fast forward after 30 mins (or so) Example: Youtube videos play in fast forward.\nUbuntu 12.04 (x64)\n\nA: I've seen this happen because of problems with Pulseaudio.\nCheck your log files for more info.\nTry  restarting the pulseaudio process or killing it with the\nkillall pulseaudio\n\ncommand.\nPulseaudio will restart itself if killed.\n\nA: Go to System settings --> Sound --> Choose internal speakers, this will fix the super fast forward problem AND the sound issue...\n", "Q: overheating and shutdown problems when adobe flash runs?

It's a temporary help but at least in avoids having the computer shutdown or worse a fire.\n\nA: Not so much as a solution, more of a workaround, but I'll post this here as I don't have the permissions to comment on a question. I hope you don't mind.\nAnyway, install 'Adblock plus' to your browser using whichever extension website is available for your browser.\nThen set to disable all of the embedded flash applets that are displayed on the website.\nIf you are against doing this due to not wanting to harm the owner by disabling adverts, just remember that it's those ads that are harming you and your web browsing experience.

The installation process\nwent through the \"Welcome\" and \"Preparing to install Ubuntu\" windows\nwithout any obvious problems, but then the \"Installation type\" window did\nnot show any partitions, and I was stuck, with no obvious indication of\nwhat was wrong or what to try next.  I was trying to install Ubuntu 12.04\nfrom a CD-ROM disk rather than a USB Flash drive, but I don't think that\nmatters.\nAfter doing some reading online and from a few technical reference books,\nI came to the conclusion that setting up a dual boot configuation with\nWindows 7 and Linux on the computer's internal hard drive is practically\nimpossible.  Apparently Windows 7 uses \"dynamic disks\", and this dynamic\ndisks technology does not allow Linux to co-exist with Windows 7.  Here's\nan online article that provides some info on this topic, and supports the\nclaim that Linux is incompatible with dynamic disks:\n  https://superuser.com/questions/89304/ubuntu-9-10windows-7-dual-boot-dynamic-disks\n  \"Ubuntu 9.10+Windows 7 dual boot, dynamic disks\"\nThis was frustrating, because I would have liked to have Windows 7 and\nUbuntu together on my computer's internal hard drive.  However, I found\na solution that works reasonably well.  I bought a Seagate external disk\ndrive, plugged it in to one of my computer's USB 3.0 ports, used the\nWindows 7 disk management utility to create a few new partitions on that\nSeagate external drive, and then successfully installed Ubuntu 12.04 (from\na CD-ROM disk) on the external drive.  Now, if I want to boot Ubuntu\ninstead of Windows 7, I plug in my external drive, turn on the computer,\npress the F12 key for boot options, and then tell the boot manager to boot\nfrom the external USB device rather than the internal hard drive.  This\nseems to work well enough.  USB 3.0 provides such high data transfer rates\nthat I haven't noticed any serious performance problems.\nOne noteworthy advantage of installing Ubuntu on an external drive instead\nof your computer's internal hard drive is that this provides you with more\nportability.  The Seagate external drive is conveniently small and light.\nIt does not require a separate power cable; it gets its power via the USB\nconnection, and thus requires only one cable - for the USB 3.0 connection.\nI can easily carry around the drive and its accompanying USB cable in a\nsmall case, plug it in to a computer anywhere else, and then boot up my\nown personal Ubuntu system using the CPU, main memory and I/O resources\nof whatever PC system I happen to be near (e.g., my PC at the office, or\nat a friend's house, or wherever).\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu on a new computer?

Or, is this a job for juju instead?\n\nA: Per an answer to my original (since edited) question by bigjools, I'm posting his answer here as well. See below... thanks bigjools!\n\nIs it possible to specify an image or list of packages to install on a per-node basis in MAAS? Or, is this a job for juju instead?\n\nThat's a job for Juju.\n\nA: Another question - Is it possible to have juju use a MAAS server as the master node? -  was marked as an exact duplicate of this, but it is not. I cannot undo that change, so I will answer here for now:\nRight now, Juju randomly chooses a node from the pool of machines that MAAS manages. In 12.10 we plan to honour hardware constraints given when a machine is requested from MAAS. Juju should be able to take advantage of that, to target the bootstrap node (referred to as \"master node\" in the question) to a particular machine.\nHowever, afaik, there aren't any plans to allow users to put the bootstrap node on the machine running MAAS.\n", "Q: Can you limit which MAAS nodes can be used as part of a juju environment?

You only have to be concerned with disparity between the version of Ubuntu used to create and the version being installed.

I've looked at several guides such as \"How to enable hibernation in 12.04?\" and \"Dell XPS 15 L502X & Ubuntu 12.04 Linux\", which says to first try running sudo pm-hibernate to see if it works before adding the Hibernate option to the system menu.\nWhen running that command the screen switches to black, I see a little text cursor blink in the top left of the screen for a few seconds, then the system shuts off (as expected). When I power it up again, however, it starts up from scratch rather than resuming the suspended state. I have 7.7GB of RAM and 7.9GB of swap space, as was automatically set up during the Ubuntu installation.\nLooking at the main Ubuntu wiki page for this hardware, it says \"To hibernate, on Ubuntu 12.04, laptop should be certified, but it is working fine with this type of laptop, so if you like to activate hibernate function, you have just to create this file...\", so because it works for others on this laptop I must be doing something wrong.\nI followed the steps in that guide to put acpi=noirq into the default Grub options in order to fix booting problems.

I accidentally deleted it.\nI ran sudo rm -Rf lib inside /usr/local/.\nI am using 12.04.\n\nA: The standard use of /usr/local/lib is to store library files installed from software built from source. It is standard to store the source code in /usr/local/src.\nAssuming this is the way the folder was used, you can simply reinstall the software that provided the library files.\nMost of the time, software is built something like this:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThose commands are run from inside the particular program's source directory, which is typically a subdirectory of /usr/local/src.\nSo, just go back there (for each program or library installed, as even applications may provide files stored in /usr/local/lib) and run sudo make install again.\nIf you had run make clean or make distclean inside the source directory after installing (which is generally inadvisable, even though many bloggers recommend it, because it saves a bit of space but at the cost of making it difficult to reinstall or uninstall), you'll have to build from source again.\nIf you didn't keep the source code at all, you'll have to redownload it, unpack it, and install it, as you had done before.\nEven in the worst case scenario where you are not sure what programs you had installed from source, it's still usually much easier to figure that out than to use generic file recovery methods. Such methods are usually difficult and time consuming and only give you back part of what you had hoped to recover; the libraries in /usr/local/lib, and whatever programs depend on them, would likely not run correctly.\n", "Q: How to get conky to stay on the desktop I have a conky setup that I've used on a number of desktops (here's the conkyrc). It works fine in Ubuntu Unity, XFCE, Gnome and Openbox, but not Lubuntu (LXDE). The problem is that I cannot get it to stay on the Lubuntu LXDE desktop reliably. Either the conky window disappears if I click the desktop or if I minimize all windows (show desktop).\nI've tried all variations in the configuration file for \"own_window\", \"own_window_colour\",  \"own_window_transparent\" and \"own_window_type\" and have Googled quite a bit to resolve this. If it edit the conkyrc file and set the own_window_type to \"normal\", conky disappears if I minimize all windows. If I set it to \"desktop\" it disappears if I click anywhere on the desktop. If I use \"override\" it doesn't display at all. And the other options don't work well for obvious reasons.\nOn another Ubuntu Unity install I had a similar problem, but got around it by using Compiz Config Settings Manager to ignore my conky window. On my netbook Lubuntu install I don't have compiz installed.\nHow can I get conky to stay on my desktop.\n\nA: This config works, on Gnome and Cinnamon and is the way to do it.\nown_window yes\nown_window_transparent yes\nown_window_type dock\nown_window_hints undecorated,below,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager\nown_window_argb_visual yes\nown_window_argb_value 100\ngap_x 940\ngap_y 20\n\nThe last 2 attributes absolutely position it on screen and need to be changed for your configuration.\nA working complete configuration file can be found here on Github.\nEdit:\nFrom the comments: If own_window_type set to \"dock\" doesn't work well for you, try \"override\" and \"normal\" as well.\n\nA: The above did not work for me. What did work was to set the \"own_window_type\" to \"normal\" in /etc/conky/conky.conf.\nown_window_type normal\n\nAs per this thread:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2039399\n\nA: Seems like setting window type to desktop is not enough sometimes.\nTry:\nown_window_type desktop\nown_window_hints undecorated,below,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager\n\nGot it from here.\nWorks for me in XFCE. I'm guessing it'll be fine for lxde/openbox as well.\n\nA: The problem with using conky with LXDE is that PCManFM handles the desktop in a way unlike any other desktop. LXDE is essentially Openbox with a desktop layered on by the file manager (pcmanfm) if you removed pcmanfm in favor of another file manager, you would no longer have LXDE, you'd essentially have Openbox with the LXDE panel. How is this relevant? Well, LXDE's desktop is handled more like a window by the window manager, meaning just like when you have several windows open, and you click on one of them, it brings it into focus. This is exactly what's happening with Conky. When you click on the desktop, it places conky beneith the desktop, which is as I explained, handled more like a window. In my case, this is the fix: \nown_window_class Conky\nown_window yes\nown_window_type normal\nown_window_transparent yes\nown_window_hints undecorate,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager,below\n\nNow, if you use the panel plugin to minimize all windows, it will still minimize conky, but this fix keeps conky from disappearing under normal circumstances.\n\nA: I've done tons of research on this myself and it seems there are very few workarounds and even fewer that work well: \n\n\n*\n\n*You could set conky to a dock or panel window. \n\n*You can set it to a normal window and just avoid using the show desktop plugin/keybind. \n\n*I even tried using the -w argument for conky to get it to draw to the fake desktop/PCManFM window, but that will cause your desktop to redraw as often as conky updates = messy. \n\n*If you can live without desktop icons, you can set conky to a desktop window and then simply turn PCManFM off by typing pcmanfm --desktop-off at the terminal.\n\n*You could let feh or some other program manage the desktop \n\n\nI didn't like any of the above options. So, like Redsandro, the workaround I settled on was to have conky as a normal window (skip_pager,skip_taskbar,below,undecorated of course) and write a simple bash script and make a .desktop file for it so I could include in my panel to take the place of the Show Desktop plugin. It uses wmctrl so you'd have to download it. Also it unfortunately doesn't minimize all windows, it only shades them. But for my needs, it suffices:\n#!/bin/bash\nvar=($(wmctrl -l | grep -o \"0x[[:alnum:]]\\+\"))\nfor v in ${var[@]}\ndo wmctrl -i -r $v -b toggle,shaded\ndone\nexit 0\n\n\nA: The accepted answer does not account for \"Show Desktop\".\nYou can use the hack I explained in this answer to show conky after Win+D for Show Desktop is pressed:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nzenity --info --text \"Remapping Conky...\" &\npid=$!\nsleep 0.3\nkill $pid\nxdotool windowmap `xdotool search --classname 'conky'`\n\n\nA: EDIT:\nbetter: as of 12.04 Precise and all later versions of Ubuntu (confirmed till 16.04 xenial), you can achieve the same as devilspie (below) with compiz -> Windows Rules. I used the class match there, its self-explanatory. Works with my linked Super+Home-script, too.\nHere is my little contribution after wasting a couple of hours with this for anyone who couldn't sort it out with all the above (tested with Ubuntu 16.04):\nQuick Solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a 'own_window_type dock' line in the conkyrc.txt in the respective  directory in ~/.conky/ (to not have it disappear on desktop-click)\n\n*Install devilspie\n\n*Create a rule in devilspie with the 'match' pattern\nwindow_name 'contains' conky (no capital c - it matters). Actually, with the provided \"Get\" Button there you can use any match pattern that works.\n\n*as actions, select 'skip_tasklist','unminimize' and if you want to have it on all workspaces, also 'stick'.\n\n*Thats it.\n\n\nDo check 'Run devilspie at startup' obviously.\nsideeffect: the Conky Manager Window will behave similiar when open depending on the match pattern, shouldn't be any problem, though.\nMy problem was this:\n'own_window_type override' created the problem that the changing items of the conky wouldn't substitute but rather be drawn on top of older values - ugly and also illegible within seconds.\n'own_window_type desktop' just didn't do the trick.\n'own_window_type dock' in conjunction with devilspie solved the original problem, but wouldn't play nice with this nifty little script to add a 'show desktop but keep active window stay up' - hot-key like Windows Win + \nHome.

Note, there is no \"below\" setting in own_window_hints, as although that still works it causes conky to disappear and reappear (flicker) after a few seconds when showing the desktop.

Thinkpads (e.g. X230 that I'm using) have both a trackpoint and a touchpad. The touchpad is disabled when typing.\nHowever, when I'm using the trackpoint, I often touch the touchpad as well, and generate mouse clicks I'd like to avoid. Does anyone have an idea how disable mouse-clicks on touchpad when trackpoint is in use?\nEDIT: also, can someone explain how the option of disabling touchpad when typing works? What is being done behind the scenes? Is it an xinput configuration command, and if yes, which one?\nEDIT2: clarification; manually disabling Touchpad (even with a shortcut) is not the issue here. This should work just like the option \"disable touchpad when typing\", since I use Touchpad and Trackpoint interchangeably (most frequently, I use Touchpad for scrolling and Trackpoint for moving the cursor).\n\nA: First thing to be done is to know your touch pad id.So to do that follow these steps\nFirst open terminal and Run this command\n~$ xinput --list\n\nHere we get this Touchpad id = <id Number>\nAfter that open keyboard shortcuts then add this below two command with your keyboard shortcuts.\n# Disable Touchpad:\nxinput set-prop <id number> 'Device Enabled' 0\n\n# Enable Touchpad:\nxinput set-prop <id number> 'Device Enabled' 1\n\n\n\n\nA: Disabling touchpad when keyboard is in use\nThis function is performed by the syndaemon utility, from the xserver-xorg-input-synaptics package. You can set options such as the idle time, the polling frequency, etc (see runtime help):\n\nUsage: syndaemon [-i idle-time] [-m poll-delay] [-d] [-t] [-k]\n  -i How many seconds to wait after the last key press before\n     enabling the touchpad. (default is 2.0s)\n  -m How many milli-seconds to wait until next poll.\n     (default is 200ms)\n  ...\n  -t Only disable tapping and scrolling, not mouse movements.\n\nHere's the source code for syndaemon.c.\n\n\n*\n\n*The important functions are keyboard_activity(...) and main_loop(...)\n\n*keyboard_activity uses the XQueryKeyMap API call to get the current state of the keyboard (1 bit per key), and then compares is to the last (old) state; if they are different, it returns 1\n\n*main_loop polls keyboard_activity every m milliseconds, and based on the \"last activity time\" and whether keyboard_activity returns true or false, it decides whether to disable or enable the touchpad.\n\n*The dp_get_device function illustrates how X input devices are enumerated; you should be able to modify this and the keyboard_activity function to also check for any trackpoint activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The xinput tool lists devices and IDs, for example\"\n\nVirtual core pointer                     id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint                     id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\n*You can get this (the ID) via the XListInputDevices function\n\n*After that, you must get a device handle from the ID using the XOpenDevice\n\n*Then, you use the XQueryDeviceState function to obtain the coordinates of the TrackPoint pointer; similar to the existing loop, you poll this every so often and check if the coordinates have changed (i.e. the TrackPoint is in use), and use that to toggle the touchpad on or off\n\n*You can use the xinput utility with the query-state switch and device ID to check if your programming is correct, for example:\n\n\n$ xinput query-state 12\n2 classes :\nButtonClass\nbutton[1]=up\nbutton[2]=up\nbutton[3]=up\nbutton[4]=up\nbutton[5]=up\nbutton[6]=up\nbutton[7]=up\nValuatorClass Mode=Relative Proximity=In\nvaluator[0]=854\nvaluator[1]=867\n\n\n*You are interested in the valuator values, which are X and Y coordinates of the TrackPoint\n\n*See the xinput source for more tips\n\n*To modify and rebuild this package:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the source with apt-get source...\n\n*Make your modifications to tools/syndaemon.c\n\n*Disable the existing syndaemon patches by commenting out the 118... and 124... lines in debian/patches/series\n\n*Build your modified package with dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc and the deb files will be in the parent directory.\n\n\nA: Here is a low-tech solution that might be bad for power usage (the syndaemon -T patch didn't work for me).\n#!/bin/sh\n\nTRACKPOINT_DEV=\"TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint\"\nSLEEP_TIME=5\n\nOLD_XY=0,0,\nwhile true; do\n  NEW_XY=`xinput query-state \"$TRACKPOINT_DEV\" |grep valu|awk 'BEGIN { FS = \"=\" } ; {print $2 \",\"}'|xargs`\n    if [ ! \"$OLD_XY\" = \"$NEW_XY\" ]; then\n      synclient TouchpadOff=1\n    else\n      synclient TouchpadOff=0\n    fi\n    sleep $SLEEP_TIME\n    OLD_XY=\"$NEW_XY\"\ndone\n\nIt has to get a little bit lucky to notice that you are using the trackpoint, because it can only tell the coordinates during each 5s interval.  In other words, it is conservative about disabling the touchpad but not should reliably re-enable it when the trackpoint is idle.\nAnyway, it helps me a lot on my ultrabook with wandering cursor from palm press.\n", "Q: How to create unified clipboard Working with clipboard can be like a hell.

Thanks\n\nA: A multi-core processor is a single processor that have more than 1 cores running at same speed.  \nDual CPU = Means 2 physical CPU's\nDual Core = Means that a single CPU that have two cores allowing it to deal with two threads at once\nFor example, a Quad Core Processor that runs at speed of 3GHz , will have 4 cores running at that speed.  What that means that at a given time the CPU can process data 4 times in 4 separate cores.  \nNewer applications and games are coded in a way that benefit from Multiore Processors.\nFor more information you can look at Understanding Linux /proc/cpuinfo\n\nA: It should be noted that on recent hardware, your computer will often report twice as many cores as physically exist - (on this i7 4-core machine System Monitor shows 8, for example). This is due to Hyperthreading, present in most modern systems.\nA hyperthreaded CPU can only execute one set of instructions at a time, but any given program tends to spend a lot of time waiting (for data to be fetched from memory, or other bits of hardware to do something) the CPU has multiple queues of instructions which can be switched between whenever one becomes idle. Thus, a single physical core is presented to the operating system as two virtual cores. \nThis is essentially the same as the operating system using threads to allow many programs to share a single processor, but being implemented as hardware rather than software is more efficient. The article above claims typical tasks on two virtual cores is about 30% faster than the equivalent work on one real core.\nSo, cat /proc/cpuinfo shows 8 processors, whereas dmidecode shows\nCore Count: 4\nCore Enabled: 4\nThread Count: 8\n\nie, 8 virtual cores and 4 real ones.\n", "Q: Replacing LF, NEL line endings in text file with CR+LF I have a text file with a strange character encoding that I'd like to convert to standard UTF-8.

Click the 'Disable' button to the right of it to disable the plugin. (Note that I've never bothered installing it so it's not present in my screenshot. If you have it installed you will see it here.) \n \nFor Chrome,\nGo to chrome://plugins/. Find it in the list of plugins and click on 'Disable'. (Once again I am using Flash in my screenshot example because I never installed Java.)  \n \nNote that the Java plugin and Javascript are two different things. See here [Java.com] or here [stackoverflow.com] for an explanation of the differences.\n\nA: According Ubuntu Help (installation guide) these packages are the ones related to java plugin for browsers:\nicedtea6-plugin icedtea-7-plugin\n\nTry remove them.\n\nA: Your browser should have the option to disable Java plugin. \nFor Chrome:\n\nUnder the Plug-ins section of the settings url: chrome://settings/content select \"Block All\".\nWith this option enabled, when you want to run plugins on a page you have 3 options:\n1.Right click on the plugin and choose \"Run this plug-in\" from the context menu\n2.Click the plugin icon in the URL bar and choose \"Run all plug-ins this time\n3.Add an exception for sites you trust so that they can run plugins without your explicit permission each time\nSource - Dan Herbert\nFor Firefox\nBy default, Firefox allows Java applets to launch automatically. However, you may decide that you do not want Java applets to run. To disable Java applets in Firefox:\n1.At the top of the Firefox window, click on the Firefox button (Tools menu in Windows XP), and then click Add-ons. The Add-ons Manager tab will open.\n2.In the Add-ons Manager tab, select the Plugins panel.\n3.Click on the Java (TM) Platform plugin to select it.\n4.Click on the Disable button (if the button says Enable, Java is already disabled).\n\nJava applets will no longer be permitted to launch in Firefox.\nSource\nSource 2\nIf you want to remove Java from your system, simply remove the packages you have installed.\nTo search Java packages, in a console type\ndpkg -l java\n\n", "Q: How to start Image Viewer in front of other Windows? I use image viewer on the gnome shell. Yet when I am in file manager and open an image, the image opens in the background.\nHow to start it in front of everything else?\n\nA: This is intentional Gnome Shell behavior. The way this focusing behavior works is if you double click the image or right click and open/open from Open With, the shell will detect if the e.g File Manager is still in focus/on top.\nExample, if you opened the image and then clicked back in to the File Manager in the 1-5 seconds it takes to open (perhaps to open something else), it will open in the background. If you have not clicked anything since you opened the image via either double click, Open with or return then it will automatically open that image in the foreground. If this behavior is not occurring the shell is either detecting the wrong activity inside of the File Manager, or something else is stealing focus.\nThe best way to change this would be to use the Steal My Focus extension, it does not work per application but hopefully that will be possible in the future.\nYou can install it by clicking THIS and selecting the On/Off toggle switch, then accept to install. Once installed it should begin working automatically.\nThis should work on 3.2 as well as 3.4.\n\nA: I think I found answer to that problem; it is a problem that appears with other programs also. I've solved it completely by configuring compiz appropriately.\nPlease see my answer to this question:\nSometimes new windows don't come to the front when launched\n", "Q: Play sound from different applications on different output devices (speakers, headphones) I want music (played e.g. via Audacious) to be played on speaker system, and all other sounds produced by other applications (including ubuntu sound effects) to be played on headphones.\n\n\n*\n\n*My computer has sound connectors at its back, and also connectors on its front panel. When I connect both headphones and speakers, only headphones work (I take it, the front connectors take precedence?). Should I purchase another sound card (in addition to the motherboard-integrated sound I have)?\n\n*When I go to Audacious output settings, I see only the ouput plugin selection list, with PulseAudio selected and options like ALSA, OSS4 etc. But there's no facility to select particular output device (and I guess it wouldn't magically appear even if I had the second soundcard). Is this at all possible to bind specific application to particular output device?\n\nA: Two ways to do this: one is less specific to an application, and more to a task, and almost certainly will work, the other has worked on and off, but is more application specific.\nMethod 1 (the surefire one)\nNote this is reliant on parts of KDE and may be desktop-specific.\nOpen up Phonon audio settings and flip through the categories. Music can be assigned a different sound card than communications like Skype through a list which orders them from most preferred to least for each category. This may work on GNOME like desktops such as Unity, Xfce, LXDE, and other Gtk+ environments, but I have no proof.\nMethod 2 (partially covered in comments)\nIf you are using KDE, again, you're all set. If you are using a Gtk  or other desktop you may need to install something.\nIn KDE, just open up Kmix and right-click on the application slider shown in that'll window. You should see an option to switch sound cards.\nWith another desktop, install pavucontrol (shown as Pulse Audio Volume Control in the menu) flip to the applications tab, and either there's a button listing the sound card, or you right click on the app. Not 100% sure which, but the functionality is there (I think)\nBeing a Zoom H4n, Intel Audio, and M-Audio user, I know it can be done.\n", "Q: What music player for Ubuntu is *most* like Cog? Cog is, far and away, my favourite music player. File browser on the left panel, pull a folder into the right panel, it plays the files you pull into the main box. Simple! Easy! Nice! Especially since I store all my music on my non-primary drive. Cog doesn't care where I keep my music! It just deals with whatever folder I tell it to monitor. \nI also have about 200 gigs of music. It's a problem, I know. \nI can't find a player this simple and elegant in Ubuntu. \nAmarok: doesn't handle non-primary drives very well. \nBanshee: kinda good, but fussy browsing/playlist systems. \nAudacious: no file browser; it also crashes whenever I try to \"import\" all my music.\nAll I want -- seriously -- is something where I can look at my MP3 folder, drag a folder onto a playlist, and have that playlist play the songs. \n\nA: You can try BeatBox.\n\nBeatBox is an easy to use, stable, fast and good looking music library\n  organizer written in vala.\nIt has many modern features including Last.FM integration, (smart)\n  playlists, podcasts, Internet radio, similar songs playlist, simple\n  UI, instant search, queue system, mass song editing, advanced\n  equalizer and more.1\n\nTo install it, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

Where they will be installed? Many users use SSD disks (and I believe many more in the future) for their OS. 128GB SSD disks are common place nowadays and many users (like me) use their SSD for dual booting (Windows and Ubuntu). Ubuntu installations like this occupies 20-40 GB (/ , /home and swap). Up to now there was no problem. In a few weeks though, triple A games are coming to Ubuntu (i.e. l4d2) that require probably tens of GB for installation.\nIn windows there is no problem, because you can install a game anywhere you want (i.e. I install games in D:/Games/). In Ubuntu, though, programs install files in many places (i.e. /usr/* , /lib, /etc ) so from what I remember, I never had the option to choose where to install a program. \nSo, how will it be possible to install AAA games that require many GBs, when our Ubuntu installations won't have the necessary space? Could a /opt mounted on a mechanical disk (HDD) be the solution? Is it something I am missing?\n\nA: Firstly, (almost) any part of the filesystem can be moved to another disk, providing the appropriate /etc/fstab rules are set up so it is mounted at boot; /home on a separate disk is not uncommon, but there is no reason not to do the same for /opt or /usr.\nAs to where they will be installed, I don't know. I think the recent humble bundle et al games have mostly installed in /opt (can anyone confirm?). \nIn the L4D2 case I assume this will arrive along with steam for linux, and hence the installation will presumably not be managed by apt but the steam installer will create its own managed install area somewhere (as with Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps on windows) - perhaps this will be configurable, but we can't really say until we get to see it.\n\nA: Steam on Windows does not allow you to chose an install location for the games, everything gets installed into the Steam directory. On Linux this will very likely be handled exactly the same way, i.e. you can chose where to install Steam, but everything you install then from Steam will go to where Steam goes.\nDesura, which is already available for Linux and works much the same as Steam already does this. You can pick where to install Desura and all the games then go to desura/common/${GAMENAME} subdirectory.\n\nA: Originally most data for programs are installed into /var, /usr, /run. And for those games and software that are proprietary like magic8ball and proprietary programs like Adobe Acrobat Reader they install into /opt. \nSo steam may install into /opt and /var, having a separate drive for just /var and one for /opt (or use a 2TB drive and split it into 2 1TB partitions each for /var and /opt (one 1TB drive for /usr would be nice too) if you like proprietary games and programs. But it can get expensive.\n", "Q: (VRML) Files, How to Render How can i render (VRML) Files.\nFrom here http://csi.chemie.tu-darmstadt.de/ak/immel/script/redirect.cgi?filename=http://csi.chemie.tu-darmstadt.de/ak/immel/tutorials/orbitals/vrml.html\nhttp://csi.chemie.tu-darmstadt.de/ak/immel/tutorials/orbitals/vrml/1s.wrl\nI am unable to play these file in Chrome Current Version, Ubuntu 12.04.\nAlso, is there any way to get these models to work in any 3d molecule viewer.\n\nA: I have never used these files, but after some googling i came up with this site which lists some vrml/x3d viewers. I have tried the InstantPlayer binaries for ubuntu, but I couldn't get it to open the 1s.wrl file from your link. \nBut the view3dscene worked for me. On this page you can find the binaries for both 32-bit and 64-bit Ubuntu.\nIt's a bit ugly, but seems to work. Here is what it looks like on my computer:\n\n", "Q: How do I set up multiple HDD? I got some new hard discs and would like to set my PC up in the following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu is currently installed on one drive\n\n*I want to put Windows on a second drive\n\n*I would like a third drive for shared content (music and stuff) that both OSes can access  \nWhat I need to know is what format should the content drive be?  How should I configure the drive order in my bios for GRUB to be boot manager and how to configure GRUB for multi-HDD booting?\n\nA: Since you already have Ubuntu installed in the first drive, there is no need to uninstall it, if you are comfortable putting in and taking out hard drives from your computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the first drive containing Ubuntu.\n\n*Plug in the second drive, install Windows as if it is the only drive.\n\n*Plug back the first drive. Change boot order in BIOS to boot first from the first (Ubuntu) drive.\n\n*Boot Ubuntu and open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and type sudo update-grub\nThe last step should find the Windows in the second drive and update Grub accordingly and from next boot,you should be able to choose between Ubuntu and Windows.\nAs for the third drive, NTFS format should be fine. You may have to edit /etc/fstab to mount the third drive automatically.\n\nA: If you install Ubuntu last it will automatically add all the other stuff to your grub menu, it does not really matter how you partition your disks. Keep in mind that installing Windows will wipe out the grub boot loader.\nYour 3rd drive will need to be formatted NTFS or FAT32. I have had pretty good results mounting NTFS file systems under Ubuntu but FAT is probably more common.\nThis is how I run (well, close, 2 disks, first is split between XP, Win7 and 12.04, second disk is movies & music).\n", "Q: How to download torrents with long filenames? There is a known problem with transmission: it can't download torrents with filenames longer than 255 bytes. What are the workarounds?\n\nA: I am here not to solve the problem, but to offer an alternative.\nIf you are not determined to use Transmission by any means, you might want to use Vuze. I invite you to download it and give it a try: sudo apt-get install vuze\n\nA: The problem is the common Linux file systems only support up to 255 characters filename lengths. Yet the FAT32 file system supports longer filenames, and Linux supports it just fine!\nThe solution then is to just download to a FAT32 formatted partition. Any external storage should work (we usually keep pen drives FAT32 for compatibility with Windows anyway). Or you can just create your own partition.\n\nA: You shouldn't try to download the link, because it's not supported by your file system. \nRight click on magnet link, then 'copy link'. \nOpen transmission -> file -> Open URL, then paste.\nVoila!\n", "Q: How to boot up in kubuntu-mobile?

This is usually necessary for the newer GUID partition table for the BIOSes to recognise it or something (remember you are not limeted to four partitions like the Master Boot Record partition table so you can have as many as you want!)\n\nA: This can be tricky because it's not obvious what your boot mode is when you run the installer. Most modern UEFI computers support booting in both BIOS mode and in EFI mode, and there's no system-to-system consistency about which mode gets used by default. I recommend using the \"try before installing\" mode and checking your boot mode by looking for the /sys/firmware/efi directory; if it's present, you've booted in EFI mode, and if not you've probably booted in BIOS mode.\nIf you've booted in BIOS mode, installation should proceed as usual, possibly including the 1MiB \"bios_grub\" partition that Marcappuccino mentioned. (This is needed only if you use GPT for partitions, though.) If the system doesn't boot at this point, then it probably means that the firmware is trying to boot in EFI mode. Perusing your firmware's boot options (from F2, F10, F12, Del, or some other key at boot time) may provide a clue about why it's not working.\nIf you've booted the installer in EFI mode, then installation should also proceed normally, although you don't need the bios_grub partition; instead, you need a ~100-500MiB EFI System Partition (ESP) with a FAT filesystem. The Ubuntu installer should create this automatically when it runs in EFI mode. If the computer doesn't boot when you reboot after this installation, then it might be trying to boot in BIOS mode -- again, checking your firmware settings might find a solution. More likely, though, something went wrong with the EFI boot loader installation. In EFI, boot loaders are normal files on the ESP, so you can check them out from an emergency system. If you mount the EFI at /boot/efi (its more-or-less standard location), look for the /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu directory; it should hold a grub.efi file (or something with a similar name, like grubx64.efi; I don't recall precisely what Ubuntu uses). You can check that this file is correctly entered in the firmware's boot list by using the efibootmgr utility, which you may need to install with sudo apt-get install efibootmgr. Typing efibootmgr -v should produce a list of boot loaders. If you don't see GRUB in that list, then registering the boot loader may do the trick:\nefibootmgr -c -l \\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\grub.efi -L Ubuntu\n\nYou may need to adjust this command, though, especially if your ESP isn't on /dev/sda1. See the program's man page for details.\nIf this doesn't work, you can copy/rename GRUB from its location in /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu to live as /boot/efi/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi, or possibly /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi. The first name is the default EFI boot loader name, which the computer should boot if there are no other boot loaders available. The second is the name for Microsoft's boot loader, which some EFI implementations treat in a similar way (although really they shouldn't).\n\nA: After installing Ubuntu, use Boot-Repair from liveCD or liveUSB. Its Recommended Repair generally fixes EFI boot problems.\n\nA: I managed to get ubuntu to install correctly by pressing F6 and disabling all the special features like \"nomodeset\". Hope this helps.\nI have ASUS UEFI bios.\n\nA: please check this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI \nIt helps me with this one:\nCreating an EFI partition\nAn EFI partition is necessary to install Ubuntu in EFI mode via the manual Ubuntu installer. \nSince Ubuntu 12.04, it is possible to re-use an existing Windows7 EFI partition (without formatting it). If you use a previous version of Ubuntu, or if you have several installations of GNU/Linux in EFI mode, it is safer to create a new EFI partition EFI.\nAn EFI partition can be created via a recent version of GParted (the Gparted version included in the 12.04 disk is OK), and must have the following attributes:\nMount point: /boot/efi (remark: no need to set this mount point when using the manual partitioning, the Ubuntu installer will detect it automatically)\nSize: minimum 100Mib. 200MiB recommended.\nType: FAT32\nOther: must be located at the start of a GPT disk, and must have a \"boot\" flag.\n", "Q: Running Skyrim under separate x session?

I have a lot of video on the server. Most of it is in x264 in .mkv. I have a Samsung Nexus phone, and a Nexus 7 tablet.\nWhat are my options when it comes to streaming from the Ubuntu server to Android? I got smb up and running. Some friends of mine were talking about DLNA, the \"Playstation media server\" could be a solution? \n\nA: Serving over plain HTTP\nThe simplest possible solution is HTTP on the server in combination with an Android client with a video player that can do HTTP streaming, such as VLC, Nova Video Player, mpv for android, MxPlayer (ad-supported). There are plenty HTTP servers to choose from:\nHere are some one liners.\nPython 2.x (no seek support)\n$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000\n\nPython 3.x (no seek support)\n$ python -m http.server 8000\n\nTwisted (Python)\nFirst, install the twisted package if not already present with pip install -U twisted (pip3 install -U twisted), then:\n$ twistd -n web -p 8000 --path .\n\nAfter you start the web server, open the browser on your Android device and type the IP and port of your Ubuntu box e.g. http://192.168.1.123:8000\nYou can use ifconfig on Ubuntu to see the IP address.\nA more extended list of HTTP oneliner servers: https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255\nCaddyserver\nMy preferred choice is caddy with the built-in file-server plugin. Caddy is written in Go and unlike the python options above is production level software, works faster and can do range requests that will allow to seek videos. Start caddy with:\ncaddy file-server --listen :2030 --browse --root /\n\n\nThe line :2030 will make caddy listen on port 2030 so you you'll be able to access it at something like http://192.168.1.100:2030 (replace with the correct IP).\n\n\nIf needed, with caddy you can also enable basic authentication.\n\nSamba server-side + VLC/Kodi client-side\nIf you need to access your ubuntu box in a home network then you can also enable Samba on the Ubuntu server and then on your client device (Android/Linux/Mac/Windows) add an SMB share as in the SAMBA HOWTO — search for Add SMB share to Kodi Method 1|2. Kodi can also generate previews and fetch IMDB info for your movies if that's what you are after.\nVLC (mobile versions) will be able to discover and browse your Samba shares without extra fiddling. Desktop OS's normally have built-in support for samba shares so you can browse them pretty much like a local file system.\nClient-side caddy-based media browser\nGiven that caddy's file-server built-in plugin can also return a directory listing as JSON I created a client-side media browser that is pure js+html and only requires caddy to be running on the server with a custom Caddyfile. It's more of a proof-of-concept project and not meant for anything serious:\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/glowinthedark/mediabro4caddy\nIt works in the browser and will only play video formats that the browsers can play, so no proper MKV support.\n\nA: On your Android Device you will have to install a DLNA client to be able to access media shares you have on your server.\nOn your server you will have to run a DLNA/UPnP server that makes the shares accessible. Your network settings need to allow UPnP and Multicast (check with your router).\nThere are several solutions for an UPnP server you can choose from. With MiniDLNA, a leightweight but powerful DLNA server we able to stream MKV, and x264 content. This application is my recommendation for running on a headless server.\nWe can install it from the repositories with\nsudo apt-get install minidlna\n\nFor help on setting it up see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MiniDLNA\n\nA: On your server:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install minidlna:  sudo apt-get install minidlna\n\n*Configure /etc/minidlna.conf\nOn your android devide:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install bubbleupnp or any other dlna/upnp client\n\n*Select your server\n\n\nA: For media streaming using the UPnP media server specifications, I would look at:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mediatomb - runs in the background serving media, has a web interface which you can use to build the library.\n\n*Kodi - normally used as a client, but you can enable media serving under the Network options within it.\nYou can find both in the Software Center.\nAs far as Android clients go, there are ports of both VLC and Kodi.\n", "Q: find command to remove files says that some files don't exist I have an OSX Mountain Lion Laptop connected to and Ubuntu 11.10 system and tried to copy one .csv file from the OSX machine to the Ubuntu machine.

If you don't care to memorize a lot of options and scenarios, just don't use xargs, there's usually a better way anyway.) \nThe problem with xargs is that its input must be quoted in a peculiar way that no other tool produces. In particular, it can't cope with spaces in file names. You don't say what the error are (for future reference, copy-paste error messages), but chances are that one of the matching file names contains a space, and xargs choked on it.\nxargs -0 copes with any strange character you may have in a file name. Pass -print0 to find to make it print the names in the right format:\nfind . -name \"*.csv\" -print 0 | xargs -0 rm\n\nNote that sudo find … only runs the find command as root, not the rm command. If you want to run rm as root, use\nfind . -name \"*.csv\" -print0 | sudo xargs -0 rm\n\nUnder Ubuntu (and also under OSX), you can use find's built-in -delete option to delete matching files.\nfind . -name \"*.csv\" -delete\n\nIf you know that the files you want to delete are empty, better make the find command only look for empty files, so that you don't accidentally delete other files.\nfind . -name \"*.csv\" -type f -empty -delete\n\n", "Q: Simple and easy way to permanently mount remote folder We are planning to replace all our Windows Machine (around 25) of PHP development team to ubuntu and we found everything perfect here however, we have two major problems as we work in team, we do development on remote Linux server and we need to access remote folder on local machine\nAll major PHP editor does not allow to open file from bookmarked folder or remote folder mapped using connect to server options, it does not show at all.\nTo solve this problem we are trying to map folders using sshfs and we used many ways but we are not able to permanently map the folder, every time we restart it looses the mount\nwe also tried to use tutorial here http://www.tjansson.dk/?p=84\nthis is working and creates a folder for mapping but it throws permission error and does not show any contents.\nWe also tried to bookmark map using sshfs but bookmark does not work after reboot\nCan any one suggest best and simple way to permanently mount the folder or better way to access remote folder?\n or \nCan anyone suggest best approach to do a PHP development with a team on remote Linux server and client machine being ubuntu?\n\nA: I would say SSHFS was intended more for ad-hoc usage rather than permanent connections.\nThe right tool is probably NFS (Network File System).

I like everything about Ubuntu except two things.\nFirst, whenever I click the right mouse button in Firefox, it immediately hangs. I have to kill the process then. It becomes very annoying when I have several tabs open and I forget not to use the right mouse button. I had previously booted Ubuntu with UNetbootin, the same problem was there even then.\nSecondly, when I had not installed AMD drivers on Windows 7, the laptop was just eating through the battery. Only after  installing the drivers, did it come to cool down and started giving the 6 hours backup it was supposed to. Now, the problem is that in Ubuntu, the laptop is just throwing up the heat as if I am playing some heavy game. It goes without saying that the battery backup is poor - barely 2 hours. \nIs there any solution for this?\nAnd make that questions three - is there any beginners guide to Ubuntu? I feel seriously confused when trying to install a software. In fact I have no idea how to do it. I know there is Software Center but I have no idea how to operate it. The last time I used a Linux OS was Mint 8 few years back. At that time too, I felt seriously confused with all the commands you have to know about, in order to have any sense of control. \nMY system is HP Pavilion G6-2005AX, if that helps.\n\nA: The issue with Firefox has been reported as a bug on Launchpad. You can view the bug report and find some potentially useful comments regarding this issue on this page\nAs for the over-active GPU issue, you'll want to install the AMD Catalyst driver, which does an infinitely better job managing power consumption on RadeonHD cards and includes a utility (Catalyst Control Center) to manage the switchable graphics and set GPU-specific power management settings. To install the driver, just follow the step-by-step directions on this page. Note that these directions are intended to be used to download Catalyst version 12.4 -- this version works well, but is now a couple of versions behind. If you want the latest version of the driver (12.8) instead, you can still follow these directions and simply replace all instances of \"12.4\", \"12-4\", etc. with \"12.8\", 12-8\", etc.\nIf something goes wrong, or if for some reason you don't like the Catalyst driver and want to remove it and revert back to the default driver, follow the directions on this page (specifically answer #2, posted by bioShark).\nFinally, when it comes to installing software, check out this page for a good overview of various methods and this video for a tutorial on using the Ubuntu Software Center.\n", "Q: Run a (single) program as root I have been given a tool that uses a closed source library to operate the hardware watchdog timer on my \"PC\".

So,\nHow can I mark a program to allow a simple user (i.e. my userid) to run with root privileges?  TNX.\n\nA: You can use the setuid command to make it so anyone running the binary is root.

Managing your contacts from Gmail and Google+ is easy and quite good. \nUsing Android should give you all you need. Getting yourself a google mail address would be the first step then importing all your contacts into there. From there you can tie them to their google+ accounts, emails and phone numbers. \nOnce you get a android phone you tie your Google Mail address to it so it imports all your contacts from Gmail into phone for you. As soon as you start signing into Twitter, Facebook etc. It does most of this for you. Pulling pictures and contacts together to build your phone book for you. \nWord of warning though. I find facebook takes over your address book with people you barely no or are just friends with on facebook so i dont let that sync all my contacts. ( Recently deleted my account )\nIt can be done. But these eco systems tie you in which ever one you choose to use. \n\nA: There isn't ONE application that does this. It isn't ONE application that does this in the Apple ecosystem either. They just refer to all of the different things working together as the iCloud. As William Fleming has pointed out, everything syncs to Google, as far as mail, contacts, calendar goes. You just point your desktop email and calendar client (Evolution, Thunderbird, etc) to your Google account and they will stay in sync between your phone and your laptop. A Google/Gmail account is necessary for an Android phone, just as a Apple account is necessary for an iPhone.\nFor bookmarks, you can use Chrome on your phone and PC, and the bookmarks will stay in sync, provided you log into both with your Google account.\nFor documents/photos you can use the Dropbox service, and you have 2GB of free shared cloud storage. You can pay for more if necessary. When you install the Dropbox app on your phone, you can set it up so that all photos are automatically uploaded to Dropbox, which will automatically sync with your laptop.

When you run InSync, any files in this folder will be uploaded to your Google Drive.\n\nA: OpenOffice plugin ooo2g works on Libre Office too and might be what you're looking for.\nTo install, first of all you need to get the libreoffice java common package\nsudo apt-get install openoffice.org-java-common\n\nThen you can download the extension from the official site \nhttp://code.google.com/p/ooo2gd/downloads/list\nAnd finally install it from libreoffice, opening \n\nTools -> Extension Manager -> Add\n\nNow close and re-open libreoffice and you will se a new floating menu, which is able to export your document directly to GoogleDocs\n\nA: You can save officelibre docs directly to Google drive. Google offers different strategies to sync documents (or document folders) between Google Docs and Google Drive.\n", "Q: How to disable Qt accessibility in 12.04? Observed behavior\nWhen opening a KDE session, a blue round icon with a human silhouette appears in tray. It offers \"enable screensaver\" \"speak text\" \"speak keyboard\".\nIt seems related to processes /usr/lib/kde4/libexec/kaccessibleapp and kaccess.\nI don't really care. So far so good.\nContext\nI've hit a bug and reported it to KDE. Maintainer says :\n\nThe backtrace also indicates, that you may be use Qt with accessibility enabled. If this is the case, please ask in the forums of your distribution how to disable Qt accessibility, and report back, if this fixes the issue.\n\nWished behavior\nI wish \"Qt accessibility off\". That may mean not having this applet running.\nSolutions already tried\n\n\n*\n\n*Looking in KDE preference panel. There is an accessibility group (visual bell, modifier keys, keyboard filter), seems unrelated to \"qt accessibility\", does not mention the applet.\n\n*Googled, find various \"solutions\" for older KDE, none worked.\n\n*Searched AskUbuntu. Some questions on similar topics, not this one.\n\n*Tried brute force. If I kill processes containing the string \"kaccess\", (e.g. killall -v kaccessibleapp kaccess kglobalaccess ) it restarts right away.\n\n*Tried purging \"kaccessible\" package.\n\n\nEven after all this, qt accessibility features are still enabled, according to valgrind log.\nConclusion\nHow can I just disable qt accessibility features ? I don't need them at all and they may be the cause of the first problem.\nThank you for helping the community.\n\nA: The package maintainer at KDE level provided a hint.\n\nIf everything fails, check which package installs\n  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/plugins/accessiblebridge/libqspiaccessiblebridge.so\n  and try to remove it. If you cannot, because of dependencies, you can\n  manually move the file away as root, and restart the desktop. This\n  should remove support for Qt accessibility.\n\nOn Ubuntu 12.04 that boils down to sudo dpkg --purge qt-at-spi which effectively disables Qt accessibility.\nThis is a bit brute force (for example, it does not allow to enable accessibility for some users only), but it does answer the question with an effective solution, right ?\n\nA: I found an answer.  Make kaccessibleapp not-executable.  That will prevent it from starting back up.\nsudo chmod a-x /usr/lib/kde4/libexec/kaccessibleapp\n\n\nA: The file /usr/lib/kde4/libexec/kaccessibleapp is owned by the package kaccessible, so the cleanest way to fix the problem is:\nsudo apt-get purge kaccessible\n\n\nA: remove kaccessibe package\nsudo apt-get remove kaccessible\n\n", "Q: Accessing github on ubuntu through squid proxy I am not able to clone a particular github branch !\nIt shows following error when I try to do so.\n           Cloning into 'ws'...\n           error: The requested URL returned error: 407 while accessing https://github.com/abcd/efg.git/info/refs\n           fatal: HTTP request failed\n\nPlease Help !!\n\nA: try setting http_proxy and https_proxy prior to running git, it should honor these environment variables:\nexport http{,s}_proxy=http://your.squid.server.ip:3128\ngit whatever\n\n\nA: 407 is a Proxy Auth Required exception.

I just updated my Ubuntu from 10.04 to 12.04 yesterday and so far I'm very satisfied with it. \nThere is only one thing which is still missing to get back just the same comfort as I had with the previous version.\nI work on 4 workspaces and would like to have the ability to switch from one to another by just one click. \nWith Gnome there was the possibility to add the workspace switcher to the top-panel next to the system tray and I could easily click on just the workspace I wanted to switch to.\nOf course there I could switch by using the keyboard shortcuts, but I would like to use the mouse in addition. I don't like using the switcher on the left side because it's much slower.\nIs it possible to get the old workplace switcher back in the panel at the top?\n\nA: I am sorry but i do not know a solution for Unity. However, you can start your session with GNOME classic and everything will be more similar to the old GNOME. \nIn order to set up panels as in the older one, you will have to press Alt and Super keys at the same time that you use the mouse with right button to access options or middle button to arrange icons...\n\nA: There's not the exact same panel app, but a similar one seems to be working fine with Unity.

Trying nomodeset from the boot-loader then uses the Nvidia graphics (I think - my CPU usage still rockets with glxspheres) which then WON'T crash your VM.\nFYI - I have tried this but I'm afraid 3D acceleration support with Bumblebee is totally shite on Linux.\n\nA: @Xxx Xxx\nI think you're wrong. If your virtual machines works without errors (\"Hardware graphics acceleration is not available\", \"No 3D support is available from the host\"), it may be because you have activated the \"mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = TRUE\" option in your vmx configuration file.

It seems large for just the MBR?\nWould also appreciate it if anyone can explain what sda5 and 6 are being used for? Is sda5 Ubuntu and sda6 my data?\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: Should work just fine. If you want to see what the 776MB are, take a look into the folder /ext4a using nautilus or a terminal. Because it is mounted it will have an entry in the file /etc/fstab. Edit it and delete the entry for /dev/sda1 respectively /ext4a.\nYou are also right about sda5 and sda6. sda5 is the root mount point /. That means everything that has no different mountpoint is saved on that partition. In this case your system and your installed programs. sda6 contains the home folders. Your home folder is used for saving your personal files including the Pictures, Music, Documents, etc folders and even the Desktop. Most programs you use also save their settings in your homefolder. So if you want to reinstall your Ubuntu at some time, you should be able to format sda5 and use sda6 as /home mountpoint again without formating and all your files and program settings will be kept.\n", "Q: gnome-panel doesn't work correctly with separate x screens I am having a problem with Gnome3 (actually, I have it set to fallback mode, or\nGnome 2). I have two displays and I need an X screen (I used\nnvidia-xconfig and nvidia-settings to do this) for each screen.\nHowever, every time I either restart X or log in, Gnome seems to\nbe adding the objects values under /gnome/gnome-panel/layouts (ex.\nfirst time I set the two separate X screens I had clock, then log\nout/in, there was clock and clock1 under objects, and then log out/in\nthere were three, clock, clock1, clock2,.......log out/in,\n............30 times....clock, clock1, clock2, ......clock 42.....!! The\nsame thing goes for top-panels, menu-bars, etc.)\nAfter a while, I found out I could remove all those using the\ndconf-editor, going to /gnome/gnome-panel/layouts, removing all the\nrepetitions under fields objects-id-list and top-id-list and leaving\none value of each object. This is not a solution but at least allow me\nto keep using Linux without so much trouble. However, the problem\npersists every time I restart X or log in.\nI now finally learned about \"dconf\" and where the user profile\nsettings are located (~/.config/dconf/user) and one can use \"dconf\" to\nsee the keys. In my case, I need to change/remove many keys (all those\nclocksX, workspace-X, menu-bar-X, etc., where goes from 1 to 42 and\nstill counting) so it's really tedious and boring to be changing one by one\nusing \"dconf write\". So I found \"dconf dump\", which actually allow me\nto dump everything into a .txt file and edit the file really quick\n(i.e, \"dconf dump / >> dump_user.txt\"). The problems? Two of them:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I \"load\" back \"dump_user.txt\" I edited into the user\nprofile? (I read somewhere there was a \"dconf reload\" but reload\ndoesn't exist as a command under \"dconf\")\n\n*How do I stop Gnome from keep adding more objects to my desktop\nenvironment every time I log in/restart X?\nNOTE: The problem doesn't occur when I set the displays to use\nTwinView feature (i.e., the desktop is extended/shared by both\ndisplays). However, for my case I need two separate X's.\nAny help/suggestion would be greatly appreciated.\nEDIT: I found a way to remove the keys permanently.\n\"This is possible using the dconf reset command, though it's not clear if that's a side-effect of a bug.\nFor a single key:\ndconf reset \"/path/to/the/key\"\nMust not end with a /.\nFor a whole path:\ndconf reset -f \"/path/to/the/path/\"\nMust end with a /.\"\nfrom http://askubuntu.com/questions/45535/how-do-i-clean-up-my-dconf-database\nBut again (as the author of the original post said), it's a temporary patch not the solution. I have no idea why dconf (or whatever piece of software does that) keeps adding keys every time I restart X/log in.\nThanks\n\nA: Use dconf load, not dconf reload. Try dconf help to see the available commands. dconf dump is the inverse of dconf load.\nSo in this regard, if you backed up and modified your dconf settings with:\ndconf dump / > settings.txt\n\nYou can modify them on file using any text editor, and then populate them into ~/.config/dconf/user by:\ndconf load / < settingsModified.txt\n\n\nA: It will stop when someone fix the bug in gnome panel.\n\nA: If you would like to edit dconf configuration files I would suggest you use the dconf-editor gui or the gsettings frontend.\ndconf-editor can be installed by running sudo apt-get install dconf-tools. gsettings should already be installed, but it is much harder to use. \n\nA: Ubuntu 13.04 - Has half fix for bug in gnome-panel. Panels will be created on correct screen, but you will need manually create objects for other screen panels. Or use dconf-tools to move object to correct panels.\nUbuntu 12.04 - You can go to launchpad bug and download two last attached packages which includes full fix. Or you can wait until other devs will merge my fix.

There are parties, e.g. enterprises, that uses S/MIME certificates for e-mail encryption. To my understanding Thunderbird has support by default for S/MIME. But I have not found a way to obtain a personal S/MIME certificate to be used on a Ubuntu system. Thus my question: \nHow to obtain a S/MIME certificate for e-mail encryption?\nMoreover, is it correct to believe that Thunderbird has support by default for S/MIME?\nI am fully aware of PGP, GnuPG and OpenPGP for public-key cryptography and secure e-mail communication. In my opinion, it is very useful that OpenPGP is installed by default on Ubuntu systems. But I need to find a method to communicate securely with parties that use S/MIME and not PGP/GnuPG/OpenPGP.\n\nA: There are some issuing bodies that will give you a free certificate, as listed in this Mozillazine article here. One company that offers them for no charge is Comodo and another is startssl as mentioned by Taneli, so those two are two decent possibilities. Personally, I used the Comodo certificate for a while until I had to move to OpenPGP. The Comodo one is guaranteed to work with s/mime compliant applications and their information page mentions thunderbird. \nThunderbird by default has great support for S/MIME signing and encryption. As noted in another mozillazine article, it is relatively quick to setup, although it is advised to set a master password as well to protect the use of your certificates. Importantly, you need to do this before importing your certificate into thunderbird.\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to import your certificate into thunderbird by going to edit > preferences > advanced > certificates (first screenshot). \n\n*You then need to add your certificate to your Thunderbird mail account (see second screenshot) by going to account settings and clicking the security tab. All this is simple to setup and to use once you have your certificate. \n\n*The security options are clearly visible when composing a mail (see third screenshot) and you can add your signature or fully encrypt the mail.\n\n\nThese screenshots are from thunderbird 14.\n(Note: I have temporarily removed the enigmail OpenPGP addon from my copy of thunderbird so that the menus in my screenshots should look the same as in your thunderbird.) \n\n\n\n\nA: I have no experience using them in thunderbird, but S/MIME certificates are issued by certificate authorities. This often involves some sort of payment and validation (of sorts) of your identity / existence. For practical purposes, at least startSSL seems to be issuing them for free. Many organizations (companies, schools, etc) may be able to issue such certificates for their employees/other associates.\n", "Q: Change icon size in unity's application switcher (alt-tab)?

Unable to boot please use a kernel appropiate for your CPU\"\ni'll aprecciate \n\nA: Check some possible reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hard disk moved in another computer or updated motherboard/cpu\n\n*grub pointing to wrong kernel\n\n*you are trying to run from wrong ubuntu cd image\n\n\nA: This is happening because you are trying to run the 64-bit version of Ubuntu on a 32-bit machine. You are probably attempting to boot from a live CD/DVD or live USB flash drive. If so, you'll need to download the correct ISO image (the one with i386 rather than amd64 in its name), and burn a new CD/DVD or write the new image to the USB flash drive.\nIf this is happening on an installed system, that's somewhat strange. As Beernarrd has said, it's possible that you are trying to boot an Ubuntu system from a hard drive that was moved to a 32-bit machine from a 64-bit machine. It's also possible you've replaced your 64-bit CPU with a 32-bit CPU, but that's also pretty unlikely--these days, there aren't that many motherboards that take both 32-bit and 64-bit CPU's. (Also, if you had just replaced your CPU, you would probably have told us about that in your question...)\nI don't think it's particularly plausible that this could be caused by GRUB pointing to the wrong kernel. 64-bit kernels are extremely unlikely to be installed on a 32-bit system. If you had done that, you would probably know about it. It's not the sort of thing you can usually do by accident.\nTo reiterate: If this is happening when you're trying to use a live CD/DVD/USB, the problem is that your machine has a 32-bit processor but you used the 64-bit .iso image (with amd64 in its name) rather than the 32-bit .iso image (with i386 in its name).\n", "Q: What does \"ext\" mean, as referred to by the sfntly installation instructions? This should be an easy one. I'm following these instructions to install sfntly. The instructions for installing a package say that the package should be \"extracted to ext\". What is meant by \"ext\"? Is this a directory? (I don't see a directory called \"ext\" in the root.)\n\nA: From what I understand in the instructions, the main package sfntly needs the Google C++ testing framework. They say you should extract the latter to ext, probably meaning that the source of the main package has a directory ext where you should place the Google C++ testing framework and rename it to gtest (or make a link).\nSo, if the sfntly source has a directory ext, that is where you should put e.g. the Google C++ testing framework (the name suggests it is where you should put external library software).\n", "Q: Is there a program that can adjust display brightness according to battery percentage?

Click the unity button, then go to additional hardware, make sure you have a graphics card, or a driver installed. \nfrom your screenshot, can't tell if it is a font issue or a graphics issue. \nIf it is a font issue, try this: \nall that means is you installed the fonts to ~/.fonts or somewhere in your local user folders and it is not accessible to all users. \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fonts \nyou have 3 main ways of installing fonts, the first one is the one that is causing you issues. the second way is to install them using ubuntu software center. and the 3rd way is to do it manually. I recommend you to do the following steps. \nYou will need to enable the Universe and Multiverse repositories \nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\nthis will install all the windows fonts and they should be accessible to all users. \n\nA: This seems to be a problem with your screen (since you mentioned that it happens when you leave the computer ON for a day or so).\nIt may be due to a effect known as Image Persistence or screen burn-in. According to about.com:\n\n...image persistence on LCD monitors is caused\n  by the continuous display of static graphics on the screen for\n  extended periods of time. What this does is cause the LCD crystals to\n  have a memory for their location in order to generate the colors of\n  that graphic. When a different color is then displayed in that\n  location, the color will be off from what it should be and instead\n  have a faint image of what was previously displayed.\n\nThis effect is not permanent. You can correct it by following either of the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the screen for sometime (this time can vary across different monitors).\n\n*Use a screensaver which is complete white, and let it display for sometime.\nPersonally, I'd prefer the first one.\nAbout.com also provides measures to prevent this issue:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Set the screen to turn off after a few minutes of screen idle time under the Power functions in Windows. Turning the monitor display off\n  will prevent an image from being displayed on the screen for extended\n  periods of time. Of course, this could be annoying to some people as\n  the screen may go off more than they wish.\n  \n*Use a screen saver that either rotates, has moving graphic images or is blank. This also prevents an image for being displayed in screen\n  for too long.\n  \n*Rotate any background images on the desktop. Background images are one of the most common causes for image persistence. By switching\n  backgrounds every day or few days, it should reduce the change of\n  persistence.\n  \n*Turn off the monitor when the system is not in use. This will prevent any problems where the screen saver or power function fails to\n  turn off the screen and result in an image sitting on the screen for\n  long times.\n  \n\n", "Q: When attempting to dual-boot Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7, boot loader cannot mount root.disk My PC manufacturer has already allocated all four primary disk partitions, so I attempted to install Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 7 using Wubi.

After that it will connect but only for a little while before once again dropping the connection. Connection to some routers is more prone to disconnection than others. I tried changing channels, encryption protocol (wpa//wpa2), even a/b/g/n with no consistent results.\nFor this reason, I tried installing the official Ralink drivers (rt3562sta) that can be downloaded from http://www.ralinktech.com/en/04_support/support.php?sn=501 (namely RT3062PCI/mPCI/CB/PCIe(RT3060/RT3062/RT3562/RT3592) driver). I followed instructions (similar to the ones found here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1850267) and installed the driver while blacklisting other drivers. Now here's the curious thing. If I modprobe the driver (\"sudo modprobe rt3562sta\", this is btw the name of the driver created by compiling), assuming that there are no other drivers loaded, I get nothing (e.g. \"iwconfig\" and \"ifconfig\" list no wireless devices).\nHowever, if I type \"sudo ifconfig ra0 up\" the device does come up in \"iwconfig\" and \"ifconfig\", the LED on the keyboard turns on, and I can even scan for wireless networks  via \"iwlist scan\" but the network-manager does not recognize existence of wireless. I also tried restarting network-manager and rebooting the machine and that had no effect.\nCould this be because the wireless device is using ra0 as opposed to wlan0 (as was the case with the old wireless card) or is there something else causing problems? If so, how could one change this?

Upon restarting Ubuntu, I unfortunately lost the ability to choose the OS that I wanted to run (i.e., Ubuntu). \nOrdinarily, I'd expect to: \n1. Hit the power button\n2. A menu (Grub?) shows up listing all OSs installed in the PC (namely, Win7 and Ubuntu)\n3. Choose which OS I want and hit enter. bingo. \nThe problem is that I don't see that menu (step 2 above).

If that is the case, you should solve it by booting your Ubuntu installation (by plugging in the USB drive) and running sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc.\nThis command will ask you some questions, the first two will be about the \"linux cmdline\" leave those at their defaults (the first may be blank, that's normal) and continue by pressing Enter. When prompted for install devices, select your internal drive (something like \"sda\" or \"sdb\", but not a partition like \"sda1\" or \"sdb5\") as an install device. Use space bar to select/unselect devices and hit Enter to continue once the proper device is selected. If you're not sure which device to choose, simply ask here and post a screenshot of the prompt and I will help you chose.\nOnce you've done this, not only will grub's boot sector be installed to the MBR of your internal drive (so that you see the grub menu even when the USB drive isn't plugged in) but the grub-pc package will also be properly configured to continue installing grub's boot sector there whenever it's upgraded.\n", "Q: Can I automatically purge every package I've ever uninstalled?

I was looking for the difference between the \".\" and \"source\" builtin commands and a few sources (e.g., in this discussion, and the bash manpage) suggest that these are just the same.\nHowever, following a problem with environment variables, I conducted a test. I created a file testenv.sh that contains:\n#!/bin/bash\necho $MY_VAR\n\nIn the command prompt, I performed the following:\n> chmod +x testenv.sh\n> MY_VAR=12345\n> ./testenv.sh\n\n> source testenv.sh\n12345\n> MY_VAR=12345 ./testenv.sh\n12345\n\n[note that the 1st form returned an empty string]\nSo, this little experiment suggests that there is a difference after all, where for the \"source\" command, the child environment inherits all the variables from the parent one, where for the \".\" it does not.\nAm I missing something, or is this is an undocumented/deprecated feature of bash?\n[ GNU bash, version 4.1.5(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) ]\n\nA: Short Answer\nIn your question, the second command uses neither the . shell builtin nor the source builtin. Instead, you are actually running the script in a separate shell, by invoking it by name like you would with any other executable file. This does give it a separate set of variables (though if you export a variable in its parent shell, it will be an environment variable for any child process, and therefore will be included in a child shell's variables). If you change the / to a space, then that would run it with the . built-in, which is equivalent to source.\nExtended Explanation\nThis is the syntax of the source shell built-in, which executes the contents of a script in the current shell (and thus with the current shell's variables):\nsource testenv.sh\n\nThis is the syntax of the . built-in, which does do the same thing as source:\n. testenv.sh\n\nHowever, this syntax runs the script as an executable file, launching a new shell to run it:\n./testenv.sh\n\nThat is not using the . built-in. Rather, . is part of the path to the file you are executing. Generally speaking, you can run any executable file in a shell by invoking it with a name that contains at least one / character. To run a file in the current directory, preceding it by ./ is thus the easiest way. Unless the current directory is in your PATH, you cannot run the script with the command testenv.sh. This is to prevent people from accidentally executing files in the current directory when they intend to execute a system command or some other file that exists in some directory listed in the PATH environment variable.\nSince running a file by name (rather than with source or .) runs it in a new shell, it will have its own set of shell variables. The new shell does inherit the environment variables from the calling process (which in this case is your interactive shell) and those environment variables do become shell variables in the new shell. However, for an shell variable to be passed to the new shell, one of the following must be the case:\n\n\n*\n\n*The shell variable has been exported, causing it to be an environment variable. Use the export shell built-in for this. In your example, you can use export MY_VAR=12345 to set and export the variable in one step, or if it is already set you can simply use export MY_VAR.\n\n*The shell variable is explicitly set and passed for the command you're running, causing it be an environment variable for the duration of the command being run. This usually accomplishes that:\nMY_VAR=12345 ./testenv.sh\n\nIf MY_VAR is a shell variable that hasn't been exported, you can even run testenv.sh with MY_VAR passed as an environment variable by setting it to itself:\nMY_VAR=\"$MY_VAR\" ./testenv.sh\n\n./ Syntax for Scripts Requires a Hashbang Line to Work (Correctly)\nBy the way, please note that, when you invoke an executable by name as above (and not with the . or source shell built-ins), what shell program is used to run it is not usually determined by what shell you're running it from. Instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*For binary files, the kernel may be configured to run files of that particular type. It examines the first two bytes of the file for a \"magic number\" that indicates what sort of binary executable it is. This is how executable binaries are able to run.\nThis is, of course, extremely important, because a script can't run without a shell or other interpreter, which is an executable binary! Plus, many commands and applications are compiled binaries rather than scripts.\n(#! is the text representation of the \"magic number\" indicating a text executable.)\n\n*For files that are supposed to run in a shell or other interpreted language, the first line looks like:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n/bin/sh may be replaced with whatever other shell or interpreter is intended to run the program. For example, a Python program might start with the line:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nThese lines are called hashbang, shebang, and a number of other similar names. See this FOLDOC entry, this Wikipedia article and Is #!/bin/sh read by the interpreter? for more information.\n\n*If a text file is marked executable and you run it from your shell (like ./filename) but it doesn't begin with #!, the kernel fails to execute it. However, seeing that this has happened, your shell will try to run it by passing its name to some shell. There are few requirements placed on what shell that is (\"the shell shall execute a command equivalent to having a shell invoked...\"). In practice, some shells--including bash*--run another instance of themselves, while others use /bin/sh. I highly recommend you avoid this and use a hashbang line instead (or run the script by passing it to the desired interpreter, e.g., bash filename).\n*GNU Bash manual, 3.7.2 Command Search and Execution: \"If this execution fails because the file is not in executable format, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a shell script and the shell executes it as described in Shell Scripts.\"\n\nA: Yes, you're missing something.  \nI think you're confusing the '.' that means current directory, as in ./testenv.sh and the '.' that means source (which is a built-in command). So in the case when '.' means source it would be . ./testenv.sh.  Make sense?\nSo try this:\nMY_VAR=12345 \n. ./testenv.sh\n\n", "Q: How to listen to radio flash, a media player?

They're have no differencies beetween paid ones (except short duration - 2 months). But you can set automatical renew.

When you first insert the device, it will act as a CDROM and the driver gets installed from that CDROM. On subsequent insertion, the modem first mounted as CDROM and then very quickly it switched to the Modem mode, when the system detects the available driver.\nQuoting from Wikipedia Article:\n\nWhen a device uses the ZeroCD method means that it behaves as a USB CD-ROM when first connected, with a virtual CD-ROM inserted with the Windows device drivers and related Cosmote control program. Once the Windows device drivers are installed, a special USB command is sent to the device to “switch” it to modem mod\n\nThe package which is responsible to do the switching to the proper mode in Ubuntu is usb-modeswitch. So, Ubuntu 12.04 successfully switched the modem from CDROM mode to modem mode, which is required to use that as a modem.\nThen why 10.04 mounts that as CDROM?\nI guess, the usb-modeswitch package installed on Ubuntu 10.04 was missing the proper switching configuration for your specific Modem. (Please note that, proper configuration is required to do switch, such as vendor_id, product_id etc.). So, it only mounts it as a CDROM and can't go further.\nIf you are interested to see the content of the Modem device in CDROM mode, you have to prevent switching. (I'll add more info on this topic, if I find them). But, if you want to use the device as Modem, I think, you need to setup a connection using your modem now as it is already detected as modem.\nIf you want to mount the CDROM mode of the modem\n\n\n*\n\n*First remove the USB Modem\n\n*Use this command to prevent usb_modeswitch to automatically switch to Wimax mode upon insertion.\nsudo chmod -x /usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch\n\n\n*Then remove the driver if already activated. For my device (it is ZTE AX226 from Banglalion) the driver is bcm_wimax. So, I removed it with command:\nsudo modprobe -r bcm_wimax\n\nThe drive may not be the same as me, but You can see a list of drivers loaded by the OS with command lsmod.\n\n*Then execute lsblk command to see the CDROM mode of the device and it's device name. Alternatively you can use Disk-utility tool. For me it is /dev/sr1.\n\n*Then use udisks or Disk-utility to mount the device.\nudisks --mount /dev/sr1\n\nIf will be mounted most probably in /media/disk folder.\n\n*Do what you wanted to do with it.\n\n*Then again re-enable the usb_modeswitch with this command: (\nThis step is important)\nsudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch\n\n", "Q: Keyboard not responding at login on Toshiba Satellite L775 Just created a separate partition to load Ubuntu 12.04 as a dual boot on a Toshiba Satellite L775.

You should move your www folder out of your home folder an reconfigure apache. The default for that would be /var/www.\n#2 If you selected \"encrypt home folder\" during install it only encrypted the home folder of the user you created during install. If the files of e.g. apache are saved somewhere else (even in /home/some_folder) it would work.\n\nA: I had the same problem when I had problems logging in and ended up changing my login password from a different user account.

There are files in Downloads that I want.\nHow to access them from my external in De Ja Dup backup?\n\nA: OK, so you have configured DejaDup correctly, because you were able to restore the other folders.\nIf that is the case, I have probably bad news to you. The default configuration of Deja Dup explicitly excludes the folders Trash and Downloads, as you can see on the following picture:\n\n\nA: You can restore it to specific folder, without infecting your system.\nGo to system settings, then backup, klick on restore, select folder where you have your backup, select date of backup, and select 'restore to specific folder' option. It will make folder, where you can find everything, you have previously backuped.\n\nA: I've got a solution!\nI know its way to late for the original enquirer, but may be it helps some other guys.\nSo on a fresh install (of the OS or Deja Dup) the folder ~/downloads is ignored. That's why Deja Dup is thinking there is no backup (a little bit stupid, could also show the option and check then...).\nSo to restore your downloads, you have to remove the folder from the ignored ones. Then Deja Dup thinks there are backups and searches for them.\nPS: of course this only helps if there are back ups for this folder :)\n", "Q: Clearing firefox's cache \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I get the menu bar in firefox? \n\nI have ubuntu installed on my mac with VirutalBox.

I'm running Lubuntu 12.04 on an original EeePC. In Arch Linux there's a repository which provides a highly customized very light-weight kernel specifically tailored for that particular machine's hardware.\nIs there anything which would prevent me from using that kernel with Lubuntu? I understand that I'll have to download it manually and configure GRUB myself.\n\nA: In general, the answer is \"yes\". You can always install an alternative kernel without breaking anything in your system. And since you can have multiple kernel alternatives that can be selected at boot time, you don't risk much: if your new kernel is not really working well with Ubuntu, you can always boot the system using the previous kernel.\nHowever, the particular repository and package you mention are tailored to be used with the Archlinux distro. What that means is that while you can most likely use the tailored kernel with your Ubuntu system, you will run into problems when trying to install this kernel as a package, because Archlinux uses a different packaging system. I would not try to install that particular kernel package without understanding pacman.\nProbably the best solution would then be to use the git archive (mentioned at the kernel-eee Archlinux page) to copy the package sources to your computer, and then compile and install the kernel manually. This is actually easier than it sounds, but nonetheless requires some skill and reading. Nothing for you if you just \"want it to work\".\nAlternatively, google for \"eeepc kernel Ubuntu\", maybe there are packages already compiled for Ubuntu.\n\nA: \nDifferent distros most certainly do NOT use the same kernel, not the\n  version nor the actual kernel even if the versions match, there are\n  usually patches applied by many distros and they're compiled for\n  different architectures and with different options.\nDistrowatch lists the default kernel used by each of the distros it\n  tracks.\n\"The Linux kernel\" is a fairly complicated piece of software which can\n  be compiled in a number of different ways. Basically, a configuration\n  file is set up with a laundry-list of options, and this file\n  subsequently determines exactly which blocks of source-code are or are\n  not included in \"the Linux kernel\" for your system. (The same process\n  also determines which \"kernel modules\" are built.)\nGenerally speaking, a distro writer will do all of that \"heavy\n  lifting\" for you: they'll compile one or more kernels, using config\n  options that they have carefully selected, and include those (in\n  binary form) in their distributions. They might even include custom\n  patches.\nSo, the answer to your question is \"both 'yes' and 'no.'\" Yes, several\n  distros might use \"Linux version X.Y.Z.,\" but No, they might not use\n  the same configuration options when building it.1\n\nI hope that this answers your question.\n1Source:LinuxQuestions.org\n\nA: Ok, since I promised detailed instructions:\nArch packages are just .tar.gz files, so I downloaded and unpacked the kernel from the same URL which is used by Arch's package manager.\nInside the archive, there are boot, lib and usr directories, which contents I copied inside the corresponsing directories on my hard disk. \nThen I looked into .INSTALL file and realized that I need to run \n. usr/share/kernel-eee/currver\ndepmod -a $KERNEL_VERSION\n\nwhich supposedly \"generated modules.dep and map files\".\nThen I added the kernel to the GRUB boot menu as described here, although as I remember the file I edited was different.\nIn my tests, the machine booted 5 seconds faster with the new kernel and used slightly less RAM than with stock Ubuntu kernel. \nAnd it was fun :)\n", "Q: Internet Connections Ubuntu 12.04 Server with Unity GUI I am very new to all this and thought I'd have a look at ubuntu with the hope of it running my server.\nI have installed Ubuntu 12.04 Server which went fine, I then installed Unity again this was all fine.\nI can access the GUI fine but my one problem is Internet Connection.\nIt works fine, I can access the internet and everything but I can't view System Setting>Network as it says 'The system network service are not compatible with this version'\nI also can't see any network connections or if I click on edit connections it opens fine but I can't actually edit or add anything as it is all shaded out.\nI was trying to assign my server a static ip address \nDoes anyone have any idea what's up with this.

How do I paste lines like that to nano or any other linux text editor?\n\nA: *\n\n*Mindterm is a browser-based, Java-applet SSH client. \n\n*Copy/paste may be available using either the Edit menu or the Ctrl+Ins (Copy) or Shift+Ins (Paste) shortcuts:\n\n\n*Copy/paste from your local clipboard may not be available depending on the version of Java you have installed and Mindterm's settings by Amazon\n\n*In that case, use a native SSH client such as the excellent PuTTY.\n\n\n*\n\n*The AWS-SSH wrapper makes using PuTTY with multiple Amazon EC2 instances much more convenient.

The slow connection speed with NFS comes from the fact that NFS by default syncs everything (i.e. accepts a small chunk of data; writes the chunk down; then acknowledges accepting the chunk); this is impractical for transferring large files. One can use the async option for that, but it can be dangerous. You can read more about optimizing NFS performance here.\nI'm not sure about the other problem, though. I don't know why your connection drops.\nHowever, and in general, for large files I'd use rsync rather than mounted shares. It is more verbose and it is easier to resume from the point where it was interrupted, and all it needs is an ssh connection.\n", "Q: Installing Starlink - what does this step mean?

Why? Because any file I create on or move to the partition is automatically marked as executable.\nThe problem is that there is no way of changing that through nautilus. I cannot uncheck the \"Allow executing file as program\" option.\nThe noexec option doesn't help, unfortunately. It only prevents nautilus from displaying the \"run\" or \"read\" dialog but doesn't change the executable flag.\nIs there any way I can fix this?\n\nA: With January's help I was able to find the following fstab options that solved my problem:\numask=0000,fmask=0111\n\nThe fstab entry for my NTFS partition is now as follows:\n#Windows-Partition\nUUID=368CEBC57807FDCD   /media/Share  ntfs  defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0000,fmask=0111    0   0\n\nSource: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/mount-ntfs-so-that-files-are-not-executable-buts-directories-are-363315/\nEdit: Changing these options also means that you will not be able to set anything to executable on your NTFS drive. In my case that's not a problem as I don't plan on storing any executables on this partition.\n\nA: The noexec option has nothing to do with the actual permissions; it's just for not allowing to run anything from that partition:\n~ $ ls -l test.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 jw jw 28 Aug 30 13:05 test.sh\n~ $ ./test.sh\nHello world\n~ $ sudo mount -o remount,noexec /home\n~ $ ./test.sh\nbash: ./test.sh: Permission denied\n~ $ ls -l test.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 jw jw 28 Aug 30 13:05 test.sh\n\nAs you see, once the partition is mounted with the noexec option, test.sh cannot be run; but the permissions themselves did not change.\nNTFS does not support the executable bit. The way that an NTFS is seen by the system and what how permissions are set depends therefore only on how it was mounted. Normally, this is done with the umask mount option. This explains also why you cannot change the permissions: there is no way to store them, because NTFS does not support them.\nUnfortunately, if you mount everything with the 'non-executable' bit, you will not be able to change into directories, because they must be executable in order to be entered. You can use the options dmask and fmask for setting default permissions separately to for directories and files on a mounted NTFS system.\n", "Q: How can i hide winmail.dat in Evolution?

I know there are many alternatives to Windows Live Messenger like Empathy, Pidgin, emesene or aMSN. However, I usually use the 'Photo Sharing' feature with my friends that is not in any chat client.\nI need to use my MSN Messenger account. So how to use Windows Live Messenger in Ubuntu? Or can I connect to WLM and use 'Photo Sharing' with any chat client for Linux?\nWould you recommend to use a virtual machine?\n\nA: You may need a VM for photo-sharing.\n\nWhy not Wine?\nWhile running in Wine is an option, the newer versions are reported as Garbage, which means they didn't install, or didn't work. You can try running version 8.5 if it still is available, but it also has issues, as it is rated Bronze. Even rated Bronze, it is very difficult to use and can cause Unity or Compiz crashes as documented here.\nWhat can I use?\nEmesene appears to have a great outlook1 but it is unable to perform photo-sharing tasks.\nFor a VM, you should use virtualbox . It is lightweight and works with many systems. Ensure you have a license to use Windows. VirtualBox has a Seamless mode which makes applications integrate with the host OS, but I have not tested such functionality yet.\nThe info about Seamless mode is courtesy of this comment by Brendan Long.\nRef:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsLiveMessenger\n\n*https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/emesene/\n\n*http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=127\n1 No Microsoft-related pun intended.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the best way to run something natively in Linux that will guarantee that all features will be supported is to run a Windows virtual machine. It is not the most convenient thing to do at first, but if you setup the file sharing between host and VM, it becomes more or less manageable.\nEdit: I see a lot suggest Wine here. The problem is, from their website it does not look that Messenger is 100% supported and even if you manage to install it, there is a chance some functions won't work (this is happened when I installed some Quicken soft; it worked, but was so pathetically slow under Wine that I switched to a VM).\nFor VMs look at VirtualBox, very easy to install and maintain.\n\nA: If you want to use the original Messenger by Microsoft you should install it using wine. A lot of windows programs run under wine but not all of them. Just try it.\n", "Q: How can I remove Compiz? I'd like some help to fix another unity issue.\nAfter last update, my system broke.\nFor example, when I execute a 'ls' command, the screen breaks and does not show anything. Sometimes, just the beggining is shown.\nHow can I fix it?\nI don't want use another X, for now...\nThanks\n\nA: Before removing Compiz you might wanto to try and reset it\n1.Press Alt + ctrl + F1\n2.Login using your username and password\n3.Reset compiz by executing gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/compiz-1\n4.Reset unity , by executing unity --reset\n5.Optionally you can reset launcher icons by executing unity --reset-icons\n6.Press Alt + ctrl + F7 to get back to login screen.

Compiz Failure. Computer has nothing to use\n\nA: You can try Ubuntu Gnome. It doesn't use Compiz and still has as much, of not more eye candy as Ubuntu.\nI have a multi boot system, and Ubuntu Gnome is one of them.\n\nA: Instead of trying to delete compiz, which will have many dependencies issues with Unity and Gnome etc, how about just going ahead to install other Window Manager?   The last time I tried to uninstall / delete Unity/compiz, I ended having to reinstall the entire OS.\nFor example:   Xubuntu:   \napt-get install xubuntu-desktop.\nOr you can try i3, awesome, lxde etc.\nAnd then at the login screen, select the appropriate windows manager - making sure you avoid Gnome, Unity or compiz.\nAfter logging in, \"ps -ef\" and you can easily verify that compiz is not running.   \n", "Q: Lots of static/crackling noises after ALSA HDA DKMS installation I am using a Samsung Chronos 7 laptop with the following sound setup:\n$ head -n 1 /proc/asound/card0/codec*\n==> /proc/asound/card0/codec#0 <== \nCodec: Realtek ALC269VC \n\n==> /proc/asound/card0/codec#3 <== \nCodec: Intel CougarPoint HDMI \n\nWith the stock ALSA that comes with Ubuntu 12.04, I do not get any sound out of the headphones when I plug them into the headphone jack. After plugging the headphones in, I have to manually use Alsamixer to increase the volume, so that the headphones become usable. I have been told that this issue is due to my sound chip not being supported in the ALSA version that ships with Precise. A similar question at AskUbuntu and the Ubuntu Community Documentation point me to the ALSA DKMS installation.\nAfter installing the dkms module of yesterday's ALSA snapshot and rebooting, the headphone issue is indeed solved. I can now plug my headphones into the jack and instantly have sound on them. However, now I have tons of static noises and crackling when playing sound in VLC player or Skype (Firefox HTML5 playback seems to be fine, unless a Skype sound interferes with it). Is there a fix for this? I tried adding the Alsa PPA and installing the latest ALSA package proper, but that didn't have any effect, only the Alsa DKMS package seems to solve the headphone issue.\n\nA: \nCrackly sound with Skype on Ubuntu\n\nOpen up “/etc/pulse/default.pa”, find “load-module module-udev-detect” and add to the end “tsched=0″, which will disable timer-based audio scheduling.

This problem is primarily affecting Intel-HDA (high definition audio) chipsets and ALSA sound drivers in regards to \"glitch-free\" PA (pulse audio).\nModify the following line in /etc/pulse/default.pa:\nChange load-module module-udev-detect to load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0\nSource and Complete Guide: UbuntuLinuxGuide.com\n", "Q: Ideal space for partition to install Ubuntu I have a 60GB Toshiba satellite Laptop with XP Pro with one partition (27 GB are used by xp and 28GB are free). I am going to create a partition (with GParted from Ubuntu 12.04 boot CD) and after that I'll install 12.04 from the same CD.\nHow much space is ideal for this partition?\n\nA: I would be inclined to give Ubuntu about 20 to 25GB max if you only have 28GB free.   \nMake sure you defragment the hard drive using Windows first.   \nThere is no need to manually partition the drive, from the Ubuntu installer select 'install alongside windows' and you will then be able to change the recommended partition size using a slider.    \n\nA: The system itself uses 5-10 GB with plenty of software installed. A 10-15GB /root partition should be sufficient for the system and software. How much you need above that is up to you and depends on what do you want to use Ubuntu for.\nNowadays, you can resize and move partitions with relative ease, so that partitioning need not to be final.\nIf I can give a one piece of advise, however, then consider creating separate partitions for /root (system and software) and /home. Although that may lead to wasting space (for example because there is space on the /root partition that you don't use), it saves a lot of hustle in the future.\n\nA: Answers for this will be very subjective.  Generally, I just split the available space, leaving at least 25G.  If you've got around 30G, just use that. \n", "Q: I can't install Ubuntu on my Dell Inspiron 15R at all I'm attempting to install Ubuntu 12.04LTS, 64bit onto a Dell Inspiron 15R laptop.

Which task is that you are trying to achieve? Are you sure you marked your phone in the proper mode? For dialing and sending/receiving sms your telephone must be in the \"Communications\" mode. Please provide this information and/or make sure your phone is in the proper mode. Remember that if your phone is being recognized as a SD, MicroSD reader or Data Connection you may receive an error in Wammu. \nBy default the majority of the mobile devices are in \"data connection mode\" which means that: once connected, the device itself is recognized as a micro sd card reader device, thus allowing you to read/write photos, videos, music and so on. For the tasks related to read the contacts, calendar, events and other cellphone related stuff, you must dive in the configuration of your cellphone (usually under \"connections\") and change its mode to \"Communications\" or whatever your cellphone allows you to. Depending on the stuff in your cellphone's software is what you will be able to do in Wammu.\nYour phone seems not to be fully supported, based on the Wammu support page for Samsung SGH-J700, whose report dates from September 5, 2008. Tested with Gammu 1.15.0\nIt also seems that no new efforts have been made since that date, so you can only expect the results mentioned in the given site, as follows:\n\nReporter Note\nSeems to work reasonably well. Can actually read SIM contacts, no phone contacts as of yet though...\n\nUnfortunately I can't give further details on that phone.

Could anyone let me know what changes I need to make to avoid dpkg to remove the directories.\n\nA: According to this post dpkg tries to remove a package\nfrom a directory which is not used by any other Debian package, thus it\nlooks empty to dpkg, but if you've placed other software under /opt it's\nnot empty on the file-system layer.\nThus, dpkg will keep going up the file system directory hierarchy until it\ndeletes all ancestors of the installation unless there is another package\nthat is also installed under an ancestor.\nTo see which packages depend on /opt:\n$ dpkg -S /opt\n\nOne solution, taken from this post, is to create a \"core-custom\" package, which will hold the /opt, and be required by all the other custom packages. You can also use that package as a meta-package to install all the regular packages you like. Not like the warning is a big deal, but the cleaner the better.\n", "Q: SSD becomes hot, disk failure warning I have a two weeks old SSD (Kingston SSDnow 64GB). Yesterday, the computer shutdown twice and after rebooting I was bombarded with disk failure warnings.\nI usually take such warnings serious (and backed up), but skeptical.

There are a couple of ways to install them. The first is to open up winetricks (which I think ships with Wine now, but if not sudo apt-get install winetricks) and find msttcorefonts and install it. The other is through the multiverse Ubuntu repos. Make sure multiverse is enabled in the package manager, then run sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts. Restart Office and Wine and see if it works.\n\n*The other guess is that it's running what can be described in layman's terms as a stripped-down browser.

I would trust in this solution better than others Can I run fsck or e2fsck when Linux file system is mounted?\n\nA: Unless you have done something unusual with your system configuration, Ubuntu will automatically run the appropriate fsck (FileSystem ChecK) command when you next reboot.  \nThe generic 'fsck' command will attempt to detect the filesystem type, or it will accept parameters specifying the type.  'e2fsck' is essentially a shortcut saying it's an ext2 filesystem. They all behave the same way and check the filesystem for errors. \nYou're correct that they can be dangerous - never run fsck on any mounted filesystem (root partition or otherwise), as it can lead to data loss.  Reboot and it will be done safely without you needing to run any commands manually. \nUpdate: The message you saw does not mean there is damage, it is just logging the preventative maintenance that will be done automatically.\n\nA: As far as I know fsck is just a wrapper around individual filesystem file system check binaries:  \n/sbin/dosfsck\n/sbin/e2fsck\n/sbin/fsck\n/sbin/fsck.cramfs\n/sbin/fsck.ext2\n/sbin/fsck.ext3\n/sbin/fsck.ext4\n/sbin/fsck.ext4dev\n/sbin/fsck.minix\n/sbin/fsck.msdos\n/sbin/fsck.nfs\n/sbin/fsck.vfat\n\ne2fsck, fsck on an ext2 volume, and fsck.ext2 should all accomplish the same thing.\n", "Q: SUDO and sound, how to make them work together Basically inside a sudo session, even one emulating another none root user (sudo -u username command) there is no sound available.\nInside a sudo session sound appears disabled.\nI need sound, how do I fix it?\n\nA: I've solved this before by running pulseaudio in \"system mode\" where it is available to all users instead of just the user running the desktop.

You should only need to do this once.\nAs I understand it, this method avoids some of the security issues of running pulseaudio in 'system mode' but, for example, the programs you run using sudo -u will still share your volume level.\nBecause we have not ticked 'Allow other machines on the LAN to discover local sound devices' or 'Don't require authentication' your sound device is not actually available to other computers on the network. This setting just allows your computer to connect to itself, you don't need to be connected to a network at all.\n\nNOTE: If you are running a transparent proxy (if you don't know, you're probably not), you have to ensure loopback TCP connections are not being redirected at the NAT level.

It just kept booting to Windows 7. \nTo solve this I realised that because e330 supports uefi the installation had detected that and chosen packages for grub as grub-efi-amd64-bin grub-efi grub-efi-amd64. Installing grub-pc resolved the issue (After running grub-install, update-grub etc stuff). Typos notwithstanding this is basically what fixed it for me when I booted up the system with rescuecd.\nsudo apt-get install grub-pc\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n\nP.S. When using the Ubuntu install CD rescue option you might not have networking because the resolv.conf file is absent.

I am a new user of Ubuntu 12.04. \nI installed Ubuntu and Windows XP, and I want to use both operating systems. When I restart or boot my PC the GRUB menu does not appear.\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: I assume you tried to install windows XP after Ubuntu installation.Windows loader will replace GRUB loader. so you need to reinstall GRUB.Provided you have not formatted Ubuntu filesystem, while installing Windows XP.\nReinstalling GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) :\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your system with UBUNTU live dvd/cd*.\n\n*Mount the partition in which UBUNTU was installed before i.e. the root partition (old).now it’s like any other normal partition.\n\n*After you mounted the partition,which has folders like boot, home, root, usr, bin, tmp. Find the mount point of root partition.It will be in /media (example: /media/disk1 or /media/234efsdfgg5dg435gh) and the device name, default name is /dev/sda .If you have more than one HD, You can find that by typing this command in terminal (applications->accessories ->terminal )“sudo blkid”. It shows all the partitions with its device name, UUID and etc.. Take only /dev/sda or /dev/sdb.\n\n*Final step is to open terminal and type this command:\nsudo<space> grub-install<space> --root-directory=/media/<mount name> <space><device name>\n\nExample : sudo  grub-install --root-directory=/media/disk1  /dev/sda\nAnd continue…. That’s all .\nRestart, you will have boot menu showing both OS.\n*choosing which cd/dvd is important because grub versions are different.Best is to use the same version live cd/dvd.use your ubuntu 12.04 live cd.\n\nA: Note that (at least on some old Ubuntu installs), if installed via USB, it may write the GRUB to the USB instead of the hard drive you've installed to.\nThis UbuntuForums thread discusses it a bit further, and oldfred's solution for how to fix it there worked for me as well:\n\nTo reinstall Grub from an active (not liveCD/DVD/USB only) system - first you need to find the Ubuntu drive (example is sdb, but make sure to use your drive and not a partition).  To find it, use   \nsudo fdisk -l\nthen, if for example it's \"/dev/sdb\", just run:  \nsudo grub-install /dev/sdb\nIf that returns any errors run:  \nsudo grub-install --recheck /dev/sdb\nsudo update-grub\nTo see what drive grub2 uses look for the line  - grub-pc/install_devices in:  \nsudo debconf-show grub-pc\nsudo grub-probe -t device /boot/grub\nTo get grub2 to remember where to reinstall on updates:  \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\nFrom there press enter through the first pages, use spacebar to choose/unchoose the drive, and enter to accept.  Again, do not choose partitions but whole drives.\n\n\nA: This did the trick for me:\n$ sudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nI changed these two:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden -> GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0 -> GRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nafter changes run\n$ sudo update-grub\n$ reboot\n\nA: Hold down the shift key during the boot process this will give you the menu on a one off basis.\nYou can also modify /etc/default/grub comment out the line by adding a # to the start like:\n# GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n\nThis will cause the grub menu to be displayed for the number of seconds in GRUB_TIMEOUT before selecting the default and booting that.\nIf you have modified this file then you need to run update-grub for it to take effect. This will automatically be run each time a new kernel is installed by sudo apt full-upgrade\nsudo update-grub\n\nEdit-Apr-25-2022: In Ubuntu 20.04.1, auto loading of grub modules causes race condition on slow PCs.

The monitor displayed \"frequency out of range\".  \nYou can test to see if this is the case by tapping the \"down arrow\" key for at least 15 seconds after the bios screen and then pressing \"enter\".\nIf Windows loads then grub is working fine, but not being displayed.\nThis can be resolved by using the 'out-of-range' option in the advanced section of boot repair or editing grub manually.  \nAccording to lines 346 to 348 of the boot info script grub should be displayed.  \n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\n\nSo using the command gksu gedit /etc/default/grub and uncommenting / removing the #hash from what appears as line 364 in the boot info script as #GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 should work.\nAfter saving the changes you will need to run sudo update-grub \nHave a look at the answers to this question for instructions on using both methods.\n\nA: I ended up here while searching for a solution for a friend who had the same problem.\nWhat eventually worked for him: hit F2 during boot to go into the BIOS settings (on some machines it's a different key, but usually F2).

Ever since I upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04 I've been having display problems. Basic symptom is that the display buffer appears corrupted. It seems to affect the alt-tab display most often - instead of seeing little pictures of the windows the boxes for the windows have garbage in them, random text and messed up images. After that it spreads to the status bar at the top of the screen and then into windows themselves - for example, Emacs will have garbage text across the top of the window and inside the buffer area. Sometimes switching to a VT and back to X will clear it, sometimes not.

Standard Ubuntu 12.04 comes with Nvidia driver 295.40 so the next solution was to upgrade.\nSolution 2: Upgrade to the latest proprietary Nvidia driver. This may solve the issue since the release notes on the Nvidia site indicates there are issues with the recent Nvidia drivers which have only just been resolved (read: there may still be some problems!). I have had no problems (up for more than 24 hours, no freezes) except occasional pixel corruption in my VMWare player window.\nThe easiest upgrade route is via the PPA mechanism since this will properly upgrade the current driver. \nJust do (from https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThe only caveat, is to remember to uninstall this PPA when you do the next distribution release upgrade:\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\n\nReal Solution: Ubuntu 12.04 should upgrade the standard Nvidia driver as part of the normal upgrade/update process rather than have users use a PPA.\n", "Q: Why can't I connect to an ad-hoc wireless network on a Windows 7 system?

The first image should be able to respond to mouse clicks.\nThe simple way would usually be to put an Image inside an EventBox - and inside the window. However, EventBox is not transparent by default, so even if the png Image itself has transparent areas, when inside the EventBox it shows as a square opaque background around the image.\nI'm aware that EventBox can be made transparent using Cairo, but so far was not able to do that.\nCan anyone provide a short C# example to make EventBox transparent?\nThanks!\n\nA: Answering my own question...:\nThe solution is so simple, while I was looking for complex code to redraw the widget...\nAll that needs to be done is to set the EventBox.VisibleWindow member to 'false' (it is 'true' by default).

I have an Intel Pentium 4 3.02 Ghz processor and 512 MB RAM, as mentioned in the title.\nP.S. Excuse me if my english is bad, but I'm from Bulgaria\n\nA: Based on the \"Minimum Hardware Requirements\" mentioned in the  \"Installation Guide\" for PowerPC, the answer is YES.\nNevertheless in the real world, a one core microprocessor with less than 1GB RAM will result in a less efficient computer \"feeling\" slow in many aspects.\nYou must consider seriously what is mentioned in the given page, specially what refers to the graphic desktop environments, as follows:\n\nThe actual minimum memory requirements are a lot less then the numbers\n  listed in this table. Depending on the architecture, it is possible to\n  install Ubuntu with as little as 20MB (for s390) to 48MB (for i386 and\n  amd64). The same goes for the disk space requirements, especially if\n  you pick and choose which applications to install; see the section\n  called “Disk Space Needed” for additional information on disk space\n  requirements.\nIt is possible to run a graphical desktop environment on older or\n  low-end systems, but in that case it is recommended to install a\n  window manager that is less resource-hungry than those of the GNOME or\n  KDE desktop environments; alternatives include xfce4, icewm and\n  wmaker, but there are others to choose from.\n\nAnyway, there are lightweight desktop environments and several distributions based on ubuntu (lxde and lubuntu comes to my mind), which makes a difference in \"speed\" at the very moment that you use the computer to do something, apart from the boot itself.\nYou must remember that the \"speed\" of a computer is a sensation. Something you \"feel\" based on several things, not only the speed of the microprocessor and RAM.\nRecapitulating:\nThe fast answer is YES, it will run. But you may expect a slow performance computer after all.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Just my 2cents:\nIf I were in your shoes I would opt for the XUbuntu official variant. It is a fully fledged Ubuntu Linux environment, without the resource hog named Unity 3d, featuring the XFCE graphical user interface in Unity's place, which is known to be notoriously lightweight.\nSome screenshots:\nApp selection:\n\nFile Manager:\n\n\nA: No - not really, performance will be poor.\nWith only 512mb RAM you would be much better off using a lighter distro such as Lubuntu or Xubuntu, see links below.  \nLubuntu \nXubuntu \n\nA: You can find the minimum system requirements for Ubuntu on this page.\nYour laptop should run Ubuntu just fine, though since 512MB is on the low end, it's possible that you may have a better experience using Unity2D as opposed to Unity3D. I doubt it will be necessary, particularly given your processor speed, but if you find that even Unity2D is slower than you would like, you could also try using a more lightweight Desktop Environment such as LXDE or XFCE.\n\nA: I have recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a machine with 512 MB RAM and it run pretty well.\nAlthough the performance was pretty decent while using it with default set of preinstalled software (I didn't launch any server applications or stuff like that) I had around 20 MB of free RAM after boot.\nSo, unless you need it to be really snappy and fast (or use it for some extra apps like: SQL , WWW server ) you should be alright - without a \"WOW that's fast\" :)\n\nA: I suggest you to download the alternate, text-based installer of Ubuntu. This will avoid problems during the installation due to little memory.\nAlso, you may want to have a look at Lubuntu, a very light version of Ubuntu. I personally didn't have a good experience with that distribution, but you can try it.

Is this bad and how do I tell the BIOS to stop it?\nBackground:\nI have an old Dell GX280 dual Pentium 4 that I (semi) resurrected last weekend with an installation of Ubuntu 12.04.  Everything was going fine the first several hours until a problem that plagued me when WinXP was on that machine happened -- it froze.  Completely froze.  None of the myriad of ways I have found here on askubuntu helped me to regain control except a long-press of the power button to shut it off.  Clearly, this wasn't a software/WinXP issue.\nAfter much googling, I found that hardware conflicts can often cause this sort of total lock-up and with all the odd blocks of yellow and flecks of color showing on my screen (both WinXP and Ubuntu) I figured my old GeForce 7600 was failing and causing me these odd issues.  (A good canned-air dusting of the entire interior fixed the color fleck problem)\nAgain, through much googling and numerous answers found on askubuntu, I somehow stumbled my way onto the lshw command.  After going through it, line by line, I found that I have four devices sharing IRQ 16: eth0, wlan0, ide0 (DVD-RW), and my video card.  In hindsight, I can recall weird instances of my Ethernet connection to another computer not working when I thought it should.  I never full troubleshot those issues so it could be a coincidence.  \nThe other thing that has been plaguing me since installing Ubuntu (wasn't there during WinXP) has been periodic moments of my monitor getting no signal from Ubuntu during boot.  The first couple days, it would disappear after the Dell boot screen and reappear at Ubuntu login.  Now, it disappears after the Dell boot screen and doesn't return at all -- I have to hit F12 where I can load a safe mode version of Ubuntu and get more details like dmesg and lsdev.  I also ran memtest86 overnight and woke up to zero errors, so failing RAM is out.\nWhere do I go from here?\n\nUpdate, 3 Sept\nSo, the below measures did not work.  The machine still froze up some time Saturday morning, so I completely excised the video card from the system and plugged the monitor into the good old onboard VGA port.  It's been 2 and a half days with no freezes.  No big deal, not having the 3D card, I suppose.  I wasn't planning on gaming with Ubuntu, anyway.  Thanks for all the help and my apologies for posting on the wrong board.  Also, I'm not sure how to \"reclaim\" my original questioned account, so I can't mark the question as resolved.\n\nThank you, ImaginaryRobots and Steve Kroon.  \nI went back to the BIOS screen and expanded every single menu, but could find nowhere to edit IRQ settings.  IRQ was mentioned only twice as info about a particular device (I don't remember which) but was not a writable piece of information.  \nWhile I was in the BIOS settings, I did tell it to use the onboard video controller(?) instead of the one on my GeForce card.  I expected to have to plug the monitor into the VGA port, instead of the DVI one on the video card (w/adapter), but the machine booted normally without a plug change, which I still find odd.  \nAs of this morning, it has been about 10 hours with no freeze-up.  I will wait out the weekend to see if it behaves itself and come back later to report.  \nThank you for the link, Steve.  The panic surrounding my shared IRQs has been dispelled and my focus is back on the video card.\n\nA: You likely need to fix the IRQ assignments in your BIOS settings.  If at all possible, set it to \"automatic\", since you shouldn't have to manually set them on hardware made this millenium.  \nHere's a screenshot from a different Dell machine:\nhttp://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/extras/w/wiki/bios-irq-screen-shot.aspx\n\nA: Shared IRQs are by no means unusual.  Sometimes it can cause problems, but it is fairly standard practice nowadays for multiple devices to share a single IRQ.  (For example, see the section \"Shared IRQ’s – a typical PC solution\" at http://karbosguide.com/books/pcarchitecture/chapter40.htm .\nSo this might be your problem, but just because there are devices sharing an IRQ does not mean there is a problem.\n", "Q: ATI Radeon 4200 has graphics and performance issue; how to rectify? I have a ATI Radeon 4200 graphics card. When ever I launch runescape the graphics tear and get shifted all over the place. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: Your card is no longer supported by AMD in the latest catalyst driver. Sadly you won't be able to install a older driver either. It wont support the current X Display server on Ubuntu 12.04. You would find better performance by removing the driver by going to your \"additional drivers\" menu in your system settings, then clicking remove.\nI hate to say this your Ubuntu experience wouldn't be that great on that machine. You would need to upgrade to a newer machine to see Ubuntu in it's true colors. I would recommend any of the Core series from Intel, with a Nvidia Geforce 500 series graphics card. \nHope this helps! Cheers :)\n", "Q: How do I refresh software sources after adding a PPA I'm looking to learn a new way to update sources without having to revert to the terminal or the software updater. When I'm trying to explain how to add a PPA to new users it sounds really silly having to do that.\nThe Ubuntu Software Center does auto update, but a few minutes \"after\" adding the PPA. Is there a way to click a button to refresh that instant?\n\nA: First I want to declared that the easy, good, recommended, etc. way to do this is  sudo apt-get update.  Also you can enter sudo add-apt-repository ppa:the_name_of_ppa &&  sudo apt-get update to add the PPA and update at the same time.  \nThen the answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Update-Manager from the dash\n\nor use the gear icon on the Unity Bar, the menu selection you need will be the fourth one down, it will either say Software Up to Date or Updates Available (depending on if you have all your software up to date or not) here is a screen shot from my Desktop with all software up to date:\n\n\n*Either way you open it, now you should see the main window, then click on the Check button\n\n\nA: You could set up something with the cron command to run sudo apt-get update every minute or so, but I suspect that's not what you want.\n", "Q: Don't have sound in 12.04 I don't have sound even though I have got the latest updates, installed the driver for the graphics card, installed alsa mixer which there was some mute but didn't do anything. What is wrong?\n\nA: If you are using HDMI make sure you have the HDMI audio selected in your sound settings. I had the same issue with my Nvidia Geforce GTX 550 TI at first. Then I selected HDMI/Display port 2 and it works.\n", "Q: How to prevent suspension when a program is currently running? Is there any way to make Ubuntu 12.04 understand when it should suspend or not in terms of the software that is currently running?\nFor example, if I am installing something and it takes more than 10 minutes, which is the time limit for my PC to suspend, then I do not want my system to system to suspend till the installation of the program is finished. If my system is inactive I want it to suspend,but on the other hand if something is running I do not want to suspend.\n\nA: A relatively simple way to do it is by installing a program called caffeine. You'll need to add the repository then install it. For example, via the terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install caffeine && sudo apt-get install gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 gir1.2-notify-0.7\n\n(N.B. you'll need gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 and gir1.2-notify-0.7 at the moment due to a bug in defining its dependencies.)\nOnce you have it installed and running, it should create an entry in the menubar or panel. You can manually prevent suspension, or set caffeine to activate automatically based on what processes are running. In your case, you can whitelist the installation program, such as apt-get. (I'm not sure what that is specifically, since you didn't provide the details.)\n\nN.B. I'm using Kubuntu, where it works well. It should also work in Unity.\n\nUpdate\nNew versions of caffeine have been crippled, and much of this functionality has been removed.. I think the old version (2.5) still works, though, so you can try that.\n\nA: How to disabled the Suspend function, even if a program is running or not:\nYou have to goto the System Configuration and then click on Energy option. Now you should see an image similar than this one:\n\nThen you will see the option called Suspend when inactive for and put this one on Don't Suspend, as you see on the previously image.\n\nA: I do solve such things automating keyboard or mouse with xdotool package, using it in a dead-simple loop inside a terminal.\nIs known that there are other software alternatives that send keyboard key F13 as non-intrusive alternative because that key exists but is not truly present for us.\nYou can send relative mouse movement with 0 values, so the input is sent, but the mouse is not perturbed.\nwhile true; do xdotool mousemove_relative 0 0 && sleep 30; done\n\nIn short, what keeps your computer \"alive\" is the INPUT events.\n", "Q: Easytether .deb won't install due to errors I am running Ubuntu 12.4 64amd.

I zwitched on Desktop from Mutt to Evolution to some extent. Now I cannot find my sent emails so where are the sent -emails when they are sent with Evolution -email-program?\n\nA: It depends on multiple issues. The word Evolution is a bit red-herring, the same politics works over different devices -- more here with Android -- of course the UI is different with Evolution, go to Edit > Preferences > Sending Email > Defaults > Sent.\nIMAP or POP3?\n\nIf you use IMAP and multiple devices, please, note that your settings must correspond to each other over every email-client -- more here. If you use some Online-email-client, you must make sure its settinsg are correct -- for example, Gmail Labels set to invisible makes also your Evolution Sent emails invisible. If your server-side email-client such as mutt has a wrong record -field, it means every IMAP email-client will malfunction. If your Gmail filters has some odd Delete It, it may delete all of your sent -emails -- also a possible reason why IMAP -mailbox may not work.\nNow POP3 is much simpler. It just directs every email to different mailboxes, meaning you need to replicate your work over multiple devices -- driving you mad if you have many email-clients like me: mutt in Server, Evolution in Desktop, K9 in Android, iOS email in iPad etc. But the good side is that the settings between different email-clients won't intercept one another the way they do with IMAP -configured mailboxes.\n\nPerhaps useful\n\n  \n*\n  \n*https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/29065/email-client-with-sent-emails-from-many-emails-under-imap\n  \n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63537/how-can-i-specify-the-sent-folder-for-gmail-on-ipad\n\n", "Q: How do I uninstall Dropbox?

So I noticed this Onlive Universal controller thing, that costs like 50 bucks, but is very well made.\nHowever I want to know if it works...\n\nA: For modern games, the Xbox360 controller is your best option, as it's the best controller out there and reasonably well supported right out of the box. If you need more configurability, you can use xboxdrv instead of the build in kernel driver. The wired USB version is also pretty cheap. \nThe Dualshock can work over USB instead of Bluetooth. Support for it is however a bit flunky, as each button on the thing is reported as both axis and key event, which confuses most games. xboxdrv should however be able help with that, Qtsixa might as well. \nAs for the OnLive controller, no idea.

It uses ssh for data transfer and uses the same authentication and provides the same security as ssh (see scp manpage). By default, ssh uses port 22. So unless you changed the default port number for ssh on the destination server to 21, or you have not installed and started the ssh server (sshd) on the receiving server, you can not use scp to copy files.\n2) The proper command line from your example should be:\nscp -P '*port running ssh on destination server*' /home/direc/file.tar username@remotehost:/home/dir\n\nThe first root@myhost is not necessary and will in fact attempt to copy a file named root@myhost (that most likely does not exist) and file.tar to the destination server. You most likely will receive the message:\nroot@myhost: No such file or directory during the copy.\n\n\nA: Try \nscp -P 21 root@myhost /home/direc/file.tar username@secondhost:/home/dir\n\nWhere -P stands for port number. \n", "Q: Are X.04 releases generally more stable than X.10 releases? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat's the meaning of version numbering of ubuntu? \n\nI just noticed there are always two versions of Ubuntu, X.04 and X.10. Which is the best? Is it really that X.04 are more stable BUT with less applications?\nI have 12.04 and 11.10 but 12.04 keeps logging me off. Should I rather wait for the 12.10?\nPlease say the differences between a X.04 and a X.10 version.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 codenamed Precise Pangolin is now the latest stable version of Ubuntu. Also note that Ubuntu releases its each version after considerable testing to make sure it is stable enough for normal use.\nSo every version whether it is x.04 or x.10 can be considered stable enough for daily usage. Coming to your question, Ubuntu 12.04 is stable. You can use it without worry.\n\nA: 12.04 LTS is the most recent version of the system in its long term support (LTS, X.04 numbers) version, which is intended to be more stable than the (pseudo) running releases (X.10 numbers, current one is 11.10?).\nThe basic difference between the two families is that during their lifecycle, LTS versions only get security fixes, whereas x.10 versions get the upgrades including feature improvements. LTS versions can be viewed as \"snaphots\" of the features available and stable at the date of their release. Also, LTS versions are released only every 2 years, while .10 versions get a major release every 6 months: stability is the priority in the LTS versions, taking precedence over the ability to stay up-to-date with respect to new features.\nHowever, since the LTS and other major versions are defined by their release date and not by a feature stability evaluation (different policy than Debian, for instance), there is no actual guarantee than 12.04 is \"more stable\" than 10.04 or than a more recent 12.10. And actually, many people seem to have complained about stability issues or feature regressions since they upgraded to 12.04.\nMy personal opinion, and it is only an opinion, is that 10.04 (the previous LTS) is very stable and reliable. It lacks the most recent versions of the programs, but I observe less problems in production than with 12.04 installations.\n\nA: 12.04.1 LTS is the most stable and recent version. Since 12.10 is still in developement, it cannont be stable. Also, 12.04.1 LTS is a more refined form of 12.04, so it's more stable.\n\nA: People are dithering around the issue but somebody needs to say this:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no* correlation of stability between and 04/10 releases.\n\n*LTS releases are always 04 but only every other year (8.04, 10.04, 12.04, 14.04, ..).\n\n*LTS doesn't mean* it'll work immediately - it's just supported for longer.\n\n\n*It is supposed to be more stable. It's based of a more \"stable\" Debian release and the targets for the release usually focus more on compatibility and stability than performance or features - but as the last LTS shows, good intentions don't always mean you get what you want.\nEdit: That last sentiment sounds bitter. 12.04 isn't terrible but as you can quickly see from the front page, it's still not without issues.\n", "Q: How do I enable week numbers in calendar applet when settings are missing?

This tool is available from the repositories. An updated version and good support can be obtained from the project's page with sourceforge.\nWhen installing the DEB package from the repositories the application can be run by\nsudo service minidlna start\n\nusing its default configuration file /etc/minidlna.conf. This file needs to be edited for defining media directories, database cache directory, and network properties. Scanning your media for changes in content will be done in defined intervals but you can also force a rescan at any time with:\nsudo service minidlna stop\nsudo minidlna -R\n\nScanning of the media for building the database may take quite a long time with large libraries or huge files. Once done it runs quite stable in the background. You can also define an upstart script to run on boot.\nSettings for the init script can be made in /etc/defaults/minidlna. This is especially helpful when we want to run MiniDLNA as a certain user (e.g. when the database is stored in a HOME directory).\nSee also: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MiniDLNA on how to run minidlna from userspace.

This step will allow you to sync multiple instances - transfer of the authentication data between computers which you use with your Google account.\nTo add an authentication key: First click here to open a demo barcode in your browser. Then follow next steps for: Scan QR code or Manual entry. If the barcode is not generated by some Google application, for most cases you must use only Manual entry. If the authentication code is time based you must use Sync Clock with Google function.\nTo use the application, just click on the Authenticator icon. Wait for the beginning of a new cycle.

So I cut-pasted all my required files and folders in my E drive. Then I decided to not to have a fresh install and just let it be. \nLater, when I booted up in Windows (dual-boot with 12.04 and Windows 7), I found that the files and folders I had cut-pasted from my home account in Ubuntu are just not there.\nWhat is even more surprising is that now, when I am back on Ubuntu, those files and folders that should have been there in my E drive are also not there.\nIs it an Ubuntu issue or a hard drive issue?  \n\nA: The problem is with hibernating Windows. If you start Windows it reads filetable of partition (your drive E:). Then when you let Windows hibernate, it has this filetable in memory and writes the memory to hiberfile. When you open Ubuntu, add files and then wake up Windows, it loads into memory the state before hibernate from hiberfile along with old filetable without these files. On Windows shutdown, filetable is rewritten by old one, so the files appear missing. \nDo not write anything on that partition/drive and try some recovery software to get files back.\n", "Q: Is it possible to lose some directories when upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04?

Is there any way to make a windows installer of some kind, or will i have to hold their hand as they try to install the various libraries etc? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: GTK3 is the hard bit... I'll get to that in a second...\nWrapping up a Python project for Windows is actually quite easy if you use something like py2exe or pyinstaller. There are also commercial options out there but it's been such a long time I can't remember their names.\nEither way, you end up an entire Python environment with everything you need baked in. The user just runs it.\nNow back to the toolkit. GTK3 can be installed on Windows but it's not a thriving or mature cross-platform toolkit.  There are some questions about this on StackOverflow but I don't know what bindings they provide. They're probably not suitable for Python but I hope I'm wrong. In short - you probably don't want to be using GTK3 for a cross-platform application.\nPast that, you're left looking for an alternative.

The plugin is a wrapper around the dh_make command. You\n  should already have these if you installed packaging-dev Run the\n  command providing the package name, version number, and path to the\n  upstream tarball:\n\n$ sudo apt-get install dh-make\n$ cd ..\n$ bzr dh-make hello 2.7 hello-2.7.tar.gz\n\n\nWhen it asks what type of package type s for single binary. This will\n  import the code into a branch and add the debian/ packaging directory.\n  Have a look at the contents. Most of the files it adds are only needed\n  for specialist packages (such as Emacs modules) so you can start by\n  removing the optional example files:\n\n$ cd hello/debian\n$ rm *ex *EX\n\n\nYou should now customise each of the files.\nIn debian/changelog change the version number to an Ubuntu version:\n  2.7-0ubuntu1 (upstream version 2.7, Debian version 0, Ubuntu version 1). Also change unstable to the current development Ubuntu release\n  such as precise.\nMuch of the package building work is done by a series of scripts\n  called debhelper. The exact behaviour of debhelper changes with new\n  major versions, the compat file instructs debhelper which version to\n  act as. You will generally want to set this to the most recent version\n  which is 8.\ncontrol contains all the metadata of the package. The first paragraph\n  describes the source package. The second and and following paragraphs\n  describe the binary packages to be built. We will need to add the\n  packages needed to compile the application to Build-Depends:. For\n  hello, make sure that it includes at least:\nBuild-Depends: debhelper (>= 8.0.0) You will also need to fill in a\n  description of the program in the Description: field.\ncopyright needs to be filled in to follow the licence of the upstream\n  source. According to the hello/COPYING file this is GNU GPL 3 or\n  later.\ndocs contains any upstream documentation files you think should be\n  included in the final package.\nREADME.source and README.Debian are only needed if your package has\n  any non-standard features, we don’t so you can delete them.\nsource/format can be left as is, this describes the version format of\n  the source package and should be 3.0 (quilt).\nrules is the most complex file. This is a Makefile which compiles the\n  code and turns it into a binary package. Fortunately most of the work\n  is automatically done these days by debhelper 7 so the universal %\n  Makefile target just runs the dh script which will run everything\n  needed.\nAll of these file are explained in more detail in the overview of the\n  debian directory article.\nFinally commit the code to your packaging branch:\n\n$ bzr commit -m \"Initial commit of Debian packaging.\"\n\nBuilding the package\n\nNow we need to check that our packaging successfully compiles the\n  package and builds the .deb binary package:\n\n$ bzr builddeb -- -us -uc\n$ cd ../../\n\n\nbzr builddeb is a command to build the package in its current\n  location.

I understand that the applications have to result into the Ubuntu Software Center, but I find that anything more than 3 days is excessive. 9 have passed.\nAny announcements yet?\n\nA: We will announce the winners as soon as they are ready to be published in the Software Center.\nVote was closed on the 29th and the votes have been counted already. It just takes some time to do the technical review, fixes (if necessary) and developer communication to get the winner's apps into the Software Center.\nWe are aware that this process causes unwanted delays, and we're actively working towards improving it. If you are interested, we're also soon going to announce a proposal for a more streamlined process for 3rd party apps to be published.\n\nNote: Essentially, @Tom Brossman's answer is correct, as we're going to announce them as soon as possible. But note that as mentioned in the community vote start blog post, we decided to start the vote without blocking on all apps having gotten into the Software Center. This means that we're not using the public ratings and reviews Software Center API (but the results will be equally public).\n\nA: Soon, but that's not the answer you are looking for.

I am not advanced in linux so I am a little confused. Whenever I attempt to install ubuntu from the CD, I get all the way to the point where it asks me to partition my drive. On the basic level there is a 2 sided bar that can be dragged back and forth to select how many GB you wish. My question is: Which side of the 2 bars is the ubuntu side, and which side is the Windows 7 side? There is no way to differentiate between the 2 bars. I suspect the ubuntu side is the right side, because its default setting is a lower GB amount than the left side; but I can't be sure, and I do not want to screw up my windows partition. \n\nA: Well yes, normally Ubuntu should be at the smaller side.

When I pull out manually it shows some curruption occurred.\nWhat is the correct way to create a LiveDVD or LiveUSB for upgrading my previous version. And what is the method to Upgrade with this LiveDVD or USB.\nThanks.\n\nA: Well, you should check your MD5SUM of the iso image to see if it is a corrupted download. See HowToMD5Sum. Use UNetbootin to burn the ISO image. If you're using a CD/DVD, use a slower burn speed. However if you are to upgrade, use an alternate image and mount it, or just use the update manager, or use sudo do-release-upgrade in terminal.\n\nA: Recently I have made several CD and all of them became corrupted.

I've imported a .db file from my android device and I wish to open it using Libreoffice Base or something similarly basic with a simple GUI.\nHow do I achieve this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Install SQLite browser, it's in the repositories. (Source)\n\n*There's also an extension for Firefox (if you use it): SQLite Manager\nA list of tools that can manage those files can be found here.\n\nA: From the output of the 'file' command in the comment above I can see that it's an sqlite3 database so all you have to do is open it with the sqlite3 command and export it to CSV.  Run the following command:\nsqlite3 bookCatalogueDbExport.db\n\nYou should see a prompt like this:\nsqlite>\n\nIf you get an error about \"command not found\" you'll need to install sqlite3:\nsudo apt-get install sqlite3\n\nVerify that sqlite3 can read the database by listing the tables:\nsqlite> .tables\nbooks\n\nIf you get an error at this point the database is probably encrypted or isn't actually SQLite format (the file command can make mistakes sometimes).  If it lists the tables in the .db then you're good to go.  Just tell sqlite3 the format you want and have it output all the data:\nsqlite> .mode list\nsqlite> .separator , -- Comma-Separated (aka CSV)\nsqlite> .output books.csv -- Where to save the file\nsqlite> select * from books; -- Replace 'books' with the actual table name\nsqlite> .exit\n\nNow you should have a file named books.csv that you can open directly with LibreOffice Calc.\nNote that sqlite databases can have more than one table.  If this is the case you'll want to output each table as its own file.  So instead of typing '.exit' above you can continue the process like so:\nsqlite> .output some_other_table.csv -- Give it a different name\nsqlite> select * from some_other_table; -- Replace 'books' with the actual table name\nsqlite> .exit -- When done exporting all the tables\n\nFinally, to be as thorough as possible, here's a link to the sqlite syntax in case you want to play around with it some more:\nhttp://www.sqlite.org/lang.html\n\nA: What type of database file is it? The .db extension is not specific to a certain type of database. Though, coming from Android, I presume it's an sqlite database.

I would like to use it instead of fdisk.\nWould someone please provide the name of the executable?\n\nA: I believe, the package responsible for doing installation and hence the partitioning stuff is ubiquity. \nIt's dependency includes libparted0debian1 package which provides the main library doing the partitioning stuff.

See man parted for documentation about how to use it directly from the command-line. You will, of course, have to run it as root (sudo parted).\n\nA: parted is the backend generally used by most of the partitioners used on linux - You can find the manpage for it here. The manual I see seems to state that ext3 support dosen't work, but you'd want to check that with the manpage on the same distro. \nIf you're working with lvms you'd also need pvcreate to create the volumes, vgcreate to create the volume group, and lvcreate to create the logical volume - there's a howto here and elsewhere - neither parted nor fdisk will do that.\n", "Q: Rename localhost folder.

If the proprietary AMD Catalyst drivers were in use, \"radeon\" would be replaced with \"fglrx\".\nIf you would like to install the proprietary AMD Catalyst drivers (which would certainly improve your FPS), you can do so by following the directions here. Please note that although two more recent versions of the Catalyst driver have been released since these directions were written, the RadeonHD 3400 series is no longer supported under these newer versions, so you will have to stick with 12.4. Additionally, in order for this driver to work properly with your card, you will need to be running kernel 3.2 or below and Xserver 1.11 or below (see this page for more information)\n\nA: The most easy way to do that. Open \"System Settings\" > Details > Overview > the string \"Graphics\". If you see the word \"Gallium\" there then it means you use a free driver with 3d support.

What are the default mounting options for a non root partition ?\nThe man entry for mount says ...\ndefaults - use default options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async.\n\n... so that might be what we expect to see. But, unless I'm missing something, that's not what happens.\nI have an ext3 partition labelled \"NewHome20G\" which is seen as /dev/sdc6 by the system. This we can see from ...\nroot@john-pc1204:~# blkid | grep NewHome20G\n/dev/sdc6: LABEL=\"NewHome20G\" UUID=\"d024bad5-906c-46c0-b7d4-812daf2c9628\" TYPE=\"ext3\" \n\nI have an entry in fstab as follows ...\nroot@john-pc1204:~# cat /etc/fstab | grep NewHome\nLABEL=NewHome20G        /media/NewHome20G        ext3         rw,nosuid,nodev,exec,users     0  2\n\nNote the option settings that are specified in that fstab line.\nNow I look at how the partition is actually mounted after boot up ... \nroot@john-pc1204:~# mount -l | grep sdc6\n/dev/sdc6 on /media/NewHome20G type ext3 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev) [NewHome20G]\n\n... so, when the filesystem gets mounted the exec & users options I specified seem to have been ignored.\nJust to be sure, I unmount sdc6, remount it and look at the mount options again ...\nroot@john-pc1204:~# umount /dev/sdc6\nroot@john-pc1204:~# mount /dev/sdc6\nroot@john-pc1204:~# mount -l | grep sdc6\n/dev/sdc6 on /media/NewHome20G type ext3 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev) [NewHome20G]\n\n.... same result\nNow I unmount the partition again, remount it specifying the exec option and look at the result ...\nroot@john-pc1204:~# umount /dev/sdc6\nroot@john-pc1204:~# mount /dev/sdc6 -o exec\nroot@john-pc1204:~# mount -l | grep sdc6\n/dev/sdc6 on /media/NewHome20G type ext3 (rw,nosuid,nodev) [NewHome20G]\n\n... and here the exec option has finally taken effect and the noexec setting has vanished.\nJust for interest, I re-mount the partition with the defaults option\nroot@john-pc1204:~# umount /dev/sdc6\nroot@john-pc1204:~# mount /dev/sdc6 -o defaults\nroot@john-pc1204:~# mount -l | grep sdc6\n/dev/sdc6 on /media/NewHome20G type ext3 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev) [NewHome20G]\n\nThe noexec is back, so it looks very like rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev are the default options which is NOT what man says.\nWhy does this matter ? \nI have a folder full of useful scripts stored on a data disk. Because that disk is mounted noexec \nthose scripts won't run, even though they have all been set with chmod 777. I can work round this in several ways but it's disappointing that the man entry seems to be wrong. \nHave I missed something obvious here or have the default options in Ubuntu changed from what they were a few versions ago ? \n\nA: The manual is correct. Your issue is that perhaps you didn't account for 3 important details:\n\n\n*\n\n*users (and user) implies the options noexec, nosuid, and  nodev\n\n*Unless overridden  by subsequent options\n\n*Options order matters ;)\nSo when you use rw,nosuid,nodev,exec,users in your fstab, the last option, users, sets noexec,nosuid,nodev, thus disabling your exec (and also making your nosuid,nodev redundant).\nThe result, as expected, is rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev.\nAnd no, users was not ignored, it just doesn't usually show in mount listing output. But any user can unmount it and mount it back again. Try it!\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ mount /dev/sda6                     # ordinary user\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ mount | grep /dev/sda6\n/dev/sda6 on /mnt/mint10 type ext4 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ /mnt/mint10/bin/echo it works       # noexec will deny this\nbash: /mnt/mint10/bin/echo: Permission denied\n\nmount will only show something related to user if user (not users) is used, and an ordinary, non-root user mounts it, like this:\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ mount /dev/sda6         # ordinary user\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ mount | grep /dev/sda6  # it will list current \"owner\"\n/dev/sda6 on /mnt/mint10 type ext4 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,user=rodrigo)\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ umount /dev/sda6\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ sudo mount /dev/sda6\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ mount | grep /dev/sda6  # since owner=root, it won't show\n/dev/sda6 on /mnt/mint10 type ext4 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ umount /dev/sda6        # only mounter can unmount\numount: only root can unmount LABEL=MINT10 from /mnt/mint10\n\nAlso notice that, when using user without noauto, the partition will be automounted (by root) on boot. So until root unmounts it, no one will be able to unmount or (re-)mount.\nThat said, I guess you already figured out your solution: simply change the order of your options and everything will work fine:\nLABEL=NewHome20G  /media/NewHome20G  ext3  users,exec  0  2\n\nNotice how exec is after users. And also rw,nosuid,nodev is not necessary. rw is already a default, and the others are automatically turned on by users\nAnd the result is:\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ mount /dev/sda6                  # user mount\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ mount | grep /dev/sda6\n/dev/sda6 on /mnt/mint10 type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev)\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ /mnt/mint10/bin/echo it works    # exec works\nit works\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ sudo umount /dev/sda6            # root unmount\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ sudo mount /dev/sda6             # root mount\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ mount | grep /dev/sda6\n/dev/sda6 on /mnt/mint10 type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev)\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $ umount /dev/sda6                 # user unmount\nrodrigo@desktop ~ $\n\nMeaning any user, root or non-root, can mount and unmount it, regardless of who previously mounted or unmounted it. And executables works too :)\n", "Q: Are there \"portable\" versions of Opera for Linux/Ubuntu? I want to use the latest Opera  browser, but v12 does not have opera-unite anymore.

[y/N] \n\nClearly the MBR table is damaged or mismatched. But it does not reflect the correct GPT table partitions at all. How do I get the MBR repaired to match the GPT table (up to the 4 part limit of course)?\nThe question is simply - Do I blindly say Yes to gptsync's suggestion? It looks sort of ok but not exactly so...Advice please on interpreting the above output to get my disk usable would be greatly appreciated.\nThank You!\n\nA: Technically, no hybrid MBR is OK; hybrid MBRs are a clear violation of the GPT specification. Whoever invented them should be ashamed of him/herself. Unfortunately, they're a practical necessity for dual-booting OS X and Windows on Macs. (That may change with Windows 8, though.)\nThat said, within the usual informal rules for a hybrid MBR, the one that gptsync is suggesting is OK. My suspicion is you think it's not OK because the first partition (of type \"ee\") doesn't match any of your GPT partitions. This is not only fine, it's necessary; the type-0xEE partition is the protective partition, which is required to identify the disk as a GPT disk. It's not really a partition definition, in the sense that it does not point to an area of the disk that can be used to hold filesystems or whatnot. On a standards-compliant GPT disk, this partition spans the entire disk (except for the MBR itself) and exists to keep GPT-unaware tools from messing with the disk. On a hybrid MBR, this partition is reduced in size, often dramatically, and up to three \"real\" GPT partitions are added to the MBR table.\nAs to whether you should accept this partition table, I'm not sure; that depends on what partitions Windows needs to be able to access. If Windows only needs to access /dev/sda3 (in GPT; /dev/sda4 in the proposed hybrid MBR), then it should work OK as-is. If Windows needs to access any later partition(s), though, you may need to get more creative. You can do this with gdisk (part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu) by using the h option on the recovery & transformation menu. The details appear in the gdisk Web-based documentation.\n", "Q: Burning a CD keeping original timestamps for files Is it possible to do what is summarized in the title?

Anywho, to install, just search the Ubuntu Software Center for K3B, or:\nsudo apt-get install k3b\n\nTo make sure it keeps the timestamps, after you create the CD/ISO and click Burn, then Click the Filesystem tab, then the Custom button.\n\nThen check the \"Preserve file permissions (backup)\" checkbox.\n\nThat's it.\n\nA: I think you would have to archive said files inside a .tar file so that all the file data is kept intact and then burn the .tar file to a CD/DVD. You will be able to open the .tar file using the archive manager and use files as normal.\n", "Q: How to install last version of Opera without losing opera-unite? Opera unite is a feature in the Opera browser that was abandoned in Opera 12. \nIn Windows, keeping Opera 11 and installing v12 on top of it, or upgrading, opera-unite stays into the browser.\nIn Ubuntu, by installing the v12 deb or by upgrading to v12 after adding it to software sources (like this), opera-unite is lost.\nIs there a way of upgrading to v12 without losing opera unite, like I was able to do in Windows? \n\nA: It seems that the simple way is just to use the last version of Opera (that does not have opera unite) and in parallel to use a \"portable\" Opera 11. That is, download the tar.gz file of Opera 11 (here), extract into any directory, and execute opera.shell file. Of course, a shortcut (launcher,etc) could be added on the desktop or to menus. In Lubuntu, editing the opera.desktop.file, the menu  would look like this:\n\nOf course, the solution (like the question) is limited to the period in which the server for opera-unite will still work.

Paste this into this file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Easytether\nExec=easytether connect\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\n\nand save! You will then need to make the file executable, by editing the properties of the file, or running: chmod +x easytether.desktop.\n\n*\n\n*The Name=Easytether line specifies the name of the shortcut that will appear to the user.\n\n\n*The Exec=easytether connect line specifies the command to be run, in this case, easytether connect.\n\n\n*The Terminal=true line specifies that the command should be run in GNOME Terminal, so that the user can inspect its output. You can later set this to false if you don't want the shortcut to open a Terminal window. For instance, if you made a shortcut to the \"sound\" panel of the \"settings\" and want it to only open that (the command would be \"gnome-control-center sound\").\n\n\n*You can even add a line Icon=path/to/png/ (or Icon=iconname and put your iconname.png in ~.local/share/icons) in order to add a custom icon to your launcher.\nAlso, you can put the easytether.desktop file into ~/.local/share/applications and start it from Dash or other app-launcher (Synapse, Kickoff, Slingshot etc).\n\nA: The easiest way, that is also useful in other platforms, would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click->Create new document->Empty document\n\n*Call it howeverYouWant.sh\n\n*Open it, and edit it writing in each line each line you'd use in the terminal, ergo: \"easytether connect\"\n\n*Right click it->Properties->Permissions->Allow executing\n\n*Double click the file, and choose Run in terminal\n\n\nA: Right click desktop and choose create Launcher.\nEnter this in the command:\nexo-open --launch TerminalEmulator\n\nSave it with a name and icon of your choice, and do NOT select \"Run in terminal\"\n\nA: Kudos to efaj, whose answer got me halfway there.

I'm writing an Ubuntu package for a package which essentially provides a number of libraries and headers which then be used to build other software. The package also breaks up in smaller subpackages which are interdependent; in this sense the package is quite similar to boost.\nI noticed that packages like boost provide\n[...]\nlibboost-dbg\nlibboost-dev\nlibboost-doc\n[...]\nlibboost-all-dev\n[...]\n\nbut nothing that goes by the name boost or libboost.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the idea behind this?\n\n*What are the purposes of the -dbg, -dev, and -doc packages?\n\n*Are there any instructions provided on how to write build files for those packages?\n\n\nA: Idea & Purpose\nThe main reason for separating out these different packages has to do with disk space and download speed. In particular, it is a big concern for mirror space since it means distributing multiple copies of the data. By making the foo-common, foo-data, or  foo-doc packages Architecture: all, we only keep one copy of of the data in the archive instead of having it copied with each architecture (e.g. i386, amd64, ect...). Debugging symbols are not needed by most users and just end up making the package download take longer.\nFor packages in the official Ubuntu archives, there is actually no reason to create -dbg packages manually. The build machines automatically strip out the debugging symbols and put them into -dbgsym packages hosted on ddebs.ubuntu.com. (See: Debug Symbol Packages) -dbg packages that do exist are usually simply carried over from Debian.\nInstructions\nAs for implementation, take a look at this question: \n\n\n*\n\n*How to have Debian packaging generate two packages given an upstream source archive?\nBriefly, new stanzas need to be created in debian/control for each package. Then debian/foo-*.install files need to be created as well. This will allow dh_install to put the right contents into the right packages.\nThe foo.install for the main binary package might look like:\nusr/bin/\nusr/lib/\n\nfoo-common.install, foo-data.install, foo-doc.install, or whatever:\n/usr/share/doc/\n/usr/share/icons/\n/usr/share/foo/\n/usr/share/locale/\n\nAnd for foo-dev:\n/usr/include/\n/usr/lib/pkgconfig\n/usr/lib/*.so\n\nCreating the foo-dbg package requires editing debian/rules as normally dh_strip will strip out debugging symbols. So we need to override that behavior:\n.PHONY: override_dh_strip\noverride_dh_strip:\n        dh_strip --dbg-package=foo-dbg\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Further reading: http://wiki.debian.org/DebugPackage\n\nA: Boost is a complex example, let's look at a simpler one first.\nIn precise, the openssl source package provides 5 binary packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*libssl1.0.0 contains the OpenSSL dynamic library, version 1.0.0. That's what programs linked against this library need to run. The package name contains a version number because you might have other versions of the library installed at the same time, if you have other programs linked against another version that isn't binary-compatible with 1.0.0.\n\n*openssl contains command line tools that use the OpenSSL library. Even if you have multiple versions of the library, you don't need multiple versions of these tools: there's just one /usr/bin/openssl and associated tools, data and documentation.\n\n*libssl-dev contains the files that you need if you want to compile a program that links against OpenSSL. There are C header files (*.h), libraries for linking (*.a, *.so), and a few assorted files.\n\n*libssl-doc contains documentation for the OpenSSL library. You only need this package if you're going to write programs that use the library.\n\n*libssl1.0.0-dbg contains debugging symbols. It's only useful for people who debug the OpenSSL library or programs that use it. andrewsomething's answer has more information on these -dbg packages.\n\n\nIn addition, precise contains an older version of the library, libssl0.9.8, because there are programs that are still linked against the older version.\nOther packages you might see are bindings for languages other than C. OpenSSL doesn't ship with any (there are bindings to OpenSSL for other languages, but they don't come from the same source). An example is sqlite3, which ships with TCL bindings.\nThe main reason for splitting packages like this is that different packages have different target audiences. A system where no one ever compiles anything only needs the core lib package, and maybe the command line tools; they'll be installed automatically from dependencies if required. If someone wants to compile a program that uses the library, they need the -dev package. If someone wants to write a program that uses the library, they need the -doc package.\nSo what about Boost? It follows the same structure, but because Boost is a huge library, it's broken up into many smaller packages: libboost-*1.46.1 and libboost-*1.46-dev. In precise, there is only one version of Boost, 1.46, but oneiric had both 1.42 and 1.46. There is also a metapackage boost-defaults that pulls in the versioned package as a dependency.\nLooking at libhangul, in addition to the dynamic library package libhangul1 and the development package libhangul-dev, there's a package libhangul-data. This package contains additional data that is required by the library. Even if you have multiple versions of the library, they can share the -data package. Also, the package is architecture-independent. Software that contains a large amount of architecture-independent data is split into architecture-dependent and architecture-independent packages, to save space on distribution sites. Another suffix with a similar meaning is -common.\nUbuntu and Debian packaging rules are very similar, so material about making Debian packages also applies to Ubuntu. In fact, you can have the same source package for Debian and Ubuntu; the only thing that makes Debian and Ubuntu packages different is compiling them against different library versionsm, and that's no more than the difference between different releases of Ubuntu. Have the Debian developer documentation at hand, especially the Debian Policy Manual and the Developer's Reference; see the New Maintainer's Guide for an introduction. Ignore the parts about working with the Debian project and so on, just read the parts about making a package. dh_make is a good way to get started with a deb package (you'll want to select “Library”).\n", "Q: Downclock CPU reaching critical temperature I have an HP tx1250 laptop. It always had serious overheating problems and although usually it runs fine I'm now running a continuous test for my dissertation, this brings the CPU temp close to the critical and from time to time the computer shutdown for reaching it (checked the log).\nI use to have the same problem on Win XP but I noticed Win Vista and 7 downclock the CPU when is necessary to cool it down so I was thinking if the same is possible on Ubuntu 12.\nThe only program I've found that may do the job is computer temp ( http://computertemp.berlios.de/ ) but it doesn't seems to work under Ubuntu 12.\nThe inside of the laptop is fairly clean, the thermal paste is quite recent, I'm keeping it lifted from the desk and judjung by the sound of the fan that's running fine as well. The pc in now running between 78 and 91 degrees C  but about once a day it shut down for reaching 95. I need the results of the test it's running pretty soon so it's important that it runs non-stop.\nI've though to set the maximum clock of the CPU to slightly less the maximum but then these tests I'm running would take much more time.\n\nThanks for your answers but I was thinking about something much easier.\nActually I was about to do a bash script reading the temp on lm-sensor and adjusting the frequency but I though there was already some software doing this or Linux itself should.\n\nA: On this webpage there is a bash script that will attempt to keep your CPU below a specified temperature. http://seperohacker.blogspot.com/2012/10/linux-keep-your-cpu-cool-with-frequency.html\nThis script does this by reducing CPU frequency, and it works for my Intel i7 processor.\nShameless plug- I wrote and maintain the above script.\n\nA: How important is this test? It seems it isn't important enough to find a different computer to run it on.\nIs it important enough to buy some liquid Nitrogen? Liquid Nitrogen is fairly easy to get and not really expensive. If you set a tub of that below your laptop I imagine the cool vapors would be enough to keep your laptop on until the end of your test.\n\nA: In addition to what Huckle suggested, you could disassemble the laptop and immerse it in oil.\nWhat you would need to do, is to plunge your laptop's innards in a specialized coolant oil that would absorb the heat it would give off, and then using a motor of some sort, send the oil to a radiator where it could be cooled down before being recycled back into the oil tank.\nThis method would be a cost-effective solution to keeping your laptop cool (as opposed to air cooling alone), and has been proven to increase power usage effectiveness (or PUE) by as much as 35% in some systems.\nHere's another possibility: you could use the HP Cloud to run your test; it moves very fast, and it has app. As an HP cloud user, you already have access to a capacity of 1000.\nReferences: oil, cloud.\n", "Q: How can I change the default Alt+F2 search?

I was using thunderbird v15.0 on ubuntu 12.04 LTS till now, and have the lightning extension installed to manage calendar within thunderbird application. everything was working fine until i decided to update thunderbird to the latest version 16.0 from ubuntu repository. installation was successful, and the profile everything was taken care of perfectly, except that now lightning is not working - it is disabled as lightning v1.7 is NOT compatible with latest thunderbird v16 yet. As a result i am at loss with all my scheduling.\nnow, i would like to go back to thunderbird v15 so that i can use lightning. ubuntu repository only gives TB v16 now. on mozilla site, they are still giving v15 for linux, so i downloaded the tarball and uncompressed using command line. now i have a folder called thunderbird. there are no readme/ configuration files. there are following 'executable files' inside this folder:\ncrashreporter, mozilla-remote-client, plugin-container, thunderbird and thunderbird-bin.\n\ni tried invoking thunderbird and thunderbird-bin from command line using sudo, still nothing is opening up. i have execute permissions for this folder contents.\ni m quite new to linux. please let me know why i m not able to launch thunderbird. did i install it incorrectly? please let me know if i can get a .deb package for TB v15.\n\nA: Caveat: the following answer DOES NOT apply if you downloaded Thunderbird V16 from mozilla.org an installed it manually, if you have done that I would recommend uninstalling it and using the lastest version from the Software Center (all your email and settings should be saved but just in case save /home/.thunderbird and you can just paste it over the new folder(by the same name) after install if your settings and emails disappear.)\n\nThunderbird V16 is beta software so you must be using the beta ppa for Thunderbird.\nYou will either need to disable it or remove it.\nThe easiest way to disable it is to open the update manager in the \"gear\" icon of the Unity Bar(it will be the fourth menu item, may also say Updates Available):\n\nclick on the Settings button and then Other Software in the window that pops up:\n\nYou will then need to uncheck the ppa for http://ppa.launchpad.net/mozillateam/thunderbird-next/ubuntu then close the window and on the Update Manager window click Check to update your source list\n\nWhen finished it may show you Thunderbird V15(not yet in the regular Ubuntu Repo) or the current V14 (V15 was just released and should replace V14 shortly so you can just install V14 and then update when the official release comes out) if so you can just install it form there, if it does not show up or gives errors about a newer version being installed, you will need to use the terminal and type sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and then it should show you V14 or V15 of Thunderbird and allow you to install it from there.\n\nYou can also purge the beta ppa of Thunderbird by using ppa-purge and it will remove the beta ppa and then downgrade Thunderbird in one step.  In a terminal type the following:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:mozillateam/thunderbird-next\n\nIt will tell you that Thunderbird will be downgraded to V15/V14 and ask if you want to contiue, if you answer yes it will remove the ppa and downgrade Thunderbird to the lastest stable version.\n\n[edit] A side affect of downgrading that I have not encountered with upgrades was encountered by the OP of the question, After a successful downgrade, the account profile was not found, we fixed it with the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Home folder and press Ctrl+H to show hidden files\n\n*Open the .thunderbird file & find the file with your profile in it- it will be a file with a random name of letters and/or numbers  followed by .default(i.e. 3qwerty.default). If there is more than one, open them and see which one has your settings.\n\n*Open the file called profiles.ini\n\n*Edit the last line in the profiles.ini file to read: \"Path=name_of_your_folder.default\"  (i.e. Path=3qwerty.default) and then save the file. When you open Thunderbird, your account should be there.\n\n", "Q: How do I reinstall the sound icon / sound menu?

What should I do to solve this issue?\n\nA: Sometimes one needs to run autoreconf to generate the configure script, so use:\nsudo apt install autoconf && autoreconf -ivf\n\n\nA: I think the problem is that you haven't got the dependencies for the program in question, as even though you have run ./configure there are just the files called makefile.in and makefile.am, whereas there should be a a file called Makefile without an extension.\nIf you run ./configure without the dependencies, it does not generate a makefile and then running make afterwards gives exactly the error you are getting:\nmake: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.\n\nTherefore, download the build dependencies for your program by looking at the readme included in the download or if the program source is in the repositories and you have enabled the source repositories, run\nsudo apt-get build-dep program\n\nAfter obtaining the dependencies, run ./configure again and now make and make install should work as there will be a proper Makefile generated.\n(You may also need to install such packages as build-essential which contains essential compiling tools)\n\nA: Maybe when you build you do that as a user and then you do make install as root but as root you are in another directory.\nSolution in this case: as root change directory to your build directory, then: make install\nWorked for me in Debian Stretch.\n", "Q: Errors were encountered while processing: linux-image-3.2.0-27-generic linux-image-3.2.0-29-generic linux-image-generic inux-generic My operating system is Ubuntu precise.

On top of that, the notification for the volume was just plain wrong (0% sound did not correspond to 0 on the progress bar). So I decided to override these options with my own commands. I used CompizConfig Settings Manager to add custom commands to the brightness and volume keys (this couldn't be done in the regular settings because these keys were handled by the BIOS, unlike normal function keys). I used xbacklight to control the brightness and amixer to control the volume.\nThe problem is that the nice notify-send notifications don't show up when I manually set the brightness/volume, so now I have to do that myself too.

If you have a later model that came with Snow Leopard installed originally I suggest you do the same to be safe.\nI posted this on ubuntuforums:\n\"I know this thread is a bit old but after days of struggling to clean install OSX on a Mac after a disk erase I have a solution!!!\nIf you do it this way you can directly install from a partition on the same drive or even just boot the installer from that partition to use disk utils and create a USB installer\\DVD installer or external HD installer.\nFirstly install ubuntu on the mac (or an external HD) and find a dmg install OS X DVD image that matches the original OS installed on that hardware when purchased. \nMake sure when you install Ubuntu that you leave free unpartitioned space to create a couple of partitions later.\nThe big issue with these images is that they actually contain multiple partitions of different filesystems so if you just convert to img and then try to mount it or convert to ISO and mount it will only mount the bootcamp installer partition but I found a link which I'll post that has the work around.\nYou'll need to install packages dmg2img, gparted, hfsplus, hfsprogs & hfsutils.\nCreate an 8GB HFS+ and another bigger HFS+ partition that you plan to install OS X on (so 30gb+), as mentioned in the link below and follow those instructions carefully.\nUse Linux to install OSX from a DMG extracted to a partition - without a Mac DVD\nAfter so much struggling, this was the only way that worked, and it's pretty straight forward. Was able to do it and install OS X within half an hour or so and the install was very fast because it was on the same HD.\nBest of luck to anybody who's had this hassle, it works great as long as you get a proper dmg of an install DVD.\n", "Q: Keyboard Freezes with Wireless Use on HP Pavillion dm1 \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat should I do when Ubuntu freezes? \n\nI recently bought an HP Pavillion DM1 laptop for everyday use.

I am a complete newbie to partitioning and I would like some guidance here. Can anyone explain what exactly I should be doing here?\nI am installing Kubuntu 12.04 on a currently Windows 7 laptop. My current Partitions say this:\n/dev/sda   \n/dev/sda1   ntfs    104 MB     35 MB\n/dev/sda2   ntfs    319965 MB  87164 MB\n\nBasically, what I want is some guidance on what exactly to do here. All I want is a partition for my OS (Which will be Kubuntu 12.04) and a partition for all of my data. I also want to restart fresh with my hard drive, with only what I mentioned on here. I am installing Kubuntu from a flash drive (I set it up as a bootable device with Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.0.9), as I do not have any blank CDs/DVDs to burn to.\n\n\n*\n\n*What should I name my partitions?\n\n*What should I set the type as?\n\n*What size do they need to be?\n\n\nEdit: My hard drive is 320GB. Just looked it up in my BIOS. This computer will mainly be used for internet browsing and overall just messing around with the Linux OS.\n\nA: First of all, be warned that (even though it's quite unlikely) you may lose all the data on the hard disk by doing any of the following operations. Before fiddling with partitions, be absolutely sure that you've saved all your important data on a separate storage device.\nThe first question here is, do you want to keep your current OS and install Kubuntu alongside it, or do you want to delete it? Kubuntu can read Windows partitions, but Windows can't read Linux partitions. So do consider dual-booting, using Windows partition as storage for data such as videos and music.\nTo setup a dual-boot configuration you will need to free some space for Kubuntu, so shrink the 319965 MB drive (it will probably be called C:). In Windows 7, go to the built-in disk partitioning program (you can find it by typing \"part\" in the Start Menu). Right click on the partition and select the shrink menu item (or something like that). Shrink it by something like 50000 MB (read to the end before deciding on the shrink amount, this will be the space available for Kubuntu).\n(If you want to rewrite the whole drive with Kubuntu, ignore this paragraph)\nNow we can proceed to install Kubuntu. Please note that the version 12.04.1 has been released recently and you should use it, but if you don't want to redownload, it's not a big problem too. Also make sure that you've downloaded the correct CD image. It should be Kubuntu Desktop, x64 if your computer is 64-bit (ignore the \"recommended\" label), else x86.\nBoot with the USB drive plugged in (you may need to do some fiddling in the BIOS for it to be accepted as the boot device). Select Start Kubuntu. Then press Install Kubuntu. Check Install this third-party software and press Continue.\nAnd here we proceed with the partitioning.\nSelect Manual and click Continue. If you want to remove the existing OS, click on every partition (/dev/sda1, /dev/sda2) and Delete them. Either way we should have free space to work with. Now we will create the partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*The root partition: here all the system files and applications installed with package manager will be stored.\nClick on free space to go to the Create Partition window. The absolute minimum for this partition would be 8000 MB, but that can be not enough. On the system I'm using right now I've installed tons and tons of different packages and I've used about 13 GB, so I recommend to make this partition 16000 MB or even 24000 MB. Also keep in mind this partition shouldn't be too large (i.e. more than 35% of the space), because the rest of the space will be used for your documents and application settings.\nThe type for the partition should preferably be \"Primary\", but that's not a big deal. Leave the Location... as \"Beginning\". Use as: \"Ext4 journaling file system\". Mount Point: \"/\".\n\n*The swap partition: this partition is used as additional RAM if there's not enough of it and also to store the state of RAM for hibernation.\nClick on free space. This partition's size should be the same as the amount of RAM on the computer, 2000 MB or something like that. Type... can be Logical. Location...: \"Beginning\". Use as: \"swap area\".\n\n*The home partition is used to store all your data.\nClick on free space. You want this partition to take up all the remaining space, so don't change the partition size. Type... can be \"Logical\". Location: \"Beginning\". Use as: \"Ext4...\". Mount point: \"/home\"\n\n\nTo sum up, the / partition should be about 16 GB, swap is a few GB, /home is the rest. So if you have 50 GB of space in total, the /home partition will be about 30 GB. If you have more space, go on and make the / partition larger as mentioned before. swap can be made larger too, maybe twice the amount of RAM.\nIf you have less than 50 GB of space, it may be better to not have a separate /home partition. In that case make one large / partition and then a swap partition of a few GB. swap is actually optional too, but it's quite important...\nThe Format? checkbox should be on the / and /home partitions if everything went correctly.\nDevice for boot loader installation should be \"/dev/sda\" (no numbers in the end!).\nNo changes have been made until this point, but when you click Install Now, there is no going back. So check that everything is alright and make sure that the computer is connected to a power source. It is also nice to have an Internet connection (through an Ethernet wire).\nSelect your country and time zone and click Continue. You probably don't need to change the keyboard layout. Click Continue. Your name is a display name. The username is made out of it. The password is quite important: you will be required to enter it to do administrative actions (e.g. sudo command). You may want to choose automatic login. I wouldn't recommend to encrypt the home folder; I've never used it and I'm not sure if it's reliable.\nEnjoy the slide show, wait until the installation ends and reboot the computer.\n", "Q: Dual boot problem!

It seems that some ppa's I had in 11.04 installed newer versions of applications in the system. After upgrading, the remains of these apps seemed to do some mess in the dependencies.\nThe solution that seems to work (until now), was found on a german ubuntu board (http://forum.ubuntuusers.de, posts from user Lasall):\nFirst a downgrade is required and done with the following:\ncreate the 'preferences' file:\nsudo vi /etc/apt/preferences\n\nand insert the following lines:\nPackage: *       \nPin: release a=precise*\nPin-Priority: 2012\n\nPin-Priority must be greater than 1000.\nThen you may downgrade the offending applications with:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThen you may install packages that complained about dependencies, like\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs-multiarch, or sudo apt-get install ia32-libs.\nFinally, you should remove the file you just created:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/preferences\n\nbecause else no new updates would be found.\nHope this helps you too!\n\nA: See this section of the Debian release notes for a guide to disabling package holds.\nYour problems could also be caused by PPA packages.

I recently downloaded Minecraft with the .jar format and had it running on my computer not so long ago. Now that I'm using my desktop instead of laptop temporarily, I want it to run. On my laptop it was a tremendous hassle to get OpenJDK to even run the application without it going black and I don't have that problem on my desktop.\nHowever, when I run the application on desktop, my keyboard becomes unresponsive and doesn't type at all.

I'm using OpenJDK 6 because the 7 has the same 'black screen' I mentioned. So I need this to work within OpenJDK 6.\nThanks so much in advance and I'll try to specify as many details as I can.\n\nA: This may be a problem with the Lightweight Java Game Library (lwjgl). Mojang does not keep up with their updates. Download the latest version from http://lwjgl.org/download.php, and extract the archive. Replace jinput.jar, lwjgl.jar, and lwjgl_util.jar in the .minecraft/bin directory with the corresponding files from the extracted directory lwjgl-2.8.x/jar. Also replace the the files in .minecraft/bin/natives with the files from lwjgl-2.8.x/jar/native/linux.

You don't need to bother with any section other than \"Choosing your JRE\" unless you want to.\nMojang didn't design Minecraft to run on OpenJDK, they instead designed it to run on Sun's Java.

If a 32 bit program wont run in your 64 bit system, I suspect there is a different issue. Try starting the program in terminal & watch for any errors. (strating a program in terminal simply requires  opening a terminal, typing the program name, & hit enter). If any errors appear, paste them in your question & I will try to help.\n", "Q: How to change dnsmasq port? I am using port 53 for my vpn, and I need to use port 53. I changed the port of dnsmasq, connected openVPN,  and now request are unable to resolve errors.\nsudo dnsmasq -p 5642\n\n. Is there a way to change the port of dnsmasq w/o conflicts/errors? \n\nA: No. Every piece of DNS requester software expects to find the DNS service on port 53 of the nameserver. If it is not there then DNS will not work.\n$ grep '\\s53/' /etc/services \ndomain          53/tcp                          # name-domain server\ndomain          53/udp\n\n\nA: Actually some unix distros allow you to specify the port for DNS in the /etc/resolv.conf nameservers entry but unfortunately Ubuntu isn't one of them. If it were possible you would specify the DNS port in /etc/network/interfaces along with the IP address of the nameserver — presumably a loopback address in your case.\nThere is an enhancement logged: Please allow specification of port in resolv.conf\nMy guess is that you will have move the port that your VPN is using. However, there is probably a good reason why the VPN is listening on the DNS port. You might want to check it out before trying to change it; you might be trying to do something that it already does for you.\n", "Q: How Can I Modify GRUB? how can i make it so my GRUB does not show safe modes, does show memory sticks, and if possible has a hotkey to boot windows?\n\nA: Just to complete the previous reply, here is how you install grub-customizer:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\n\nA: Add the following line to /etc/default/grub \nGRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=true\n\nAfter that execute sudo update-grub.\n\nA: You can install grub-customizer which is an easy graphical way to make adjustments to your grub menu, including removal of safe modes (which I don't recommend because it may seem like a good idea until something happens and you need to boot into safe mode). \nGRUB is located on your fixed storage. Therefore, if your memory stick is bootable, your bios will boot from the memory stick before GRUB ever has a chance to launch from your drive.\nWindows will show on the GRUB menu and as far as I know must be selected from the list of installed OSes as normal. \n\nA: Just Go to the terminal .\nThen Log on as Super User.\nThen open the File vi /etc/boot/grub/grub.conf\nThere you can modify your grub \nI hope it will help you my friend\n", "Q: My administrator password doesn't work I have recently loaded Ubuntu from a CD. My administrator password doesn't work when logging into Ubuntu at the opening screen.\n\nA: Boot while holding the shift key down. You'll then be greeted by a GRUB menu.

When I click on one of my accounts in StackApplet on Ubuntu 12.04, it redirects me to a page that says \"Page Not Found\".

Is my USB corrupted?\n\nA: I had the same problem. The issue at my case was that it was formatted as Ubuntu live CD. And instead of listing the mounpoint of the USB itself in /etc/mtab, the Live-Folder within the USB was listed. Therefore, it was impossible to unmount the USB-drive itself. My solution was to remove the mountpoint of the USB with the command\n$ sudo rm -rf /media/<name of drive>\n\nThis had the same effect as unmounting the USB and I was able to use gparted for further steps (formatting etc.)\n", "Q: How can I remove or block every method that can be used to reset my password? I've been an Ubuntu user for a while now and not so long ago one of my computers got hijacked and malicious code was installed in it by simply replacing my password using the various password recovery features in the OS. \nPlease help me. Your assistance will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Any PC or server is vulnerable to physical attack, if the attacker has unhindered access to the hardware.\nSo do one (or more) of the following:\n(1.)  Physically secure your hardware and data.\n(2.)  Use keys or BIOS password to discourage alternate methods of booting.\n(3.)  Store your critical (or confidential) data in an encrypted volume, that requires an additional pass-key (or physical token) to allow access.\n", "Q: \"iso-mount seems to be mounted read-only\" error in UCK 2.4.6 or 2.2.0 I need to use UCK on 12.04.

I need to use UCK on Lubuntu or Ubuntu 12.04 urgently.\n\nA: That is a just warning given by mount when an iso file is mounted. \nUCK mounts the Ubuntu iso file in ~/tmp/remaster-iso-mount directory so that directory name is part of the output. You can ignore that warning and you should.\nYou can verify this by trying to manually mount the Ubuntu iso file. For the time being let's assume the file name is ubuntu.iso and it is in the current directory or home directory. Using this command \nsudo mount ~/ubuntu.iso /mnt\n\nwould produce the warning below:\nmount: warning: /mnt seems to be mounted read-only.\n\nThis is logical, because You can't mount an iso in read-write mode. An iso is always read-only. \n", "Q: No boot selection screen \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?) \n\nI recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS alongside Windows 7 using Ubuntu's Startup disk creator and installation completed without any difficulties or errors. \nNow when I try to boot, it directly boots with Windows and shows no option to choice as to which Operating System to load.

However now the camera is mounted using gvfs, and df seems to ignore it. I've also tried pydf and discus to no avail.\nThe camera is definitely available through nautilus, and when I select the camera in nautlius, the status bar tells me the amount of disk free. I can also open the ~/.gvfs/ folder in nautilus and right click on the camera folder and get the disk usage in a graphical way.\nBut that is no use for a script. Are there command line tools that are the equivalent of df for gvfs filesystems?

When connecting the drive it mounts automatically. Is there a way to start the local backup whenever the usb disc connected. \nMy guess is that using udev it should be possible to \"somehow\" tell crashplan to reevaluate the presence of backup location. Any ideas to do this?\n\nA: No, \nthe CrashPlan client does not offer this basic level of functionality. I had a similar problem and I can confirm that it is not possible, according to tech support at CrashPlan. They are either unable or unwilling to support it, instead referring paying customers to the forums for help. Here is the email I sent explaining a very similar situation, along with their response:  \nMe\n\nCrashplan, May 22 09:49 am (CDT):\nUbuntu Linux 12.04 64-bit, fresh install.\n  Root filesystem '/' is on a small SSD\n  Home filesystem '/home' is on a large HDD\n  Backup drive is on a third HDD.\n  First drive automatically mounts at BOOT, next two drives automatically mount at LOGIN.\n  CrashPlan starts at boot, before I login, so it creates a directory in the small Root drive, which quickly fills up. I need to clear all those files out, and then set CrashPlan to wait for the HDDs to mount before it writes any files to backup.\n\nCrashplan's response \n\nJason S., May 23 11:17 am (CDT):\nHello,\nUnfortunately, CrashPlan is specifically designed to launch at\n  startup, at the runlevel that it is assigned. While it may be possible\n  to disable that functionality and cause it to start manually, that's\n  not something I would be able to assist with as it is not a supported\n  configuration.\nHere is a link to the forums:\nhttps://crashplan.zendesk.com/forums/\nOur user base has come up with means to assist each other with several\n  unsupported configurations. I would suggest that you inquire further\n  on the forums.\nLet me know if there is anything else I can help you with.\n~Jason  \n\nI was quite surprised to see CrashPlan creating a new directory at root, then blindly filling the disk until it created a bigger problem. It's my opinion that the software is poorly written and is not suitable for use until this is corrected. Déjà Dup will check that the destination drive is connected and has space, which is the correct approach. CrashPlan gives no error messages and creates new problems.  \nI recommend using Déjà Dup combined with Ubuntu One instead. It actually works, and does not create any new problems. It can cost more if you have lots of data to back up, but you get what you pay for. \n", "Q: USB Ports In Wrong Mode, How To Use usbmodeswitch? I haven't had access to my USB ports as media devices for a couple days now. I've been reading and researching everything I can find but I can't find a good guide for usbmodeswtich or usbms that I can decipher.  The USB's are fine for power, but won't support my android phone as a media device, which is killing me because I use adb everyday, and won't support my plug and play mouse any longer.

If I recall correctly usb_modeswitch is intended for switching the attached USB device, not the port itself. The manpage confirms this. USB by default should work universally and shouldn't keep a specific state when a device is unplugged on a specific port.\nI think the issue you are experiencing is more related to the notebook itself and you are on the wrong track, that's why it is so hard to find a good answer. I have heard about dead USB ports on some HP notebooks from colleagues at work, the exact model number and may be product number might help. Something like: g6-1101sg (LS281EA)\nIf the USB ports are not dead due to some firmware misbehavior you mouse should work as well as adb. What Android Phone are you using? Does is really use UMS or MTP/PTP like the Galaxy Nexus? If it uses UMS, it should work just fine, just like plugging a dedicated USB storage stick in and out, no mode switch required. MTP is different because most the software out there is in an immature state.\n", "Q: How to access parent window in dialog I am using Quickly and created the main window and a dialog.

The elaboration would be most appreciated since I am very new to this.\n\nA: There could be several problems here, but the main thing is probably the locale settings which I mention in my third point:\n1)  You could first try to remove the program (qmail) that seems to be causing the problems (and preventing you installing anything else) by running: \nsudo apt-get remove qmail\n\nOr if you want to keep it and try to configure it (and anything else), run \nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nWe cannot use dpkg-reconfigure until the package is actually configured in the first place. \nNow please try to run sudo apt-get update.\n2) Even though your error messages include something about your hostname, this is probably a red herring, as you have discussed in the comments. Nevertheless, you could still check that the output of cat /etc/hostname and the hostname at the top of /etc/hosts are the same. \n3) Now, your main problem is probably to do with your locale settings, even though the output of locale doesn't look particularly amiss. However, the exact errors generated by your problem have occurred several times on Ubuntuforums. The general advice is to run locale-gen and feed it with your particular settings; for example, in your case you could run:  \nsudo locale-gen en.IN \n\nYou might also need to add en_IN.ISO8859-1 or en_IN.UTF-8, depending on how you want your encoding settings specified. The advice in the article here is quite useful and could be further modified to suit your needs if necessary. After running locale-gen, it is also useful to run\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure locales\n\nIf that does not solve the issue, there is further documentation on locales at the Ubuntu wiki. However, the solution should be to do with locales as it appears to be a common problem.\n\nA: Edit /etc/hosts file to change\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n127.0.1.1 desktop\n\nto\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n127.0.1.1 desktop.your.domain desktop\n\nExample: with my machine\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n127.0.1.1 vnpt\n\nto\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n127.0.1.1 vnpt.vnpt-domain vnpt\n\nAfter that you can install qmail.\n", "Q: Burning Snow Leopard DMG on Ubuntu So I have a SL Copy of Mac OS X Snow Leopard.DMG and I am running Ubuntu 12.0.4.

I need it to run on my hostel LAN. Any help for compiling the Opendchub source for 12.04 is also welcome.\n\nA: You can use linuxdcpp. \n\nDirect connect is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol. Clients\n  connect to a central hub where they can view a list of clients or\n  users connected to them. Users can search for files and download them\n  from other clients, as well as chat with other users.\nThe most popular Windows client implementing this protocol currently\n  is DC++. LinuxDC++ is a Linux port of DC++.

I have a VAIO VGN-CR35G with 11.10 installed. I bought a new battery (not from Sony) with double the capacity but the BIOS is set for the old battery. The new battery came with a CD to update the .dat file with new information about the battery, but it's an .exe and does not work on VAIO. \nI was thinking maybe I can alter the BIOS manually? If so, how can I do that?\n\nA: Boot Windows via Live CD/Pre-Installation Environment/Recovery Environment and run the executable from there. Don't try something different, this may cause damage to your notebook. Also you should only use original spare parts. There were too many exploding notebook batteries in the news in the recent years.\n", "Q: Installing software on an offline Ubuntu server Assuming that I have a server with Ubuntu server newly installed on it. I was thinking of installing the very same version on Virtual Box (Or any other virtualization software), connect it to the internet and use apt-get to only download the packages for upgrading the system and the new software such as (tomcat7, openjdk6-default-headless..etc). Then copy the downloaded packages from the archive folder to the offline server's archive folder through a USB stick.\nSo now the virtual system won't actually be upgraded nor have any new software installed. But would running the very same apt-get commands on the offline system without the download directive -d be executed without issues ?\n*EDIT:*This needs to be as simple as possible because I'll have to write a guide for our client to do this on his own and so it won't be acceptable to require deep Linux knowledge to do this.\n\nA: I once had a similar problem. I solved it using apt-mirror. With that it is possible to mirror a whole repository onto a external hard drive an then install from that hard drive on your offline machine.\nUpsides\n\n\n*\n\n*Once configured you can install packages as you were used to.\n\n*Espacially dependencies are resolved comfortably.\n\n*You can easily do updates by first updating the mirror files and then updating on your offline machine.\n\n\nDownsides\n\n\n*\n\n*You need a lot external hard drive space (about 35gb).\n\n*Mirror must be configured first. May not be suitable for beginners.\n\n*Initital creation of mirror takes some time.\n\n\nIf you want to give it a try this tutorial seems to be quite good.

However, it was usually just for installing new software, not upgrading software.\nBy offline server, do you mean a server accessible to a LAN cut off from the rest of the internet?\n\nA: An Easy solution for your need  would be apt-on-CD. Get the packages from a machine which has access to internet. Then use aptoncd utility to create CD/media for install in  your machine.\nFor more details visit this link which details the process\nand this question and answers in askubuntu itself.\n\nA: you can install downloaded deb packages manually using\n    sudo dpkg -i package.deb\n\nor\n    sudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nnote that if you do not want to install all packages downloaded and installed on machine A also on machine B then you need to keep track of the order in which you downloaded and installed them, because due to dependencies, if you want to install the 10th package you installed on machine A also on machine B, you may also need to install one or more or all of packages 1 through 9.\n", "Q: A better graphic card for my laptop?

I want to provide to my users a highly secure environment, without any desktop environment with just one window open. Now I want to make sure user can't close that window. Is there any way to hack around with compiz so that there is no way a user can close the window. Not by pressing close button, not by pressing alt+f4 etc.?\nI am open to use any window manager amongst those available in 12.04. Either of compiz, metacity, and others. I am also willing to hack around with source code if required.\nEDIT: Just disabling ALT+F4 from OS doesn't solve the problem. That is because some applications issue close commands on pressing ALT+F4 even before the event is bubbled to OS. I need a way by which the ability to close the window is taken away from application itself.\n\nA: Compiz provides this functionality using the Window Rules plugin.  You specify which windows to match (by name, type, ID, etc.) and then you can apply rules to those windows.  One of the rules is to prevent the window from closing.  I used this for a long time and can confirm it works well and prevents keyboard shortcuts, close button, and right click and close on the task bar.  Pretty much a low-level way of preventing a window from closing.\nYou can also use xprop to do this (Compiz not required).  An example:\nxprop -format _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS 32a -set _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS \"_NET_WM_ACTION_MOVE, _NET_WM_ACTION_RESIZE, _NET_WM_ACTION_FULLSCREEN, _NET_WM_ACTION_MINIMIZE, _NET_WM_ACTION_SHADE, _NET_WM_ACTION_MAXIMIZE_HORZ, _NET_WM_ACTION_MAXIMIZE_VERT, _NET_WM_ACTION_CHANGE_DESKTOP, _NET_WM_ACTION_ABOVE, _NET_WM_ACTION_BELOW\"\n\nCombined with locating the window ID to use:\nwindow_id=`wmctrl -l | grep Insert_Name_of_Window | head -n1 | cut -d\" \" -f1`\nxprop -id \"$window_id\" -format _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS 32a -set _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS \"_NET_WM_ACTION_MOVE, _NET_WM_ACTION_RESIZE, _NET_WM_ACTION_FULLSCREEN, _NET_WM_ACTION_MINIMIZE, _NET_WM_ACTION_SHADE, _NET_WM_ACTION_MAXIMIZE_HORZ, _NET_WM_ACTION_MAXIMIZE_VERT, _NET_WM_ACTION_CHANGE_DESKTOP, _NET_WM_ACTION_ABOVE, _NET_WM_ACTION_BELOW\"\n\nNote that what xprop is modifying here are allowed actions for the window, not the window's state.  So if you want to prevent a window from being minimized, remove the _NET_WM_ACTION_MINIMIZE action, and so on.  If you actually want to change the state of a window, using wmctrl is an easier tool to use for that.\nAlthough the default list of allowed actions is likely the same for all window managers, you might want to run xprop | grep _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS on the window before just to be sure that you're re-setting all of the other actions that were there before.  There doesn't seem to be a way of using xprop to remove a single allowed action, only to remove an entire property.\nIn terms of how foolproof/secure this is, it's probably as good as you can get for a single window.  By removing _NET_WM_ACTION_CLOSE or another allowed action, it means that the window is not allowed to receive that action.  No matter what method a user might try to close the window, the window will never receive that action.  Obviously there are more components to making a secure desktop, but this should be the best way to prevent a window from closing.\nHowever, if the application offers a way of closing itself (e.g. File > Quit), then it will close when that is triggered.  Removing _NET_WM_ACTION_CLOSE prevents the action from being received from outside the window, but doesn't prevent the window from triggering the action itself.\n\nA: As I know and as you said there are two ways to prevent closing a window. disable close button and alt+f4\nTo disable close, minimize, maximize button in Gnome :\nAlt+F2\nEnter: gconf-editor\nGo to app > metacity > general\nDouble click on button layout\nyou will see\nmenu:minimize,maximize,close\nyou can also use Gnome tweak tool to enable disable menu and button icons which is available here https://live.gnome.org/GnomeTweakTool\nI think you can remove the ones you don't want from there.\nTo disable atl+f4 :\nIn the menu go to System - Preferences - Personal -Keyboard Shortcuts\ndisable the shortcuts which you want\n", "Q: How can I open an application without making it appear (at all) in the Unity launcher? I want to open a startup application in background, but i dont want too see it in common Unity panel at the left side.  \nAt the worst it will be at the task bar (where there is a clock).\nThanks for your time.  \nPrtSc: running \"test.desktop\" with \"gcalctool\". You see its icon with picture \"question mark!\"  Link to PrtSc\n\nA: I don't think it'd be possible in Unity, because the top bar is reserved for menus. But if you want it, you can install any other Desktop Environment like XFCE or LXDE. Then you can install some dock like AWN, Cairo Dock, etc. \nXubuntu with dock\n\nLubuntu with dock\n\nMore on docks: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/04/you-choose-the-best-dock-for-ubuntu-poll.\n\nA: The way an application is represented in Unity is defined in its .desktop file. In case we do not want an icon to appear in the Unity Launcher we may call an application from a .desktop file where we do not reference an icon, e.g.\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Calculator No Icon\nComment=Perform arithmetic, scientific or financial calculations\nExec=gcalctool\nTerminal=false\nIcon=\nType=Application\n\nYou can test this by saving this example in ~/.local/share/applications/<anyname>.desktop. Give this file executable permission to be able to run it from double click in Nautilus. Notice that the icon in the Launcher will be replaced by an empty space.\n\nThere is no guarantee that removing the Icon= reference in its .desktop file prevents showing an icon as every window may define an icon representation at runtime. This can be seen when we remove the /usr/share/applications/gcalctool.desktop file. Still gcalctool will show its icon in the Launcher when run from a terminal. \nIn any case we are not able to remove the empty placeholder for a graphical application that opens a window on the desktop.\n", "Q: Desktop folder and files disappeared I restarted my computer, and when I logged back in, I noticed that all of my files that were on the desktop are gone.

I installed later the KDE desktop, XFCE, LXDE, gnome-shell and Cinnamon. \nThe KDE comes with different default applications than Unity, such as \n\n\n*\n\n*kwrite for text editing,\n\n*konsole as virtual terminal,\n\n*kfontview for font viewing and installing,\n\n*dolphin as File browser etc.\n\n\nOther DE come with some other default applications.\nThe problem arises when you want to open a file such as a text file, with which can both be opened by gedit and kwrite, I want to use kwrite on KDE and gedit on Unity or Gnome. But, there is no way to set like this. I can set default application for text file by changing respective settings in both KDE and Unity, but It become default for both DE.\nFor example, If I set kfontviewer as default font viewing application in KDE, it also opens fonts when I am in Unity or Gnome and vice versa. This is a problem because, loading other DE's program takes long time than the default one for the used DE.\nMy question is: Can I use different default applications for different DE? How? \n\nA: I've put together this solution to resolve your issue, and tested it on KDE and XFCE with opening text files and font files. It is a generic solution that should be applicable to any number of desktop environments and mime types. The way it works is there is a simple python script called custom-open that will open a file using different applications for different desktop environments. These are the steps to setup the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*save custom-open script on your computer preferably on your path but doesn't have to be. \n\n*save .custom-open.ini in your home directory ~/.custom-open.ini\n\n*set custom-open as the default application for any file types you want handled by it.\n\n\ncustom-open\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport traceback, sys, os, ConfigParser, os.path\nfrom subprocess import Popen, check_output\nfrom gtk import MessageDialog, MESSAGE_ERROR, BUTTONS_CLOSE\n\ntry:\n    file, desktop = sys.argv[1], os.environ['DESKTOP_SESSION']\n    mime = check_output(['file', '--mime-type', file]).strip().split(': ')[1]\n    config = ConfigParser.RawConfigParser()\n    config.read(os.path.expanduser('~/.custom-open.ini'))\n    cmd = config.get(desktop, mime)\n    Popen([cmd] + sys.argv[1:])\nexcept:\n    msg = \"CUSTOM OPEN ERROR\\n\\n\" + traceback.format_exc()\n    MessageDialog(None, 0, MESSAGE_ERROR, BUTTONS_CLOSE, msg).run()\n\n.custom-open.ini\n[gnome]\ntext/plain = gedit\napplication/x-font-ttf = gnome-font-viewer\n\n[xubuntu]\ntext/plain = leafpad\napplication/x-font-ttf = gnome-font-viewer\n\n[kde-plasma]\ntext/plain = kate\napplication/x-font-ttf = kfontview\n\nso what's great about this solution is that you can add as many new desktop environments as you want and as many mime type you want. to check what name you should provide for the desktop environment run the below command in a terminal.\nenv | grep -i DESKTOP_SESSION\n\nto check the exact mime type of a file just run:\nfile --mime-type filename\n\nEDITED: The need for symbolic links has been removed this should make it easier to use. I've also added a graphical error handler that will bring up an alert if an error occurs.\n\nA: If you don't find the \"right\" way to do it, you could use a brute force method something like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set all the defaults in one desktop environment\n\n*Do something like an cd $HOME;ls -Rlrt | less to find out what files were just updated - i.e where those choices were saved\n\n*Make a separate copy of those files for each desktop environment (backed up).\n\n*Repeat for each desktop environment\n\n*Copy the appropriate set into place just before switching to that desktop environment (probably by logging out and logging back in and selecting the new desktop environment).\n\n\nHopefully, there's a way to switch desktop environments from a shell script with the option of telling the desktop environment where to get it's configuration files from.  That might be cleaner than moving files around all the time, but I haven't researched if or how that works.\nAnother, much simpler solution, but not exactly what you asked for, would be to just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create separate user accounts for each desktop environment\n\n*Create a new group for these users\n\n*Add all these users to the new group\n\n*Make any common data files you need to access from all these users -rwxrwxr-x  (chmod 775 list-of-files-and-directories).  That way you won't get permission errors trying to write to a file that another one of your \"users\" wrote to first.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want some files to be the same across all these users, you can create them in one user and symlink them to the rest of them.  This should work, but will require you to remember they're set up that way when you change any of them.  For instance, if you edit one of them and your editor makes a backup file, that backup file will only be saved where you edited it, not on all the other user accounts.\n\n\n", "Q: Local network speed issues, 12.04.01/smb/cifs I have some very common setup: \n\n\n*\n\n*a file server box (12.4.1 / kernel 3.6 / kde) connected to a router box (inet, dhcp).\n\n\nWi-Fi router is connected to the first one as DHCP relay. Both are not the best ones, but relatively new; b/g/n modes.\n\n\n*\n\n*and devices; like a laptop under latest mint with 3.6 kernel, connected to AP.\n\n\nAll devices are on the same network.\nWhen I run iperf, I have speed between them two = 70 Mbit/sec.\nWhen I use samba, a big file is copied at 3.4 Mbit/sec.\nWhen I mount same thing with cifs, a big file is copied at 10.4 Mbit/sec.\nPing in between ~3ms.\nI haven't tried NFS yet, will do. But the question is: why would the network speeds differ THAT much? \nI would expect 2x drop, or say 4x drop for some whatever bidirectional something, but that is 20x downspeed - with samba.  \nIs it likely something wrong with my setup - or is it some expected result?\nI have couple Windows laptops and would prefer to use something easy compatible like samba - but in my 12.4.1 setup smbd crashes few times a day for pattern I could not identify - and \"service restart\" does not help, so I have to reboot. Smbd and nmbd logs  do not show anything significant. That did not happen in 11.10.\nNow the other question is: should I keep fighting samba setup, or should I consider some other file sharing option that is easy with Windows? \nGoogling did not show any obvious alternative to samba. There is no big load needed on the box - a few guys sharing it as programming/apache/php/etc server, so it just needs to be reasonably quick and reliable.\n\nA: Disk performance and network performance are different beasts. iperf measures network performance, ie, data speed over LAN. Since there are no disk reads (and, specially, writes) involved, performance is expected to be many times greater than any file copy. That explains the 70MB/s vs 10MB/s (or 3) difference.\nAs for \"samba vs cifs\": first of all, you may have noticed that their performance is \"similar\", at least in order of magnitude. One is \"only\" 3x slower, not 20x. And the reason is cifs is implemented by the kernel itself, natively, thus much faster than any other fuse-like, user space mount.\nGood news is: you can use cifs to mount devices with the SMB protocol, so your shares are available to windows users. This way you get the best of both worlds: compatibility and speed.\nAn amazing guide from samba.org itself is this: CIFS Users Guide. You may also read their great wiki\nThat said, a wireless file copy speed of 10MB/s is, from my point of view, very nice.\n", "Q: Not a valid ELF image After installing 12.04.01 LTS on a iMac G5, at the boot prompt, the message \n\nnot a valid ELF image\n\nprevents me from booting.\nPlease help.\n\nA: Grabbed from here\nYou may need to download the alternate iso and install it\nonce done please follow the steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Install PPC via CLI cli-powerpc641\n\n*Use ports.ubuntu.com as mirror for repository\n\n*Finish installer & reboot\n\n*Login via command line and install ubuntu desktop using sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xorg ubuntu-desktop\n\n*Reboot\n\n", "Q: How to hide a running process ? Using Ubuntu 12.04. is there any way to hide a running process ?  That process shouldn't' display in system monitor,top,htop . There is no problem to remember the process id (PID) so observation of the process can be done easily .but i want to hide the process completely . is there any way ? \n\nA: It is impossible to hide the process unless one starts messing around in the kernel to limit this.\nOne technique is to change the process name using:\nprctl(PR_SET_NAME, (unsigned long) \"NewName\", 0, 0, 0);\n\n..and if possible to fork() and let the parent process die.  If you were to do that periodically it makes it harder to track down the process.\n\nA: I would highly recommend you to change the process name and give it some other name so that it might look like you are running some different process. \nExample: you can change the process name from \"chrome\" to \"findme\".\nThis can be done programmatically.\nor\nYou can play around at kernel level (pid_getattr) to make it possible. Again this is not recommended.\nor\n\nWARNING !!! Don't try the below answer:\n\nIf you wanna still go ahead and remove the process from top, there are few softwares which can do that for us. One among those software is called \"Rootkits\"\nRootkits: When rootkits is installed it overwrites the commands. It can overwrite the command like ps,ls,netstat,find,du,ifconfig,login,killall, etc.. \nThere many malicious software with the same name. So be careful it might infect your system.\nUnhide: To detect the hidden process you can use unhide.\n\nA: You could modify the code of the various process monitors and recompile them. I don't know exactly how process monitors get info about running processes, but I guess they get it from the linux kernel, i.e. if you modify that, it might also work, for any process monitor.\nWhy exactly do you want to hide the process?\nDo you want to filter the list of processes (easy with ps+grep commands) or really make it impossible to see it, unless you know the process ID?\n", "Q: Heroes of Newerth inventory hotkeys \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I modify or disable the HUD's use of the Alt key? \n\nI'm using 12.04 and when playing Heroes of Newerth, I have a problem when trying to use items from my inventory. I press ALT+Q or other combinations but nothing happens. \nI figured out that it's because Ubuntu opens that window where you type a command for the application you are currently using. How can I tell Ubuntu not to listen for my ALT key when playing HON?\n\nA: It works if you change the shortcut for the HUD from ALT to whatever you like.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I modify or disable the HUD's use of the Alt key?\n", "Q: Hibernation: Earlier warning if there's not enough free swap space If you hibernate and there's not enough free swap, a message is shown after the whole desktop environment is closed. \nTherefore it is only possible to reboot.\nCan I check via script (or anything else) if there's enough swap space before everything is closed?\nThanks\n\nA: The problem you see here is that the kernel has to allocate enough free swap pages to write the hibernate image and this includes some meta-data overhead too. Unfortunately the kernel can only figure out how many pages needs writing to swap after it has quiesced the processes and this is late in the hibernate process.  The hibernate in theory should bail out if there are not enough free pages and return you back to a running system, so the fact that you seem to need to reboot looks like a bug to me.\nAs a rule of thumb, one generally sizes swap ~2 x the size of the available RAM, so running out of swap on hibernate shouldn't really fail because of lack of free swap; however it is a little more complex due to the possibility of having pages already swapped out and the small amount of meta data overhead required to write out the hibernate image.\n", "Q: Can't install drivers for Alfa AWUS036H Like another person in this forum, I bought the AWUSO36H 802.11 B/G Long-Range USB Adapter for my computer running latest version of Ubuntu.\nProblem is - I can't install the drivers.

I would like to create a short clip of me playing Minecraft, an OpenGL game. The usual screencast recorders do not properly record OpenGL.  \nWhat kind of software is available for this purpose?\nMy experience with the software in the similar (but no longer duplicate) question:\n\n\n*\n\n*kazam: very low framerate despite setting to 60 FPS, no sound, unity menubar constantly flashing through the fullscreen window.\n\n*RecordMyDesktop: max framerate setting is 50 FPS, but the video becomes extremely fast if not using the default 15 FPS.\n\n*xvidcap: not available on 12.04\n\n*tibesti: not available on 12.04\n\n*wink: does not run\n\n*ffmpeg: very low quality video and no sound with the recommended settings, might be tunable though (no gui unfortunately).\n\n*kdenlive: uses recordmydesktop, and the recorded clip becomes corrupted\n\n*aconv: video sped up, often broken image, no sound\n\n\nA: GLC is well-suited for this purpose. Unfortunately it is not packaged in the archives. However, I have put it (and its dependencies) in a PPA:\n\nppa:george-edison55/glc  (Click here for instructions on using PPAs.)\n\nYou can add the PPA to your system using the following commands:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:george-edison55/glc\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen you can install GLC with:\nsudo apt-get install glc\n\nOnce the tool is installed, you can begin recording an application by running:\nglc-capture -o /tmp/capture.glc <application>\n\nThis will immediately start the application. You can start and stop the recording in-game by pressing the keyboard shortcut Shift + F8.\nWhen you are done, you will end up with a file /tmp/capture.glc that contains the data captured by the tool. You can immediately playback the recording with:\nglc-play /tmp/capture.glc\n\nIf you wish to convert the recording to a video, you can do so with:\nglc-play /tmp/capture.glc -y 1 -o - | mencoder -demuxer y4m - \\\n    -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vbitrate=3000 -o /tmp/capture.avi\n\nThis will create an MP4 file named /tmp/capture.avi with a bitrate of 3,000 Kbps.\n\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/glc.html\n\n*https://github.com/nullkey/glc/wiki/Install\n\nA: I'm using SimpleScreenRecorder to record my Minecraft gameplay. It required a few tweaks to get the sound working but nearly everything you need for recording Minecraft should be in the site (under \"Recording game audio\"). It has a GUI and, despite the name, has quite a lot of settings that you can tweak to get a video to suit your needs (e.g. quality vs file size). Install instructions are here. For Ubuntu, you'll need to add a ppa repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:maarten-baert/simplescreenrecorder\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install simplescreenrecorder\n# if you want to record 32-bit OpenGL applications on a 64-bit system:\nsudo apt-get install simplescreenrecorder-lib:i386\n\nTo record Minecraft with it, make sure video input is set to \"Record OpenGL\", click OpenGL settings and put the Java command to open your Minecraft launcher in \"Command\":\njava -jar /path/to/launcher/Minecraft.jar. Make sure \"Start the OpenGL application automatically\" is checked.This should make your Minecraft launcher open you when continue to the recording window. Just log in, click play and press Ctrl + R (configurable to use other combinations) to start/stop recording (alternatively, you can use the buttons).\nglc is another tool that does the same thing, but I haven't used it yet and don't know what it's like. Feel free to try it though.\n\nA: There are plenty of programs that screen capture from the X buffer, but that is very processor-intensive and slow. However, I did find one option that actually captures directly from the graphics card: Yukon\nAnother one is glc. glc is an ALSA & OpenGL capture tool for Linux. It consists of a generic video capture, playback and processing library and a set of tools built around that library. glc should be able to capture any application that uses ALSA for sound and OpenGL for drawing.

Are there logs I can look at to see why lubuntu's USB stops working? Is there a way to restart usb so I don't have to restart my entire computer?\n\nA: To watch the logs as something is connected you can either monitor kern.log in gnome-system-monitor or other logging software, or use the command-line and enter \ntail -f /var/log/kern.log\n\nWhen your device is connected you will see a lot of information, such as \nusb 1-3: new high-speed USB device number 5 using ehci_hcd\nInitializing USB Mass Storage driver...\nscsi2 : usb-storage 1-3:1.0\nusbcore: registered new interface driver usb-storage\nUSB Mass Storage support registered.\nusbcore: registered new interface driver uas\nscsi 2:0:0:0: Direct-Access     CREATIVE ZEN_Stone\n\nYou can keep the log open in the terminal and monitor when any errors occur as well.

This can be useful for seeing more of Ubuntu's historical highlights at a glance.\nThe article can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ubuntu_releases\n\nA: This doesn't quite answer the question, but in future I'd recommending reading OMG!Ubuntu because all the major changes are written about before the next release, and the articles are very well written. The articles about specific releases are tagged using the release codename, for example http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/tag/quantal has news about \n\nA: I think the main difference is in support and stability. Ubuntu 12.04 is more stable than Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10 because it received several bug fix. Ubuntu 12.04 is a Long Term Support (LTS) release (until 2017-04) but Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10 support is finished soon (2012-10 and 2013-04) \n", "Q: Monitor not being correctly detected, restricting screen resolution I have just updated to 12.04 and I have only one choice of screen resolution now, and it is incorrect (1024x768).

The journal (Physical Biology, an IOP publication) requires that figures be saved in .eps format, so I am trying to do that. However, I cannot get my LaTeX file to build when I have generated the .eps files on my Ubuntu computer. If I save the images on my Mac, the file build just fine.\nSo far, I have tried saving images in ImageJ, FIJI and Inkscape. The same problem occurs in all three. When using kile, I get the following error:\n\n/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/oberdiek/epstopdf-base.sty:0: Shell\n  escape feature is not enabled.\n\nIn TexWorks, the error is different, but still there:\n\nPackage pdftex.def Error: File\n  `./figures4/figure4a-eps-converted-to.pdf' not found.\n\nNow, if I fire up Inkscape, FIJI or ImageJ on OS/X, everything works fine. The Mac also can't build with the Ubuntu-saved images.\nThe images generated on the Ubuntu machine open fine using Document Viewer. I am building the same LaTeX file on both computers, with the exact same results. The header of my LaTeX file is:\n\\documentclass[12pt]{iopart}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\\usepackage{epstopdf}\n\\usepackage{parskip}\n\\usepackage{color}\n\\usepackage{iopams}  \n\nAnd then the code for the figure is:\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\center{\\includegraphics[width=4in]{./figures4/figure4a.eps}}\n    \\footnotesize{\\caption{ \\label{fig:4a} (4a)  lorem ipsum dolor sic amet.}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nI'd be happy to send an example of both .eps files. Again, sorry if this is a dumb question. I tried everything I could think of before posting here.\nThanks,\nDavid\n\nA: According to section 2.16 of the TexShop documentation (\"Shell escape protection\"), the shell escape feature is to allow pdflatex to run other programs during compilation.  In particular, the epstopdf package you are using to convert eps to pdf is such a program (incidentally, you don't have to explicitly turn that on anymore in the latest versions of TeXLive).  \nI am not familiar with kile or TeXWorks, but I expect they have an option in the preferences that let's you turn on the shell escape, just as in TeXShop.  You can also explicitly compile your LaTeX file from the command line: pdflatex --shell-escape file.tex where file.tex is the name of your file.  \nIt sounds like the reason you can typeset your file on the Mac but not Ubuntu, is either: 1) Your Mac version(s) of your TeX apps have shell escape enabled, or 2) When you make your eps file on the Mac, it additionally creates pdf versions, which are later found by your TeX app and so no conversion from eps is needed.  \n", "Q: Purpose of .dir, .install files in packages When packaging Ubuntu packages, there's always these funny .dir and .install files around. I suppose their purpose is to somehow indicate what files are to be installed, but I'm not so sure about what the the format of those files is, nor what the consequences are when they are omitted.\n\nA: debian/install and debian/packagename.install files both have the same purpose, the latter being used in case you build multiple binary packages from the same source (so you need to distinguish which files go into which resulting package).\nIf the source Makefile (and other install system) already takes care of installing for you, they are generally not needed, (extra) files that aren't installed otherwise can be installed by these.\nThe syntax is simply:\npath/sourcedir/file path/installdir\n# for example\ndata/foo.jpg usr/share/packagename\n\nSee http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dother.en.html#install\n--\nLikewise goes for debian/dirs and debian/packagename.dirs which instead creates empty directories:\npath/installdir\n\nIt's normally unnecessary unless you specifically need an empty directory or if there is a problem with the source Makefile...\nSee http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dother.en.html#dirs\n", "Q: Which driver to install for ATI ES1000 graphic card? I am installing 12.04 on an IBM x3250 M2 server. It has an ATI ES1000 with no acceleration (that does not bother me, we don't need it), we use it to connect remotely via FreeNX. \nFreeNX works fine, (except than in Windows 7 machines NX Client shows only icons and no text) but the only resolution I can get in the monitor directly attached to the server is 800x600. The display manager also shows me two monitors, the real one and one IBM 15\". \nWhich driver should I install?. It seems that the ATI driver that comes with Ubuntu does not work properly. Any help will be appreciated.\n\nA: From what I've found on this it looks like most people treat ATI ES1000 as the Radeon 7000.  This is still problematic, however, because their are no drivers around on ATI's website for the Radeon 7000.  That means that this card is legacy (and it even says so on their site).\nSo my recommendation is that you try using the open source X.Org driver.  This can be easily installed by going to the dash and typing Additional Drivers, and then selecting the X.Org open source driver from the list (I believe it is the top one).\nYou can also try installing the latest Catalyst driver, but you may run into the same problem you are having now.

The screen is always on with a login prompt, but because its keyboard is in pretty bad shape, I use it exclusively via ssh. The screen is in a good position, though; I want to use it to display a clock and some stats about what my server is doing. I have scripts to display all those things, but I want to always show them on the monitor screen.\nMy question is, how do I get my script (called HUD) to run on /dev/tty1, instead of the login prompt. Hopefully, it should be possible to accept keyboard input as well as display its output, so that it can use the keyboard to show more info where needed in a future version. I'd also like tty2 etc. to remain active as login screens, in face I actually do need to login locally.\nFor a start, I tried creating a script that I can run from ssh to start the HUD. It goes something like this:\n(\n    flock -n 9\n    watch --interval 0.2 --precise --color --notitle --exec /path/to/script & disown\n) 9> /var/lock/hud > /dev/tty1 2> /dev/tty1 < /dev/tty1\n\n(I had to use & disown instead of nohup because nohup recognized the tty and redirects output to nohup.out instead.)\nThis sort-of works. However, it has a few issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't steal the terminal's keyboard input, so you can't ctrl+c to get out of it (nor change the script to actually use the keyboard input), and if you press enter it show it and scrolls the display, never refreshing it correctly afterwards.\n\n*Oddly, if I disconnect the ssh session which created it, it stops working and shows a message: exec: No such file or directory. If I reconnect to ssh, it resumes functioning properly.\n\n*It feels hackish.\n\n\nIs there a better way to do this? How?\n\nA: I found that indeed there's a simple way. You can quite easily use an init script to create a service that runs on the console. Here's an example.\n$ cat /etc/init/hud.conf\n\nconsole owner\n\npre-start script\n    setterm -powerdown 0 -blank 0\nend script\n\nexec /home/configurator/bin/hud-display\n\npost-stop script\n    clear\n    setterm -blank 2\nend script\n\nThe pre-start and post-stop is only used so that the screen doesn't turn off while this service is running, and will be cleared and reset to my defaults when the service is finished.\n", "Q: VirtualBox Share permissions At the moment I'm running Ubuntu Server 12.04 on top of a VirtualBox running as service in Microsoft Windows7 x64.

Google searching says that the max res is indeed 1280x1024, but I have used it at 1440x900 for over a year now - so yes, it can achieve the laptop's resolution. I think the problem is that it is being reported as the wrong kind of monitor:\n\nThis is incorrect, as it is a 17\" monitor, and it supports way more resolution options that it's displaying.\n\nNow, what can I do to at least work around these issues (I know I need to report a bug or two, but I need to get this fixed as well) and force my monitor to correct resolution?\nP.S. I created a topic for this on the Ubuntu forums (it's just a merry go round, so I came here as a last resort). The suggestion I got is to downgrade to the 295.xx driver - but because of the way nvidia's driver has to be installed, I don't think this is an option unless there is a graphical way to do this.\nYou see, if I switch to a tty (Required for installing), the CRT is disabled.\nCurrent situation:\nI have disabled the laptop screen and written the changes to the xorg.conf. Adding 1440x900 as a meta mode made no difference, because the monitor is still being detected incorrectly. It seems I need the right EDID for this CRT.\nAnyway. Right now, what I would like to do is to have Lightdm use the correct resolution on login (at least 1280x1024). How can change at least this setting?\n\nA: Having just gone through the horror of installing nvidia drivers, I'd venture a guess and say that they didn't install quite right. Some of the symptoms you describe are similar to what I battled.\nI Couldn't get the drivers to function properly using the nvidia-drivers package. I had to do a binary install.

I've posted an answer that you can use to manually create an entry, but as stated it isn't recomended as I'm sure that there's a better way to do it.\n\nA: I've patched together a way to do it, but it's not the recommended way of creating a .desktop entry (there's has to be a better way of doing it).\n1) Open Gedit from the Terminal with root privileges usind gksu gedit\n2) Open a .desktop file from /usr/share/applications and copy it into a new file.\n3) Edit the name, comments, and image to your liking.\n4) Change the command to java -jar %u DO NOT FORGET THE %u\n5) Save\n6) Right click .jar file in nautilus, select properties>open with>show all applications, and select the new entry, select either add or set as default.\n\nA: Just for the record, there's an easier way to fix this. \nAfter installing OpenJDK Java 7, if you go to /usr/share/applications there is already a .desktop file for openjdk, all you need to do is change the bottom line \n\"NoDisplay=true\" to \"NoDisplay=false\"\n\nAnd it will show up in the default programs lists. \nSorry to jack your post like that. \n\nA: I use this method too and the wikihow article missed two things.  Not sure if this will solve your problem since I never run anything by double clicking .jars, but worth a try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Slave all the Java binaries (javac, javaw, etc) to the main java binary in your update-alternatives --install command.  Without doing that, only the java binary is linked into /usr/bin/java, none of the others are.  (I think wikihow assumes that if they're in $JAVA_HOME and $JAVA_HOME/bin is in the path the system will find them, but not sure about that).  This also makes it much easier to uninstall, since you only have to update-alternatives --remove-all java, and all the slaved binaries are automatically included.\n\n*Set the priority higher, not lower, than gij-4.6 and anything else listed, so the system will default to that instead.  They set the priority to 1, which is lowest/last the way update-alternatives works.  Yours needs to be at least 1047 or higher.  I use 1100.\nI've scripted the install, try this one and modify the directory locations for your setup (I use /opt/java/jdk/1.7.0_6 instead of /usr/local/java).\nOne note - the last line of the script installs the man pages as /usr/share/man/man.10.  Before running the script, make sure to check /usr/share/man and ensure there's not already a man.10 in there.  If there is, change the line in the script to man.11 or whatever the next highest number is.\n\nA: I just figured this out: go to /usr/share/applications and look for the file 'defaults.list'. Open this file with gedit or your editor and go to line 81, where it says: application/x-jar=file-roller.desktop, and the next line for the java-archive. Change the file-roller.desktop in both lines to: openjdk-7-java.desktop and save the file. The next time you want to run a .jar file you can double-click it.\n", "Q: Default program for opening .pro Qt project files I would like to set Qt Creator (the one which is in the Nokia Qt SDK, not the one in Canonical PPAs) as the default program to open .pro Qt project files. But it appears that my Ubuntu install (12.04 while I am writing the question) recognizes .pro files as plain text files instead of Qt project files.

The steps above are provided by air-dex in a comment.\n\n\n*\n\n*Write an XML file like the shinythings-shiny.xml file in the xdg-mime man page (http://linux.die.net/man/1/xdg-mime). The type can be called, for example, \"text/qt-project-file\". Set the  pattern to \"*.pro\". Add a  tag saying that the custom MIME type is a subtype of text/plain too.\n\n*Execute the following command : sudo xdg-mime install <path to XML file>. Sudo must be used.\n\n*Select the default program just like explained above.\n\n\nThese steps can be used for any file extension.

Reinstalling sudo did not fix it, either -- https://askubuntu.com/a/46459/42720 \nRecently upgraded to 12.04; no other problems with the upgrade.\nAny ideas?  Thanks\n\nA: The problem probably is that the sudo you are running is probably different from the system's sudo.\nThis is (probably) a user configuration.\nFIRST: Check if using /usr/bin/sudo works ok, to test that hipotesis.\nIF IT DOES: Then either you are using another binary, or an alias\nUSING ANOTHER BINARY: Users can make different versions of system binaries to use (usually, they are just scripts). To check for that possibility, run which sudo. This will tell you the location of the sudo you are running. IF it says /usr/bin/sudo, then we exclude this possibility. If something else, that is probably the problem\nUSING AN ALIAS: an alias is a lightweight way to personalize commands. Instead of writing a binary, you make a small alteration, such as adding an option. This is done in configuration scripts for BASH, the program that reads the commands.\nTo check for that, type alias and see if sudo appears on the list. If it does, then this is probably the problem. Use find ~/ -maxdepth 1 -size -20k -exec grep -H 'alias sudo.*' {} \\; to find the file that is setting up the alias (Some common guesses would be: ~/.bashrc ; ~/.bash_profile ;  ~/.bash_login and ~/.profile ).\nIf you cant find the file, use find ~/ -size -20k -exec grep -H 'alias sudo.*' {} \\; instead, to look at all of your user's files.

Most probably your GPS device has that icon and it is configured to show that icon upon autostart.\n\nWhy does Nautilus use it instead of the plain drive icon? \n\nBecause the device has the necessary icon and configuration file and nautilus is configured to show icon when it finds one.\n\nIs there a way to have give each of my drives a custom icon -- so that when I stick in my various flash drives, they have a distinctive icon (i.e. a 'favicon.ico' file on root or such?)\n\nYes. You need to create a autorun.inf and the icon to be displayed in the root of the flash drive or internal drive.\nThe autorun.inf file content should be as follows: I assume the name of the icon is \"games.svg\".\n[autorun]\nicon=games.svg\n\nThat's it.

It should also work on older versions.\nHere is a screenshot of my nautilus with custom icon\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu not booting properly I just bought an Asus EeePC with Ubuntu 12.04 installed on it.

It seems it is being intercepted by KWin. \nIs there any fix or workaround for this problem?\n\nA: The reason Ctrl-F4 doesn't work in KDE is because KWin uses the same keyboard shortcut for switching between workspaces.

I'm trying  to reinstall ubuntu to my second hd with a live cd but when I use the partioning tool it shows the second drive as /dev/sdg. That is not what I expected. I had asked a question before and from what they had said I was expecting ?dev/sdc,,,does it make any difference?\n\nA: Normally the first few hard disks would appear in sequence (/dev/sda for the first, /dev/sdb` for the second, etc).\nA likely source of extra entries are card readers - there appears to be a variety of card reader architectures, some of which emulate an open USB port when no media is inserted, and some which emulate an empty device. In the latter case, you may have a number of /dev/sdX devices corresponding to card readers.\nYou can look in gparted (graphical partitioning tool) or use dmesg | grep sda in a terminal to look for information about how your system detected each disk. For a hard disk, you should see some lines like:\n[    2.877980] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] 3907029168 512-byte logical blocks: (2.00 TB/1.81 TiB)\n\n(indicating /dev/sda is a 2TB hard disk).

We have more than 50 systems previously running Windows XP & Windows 7. After the release of 12.04 we decided to switch to Ubuntu. While we were installing Ubuntu 12.04 on Pentium 4 systems we have faced some issues. \nWe tried it with a USB flash driver & CD. \nThe typical configuration of the system is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pentium 4 with HT & 512 MB RAM,\n\n*40/80 GB IDE / SATA HDD.\nIn windows there were several partitions and data on all the drives in all the systems. We have addressed this by taking backup of the C: drive on other drives & while installing Ubuntu we have just deleted & the C drive & recreated Linux partitions as follows - /root , /Boot, /Home & Swap.(in 10 GB) \nThe problem is that the Linux gets installed without any error. However when I restart the system after the installation the system hangs in while detecting the HDD in BIOS and  the system fails to start until I remove the HDD. \nWhen I installed the previous Ubuntu version it worked fine, without any hassle. Also if we install Ubuntu 12.04 on same HDD on any other higher capacity system & reconnected to old system it works fine. How can I fix this problem?\nAlso, is there is any Antivirus which will give me real time protection on ubuntu 11 & higher versions with both 32 & 64 Bits?\n\nA: To answer your second question, you may want to try out Clam (available from the Software Center) or Avast.

Is it possible to build packages and uploading them to the launchpad through the Ubuntu based Linux operating systems?\nMy intention or requirement behind this question is to have a very light Ubuntu based system and have to upload packages from that system, is it possible?\n\nA: Uploading a package to a launchpad personal archive is indeed designed to be done from an Ubuntu system (it would be surprising if it required a different platform). Only command-line tools are required which hopefully satisfy the requirements for a lightweight system.\nPackaging/PPA/Uploading explains the process, using the dput tool.\n\nA: If you're just going to use a lightweight install of Ubuntu without the desktop packages, then yes, it is possible to create packages and upload to Launchpad. You'd need to have at least dput and build-essential packages installed in order to be able to build and upload packages. Preferably you'd also need devscripts, ubuntu-dev-tools and pbuilder in addition to build packages.\nIf you're going to use an Ubuntu-based distribution instead of Ubuntu, like Mint or something, then you need to ensure that the distribution you are using has the required packages (like dput for uploading and build-essential, devscripts and pbuilder for building) in order to build and upload packages.\nYou'll also have to set up dput according to the instructions here.\n", "Q: How do I patch a kernel bug?

I'm very new to Ubuntu and I want to know: what is the exact use of /etc/hosts? \nLets say I'm adding this into it :\n127.0.x.x mydomain\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nA: \nPurpose\nThe hosts file is one of several system facilities that assists in addressing network nodes in a computer network. It is a common part of an operating system's Internet Protocol (IP) implementation, and serves the function of translating human-friendly hostnames into numeric protocol addresses, called IP addresses, that identify and locate a host in an IP network.\nIn some operating systems, the hosts file's content is used preferentially to other methods, such as the Domain Name System (DNS), but many systems implement name service switches (e.g., nsswitch.conf for Linux and Unix) to provide customization. Unlike the DNS, the hosts file is under the direct control of the local computer's administrator\nFile content\nThe hosts file contains lines of text consisting of an IP address in the first text field followed by one or more host names. Each field is separated by white space (blanks or tabulation characters). Comment lines may be included; they are indicated by a hash character (#) in the first position of such lines. Entirely blank lines in the file are ignored. For example, a typical hosts file may contain the following:\n# This is an example of the hosts file\n\n127.0.0.1  localhost loopback\n::1        localhost\n\nThis example only contains entries for the loopback addresses of the system and their host names, a typical default content of the hosts file. The example illustrates that an IP address may have multiple host names, and that a host name may be mapped to several IP addresses.\n\nWikipedia\n\nThis is invalid (?):\n127.0.x.x mydomain\n\nWildcards are * so it should be 127.0.*.* but I hardly see anything else than 127.0.0.1 ;)\n\nWhat this means is that you can use mydomain as a name for that IP address. It is easier to use www.google.com than to remember the IP address (74.125.132.106) that Google uses for their searchengine. The same works locally (localhost) on your machine. If you run your own Apache instance you can set a local IP address to a name and  use that name in a browser.\n\nThe ::1 in the example is the IP v6 version for IP addresses.\n\nA: It means that the system will not do a DNS lookup for mydomain, it will be automatically redirected to the IP address you specified in your hosts file. \nOn most systems the default entry in the hosts file is:\n127.0.0.1    localhost\n\n127.0.0.1 is always the address of the computer you're on. For example, if you run a web server on your pc, you can access it from the web browser via the http://localhost:port instead of typing the whole IP address http://127.0.0.1:port.\n", "Q: laptop to external monitor via vga cable not working My laptop is the Toshiba satellite c850-F31Q (with these specs:http://www.laptopdirect.co.za/laptop_specifications.php?laptop=59683)(AMD Radeon graphics card).\nIt is running Linux-Ubuntu-gnome 3 (and Windows 7; dual boot)\nUrgently need to know how to connect it via VGA  to -\nExternal LG monitor (works great in Windows).\nPlease could you help.\n\nA: Go to the display settings, and make sure that the second monitor is not turned off, and that \"Mirror Displays\" is not checked.\n\n\nA: Press the function key and switch from lcd to screen (you will see a symbol on your keyboard) this applies if you are using a laptop.\n\nA: have you tried ton install proprietary drivers? this is how you do that:\ngo to system settings, now click 'Software & Updates' go to the 'additional drivers' tab.\nhere you should be able to select one or more drivers for your card.\nhowever...\nIn the little experience with ATI cards I think the proprietary drivers are not always stable. prepare for some trouble shouting and back up all your files (if you cannot boot anymore you can in case of emergency reinstall).\n", "Q: Why can't dash search find a program by its full name?

I like Ubuntu in many ways, but still I have a number of problems when coping with my day-to-day work in Ubuntu.\nWaiting for your answers with fingers crossed!\n\nA: \nI have a number of problems when coping with my day-to-day work\n\nPerhaps you should first try to get help for your other problems, and then had no need to install Windows anymore. What are your problems with the every-day work in Ubuntu?\nAnyway, if you definitely want Windows, you should find out how to boot the CD. Normally, you should see some popup when booting that says \" Boot selection\" or similar, where key is F2, F8, F11, F12 or something else. Try that one and then select your CD-/DVD-Drive in the next dialogue.\n", "Q: How to access Ubuntu Server from local PC? Today I installed my first web server, which is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nI got Apache, PHP and MySql working, there is even MyPHPAdmin! Everything is working fine on that PC, but the problem is that I have no idea how to connect to this server from my PC.\nJust to clarify- I got one PC that I work on and got another one, which has Ubuntu Server running. I even managed to connect them through the router, which I made to work as a switch. I can see the Ubuntu Server on my Windows PC in \"Network\", but it's empty, I can't see any files.\nI tried to share a folder etc/www on Server, but it shows an error saying something about right, that I'm not this folder's owner. I guess I'm not doing the right thing at all, am I? Even if I could see shared folder on my Windows PC- I would still be not able to type \"somedomain.com\" on Windows PC and access for example index.php or MySql database.\nSo, the question is- how do I configure Ubuntu Server to be accessible from Windows PC? \n\nA: Ensure you have OpenSSH installed on your server, you can install it with sudo apt-get install openssh-server. For future installations, you get a menu during installation of the server with different choices. Lamp, openssh, MySQL etc. If you mark openssh you're good to go after installation. \nFurthermore, if the computer you want to access from runs windows, download a program called putty. \nIf it runs any distro of linux you can use the terminal. sudo apt-get install openssh-client. The syntax for accessing the server from your terminal is like this ssh my-user-name@my-server-ip. If you have a domain associated with the IP you can replace the IP with the domain.\nHope this helps\n\nA: First of all ensure that Apache is running. To make sure, type ps -A | grep 'httpd' Any output is good, nothing means it isn't running.\nAfter you have made sure that Apache is running, you have to take note of the server's IP address inside your network. If your server is connected to the network via a wired connection ifconfig eth0 and search for inetaddress. Note it down.\nPicture of the above (I am demonstrating my wireless connection, because I am on a notebook and the wireless interface is assigned an IP address, but it should be the same for a wired connection, only the interface should be eth0 or eth1, depending on how many wired network interfaces your computer has):\n\nNOTE: Make sure you are checking a wired interface if your computer uses a wired connection, or a wireless if it is wirelessly connected. ifconfig -eth0 is good to check the wired connectivity, ifconfig -wlan0 is the wireless one. If none of the above are producing output, check ifconfig\nThen just open a web browser, example: Chrome and type in the address bar the server's ip address followed by the port your apache server is running (default: port 80)\nExample:\n\nIf you have set up everything properly, while doing the above, your server should respond like this, provided that you have not configured apache to serve a webpage, by storing its files in /var/www.\n\n\nA: You can connect your ubuntu server from windows machine using ssh protocol. For that you need to have putty on your windows machine. \nFor file transfer you can use WinSCP.\nEnsure that you are running ssh server daemon on Ubuntu server.\n\nA: Actually I found pretty simple solution.\nfirst if you don't have an open shh type in sudo tasksel and install openSsh server\nsecond go to your router's settings >>>advanced>NAT>DMZ server and than simply type in local IP of your server, hit apply and works perfectly fine. You can even donwload it on your phone and access it with password and username. To connect you will however need your external IP. If you don't know it type in curl ifconfig.me\nHope my anwser is helpful.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu 12.04 on MacBook Pro? How to install Ubuntu 12.04 on a MacBook Pro?\nI just bought one and I want to install Ubuntu alongside Mac OS X. I have tried the same way as with Windows, but it seems the Mac cannot recognize the Ubuntu CD.\n\nA: It sounds like you might have bought the latest MacBook Pro, which is the 10,1 model.  People are still investigating how to get Ubuntu working completely on that hardware, so I would not recommend installing Ubuntu on it unless you know what you're doing and want to make a serious time commitment.  \nHere's the link to the relevant Ubuntu help page:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro10-1/Precise  There's a link to the forum thread where people are working on the hardware issues.  There's also instructions on how to find out what model you have and a link to a directory of help pages for the older models.  \nNow to specifically answer your question...The general instructions for installing a dual-boot from the Ubuntu cd are here.  It involves installing rEFIt.  I expect it will work for you, but as I said above, the real problem may be afterwards, when trying to get all the hardware to work.\n", "Q: Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Finger I´am trying to use this Finger.java for my Android project,\nBut I get this error.\n$java Finger username@host.com\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Finger\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Finger\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:217)\n    at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:205)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:321)\n    at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:294)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:266)\nCould not find the main class: Finger.

Typically, when you build your program, all the .java files in its source code are compiled. Integrated development environments like Eclipse ensures this happens, but you can do this from the command-line as well.\nHow you'll do it depends on whether or not you're using an automated build system (such as Ant or SCons). If you're not using an automated build system, you can still often build from the command-line with a single invocation of the javac command; the manpage for your javac implementation details how (run man javac). Since this is not the focus of your question, I won't go into any more detail here about how to build a Java application from multiple source code files.\nSince any .java source code file will need to be compiled before it can be run, and you want to run Finger as a standalone program, you will have to first compile it:\njavac Finger.java\n\nThen you can run it:\njava Finger\n\nThat's actually running the file called Finger.class that is created from compiling Finger.java with javac as detailed above. The java command cannot execute Java source code.\n", "Q: Ubuntu swappiness I have a laptop with 4 GB RAM and i3 processor. It runs very fast when I use windows, but it keeps slowing down on my Ubuntu when I use it continuously. I noticed that 500mb+ swap is getting used even if only 20% of RAM is only used, and I have a doubt that this is the reason for the slowness. I have already set the swappiness value to 10. Then how else can I change it? I spend most of my time in Ubuntu so this is very important for me.\n\nA: Use this command to confirm that your change is being used (i.e., that it was saved permanently):\ncat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n\nAlso, maybe the swap FAQ will help.\n\nA: If you have enough memory, for e.g. your 4 gb, swappines will have no impact to system performance at all, because in that configuration most likely your system wont swap at all (or just to reserve mem-space). if you have few memory swappines may have impact to system performance. But its kind of a religious question with endless debates which value should be recommended. Alan Cox recommends a value near by 100. Other Kernel-Hackers recommends very lower values (the ubuntu default of 10 is often recommended). But from my experience it does not make a feelable difference in performance at all. So you could leave it by ubuntu default value (60) or choose the ubuntu recommended 10 for desktop systems.\n", "Q: Why are some 7digital songs not available in the Ubuntu One Music Store? Not all of the music from 7digital is available in the Ubuntu One Music Store.\nAs an example: The band \"I am empire\" is not listed but if I search the same in the 7digital store, I can find it.\nSo what's the reason for that?\n\nA: Unfortunately, running the Ubuntu One Music Store is not quite as simple as reselling the entire 7digital catalogue: you will only see a particular song in the U1MS if we have permission to sell it in your region, and our set of licenses is not as extensive as 7digital's.\nThe music industry is still breaks up the world into separate regions for the purpose of marketing and licensing, so the selection of songs we offer differs from country to country too.  The following FAQ entry describes which labels we have distribution agreements with in the different regions:\nhttps://one.ubuntu.com/help/faq/what-regions-of-the-world-are-able-to-purchase-songs/\nSo presumably the song you are after is outside of any of the existing distribution agreements.\n", "Q: What are these files in my /dev directory? I know that most devices are presented in the /dev directory, but only now have I actually noticed two very strange, yet familiar names in there...\nI'm talking about stdin@ and stdout@ down there:\n\nWhat are these for? Are they used by functions of the C language?\n\nA: These files are actually called stdin, stdout and stderr. The @ character is added by ls to tell you that they are symbolic links. ls -l would reveal that the targets of these symbolic links are /proc/self/fd/0, /proc/self/fd/1 and /proc/self/fd/2.\n/proc is a virtual filesystem provided by the kernel that shows information about the operating system. Among other things, there are directories like /proc/1234 that contain information about the process with ID 1234. /proc/self is a symbolic link to the directory for whatever process is accessing it (the kernel returns a different target to different processes).\n/proc/self/fd (which is also symlinked at /dev/fd) contains one entry per file that the process has open. Each entry corresponds to a file descriptor and is a symbolic link to the file (if possible — for pipes, sockets and deleted files, the symbolic link gives information that's useful for debugging but does not point to a file that you could reopen by name). These file descriptors are the same that you manipulate with C functions such as open, close, dup, read, write, etc. They are not used by the C functions, they're other ways to interact with the same objects.\nThe reason /dev/stdin and friends exist is that sometimes a program requires a file name, but you want to tell it to use a file that's already open (a pipe, for instance). So you can pass /dev/stdin to tell the program to read its standard input.\nFurther reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*file descriptor vs. file name\n\n*file descriptors and /dev/fd\n\n*How does /dev/fd relate to /proc/self/fd/?\n\n*Understanding /dev and its subdirs and files\n\n*How to include program which only works with in/out files into a pipeline?\n", "Q: How to change uTorrent's port from 8080 to another one?

Is it possible to capture packets without superuser? \nThis is what I see in the wikipedia article:\n\nIn some Unix-like operating systems, a user must have superuser privileges to use tcpdump because the packet capturing mechanisms on those systems require elevated privileges. However, the -Z option may be used to drop privileges to a specific unprivileged user after capturing has been set up. In other Unix-like operating systems, the packet capturing mechanism can be configured to allow non-privileged users to use it; if that is done, superuser privileges are not required.\n  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcpdump\n\n\nA: It is possible to capture packets without being root, but you need to have the CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_NET_RAW capabilities. Basically you have to become root (so that you get all of the capabilities), then drop all of your capabilities except for those two, and drop root privileges too.\nFor managing the user ID that UNIX commands run as there are convenient tools like sudo.

And is there a way to configure rotation with fingers, like Wacom shows is possible with this tablet?\nYour answers will be greatly appreciated, I'm quite at a loss here!\n\nA: Here's a short overview of what I used to set up my Wacom tablet in Ubuntu. (cfr. also this blog post of mine on setting up a Wacom tablet in Ubuntu).\n1. Device names\nxsetwacom --list devices\n\ngives you the names of your devices.\nIn my case the result is:\nWacom Intuos Pro M Pen stylus    id: 14 type: STYLUS   \nWacom Intuos Pro M Pen eraser    id: 15 type: ERASER   \nWacom Intuos Pro M Pen cursor    id: 16 type: CURSOR   \nWacom Intuos Pro M Pen pad       id: 17 type: PAD     \nWacom Intuos Pro M Finger touch  id: 18 type: TOUCH\n\n2. Parameters\nxsetwacom --list parameters\n\ngives you a long list of parameters you can use, with a brief explanation of what they mean. The parameter \"Button\" for instance will be used to assign a key to a button (or \"express key\" as Wacom calls it).\n3. Modifiers\nxsetwacom  --list modifiers\n\ngives you the list of modifiers (keys really) you can set the parameters to. The modifier \"PgDn\" for instance will be used to set a button (\"express key\") to act as if you press the \"PageDown\" button on your keyboard.\n4. Mapping buttons\nWith this knowledge, you can construct the following type of commands:\nxsetwacom set \"Wacom Intuos Pro M Pen pad\" Button 2 key \"b\"\n\nThe above example would set \"button 2\" to the key \"b\".\nYou can find the numbers of the buttons as follows.\nThe mappings for all supported tablets can be found in the /usr/share/libwacom/ directory. There are text files in the main directory that use a *.tablet extension naming convention. The buttons for the Intuos Pro are designated with alphabetical labels where A=Button 1, B=Button 2, etc.\nThe subdirectory located in /usr/share/libwacom/layouts/ contains vector image files that display a graphical depictions of the tablets and the button assignments. These *.svg files should be opened with Inkscape or another application capable of displaying scalable vector graphics files.\nNote that these commands will have to be entered at every new login.\nMore info on xsetwacom on the linuxwacom wiki.\n", "Q: Create windows XP's live USB using ubuntu My hard disk crashed..

If I have turned off execute permissions on hello.sh and try to execute it \n~$ sudo chmod 0666 hello.sh\n~$ ./hello.sh\n-bash: ./hello.sh: Permission denied\n\nI get the permission error.  But I can easily override that by using the . or source builtin.\n$ . hello.sh\nhello everyone\n\nWhat's the purpose of setting the execute permission on a file if someone can override it using the source builtin?\nhello.sh\n#!/bin/bash\necho 'hello everyone'\n\n\nA: There is a difference: if you execute the script like ./script.sh, you are creating a new process, a new instance of the bash shell. This is denied.\nHowever, since the permissions allow you to read the script, what's there to stop you from copy and paste all it contents? The source build-in does only that: it executes the commands one by one by reading them from a text file.\n\nA: When you run ./hello.sh, you tell the kernel to execute the program hello.sh. If you have execution permission, then the kernel reads the first few bytes of the file, sees the #! line so it knows that this is a script, and runs the interpreter (/bin/bash), passing it the script name as its first argument. Then bash treats the file as a series of instructions. If you don't have execute permission, the kernel aborts the execution at the first step.\nWhen you run . hello.sh or source hello.sh, you aren't asking the kernel to execute hello.sh. You're asking bash to read the file hello.sh and interpret it as a series of instructions.\nIt's the same thing if you run bash hello.sh, by the way: you aren't executing hello.sh, you're having it interpreted by bash (which is being executed).

I left some unallocated space on that second drive that I would like to convert to a ntfs partition. Using g parted would I just select the unallocated space and convert it to a primary partition?  \n\nA: (Unedited answer to original question that only mentioned 'free space' ; later edited to specify it was in fact 'unallocated space')\nEven though there is a certain ammount of free space on a drive, it doesn't mean no files are located on the outside portion of your disk where you'd like to create a new partition. Simply put free space gets fragmented and what you see in GParted or any other partition editor is just a chart that represents the percentages of free and occupied space on each partition. \nWhat it means in practice is that creating a new partition in your case will involve some data movement thus putting the whole operation under the risk of data loss*, so make sure you make a backup copy of your most important data before you proceed.\n\n\n*\nSome operations done by partition editors require the partition editor to move some data around. In such a case there's a risk of data loss in case of e.g. power loss. The risk of data loss due to factors other than power loss and partition editor crash is very small. It's fastest and safest to perform partition operations on a clean disk.\n\nThe procedure to get what you want in GParted (I recommend using Parted Magic bootable USB/CD):\n0. Back up your data*\n 1. Resize your existing partition leaving X megabytes of free space, where X equals the intended size of your new partition.\n2. Create the new partition in place of the unallocated space you got after completing step 1.\n\nConclusion:\nCreating new partition on a disk with free space involves some data moving done by partition editor*, while creating new partition on unallocated space does not involve data moving - creating new partition on unallocated space is hassle-free and instant.\n", "Q: Having issues using fdisk and GParted with Lexar 64GB USB, but reading and writing is fine I have recently bought a new 64GB Lexar USB with the long model name of LJDV10-64G-000-106, and I am having issues partitioning it.

I decided to delete 3.4.0.0 and use the kernel ubuntu provided by default.\n", "Q: Unknown Folder on System root /.rpmdb Can somebody explain what the /.rpmdb folder in the root directory is for? Which application creates it and is using it?\n\nA: I can't say definitively what creates this directory, but it is likely that it is created either as a side effect of installing third-party Linux kernel drivers such as NVIDIA or VirtualBox using DKMS, or by some other unsupported installer script not provided by Ubuntu. This directory was most probably created as a side effect of an install process that happens to support both rpm-based and deb-based distributions. DKMS happens to be such an install script and can definitely create this directory under the right conditions. The directory can safely be deleted without harming your system, but it may be created again when updates are installed later. See bug #1069350 for an open bug report tracking this issue.\nThat's the short answer, now some more detail.\nWhat is .rpmdb?\nAs you may know, rpm is a software packaging format and set of tools for installing packages and maintaining the database of installed packages and their interdependencies. It is used by many distributions but not by Ubuntu and other deb-based distributions. Unfortunately for Ubuntu, however, any use of the rpm command requires a valid \"rpmdb\" database to exist or to be created.\nOn rpm-based distributions this is not a problem because they have a system-wide rpmdb by definition. On Ubuntu systems, since there is no need for a system-wide rpm database, rpm is configured to use a database under each user's home directory, specifically $HOME/.rpmdb. This database is silently created as needed whenever rpm runs. Since it is in each user's home directory, there are no problems with shared permissions or requiring the database to be created by an administrator. Every user just gets their own private empty rpm database.\nWhy would rpm be run at all on Ubuntu?\nIt turns out that some projects like to create install scripts that will work on any distribution, whether that distribution is rpm-based, deb-based, or neither. DKMS is one such project, it allows third-party drivers to be built for whatever Linux kernel a system happens to be running, and it is written to work across distributions. In part of its logic to determine which distribution it is running on and which kernel version is present, it executes an rpm command to query the database. As I explained earlier, this will silently create a .rpmdb directory if one does not already exist in the current user's home directory. The database query should fail, since Ubuntu is not an rpm-based distribution, and DKMS continues on.\nIf you install any additional Linux kernel driver packages from Ubuntu such as VirtualBox, NVIDIA, ndiswrapper, or openswan, you are probably using DKMS to install those drivers for your kernel. This is typically done automatically when the driver is installed from the Ubuntu repositories. So any time either a kernel or driver update is installed, DKMS runs again to rebuild the driver for all available kernel versions. It has been shown that when those packages are updated, the /root/.rpmdb directory does in fact appear, which is in root's home directory since root is required to install updates.\nI don't know of any other specific third-party installation scripts that may also execute rpm commands as a way of detecting the distribution type, but it's certainly possible. For example, you may want to install LargeProprietaryProgram from Initech, and to do so you run an install.sh script as root. This script may try to query an rpm database to see if you're running an rpm-based distribution, and /root/.rpmdb is created again.\nSo that explains why you may see /home/user/.rpmdb and /root/.rpmdb directories show up on your system. But why in the system root directory?\nWhy is .rpmdb created in the root directory?\nThe easiest explanation for this is that the $HOME environment variable is unset somehow in some process context that runs rpm. Let's use DKMS for the sake of argument because we definitively know it can run rpm commands. Because it typically runs when packages are installed or updated, it runs in the environment of whatever package manager you happen to use. If you use sudo apt-get to install packages, it will inherit a correct $HOME. If you use PackageKit, it may not have a $HOME variable at all. I am not sure what environment is provided by Synaptic or Ubuntu Software Center.\nSo if DKMS is running in an environment that does not have a $HOME variable, and because of the way the rpm database was defined, an empty rpm database will be created in /.rpmdb instead of /root/.rpmdb. This has been fixed in the rpm package for Ubuntu in the 14.10 development version, so it should now create /root/.rpmdb even if $HOME is not defined.\nI hope this explains why there are directories called .rpmdb at all on an Ubuntu system, why they may get created seemingly automatically, and why one can be created in the root directory under the right set of conditions. It's nothing to worry about, there is nothing malicious in the existence of this directory, and it can simply be deleted if its presence is offensive to aesthetics or security scanners.\n\nA: RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) is a package management system. It RPM was originally written in 1997 by Erik Troan and Marc Ewing for use in Red Hat Linux, but now is used in many GNU/Linux distributions.\nWorking behind the scenes of the package manager is the RPM database (RPMDB), stored in /var/lib/rpm. It consists of a single database (Packages) containing all of the meta information of the installed rpms. The database is used to keep track of all files that are changed and created when a user (using RPM) installs a package, thus enabling the user (via RPM) to reverse the changes and remove the package later.\n\nReference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager\n", "Q: Where to install boot loader on a Zenbook Prime?

The second thing is that the disk is formatted using a GPT partitioning scheme and not the older MBR (Master Boot Record) based one.\nThis is the reason why there is an EFI System Partition (ESP) on /dev/sda1 on the Zenbook.\nThe boot-loader should be installed on the EFI partition (/dev/sda1).\nAlso you need to boot your Ubuntu-disk or USB-stick in UEFI-mode (as you did), since otherwise the installer will apparently be confused and install GRUB to the MBR instead of the EFI partition (it seems to me that the installer should be smarter and detect what kind of disk we have, regardless of how the installation medium was booted, but maybe there's a technical limitation somewhere?).\nFinally as a workaround it is also possible to add a custom entry to GRUB which points to the right EFI file.\n\n\n*\n\n*First do sudo blkid and look up the UUID of the EFI partition (/dev/sda1)\n\n*Do sudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom\n\n*Add the following entry to the file:\n\n\n\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\ninsmod part_gpt\ninsmod ntfs\ninsmod search_fs_uuid\ninsmod chain\nsearch --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root 20B1-C9F3\nchainloader (${root})/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nWhere you replace \"20B1-C9F3\" with the UUID you looked up in step 1.\nSave the file and then run sudo update-grub2.\nAfter rebooting you will see your new entry which should work now.\nIf you want to remove the other broken GRUB entries from the menu you can easily do it using the grub-customizer program from the repos.\n", "Q: Will the upcoming \"Gnomebuntu\" be an official variant?

(also sounds like it could increase quality) can any one explain what these do ?.\nAs for output driver I use vdpau is this best for nvidia cards ?\nAny other suggestions welcome.\nThanks.\n\nA: Using vdpau with Nvidia cards should get you great performance with smplayer, and will ensure that you use very little cpu when playing dvds and x264 encoded video. As has been discussed in detail on the Ubuntu forums, it is very important to note that\n\nVdpau is two things. One, a display device, like xv. The other, a codec that can use the PureVideo chip to decode certain files \n\nsuch as mpeg1/2 and x264. If your card supports it (see here for a list of supported gpus) it is a better option than the old xv, and particularly xll, which will use considerably more cpu.\nIn smplayer there are some options that can be accessed via the configure button next to the vdpau option (see screenshot), but you usually don't have to fiddle with these unless you have any problems with the video performance.\nNOTE: It is particularly important to note that when vdpau codecs such as ffh264vdpau are being utilised, none of the following smplayer gui options such as post-processing, deinterlace, etc, will have any effect. In the screenshot you can also see that 'disable software video filters' is checked when you click the vdpau properties. \nHowever, as noted in the Mplayer manual special options such as deint can be passed on the command-line when using vdpau, although these are not usually needed; these special options are not supported in the smplayer gui. \nvdpau (with -vc ffmpeg12vdpau, ffwmv3vdpau, ffvc1vdpau, ffh264vdpau  or\n       ffodivxvdpau)\n       Video output that uses VDPAU to decode video via hardware.

All modes > 0 re-\n                      spect -field-dominance.\n\nAs has been shown at this forum discussion,\ndeint is a option for the video out (vdpau) not for the codec\n\nand so to specify one of these special options  (where vo is video output and  vc is video codec), you could use the following command (taken from the forum above):\nmplayer -vo vdpau:deint=1 -vc ffh264vdpau 00007.MTS\n\nSo, when using vdpau you don't really need to worry about these special options or any other settings in the smplayer gui such as post-processing or direct rendering that you can't normally apply anyway when using vdpau.\n\n\nA: Just to contribute to Mik's answer, you can use vdpau in smplayer and turn on deinterlacing by adding the command line arguments in the SMPlayer preferences menu.\nPreferences > Advanced > Options for MPlayer\nIn the Options box, add the command line arguments you want. e.g.\n-vo vdpau:deint=1\n\n", "Q: What changed with timidity, alsa and jack in 11.10?

I've tried to find out myself with no luck. \n\nA: If you installed Kubuntu over Ubuntu - not side-by-side, but as a replacement - your old Grub settings are lost.  Unless you told it otherwise during installation, Kubuntu wiped out the old Grub and installed its own - with its own defaults - and so now you have what you have.  You can again adjust it to be what you want, of course, following instructions given in other answers here.\nIf you installed Kubuntu next to Ubuntu, then it did the same thing, but your old Grub settings are still saved in your Ubuntu installation.  In this case, if you boot into Ubuntu and reinstall Grub from there, you will find that Grub will pick up your saved settings and be restored to how you had it before (except that now Kubuntu will also be listed as a boot option).\nBy the way, I find this annoying.  On one of my computers I usually have three versions of Linux installed: the current Ubuntu, the alpha or beta of the next version, and one other just for learning and/or experimenting (currently Tuquito).

Why is \"oh, I need new keys? Cool, go get new keys\" not just defeating the purpose of having a signed repository in the first place? Are the keys signed by a master key that apt-key checks? Should we be doing some additional validation to ensure that we're getting legitimate keys?\n\nA: Relevant basic concepts about the idea behind GPG signature and how it ensures a more secure signed repository:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are the GPG signatures?\n\n\nIn my opinion, the proposed fixes aren't secure. A more secure solution would be to blow out everything in /var/lib/apt/lists/ as suggested in this answer. I suggest this because, apt automatically checks for the integrity of the package and is a much hassle-free solution compared to hunting down each of the keys.\nThat doesn't mean you shouldn't manually add the keys, but only if you know how to check if the keys are valid. Some ways of checking the integrity of the package / validity of the key:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cross checking if the GPG key is already listed in releases.gpg file. If it already is available, you can be rest assured that the key is secure because only the keys of trusted developers are included in the releases.gpg file. \n\n*install debsig-verify package (manpage for the debsig-verify command ). It automatically verifies the source and the validity of the Debian package itself. Though, you might run into weird problems from time to time since debsig-verify checks for signatures embedded inside of Debian packages, something that is not widely practised since the advent of secure-apt.\n\n\nSo, the accepted solution at What is the easiest way to resolve apt-get BADSIG GPG errors? is not exactly recommended nor secure for the average Joe, as he would probably have neither the time, patience or awareness to check if the solution is secure enough for him.

In this building my wifi often breaks down and then restores connection again. This is really irritating since it happens a lot.\nNow as a coincidence there were some tech guys running around here and where asking everyone if the wifi was doing fine. I told them that my wifi tears down all the time and then reconnects. They figured out that my wifi is switching all the time between the 2.4 GHz channel and 5 GHz channel. They asked me if I could acces the driver settings of my wireless card. Unfortunately I don't know how to do this is in either Linux or Windows. And unfortunately again they only knew the windows solution xD.\nSo I hope somebody can tell me how I tell my wifi that it should stay on the 5 GHz network and not disconnect and switch to the 2.4 GHz channel?\n-edit-\n@arhimed, firstly thank you for your help.\nI just tried what you said. It is some what different for me. I can't seem to save the settings when I change the setting and choose to use only the 5 GHz band.\n\"Network connections\"->\"Select the appropriate wireless network and click edit\"->\"In the wireless tab\"->\"Change the mode from infrastructure to ad-hoc\"->\"Choose 5 GHz band\"\n\nHowever when I want to change the mode from infrastructure to ad-hoc the \"save\" button tells me that I have to authenticate myself. However I get no pop-up asking me for a password. Using sudo gnome-control-center didn't help either. I could still not save it. Also a error occured then in the terminal:\n\n** (nm-connection-editor:5577): WARNING **: Invalid setting Wireless Security: Security not compatible with Ad-Hoc mode\n\nHopefully this is some useful info for you to help me further.\n\nA: Change that \"Ad-hoc\" option to something else, like \"Infrastructure\" (or a similar menu option).  Infrastructure wireless is your typical \"lots of devices connecting to a single router\" approach, while ad-hoc wireless is intended for a \"mesh\" of wireless devices with no centralized router.\nBeing in ad-hoc mode is likely what's causing your problem (and this is further evidenced by the error message you provided).\n\nA: Run: \n$ iwlist wlan0 scanning | grep -C3 <name of your network>\n\nYou should find 2 entries for the network, for example:\nCell XX - Address: 11:11:11:11:11:11 // This will be different in your machine\nESSID: \"name of your network\" // This will be different on your machine\nProtocol: IEEE 802.11bgn\nMode: Master\nFrequency: 2.437 Ghz\n\n--\n\nCell XX - Address: 22:22:22:22:22:22 // This will be different on your machine\nESSID: \"name of your network // This will be different on your machine\nProtocol: IEEE 802.11AC\nMode: Master\nFrequency: 5.18 Ghz\n\n\n\n*\n\n*BSSID for the 5Ghz Network, in this example: 22:22:22:22:22:22\n\n*BSSID for the 2.4 Ghz Network, in this example: 11:11:11:11:11:11\n\n\nNow what you do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*click on 'Network Connections'\n\n*'Edit Connections...'\n\n*[Select your network connection] (there could be 2 entries, any will do)\n\n*Click Edit\n\n*Go to 'Wi-Fi' or 'Wireless' Tab\n\n*Click the BSSID Dropdown\n\n*Select the BSSID Matching the 5 Ghz Network (22:22:22:22:22:22 in this example)\n\n*Switch to the 'General Tab'\n\n*Make sure to check the checkbox that is labeled: 'Automatically connect to this network when it is available' \n\n*Rename the Connection Name (not the SSID) to 'your network name'_AC\n\n*Click Save\n\n*If there were 2 entries for 'your network name' in your Network Connections list, proceed with next step, otherwise go to the last step.\n\n*Click on the other 'your network name' entry\n\n*Click Edit\n\n*Go to 'Wi-Fi' or 'Wireless' Tab\n\n*Click the BSSID Dropdown\n\n*Select the BSSID Matching the 2.4 Ghz Network (11:11:11:11:11:11 in this example) OR leave the BSSID empty if there are multiple other secondary access points\n\n*Switch to the 'General' Tab\n\n*Uncheck the checkbox that is labeled: 'Automatically connect to this network when it is available'\n\n*Set the 'Connection name' to [your network name]_N\n\n*Click Save...\n\n*Disconnect from your network and re-connect\n\n\nYou should now be connected to the 5Ghz network, and you would have to explicitly do the opposite process in order to connect to the 2.4 Ghz Network.\n\nA: This may work or may not work. Based on my experience, it is inconsistent. On the network manager settings, you can manually enter the BSSID of the AP. You can found out the BSSID using an android application called 'WIFI analyzer'. You can also use other linux based wifi monitoring tools like Kismet, but the easiest way that I found out is using the android application. If you don't know, 5Ghz AP have higher channel number (more than 13). Now, the inconsistency, depending on distro, the BSSID select box may be populated, or you have to input it manually. Either way, enter the BSSID that you wish to connect, and set the name of the network to something you can remember, like \"U-WIFI-5Ghz\". Now unfortunately, sometimes the network will appear (and you can connect to that specific AP) and sometimes it do not even if you know the AP is close by. \n\nA: Method 1 — for use at home with a single wireless router\nFirst, connect to your basic wifi network under \"Infrastructure\". Next, click on BSSID. The BSSID you are connected to at that time should appear when you click on that arrow. This feature prevents your computer from switching networks. 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz.\n\nMethod 2 — roaming on a network with multiple access points like a college campus or public wifi\nNOTE: If you used the method above, you will need to do the opposite before you begin. Make sure the BSSID is not set to anything (is blank) so that you can use multiple access-points and roam across the network.\nFirst, you will need to edit the system-connections file that corresponds to your network. For this example, I will use a network named \"coffee-shop\".\nsudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/coffee-shop\n\nNow, under the [wifi] section, edit the band field to the following (if band= is not listed, you can insert it on the line below [wifi]):\nband=a\n\nThis will set the network to use 5 GHz only. If you want to use 2.4 GHz, use band=bg instead.\nWhen you are done editing, press CTRL+o and then press ENTER to save the file and then press CTRL+x to exit nano.\nFinally, restart network-manager to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart network-manager\n\nClick here for more information.\nNOTE: this setting does not exclude you from using wireless n or wireless c (so don't worry), this feature is only used to select 2.4 or 5 GHz\n\nA: Run the following commands, one line at a time in the terminal (CTRL+ALT+T):\necho \"options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\nsudo modprobe -rfv iwldvm\nsudo modprobe -rfv iwlwifi\nsudo modprobe -v iwlwifi\n\nWhat does this do? The  11n_disable option disables 802.11n features.\nAdding it to\n/etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\nmakes the change persist after reboots (because it will be part of the module config). The modprobe -rfv commands are removing the kernel modules iwldvm and iwlwifi, and finally the last line modprobe -v is adding iwlwifi back in.\nTo know what those kernel modules are/do, you can run modinfo  | grep description, which will tell you the following:\niwlwifi is an Intel(R) Wireless WiFi driver for Linux (generic Intel drivers)\niwldvm is Intel(R) Wireless WiFi Link AGN driver for Linux (more specific drivers)\nOther suggestions\nNow, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, You may have better luck with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. After making these changes, you may need to reboot the router.\n", "Q: How to lock yourself out of the primary account temporarily? I'm looking for something like LeechBlock, or StayFocusd on steroids, i.e. something that could block my Internet access temporarily, but do it in a way that would be a major hassle to disable, unlike these browser plug-ins (A \"major hassle\" is something like re-installing the OS)\nIf I create a \"restricted\" account, block its Internet access and exclude it from sudoers, it would work for me, but only if I could somehow lock myself out of my primary account on the machine, temporarily.\nCan this be done in Ubuntu? (I'm sticking with 11.04, but I would consider upgrading or paying for this feature)\nSimply letting someone else be the admin of my machine is not an acceptable solution for me.\nSomething like a cron job temporarily resetting the password might do the job, but it would have to be something very reliable, obviously. I can't risk being permanently locked out, because the machine had to reboot, etc.\nI also asked a more general version of this question, in productivity.SE.\n\nA: PAM\nA nice not so easy to overcome approach to achieve a temporary lock out from your account is to define rules for the pluggable authentication module pam_time. By doing so we can define a certain time of the day when we are allowed to log in and use our account. Login will result with authentication failure outside these defined hours.\nTell lightdm to use pam_time:\nTo apply pam_time we edit /etc/pam.d/lightdm to add the following line:\naccount    required    pam_time.so\n\nDefine rules for pam_time:\nAll rules for pam_time are stored in /etc/security/time.conf. See the manpage for time.conf for details on the syntax. To e.g. deny login for user oleg on workdays from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. we add the following line there:\nlogin; *; oleg; !Wd0800-1700\n\nTo overcome these rules we may comment out the added lines from a root access (e.g. by booting a live system or with another user account).\nOther than restricting access we may consider to further narrow this down to only some services we may not want to have access:\nhttp; *; oleg; !Wd0800-1700\n\nwill disable internet access for user oleg on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m..\n\nA: As suggested by another user in the linked discussion, the pam_time module is capable of locking out users temporarily.\n\nA: If you think it will be too easy to disable PAM with a live CD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an init script that runs first on boot, checks the system clock, and determines if the current time is allowed.  If the current time is valid, have the script start a custom run-level that automatically logs in a user and starts X for them.  If rescue mode was selected, don't follow the normal procedure and change the runlevel to the custom made one.  This user must not be able to su root or be in sudoers.  Be sure to use a test system first, until you are confident that the changes you made to /etc/rc* and /etc/init* will properly mount and unmount filesystems, and won't otherwise damage the system. Access to virtual consoles will have to be modified, or simply don't start any of them.\n\n*Set the boot priority in BIOS to the hard drive first, to make booting into a live CD impossible.\n\n*Set the BIOS password to something easy to forget, and set up an email reminder service to send it back to you at a specific time.  You can use free services for this from sites such as http://www.kisreminder.com/, or http://www.nudgemail.com/how/.\nThe only ways to circumvent this will be to open up the computer, and either take out the hard drive and modify the files, or reset the BIOS so you can change the time.  If your computer has a way to lock the chassis, you could lock it using a lock with a combination you can forget, and also send an email reminder for the combination for a set time in the future.\n", "Q: Sharing subfolders with Ubuntu One \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to select folders to sync in UbuntuOne? \n\nIs it possible to share subfolders with Ubuntu One?

They appear just as they do when typed in vim running in a terminal (consonants and vowels separated.)\nIs there any way we can make vim handle devnagari characters properly?\n\nA: Update: I searched a bit and found that you can use any monospaced font in vim but if you choose a non-monospaced font, the results will be ugly because vim has a fixed character cell. So, you can't use Devanagari fonts in gvim.\n\nIt seems to me that gVim treats every font as monospaced and that is creating the problem.\n\nYou can try other editors which can render the font correctly.

If you ever want to host more than one site you're going to need to get involved with the virtual hosts settings.\nIn my opinion, rather than shovelling files all over the place or even linking them, I would opt to just change the configuration so Apache on Ubuntu looks at the Windows versions.\nAnd that's simple.

Windows can unzip files from inside a dialog, which is convenient if files are zipped and you want to unzip.\n\nCan Ubuntu do this? If so, how? If not, why not?\n\nA: No. Most of the dialogues are limited to just changing the sorts of things they can show although I should point out that some dialogues work in different ways.\nUbuntu uses GTK for most file dialogues so no, you don't get full context menus.\nAs for \"why not\" I can only describe how it's built. The dialogue is just a cut-down list of the files. It's not designed to be a full-on interface for files. In Windows each file dialogue is an embedded instance of Explorer.\n\nA: Ok it is maybe not exactly the same than on windows but if you start nautilus (the file manager), browse to the location of the archive and then right click on the archive name then open with the archive manager, then you have access to more or less the same functionality. The good news is that the archive manager can open most of the archive types (can you open a rar file into winzip ?).

This generally works great but causes a problem in Firefox as entered text e.g into a Google search is white. As the text background is also white you cannot see what you are typing.\nI have read through a good thirty websites with similar issues but thus far nothing works. \nI have tried all the settings in Firefox like un-checking \"Use System Defaults\" as well as manually telling Firefox what colours to use and these setting have absolutely no effect on anything.\n\nA: If you are willing, you could consider this:\nCreate (or edit) userContent.css using a simple text editor (since it should be a simple text file) in the following path:\n/home/your_name/.mozilla/firefox/*****/chrome/userContent.css where ****** is the profile unique to each user.\nYou may also have to create the chrome folder since it most likely will not exist in more recent versions of Firefox.\nIn that file place the following:\n\n@-moz-document domain(google.com)\n  { input\n      {\n      -moz-appearance: none !important; \n      color: #000000 !important;\n      } \n  }\n\nAll it does is to force a black font color in input boxes on the google.com site. If you want that code to apply globally, remove the first line and the outer curly brackets.\nPlease note that chrome and userContent.css are case-sensitive.\nAlternatively, you could install the Stylish extension and then browse the gallery of styles available. There is a well attended forum available as well.\nThe advantage (or disadvantage) of modifying the userContent.css (and userChrome.css) files or using the Stylish extension is that the settings in your stylesheets or in Stylish will have the last word and not the theme. So you can change themes without affecting the way your Firefox looks.\n\nA: Have you tried altering the userContent.css in Firefox's profile directory?\nCreate a new file (or edit it if it exists) ~/.mozilla/firefox/your_profile_directory/chrome/userContent.css. Replace your_profile_directory with your profile folder, it will probably look something like cvrat3qh.default.\nCopy-paste the following lines in that file:\ninput[type=\"text\"],\ninput[type=\"password\"],\ntextarea\n{\n  -moz-appearance: none !important;\n  background: white;\n  color: black;\n\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  border: 1px solid #BBB;\n  background-color: white;\n  padding: 3px;\n  color: black;\n}\n\nand restart Firefox.\n\nA: Here is a userstyle for Stylish that implements the CSS fix.\n\nA: I found that the best way to do this was to take the code block that jeremija provided and paste it into Stylish.  It'll change the text color issue on all sites without effecting the Firefox theme and also negate the need to go digging through hidden files trying to find the correct config document.\n", "Q: Where can I find dictionaries for Opendict and Goldendict?

I'm planning to install Xubuntu 12.04 on it. I have read some question here (like What's a good partition method to combine an SSD boot drive with a 1TB data drive?) and most basic partitioning scheme should look like:\n\n\n*\n\n*/ on SSD\n\n*/home on HDD\n\n\nI don't plan making /swap because I have 8 GB of RAM (or should I?). Is there a point on making separate /boot partition on SSD? Would I benefit from butting something more on SSD? \nThere are some suggestions to but programs you use most to SSD to speed things up. Should there be a separate partition for this? Would it be good idea to install virtual machines to SSD?\nIf i want to reinstall rather than upgrade should i make a separate partition for user files so I could overwrite /home? If yes, how big should /home be? \n\nA: First of all, the root will not likely take more than 5-10GB; even if you plan to store loads of programs, 15GB should be enough. So you still have plenty of space left on your SSD.\nSSD is faster when making random access -- for example, accessing a large number of data base records or reading loads of small configuration files. I'm not sure to what extent putting /home on SSD speeds up the responsivity of the system; it will sure play a role if you plan to use wine and install the Windows programs into your home directory. Moreover, hard disk can have better transfer rates -- so reading a large, continuous file from an unfragmented HD can be faster.\nGiven that you have plenty of space on the SSD, you could set up a separate /home partition on your SSD (by all means, use a separate partition!), and use the HD to store large media files (movies, music, photography, archives, data). At least that is the way that I manage the things.\nSwap partition might come in handy if you have a laptop and would like to have the option to hibernate -- the memory snapshot will then be saved to the swap partition.\n", "Q: How to get the Ubuntu-dictionary in Lubuntu?

You either burn the CUE/FLAC combination in a burner that can decode the FLAC data or you play it in something that understands what CUEs are (lots of players AFAIK).\nA CUE/FLAC is very much like an audio CD. An audio CD is just linear PCM data with a CDA-formatted header that states where all the track boundaries are. In your case the audio data has been losslessly compressed into the FLAC and the CUE is the track information.\nConverting to WAV only serves to undo the compression. You might need to do this to burn it to disk.\n\nSplitting into separate tracks\nIf you want to split the main FLAC into separate tracks, you can use the tools from the shntool package as suggested in this blog:\ncuebreakpoints filename.cue | shntool split -o flac filename.flac\n\nYou can also specify another output format instead of FLAC (option -o flac in the example).\n(You'll need to install the commands first: sudo apt-get install cuetools shntool)\nTagging FLAC CD images for use with players like foobar\nFLAC also allows for embedding cuesheets via metaflac and compatible taggers. Players like foobar2000 and it's Linux equivalents (DeaDBeeF and Guayadeque) can parse and play files with such metadata. Importing a properly tagged cuesheet (along with other metadata like pictures), will also import tags like individual tracknames, tracknumbers, artist and album tags.\nExcerpt from metaflac manpage:\n--import-cuesheet-from=file\n    Import  a cuesheet from a file.

A seekpoint will  be  added  for\n    each  index  point  in  the  cuesheet to the SEEKTABLE unless\n    --no-cued-seekpoints is specified.\n\nBut this kind of file format is rather unknown and unsupported outside the \"distributed CD backup community\". Mostly due to the fact that you cannot rip CDs to images on Linux like EAC does on Windows.

Holding shift doesn't do anything either.\nThe last time I could use my machine I changed stuff in /etc/grub.d, but I chrooted into the system, reverted everything and successfully ran update-grub.\nWhat can I try?\nIf anyone wondering: Ubuntu 12.04.1, Installation media was (I guess) 11.10, it's an i5-first generation kernel, 4GB RAM, memtest was okay.\n\nA: A Boot-Repair Live USB can be used to repair Grub. You can download the ISO from the Ubuntu Wiki. Then, use Unetbootin to create a Live USB from the ISO file you downloaded. After you boot from the USB, the Boot Repair utility will pop up. Just click on the Recommended Repair button, and Boot-Repair will repair Grub for you.\n\nA: This is not a software issue, The alloc magic broken error is a result of bad memory chips.\n\nA: I have solved this.\nI used Rescatux and mainly SG2D to chainboot into my regular system.\nI then ran update-grub again and was wondering again why it would list everything twice, when it occurred to me to check the grub.cfg (just read, not write!).\nI then found out that the supposedly \"reverted\" changes to the GRUB-config were still there preventing grub from starting.\n(I had named the not-working ones .n for \"new\" assuming they would be ignored (like .bak))\nSO: is it a valid bug to be posted, that reinstallation of GRUB does not clear the config dir?\n\nA: perhaps the iso file was made in a 32-bit computer,\nand the error comes from trying to boot it form a 64-bit one!!?\nI had that issue!  and I guess that was the cause!\n\nA: I had the same problem, but with a different cause.\nI my case I had to do a boot repair of windows\n(download iso from MS; go into repair; go into terminal; bootrec /fixboot\nfor details google.)\nHope this helps someone.\n\nA: I started having the same issue when using the latest version of Rufus and iso of Ubuntu 16 (Paladin 7.08). I used the previous version of Rufus (3.8) and in worked for me. Although I had another error (with graphics), but that’s another story. Hope that helps someone.\n\nA: This error can also happen when you have chosen the option to encrypt the entire disk when installing Ubuntu. If this is the case and you have secure boot enabled, there is no need to disable secure boot. Just go into BIOS and search for the option which allows you to setup a trusted file for EFI boot. One of these files will be shimx64. Choose that file and save and exit BIOS. Get into BIOS again, and you'll see the shim option in the boot priority menu. Move it to the topmost position. Save and exit BIOS. This time, it'll boot fine. The shim is a preloader that connects to grub.\n\nA: I ran into this error recently when I partially wiped a member of a zfs pool accidentally. On a 6TB member disk, I wiped roughly 200GB before realizing I started wiping the wrong disk. ZFS did what it does and marked it as faulted after finding a bunch of checksum errors as you would expect (though it did attempt to resilver them).\nOn next boot, that drive faulted stating the label was missing. No big deal I thought. I just ran 'parted' and did a 'mklabel gpt' on it. Interestingly enough, the drive sprung to life again and began resilvering. However it eventually faulted again for the same checksum issue.\nScrubbing always failed with that drive being faulted shortly afterwards. I figured I would replace it on next boot later in the day as this was a non-production system. Wouldn't you know it, subsequent boots would fail with this 'alloc magic' error. At first I did not equate this problem to the drive I managed to convert into magnetic confetti with my antics. After disconnecting this drive (1 of around 60) and ONLY this drive, the error disappeared and I was able to replace the drive successfully.\nSo yeah, don't partially wipe stuff and think zfs will make it healthy. But I will praise zfs for its resiliency for the rest of the pool and its never-give-up attitude with trying to fix broken things.\n", "Q: 'Your system is running in low-graphic mode' after installing AMD fglrx drivers on a 6600M Looks like I have a problem that has already been debated but non of the solutions provided did not work for me, so I'm asking this question again in hpes that someone can help me. \nI'm running 12.04 64 bit version on Lenovo E520 with AMD Radeon HD 6600M and Intel HD graphic.

Older hybrid systems use a multiplexor (mux) to switch between GPU's. Newer systems (those with PowerXpress >= 4.0) are muxless. As far as I can tell, PowerXpress 4.0 started with RadeonHD 6000-series GPU's, and systems with older ATI GPU's have a mux, but don't quote that.\nIntel/ATI Hybrids\nTODO: Status unknown at this time\n\nThat line in 12.6 used to say that it was not possible to use Intel/AMD hybrid adapters with the fglrx drivers.\nThe best you can do is use the open source drivers or investigate further inside your BIOS and check if you can disable the Intel card completely.\n", "Q: gksudo 2 commands with one PW entry?

I need it to consider the already existing files as synced and don't download it again. And I need Ubuntu One for further use so I can't simply quit it. How could I mark the already existing files as synced ?\n\nA: Ubuntu One maintains a database of files it has synced.

I'd suggest running on AC-only (remove the battery) and using one of the techniques in this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I monitor power consumption?\nThe process would be fairly simple. Switch to wireless, leave it tracking for a set period of time. Something meaningful like an hour might be worthwhile. Then switch to wired and repeat.\nAs I mention in my comments, hardware can vary hugely. My ethernet card might use twice as much power as yours. My wireless card might use even more.

The only thing stopping me from making Ubuntu 12.04 my main OS is that a lot of programs I use on Windows 7 and Mac aren't available for download on Ubuntu.\nWhy don't popular programs like Photoshop or World of Warcraft support Linux?\nAlso, would a company have to create the program (eg: Photoshop) for every possible distro (Gentoo, Arch Linux, Ubuntu, etc...), or would they just have to make one binary and it would work across all distros?\n\nA: I think market share is very important aspect, because producing complicated softwares (like Photoshop) or game (like Warcraft) are too expensive for software production companies and when market share of an operating system (Like Ubuntu) is low then the sell of this kind of software will be low therefore produce this king of software (expensive and complicated) is not beneficial for software production companies. \n\nA: For the most part, distribution doesn't matter a great deal. However, the nice thing about the open source community is that in those certain situations where it does matter, everyday Linux users are happy to take over the management of software packages in order to ensure a program they enjoy using is stable on their distribution of choice.\nWhen you're dealing with closed source software, though, this becomes harder. In this situation, the producing company holds the responsibility for ensuring the stability of their software on all platforms, and that is quite a big project to dedicate a workforce to, especially when it's only for the benefit of a minority of users.\n\nA: Ubuntu is a very high built open source flavor, many of the gamers of today use windows for their \"goto gamer gooru\" Ubuntu is mainly meant for software development and network debugging and setup. However Ubuntu is capable of having artistic measures such as gimp 2.4 as in a Basic rundown version of Photoshop, but not made by Adobe. Back to the gaming case there is not really a whole lot you can do besides run a designated \"wine program\" which is compatible with the wine runner. Anyways if your a gamer gooru then your going to have to face the inevitable that Ubuntu or any other Linux Distro cannot run many games today that are meant for a dedicated graphics card and or a dedicated computer which is ported with graphics capable of running any game at maximum settings. art Graphics and Photo wise you can depend on Gimp, but its not a reliable as Photoshop.\nP.S no the company wont have to make a \"ex Photoshop, that would be one discombobulated bunch!\n", "Q: I can't find or run downloaded Geogebra I can't find it.

I was wondering if mate will ever show up in the official repos and be installable without the ppa?\n\nA: Mate is in the process of being submitted to the Debian repositories, so it is just a matter of time really.\nThe biggest hurdle is having someone (preferably multiple people) to manage and maintain the packages (and to handle bug reports etc). Another problem is that the Debian people don't like the fact that MATE uses deprecated technologies forked from GNOME 2 - this problem is getting better with each MATE release.

Host OS is Ubuntu 12.04 running Unity.  All works reasonably well, except , \nThere is a keystroke combination in Word to \"paste special\", and it is invoked by Alt + E + S + Enter.  Good for pasting text without carrying in any formatting from the source text.\nSeveral times I have gone to do that in haste.  On occasion, however, instead of Word pasting the clipboard into the open Word doc, Unity grabs these keystrokes and immediately forces some kind of hardware reset or reboot!

I don't see any such key combination documented for Unity, and in any case, I'd like to be able to turn of all or selected Unity shortcuts, but haven't seen how to do that either.\n\nA: Unity seems to like grabbing certain keys even when VirtualBox is trying to intercept the input. This happens for me with the Super and Alt keys mainly.\nYou should try pressing that key sequence slowly in Unity and see what happens. A small menu-bar should come up with 'System Settings > Shutdown' or similar. That's my guess\nSee this question for how to disable Unity's use of Alt:\nHow do I modify or disable the HUD's use of the Alt key?\n\nA: As minerz029 mentioned, pressing Alt activates HUD, and pressing E+S results in selecting Restart. You can disable the HUD shortcut in System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts [tab] > Launchers by clicking on the shortcut and pressing Backspace. Alternatively, if you have Right Alt you can use it for paste special in Word.\nBut if you don’t want to change default settings, you can use the shortcut in 2 ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold Alt and press E+S, then release Alt.

When I have any of its components running, the icons in the taskbar don't have arrows next to them, and Alt-Tab doesn't show or allow access to any Libreoffice windows that I have open (but I can click them to bring them to the front). \nThis behaviour has changed just recently, and as far as I'm aware, nothing has changed on my system for the past few weeks other than installing recommended updates as normal. \nAnyone else seen this?\n\nA: Libreoffice hasn't played well with Unity for a while now. At times things are fine, then suddenly everything will break. Different problems occur to different people, but they all involve Libreoffice's integration with the launcher and alt-tab.\nSee this bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1026426\nYou could hit alt-f2 and type unity --replace next time you have a problem, but if that works it's at best a temporary fix. Uninstalling/reinstalling libreoffice and/or lo-menubar are sometimes suggested as fixes to these problems, but, again, those are only temporary fixes.\n", "Q: Chrome fails to clear the thumbnails I am using Google chrome version 21.0.1180.89 (on Ubuntu 12.04) and when I clear the browsing data it fails to clear the thumbnails (the most visited ones that show up on a new tab page).\nI deleted \"Top Sites\" and \"Top Sites-journal\" (under ~/.config/google-chrome/Default path) but this did not clear out the thumbnails.\nI am not even sure whether chrome actually counts the visit number on pages correctly or not anymore.\n\nA: This is a known bug in the current version of Chrome.\n", "Q: I have disabled Unity plugin in \"ccsm\" when turning off Expo.

Is it possible to install GRUB2 at /dev/sda1 partition? Is Ubuntu installer ready for that? Is there some configuration for GRUB2 to setup boot path for Windows 7 (HDD) and Ubuntu 12.04 (SSD)?\n\nA: Yes!  The Ubuntu installer should take care of that for you, but if you already have an installation or something, you can install the grub-efi packages.  Running grub-install /dev/sdX will install grub as the default boot entry and copy the needed files to /boot and your first partition.  You can then chainload to windows (assuming the installer doesn't detect this option automatically).\nI have an EFI boot of Ubuntu working on my MacbookPro (which I am using to post this).  You can build your own grub image (detailed here) for maximum portability (which I recommend).  If you build your own image, it will work as a recovery image even when you don't have Ubuntu installed.\nTo summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu installer will setup grub for you.\n\n*The installer should detect Windows for you.\n\n*If it does not, use your intellect to find a way to boot into your installation and install grub2-efi-amd64 or similar package and run grub-install /dev/sda1.  Note that this will squash your current boot option and make grub the default.  You may also want to run grub-update.\n\n", "Q: How do I have my GTK+3 theme look different in certain applications? If I want my GTK+3 theme that I'm writing to theme certain UI elements in some applications a bit differently than for most applications, how would I go about doing that?\nFor example, I might have a GTK+3 theme which specifies round buttons in most applications, but in Calculator (gcalctool) I want square buttons instead.\nHow do I find out how to refer to these applications' UI elements in my theme's CSS files?\n\nA: It seems you need to dig into the source files for the different applications and see what they call the different UI elements in their code, likely in the toplevel code.\nFor the gcalctool example, it appears that the relevant file is gcalctool.c, in which the following line can be seen:\nstatic MathWindow *window;\n\nThus, to refer to its UI elements (buttons in this case), a section in the theme's CSS should read like:\nMathWindow .button {\n  /* Properties to modify here for buttons in gcalctool */\n}\n\nAs each application has its own code, it's apparently up to the theme creator to review the source code of the applications they want to theme and find the relevant UI element names to reference in the CSS.\n", "Q: How to make hotot autologin and minimize on start?

I've been trying to connect to my university's secure wireless network, unfortunately they only provide instructions for Windows users here. I've tried to use the info on these instructions as best I can but I have not been successful. In particular, I think the problem might be with the certificate part. I am using Ubuntu 12.04.\nI appreciate any help!\n\nA: Ok, the I had to go past the first level of computer support but they actually did help me out. The only problem was that I needed to choose an AddTrust CA instead of a GeoTrust CA, even though you need to choose GeoTrust if you're in Windows. Thanks for everyone's input. \n\nA: It's actually all fairly simple. There's a similar guide at Michigan U for Ubuntu shows the whole process. Network Manager should do most of the heavy lifting. You might need to select the encryption type (PEAP).\nOther than that, talk to your support people.

(You can manually import an ICS file in Google Calendar by clicking the small arrow next to Other calendars,  choosing Import calendar from the drop-down list, navigating to the .ICS file, and choosing Import.)\nI don't know if this is possible, but I'm hoping somebody will have a great idea.\n\nA: As of Jan 2020 I managed to solve this for Firefox by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*about:config - switch dom.registerContentHandler.enabled to true;\n\n*open Google calendar;\n\n*press Ctrl+Shift+K to open console;\n\n*copy the following code, paste it into the console and press Enter:\njavascript:window.navigator.registerProtocolHandler(\"webcal\",\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r?cid=%s\",\"Google Calendar\");\nAfter these steps, you should see a window-width stripe under the address bar asking you if you want to set Google calendar as a default webcal handler.\nBefore all that, I tried to use the master Yoda's solution but it didn't work - anyway, cheers, it inspired me to look closer at the about:config entries and to discover this method.\n\nA: In newer versions of Chromium/Chrome, you need to login to google calendar and click the overlapped diamond icon in the address bar.\n\nSelect \"Use Google Calendar\", then click done. This will register google calendar as a handler for webcal links.\nNote:\nYou may need to set Chromium to allow sites to become default protocol handlers.

What is Unix, Linux, Ubuntu?\nAre they the same thing or different versions or completely different stuff?\nThis has always made me confused, any explanation would be great.\n\nA: This is from Wikipedia: Linux. Cheating I know....\n\nThe Unix operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969 at\n  AT&T's Bell Laboratories in the United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis\n  Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. It was first released in\n  1971 and was initially entirely written in assembly language, a common\n  practice at the time. Later, in a key pioneering approach in 1973,\n  Unix was re-written in the programming language C by Dennis Ritchie\n  (with exceptions to the kernel and I/O). The availability of an\n  operating system written in a high-level language allowed easier\n  portability to different computer platforms. With a legal glitch\n  forcing AT&T to license the operating system's source code to anyone\n  who asked,[22] Unix quickly grew and became widely adopted by academic\n  institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell\n  Labs. Free of the legal glitch requiring free licensing, Bell Labs\n  began selling Unix as a proprietary product.\nLinux is a Unix-like computer operating system assembled under the\n  model of free and open source software development and distribution.\n  The defining component of Linux is the Linux kernel, an operating\n  system kernel first released 5 October 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Linux\n  was originally developed as a free operating system for Intel\n  x86-based personal computers. It has since been ported to more\n  computer hardware platforms than any other operating system. It is a\n  leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as\n  mainframe computers and supercomputers:more than 90% of today's 500\n  fastest supercomputers run some variant of Linux,including the 10\n  fastest. Linux also runs on embedded systems (devices where the\n  operating system is typically built into the firmware and highly\n  tailored to the system) such as mobile phones, tablet computers,\n  network routers, televisions and video game consoles; the Android\n  system in wide use on mobile devices is built on the Linux kernel.\nUbuntu is a computer operating system based on the Debian Linux\n  distribution and distributed as free and open source software, using\n  its own desktop environment. It is named after the Southern African\n  philosophy of ubuntu (\"humanity towards others\"). As of 2012,\n  according to online surveys, Ubuntu is the most popular Linux\n  distribution on desktop/laptop personal computers, and most Ubuntu\n  coverage focuses on its use in that market. \nUbuntu is sponsored by the UK-based company Canonical Ltd., owned by\n  South African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth. Canonical generates\n  revenue by selling technical support and services related to Ubuntu,\n  while the operating system itself is entirely free of charge.\n\n\nA: (I had added the overview-poster to the related question half-jokingliy; But here, it is actually helpful in relation to the other answers:)\nThere is also a somewhat more detailed poster that I vaguely remember, but for a quick summary, that should be enough:\n\n(Click image to enlarge)\nImage from Wikimedia commons: Unix history-simple \n(For the details (all), see GNU/Linux Distribution Timeline 12.10 - but that \"somewhat more detailed poster\" I vaguely remember was somewhere in between...)\n\nA: Unix was and is (mostly) proprietary. So some people got their collective noggin together in the 1980s and put together something that reproduced Unix functionality without copying its source code, which would have been illegal [insert longer version about Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds here].\nOne of the first GNU/Linux distributions was Debian. Ubuntu was created by people that had been involved with Debian and Ubuntu is officially proud of its Debian roots. It's all ultimately GNU/Linux but Ubuntu is a flavor. In the same way that you can have different dialects of English. The source is open so anyone can create their own version of it.\nHowever, Debian is not really useable for mere mortals such as myself and that is where something like Ubuntu comes in. Indeed, I understand that it is specifically the strategy of Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, to target the non-geek user. Which is why most new GNU/Linux users come to Ubuntu or Mint (which is based on Ubuntu) first.\n\nA: From:-Comparison between Linux And Unix Operating System\n\nMany a times we get confused with Unix and Linux also threat them as\n  synonyms but that is not true. UNIX is copyrighted name only few of\n  the companies are allowed it i.e. IBM AIX and Sun Solaris and HP-UX.\n  This quote from Official Linux kernel README file confuses most.\nLinux is a Unix clone written from scratch by Linus Torvalds with\n  assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across the Net. It aims\n  towards POSIX compliance.\nIn this article I am trying to describe the various differences between Unix and Linux under the following headings.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*History\n  \n*Usage\n  \n*Cost\n  \n*GUI\n  \n*Security\n  \n*Future OS\n  \n  \n  History\nUNIX was created in the 1960s by the AT&T Bell Labs (Ken Thompson and\n  Dennis Ritchie) and first commercially UNIX OS became available in\n  1970. First release of Unix was having a command line interpreter and some small utility programs with future extension for the multitasking\n  and UNIX evolved from there.\nIn 1991, Linus Torvalds began working on a UNIX like OS known as\n  Minix. The Minix source code was freely available under GNU GPL and he\n  successfully modified this code for use on x86 PC systems. By\n  September 1991, Torvalds has successfully completed the first Linux\n  kernel designed for PCs. This kernel included various system utilities\n  and libraries from the GNU project to create a usable operating system\n  based completely on open source code.\nUsage The UNIX operating system is used in internet servers, workstations & PCs. Backbone of the majority of finance infastructure\n  and many 24x365 high availability solutions.\nLinux can be installed on a wide variety of computer hardware, ranging\n  from mobile phones, tablet computers and video game consoles, to\n  mainframes and supercomputers.\nCost Linux is Free (as it is opensource, except the case where you need a supported version i.e. RHEL). You can download it from the\n  Internet or redistribute it under GNU licenses. You will see the best\n  community support for Linux. Most UNIX like operating systems are not\n  free (but this is changing fast, for example OpenSolaris UNIX).\n  However, some Linux distributions such as Redhat / Novell provides\n  additional Linux support, consultancy, bug fixing, and training for\n  additional fees.\nGUI Any modern system discussion can not be completed untill unless we discuss about graphical interface. Linux typically provides\n  KDE and Gnome, but there are many alternatives such as LXDE, Xfce,\n  Unity, Mate, twm, ect. where as Unix most distributions now ship with\n  Gnome (initial GUI used to be called CDE i.e. Common Desktop\n  Environment).\n\n", "Q: HP 4510s Probook Overheating \nPossible Duplicate:\nVery hot running with ubuntu \n\nI am having overheating problems with Ubuntu 12.04.

That's the one you need to pick in BIOS for USB.\n\nA: This is a hardware limitation, if USB is not a boot option then either it's turned off on your BIOS or your system does not support USB booting.\nIf that is the case you are better off using a CD to install Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How do I prevent Nautilus from hiding some file extensions?

I think it might have something to do with updating google chrome because it usually does this when updating chrome.\n\nA: You can optionally run in the terminal\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nWatch both those commands and you will find the issue.  Post back and we can debug further.\nOptionally once you find the issue you can disable that software source by going into your Update Manager and clicking settings and then going into \"Other Sources\" if it turns out to be a non-Ubuntu issue and an application installed on Ubuntu like Google Chrome.  My Chrome install uses this URL http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/\n\nA: It's easier to run these two commands:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nin the terminal. \nIf you were interrupted during a previous update, your update manager might not work but these commands (if you watch them) will tell you what's wrong. Sometimes it will tell you that your files are broken or it needs to retrieve archives, or might tell you to run the apt-get update again, or \"run with --fix-missing\". If this happens, run the command\nsudo apt-get upgrade --fix-missing\n\nThis will take a little while because your computer is replacing broken files and programs with archived older versions and then updating them from there.\nI don't know how to format this so it actually looks like the code, but if you read it from the terminal it should work.\nHonestly it's usually an issue with chrome and after you do - -fix-missing Chrome might not work for you anymore.

Background: I am a longtime Gentoo user, and this is my first time using Ubuntu (installed on a VM to avoid compiling everything from scratch). I am familiar with a Linux environment but somewhat unfamiliar with Ubuntu.\nI am trying to install Subversion 1.7 on Ubuntu and saw this post:\nWhere can I find a Subversion 1.7 binary?\nThe above post recommends using the PPA ppa:dominik-stadler/subversion-1.7. I also found the PPA ppa:svn/ppa from another link. They both cause problems for me.\nThe issue is that any svn operation using the remote server causes the following error:\nsvn: E170001: Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'svn+ssh://my_repo'\nsvn: E170001: Could not create SASL context: generic failure: No such file or directory\n\nThis seems to arise from a recent bug involving SVN dependency on the libsasl library, as documented by Debian users here:\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=683555\nand also Mac users here:\nhttps://trac.macports.org/ticket/34861\nResolution seems to involve either updating the cyrus-sasl or libsasl library to a newer version (neither of which is in the latest apt packages), or compiling subversion without SASL support. As a Gentoo user I started looking into how to compile svn from source, but it looks way more complicated on Ubuntu than I'm used to and I'm not sure what the canonical way is. My questions:\n\n*\n\n*Is there an obvious fix for this problem that I am overlooking?\n\n*Is there a way to update the dependencies for SVN to something that works through using synaptic or apt-get?\n\n*If I want to compile from scratch, how do I use the sources in the PPA instead of downloading my own source copy (i.e. the PPA has both binary and sources?)\n\nEDIT: This seems to be caused by this bug in SASL\nI changed /etc/hostname without updating /etc/hosts, and this caused the error. Fixing /etc/hosts allowed me to get around the error for now without having to compile SVN from scratch or finding a patched version of cyrus-sasl2.\n\nA: This is a bug. One would hope any \"obvious fix\" would be added to the PPA immediately. One workaround I have seen (from one of your links) is to just configure it with the --without-sasl flag but you'll need to mess around with the build scripts for that.\nHere's the standard way of building the package from repo sources. If your PPA has source, it will use that source. You'll know fairly quickly if it worked because the directory will be subversion-1.7...\nThis also gets the dependencies (through build-dep).\nsudo apt-get build-dep subversion\napt-get source subversion\ncd subversion*\ndpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -nc\ndpkg -i ../subversion*.deb\n\nEdit: Just got to the end of your macports link. Looks like there's a fix in libsasl. Find a separate PPA for that, or build that and you might be okay.\n\nA: As mentioned this happened after renaming the hostname (cloned vm).\nSolution on Ubuntu/Debian with subversion 1.7.7-1 - Execute following:\ndpkg-reconfigure libsasl2-2\ndpkg-reconfigure libsasl2-modules\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 installer does not recognize Windows 7 I recently purchased an ASUS N56VZ-ES71 laptop which came with Windows 7 Home Premium installed on it. I wish to dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 on it. I shrank the hard drive partitions to leave about 150 GB unallocated for Ubuntu 12.04. When I boot the Live CD of Ubuntu and attempt to install, the installer does not recognize any other operating systems. Through reading a few questions, I have found that this is due to a GPT partitioning table that Windows uses.\nI ran boot-repair as per other threads' suggestions. This was my output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1176988/\nI suppose my question is: how do I proceed in order to get the installer to recognize Windows, so that I don't have to erase the current partition table and can get a safe install?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: First, GPT is not, in and of itself, the problem. The error you report (no partitions appearing in the installer) is indicative of a partition table problem. It's a long-standing bug of libparted (which the installer uses) that broken partition tables show as if they were blank disks. GPT is supported by libparted, though, and Ubuntu will install to GPT disks.\nThe key is this:\n/dev/sda1 ends after the last sector of /dev/sda\n\nThis error message refers to the GPT's protective MBR, which is a \"fake\" MBR partition table that exists just to keep GPT-unaware utilities from using the disk. Your protective MBR contains a protective 0xEE partition that's too big. This really doesn't matter, but it's triggering libparted's \"broken partition table\" bug.\nThe solution is to fix the protective MBR. This is easily done using gdisk or sgdisk, which are part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu; however, I'm not sure if that package is installable in a live CD. Therefore, I'll tell you how to do this from an emergency disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Parted Magic and burn it to CD.\n\n*Boot Parted Magic.\n\n*Launch a terminal window (the icon of a monitor on the bottom of the screen).\n\n*Type gdisk /dev/sda to launch gdisk. You should see some startup messages and a prompt that reads Command (? for help):.\n\n*Type p in gdisk to view your partition table and verify that everything looks OK. If you see weird partitions, exit by typing q.\n\n*Type x to get to the experts' menu. The prompt should change to read Expert command (? for help):.\n\n*Type n. This generates a fresh protective MBR. The program will respond merely by displaying a new prompt.\n\n*Type w to save your changes. The program will warn you it will overwrite your old partitions and prompt you for confirmation. Respond y.\n\n*Reboot and try installing again. It should now work fine.\n\n\nOne caveat: Your computer is booting Windows in EFI mode, so you should also install Ubuntu in EFI mode. This is sometimes trouble-prone. I recommend backing up your EFI System Partition (ESP; /dev/sda1) while you're in Parted Magic or by using the Ubuntu installer. If you have problems after installing, you may need to install a new boot loader. See my EFI Boot Loaders for Linux page for details.\n\nA: The Ubuntu tools cannot detect Windows because your partitioning has problems. For example, parted returns Error: Unable to satisfy all constraints on the partition. \nThe easiest way to fix this is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your documents on an external disk (or DVDs..)\n\n*Make sure you have a Windows DVD (burn one if you haven't)\n\n*Via Gparted, format the entire disk (try to avoid GPT partitioning, use MsDos partition table). Create:\n\n\n*\n\n*a NTFS partition (~50GB, where Windows will be reinstalled) at the start of the disk, put a boot flag on it. \n\n*a EXT4 partition (~20GB, where Ubuntu will be installed).\n\n*a SWAP partition (size of your RAM, ~5GB if you don't know, will be used by Ubuntu)\n\n*leave the end of the disk(~425GB) for data.\n\n\n*Install Windows\n\n*Install Ubuntu\n\nA: I had same problem on a computer that had installed windows 8. Looks like a problem with   GPT traces left on the disc. I used systemrescuecd to execute this command:\nfixparts /dev/sda\n\nDelete the GPT info and write the partitin (using W) reboot and I was able to execute ubuntu on dual boot. I hope that it works for you.\n\nA: You can manually specify the drives you want to use. When you install click on \"partition Manually\" or something in that context.\nThen select your unallocated space, allocate space for the ubuntu partition and the swap partition. \nI had the same problem too. :)\n\nA: Go through this link Ubuntu does not detect drive partitions\nHope it may help...\n", "Q: Close active window from terminal Do you know how to do it? I know how to do it from my keyboard (Alt+F4), I know how to do it with my mouse (click that X), and I also know that kill X should kill the process with the id X (and killall Y should kill the process named Y). But I want to know how to kill the active window from terminal.\nTherefore, from what I stated above, a valid answer would also be to get the id of the active window.\nRight now I'm implementing this function from xte (simulating Alt+F4), but I'd like to know if there's a way that doesn't imply installing another app. Thank you all.\nEDIT. Here is the full script.\nFirst you enable 'show mouse when Ctrl is pressed', then you add this script to Commands in CompizConfig and binding to top-right corner. When you touch the top-right corner, a small notification around the mouse is shown. If you do nothing, the active window will close after 1 second. However, if you touch the corner again within the second, the active window will not be closed.\nxte 'key Control_R'; if [ -f ~/.fcont ]; then rm -f -r ~/.fcont; else touch ~/.fcont; sleep 1;  if [ -f ~/.fcont ]; then xkill -id `xprop -root _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW | cut -d\\# -f2`; rm -f -r ~/.fcont; fi fi\n\nNote that I still use the xte app named before since this question I made some time ago was never answered.\n\nA: And if you want to get really hairy and avoid applications that aren't installed by default:\nxkill -id `xprop -root _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW | cut -d\\# -f2`\n\nAgain, this seems to work fairly well.\nNOTE: In the case of some applications (see comments) this may mean that all windows for an application are closed. gnome-terminal is one such application but terminator and xterm are not affected. I would suggest this is more a bug (maybe by design) with those applications rather than one with my command.\n\nA: A high-level \"close\" operation using wmctrl\nThe command below also closes the currently active window using EWMH specification, though it does require installing another program, which you seemed to prefer avoiding.\nSpecifics\n\n\n*\n\n*This is a high-level \"close\" operation. In other words, it sends to the application the very same message asking it to close the window that would be send via mouse clic on \"close\" gadget or key shortcut.\n\n*It does not emulated a key shortcut, so works whatever your key shortcuts are or even if you have no shortcut configured (or probably even not keyboard configured).\n\n\nAs a result, it has expected behavior: \n\n\n*\n\n*It only closes the very window which is targeted and not the whole app (tested with xfce4-terminal, Chromium, Thunderbird).  \n\n*Also, it gives a chance to the application to react to the close event, like asking confirmation (confirmed with Thunderbird with a window where a mail is being written, and Firefox asking confirmation before closing a window with several open tabs) or possibly even ignore the event.\n\n\nThe command\n\nwmctrl -c :ACTIVE:\n\nReference\nFrom project home page wmctrl - A command line tool to interact with an EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager.\n\n-c              Close the window gracefully.\n\nand\n\nThe special string \":ACTIVE:\" (without the quotes)\n  may be used to instruct wmctrl to use the currently\n  active window for the action.\n\n\nA: I'd use xdotool:\nxdotool windowkill `xdotool getactivewindow`\n\nSeems to do the job quickly and quietly.\n", "Q: Macbook won't read disk I have a macbook that I erased the original iOS on to restart with Ubuntu but when I put in my home burned disk it doesn't read it correctly and makes loud clicking noises.\nI burned it on a TDK CD-R80 700 MB CD from Windows 7 and even did the confirm to make sure it burned correctly.  It has never read CDs like that before, so it's weird.  \nShould I just make another CD?  Or is there something wrong with the Macbook.\n\nA: First, the CD with Windows 7 is not a CD.  Windows 7 does not fit on a CD, and neither does Ubuntu anymore.  You need a DVD.  Second, I wouldn't think that CD you got with Windows on it is writable, you may need to make another DVD.  Just burn the Ubuntu image to the DVD and you should be set.  If you don't have a DVD, you can do a crude hack that I came up with to install from USB really easily.  I'll put it here, but you will need some terminal knowledge.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the EFI hidden partition.  mkdir mnt ; sudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 mnt\n\n*Extract the Ubuntu iso.  You can use \"The Unarchiver\" from the Mac App Store.\n\n*Grab the file called grubx64.efi or similar.  It may also be named bootx64.efi.  Put this in mnt/EFI/BOOT and name it BOOTX64.EFI\n\n*You need to copy the iso image to a flash drive.  This will delete all data on the flash drive.  dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/disk<usbdisk> bs=4m.  You can find what disk is the flash drive by using diskutil list\n\n*When this finishes, take your drive out and put it back in.  It may take a while.  Using the rdisk variant of the device node may make it faster.\n\n*Restart the computer holding the option key.  Select EFI Boot\n\n*The EFI GRUB menu will load up if you did all this correctly, and you can boot Ubuntu.\n\n\nAgain, this is only needed if you want to do an installation from USB on your mac.  Even then I am sure there is another way, such as rEFIt.\n", "Q: How can I open pdfs in firefox using evince (not acrobat)?

You can check how compatible certain applications are with Wine by visiting the AppDB section of the WineHQ site and checking out ratings by software version.\nHere are the ratings for the autoCAD software you have listed, for example: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=86\n\nA: Another option would be to install Windows into VirtualBox or similar app. Then you could run Windows inside of Linux.\n\nA: If you working with these applications for a living, then you are better of without Ubuntu as your computer's main Operating System. There are quite a number of alternatives that others have suggested, and I will attempt to review them from my point of view:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing them via wine is VERY BAD advice. Yes, you read it correctly. Especially when you work professionally with these applications. Wine is a compatibility layer for windows Portable Executable file format. It is a nice try in implementation and a great idea for a piece of software, but there are a bazillion possible issues that could cause your application to crash, or not being able to work at all. Compatibility is not something that is guaranteed (despite what the folks there are attempting to make you believe via appdb) and I have heard and seen with my eyes countless times where one piece of windows software run perfectly on one computer via wine, and it had multiple issues, on another, exactly same computer with the same specs and the same OS version, both clean installs.\n\n\nTL.DR: Do NOT count on wine for professional work. Especially if you are not a software developer, hacker, computer enthusiast, or somehow have the time and energy required to face multiple compatibility issues your applications may have with wine\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual boot: Dual boot is too, bad advice, especially if you are a novice, considering that so many things could go wrong that you might not have the energy or dedication to fix, that it may as well ruin your first experience with Linux. Bad partitioning schemes, misconfiguration of boot loader and others, are all issues you as a novice will most likely face. They are fixable, but they require great amounts of time and dedication to fix. Not to mention that failure to install Ubuntu properly on a dual boot setup could affect windows as well. If you decide to proceed with dual boot configuration nonetheless, please consider backing up your important windows files before attempting an installation.\nTL.DR: Dual boot configuration is an option, but this too could cause some issues that might ruin your first experience with Ubuntu, and require some technical skills to fix. Unless you have someone to help you, or are sure of what you are doing, you are better off without it. \n\n\n*\n\n*As others have already suggested, working with open source alternatives is a viable solution, if you proceed with replacing windows with Ubuntu. Before commiting to Ubuntu or Linux in general, I would research the kind of open source alternatives to make sure that their quality is on par with commercial software, or at least software you are already using. However you will have to take into account that you may have to invest time in learning to use those particular pieces of software.\n\n\nTL.DR: You could work with open source alternatives, but make sure that they are of high quality, and that you can learn how to work with them efficiently.\n\n\n*\n\n*Another solution that I think I read up in other people's solutions is installing Ubuntu in a Virtual machine hypervizor such as Virtualbox. This is 100% doable, even for a novice, but virtual machines suffer from a performance penalty due to hypervisor overhead, and considering that CAD software is the kind of software that could use as much processing power as it could get, in my honest opinion you could proceed with the opposite configuration.\n\n*Which is: install Ubuntu in a virtual machine, in your Windows computer, without making any changes to your computer. Sure there is some performance hits from running in a virtual machine, but it will be small enough that most likely you will not notice it. Apart from that, Virtual machines are disposable. You might mess badly in Ubuntu, and that would have 0 impact on your computer. You could just remove it, and reinstall the virtual machine. Or even better, you could take a snapshot of it, and go back to the snapshot if you mess up badly. Snapshots are a virtual machine hypervisor's feature, that allows the Hypervisor (the software that runs the virtual machines) to create a backup of the Virtual machine and it's configuration, including what was in the memory, the disks, the applications installed, at the time of usage, and use those snapshots to restore the virtual machine when needed. In layman's terms: consider it something like Windows' System restore, only 10 times more powerful.\nTL.DR: In my honest opinion, installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine, without any changes in your computer is the safest (and by far easiest) approach. Software for this purpose like VirtualBox is well documented, and with a quick google search, you may even come up with tutorials regarding its usage. Here is a nice one I found for you.\n\nA: If your looking for CAD programs you can attempt to run them under wine.  I can't speak specifically to how those programs you speak of will run under WINE and I tend to try and avoid it because I prefer native applications.\nIf you are willing to try different Linux based applications I would check out this link which gives a good list\nhttp://www.techdrivein.com/2011/08/8-best-cad-apps-for-linux.html\nWine applications will usually work pretty well in Linux once you get them setup maybe with something like Crossover or PlayOnLinux, but you will always have a better experience with native applications and you will be able to put some of the money you would spend on the more expensive Windows applications to make the Open Linux version better to your specific needs by paying a developer or the creators of the application themselves and improving the community that uses them in the process.\nI've also heard you can do a lot of things with Blender.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: I think I killed my portable HD while trying to make Ubuntu bootable from it. How to undo? I have OSX. My HD appears as two drives; one formatted for OSX, and the other FAT32 for everything.

Before you change the boot records, try unmarking one of the partitions and booting.\nIf that doesn't work, the package mbr may be worth looking into.  It is able to install the \"default\" MBR to your disk, which just loads the boot code from the active partition.\nAs per your question, read/follow these bullet points at your own risk.  This stuff has the ability to mess up your partition table.  Back it up using dd if=/dev/sda of=table.bin bs=512 count=1 first.  I would also recommend backing up all your files.  If I understand the docs correctly, doing these commands without -w may prevent them from writing anything without additional user intervention.\n\n\n*\n\n*ms-sys /dev/sda will inspect the hard dist partitions\n\n*Please read the documentation here.  From what I gather, ms-sys can be quite dangerous and is designed to obliterate your entire MBR along with the partition table in several situations.  It would seem you are using the wrong utility for the job.\n\n*ms-sys --ntfs /dev/sdaX where sdaX is your partition with Windows 7 on it.  This might do what you are expecting, but probably not.\n\n\nI think you have the wrong utility for the job here.  This does not \"fix\" MBR's, it destroys and creates them.  You may get lucky and have the new partition table line up with the new one, but I wouldn't count on it.  Try booting a grub CD and typing chainloader (hd0,<win7 partition>)+1 at the prompt and seeing if it boots.  This will help diagnose where your problem is.  If else fails, use your windows installation dist to fix the MBR.\n\nA: Here are the two solutions that have have worked for me.\nBoot Linux and make sure you’ve a working Internet connection and type the following on the terminal.\n1. Solution\nsudo apt-get install syslinux\n\nIf the package got installed, use the following command to write the MBR:\nsudo dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin of=/dev/sda\n\nor (depending on the location)\nsudo dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr/mbr.bin of=/dev/sda\n\n2. Solution\nsudo apt-get install mbr\n\nIf the package got installed use following to write the MBR.\nsudo install-mbr -i n -p D -t 0 /dev/sda\n\nCommon for both\nReplace sda if you want to install the MBR to a different drive. Do not put sda1,sda2,  or sda3. Just put it as sda for the hard disk. Finally reboot and your Windows should boot.\n\nA: To restore the MBR, the accepted method is to use a Windows CD. We didn’t have that luxury. Fortunately we had a Ubuntu Live USB in hand.\nThe method to fix the MBR is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the machine using the Live USB/CD. \n\n*Install lilo sudo apt-get install lilo\n\n*Fix the MBR using lilo using the command: sudo lilo -M /dev/sda mbr\nWorks like a charm!      \n", "Q: XUbuntu Shared Folder In VMware How do I share folders between my Windows partition and Xubuntu 12.04 installed in VMware?\n\nA: So far NTFS is the only reliable method to do this. I've added this line in my /etc/fstab to do this with my laptop:\n/dev/sda5 /mnt/share ntfs-3g defaults 0 0\n\nBut first you'll probably want to do the following before adding the line:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate the /dev name for your Windows partition. Mine is /dev/sda5.\n\n*Create a mount directory: mkdir /mnt/<dir_name> \n\n*Mount the partition to your mount directory: \n mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda5 /mnt/<dir_name>\nYou can check your mount by issuing:\ndf -kh\n\nYou should see an output like this:\n/dev/sda5       220G   56G  165G  26% /mnt/share\n\nAt this point, go ahead and go to the directory and try writing to the file system with something like:\ntouch test.txt\n\nIf this is successful, then you should be able to add this line to your /etc/fstab:\n/dev/sda5 /mnt/share ntfs-3g defaults 0 0\n\nSave it and reboot.

I found many other types of login problem in Ubuntu when I googled, which were quite different from my case. So any1 kindly help me out.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem. Ctrl+Alt+F1 did not work, neither did Ctrl+Alt+Del. A complete freeze.\nWhat seemed to work for me though was a reboot in the recovery mode which runs Unity 2D instead of 3D. I figured that it must have been due to the graphic card drivers. \nSince I was using GeForce ​GT ​540M, I installed Ironhide:\napt-add-repository ppa:mj-casalogic/ironhide\napt-get update\napt-get install ironhide\n\nThen when configuring ironhide (ironhide-configure), I chose the last configuration from the bottom (apparently the most recent), for 12.04 LTS, and after reboot, it worked just as it used to, without any freezes.\nTry it out yourself!\n\nA: You can try login via command-line:\nType ctrl+alt+F1 at boot to switch to command-line login.\nThen your user name and password will be asked.\nNow you should have logged in successfully.\nIf you have some problems regarding this visit this link.\n", "Q: Very slow KVM in Ubuntu 12.04 I use Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit and KVM, my CPU is Core i5 3.3 GHz and I have 8 GB of DDR3 RAM.

I guess these are the same tools than on an Ubuntu installation, hence I ask my question on this site.\nMy phone is a Sony Ericsson W810i, my laptop is a Lenovo S10-2, my mobile phone provider is o2 Germany.\nI scanned for my mobile phone using the Blueman applet. I connected the dial-up network via the context menu -> Serial Ports -> Dial-up Networking. A notification bubble says that the connection is available on the interface named ppp0.\nipconfig is telling something different: There is no ppp0 or something similar. I only see my eth0 (wired ethernet), eth1 (wifi) and lo interfaces. Of course, I can't ping google.com as the interface really seems to be not present at all.\nWhen the dial-up network is being connected, my mobile phone says that it connects to the internet. Afterwards, I see the active connection on the phone's screen. When successfully connecting with the phone using another computer, it behaves exactly the same, so I guess that the phone isn't the problem.\nI don't know if I configured the Dial-Up correctly. I use the phone number *99# which is very common on most mobile ISPs. I use the APN which my ISP is telling me to use. (I can't find the number on their support page, so I just use the default value *99#.)

It's only on my dual-boot version of Ubuntu that they look wrong (not Wubi, although a previous Wubi-based installation had the same problem).\nNow, I have the proprietary ATI driver and I can use amdcccle to get the colours closer to what they should be, but I can't seem to do anything about colour depth.\nThe depth settings in Xorg are all 24.

Fortunately, I remembered where I'd been tinkering and got the file set back to 24.\n\nA: maybe look at the monitor icc profiles. You can load them in gnome with gnome color manager or just using xcalib. Maybe in windows, some factory default icc profile is loaded for your monitor. \nOn my laptop, the colors look bluish without icc profile (factory standard seems to be 6500K temperature). I use color munki to calibrate the screen to get 4600K color temperature for the profile.

Can someone please explain what's the use of these?\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n*apt-add-repository\nand what are the combinations to use these?\n\nA: A bit of background\nFor update and install Ubuntu like systems uses a concept called software source or repository. \nA repository is collection of libraries, executable.\nThe libraries, software's inside a repo is maintained using a list file. So when somebody update the list file in server , the user will download the latest list file. This list file indicates which files has update and which are not. Using this you can download only the updated component. No need to get whole software.\nBeside Ubuntu official repo, there are many 3rd party developers who distribute there application. Ubuntu provided them a easy way to distribute in Ubuntu. That is called a PPA.\nA PPA is also a repo, but maintained by the developer. Ubuntu doesn't take responsibility.\nYour questions answer\napt-add-repository your-repository-here is to add a PPA as a source of software for your computer.\napt-get-update is to get the latest source file list (not the software, it downloads only the index) from the all added repo. Like you added some repo in first step. Those software won't be available till you execute them.\nsudo apt-get upgrade is to update all available updates for the installed software. It uses the latest list file downloaded as a reference to determine which components needs to be installed . \n\nA: Here is the low down:\nTo compare your current package list with the ones in the repositories, you would run\nsudo apt-get update\n\nTo upgrade all your installed software packages, you would run\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nTo add repositories to your system (Repositories are servers which contain sets of software packages), you would use\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:<repository-name>\n\nYou can do\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nFor complete information on apt-get command see AptGet/Howto\n\nA: Let's have some basic idea on how repository is maintained in Ubuntu and in general Linux distribution. Ubuntu and Linux distributions uses repository to provide software, which are installed by installing one or more of the packages.\nSome terminology\nSoftware: We would say, a software is a program or a set of programs which satisfy a need or goal. Such as \"Cheese\" is a software, which is used for taking photos, recording videos etc.\nPackage: A package is the smallest unit of software, which is distributed by the Ubuntu distribution. A package may be a complete software or a part of a software. A software consists of zero or more packages. \nPackage-list: Ubuntu or in general Linux distributions use package-list, which contains information about available packages. These lists are stored online, which are retrieved by Package management software such as apt-get, aptitude, synaptic or Ubuntu software center in your computer. After these lists are downloaded in your computer, package management software (such as apt-get) know, what packages are available online in the repository.\nRepository: A repository is the name of online storage, which contains packages, package list and package verification information. These sometimes are also referred to as package sources.\nsources.list: This file stores information about enabled repositories. This is located in /etc/apt directory in Ubuntu system. You can view the content of that file by going to /etc/apt folder and double-clicking the sources.list file there. Also note that, some repository lines are also stored in files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory. The files containing repository line in that directory needs to have extensions .list. apt-get and other package management software recognizes repository lines in that directory too.\nRepository-line: Repository-line refers to the format of each (non commented) lines in sources.list file. Also called source line or repo line.\nSource package: Don't be confused with package source, which refers to a repository containing packages. Source package is the package containing source codes which can be compiled to get actual binary programs, which then can be executed and hence run.\nThe correct format of repository source line is \n<type of repository>  <location i.e URI>  <dist-name> <components> \n\nFor example, a repo line can be like this one\n  deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main\n\nHere, it means, the repository is for binary packages, which are hosted in http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu and this repository is for Ubuntu precise (12.04) and this repository contains the main (software which are officially supported by Canonical) component.\n\n\n*\n\n*Type: deb is the type of repository, it indicates it is a binary repository, not a source repository, which has type deb-scr. Binary repository contains compiled packages, as opposed to source repository which contains source packages.\n\n*Location: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu location of the repository.\n\n*Dist-name: precise is the distribution name of Ubuntu release. For Ubuntu 12.04 it is precise, 11.10 is oneiric.\n\n*Component: main is indicating the component of repository. Ubuntu repository are divided into four parts. \n\n\n*\n\n*Main - Which contains free and open source software, officially supported\n\n*Universe - These softwares are not supported by Canonical, but those are maintained by the community. \n\n*Restricted - These softwares are supported by Canonical, but aren't free. These are supported to provide some essential drivers\n\n*Multiverse - These are also non-free softwares, and not supported by Canonical.\n\n\n\nSee this page for more information.\nExplanation of the commands\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get update\nThis command checks if your system has up to date package list and if not retrieves the package list files stored in online repository. For example, if your sources.list file contains lines like this deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main, it checks your system whether you have the package list (of binary packages) for main component. If it finds that you don't have the list or your list is outdated, it will fetch the list from the repository. \nIf you are really interested to see the package list stored in your Ubuntu system, go to /var/lib/apt/lists directory to see them. The package list are stored there after fetching.\nNote: there can be many method to fetch those list, which are beyond the scope of this answer.\n\n*sudo apt-get upgrade \nThis command downloads and installs the updated version of packages. This command does not download and install the packages if you have already installed them. Also, it does not remove any packages. So, if an upgrade of a package X requires removal of package Y, this command does not upgrade package X at all. \n\n*apt-add-repository \nThis command is used to add a repository in your system. Adding a repository means, adding the ability to install packages from a certain online source, not installing all packages from there. \nThis command needs the repository source line or PPA links. \nTo add a regular repository: use sudo apt-add-repository <repo-line>\nsuch as sudo apt-add-repository deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise universe\nTo add a PPA repsitory: use sudo apt-add-repository PPA-Name\nsuch as sudo apt-add-repository ppa:gwibber-daily/ppa\nNote 1: Bear in mind that you can use both apt-add-repository or add-apt-repository command. \nNote 2: Adding PPA with this command actually checks Launchpad.net site for the existence of that PPA and creates a file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory with PPA name containing the standard format of repository line. \nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nLaunchpad is a web application and website that allows users to develop and maintain software, particularly free software. Launchpad is developed and maintained by Canonical Ltd.\n\nAnd it is the same Canonical Ltd, which is official sponsor of the Ubuntu.\nNotes on PPA repository: You may have noticed that, if you add a PPA, the repository source line is not copied in /etc/apt/sources.list file. So, where do they go?\nThose lines go to a file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory and the file is saved with this format: <PPA-name>-<dist-name>.list. (The file name format may not always follow the above rule in that directory for some PPAs) \nFor example, if you use PPA:gwibber-daily/ppa, a file will be created with the name gwibber-daily-ppa-precise.list which will contain the repository line in standard format. \nThe content of file in my Ubuntu is --\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gwibber-daily/ppa/ubuntu precise main\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/gwibber-daily/ppa/ubuntu precise main\n\nYou have noticed that, that command added a repo line in standard format. Also, it automatically enabled the repository for source packages. (Note the line beginning with deb-src indicating a repository of source packages)\nThese conversion from PPA name to repository line is done by apt-add-repository and it is of no surprise because, Launchpad.net is owned by Canonical Ltd, which is also the sponsor of Ubuntu.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Apt-get manual\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n", "Q: WMI Windows Management Instrumentation on Ubuntu Is there a tool for accessing windows'wmi interface? \nI know once there was wmic-client (hardy) but it has been removed. \nI'd like to administrate some windows machines remotely trough shell: i.e. remove software. \nAt least does someone knows if there is a psexec or similar utility?\nThanks\n\nA: There's a procedure, I'm testing right not if works:\nhttp://techedemic.com/2012/11/05/installing-wmic-in-ubuntu-12-04-lts-64-bit-desktop/\n", "Q: Nautilus left pane does not expand I would prefer the left pane of Nautilus to behave like Windows file manager.

I am having different times computer freezes, and have the error that came from the log viewer:\nAMI BIOS detected: BIOS may corrupt low RAM, working around it.\nMost people say that it can be that the RAM is faulty, and it should be replaced. Others say it is the Ubuntu Kernel. I am also getting answers that the BIOS have a bug somewhere.\nI would like to know - what can it be? Can this error make the computer freeze? \nThis isn't good.... any help??\n\nA: This warning message basically means that some systems are known to have a BIOS that uses some parts of the low 64K memory region as a temporary storage, which means this memory should not be used by Linux at the same time (you get weird memory corruption bugs).  The kernel has detected that your machine is on the list of machines known to suffer from this problem and has marked this memory region so that it cannot be used by Linux.\nThis prevents any clashes between the BIOS and Linux.  So, you don't need to worry, the kernel has taken care to prevent any memory corruption issues for you automatically.\nThe error message comes from arch/x86/kernel/setup.c in the kernel.\n", "Q: Software emulated OpenGL with higher version than my graphics card supports I have an Intel GMA 950 chipset in my netbook. I want to learn how to write OpenGL shader programs with this fantastic tutorial and therefore need OpenGL 3.3. Sadly, my graphics card only supports OpenGL 1.4.\nI think that MESA can emulate OpenGL in software, so I'm wondering if it can emulate OpenGL 3.3 without any hardware accelleration (performance is not a problem, since this is only for learning and testing puroses, even excluding profiling).\nIs there any possibility to do this?\n\nA: What you're attempting to do here, negates any advantages you would have coding in OpenGL. OpenGL is a set of hardware calls, translating that into CPU int or fp. \nAdd an extra step in the CALL, SOLVE, RENDER. So it'd be CALL, TRANSCODE, SOLVE[slower], RECODE, RENDER.\nThe whole call solve render happens in fractions of fractions of a second, so adding in transcode, and a recode, would at least take .010 each, thereby destroying your fps.\n", "Q: Cannot install apt-fast During installation of apt-fast the screen looped and after a while I closed the window.\nHow can I fix it?\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nSetting up apt-fast (1.7.2-1~precise1) ...\ndebconf: DbDriver \"config\": /var/cache/debconf/config.dat is locked by another process: Resource temporarily unavailable\ndpkg: error processing apt-fast (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n apt-fast\n\n\nA: Try removing the lock file and run.\nTo remove the lock:\nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock\nThen run sudo dpkg --configure -a\n", "Q: Installation Error on MAAS configuration I want to install 64 bit architecture Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server.\nI am having problem while I select option for MAAS server installation.\nWhen script for \"select and install package\" is running, every time\nit is stopped and if I skip that stage; then grub installation is failed.\nSo I don't assume that it is a hardware error.

Double click on the file in Ubuntu and click install.

Let's say I have entered a huge command like this:\nsudo a-huge-command\n\nWhat is the easiest way to delete the whole command with a single shortcut, rather than keep on hitting backspace key?\nI'm a Ubuntu newbie looking to use Ubuntu in a professional way.\n\nA: The Bash readline shortcut Ctrl+X+E is very useful indeed when you are working on the command-line. If you are in the process of entering a long command and decide that you want to instead open it in your default text editor, all you have to do is use the shortcut.\nIt makes use of Bash's readline library and this particular shortcut is called the edit-and-execute-command.  You can set your default editor by placing export EDITOR=\"/usr/bin/vi\" in ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_aliases.\nEnter bind -P to see your current readline bindings and refer to man readline or the Ubuntu manpages online for more information. \n\nA: I also use Esc+Backspace to delete all previous characters until a special character. This is same is Alt+Backspace.  Handy if you're just deleting a few words at a time.\n\nA: I'm usually using Alt+Backspace. If you are using bash, this will let you delete untill the previous special character (/, ;, , etc.). If you are using zsh, it will remove the slashes and semicolons as well. It is a lot faster than just hitting Backspace.\nIn bash, this is different from Ctrl+w in the sense that Ctrl+w deletes the previous word wheres Alt+Backspace deletes until the previous special character is found. In zsh, both key combinations do the same thing\n\nA: Here is a listing of keyboard shortcuts that can be used with the bash shell.\nCtrl + A    Go to the beginning of the line you are currently typing on\nCtrl + E    Go to the end of the line you are currently typing on\nCtrl + L    Clears the Screen, similar to the clear command\nCtrl + U    Clears the line before the cursor position. If you are at the end of the line, clears the entire line.\nCtrl + H    Same as backspace\nCtrl + R    Lets you search through previously used commands\nCtrl + C    Kill whatever you are running or start a new prompt\nCtrl + D    Exit the current shell\nCtrl + Z    Puts whatever you are running into a suspended background process. fg restores it.\nCtrl + W    Delete the word before the cursor\nCtrl + K    Clear the line after the cursor\nCtrl + T    Swap the last two characters before the cursor\nEsc + T     Swap the last two words before the cursor\nAlt + F     Move cursor forward one word on the current line\nAlt + B     Move cursor backward one word on the current line\nTab         Auto-complete files and folder names\n\nWhat you are wanting to do is achieved by either Ctrl+C or Ctrl+U at the end of the line.\n\nA: For vi key bindings\nWhen usin a vi key map like in bash with set -o vi or in zsh with bindkey -v:\nInsert mode\nIt is just the same keystroke as in default/emacs mode:\nCtrl+U\ndeleting form the current position to the start of line. So it deletes the whole line if the cursor is at the end.\nNormal mode\nThere are multiple ways to delete the line in two keystrokes: \nDelete linewise dd, with the default count of one line:\ndd\nwhich is the simplest in terms of keys touched.\nAnother way is: Go to start of line with ^, and delete to the end of line with D:\n^D\nThese both delete the entire line, not only to the left, like Ctrl+U in insert mode, or the variant bleow.\nIf you are at the end of line currently, so you do not need to delete anything to the right, this would also do:\nDelete from here d, to start of line ^:\nd^\nYou can use these all from inset mode, you need the usual escape first to go to normal mode. For example to delete the whole line from insert mode, use:\nEscdd\n\nA: Alt+# (i.e., Alt+Shift+3) will comment out the current command and continue on the next line.\nFor example, if you type t, e, s, t, Alt+#, you'll get:\nyou@computer$ #test\nyou@computer$ \n\nIf you want to get your old command back, you can press the up arrow and delete the hash character (Up, Home, Delete or Up, Ctrl+A, Delete).\nI think it's a feature of GNU Readline, since it works in Bash, Python, and MySQL.\n\nA:  Ctrl + C - in addition to interrupting running commands, it may be used to \"interrupt\" your command line input as well. \nIn contrast to the  Ctrl + U, you will still see what you have typed but your cursor will jump to the new line and you will get an empty command line prompt.\n\nA: Use Ctrl+U to cut text from cursor position to the beginning of the command line. Later, if you want, use Ctrl+Y to paste the cut text.\nIf you just want to discard the current command line and get a new clean prompt hit Ctrl+C.\nFor more reference please check the Ubuntu  documentation for Using The Terminal\n\nA: Ctrl +  U should help you.\nBelow are the rest of the options available.\nGrabbed from here\nUNIX understands several control-key commands, commands you enter by holding down the control key (ctrl) while striking a second key\nCTRL +  S - freezes the screen and stops any display on the screen from continuing\n(equivalent to a no-scroll key) (sometimes takes a moment to work)\nCTRL + Q - un-freezes the screen and lets screen display continue\nCTRL +  C - interrupts a running program\nCTRL +  \\ - same as CTRL -  C but stronger (used when terminal doesn't respond)\nCTRL +  Z - suspends a running program (use the fg command to continue the program, see s$\nCTRL +  H - deletes last character typed\nCTRL +  W - deletes last word typed\nCTRL +  U - deletes last line typed\nCTRL +  R - searches text from history\nCTRL +  D - ends text input for many UNIX programs, including mail and write.\nNote:\nWhen we delete using CTRL + W or CTRL + U, we are also performing a (edit) \"cut\" (yank in) operation (delete and store in buffer/clipboard).

Try sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g or download from http://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-download/. ntfs-3g includes ntfsprogs.\nntfsprogs is a suite of NTFS utilities based around a shared library. The tools are available for free and come with full source code.\n\nmkntfs: Create an NTFS volume on a partition\nntfscat: Print a file on the standard output\nntfsclone: Efficiently backup/restore a volume at the sector level\nntfscluster: Given a cluster, or sector, find the file\nntfsfix: Forces Windows to check NTFS at boot time\nntfsinfo: Dump a file’s attributes, completely\nntfslabel: Display or set a volume’s label\nntfslib: Move all the common code into a shared library\nntfsls: List directory contents\nntfsresize: Resize an NTFS volume\nntfsundelete: Find files that have been deleted and recover them\nntfswipe: Write zeros over the unused parts of the disk\nntfsdefrag: Defragment files, directories and the MFT\nntfsck: Perform consistancy checks on a volume\nnttools: Command-line tools to view/change an offline NTFS volume, e.g. ntfscp, ntfsgrep, ntfstouch, ntfsrm, ntfsrmdir, ntfsmkdir\nntfsdiskedit: Walk the tree of NTFS ondisk structures (and alter them)\n\nBe careful with these utilities, they might damage the filesystem, or your hard disk !\n\n(Source: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/ntfsprogs.htm)\nWith ntfs-3g installed (sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g) you should execute the following commands in a terminal:\nsudo ntfsfix /dev/partitionName\n\nAfter this command you should expect the following output:\n~$ sudo ntfsfix /dev/sdb3\nMounting volume... FAILED\nAttempting to correct errors...\nProcessing $MFT and $MFTMirr...\nReading $MFT... OK\nReading $MFTMirr... OK\nComparing $MFTMirr to $MFT...

OK\nNTFS volume version is 3.1.\nNTFS partition /dev/sdb3 was processed successfully.\n\nAfter this step you should be able to access your external drive partition as usual, mount or use nautilus to access your files.\n\nA: GPT is the GUID Partition Table, which is the next-generation partitioning system used on Macs, UEFI-based PCs, and disks over 2TiB in size. It can also be used on smaller disks even on BIOS-based systems, so long as you don't expect to boot Windows from such disks. As the fdisk warning message notes, fdisk doesn't support GPT, so you shouldn't attempt to use fdisk on this disk. Instead, use gdisk (part of the gdisk or gptfdisk package, depending on how you install it) or parted.\nGPT doesn't have anything to do with your problem, though. The mount error message indicates an I/O error, which most probably indicates a hardware fault. You might try running a SMART test on the disk using a tool like gsmartcontrol (GUI) or smartctl (text-mode). This should turn up any hardware fault, but the output of a SMART test can be hard to interpret. Since you say it's an external drive, it could also be a loose or damaged cable, so you might try reseating or replacing it. Cable faults won't turn up in a SMART test.\nMore generally, if it's not actually a hardware fault, you cannot do adequate filesystem tests on NTFS from either Linux or OS X; only Windows provides tools to do this. You may not be able to mount an NTFS disk that needs filesystem checks, so you must be able to get an NTFS disk to a Windows system from time to time to deal with such problems. If you never use the disk on a Windows system, NTFS is the wrong filesystem to use on it.\nFor Linux-only use, it's best to use a Linux-native filesystem, such as ext2fs, ext3fs, ext4fs, ReiserFS, XFS, JFS, or perhaps Btrfs. (I wouldn't use ext2fs on a 1TB disk, though.) If you use the disk for both Linux and OS X, I'd use either FAT or HFS+. Despite its age, FAT is still the best-supported cross-OS filesystem. It has problems with a maximum file size of 4GiB, though, which can be a problem if you store multimedia or other big files. HFS+ is OK for Linux/OS X use, provided you understand how to disable the journal and deal with permissions issues. (If the journal is enabled, Linux won't write to HFS+ unless you use an override mount option, which may reduce safety.)\n", "Q: Errors when opening Microsoft office The installation process was successful but I get error messages when opening any application.

I've been using GPRename to batch-rename files; this is rather more efficient than individually correcting each file, but still seems to be less efficient than it might be, primarily because either I don't understand the regex syntax used, or because the regex implementation is incomplete1\nGiven a list of files of the following syntax:\n(01) - title of file1.avi\n(02) - title of file2.avi\n(03) - title of file3.avi\n\nI attempted to use the 'replace' (with the regex option selected, the case-sensitive option deselected):\n(\\(\\d{2}\\))\n\nThe preview then shows (given that I've specified no 'replace with' option as yet):\ntitle of file1.avi\ntitle of file2.avi\ntitle of file3.avi\n\nWhich is great, clearly the regex is identifying the correct group (the (01)). Now, what I was hoping to do (using the JavaScript syntax) in the 'replace with' option is use:\n$1\n\n(I also tried using '$1', \\1 and '\\1')\nThis was just to check that I could access the matched group, and it seems I can't, the matched group is, as I suppose might be expected, replaced with the literal replacement string.\nSo, my question: is it possible to match a particular group of characters, in this case the numbers within the brackets, and then insert those into the replacement string? Therefore:\n(01) title of file1.avi\n(02) title of file2.avi\n(03) title of file3.avi\n\nBecomes:\n01 title of file1.avi\n02 title of file2.avi\n03 title of file3.avi\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I absolutely suspect the former, personally.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, it appears you cannot; and that it's an incomplete regex implementation at fault.\nThis line at the end of all the GPRename locale translations seems to make that obvious:\n\nmsgid \"Backreferences with Regular expression cannot be use\n       as $1 is considered a Perl variable.\"\n\nSince you are familiar with Perl regular expressions, may I recommend you use the excellent rename command-line utility instead?\n\n\n*\n\n*Always use the -n switch first to get a preview.\n\n*There's a typo in your regex - it should be \\((\\d{2})\\), with the grouping inside the escaped parentheses.\n\n*Example:\n$ rename -n 's/\\((\\d{2})\\)/$1/' *.avi\n(01) title of file1.avi renamed as 01 title of file1.avi\n(02) title of file2.avi renamed as 02 title of file2.avi\n(03) title of file3.avi renamed as 03 title of file3.avi\n\n\n*Call rename with the -v (verbose) switch and drop the -n to actually perform the renaming.\n\n\nA: In GPRename, you can use Regular Expression like this:\n    Name of file 012.txt\n    Regular Expression: Name of file (\\d).txt\n    Replace: NewFileName_1.txt\n\nWhere:\n    1 = like $1\n\nYou can try it.

There needs to be a way..\nSo summarizing my question: How can I install all Google Chrome versions next to each other?\n\nA: In case anyone else comes across this question - it seems that the Chrome package maintainers have removed the conflict in the 3 published packages - google-chrome-stable / -beta / -unstable. These each install into different directories and via /etc/alternatives, /usr/bin/google-chrome is soft-linked to a particular version (google-chrome-stable by default).\nTested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS w/ Chrome 38 (stable) 39 (beta) and 40 (unstable).\n\nA: You can't do that. This is because all these versions (stable,beta and unstable) conflits with each other. See:\napt-cache show google-chrome-beta | grep Conflict\nConflicts: google-chrome\n\nNow, google-chrome is a general name for Linux distros:\nwhich google-chrome\n/usr/bin/google-chrome\n\nI have google-chrome-beta installed on my system:\ndpkg -l | grep google\nii  google-chrome-beta                     22.0.1229.91-r158759                    \n\ndpkg -S /usr/bin/google-chrome\ngoogle-chrome-beta: /usr/bin/google-chrome\n\nAs you can see google-chrome binary is provided by google-chrome-beta on my system. If I install stable, then it will be provided by stable. So, they conflict with each other.\nIf you try to install google-chrome-beta via .deb package distributed from Google you can see the same effect:\nsudo LC_ALL=C dpkg --simulate -i google-chrome-beta_current_i386.deb\nSelecting previously unselected package google-chrome-beta.\ndpkg: regarding google-chrome-beta_current_i386.deb containing google-chrome-beta:\n google-chrome-beta conflicts with google-chrome\n  google-chrome-stable provides google-chrome and is present and installed.\ndpkg: error processing google-chrome-beta_current_i386.deb (--install):\n conflicting packages - not installing google-chrome-beta\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n google-chrome-beta_current_i386.deb\n\nI have changed google-chrome-stable with beta and tried to install via .deb package.\nBut I am not sure what happens if you can get (?) chrome source code and compile it, then try to run it via this compiled binary. Maybe this could work for Chromium. Since you can download its source code.\n\nA: There are Chromium binaries available that do not pollute inside /bin, but can run directly from any folder. \nYou can download the binaries from here and extract them to any folder of your choice, and run them side by side.\n\nA: This is possible, but you'll probably have to download the package\n  apt-get download google-chrome-beta\nThen you'll have to extract the package files:\n  dpkg -X google-chrome-beta-xyzabc.deb  dir/\nFrom here you can probably run the program fine, but if not,\nthen you'll have to fiddle around with the control files and work out what the install package is doing and where it puts things and edit it so there are no more conflicts.\nThis is where you're going to need to spend a lot of time reading about .deb files and you'll be wanting to test things in a virtual machine so you don't mess up your install.\n\nA: Disclaimer: This solution works now, but not guaranteed to be future-proof.\nAfter installing stable (and its dependencies) the convenient way...\nDownload a .deb file from here (I'm using unstable in the example):\nhttps://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel\nmkdir tmp\ndpkg-deb -R google-chrome-unstable_current_amd64.deb tmp\nsudo cp -r tmp/opt/google/chrome-unstable /opt/google\nsudo chmod 4755 /opt/google/chrome-unstable/chrome-sandbox\n\nIf the unstable has any different dependencies from the one you installed it will probably fail to run - or you have to install those libs manually.\n", "Q: apt-get issue after upgrading to 12.04 I have recently upgraded my cluster from 11.10 to 12.04.

Also, how good are the closed source, open source, and Bumblebee drivers for these newer cards compared to support for the Intel HD4000?\nLong version/Background, if any info here is helpful:\nI'm thinking of ordering a laptop from PC Specialist (a UK company who actually sell machines without Windows pre-installed) with the following specifications:\nGenesis IV: 15.6\" AUO Matte 95% Gamut LED Widescreen (1920x1080)\nIntel® Core™i5 Dual Core Mobile Processor i5-3210M (2.50GHz) 3MB\n4GB SAMSUNG 1600MHz SODIMM DDR3 MEMORY (1 x 4GB)\n120GB INTEL® 520 SERIES SSD, SATA 6 Gb/s (upto 550MB/sR | 520MB/sW)\nIntel 2 Channel High Definition Audio + MIC/Headphone Jack\nGIGABIT LAN & WIRELESS INTEL® N135 802.11N (150Mbps) + BLUETOOTH\nNow, as I want this laptop mainly for work and not for games, I would be more than content with the HD4000 integrated chip which comes with the processor. However, for compatibility reasons, I am not able to get the specs I want unless I choose a \nNVIDIA GeForce GT 630M 1GB graphics card, which I don't have a great deal of use for.\nI'm willing to buy it, however, as it's still cheaper than any other laptop with the specs I want. However, I know that Linux power management isn't fantastic with open-source graphics drivers, and I don't much about Bumblebee. Basically, whilst I'm happy to 'tolerate' the card being there, I don't want to experience any negative effects on the rest of my system (battery, performance etc) and if there are likely to be any, I might reconsider my purchase. So if anyone can advise me on the effects, I would be very grateful, since I doubt I can just turn the card off.\nThankyou for any assistance :)\n\nA: The card will be 'off' the latest 'M' series nvidia cards which use the Optimus system only activate the nvidia card when a graphics hungry application requires it to.  In Ubuntu, this doesn't work by default, Bumblebee will force the system to use the nvidia GPU to do the maths but it will still be the intel chip doing the drawing.  Put simply, if you don't need the nvidia GPU, get the machine and don't bother with bumblebee.\n", "Q: Revert F3 and F4 behavior in byobu? With a fresh 12.04 installation of Ubuntu, byobu's interpretation of the function keys seems to have changed.  F3 and F4 will still change the active tab on the current session, but it changes it for all connections.  Previously, if you have two active connections to the same user (same session) with User 1 on shell 0/tab 0 and User 2 on shell 0/tab 0, when User 2 pressed F3 , they would be changed to tab 1 while User 1 would remain on tab 0.  With the latest version in 12.04, when User 2 presses F3, all connected users are moved to shell 1/tab 1.  Is there any way to re-enable the old behavior?  I have looked at the /etc/byobu directory and only found backend and socketdir files there.  Toggling backend between tmux and screen did not seem to render any difference.  Anyone know what, if any, configuration option exist to control this?\n\nA: 12.04 byobu now defaults to tmux as a backend instead of screen. \nSo to get the byobu you are used to back, just type: \nbyobu-select-backend\n\nand select the \"screen\" option instead of \"tmux\".\n", "Q: SSH key plus password I see there are continuous attempts to login into my computer via ssh using usernames, like joan florin root from 60.169.22.118, \n-how can I forbid ssh access and only allow it to users with specific key. \n-or for now how can I block traffic from that specific ip. \n-or any other ways of securing more the connection to my home network. \nI do have vpn, but the problem is, the service goes down every now and then, so ssh is the only sure, or constant service that can tell me when my server is up and running at home. \n\nA: Edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nAdd a line like\nAllowUsers kmassada\n\nNow only that user will be allowed to ssh in.

(This seems to be a good thing to have, maybe as a link for more info, on the How To Do It guides.) \n\nA: Disclaimer: Creating a bootable USB without using the downloaded ISO but the pre-installed Ubuntu is a little complicated for new users.

Anyway the same answer is useful for both your case and the previous question, you can reach it right here: Installing/Cloning from Ubuntu Installed and Running on USB to HD\nAdditionally you may wish to take a look at this answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/176110/9598 and this: https://askubuntu.com/a/106585/9598 or this: https://askubuntu.com/a/106585/9598. Note that they are basically the same answer but additional answers provided by different users in the same questions may give you a clue on how to do this task.\nFor your specific case, I suggest you to first check out how much disk space is your current pre-installed operating system using. This detail is important in order to gather the proper size's USB/SD/Micro SD Card so that the whole operating system can fit on that device. I am aware that Cloning can be done from smaller disks to a bigger one. But I haven't experienced yet with cloning from bigger to smaller disks so I can't suggest you about it. Which lead us to the next:\nIf the File system is bigger than the USB/SD/Micro SD Card, let's say: you have your current pre-installed OS In a 160 GB Hard disk drive, but it is only using 4 GB for the OS and other 20GB for documents, music, pictures and other data, you should decrease the partition itself in order to fit to the new device's size, let's analyze the scenery:\nHaving in mind a disk as of 160GB with 24 GB Total disk used (20 data, 4 OS) and wish to clone your OS into a 16GB USB/SD/Micro SD Card.\nThe recipe:\nIngredients\n\n\n*\n\n*A Live CD/USB with Ubuntu and gparted\n\n*A Live CD/USB with Clonezilla\nThe directions\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to decrease the current 160GB partition to something like\n30 GB and leave the other 130GB unused.\n\n*Then let's create a container for spare space, the same size as your\ndata, 30 GB so far. (from now on \"spare partition\")\n\n*Now let's create a bigger container for the data backup, the last\n100GB (from now on \"backup partition\")\n\n*Next, move your data (documents, pictures, music, etc.) into your\nbackup partition in order to keep your data apart from the cloning\nprocess.\n\n*We need to match the new device's size and the partition size, so\nlet's reduce again the system partition for a maximum of 16GB,\nleaving the remaining 14GB unused. You will then have a partitioning\nlike this:\n|--SYSTEM-16gb--||--UNUSED-14gb--||---SPARE-30gb---||---------BACKUP-100gb---------|\n\n*This is the point where we start Clonezilla and run a cloning from\ndevice-device, to work directly from a disk-partition to\ndisk-partition, in this case we are going to clone from \"partition\nto disk\"\n\n*After the cloning finishes and if you already checked that the USB\nproperly boots, then we need to revert the process in order to leave\nyour computer \"as it was\" before cloning your OS.\n\n*First we're going to expand the system partitions from its current\nsize to the unused 14 gb in order to make it as of 30GB, size where\nyou can put your backup data again in order to:\n\n*Remove the spare-30gb and the backup-100gb partitions in order to\nleave that space unused.\n\n*Expand the system partition to fill the 160gb of your hard disk\n drive.\n\n*And enjoy.\nThat seems to be a hard process but it is not indeed, it will take an hour or less, depending on your computer and the speed of your hard disk drive/optical drive (which will read the Clonezilla process).\nFor the operations related to resizing the partitions you can use gparted in a live CD, and you may wish to take a look at the answers to this question: Why I'm seeing a lock besides the partition I'm trying to modify with gparted? in order to understand how to achieve that task, further information about gparted and Live Gparted images for both CD and USB can be reached right here: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/\nREMEMBER: That you can't resize a partition that is currently in use (the system partition). So make sure you first run all the partitioning process before starting the cloning process.\nServe it cold and in companion with your favorite drink.\nGood luck!\nSome extra-explanations:\n\n\n*\n\n*The spare-partition: It is not required at all but I strongly suggest to make it in order to have extra space in order to keep\nyour data apart from the cloning process or in case that you need\nextra space for resizing/moving your partitions.\n\n*When cloning: make sure you answer \"yes\" (just a \"y\" without quotation marks) when the Clonezilla asks you if you wish to clone\nthe boot sector, otherwise your USB/SD/Micro SD Card won't boot.\n\n*Remember: It is strongly recommended to leave the OS alone, (with no user\ndata) and to include the all the software that you wish to keep in\nthe cloned device before cloning, nevertheless, after cloning you\ncan run updates and/or install new software in the cloned device.\n\n*You may wish to use dd instead of Clonezilla, of which I won't give\nany explanation but you can find lots of answers over here.\n\n*When serving the recipe: make sure to include a glass with ice and\nCuban rum for me.\n\n", "Q: Is there an easy way to locate various programs that seem to be 'hidden'? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat are Unity's keyboard and mouse shortcuts? \n\nI just updated my wife's 10.04 to 12.04 over the weekend and on occasion I must use her computer. Is there an easy way to locate various programs that seem to be 'hidden'. I WAS able to at one point locate the 'konsole' (terminal program) but found my method of navigation extremely convoluted. Is there a better way to have ready access to less popular programs?\nThank you\n\nA: If you press the key with the Windows emblem on it the Ubuntu Unity Dash will come up at the top of the screen (it may take a few seconds). If you type a few characters of the program name the program should appear in the list below. Files with similar names, if any will also appear. Click on the program you want to start.\nThere are \"lenses\" at the bottom of the dash that can be used to search for particular categories of items. For example there are lenses to find music and videos. Additional lenses can be installed.\n", "Q: WireShark not working on 12.04, how do I get this working? I want to want to read the packets of data that are transferred to and from my laptop. I installed wireshark from the Software Center, but the software isn't able to detect my wireless lan.\nAny ideas, what might I be doing wrong?\n\nA: It probably isn't working because you need to run it as root.\nTry launching it using this command.\ngksudo wireshark&\n\nLet me know if this works.\n\nA: Wireshark does not have necessary privileges to access network interfaces while being run normally under the default settings.  However, you should try to run as few programs as possible as root, and wireshark is no exception.  Instead, there is a better way.\nCheck out /usr/share/doc/wireshark-common/README.Debian and try this:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common\nsudo usermod -a -G wireshark username\n\nSelect \"yes\" after running the first command (which tells wireshark that you want to use groups to control capture access), and replace \"username\" with your username in the second (which adds you to the group \"wireshark\").  Then simply log out and log back in again, and you should be good to go!\n", "Q: laptop crashed: why? my linux (ubuntu 12.04) laptop crashed, and I am trying to figure out why.\n# last\nsds      pts/4        :0               Tue Sep  4 10:01   still logged in   \nsds      pts/3        :0               Tue Sep  4 10:00   still logged in   \nreboot   system boot  3.2.0-29-generic Tue Sep  4 09:43 - 11:23  (01:40)    \nsds      pts/8        :0               Mon Sep  3 14:23 - crash  (19:19)    \n\nthis seems to indicate a crash at 09:42 (= 14:23+19:19).\nas per another question, I looked at /var/log:\nauth.log:\nSep  4 09:17:02 t520sds CRON[32744]: pam_unix(cron:session): session closed for user root\nSep  4 09:43:17 t520sds lightdm: pam_unix(lightdm:session): session opened for user lightdm by (uid=0)\n\nno messages file\nsyslog:\nSep  4 09:24:19 t520sds kernel: [219104.819975] CPU0: Package power limit normal\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: imklog 5.8.6, log source = /proc/kmsg started.\n\nkern.log:\nSep  4 09:24:19 t520sds kernel: [219104.819969] CPU1: Package power limit normal\nSep  4 09:24:19 t520sds kernel: [219104.819971] CPU2: Package power limit normal\nSep  4 09:24:19 t520sds kernel: [219104.819974] CPU3: Package power limit normal\nSep  4 09:24:19 t520sds kernel: [219104.819975] CPU0: Package power limit normal\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: imklog 5.8.6, log source = /proc/kmsg started.\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpuset\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpu\n\nI had a computation running until 9:24, but the system crashed 18 minutes later!\nkern.log has many pages of these:\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000] total RAM covered: 8086M\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000]  gran_size: 64K  chunk_size: 64K         num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: 38M\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000]  gran_size: 64K  chunk_size: 128K        num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: 38M\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000]  gran_size: 64K  chunk_size: 256K        num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: 38M\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000]  gran_size: 64K  chunk_size: 512K        num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: 38M\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000]  gran_size: 64K  chunk_size: 1M  num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: 38M\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000]  gran_size: 64K  chunk_size: 2M  num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: 38M\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000]  gran_size: 64K  chunk_size: 4M  num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: 38M\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000]  gran_size: 64K  chunk_size: 8M  num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: 38M\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000]  gran_size: 64K  chunk_size: 16M         num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: 38M\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000] *BAD*gran_size: 64K      chunk_size: 32M         num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: -16M\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000] *BAD*gran_size: 64K      chunk_size: 64M         num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: -16M\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000]  gran_size: 64K  chunk_size: 128M        num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: 0G\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000]  gran_size: 64K  chunk_size: 256M        num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: 0G\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000]  gran_size: 64K  chunk_size: 512M        num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: 0G\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000]  gran_size: 64K  chunk_size: 1G  num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: 0G\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    0.000000] *BAD*gran_size: 64K      chunk_size: 2G  num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM: -1G\n\ndoes this mean that my RAM is bad?!\nit also says\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    2.944123] EXT4-fs (sda1): INFO: recovery required on readonly filesystem\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    2.944126] EXT4-fs (sda1): write access will be enabled during recovery\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    3.088001] firewire_core: created device fw0: GUID f0def1ff8fbd7dff, S400\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    8.929243] EXT4-fs (sda1): orphan cleanup on readonly fs\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    8.929249] EXT4-fs (sda1): ext4_orphan_cleanup: deleting unreferenced inode 658984\n...\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    9.343266] EXT4-fs (sda1): ext4_orphan_cleanup: deleting unreferenced inode 525343\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    9.343270] EXT4-fs (sda1): 56 orphan inodes deleted\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    9.343271] EXT4-fs (sda1): recovery complete\nSep  4 09:43:16 t520sds kernel: [    9.645799] EXT4-fs (sda1): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode.

I would do the following in order, and see if each one makes a difference before continuing on to the next.\n1) As Tom Brossman suggested in his link, I would run a RAM test (Memtest86+). It is available from the GRUB menu of any installation or LiveCD. Do whatever is the most thorough (it should be fairly obvious and this would need to be done overnight).\n2) From a LiveCD, run fsck.ext4 (without mounting the drive)\nsudo fsck.ext4 -cf /dev/sda1\n\n3) This post suggests that the *BAD*gran_size errors may be caused by not enabling the MTRR sanitizer. Edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg and change this line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash enable_mtrr_cleanup mtrr_spare_reg_nr=1 mtrr_gran_size=32M mtrr_chunk_size=128M\"\n\nSave the file. Then run\nsudo update-grub\n\nand reboot.\n", "Q: Where is Thunderbird's Tools Menu? I just successfully upgraded from 10.04 to 12.04, and these instructions appear to be exactly what I want.

I cannot find how to indicate what version Thunderbird is other than it was installed as part of 12.04.\nThanks.\n\nA: Another possibility is that the menu bar got disabled.\nRight-click on the free space next to the \"Inbox\" tab and select \"Menu Bar\" if there is no check symbol.\n\nA: Generally to get the menu items, we need to install global menu \nsudo apt-get install thunderbird-globalmenu\nSince you have already installed this, I think the problem should be with your thunderbird.\nTo fix this issue can you try removing the Thunderbird version that is currently installed. and add the ppa provided by mozilla team using \nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-security/ppa\nand install Thunderbird new version (v15 I guess). \nIf the above works then you should be able to access the tools from global menu\n\nA: Tools was there all along. With this version of Ubuntu (12.04) I did not realize that Unity-behaving applications appear to use a common menu at the top of the screen. Problem solved.\n", "Q: No usable Polish keyboard layout I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 with the XFCE desktop, all packages up to date.\nI wanted to set up a keyboard layout for the Polish language (Polish uses the Roman alphabet, with a few additional characters like ą, ł, ż, etc). I went to the keyboard control panel, and under Polish I saw several options - all of them useless to me. One was for Kashubian. One was the obsolete QWERTZ layout. Several variations of DVORAK. And one for Russian - I don't even know what it was doing there. What was missing was the de-facto standard layout, known as \"polski programisty\" (\"Polish programmer's\").\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a package that has the layout I want?\n\n*If not, how do I create my own layout? And where do I send the patch?\n\nA: Take the default Polish layout (the one with the name Polish, with no further specification). This is the programmers layout.\n\nEDIT: Alternatively, you can always do setxkbmap -layout pl -variant basic or just setxkbmap -layout pl, but that will not be kept across sessions. \nBoth XFCE and the default Unity shell use the same layouts, just with different interfaces. I guess the reason that XDE uses a tree structure is that all the different variants of the Polish layout are defined in the same file, /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pl. By the way, it is a simple text file; creating your own layout is not hard.\n\nA: I was having the same problem after update to xbuntu 13.10.\nSelecting Polish programmers keyboard is even more counter intuitive, as the selection dialog shows a tree instead of a list.\nHere the way to select Polish programmers keyboard:\n\nThis dialog is accessible via Settings Manager > Keyboard > Layout > Add/Edit\n", "Q: How do I disable fading animation when changing wallpapers?  I'm using 12.04. When I change wallpapers, I don't want to wait for the old wallpaper to fade out and the new one fade in. Is this possible?\n\nA: To disable this fading is to turn off the hole gtk animations. Do this by editing or creating the file ~/.gtkrc-*.0 and add this line:\ngtk-enable-animations = 0\n\nThen log-off and on again.\nNote: * refers to your gtk version (2 or 3) so replace it with yours.\n\nA: In 13.10 Saucy Salamander, the setting is org.gnome.nautilus.desktop -> background-fade, can be disabled using dconf-editor (Hit Ctrl+F to find it). You don't need to log out or restart something.\n", "Q: What is the purpose of the -9 option in the kill command? Is there a difference between \nkill -9 212121\n\nand\nkill 212121\n\n\nA: kill -9  Meaning: The process will be killed by the kernel; this signal cannot be ignored. 9 means KILL signal that is not catchable or ignorable\nUses: SIGKILL singal\nKill Meaning: The kill command without any signal passes the signal 15, which terminates the process the normal way.\nUses: SIGTERM signal, which can be handled by programmers\n\nA: The kill command will send a defined signal to a process with a given identity (PID):\nkill -<signal> <pid>\n\nOf course we can only kill processes we own, whereas root can kill all processes. See Wikipedia for a nice summary of computing signals.\nSignals kill can send are listed in the manpage. The signal can be represented by name or by number. If no signal is given the default signal 15 resp. TERM is used.\nAll three commands below are therefore identical:\nkill -9 1234\nkill -KILL 1234\nkill -SIGKILL 1234\n\nThe difference between SIGTERM and SIGKILL is the way an application may act on the signal:\n\n\n*\n\n*TERM: an application will be able to terminate, i.e. properly run a shutdown routine. \n\n*KILL: the applications is stopped and killed immediately (which could lead to data loss or raising apport to report a presumed crash in some cases).\n\n\nA: The Ubuntu man page for kill explains the purpose of the -9 switch (admittedly in a rather choppy fashion):\nName     Num   Action    Description\nKILL       9   exit      cannot be blocked\n\n\nHere's what another man page says.\n\nThe command kill sends the specified signal to the specified process or process group. If no signal is specified, the TERM signal is sent. The TERM signal will kill processes which do not catch this signal. For other processes, it may be necessary to use the KILL (9) signal, since this signal cannot be caught.\n\n\nTherefore, using the -9 switch ensures that the process is effectively killed. Even though a frozen or unresponsive process may not respond to a simple TERM signal, it will die when sent a KILL signal.\n\nA: Note that all of the following are synonymous:\nkill -9 1234\nkill -KILL 1234\nkill -SIGKILL 1234\n\nIt's worth pointing out that in the world of signal handling, SIGKILL is one of the few unique ones that is handled by the operating system not the program. When you run kill -9, you're not telling the application to terminate itself, instead you're telling the OS to stop running the program, no matter what the program is doing.\nAfter SIGKILL is sent, the program will immediately be stopped. If any kernel calls are running (e.g. File IO) on the program's behalf, those calls may or may not continue until they finish, depending on the call, but the program itself will not run any more. Note that traced tasks or tasks running under a debugger may behave differently here.\nThe other signal that can't be blocked is SIGSTOP which has a similar effect, but instead freezes the program; you can send SIGCONT later on to resume it. This behavior is completely controlled by the OS, and the program does not get any prior notification.\nAll the other signals are sent to the program; it can handle them however it chooses, or if it ignores the signal then a default behavior is followed. \nHere are a few useful signals that you may find yourself sending to a process:\n\n\n*\n\n*SIGHUP -- hangup\nTells the program that the user disconnected (e.g. SSH session or terminal window was closed).\nUsually does a graceful shutdown of the program.\n\n*SIGINT -- interrupt\nSent when you hit CTRL+C\nUsually means \"stop what you're doing\" -- may or may not kill the program\n\n*SIGTERM  -- terminate\nThe default sent by kill and killall.\nUsually terminates the program... sometimes after the program finishes whatever it's doing.\n\n*SIGSTOP -- stop\nSent when you hit CTRL+Z\nPauses the program, discussed above\n\n*SIGPIPE -- pipe closed\nTells the program that the the pipeline has closed. Usually terminates the program.\nFor example cat /etc/passwd | head -n1 will send SIGPIPE to the cat process after the first line is printed, causing cat to terminate before finishing the whole file.\n\n\nWhile all of these signals happen \"naturally\" in their own setting, you can use the signal to fake a condition to achieve the desired result.\nFor example, if you want to terminate someone's SSH session you can simply kill the process, but by doing so you'll prevent it from updating its HISTORY file, which may be important for security reasons. But instead if you send it SIGHUP, then the process will assume the connection has died and will perform its standard cleanup.\n", "Q: Why doesn't the Scanlogic SL11R-IDE USB-to-ATA adapter work? I am trying to recover data from an old Linux that was installed in a computer on an ATA hard drive. I found a ScanLogic Corp. SL11R-IDE IDE Bridge (04ce:0002), an ATA adapter to USB 1.0 like the one in the picture:\n\nand after switching it on, I plugged it into a laptop with Ubuntu 12.04. I am used to the drives being automatically mounted, but this one doesn't show up in /media. After doing a dmesg, all I got is this:\n[215298.671924] usb 2-1.1: new full-speed USB device number 5 using ehci_hcd\n[215298.767330] scsi19 : usb-storage 2-1.1:1.0\n[215299.841701] usb 2-1.1: reset full-speed USB device number 5 using ehci_hcd\n[215300.017258] usb 2-1.1: reset full-speed USB device number 5 using ehci_hcd\n[215300.197050] usb 2-1.1: reset full-speed USB device number 5 using ehci_hcd\n[215300.372730] usb 2-1.1: reset full-speed USB device number 5 using ehci_hcd\n\nI tried plugging in the adapter to the three different USB ports in my laptop (one of them USB 3.0), but got no luck with any of them. I get different devices under, for example: /dev/bus/usb/003/002 or /dev/bus/usb/002/004, but I don't get any /dev/sdbN links. The output blkid -o list -c /dev/null is just the laptop's partitions.\nI have tried taking out the jumper, putting it as master and as CS Enabled, but didn't change the result.\nIf I plug it into a Windows7 laptop, the device is recognised but nothing is mounted. When I plug it into the Windows7 laptop and connect the device to a VMWare Ubuntu 12.04 session running on Windows7, I get the same results as with the Ubuntu laptop -- the dmesg results as above, but it is not mounted.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The problem is that your USB-IDE chipset is very old and known to be broken (buggy) :\n\n\n*\n\n*Your adapter uses the USB 1.0 Scanlogic (now Cypress Semiconductor) SL11RIDE chipset\n\n*\n\n*This chipset was released sixteen years ago, in 1996-97\n\n*The version you have may not even fully support the USB Mass-storage standard, which was only finalized in 1999.\n\n\n*Even within a few years of release, the SL11RIDE was known to be problematic with IDE hard drives (but worked with optical drives): example\n\n*Its USB implementation is known to be broken, requiring special fixes in the kernel -- see this Ubuntu bug from 8.10\n\n*Upgrading the firmware may work, but there are two problems;\n\n*\n\n*It requires Windows XP or lower\n\n*The firmware seems to be unavailable any more (see instructions at page 9 of this PDF)\n\n\n\nSimple solution\nThe simplest solution, therefore, appears to be to purchase a new USB-to-IDE adapter which is relatively cheap. If you can tell us your country of residence, I can try to recommend an available vendor/device which is known to work well with Linux.\nAlternative solution: rebuild usb kernel modules after patching \"unusual devices\" and hope it works\n\n\n*\n\n*Please add a comment if you need more detailed instructions\n\n*Get the Ubuntu kernel source\n\n*Change to the linux-3.2.0 directory\n\n*In the drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h file, find this part:\n\nUNUSUAL_DEV(  0x04ce, 0x0002, 0x026c, 0x026c,\n            \"ScanLogic\",\n            \"SL11R-IDE\",\n            USB_SC_DEVICE, USB_PR_DEVICE, NULL,\n            US_FL_FIX_CAPACITY),\n\n\n*and edit it to change the first 0x026c to 0x0000, i.e. the line should read:\n\nUNUSUAL_DEV(  0x04ce, 0x0002, 0x0000, 0x026c,\n\n\n*Then rebuild the USB storage modules and move the .ko files to the appropriate kernel under /lib/modules. This patch allows the unusual \"fixes\" to apply to all firmware versions of the SL11RIDE, not just firmware versions 2.xxx.\n\nA: I've had trouble with some old USB adapters on Ubuntu as well. I'm not experienced enough to tell you why, though. But if you have the time, you can always buy a new adapter online. They are really cheap. I got mine for 2 USD. I'm not saying it will solve your problem, but it might be worth testing, plus you usually get a s-ata adapter along as well.\nBuying a new adapter worked for me. Seems like you are far more experienced than me, though. So if you are sure it's not the adapter, please ignore this answer :)\n", "Q: Man pages not finding entry So, I'm not sure what is going on with my system (ubuntu 12.04), but my man pages do not seem to be working.

I copied the .thunderbird directory to it and set up a symlink from /home/username/.thunderbird to this backup directory.\nThunderbird starts correctly, it shows plugins, calendar, address book, all news feeds and all mail accounts.\nBut for POP accounts it shows only the Inbox folder (which is empty) and the Trash folder. All the other folders are missing (Archives, Drafts, Sent).\nWhat I have tried so far and it did not help:\n\n\n*\n\n*click 'Repair folder' from the menu folder;\n\n*Delete .msf files to force Thunderbird to rebuild index;\n\n*Delete Panacea.dat;\n\n*start Thunderbird with -profilemanager to choose the particular profile directory;\n\n*all tips from the official documentation.\n\n\nIt seems like Thunderbird successfully restores all the information from the backup, except the folders and messages for POP mail accounts.\nAny ideas regarding such a strange behavior of Thunderbird?\n\nA: In the original(your backup) .thunderbird  directory there should be a file that is named with a bunch of random letters and/or numbers followed by .default.  That is you profile that has all your data stored in it.  in the screen shot below it is 5euxiyvw.default\n\nPaste that file from the backup into the new .thunderbird directory.  You will then need to open the profiles.ini file and edit the last line to match the name of the new directory.  Here is a screen shot of the file in the above screenshot. As you can see the Path= file was edited to be Path=5euxiyvw.default\n\nThen you should only have to save the file and start Thunderbird.  Thunderbird will now be looking at the newly pasted file folder for your profile and you should have all the emails and folders that were saved locally when you backed up your .thunderbird directory.  All the setting for the old profile should be the same as well.\n\nA: I know this question is very old. But as I just had the same problem and found a solution, I wanted to share it:\nThunderbird stores the absolute path (not just the profile-relative path) to the directory where it stores the mail folders. If this path changes, you have to update it in the account settings for each account. This changed for me, as there was a symlink in the path to the profile. But Thunderbird stored the actual path, not the symlink path. When I changed the symlink, Thunderbird \"lost\" all my mails, just as you described it.\n", "Q: \"Could not save.

I'm just new to linux.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\nThanks. \n\nA: Sorry for my misbehaviour.\nDigging some further into this issue, I think I have at least the solution for my instance of the problem: for reasons best known to themselves, there were two instances of ktimetracker running (\"ps aux | fgrep ktime\" showed this)! Both try to save the state and, occasionally, they are so in sync that both try to save at the same time and one of them loses because the lock file for the saving process already exists!\nI killed the second instance and now it's quiet.\n", "Q: BURG broken by Windows I have successfully installed, using Super Boot Manager, BURG in a computer at my work.  After I boot into Windows XP, BURG is no longer operational.  The machine just boots to the BIOS screen, goes black, and then boots to the BIOS screen again ad infinitum.  \nThe only way to recover I have found so far is to use a Boot-Repair USB, which restores either GRUB2 or MBR, not BURG.

When I tried installing Ubuntu ISO image to my USB drive, the universal USB installer displays this message:\ncreate syslinux MBR on (H:) - existing MBR will be overwritten\n\nIf I click next, will my Windows OS be broken?\n\nA: No. It will simply make your USB drive bootable. It does not touch your hard disk(beyond downloading an reading the image downloaded). It will not mess up Windows boot. However, if your USB drive is bootable, the boot will then be Ubuntu. When you install fully, however, the bootloader will be replaced with GRUB , which offers a choice between Ubuntu and Windows, as well as many other OSes if they are installed.\n", "Q: keeps asking for the CD how do I force it to stop asking for the CD I have installed 12.04 and am attempting to update the wireless drivers (I have a Dell Insiron 6400), but it keeps asking for an installation CD that I do not have.

While installing the freesteam software downloaded from the http://sourceforge.net/projects/freesteam/ which is the only steam table software for Ubuntu, I am getting following error:\nDependency is not satisfiable: libfreesteam1.\n\nthe description of package : \npython-freesteam , file name :python-freesteam_2.0_i386(1).deb\n\nPlease help me out as it is the only available opensource steam table software to be used by mechanical engineering student. \n\nA: To get freesteam working on a fresh, clean Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit system, you can download the packages from \nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/freesteam/files/freesteam/2.1/\nFirst you should grab the 'libfreesteam1' deb file, then after that grab 'freesteam-gtk' deb file, then finally grab 'python-freesteam' deb file, if you want to be able to use freesteam from within Python language. After each download, the Ubuntu Softare Centre pops up, and you need to click 'install' and type in your password each time.\nYou can easily test this by searching for 'freesteam' from the main Ubuntu menu. A basic GUI will pop up allowing you to evaluate the steam properties you need.\nIf you want to try using freesteam from Python, there are some examples here:\nhttp://freesteam.sourceforge.net/example.php\n\nA: The version of freesteam that's hosted on SF.net was built with linkage to Python 2.6, but Python 2.7 is used on current Ubuntu 12.04. This means that, at least until a new version is released, you need to build your own copy of freesteam locally. Instructions from the freesteam README.txt for Ubuntu 12.04:\nsudo apt-get install subversion scons libgsl0-dev python-dev swig ipython python-matplotlib\nsvn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/freesteam/code/trunk freesteam\ncd freesteam\nscons\nsudo scons install\n\nTo remove, you will need to look for freesteam files in /usr/local/{lib,bin,include} and /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages.\n", "Q: Xerox Phaser 3100MFP not working I have installed the latest version of Ubuntu on my system. My problem is that\nI am not able to find and install the proper drivers for my printer/scanner combination; the Xerox Phaser 3100MFP.\nAlthough it is recognised by the system and my print jobs appear as completed, in fact they are not printed at all.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: The link by Orestis is really great one.\nIn short the reason of your problems can be 64-bit. Xerox drivers for Phaser 3100MFP are 32-bit and that's why you'll have to install some 32-bit libraries.\nFirst of all, download the driver from Xerox official site. It will have a setup file for installing driver in Ubuntu's database. Unpack and install it. It may need to run with sudo like this:\nsudo ./setup \n\nThis action can have a problem cause it is needed to have libjpeg62:i386 installed. so run before it:\nsudo apt-get install libjpeg62:i386\n\nSo now if you'll search for drivers in Printers - it will find appropriate but it won't still work cause there are some 32-bit libraries that are missing. \nAs for as i know, Ubuntu is using CUPS, so to find out which libraries are needed, run this:\nreadelf -d  /usr/lib/cups/filter/rastertoprinterbin\n\nThe output will be something like this:\nTag        Type                         Name/Value\n0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libcupsimage.so.2]\n0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libstdc++.so.6]\n0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libm.so.6]\n0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libgcc_s.so.1]\n0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libc.so.6]\n0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libcups.so.2]\n\nSo the libraries which have type 'needed' are needed to be installed. \nFor example to resolve lipcupsimage.so.2 you need to install 'libcupsimage2:i386'\n (':i386' - means 32 bit system, don't forget to include it). The command will look like this:\nsudo apt-get install libcupsimage:i386\n\nAfter that it should work fine. I had the same problem with my printer Xerox Phaser 3100MFP - it resolved after i installed only 'libcupsimage'.\n\nA: Try using the following guide, skipping over items not relevant for Ubuntu. Since I had it working before and my current Ubuntu setup is the product of two upgrades, there may have been a few less steps required in my case.\nArch Wiki: Xerox Phaser 3100MFP\nBy the way, if you're running 64-bit Ubuntu, you may need to install the package libjpeg62:i386.\n", "Q: Should I backup /usr/local or not? Does it contain the only packages I installed manually from sources or with aptitude?\nIf so I think I can easily reinstall all packages I had installed with aptitude. Those few I built from sources are not much important to me to back them up.\n\nA: \nDoes it contain the only packages I installed manually from sources or with aptitude?\n\nNo, for me it's just stuff that I didn't install from the apt repos. Lots of Python libraries that I've installed with pip. And a few binaries in /usr/local/bin/ (that either symlink out to Python or Doom 3 (which installs there too apparently).\nIn my case it's all stuff I'd reinstall in about five seconds with pip as I needed it... But I's strongly suggest you get an overview of what's there. Here are the two commands I used to look (you can probably use them elsewhere):\nls -l /usr/local/bin\n\nThat shows you what's lurking in the local bin and that should be a good indicator as to what's installed in /usr/local/.

It didn't work for me when I was trying and I can only assume that there is a bug somewhere in xfce4, which is the windows manager I installed on 12.04 instead of Unity. If you also suffer problems, the work-around is to use xset:\nxset -dpms s off s noblank s 0 0 s noexpose\n\nbut that only lasts as long as your session. \nYou can use \nxset -q\n\nto see what the current settings are.

When I load GEdit, it is different from sudo GEdit.\nNormal GEdit gives me Gtk warnings in the console, and ithas a different look.\nWhen I install plugins on either version, it doesn't reflect on the other.\nI tried removing gedit and reinstalling, but I get the exact setups (in other words, GEdit didn't actually go away when I removed it)\nAny advice on how I can actually remove gedit and start over?\n(I have tried sudo apt-get remove --purge gedit - no joy)\n\nA: When you run gedit via sudo, it's actually running under the superuser's account. That's why plugins installed in normal gedit (your account) don't show on sudo gedit (running under another account).\nPlugins are installed in your current user's .local/share/gedit/plugins/ directory. If you want them to be available globally, you can install them manually in /usr/share/gedit/plugins.\nAlso, the fact that they look different can potentially also be caused by different settings. I bet you have tweaked the settings under your account, but the superuser's account remains with the default configuration.\n\nA: This is the same application, only with different settings. Applications store their settings in the user's home directory - when you start gedit from your user account, it uses settings from /home/yourusername/, when you start it as root, it uses settings from /root/.\nThis is a good thing, because if they used the same settings, applications would constantly have problem with permissions accessing files.\nAlso, removing (or even purging) a package only removes files which were installed by the package manager - program's settings in users' home directories are not removed, just as the documents you created with that program are not removed when you uninstall the program. This explains why re-installing gedit does not reset the settings to the initial state.\n", "Q: HDMI and Bumblebee, Washed out Colors and Low Resolution I’m on a Acer TimelineX 3830TG, Nvidia 540m, Ubuntu 12.04 using the bumblebee drivers.\nI just connected my external monitor to my laptop using HDMI and there is output to it, however the contrast is all screwed up and the highest resolution I can set it too is 1680x1050, but on VGA I get 1920x1200. \nWhat is going on and how do I fix it?\nThanks!!\n\nA: Possibly because your non-accelerated GPU is determining resolutions? Bumblebee forces the Optimus nvidia GPU to do the maths while the on board intel HD GPU does the drawing. Meaning while you get faster graphics, it's not being achieved solely by the nvidia GPU and is subject to the restrictions of the intel HD (or whatever you have).  \n", "Q: Requires installation of untrusted packages?

That's by design: someone who somehow obtains the password would also need the key to decrypt your files. In fact, the private key is all you need to decrypt the file; in your keyring, the private key is stored encrypted with your passphrase.\nSince you can decrypt the file on the other computer, copy your keys back from that other computer. And make sure you have ample backups of your key! Print it out and store the paper somewhere safe: it would be really tedious to type the key back in, but paper is durable, so it might save you.\nAll this assumes that the files are encrypted with the private key (with gpg -e). Gpg can also encrypt a file with only a passphrase (with gpg -c). If that's what you did, it's independent from any key, all you need is to type the passphrase.\n\nA: \nis there any way that i can encrypt my file by providing only master\n  password and passphrase and no physical key or private key ... and\n  when i am on another computer i can easily open it my same master\n  password and passphrase.\n\nYes, definitely.\nEvery time you try to encrypt some input, GnuPG actually generates a random session key which it then uses to symmetrically encrypt the input (using whichever cipher-algo is specified -- CAST5 by default). Then the session key is encrypted with any combination of passphrases & gpg public keys and THOSE are what you use to access the data.\nHere's an example of running gpg to encrypt some data and make it accessible via both a simple passphrase and a couple public keys:\ngpg -cer barack@devnull --cipher-algo aes256 -r bob@devnull <FILE>\n\nNote that cipher-algo is of course optional.\n\nEDIT:\nPer request, here's a simplified example which only uses a symmetric key.\ngpg -c --cipher-algo aes256 --force-mdc <FILE>\n\nSee the man page for an explanation of --force-mdc, but note that I added it on purpose; by default it's not used when only doing -c/--symmetric.\n", "Q: How to create a sliding widget (GTK+, Quickly) Recently I've seen this widget in Gedit: \n\nIt appears when you press Ctrl + F. What I am interested is in how to get the sliding effect. Any suggestion will be appreciated.\n\nA: I have achieved a fade-out effect using pure GTK and CSS. \nIt is only working in GTK 3.6 and I am not sure if a slide in / out effect would be possible, however, if you want, you can look at the source at launchpad.net/uberwriter \nIt works through a state-change and then GTK Transitions... Maybe with height // width that would be possible, too.\nEDIT\nBecause people obviously downvote me, here is another, more detailed explanation:\nThis is the CSS I have used:\nGtkLabel:insensitive {\n    color: rgba(255,255,255,0);\n    transition: 500ms ease-in-out;\n}\n\nIf you use this as CSS (I hope I am allowed to reference an explanation from myself, how to that: http://wolfvollprecht.de/blog/gtk-python-and-css-are-an-awesome-combo/) then you can use Gtk.StateFlags to fade out the Label.\ne.g.:\n\nlabel.set_state_flags(Gtk.StateFlags.INSENSITIVE, True)\n\nThen you get a transition to zero opacity.\nHowever, as I have noticed, there are not many options to influence placement / width with CSS, so I guess it's limited to colors / opacity etc.\nEnjoy.\nPS: Note that this only works in Gtk 3.6, since Ubuntu 12.10\n\nA: Such animation is not achievable in pure GTK+. There are no mechanisms that would process it.\nI have given a quick look on gedit's source code, it's clear that they process this animation on their own. I have not looked into details, for the code related to animations is quite expanded, but I have noted that they incorporate Cairo drawing features for the animated search widget. Most likely the widget is animated by moving its position frame by frame and redrawing it on a different place in the overlay that is used on a single text display area. \nThat seems to be the simplest solution. (gedit's code seems to be prepared for many animations sharing the same code base, thus it may be an overkill to use it's exact approach in a simple application.)\nTo reproduce this effect, you will need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a custom widget for the UI piece that you want to slide in/out.\n\n*Make it react on draw event and periodical timeouts (to redraw each frame of animation)\n\n*Create a transparent overlay over the rest of your widgets (or any area that has to appear as if it was below the sliding widget)\n\n*Draw the animated widget manually on such overlay.\n\n\nI can't come up with any easier solution. However, considering the fact that gedit developers do know GTK+ as probably very little do, there may be no simpler trick to achieve such effect.\n\nA: You can use a combination between Gtk.fixed(),GObject.timeout_add and the function move, here is an example in python :\n\n#!/usr/bin/python*\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk, GObject\n\nclass TestWindow(Gtk.Window):\n     def animateImage(self):\n        GObject.timeout_add(150,self.slideImage)\n\n     def slideImage(self):\n        self.positionX += 50;\n        if(self.positionX > 800):\n          self.fixedWidget.move(self.logo,self.positionX,200)\n          return True        \n        else:\n          return False \n\n     def __init__(self):\n        Gtk.Window.__init__(self, title='Registration')\n\n        self.positionX = 500\n        self.fixedWidget = Gtk.Fixed()\n        self.fixedWidget.set_size_request(1920,1080)\n        self.fixedWidget.show()\n\n        self.logo = Gtk.Image.new_from_file('picture.png')\n        self.logo.show()\n        self.fixedWidget.put(self.logo,self.positionX,200)\n\n        self.button1 = Gtk.Button('Click me to slide image!')\n        self.button1.show()\n        self.button1.connect('clicked', self.animateImage)\n        self.button1.set_size_request(75,30)\n        self.fixedWidget.put(self.button1,750,750)\n        self.add(self.fixedWidget)\n\ntestWindow = TestWindow()\ntestWindow.set_size_request(1920,1080)\ntestWindow.set_name('testWindow')\ntestWindow.show()\n\nGtk.main()\n\n\nA: Nowadays, there is a real answer to this question. Since it was originally asked and answered, the code for revealing a widget from libgd - which I presume is what GEdit was using at that time - has been upstreamed into GTK+ as GtkRevealer:\nhttps://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkRevealer.html\nGtkRevealer supports various forms of transition, including the cardinal directions of slide and a fade on the opacity.\nSo, these days, it's as simple as adding the widget that you want to transition to a GtkRevealer and using its :transition-(type|duration) and :reveal-child properties.\n", "Q: Where to install grub?

Translation\nIs it possible to create a partition when using the system? When I try to do it on GParted, it seems that the options are disabled because of the disk is mounted and it cannot be unmounted because of I am using it in the system. \nI wish to create a new partition without removing or affecting the file system; just creating a new partition, but without the need to use a Live CD or USB.\n\n¿Cómo crear una partición sin usar live CD ni USB?\n¿Es posible crear una partición estando en el sistema?

Quiero crear una nueva partición pero sin quitar o afectar el sistema de archivos; sólo crear una nueva partición, pero sin live CD o USB.\n\nA: The fast answer is NO, you can't.\nThis has been discussed in the past, in questions like: Why I'm seeing a lock besides the partition I'm trying to modify with gparted? of which the answers provides enough information. I strongly suggest you to read it, and if you are experiencing any issues with booting a live CD/USB perform a search on this site. If the answers to previous questions doesn't fit your needs, open a new question explaining what are your live session's issues in order to obtain the proper support.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Actually, you can create a new partition on a drive even if some existing partitions on that drive are mounted or in use by the system. If you check the image @GeppettvsD'Constanzo linked to, you'll see that only the partitions which are currently in use (i.e. mounted) are \"locked\" in gparted, so nothing prevents you from removing/resizing, say /dev/sda1 on that picture and creating a new partition. \nBut, as I said, you only need to modify existing partitions if you don't have enough unpartitioned space on the drive and need to resize existing partitions, all of which happen to be in use.\nIf you do need to resize the boot partition, it is in fact possible to do that using the low-level tools which GParted itself uses, see this answer (and another one) for instructions. \nAnother possible cause of the option to create a new partition being disabled in GParted is if you have 4 primary partitions on the drive, which is the maximum number MBR supports.\n", "Q: Is Adobe Flash 11.2 working with Nvidia hardware again?

I notice that when I play Minecraft, my CPU usage is only around 15 to 20 percent, at most. Is it possible to force my computer to allocate as much RAM, CPU time, etc. to the game, in order to get the best experience possible? Or, is the low CPU usage due to limitations in the JVM or the game code itself?\nI have OptiFine installed, and I've already tried using renice to change the process priority and -Xmx to allocate more memory to Java. What else can I do?\n\nA: There's nothing in Linux which would force a program to use less than 100% CPU or not to allocate as much RAM as it needs, provided that no other process needs the same resources at the same time. nice value just determines how \"nice\" (got it?) the process plays with others and how much is it willing to share CPU time with other processes.\nIt's like if you're the only child in the playground you have all the toys to yourself, but if there are more then one, then nicer children give up more toys than those who are less nice...\nPoint is: it is likely the game is limited by your video card, not by CPU - that's why it's not using 100% of CPU, there's just no point.

Any suggestions on how to do this?\nThanks for any help anyone can provide.\n\nA: Use this shell script for conversion of mdir to mbox format\n#! /bin/sh\n#\n# Get a directory name as input and convert all mail files inside\n# to mbox format\n#\n# NOTE: processing of subdirectories not yet implemented correctly:\n#       all mails in subfolders are put into the same mbox\n#       (it would be better if an mbox file will be generated for\n#       each subfolder)\n#\n# History:\n# Feb 06 2001 Joerg Reinhardt\n# - first edition\n# Feb 07 2001 Joerg Reinhardt\n# - added usage output\n# Feb 12 2001 Joerg Reinhardt\n# - mails not containing a 'From:' field but an 'X-From-Line:' or a\n#   'Reply-To:' field are now recognised and also processed (e.g. put into\n#   the mbox file); this works fine for all my mails\n# - added progress information\n# - warning about corrupt files is now written to stderr\n# Sep 8 2012 Kim Johansson\n# - Time conversion to local timezone added\n# - changed grep \"Date:\" to grep \"Date: \"\n\n# check for argument or help argument respectively\nif [[ ($1 == \"\") ||\n($1 == \"-h\") ||\n($1 == \"--help\") ||\n($1 == \"-help\") ]]; then\necho \"Usage: \"$0\" <Xfmail-mail-directory>\";\nfi;\n\n# check if parameter is a directory\nif [[ -d $1 ]]; then\n# set target filename\ndirname=`echo $1 | awk '{while(substr($0,length($0),1)==\"/\"){$0=substr($0,1,length($0)-1);}print $0;}'`;\nmboxfile=$dirname'.mbox';\n\n# check if directory is empty\nif [[ `find $dirname -type f` == \"\" ]]; then\n        echo $dirname\": directory empty.\"\n        exit 1;\nfi;\n\n# prevent automatic overwriting of target\nif [[ -e $mboxfile ]]; then \\\n        dialogtext=\"Write file \"$mboxfile\"?\";\n        if dialog --yesno \"$dialogtext\" 10 60; then\n        clear;\n        rm -vf $mboxfile;\n        else\n        clear; exit 1;\n        fi;\nfi;\n\necho \"writing xfmail mail directory '$1' to '$mboxfile'.\";\n\n# so we can handle filnames with space\nIFS=$(echo -en \"\\n\\b\")\n# collect files inside Xfmail mail-directory and produce MBOX format\n# target file\n#    for i in `find $1/* -type f -ls | cut -b 69-`; do\nfor i in `find $1/* -type f`; do\n# output progress information\n        echo -n -e \\\\r\"                                                                               \"\n        echo -n -e \\\\rprocessing $i\n# look for senders email address in the order\n# 'From:'\n# 'X-From-Line:'\n# 'Reply-To:'\n        shortfromflag='true';\n        fromline=`grep 'From:' $i`;\n# parse 'From:' field\n        from=`echo $fromline | awk 'BEGIN{FS=\"<\";}{if($0~/</) {pos=index($2,\">\");if(pos!=0) {print substr($2,1,pos-1);}} else {pos=index($0,\":\");print substr($0,pos+1);}}'`;\n        if [[ $from == \"\" ]]; then\n        shortfromflag='false';\n        fromline=`grep 'X-From-Line:' $i`;\n        from=`echo $fromline | awk 'BEGIN{FS=\"Line:\";}{print $2;}'`;\n        if [[ $from == \"\" ]]; then\n                shortfromflag='true';\n                fromline=`grep 'Reply-To:' $i`;\n# parse 'Reply-To:' field\n                from=`echo $fromline | awk 'BEGIN{FS=\"<\";}{if($0~/</) {pos=index($2,\">\");if(pos!=0) {print substr($2,1,pos-1);}} else {pos=index($0,\":\");print substr($0,pos+1);}}'`;\n                if [[ $from == \"\" ]]; then\n                echo;\n                echo \"WARNING: \"$i\": no 'From:' nor 'X-From-Line:' nor 'Reply-To:' field found.\" >&2;\n                continue;\n                fi;\n        fi;\n        fi;\n        if [[ $shortfromflag == \"true\" ]]; then\n# parse date field\n        dateline=`grep 'Date: ' $i`;\n        if [[ $dateline == \"\" ]]; then\n# set dummy date if no date field found\n                dateline=\"Date: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 +0000 (GMT)\";\n        fi;\n        datel=`echo $dateline | cut -b7- -`\n# Convert to local time\n        dateli=`date --date=\"$datel\"`\n\n# output MBOX mail header\n        echo \"From \" $from $dateli >> $mboxfile;\n        else\n# output long MBOX mail header found in 'X-From-Line:' field\n        echo $from >> $mboxfile;\n        fi;\n\n# output mail itself\n        cat $i >> $mboxfile;\ndone;\necho;\nelse\necho $1\": not a directory.\";\nfi;\n\n\nA: If your mail is in mbox format it's easy\ncd ~/.kde/share/apps/kmail/mail/\ncat file1 file2 file3 ...  >>/var/spool/mail/$USER \n\nfile1 file2 file3 ... , is your mail folders in mbox format (don't copy any .index .index.ids .index.sorted files)\nNow you can get the mail from any mail client by choosing local delivery\nI use thunderbird:\nServer type: Unix Movemail\nServer: localhost\nThis was done in Slackware, who uses sendmail as MDA, so your spool dir may be different.\n", "Q: Gnome Start search window When I start my computer using Gnome (well, Gnome + Xmonad), this search window appears that prompts me to search my computer.

So I went to my BIOS set up, and under boot options, the boot order was set to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sata PM: TSSTCorp CDD VDW SH 2   (1st priority)\n\n*SATA SM: WDC WD5000AAKX003CA     (2nd priority)\nThose are also the only two options available for the boot order. Can anyone help me understand what these boot order options represent? Are things already the way they're supposed to be, prior to my Ubuntu installation attempt?\n\n\n*\n\n*Advice Regarding the 'Allocate Drive Space' dialog box of the Installer- which option to select?\n\n\nHi, I'm running a Windows 7 system at the moment with one physical hard drive, partitioned into 3 during the Windows installation: C (97 GB, this is where Windows is installed), D (255 GB, I'd like to keep this as a shared partition between Windows and Ubuntu where I keep my media) and E (107 GB, this is where I would like to install Ubuntu).\nConsidering this will be my first time trying to install an OS, so I have zero experience, which option from the Allocate Drive Space screen of the Ubuntu installer should I use:\n. Install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS alongside (other operating systems); or,\n. Something else (advanced)\nThe first option sounds the most automated (so I have a smaller chance of accidentally changing something I shouldn't), while the second option is clearly labelled advanced.\nMy question is: will the first option allow me to properly select the E drive for installing Ubuntu, or will it try to automatically install it in C?\nAnother concern: as per this webpage (http://news.softpedia.com/news/Installing-Ubuntu-12-04-LTS-266201.shtml), choosing option 1 will result in \"Remember that, after the installation, the Windows boot loader will be overwritten by the Ubuntu boot loader!\"\nThis sounds rather ominous- is it liable to cause problems for running Windows?\nBasically, which option would be best suited for my target installation situation?\nThank you.\n\nA: The boot options in your BIOS specifies the order in which your computer checks for the first program to be run (be it a bootloader, operating system, or installer). The way your BIOS is set up looks fine already. Typically, you start your computer up with nothing in the CD drive. In that case, your BIOS will find nothing in the CDROM and then proceed to check the hard drive, where it finds windows 7 and boots. \nAs for the partitioning options, the option to install alongside other OSes looks the least-likely to do harm. However, I do not think the installer will be intelligent enough to use the \"E\" partition automatically. \nIt should be fine to go to the advanced options and manually specify to install on the E partition. I would recommend reading a tutorial or guide on how the advanced section in the installer here works though. What you DON'T want to do is format your Windows or Media partitions. \nAlso, having the Grub bootloader (which is what the Ubuntu installer will install) will typically not mess up booting into your Windows 7 partition. It's pretty good about these things, and will automatically detect that partition and allow you to select it when you turn on the computer. Still, if anything does happen where you cannot boot into Windows 7, you can boot from the Windows 7 DVD installer and click \"repair my computer\" which will reinstall the Windows 7 bootloader (at which point you'd have to use something like EasyBCD to tell the Windows 7 bootloader about your Ubuntu install, as it's not as intelligent). \n", "Q: Why most people recommend to reduce swappiness to 10-20? I have seen in several site which recommend to reduce swappiness to 10-20 for better performance.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/998\n\n*https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/bugs\n\n*http://www.howtogeek.com/115797/6-ways-to-speed-up-ubuntu/\n\n*http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/06/11-tips-to-speed-up-computers-running.html\nIs it a myth or not? Is this a general rule?\nI have a laptop with 4GB Ram and 128GB SSD hard, what value do you recommend for my swappiness?\nThanks.\n\nA: I would suggest doing some experiments whilst having system monitor open to see exactly how much load your machine is under, I am also running with 4GB of memory and a 128GB SSD so changed the swappiness value to 10 which not only improved performance whilst under load but as a bonus will also increase the life of the SSD drive as it will suffer less writes.\nFor a simple video tutorial on how to do this with a full explanation \nsee the YouTube video below \nhttp://youtu.be/i6WihsFKJ7Q\n\nA: I want to add some perspective from a Big Data Performance engineer to give others more background on 2017 technology.\nMy personal experience is that while I have typically disabled swapping to guarantee that my systems are running at max speed, on my workstation for a specific problem, I have found that swappiness of 1 and 10 leads to freezing (forever) and long pauses. Swappiness of 80 for this particular application leads to much better performance and shorter pauses than the default (60). Note that I had 8GB RAM and 4x 256GB of swap backed by 1 HDD. I would normally state precise statistics seen in my benchmarks and the full hardware specs, but I haven't done any yet and it's a recent low-end desktop that is not important here. \nBack at my former company, the reason we did not enable swappiness on Spark servers with [500GB to 4TB] x [10-100] nodes is that we saw poor performance as a sign to redesign the data pipeline and data structures in a more efficient manner. We also did not want to benchmark the HDDs/SSDs. Also, swapping that much RAM would need 10-30 disks per node with parallel writes to minimize disk access time. \nToday, 20 years ago and 20 years in the future, the case will still remain that some problems are too large for the RAM. With infinite time and money, we can buy/lease more hardware or redesign any process to get the performance to a desirable level. Swapping is just a hack to allow us to ignore the real problem (we don't have enough ram and we don't want to spend more money). \nFor those that think higher swappiness is a bad advice, here is a little perspective. In the past, HDs had just a few kb of cache if any. The interface was IDE/Parallel ATA. The CPU bus was also much slower along with RAM and many other things. In short, systems were very slow (relative to today) in every way. A couple years ago, HDDs used SATA3. Today, they use the NVMe protocol, which has significant latency improvements. HDs have many MB of cache. And the most interesting part is when you use a modern SSD (much more stable read/write endurance and perf) with NVMe or PCIe as your swap storage. It's the best compromise between cost and performance. Please do not try this with cheap or old SSDs.\nSwap+SSDs! With high-performance volatile storage, I would highly recommend experimenting with a high swappiness value. It mainly depends on the memory access patterns (randomly accessing all memory vs rarely accessing most), memory usage, if the disk bandwidth is already saturated, and the actual cost of thrashing.\n\nA: A personal anecdote. I didn't know about this swappiness and in hindsight it might have fixed my problem. My system is old and RAM was 4GB.\nI upgraded my Linux OS to the next latest long term support version. That version was \"passively\" using more RAM. This made my system use more swap. The system started boggling down because the swap is on HDD.\nLooking at the stats the RAM and the swap combined was not greater than my max RAM. The problem was partially as 'Linux dude' mentioned that browsers often reserve large chunks of memory, that they constantly modify. So I was using Firefox (YouTube particularly is heavy) and due to that large chunks were going into swap but were actually needed.\nI ended up getting more RAM which did solve my problem but it might have been possible to postpone the RAM buying if I tried putting swappiness at lower value. I don't regret buying the RAM it was a good upgrade but not every one can make an upgrade.\n\nA: On a usual desktop, you have 4-5 active tasks that consume 50-60% of memory. If you set swappiness to 60, then about 1/4-1/3 of the ACTIVE task pages will be swapped out. That means, for every task change, for every new tab you opened, for every JS execution, there will be a swapping process.\nThe solution is to set swappiness to 10. By practical observations, this causes the system to give up disk io cache (that plays little to no role on desktop, as read/write cache is virtually not used at all. Unless you constantly copying LARGE files) instead of pushing anything into swap.\nIn practice, that means system will refuse to swap pages, cutting io cache instead, unless it hits 90% used memory. And that in turn means a smooth, swapless, fast desktop experience.\nOn the file server, however, I would set swappiness to 60 or even more, because server does not have huge active foreground tasks that must be kept in the memory as whole, but rather a lot of smaller processes that are either working or sleeping, and not really changing their state immediately. Instead, server often serves (pardon) the exact same data to clients, making disk io caches much more valueable. So on the server, it is much better to swap out the sleeping processes, freeing memory space for disk cache requests.\nOn desktops, however, this exact setting leads to swapping out blocks of memory of REAL applications, that near constantly modify or access this data. \nOddly enough, browsers often reserve large chunks of memory, that they constantly modify. When such chunks are swapped out, it takes a while if they are requested back - and at the same time, browser goes forth updating its caches. Which causes huge latencies. In practice, you will be sitting 2 minutes waiting for the single web page in a new tab to load.\nDesktop does not really care about disk io, because desktop rarely reads and writes cacheable repeating big portions of data. Cutting on disk io in order to just prevent swaping so much as possible is much more favorible for desktop, than to have 30% of memory reserved for disk cache with 30% of RAM (full of blocks belonging to actively used applications) swapped out.\nJust launch htop, open a browser, GIMP, LibreOffice - load few documents there and then browse for several hours. Its really that easy.\n\nA: Because most believe that swapping = bad and that if you don't reduce swappiness, the system will swap when it really doesn't need to.  Neither of those are really true.  People associate swapping with times where their system is getting bogged down - however, it's mostly swapping because the system is getting bogged down, not the other way around.  When the system swaps, it will have already factored the performance cost in to its decision to swap, and decided that not doing so would have a greater overall penalty in system performance or stability.\nOverall the default settings result in good overall performance and stability.  I'd recommend leaving it at the default.  There are further avenues for Linux to improve its memory management to solve some edge cases, but by and large the swappiness control isn't a good workaround - adjust it in one direction and you may fix one issue and create other issues.  If at all possible, simply installing more physical RAM (and leaving swappiness alone) eclipses all other remedies.\nHow Linux uses RAM\nAny RAM that isn't being used by applications may be used as \"cache\".  Cache is important for a fast, smooth running system, speeding up both reads and writes to disk.\nIf your applications increase their memory use to the point they are using almost all your RAM, your cache will shrink and on average disk operations will slow down as a result.  It's not enough to have just tens of megabytes, or less, for cache nowadays.\nIf applications increase their memory use even further - assuming you have no swap space - you will not only have no space for cache but you will eventually run out of memory and your system will have to kill running processes.  Killing processes is worse than a slow down as it gives you an unstable, unpredictable system.\nHow Linux uses swap\nTo combat both of these problems, your system can re-allocate some seldom-used application memory to the swap space on your disk, freeing RAM.  The additional RAM can prevent processes dying due to running out of memory, and can reclaim a little cache so disk operations can operate more smoothly.\nThis re-allocation isn't done according to a definite cutoff though.  You don't reach a certain percentage of allocation after which Linux starts swapping.  It has a \"fuzzy\" algorithm.  It takes a lot of things into account, which can best be described by \"how much pressure is there for memory allocation\".  If there is a lot of \"pressure\" to allocate new memory, then it will increase the chances some will be swapped to make more room.  If there is less \"pressure\" then it will decrease these chances.\nYour system has a \"swappiness\" setting which helps you tweak how this \"pressure\" is calculated.  It's often falsely represented as a \"percentage of RAM\" but it's not, it's just a value that is used as part of the formula.  Values around 40 to 60 are the recommended sane values, 60 being default nowadays.\nLetting your system swap when it has to is overall a very good thing, even if you have a lot of RAM.  Letting your system swap if it needs to gives you peace of mind that if you ever run into a low memory situation even temporarily (while running a short process that uses a lot of memory), your system has a second chance at keeping everything running.  If you go so far as to disable swapping completely, then you risk processes being killed due to not being able to allocate memory.\nWhat is happening when the system is bogged down and swapping heavily?\nSwapping is a slow and costly operation, so the system avoids it unless it calculates that the trade-off in cache performance will make up for it overall, or if it's necessary to avoid killing processes.\nA lot of the time people will look at their system that is thrashing the disk heavily and using a lot of swap space and blame swapping for it.  That's the wrong approach to take.  If swapping ever reaches this extreme, it means that swapping is your system's attempt to deal with low memory problems, not the cause of the problem, and that without swapping your running process will just randomly die.\nWhat about desktop systems? Don't they require a different approach?\nUsers of a desktop system do indeed expect the system to \"feel responsive\" in response to user-initiated actions such as opening an application, which is the type of action that can sometimes trigger a swap due to the increase in memory required.\nOne way some people try to tweak this is to reduce the swappiness parameter which can increase the system's tolerance to applications using up memory and running low on cache space.\nHowever, this is just shifting goalposts.  The first application may now load without a swap operation, but it will leave less slack for the next application that loads.  The same swapping may just occur later, when you next open an application instead.  In the meantime, the system performance is lower overall due to the reduced cache size.  Thus, any benefit from the reduced swappiness setting may be hard to measure, reducing swapping delay at some times but causing other slow performance at other times.  Reducing swappiness a little may be justified if you know what you're doing, but reducing it to as low as 10 can leave the system tolerant to very low cache sizes and leave the system more liable to have to swap at short notice.\nDisabling swap completely should be avoided as you lose the added protection against out-of-memory conditions which can cause processes to crash or be killed.\nThe most effective remedy by far is to install more RAM if you can afford it.\nCan swap be disabled on a system that has lots of RAM anyway?\nIf you have far more RAM than you're likely to need for applications, then you'll rarely need swap.  Therefore, disabling swap probably won't make a difference in all usual circumstances.  But if you have plenty of RAM, leaving swap enabled also won't have any penalty because the system doesn't swap when it doesn't need to.\nThe only situations in which it would make a difference would be in the unlikely situation the system finds itself running out of memory and consequently the cache system is getting hampered, and it's in this type of situation where you would want swap most.  So you can safely leave swap on its normal settings for added peace of mind without it ever having a negative effect when you have plenty of memory.\nBut how can swap speed up my system?  Doesn't swapping slow things down?\nThe act of transferring data from RAM to swap is a slow operation, but it's only taken when the kernel is pretty sure the overall benefit as a result of keeping a reasonable cache size will outweigh this.  If your system is getting really slow as a result of disk thrashing, swap is not causing it but only trying to alleviate it. \nOnce data is in swap, when does it come out again?\nAny given part of memory will come back out of swap as soon as it's used - read from or written to. However, typically the memory that is swapped is memory that has not been accessed in a long time and is not expected to be needed soon.\nTransferring data out of swap is about as time-consuming as putting it in there.  Your kernel won't remove data from it if it doesn't need to.  While data is in swap and not being used, it leaves more memory for other things that are being used, and more system cache.\nAre there any cases where reducing swappiness is appropriate?\nYes.  If you are running a server dedicated to one particular server application that does not benefit from system cache.  Some database servers such as Oracle server, MySQL/MariaDB recommend in some cases reducing swappiness to 1 to 10 as these database engines use their own caching.\nNote that this is true only if your system is dedicated to that one task, and in the case of MySQL/MariaDB only if you are using purely InnoDB or XtraDB, and not MyISAM or Aria, etc.  If the dedicated purpose of your system is centered around an application that does its own caching and does not benefit from system cache, lowering swappiness can be a good idea.\n\nA: If you run a Java server on your Linux system you should really consider reducing swappiness by much from the default value of 60. So 20 is indeed a good start. Swapping is a killer for a garbage collecting process because collections each time need to touch large parts of the process memory. The OS does not have the means to detect such processes and get things right for them. It is best practice to avoid swapping as much as you possibly can for productive application servers.\n\nA: It could be that a lot of the perceived swapping behaviour on startup or on opening programs is linux reading configuration files etc. from disk. So it maybe best to look using the system monitor program before assuming that the hard drive access is due to swapping.\n", "Q: Left mouse button not working in Xubuntu session I recent changed from Ubuntu to Xubuntu 12.04. The install worked great for a few days, but suddenly the left mouse button stopped working. The right click and scroll bars work fine.\nAfter a bit of experimenting I discovered that the problem only happens when I set the session to Xubuntu at login. The mouse also works fine in my dual-booted Windows vista.\nWhat could make my mouse stop working like that?\n\nA: Check if you have xserver-xorg-input-evdev installed on your system:\nsudo dpkg -s xserver-xorg-input-evdev\n\nIf yes, do:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf no, do:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-evdev\n\nReboot.\n\nA: Your left mouse button might be remapped or disabled.  Try adjusting the configuration or resetting to defaults in the Xfce control panel, as described here:\nhttp://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-settings/mouse\nYou can check the current mappings using the xinput command from the Terminal.\n$ xinput list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Mouseemu virtual mouse                    id=14   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ bcm5974                                   id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nLook for your mouse in the list and note its id, presented as id=x; e.g., 11\nThe use xinput again to get the current button map:\n$ xinput get-button-map 11\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \n\nIf the first number is \"0\", your mouse button 1 is disabled. Test re-enabling it with:\n$ xinput set-button-map 11 1\n\nRemember to replace \"11\" with the mouse's id from xinput list.\nIf this gets reset every time you login to your desktop, see if there's a file in your home directory called \".xinputrc\" or a directory called .xinput.d/ containing files. Also see if there's an errant \".xinitrc\" that might have xinput commands.\n\nA: Try this command in terminal: sudo modprobe -r psmouse this command removes the mouse driver from the kernel, this should solve the problem, but if the mouse still doesn't work try this after the first command: sudo modprobe psmouse proto=imps and this should reinstates it. It is like of turning it off then on\n\nA: Freantique's solution does not work for my Samsung N210 with Xubuntu 12.04. I find a solution that it works and I posted a step by step tutorial here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12489693#post12489693\n", "Q: Can someone explain me the find command behavior that I use? Can any one tell me why the following command won't run : \nfind ./assign/*.c -exec cp ./assign2 {} \\;\n\nand what's the difference when i do the following(which actually runs):\nfind ./assign -type f -name *.c  -exec cp {} ./assign2 \\;\n\n\nA: find ./assign/*.c -exec cp ./assign2 {} \\;\n\nThe wildcard (*) is expanded by the shell before even find is executed. Say there are two files, source1.c and source2.c in the assign directory, then the above is equivalent to\nfind ./assign/source1.c ./assign/source2.c -exec cp ./assign2 {} \\;\n\nThis is by all means valid, and means that you only want to do something with these particular files. For example, you could write\nfind ./assign/*.c -name '*2*'\n\nand the result would be roughly equivalent to ls ./assign/*.c | grep 2 or ls ./assign/*2*.c.\nNote that if you don't want the shell to expand the wildcards, you need to put them in quotes:\nfind \"./assign/*.c\"\n\nHowever, that will fail, as find treats the path name literally (without any wildcard expansion), so it looks literally for a file called *.c (yes, that is a valid filename).\nAs for the second part of your first expression (exec cp ./assign2 {} \\;). Obviously, there is a typo, since the cp command tries to copy the assign2 directory to the second argument. Given that you have files source1.c and source2.c in the assign directory, the result of your command will be equivalent to \ncp assign2/ ./assign/source1.c\ncp assign2/ ./assign/source2.c\n\nWhich is probably not what you intended (also, it will fail, because you cannot copy a directory to a filename).\nNow, for the second expression, because there is a problem here as well:\nfind ./assign -type f -name *.c  -exec cp {} ./assign2 \\;\n\nThis will work only if there are no files with the .c extension in the current directory. Otherwise, shell will expand the *.c. Say, you have the following files:\n./master.c\n./assign/source1.c\n./assign/source2.c\n\nThe above command line will be first expanded by shell to\nfind ./assign -type f -name master.c -exec cp {} ./assign2 \\;\n\nThat will fail, because there is no file master.c in the assign/ directory. Instead, use\nfind ./assign -type f -name \"*.c\" -exec cp {} ./assign2 \\;\n\nIn any case, unless you have a complex directory structure under ./assign or directories that end in .c, I'd rather just\ncp ./assign/*.c ./assign2\n\n\nA: For \"find\" you need to specify, in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*where to search (./assign)\n\n*type of document (-type f aka file), but this is optional\n\n*name of document (-name *.c aka every file with extension = .c), and this is not optional\n\n\nThen, you are telling \"find\" that, after the search, it has to run a specific command (-exec) and syntax for \"cp\" is correct on both commands you are issuing, but since the syntax for \"find\" in the first one is incorrect, the first one won't run.\nBTW, I don't think either that, after finding all .c files, does make any sense to copy the directory ./assign2 to the actual finding ({}), but rather the other way around. That is, IMHO, that even if the syntax is correct, the \"cp\" command in the first line doesn't do anything.\n", "Q: Openconnect problems on Ubuntu 12.04 Getting problems on the Ubuntu 11.04 for openconnect... the failure after connecting says:\nGot CONNECT response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCSTP connected.

I can only set separately: switching layouts on caps lock or swap escape and caps lock keys, but has no success in trying to do it simultaneously. The final variant I want is to get caps lock behavior like escape key and use escape key for layout switching.\nI have tried something like this:\nsetxkbmap -option grp:switch,grp:caps_toggle,grp_led:caps,caps:swapescape us,ru\n\n\nA: You should be able to swap around the keys with xmodmap if you can't quite do it with setxkbmap. You need the remove Lock modifier for caps lock, as it is a 'special' key. \nremove Lock = Caps_Lock\nkeycode 66 = Escape NoSymbol\nkeycode 9 = Caps_Lock ISO_Next_Group\n\nYou could place the above in your ~/.Xmodmap, which is still read at startup if the correct command is in your ~/.xinitrc, as I explain further in this answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I set Xmodmap on login?\nHowever, you cannot easily mix the xmodmap and setxkbmap commands, as the latter cancels out changes made with the former, as we discussed in the comments.\nTo execute these xmodmap commands in the terminal to test them, you would run, for example, \nxmodmap -e \"remove Lock = Caps_Lock\"\nbut you would only place remove Lock = Caps_Lock in your ~/.Xmodmap file, as I explain further in my above linked answer.\n\nA: Use xmodmap to switch the keys.\nYou can write a file ... i.e. name it .switch_keys\n\nkeycode 9 = Caps_Lock\nkeycode 66 = Escape\n\nThis redefines the keycodes on my keyboard. Check with xev if your keyboard uses the same keycodes.\nSave the file and install the modmap by running xmodmap .switch_keys. Do this after you configured the layout switching with setxkbmap.\nAfter that your Escape key works as Caps Lock and vice versa.\n", "Q: How to run asp.net in ubuntu using apache My office server run on Windows 2008 server and I want to shift to ubuntu Server but the problem is that all my application are based on asp using dot net framework 4.0, so how do I configure to run in ubuntu.

They are protected with your login password and stored safely via encryption. It's like putting all your keys in a safe that just has one key. Every time you use an application (like e.g. Ubuntu One) for which you have stored a password for in the key ring, the key ring enters it for you. Beside the comfort factor that helps to counteract key-loggers and the like, as they need physical access to your key-ring data and your account password.\nNormally, if you don't have auto-login activated, the keyring is unlocked, when you login to L/Uubuntu using your account's regular password.

I use a convertible thinkpad (x201t) and magick-rotation to rotate the screen by 90 degrees in tablet mode. Therefore after rotation the screen's width is only 800 points (the ordinary resolution is 1200x800). \nThe Dash does not adapt to this new state and therefore if I click on it, it is oversized and I cannot reach the applications/files/buttons on its side.\nIs there a way to tell the Dash that it should only ever use a width of 800 pixels, or any other solution to automatically adapt its size when rotating?\n\nA: Here's a solution I think might help. There is a program called \"MyUnity\" and it is designed to let you customize Unity more than you would be able to with the default settings manager. There is a setting in that program to change the dash size. From what I have read online, there is a setting that maximizes the dash to whatever screen size you have. There is also a setting that does not ever maximize the dash.\nYou can install it with the following terminal command: \nsudo apt-get install myunity\n\nOnce MyUnity is installed, open it and click the \"dash\" tab at the top of the window. The last option is for dash size. \"Automatic\" is obviously the default setting, and I think that is what is causing the current undesirable behavior for you. \"Netbook\" is the one that maximizes the dash to whatever screen size you are using, and \"Desktop\" is the setting that makes the dash a fixed size that is smaller than your screen size. \nPlease let me know if it solved your problem.\n\nA: nicktrip suggested MyUnity which will probably work; an alternative is Ubuntu Tweak.\nThe dash size menu can be found under Tweaks > Desktop > Unity. No differences it seems, it also has three options: automatic, desktop and netbook.\n\n", "Q: How to export Thunderbird Mail Filters Im using Mozilla Thunderbird on Ubuntu and it has alot of Message Filters and I want to export them so that I can use them on my home pc . I have gone through each and every menu but found no mention of EXPORT settings.\ni will really appreciate how to do this.\nIf successful I will use Message filters on Mozilla Thunderbird installed on both Ubuntu and Windows 7.\nThanks\n\nA: You can use the Thunderbird Message Filter Import/Export Enhanced addon to export and import your thunderbird message filters.\n\n\nA: If you copy messageFilterRules.dat from one profile to another, first you must make sure that you are copying the filter from the correct account to the correct account (and from the correct profile folder if you have more than one). Each email account has its own messageFilterRules.dat file--including Local Folders, even if you don't have any filters for that account.\nAdditionally, make sure that any changes made are reflected in both installations, such as a moved or renamed folder. Even after assuring these steps, you may still get a message saying, \"Folder folder name could not be found, filter is disabled,\" or \"Applying of filter filter name has failed. Would you like to continue applying filters?\" depending upon how you ran the filter.

It's aboot time I asked this one. Firefox thinks I'm Canadian.\nI've got absolutely nothing against Canadians and their spelling is a lot better than Americans' but I don't spell specialised with a z. There are other, similar issues where I'm writing something and suddenly the dunce-squiggle pops up.\nAnyway... How on earth does one set the default language? Can I remove English (Canada) completely?\n\nSome clarifications as to why some of these answers aren't right for me, but might be right for somebody else:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select another dictionary in Firefox by right clicking a textarea — This didn't hold between sessions. I would quit Firefox sipping my cup of tea, start it back up and be halfway through O Canada.\n\n*Remove the Canadian dictionary from Firefox — Simple: I didn't have it installed. The only dictionary language pack I had installed in Firefox is GB.\nIn my case I had somehow installed system-wide dictionary packages for en_CA and en_ZA. I've still no idea why or even how these kept replacing the Firefox default because I also have a system-wide en_GB dictionary package. Very odd. Package.\n\nA: Firefox seems to use myspell/hunspell and listing /usr/share/myspell/dicts/ shows me the dictionaries that I'm given options to use:\n$ ls -1 /usr/share/myspell/dicts/*.dic\n/usr/share/myspell/dicts/en_CA.dic \n/usr/share/myspell/dicts/en_GB.dic\n/usr/share/myspell/dicts/en_ZA.dic\n...\n\nSearch for the dictionary filename in installed packages:\n$ dpkg -S /usr/share/myspell/dicts/en_CA.dic\nhunspell-en-ca: /usr/share/myspell/dicts/en_CA.dic\n\nSo with the Canadian language package name, the fix is to remove it:\nsudo apt-get remove hunspell-en-ca\n\n\nA: A simple answer is saying that a language pack is an Add-on.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Tools -> Add-ons.\nIf you are using Ubuntu 12.04 or newer, you can use Dash to search in your menu; Tap Alt, and start typing Add-ons.\n\n*After you open the Add-ons manager, click on the Languages tab in left menu. There, you can disable any language. \n\n*After adding a language, just right click on any text area, or input field (By default input fields have spell checking disabled, so you will need to enable it before  proceeding to the next step.).\n\n*Choose Language from the context menu, and select the language you want, and this will become your default language until you change it again.\nP.S. Clicking on \"Add language\" in the context menu, will take you to a page which contains a listing of language dictionary packs that links to their corresponding add-ons.\n\nA: Insperatus's comment deserves to be a full answer.  I've had this problem not only with Canadian spelling, but sometimes Firefox would use UK or Australian spelling.    On Ubuntu Linux, removing the dictionaries from the system for non-US English fixes this problem.\nsudo apt-get remove myspell-en-au myspell-en-gb myspell-en-za hunspell-en-ca && sudo apt-get install myspell-en-us\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\n\nA: Right click on a text area, make sure that Check Spelling in checked, and choose the right dictionary. \n\nThen go to the add-on page click on extensions, and either disable or remove the one that you don't want.\n\n\nA: I had this problem for months, where I'd pick English as the spell-check language, but it would \"forget\" when I re-started the browser.\nI checked my Add-Ons->Dictionaries menu and didn't have a listing for \"English (US)\", even though that's my default locale.  I manually installed it (from Mozilla's web site) and now when I set English as the spell-check language, the preference sticks.\nBottom line: if you're trying to tell it to use your system language as the spell-checker default, make sure you have a dictionary add-on installed for it first.\n", "Q: ubiquity automatic install stops at keyboard layout chooser I am trying to automate 12.04.1 64bit installation using ubiquity & preseed on a desktop live CD.\nIt almost works fine.

It should be noted that both editions use the same apt repositories, making it just as easy to install a server application on the Desktop Edition as it is on the Server Edition.\nThe differences between the two editions are the lack of an X window environment in the Server Edition, the installation process, and different Kernel options. \nPackage Tasks\nDuring the Server Edition installation you have the option of installing additional packages from the CD. The packages are grouped by the type of service they provide.\nDNS server: Selects the BIND DNS server and its documentation.\n\nLAMP server: Selects a ready-made Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP server.\n\nMail server: This task selects a variety of packages useful for a general purpose mail server system.\n\nOpenSSH server: Selects packages needed for an OpenSSH server.\n\nPostgreSQL database: This task selects client and server packages for the PostgreSQL database.\n\nPrint server: This task sets up your system to be a print server.\n\nSamba File server: This task sets up your system to be a Samba file server, which is especially suitable in networks with both Windows and Linux systems.\n\nTomcat Java server: Installs Apache Tomcat and needed dependencies.\n\nVirtual Machine host: Includes packages needed to run KVM virtual machines.\n\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) : is a network service that enables host computers to be automatically assigned settings from a server as opposed to manually configuring each network host.\n\nSource and If you would like to get more information look this guide. \n\nA: Basically Ubuntu desktop edition comes with a set of preinstalled software and in particular graphical interfaces (i.e if you boot Ubuntu server you will get a console and not a graphical login screen).\nTo reduce the load on servers, potential security risks, etc. the server edition comes with a reduce set of preinstalled software. The install process will also ask if you want to install specific services such as web server, mail server and so on. Additional technical differents exist such as different kernel parameters (the core software allowing your computer to work).\nOn the opposite, except the initial configuration both systems can install the same packages using the Ubuntu package manager so with some effort you can mimic the Ubuntu behavior on a desktop install or the opposite.\nSee the Ubuntu server edition manual for more information.\n", "Q: How do I get the 12.04 login screen to turn off screen after timeout?

I am using powertop to check that my machine is setup in a way that will give me good battery life.  After installing laptop-mode-tools all of the \"Tunables\" section shows \"Good\" except VM writeback timeout.  On the powertop page, it seems to suggest that 1500 (i.e. 15 seconds) is a good value.  Checking cat /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs shows that my current value is 60000 (i.e. 600 seconds or 10 minutes).  I believe a larger value means to wait longer between writes (which means spinning up the drive less frequently).  Do I really need to set the timeout longer than ten minutes?\n\nA: The larger the dirty writeback setting the longer dirty pages sit in memory before being flushed out to disk.  The downside is that this increases the window of opportunity for losing data if you lose power since there will be probably more dirty pages sitting in memory and not flushed out.\n\nA: Actually you don't need to set dirty_writeback timeout to more than 6000 centisec, but rather to less. At least for Powertop to smile: It seems Powertop checks for vm.dirty_writeback = an *exact* value of 1500 csec (15 sec). You can check by setting it to this value and look back at the powertop screen.\nOther than that, @Colin Ian King said it clear on the data loss widening window with higher timeouts.\n\nA: \nI believe a larger value means to wait longer between writes (which means spinning up the drive less frequently)\n\nNo, you're just delaying write operations to the disk by 10 minutes. This doesn't buy you anything in terms of battery life or reducing SSD writes.\nThe way to think about this value is: \"What's the longest ever possible time (times 2, even) that I would ever want a batch of disk operations to last.\"\nIf you have an application that actually takes 10 minutes (an absurdly high value for normal users) of disk writes that would benefit of being delayed in I/O, eg. multiple writes to the same file get made into one write, then you would set the timeout to a very high value.\ntldr; For 99.9% of users, the powertop suggested default is more than enough.\nIf you actually want to reduce writes to SSD, think about putting parts of your filesystem on tmpfs. But that's a whole other subject.\n\nA: I just want to add something to this in case anyone happens upon it. Even though this is a bit older we should never really have to touch this setting regardless of what powertop says. The kernel automatically makes adjustments for best performance on this since kernel version 3.5 with a feature called Dynamic Writeback Throttling. It allows the kernel to automatically adjust the vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs setting based on the system's available memory and the type of storage device in use. With this feature enabled, the kernel will try to maintain a balance between minimizing the amount of dirty data in memory and minimizing the number of writes to the storage device.\n", "Q: Unable to restart SSH daemon: Missing init script When I try to restart the ssh server I get the following output:\nbash: /etc/init.d/ssh: no such file or directory\n\n\nA: The script is named /etc/init.d/sshd  not ssh.\n", "Q: apt-get not working \nPossible Duplicate:\n‘apt-get’ does not work with Proxy \n\nEverything I try with apt-get fails.

When it is run, the application window will display a main menu with buttons labeled 'Document 1', 'Document 2', etc.  \nIf a user clicks on one of those buttons, the text from the corresponding document will be displayed in the window.  Very basic.

If you want to copy the output of ls to the clipboard here's what you'd do:\nWith xsel:\nls | xsel -ib\n\nWith xclip:\nls | xclip -sel clip\n\nThis can of course be utilized for other terminal commands as well.  Let's say you want to paste your network info into a help forum.\nWith xsel:\nsudo lshw -C network | xsel -ib\n\nWith xclip:\nsudo lshw -C network | xclip -sel clip\n\nMake this even easier with a new bash alias!\nEdit your ~/.bash_aliases file (if it doesn't exist yet create it first with touch ~/.bash_aliases)\nThen add one (depending on which program you decided to go with) of the following:\nalias copy='xclip -sel clip'\n\nor\nalias copy='xsel -ib'\n\nThen save and close.\nNow (after restarting your terminal) you can send standard output to the clipboard just by piping it to 'copy' (or whatever you decide to name your new alias)\nFor example:\nls | copy\n\n\nA: If you are attempting to copy to the clipboard using Ubuntu in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) xsel or xclip will not work unless you are using X Windows as clipboard is only for graphical.  However, to pipe terminal standard output to the clipboard in WSL Ubuntu you can use clip.exe.  You can then paste into the WSL Ubuntu terminal with standard paste commands and the copied text will be available in Windows as well.  For example,\npwd | clip.exe \n\nwill copy the current working directory to the (Windows) clipboard.  \nThis search result appears at the top when looking for ways to copy/paste text in WSL so I think it is worthwhile to mention this so readers do not needlessly install xsel or xclip in Ubuntu and instead use clip.exe.\n\nA: I Found This Solution Which I Think Is Simpler & Easy To Remember:\npwd | clipcopy\n\nYou Can Use It To Copy Other Things Aswell:\nifconfig | clipcopy\necho $PATH | clipcopy\nneofetch | clipcopy\n\nYou don't need to pass any other parameters, it copies directly to the clipboard.

You can check if the image contains recogniseable partition headers with:\nfdisk -lu disk.img\n\nWhich should indicate the presence of probably a single FAT32 partition, and tell you the offset in the img file (the number in the Start column). Then you can try and mount that partition using:\nmount -o loop,offset=START disk.img MOUNTPOINT\n\nWhere START is the offset in bytes found with fdisk and MOUNTPOINT is somewhere to put it.\nIf the disk image does not contain any recogniseable partitions there may still be readable bits of data.

Please, keep in mind I am very new and just starting out. \nI currently have an ASUS P8Z68-V LE motherboard and I'm not sure if the drivers are installed. Where would I go to find that out? I am using Gnome as my UI. If I don't have the drivers installed, where would I go? \nThe ASUS site only gives me options to download for various Windows OS, DOS and \"other\" (in .ROM format). \nWhich should I take and how should I install? I'm mostly looking for audio drivers. A lot of music I play, either on YouTube or with VLC has a faint crackling in the background on Ubuntu, which gets much worse the higher I turn the volume up. Could this be something other than the drivers? \nI doubt it's the hardware since the sound seems fine on Windows. I am currently running 12.04.\n\nA: There aren't generally any special motherboard chipset drivers that you need to install separately on Linux, like you need to do on Windows. The drivers are part of the Linux kernel. The hardware is detected at boot time and the correct drivers are loaded. \nThere are however cases where one might acquire hardware that is newer than the version of the kernel in the Linux distribution you choose to install; or even do not yet have any or full functionality in the upstream kernel. \nIn these cases though, you usually have to just wait or suffer, until the better drivers are available, as manufacturers typically don't offer additional drivers for Linux for these types of hardware. This is rarely an issue for motherboards though, as most of them use standard chipsets across the board, so are often covered by the drivers already available in the kernel. \nThe Ubuntu Kernel Team are also pretty good about ensuring that newer drivers are backported into the current development version of Ubuntu, to ensure a broader range of compatibility for users.\n", "Q: Only Wubi needed ..not the Ubuntu 12.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan I install 12.04 inside Windows? \n\nFirst, thanks for taking time to answer my question.\nMy question is that I have ubuntu 12.04 with me but no Wubi is in there..its asking me to do a regular Ubuntu installation instead of Wubi installation in my windows.\nSo I only need the Wubi not the Ubuntu installation files..How do I make sure that Wubi installation file I will download form Ubuntu.com will not initiate a download of Ubuntu 12.04 again as I already have the installation ISO with me and Direct Wubi to use that ISO to install Ubuntu alongside Windows?\n\nA: You can download Wubi from here.\nAlso have a look at installation instructions.\n\nA: You need to run the wubi exe that is on the CD/USB from within Windows in order to get a Wubi install. If you run the CD/LiveUSB after restarting the system, it will not give you the option to install inside Windows.\n", "Q: Samsung TV - mode not supported I am trying to install Ubuntu on an old Aopen XC cube.

This is a rather unique layout where the slash is between the context menu key and the arrow keys.\n\nHowever, the slash key does not work! How could I make it work?\n\nA: You can change the system-wide keyboard configuration (including TTY), by running:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\nas described in this SO answer.\nTo choose the thinkpadz60 layout shown in @brandizzi's answer, select the \"IBM ThinkPad Z60m/Z60t/Z61m/Z61t\" layout in the list. It should be above the \"Generic PC\" layout:\n\nEDIT: Also works on Debian\n\nA: I solved it (in part) by adding the following line in /etc/default/keyboard:\nXKBMODEL=\"thinkpadz60\"\n\nActually, I replaced the line XKBMODEL=\"\"  with XKBMODEL=\"thinkpadz60\". Then, I restarted the notebook. (Actually, I believe one would have just to restart X by running restart lightd or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+BackSpace. I suspect that it is even possible to reload this X configuration without restarting it but I have not found how to do it yet.)\nUnfortunately, the key still does not work at the text terminals. However, since I use (most of the time) the GNOME Terminal instead of the pure text ones, it is a minor nuisance because it works in the terminal emulator.\n(If you do not get it working yet, you can also type slash by pressing AltGr+Q and question mark by typing AltGr+W)\n\nA: I have the same Lenovo notebook with the BR ABNT keyboard.

I am getting a 404 not found when doing a mod rewrite in my htaccess file, accessing localhost\nHow can I get this to work, all references I found point me to edit a file in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled\nfor me there is no /etc/apache2 folder, where is apache installed then?\nusing xampp, http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html\n\nA: You have asked question for xampp in your title but you have described apache2 problem in decription. Both are different methods to run apache web server.\nxampp configuration is different than apache2. xampp contains apache and mysql inside it, if you have installed xampp, you don't need to install them separately.\nxampp does not identify a2enmod or a2dismod, even you have installed xampp in ubuntu. They (a2enmod or a2dismod) have been configured for apache2.\nThe configuration of xampp is very much similar like httpd of centOS or fedora.\nXAMPP is installed as /opt/lampp. Rewrite modules are enabled by default in xampp. You can check it in the file /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf.\nThere should be line\nLoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so\n\nthere in the file httpd.conf as well as mod_rewrite.so file is available in modules.\nIf line is commented, it means module is disabled. The line should be uncommented as well as .so file should not be corrupted if you want to use rewrite rules in xampp.\n\nA: Don't forget after setting in httpd.conf in this section:   \n<Directory />\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n        AllowOverride All\n        Order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n</Directory>\n\nyou should enable mod_rewrite:\nsudo a2enmod rewrite\n\nand then restart apache:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nTo ensure that, you can check from phpinfo in Configuration > apache2handler > Loaded Modules there must be written mod_rewrite and it means mod_rewrite is enabled. Hope it can help.\n\nA: I'm not sure whether XAMPP actually has the sites-available/sites-enabled, mods-available/mods-enabled structure that the Ubuntu Apache packages use. But if those directories are there, I would expect them to be somewhere in /opt/lampp/etc, because the main config file httpd.conf is there (according to http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html#385). \nAccording to some (quite dated) blog entries on XAMPP, there might be a fitting LoadModule directive in that httpd.conf, something to the effect of\n#LoadModule rewrite_module path/to/mod_rewrite.so\n\nIf this is still current, you need to remove the comment symbol (#) from that line. Additionally, you need to enable local overriding of the central settings (for example from a htaccess file or a vhost). So you need to look for \nAllowOverride None\n\nand change it to\nAllowOverride All\n\nThat may appear in the httpd.conf more than once, you need to adjust every occurence. After the next restart of Apache mod_rewrite should be working.\nAt the end of the day, the mod-available/mod-enabled system is \"just\" a conventient way to manage configuration snippets like the LoadModule above, see for example /etc/apache2/mods-available/rewrite.load from the Ubuntu Apache packages).\n", "Q: Split network between eth0 and eth1 At work, I have two networks - the hard wired eth0 is great for getting to local resources, but it is tied to a really slow internet connection.

Your 'default route' will route all traffic that isn't specifically configured by a static route. You want to configure your default route to go out eth1, and static routes for eth0. You can do all of this in NetworkManager or using the flat config files (or by hand if you want to test it). Your default route is identified by the line with the 'Destination' of '0.0.0.0'.\nIn networkmanager edit the eth0 connection, click on 'IPv4 Settings' then click the 'Routes' button, then check the box for \"Use this connection only for resources on it's network\". This should be all you have to do, then bring down and then back up both interfaces. If eth1 is configured for dhcp, it should set the default route for that connection and eth0 will only configure routes for the network it is connected to.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Why does my computer freeze when I adjust the brightness?

I have to hold the power button to force it to shut down, and start it back up. I can't seem to adjust the brightness.\n\nA: I had this bug on my Samsung laptop.  The trick that fixed everything for me was to add a boot parameter to grub during loading.  You can test to see if it works first by rebooting the machine and pressing e when the boot menu appears.  Then edit the kernel line to add acpi_osi= after the quiet splash part. Then execute grub (I forget the exact key combo, cntl-x or something). This basically tells the kernel to \"lie\" to the bios that you're not running Linux.  \nIf it works, you can make it permanent by editing /etc/default/grub to add it to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT parameter.

Once you format sda5 your home folder will be lost. All traces of Mint will be also gone, so there is no need to delete it first.\nYou can check the box next to sda5. It should be formatted ext4 and the mount point should be \"/\" (without quotes). \nYou can leave the swap partition alone. It is used as virtual memory and hibernation.

Something like [42m[1mAAPL:30.345 (B[m\n#!/bin/sh\necho `tput setab 2;tput bold`AAPL:`curl -s 'http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=AAPL&f=sl1d1t1c1ohgv&e=.csv' | cut -d, -f2;tput sgr0`\n\n\nA: If using the tmux backend for byobu, you will need to use a different format for color codes. Luckily, it's less complicated than the screen format.\nTo set colors, use #[<color and attribute codes>]. Examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*#[default]: restore default colors (use at the end of your custom status).\n\n*#[fg=red]: set the foreground color to red.\n\n*#[fg=#ff0000]: set the foreground color to #ff0000. Only accepts lowercase -- FF0000 won't work.\n\n*#[bg=black]: makes the background black.\n\n*#[fg=bold]: makes text bold. See below for more.\n\n*#[reverse]: swaps foreground/background colors.\n\n\nYou can combine them, e.g. #[fg=white,bold,bg=black].\nNamed colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, black, brightblack, brightred, brightgreen, brightyellow, brightblue, brightmagenta, brightcyan, brightwhite\nAttributes: dim, underscore, bold, reverse, standout, blinking, hidden, italics\nYou can also use the environment variables $BYOBU_LIGHT, $BYOBU_DARK, $BYOBU_ACCENT, and $BYOBU_HIGHLIGHT as colors.\n\nTo play with this, create a file, ~/.byobu/bin/1_hello with the following contents, and make it executable.\n\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"#[reverse]Hello world#[default]\"\n\nThis should create a black-on-white status notification that says \"Hello world\".\n\n\nHere are two example custom status bar components, and the codes that produce them:\n\n\n*\n\n*#[fg=#aa77cc,bg=#222222] @XXX.XX #[default]\n\n*#[fg=white,bg=black] ✉ ️X #[default]\nThis information will probably only work if you're using tmux and a color-enabled shell, though :)\n\n(Sources: /usr/lib/byobu/include/colors, /usr/lib/byobu/include/shutil)\n\nA: You need other color specifiers in screen (see Manpage of screen(1)).\nSo first you should save the value in a variable:\nAAPL=$(curl -s 'http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=AAPL&f=sl1d1t1c1ohgv&=.csv' | cut -d, -f2)\n\nAnd in the second step you can output it with printf:\nprintf \"\\005{= b}%s%s\\005{-}\" \"AAPL: \" \"$AAPL\"\n\n", "Q: Quicklists for Unity Launcher's Home Folder icon not working when Nautilus is closed If Nautilus File Manager is closed and I right-click on its Home Folder icon on Unity Launcher, only the tab \"Open in a new window\" appears. Quicklists(with all my Bookmarks) of the Home Folder icon works only when Nautilus is already open.\nI really don't understand what might have happened...\nHow to restore it?\nThanks!\n\nA: As mentioned in Ubuntu Wiki, there are two type of quicklists: static and dynamic. Bookmarks quicklist is a dynamic quicklist. So, it will be available only if your nautilus is running.  \nnautilus is always running in background unless you or some process killed it.\nIf you disabled nautilus to manage your desktop (for example you hid desktop icons) to restore quicklists you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a folder. From now on nautilus will be running even if you close all Nautilus windows, so quicklists will be displayed.\n\n*Just add nautilus -n to a start-up script like .xsessionrc in your home folder (see this answer). Or go to Startup Applications, click \"Add\" and insert the command nautilus -n. This way you can have nautilus autostarting in the\nbackground even if hide-desktop-icons feature is in use.\n\n\nA: Continuing IgniteE's solution:\nThere is no need to re-enable show-desktop-icons feature. Instead, just add nautilus -n to a start-up script like .xsessionrc in your homefolder. This way you can have nautilus autostarting in the background even if hide-desktop-icons feature is in use.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04: Open launcher elements only with double click Sometimes I click the icons of the launcher by mistake and I have to wait until the program opens to close it again. \nHow to open the programs in the launcher only if I double click them?\nThanks.\n\nA: The launcher is not hidden I guess? I would hide the Launcher and lower the sensitivity for popping up the launcher.\nAnd if you hit a button, hit the program that's opening and hit Alt-F4 it's the fastest way I can think of.\n\nA: No, It's not possible before the application starts completely.

I tried to change the driver installed that comes directly from the Nvidia page but it gave me an error at the end. Maximum resolution it presents is 1024x 768 and it is supposed to introduce more resolutions now that it is connected through a HDMI cable.\nQuestion:\nIs there an updated driver I can get for linux which would work? If not does anyone have a suggested fix for this?\n\nA: \nThe best way to install the Nvidia driver is through jockey.  It is in your settings under \"Additional Drivers\"  You can also type \"jockey\" in your dock to pull up the Additional Drivers.\nOnce you have it installed you can type \"nv\" into your dock and that should pull up the Nvidia Settings Manager.  Once you set this up you can go into the displays and set the Resolutions in there. \nThe default Ubuntu display manager won't work correctly.\nYou can install them with \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nLet me know if this helps.\nTo have the settings remain after reboots you need to run the Nvidia settings as root and save the xorg file.\nsudo nvidia-settings\n\nAfter you make all the changes you want click the \"Save X Configuration File\" and save it to the default location.\n", "Q: Join Domain and Dos App First off, yes I have read all the related topics and those fixes are either out of date or don't work.\nI am running 12.04 and I would like to add it to the Windows 2008 Server network.

Let's say they are 116, 7\nThen go to:\nls -l /sys/dev/char/116:7\n\n(char, because a tty is a character device, if you were tracing down a disk device you would specify block instead of char)\nIn the output from the command you will see something a little like:\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Sep  6 00:17 116:7 -> ../../devices//sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:13.5/pci0000:00/0000:00:13.5/usb1/1-3/1-3:1.1/sound/card1/pcmC1D0c\nThe directory /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:13.5/usb1/1-3/ and its subdirectories have much information on the device.

BUT, it is possible!\nSomething like this might work:\n\nudevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSB0 --attribute-walk\n\nFrom there, you'll get a bunch of information about the device and its parent devices.  Now, it's just all about parsing those data to get what you want.  I've used this in the past:\necho /dev/bus/usb/`udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSB0 --attribute-walk | sed -n 's/\\s*ATTRS{\\(\\(devnum\\)\\|\\(busnum\\)\\)}==\\\"\\([^\\\"]\\+\\)\\\"/\\4/p' | head -n 2 | awk '{$1 = sprintf(\"%03d\", $1); print}'` | tr \" \" \"/\"\n\nNow, if that's not a mouthful, I dunno what is!  Let's break it down:\nudevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSB0 --attribute-walk - returns info about the device and its parent devices\nsed -n 's/\\s*ATTRS{\\(\\(devnum\\)\\|\\(busnum\\)\\)}==\\\"\\([^\\\"]\\+\\)\\\"/\\4/p' - parses these data and returns any lines containing the \"devnum\" or \"busnum\" attribute.  We'll assume that \"busnum\" is listed first... and in that case... we can just grab the first two lines of output.\nhead -n 2 - Grab the first 2 lines of output.  We could get more fancy here, but we are just making an assumption that the closest parent's \"busnum\" and \"devnum\" are going to be listed first.\nawk '{$1 = sprintf(\"%03d\", $1); print}'  - Takes those digits and pads them with zeros.\necho /dev/bus/usb... - all this jazz is wrapped up into an echo statement to replace the newlines with spaces.  You can add the -n to echo if you want to cut off the trailing newline.\ntr \" \" \"/\" - replace the spaces in the output with forward slashes\nThis will output something like:\n/dev/bus/usb/001/011\n\n... which, of course, is the device.  If you'd like, you can easily output something like busnum:001 devnum:011 with a few tweaks:\necho `udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSB0 --attribute-walk | sed -n 's/\\s*ATTRS{\\(\\(devnum\\)\\|\\(busnum\\)\\)}==\\\"\\([^\\\"]\\+\\)\\\"/\\1\\ \\4/p' | head -n 2 | awk '{$1 = sprintf(\"%s:%03d\", $1, $2); print $1;}'`\n\n\nA: You are able to find all information about node using below command:\nudevadm info -a -p /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/\n\n", "Q: Disable OpenGL for compiz from command line I can run CompizConfig Settings Manager (ccsm) and uncheck OpenGL.\nHow can I do the same thing, but from the command line?

Usually it is the result of installing the drivers from nvidia's website before or after the drivers that you get from the Ubuntu repositories (which is the recommended source, I might add).\nTo solve this, you need to remove the driver (if you installed it using the run file, you can uninstall it using the same file (see below)).\nOr, you can delete the libraries associated with it (my apologies as I'm not on my nvidia powered laptop at the moment so I cannot check for certain as to which files you have to remove).\nIf you installed from nvidia's website, you can remove the drivers using:\nnvidia-installer --uninstall\nOptionally, you can run:\nsudo apt-get --purge nvidia-current\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\n\nA: To solve this I ran \nsudo apt-get -purge nvidia-current-updates \n\nAfter that I ran \nsudo apt-get -purge ndiswrapper\n\nthen I re-installed ndiswrapper, and reinstalled nvidia-current-updates.\nNow typing this from my working gui. \nThank you Roland Taylor\n", "Q: Ubuntu LTS performance is good but sometimes slow Ubuntu Unity is fast in my computer running multiple windows etc., but after an update, Software Center suddenly shows and when a script stops running (usually when I'm on FB), it suddenly slows down and sometimes freezes.\nHow do I prevent the script to suddenly stop?\nHow do I choose a tag, its so difficult to put one?\n\nA: Usually when the update program is running it will download all the new sources and process them which takes a bit of processing power to do, and then if you click update it will run through each one and install them...

You just have to remember that you need to do this for every database, as the extensions are installed per database.\nThe instructions above install the extensions in the database named postgres. To install it in your database just switch to your database:\n\n    \\c yourdb\n\nand repeat the process:\n\n    CREATE EXTENSION adminpack\n\nOn Ubuntu the admin pack is in the postgresql-contrib package.\n\nA: First, if you haven't installed contrib:\nsudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib\n\nTo iterate over several databases:\nsudo su postgres;\nfor db in $(psql -c \"SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datistemplate = false;\" | sed '1,2d' | head -n -2 | grep -v '^ postgres$'); do\n  echo \"Adding adminpack to ${db}\"\n  psql -c \"CREATE EXTENSION adminpack;\" ${db};\ndone\n\nAs a one(ish)-liner:\nsudo su postgres;\nfor db in $(psql -c \"SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datistemplate = false;\" | sed '1,2d' | head -n -2 | grep -v '^ postgres$'); do psql -c \"CREATE EXTENSION adminpack;\" ${db}; done\n\n", "Q: How do I search a PDF file from command line? I'm checking references of a paper and want to find the positions in the body where some paper (in the references list) is referenced. Is there a PDF editor which supports search via bash and extract the context of a position? I've tried to convert PDF to text, but didn't have a good result.\n\nA: To search for a regular expression in multiple pdf files using pdfgrep:\nfind /path -iname '*.pdf' -exec pdfgrep -H 'pattern' {} \\; \nwhere path is location for your pdf files.\n\nA: poppler-utils\nNote: xpdf-utils is a transitional package for poppler-utils.\nYou can use poppler-utils. poppler-utils is a suite of tools for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.\nTo install it you can use the Ubuntu Software Center, or by clicking below:\n\npdfgrep\npdfgrep can search a string or a pattern in PDF files recursively in directory trees, counting matches or printing some context for each match. For example, to recursively search keyword in /some directory, case insensitive:\npdfgrep -Ri keyword /some/directory\n\n\nPdfgrep is a tool to search text in PDF files. It works similar to\n  `grep'.\nFeatures:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*search for regular expressions.\n  \n*support for some important grep options, including: + filename    output. + page number output. + optional case insensitivity. + count\n  occurrences.\n  \n*and the most important feature: color output!\n  \n\n\n1Source:Ubuntu Apps Directory\n\nA: Just to add to the above answer, in particular you can use a command line tool from xpdf-utils called pdftotext and then search the text document created by this tool with grep.\nThis might look something like this:\npdftotext document.pdf - | grep -C5 -n -i \"search term\"\n\nThere is more information in the manual. The only drawback to pdftotext is that you can't us globbing to transform multiple files at the same time. This problem can be overcome with a small bash script:\nfor f in pdf_directory; do echo $f; pdftotext $f - | grep -i \"search_term\"; done\n\nIf you are having problems creating a text document from a pdf due to, for example, an incompatible pdf file, then that is another problem. \nI think in general, pdf editors don't include command lines because they are graphical. If you want to use bash, (or maybe zsh!) then you might have to use a terminal shell.\nGood luck!\n\nA: The reason pdftotext was without success might be that the PDF are scanned images and you need to OCR them, I wrote a quick way to search all pdfs that cannot be greped and OCR them.\nI noticed if a pdf file doesn't have any font it is usually not searchable. Knowing this we can use pdffonts.\nFirst 2 lines of the pdffonts are the table header, so when a file is searchable has more than two line output, knowing this we can create: \ngedit check_pdf_searchable.sh\n\npaste this \n#!/bin/bash \n#set -vx\nif ((`pdffonts \"$1\" | wc -l` < 3 )); then\necho $1\nocrmypdf \"$1\" \"$1\"_ocr.pdf\nfi\n\nthen make it executable \nchmod +x check_pdf_searchable.sh\n\nthen list all non-searchable pdfs in the directory:\nls -1 ./*.pdf | xargs -L1 -I {} ./check_pdf_searchable.sh {}\n\nor in the directory and its subdirectories:\ntree -fai . | grep -P \".pdf$\" | xargs -L1 -I {} ./check_pdf_searchable.sh {}\n\nYou also need to instal:\nsudo apt install ocrmypdf\n\n\nA: rga is a wrapper for ripgrep that is a much faster option for searching pdfs on the command line.\n", "Q: How to install KDE for different user on ubuntu 12.04 I am using Ubuntu 12.04 Gnome 2D.\nI want to install different desktop environments for different users, there are only 3 different users, 2 of them are in soders list with NOPASSWD\nI want one user to use KDE and other to use GNOME.\nHow to do that?\n\nA: It's really easy.\nAll you have to do, is install the Desktop Environments you want them to use, and then select them at login time.

These can be set up anytime and will immediately be accessible from the \"Browse Network\" entry in Nautilus.\nAfter right click on a directory from your HOME for Sharing Options we may be asked to download samba packages - do so. Then we tick the Share this folder box and give the needed permissions for this share to enable sharing over the network.\n\nWe may have to restart our session for changes to take effect. After having defined our shared directory we can browse it using Nautilus Browse Network where our share appears in the Windows Network/WORKGROUP/ directory.\n\nFo ease of use I have set my network adapter to bridged in the Virtual Box Manager.\n", "Q: Backlight does not work on Toshiba portege and LTS 12.04 I have a Toshiba portege.

I am planning to empty my D Drive (80 GB), and use that space to install the Ubuntu. \nHowever, I have heard some guys saying that if Ubuntu is installed on top of Windows, the latter becomes corrupted. Is it true? \nAnd secondly, after installing successfully (if possible), if I uninstall Ubuntu, will Windows reclaim all the occupied space in the D drive normally?\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu on top of Windows does not corrupt Windows; but yes as Ubuntu uses different file system (ext3 or ext4), this 80 GB partition will not be accessible from Windows. \nLater when formatting (if done), change the file system to one recognized by Windows (NTFS or FAT) and free space will be available for Windows.\n\nA: First of all, installing Ubuntu alongisde Windows does not cause any corruption in Windows. Once Ubuntu has it's own space, you will find that it just coexists peacefully.\nSecondly, Windows (or Ubuntu for that matter) will not automatically reclaim freed space. Furthermore, you cannot \"uninstall\" Ubuntu, but rather only format the drive. However, Windows will tell you that there is free space available if you reformat the drive Ubuntu was installed on.\n", "Q: Reverse-Engineer Driver for Multi-colored Backlit Keyboard on Clevo Laptops Here's my situation:\nI recently purchased a Sager NP9170 (same as the Clevo P170EM) and it has a multi-colored, backlit keyboard. Under Windows 7, you can launch an app that allows you to change the color of the backlighting to any of a handful of colors (blue, green, red, etc).\nI want that same functionality under Linux. I haven't been able to find any software that does this, so I guess I'm going to have to write it myself. I'm a programmer by trade, but I've haven't done much low level programming, and I've certainly never written a device driver, so I was wondering if anyone could answer these two questions:\n1) Is there any software already out there that does this sort of thing? I've looked fairly thoroughly but haven't found anything applicable.\n2) Where would I start in trying to reverse engineer this sort of thing? Any useful articles, tutorials, books that might help?\nAnd just to clarify: The backlighting already works, that's not the problem. I just want to be able to change the color of the backlighting. This functionality is supported by the hardware. The laptop came with windows software that does this and I want the same functionality in Linux. I am willing to write this software myself, I just want to know the best way to go about it.\nThanks!\n\nA: Well, as it turns out, someone else actually figured it out. A huge \"Thank You\" to \"klystron34\" over in the notebookreview.com forums. Check out the forum thread for more information. \nNote: As far as I know, this will work for many/most laptops based on the stock Clevo P150EM and the P170EM. This was personally verified by me on a Sager NP9170 on Ubuntu 12.04. Proceed at your own risk. I'm not responsible for any damage you might cause doing this, and any other standard internet disclaimers. Proceed at your own risk. Now, onto the good stuff:\nFirst, you need to be able to compile a kernel module, so update your repositories:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow, install git, the build tools and the kernel source:\nsudo apt-get install git build-essential linux-source\n\nNow create a working directory. I prefer to use a \"dev\" folder located in my home directory:\ncd ˜\nmkdir dev\ncd dev\n\nNow, download the source for the kernel module:\ngit clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/clevo-wmi/code clevo-wmi-code\n\nGo into the directory with the source code:\ncd clevo-wmi-code\n\n\"Make\" the kernel module:\nmake\n\nYou should now have a file called clevo_wmi.ko\nNow, let's test and see if the module actually works by loading the module:\nsudo insmod /home/<your-username-here>/dev/clevo-wmi-code/clevo_wmi.ko\n\nIf it worked, you should now have a new directory called:\n\n/sys/devices/platform/clevo_wmi/kbled\n\nChange over to that directory:\ncd /sys/devices/platform/clevo_wmi/kbled\n\nYou should now be able to change the colour of the middle section of your keyboard by executing the following command:\nsudo su -c 'echo 100 > middle'\n\nThe middle section of your keyboard should now be green. Replace middle with left or right to change the corresponding section of the keyboard. Here's a list of the color codes:\nGRB (Green-Red-Blue)\n000 - Off\n111 - White\n100 - Green\n010 - Red\n001 - Blue\n110 - Yellow\n011 - Purple\n101 - Aqua\n\nTo install this kernel module permanently, copy it into the same location as the rest of your kernel modules (NOTE: You will probably have to perform this step and the next step anytime you change your kernel):\nsudo cp ~/dev/clevo-wmi-code/clevo_wmi.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/platform/x86/\n\nNext, do this (I think rebuilds the list of kernel modules):\nsudo depmod -a\n\nThen edit your /etc/modules file and add this line to the end of the file:\n\nclevo_wmi\n\nSave your changes to /etc/modules.\nNow, whenever you reboot, the module should be loaded and you can then change the colour of the backlight on your keyboard. Figuring out how to have it change colours on reboot and remembering your last colour setting is an exercise left up to the reader. Check the docs directory in the sourcecode for instructions on how to use the dynamic colour changing features.\nThanks agin to the developer(s) that worked hard on writing this kernel module!\n\nA: How do you access such functionality?\nThis can probably be achieved by some clever scripting, and startup functionality.\n( In Windows you would likely need to write code in an exotic memory model allowing direct hardware access, or instead need to write a driver (and API) to detect and control the hardware. )\n\nHow do you select your preferences?\nThen some basic scripts (or icon calling scripts) could select a specific color-preference.\nIf you used Python, for a front-end GUI, it would also be fairly simple.\n\nA: There already exists an driver for all the functions for the whole keyboard AND flymode-key!\nTUXEDO Computers developed this driver and offers it through their support-forum:\nhttp://www.linux-onlineshop.de/forum/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=26\nHave fun :)\n\nA: I created a script for changing the colors using the above method by Pope.
