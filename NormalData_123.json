["Q: Can't remove RAID metadata from Dell R710 disks I've been trying hard to disable Dell R710 RAID mechanism to install Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS on the server but I couldn't so far.\nBased on this question's answers, I should boot using a live cd (done using ubuntu desktop 11), but the mentioned commands shows unexpected responses.\nsudo os-prober, returns nothing\nsudo dmraid -rE, returns no block devices found !\nPreviously I deleted the 3 virtual disks and their controller, should I try to reconfigure them again ?!\n\nA: The R710 supports LSI-based PERC controllers utilizing the mpt2sas driver and should work just fine with Ubuntu. You'll need to create virtual disks for the controller to expose via the driver before Ubuntu can see them to install on them. Without an OS installed, the easiest way to do that is to press Ctrl+R when prompted during POST to get to the controller BIOS option ROM (most likely this is where you deleted the virtual disks in the first place!) If you have a PERC S100 or S300 controller unfortunately there is no Linux driver for it so you would not be able to use either of those at all. But any of the PERC H200, H700, or H800 should work just fine.\n", "Q: hE: g15daemon: subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1 When installing various programs on synaptic and in terminal I got on 12.04 version of Lubuntu 64bit, I get this error message:\n\nhE: g15daemon: subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\n\nI had an error on an install in terminal but I can't trace it.

I have no idea how to fix this.\n\nA: I had the same problem as you and I solved it by changing the ~/.Xmodmap file to the one provided by dfacto. It is not perfect (the alt and super keys are switched by default, and it changes the trackpad to \"natural\" scrolling) but at least you have a super key. I guess that by understanding how Xmodmap works, this can be solved.\n", "Q: Network Card not initializing before startup programs. I am using Ubuntu 12.4.  I am using this machine to display a webpage.  I have installed the MKISOK plug in for Fire Fox and set Fire Fox to open on start up.  The issue I am running into is it seems like the network card isn't initializing right away so there is a time out error.  Is there anyway to make the network card initialize first?  \n\nA: You might be able to do that by launching a shell script at startup instead of Firefox. The shell script can pause for X seconds (to allow the network to finish loading) then launch Firefox. Try this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# pause for 30 seconds\nsleep 30s\n\nfirefox %u\n\nMake sure the shell script is executable. You can do that by checking the \"Is executable\" checkbox in the Properties page from your favorite file manager. Or you can use the chmod command, like this:\nchmod +x StartFF.sh\n\n", "Q: Macbook 8.2 wifi drivers- No internet connection I have a 17inch late 2011 macbook pro and am trying to get the wifi drivers installed but I am trying to do so without an ethernet cable connected.  My only access to the internet is wireless, so I was wondering whether there is a way to manually download and install the drivers since I can't get them by doing the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mpodroid/mactel\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: First, I would really really try to get a wired connection with your Macbook pro. It will be easier. It's always a good idea to have wired as a backup, in case say an update knocks out your wireless drivers or you accidently uninstall the drivers.\nOkay, since you said you can't get a wired connection, this should help you install the drivers without a wired connection. You will need an install CD of Ubuntu (or perhaps a USB drive with the CD image mounted on it).\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx\nFrom the webpage:\n\"No Internet access\nIf you do not have any other means of Internet access on your computer, you will have to install the bcmwl-kernel-source package from the restricted folder under ../pool/restricted/b/bcmwl on the Ubuntu install media.\nNote: Systems installed from CDROM can simply add the install CD as a package source and install bcmwl-kernel-source, automatically installing the required dependencies.\"\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Does Landscape support user management?

It runs a little hot as expected for a GPU.\nAMD Catalyst Control Centre lets me choose whether to run the system in high-end (ATI GPU) mode or Intel integrated GPU (better battery life).\nWhen I am in high-end GPU mode, Ubuntu works fine.\nBut when I switch to Intel Mode in the AMD CCC and reboot the machine, Ubuntu goes into 'low graphics mode'. The problem is not that it goes into low graphics mode; that is completely expected since I am no longer using the ATI GPU but the integrated Intel GPU. The problem starts with the 'Selection' of the options.\nOn that screen, I have no mouse pointer (I've even tried plugging in an external USB mouse) and no keyboard functionality. Thus I am unable to choose any option so that I can boot into Ubuntu.\nThe only thing I can do is switch to a terminal and enable ATI GPU through command-line. Then Ubuntu works fine again.\nIs it a bug that there is no mouse/keyboard available to me during the startup of Ubuntu when it's launched in low graphics mode? Any suggestions on how to work around it or fix it?\nMy palms are sweating as I write this down because the ATI GPU is really heating up my laptop. I don't want to boot into Windows or keep it around any longer than necessary.\nThe answer by Celso has helped me switch to Intel, thus giving me sufficient battery power. Kudos to Celso.

My development machine is running Precise, but some of my target servers are still running Lucid. I'm trying to set up my dev machine so that it can compile c/c++ for both Lucid and Precise. I already ran \naptitude install gcc-4.4 g++-4.4\n\non my dev machine but that unfortunately installed version 4.4.7 of the compilers where Lucid is running version 4.4.3. \nAfter some googling, I found this:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/devel/gcc-4.4\n\nwhich seems to be exactly what I want. Would adding this Lucid package to the Precise source.list  even work considering that this package was not meant for Precise?

I'm not even sure if gcc/g++ 4.4.3 will even solve my problem.\nI also acknowledge the possibility that I'm going about this all wrong. Is there a better or simpler way to compile for older versions of linux on Precise?\n\nA: No, it's risky and you can break your system, also if you want gcc-4.4 just install it from the official repos in Precise.\n\nA: Forget about GCC, your BIGGEST problem with the way you're going will be dependencies/libraries; the ones in Precise are usually much newer than Lucid.\nThe right way to build Lucid apps in Precise is to create a Lucid chroot and build inside it.\n", "Q: Trouble with aliases and opencv I have an alias defined to compile an opencv program which goes like this\nalias gcv='g++ -I/usr/local/include/opencv -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_objdetect'\n\nThen I go on to type \ngcv imageshow.cpp\n\nI get this long list of errors\n\nBut when I use the same command specified in the alias with the .cpp(source code) file in between the Include and Library files (following the suggestion here), everything works like a charm.\ng++ -I/usr/local/include/opencv imageshow.cpp -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui\n\nNow typing the long command, which gets even bigger as complexity increases, every time is getting difficult, please help me in getting the alias to work or suggest any other alternative.\n\nA: Try this without using aliases:\ng++ imageshow.cpp -o imageshow `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv` \n\n\nA: Why not use a simple script instead of the alias? \nfile gcv in ~/bin/\n#/bin/sh \ng++ $* -I/usr/local/include/opencv -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_objdetect\n\nAlternatively if you're using zsh you can use a function defined in your .zshrc file:\ngcv() { \n    g++ $* -I/usr/local/include/opencv -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_objdetect;\n} \n\nAutomated compiler and linker flags\nIf you're having linker issues, you can also incorporate pkg-config here:\n#/bin/sh \ng++ $* `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`\n\nSpaces in filenames\nWhile other posts on similar issues exist, handling spaces in the filenames is\nnot trivial so I thought I'd recap an elegant solution here; specifically I found \nthat making use of the IFS variable helps tremendously. \nSo making a small addition to end up with \n#/bin/sh \nIFS=$';'\ng++ $* `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`\n\nsolves issues with spaces in filenames too!\n\nA: The post on creating a shell script wasn't very clear ..

In Windows the Intel storage manager recognised the RAID volume and synced everything across. I have now discovered that my Ubuntu partition was not syncing between the two disks. How can I set it to respect what I now know is fake RAID, and use the disk that it has been using most recently (sda) to synchronise? The only entry under /dev/mapper/ is control. When using the Live CD the RAIDed partitions appear in /dev/mapper.\nUpdate: I am now working with RAID disabled until this is fixed.\n\nA: What you have is known as fakeraid as it doesn't have any hardware acceleration at all, it's just a gimmick that moves simple RAID creation out of the operating system and into the firmware. It's only real benefit is sharing the RAID between multiple operating systems, but that also means you're trusting multiple operating systems to update the metadata consistently and not barf on each other. I try to avoid it like the plague.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto\nShould answer all your questions. The original intend supporting this was to help new users migrate from Windows without having to nuke their hard drives. However once you get established, it's probably a good idea to migrate to a more robust raid driven by mdadm or even a HW RAID.\nSo assuming dmraid is installed, what happens after it scans your disks? Something should show up in /dev/mapper. The intel metadata format is the defacto standard for this, so it should \"just work\", unless that is the drives are already in use by the operating system.\nBe sure to reboot after installing dmraid, backing up critical files before hand is also a good idea.\n", "Q: How do I create a new text file with a new name from a phpscript everytime it is executed I use a Php script which is actually for sending sms from the terminal using an online sms service  160by2\nWhat it does is opens the terminal,asks for the number then the sms and it is sent...\nNow i want the text in that sms to be copied to a new file everytime.\nfor example like text1.txt then text2.txt and it goes on incrementing every time.\nIf its not possible from php script then may be i can rite a shell script that first executes the php script and then makes the new file with some command and copies the text in the sms into that file.\nI want to know that command( i guess pipelining is also used) and also,how to make the file name different everytime?\nI don't know shell scripting.\nbut in a normal programing language,like c/c++/java,the way would be a loop in which a variable is incremented everytime and then passed as a parameter to the name..is anything like this possible in shell scripting?\n\nA: here's a php script that writes a file named using the unix timestamp:\n#!/usr/bin/env php\n<?php\nfile_put_contents(\"file\" .

I am having a problem installing webgen 0.5 in Ubuntu 12.04.\nIn particular, I have a website written in Markdown, and webgen 0.5 fails with:\nError while working on </index.en.html> with Webgen::ContentProcessor::Kramdown:\nThe needed library 'kramdown' is missing.

(I tried installing in Ruby 1.8 gem, and Ruby 1.9 gem and I get the same error in both cases.)\n\nA: I've figured it out.  To answer my own question:\nFirst off, one has to be careful to install Ruby 1.8 gems.  First install Ruby 1.8 gems package:\nsudo apt-get install rubygems1.8\n\nNext, to install kramdown, make sure to install kramdown version 0.10.0 via:\nsudo gem1.8 install kramdown -v 0.10.0\n\nHowever, if you run webgen you will still get the error in the question.  The solution is to force ruby to use ruby gems on the path.  Before running webgen run:\nexport RUBYOPT=rubygems\n\nIf you did this but instead you installed the latest version of kramdown, then you get the following error (I paste it here so people can Google it):\nError while rendering </index.en.html>:\nwrong number of arguments (1 for 2)\n\nOnce the correct version of kramdown is installed, running webgen on markdown source works:\nStarting webgen...\nUpdating tree...\n...done in 0.0138 seconds\nWriting changed nodes...\n...done in 0.0011 seconds\nFinished\n\nIt looks like there is a quantal package for ruby-kramdown.

I mean, will this trigger a sudo poweroff command or is this an improper way to do it if my laptop isn't started?\n(and no, I'm not describing holding the button in as long as if the server is not responding)\nA similar function is implemented in Windows where I can choose what the power button should do (sleep/log off/power off).\n\nA: From what I know: Yes, it's a safe way to do it, it's exactly the same as saying sudo shutdown now -h -H.\nIt's the same on Windows and any other OS. If you long press the shutdown button, that's an unsafe way of doing it.\n\nA: I found the answer my self here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerManagement#Handling_hardware_events\n#!/bin/sh\n# /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh\n# Initiates a shutdown when the power putton has been\n# pressed.\n\nAnd as you can see the script tells me that Ubuntu will initialize a poweroff function when the button is pressed. Then I also asume that this is a safe way to do it. If not, please let me know by commenting.\n\nA: You can edit /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh to just run shutdown -h now as the first thing so it looks like:\n#!/bin/sh\n# /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh\n# Initiates a shutdown when the power putton has been\n# pressed.\n\n/sbin/shutdown -h now \"Power button pressed\"\nexit 0\n\n", "Q: Windows dual boot with Ubuntu as native OS I want to put Windows 7 on my machine but I'm already using Ubuntu 12.04- most tutorials and advice I can find only describe how to dual boot using Windows as the native OS, which I do not want to..\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this because there will be problems creating a dual boot from inside Ubuntu? \n\n*If so, what can I do? \n\n*I am required to erase my Ubuntu partition? Installing first Windows and then Ubuntu?\n\n\nA: Well,it is generally advised to Install windows first since GRUB detects Windows. If you install windows later, the windows boot manager doesn't detect Ubuntu and automatically starts Ubuntu.

How do I preceed from here?\n--update\nBy the way, looks like my HD is raid. Not sure, because I really don't know how to check, and don't know if this changes anything for using Wubi.\n\nA: *\n\n*Your problem is that Wubi is not supported on software RAID arrays.\n\n*\n\n*The error has nothing to do with NTFS. Wubi simply can't find the software raid volume /dev/dm-3.\n\n*Some users may get this to work on some systems, by building custom kernels, etc., but in general it's not a good idea.\n\n\n*Note that Wubi NEVER writes to the MBR; it simply modifies the Windows bootloader configuration.\n\n*With your software RAID, if you want to install Ubuntu without writing to the MBR, then you should do a normal Ubuntu install but towards the end, install the bootloader (GRUB) on the partition (i.e. NOT /dev/sda, but /dev/sda3 or similar).\n\n*\n\n*Then you can use EasyBCD (on Windows 7) to create a bootloader entry/stub from the Windows 7 startup menu to start your Ubuntu.\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*If you still can boot into windows then first install \"EasyBCD 2.1.2\" from softpedia.com. Go to BCD deployment tab, overwrite Windows 7 or XP boot-loader. Open \"Add new entry\" section. Open Linux/BSD tab. Click on type and select \"Wubi\" from there.

When you're in the grub menu, press 'e' to edit the commands before booting, and manually change the \" ro \" occurrences with \" rw \". Then F10 to go.\nWhen you (or the O.S.) upgrade the grub configuration, options are read only (ro). You have to edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg (at least, this is the file in Ubuntu 15), changing \"ro\" to \"rw\" (read/write), in order to make it persistent (just until next grub update). Anyway, you should trigger a script to make changes at grub.cfg changes.\n", "Q: Miro does not play Flash and HTML5 videos I wanted to watch the Olympics, so I installed Miro 5.0.2 (49960df1) on Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit.

The installation process on Windows goes fine, then Wubi demands reboot, I do so and choose Lubuntu from the Windows boot menu. Then it loads and at some point, it always fails, reporting an installation error due to issue with media, implying that media is dirty is or damaged. This is happening both with Lubuntu and Xubuntu. Oddly, I was able to install Ubuntu, but this is an old desktop and Ubuntu doesn't run smoothly, so I need to look for the lighter alternatives LXDE and Xfce.\nAny ideas on why this is happening and how to fix it?\n\nA: After some attempts, I finally managed to install Lubuntu with Wubi. \nThe problem was, most likely, related to overheating activity of the CPU, given the facts that the ventilation system of this desktop needs to be improved and the error window was repeatedly reporting file copying errors from the installation media. So the first thing I did today after a night of rest was this installation and it worked because the PC was cold enough to prevent any errors.\n", "Q: How to add frames to images (in shotwell)?

As in \"click plugin icon\", \"click select frame\", \"choose frame\", and voila, the picture is framed? If not, can some other application do this?\n\nA: I am a keen photographer and can confirm that. Shotwell doesn't currently have this capability. \nThere is an application available in the Ubuntu Software Centre that does with the simplicity you require. It's called Showfoto with Kipi plug ins.

No options \nPossible Duplicate:\nOnly ‘sdb’ shows up when installing 12.04 on a new Dell inspiron 14z \n\nI am new to Linux and trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 on a new HP Pavilion DV6TQE Ivy Bridge and being presented with the below screen which I believe is incorrect. My disk is set up as a basic disk (not dynamic) and I tried with a single C:\\ partition and by creating a second partition in windows with no luck. Any ideas? \n\nUPDATE: I think I know what the problem is but I don't know how to fix it yet.. My hard drive has a 32gb mSSD cache which is listed as dev/sdb. for some reason this is causing the installation trouble. \n\nA: This can be a symptom of computers with Intel Smart Response Technology / Intel Rapid Storage Technology. Basically, Intel does fancy stuff (including the solid-state-drive cache) to make the disk drive faster and more reliable. It's related to RAID ... the same file may be stored in multiple places etc.\nIntel has posted a PDF saying that DMRAID (the usual linux program to deal with RAID) is old and neglected, and incapable of understanding Intel's newest flavor of RAID. The other linux RAID program is mdadm (aka \"MDRAID\"), and supposedly works perfectly with ISRT / IRST and is supported by Intel.\nTherefore, it seems to me that the most logical solution is the one suggested by oldfred here: Open ubuntu in liveCD or live-usb mode, open a terminal and type\nsudo apt-get install mdadm\n\nAfter that finishes (strangely, it might install an email service in the process), immediately run the livecd's installer. With any luck it will work perfectly.\nWhen I encountered this same problem on my Dell Inspiron 14z, this procedure fixed the problem. [One other thing was, before I did the procedure above, I turned off acceleration in the Intel Rapid Storage Technology program within Windows 7.\nI don't think that step was necessary though.]\n\nA: The installer does not shows Any HDD because Your HP BIOS prevents the HDD. You have to disable this option by going into Bios Setttings and Harddisk configuration. After that You will able to see your HDD in Ubuntu Installer.\n\nA: Your machine happens to have Intel Rapid Storage for RAID.

I disconnected everything except for the keyboard/mouse/monitor/added video card when I ran the test.\nI've searched everywhere for what this means, but I only seem to find where people have the same error, but with a CPU0 at the end (e.g., \"Unexpected Interrupt - Halting CPU0\").\nDoes anyone have any idea what the error message means when there's just the \"Unexpected Interrupt - Halting\" error?\nI'm starting to test the memory modules one-by-one, but it would be nice to know if there's potentially something else going on.\nLearning a lot and really enjoying the OS (when the computer doesn't crash :-) ).\n\nA: From the source to memtest86+ I can see that the version (4.20-1.1ubuntu1) in Precise handles parity errors explicitly. (PARITY_MEM is defined in config.h to enable separate handling of vector ==2). \nSo the error you are getting is not for a memory parity error.\nAs a guess I would suggest that the memory test is triggering some memory-mapped I/O in your system, causing an interrupt as an accidental byproduct. This doesn't necessarily suggest a problem.\nKnowing the kind of interrupt from the next line of the error screen might help someone to narrow this down.\n", "Q: Help!

The machine itself isn't bad, but the support for drivers and applications don't cover the Power PC platform anymore. The only way to get their drivers to work is to use an old kernel, because the most recently supported driver is not compatible with the most recent kernel. (3.2X?) So, all I'm trying to do is rid myself of what is presented as: \"Software Rasterizer\" as the graphics. I know the situation is unusual, who uses PPC anymore? Well, dual core, and 2GB ram is better than anything else that I have laying around. (At least that single core Pentium 4 has supported software.) However, does anyone know how to get the xorg driver installed and working, or how to install the flgrx/catalyst drivers without emulation beyond belief. So far, I've tried everything I can seem to clearly comprehend without getting too out of my depth or dabbling far enough in to no longer know what I'm doing. (Turning of KMS, installing a new driver, etc.) All help in that region without binary blobbities would be greatly appreciated.\nAgain, I'm presented with another issue, with the 9600, unless I really ditch a good resolution on my monitor, whenever I log in, it automatically assumes that whichever output I'm not plugged into is the one I'm using, so I have to switch the DVI plug from port to port on boot. I read in:\nman radeon\n\nEDIT: Option is - \nOption \"ReverseDDC\" \"boolean\"\nWhen BIOS connector informations aren't available, use this option to reverse the mapping of the 2 main DDC ports. Use this if the X server obviously detects the wrong display for each connector. This is typically needed on the Radeon 9600 cards bundled with Apple G5s. The default is off. \n\nfor the radeon driver by xorg there was an option for this, but I foun it to be out of my abilities to fix. Does anyone know a fix for there as well? \nMy last included question is that when I boot, I get the splash screen with the colourful dots filling with orange or switching to white, I get a pure text version with the dots as simply periods, however when in Yaboot when booting if I enter\nLinux video=ofonly\n\nI get a splash screen with fixed colours and images. However when in Ubuntu 3D it does give some pretty interesting colours, while in Ubuntu 2D it works fine just on a really low resolution. Does anyone know what's going on here either?\nThanks to much for looking, and helping, all answers are observed with the highest of gratitude.\n\nA: There are no proprietary drivers for PowerPC.\nTo use the open source radeon 3d hardware acceleration under PowerPC you have to make a choice - use KMS or don't use KMS.  video=ofonly will turn on KMS (due to how the kernel is setup).   To use non-KMS you will have to use radeon.modeset=0 and downgrade the mesa package.  It is explained in the PowerPC FAQ and Known Issues pages. \nFor compiz (ubuntu 3D) it used to be the case you had to use indirect rendering with a radeon card, I don't know if that is still the case.  See if the command\nLIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=true compiz --replace ccp &\n\nmakes any difference to your interesting colours.\n", "Q: Download jdk 1.6 using wget I'm trying to get JDK 1.6 using the following command:\nwget 'http://download.oracle.com/otn/java/jdk/6u14-b08/jdk-6u14-linux-x64.bin'\n\nThe download fails and I suspect it's related to the fact that the website requires you to accept the license agreement.

Recently I had a couple of instances of programs sending data (copies of some of my config files) out over the net.  I consider this very bad form on behalf of the writers, and I want to prevent it happening in future.\nOne example was a program that had a command line diagnostic utility.  When I ran it, it immediately gathered up a bunch of info, not only the program's own config, but the system as well, and uploaded them to a server. Some of those files might have contained data like usernames and passwords.\nSo, like in Windows, I would like a program that warns me when another program tries to send data, or even initiate communication over the net, without my knowledge.  Ideally then I can whitelist only the programs I want to allow to do this, and the rest will be prevented by default.\nEdit:  I found a web page from 2007 that talks about this here\nThey mention three programs (Systrace, Tuxguardian and Program Guard) that used to exist, but I suspect cannot be used with the new kernels and distributions like Ubuntu any more.\n\nA: I don't believe there's a simple, non-technical solution. That said, if you're willing to get your hands dirty, read on.\nUbuntu uses a permissions framework called AppArmor, in which each application has a \"profile\" that defines what it is allowed to do. If you have administrator privileges, you can edit AppArmor profiles to allow applications on your system to do less. You can also create restrictive profiles for binaries that don't have them. Profiles are stored in /etc/apparmor.d/.\nYou'll want to read the AppArmor Profile Language Guide and Ubuntu Community Documentation. In essence, however, you want to remove all network permissions, and then put all profiles into \"complain\" mode so you know when they're trying to do networking with:\nsudo aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/*\n\n", "Q: How do I get ARF video to play in webex?

Does it mean then this OS cannot be configured by sudoers forever? Is there any method to set new administrator?\n\nA: What Would Happen\nIf you configure your system so that no users are administrators, then no one will be able to perform administrative tasks as root with sudo (or its graphical frontends, such as gksu, gksudo, and kdesudo) or PolicyKit. Assuming the root account remains disabled, you will not be able to log in as root (even from a virtual console) or su-to-root either. Barring possible security vulnerabilities, this would prevent anyone from performing administrative tasks in the running system.\nFixing the Problem\nHowever, if you did this, the problem would still be easily fixed, assuming you have physical access to the machine. Fixing this problem is similar to resetting a forgotten password, except you add the user to the sudo and/or admin groups with usermod, rather than resetting their password with passwd.\nHere's one method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into recovery mode by holding Shift while booting and selecting it. Select the option for a root shell. You'll get a shell with a # prompt (rather than the usual $). This means it's a root shell. Any command you run here is run as root.\n\n*If you know your username, skip this step. To find out your username, run ls /home. This is a pretty reliable way to list the usernames of the human users of your system (while omitting user accounts like www-data and nobody which are used internally but don't represent real people).\n\n*Run these commands to add username to the necessary group(s) to be an administrator. (Replace username with the actual username.)\nusermod -a -G sudo username\nusermod -a -G admin username\nThis separately attempts to add the user to the sudo and admin groups. In Ubuntu releases up to Ubuntu 11.10, administrators were in the admin group. In Ubuntu 12.04 (and in future releases), administrators are in the sudo group; if a 12.04 system was upgraded from a previous release, both groups will exist.\nSo you can put the user in just one, if you know which one, or you can just run those two commands and put them in whichever exists. I advise doing this with two commands so that if one group doesn't exist, the error doesn't stop usermod from attempting to add the user to the other group.\nRecovery mode is usually accessible. But occasionally it may be broken, disabled, or require a password, in which case you can boot from a live CD, chroot into the installed system, and run the usermod commands. Here's a procedure for doing that, adapted from my considerably more general answer here:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't already have one, burn an Ubuntu live CD/DVD (on Ubuntu, Windows, or Mac OS X) or write an Ubuntu live USB flash drive (on Ubuntu, Windows, or Mac OS X).\n\n*In your Ubuntu system (not the live CD/DVD/USB system), run the following command in the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T). You do not need to be an administrator to do this.\nmount | grep ' on / '\n\nYou should include the spaces before on and after /.\n\n*That command produces something like /dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro,commit=0) as the output. The text before on (not including the space) is the device name of the partition that contains your Ubuntu system's root filesystem. Remember it (or write it down).\n\n*Boot the computer from the live CD/DVD/USB and select Try Ubuntu without installing (not Install Ubuntu).\n\n*Run these commands, replacing /dev/sda1 with the device name of the partition containing your Ubuntu system's root filesystem, if different (and username with the name of the user account you wish to give administrative abilities).\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo chroot /mnt\nusermod -a -G sudo username\nusermod -a -G admin username\nexit\nsudo umount /mnt\nAs with the other method, you can use ls /home (run this after the chroot command) to see a list of users on the machine, if you don't know the username.\nAlternatives to Eliminating Administrators\nOn Ubuntu, when you're an administrator, you still need to authenticate with sudo or PolicyKit to perform actions as root. This is considered to be at least as secure as using su to perform actions as root, since anyone who can compromise your account in such a way to read your own password (for sudo) can also read root's password (for su). Furthermore, there are some substantial advantages (explained here) of sudo over su, and enabling the root account, while quite possible, is neither recommended nor officially supported in Ubuntu.\nIf you decide that even though sudo and PolicyKit require your password to perform actions as root, you still want yourself and all other human users on your machine to run as a standard user (and not as an administrator who can run commands as root), you have two easy options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can enable the root account, but this is discouraged as explained above. Also, by default you will not be able to log in to a graphical session as root, and you should not configure your system to allow this, as it's particularly dangerous to run an entire graphical desktop environment as root (a security bug in any part of it could compromise your system). Also, most GUI programs are not tested as root so there may be substantial usability bugs. If you do enable root, you should only ever log on as root from a virtual console (or use su).\n\n*The better option is to just create another user account for administrative purposes. Make this account an administrator.

I'm looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*a safe/secure web admin control panel for a web server\n\n*preferably free and open source\n\n*in official repositories or at least with regular updates and an easy way to update to newer versions\n\n*allows email and username creation (preferably if it allows to choose sftp-only/ssh+sftp access)\n\n*supports configuring email aliases and forwarding\n\n\nFor example, I saw that DTC (Domain technologie control) is (or better said, was) included in debian, but not in Debian stable/testing and Ubuntu 12.04 because of recent security issues.\nWhat's the recommended admin control panel for Ubuntu servers? \n\nA: ServerPilot, my company, can fulfill most of these needs for you.\nHere's a high-level overview of what we have right now:\n\n\n*\n\n*a central web interface for all of your servers,\n\n*a secure web interface,\n\n*uses a small Python agent to avoid hogging resources,\n\n*avoids clobbering popular default packages (nginx, php),\n\n*creation and management of PHP 5.4 and 5.5 apps,\n\n*creation and management of MySQL databases,\n\n*creation and management of system users\n\n*standard hosting control panel functionality is free (we charge for advanced functionality such as monitoring)\n\n\n\nWe exclusively support Ubuntu servers.\nThe way this works is that you (1) have a pre-existing Ubuntu server, (2) sign up for ServerPilot, (3) get an api key for your server, and (4) install our agent.\nOnce installed, our agent keeps a low profile and waits for management work to do. (You create work by creating/updating/deleting sysusers, apps, databases in our web interface.)\nAfter having to deal with many control panels ourselves, here are a few reasons I'm very-enthusiastic of our agent-based system.\n\n\n*\n\n*No resources on your server are used except for management tasks and basic communication (e.g. \"let's see if there's any work for me to do.\").\n\n*Our agent connects to us so we can help you manage Ubuntu servers whether they're on EC2, your home network, in a VM or colocated. (If you're a developer, this can help you achieve dev/prod parity.)\n\n*Our agent doesn't expose any public services/ports for ServerPilot.\n\n\nTo be clear, we do not have the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*management for email,\n\n*an open source product (though the Python agent is unobfuscated), or\n\n*an installer that's available in the official repos (all other packages we install are signed and managed by apt).\n\n\nWe're new, but we're just getting started :)\n\nA: Sounds like you are looking for something like Webmin or usermin.  \nIt will make tasks easier for you but it can make things too easy and if you don't know what you are doing on the back end, you may never know.

The developers run their own repository, it's actively maintained, it does user and email account creation and aliases. The only drawback is that it doesn't really offer an option to give users ssh access.\n\nA: You can use Core-Admin (http://www.core-admin.com).

All of my google results on this question are about just learning to use synaptic.\nI've noticed that Ubuntu's TTYtter package is quite a ways behind.

But how do I go about that?\n\nA: Initially do Read this Packaging/ SourceBuilds/ GettingStarted guide\nFirst Create a Launchpad account\nThen proceed to ttytter Packaging branch , then Select the Version of Ubuntu you want to Contribute to .\nContact the “Ubuntu branches” team for Uploading your version to ttytter Packaging branch. \nCreate your New source package recipe - Precise for Example\nNOTE : I am assuming they would allow you , otherwise as con-f-use in the above answer mentioned , create your own PPA , then Upload your package to PPA.  \n\nother Useful Links\nHow do I create a PPA?\nHow do I create a PPA for a working program?\nComplete Ubuntu Packaging Wiki Guide\n\nA: That is true with almost all applications in the Ubuntu repositories: They lag behind in their versions. The reason is that Canonical usually checks the packages for security and compatibility with Ubuntu. Also someone has to build the .deb package and upload it to the repository. That adds an extra step and slows things down but increases the quality and feel of Ubuntu.\nThat being said, you can't update the main repository. All you can do is create your own ppa on launchpad and hope people use it. Lauchpad has good introductory guides on how to do that. You could also get in touch with Canonical and propose your new build.\nIf you want to \"update\" TTYtter only locally on your system, you're free to do so but the next update in the main repositories might override your changes with yet another outdated version (which might break your configuration). To prevent that you should put updating on hold sudo aptitude hold ttytter (more info).\n", "Q: How to rename partitions in the system? I migrated from windows 7 to Ubuntu 12.04.

I have set it to \"suspend when inactive\" after 30 minutes.  \nHow does it determine whether it is inactive? Is it just user input via keyboard/mouse?  \nIf I leave a program working away - say processing a video, which takes a long time, will it suspend after 30 minutes and stop that program?  Same question for long downloads, will it suspend halfway through.\n\nA: Good question. Let's find out!\n\n\n*\n\n*Beginning by investigating the \"Suspend when inactive for\" option,\n<property ...>Suspend when inactive for</property> ...\n<object ... id=\"combobox_sleep_ac\">\n\nwe can learn that it sets a GSettings key called sleep-inactive-ac-timeout:\nwidget = GTK_WIDGET (gtk_builder_get_object (..., \"combobox_sleep_ac\")); ...\ng_object_set_data (G_OBJECT(widget), \"_gsettings_key\", \"sleep-inactive-ac-timeout\");\n\nThe documentation for this key provides a brief description:\n\nThe amount of time in seconds the computer on AC power needs to be inactive before it goes to sleep. A value of 0 means never.\n\nbut still doesn't explain what \"inactive\" means.\n\n*Searching for sleep-inactive-ac-timeout leads us to GNOME Settings Daemon,\ntimeout_sleep = g_settings_get_int (..., \"sleep-inactive-ac-timeout\");\n\nwhich periodically checks a property of GNOME Session called Presence.status:\nresult = g_dbus_proxy_get_cached_property (...->session_presence_proxy, \"status\");\n\nIf it finds that the status is idle, it puts the system to sleep:\nidle_set_mode (..., GSD_POWER_IDLE_MODE_SLEEP);\n\nSo we need to learn how GNOME Session decides whether the system is \"idle.\"\n\n*Following backwards from where GNOME Session updates the value of Presence.status,\ngsm_presence_set_status (presence, GSM_PRESENCE_STATUS_IDLE, ...);\n\nwe can see that it uses the IDLETIME counter from Xorg:\nif (... && strcmp (counters[i].name, \"IDLETIME\") == 0) {\n    ...->counter = counters[i].counter;\n\n\n*The IDLETIME counter's behavior is summarized in a blog post by the author of GNOME Power Manager:\n\ngnome-power-manager uses a counter inside Xorg called IDLETIME. This counter is incremented only when the user does not move the mouse, or click some keys. When the user clicks something, the IDLECOUNTER is reset.\n\nThis tells us that Ubuntu determines inactivity by measuring the amount of time that has passed since the last keystroke or mouse motion. CPU usage and network activity do not factor in.\n", "Q: How I can update my octave-3.2.4 to octave-3.6.2?

You can install it from the Ubuntu Software Center, or click the image below.\nRemember that gparted won't work on a mounted partition. First you have to unmount .\nNOTE: You might want to consider doing this from a live/bootable CD or USB, to be safe.

You may consider Clonezilla\n\n\nA: As Mitch has said you will need to do this from a live environment so that sda1 is not mounted. Also make sure that swap is not being used - if necessary right click on the swap partition and swapoff.\nYou'll then need to move the partition with the install (sda1) to the left so that the unallocated space is to it's right.\nThen you can expand sda1 to use the unallocated space.\nIt could take a long time - do not use battery - do not assume it has hung and turn it off.

See How do I create a desktop wallpaper slideshow? on how to do it.\nHowever, if my understanding is correct, you are asking how to create a customised background with multiple images.\nTo do this you need to use an image editing software (like GIMP) with layering capability.  In this software you can build your custom background as you like with multiple image with the ability to place, resize, rotate etc.  You can the \"lock\" the layers and use the image you create as your desktop background.  FYI, GIMP is available from the ubuntu software centre and is quite difficult to use for a novice.\n\nA: Builtin image viewing software Shotwell has an option.\nOpen \"Shotwell\", then import images to it or if previously showing then select your images, then go to Shotwell \"file\" and select \"set as desktop slideshow\" and choose time gap.

Okay so I'm having major issues installing/running iTunes through Wine, but I'm in major need to create (and be able to restore from) a full, complete backup for my iPhone since I'm doing a ton of tweaking to it.

If i start playing music via built-in rhythmbox music player and switch user - music stops until i switch back :(. Is it possible to continue play music while switching to another user?\n\nA: There is a launchpad bug concerning this issue. The suggested remedy is to change the 0 to a 1 for the \"SYSTEM_START\"-option in /etc/default/pulseaudio:\n# Start the PulseAudio sound server in system mode.\n# (enables the pulseaudio init script)\n# System mode is not the recommended way to run PulseAudio as it has some\n# limitations (such as no shared memory access) and could potentially allow\n# users to disconnect or redirect each others audio streams. The\n# recommend way to run PulseAudio is as a per-session daemon. For GNOME\n# sessions you can install pulseaudio-esound-compat and GNOME will\n# automatically start PulseAudio on login (if ESD is enabled in\n# System->Preferences->Sound). For other sessions, you can simply start\n# PulseAudio with \"pulseaudio --daemonize\".\n# 0 = don't start, 1 = start\n    PULSEAUDIO_SYSTEM_START=1\n\nIt is actually not a bug though, but a feature. For most people this is expected behavior. They don't want to have other users sound playing over their own. Additionally it is standard conformant.\n\nA: I don't believe this is possible.\nBy the very nature of what you are doing \"switching user\" you are effectively logging out to transition from an environment with differing permissions and values of the other\n\nA: You could open a screen-session (by using the \"screen\"-command, the \"screen\"-package may be installed by default, but I'm not sure)\nThen, you could use something like mplayer (without a gui) from the command line. As the screen-session isn't terminated when logging out, mplayer will go on playing. This should work for every commandline-app, btw.\n", "Q: Is there a convenient command for fetching all needed latexpackages of a specific .tex file? Is there a convenient command for installing latex packages in the console? I only use an normal editor and pdflatex for editing, so I don't want textlive or any other big program.\nIf there is: How to fetch all needed latexpackages of a specific .tex file?\n\nA: The Ubuntu Way\nThe various LaTeX packages, i.e. graphicx, pslatex and so on, are managed by the regular sofware repositories. So you can install must, but not all tex packages with Software Center or Synaptic. However not all LaTeX packages there are up to date and even worse: Not all exist in the repositories. Some of the more related packages are bundled together in one. E.g the Ubuntu package texlive-science includes these latex packages (as of this writing). Search the description of the Ubuntu packages for the latex package you want and hope you find it in the right version.\nIf you have a lot of free space you can just install texlive-full, which most likely will include all the latex-packages you will ever need and many many many more.\nUsing texlive and tlmgr\nYou can install the latest version of texlive using the net install script of tug.org. You should uninstall the Ubuntu version of texlive before hand. Then you can install packages using the normal tlmgr Texlive package ManaGR:\ntlgmr install <package name>\n\nTo update a package use:\ntlgmr update <package name>\n\nTo update all packages (and tlmgr itself):\ntlmgr update --self --all\n\nInstalling manually\nIf you want the latest version or a package not included by both the Software Center and even tlmgr you will have to install the package manually. Here it depends on the package. Just follow the installation instructions of the packages if it provides any.  CTAN and the Tex online catalogue have prezipped versions of many tex packages. Here is a Guide on how to install them.\n\nA: I know your question is specifically about console commands but have you looked in the Ubuntu Software Centre? There are 139 applications relating to LaTeX. Check out these search results.\n\n", "Q: How to Install Babylon on Ubuntu? Can someone please tell me how to install Babylon Dictionary on Ubuntu?

This means my DSL WIFI routergets reset after 2-3 hours max. The network is secured and requires password to connect. So when the router resets and comes backup after a few minutes, my laptop (Ubuntu 10.04) doesnt auto reconnect to it. Instead I am presented with a password entry dialog box to connect to  the network. How can this re-connection be made automatic? Is there some retry counts or timeout that I can set somewhere so that the network manager will try for at least 10 minutes to connect to this network before popping this dialog box.\nThanks.\n\nA: Maybe not the cleanest way of doing this, but you could make a little script and let is execute every 5 min using cron.

I occasionally use Dark table also as I think it is a promising project.\nThere is one piece of functionality that any of these applications have that I miss from my Photoshop/lightroon days.  That is the ability to create image layers.  I am aware GIMP has this capability (and I use it reluctantly) but unfortunately I am not a big fan, so my question is simple.\nOther than GIMP, is anyone aware of FOSS image editors with layering capability? \nTo be concise I am not asking about creating image montages or collations this is simply about creating layers from a single image (background replacement etc)\nOther editors I have tried, Raw Therapee, Bibble Pro\n\nA: A program I have used is Pinta, which is a GTK implementation of Paint.net version 3;  it may thus look familiar to people who have used that other program. It has good support for image layers, although obviously nothing like as much as the GIMP. Make sure that you have the layer toolbox opened and visible on screen (see the right hand side of the screenshot); this can be enabled from View > Tool Windows > Layers. At the top of the menu bar is the layers tab, which has options for adding new layers, merging layers, altering the various transparency levels and more. \nIt is possible to do much in Pinta with layers as this  tutorial demonstrates, and this is an excellent introduction to the programs's layer functionality. It is apparent that backgrounds and objects can be removed, changed, or made transparent. Other photos or objects can be superimposed upon existing pictures and then the result merged and saved as a new file. The GIMP has more options and functionality, but Pinta will probably suffice for relatively straightforward image editing with layers.\nAs a note, the version of Pinta in the repositories is version 1.1; the latest available version is 1.3, which has some improvements in layer handling and one or two bug fixes. In particular, layers can now be rotated and zoomed, which may be useful in some projects. The latest version is available as a PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pinta-maintainers/pinta-stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pinta\n\nInstead of the PPA, you can of course build the very latest version from source using the stable source code or the GIT development code; see here for more instructions.\nNote: I have just successfully compiled the Git version, and the version from there is labelled as 1.4, and there are a few other minor bugfixes and changes. However considering this bugreport regarding saving images, which may affect some users of the Git development version, it is probably best to use the stable PPA version.\n\n", "Q: Can I use testdisk to recover the Windows partition over which Ubuntu was installed? I got a new Windows 7 laptop, tried to install Ubuntu 12.04 for dual boot and messed up my hard drive partitions. So opted for a clean install of Ubuntu by formatting the entire disk. (Which makes my question different from this one, How to recover data from formatted swap?)\nI need to use Windows every now and then so I was looking for a way to restore everything back to the factory setting. I didn't make the recovery disks, silly me right. I was wondering if I could reset everything back to the original setting, i.e., Windows 7 with the orignal 750GB HDD and the recovery partition which is still there. I can see the recovery partition as /dev/sdb in Ubuntu.\nIs it possible to do this with testdisk, http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk ? If so how can I do it?\n\nA: No, I doubt testdisk will recover even a partially usable Windows installation after you installed Ubuntu over it twice; a lot of the original data has been overwritten and is now irretrievable.\nYour best option is to look at the manual or online on how to use your recovery partition to restore the computer to its \"factory\" state -- the recovery partition should contain everything necessary to do so. This recovery mode is often triggered by pressing a special key combination at bootup, an option in the BIOS boot menu, etc.\n", "Q: After upgrading to 12.04 LTS it returns incorrect password After upgrading my netbook to the current version of 12.04, I am unable to login.

My modem is set to DHCP enabled dynamic IP.\nEdit 2:\nSorry for my late explanations, but I must firstly explain the scenario:\nThere is a company with 20 staff. I developed a web application with PHP/CodeIgniter for them. Where they want to use it inside their local network.\nI install an Ubuntu server 12.04, and want to make it a local server for this purpose. I need to assign a static IP address for this server, where it musnt changed.\nI have a TP-Link Wireless Router, where the internet connection is provided through this router. It is DHCP enabled.\nNow for this, what I need? How I must configure my server?\n\nA: I solved my problem like this: I reserved an IP address to my server MAC address from my Router interface and it worked perfectly. Thanks for the guys here which they helped me solve my problem.\nAlso, thank you all too.\n\nA: For safety, it is generally a good practice to have a non routable ip address for an internal LAN and then have a second adress for connecting to the Internet. \nThere are a series of three non routable addresses that are available: \n\n\n*\n\n*10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, \n\n*172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 \n\n*192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255. \n\n\nGetting back to your initial question, I would check the contents of /etc/resolv.conf which is where the computer will indicate addresses of a namseserver or nameservers.\n", "Q: Can I integrate the gmail ubuntu webapp with a google apps domain?

Windows XP threw an error message while installing, stating that the files cannot be copied onto the harddisk.

My 2nd drive is mounted at /mnt/shared, and the storage/disk in VB points to /mnt/shared/VirtualBox/VDI/WinXP.vdi. \n\nA: This is a permissions issue. You do not have the correct permissions assigned to the VM. You would want to do something like this:\nsudo chown -R hariharan:hariharan /path/to/vm/folder\n\nReplace hariharan:hariharan with the appropriate username:group, and /path/to/vm/folder with the path to the folder that contains the vm disk image and settings.\n", "Q: Folder with images in makefile I have been using anjuta to make some programs.

How can I edit the makefile so that the images are included ?\n\nA: I managed to find a solution to this problem without modifying my MAKEFILE at all. On the other hand I don't know if that solution is acceptable or it's more like an alternative and temporary one.\nAfter creating the tar.gz archive, I opened it with archive manager and clicked 'Add a folder to this archive' then selected the 'images' folder to be added inside the 'src' directory.\n\nA: Try AUXFILES := /src/images/icons/files for each file.

Now I need a directory (let's name it 'outside') where no encryption will be active for maximum harddisk-performance (audio-recording). Would it be sufficient to 'mkdir /home/outside', or better 'mkdir /outside' (followed by appropiate chown and chmod)?\n\nA: If you choose to encrypt your home directory, then each user's home may be encrypted separately, with separate keys. All of /home is not encrypted with the same key.\nFor audio recording, you might want a separate or external drive.\n", "Q: Is there a way to connect to a local pc via a gateway without having the gateway shine through? When I'm at work I can use nautilus to navigate files on other computers of the local network comfortably. Nautilus mounts the other computers file systems using ssh (sftp via gvfs). However when I'm at home I need to connect to a gateway (via ssh) server for security reasons. From there I can ssh into the local computers. This breaks nautilus ability to browse the files as I can just see the gateway and there is no direct sftp link I could use in nautilus.\n\n*\n\n*How can I use nautilus to browse files on machines of my work's local network from home?\n\n\n*How do I need to configure the gateway to make that possible (If it's possible at all)?\nTo make thinks worse I only have user (not root) priviliges on the gateway.\nI strongly suspect there is no solution outside having our sys-admin installing a VPN, but AU has supprised me with clever solutions in the past.\nEdit:\nIt was suggested to run nautilus on my work computer. I did so using X-forwading: ssh -t -C -X gateway ssh -t -X me@workpc nautilus. Unfortunately I get an error that says \"Nautilus cannot handle sftp locations.\"\n\nEven if x-forwarding worked properly it would have to distinct disadvantages:\n\n*\n\n*Slow responding GUI\n\n*No drag and drop of files to my local (=home) machine\n\nSo still looking for a better solution. Is there no such thing as ssh forwarding, so that the gateway just pushes all ssh requests to my work-pc?\n\nA: I can think of two possible solutions. Each involves running nautilus on the remote computers instead of your home computer.\nFirst. If your gateway box can run nautilus remotely, use something like:\nssh -X gateway.company.com nautilus\n\nThis would start nautilus in the gateway (assuming it is installed) and display it on your home computer. Then you may be able to browse other computers in the LAN using sftp if you know their local host names or IP addresses.\nSecond. If the gateway does not have nautilus installed or for some reason sftp from within nautilus does not work when running on the gateway, you can try to run nautilus on one of the destination machines like this:\nssh -t -X gateway.company.com ssh -X computer.with.files.to.browse.local nautilus\n\nThis would open nautilus in the final remote destination \"computer.with.files.to.browse.local\" and display it on your home computer via the gateway.\nSee details at: https://serverfault.com/questions/149846/access-remote-server-with-nautilus-through-double-ssh-tunnel\nHope this helps.\n\nA: In your gateway, mount your workpc: gvfs-mount sftp://username@workpc/\nIn your PC at home, use Nautilus to connect to your gateway and access ~/.gvfs on it: type sftp://username@gateway/home/username/.gvfs in the location bar and you'll see your workpc mounted there.\n", "Q: Firestarter exits after closing I'm using Firestarter on Ubuntu 12.04.\nI configured Firestarter to run even after closing in the preferences menu. \nBut still it exits after closing.\nIt doesn't minimize to system tray.\n\nA: A few things, and a recommendation.\nFirst, Firestarter isnt the firewall itself.  It is a graphical front-end to the iptables firewall that comes with ubuntu by default.  iptables will always run.  However, with Firestarter, when it closes, it clears out the iptables rules, which is why Firestarter needs to remain open for the firewall to work.\nSecondly, this might be a bug in Firestarter itself, and you should file a bug as such.\nThirdly, Firestarter is not recommended for use anymore, due to it not having been updated in a while, since support for it has been dropped from Ubuntu developers.  Therefore, it is more strongly recommended to use ufw or gufw (gui frontend for ufw) in place of Firestarter, as that is updated actively, and is actively developed.  Like Firestarter, they work with the iptables backend.  They, however, leave the rules in place upon exit, so the firewall rules will still run, unlike with Firestarter.\n", "Q: Driver problems with NVidea Geforce GO 6600 on ubuntu 12.04 I have install Ubuntu 12.04 in my computer and I want to Know, what is the best driver for the video card NVidia Geforce GO 6600?\n\nA: To install/Update Nvidia card drivers open Terminal.

I already had Windows XP and Linux Mint in dual-boot, with the Grub Menu presenting the entries for both OS. Now that I've installed Ubuntu using Wubi, the original Grub Menu is intact, which was expected, because Wubi makes an entry on Windows boot menu. So I choose Windows XP from the original Grub Menu, then it displays the Windows boot menu, featuring Windows XP and Ubuntu. If I choose Windows XP, Windows is loaded, however if I choose Ubuntu, yet another Grub Menu comes up, with all three options there - Windows XP, Linux Mint and Ubuntu.\nThis is a bit unnecessary and redundant. Originally, I was expecting to have the original Grub and then Windows Boot Menu, now that there is a second Grub, I am afraid I might have some boot problem when I uninstall Ubuntu from Windows. How should I proceed to keep only one of the Grub menus, without compromising the possibility to boot into any of the OS?\n\nA: On the wubi install: sudo chmod -x /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober. Then sudo update-grub\nI'm surprised that Windows XP appears on the Wubi grub menu - it's supposed to be suppressed (maybe that's only for Vista/7). But in any case, if you disable 30_os-prober it won't find any other operating systems and will suppress the grub menu by default.\nUninstalling Wubi will have no effect on your existing linux install (and it's grub setup).\n", "Q: How do I configure Apache to run multiple instances?

It shows me drive C 198 GB, which is my main drive that has Windows on it. Do I pick that drive?\nAnd is it possible to use Wubi in windows 8 CP without problems?\n\nA: \ndo I need to partition my drive as for a Installation drive? It gives me drive c 198GB with is my main drive that has windows on it. do I pick that drive?\n\nNo partitioning, just run the installer.\nYes select drive C:/ or whatever drive you want that has enough space.\n\nand is it possible to use wubi in windows 8 CP without problems?\n\nConsidering it hasn't been released yet, I don't know but you won't destroy your PC trying.\n\nA: Wubi is treated as an ordinary Windows application (such as winamp, mozilla, chrome, etc.).\nWith Wubi you don't have to repartition your hard drive, and to remove Wubi you just uninstall it like you uninstall other applications on windows.\nI haven't tried Wubi in windows 8 before, but I think it can run without problems.\n\nA: What Wubi does, is to create a harddisk image file. Perhaps you've heard of \"iso images\" or \"cd images\"? It's the same thing, except it simulates a harddisk instead. To Windows, this is simply a large file. To Ubuntu, it's the harddisk. \nIn order to use a Wubi installation, you don't need to format your disk or anything like that. It's just a folder in your Windows filesystem. Whether or not it will actually work with Windows 8, I suppose will depend on what Microsoft has done to their boot loader. If there's significant changes from Windows 7, then it may not work. Otherwise it should. \nOne issue you should be aware of when using Wubi is that because a lot of people have dropped Windows altogether, Wubi installs aren't quite as well tested as normal Ubuntu installed directly onto your harddisk. Which drive you install it to is irrelevant to Ubuntu, except, obviously, it needs to be available so don't install to a removable drive. :)\nIf you do have some extra space on your drive, though, I'll always recommend a normal install. It's just as easy, though you will need to write a CD or make a bootable USB stick. \n\nA: No. It doesn't work. While the new graphical Windows boot manager lists Ubuntu, when you click on Ubuntu it says that the OS can't be launched due to an Error, and thats because (I think) Windows boot manager only allows Windows intallations and it checks for errors.\n", "Q: Install ubuntu from usb when there is only win 8 on computer Now there is only single win8 OS on my laptop.

For GTKMM i would use emacs/gedit/anjuta or eclipse with pkg-config plugin. \nIn my experience i found Gtkmm more close to STL and C++ in general, you can also use boost in some places. Qt is a more complete framework which provides things that are also available on boost and STL. Try both and see what you like better.\n\nA: If you're using QT, then http://kdevelop.org/ should be a strong contender.  It has both a code-centric IDE as well as a GUI \"builder\" interface.

You would find http://library.gnome.org/users/evolution/3.2/mail-error-failed-to-append-to-sent-folder.html\n\nA: When sending a mail, Evolution tries to store a copy of the sent mail if configured such (which seems to be the default). For each account, you can define the folder where sent mails should be stored into. If an error occures causing Evolution to fail storing the copy, it falls back to store it into its default (local) \"Sent\" folder instead, so you do not simply lose it.\nI'd recommend you check the settings of your mail account where you are facing this problem. To do so, in Evolution, go to the menu and open Edit -> Preferences. As it is the first entry, it should be automatically open the Email Accounts tab (if not, do so yourself). Mark the account in the main window, and press the Edit button to the right. The 4th tab (Defaults) in the window which now opens shows the folder configuration.

I have an Asus EEE PC 1005HA netbook dual booting Ubuntu and Windows 7. When I close the lid in either OS the laptop will go to sleep.

If I do it in Windows then the netbook will eventually hibernate and the battery will be fine.\nAny ideas what I can do to fix the battery drain problem?\n\nA: The reason is that you have set the settings of When Lid Is Closed to Suspend in Ubuntu\nLets understand what Suspend means and what Hibernate means-\n\nSuspend -\nSuspend means to save the state of your machine to the RAM of your computer.\nIn this case,RAM is volatile memory which requires power to function.And thus it uses battery.\nWhen you resume from Suspend,it is quocker than resuming from Hibernate\nHibernate -\nHibernate means to save the state of your machine to the HARD DISK/HDD/SDD of your computer.Now,anything saved in HDD/SDD does not need power to stay there.Thus no power is needed.\nResuming from Hibernate* is slower than resuming from Suspend\n\nSo if you want your PC to act same as it does in windows when the lid is closed,\n1.Go to System Settings\n2.Select Power\n3.In the When Lid Is Closed menu,select Hibernate\n", "Q: Wlan-Card named 'eth1'? My Wlan-Card is named as 'eth1'. Last week it was wlan0 and now it turned to eth. I don't know why and don't know how to change this.

So why does not the second command copy regular files (those not hidden) ? \nWhy is the dot . interpreted literally in cp command?\n\nA: cp, as well as the rest of the built-in shell commands, accept and expand glob patters and not regular expressions. They are similar in some aspects, different in many. For example, the . is literal in globs, and any single character is matched with ?. \nYour friend in this case is man 7 glob.\n\nA: Bash doesn't use regular expressions at all, it uses its own rules for wildcard expansion (called \"globbing\".  The dot is simply a character, and the '^' character negates whatever follows.  so the first example matches files starting with a dot, not followed by a second dot, and the next one does the same; There is no need to escape the dot but it is accepted anyway.\nEdit:  After looking at the suggested \"man 7 glob\" by Marios, I was mistaken, I think, about the '^' character.  It seems to say that [^.] would be undefined rather than a not character.  Bash uses an exclamation point for negation.\n", "Q: How do I set Nautilus to Default view?

Sometimes my charger remains plugged into laptop even after charging is complete.\nIs there a way to get a pop-up message/notification when my battery gets full due to charging or is there any software/package which can provide the functionality?\n\nA: I have written a small script that will do that:\n\n\nScript:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nwhile true\ndo\n    export DISPLAY=:0.0\n    battery_percent=$(acpi -b | grep -P -o '[0-9]+(?=%)')\n    if on_ac_power; then\n        if [ \"$battery_percent\" -gt 95 ]; then\n            notify-send -i \"$PWD/batteryfull.png\" \"Battery full.\" \"Level: ${battery_percent}% \"\n        fi\n    fi\n    sleep 300 # (5 minutes)\ndone\n\n\nInstallation:\nRun:\nsudo apt-get install acpi\ngit clone https://github.com/hg8/battery-full-notification.git\ncd battery-full-notification/\nchmod +x batteryfull.sh\n\nCopy the script to ~/bin folder (why the ~/bin folder?) :\ncp batteryfull.* ~/bin\n\nOr copy it to /usr/local/bin if you want it to be available for all users on your computer:\ncp batteryfull.* /usr/local/bin\n\nThen add batteryfull.sh script as a startup application by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Dash\n\n*Search for Startup Applications \n\n*Double-click the icon\n\n*Click Add and fill in as follows:\n\n\nA: Install the acpi package.

The following star makes it mean \"tab or space 0 or more times\". The trailing \"$\" means that it should match the end of the line. The final grep means that lines NOT ending in a \":\", any number of tabs or spaces and then \"charging\" and the end of the line should make grep exit with status code 0. This means that grep will return 1 as long as the computer is charging. The if will execute it's first branch when the status code is 0, which means we are effectively negating the result of grep, since we exit 1 when grep exits 0 and exit 0 when grep exists non-zero.\n\nA: Here is the Crontab that I use\n\n\n*\n\n*Notify if battery is full (equal to 100%)\n*/1 * * * * if [ $(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity) -eq 100 ]; then XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u) notify-send Hey \"Battery Full\"; fi\n\n\n*Notify if battery is low (less than or equal to 10%)\n*/1 * * * * if [ $(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity) -le 10 ]; then XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u) notify-send Hey \"Battery Low\"; fi\n\nExample Notification Image:\n\n\nA: I was looking for the same thing and found this extension and it works as expected.\n", "Q: Intel Wifi isn't working after upgrading to kernel 3.5 After installing kernel upgrade from 3.2 to 3.5 wifi does not work. I have intel wireless. Wireless adapter isn't shown in network settings. How can I enable wifi?\n\nA: \nThere is a reason the mainline kernels are meant for debugging and testing purposes only. See the below question for more details -- it explicitly warns you may lose wireless:\n\nShould I upgrade to the \"mainline\" kernels?\n\n\nI recommend you go back to the official Ubuntu kernel. The mainline kernels, or kernels you build yourself are not supported and often result in problems with graphics and/or wireless. While the Intel wireless drivers are in-kernel, there is no guarantee they will always work on a non-official kernel.\nIf you were having problems that required you to try upgrading to a mainline kernel, please open a question about that problem and we can try to help you resolve it with the existing kernel.\n\nA: I had this bug too. Try to find more info about your wifi driver with modinfo. In my case is modinfo brcmsmac. If that's the case, you can follow instructions from here to re compile the driver (isn't that difficult).\n", "Q: Why does uninstalling bootchart makes Lubuntu slower?

You can increase the temperature value of \"smart fan\" to something higher so it keeps being quiet.\nBut you risk getting your CPU overheated. So it's basically your choice. I have mine set at 45C.\n\n*Clean the PC if it's dusty, add extra case fans to keep the case cool.\n\n*The other option is to buy a new CPU fan that produces less noise, less than 22dB. For example, 15dB is approximately the level of a whisper sound.\nAbout decibels (dB): http://www.howstuffworks.com/question124.htm\n", "Q: How to set a shortcut for each application in Gnome 3? Is it possible to use a shortcut for each application in Gnome3? For instance, in Unity I use Super-1 for the first application in laucher, Super-2 for the second one and so on.\nEDIT\nThe alternative solution I found was to use each application in a separate workspace and set a shortcut for each workspace using using dconf-editor org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings.\n\nA: I see you have a solution, but another alternative would be to install THIS \"Dash Hotkeys\" extension, which is essentially what you asked for. As of testing under 3.4, it also allows you to switch to the running app, say number 6, which hasn't been added to the Dash; so you can switch to anything running as well.

Any GUI service monitoring utilities out there that essentially display a green light if a service is up? \nThanks.\n\nA: Maybe a combination with screen will help. \nFor auto reconnect you will need a key authentification too.\nI created an alias:\nalias sshtunnel='TERM=xterm ssh servername -a -x -t /opt/local/bin/screen -xRR -A -e^Zz -U -O -S tunnelToServer'\nScreen ensures that you terminal session is alive.\nLast step is creating a script which checks the host and starts the alias again:\n$ while :; do while ! ping -c1 -t1 server >/dev/null; do sleep 10; done; sshtunnel; echo Connection to server dropped at $(date); sleep 10; done\nThat should survive all network drops.

What versions are safe? I would like to have Gnome and KDE on Ubuntu. Last time I installed Gnome-full has broken my login screen and it was not ubuntu login screen anymore. It was like Gnome login that I saw in Debian.\n\nA: Installing Gnome 3 (Unity and Gnome Shell) and KDE will result in software from both environments in the Menu, such as the Unity dash and the Gnome Shell applications grid and just as that Gnome Software appearing in KDE's menus.\nGTK software will most likely than not appear bad looking in KDE and viceversa, to remedy that you should use the oxygen-gtk theme for GTK software in KDE and use qt4-qtconfig to theme K software under Gnome 3.\nNothing will brake, not that I know of. When you install one of the two you will be asked what Display Manager you want to use (GDM or KDM or LightDM).\nAlso, the vanilla Ubuntu package which contains unity is called ubuntu-desktop, the one with vanilla gnome is gnome and the one with vanilla KDE is kde-full, that is different from the kubuntu-desktop package.\n", "Q: Unity doesnt work after activating the sky cube in CSSM I was trying to activate the sky cube in compiz.  \nClosed the program and rebooted now I only get the desktop screen with no icons.

I found out this question which is exactly my problem. \nIf this is not possible using libido and indicator how is the sound indicator implemented ?  \n\nA: The sound indicator is not exported from an application. If you create a media-player, you never specify that there are sliders or play-pause buttons, you just say, that the application is a media-player. \nYour problem is, that you can not sent the information \"I need a slider\" to the software which creates the menus. It is not that this software can not create sliders.\nFor details of the implementation, you can look at the code: bzr branch lp:indicator-sound\n", "Q: Installed 12.04, now case fans don't work So I installed Ubuntu 12.04 and now my case fans never run, even when booted into Windows 7. The only fans that ever come on are fans directly attached to a device (i.e. cpu/gpu/psu). Anything on a molex connector never spins up.\nHas anyone seen this? I've tried reseting my bios to defaults but that didn't do anything. I guess grub is the only common denominator between Linux/Windows? My case fans used to come on the second I hit the power on, though, which is pre grub.\n\nA: If you're using fans powered by the 4-pin molex connectors, and they aren't coming on at all, then there is a problem with your power supply I would suspect, or the fans themselves. In fact, I would be surprised for you to have anything powering on at that point.\nIt is a hardware issue, unrelated to Ubuntu.\n\nA: Dobey's right.

For example, I have 10000 files and I want to find the ones that have the READ ONLY flag. In another case I want to search for another that has a particular owner. Or in another to see the files that are READ ONLY and EXECUTABLE.\n\nA: It's probably easiest to use the find command, which allows you to recursively search through the directory tree. For example, if you particularly wanted to find files that were read-only, you could type \nfind <specify location> -type f -perm -444\n\nFor files belonging to a particular user you could use \nfind <location> -type f -user mike\n\nFor files executable (for all) you could use \nfind <location> -type f -perm -777\n\nFor those that are executable and read-only for all you would use 555 in place of 777 in the example above. You can also search for files that belong to a group by substituting -user mike for -group mike. \nTo negate the search terms and so search for the exact opposite, you can use an exclamation mark like this: \nfind <location> -type f ! -perm -444 \n\nNote: Specifying a dash before the permissions (e.g. -perm -444) means that all files that have a read only flag will be found and not just those that are 444; to search for 444 exactly and only that, simply remove the dash (e.g. -perm 444).\nNote2: Combinations of permissions can be sought as well using -a for and and -o for or; for example to find exactly these permissions, type: \nfind <location> -type f -perm 744 -o -perm 666\n\nDirectories can be searched for with -type d. \nSee man find for the other available permutations.\n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 7? I'm trying to set up a dual boot Lenovo Ideapad that came with Windows 7.\nLenovo uses up 4 partitions out of the box. They are:\n(unnamed) 14GB\nLENOVO D: 30GB\nSYSTEM_DRV 200MB\nWindow7_OS C: 400GB\nI have no idea what the first 3 do. Ideally, I could shrink the Windows7_OS partition (down to, say, 100GB) and then install Ubuntu on extended partitions created in the freed space.\nThe first sticking point is that I can't resize ntfs partitions from gparted. The problem has been encountered before in other threads: How can I resize NTFS partition in GParted? . I have tried everything there with no luck.\nI also can not seem to resize the Windows partition from Windows. The \"Virtual Disk Manager\" keeps throwing a cryptic \"The parameter is incorrect.\" error when I try. I don't know what to do about that.\nI tried using:\nntfsresize -s100GB -f -b /dev/sdb2\n(/dev/sbd2 is the Windows7_OS partition) After that operation, the \"Virtual Disk Manager\" in Windows sees a 400GB \"volume\" with 100GB of capacity.\nWhile it appears that I have succeeded in taking away space from Windows, resizing from either OS is still not successful for the same reasons as before.\nDisabling \"virtual memory\" in Windows does not fix my problems. Neither does running \"chkdsk \\r\" or \"chkdsk \\f\" several times. I also defragged from Windows with no luck.\nWhat can I do?\nMy best current guess: make a Windows 7 install disc (how?) , wipe clean the hard drive (it's a new computer), install Ubuntu, create an extra partition, install Windows on that (which I assume will somehow leave the partition table alone), then reinstall GRUB (or maybe all of Ubuntu) to get over the MBR problem.\n\nA: If you're wiping it completely clean, you might as well install windows first by disc and then ubuntu with a downloaded install disc.  \nI just did this and it lets you choose what size you want to make each while you download ubuntu (that is why it is good to have windows there first).\nEDIT:\nEliah Kagan pointed out that since your problem seems to be partitioning in ubuntu, you might want to partition while installing windows and then just have ubuntu install on the rest.\n\nA: I ruined my system, because I didn't realize this:  Windows I believe installs and take the whole amount of space on your disk, for it's partition.  You can make a USB bootable (google it) and try out Linux, then just use F12 during boot up, to choose to boot to the USB, don't follow the instructions to change windows to select the USB to boot, that's messed up.

However, often I find that I drag the overlay scrollbar to the top or to the bottom of the window, but I am nowhere near the beginning or the end of the document.\nCurrently to finish scrolling I either:\n\n\n*\n\n*a) click the scroll button 50 times to go page by page. \n\n*b) drop the\nscrollbar, move my mouse towards the bottom of the scrollbar and\nclick and rescroll\n\n\nI am really getting annoyed with this! Is something I am doing wrong?  Is there another way to make it work just like regular scrollbars where you grab the elevator and drag to where you want to be?\n\nA: The problem is most likely that you are not using the position indicator (the orange bit), but instead are scrolling using a random point of the right edge. So your scrolling looks like this:\n\nTherefore, you finish with your dragged part at the very top, but because the handle keeps a constant position relative to the position indicator, the position indicator is not at the top -- and consequently your content is not at the top either.\nInstead, you should drag the position indicator directly (for long documents, it can be a bit hard to see. To aid with recognition, the handle also gets an orange outline as soon as you are over the indicator):\n\nThis way, you drag the position indicator and if you scroll all the way to the top, also your content scrolls to the top.\nThat said, if all you want to do is scroll all the way to the top/bottom, there is quicker way to do that: Aim your mouse pointer to the top right or bottom right of the overlay scrollbar and press the middle mouse button -- this will directly jump to the corresponding position, i.e. to the top or the bottom of your document.\n", "Q: How can I make a script run at a standard time interval My end goal is to get a notification when my isp dynamic ip address changes.

I'm trying to optimize the boot process on my Ubuntu 12.04 laptop, and while analyzing the /var/log/boot.log file I found many unknown key 'BUS'....

Now I'm using xubuntu-desktop as desktop.\n\nA: The log messages tell you they are from udev, and the errors are in the two files /lib/udev/rules.d/10-blackberry.rules and /etc/udev/rules.d/15-huawei.rules.  The question is from where did those two configuration files originate?\nFiles in /etc/ are configuration files.  As the system administrator you may edit them.  Did you create 15-huawei.rules?  If so, then it is your responsibility to update it.  If it was installed by a package, then first see if an update is available and if not then file a bug.\nFiles in /lib/ are installed by packages, and are not intended to be modified by the system administrator.\nRun the command  \ndpkg -S /lib/udev/rules.d/10-blackberry.rules\n\nand  \ndpkg -S /etc/udev/rules.d/15-huawei.rules\n\nto determine what package, if any, provided those two files.\nThe udev package's Changelog shows \"The long deprecated keys: SYSFS=, ID=, BUS= have been removed\".  You have two files that use those keys,  which are no longer valid.  Either you don't really need those configuration files (do you have Blackberry and Huawei devices and plug them into your computer?) or they simply need to be updated to match the current version of udev.\n", "Q: How can I edit the color of this button using a GTK theme? Here is a screenshot of my current theme--Everything works but two things.\nEdit: I deleted the picture--Thunderbird had information that was probably not best to show online. Basically, the interface buttons for Nautilus were a different color than that of Thunderbird.\nLook at my Nautilus menu: I was able to change its color by editing button_bg_color in the gtk.css file. However, Look at the Thunderbird interface's buttons--they are not the same color. Some programs have the color from the Nautilus interface for buttons, while some have Thunderbird's. (These programs are selected randomly to show the differences.) How can I change that?\nAlso, does anyone know how I can set different applications to use different themes or different parameters? Things like LibreOffice and Evolution (My actual email client) are unreadable with my theme\n\nA: Use Gpick sudo apt-get install gpick to see which color is it, then locate the color in the gtk.css file, afterwards search the line from gtk.css in the file gtk-widgets.css to make sure which one is it.\nI Believe Thunderbird uses the gtkrc file from the gtk 2 portion of the theme so check that. Firefox uses gtk 2 styling not gtk 3 so I guess Thunderbird does too.\n", "Q: Macbook pro 8,1 ubuntu 12.04 sd card reader doesnt work \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to get my laptop to detect SD cards inserted into its built-in card reader? \n\nTHe built in sd card reader on the macbook pro 8,1 (2011, early or mid i think) doesnt work AT ALL.

This way, other filesystems will not be mounted in the new root mount and any files hidden by mounts under / will be uncovered and counted in your analysis.\nAssuming your root filesystem is on sda1 (df will tell you which device it is):\nmkdir root-rebound\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 root-rebound\nbaobab root-rebound\n\nand then tidy up when you're done:\nsudo umount root-rebound\nrmdir root-rebound\n\nAlternatively you could unmount said file systems manually. You can also scan just your home folder, because it will most likely contain the source of the excessive disk space usage.\ndu has two options which are able to prevent counting other filesystems:\n\n -x, --one-file-system\n         skip directories on different file systems\n     --exclude=PATTERN\n         exclude files that match PATTERN\n\n\nThus, \ndu -hx\n\nwould ignore all other mounted filesystems or\ndu -h --exclude /media\n\nwould ignore all files in /media where most filesystems are mounted.\nIf you're using du, sorting so that the biggest things appear at the bottom of the list can help decipher the output. eg:\ndu -hx | sort -h\n\n\nA: Depending on the type of filesystem you might not be allowed to mount the root filesystem on a mount point under /. You'll get something similar to this:\nmount: /dev/sda1 already mounted or /mnt busy\nmount: according to mtab, /dev/sda1 is mounted on /\n\nMounting read only (-o ro) might help. If that fails, use a bind mount:\nmount --bind / /mnt\n\nOnce mounted, use whatever tool to analyse the disk usage, ie du -sh * | sort -h\n\nA: This bug report explains how it is possible to configure baobab to ignore directories. Unfortunately you cannot do it inside the app itself, but you have to use dconf-editor and open org.gnome.baobab.preferences. Here you will find an item excluded-uris; change this to ['file:///path/to/ignore'] (worked with single quotes for me).\n\nA: Baobab attempts to give you control of the devices/partitions that you scan -- go to Edit->Preferences.  Typically, you only want to scan the device at Mount Point /.  This doesn't recognize all types of links/mounts/bindings though, so ultimately Baobab may still produce confusing results if you have a non-trivial configuration.\n\nFor du, the following shell function called dutop will display the top-level of the specified folder (or the current folder).  With this, you can probe sub-folders one at a time.\nfunction dutop() { du --max-depth=1 --one-file-system -h $@ |sort -h; }\n\nThis will likely report inconsequential \"Permission denied\" errors if you apply it to /, but you could resolve those with somethink like the following, which will ask for your password (if you haven't recently provided it).\nfunction sudutop() { sudo du --max-depth=1 --one-file-system -h $@ |sort -h; }\n\nFor large folders, these may take a while.  They won't report any incremental status because the sort operation is buffering all of the intermediate results.  It's fine to abort with Ctrl-C if you get tired of waiting.\n", "Q: Toshiba Satellite L645D screen brightness does not work on Ubuntu 12.04 I've installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Toshiba Satellite L645D and the screen brightness does not work.

In a terminal, type:\nsudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\nThis will make a backup of your xorg.conf file - just in case :) That being done, type:\ngksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nand under Section \"Device\" add the following line:\nOption \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\nSave and reboot. \nPerhaps this already does the trick.

I think this fix should also work on this computer model with other Debian-related Distros. \nAfter searching and trying everything in the web I found this page: \nKeybinding to change brightness by way of acpi brightness file?\nSo what I did to fix the problem was open /etc/default/grub with nano (or whatever text editor you may like):\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nAnd search the line that starts with: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"(something)\"\nI don't remember exactly what text it had on the quotes. And make it look like:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nThen update the grub with:\nsudo update-grub\n\nFinally, reboot and that's it!\nHope that helps :D\n", "Q: How do I stop Apache2 from automatically starting on boot? How do I stop Apache2 from automatically starting on boot? I can't seem to find an option that disables the automatic start-up when I turn on the machine.\n\nA: With systemd we can now use systemctl commands to prevent a service from automatically starting at boot.\nhere is an example:\nsudo systemctl disable apache2\n\nYou will still be able to start and stop the service but it won't start up at boot.\n\nA: Thought I'd just add to the answers by @gsullins and @tomodachi, for future readers who used the accepted answer.\nIf you've already used:\nsudo update-rc.d apache2 remove\n\nYou can use the argument defaults to add apache2 back into the autostart\nsudo update-rc.d apache2 defaults\n\nThen you're able to enable/disable\nsudo update-rc.d apache2 disable\nsudo update-rc.d apache2 enable\n\n\nA: you could simply disable it by:\nsudo update-rc.d apache2 disable\n\nand then if you would like to enable it again:\nsudo update-rc.d apache2 enable\n\ndepending on the project i am working on, it is  handy to have the service conveniently available, if i wish to re-enable it.\n\nA: On old,pre systemd distributions under /etc/init.d/ you will find all the init scripts for different boot up services, like apache2, networking, etc.\nDepending on which runlevel the computer starts in, different services are started.\nSo from the /etc/init.d/ folder each \"service\" is linked to one/many/no run level folders named from rc0.d to rc6.d.\nTo keep things simple there is a tool for removing/adding these links, hence removing or adding scripts to and from start up.\nTo disable apache2 simply type:\nsudo update-rc.d apache2 disable\n\nThis disables apache2 at startup but is not removed so it can be enabled again. To remove the apache2 startup scripts do the following:\nTo remove apache2 simply type:\nsudo update-rc.d -f  apache2 remove\n\n###Doing this will cause all runlevel folders that are linked to apache2 to be removed.\n", "Q: Grub rescue please help Like a dummy I deleted the Ubuntu partition on my hdd and restarted my computer.

Slick2d seems to be the best option for this, and they say it can be installed on Linux but the whole process to install it is way over my understanding. Can anyone here tell me how to install this on my computer?\n\nA: You don't necessarily have to \"install\" slick2d per se, it's mostly just a matter of including the files in your project, and setting it up to use them correctly.\nThe tricky thing about Slick2D is that it uses native libraries in order to use your video hardware - you have to tell java where to find the native libraries.  Take a look at the directory structure and the run script of my pet project:  https://bitbucket.org/willismichael/terra-incognita - It's mostly written in Clojure, but it should give you an idea of what you need.\nYou'll see that I have all of the java libraries (jars) directly inside the lib folder.  Also in that folder is another folder called native, which contains three folders: linux, macosx, and windows.  Each of these has the native libraries for the corresponding OS.  Then, in the root folder of the project I have run.bat for Windows users, and run.sh for Mac and Linux.\nIn run.sh, you'll see a parameter passed to java called -Djava.library.path that points to the folder with the native libraries.  You'll also notice that the classpath includes both slick.jar and lwjgl.jar, both of which are required to run a slick app.\nIf you only want to run on Linux, you don't even have to get as complicated as I did, all you have to do is include the linux natives, and hardwire your startup script to include them.\nIf you're lauching your project from an IDE like Eclipse or Netbeans or something, you'll have to figure out how to tell the IDE about the native libs.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS compatible with Dell 2950's through auto provisioning?

First, you have to boot with optin \"nomodeset\"; in other cases yo may get a black screen (see: My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?).\nAfter Installation has completed, there was no Gnome3 (always Fallback-mode). I installed \"Bumblebee\" - see here: http://bumblebee-project.org/; there is a discription for Ubuntu. After that, everything is fine; normally, Intel graphic is in use; to speed it up, i can use \"optirun\" and it get's much faster!\n", "Q: Prevent the guest account from accessing a particular flash usb pen drive key? My pen drive is very important to me. I have a 32GB one, with Ubuntu 12.04 on it.  On then pen drive, I created two partitions; one ext4 for Ubuntu (5GB) and the other partition is fat32, so that windows can access it too, with restrictions.\nWindows users without my permission can't see nor modify anything in my fat32 partition.\nHowever, when I boot from my pen drive and log in with guest account, I can see the fat32 partition and do whatever with it, delete it if i want.\nI just want to restrict access to that particular pen drive (only for the guest account). I also don't want to disable the guest account, because if somebody boots from my pen drive and just want to check mail or save an image from the Internet to their own pen drive, they need to be able to see/mount their pen drive.\n\nA: It is important to understand that these permissions are only enforced when the version of ubuntu on the pen drive is running. If I were to connect this pen drive to another computer I would be able to read any data on the pen drive, regardless of the permissions set in the file system.\nIf someone else has physical access to the pen drive, only encryption of the contents will give you any protection. (Note that this applies to a desktop computer too - if someone has physical access then they can remove the hard disk and examine its entire contents on another machine, or boot from their own USB stick - the operating system only enforces permissions on files when it is running).\nYou might want to look at a cross-platform encryption tool like TrueCrypt to store your data.\n\nA: Select contains of your drive. right click on it choose permissions.\nYou can remove or give permission for data to any user or you also for read, write or execution of your data.\n\nA: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/ubuntu-tiphow-to-disable-guest-account-in-ubuntu-12-04precise.html\nThe link allows you to disable the guest access feature in Ubuntu to such that you could prevent access. You are good to go now...\n", "Q: How to Disable External DNS recursion? I know that to disable recursive queries in BIND, I need add the following lines to the options section of /etc/bind/named.conf.options\nallow-transfer {\"none\";};\nallow-recursion {\"none\";};\nrecursion no;\n\nWill the above configuration disable all DNS recursive queries?\nHow can I disable DNS recursion only to external network queries and keep recursion only for Internal network?\nIf I disable the recursion, then what process will be performed by the BIND resolve the name request? Iterative or Inverse?\n\nA: You can enable recursion for some clients and disable recursion for others using views, but it is not recommended because you will lose some of the advantages of turning off recursion in the first place. You should use different nameservers for recursive resolution and authoritative service. (The two servers could run on the same machine if necessary.) Still, here's how to do it:\n// global options apply to external clients\noptions {\n    recursion no;\n    additional-from-auth no;\n    additional-from-cache no;\n};\n\nview \"local\" in {\n    // view options enable recursion only for local clients\n    match-clients { 172.16.45.80/23; 192.168.12.0/24; 127.0.0.1/8; ::1; };\n    recursion yes;\n    additional-from-auth yes;\n    additional-from-cache yes;\n\n    zone \".\" in {\n            type hint;\n            file \"/etc/bind/db.root\";\n    };\n\n    // put definitions for zones like \"localhost\" and \"127.in-addr.arpa\" here\n}\n\n// put definitions for real authoritative zones here.\n\nAs for the question in your last sentence, \"what process will be performed by the BIND resolve the name request? Iterative or Inverse?\", I do not understand the question. A nameserver configured not to offer recursive service will simply refuse to answer recursive queries.\n", "Q: How to install apt packages?

In particular I recommend Nautilus-Python.\nHere's a simple example that adds a context menu item for MIME type text/plain:\nfrom gi.repository import Nautilus, GObject\n\nclass ExampleMenuProvider(GObject.GObject, Nautilus.MenuProvider):\n    def activate(self, menu, files):\n        print 'activated' # do something\n\n    def get_file_items(self, window, files):\n        if len(files) != 1 or files[0].get_mime_type() != 'text/plain': return\n        item = Nautilus.MenuItem(\n            name='SimpleMenuExtension::Do_Something', label='Do Something')\n        item.connect('activate', self.activate, files)\n        return [item]\n\nYou'll need to install python-nautilus and gir1.2-gconf-2.0 packages and place the above Python script in ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/.\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't see my USB hard drive I have a 500 gb USB hard drive NTFS partitioned that worked till yesterday, but today it doesn't work at all.

But using both -r and -H options yields downloading all the website reachable from http://mysite.com/directory. Any idea?\n\nA: If you want to use wget, you can use the mirror setting to make an offline copy of a website, although some websites might prevent it with their robots.txt settings that stops automated spidering. I have always had a few problems with wget (see my other suggestion below), but the following command does work for many sites. However, be aware that the addition of the -H switch allows it to access all links that are on other sites and to save those also. This command switch can obviously be removed if it is not required.\n wget --wait 1 -x -H -mk http://site.to.mirror/\n\nThe command to wait allows some gaps between wget's requests so that the site is not overwhelmed, and the -x command switch specifies that the site's directory structure should be exactly mirrored in a folder in your home folder. The -m switch obviously stands for mirror mode, which allows wget to download recursively through the site; and the -k switch means that after download the files referenced will be those in your mirror directory in your home folder and not those back at the site itself. \nAfter man wget, perhaps the best listing and detailed explanation of wget commands is here.\nIf wget is unsuccessful and you can't grab as much as you want, I should try the command line program httrack or its web interface, webhttrack, which are available in the repositories. There are a large amount of options for this program, but it is better for downloading whole websites or parts of websites than wget. Webhttrack gives you a wizard to follow for downloading a site (it opens in your browser) as the screenshot below shows.\n\n\nA: Its been a while since I used wget for this purpose:\nI believe I had success with the - m flag.  \nwget -mk http://site.com/directory\n\nThis probably won't get everything - but it will get you close.\n(Reference): This page\n", "Q: Unable to Boot Live CD to resize disk partition I have a working version of 11.10 installed on VMware but I need to increase my disk space.\nI tried to boot from iso (on windows drive), but neither F2, F12 or ESC seem to work.

I can't remember having problems with this before. Moving windows etc is very slow, and I suspect this is because of the missing driver.\nIs there an easy way to install the driver for Radeon 2100 on Ubuntu 12.04?\n$ lspci -nn | grep VGA\n01:05.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Radeon 2100 [1002:796e]\n\n\n\nA: Znarkus,\nThe X2100 Series of Radeon cards are supported under the Legacy drivers of the Catalyst proprietary drivers and that may or may not be currently under development for Precise (not certain).  Would suspect that the previous versions of the drivers might work, however not certain that the current versions of the Catalyst drivers will work for the X2100 series which may be why they are not being shown as found. The Legacy versions may not be under development for Precise as an alternative either and may not be given as an option. A developer may know differently though.\nYour best bet may be to try to determine which version of the Catalyst Drivers was the last version to supply support for your card and try to install that driver manually from the source supplied by AMD. It is likely not to be as clean as a debian package from the sources though and would require reinstall every time the kernel is updated. \nAnother choice might be to buy a Video card, they are relatively inexpensive these days and you could get a slightly newer card that would have a driver available. Just another option though.\nGood luck, hope this does help.\n\nA: \nATI/AMD dropped Catalyst support for these cards in Catalyst 9-4. These cards are supported with the legacy ATI 9-3 Catalyst release, but you MUST use a kernel <= 2.6.28 and Xserver <= 1.5. For example, you can use Catalyst 9-3 if you're running Ubuntu 8.04 or Debian Lenny/5.0. Open source support is good and 3D is still improving.\n\n(source)\nYou cannot use any driver other than the open source driver in 12.04 since you cannot use a lower version of the kernel just for drivers purpose. The legacy drivers supplied by AMD will also no work with this card.\n\nA: I have the Radeon 2100 built into my Acer Aspire motherboard.  I've been running Debian and since Ubuntu is based on Debian, you probably should install the firmware-linux-nonfree package.  It has the firmware needed by both the Radeon 2100 and the free x.org driver.  The dmesg command shows that its looking for firmware RS690_cp.bin which is part of the package.  You must have the firmware for GPU acceleration.  I've tried the Catalyst drivers and they will not work.  When I ran the Debian Wheezy net install, it downloaded and installed the free drivers but not the firmware.  I got the message that no 3D effects were available until I got the firmware.\n", "Q: DisplayLink Display nearly working on 10.10 Here's what they look like at the moment.

I've seen other posts where people have gotten it to work after editting their xorg.conf, but I can't seem to find that either.\n\nA: I played around with using DisplayLink under Linux and encountered problems related to the fact that Linux is still not very good at supporting multiple display adapters (unlike Windows) which, in my case, meant that my NVIDIA drivers won't work at the same time as the DisplayLink or fbdev drivers.\nIf you just want to try out the DisplayLInk (or multiple DisplayLinks) take a look at this, for example.\nGood Luck.\n", "Q: Create partition for Windows 7 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I install Windows 7 after I've installed Ubuntu? \n\nI have a full ubuntu installation on my hard drive.

Then put your windows disc in and go through a custom install. There will be an option to create your new NTFS partition there in the empty space.\nJust be aware that windows will wipe out your boot info for Ubuntu so you will have to stick a ubuntu live disc in after installing windows 7 and repair your grub loader as per the instructions at here or here\n", "Q: High CPU load during flash playback I got a CPU load indicator applet and whenever I play a flash vid I see it going through the roof and staying high.

If the program you're looking to install has one available, you should favor it over the 32-bit version, unless there are any known issues that technologically prevent you from using it (ie - it crashes on startup). 64-bit software is better equipped to leverage your hardware than 32-bit is, making it more efficient overall (and potentially allows the developers to add in features that weren't possible in the 32-bit version).\n", "Q: HDD partition help I have 4 OS's on my dual boot system: backtrack 5, Windows 7, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Lubuntu.

As an example : \n\n\nI'm not talking about changing shortcuts. some of these function keys (common keys like Home, email, etc..) are known in Ubuntu. for example ubuntu known FN + F1 as HomePage, but some special function keys like [in my case] Flip, Show Desktop and other functions that designed for windows, known as combination of Super with another key. for example ubuntu known [in my case] FN + F6, that represent show desktop, as Super + D.\nThe question is \"How could I define them in ubuntu as a new key?\" Is it possible?\n\nP.S:\n\n\n*\n\n*I read related questions and their answers, but I didn't get my\nanswer.\n\n*I emphasize that I'm not talking about keyboard shortcuts\nand I'm actually talking about defining a new keyboard key type\n\n*And sorry for my bad english xD\n\n\nA: From what I understand, to put it in simple words, you want to create a custom key (be it a combination of keys).\nIf that's the case and you are using Ubuntu Precise go to SYSTEM SETTINGS then KEYBOARD and then hit the SHORTCUTS tab. \nIf the feature you want isn't in the list just go to the bottom on the list on the left hand side and click CUSTOM SHORTCUTS.\nYou can then click the little + symbol at the bottom of the screen to add a new custom shortcut. Then type in the Shortcut name followed by the command to invoke it (really depends and what you want to do).

Towards the right it will have the word DISABLED. click on the word DISABLED and then click the key or combination of keys you want to use to activate this shortcut (the command) you created.\n\nfor example: if I want to create a key shortcut to open www.google.com in the browser and want to call the shortcut CHROME. I\n  then want it to run when I hit CTRL + W, I would do the following in\n  the SYSTEM SETTINGS > KEYBOARD > SHORTCUTS section\nNAME: CHROME\nCOMMAND: chromium-browser http://www.google.com\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*I would then hit the OK button\n  \n*Then, I would click on the word DISABLED that appears the right\n  of the shortcut named CHROME\n  \n*After clicking on the word DISABLED I would hit CTRL and W\n  key together.\n\nYou can use the SUPER key or any key on your keyboard.

In most environments the bootstrap will actually spin up a machine, when you're working with a local deployment it just creates the first LXC container and sets up networking. So this typically takes 10-20 seconds. The magic happens on the first deployment, as explained in this local configuration question, this is when Juju downloads ~300MB server image and creates the \"master container\" which all future deployments are based on.\nNow, the error your receiving appears to state that there's a timeout trying to reach the Juju Charm store. I wasn't aware of any outages, but it might be because you're behind a proxy or some other kind of networking issue/timeout. I'd recommend trying again (juju destroy-environment -e local) then re-bootstrap.\nIf you're having proxy issues, you can download charms locally using Bazaar:\nmkdir -p ~/charms/precise\ncd ~/charms/precise\nbzr branch lp:charms/mysql\njuju deploy --repository=~/charms local:mysql\n\nWhile the directory can be anything, the important item to follow is each charm needs to be in a series folder (following the Ubuntu release names). Outside of that you use --repository which instructs Juju to search here for charms, and the local: prefix tells Juju that the deployment will be from that local --repository path.\n", "Q: How I do remove windows? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to I remove windows but keep Ubuntu? \n\nI have installed Ubuntu onto my laptop and I am happy!

I prefer having it sit in the launcher for easy access, however, every time I start a new session (that is, logging in or booting up), the Word launcher has disappeared.\nCould this be a bug or am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: The problem is that the .desktop file is NOT in a standard directory.  Launcher favorites need to be in either the /usr/share/applications directory or the ~/.local/share/applications folder (and NOT a subdirectory as my wine .desktop files are).  Copy the .desktop file there and then drag it to the launcher to lock it there.\nThe other option is to set the full path to the launcher using gsettings, but that's a pain.\nEDIT on further investigation, when I add the desktop file for Word on my system (residing in ~/.local/share/applications/wine/Programs/Microsoft Office/), its name is added in gsettings with - instead of / for its location. Doing the following with gsettings to correct it made it permanent for me:\ngsettings get  com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites > myfavs.txt\n\nEdit myfavs.txt to replace - with /:\n['nautilus-home.desktop', .... , 'wine-Programs-Microsoft Office-Microsoft Office Word 2007.desktop']\n\nbecomes:\n['nautilus-home.desktop', .... , 'wine/Programs/Microsoft Office/Microsoft Office Word 2007.desktop']\n\nThen set it:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites \"`cat myfavs.txt`\"\n\nI filed a bug report here so that one shouldn't have to do this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1033577\n\nA: You are not doing anything wrong. That is just how wine is build.\nTo have Word 2007 in you launcher at all times, you can create a .desktop file that starts Word and drag it in your launcher. However this has the distinct disadvantage, that while Word is running to icons for it will sit in your launcher.\nThe desktop file could look like this (I don't use wine so not tested):\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Word 2007\nComment=Open Word 2007\nExec=wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/word.exe\nIcon=network\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nCategories=GNOME;\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;Unity;\nX-GNOME-Keywords=Applications;WinWord;\nName[en_US]=Word 2007\n\nOf course in this line\nExec=wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/word.exe\n\nyou need to replace the path with the real path to your word executable (which will most likely be in $HOME/.wine/).\nIt's not perfect, but the best I can do.\n\nA: You could use the procedure I used in this post: How do I set a wine program (ex.

Ive already installed Nautilus and I can mount both my Internal and external memories on my Ubuntu PC, but I couldn't find how to use my Samsung as Modem. Is it possible? \nBTW, my most sincerest despite to Samsung for not including drivers for free software. \n\nA: Yes. Just enable USB tethering on your phone and Ubuntu will see an USB ethernet device on which your phone will provide an address on (DHCP). Don't use the USB-modem approach, that's much harder.\nSee this video on how to enable it on your phone.\n\nA: That depends on where you bought it.

In Ubuntu 20.04 and later running sudo apt upgrade not only upgrades the versions of the proprietary graphics drivers that were installed by sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall. Sometimes sudo apt upgrade even upgrades the proprietary graphics driver packages to more recent packages, in which case sudo apt autoremove removes the older packages which were replaced by the newer ones. For most users there's no reason to guess about which proprietary graphics driver to install, because if your system deserves a graphics driver upgrade it will get one.\n\nA: [recommended] is recommended  \nGenerally, recommended is the best course of action.  \nIf you have a specific bug, file a bug.  \n[recommended] is targeted to work for the largest number of users with recent hardware.

I am trying to play a browser based game on Chrome. My system runs Ubuntu fine and is a new laptop. The game gets choppy when I play. How do I allocate a little more memory to Chrome so I have some more browser-power to play this game?\n\nA: Unless you've explicitly ulimited Chrome, the Linux kernel gives a process as much memory as it demands (up to the limit of virtual memory available). And Chromium will eat up gigabytes of memory if you have enough tabs open.\nIf you have a small amount of RAM (no more than a few gigabytes), you could add more, but realistically a single browser game shouldn't be eating up that much.\nOtherwise, there's nothing you can do to allocate more memory to it, other than patching the Chromium codebase to use more memory :).\nIn short, I doubt lack of memory is the reason for choppiness (it's probably CPU-bound, or GPU-bound if the game uses WebGL). But fixing that is a different question.\n", "Q: Trouble mounting an sd card While attempting to mount and sdcard from /dev/sda/\nmount /dev/sda /media\n\nI get an error\nVFS: Can't find ext4 filesystem mount: you must specify the filesystem type\n\nany ideas?\n\nA: Firstly use fdisk to check the disk type\nfdisk -l\n\nUse the information from there as the fs type parameter to mount, \nmount -t FSTYPE /dev/sdX DIR\n\nwhere FSTYPE is the file system type reported by fdisk, and DIR is the mount point, ie where you want to mount the sd card too. \nAdditional options to mount can be checked using \nman mount \n\nor from here \nAs an alternative to mount you might also consider pmount which can be used by non-root users.

I'm on a Toshiba Satellite A665-s6050 if it matters, Windows 7 64-bit, 500GB HDD.\nI partitioned 80GB of free space to install Ubuntu in. Struggled with the manual partitioner since the auto install thing wasn't showing up.

Did I limit Ubuntu to 80GB or did I only limit Windows 7?\nI'm thoroughly confused, it did not go as smoothly as it has when I've done clean installs of Ubuntu before on other computers. This was my first dual boot and it was a pain.\n\nA: Congratulations on taking the time to try Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you selected 'install alongside other operating system', the installer may have  automatically resized the Windows C: partition and used that space. Sounds like it allocated 80 GB for Ubuntu. \n\n*I would recommend installing gparted  on Ubuntu to see how your hard drive got partitioned. (Note that if you try to perform operations on your Ubuntu partition while running Ubuntu from that partition, you'll probably run into errors.)\n\n*Ubuntu can see your Windows partitions without a problem, but Windows can't see your Ubuntu (GNU/Linux) partitions. This is because of the way filesystems work: each partition has a table of information about files, including where the actual file data is on a hard disk. There are different types of formats for storing this information, hence the term filesystem types. Windows (by default) stores data in the NTFS filesystem, whereas Ubuntu stores data in the ext4 filesystem (by default). The problem arises because while Ubuntu has software that tells it how to read NTFS filesystems, Windows doesn't have the equivalent software for ext4. Because of this, Ubuntu can read Windows filesystems, but not the other way around. I think there might be third-party programs for Windows to see Ubuntu partitions; try Googling \"read ext4 on windows\".\n\n*You should be careful with dual-boot. If something goes wrong with Windows it can be a pain to make the bootloader work again for someone still getting the hang of Ubuntu. Ubuntu is definately worth the trouble in the long run though.\n\nA: What happened is that the Ubuntu installer did not touch the 78+2 GB space you created by yourself. The installed chopped off new space from the C: drive.\nWhat you should have done is to select the \"Install alongside other operating system\" option from the start.\nWhy did the initial installation fail? I guess the boot loader was not installed by some reason; did you try to install using a USB stick (instead of a CDROM)? If so, the bootloader might got installed on the USB stick which is not good. It should have been installed on the MBR of the C: drive.\nHow can you reclaim the 78+2GB space? There are several ways. You need to provide an image of your partition layout (a screenshot) from the Disk Utility program. Ask a new question about putting the space back.\n\nA: This is normal. Ubuntu can safely read and write partitions made by Windows(using either the FAT or the NTFS file systems). This is normal. Ubuntu isn't made to create a forty-foot wall between it and Windows. It is made to be flexible, and many users find it useful to be ale to access their Windows files. Do not worry.\n\nA: everything is right with your installation, only there could be an unused partition , which could be the leftover of your previous ubuntu installation.  you can format it but very carefully, if the grub resides there , you will not be able to boot to any os if it is deleted .  \n", "Q: How can I make a .deb file from a bash script? \nPossible Duplicate:\ncreate a .deb Package from scripts or binaries \n\nI've made a bash script and stored it in /usr/local/bin.

How can I get this done?\n\nA: You would need to make a package from scratch using the packaging guide to create the package.  You'd have to make sure the package is compliant with Lintian as well, all this is outlined in that guide.

I can't boot my laptop by any normal means following this mistake, and I'm looking for a way to revert the effects of it.\nIn order to tackle this problem I started my computer on recovery mode and switched to console as root. My original idea was to change the owner of /usr ( and all files under it ) back to root. I tried :\nchown --recursive root /usr\nchown -hR root /usr\n\nSadly this results on all folders under the usr saying Read-only file system, a sample line would be :\nchown : changing the ownership of '/usr/bin/...' : Read-only file system\n\nI'm not sure whether there has been no change at all, or I shouldn't refer to root as 'root' on the above line.\nBesides this, I have tried a few other things that I found here and there but I was unable to revert the effects of my mistake.\nI would be grateful if anyone can point me towards any solution. It would also be very kind of you to mention why it was so wrong to change the owner of the contents under usr, considering that I'm the only user in this operating system.\nThanks in advance for your time.\n\nA: In recovery mode the root partition has been mounted read-only. \nEither remedy this (from recovery mode, after booting), by using \nmount -o rw,remount /\n\nOr alternatively the easiest way to fix this may be to boot from a live cd/usb and mount the drives.\nEither way once you've succeeded in mounting / in rw-mode, you can change the ownership as you already attempted.\nAlso don't forget to change the group too: \nchown -hR root:root /usr \n\n", "Q: How can I backup my system to an USB stick?

In this case is dd a good option?\n\nA: \nSBackup is a simple backup solution intended for desktop use. It can\n  backup any subset of files and directories. Exclusions can be defined\n  by regular expressions. A maximum individual file size limit can be\n  defined. Backups may be saved to any local and remote directories that\n  are supported by gnome-vfs.

When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo apt-get install sbackup\n\n1Source:Debian Admin\nBased on the new information that you supplied, you can use Remastersys.  Remastersys will backup your install to ISO.  Then you can use the outcome to make a Live CD/USB which can be used to install the backup to disk.\nOr you can use dd to clone the original disk to USB stick but you need a big enough USB drive so the backup will fit.\nAnother option is to use Clonezilla.

Ran find under maverick with proprietary driver. Upgraded to 12.04, where nvidia was replaced with nouveau. Suspend worked initially, hibernation did not. However, suspend with an external monitor connected did lead to the black screen upon resume. So I thought nvidia current was a good idea. To no avail. Get the same black screen, but now even when I resume from suspend without external monitors. nvidiacurrent (302.17) leads to unstable behavior, first small parts of the frame flash, after a few minutes the screen goes black, then immediately white, and slowly a black pixel structure emerges from the top and bottom of the screen.

The live CD loaded fine, and I choose custom install. I made 2 primary partitions for Root(/) and Boot(/boot) and a logical partition for the swap space. I'm pretty sure I installed GRUB into the external drive. I then booted into windows 7 and configured the rest of the space left on the drive as an NTFS partition to later backup my Windows 7. \nHowever, when I tried to boot Ubuntu from the external drive I got a black screen with green lines going down. In the green lines were (what looked like) percentage signs. I assume this is fairly rare because its never happened to me before. My computer wouldn't do anything from there, and I had to force shut-down. This happened twice, and then I went back to Windows. The NTFS partition still works fine, so I doubt its the drive. \nDoes anyone know what I can do to fix this or what mistakes I may have made during installation? Any help would be appreciated.\nThanks\nEdit: I got it so that the screwed up screen is gone but now it's just a blank black screen and no boot. Also, I tried using the GRUB menu, but it doesn't seem to want to come up no matter what I do or what keys I press. Could it be a problem with the location GRUB is installed to?\n\nA: I don't know about the percentage signs pops up in your screen, but I had a graphic issue when I tried to install Ubuntu 12.04 on Dell Inspiron 1501 from USB-thumb drive.  As soon as I booted in Ubuntu12.04, I got green, yellow, and red lines going down.\nI solved it by using the nomodeset kernel boot option.\nSince you have installed Ubuntu on your external drive you might try fixing your problem as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to your external drive.\n\n*Hold down Shift to get to the GRUB menu.\n\n*Press e when GNU GRUB pops up.\n\n*Delete quiet splash and type nomodeset in its plac.\n\n\nPress Ctrl+X and see if Ubuntu boots normally without any graphic issue.\nThe above is a temporary fix. It won't carry over, the next time you boot. To make it permanent, so it works every time you boot:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), run gksu gedit /etc/default/grub. This opens GRUB's main configuration file in a graphical text editor.\n\n*In the editor, find the line that starts with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.\n\n*On that line, delete quiet splash and add nomodeset.\n\n*Press Ctrl+S to save the file, then quit the text editor.\n\n*Back in the Terminal, run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nHope it fix your problem.

This is a continuous process and I can't connect to the internet.\n\nA: I can think of two things that could cause this. This could happen if the network password is entered incorrectly. Enable the show password option and double check that the password is correct. Also make sure you have the right security method selected. In most cases it is \"WPA & WPA Personal\" but in some cases it could be another option. Check your router WiFi settings or the connection information on another machine that is successfully connected. \nAlso if you are using WEP pass phrase or WEP hex make sure you enter the password in correct format.

I was using destroy() to close it..\nThen i tried to use show() method, but i can get a return value from using \nid = dialog.show()\n\nhow can i get the return id?\nAlso, how can i get the text from some Entry in the dialog from the main code?\n\nA: I found this stackoverflow post, which leads to the documentation on the run function of a GtkDialog, where it states:\n\nThe run() method blocks in a recursive main loop until the dialog\n  either emits the \"response\" signal, or is destroyed. If the dialog is\n  destroyed, the run() method returns gtk.RESPONSE_NONE; otherwise, it\n  returns the response ID from the \"response\" signal emission. Before\n  entering the recursive main loop, the run() method calls the\n  gtk.Widget.show() on the dialog for you. Note that you still need to\n  show any children of the dialog yourself.\nDuring the run() method, the default behavior of \"delete_event\" is\n  disabled; if the dialog receives a \"delete_event\", it will not be\n  destroyed as windows usually are, and the run() method will return\n  gtk.RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT. Also, during the run() method the dialog\n  will be modal. You can force the run() method to return at any time by\n  calling response() to emit the \"response\" signal. Destroying the\n  dialog during the run() method is a very bad idea, because your\n  post-run code won't know whether the dialog was destroyed or not.\nAfter the run() method returns, you are responsible for hiding or\n  destroying the dialog as needed.\n\nAnd also from the PyGTK 3 tutorial:\n\nFinally, there are two ways to remove a dialog. The Gtk.Widget.hide()\n  method removes the dialog from view, however keeps it stored in\n  memory. This is useful to prevent having to construct the dialog again\n  if it needs to be accessed at a later time. Alternatively, the\n  Gtk.Widget.destroy() method can be used to delete the dialog from\n  memory once it is no longer needed. It should be noted that if the\n  dialog needs to be accessed after it has been destroyed, it will need\n  to be constructed again otherwise the dialog window will be empty.\n\nSo following on from those bits of information, if you call the hide function of the dialog before it receives the delete event, it will not be destroyed and you can keep calling run, to bring the dialog to focus.\ne.g.\ndef on_mnu_test_dialog_activate(self, widget, data=None):\n    result = self.TestDialog.run()\n    if result == Gtk.ResponseType.OK:\n        print \"The OK button was clicked\"\n    self.TestDialog.hide()\n\nAlso, just to answer your second question.\nIn my example I have imported the class for the dialog:\nfrom dialog_show.TestDialog import TestDialog\n\nThen in the finish_initializing function, I created an instance variable for the dialog:\nself.TestDialog = TestDialog()\n\nI can then access a properties like so:\nself.TestDialog.ui.txt_entry1.get_text()\n\nor, as suggested by John,\nself.TestDialog.builder.get_object(\"txt_entry1\").get_text()\n\n\nA: The project I work on figures out the ui filename and rebuilds the dialog box every time. It shows it and finishes by calling gtk.main(). \nVarious controls are given names in glade-gtk2 and glade-gtk2 is also used to define the cancel and ok buttons.

When I upgraded to 12.04 gnome-panel, it lost this functionality and I was forced to  map F1 to raise a window. Now I am auditing Unity. I have disabled click-to-raise and auto-raise behavior as I would rather have control over which windows are raised when.\nI am not aware of a way to map the mouse thusly, but I would be happy to hear that it is possible.\n\nA: I have more or less solved the problem. It's not ideal but it works. In CompizConfig Settings, General Options -> Key Bindings, there are two settings for \"Raise Window\", mouse and keyboard controls. I set the mouse control to Super+Button1, which does not conflict with Alt+Button1 in the \"Move Window\" options. I also set \"Lower Window\" to Super+Button2, for orthogonal operating with clicking the title bar.\nAlthough this does not combine raise+lower like I am used to, it allows me to access raise/lower while using the mouse, so it's good enough for my purposes.\n\nA: The conventional way to move a window with Linux (Gnome?) is to use Alt+Left-click.  This has been fairly standard for as long as I remember.  Alt+Middle-click resizes.\nI just tried it with 12.04 Unity, and it didn't work with a standard install (in a VM for testing), but alt+middle-click still works to resize.\nThere is a \"move window mode\" entered by the shortcut combo Alt+F7, which is not nearly as convenient, but will work in a pinch.\n", "Q: java uses 100% CPU and cannot be stopped I've encountered that the java-process is\n\n\n*\n\n*started without any reasing (while no java-application should be run) and\n\n*after a while uses 100% of the CPU (AMD Phenom II X4)\n\n\nI kill it with the gnome system monitor.

It usually does not show anything unless you started it in background. See help jobs.\nYou can check if there are any other java processes running with:\nps aux | grep java\n\nThis searchs for any running process which has the string \"java\" on its command line execution, including grep. You can eliminate grep using ps aux | grep java | grep -v grep, if you want.\nAlso, when a process is eating a lot of CPU, you usually can spot it using the program top, pressing P to order by %CPU:\n\nYou can also use M to sort by memory usage, and use the keys < and > to change the current field used to sort.\nNow, WHY a process is taking much CPU is a really hard question to answer in a generic way. It may be doing useful stuff or it may be just stuck on an infinite loop, usually only by reading the source code you could find out which. If you were to consider the Java JRE that runs the Java plugins in your browser, its CPU load is highly dependant on the nature of the program you are running.\n", "Q: Finding and editing gnome terminal colors without gui I like the color scheme editor for the gnome terminal and all, but I hate not being able to work with color values, whether it be hexidecimal or some other form.

Also look at the connector pins. If that fails you might try borrowing another from someone else.\nThere are contacts in the cable that connect the monitor to the video of your computer that communicate digitally EDID information. That information tells the operating system what constraints the monitor has on how fast it can refresh horizontally and vertically, how fast bit data can be clocked to it, and so on. It also suggests a good resolution it can handle well. It is sent in several blocks.\nIf a pin has been bent in a connector, or a wire has busted that information may not make it and the video drivers will only do very conservative resolutions.\nYou may find additional information in /var/log/Xorg.0.log looking for the string \"EDID\".\n", "Q: How do I install/upgrade to KDE 4.9?

(dpkg/gdebi and other .deb level tools will try to install a package where dependencies are unmet, leaving it in the half-installed \"unconfigured\" state, which apt considers to be broken. apt, software center, synaptic, and other high-level package management will usually catch these errors from reading the dependencies before installing the package and stop you before you break things, unless the error happens late in the installation, such as what happens when a package in the repository is broken and tries to write files owned by another package)\nSo long as the packages causing the error are not system critical and can be removed without causing a huge cascade of dependency problems, the quickest way to resolve an error like that that apt-get can't resolve on it's own is to back the offending packages out until apt-get -f install is able to take care of the problem, then apt-get update, apt-get upgrade, and finally try what you were doing again through apt-get.\nIn your case, I'd start by backing out  libcupsimage2:i386  ia32-libs-multiarch:i386 and skype:\napt-get remove libcupsimage2:i386  ia32-libs-multiarch:i386 ia32-libs skype\n\nIf the situation is more complex, and creates huge cascades of failed dependencies, then the alternative is to figure out from the dependency messages what went wrong and try to specify a solution by naming the packages necessary to resolve the dependency problem. Usually these sort of situations arise from mixing packages from multiple repositories such as backports or PPAs, and you solve them by specifying a particular version of a package that wouldn't normally be considered by apt because of pinning, or by explicitly telling apt-get to go back to versions in the official repository (apt-get will not downgrade a package to solve a broken situation unless explicitly told to do so - so if you installed a newer version of a library by hand, and packages on the system have a dependency on the specific version, you have to update one or downgrade the other until the dependency mess is resolved.)\n\nA: To remove the mismatched Package or half installed package that creates problem with dependencies. Try\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThis will remove mismatched package. After that, you will able to reinstall package.\n", "Q: how to access the windows program installed uisng wine?

When joining Ubuntu Community I found Brainstorm not only a wonderful idea but great in execution to.\nNow after watching the site for 3 releases I wonder if its only fluff that's shown to new users. Maybe to get them excited about Ubuntu?\n\n\n*\n\n*Do developers pay much attention to Brainstorm?\n\n*How many votes in the positive does an idea require before being seriously looked at?\n     (Some ideas have tens, close to hundred(s) and they are still not moved to the        upstream development area)\n\nA: In addition to tijybba's excellent answer, it really comes down to pure numbers. It takes a few minutes to come up with an idea, it takes weeks, months, or sometimes even years to implement.\nGive the average linux user 10 minutes to come up with 10 ideas and they will likely generate years and years of engineering work, which is why we can just write them down so if new developers come around they have something to work on. \nAlso a bunch of ideas do get solved, they might just not be marked off on Brainstorm or they're merely bugs or improvements that are just not implemented yet. Let's look at some examples from the most popular ideas from the last 6 months.\n\n\n*\n\n*Display downloading speed software center: just needs to be implemented, that's just a feature request.\n\n*The shutdown screen is very outdated: Everyone knows that already, someone just needs to do the work.\n\n*KDE native application should be marked in Software Center: just needs to be implemented.\n\n*update-manager should choose automatically a mirror to update in case of failure: Actually the update-manager already supports the mirror:// method, it just hasn't been tested enough to be turned on by default.\n\n*Magnet links should be supported in Ubuntu download page: Someone just needs to implement that.\n\n*The family may use Ubuntu - which is basically \"making users sucks\", no argument from me there!\n\n*Inexperienced users don't know when/how to safely unplug removable drives - that's a problem in every operating system.\n\n*Be able to create a hot-spot in network-manager- We already do that!\n\n*unnecessary complicated system boot menu - doesn't really matter because we hide the menu by default and only advanced users go in there anyway. \n\n\nNow, some of these are good ideas, some are really just bug reports. \nIt's best to think as Brainstorm as a place for people to put ideas down so when a new developer wants to work on something they have a place to look at ideas, it's not a place to put a TODO list for existing Ubuntu developers mostly because they are a finite number and most of them are busy getting the OS out the door to users. \nAlso many of the pain points that users put down there are known problems. The guy who writes the shutdown dialog probably doesn't need to know it's old and crappy, he deals with it every day! Or my personal favorite: Speed up the file managers\nIt's just a matter of time to get things like that implemented, it's not as if the Nautilus developers intentionally made the file manager slow. \n\n\n*\n\n*TL;DR: Unlimited ideas, limited people to do the work.\n\n\nA: First of all it is not necessary that Most popular or Most voted ideas should get Implemented by the Ubuntu Developers team.\nI mean if anyone is so Inclined towards bringing it in Ubuntu , then there exists other way using Launchpad PPA  where you can Build your Idea and Implement in more Customizable form.\nFrom Ubuntu brainstorm Wiki page\n\nUbuntu brainstorm provides a simple way for anyone to contribute ideas\nfor improving Ubuntu. Ideas are voted on by the user community and the\nmost popular ideas are brought to the attention of the development\nteams\n\nFrom idea to feature\nThere are several routes from idea to implementation:\n\n*\n\n*The idea submitter implements by themself, and contributes the package or patch to Ubuntu.\n\n*The idea generates interest, and several volunteers form a new project to blueprint and implement the idea.\n\n*The idea attracts interest from the appropriate Ubuntu Teams, which form a working group or schedule a UDS Session to blueprint and milestone the idea.\n\n*The idea concept influences another forum, and is implemented by an unrelated group.\n\nUbuntu blueprints\nFor complex changes, write a 'blueprint' based on the result of the Brainstorm idea.\n\n*\n\n*A blueprint is a feature design document. It is used to describe a proposed feature in enough detail for a developer to implement it (not quite the same as a specification, though that term is often used).\n\n*Anyone can start a blueprint though some software design or\ndevelopment experience would be useful. After a first draft has been\ncomposed the blueprint is typically discussed on an appropriate team\nor project mailing list, forum thread, or at a development meeting\nlike UDS.\n\nFor example  Here are the ideas about Ubuntu that are currently being implemented for the Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal release.\nFrom my point of View,\nBrainstorm is Platform to improve and contribute in innovative way to Ubuntu which includes bringing attention of Developers Team towards your Idea .\nAlternatively bringing other proposed ideas or own ideas to life by developing and implementing it using PPA, if it found more useful then it may get ended up in Official Ubuntu Repositories bringing more interested Developers and volunteers to develop and maintain it.\n", "Q: 'Important security update' for Firefox and flash plugin, but the update cannot be selected [This question has been updated as I now have the same problem with Firefox in addition to flash plugin]\nThe update manager (on Ubuntu 12.04, 64bit) shows an 'important security update' for flashplugin-installer:i386, firefox, and firefox-globalmenu.

Actually the flashplugin-installer package does not appear to be installed on my computer (judging from the Software Centre).

And the difference between this and the previous command is that it will upgrade all your upgradeable packages.\nEDIT:\nOk I just noticed that you said you have Ubuntu x64 and not 32, so you don't have to install the flashplugin-installer:i386 package as this is the 32bit version. Instead you can install flashplugin-installer, which will download the 64bit version.\nFirst let's remove flashplugin-installer:i386 in case it was previously installed; This will remove the package in case it was installed. If it wasn't installed, then it will print this message:\n\nPackage flashplugin-installer:i386 is not installed, so not removed\n\nsudo apt-get remove flashplugin-installer:i386\n\nThis step is optional, it will remove all installed and unused packages (Which are usually dependencies for previously installed then removed packages, like in this case).

In Windows there's an option to view extensions for known file types.  When I enable that option I see all the files with their respective extension; for example an mp3 music file is:  name.mp3\nIf I rename it to name.txt, then the default program to view the file would be text editor.\nHow do I rename a file's extension in Ubuntu?\nI want to create the file: autorun.inf\nIn Windows I just create a new text document .txt (enable the view of extensions) and rename it to .inf, but in Ubuntu that doesn't work.\nSo how can I do that in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Forget about the concept of \"file extensions\" that thing is completely made up and useless. For example somebody could rename a music file on your system to garbage.gbr and since windows interprets extensions literally as file types it wouldn't even know that the file was a music file. \nIn Ubuntu on the other hand, you can name a file whatever you wish. You don't even have to choose an extension if you don't feel like it. Ubuntu will read the MIME type of the file and understand what type it is. Based on the file type it will associate it to the appropriate program to open it. You still have all the control you need. You can change the default program associated with a MIME type in several ways. \n\nTo change default program association of a file type, just right click on a file with that type and choose Properties and go to Open With tab. \nNow that being said, I should mention that extensions are not completely useless in Ubuntu. They still provide a standard way to tag a file for easy identification of its type -- but they don't set the file type. The only exception to this is when saving a file in some applications that support saving in several different formats. When you provide a file name in those application it can read the extension you provided and based on that decides how to create and save your new file with the correct mime type. For example if you open a JPEG file in GIMP and then choose save as ... and enter image.png, GIMP opens the PNG file dialogue and lets you save the file with PNG MIME Type. \n\nA: You rename it just as in Windows -- by changing the \"extension\", i.e. the part of the filename after the last .\nTo create autorun.inf, just right-click in Nautilus and click on \"Create Document...Empty Document\", and name it autorun.inf.

I am quite new to Ubuntu and still learning the ropes.\nHere's my script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#fetch start time of uut\ngrep -i \"01_node_setup\" his_file | tail -1 >> /home/xtee/sst-logs.out\n\n#check if sysconfig.out exists\nif [ -f sysconfig.out];\nthen\n    grep -A 1 \"Drive Model\" sysconfig.out | tail -1 >> /home/xtee/sst-logs.out\nelse\n    grep -m 1 \"Pair0 DIMM0\" node0/trans_file_prev/*setupsys* | tail -1 >> /home/xtee/sst-logs.out\nfi\n\nBasically I want to run this script to execute on all the existing sub directories of a certain directory. What do I do? Thanks!\n\nA: You can iterate subdirs with a for-loop like this\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nfor dir in /the/path/*/; do\n    awk 'tolower($0) ~ /01_node_setup/{line=$0} END{print line}' \"$dir/his_file\"\n\n    if [[ -f \"$dir/sysconfig.out\" ]]; then\n        awk '/Drive Model/{getline line} END{print line}' \"$dir/sysconfig.out\"\n    else\n        awk '/Pair0 DIMM0/{print;exit}' \"$dir/node0/trans_file_prev\"/*setupsys*\n    fi\ndone >> /home/xtee/sst-logs.out\n\nI changed your greps into awks that should be more portable. I believe they should produce the same output. The important parts are the quotes around the paths.\n\nA: An easier, though less elegant, way to iterate subdirectories is this:\nbase=\"/something\"\n\niterator() {\n  local dir=\"$1\"\n  local i=\n  for i in \"$dir\"/*; do\n    if [[ -d \"$i\" ]]; then\n      iterator \"$dir/$i\"\n    else\n      # do something with this file\n    fi\n  done\n}\n\niterator \"$base\"\n\n\nA: This should more or less do the trick. I am assuming that the 'node0' dir will be within the subdirectories if 'sysconfig.out' is not and that 'his_file' is also in the subdirectories.\n#!/bin/bash\nMainDir=/path/to/dir/containing/subdirs\n# cd into dir\ncd $MainDir\n\nfor dir in *; do\n\n#fetch start time of uut\ngrep -i \"01_node_setup\" $dir/his_file | tail -1 >> /home/xtee/sst-logs.out\n\n#check if sysconfig.out exists\nif [ -f $dir/sysconfig.out];\nthen\n    grep -A 1 \"Drive Model\" $dir/sysconfig.out | tail -1 >> /home/xtee/sst-logs.out\nelse\n    grep -m 1 \"Pair0 DIMM0\" $dir/node0/trans_file_prev/*setupsys* | tail -1 >> /home/xtee/sst-logs.out\nfi\n\ndone\n\n#cd back to where we started\ncd $OLDPWD\n\n", "Q: How do I update a third party app that does not have root permission I installed IntelliJ Idea using Ubuntu Software Centre, but now Idea's build-in update manager notifies me that there is an update available, but the app does not have the permission to update it.\nIf I click ok to Idea's build in update manager, then the update downloads, but I get an error: \"There are some confilecs found in the installation\".\nLooking at the detail, you can see that it's trying to install a whole bunch of jar files, but that it results in \"access denied\" failures.\nI can update the app as root, using sudo idea.sh, but then it only update's the version started as root, so when I run the app as my local user again, then it's back at the old version.\nIs there a way to run an app as local user, but at the same time give it root permission? This should solve the problem?\n\nA: If you installed a program via the systems package manager (i.e. Software-Center, aptitude, apt-get, dpkg...), you shouldn't use this programs internal update mechanism to update this software (I even wonder why this is not deactivated, as it is done e.g. for Firefox). If there's a new version, you have about 3 choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*wait for an updated package (which then would be updated using the systems own update tools -- again, the updater, Software-Center, aptitude...)\n\n*remove the package, and do a manual installation from the developer-provided sources\n\n*do a parallel manual installation\n\n\nNever ever mix them up by e.g. replacing files the system (package manager) itself maintains, unless you know exactly what you are doing -- otherwise you might really mess up your entire system.\nEDIT:\nIf there is an \"urgent update\" available for some software you are using (e.g. with fixes of bugs affecting you, or the new feature you urgently need), you might want to check with the community: in most cases, there's a special PPA (personal package archive) available at Launchpad (see: Questions tagged ppa + launchpad), which you can integrate with your package manager's configuration, and then receive new updates from there -- if they are not served via the \"official repositories\".\n", "Q: Kernel metapackages (linux-generic vs linux-image-generic) The package hierarchy for Ubuntu kernel images looks like this:\nlinux-generic --> linux-image-generic --> linux-image-2.6.38-8-generic.\nBoth linux-generic and linux-image-generic are metapackages. I understand the purpose of having one kernel metapackage (to handle upgrades and multiple kernel versions), but what is the point in the second level? It seems that linux-generic only depends on linux-image-generic, so surely it is redundant?\n\nA: Yes it iswas. But since Ubuntu 12.10 linux-generic depends both on image and headers metapackages:\nlinux-generic ─┐\n               ├─ linux-image-generic   ─ linux-image-VERSION-generic\n               │                        ┄ linux-image-OLD_VERSION-generic\n               │                        ┄ linux-image-ANCIENT_VERSION-generic\n               │\n               └─ linux-headers-generic ─ linux-headers-VERSION-generic\n                                        ┄ linux-headers-OLD_VERSION-generic\n                                        ┄ linux-headers-ANCIENT_VERSION-generic\n\nBut I cannot explain why it was that way over mutiple release cycles. If you look at Ubuntu package search and look at all versions you will see at least the Hardy linux-generic package depends on two meta-packages (-image-generic and -restricted-modules-generic).\n", "Q: How do I create one user without key authentication?

The driver is Nvidia-current; Bumblebee is installed and working. My PC resolution is set to 1366x768.\nI managed to set up an external monitor simply by removing the edid line in the xorg.conf.nvidia file and starting programs with DISPLAY=:8 optirun program.\nVia optirun nvidia-settings -c :8 I checked that the external screen (a tv monitor) is detected with its native resolution, which is 1920x1080. So far so good.\nThe problem now is that the program, e.g. Firefox, fills only the middle and upper left half of the screen. The rest remains black. Changing the resolution down to 1280 etc. the screen is filled quite better.\nSo what is the problem, what can I do?\n\nA: I found something important out: I can start for example glxspheres with the option -fs (Full-Screen mode): DISPLAY=:8 optirun glxspheres -fs\nI then get the expected behavior, glxspheres fills out the whole display. Without it, it's only partially filled.\nI think, the problem is other than I originally supposed when asking the question.

I have an Ubuntu One account setup in 11.10. I've sync files and it works perfectly.\nHowever, at work, I can only use Windows OS, so I've installed U1 for Windows. The computer at work is a shared computer, thus I am trying to find ways how to keep my sync files safe from unauthorized access. \nThere are two issues that I'd like to fix:\nFirst: U1 automatically starts and connect upon boot.\nI have already unchecked the \"Connect automatically when the computer starts\" option from the Settings tab and rebooted several times, still U1 automatically starts on system boot and appears at the system try. This means that whoever logs into the computer can just click U1 from the system tray and access my files. \nHow do I resolve this?\n\nSecond: U1 automatically signs on to my account.\nEven with the first issue resolved, my files are still vulnerable since U1 can be launched with just one click from the start menu which then automatically signs into my account without asking for a password (shown below).\nIs there a way to force U1 to prompt for a password?\n\n\nI know I could just setup a password to the sync folders in the Windows Explorer but what would prevent someone from accessing my files (those which I choose not to sync)? Since the U1 window automatically signs into my account, someone could just easily tick the \"Syn locally?\" box and access the files.\n\nOr I'd be better off accessing the files from the browser - downloading them and uploading (again) - than syncing them?\n\nA: There is currently no easy way of doing what you want to do. Also, I need to point out that even when the Ubuntu One syncdaemon is not running, the files of the folders you've selected will still be present and anybody with access to the machine will be able to inspect them, and any changes made to the files while syncdaemon is not running will be synchronized up the server as soon as it starts.\nAnyhow. You want to do two things: prevent Ubuntu One (both the syncdaemon and the control panel icon) from running automatically, and, remove the credentials so the login isn't automatic when it is run.\nThe first is a little bit fiddly, but you only need to do it once: run regedit, and under HKEY_CURRENT_USER look for Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. Remove both Ubuntu One and Ubuntu One Icon:\n\nThen, every time you log want to log out (and that's inconvenient, I know), you stop Ubuntu One, go to Control Panel/Credentials, expand the Ubuntu One entry, and remove it from the vault:\n\nHTH,\n\nA: Unfortunately, Ubuntu One is (naturally) based upon the strong one-user-per-account model of Ubuntu/Linux, which it carries over to Windows. It assumes that since only you would be able to log in to your Windows account, it's safe to not ask you for a password every time.\nThe only solution appears to make your Windows login process similar to what you do on Ubuntu - require a password, no auto-login, each regular user of the computer gets his/her own account, guests use a special \"guest\" account.\nI would file a \"wishlist\" bug for this though, it would certainly be a helpful feature to have - I can see many folks (especially those with \"family\" computers) wanting the stronger \"two-factor\"-style authentication of having to log into Ubuntu One also each time it is started.\n", "Q: xdebug 2.2.1 installed but not working with cgi I've installed (via pecl) xdebug.

But as I said its better not to allocate, just to make it easier.  \nRAW recovery means to read files without reference to any operating system.  The RAW scan mode can locate the files without the aid of file system.  I would recommend Ubuntu Rescue Remix. \n\nUbuntu Rescue Remix is a Linux Live CD. It already comes with a whole\n  array of data recovery tools. One of them is Ddrescue. Ddrescue, is\n  one of the best data recovery programs available and it is free.\n  Ddrescue works by extracting a raw image of your hard drive and\n  transferring it to another drive.

This is still an issue as you will need to loose twice the amount of broken screen. But at least you will be able to see everything.\n", "Q: Get maximum bandwidth of a Network Adapter I would like to know how do I obtain the max bandwidth of my network adapter? \nI can read it when I open my Network settings panel (eg, Wired Connected - 100Mb/s), but I would to obtain this value diagrammatically. Wireless is not needed.\nThanks in advance,\nPedro\n\nA: Use ethtool.  ethtool can be used to query and change settings such as speed, auto- negotiation and checksum offload on many network devices, especially Ethernet devices.\nTo install ethtool in ubuntu, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo apt-get install ethtool\n\nIf you want to find what type of network card is used, its speed, on which IRQ it is listed, and the chip type used, you use the following command :\ndmesg |grep eth0\n\nBut keep this in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cat 6 cable should squeeze more speed out of your connection\n\n*Cable length - Keep it as short as possible\n\n*Your best speed results will be between 2 computers.

Selecting workspace 3 on the launcher switches to 1 and 4 switches to 2. I have the compiz cube enabled and when rotating workspaces it is just a plane with a dekstop on each face rather than the cube.\nIf I go into the compiz settings and have a look at the number of workspaces, it only shows 1 and if I increase them to 4 the workspace switcher changes to a 4x1 arrangement and selecting any of the other 3 not just changes to that workspace but without a desktop environment or any windows (including conky). If it hit CTRL+ALT+T for terminal, it then jumps back to workspace 1 and opens a terminal.\nI have been using my laptop with another monitor configured in twinview, but I have also tried disabling this and using one monitor and the issue still occurs.\nIn want to configure it to have 4 workspaces which display properly in the compiz cube and it would be nice to have this working across both monitors.\n[It would be wonderful to have 4 workspaces for each monitor and a separate cube and switcher for each one giving 8 total but I think that's just greedy :p]\nLaptop spec\ni7-2630QM\n12GB RAM\nNVIDIA gefore 555M (3D display so optimus is disabled ignores the intel HD3000)\n17\" Screen 1920x1080\nSecond monitor acer p223w 1680x1050\n\n\nA: \nNote that the switcher icon in the launcher will always show 2x2, regardless of your actual workspace layout.\n\nThe Compiz Cube is designed to work only with horizontal one-dimensional workspace layouts, not the default 2x2 Ubuntu Unity layout; changing to a 1x4 (1 vertical, 4 horizontal) workspace layout should fix it.\nTo make that work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open CCSM, go to General, and set the workspace layout to 1x4:\n\n\n*Now disable Desktop Wall and enable the Desktop Cube and Rotate Cube plugins.\n\n*The default cube transition speed can be so fast that it looks like a plane.

I am I wondering why I am not able to see the swap area of Ubuntu in clonezilla. I want to create an image of my Ubuntu. However, I cannot find the swap partition of Ubuntu to image it.\nThanks.\n\nA: \nThe swap partition is not needed.\n\nThe swap partition is not needed for cloning. To find out why, let's find out what swap does. If you have programs running, and not enough RAM, they are put in swap. At every boot, and through normal operation, data in swap gets cleared time to time, comes and goes, not being needed for data (similar to RAM). Keeping SWAP is like taking a snapshot of RAM, which is only useful for debugging. You only need to backup any non-swap partitions related to Ubuntu. If you need to restore, you can make a new swap partition, just like the one you had before, without risking important data.\n\nA: This answer is right. Just one amendment; if one wants to clone a complete disk with a swap partition clonezilla doesn't clone the swap partition but creates a swap partition. If one restores the disk the swap partition is created but empty.\n", "Q: convert .doc files to .pdf file using imagemagick I want to convert .DOC files into .PDF format using php image library imagemagick .\nWhen I used \nconvert filename.doc filename.pdf\ncommand in terminal to convert file to .PDF format I got the error\nconvert: no decode delegate for this image format `ATTENDANCE.doc' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/532.\nconvert: missing an image filename `ATTENDANCE.pdf' @ error/convert.c/ConvertImageCommand/3011.\n\nAny help and suggestions will be appreciable.\n\nA: ImageMagick can't read doc files. \nYou could try \noowriter -pt pdf your_word_file.doc\n\nwhich requires you have the libre/openoffice suite installed.\nNote if you have libreoffice, replace oowriter with lowriter.\nSee this other answer for a similar question. \nAccording to Broam an alternative invocation is \noowriter -convert-to pdf:writer_pdf_Export doc_file.doc –\n\nthough I haven't tested this. \nWeb service\nAlternatively I would also suggest using Google docs (now integrated into Google drive) as an alternative if you have a Google account or don't mind making one. \nYou can upload the doc and it will convert it to pdf for you (or an openoffice format if you prefer). \nWhich one should you use?\nOf these two options, the last time I checked Google docs had a higher conversion fidelity.\n\nA: You can use Libreoffice as a headless tool to convert docs to pdf:\nlibreoffice --headless --convert-to pdf *.doc\n\n\n(Taken from this SO answer)\n", "Q: Change the behavior of the capslock key To be honest I'm not sure or what I want is possible but it would be very nice if this can be done.\nI changed the behavior of the Capslock to act like a Ctrl key.

They can even be laid out alternating one monitor from one graphics card with another monitor from the other card.\n\nA: In my experience this just does not effing work in Ubuntu currently. I will say that if you have to edit xorg.conf in a reasonably current version of Ubuntu (anything post-Unity),  you're doing it wrong -- XRANDR does much better on its own. It's a shame, because the Intel graphics these days are so good, I don't want the adapter to go to waste, but X doesn't know how to use two different GPUs simultaneously.\nThis may have something to do with the fact that the Intel adapter doesn't actually show up as \"VGA compatible\" in lspci when you've got a discrete card connected -- but that's all the sleuthing I managed. You should file a bug report; I keep meaning to get around to it.\n\nA: Since 13.04 or kernel 3.8 the intel-driver can handle this!

I realy love Unity, but the most of the time I have to use gnome-shell because I only have 1.5 GB of RAM and when I work I have to use all these apps: fogger, firefox, compiz efects, empathy, gwibber and some lenses. What can  I do for get better efficiency of my memory usage without sacriface many features of Unity?\n\nA: Check what processes are using the most memory.  I use htop.  I have seen that compiz leaks memory, and is the largest memory hog other than Firefox (which also leaks).  \nI get the best responsiveness (1.6GHz Pentium M with 2GB RAM) when I:  \n\n\n*\n\n*restart firefox to reclaim leaked memory\n\n*log out and log back in, to restart compiz and reclaim leaked memory\n\n*don't hibernate the machine;  waking up from hibernating is slow due to the need to copy data from disk back into RAM\n\n\nOther things that could improve your experience would be to investigate configuration options for the programs that are using the most memory and select options that as a result use less memory.\n\nA: It's a myth that Firefox or most other applications are leaking much memory. It's a completely misunderstanding of how Firefox and Linux manages memory. You see in your system memory that the amount of free memory seems to go down and the allocated memory of Firefox raises. But that has nothing to do with memory leaking. Firefox use this memory and don't give it back again because the loaded code may be reused later, without the need to load it again into memory. But if Linux or an application needs memory and there is no free Firefox or any other application will immediately give their reserved memory back to the system. The use of more memory makes Firefox and every other application faster as they would be, if those applications would give that memory  back as soon as possible. So shutting down progs and restart them is usually not needed. Your memory isn't lost ;-)\nWell of course every big application leaks some memory due to bugs eg. But that is usually a very small amount of memory (mostly some KB not MB)\nSorry EliahKagan/jokerdino: I do not realy understand what you want me to do. Im new to AskUbuntu and english isnt my native language ;-)\n\nYes, it would be really cool to have a tool that shows how much memory is really used and how many memory is only reserved. But I think it's hardly possible. It is possible to get information, how much memory which is reclaimable and how much is not is managed by the kernel. Applications marks memory to the kernel as reclaimable or not or as memory that isn't \"allowed\" to be reclaimed (eg. time critical parts). So, kernel is able to reclaim reclaimable memory, if needed. But the other half of the truth is, that every big app usually has its own memory-manager to decide which parts of the program is used or which part of memory is only reserved and how many memory is needed to be allocated from kernel. \nFirefox has its memory manager (for eg. Firefox gives some information when opening about:memory), LibreOffice has also its own memory manager and all bigger apps has them too. If you would like to have the full information (not only related to kernel managed memory but also the apps managed memory) you had to get this information from the apps. I don't see an obvious possibility to get this information, because every app uses their own design of their memory management. You would be in a situation in which it is needed to understand and analyze all the different codes of all those apps. I think it's almost impossible to do.\nEliahKagan/jokerdino: Sorry, I dont understand what you want me to do. Im new to AskUbuntu and english isnt my native language ;-)\n\nA: sorry for using a new answer again, but the button \"add comment\" doesnt work in my firefox for what reason ever :-)\nThat compiz is leaking memory its obviously. compiz is somehow a living dead. its buggy and has several other problems not just leaking. Firefox: i dont know if firefox is realy leeking much and to be honest, i have  my doubts that it leaks much. tremendos amount of memory. Btw. comparing the memory situation before firefox was started and after it was closed does not say anything about the amount of leeked memory. Not only firefox cáches its memory the linux kernel do either. Most of the \"lost\" memory may be eg libraries in ram that arent used or used by an another app. the kernel decides when this memory will be freed. its the same thought i had explained in my first answer: let it be in memory for possible reuse until the used memory is realy needed. this strategy has two big advantages: no cpu time is needed to \"clear\" the ram. and if the ram is needed the kernel could imidiatly free that memory. If an app wants to reuse the code its already there. no need to load it from disk, which would be the slowest possibility. This not freed memory isnt needed by anyone, if it is needed kernel free it almost imidiatly. I also has my doubts that playing with config-options is a good idea, when you dont have deep knowlege of that app and a concret reason for it. smalering the ram-cash eg. in firefox will make it slower, eg when youve open many tabs, firefox may be forced to cache on disk and wouldnt be able to cache in ram.  another good reason not to play with the config options is the thougt, that the coder has set the value. he is the person who knows his code best and usualy he will optimize this value on his own experiences and knowledge to an almost optimal result. Usualy lowering chaches will drecrease performance of an app. If apps realy leeks memory (and its not the usual few kilobytes), for eg. compiz then restarting may indeed improve responsibility for a short time.\n", "Q: ubuntu vm cannot find new network cards After copying the virtual hard disk of a vm I made to a new machine, ubuntu no longer recognises the network cards and spews out errors like:\nfailed to bring up eth0 ..... no such device\nI'm guessing that this is to do with the change in MAC address (since the type of network card has remained the same).

When the converting process gets to around 250 (To 229 in some cases, 248 in others, 245, etc.. It gets near 250) documents converted it just quits.\nThe terminal lines I am using to convert this are:\nsoffice --headless --convert-to doc --outdir /home/cyrex/work/biopsias/2007 *.lwp\nor\nlibreoffice --headless --convert-to doc --outdir /home/cyrex/work/biopsias/2007 *.lwp\nboth work but only get to around 250. I have 60K documents to convert and doing them 200 at a time would take A LOT of time.\nConverting them to ODT also has the same problem.\nI have LibreOffice version 3.5\nUPDATE: I have checked to see if the 229 file was the cause. I have also checked if the following or the previous file were the cause. Negative. I even deleted the previous 20 files before the 250 barrier and the 20 after it. Same problem. I also opened the 229 file, the 228 file and the 230 file with LibreOffice with no problem. It just fails randomly before the 250.\nUPDATE2: Tried with another completely different group of files, this time, DOC. Again it gets up to less than ~250. Just in case it matters I have the following hardware:\nCPU - Core i7 2600\nRAM: 16GB\nHDD: 120GB SSD\nMOBO: Intel DZ68DB\nOS: Ubuntu 32 Bit\n\nA: please install libreoffice-dbg and gdb and run: gdb /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin then enter set args --headless --convert-to doc --outdir /home/cyrex/work/biopsias/2007 ${insert all files here}. speaking of which maybe you are just hitting the maximum command line length of linux? A ulimit -s BIGMUMBER might help some, but in the end you likely end up still at some limit. In which case you should use the UNO API from a script or even shutter write a small StarBasic program doing what you want.\nEdit: You should probably get away with apt-get install unoconv which you can pass a connection string (-c) to use a running instance of LibreOffice. Thus: Start LibreOffice headless and accepting remote connections. Then use unoconv to remotely trigger LibreOffice to convert. Since you are reusing the same instance, you should have no delays in application startup when using xargs to throw ~200 documents at LibreOffice at a time.\n\nA: I did the following but will not mark it as an answer. This only solves doing the whole conversion. The problem still exists. It grabbed an idea from the answer by Bjoern Michaelsen (+1 to you friend).\nI made a simple \"convert\" file with this in it:\nfor F in `find /home/cyrex/Desktop/mom/$1 -type f -name \"*.lwp\"`\ndo\nsoffice --headless --convert-to doc --outdir /home/cyrex/work/$2 $F\ndone\n\nIt just grabs 2 variables, the one where I am getting the documents from and the one where I am sending them to. Something like:\n./convert inmuno/vph/2007-2009/2007  vph/2007\nthis would grab everything in /home/cyrex/Desktop/mom/inmuno/vph/2007-2009/2007, convert that to DOC and then send it to /home/cyrex/work/vph/2007.\nLike I said, is a half baked answer, might help somebody else until a proper answer comes out using only the libreoffice/soffice command.\n\nA: Sounds like a use case for a bash script :)\nI've used 'unoconv' because LO always returns true, even when an error occurs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the linked file and name it 'lo_convert.sh'\n\n*Make it executable chmod +x lo_convert.sh\n\n*Specify the file dir and the output format (see script instructions)\n\n*Run the script ./lo_convert.sh\n\n*done\n\n\ndownload/view:\nlo_convert.sh\n\nPS: couldn't figure out how to insert the code directly (strange syntax...)\n", "Q: USB Boot graphics corrupted on Macbook. UEFI mode? I'm trying to run 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 off my USB stick on my Macbook Pro. USB stick is fine AFAIK, but when it boots I get corrupt graphics after the boot menu, so can only see random blocks of colour.\nHere's what I did: boot whilst holding Option/Alt. Choose the \"EFI Boot\" USB icon instead of my normal HDD. It then flashes up saying something very quickly, then gives me the Ubuntu menu where I can try Ubuntu without installing, Install it, or Check the disk for defects. If I choose \"Try without installing\" the screen goes black for 10 secs or so, then gives me the corrupt bollocks.\nI assume it's obviously something to do with the graphics driver. Is there anything I can poke with or edit on the USB stick so it'll force it to run from the USB stick in some kinda sensible/lower performance graphics mode? I'm guessing it's getting over excited and trying to choose some driver that doesn't work with either my Intel HD graphics or the discrete nVidia 330M.\nWhilst I'm asking, I don't suppose any Macuntu users out there know whether the \"EFI Boot\" icon implies it's trying to boot UEFI mode (which Apple's EFI may not fully support) instead of seeing it as a \"Windows\" disk and running with BIOS emulation?\n\nA: When you see the little pictures at the bottom like a man and a keyboard, press F6 and then using the arrow keys and enter, check Nomodeset. Then, continue to boot. Once you install, you can enable nomodeset by at the grub menu, pressing e and adding nomdeset to the long line that usually has quiet splash in it. Then, use Alt_F2 to run gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub. Add nomodeset to the line that starts with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX(but make sure it is inside the quotes), save, and open a terminal. Run sudo update-grub.\nSorry about lack of screenshots.\n", "Q: DIsable HUD for Some Applications I am using HUD on 12.04 ubuntu and firefox is crashing for me.

HUD does show options related to the firefox during this time. \nSo my question - Is it possible to hide and disable HUD for certain applications? I don't want to disable entirely as I am using it for other apps. \n\nA: You can disable HUD for Firefox by disabling the Global Menu Bar Integration add-on.\nGo to Tools > Add-ons > Global Menu Bar Integration and disable it.However I think you were affected by this bug whose fix has been released in new Firefox versions.Please update your browser.\n", "Q: Can I play OGG or WAV files using PulseAudio? I'm not totally clear on what pulseaudio does or how i can use it. For example, I have .wav and .ogg sound files that i need to play programatically (using c/c++).   How can i use pluseaudio to do this? Or should i use something else?\n\nA: No.\nPulseaudio is a low-level \"driver\", or better, a \"layer\" that exists between applications and ALSA(Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) used to direct and mix sounds. For example, a game needs to make a noise. It sends this noise to pulseaudio(or another layer which it uses if it is made differently), and pulseaudio mixes and sends to ALSA, which interfaces with your sound card. While you could write your own application, you are better off using banshee  or vlc . While writing software to interface with pulseaudio is beyond the scope of my knowledge, you can try using this extra reference.\n", "Q: How do I copy files that I just searched for via the command line? Using Ubuntu 12.04 I need help on copying files that were returned from a search with grep .\nI have many pdf files, so to filter specific named files I am using General grep command as \n follows.\nraja@badfox:~/Desktop/mtech/M.Tech II Sem-April 2012$ grep \"DESIGN OF FAULT TOLERANT SYSTEMS\" *.pdf\nBinary file NR-DESIGN OF FAULT TOLERANT SYSTEMS.pdf matches\nBinary file R09-DESIGN OF FAULT TOLERANT SYSTEMS.pdf matches\n\nHow do I automatically copy the files returned from the search to another directory?\n\nA: An easier way to do it would be to just use cp. \ncp *\"DESIGN OF FAULT TOLERANT SYSTEMS\"*.pdf /some/folder/\n\n\nA: Another way to do this in general when you are searching for files is in conjunction with the find command, e.g. \nfind -name \"*DESIGN OF FAULT TOLERANT SYSTEMS*.pdf\" -exec cp '{}' /some/folder/ \\;\n\nwhich combines the searching and copying (generally any action you want to perform on the files) into one command. \nIf you wanted to limit the search to the current directory you could add the -maxdepth 1 option to the find command. \nfind has many options for specifying which paths to search or not search, including checking modification times, path specifiers, filenames, and many more. Used correctly it's an extremely powerful tool. \n", "Q: Where can I find the Pictures / Music / Downloads folder icons? First of all, I know this question seems very common. I know the /usr/share/icons/Humanity/places folder. So this is not exactly about it.\nOn a fresh install, when you open Nautilus, you see your Home folder. It has several default folders with special icons, such as Downloads, Music, Pictures, etc. They are also bookmarked, so that you can see them on the sidebar. Actually two different icons are displayed : in the main panel, this is the places/64/folder-music.svg that is displayed. In the sidebar, this is places/16/folder-music.svg\nI deleted this Music folder. I created it again, and customized the icon using /usr/share/icons/Humanity/places/64/folder-music.svg But in the sidebar, the icon is a resized version of this one, not the 16 version !\nHow can I recreate the original behaviour?\n\nA: Finally, I figured it out by myself (or, to be honest, with help from an ArchLinux forum).\nSo, in the sidebar, this special folders are not under \"Bookmarks\" but under \"Computer\". To include custom folders in this list, you have to edit ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs.\nHere's the content of mine :\n# This file is written by xdg-user-dirs-update\n# If you want to change or add directories, just edit the line you're\n# interested in. All local changes will be retained on the next run\n# Format is XDG_xxx_DIR=\"$HOME/yyy\", where yyy is a shell-escaped\n# homedir-relative path, or XDG_xxx_DIR=\"/yyy\", where /yyy is an\n# absolute path.

But if you have also customized your icons by changing it to usr/share/icons/whatever you may also want to reset the icon to default by right-clicking on the folder icon, then going to Properties, clicking on the icon and pressing \"reset\" at the bottom of the window.\n", "Q: FDISK Logical Partition I have tried to create a logical partition via Fdisk for a flash drive. The problem is that I choose the option -n to create a partition, of course , and fdisk gives me only two options \"extended and primary\". However, I want an option for logical partitions. Moreover, in a topic in the forum, a guy is able to choose logical partition option instead of extended.\nThe topic's link:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1659376\n\nA: In order to create a Logical partition, you must first create an Extended \"partition\". As stated in the forum post, an Extended partition is just a container, not an actual partition. This Extended container is what contains the Logical partitions.\n\nA: Rather than trying this using the console command fdisk, you may have more luck using the graphical tool GParted instead.  I believe it will take care of the logical/extended flags for you, or at the very least will make it obvious which you need to use. \nhttps://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gparted/\n", "Q: Upgrading Kubuntu 11.10 to 12.04 - it want to install Ubuntu 12.04 instead I'm unable to upgrade using the instructions here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/PreciseUpgrades/Kubuntu\nI've installed all updates, but I cannot see any new version available.\nI had to change muon-updater to see normal dist upgrades even though 12.04 should be a LTS.

If when it finishes you get into the Unity interface(Ubuntu) at logon, then click the gear icon and select KDE, although this shouldn't happen. If there isn't even an option for KDE Plasma workspace, then simply install kubuntu-desktop using Synaptic or sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop.\n", "Q: How do I restore a browser session in Firefox? If I shut down my browser/laptop properly, then open up the browser again, it doesn't ask to restore the session. I can't add bookmarks to every link I browsed. \nIs there a way that browser can ask whether you want to resume/restore the previous session the next time you launch it?\nI am using Firefox.\n\nA: I believe you are referring to Firefox. You can simply click History in the toolbar then Restore Previous session, or to make this permanent, go to Edit->Preferences (Or tools->options, I am not sure about your version), and under General, select to \"Show my windows and tabs from last time\".\n\nA: You can do this.  Type about:config in the browser address bar, and accept the warning.  Look for browser.showQuitWarnig and set it to true.\n\nOnce you do that, every time to close the browser, you will get a box that asks if you would like to save your sessions before you quit.

First, consult your manual or computer specifications to find out whether your graphics card or graphics adapter is ATI(or AMD), nVidia, or Intel.Search for Terminal in the launcher. Then, type exactly and press enter:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThe next command will be run when you are again given a prompt. It will depend on what type of graphics card you have. If it is Intel, run:\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils\n\nFor nVidia:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nFor ATI or AMD Vision:\nsudo apt-get install flgrx\n\nLet the command finish and then reboot.\n\nA: The solution for me was the following;\nThe hardware Dell Optiplex GX620 desktop onboard graphics Intel 82945G (945G), Dell – E177FPc LCD monitor native mode 1280x1024 60Hz.\nI was running Ubuntu 10.10 and even then had to use xrandr to create and apply the 1280x1024 mode and edit /etc/gdm/Init/Default.\nI downloaded Ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso burnt the CD, did a clean install, the graphics were fixed at 1024x768, did all the suggested updates updated the kernel to version 3.5.0-10 to no avail.\nRead all the suggestions and recommendations in Ask Ubuntu, no change and when I opened Display in System settings it told me the monitor was a Laptop therein is the problem, and as we all know version 12.04 has no gdm folder in /etc, and no xorg.conf file but that is irrelevant as you will see. \nWhat I did then was unplug the LAN cable booted up with the Ubuntu 10.10 CD and did a clean install used xrandr to create and apply the 1280x1024 mode and edit /etc/gdm/Init/Default, now everything was working resolution was 1280x1024, LAN cable still unplugged.\nI then booted up with the Ubuntu 12.04 CD and proceed to do an installation, at the point where it detects that you have other operating systems and previous version of Ubuntu loaded and prompts you to select what you would like to do, I selected the option to Upgrade Ubuntu 10.10, it warns you that it will replace the system files but it will leave the users home folder in place, the installation was successful.\nWhen it rebooted and I logged in, it told me it could not apply 1280x1024 resolution CRTC310 in monitors.xml,  I then used xrandr to create and apply the 1280x1024 resolution mode and created the .xprofile file in the home folder with the settings used to configure xrandr and rebooted.\nAll working in 1280x1024 mode there is now no gdm folder and still no xorg.conf file, when I go to System Settings, Displays it says Unknown not Laptop, I have plugged in the LAN cable and have installed some updates, it seems satisfactory, I will now run more updates and see what happens.\n\nA: I had the very same problem, I was using a I-INC monitor that has 1 VGA & HDMI port. I was hooked to my GX620 via VGA cable with a \"VGA to DVI convertor\". In xrandr it was not detected as DVI, but as VGA instead. So I then put a \"HDMI to DVI convertor\" on a HDMI cable. Rebooted into a perfect HD resolution.  \nI had this problem with:\nubuntu,\nlinux mint,\ncrunchbang linux,\nkali linux\nThe cable switch fixed the issue no problem on all distros.\nAnyway...hope this helps those who might have the right convertors and cables lying around.\n", "Q: How to Pass/Record audio output as an input device?

I'm new to Quickly and to Python too. What do I need to do?\n\nA: I believe this means that you are using some elements that are based on gtk2, perhaps pygtk, and some elements that are gtk3 with gobject introspection. These things don't mix. Once you use gtk3 and therefore gobject introspection, you must leave all of pygtk and gtk2 behind.\nThe programs that quickly produce had used pygtk and therefore gtk2, but I believe recent quickly versions generate gtk3 and gobject introspection.\nThe libraries you use may use gtk2 or gtk3. In the answer you mentioned Jono said PyNotify uses gtk2, for example. He apparently decided to have one program use gtk2 exclusively and another program use gtk3 exclusively--I think that's what he meant by having separate code bases.\nThe thing to do is to pick one, probably gtk3 and introspection, and accomplish what you need to do being careful to use only those libraries that have been converted to use gtk3 and gobject introspection as well.\n\nA: I solved it by creating new application with the same name in different directory, and coping few files from old app dir to new app dir:\n/old_aap_name/data/ui/* to /new_aap_name/data/ui/*\nand also \n/old_aap_name/old_app_name/*.py to /new_aap_name/new_app_name/*.py\nAfter this package generates with no problems.\nI think problem must to be because I have created new dialog and then I delete files to this dialog as it was not needed any more.\nThanks for pointing me to right direction.\n", "Q: Specify the bootstrapped node in MAAS?

(MG5200 series) I just bought a Canon MG5250 multifunction printer because I thought that it would work well with Ubuntu, and the printing function is installed using these instructions.\nBut I still need to get the scanner to work and my attempts so far have not helped:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thep above instructions don't do anything: SimpleScan still says there's no scanner detected.\n\n*I found this post in the Ubuntu Forums but it's too terse; it refers to \"patching libsane source\" but doesn't explain this. As a beginner, I need more precise instructions.\n\n*scanimage -L responds with No scanners were identified.\n\n*sane-find-scanner responds with found USB scanner (vendor=0x04a9 [Canon], product=0x1749 [MG5200 series]) at libusb:001:002. Your USB scanner was (probably) detected. It may or may not be supported by SANE.\nQuestion:\nShould I try the approach about  \"patching libsane source\" or can you recommend a better/smarter/ simpler solution?\nI like SimpleScan very much for its simplicity so if a recommendation is to switch to some other software, it should be something equally one-click simple.\n\nA: I just delved into the packages, they do provide a sane module for canon multi-function scanners. And the second package does contain the right files.\nFirs thing though, cd dpkg -i is complete rubbish, that's not a valid command and would never work no matter what. I'm editing it out of the other answer so other people aren't confused by it.\nI would get you to list the sane backends, but sane is very poorly designed and can't be bothered to include diagnostic functionality. The only thing to try is redownload the scanner package from canon, extract the files and double click on the common i386 package followed by the mg i386 package and install them via the software center.\nUse scanimage from the command line to confirm if it's now working scanimage -L and if not, restart the computer and check again.\n\nA: Just use the Canon software : type scangearmp in command line.\n\nA: This question has been annoying me since the beginning. \nFinally, with the installation of Ubuntu 13.04 this problem has solved itself because in this version, Ubuntu's built-in SimpleScan recognizes my existing Canon MG5350 scanner, so I can finally have a one-click scanning function.\nSolution: upgrade to Ubuntu 13.04.\n\nA: While the scanner worked with simple-scan worked out of the box for Ubuntu 14.04, it's again broken in 16.04. scanimage -L identifies the scanner successfully, simple-scan also lists the scanner, but scanning fails with a connection error.\nIf you're affected you can try to use the solution described here and use the experimental libsane and libsane-common packages from Debian experimental. Versions 1.0.26 did the trick for me. \n\nA: Easier to use ScanGearMP: open the home folder and do a search for \"scangearmp'. In the results you will find an executable scangearmp with size 223,9 KB.

Lets get to it!\n\n\n*\n\n*cd to into where you installed MATLAB\nFor me it was the default that was given but you may have wanted to install it in a different location.\nDefault install location: /usr/local/MATLAB/R(year)(a or b)\n\n*Now you can list everything that is in that directory by typing ls into the terminal window.\n\n*Now type cd once more by typing cd bin (this is where the activation client is stored)\n\n*Type in the terminal\nsudo ./activate_matlab.sh\n\n\n*Now a window will pop up just like it did when you were installing it. This time you need check the bubble in front of \"Activate manually without the Internet.\"\n\n*Now check the bubble in front of \"I do not have a license file. Help me with the next steps.\"\n\n*Here you will find your computers basic install info.  This was just to check what your computer login name was and to make sure it is root.\n\n*Now go back to the beginning of the activation client menu and fill in the bubble that says \"Activate automatically using the Internet.\"\n\n*Do everything you did before except this time at the end of the activation when it asks you to type in the name of your computers user, you need to type root, instead of your username or instead of anything you want to put.\n\n*Optional: if you haven't already done it, you can install matlab-support so you can launch it after you finish activating MATLAB.  You can do this by typing \nsudo apt-get install matlab-support\n\nI hope this helps! GOOOD LUCK!\n\nA: Old thread I know, but I just had this same problem.  The problem for me at least, was that it is recommended installing matlab with root priviledges and as such when it came to activation the default user to be granted a licens became root.  In this way I could only start matlab when logged in as root.  Problem is easily fixed by running the activation again outside of root. \n\nA: I asked Matlab tech-support how this can be fixed, and they said this issue can occur if you have a previous MATLAB trial license file present on your system.\nTo fix this delete all files in the following two folders:\n$MATLAB/licenses/\n\n(where $MATLAB is the directory where you installed MATLAB. The default is /usr/local/matlab/R2015a/licenses/)\n~/.matlab/R2015a_licenses/\n\ncd ~/.matlab/R2015a_licenses/\nrm ./license.lic\n\nOnce you have deleted all files within these folders, try launching MATLAB again. Launch it as your regular username, not as sudo or root. You will be prompted to activate once more. Complete the process one last time. Take note on the screen in the activation where it asks you for your Linux username. This should be detected automatically, and you should not change it.\nOnce the activation has completed, try launching MATLAB again.\nEdit: Even if you get an error saying \"no such file or directory\" on entering the first command, you should enter the rm command.\n\nA: Way too old thread but viewed 4523 times and active 16 days ago so still relevant I guess. Here is how you solve it. In my case the folder \"~/.matlab/R2015a_licenses/\" did not exist. though \"~/.matlab\" did. So I created R2015a_licenses. Now the problem is this folder was accessible only to root. So the activation application could not write the required file. So change the permission of this folder using \"sudo chmod 777 R2015a_licenses\". Now run matlab normally(no sudo). It should take you to the activation client. otherwise run the activation client manually(no sudo), it is called \"activate_matlab.sh\" in the bin folder. follow the steps and let it detect the user-name and do not change it. when it exits without error you are done with the licence part. Now there could be another problem that your matlab freezes just after the opening window and doesn't go any further. Take a look at this. \"Go to the \".matlab/\" directory in the users home directory. Rename the directory named after the version of MATLAB you are using to have _old at the end. If there is a folder with \"_licenses\" in the name, DO NOT rename that folder\" kind of worked. By kind of I mean matlab complained that it cant write preferences in \"~/.matlab\". So I changed the permission for that folder by \"chmod\" and then it worked.\nIf you are still reading your problem is pretty bad. Good luck with it.

The command:\nusermod -aG vboxsf user\nshould do the trick, assuming the user you want to give access to is named \"user\".  After that, try writing to the directory as the user.  I think it should work.\n\nA: As the directory is shared by the host, the permission change should be applied on the host system (Mac) not the guest (Ubuntu) where the folder is mounted.\nThe method of adding the user to the group vboxsf won't work in this special case I think because the Mac won't know about the Ubuntu user so the chmod 777 (rwxrwxrwx) is the way to go.\n\nA: You can find the answer here.

I can only say that it is much better on ink than my Lexmark all-in-one(which didn't work with Linux at all). The ink is about; \nBlack: $18 for the regular $30 for the high yield(they call it XXL, if I remember right\nColor: $25 and $35 I believe, I have not had to buy color ink yet but I did look at it when buying black.\nThese were the ink prices at my local Dept. store, not sure online but likely cheaper by 20% or more....\nI did research to find compatible printers when I needed one and found that most people recommended HP as the most compatible.

Here is a link to Canon's webpage about it.\nCheers!\n\nA: Well, I can tell you by experience that the printers that better work on Linux are HP and Epson. HP has more advanced experience in printers than Epson, but Epson printers are very reliable and usable. HP printers are a little more yielding but the cartridges are not so cheap. Epson cartridges are cheaper, but sometimes they don't have a good yielding. Also, if you buy an Epson printer your printer will have a lot of years of support (unlike HP).

How do I limit the CPU usage in terms of temperature instead of percent usage?  Also, what is the maximum safe temperature to keep an Intel i5 running 24/7?

(maybe not if you disable SMI interrupts, I'm not sure about that.)\nThe main user-space application is the lm-sensors package. After installing it run sensors-detect to set it up, if your machines are the same you can run this once, and use the resulting findings everywhere.\nCPU frequency is easily controled via the cpufreq driver subsystem. see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_Frequency_Scaling\nYou could write a daemon that uses lm-sensors to poll the temp and if its too hot turn down the cpu frequency.\n\nA: This is how I solved my overheating problems, which were not caused by a specific process, but by failure of my laptop to dissipate the heat caused by running on a high CPU load for longer periods of time. The main difference to the solution offered by jeffythedragonslayer's answer is that I use CPU frequency scaling, instead of using cpulimit on a specific process.  Since I have Psensor installed and running anyway, I piggyback on Psensor. A daemon like the other answer suggested should also work, however two thresholds (min and max) are required. In Psensor (Sensor Preferences->Alarm) I set an alarm for the relevant sensor if it becomes higher than the high threshold (I use 85) or lower than the low threshold (I use 80). In Preferences->Sensors->Script executed when an alarm is raised, I call my script heatcontrol.sh like this:\nheatcontrol.sh powersave ondemand 82\n\nThe first parameter is a valid scaling_governor which reduces CPU frequency, e.g. powersave. The second parameter is the default scaling_governor - ondemand for most systems. The third parameter is a temperature between low and high threshold (the exact value is not important). Psensor adds two more parameters: a sensor ID and the temperature reported.\nAnd this is my heatcontrol.sh script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n# TempNZ is temperature reported by Psensor; strip of trailing °C\nTempNZ=$5 \nbnum=$(expr index \"$TempNZ\" \"°\")\nif (( bnum < 2 )); then\n  echo \"ERROR\"\nfi\nTempNZ=${TempNZ:0:$(($bnum-1))}\nSTR=$1\n# Is this a low threshold alarm?\nif [ \"$TempNZ\" -le \"$3\" ]; then\n  STR=$2\nfi\nsudo sh -c \"echo '$STR' > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor\"\n# echo new scaling_governor\nsudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor\n# play sound - audio feedback - optional\npaplay /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/message-new-instant.ogg\n\nWorks fine for me (UBUNTU 14.04 LTS).\nBeing a novice to Linux and bash, I used a number of resources, including:\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling\n\n*http://elinux.org/Jetson/Performance#Viewing_the_current_CPU_status\n\nA: \"Safe\" temperature\nThe maximum safe temperature for a CPU is usually specified on its technical specs from the manufacturer. A maximum of 100°C is pretty common. You may want to stay several °C below this value to have some margin (safety and maybe longevity of component).\nAlso, the CPU heating will tranfert some of its heat to the other, physically close, components of your computer. You may want to make some tests and monitor the temperature of these while your CPU is running at 100%, to check if you don't get too close to their limits in the long run. Better to test this during a hot day. :)\nTemperature regulation\n\n*\n\n*Then you can install thermald which is a program designed to monitor and limit CPU temperature using various techniques.\n\n\n*Finally, Intel Core CPUs for example have an internal temperature limiting mechanism that you can configure below the 100°C mentioned above, by choosing a margin in °C.\nSee this answer for more details.\n\nA: Ubuntu 22.04\nneed find device /sys/devices/virtual/thermal/cooling_device*/type\nwith \"type\" \"TCC Offset\"\ncat /sys/devices/virtual/thermal/cooling_device6/type\nTCC Offset\n\nto set max 80C temperature ( 100 - 20 = 80 )\necho 20 > /sys/devices/virtual/thermal/cooling_device6/cur_state\n\n", "Q: How to resolve \"No suitable download server found\" when updating?

Please ensure that your hard disk is set as \"first boot device\" or \"second boot device\" if you put your CD/DVD/BD drive as first boot device. If you have more than one hard disk drive connected to the motherboard, don't forget to configure the \"Hard Disk Boot Priority\" in your BIOS so that the one containing GRUB is the first one in the list.\nIf there is no problem with boot priorities, you should try to switch the mode of your SATA controller between AHCI and IDE (I suppose that you are not trying to set up any RAID). With some motherboards (rare), using AHCI may be a problem when using Ubuntu. If it works properly with AHCI, keep this mode because it provides enhanced performances, but if it doesn't, switch to IDE mode (normally more compatible). Don't forget that your motherboard has two different SATA controllers, so you have to configure the one handling the SATA port where your hard disk drive is connected. Look at \"PCH SATA Control Mode\" and/or \"GSATA3 Ctrl Mode\" options in \"Integrated Peripherals\" section of your BIOS. Don't hesitate to test AHCI mode if the controller is already set up in IDE mode. If your hard disk drive is connected to the GSATA3 controller from Marvell, you may also try to connect it on a port handled by the Intel PCH controller.\nIf Ubuntu still does not boot properly, check that \"EFI\" boot is disabled. Change \"EFI CD/DVD Boot Option\" to \"Disabled\". As a last resort, you can try to set \"EFI CD/DVD Boot Option\" to \"EFI\" and reinstall Ubuntu completely.\nI hope that the advices above will help you to fix your boot problem.\n", "Q: Is there a way to lock my browser with a password? It would be OK if it was only with my login password, but I would like to lock both midori and Firefox so that they cannot be used without entering a password. I'm running 12.04.\n\nA: Use ProfilePassword add-on for firefox. This would lock your firefox profile and whenever you run firefox it will ask for the password you set through add-on preferences.\nYes, these do not provide advanced security. But it's good enough just to prevent someone using firefox. I'm using it for some time now and had no problem yet.\n\nA: Even if you somehow lock just the browser but leave your computer/account logged in, it's quite possible for anyone to go in, open a terminal, and get the details of your Midori/Firefox history, cookies, stored passwords, etc.\nTherefore, it's best to simply lock your screen/computer whenever you are not using it instead of ever leaving it open. Then your login password is required before anyone can do anything with the computer.\nUse the Ctrl+Alt+L keyboard shortcut to quickly lock the computer whenever you are not using it.\n\nA: You can block users (that is, system identifiable users, e.g. users that are created using adduser command, that login separately etc) or users that don't belong in a group (here \"webapps\").\nFind the executable file for firefox:\n$ which firefox\n/usr/bin/firefox\n\nChange mode (user permissions) from 755 (default) to 750 (not executable and not readable by \"others\" except for owner and group):\nsudo chmod 750 /usr/bin/firefox\n\nCreate a group webapps:\nsudo addgroup webapps\n\nAdd current user ($USER) in webapps group:\nsudo adduser $USER webapps\n\nYou have to logout/login for changes to take effect.\nYou may add any other user, e.g. mytestuser:\nsudo adduser mytestuser webapps\n\nChange the owner and group from \"root\" (default) to \"webapps\":\nsudo chown webapps:webapps /usr/bin/firefox\n\nTry running firefox:\nfirefox\n\nYour user can execute/open firefox, others cannot. If you logout/login with a different user that is not in \"webapps\" group, you won't be able to execute it.\nOnly users in the webapps group may execute /usr/bin/firefox now.\nRevert changes using:\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/firefox\nsudo chown root:root /usr/bin/firefox\n\nNote: This doesn't stop the user from downloading a pre-compiled version of firefox (e.g. from http://www.mozilla.org).\n", "Q: How do I get Ubuntu to look somewhere for library files?

When I turn on the computer I get an error: \nerror: no such device: ...\n\npress any key to continue ...\n\nI believe the reason that Grub is broken is that the UUID it is looking for matches on the old hard drive not on the hard-drive for the computer. \nHow can I fix my grub to recognize the new hard-drive? I looked online for help \"Fix GRUB UUID\" but the steps seemed either out of date or complex. The response from Mike I linked to above gives me hope that there is a fairly simple way to repair this. \n\nA: Presumably this means grub starts and displays an option to boot to Ubuntu but when you select that it doesn't boot?\nThere are two options, I think:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the GRUB line editor to modify the linux boot option to correctly load linux (and then run grub-install as root to permanently set the correct config).\n\n*Boot from an Ubuntu USB stick, mount the ubuntu disk partition, chroot into it and then run grub-install.\n\n\nThe first case should be easier if you only have Ubuntu and only have a single hard disk, in which case select the \"Ubuntu recovery\" option, and press \"e\" to edit:\nThe entry should look something like:\ninsmod gzio\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ext2\nset root=('hd0,msdos0')\nsearch --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root XXXXXX\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-YYYYY root=UUID=XXXXXX ro recovery nomodeset\ninitrd /boot/initrd.img-YYYYY\n\nRemove the \"search\" line and replace \"root=UUID=XXXXX\" in the \"linux\" line with \"root=/dev/sda1\". Try and boot this and hopefully after a short time it will give you the Ubuntu recovery menu, which should have a grub option, which should properly re-install grub.\nOtherwise, or if you'd rather not mess around with grub directly (which should carry a health warning, use a CD/USB stick as documented in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#Reinstalling_GRUB_2\n\nA: To solve your current problem, you'll have to change the UUID(s) in \"/etc/fstab\" and \"/boot/grub/grub.cfg\" (very tricky).\nYou can use Ubuntu install CD to get the UUID(s) with gparted (you just have to right click on the partition for which you want to get the UUID, and click on \"Information\", then select UUID and copy it with CTRL + C) or command line (sudo blkid).\nThen you have to edit \"/etc/fstab\" on the right volume with gedit, nano or else.\nIn a terminal, type:\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nand replace the old UUIDs by the new ones.\nIMPORTANT : Of course, if you use a boot CD to do that you'll have to add \"/media/xxxxx\" before \"/etc/fstab\" : \"/media/xxxxx/etc/fstab\". You can also use gksudo gedit and open the file to edit yourself.\nWARNING : Modifying \"/boot/grub/grub.cfg\" is very tricky. It should normally be generated with the command sudo update-grub.\nReplace the old UUIDs by the new ones in \"/boot/grub/grub.cfg\" by entering the following in a terminal :\ngksudo gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nIMPORTANT : Of course, if you use a boot CD to do that you'll have to add \"/media/xxxxx\" before \"/boot/grub/grub.cfg\" : \"/media/xxxxx/boot/grub/grub.cfg\". You can also use gksudo gedit and open the file to edit yourself.\nIf you use the tricky solution, I recommend you to launch sudo update-grub once you have successfully booted the system.\nA cleaner but simple way to reconfigure grub properly may be using a boot repair disk like \"Boot-Repair-Disk\" : http://sourceforge.net/p/boot-repair-cd/home/Home/\nI hope that this will help you to solve your problem.\nHowever you might consider using Clonezilla to replicate the old computer on the new one as indicated in my comment.\n\nA: What I did instead of editing fstab and grub:\n\n\n*\n\n*I backed up those files on the fresh install of ubuntu\n( tar -cvf /somedir/boot.tar /etc/fstab /boot/grub/grub.cfg )\n\n*Restored from backup ( tar -xvpf /mnt/remotebk/full.tar )\n\n*copy restored fstab file (cp /etc/fstab /somedir/fstab.restored)\n\n*restore my fresh install boot files ( tar -xvpf /somedir/boot.tar  -C / )\n\n*Rebooted and it worked.\n\n\nI'm using vmware virtual machines, I did this process to move one linux server from one host to another host.\n\nA: In my case, the UUID that grub installed was different from my present UUID (sudo blkid) for my Windows partition (confirmed in grub.cfg).

My problem is that the Bash shell stops showing the characters I type into it. It does read the commands though.\nI've come across this problem quite a few times and I don't understand what causes it. I know how to solve it, but I really don't like it when I'm \"voodooing\" my way of out of problems.\nI'll describe the two ways I've come across this problem:\nI'm running a certain process, http://pythonpaste.org/script/ and sometimes when I stop that or it breaks control is given back to the shell. When I then go and type commands into the shell, the characters I type don't show up. When I press enter the commands are submitted. So for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*I type \"ls\"\n\n*I only see an empty prompt and nothing more\n\n*I press enter and I'm given a listing of the files, in other words: the command is executed\n\n*when I give the \"reset\" command the shell starts working normally again\n\n\nThe second way this happens is when I give a command like this:\n$ grep foo * -l | xargs vim\n\nI use grep to find files that have a certain pattern and then I want to open all the files that result from the grep. This works like a charm (although not as fast as I'd hoped). But when I exit Vim my shell stops showing the characters I type into it. A reset command resolves the problem.\nMy guess is that both problems have an underlying reason, but I'm kind of stumped on how or what that reason is.\nSearching for this problem is itself problematic because the description is kind of vague and has no hard search-terms for it.\nEdit\nGiving the\nstty --all\n\ncommand as per John S.

There's other special handling, too, for erase characters, Ctrl+R, Ctrl+Z, and so on.\nCertain programs, (editors in particular) that run from a command line don't need or want this. For this reason they signal the kernel with an IOCTL call against the tty (terminal) device that they don't want this behaviour. They don't want special characters to do special things, either. Instead they ask the kernel for a \"raw\" mode. In particular, editor's like vim turn off various \"echo settings\". All this applies to real tty terminals on a computer's serial lines, or the virtual terminals at Alt+Ctrl+F4, or the really virtual terminals you get when you run something like gnome-terminal under a GUI.\nSuch programs are supposed to reset any modes they change on the virtual tty they are using before they quit, either by entering a quit editor command or by taking a signal (from Ctrl+C) for example.\nIf they fail to do this properly the tty is left in the funny state you have discovered. Since programs can fail to reset the terminal, the reset command was written to allow the user to recover.\nI assume the interrupt is messing with the python software you are running. I'd guess that that program isn't getting a chance to reset the terminal, or is simply failing to do so.\nIn the vim case, when I run your example I get the same behaviour you describe. I also see a message \"Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal\" (It goes away when you reset). This is because vim isn't started normally from the shell. Instead  the 'grep' and 'xargs' commands have been using the standard input, normally occupied by the tty, for purposes of passing the file names from grep tto xargs.\nIn your posted output from stty -a we can see \"-echo\", also confirming that this is the problem. If you were to kill vim in such a way that it couldn't handle the signal gracefully you would probably see the same problem.\nThe problem is described elsewhere at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3852616/xargs-with-command-that-open-editor-leaves-shell-in-weird-state.\nA solution for the vim case is avoid xargs and use instead:\nvim $(grep foo * -l)\n\nHere the list of files is constructed by the shell, as it had been by xargs, but the shell is calling vim, which is directly connected to the tty. There is warning message sent to the error output file, and vim sets and resets the tty settings correctly.\nAn alternative to reset that doesn't clear the screen is stty sane .\nMore references here, and another interesting one here. Another interesting solution is given in an answer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8228831/why-does-locate-filename-xargs-vim-cause-strange-terminal-behaviour.\n\nA: Shell does not show typed-in commands, what do I do to fix it?\nie: how to fix a frozen or messed up terminal with the reset command.\nNote: I don't actually answer the OP's question here. Rather, I am answering the question \"Shell does not show typed-in commands, what do I do?\", which is what many people are trying to figure out when they search and land on this page.\nSummary: run this in the terminal which won't show the commands you type anymore:\nreset\n\nYour terminal will be cleared and reset, and you'll be able to see typed commands again. Note that while typing reset above, you won't be able to see anything, so it may be useful to press Ctrl + C before typing reset to clear any existing commands or stray characters before running the reset command.\nLong answer from someone else: Shell does not show typed in commands, \"reset\" works, but what happened?\n\nA: stty sane to \"set terminal sane\"\nto re-enable echoing of input characters, including special chars like backspace\ncompared to reset, it keeps your terminal history (scrollback buffer)\n", "Q: Windows Boot Manager didn't come up as indicated in the instructions I'm not technical.

In the last 3 years I have switched between openSUSE and Ubuntu, and two days ago I decided to install Ubuntu. \nWhen I was done it was quite laggy, and in frustration I tried to reinstall. Somehow, something went wrong and Ubuntu quit the installation. I tried openSUSE, but for an odd reason openSUSE got a lot of errors regarding my Windows partition. \nI decided to download the newest 64-bit version of Ubuntu on my brothers PC and burn the CD there. Now installation and everything went good, but when I restarted GRUB wasn't loading at all. After some tweaking I got GRUB up and running, but Windows wasn't visible. But all my stuff and the Windows files are visible and accessible in Nautilus & Dolphin, so it is there. \nAfter some reading on the web, I'm pretty sure that my problem is that GRUB is installed in the Windows partition. \nHere's my settings: Linux sda1 - windows sda2 - swap sda5\nWhat to do?\n\nA: Have you tried running sudo update-grub in terminal and see if grub can boot Windows partition?\n\nA: I recently had the same problem with Fedora 17.  The fundamental problem seems to be there are now several ways grub can be installed, and several different hardware modes a bios can boot-up in.   My first attempt to put Fedora 17 on, everytime I would go to install, the Fedora installer would complain I needed a gpt partition.   I read the solution to this was to run the following on the command line:\n$ su -\n# gedit /dev/sda\nw\n\nSure enough, that solved the install problem.  But then after that grub2 could not find my windows partition.  I tried everything, until I finially discovered what the installer did was create a /boot/efi directory where it installed grub (not grub2), so editing grub2 menus are useless.   At this point I probably could have just edited the config file in the /boot/efi directory, but before doing that I tried installing grub2-efi and then running grub2-install again.   That resulted in a system that would not boot at all.\nAt this point, even the live dvd would only boot in UEFI mode.  I proceeded with the Fedora install again.   When I was done I had a grub 2 install that could boot Fedora, find Windows, but it could not boot Windows.  It seems once grub2 is started in UEFI mode that you cannot boot a non UEFI operating system.   So I tried the Windows repair disk, and then the recovery disk.  Both complained they were for the wrong version of Windows.  Even an attempt to reinstall windows in UEFI mode failed, as I could not find a driver for gpt...\nSo I finally decided to try and restore things back to there original state.  I manually deleted the gpt partion, using fdisk and restored the MBR partion table.  Still I could not boot windows, as grub was in my MBR and there was nolonger a grub partition.  I tried a windows repair.  This time it detected it was the right windows version, and it attempted to repair the booting, but windows still would not boot, just grub.\nAt however, I found I could boot the Fedora 17 live dvd again in non-UEFI mode.  So I did that, and ran the install for a third time.  I was expecting it to repeat the original error messages and end-up with a EFI install again.  However, instead somehow it managed to install without errors.  Grub2 is now my boot manager, and Windows boots correctly.  The one odd thing is I now gave both a MBR and an GPT partition table.  With no gpt partition.   While strange, this seems to work.  If I were to start from scratch again, I would just manually build both tables, as that seems to work in the desired way.\nHere is the actual partitioning I ended-up with in the end:\n[root@docbill-PC ~]# gdisk /dev/sda\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.2\n\nCaution: invalid main GPT header, but valid backup; regenerating main header\n\nfrom backup!\nCaution!

Is it true? Can someone please help.Could you please tell me what is the best way for partitioning this hard disk? Thank you.\nI was thinking to do something like this :\n/dev/sda1    ntfs             100.00 Mib   boot\n/dev/sda2    ntfs             150 Gib      Windows 7\n/dev/sda3    ntfs             360 Gib      Windows ( primary - files, work, movies)\n/dev/sda4    extended         420 Gib   \n/dev/sda5    linux-swap       4   Gib      linux-swap\n/dev/sda6    ext4        /    90  Gib      Ubuntu\n/dev/sda7    ntfs             320 Gib      Windows ( logical - files)\n\n\nA: I'd suggest that you keep things as simple as possible. You may have a Windows recovery partition created by the manufacturer, you'll have a Windows ntfs partition, and you will need a partition for an ext4 partition for Ubuntu. A swap partition a couple times as big as your main memory isn't a bad idea.\nThe more partitions you have the more likely one will be too small and you will have to resize later, needing to do the work of backing everything up before you do--that's why I suggest you only have the minimum number needed and use the large disk size to be rather generous with their sizes.\nOne commom approach is to add another directory for /home so that you can do a fresh install of a new Ubuntu version after release without having to move your data.\nDon't create four primary partitions--four primary partitions don't allow you to add any logical partitions and there can only be four primary partitons. If you want four partitions make the fourth a logical partition in an extended partition. It's a big pain to convert a primary partition to an logical partition.\nBigger disks give you more flexibility. Other than that the particular hard drive you have probably doesn't matter much in terms of partitioning (exceptions would include RAID arrays or other special storage used in large servers).\nMany years ago files were placed near each other manually and one cared about cylinder sizes, etc. That's not current practice. The firmware in the hard drive hides the actual disk geometry from the rest of the system, writes these days are simply to the sector number n. The firmware will even move data around as sectors go bad.\nAs I recall the EXT file systems will try to co-locate the files in a particular directory in the same cluster, to try to reduce disk arm movement. With current disk technology there's quite a bit of data per actual cylinder. Also with current memory sizes modern kernels do aggressive data caching to reduce subsequent I/O to nearby data in open files, removing motivation for worrying about file placement.\n", "Q: How do I solve a thermal issue on my HP dv6 laptop?

So where to look at the password for ssh root@localhost\nPS: with the password, I can login to regular account on ssh xxx@localhost.\nPPS: to answer further questions on motivation of doing so, localhost is just a computer in a private network and setting up ssh root@localhost is just to relieve some manual management in a prototype system.\n\nA: If you decide to use the root account. \nDisable the ability to log in over ssh with root if ssh is exposed to internet.\nInstead login as a user, and su to root.\nThis will make sure to prevent brute force attacks against your computer. \nSince its harder to guess both the user and password. \nKnowing the username one would only have to brute force the password\nchanging the line:\nPermitRootLogin yes\n\nunder /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nto\nPermitRootLogin no\n\nand run:\nservice sshd restart\n\nto reload the configuration.\n\nA: Login as a normal user and use sudo -i to drop to a root shell.\nYou should not use the root account or change it's password for the matter.\n\nA: The user root is not enabled and is not capable of doing a log in, you can see that doing so:\nsudo grep root /etc/shadow\n\nthe field that usually contains an encrypted password is filled with a !.\nIf you read the shadow(5) manpage you will get this \n\nIf the password field contains some string that is not a valid result\n  of crypt(3), for instance ! or *, the user will not be able to use a\n  unix password to log in (but the user may log in the system by other\n  means).\n\nYou should not enable the user root for security reasons.\n\nA: ssh root@localhost uses the same password for root. It looks like you have not set root password.\nTo do that log in as root using sudo -s then use passwd command to set root password.\nAfter that you must be able to ssh as root \n\n\n*\n\n*How to find out root password for installing software\n\nA: set root password using following command\nsudo passwd\n\n\nA: They answered your question about login to ssh with non super user (say goblin@192.168.0.3 -p 22).\nFirst create another account without su privleges. After you log into ssh as a non super user you can enter this command to switch to root (escalate your privileges):\nsu\n\nAnd enter password.\n", "Q: Xchat broken after update / reboot Today, I did some updates to 12.04, as I do weekly.

Half of the RAM is unused and swap is empty.\nAnd yet again, when I open a few browsers (Firefox with Flash disabled), Thunderbird, Skype, Smuxi, IDE (eclipse or JDev) and maybe some other program I need for work, the system starts being sluggish (desktop switching slow, overview slow (if I press win key), scrolling in programs slow).\nIs there any other thing I should tweak to make this thing run smoothly?\nUPDATE1:\nUsed iotop, to find out what's hogging my IO (if anything): Firefox was caching and hogging the resources, I've increased the amount of memory it can use, still not nice but better, heard a leak was fixed in 15, but it's not in the updater yet (will wait). Also noticed that Smuxi (IRC client) was not playing nice, removed, switched to empathy (default). Added noatime to / disk mount, will post results after reboot.\n\nA: The problem was graphics. Don't know why, but the open drivers which I didn't uninstall prior to installing (manually) the new ones messed up things.\nfglrxinfo showed the correct info, so I thought it was okay, but fgl_glxgears were going only up to 60 FPS (with tearfree and vsync off).\nSo I cd-ed to the location where I had fglrx driver already in the .deb format and I:\nsudo service lightdm stop\nsudo apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-radeon\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx*\nsudo dpkg -i fglrx*.deb\nsudo service lightdm start\n\nfglrxinfo still correct, fgl_glxgears @ 800-1000 FPS ...\nMuch better.\n10x for the pointers\nUPDATE: another thing I've noticed ... sometimes (usually after resume from sleep) jupiter switches to performance governor but the CPU frequencies are stuck at lowest (as id it was using powersave governor). Use Jupiter of whatever you use to switch governors and change the governor to ondemand (and then back to performance if you wish). CPUs will then go over the minimal frequency.\n\nA: If neither CPU nor memory is the bottleneck its probably I/O or graphics, check I/O with iostat -xk 1 (check %util column), for the graphic card I can't really tell, maybe run glxgears?\n\nA: Just install a realtime (package name \"linux-lowlatency\") kernel and gnome will be smooth.

I'm a newbie and want to deploy ASP.NET web site and host it on UBUNTU 12 either server or desktop.\n\n\n*\n\n*Should i use Apache with MONO?\nOR\n\n*Deploy MS .NET Framework on Wine and a free web server that is made for Windows?\n\n\nIf a complete set of instructions exists for either options would appreciate if you can provide the link since the information i find on the internet is mostly fragmented instructions and difficult for me to understand \np.s. free web server for windows is either from UtilDev or Abyss both have free editions for windows\nthanks in advance\n\nA: Mono framework hands down. Wine is for running apps and games on your desktop nothing more if you ask me. It  crashes too much and has too many bugs--it's not stable enough to deploy anything for production. \nMono is designed for cross platform for C# and .NET. I reckon its your best bet and should work.\n\nA: I think there's a third option you're omitting which needs serious consideration: Don't.\nLet's start with the options you're putting up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mono is good (for things built for Mono) but it's not tested nearly as well and that's really very important when you're dealing with online services because there's little to reassure you that it'll work reliably and even if it does, will it be secure?\nIf it's a local-only project and the site works, that's probably good enough. If this is online and a widely used resource, it's going to get probed for vulnerabilities by bad people (every site does). I wouldn't be confident Mono was suitable.\n\n*Wine won't work. It's not just .NET you need running, it's the whole IIS stack. There's no separation between real Windows and IIS so from both legal and technical standpoints, it's dead in the water.\nIf you absolutely had to stop there and pick one of those it's a no-brainer. Mono wins every time. But those aren't your only two options. There's the third option where you just don't attempt to run an ASP.NET website under Ubuntu. That leaves you with two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a proper Windows/IIS/SQL Server/ASP.NET stack.\n\n*Port the website to something portable (PHP/Django/etc)\n\n\nI was in a similar situation in 2010. I had moved my desktop to Ubuntu a few years before hand and was finding it really hard to maintain a personal website because it was thousands of lines of compiled ASP.NET.

DO NOT share a separate /boot between several distros, it will mess up everything. Instead, use sda1 as the /boot of your main distro, and don't use separate /boot for other distros.\n1) If I were you, I would clean up sda1 and Ubuntu's system files by reinstalling it (you can preserve your /home folder this way: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuReinstallation )\n", "Q: How to get Installed program icon on to Desktop I have installed Ubuntu 12.04.

My suggestion is, do you have a VGA or DVI port on the HDTV. You could connect your HDTV with a VGA or DVI(DVI if you have two ports for it on your graphics card). This might work.\nAlso, does this graphics card have a Nvidia Chip on it. If so, you might have The Nvida X Server Settings application on your computer.

There is a company here that provides wireless internet service using an USB modem. It also uses an amplified antenna or cradle wimax. Both from the same brand, Huawei, which are 4G and not 3G like the Huawei modems that sell ICE and Kolbi.\nI wanted to know how to obtaind and install their respective drivers to have both devices functioning.\nThanks you.\nORIGINAL \nSaludos desde Costa Rica. Aqui hay una empresa proveedora de servicios de internet inalámbrico vía módem USB...usa ademas una antena amplificadora o cradle wimax. Ambos de la marca Huawei.y son 4G...no 3G como los módems huawei que vende el ICE y Kolbi. \nQuería conocer donde y como obtener los driver o poner a funcionar esos dispositivos. Muchas gracias.\n\nA: From Venezuela I tested 3 types of Huawei and one type of 4G in Ubuntu 12.04. I can verify that they work out of the box. Typically in Ubuntu there is no need to install 99% of the drivers for most devices. In this case, just to test them out, I connected them to the USB port. Ubuntu detected them correctly and even configured them automatically. I had internet in a couple of seconds after that.\nI also have the same M358 you mention and it works correctly. Again in the 12.04 version since it is the one I am using (Don`t know what version you have or if it works on previous versions).\nFor the Wimax part, it is in my understanding that Ubuntu has had support for Wimax for several versions. Since 10.04 (2 years ago) I think.\nYou can test this out by first updating your version of Ubuntu to the latest and then connecting your Modem via USB. The network manager icon in the top right should start changing and begin configuring your device.\nESPANOL\nHola Miguel, desde Venezuela te puedo decir que probe 3 tipos de Huawei y uno en 4G. los probe en Ubuntu 12.04. Pude verificar que funcionaron perfectamente sin tener que instalar o configurar algo adicional. Tipicamente en Ubuntu, en el 99% de las veces, no tendras que instalar ningun tipo de drviers o realizar configuraciones complicadas. En este caso simplemente conecte via USB el modem y Ubuntu me lo detecto y configuro automaticamente. Tuve internet luego de un par de segundos. Todo perfecto.\nYo tambien tengo el M358 que mencionas y trabaja perfectamente. Claro vuelvo a mencionar, en la 12.04 ya que no se que version utilizas o si funcionaria en una version anterior de Ubuntu.\nPor la parte de WiMax, tengo entendido que Ubuntu ha soportado esta tecnologia desde hace unas versiones atras. Creo que desde la 10.04 si no me equivoco.\nPuedes probar esto simplemente actualizando Ubuntu y luego conectando tu modem via usb. El icono del network manager en la parte superior derecha deberia cambiar y comenzar a configurar tu modem.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Localization We are a language translation company and a strong believer in Ubuntu as we use it internally for almost everything.\nSome of our clients have asked us for software recommendations (OS in particular) and we have told them we can provide them localized versions of Ubuntu and they are very excited.

Just had the message:\n\nLow disk space.. 2 GB left\n\nJudging by a posted message on ubuntu.org forums, I found that I have a .log file in /var/log at 22 GB in size! My root is an 82 GB partition and Disk Analyser shows the offender to be in log. The system root was installed circa 8 months ago, so clearly this is not a good thing in creating a 22 GB log on an 82 GB root partition.\nIs it safe to delete the log file or please advise on  the correct safe procedure to cleanse it without messing up my system. I presume it may be ok, but would like some other opinions before I do the task of delete.\n\nA: Further to my original post, I found it easier to use BleachBit (on Root) to clear out all the old logs on my Ubuntu 12.10 desktop; why they get so large I still don't know, but for now BleachBit 'clears all known bits, DEAD!' I reclaimed over 1.6Gig in space.\nif you find similar log, problems, then check out the BleachBit utility from the Ubuntu Software Resource or Synaptic Package Manager.\n\nA: It is generally safe to delete log files. The only disadvantage associated with doing so is that you may not be able to examine the log, if you're troubleshooting some other problem later. Since new logs are automatically generated, even this disadvantage is short-lived.\nMost logs are deleted automatically (after being rotated by compression and renaming, and kept a while in that archived format). If you have a log that's expanded faster than Ubuntu is deleting it, it's unlikely that you'll experience any problems from deleting it manually.\nHowever, if you have a log file that's 22 gigs in size, something very strange is happening, and it would be worthwhile to investigate that. I recommend editing your question again to include a link to the Ubuntu Forums thread you're talking about, and also to include the full name of the 22 GB log file.\n\nA: I'd like to add a word of caution here - maybe you can delete all your log files, but you might have problems if you delete the /var/log subdirectories.  I deleted all my log files and their directories (rm -r /var/log/*) and it broke my apache2 functionality.  Apparently apache doesn't/can't recreate the log directories and therefore can't write log files and that apparently can cause it to fail.\nI've heard before that deleting some log files can cause problems, though I don't have any first-hand experience to support it.  But of course I didn't have any first-hand experience of directory deletion being a problem until a few days ago...\n\nA: I know this is old, but so is the software I'm working with lately.\nI needed to install an old version of Android Studio and it was running strange when launched by a standard user. So I was experimenting with running it with GKSU root. Within a couple hours of playing around my entire hard disk was gone. WTF? Well the offending files were log files in /var/log. So I launched GKSU nautilus and went looking around. It had made 3x 30gb log files which I promptly deleted since I knew what and where they came from. So while I understand the risks of running things as root, maybe this will help somebody figure out a problem. \n\nA: If you are using rsync or suffering low disk space, two nice tasty targets are taken care of by these two commands:\nsudo rm /var/log/kern*\nsudo rm /var/log/messages*\n\nThese can get to be huge, and will be recreated the first time the system wants to write to them.\nWhen using rsync they will not only save disk space but also will speed up the backup.\n", "Q: How can I monitor Windows XP internet history over a network? (Im ubuntu 12.04) I believe my daughter is visiting websites that she shouldn't be on. She does that from a desktop with Windows XP. Is there a program that will let me view what websites she visits over a network while I'm on Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: If the browser is Firefox 3 (or newer) you could share over network the mozilla folder where the file places.sqlite is stored. This file can be analysed by sqlitebrowser  for example.\n\nA: You might be able to do it somehow, but keep in mind that if your daughter uses private browsing or incognito mode (just press ctrl+shift+P on IE, ot ctrl+shift+n on chrome, no other installations), that method will not work at all and it would be undetectable.\n\nA: It's possible to do this to some degree by using something like wireshark, listening over the network segment (that is, you'll need to be on the same switch, and in the same vlan if that's applicable).   This won't work for encrypted traffic (https, ssh, etc.), but many web sites send data in the clear.  This is more complicated if trying to sniff traffic wirelessly, but there are programs such as aircrack that can get you started. \nAnother option is to set up a dedicated proxy (squid, etc.), that acts as an intermediate layer between the target PC and the router.  It has a number of functions, but it can also log traffic sources and destinations (such as web sites). \nYou can also use something like OpenDNS, which does some logging, and can filter various categories -- it does this by redirecting DNS lookups to \"bad\" sites.  It requires that the target PC is pointed to OpenDNS for name resolution, however. \n", "Q: Trouble running VirtualBox on Ubuntu I want to run VirtualBox on Ubuntu, it used to work a while ago but I can't remember when or why.

Appearance of the numbers instead of user/group names indicates that the user and group do not exist in your system. Additionally, \"2000\" is a most unlikely user id for any flavor of Ubuntu. Non-system UIDs and GIDs start at 1000 and go up from there one at a time; to reach 2000 you would have to have added a thousand additional users! Similarly, system UID/GID numbering starts at 0 (which is \"root\") and seldom goes as high as 200.\nDoes your system have any other users? If so, is it likely that one of them could have been doing unusual things without your knowledge?\nWhen any of my systems show such unlikely happenings, my first thought is to back up all critical data, then nuke the box and reinstall everything from scratch.

Should I use it, since I only have 1Gb of ram?\nAlso, you can only move the unity bar to the bottom in unity 3D right?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: In general, when you use a compositing manager (which is used for desktop effects in Unity), there will be more overhead than when you don't. It shouldn't be more than your machine can handle with that amount of RAM, though. If you're looking for a more efficient window manager, check out XFCE or LXDE. \nI don't think that the Unity bar can be moved at all, regardless of whether Unity has effects enabled.\n", "Q: Is the Ubuntu kernel open source and available for download and building? Can I build the Ubuntu Kernel? I heard that the Ubuntu kernel is a special version of the linux kernel.\n\nA: I think this will help you https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile/\n\nA: Ubuntu Linux kernels are open source and are available for downloading and building. \nFor each Linux kernel version they maintain Ubuntu kernel developers maintain a set of patches until those patches are incorporated upstream. They also maintain a specific configuration. When you install a Linux image package the configuration used to build it is stored in /boot along with a map file, the kernel image, and an initrd file created for your system at the time the linux image package is installed.\nThis is a wiki page that describes the current maintained kernels source location. Each is stored in a git repository. As Clepto mentioned in his answer, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile contains instructions on how to get the soruce and do the compile. You can also compile vanilla kernels using an Ubuntu config, or your own config.\nThe Kernel development team also maintains packages for current upstream kernels in case you simply want to test one of those. That's useful for some bug testing. You can read more here.\nFinally it should be possible to do a straight kernel make / make install / make  modules_install, but you will have to manage the boot loader config as well as /boot and module files yourself and maybe make your own initrd file if you go with that alternative. This can be faster if you are, for example, doing a number of git bisects to find where a problem was introduced.\nNeedless to say, Ubuntu developers can't support a vanilla mainline kernel or one you compile yourself.\nThe standard Linux open source license applies, GPL V2.\nSee also What are the differences between the Ubuntu shipped kernel and the upstream kernel?.\n", "Q: Why aren't commits to this Git repository showing up in a branch on Launchpad? This branch here is supposed to be importing code from the following Git repository:\nhttp://git.chromium.org/webm/libwebp.git\nHowever, it isn't.

Will that bring Launchpad back to a sane state so that it can continue importing new revisions that will be added later in the Git repository? Or what if you delete and import again?\n", "Q: \"Supplied storage credentials were not accepted by the server\" error when trying to bootstrap juju This is the error while bootstrap\nclusteruser@cluster:~$ juju bootstrap\n2012-08-04 03:05:23,536 INFO Bootstrapping environment 'maas' (origin: ppa type: maas)...\n2012-08-04 03:05:23,694 ERROR Bootstrap aborted because file storage is not writable: The supplied storage credentials were not accepted by the server\n\nI've configured the environment .

When it does, I can't get at the Apache site(s) it's running, the Shared folder disappears, and I can't even ping it?\nNow before you assume it's a dynamic IP issue, I do have my router set to give it a static IP based on its MAC address (it's a WiFi), and that works perfectly well. Even after it \"disappears,\" it's still alive & well at 192.168.1.115 (as confirmed by it's network information window).\nIt's just that everything stops responding at that address...?\nNow I've read some posts that elude to the fact that it might be related to my not having configured Ubuntu, itself, to the static address (although that makes no sense to me, since the router is already configured for that, and Ubuntu acknowledges that's working).\nAs is so often the case, I find countless posts on how to correct that, and no two are the same, and as that's led to trouble for me in the past, I first wanted to see if anyone thinks that IS the problem, and if not, what else it might be?\nThanks \n\nA: it's still alive & well at 192.168.1.115 (as confirmed by it's network information window)\nTry using ping and ifconfig as troubleshooting network.\nGo to you server\nopen Terminal (press CTRL + ALT + T)\ntype\nifconfig \n\ncheck the section of wlan0 or something similar since you are using wifi.

I couldn't complete the installation because I needed to free up a partition.\nI booted back into Windows to view my Disk Management and free up a partition.

I used to boot into this OS using Grub.\nHowever, when I reformatted the disk, it seems to have deleted most of the grub files, but when I power up my laptop, I'm getting an \"Error 15\" message which I think is because Grub cannot find the OS files to boot because I deleted them.\nMy problem now is that I can't boot back into Windows, I can only boot from USB ( I have no CD drive as I'm using a netbook ).\nI read online that to remove the Grub bootloader I must boot into Windows and run a few commands in recovery mode to reset the bootloader.

However if i do sudo nautilus then open the file with gedit it opens.If the file is renamed config.ini sudo gedit again works.Could someone explain this to me please.\n\nA: You are entering the sudo gedit /path/to/file command into a shell (by default bash), but modern shells use the '!' character for special purposes. Special characters can be interpreted without special meaning by preceding them with the '\\' character.\nTry:\ngksudo gedit /path/to/\\!file\n\ninstead of\ngksudo gedit /path/to/!file\n\nIn modern shells the commands you enter are remembered and you can reenter them by using the '!' character. !! for example reenters the last command. As Uri points out, this is called an event designator. The bash interpreter also let's you use Ctrl+R to easily find commands you want to reenter, but the '!' mechanism is still there for us old-timers who have the habit of using '!' instead. Other uses of \"!\" include the $! parameter, and its use in arithmetic and logical expressions.\nA bash reference may be helpful if you run into such mysteries because shells can be very complicated. The gnu bash manual is here.\nUri helpfully mentioned that you should use gksu or gksudo rather than sudo. There is an explanation here: What is the difference between \"gksudo nautilus\" and \"sudo nautilus\"?.\n\nA: The easy fix is to disable history expansion permanently by adding the following line to your ~/.bashrc\nset +H\n\nIf you've never intentionally used history expansion, you won't miss out on anything by disabling it.\n\nA: It's an Event designator.\nsee man bash:\n\n\n*\n\n*!

To manually select the second drive for Ubuntu, select **Something Else...\"\n\n\n\nYou will see a list of disks and partitions like this:\n\nIn this picture the first virtual drive is /dev/vda and the second virtual disk is /dev/vdb.\nIf you have two SATA physical drive, they may be /dev/sda and /dev/sdb. If you have a NVMe drive it may be /dev/nvme0n1.\nPartitions in the SATA drive are /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, etc. and partitions in NVMe  drives are /dev/nvme0n1p1, /dev/nvme0n1p2 etc.\n\n\n*Make a New GPT Partition Table. To do this highlight the new disk, in my\ncase /dev/vdb and click on the button New Partition\nTable.... You will see a warning:\n\n\n \nClick Continue. Now you will see a new row below /dev/vdb called free space.\n\nHighlight the free space below /dev/vdb and click on the + to create a partition. This will be the main partition. \n\n\n*\n\n*Create root system partition / in ext4 format\n\n\n\nRecent versions of Ubuntu do not need a separate swap partition. At this point you may want to create a separate /home partition in the ext4 format, but it is not part of the default Ubuntu installation.\nMake sure the bootloader is installed in the first drive, /dev/vda in my case. As long as you have booted the LiveUSB in UEFI mode, the installer will find the EFI System Partition (ESP) in the first drive and install part of the grub bootloader there. Do not select a specific partition (like `/dev/vda1) here.\nContinue the rest of the installation as you normally would by pressing  Install Now button.\nThat's all. Done.\nContinue reading if you don't want to modify the ESP in the first drive.\nOption 2: Two Drives Two ESPs\nFor some reason you may not want Ubuntu installation not to write files into the ESP located in the first drive. Then you will need to create a new ESP in the second drive when you manually prepare the second drive for Ubuntu installation.\nSpecial Note: If you use this option grub will be loaded in the second drive, but it will not display when you power on or restart the computer. The computer will boot to Windows as before. To boot Ubuntu you will need to press the UEFI defined function (Fn) key when the computer boots to select the boot drive. The specific Fn key varies by computers.\nBug Alert!\nThere is a bug (bug number: 1396379) in the Ubuntu installer that installs the grub bootloader on the first ESP it finds. See https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2182302 for discussions on this.\nTo workaround this bug you will need to take a few extra steps.\nWorkaround\n\n\n*\n\n*When you boot from the LiveUSB in UEFI mode, use the Try Ubuntu\nwithout Installing option.\n\n*Open the Gparted application when the Ubuntu desktop starts.\n\n*Select the Windows (first) drive within Gparted at the top right\ncorner:\n\n\n\nThe NVME drive in this picture does not have Windows. However, it has an EFI System Partition (ESP).\n\n\n*Highlight the ESP in the bottom list of partitions as shown above. Right click on the highlighted partition and select Manage Flags from the context menu. You will see:\n\n\n\nYou should see two flags, boot and esp checked. Uncheck those two flags. Click Close button to exit the Manage Flag window. Click the green \"Apply\" ✅ button if it is clickable.\nYou will need to restore those check marks once Ubuntu is installed using the same above process so that Windows can boot from the first drive.\nClose Gparted.\nThis is the end of the workaround.\nInstall Ubuntu\nFollow the instructions to install Ubuntu in the second drive as described in Option 1 above. That is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Something Else... as before.\n\n*Create a new gpt partition table for the second disk if not there.\n\n*Create a new EFI System Partition (ESP)\n\n\nHighlight the Free Space under /dev/vdb and click on the + to create the first partition. The first partition will be a 200 MB EFI system partition. Change the size to 200 MB and the Use as:\n\nThe Create Partition window should now look like:\n\nCreate root system partition / in ext4 format below the ESP:\n\nOnce done, your disks and partitions will look like:\n\nRecent versions of Ubuntu do not need a separate swap partition. At this point you may want to create a separate /home partition in the ext4 format, but it is not part of the default Ubuntu installation.\nMake sure the bootloader is installed in the second drive, /dev/vdb in my case.  Do not select a specific partition (like `/dev/vdb1) here.\nContinue the rest of the installation as you normally would by pressing  Install Now button.\nOnce the installation is complete, you will get an choice to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Continue exploring Ubuntu live session\n\n*Restart Computer\n\n\nDo not restart the computer yet!\nSelect the continue to explore Ubuntu and open Gparted again. Go through the process in the Workaround section above, and reverse the changes made then. \nClose Gparted. Restart the computer by clicking on the right top bar and selecting the power button from the drop-down menu.\nThat's all. Done.\n\nA: That's simple:\n\n*\n\n*First download the ISO file then burn it to a CD/DVD or use Unetbootin to get a bootable USB, select the Installation media to boot first from your BIOS.\n\n*Once you're in the Live Session, choose Install Ubuntu.\n\n*When you get to the Choose an Option screen, select Do Something Else.\n\n*Locate the Second drive and choose to Install the System on the second drive.\n\n*Choose to also install the bootloader on the 2nd drive, make sure it's the drive and not a partition (i.e. /dev/sda and not /dev/sda1)\n\n", "Q: In 12.04 LTS, I get \"No DBus\" errors when running things as root While attempting to run gEdit as root from a terminal window (was trying to do some tweaking on my HOSTS and FSTAB files), I get a message saying \"No DBus connection available\" and get booted back to the prompt. \nHowever, I can run Nautilus from the prompt like that (still get the error, but it runs all the same), and use WINE and NOTEPAD, and was able to make my changes.\nI thought maybe DBUS was missing, but APT says it's installed and gEdit runs fine when not elevated.

When gnuplot starts up, there's no default terminal type (\"Terminal type set to 'unknown'\").  If I then do\nset term xterm\n\nwhich is in the list returned by \nset term\n\nand then try to plot any function, all I get is gobbledygook.  I've tried uninstalling gnuplot completely (via apt-get purge) from my computer and installing only gnuplot-x11, and doing a manual install from the gnuplot-4.6.0 package using the ./configure --with-x option with success.  The only \"solution\" I've found is to use \nset term dumb\n\nand put up with a text-based graphic.  This is ok for just checking the shape of a simple function.  For more complicated functions, I've resorted to using the epslatex terminal and gv to view the output.\nIs there anyone out there who's found a better and more complete solution?\n\nA: I have succeed in installing gnuplot after installing the following libraries:\nsudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxt-dev libreadline-gplv2-dev glib-2.0 \n\nUsing the first 3 allowed to use gnuplot. After installing glib-2.0 allowed me plot in a x11 terminal.\n\nA: xterm will be good for a while, but if you require GNU octave too, then you certainly require gnuplot to detect x11 terminal. There are two ways which I hope must resolve it for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit configure script in the .gz downloaded from gnuplot site to meet some positive value in X11_APPDEFAULTS_DIR variable.\n\n*You could just do apt-get install glib-2.0 and configure the the gnuplot again.

Since the files were copied the pdf files were copied to the directory; find came up with the warning. \n\nA: Ankid's answer was accepted, but it is mostly wrong. Yes, find also searches the lcommands directory, but as you can see from the screenshot part before find, directory lcommands already contains the three pdf files before find command was issued. \nWhat really happens: find -exec cp results in a command cp ./lcommands/abc.pdf lcommands/. As ./lcommands is exactly the lcommands directory (./ is the same as ././, the same as ./././././, the same as the directory you are just in), it would result in copying abc.pdf over itself, which cp refuses, because that would result in a crippled destination file (at least for files bigger than cp's buffer is long). \nImagine how cp works: it opens source file, reads a chunk, opens destination file (truncating it if it should exist and not be empty), writes the previous read chunk to destination file; then it would read the next chunk of source file, but anything except the first chunk is gone because of previous truncate operation. So authors of cp tried hard to detect any situation where the source and destination file are the same.\ncp is not complaining, that the file is already there - it would happily overwrite it! Except you additionally used option -i or -n. So jpic's answer is correct - even if it might not be very detailed and didn't help you therefore.\nThe same with the other two pdf files.\nTo make it as clear as possible: cp doesn't complain because the destination file(s) exist(s), but because it is (they are) exactly the source file(s). And this is exactly what the error message says.\n\nA: It is an error (return code 1), from cp:\n>>> cp foo foo\ncp: `foo' and `foo' are the same file\n<<< 11:33.40 Sat Aug 04 2012!~ \n1\n\nWhich means that cp did not do anything.\n", "Q: How to change from Unity 2D to 3D? I have been trying to run MyUnity, and it's been working fine until today, when it comes up with the message:  \n\nSo, apparently I am running Unity-2D. So I did a little command-line search withecho $DESKTOP_SESSION and sure enough, it spat out simply \"ubuntu-2d\". \nI have been using Ubuntu Tweak and perhaps I did something stupid in there, but I don't think it even had a feature like that. I've also noticed the clear differences in Ubuntu 2D to Ubuntu 3D, as well.\nI have 12.04 Ubuntu. So is it possible for me to \"revert\" back to Ubuntu/Unity 3D?\nEdit: My graphic card is a 2GB dedicated AMD Radeon HD 7750, which I've come to think needs to be upgraded 12.6 version. I'll try this and let you know the of the outcome, thanks so much for helping.\nResult: after successfully updating the graphics card, I now can run 3D. Thanks so much to all of you and I'm sorry for such an unusual question!\n\nA: You can determine if you are running Unity 3D or 2D by open the system monitor. If you see a process named compiz in the processes tab, you are using Unity 3D. If it's running metacity instead, you're working with Unity 2D.\nIdeas to get Unity 3D working:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, install the package nux-tools and run /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p in a terminal window. It will show if your hardware is supported by Unity 3D. If you have an Nvidia or AMD/ATI graphics card, you might have to install the proprietary drivers first to get (good) 3D support. If it says Unity 3D supported: yes, you can continue with the other steps. If not, you cannot use Unity 3D.\n\n*Install Unity if it's not installed by running sudo apt-get install unity gnome-session.\n\n*Now log out, there should be an Ubuntu logo next to your username in the login manager. Click on it and select \"Ubuntu\", and log in again. Unity 3D should start.\n\n*If it's still starting Unity 2D and not 3D, open a terminal and type unity --replace. Unity 3D should start, if not, the terminal output might be interesting.\n\n*If all above doesn't work, create a new user and log in. Don't forget to select \"Ubuntu\" as in 3. Maybe some of your old user's preferences are broken, a new user will start with fresh preferences.\n\n\nA: I suggest you to have a look at the 2 answers of that question\nYou will learn out to configure the file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n", "Q: HP Pavilion G6 at 12.04 LTS - boot failure.

And Want full backup for every two month. I wish to prefer when. Is tah possible?\n\nA: It's difficult to control that precisely.  Two main things affect it.  How frequently your automatic backups happen and how long you told DD to keep backups.\nBy default, with weekly backups and keeping them forever, DD will make a fresh backup every three months.\nIf you change it to daily backups, I believe it switches to monthly fresh backups.\nIt sounds like you already make regular manual backups.  I'd say change the automatic backup setting to weekly and continue with your manual backups.  DD should use three month intervals.\nIn Ubuntu 12.10, DD will always use three months no matter what.

For information on how to enable the PAE kernel please see:Enabling PAE). If you would like native support of your 4gb, and/or planning to add more in the future, you are better off installing the 64 bit edition of the Ubuntu 12.04 (should be under a name x86_64, or x64, or amd64).

BTRFS can supposedly be better tuned towards flash disks so I figured this would be a good idea. So I swapped the defective CF card with a new one and booted from the 12.04 server CD.\nAlthough the installation went painfully slow ( > 3 hrs), I already read this is a known issue when using BTRFS on flash disks so I did not worry that much.\nHowever, when the setup process was finally at the point where GRUB was going to be installed, I got the following error:\nUnable to install GRUB in /dev/sda\nExecuting 'grub-install /dev/sda' failed.\n\nThis is a fatal error.\n\nThis is what I saw when I switched back to TTY4:\ngrub-installer: info: Installing grub on '/dev/sda'\ngrub-installer: info: grub-install supports --no-floppy\ngrub-installer: info: Running chroot /target grub-install --no-floppy --force \"/dev/sda\"\ngrub-installer: /usr/sbin/grub-setup: warn:\ngrub-installer: \ngrub-installer: Your core.img is unusually large.

However, when I now boot the system, I get the infamous 'GRUB Error 17'.\nSo my obvious question is - how do I fix this? And is this a bug in the installer that I need to report? As you can imagine, I would prefer not to have to spend another 3 hours doing the entire installation again...\nEdit: I took a quick look at the size of core.img, and it's 38284 bytes. If I understood correctly, GRUB wants to put this at the very first position on the disk, where a tiny amount of space should be available before the first partition. In my case this space is, if I interpreted the data of 'fdisk -l /dev/sda' correctly, only 63 x 512 = 32256 bytes in size... no wonder GRUB complains about core.img not fitting in!\nBut how can it be core.img is this large? Is it because of BTRFS? For example, the core.img of my laptop is only 26052 bytes (and it's not using BTRFS). How do I get it to fit, besides reformatting to something else than BTRFS?\nEdit 2: Feeling courageous, I used gparted to move sda1 a little 'to the right', to enlarge the space before the first partition.\nAfter this, I booted the 12.04 server CD in resque + expert mode and tried to install GRUB again. This time I got a different error:\ngrub-installer: /usr/sbin/grub-probe: error:\ngrub-installer:\ngrub-installer: cannot find a device for /boot/grub (is /dev mounted?)\ngrub-installer: .\ngrub-installer: error: Running 'grub-install --no-floppy --force \"/dev/sda\"' failed.\n\nNow what?\n\nA: grub+btrfs module is too big for the free space in your MBR, see bug #1059827 - \"Non trivial grub2 installs no longer fit in small embed areas\".\n", "Q: Will running Ubuntu from a USB flash drive touch my hard drive? Right now I'm using Wubi to install Xubuntu 12.04 on my 8GB flash drive, and I'd just like to make sure that when I boot from the USB it won't affect my hard drive's bootloader/partitions at all, and just keep it all on the USB.\nIs this correct?\n\nA: The thing is right that It will not affect your hard drive partitions but you will get option for ubuntu in your Windows Boot loader. you will get entry for ubuntu on windows bootloader.

Let me talk first about Windows and then we can delve into Linux.\nIn Windows, if you have (Does not matter if you have 32 bit or 64 Bit) an X amount of memory, the system will reserved a percent of it for the correct functioning of the system. Depending on the hardware, integrated devices (Integrated video card, sound card, network card, etc...), amount of devices connected, version of Windows, etc.. the amount reserved will change. In some cases, on Windows XP in a PC with 4GB you will see yourself with only 3.5GB available. In other cases you will see 3.2GB, 3.1GB, 3.0GB or in the worst case I have seen, only 2.8GB. On Windows 7, the same reserved amount of memory varies depending on hardware and software, changing from 3.0GB to a 3.7/3.8GB available maximum ram. This available amount of ram is what the programs you run use and it is the memory that is left after the system has calculated and reserved the part of the memory that it needs to correctly work.\nThis memory is not normally interchanged between the user applications and the memory reserved for the system.\nOn Linux, is the same. The system loads and it needs a required amount of memory for everything to function as smooth as it can. If you have 512MB the system will not reserve a lot since it will notice the lack of memory. If you have 1GB or 2GB the amount reserved gets bigger. The limit for 32 Bit is 4GB from which it reserves between 200MB and 1GB of RAM (Again, depending on hardware or software) so everything can run smooth. So you would be left with a total usable memory between 3.0GB to 3.8GB.\nNow, aside from the obvious reserved memory for the system, there are a couple of BIOS/hardware options that actually can take even more. The most common one is the amount of memory assign to an integrated video card. It can range from 2MB to a cool 1.5GB. If you have for example 1GB assign to the video card, that is 1GB you will not see in the total available memory. A sound card uses a small amount of memory ,but it uses memory nevertheless. Same for a network card, capturing device, webcam, etc...\nSum them all up and you get the total available amount of memory for the common programs you use (firefox, gimp, empathy, libreoffice, etc...)\nSo it is not a question of if Ubuntu is not reading the memory correctly with or without a 64 Bit system, it is more of a question about if the system has enough memory to operate correctly and enough for the user apps. In your case, as you can see, Ubuntu took 800MB for the system and 3.2GB for you to use with your apps, without both having to share memory in the process. This will enhance the speed and load time of the apps since they have their own user space in memory. A problem would be if the amount of memory the system needs is higher than the amount of memory you have and you want to open an app in that moment. They would have to share memory, which means having to use swap/virtual memory, which means slower loading times.\nThis is the terminal output of a 3GB Laptop:\nexodus@exodus:~$ free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          2898       1186       1711          0        117        569\n-/+ buffers/cache:        499       2398\nSwap:         3837          0       3837\n\nAs you can see by my example and your example, the shared memory is not needed since you have much more memory than you need in the moment you ran that command. The system has its memory and the apps have their memory.\nAs you can also see (Using in my example Ubuntu 12.04 32 Bit) the system is only taking around 120MB. But look here:\ncyrex@cyrex:~$ free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:         14696       1744       12952         0        447        730\n-/+ buffers/cache:        533       3318\nSwap:          254          0       254\n\nIn this case I have 16GB RAM and Ubuntu 32 Bit also, is taking around 1.5GB for the system. Giving me about 12.5GB for the rest of my apps. Now read here, on the same system with Windows 7 64BIT it takes 3.5GB. It always says when I go see the memory left 12.4GB. So depending on the system and hardware, the amount reserved (Or stolen ^^) can vary.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS - Freezes Randomly I've been having slowdowns/freezes in Ubuntu only after upgrading to 12.04 LTS. I'm using an AMD Athlon II X2, 3GB Ram and an ATI Radeon HD5670.\nMy PC freezes randomly and I suspect that it's really the graphics card/drivers. I've tried using the 'additional drivers' option to install the graphics driver but it was giving me slowdowns/freezes. Then I tried installing fglrx through the command line and still had freezes. I've also tried the driver that comes from AMD's website, but still the same result.Then after reading some articles, I've tried installing the driver from Ubuntu-x(https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates), but still freezes are random. Here are the details after running fglrxinfo and glxinfo.\n$glxinfo\nserver glx vendor string: ATI\nserver glx version string: 1.4\n\n$fglrxinfo\nOpenGL vendor string: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\nOpenGL renderer string: ATI Radeon HD 5670\n\nI'm using Gnome by the way, but I've also tried out Unity and at first it was running smoothly, but same result after a few hours. I've also noticed that compiz was taking a huge amount of CPU usage. I've also done few workarounds like setting the force full screen redraw and other stuff but didn't work. I don't think my graphics card is broken because it's running fine in Windows.\nCould it be that I messed up the installations and got some sort of leftovers from each? I know that I purged fglrx cleanly after installing. Is there a way to completely reset my graphics card drivers?\nIs anyone here also experiencing the same problems with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and ATI cards? I'm not sure what's the next step. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!\nUpdate:\nI apparently installed the open source driver incorrectly, and I was actually using fglrx. I installed the open source driver and am still monitoring the performance.\n\nA: In the \"update manager\", \"settings\" menu,\"Updates\" sub menu, check mark \"Pre-released updates\" and download all new updates. Worked for me. No more random freezes.\n\nA: Go to the AMD Official Website and download the proprietary Catalyst(TM) driver.\nhttp://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx\nDownload the appropriate driver for your needs. You will get a zipped file of some sort. Extract the file, and then run it as an executable. It will install the AMD graphics drivers on your system. You then must reboot.\nEDIT: Actually, it should be alright to use the open source drivers, but the proprietary drivers provide better performance (for me, anyways).\n", "Q: LiveCD Boot/Install I have recently built a new computer and have been looking to dual-boot alongside Windows.

I have a (quite) new Acer 7750G Notebbok (Intel Core i5 2410M, 4 GB DDR3 1333 MHz, Intel HM65 Express Chipset) running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.\nI gave to a friend of mine my older Desktop PC (Asus Termninator T2-AE1, Amd Athlon 64 3200+, 1.5 GB DDR 333 MHz, K8ST Chipset) previously running Windows XP now proudly running Ubuntu 10.04.\nI cannot explain why that old piece of hardware run almost fast as mine.\nIs Linux that miraculous? :-)\n\nA: It may run the basic system fast enough, but when the time to perform a more computational intensive activity comes, the newer system's superiority will become obvious. Also take in mind that linux is not windows. A basic linux system can run fine on a vast variety of hardware, dated or not.\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't have much high requirements, and the specifications of your Desktop PC is more than enough to run Ubuntu flawless. Linux contrarely to Windows, isn't a resource hog, so it's perfectly normal that Ubuntu would run great on that desktop PC.\nThe official requirements for Ubuntu 11.04 are:\n700 MHz processor (about Intel Celeron or better)\n512 MiB RAM (system memory)\n5 GB of hard-drive space (or USB stick, memory card or external drive but see LiveCD for an \nalternative approach)\nVGA capable of 1024x768 screen resolution\nAnd your PC is better than this.\n", "Q: rsync password problem I have a python script. In that, I am using rsync for data transfer between two systems. While running, it ask for password for data transfer.

While running my python script, the data can be transferred without asking for password. But the problem is that I create a crontab job, and run my script at every reboot, which means every time the system is on, the code will be executed automatically.\nIn this situation, while reboot, my script starts to execute. But it asked destination system password for data transfer (open one small dialog-box in the name of openssh). \nWhat to do while reboot the system is not suppose to ask password. \nNote: if I am supposed to run my script manually, it could not ask password. The data can be transferred to destination system perfectly. \nIf you know please teach me .I am waiting.\n\nA: What I think is that your ssh key has been generated for your regular user account (stored in /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa).\nHowever, the reboot cron is probably run by the root user looking for ssh key as /root/.ssh/id_dsa\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put your cron in the user crontab with crontab -e, so that rsync/ssh will be run by your user and use the ssh key of your user.\n\n*Generate a ssh key for the root user, and add the key to the remote server\n\n*Use rsync -e \"ssh -i /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa\" in the root crontab so that root will use your user ssh key\n\n*Check carefully that your ssh keys were not generated with a passphrase protection.

I followed these instructions and created a hotspot as shown below, but UbuntuHost is not visible on the LG Optimus One when I enable the Wifi on it.\nTo summarize, I want my Laptop with an internet connection to act as a WiFi router and access the internet from other devices (LG Optimus One with Android in this case).\nWhat additional steps have to be done?\n\n\nA: Since this is like the #1 question I get from students and newcomers to Ubuntu I will try to answer it with a couple of things everyone should know about Ubuntu in regards to sharing an internet connection. This is divided in 3 sections:\n\n*\n\n*Sharing your Internet Connection via a Wired Connection\n\n*Sharing your Internet connection via a Wireless Connection\n\n*Sharing your Wireless Connection with Mobile Devices\n\n*Connecting to a Wired or Wireless Device\n\nKnow that, in order to share your Internet connection either Wired or Wireless, you NEED to have at least 2 network cards, they can be a mix between a Wired card and a Wireless card, 2 Wired cards or 2 Wireless cards. The point is, you need to have at least 2 network cards, one card that receives your internet connection and another that sends it to other computers or devices on your network.\nSharing your Internet Connection via a Wired Connection\nConfiguring the PC that will share the connection\n\n*\n\n*Assuming you are receiving Internet through a second Wired connection or a Wireless connection, Open your Network Manager via the Network Icon on the Unity Panel:\n\n\n\n*Go all the way down to the Edit Connections option and click on it.\n\n\n\n*You will appear on the Wired Tab. Each Wired connection is by default related to each Ethernet Wired NIC card you have. For example if you have 2 Wired NICs you will see 2 options here. In the image below you see one since this is a Laptop and they normally have one. Select the Wired connection you wish to edit which should be the one connected to your LAN and not the one that is receiving the Internet connection. Double click on it or select the EDIT button.\n\n\n\n*You will appear on the Wired Tab (Again). This time, go to the IPv4 Settings if you are using IPv4 or IPv6 if you are using that one. On the Method option select Share to Other Computers. Now SAVE. You are done.\n\nThis will do all the stuff that was normally done 6 or 7 years ago with all the terminal commands and iptable stuff.\nNow just connect the 2 computers and you are done.\nNOTE: If both computers have a Wired Gigabit Ethernet NIC then you can actually connect them directly since most 1000BASE-T have automatic MDI/MDI-X. If not just connect them to your switch, router, hub, whatever and that is all.\nPC That will receive Shared Internet Connection (Depends on Network Setup)\n\n*\n\n*Open your Network Manager via the Network Icon on the Unity Panel:\n\n\n\n*Go all the way down to the Edit Connections option and click on it.\n\n\n\n*You will appear on the Wired Tab. Each Wired connection is by default related to each Ethernet Wired NIC card you have. For example if you have 2 Wired NICs you will see 2 options here. In the image below you see one since this is a Laptop and they normally have one. Select the Wired connection you wish to edit and double click on it or select the EDIT button.\n\n\n\n*You will appear on the Wired Tab (Again). This time, go to the IPv4 Settings if you are using IPv4 or IPv6 if you are using that one. On the Method option select Manual. The options in Addresses will be editable now. Add the IP you want, the Mask you need and the IP of the PC that is sharing the connection. In this case I said that the IP of the Client PC will be 192.168.0.2, the Mask is 255.255.255.0 to imply that is a Class C (LAN) network and 192.168.0.1 to mention that the computer sharing the connection has the IP 192.168.0.1 with it. Additionally add the same IP of the computer sharing the connection to the DNS Servers (As shown in the image).\n\nYou can also (Depending on the network setup) select instead of Manual, select Automatic and just put the IP of the computer sharing the Internet in the DNS Servers section.\n\nNote that this depends on the network setup. For example if you have both PCs connected to a switch or router, the switch/router will take care of the Client, so you only need to setup the PC Sharing Internet and just connect both to the switch/router. If by chance you are connecting the PCs directly together then it is better to do the additional setup of the Client.\nIn most cases, you will not need to setup the client, just connect to the network and done. Ubuntu will take care of everything. I just added the Client part for specific cases where problems might arise.\nThis should cover all the possible scenarios in a home LAN when one wants to share the internet connection over Wired cable.\nSharing your Internet connection via a Wireless Connection\nNOTE: Read below for Android user information.\nSince a couple of Ubuntu versions ago, there is no need for using masquerading techniques through terminal commands to share the internet connection. There isn't even the need to use iwconfig and echo commands to forward stuff. For the many computers and laptops I have tested (Almost 1000 with Ubuntu) I can frankly say for sure that with the following steps you can share your internet connection with no trouble at all.\nThis is the same for open sourced and proprietary drivers. I can confirm for example Broadcom, Ralink and Atheros chipsets wireless cards will work out of the box, they will work since NetworkManager will take care of the low level details. The latest versions of Network Manager, specially since 0.9.x are excellent in this aspect.\nStep 1 - Go to Network Manager and select Create New Wireless Network..\nNote that there are other ways, terminal and GUI like, that can also do the job, but this is the easiest and fastest way possible (Even faster and easier than doing it in Windows XP or Windows 7). Also know that I am assuming you are receiving Internet through another network card (Wired or Wireless) and you want to share this Internet connection wirelessly.\n\nStep 2 - Type name of SSID (The name that other devices will see when looking for the hotspot)\n\nStep 3 - As you can see here I put as the SSID name \"Ubuntu Ad Hoc Power\" and it has an encryption of WEP. The encryption type depends on the network card. Some cards do no support Ad-hoc with WEP, others with WPA, and others with any security whatsoever. After setting the SSID name and security just click create.\n\nStep 4 - For cases where you will share internet with somebody close to you on the same room, I normally just share the device with no security. Easier for them to connect. Of course do not do this in a party or in an office full of wireless vampires.\n\nStep 5 - When a shared connection is created, the next time you try to share it, it will appear in a connection list, saving you the trouble of naming the connection and setting security.\n\nAfter doing the above steps, you should have a computer sharing the internet connection with no problems at all. Now for the part that so many of us forget (specially me)\nSharing your Wireless Connection with Mobile Devices\nMany users always ask why doesn't my phone (Android, IPhone, Blackberry) see the internet connection shared from my laptop?\nIn many of this cases, Android, IPhone or Blackberry will have disabled the option to \"find\" Ad-Hoc hotspots. This is for security measures. So they will only see actual Wireless routers and not Ad-hoc enabled devices like a Wireless PCI card, Wireless USB card or even another Ad-Hoc enabled phone. To be able to do this, at least in Android you need to root the device. For IPhone you need to jailbreak them. For Blackberries is more complicated. I have only done this on Androids and Iphones. After doing this you should see the Ad-Hoc device with no problem at all.\nOf course this does not affect all models. Only some of them. Some you will only just buy and they will see Ad-hoc spots from day one. Others you will have to root/jail to fix this annoying problem.\nI don't know if I can recommend some sites or ways to accomplish this here but google is your friend. Anyway a quick way to see this is to try to connect another computer to the one sharing the internet. It should work. Another way is to look for another cellphone that can see ad-hoc.\nANDROID USERS\nFor Android users our sister site Android has a nice article on How to ROOT an android device\nI also recommend this article which talks about several terms we should know when working with stuff like this: Phone Hacking Terminology\nLastly, sites like cyanogenmod and tools like clockworkmod are very good. But always remember that with great root cow power comes great responsibility.\nFor example I have a Huawei cellphone that had Android 2.2 originally. After I rooted the device and upgraded to 2.3 using Cyanogenmod I could see ad-hoc devices which saved me from several problems and added a bonus to my cellphone for stuff like using it as a remote control for XBMC.\nI should also mention that I have read several of the answers in the Android SE site about Ad-Hoc support. Most are wrong in the sense that they confirm Ad-hoc not working on several older versions of Android (Version 4 and below). This is false since I have done probably more than 50 Android phones ranging from Samsung to Huawei and they all have worked. There might be some that do not get Ad-Hoc even after enabling Root and installing the needed apps but I have not yet come across one that had this issue.\nSo do not be discourage about looking to get your Ad-Hoc working on your phone. Trust me, it is easy. I hope I have shed some light with this to help you share quicker and easier and to understand when in some cases they do not find ad-hoc devices.\nConnecting to a Wired or Wireless Device\nTake a look at the image below:\n\nIf you click on the Network icon (The green circle at the top) it will drop a menu where you can see all the devices  (Wired Connections and Wireless Connections) that you can use to connect. By clicking on them, they will automatically connect to the desire network. In the case of having a Wireless card and have not yet installed the drivers (In the case you need drivers for them), you can visit one of the following links that provide the steps needed to correctly install any Wireless card:\nHow do I get a Ralink RT3290 wireless card working?\nInstalling Broadcom Wireless Drivers\nDrivers for Realtek wireless module for Toshiba C850-A965?\nWireless card Realtek RTL8723AE-BT is not recognized\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/tagged/wireless+drivers\nAs a bonus I recommend reading the How to connect and disconnect to a network manually in terminal?\n(In cases where the need arises).\n\nA: Assuming you followed the instructions fully, you need to \"connect\" to the wifi network just set up.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the network icon\n\n*Select \"Connect to hidden wireless network\"\n\n*Select \"UbuntuHost\"\n\n*Connect\n\n\nA: How to connect to Ad-hoc network Android 2.2 and 2.3 and more?\nFor this to work you need to have a rooted device and you need write access to the file:\n/system/etc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf\nThis is how it should look\nctrl_interface=DIR=/data/system/wpa_supplicant GROUP=wifi\nupdate_config=1\nap_scan=2\n\nnetwork={ # An open network\nssid=\"Ad-hoc ssid here\"\nscan_ssid=1\nkey_mgmt=NONE\nmode=1\npriority=1\n}\n\nnetwork={ # An encrypted network\nssid=\"Your Accesspoint ssid here\"\npsk=\"your wpa key here\"\nkey_mgmt=WPA-PSK\npriority=2\n}\n\nAuthor Zoppatorslk\n\nA: I have this same problem with my computer.

Note: I swapped the Ctrl and Cmd keys (Ctrl and Super on regular keyboards), but that should not affect the shortcuts I program.)\nFirst\nI changed the Switch application shortcut from Alt-Tab to Ctrl-Tab. It saves this correctly but the change does not seem to take effect. I rebooted and it still doesn't. Alt-Tab stays working and Ctrl-Tab does nothing. I know Ctrl-Tab is used by the Chromium browser, but outside the browser the shortcut isn't working either.\nCan anyone confirm this? I changed another shortcut in the Navigation section but this change isn't working either.\nSecond\nIn the Windows section, I want to change the shortcut for Close window from Alt-F4 to Ctrl-W (as it is in Mac and because the Function keys can only be used together with the Fn key). For some reason in some application through Ubuntu's defaults the Ctrl-W shortcut is programmed for closing windows already (although only a few) but it seems that in the System Settings it is as well. So when I click the Close window item and want to enter Ctrl-W as a new shortcut it closes the window. I cannot set the Ctrl-W hotkey anywhere since it closes the Shortcuts window as I type it.\nCan anyone using a regular keyboard confirm any of these 2 bugs? Does anyone know a solution for them? Anyone knows if these bugs are already filed?

Many of the manufacturers believe either by commercial purposes or security issues, that theirs drivers are the most suitable, and they have the power to make it open or closed source.\n\n*Producing open source drivers sometimes require a lot of hard work and reverse engineering, and because most of this work is made by people doing it for free, that's why you see more proprietary than open source drivers.\n\nA: *\n\n*If I have to determine what is your graphics card is.

Also, how would I go about adding multiple allowed commands?\n\nA: Ok, I found the problem (should have posted the contents of the script itself, that would have helped).\nSudoing the mount_synology didn't issue the password prompt. It was the sudo mount inside the script. But since I call the script with sudo there was no need to sudo the mount command.\nAfter removing the sudo in the script, it worked :)\n", "Q: What happens when I press buy button in software center?

I can't adjust the resolution on the external either.  I'm hoping that I just broke the monitor and not the computer.  Is there anyway to check this?\n\nA: If you are using 12.04, first is try to set the resolution of your monitor on the proper tool inside of the \"system configuration\" with the purpose of to make sure that the resolution can be changed without complications.\n\n\nIf so, then your laptop graphics (GPU) card is in good condition and you will only need to replace the crystal liquid display (LCD) and you also have the option of working with your external monitor only.\nThis and other characteristics can be configured in the same tool.\nIt would be very useful if you indicate us the make and model of your laptop with the purpose of knowing what graphics card it has and thus be able to give you an answer more personalized.\nBest regards.\nP.S.

I know that you can set the wget proxy by using export http_proxy=proxy_address, but that's not the setting where the gui saves the setting to.\nChrome for example uses the setting I deployed under System settings -> Network -> Proxy. Where is this information saved?\n\nA: I found the solution to my question just 2 days ago.\nIn order to be able to switch quickly between work and home, I wanted to write a script which changes my proxy configuration for all applications at once. Most of the applications were easy, they all had some kind of configuration file, for which I just created a copy to use for work and for home.\nThe system proxy however, is saved in gconf. To make switching easy, I went to the network settings, changed the proxy to manual and entered all my information for the proxy (host & port).\nThen if I wanted to surf without proxy, I simply had to execute the following command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy mode 'none'\nIn order to switch back to the proxy connection I had to use the following command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy mode 'manual'\nNo need to specify host & port again, since those are already saved. If, however, you have to work with several proxies and would need to switch between different hosts, you can specify the proxy data with the following commands:\ngsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy.http port 8080\ngsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy.http host 172.16.1.1\nChanges take effect immediately.\nSource\n\nA: Proxy Authentication is stored in /etc/apt/apt.conf file.

custom kernel, since linux 3.2.7, as listed in your uname -a output has a higher version number than the current release 12.04 kernel (3.2.0-29). (It's also lower than the current 12.10 kernel).\nLooking at the output of lsmod we can see that there is no module snd_usb_audio in the list of loaded modules. You need that to run most USB audio devices that use the USB standard for audio devices.\nThe locate command lists several snd_usb_audio modules, but not for your running kernel.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'd suggest you use a standard kernel and see if that doesn't detect and support your headphones. \n\n*If you have compiled the custom kernel yourself, you may wish to make that work, I'd suggest making snd_usb_audio a module by changing the corresponding kernel config variables, recompile the kernel, and run make modules_install as well as make install to reinstall the remade custom kernel. I recognize that this kernel may have snd_usb_audio linked into the kernel, in which case I don't know why the custom kernel isn't using it properly to install the necessary audio devices.\n\nCONFIG_SND_USB=y\n     CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO=m\n\n\nA: Based on the lsusb -v output, the Linux kernel's ALSA subsystem snd_usb_audio should be allocating the control and pcm devices for your device and drive them.\nLooking at this post, it might be worth trying that solution:\ngksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\nChange options snd-usb-audio index=-2 to `options snd-usb-audio index=1\nThen plug in your headset again.\n\nIf this doesn't work, please run lsmod and put the output in your question.\nIf snd-usb-audio doesn't appear in the list please try modprobe snd-usb-audio, and  capture /var/log/syslog from when you do. At that time please also check lsmod and /proc/asound/devices and /proc/asound/cards and look for the interface again.\n", "Q: Which key combination would allow me to pass parameters to kernel during boot I want to pass some parameters like the runlevel, nomodeset to kernel during the booting process. \nWhich  key combination would allow me to pass the parameters to the kernel, in redhat it used to just an arrow key to get to the kernel options.\nI had tried pressing and holding the shift key during the boot process to go the kernel options according to other posts but they didn't seem to help. \nThanks\n\nA: hold shift to get to the grub menu, then select the entry you want using up and down, then hit e to the edit mode.

Question:\nI need to give file create, read, write and delete access to /var/log for user bind only.\nHow can I do that, short of allowing read and write and delete access for everybody ?\n\nA: Never mind, I found the answer myself:\nThis is not possible with standard Unix-Permissions.\nHowever, that does not mean it's not possible on Linux.\nFrom http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialManagingGroups.html:\n\nAccess Control Lists (ACLs) are applied to files and directories. ACL\n  behavior is defined by IEEE's POSIX 1003.1e draft and supports\n  control/access of signals, TCP/IP ports (below 1024), raw sockets, ...\n  ACLs are an addition to the standard Unix file permissions (r,w,x,-)\n  for User, Group, and Other for read, write, execute and deny\n  permissions. ACLs give users and administrators flexibility and direct\n  fine-grained control over who can read, write, and execute files. \n\nAnd further:\n\nThe Linux 2.6 kernel (beginning with Fedora Core 2) supports ACLs for\n  EXT2, EXT3, XFS, JFS, and ReiserFS file systems.\n\nAnd from http://www.linux-tutorial.info/modules.php?name=ManPage&sec=1&manpage=setfacl\n setfacl -m u:bind:rw /var/log/DESIRED_FILENAME_HERE\n\nAlso, modern Linux is using ext4.\nSo note this:\nhttp://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/how-to-enable-acl-support-on-ext4-915306/\n\nYou need to remount the mount point -- in this specific case, the root\n  / filesystem, not just the desired directory. In other words, try\n\nsudo mount -o remount,acl /\n\n\nFor future, change the line in /etc/fstab to\n\nUUID=66eeee3e-b860-41b0-abf7-074c0e08420e / ext4 relatime,acl,errors=remount-ro 0 1\n\n", "Q: Which programming-model does Ubuntu follow? I am curious to know which programming model does the ubuntu follows in its own  development process; does it follow the object-oriented programming model (and use languages like python, java etc ) or does it follows the traditional procedural programming model (languages like C, ASM).\n\nA: In general, there is no stipulated language or programming model for Ubuntu.\n\nIn Ubuntu, you can use just about any programming language to create your application(s), so long as the language is supported via any bindings and libraries that it requires.\nFor example, you can write application for Ubuntu that target either GTK+ or Qt, which both support several languages (C++, Python, Java, etc). GTK+ specifically is written in C, but many applications which target GTK+ use Python.\nOther (non-default) targets (GUI related I mean), include EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) and Tk. Both of these have bindings in various languages.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, it really doesn't matter what you use, or which programming model (Object-Oriented, Procedural, etc) you prefer. Ubuntu is open to any of them.\n\nFor more you can see this site: http://developer.ubuntu.com - which will give you tutorials and other relevant information.\n", "Q: Macbook: To Dual Boot or to Run on a Virtual Machine? Just posting this question to ask this: Which is better, dual booting a Macbook (mid 2007 2,1 model) with Ubuntu (latest supported release 12.04) or is it just as good using a Virtual Machine such as Virtual Box or Parallels?\n\nA: If i were you i would dual boot. Running Ubuntu in a Virtual Machine won't give you the full experience and the full glamour of running Ubuntu in dual boot.\n\nA: I prefer VMs and use Mac/Parallels every day to run Windows and Linux on a Macbook Pro (2011).\nVM gives you history snapshots (great for safeguarding your VM environments) and you can just close/reopen them quickly instead of shutting down/rebooting the OS. And Parallels lets you flick between the VM windows or even run them mixed in same window ('coherence').\nI did try bootcamp but found no speed benefit (Windows running Visual Studio dev environment), VM feels just a quick.\n\nA: It depends on your your aim and what you value most.\nVM (Virtual Machine) is much more convenient, since you have total access to MacOS, which in many circumstances is priceless. But since you are not running native, it is slower. So avoid if you need full speed and memory.\nDual boot, i.e. running via BootCamp, gives you native access to the hardware, and so will give you the most power. But you have to reboot the machine every time you want to switch OS, which is a hassle.\nSo basically, unless you will be playing games or something similarly process-intense, go with VM.\n", "Q: Backup all home folders on usb disk and accessibility I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and have multiple family members working on it, each with their own home folder.\nI have an USB disk that I want to use to backup all my home folders. \n\n\n*\n\n*When my disk auto mounts, it is not visible for every user. It seems to be visible only for the active user at the time I connect the usb disk.\n\n*I want to create one folder per home on the usb disk to backup the data to. But when I format the disk in EXT4 or FAT for example it is Read Only. How can I format the disk so it is accessible to every user.\nBest Regards, Patrick\n\nA: The problem that you are having isn't related to the file system you are putting on the disk, it's related to how you are mounting it. If you want all users to be able to use the disk I suggest you mount the entire disk at system boot in by editing /etc/fstab or partition the disk with separate backup partitions for each user and mount those partitions by editing /etc/fstab. Permissions to read and write to the mount points you use can be handled by adjusting permissions at the mount point. If don't want everyone to have access to all the data, the separate partition per user, each with it's own mount point seems simplest. For more information on system wide mounting, please see this.\nIf something is unclear and you need further assistance, drop me a comment and I'll do my best to clarify the answer.\n", "Q: Single user rvm needs sudo, and adding users to rvm group I am following the instructions on the rvm site.

It appeared, but when I click on it nothing happens. Does anyone knows what can I do to fix it?\nAdditional info\nI can run it perfectly through terminal. My only problem is getting the launcher to work.\nTo create the launcher I used these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get an icon:\n sudo wget http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Matlab_Logo.png -O /usr/share/icons/matlab.png\n\n\n\n*Get the launcher file:\n sudo wget 'https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MATLAB?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=matlab-r2011a.desktop' -O /usr/share/applications/matlab.desktop\n\n\n\nA: Try specifying the full path in the launcher you are using. \nSo for example if the output of which matlab is /usr/bin/matlab, then change\nthe Exec field to \nExec=/usr/bin/matlab -desktop\n\nNote that if this does solve the issue for you it's likely because you have a script called matlab that is shadowing the original matlab command and so perhaps matlab is not receiving the -desktop flag which it needs to run when launched without a terminal. \nSee this entry for more details about getting the launcher to start properly by using -desktop.\nIf for some reason you still get nothing, try setting the type field to terminal application to diagnose the problem further. \n\nA: I had this same problem and many of the fixes I found didn't work.

I bought a new HDD (Seagate Barracuda 2TB) and connected it to my Ubuntu box with a SATA to USB cable that could not report SMART status. I copied all the contents of the old HDD to the new HDD (one partition with rsync, the other with parted cp) and then gently replaced the old HDD with the new one inside my aluminum enclosure.\nFor obscure reasons after reconnecting the new HDD through the old enclosure, the Linux box could not detect my partitions. I recovered the partitions with testdisk and restarted the computer. After the restart I checked the SMART status of the new HDD an I get this:\nRead Error Rate\n---------------\nNormalized 108\n\nWorst 99\n\nThreshold 6\n\nValue 16737944\n\nI got a high value on the Seek Error Rate as well. Wondering why this happens I copied 2 GB directory from one partition to the other and rechecked the SMART status (5 minutes later). This time I got the following:\nRead Error Rate\n---------------\nNormalized 109\n\nWorst 99\n\nThreshold 6\n\nValue 24792504\n\nAs you see there has been an increase in the error rate. I am unable to interpret these numbers. Is my new hard disk already dying? What are the acceptable values in these fields for Seagate hard disks? Then why the assessment is still good? \nWhile I could get temperature and airflow temperature data from my old HDD, I can not fetch them for the new one. I noticed that my old hdd had got really hot sometimes. Is it possible that the enclosure is killing the harddisks due to high temperature?...\nThanks\n\nA: As far as heat goes, when the temperature of a hard disk rises by 10°C, it becomes twice as much less reliable.  The normal recommended working temperature of a hard disk is 35-40°С. So if it rises above that, A lot of things can happen, like data corruption and data loss to crashes and even hardware failures.\n\nRead Error Rate S.M.A.R.T. parameter indicates the rate of hardware\n  read errors that occurred when reading data from a disk surface. Any\n  value differing from zero means there is a problem with the disk\n  surface, read/write heads (including crack on a head, broken head,\n  head contamination, head resonance, bad connection to electronics\n  module, handling damage). The higher parameter’s value is, the more\n  the hard disk failure is possible.\nThis is a critical parameter. Degradation of this parameter may\n  indicate imminent drive failure. Urgent data backup and hardware\n  replacement is recommended.1\n\nNow Seagate suggests that you use there test utility, and if the drive passes they claim that its OK.  For information on how to use that in Ubuntu see Ubuntu Forums.\n1Source:Acronis\n", "Q: Disabled Lockscreen on Ubuntu accidently, How to renable it? Okay,so few months back I read a post somewhere, dont remember where but it was on how to disable the lock screen. Now that I disable whenever the monitor switches off the system hangs. I remember Editing using gedit to do that. How do I re enable Lockscreen? I'm not talking about just removing it from the menu, im talking about disabling it completely. How do I re enable it?\n\nA: /etc/default/acpi-support deals with this sort of function.

Or at least, I should be able to to detach from that screen session w/o ending my ssh session .. right?  Doesn't seem to work.\nThis so that I can attempt to run firefox --display <whichever one is being forwarded to my ssh session>, so that I can debug a website that the remote Ubuntu machine is running (via localhost).\nBest case scenario is that I could just remote-desktop to my Ubuntu machine.  But it's not set up to allow remote-desktop, and I see no way to set it up remotely via shell/ssh.  Also, it sounds like you need a static IP in order to remote desktop to an Ubuntu machine (so I keep reading).\n\nA: Original Answer\nIt seems that your byobu installation has probably edited one of your login script files. You should search these, namely\n\n*\n\n*~/.bashrc\n\n*~/.profile\n\n*Possibly the system-wide files too\n\nfor byobu or screen - you can use grep or just open up the file.\nE.g. Open ~/.bashrc and search for byobu, namely something like\nif [ $SSH_TTY ] && [ ! $WINDOW ]; then\n    SCREENLIST=`screen -ls | grep 'Attached'`\n    if [ $? -eq \"0\" ]; then\n        echo -e \"Screen is already running and attached:\\n ${SCREENLIST}\"\n    else\n        type -P byobu &>/dev/null && byobu -U -R || screen -U -R\n    fi\nfi\n\nComment out this section to restore normal ssh behaviour.\nSee here for more information about this automatic reattaching behaviour.\nThis Is What Worked (see comments below)\nIn ~/.profile, comment out  _byobu_sourced=1 . /usr/bin/byobu-launch\nAnd if you're trying to launch an X11 Firefox session, just ssh -X <hostname> firefox (you may need to add the -no-remote flag).\n", "Q: Unable to use Phpmyadmin, settings prompt gives an error while installing I just finished installing Phpmyadmin on my old mac book, everything seems to be working fine apart from Phpmyadmin.

Painfully, the result was that everything got deleted. \nWhy is that so? ROOT didn't have permission to touch these, but it did anyways. I am confused now. \n\nA: The chmod command use 4 digits represented as User-Owner-Others-Others, this last one are other users not in the file's group. \nEach of these can have 4 (read) 2 (write) or 1 (execute), so chmod 0 file  do nothing.\nIf you enter man chmod you can see how it work with the numbers.\n\nINFO ADDED BY @Richard Nixon-\n You can't remove permissions to the ROOT but what you can do is protect a file from ROOT, thus any action on this will be in vain. How to:\nEnabled  -->  sudo chattr +i file\nDisabled -->  sudo chattr -i file\n\nIf you read the /etc/passwd file you will see that the ROOT have a UID of 0. \nIf a user have more UID, less permission (access to critical files, programs and more) will have. You can change the UID of a user incrementing or decreasing its permissions. So in this way you could change the permissions of another user to ROOT. How to:\nEdit /etc/passwd file with sudo vipw -s and equalizes the user permissions with the ROOT (fist on the list).\nMore information about the passwd file here and for vipw command type man vipw.\n\nA: When running as root a person or program can do anything on the computer--normal restrictions don't apply.

I am trying to get a PS3 Sixaxis controller to work with Ubuntu 12.04. The ubuntu wiki page for sixaxis says to install QtSixA, which I did. The issue now is actually using the controller. I installed \"SuperTux 2\" to test it out. Normally, SuperTux says there is no joystick. When I plug in the PS3 Controller, and press scan, it then displays all of the controls and their assigned buttons. I can then click on a action and it will prompt me to press the button I want to assign. The issue here that pressing buttons on the controller doesn't do anything. I can't assign any of actions to a button on the controller.\nThe same goes for PCSX. I can configure the controller, and select the Sony Playstation(R)3 Controller from the drop down, but when I try to assign a button, pressing buttons on the PS3 controller doesn't do anything.\nOn the web, I see tons of guides on how to connect with Bluetooth, but my computer doesn't have a bluetooth dongle, so I just want to connect via USB.\nIn addition, QtSixA can see the controller too. I can \"configure default profile\", which I have tried, but SuperTux 2 nor PCSX react any differently...\n\nUPDATE: Following the Ubuntu Community Guide for Sixaxis guide, I tried sudo apt-get install libusb-dev libusb-0.1-4 xserver-xorg-input-joystick, and then compiled sixpair. Running sudo ./sixpair complains about enabling bluetooth, then SuperTux 2 can't find the controller anymore when I click scan.\nAfter reading this article, I found out I have to press the PS button to get it working... Well, that worked fine for using the controller as a POINTER device. I can now make my mouse on screen dance using the analog sticks. I am still unsure of how to get it working with SuperTux 2 and PCSX though...\nWhen I didn't have xserver-xorg-input-joystick installed, pressing the PS button caused it connect to the PS3 in the other room as controller 2. I am very confused about what is going on right now...\n\nA: I have read something about it and I think it would be better to connect PS3 controller using bluetooth directly.

After getting the controller to read properly through jstest-gtk I had to go into my emulator and assign all the buttons.  (I had thought it would auto-detect the controller but it didn't.)  It works great; I've not had any problems with it.\nLike I said, I don't know if it will work for a PS3 controller though, but it might be worth the try.\n\nA: I installed joy2key which can be installed directly from the repositories of debian, once installed before you run the program/emulator you run joy2key --dev /dev/input/[device number] --terminal, you need to configure the analog joysticks, (there is a way to avoid this later but I haven't look how to write the configuration file), then you are good to go, I use it with MAME and others, I still can't make it work with some snes emulators, hope this work for any who need to use it with the USB port.\n\nA: You need to run this command in terminal:\nsudo xboxdrv --detach-kernel-driver \n\nhave a look at this.\n", "Q: Why doesn't \"su bind\" work? When you do apt-get install bind9, there gets a user bind created.\nI'm having some trouble with my bind installation.\n\nSee\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*How can I add file create read write and delete for a specific user?\n  \n*How to allow bind in app armor?\nfor more information on that.\n\nI tried to debug by suing from root to user bind (from root because I don't know the password).\nUsually this works for any user.\nBut when I type\nsu bind\n\nI get no error message, but the user on bash is still shown as root and whoami also tells me that I am still root.\nIf I do the same for any other user, bash changes to that user and whoami also tells me that I am this user.\nSo...  Why can't I su to user bind?\nThis is what an excerpt from /etc/passwd:\nroot@zotac:/etc# cat passwd | grep \"bind\"\nbind:x:107:119::/var/cache/bind:/bin/false\n\nI tried replacing /bin/false with /bin/bash, but that does not make a difference.\nSo what is the problem?\n\nA: A properly configured system, like yours, does not allow successful logins (even with su or sudo -u) as bind. But you can run commands as bind--even a shell, if you need to.\nWhy This Is (And Should Be) Happening\nThe user bind is not a user who should be able to log in. This is by design.\nbind:x:107:119::/var/cache/bind:/bin/false\n/bin/false is bind's login shell. false is not a real shell like sh or bash. Instead, it performs no action, and signals to the calling process that it failed. Configuring a user with /bin/false as its shell is one of the standard ways to make it (potentially) possible to authenticate as the user to run commands, but not possible to effectively log in as the user. When a user has /bin/false as its shell, this is what happens when the user logs on:\n\n*\n\n*Authentication occurs. Assuming it succeeds...\n\n*The shell, /bin/false, is invoked.\n\n*The shell immediately exits.\n\n*Since the login shell has exited, the login session is terminated.\n\n*Now you're back to being root, so commands like whoami show you as root.\n\nIf you change your configuration to make it possible for bind to log in, then depending on how you do it and other details of your configuration, you may render your system insecure. You almost certainly should not do this.\nWhy This Happens Even With /bin/bash Replacing /bin/false\nIf you modified /etc/passwd directly, I believe it is possible that cached data has not been updated. If you reboot, the problem will likely be solved. But as explained above, this is not really a good idea. If you haven't done so already, I recommend (carefully) editing that line back to the original version (with /bin/false).\nRunning Commands As bind\nInstead, if you really need to run a command as the user bind, use sudo to run the specific command:\nsudo -u bind command\nAnd if you really need to run a login shell as the user bind, use sudo to run a shell as bind, and tell the shell to act like an initial login shell:\nsudo -u bind bash -l\nReplace bash with the name of the shell you want to use, if different.\nThe -l flag makes bash act like a login shell (see man bash). This corresponds functionally to su - bind (see man su) or sudo -i bind (see man sudo). Except, the shell you specify (in this example, bash) runs, instead of /bin/false.\nIf you want something that corresponds to su bind or sudo -s bind (a shell that is not a login shell and that mostly keeps the caller's environment variables, including HOME), but runs /bin/bash instead of /bin/false, use this command:\nsudo -u bind bash\nIf for some reason you wanted to use su (running it as root) to run a command as bind, you can accomplish that with the -c flag:\nsu bind -c command\nThings Not To Do\n\n*\n\n*It's possible to use usermod to change bind's shell from /bin/false to something else. This would make it possible for administrators to use sudo -u -i bind or sudo -u -s bind, and root to use su bind, at least if done properly. But you should almost certainly not do this--it violates the design assumption that no one can log in as bind.\n\n*You can even run sudo passwd bind set a password for bind, so that anyone (except guest) can log in as bind with su, if they know the password. This would also make it possible to log in as bind on a virtual console, via SSH, and possibly even with the graphical login screen. Setting a password for bind is even worse than changing its login shell, and you should not do this.\n\nAs detailed above, you don't need to do either of these things.\n", "Q: What security policies exist in place for packages and scripts? I did have used Microsoft Windows since Windows 98 to Windows 7. I have found lots of security vulnerabilities by myself about how viruses, worms, spyware etc. compromises the system.\nMicrosoft Windows Vista & Windows 7\nUAC (User Account Control) system and Drives Autorun prompts in Windows Vista and Windows 7 can prevent some vulnerabilities.\nLinux\nI am using Ubuntu 11.10 now, and I realized that the most (except one) vulnerabilities does not exist in Linux because of multi-user system.\nThe Problem\nPeople (even I) used to store *.exe, *.cmd, *.deb, *.sh and other executable and script files (Installers, Portable Browsers, scripts, etc.) in pen drives (flash memories) and other removable media.\n\n\n*\n\n*When in Windows 7 (also in older Versions)\n\nIf the target removable media connect to an infected system,\n  then connect back to a fresh system,\n  and run a *.exe, *.cmd or *.bat (unsigned executable or script) file\n  that may prompt a UAC dialog\n  and user press Yes\n\nthis may execute malware code as Administrator, injected to the unsigned executable or script file\n\nI don't know about the signed executable files. Never tested.\nI think, they cannot not be infected or infected file cannot be executed.\n\n\n*What if, when in Linux?\n\nWill the same may happen in *.deb, *.sh or any other executable or script files in Linux?\nI mean\n\nCan the *.deb & other files be infected? (I think they can)\nIs there a mechanism in Linux to verify the contents in *.deb files?\nShould I not keep the root access required executable and script files in removable media? If I should not then what is the easiest way to manually verify if the file content was changed or not?\nWhat about the repositories and packages from Internet?\n    by using http, ftp (not https) the repositories and packages can be infected by an attacker while transporting or over proxies (if used).\nAlso is there any thing similar to Windows Autorun in Linux? (I think it isn't)\n\n\nI just want the Linux to be better secured in any condition (even from small mistakes from users).\nI will ask about further possible security issues I found.\n\nA: *\n\n*Security of Deb and Other Files\n\n\nYou can find a .deb file for a package somewhere on the Internet. Then you can use dpkg -i package.deb and install it. That's no better than picking up an install for Windows somewhere on the Internet. Don't do it unless you are absolutely sure of the source, and even then make sure you have all of the prerequisite packages already installed.\nDeb files, safe or not, do follow a format with hashes, etc. so that they have to be rebuilt if they are changed.\nPackage (.deb files) in the Ubuntu repositores are generally built from source on Launchpad build computers so the contents of the .deb file matches the source, and the source can be viewed by anyone. Many packages have teams maintaining them who follow them and are on the lookout for security problems. New source package versions have to be signed properly by gpg keys using public key cryptography before they can be built.\nThere are now binary only packages available in the Ubuntu Software Center, so the public can't view the source of those. I don't know about these for sure, but I believe they are reviewed before they are made available.\nYou generally shouldn't install a package with dpkg -i package.deb, but use apt-get or the software center instead, downloading from an Ubuntu repository. You should also avoid picking up any other kind of script that you can't look at and understand completely before you run it.\nThe multi-user system Unix-like systems do mean that if you make a mistake you can mess up your account and its files, but not the accounts and settings of other users that have been established on the same system, nor the operating system itself.\nThe exception is when you run a command with sudo or have to enter a password to install a package or do other maintenance. These are the times to be very careful about the source of what you are doing. This is very similar to using UAC.\n\n\n*\n\n*Executable Files on Removable Media\n\n\nAs long as you are using due care, I don't think you need to maintain programs on removable media. Like Windows, most programs are installed as packages and therefore aren't runnable from removable media (although you could put an entire Ubuntu on a flash drive if you want).\n\n\n*\n\n*Repositories\n\n\nAs I mentioned above, .deb files use hashes for the files they include to see that they aren't altered by an attacker. Ubuntu repositories also have gpg keys stored on your system when you install Ubuntu, and there is a signature and chain of hashes followed down to the .deb files to keep things secure. Ubuntu is derived from Debian and that project created this approach.\n\n\n*\n\n*Autorun\n\n\nThere are things like autorun in Linux and other Unix-like systems. When you install packages those packages can cause programs to start at boot time, or when a user logs in to a terminal, or when a user logs into a GUI session. Most users have a (hidden by default) .bashrc file in their home directories that execute when a user logs in to a terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*CD Security\n\n\nThe Ubuntu download web site not only has the .iso files for CD's and DVD's but also message digests (hashes) you can check to make sure the file you retrieved is authentic down to the bit.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ongoing Security\n\n\nDespite everything else, developers make mistakes and potential security problems can creep into software. Running supported versions of Ubuntu means that you will be offered security fixes for items in the main Ubuntu repositories, and often for items in the universe and other repositories. You should apply those fixes. Long-term-support releases like 12.04 (Precise) offer this service for a longer term than other releases of Ubuntu.\nI can't personally guarantee that the precautions are perfect, but I think they are pretty good for the current state of the art.\n", "Q: First boot after installing with DVD - Flashing white underscore I just installed Ubuntu from DVD, overwriting my previous Win7/Ubuntu dual boot.\nNow, the first time booting Ubuntu, it is just a flashing white underscore in the top left. \nI tried holding/pressing shift when booting to change to nomodeset but holding and tapping shift does nothing.\nI also attempted putting the DVD in, changing nomodeset and then \"Boot to local hard disk\", \nI got the same flashing white underscore again.\nAny assistance would be greatly appreciated, thanks!\n\nA: The system almost certainly had grub on it before when you could boot either Ubuntu or Windows. \nAfter repartitioning your disk you need to still use a boot loader like grub to start up the Ubuntu Linux kernel.

I installed Filezilla Server using Wine, that went fine, the server is running, but I cannot find the GUI anywhere.

However I have not been able to configure anything on the filezilla server because I can't see it anywhere.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: Ubuntu Server has no GUI, and Wine does not ruin without a GUI (Xorg).

When I was new to linux, I've never thought I can handle linux server at first glance. I thought this \"box\" is way smarter than me, and I still feel that way lol\nHowever, since you have ubuntu server installed on your computer, you can get any type of GUI by installing xinit,openbox (tons of GUI are available in linux world, openbox is very minimum one), aterm (choose your favorite terminal program ex:gnome-terminal,terminator) ,and pcmanfm (light weight file manager)\nlogin to your server\ntype\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade\n\n// you may need to run this command if you haven't never run that before.\nsudo apt-get install xinit openbox aterm\n\nsudo init 6\n\n// init 6 will reboot your computer\nlogin to server again\ntype \nstartx\n\nnow you can get very minimum GUI.\nThere will be nothing display other than mouse cursor, just right click on anywhere. You will see the minimum menu. when you open up file manager (pcmanfm) you gonna say, it's missing icons!\nsudo apt-get install lxde-icon-theme\n//this will install icons.\nI still recommend Ubuntu12.04 desktop for you.

The man page for the command \"rename.ul\" has disappeared and I would like to install it, read it on-line or whatever, but it would be better to have it installed as it was before, in the good times. It is a useful command and it is not a good idea to have its man page redirected to \"rename\"'s man page because it is a different command.\n\nA: If You Don't Have Any rename.ul Manual Page\nSearching the web-based Ubuntu Manpage Repository for rename.ul reveals that its manpage is in page 1 of the manual. Therefore, the name of the manpage file is rename.ul.1.gz.\nSearching the package contents for that file reveals the packages that provide it:\n\n\n*\n\n*manpages-fr-extra\n\n*util-linux\nUnless you want the French manpage, util-linux is the package you want for rename.ul manpage.\n\n\n*\n\n*It almost always works to simply search for the command itself in package contents, as the package that provides the command is virtually always the package that provides its manpage(s).\n\n\nIf you didn't have util-linux installed, you could install it. But this is quite an essential package, and it's unlikely you don't have it. So if you're missing the manpage, perhaps somehow that file was deleted. Then you should reinstall util-linux:\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install util-linux\n\nIf You Want man rename.ul To Give You the Old Manpage in Ubuntu\nNone of these six versions of rename.ul's manpage in Ubuntu show a separate manpage for rename.ul, different from rename. Please note that the ul in rename.ul stands for util-linux. The rename command in Ubuntu is provided by util-linux, so any other manpage for it would probably not correctly document the command.\nThere are other manual pages called rename. But they are for the system and library calls, not for the rename command.\nWith that said, if you find a rename manpage online, you can download it and view it like an installed manpage with man -C ./filename. Please note that the ./ is necessary when specifying a manpage located in the current directory with a relative path (just like it's necessary to run a script in the current directory).\n", "Q: Is there a way to cycle through workspaces?

Not exactly the way I wanted because I wanted to replace the current version permanently and to see it in application search. But it runs just fine for now. I created  a shortcut of the file and put it in desktop for convenience.\n\nA: Zekr version 1.0.0 is available in the Ubuntu repository. But, it is in multiverse section, so you need to enable multiverse repository first. See the below question to get help on enable multiverse repository:\n\n*\n\n*How do I enable the \"multiverse\" repository?\nAfter enabling multiverse, You can download and install Zekr on your PC. There is two way to install it:\nGraphical way:\n\n*\n\n*\nor clicking this icon\n\n\n*Zekr \nTerminal way:\nOpen a terminal with CTRL+ALT+T and type these commands\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install zekr\n\nNote, first command is not required if you have updated your repository information recently.\nI don't know the exact amount of change in Zekr version 1.1 from 1.0, but I think, installing 1.0 will suffice.\nHope this answer will help.\n", "Q: GIMP fails to load When I try to load GIMP, the splash screen flickers on, but disappears as soon as it shows.\nWhen opening through terminal, the following error is displayed:\n\nGEGL-geglmodule.c-Message: Module '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gegl-0.2/remap.so' load error: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gegl-0.2/remap.so: undefined symbol: gegl_operation_point_composer3_get_type\n  Segmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nAll help is appreciated as using it soon is required. >.<\nUbuntu 12.04 64-bit\nGimp version is 2.8\nThe following is an error I get when trying to 'Sudo apt-get upgrade'.

I noticed that the 12.04.1 will come soon and was wondering if the updates that 12.04.1 will bring are applied to 12.04 progressively until 12.04.1 comes out or are they applied all at the same time when 12.04.1 comes out.\n\nA: The point release essentially contains the bug fixes the version has gone since it was released to the public, which includes security fixes, package updates, translation packs updates, etc. \nThese point releases will include support for new hardware as well as rolling up all the updates published in that series to date. So a fresh install of a point release will work on newer hardware and will also not require a big download of additional updates. --Mark Shuttleworth this may be dated back but still holds true\nIf you update frequently you will essentially be at the \"point release\" as soon as the general release is made available. \n\nA: Yes, they are applied progressively, in fact, if you install regular updates, there won't be much to do when 12.04.1 gets out. You'll see the number changed in /etc/lsb-release, and that's about it.

Or is there a superior way for networking in an OpenStack test environment on a host with only one physical network adapter?\n\nA: First, forget virbr0 -- that's added by libvirt and is irrelevant.\nFor an \"all-in-one\" Openstack server with one NIC, there should be no need for another aliased virtual interface. As discussed in the Openstack guide, you should bridge br100 to your public IP address (eth0), and let Nova create instances and bridge them to br100.\ne.g. add the below to /etc/network/interfaces, modify as appropriate for static:\n\nauto br100\niface br100 inet dhcp\n    bridge_ports        eth0\n    bridge_stp           off\n    bridge_maxwait   0\n    bridge_fd            0\n\nThe allowable private IP subnet has to be configured via the --fixed-range option in nova.conf, and the --flat_network_bridge option set to br100.\n\nPlease paste your nova.conf in the question to help with further troubleshooting!\n\n", "Q: Problem installing NVIDIA-Linux-x86-302.07.run in 12.04 I have a catch 22 problem in trying to install this driver (NVIDIA-Linux-x86-302.07.run) to set my screen to its native resolution of 1280x1024 (hpL1906).\nProblem is that in order to install this driver, I need to stop the XServer but when I do this (sudo service lightdm stop), my screen goes blank and displays the message -\n\nOut of Range 1280X1024 need to reset\n\n(or something similar) - and I can go no further.\nSo, I cannot install NVIDIA-Linux-x86-302.07.run without stopping lightdm but when I do so, I can no longer see anything on the screen or go further to install the driver that would let me adjust the resolution.

I'm using Thunderbird for quite a while now and have successfully ported all my emails - some of them several years old - from my Windows7 setup to Ubuntu.\nMy Thunderbird contains five different email accounts, one of which is a GoogleMail account using two-step-verification.\nNow here's the problem: ever since updating to Ubuntu Precise 12.04, Thunderbird keeps forgetting my passwords. When trying to retrieve mails it states: 'login or password incorrect' for every single one of my accounts. I then chose to 're-enter password' and ticked the option to 'Use Password Manager to save password'.\nWhile this always worked, it never survived a logoff or reboot. I always had to reenter the same passwords after every logon again and again.\nHow can I force Thunderbird to actually remember my passwords forever?\n\nA: Scouring the internet for answers didn't help. I had the idea to purge-remove my thunderbird installation but I feared losing at least parts of my email archives in the process.\nLuckily, I found a solution that went almost hassle-free:\n\n\n*\n\n*open Thunderbird\n\n*go to Edit -> Preferences\n\n*open tab Security -> Passwords\n\n*open Saved Passwords\n\n*WARNING: The next step will erase all your passwords from Thunderbird Password Manager, so be sure to have all of your email passwords written down somewhere or saved by another password safe like KeePass!\n\n*click on delete all \n\n*close the window\n\n*in the main window, click retrieve all\n\n*when asked for your password, enter it and tick Use Password Manager to save password\n\n*send yourself an email from every one of your accounts and repeat the previous steps when prompted for passwords\n\n\nThat's it, your passwords should be all set again. Reboot (or logoff-logon) to test if they really stick.\n\nA: I tried your recipe but didn't work.\nInstead, I did like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Went to my internet provider website (where I paid my internet connection), in my case (in France) it is \"www.free.fr\".\n\n*There I login with my \"client account\" identification + password. This client account is the account where I could see all my subscription to my provider i.e: internet, mobile phone consumption, tv cable etc.\n\n*After login with my \"client account\", there is a section \"manage my email accounts\", so I went to the email account where I have this problem, and login with my email+password.\n\n*After this 2nd login, I can see several options such as 1) manage your spam filter, 2) modifiy your password 3) increase email stock capacity, and.... 4)manage SMTP authentification\n\n*So I click that option number 4) above, then it asked me if I want to activate this SMTP authentification, and I click \"YES\".\nAnd that's it.

I could now send email without being asked any password, and I didn't have to change me smtp to pop.\nI hope this help. \n\nA: I had the same problem (in linux mint 18.3), however I could't locate any retrieve all button. Here's my workaround: to paste in /home/username/.thunderbird/*.default all the content of the corresponding directory from windows, except for the file pkcs11.txt. Everything worked fine.\nI hope it could help someone.\n\nA: I had this problem for recent load from Win7 TB to new Mint19 install. Successful in getting emails when I typed password, but would not remember it even after trying numerous other remedies.\nRenamed pkcs11.txt file, reloaded TB and it now works.  I can see the saved password/account under Edit|Security|Saved Passwords.  Yeah! Now on to the the other 10 email accounts and typing all them passwords.\nThanks for this!\n\nA: I had the same problem on Ubuntu Linux with the Thunderbird mail client. Your suggestion that deleting the pkcs11.txt file from the used profile folder is correct. It also worked for me.\nUnder Ubuntu you have to go to the hidden folder ./thunderbird.

I think this should have been resolved and certainly isn't a problem in 12.04.\nIn general though, including for 12.04, there are problems with the touchpad and trackpoint misbehaving on Thinkpads in recent years.  There are a few workarounds.\nOne is to add the i8042.reset=Y kernel parameter.  e.g.:\nsudo /bin/sed -i 's/^GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"[^\"]*/\\0 i8042.reset=Y /' /etc/default/grub\nsudo update-grub\n\n... and reboot.  This makes the serial driver responsible for the trackpoints more inclined to reset itself, and seems to improve reliability.\nIf you have problems with the trackpoint disappearing after suspend, then the psmouse-suspend-modules package from ppa:jamesf/lenovofixes will make the system reload the relevant driver after suspend, which resolves a few issues.  i.e.:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:jamesf/lenovofixes\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install psmouse-suspend-modules\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 and NetBeans 7.2?

You can find the php class and explanation here.\nBut if I send my output to a file, and try to read it with vim it's not \"colored\", I just can see the special characters. Is there a way to display the colors like they are displayed in the shell?\n\nA: The terminal output will be colored if the content of the file will be sent \"as-is\" to the terminal, without any modifications. However, vim and some other editors will escape meta characters in the text and instead maybe add some other color codes for their syntax highlighting, so this doesn't work.\nTry dumping the file to the terminal with cat, this should work. Some simple editors or pagers like less might also work.\nEdit:\nI have not found a way to let vim \"pass-through\" all the escape codes, but I have found this answer which links to this vim script, which parses the escape codes and uses the vim syntax highlighting to recreate the color codes in the output. According to its description, it should do exactly what you want (but I have not tested it).\n\nA: I just found that there is a Vim plugin to deal with ASCI escape characters.

I hear and read great things about Ubuntu and figured I would see if it would be feasible to install Ubuntu onto my laptop and use the above software if I am up and about.\nI guess Linux will have to wait until the software above is made for it. Too bad though, Linux sounds like a really good OS.\n\nA: You can check Wine compatibility in their site: http://appdb.winehq.org/\n\n*\n\n*3DS Max 9.x is rated Silver, 2011, 2010 are rated Garbage, 2009 is rated Silver.\n\n*Maya is rated Garbage for the 2009 and 7.0 versions, 2010 is rated\nBronze.\n\n*Photoshop CS5 is rated Gold.\n\n*Zbrush 4R4 is rated Platinum.\n\n*After effects CS5 is rated Garbage, CS4 is rated Silver and version\n7.0 is rated Platinum.\n\nMost of your software has a good rating, but I'd recommend you to use alternatives, such as Blender for 3D, GIMP (I know is not as powerful), KDenlive for Video, etc. For the software that doesn't work I also suggest you install Virtualbox and create a Windows VM (this of course requires your Laptop to support Virtualization, which most likely does and that you have plenty of RAM and a nice CPU).\nBy the way, I don't know if you haven't heard of Ubuntu Studio?.\n\nUbuntu Studio is a free, open, and powerful operating system for creative people to create their art. [..]Whether your focus is audio, video, photography, or graphic design, Ubuntu Studio is both productive and rewarding to use.[..].\nAs an officially recognized derivative of Ubuntu, Ubuntu Studio is supported by Canonical Ltd. and an amazing and continually increasing community.\n\nYou can take the tour here.\n\nWine Ratings\n\n*\n\n*Platinum: Applications which install and run flawlessly on an\nout-of-the-box Wine installation\n\n*Gold: Applications that work flawlessly with some special\nconfiguration\n\n*Silver :Applications with minor issues that do not affect typical\nusage\n\n*Bronze: Software with major Issues\n\n*Garbage: Unusable software\n\n\nA: No you can't.\nIf you need to use these tools as an enthusiast, wine is great but if your life depends on it then I won't recommend that you use wine. Its important that you chose the right tool for the job, in your case the software you list runs natively on windows and you should chose that. Linux is awesome, it has its own set of advantages such as security, speed and also being open source.\nPeople will suggest alternatives like wine and virtualbox or vmware player and for enthusiasts it is just fine but for someone who makes a living using those tools, it might not be the best case. You are unlikely to get any support for Photoshop on wine if something was to go wrong.\nIf you do use any linux distro, then I'd suggest that you use alternatives that run natively on linux, some of them are really good and the others are slowly but surely catching up and with most software being available on the cloud, the linux platform will be easier to use for all pc users.\nIn the end its your life and your choice, all the very best. \n\nA: I am not a 3D artist, but I have used Blender for simple 3D stuff.\nBlender is a professional 3D suite comparable to Maya with 3D support.\n\nA: Yep, I think you sure can but before you turn over to Ubuntu please check the Ubuntu HCL (Hardware Compatibility List) to ensure your hardware is supported to make full use of your system. I would look for the Graphics card the ASUS laptop and check if it's in the HCL to ensure it works best for graphic designers. If you can't find your ASUS laptop on the list, look up the individual Graphics Manufacturers & Models in the HCL and check if your ASUS graphic card is on it. You'll have to hit Start > Run  and type in msinfo32.exe to open up the system information page in Windows and look for the Graphics card manufacturer & model on your laptop.\n\nYou can find the HCL here\n  http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/desktop/\n\nUbuntu would be absolutely great for designers and artists as it uses very little memory as compared to Windows (Being a Microsoft Certified System Engineer/Administrator believe me I know). So basically the applications can have all the free memory as compared to Windows which restricts to less than 4GB on the 32-bit Windows 7 version.\n\nPlease note: I do agree with Nikhil though. If it's something you make a living from I wouldn't recommend to move completely. Instead it\n  would be better to install Ubuntu on a system with Wine or VirtualBox\n  and test your options out. If they meet your requirements and you are\n  happy with the system, go for it.\n\n", "Q: No OS found when I boot with USB No OS found when I boot with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS USB.

Try to expand your question with more details.\nYou can install Ubuntu in a DVD-RW, yes.\n\nA: Unless it is a mac it is probably unlikely your computer won't boot from USB.\nThere should be a choice in your bios that enables you to change the boot priority. Find that, and you should be able to put the usb as boot priority or something similar. If that is not done, your computer won't boot from usb.

I am using Zoneminder with a USB web-cam and also analogue inputs from a PCI capture card.

Any other software or a hardware  requirements I need to understand.\n\nA: I am not really sure what you are after, but if it's more like you want a Main Ubuntu Server that has internet access and applications installed on it and you would like to have other clients to connect to it (locally) wired/wireless to access the internet and applications, I guess you are trying to build or you mean a THIN CLIENT Environment.\nFor that all you need is a Ubuntu Server with 2 NIC's (Network Interface Cards). One for the Internet (connected to the router) and One for the Thin/Fat Client computers. You can connect the NIC for the clients to a Wireless Access Point or Router (Disable the DHCP on router) and let the thin clients connect via the Wireless. The thin clients must use PXE boot which means it must be bootable via Network (Check if the BIOS has any such settings available on your client computers).\nAfter you complete the build, what will happen is that each client computer that boots off the network will run Ubuntu on it from the Main server. They don't need hard drives, just the bare essentials to start the computer into BIOS.\nTo read more about this visit the Ubuntu Community Help on Ubuntu LTSP Thin/Fat Clients and What is a Thin Client\nIf I wasn't clear please comment and I'll try and rephrase this post.\n\nA: Here is what you need if you just need a Server-Client Environment:\n1) Ubuntu Server\n\n\n*\n\n*Recommended System Requirements\n\n*\n\n*1GHz Pentium 4 should be fine (no need of fancy hardware, Linux works best on old hardware)\n\n*256MB RAM + 1 GB HDD (without GUI)\n\n*512MB RAM + 5 GB HDD (with GUI)\n\n**GUI - Graphic User Interface or Desktop \n\n*(More information available at Wikipedia and Ubuntu Documentation)\n\n\n\n2) Wireless Router\nYou can connect the WiFi Router to the ADSL/Dial-up Modem for internet access (if required). Enable DHCP on the router and have all computers and the Server use the same network.\n3) Build the Ubuntu Server using this guide \nInstall LAMP and other such services required and configure them to be accessable via the local network. \n\nFor example if your Main Server and Local computers are on the\n  192.168.0.0/24 network then you should be able to access these services via the browser on your local system by simply typing in the\n  Server IP address into the browser.\n\nIt might be good to look up SSH Server, Apache Server, Samba/File Share Server, OpenSSL & Print Server in the Ubuntu Documentation for other services - available in the server guide. It would be wise to look up Setting up a Firewall or Security in Ubuntu if you are going to expose the server to the internet.\nIf you already have the Server Hardware check the HCL (Hardware Compatibility List) of Ubuntu to ensure that you meet the required specifications or you may land up spending hours looking up Drivers or trying to get your hardware perform to its max.\nI hope this has addressed your question.\n", "Q: How do I change the theme and window border color? Is it possible to customise the colours for the desktop theme and window appearance in Pangolin 12.04 as it was possible in Narwhal?\nI only see four default choices in the display adjustment selection.\n\nA: You said, \n\nIs it possible to customise the colours for the desktop theme and window appearance in Pangolin 12.04 as it was possible in Narwhal? \n\nI assume, you are referring to the customization window in the theme in Natty Narwhal and previous distributions. Since, Gnome 3 is released, those easy customization options are removed default. \nBut, the good news is, the corresponding keys in gconf and hence dconf is available still now. So, you can change those keys using dconf-editor (dconf-editor or gsettings should be used instead of gconf, since settings are migrating to dconf).\nI've tested in Narwhal and found the corresponding keys, the path is  /org/gnome/desktop/interface and \nthe keys are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*bg_color - It refers to the window color. This corresponds to left color selection in Windows row  i.e 1st row in Narwhal.\n\n*fg_color - This controls the text colors in windows, menus, title bars etc. This is the right side color selection in Windows row (It does not change the text color in input boxes, nautilus folder pane etc, text in editors etc).\n\n*base_color - This controls the background colors in input boxes, nautilus folder pane, editor's background, search bar, address bar in browsers etc. Corresponds to the left color selection in Input boxes row in Narwhal.\n\n*text_color - This controls the text colors (foreground colors) in the above settings, such as input boxes, nautilus folder pane, editor's text, search bar, address bar's text etc. Corresponds to the right color selection box in Input boxes row in Narwhal.\n\n*selected_bg_color - This controls the background color i,e the color of any selections, when you select with your mouse etc. Corresponds to the Selected Items row's left-most settings in Narwhal.\n\n*selected_fg_color - This controls the text colors withing selection. Corresponds to the Selected Items row's right settings.\n\n*tooltip_bg_color - This I think self-explanatory. It controls the background colors of a tooltip. Corresponds to the  Tooltips row's first settings.\n\n*tooltip_fg_color - This controls the tool tip text color. Corresponds to the right settings in Tooltips row in Narwhal\n\nHow to set those colors:\nYou can easily set those colors in dconf-editor. Install it via  terminal with the command:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nor via Software Center \nNow, Open dconf-editor by typing the name in dash. To do so, Press Super and type dconf-editor and Click on the icon.\nGo to the path org -> gnome -> desktop -> interface and select gtk-color-scheme and input value there. Don't forget to put a ; after each key-value pair. For example, If you want to change the window color(bg_color) and window text color(fg_color) with some values, the line should be like this:\nbg_color:#2f568f;fg_color:#000000;\n\nGenerate color value:\nTo generate color value, you can use the Appearance Window in System Settings. To bring it. Right Click on Desktop -> Choose Change Desktop Background and in the Window, click the little color box below the big Monitor image. There you can see a custom color box. click there.\nAlternatively, you can use agave color generator. It is a very convenient and tiny tool to generate color value. Install it with terminal using the commmand:\nsudo apt-get install agave\n\nor using Software center \nType agave in the dash to open it after pressing Super\nChanging window border color:\nChanging window border's color of default Ambiance and Radiance themes aren't supported. Because, those themes use images as window borders. If you really want to have the ability to change the window border, I suggest you to use old colorable window borders such as Crux, Esco, Human etc. \nSome are included in the default Ubuntu installation. You can use those by using Ubuntu-tweak.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu-Tweak?\nAfter installation, open it by Pressing Super and typing \"Ubuntu tweak\" in the dash. Then go to Tweaks -> Themes and then change Window Theme.\n", "Q: Alt + ASCII code like in Windows \nPossible Duplicate:\nWays to enter special characters?

The compose key is defined in the Keyboard Layout -> Options window. \nOf course you can use the Unicode sequence to type in the first 128 bytes of ASCII, but it involves extra keys and keystrokes.

The question is, is it possible to achieve this without Sync?  Secondly, if possible, is it reasonable?\nMy first thought was to use Dropbox (which I already have set up on the two computers), and sync configuration files that way.  I'm guessing that would require symlinking in Ubuntu.  Could I then symlink similarly in the other operating systems?  Would this mean trouble if I have different versions of Firefox involved?

I'm running a more or less standard installation of Ubuntu Precise 12.04 and I am quite satisfied with doing everydays task with Unity desktop environment.\nWhen it comes to playing, however, I feel much more comfortable with LXDE (background: in it's current state, Unity archieves much lower framerates than e.g. Unity 2D or LXDE - it's a known bug and being worked on).\nFor that purpose I created a gamer user profile and now I want to restrict it to use LXDE  desktop environment only. \nTo elaborate this further: when asked to login after boot I want only LXDE to appear as an option for the gamer user profile at the login-screen while my standard user profile should still have the option to choose which desktop environment to use.\nThanks in advance for any insight that may be of help!\n\nA: Okay, from my understanding of LightDM (the login manager) it does not seem supported to restrict the desktop environments for a specific user. It is an all or nothing deal. By default, when a user chooses a desktop environment, that will become their default desktop environment. When they log in next time, unless they choose another one, they will be logged in to their default.\nYou can, however, make it so the user cannot change this. This user will still be able to select a different desktop environment, but if they do, it will not change their default. I believe this is the safest way to do this, if you are not worried that the person will change it. All you have to do is edit their .dmrc file (located in their home directory, i.e. /home/user). This is where their default session is stored. Change the Session variable in that file to whatever you want, i.e. ubuntu is the default Unity DE, ubuntu-2d is Unity 2D, and LXDE is LXDE. To make it so this will not be changed if they log in with another DE, we can simply make it immutable (unchangeable):\nsudo chattr +i /home/user/.dmrc\n\nNow no one will be able to change that file (root and other programs included) unless you remove the immutable flag:\nsudo chattr -i /home/user/.dmrc\n\nIf you absolutely DO NOT want this user to ever log in with another DE, I did figure out a really hacky way (i.e. do this at your own risk) to accomplish this. I was kind of bored and this seemed like a fun thing to try. All of the different DEs that LightDM can see are kept at /usr/share/xsessions as .desktop files. FYI, you can delete any of these you don't want showing up at the login screen (but that will remove it for ALL users). If you open any one of these, they are fairly straightforward. They are basic desktop launcher files, just like all of the shortcuts on your desktop. Each one contains an Exec line, which is what gets executed when you choose your DE at the login screen (i.e. which DE gets launched). We are going to take advantage of this and check which user is logging in. If the user is our restricted user, we will force them to use a certain DE.\nFirst, for each .desktop file in /usr/share/xsessions/ you will need to create a script in /usr/local/bin. For my example, I will be showing how to do this for ubuntu.desktop, which is the Unity DE, and using LXDE as the DE we are forcing our restricted user (restricteduser) to use. Looking at LXDE.desktop, we can see that the Exec command is /usr/bin/startlxde and there is no TryExec command. When you open ubuntu.desktop we see that the Exec command is gnome-session --session=ubuntu and the TryExec command is unity. The TryExec command is just what it sounds like. After running the Exec command, it will try running the TryExec command, but if it fails, it won't crash.\nNow, taking those commands we got from the .desktop files we can create our scripts. We will put them in /usr/share/bin. We will need to make two, one for the Exec and one for the TryExec. We'll do something like this:\nubuntude.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ `/usr/bin/whoami` = \"restricteduser\" ] ; then\n   /usr/bin/startlxde\nelse\n   gnome-session --session=ubuntu\nfi\n\nubuntudetry.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ `/usr/bin/whoami` != \"restricteduser\" ] ; then\n   unity\nfi\n\nWe are just testing whether the person logging in is our restricted user, and firing up the appropriate DE. Now, we need to make sure they are executable:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ubuntude.sh\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ubuntudetry.sh\n\nWe now need to change our ubuntu.desktop so that it will call our scripts, instead of the actual DEs. Comment out the Exec and TryExec lines in the file, and replace them with this:\nExec=/usr/local/bin/ubuntude.sh\nTryExec=/usr/local/bin/ubuntudetry.sh\n\nJust repeat the process for any other DEs you may have. If there is no TryExec for a DE, then there is no need to create a detry.sh script for it either, as LXDE does not use a TryExec. Obviously this is a bit hacky, and you should make sure that you back up any files before editing them, but it will work if you absolutely need to make sure that a user is logging in to the correct DE.\n\nA: on Debian Squeeze and Wheezy you can also add an .xsessionrc with a single line\nexport STARTUP=XXX\n(where XXX ist your forced session-script see Exec-Line above) in the user homedirectory to force a certain session type regardless of what the user has chosen.\nShould also work on Ubuntu.\n(Take a look into /etc/X11/Xsession.d/40x11-common_xsessionrc and 50x11-common_determine-startup to see, why this works)\n\nA: The answer from reverendj1 was not working for me. Reason could be that the value you specify in Exec= is not executed directly, but passed to the /etc/X11/Xsession as an argument. (source: https://askubuntu.com/a/857420/873016)\nAnother solution to the problem:\n1. Backup all /usr/share/xsessions/.desktop files\n2. Delete all /usr/share/xsessions/.desktop files\n3. Create only /usr/share/xsessions/default.desktop with  \n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Default\nComment=This session is the default session. It will look up the user specific desktop session in ~/.xsession.\nExec=default\n\n\"default\" is a key word for Xsession and will look up the specific session in the user's directory.\n4. Now create a /home/{username}/.xsession file for every username. For a \"kiosk-like\" app, this should look like this :\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd /home/{yourUsername}/ && ./startApplication.py\nlogout\n\nIf e.g. another user should be allowed to start a full blown desktop manager, it could look like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexec icewm-session\n\n\n\n*Make sure the ~/.xsession file is executable\n\n\nsudo chmod +x ~/.xsession\n\nTested on ubuntu 16.04 with lightdm\n", "Q: Problems with installing Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 7 Despite others, the installation shows \"Install alongside Windows 7\" option but when I select that option, it asks to remove the installation drive and close the tray if any and press Enter. \nAfter I press Enter, it restarts and opens Windows and when I put the CD-R again, it goes back to the option.

In Win7, do you have any malware protection EVER installed, other than the official Microsoft approved software?  There maybe remnants of the other-brand malware protector still on the HDD.\nRather than ordinary Ubuntu, I'd suggest a Rescue Operating System - often Ubuntu-based for greater compatibility for the full range of hardware/ software/ firmware that we all use.  Use that to reset your MBR.\nUSB sticks are faster than DVD or CDs.  Cheaper in the long run, since easily stored, rugged, water-resistant, tiny, re-used & updated.\n\nA: Try using WUBI.\nThis may help you install Ubuntu inside Windows and make an entry in the MBR.\nWhen you install Ubuntu through a disk, it makes an entry of available OS in GRUB whereas if you want to play alongside with Windows and Ubuntu, you can try WUBI, which makes an entry in MBR instead of GRUB, hope this helps.

No idea if this is correct or not.\n\n\nThis is what my files look like currently:\n/etc/network/interfaces\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.99\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.1.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.1\n\n/etc/resolv.conf\n#these are all commented out, I was trying ideas, but no combinations worked.\n#nameserver 75.75.75.75\n#nameserver 75.75.76.76\n#nameserver 8.8.8.8\n#search hsd1.nh.comcast.net\n\nCurrently, as with the similar question, I can ping every other computer on my local network. But as soon as I try to ping www.google.com, I get unknown host www.google.com.\nIf anyone has any suggestions, it would help a lot.\nsuggestion: Why doesn't this custom static IP network configuration work? (the first comment)\n\nA: Ok, I am not sure why, but I got it to work. I am not going to mark it as the answer until I am conviced that I solved the issue.\nFirst what I did was go to this tutorial, and noticed that they have search cyberciti.biz in their /etc/resolv.conf file, followed by the dns servers they want to use. Remembering that this \"search\" line is similar to the one that was automatically generated in my copy of the file, I formatted the file to look like this:\nsearch hsd1.nh.comcast.net\nnameserver 68.87.71.226\nnameserver 68.87.73.242\n\nThese DNS number I had to get from this website (I use comcast).\nI restarted the computer and magicly I can ping Google! Also, the search line has been removed from the /etc/resolv.conf file, but I think that's ok.\nAlso, I don't know if this helps/hurts, but I put in the line\ndns-nameservers 68.87.71.226 68.87.73.242\n\nin my /etc/network/interfaces file, as the last line.\nI will update this post if this turns out to work or not.\n\nA: Do you have a local DNS server in your LAN?\nIf not, try to put Google DNS or Open DNS in your /etc/resolv.conf.\nGoogle DNS is: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4\nOpen DNS is: 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220\nThe syntax is:\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n\nAlso maybe you need to restart networking after that, but I am not sure:\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\nOn Windows you would flush the DNS cache, but Ubuntu doesn't cache DNS by default I think.\n", "Q: Installed on separate hard drives, won't boot I just built a brand new computer, got Ubuntu running once before after install. /, /boot, and /usr on SSD, everything else on HDD.  Booting from live USB in order to install.\nLike I said it was running once before but I didn't allocate enough space to /tmp and it kept giving me a warning. I attempted a fresh install and now after installation it will not boot.\n\nA: This also happen to me with my first SSD. In my case the problem appeard whenever I removed another hard drive that did not have ANYTHING to do to where I had installed the system. My only solution after a very weird problem (I even checked to see if grub was installed in the right place and even ran the grub installed again just to make sure.) was to do a fresh install. Just backup whatever needed backup and format that SSD. But this time, I did not connect any other hard drives, just the SSD all alone. At least that way I knew it would work.\nThis only happen to me with the SSD, with the rest of the Sata HDD it worked perfectly anytime I installed. Maybe, this can help you in some way. At least reinstalling grub or updating grub with the SDD alone (No other disks connected).\n", "Q: invalid extent - grub rescue TRANSLATION\nI've Ubuntu 12.04 and ArtistX on a laptop with a external HDD.

De hecho ahora que he comenzado a probar Linux, hubo una distro que por desgracia no recuerdo, que a la hora de la instalación me preguntaba si quería instalar Grub o Lilo -no recuerdo cual- dándome la opción de instalarlo o saltarlo.\nDe todas formas muy muy agradecido.\nLuis\n", "Q: How do I find the dependencies when building software from source? Here is what I have done.\nI downloaded foxtrotgps.1.1.1.tar.gz as it is the latest to /home/crash/usr/local.src\nI extracted it to my /home/crash/usr/local/src as directory /foxtrotgps.1.1.1\nI then checked all the required packages for the correct level, and they were or if missing, I added them.\nSo I then go to the FTGPS directory and do ./configure, and it gets to where it says;\nNo package 'gtk+-2.0' found\nNo package 'gdk-2.0' found\nNo package 'gthread-2.0' found\n\nBut the gtk+-2.0 is there, but I don't find gdk or gthread. And it stops and goes nowhere. What am I doing wrong - what package dependencies am I missing?\n\nA: the proviso\nI'm assuming that you are using a recent version of ubuntu such as 12.04.  The versions in the repository are considered stable - so perhaps you may wish to use that version.\nHowever if you like living on the cutting-edge - compiling or installing from a PPA is the way-to go.  Just remember, this route can leave your system in a potential unstable state.\nhow to compile\nThe dependencies you need to install this are as follows:\nsudo apt-get install autotools-dev intltool libbluetooth-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexif-dev libgconf2-dev libglade2-dev libgps-dev libgtk2.0-dev  libsoup2.4-dev  libsqlite3-dev libxml2-dev\n\nRemember also to install the package build-essential i.e.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nso how did I know that\n... well I sort of cheated.\nSearch on packages.ubuntu.com for your package - I looked for foxtrotgps in the Quantal repository.\n\nLook at the resources and look for the debian.tar.xz file.  Click on it - it will open in the archive manager.  Navigate to the control file in the debian folder.\n\nIn the build-depends section are the packages Launchpad needs to build the source - its the same packages you need to install.\n\nA: Sometimes you can compile a new version without using the PPAs for the source dependencies, and use the great build-dep feature in Ubuntu. Make sure you have the source packages selected and have this line in your sources.list file:\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main restricted universe multiverse\n\nYou can check by entering in the terminal cat /etc/apt/sources.list.\nI have successfully compiled Stellarium 0.11.3, Scummvm 1.5.0, and others by obtaining the dependencies with build-dep; for example:\nsudo apt-get build-dep scummvm \nFor packages already in the repositories, you can check dependencies with:\napt-cache show foxtrotgps\nand compare that with the dependencies required for the newer version, which will be listed on the program's website, or in a readme with the source code download.\nUsually when obtaining the dependencies via the build-dep method you must then download the stable source code from the site of the program, and not the development or git version. It will not always be possible to compile a new version in this way, but it is worth trying. (Gimp 2.8, for example, requires a later version of Gtk and that can't be met by using the source files for Precise.)\nHowever, I have used the build-dep method successfully for Foxtrotgps; simply follow these steps (assuming you have installed build-essential):\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the most recent stable source code (version 1.1.1 at the moment) from the Foxtrot site\n\n*Open the terminal and enter sudo apt-get build-dep foxtrotgps\n\n*Uncompress the downloaded source code with tar xzvf <file> and cd to the foxtrot folder. Then run the following three commands:\n\n*./configure\n\n*make\n\n*sudo checkinstall (install checkinstall if you don't have it, or use sudo make install) \n\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the compiled program, foxtrotgps:\n\n", "Q: Windows computers cannot see my Ubuntu machine? Well I have a Windows machine and also a Ubuntu laptop, my Ubuntu laptop can see everything in the network, but Windows cannot see Ubuntu. Please remember that I am an absolute beginner to Networking and Ubuntu, so keep it simple!\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If I remember correctly, Windows does not(I don't want to use the incorrect technical terminology) recognize the format of the Linux OS, but Linux did program their OS to recognize Windows(ntfs). However you could write a text document with a Linux text application, and Windows would be able to open it with Notepad. For the most part you can\nopen, not everything, but Linux is way more flexible toward Windows.

I want to be able to connect to existing sessions, and have it start on boot. I followed this guide and have left a comment to try and fix my problems but no dice. I have also tried all solutions I have found on google, including the one here, but I could not get it to work (I am missing something easy I am sure).\nWhen I connect to the VNC session I get a grey screen with three checkboxes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Accept clipboard from viewers\n\n*Send clipboard to viewers\n\n*Send primary selection to viewers\n\n\nHere is my xstartup:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:\nunset SESSION_MANAGER\n# exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc\ngnome-session -session=gnome-classic &\n\n[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup\n[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources\nxsetroot -solid grey\nvncconfig -iconic &\n#x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title \"$VNCDESKTOP Desktop\" &\n#x-window-manager &\n\nI have also edited my to include:\n/usr/bin/vncserver -geometry 1024x768\n\nIt does not start on boot, but when I run the command it starts, but I get the grey screen.\n\nA: Check for solution on this link\nAlternatively you can edit xstartup file located in your home folder by running sudo vi .vnc/xstartup from the terminal.\n#!/bin/sh\n# Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:\n\nunset SESSION_MANAGER\n#exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc\n\ngnome-session --session=gnome-classic &\n[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup\n[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources\n\nxsetroot -solid grey\nvncconfig -iconic &\n\n#x-terminal-emulator -geometry 1280x1024+10+10 -ls -title \"$VNCDESKTOP Desktop\" &\n#x-window-manager &\n\n\nA: There are a number of things which can cause the grey screen problem. Your best bet is to look at the log file in .vnc to see what the error is. The log file name is hostName:display#.log, for example, on my machine, whose name is \"golden\", it was golden:1.log. \nIn my case the ./vnc/xstartup file did not have the right permissions, so chmod +x ./vnc/xstartup fixed the problem.

When the event that triggered the problem occurred, I did not react proactively. But now, having fixed the problem, I know this can be an issue: password length.\nI have run installations with passwd longer then 8.  Don't know why, but it does happen.  Others, not.  The system tends to prompt you that passwords will be truncated to 8 characters.  That is a signal.  A good behavioural rule is stick with 8 and tunnel via SSH.\nThe moment the passwd was changed back to 8 characters, vnc was functioning as expected.\n\nA: In my case, all of my storage are full. Deleting files to have vacant space plus restarting the service fixed it.

Naturally, I want my vnc to have the same gnome-classic look and feel. \nI tried various solutions from other posts, but either get the grey screen or the Unity DM. Finally, I tried the answer posted by gilatpr, and that worked for me with a very minor tweak. The logs indicated --session=gnome-classic & is unknown.

Is there someone who knows this?\n\nA: You can back up windows 7 to an other drive, but windows does not like to run  from it.  It is a lot more easy to put Ubuntu on an second drive and run it.  I am assuming you are talking about an external hard drive.  If you have the space you, can partition your drive for Windows and Ubuntu. Ubuntu needs 5 to 10 gb to install, but you should give it as much as you can.  Back up Win 7 first and then you can use Ubuntu's installer to partition your primary drive, or to install Ubuntu to the secondary drive.  Please backup first, and read carefully the installers questions.  Primary drive should be label sda, and secondary will be sdb.  Good luck.\n\nA: I suggest you use a program called dd.\nIf you use dd you can create a full image back up of the drive.

I can install Ubuntu on the machine fine but it runs to heavy for the machine.\n\nA: The most obvious difference between Lubuntu and Ubuntu that could make them behave differently so early in the boot process when booting from external media is that they have separate .iso images.

I lock my computer a lot, and was wondering if there was a way to get the lock screen when I hit Ctrl + Alt + L. Right now when I use that key combination it turns the screen black, and I have to hit a key or click to bring up the screen where it shows the option to enter your password or switch users, as well as displaying the desktop background behind it. \nIs there anyway to avoid having to hit that extra key, to bring up the screen I want? And is there anyway to keep it that way? It's really a matter of personal preference, and I don't see any reason why not to have it stay that way as my monitor eventually is turned off and/or my computer suspended. \n\nA: Unfortunately, the lock-screen utility xdg-screensaver lock (formerly gnome-screensaver-command), which the Ctrl+Alt+L shortcut uses, will also activate the blank-screen \"screensaver\" whenever it is told to lock the screen.\nThe trick then is to \"fake\" a keystroke immediately after the screen is locked to get rid of the blank-screen and leave the lock-screen on. We'll do this with xdotool, a small command-line utility which allows automation of keyboard and mouse clicks/movements.\n\n*\n\n*Install xdotool with\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n\n*Paste the following to a file in your home directory, such as locknoblank.sh:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\ngnome-screensaver-command -l\nxdotool sleep 1 key Ctrl\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This simply locks the screen normally, but one second later, sends a dummy Ctrl keystroke to \"unblank\" the screen.\n\n\n*Make the file executable with\nchmod +x ~/locknoblank.sh\n\n\n\n*Go to System Settings...Keyboard...Shortcuts and remove Ctrl+Alt+L as the lock-screen shortcut so we can re-use it for our custom command. Click on \"System\" on the left sidebar, then click on the right of \"Lock Screen\" where it says \"Ctrl+Alt+L\"; it will now say \"New Accelerator...\". Press Backspace to remove the shortcut.\n\n\n\n*Now go to Custom Shortcuts on the left, and add a shortcut, naming it whatever you want to with the command as /home/username/locknoblank.sh. Click Apply, then click on its right where it says \"Disabled\" to get \"New Accelerator\", and press Ctrl+Alt+L.\n\nClose System Settings, and you're done!\n\nTo prevent reactivation of the screensaver (idle timeout)\nOpen a terminal, and type/paste:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 7200  # Blank Screen Delay\n\nThis sets the screensaver idle activation time to 2 hours (or 7200 seconds).

All our applications are running very very slow... Please suggest a way to make the applications run faster...\n\nA: You first need to determine what is the root-cause of things running slowly.\nI suggest to strace the apache process like this:\nFirst, determine the process id of the parent apache process by running:\n$ ps axu | grep apache | grep root\n\nThe first number in the output (2nd field) should list the process-id.

It should make it very clear where are you spending your time or getting stuck.  Please note that system calls that are blocking by nature, like select or accept would normally block until an external event occurs, so they are expected to not return immediately and take longer to complete. \nYou can also add -o filename to strace in order to save the output in a file for later inspection.\nSometimes hardware issues cause things to run slowly.

I hear people say \"shell scripting\", \"bash scripting\". \nI wonder are they same? Or they are different?\n\nA: Bash (bash) is one of many available (yet the most commonly used) Unix shells. Bash stands for \"Bourne Again SHell\", and is a replacement/improvement of the original Bourne shell (sh).\nShell scripting is scripting in any shell, whereas Bash scripting is scripting specifically for Bash. In practice, however, \"shell script\" and \"bash script\" are often used interchangeably, unless the shell in question is not Bash.\nEDIT: Actually, the default scripting shell in Ubuntu is dash, while the default interactive shell (what you get if you pull up a terminal) is Bash. Nonetheless, the two terms are still mostly interchangeable.\n\nA: There are multiple shells available for Ubuntu, like bash, zsh, ksh, tcsh and csh.\nSo anytime someone says shell, he is talking about one of those. However, those shells differ a bit from each other. So, when someone talks about bash scripting, he's using a shell, but when someone is talking about shell scripting, he isn't per se using bash. But as bash is commonly used in scripting for Ubuntu, he usually is. Moreover, the different shells are the same in lots of aspects, so it usually doesn't matter.\n\nA: Shell script would be defined as a portability oriented script which can be run by a system shell of POSIX-compliant OSs. Syntax would be identical or similar with the shell scripting language syntax defined by the POSIX standard. That is the standard for most POSIX compatible OSs, like Linux/Unix/*BSD etc. POSIX is the most common ground for compatibility across Operating Systems.\nDifferent OSs from the aforementioned implement different shells for the non-interactive usage (ie. to execute system scripts or scripts that use #! /bin/sh shebang) which beside implementing POSIX commands and syntax, have their own extensions or can possibly be stripped out of some less useful features for performance reasons, but the POSIX ground allows for a very high level of portability of scripts designed for different POSIX-compliant Oss. \nMost aforementioned OSs have separate interactive shell which is usually fully-featured bash. Bash is POSIX-compliant in large part, but also has a big pool of additional commands and supports different syntax. Starting Bash with the --posix command-line option or executing ‘set -o posix’ while Bash is running will cause Bash to conform more closely to the POSIX standard by changing the behavior to match that specified by POSIX in areas where the Bash default differs, see: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-POSIX-Mode.html\nShebang specifier and uniform paths for shell executables on Unix-like OSs\nThanks to the uniform rules on placing executables for shells (they are usually in '/bin/' directory), we can have uniform rules for creating shell scripts, more specifically, we are clear what path to put in the shebang expression to point at a proper shell executable to run the script. Unix/Linux/*BSD file systems don't support extensions intrinsically, so the file extensions serve only as an additional hint, or for indexing purposes.\nOn Debian/Ubuntu specifically, bin/sh is a symlink pointing to bin/dash which is an executable of a dash shell. That makes dash the system shell, which is estimated to be 4x faster and is ~1/10 size than the more functional bash. source: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/148035/is-dash-or-some-other-shell-faster-than-bash\nDebian/Ubuntu interactive terminal is by default, as in many other Unix-like operating systems, bash, for which the path is also uniform: /bin/bash.\nPOSIX.1-2017 standard: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/xrat/V4_xcu_chap02.html\nGeneral rule would be:\n\nIf a command or option isn't defined by POSIX, then don't put it in a\n  #! /bin/sh script in the first place.\n\nConvert your script or check for errors\nFor converting your script from bash to POSIX form, you may want to automatically check for bugs in your shell script or see what changes in your bash script you should make to make it POSIX compatible:\nhttps://www.shellcheck.net/\nhttp://mywiki.wooledge.org/Bashism\n\nA: Introduction\nShell scripting and Bash scripting are not the same thing, as other shells exist such as sh that can be used to execute a script; a script intended to be executed by Bash should be labelled as a Bash script. The terms are often used interchangeably because Bash, with its extended functionality as compared to sh, is the one most commonly used to execute user scripts in many distributions. However, there are other shells such as the Korn (ksh), C shell (csh) and the Z shell (zsh), but we will not go into them here as a discussion of sh and bash is most relevant to Ubuntu. A great IBM article here goes into more detail on the evolution of shells in Linux and describes well the shell architecture and how shells differ.\nShell Scripting\nSh was the original Unix shell developed by Stephen Bourne; however Debian based systems and Ubuntu considers dash as their sh shell (sh is actually symlinked to dash). In Debian and Ubuntu, because of the speed of sh, it is more often used for critical system procedures and for executing key scripts at startup; for more detail see the Ubuntu wiki.  Bash stands for the Bourne Again SHell and was developed later by Brian Fox and much extended the original sh. Fox and others' development of Bash was an important part of the GNU project. See this great discussion of the history of Bash for more information.\nIt is important to note that both sh and Bash, as used in Ubuntu and other distributions, are POSIX compliant, which means they subscribe to a number of standards about how commands are executed in the Shell. This is to ensure that the results  of scripts used in the OS can be predicted reliably, and that the behaviour of the shell can be kept within those POSIX parameters, as that is particularly important for developers. For more information on the standards, see the official documentation.\nOften shell scripts have the suffix .sh, even though they are intended to be executed as bash scripts, and have #!/bin/bash at the top of the script. It actually does not matter whether the script is called script.sh or my.script, what matters is whether the call to the interpreter is /bin/sh or /bin/bash. Shell scripts can also be called on the command line with either sh or bash.\nHowever, it is important to note that the results can be different depending on which interpreter is called, as not all bash commands will work in sh, whereas most sh commands will work in bash. In general, most users will want to use /bin/bash for their scripts so they can take advantage of the extended feature set; system scripts can be executed with /bin/sh if it is required.\nResources for Bash Shell scripting\nIt is sometimes difficult to find useful resources online that follow good practice and that give advice that will allow you to create useful scripts. After man bash, some of the most important resources are Greg's wiki, Bash hackers and Steve Parker's recent book on Shell scripting that focuses mainly on Bash and is published by O'Reilly. A good introduction is also undertaken by the Bash beginner's Guide.\n\nA: $ ls -l /bin/sh\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Mar 29 11:53 /bin/sh -> dash*\n$ ls -l /bin/dash\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 109768 Mar 29 11:53 /bin/dash*\n$ ls -l /bin/bash\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 955024 Apr  3 08:58 /bin/bash*\n\nThis shows that 'sh' is a symlink to 'dash', and that /bin/bash, which is the default interactive shell on Ubuntu, is an executable that is almost 9 time bigger than /bin/sh.\nIndeed, 'man sh' (1590 lines) vs 'man bash' (5459 lines) reveals that bash is a large superset of the traditional 'sh'.\nRead more here:\n\n\n*\n\n*bash on wikipedia\n\n*dash on wikipedia\n", "Q: Gnome Mail Icon from top bar shows number of unread email I'm very new to Ubuntu so please bear with me.

I have setup LAMP on my ubuntu 12.04 system. I want to set password for all the files inside the root folder of Apache, so that only authorized people can use them. How do I set password for the folders?\n\nA: You don't want to password protect the files in this instance, but rather decide who should be allowed to touch the files. It is the user accounts that should be protected with passwords (or other means like keys). Anything else would apply sharing passwords between users, which is Always Wrong. \nWhat you want to do, is to set ownership of the files and directories. That's simple: chown -R www-data:groupname /siteroot (siteroot is the directory that contains the files you want to protect). \nIn the example above, I've set ownership to www-data because this user needs access in order for you to publish these files. I've set \"groupname\" as the group owner. You can use your own primary group, which is the same as your username. In this case, only you and the server will be able to manage those files. \nIf you want more than one local user to be able to manage the content, then you want to create a new group, add the relevant users to that group and make that the group owner. Let's say you want the existing users \"joe\", \"john\" and \"gina\" to be allowed to read and edit the files in the /var/www/ directory. Everyone else should have no access to that folder at all. \n\naddgroup mysite-editors\nadduser joe mysite-editors\nadduser john mysite-editors\nadduser gina mysite-editors\nchown -R www-data:mysite-editors /var/www/*\nchmod o-rwx -R /var/www\n\nThe last line is what removes \"others\" rights to read, access or write to any files in /var/www. \n\nA: You can use Basic authentication to do that. For example: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a htpasswd file in apache folder (You can create this anywhere)\nhtpasswd -c /etc/apache2/passwd username\n\n\n*Now add the below content to / directive:\nAuthType Basic\nAuthName \"By Invitation Only\"\nAuthUserFile /etc/apache2/passwd\nRequire valid-user\n\nsource: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/auth.html\n", "Q: how to keep track of where I spend my time?

I decided to go for the 64-bit version since I have 6 GB of RAM. \nI've followed this guide to make sure everything worked properly and to use the Windows 7 bootloader. However, even after following the guide all the way through, I am not able to start Ubuntu in any way. When I choose Ubuntu from the startup menu, I get to a command line version of grub (if using EasyBCD default settings) or an error (if manually setting EasyBCD). \nI tried reinstalling Ubuntu in any possible way: I shrank the Windows partition with the Win7 utility; I tried letting the Ubuntu installer create the partition or creating them manually as the guide specifies. Nothing works and in no way I am able to start Ubuntu. \nAt this point, I still have 170 GB of space that I squeezed out of my hard drive and I can start over once again, but I think the guide I was trying to follow has something wrong, or I am missing something. Can anybody point to a solution?\n\nA: I finally found a solution to this problem. As I said, the problem seems to be that the installer can't correctly recognize the startup partition and install grub correctly since there are 4 separate partitions used by Windows and by the one key recovery system installed by Lenovo (correct me if I'm wrong, I'm just assuming). Since Lenovo doesn't provide the Windows disc, but only recovery discs to reset to factory default, the only way to make the dual boot work is to \"fix\" the installation of grub (this is quite annoying since you will always be stuck with bloatware). Luckily, there is a way to do this, explained in this tutorial. I believe there are other people out there having this same problem with Lenovo laptops. I hope this helps.\n\nA: You shouldn't have to configure anything by yourself.

The bug was fixed on August 7, 2012, and can/should be fixed with the regular Update Manager updates. See this answer if you would like to install it manually.\n\n\nThis bug is special in two ways from a lot of other garden-variety bugs ;) \n\n\n*\n\n*It's a regression (when an update causes something that was working just fine earlier to stop working)\n\n*It's \"critical\" importance (anything that causes most Canon printers to print out half-pages should!)\n\n\nSo, it will definitely show up in 12.04 updates soon, considering that it took 3 days to fix it for Quantal. \nI strongly advise waiting for the above. In theory, you can install the Quantal debs, but CUPS is not a solitary package -- it has tons of dependencies which you'd also need to install manually. In short, this route can get VERY messy. \nIn the meanwhile, the more practical option is to downgrade to the previous CUPS version which works just fine. Do this with:\nsudo apt-get install cups=1.5.2-9ubuntu1\n\nTo prevent upgrading it until a fixed version is released, hold it with:\nsudo sh -c \"echo cups hold | dpkg --set-selections\"\n\nand keep an eye on the bug report page. When a fix is available, you can install it and release the hold with:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cups\n\n", "Q: can't find connect to server (SMB) on fresh ubuntu 12.04 I can't find the connect to server dialog that had the SMB mount option?\nwas it removed? is there an alternative?\n\nA: It's sitting under Nautilus's File menu on my computer.\n", "Q: Replacing a disk in zpool I am using Ubuntu 12.04 & Zfs Native.

Instead of doing a zpool import as a generic 'import all pools' specifying the pool name after the import command allowed the pool to be imported with one failed / missing drive.\nSo instead of typing 'zpool import' only, type 'zpool import your pool' and it will import.\nThis worked for me, then I was able to start with the drive replacement commands.\n", "Q: How to remove individual webapps from Launcher Today my launcher looks like a long vertical bar of icons. I have 14 webapp icons on the launcher but there is no option to remove them or an option to no include them (Or even an option to merge them as I asked in a previous question). Is there an option, without having to disable the whole webapp idea, to remove individual webapps from the launcher.\nForgot to add that the option to Unlock from Launcher does not appear, but only on the webapps. On the rest of the launcher icons it appears correctly.\nThis is an image of the actual problem (Thanks to koma):\n\n\nA: Right click on the application and select \"Unlock from Launcher\":\n\nThough the application itself will still remain in the application lens in the Unity  dash, to remove an application from there follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to remove icons/shortcuts from Unity menu?\n\nA: I'm fairly certain this is a bug.  I've filed a bug report about it here.\n\nA: I had the same issue with Pandora and fixed it the following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lock the webapp to the launcher.\n\n*Close all instances of the webapp.\n\n*Use the webapp icon in the launcher to load the webapp.\n\n*Close the webapp.\n\n*Unlock the webapp from the launcher and it will not reappear on launcher next time you visit the site.\nHowever, this does not stop the webapp from appearing in the dash. Also right clicking the Pandora webapp in the dash does not give me the option to uninstall like with the built in Amazon webapp despite Pandora being supported.\nThis does appear to be a bug.\n\nA: The above two solutions do not work.\nAs mentioned above there is no option to 'unlock from launcher', unless you have previously locked the icon to the launcher. \nAs i understand it, locking to the launcher means that the icon will show up regardless of whether the webpage is open or not. If it is unlocked it will disappear when the webpage is closed and reappear when it is opened. \nHowever to remove the icon from the launcher, so that it does not appear regardless of whether you visit the webpage you have to uninstall the relevant webapp from the software centre.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open software centre\n\n*search for the specific web app eg.\"unity-webapps-gmail\" or \"unity-webapps-googledocs\"\n\n*Click uninstall\n\n\nAnswer is here:http://askubuntu.com/questions/166655/how-do-i-remove-a-website-from-ubuntus-web-applications?rq=1\n", "Q: Internet Proxy / Usage Monitoring Server I have a Dell PowerEdge Server and I want to make it into a whole site (location) proxy server so if anyone in the building uses our internet connection, they will have to go through this proxy to get out.  I want to be able to block certain internet sites as well as monitor unproductive internet usage.  (Search by user, date, time, site visited...)  I would also like to restrict with username and password who is allowed to connect to the proxy.\nI have a PowerEdge server running Ubuntu and an Ethernet switch.  Do you know what hardware I need to do this and what software I need to be running and how to configure it?  It would also be nice if it had a nice web interface and/or GUI to configure/search/monitor usage.  \nI have already looked into Squid, but it didn't seem like it did everything I am looking to do.  Maybe I am not configuring it correctly or I need other software to run along side it?\n\nA: How many users you need to support in total and concurrently will determine how much hardware you need. A single server can potentially handle many users but it depends on the number of users and the hardware capabilities.\nI don't know of a turn-key solution on top of Ubuntu that does exactly what you are describing, but I think you are definitely right to look at Squid. As you saw Squid by itself does not do everything you want, but it has good authentication capabilities you can configure depending on your environment.\nFor content filtering and blocking Squid will work with Dan's Guardian which lets you block sites according to your own customization or pre-defined blacklists or keywords and such.\nFinally, there are a number of ways to view and analyze the logs which are general or specific to Squid. /var/log/squid/access.log is in a plaintext format and you can view it in a nice graphical format with Squid-specific log viewers such as SqStat or Calamari (which seem to be no longer maintained) or SquidAnalyzer which looks like it is more current. You can even import it into Excel or OpenOffice Calc or similar to create a custom report based on the data.\n", "Q: Do I really need the \"Source Code\" in my repository list? It takes a long time to update my software sources when I run:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nI believe that happens when the apt-get is downloading source code from the repository, in my case it the one in Ethiopia. It really slows down when it hits something similar to:\nhttp://et.archive.ubuntu.org .... \nI checked where I added that source and it was under the source code option. Do I need the source code to be downloaded? If not, can I un-check that option with out any consequences?\n\nA: Unless you are planning to modify the software yourself then you can safely disable it. Most users will never need the source code.\nYou can shut it off by launching the Software Center, then going to Edit -> Software Sources in the menu, and then disabling the \"Source Code\" check box:\n\nIt will then prompt you for your password and then rerun an update. \n\nA: This does not specifically address the question about whether or not you need to have source code repositories enabled. But you may find it useful, as it directly addresses the most common cause of the slowdown you're having. I copied this from my answer here.\nYou can have the update manager select the best main repos to use automatically, which will result in the best download speeds. To do that, open Update Manager, then click Settings. Select the Ubuntu Software tab, then in the \"Download from:\" dropdown, select Other...\n\nNow, in the window that pops up, click \"Select Best Server\"\n\nIt will then perform several tests to select the best server for you. Once it is completed, just click Choose Server.\n\nNow, just run your updates again and you should notice an improvement (if your best available repo wasn't already selected).\n\nA: You can safely disable source code, if you don't need to get build depedencies with \"apt-get build-dep\" nor changelogs nor the source code itself from Ubuntu repositories.\n", "Q: How to stop Apache access.log grooving every few seconds?

I am trying to understand how to use the stdout as the stdin of another command. To test it, I am trying to use the following command to delete all directories from the current folder. \nls -d -- */ | rm -rf $1\n\nI would expect the result of ls -d -- */ to be piped into the input of the rm, but it does not work. Ideas?\n\nA: Not all commands/programs will directly accept piped input (including rm). Additionally, why are you using the bash substitution variable $1 outside of a script?\nFor your general case, you need to look at xargs, a utility whose goal is to simplify such scenarios by taking a list from stdin and then invoking a command with the elements of that list (in different possible ways). \nFor what you want to do...(use it wisely!): rm -rf * (or .) will suffice. \n\nA: find -maxdepth 1 -not -name \".*\" -type d -print0 | xargs -n1 -0 rm -rf\n\n-maxdepth 1 include only the current directory. -not -name \".*\" exlude hidden directories. -type d include only directories, not files. find -print0 used with xargs -0 will use files and directories that have names with weird characters. xargs -n1 perform the command (in this case rm) one line at a time.\n\nA: Two options:\nls -d -- */ | xargs rm -r\n\nor\nrm -r `ls -d -- */`\n\nIn the past, xargs was necessary because there was a limit on command line argument lists. xargs will put a reasonable number on each execution and run the given command multiple times (it also has some cool stuff to help you do concurrent execution). However, in recent kernels, this limitation is gone, so the simpler rm command with no pipe will work fine, though it will use up more RAM so if there are many many thousands of arguments xargs will still be more efficient.\nIts worth noting that you do not need -f for rm, as that is only needed when you want rm to continue when a file does not exist, or to skip any interactive confirmations. Since you have ls telling you they exist, its safer to leave it off, and then the usual -i alias will save you from accidentally deleting write-protected files and directories.\n\nA: In this specific case, you could also use find:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type -d -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\n", "Q: Find files/folders in folder except some specific folders I'm trying to move all files from one folder to another, except some specific folders.\nI tried this to move all files except the .git, assets or build folders:\nfind .. ! -regex '\\(.git\\|assets\\|build\\)' | xargs mv -t ../build\nWhat I except this command to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find all files/folders in parent folder that are not .git, assets or build.\n\n*Move those files/folders to ../build\n\n\nThe folder structure is like this:\n.\n├── application\n├── assets\n├── build\n├── download_files\n├── images\n├── mybb\n├── system\n└── tools\n\nMy working directory is the tools folder.\nIf I execute find .. ! -regex '\\(.git\\|assets\\|build\\)' it still shows .git, assets and build.\nWhat's wrong with my command?\n\nA: You may have missed some wildcard characters, try \nfind .. ! -regex '\\(.*\\/\\.git.*\\|.*\\/assets.*\\|.*\\/build.*\\)'\n\nI also included the path separator (/) so that assets or build appearing as part of a path doesn't match.\n\nA: You can also use bash's extended globs to filter those dirs.

The /home/users directory on my host is an NFS mount connected to a server which is not in my control. When deleting files in $HOME (/home/users/foo) with Nautilus I get the following message:\n\nCannot move file to trash, do you want to delete immediately?\nThe file \"...\" cannot be moved to the trash.\n\nIs there some way to enable trash for this mount point? I have write access to the partition, but even after creating the expected /home/users/.Trash-$(id -u) and setting the sticky bit, Nautilus still fails to use the trash.\nWhen reading this question and the Trash Specification I found that $HOME/.local/share/Trash is the standard location (unless $XDG_DATA_HOME is set), and it looks like Nautilus is only half-aware of this: It does indeed write a $HOME/.local/share/Trash/info/[filename]<.number>.trashinfo every time I try to delete a file, but the files are all empty and I still keep getting the error message.\n\nA: You are trying to set permissions for a file system that isnt recognized. THE SYSTEM FUNCTION that \"deletes\" is not the system used in a linux based bit unless its emulated.\nWhen you tell it to delete it tries to write to the \"trashbin\". You are only moving stuff. To remove it you need to access the file system, not raw data. Its going to kick the data back because you are just asking it to move not delete, the delete command isnt within its wheelhouse./ regardless of the command you use. \nIf you can mount the partition/drive of the server in samba or what ever you like you may be able to use that to delete. Try virtually mounting, with permissions. If you only have read/write but not delete/move your going to have a bad time.\n\nA: uid=1000 en gid=1000 are required to make the trash work normally.\nSomehow you will need to mount it probably, is it possible to mount it in SAMBA like in fstab as below?\nUUID=***********   /media/DATA     ntfs-3g defaults, uid=1000, gid=1000,  locale=nl_NL.UTF-8    0        0\n\n\nA: NFS uses UID (user id) and GID (group id) for permissions and I believe you need these to match on both the local and remote system to obtain the functionality you describe. This is unlikely to happen as you state \"The server is not under my control\"\nSources:\nhttp://forums.openmediavault.org/index.php/Thread/5827-nfs-and-trash/\nhttp://linux.die.net/man/5/exports\n\nA: Nautilus' trash can looks virtually like one directory, but it's actually composed of two parts. A part for local files (on each NFS client) in $HOME/.local/share/Trash and another part for shared files on the NFS server in something like /home/users/.Trash-1002, with /home/users/ being the shared partition and 1002 being the numerical user id (as an example).\nAs in your case, your $HOME directory /home/users/foo is part of the shared partition /home/users, everything is completely shared, even the local files, and so even the local trash can. I can imagine this is confusing for Nautilus. Which trash can to use, the shared one or the local one?\nMaybe your admin should consider mounting the shared drives as (symlinked) separate partitions, while keeping the $HOME directories local on each client. This way, users can still use the client even if the server fails, and it permits different distro's on each client. And most important: your trash can will work as expected.\nSo for example (on each client):\n/home/foo      {local storage, $HOME}\n/nfs/users/foo {nfs mounted storage}\n\nln -s /nfs/users/foo /home/foo/my_share\n\nOn the server, you or your admin can create a shared trash can with:\nuid=$(id -u)\ndir=\"/nfs/users/.Trash-$uid\"\nmkdir -m 02700 $dir\nmkdir -m 00700 $dir/expunged\nmkdir -m 02700 $dir/files\nmkdir -m 02700 $dir/info\nsudo chown -R $uid:$uid $dir\n\nTo activate, logout and login again on each client.\n", "Q: No wireless internet connection Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I just installed Ubuntu on my Dell Latitude D820.

I am completely new to Ubuntu and installed it over Windows XP.  I hope someone has a solution.\n\nA: What version of Ubuntu have you installed? I answered another question similar to this one. I even had this problem myself on my Dell Inspiron. You should try to create a 'wired' connection and then create your wireless connection.\nUbuntu 12.04 appeared to have a bug, strangely when you are asked for the 'password' Ubuntu automatically throws a failure instead of prompting for the password.

I would like to know how could I move all files from a folder to another folder with a command line.\nLet's say I'm in my Downloads folder and there are a 100 files that I would like to move to my Videos folder, without having to write all the files name. \n\nA: Open a terminal and execute this command:\nmv  -v ~/Downloads/* ~/Videos/\n\nIt will move all the files and folders from Downloads folder to Videos folder.\n\nTo move all files, but not folders: \nIf you are interested in moving all files (but not folders) from Downloads folder to Videos folder, use this command \nfind ~/Downloads/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 mv -t ~/Videos\n\nTo move only files from the Download folders, but not from sub-folders:\nIf you want to move all files from the Downloads folder, but not any files within folders in the Download folder, use this command:\nfind ~/Downloads/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 mv -t ~/Videos\n\nhere, -maxdepth option specifies how deep find should try, 1 means, only the directory specified in the find command. You can try using 2, 3 also to test. \nSee  the Ubuntu find manpage for a detailed explanation\n\nA: Use \nmv -v ~/rootfolder/branch/* ~/rootfolder\n\nI hope this helps. Because I had the same pain and wasted a lot of time fixing my mistake.\n\nA: mv ~/Downloads/* ~/Videos\n\nIt will move all the files including subfolders in the directory you want to mv. If you want to cp (copy) or rm (remove) you will need the -r (recursive) option to include subfolders. \n\nA: For the simple case:\nmv ~/Downloads/* ~/Videos\n\nIf you want to move dot (hidden) files too, then set the dotglob shell option.\nshopt -s dotglob\nmv ~/Downloads/* ~/Videos\n\nThis leaves the shell option set.\nFor one time dotglob use, run the commands in a subshell:\n(shopt -s dotglob; mv ~/Downloads/* ~/Videos)\n\n\nA: mv source_path/* destination_path/\n\nhere you have to put forward slash and * after source path so that it will take files inside source_path instead of the complete source directory.\nExample: mv /home/username/test/*  /home/username/test2/\nThe above command moves all files (unless they are hidden) in the source directory to the destination directory.\n\nA: It's possible by using rsync, for example:\nrsync -vau --remove-source-files src/ dst/\n\nwhere:\n\n-v, --verbose:               Increase verbosity.\n-a, --archive:               Archive mode; equals -rlptgoD (no -H, -A, -X).\n-u, --update:                Skip files that are newer on the receiver.\n--remove-source-files        This tells rsync to remove from the sending side the files (meaning non-directories) that are a part of the transfer and have been successfully duplicated on the receiving side.\n\nIf you've root privileges, prefix with sudo to override potential permission issues.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to the command line and get into the directory you want to move it to with cd folderNamehere\n\n*Type pwd. This will print the directory you want to move it too.\n\n*Then change to the directory where all of the files are with cd folderNamehere\n\n*Now to move all the files type mv *.* typeAnswerFromStep2here\nThat will move all files from that directory to the other.\n\nA: try it\nfind ~/Desktop -type f -iname  \"*.mp4\" -exec mv {} ~/Videos \\;\n\n-type\nwith the argument -type you can specify type file.on this statement that is the mean file.if using of -d that means directory.\n-iname:\nthe most common and obvious method to look for a file is using its -name argument.if you  are not sure about its case-sensitivity you can use of -iname argument\nmv {}\nand finally to specify target directory and then moving the files on there using mv {} argument\n\nA: To move a directory with or without content to its new name just like how you would use the mv command to rename a file:\nmv -T dir1 dir2\nwhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*-T treats the destination as a normal file\n\n*dir1 is the original name of the directory\n\n*dir2 is the new name of the directory\n\n\nNB: dir2 doesn't have to exist.\nI hope this saves someone a lot of time, as a noob, before this, I would create a directory with the new name and then move the contents of the directory to the directory created earlier.\nUse for subdirectories\nThis command is useful when many files have been saved in a subfolder of the target directory i.e. Downloads/mp4. In this example, running mv -T Downloads/mp4 Videos will result in mp4 subfolder being removed and all files contained inside are moved to Videos folder.\n\nA: This command should do it:\nsudo find ~/Downloads -mindepth 1 -prune -exec mv '{}' ~/Videos \\;\n\nIt moves all visible and hidden files, and doesn't throw unnecessary errors, not even if the source directory is empty.\n\nA: you can copy all contents using rsync and remove all files using --remove-source-files remove copied directories using find -type d | rm :\nrsync -auv  --remove-source-files ./src ./dst \\\n&& find ./dst -type d | sed -n '1d;p' | xargs rm -rf -\n\nThe command sed -n '1d;p' excludes first directory path from the directories listed, since the first directory in the list is directory dst itself!\nOR you can run all in a single command (Thanks to good muslim @muru):\nfind  ./dst -mindepth 1 -type d -delete\n\n\nA: Just wanted to add one more answer. If you are already in the folder you want to move files out of, you can do this:\nmv * ~/Videos\n\n", "Q: How do I get a Tata photon VME-102 USB modem working?

I have several Cisco adapters that I am using with embedded systems and so, from time to time, each system will see different adapters.  Only one adapter is reliably detected.  \nWhat what I can tell, the problem is that each adapter gets it's own line in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules which specifies a name for the adapter e.g. \n# USB device 0x0b95:0x7720 (usb)\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ..., ATTR{address}==\"xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\",...,KERNEL==\"eth*\", NAME=\"eth1\"\n\n# USB device 0x0b95:0x7720 (usb)\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ..., ATTR{address}==\"yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy\",...,KERNEL==\"eth*\", NAME=\"eth2\"\n\nOnly the adapter with NAME=\"eth1\" works happily.  Changing the name of all devices to NAME==\"eth1\" solves the problem.  This could be an issue on systems that could use multiple adapters.\nQuestion:  Is this the only workaround? It feels very hacky.

What can be causing awesome to stop loading my custom file? How do I even debug it? I tried awesome -k and it says everything's OK.\n\nA: Ok, I figured it out. Debugged it using Xephyr.\nBasically, I figured out that if there's an error in rc.lua, awesome rejects it and loads the default rc.lua from /etc/xdg/awesome. The trouble is, those errors don't often affect awesome -k, which still shows \"Syntax OK!\". Debugging using Xephyr, though, while a pain to set up, allows you to see more verbose error messages and pinpoint the problem. For me, I was missing a command that rc.lua refers to, a compositor. Installing the compositor fixed the problem. \n\nA: I had the same problem - to resolve, make sure you copy the entire contents of /etc/xdg/awesome - not just rc.lua!\nso \nmkdir ~/.config\ncp -R /etc/xdg/awesome ~/.config\n\nNow Awesome should take notice of your custom rc.lua.\n", "Q: Launch two processes and return first process to the foreground so it can be killed with ctrl-c I am launching two processes in a bash script:\n\nrun_webserver\nxdg-open http://$(hostname)/dev-environment\n\nThe run_webserver is an ongoing process, so I need to be able to kill it with ctrl-c. The xdg-open command simply launches a page in the browser.\nIf I separate these commands with an ampersand (&), the second process takes away \"focus\" from the first and I can no longer kill it with ctrl+c... must instead look it up in ps and run kill -9. Any ideas?\n\nA: &(Ampersand) sends the process to the background. It means if you run \"run_webserver &\" then this process will run in the backgrond.\nYou can bring this process to foreground by looking at the job id for the process in the terminal.\nSteps to bring the process to foreground and kill\n\n\n*\n\n*jobs :--> this command will list all the process running on the terminal.\n\n*fg  :--> this command will bring the process to the foreground.\nThen you can use your ctrl-c to kill the process, or any other sequence which kills the process.\nPlease find the attached screen shots:- \n\n\n\nA: You can set a trap to kill the background process on exit, and wait for the background process.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntrap 'kill $!'

First, just send kill by itself, which is equivalent to kill -TERM. If that fails after waiting a while, send SIGHUP: kill -HUP.

They have something called a game manager stub that is to install, but is not compatible, apparently.  When I questioned their tech support, they stated that there is no way to run it with ubuntu.

I hope someone may be able to help.\nthanks,\n                                                    Joanne Carroll\n\nA: It is possible to run some of the Big Fish games but it must be done via WINE(can be found in the Ubuntu Software Center) -WINE-64bit or Codeweavers Crossover Linux\nThe particular game that you are talking about would need to be checked with the application database on either site.  \nWINE is free but is mostly unsupported; only blog like answers by users and the WINE team(the last is limited as they are constantly working on WINE itself and not available to give personal support).  To run most windows programs you will need to install other supporting programs via winetricks(will be installed with WINE if installed via the Software Center)  programs like Play-on-Linux are supposed to make it easier to install the needed programs.  \nQuite frankly I gave up trying to get WINE to work, the instructions needed to get them running were very hard for me to follow as the answers were in the middle of blog like posts that are a back and forth discussion between all the participants, I lost the information I needed in all the back and forth.  This was just me, many people use WINE successfully so they must be able to follow it.\nI found success with Crossover.  It is not a free program but includes email support and will install alot of the needed extra programs automatically, so you are getting more than the free version of WINE.  It is a annual subscription, $60 for the initial year and then it can be renewed for $30 a year.  You can try is for 2 weeks for free to see if you like it, but it will sotp working after the trial if you don't but it.  They often run specials so you can sometimes get it for cheaper than the $60 price but you would kind of have to get lucky, they don't run specials on any schedule that I know of.   Note you can get crossover via the Ubuntu Software CEnter but I would recommend that you download the .deb file directly form the Codeweavers' website, it is usually more up to date and updating is easier\nThe short answer here is that there is no easy & free way to play Windows game or run Windows programs on Ubuntu but it can be done easy(relatively) or free.  Even with WINE's free version or Codeweavers' value added version, not all programs or games will run on Linux and those that do may not run as well, though some run better.\nAs I said above you would need to check the application database to see if and how well you particular game will run at all and if so how well.  Both databases use a medal system to rate the programs. WINE rates their programs Platunium-Garbage.  Codeweavers uses Gold-Known not to work.  I will refer you to the respective website for the exact rating system as this answer has almost become a novel and it is much easier for you to reading it yourself then trying to understand my paraphrasing.\nI hope this long and rambling answer was helpful.

But know I am tring to use it with Windows or Ubuntu but none of them can recognize.\nI tried refreshing GParted to recognize it but it stays for a long time trying without any luck.\nAny way to force 'mount' or copy entire HDD to the internal HDD?\n\nA: I would say that if it's not detected in either Widows or Linux or gparted it's permanently broken.\nBut to be sure , you can check in your bios, during startup, if the drive is detected there. If you don't see any drive there then it's gone.\nIf you dont have a bios you can access you can see if the linux detects it at all by typing :\ndmesg |less\n\n, in the terminal to look through the up start log of your computer.\nit will contain any harddrives detected during start up of Linux\n", "Q: Can I run Balloons.IO by gravityonmars? I wonder if I can run Balloons.IO an open source project on my Ubuntu Server?\n\nA: Short answer: Yes you can.\nThe project seems to use node.js and redis, both of which are available in Ubuntu repositories.\nBalloons.IO's repository even has some installation docs: https://github.com/gravityonmars/Balloons.IO/blob/master/README.md\n", "Q: How to make a VM use AMD IOMMU so I can use a 2nd Graphics card? This is related to my question here, However I didn't get the answer of how to Implement it in a VM only of what it was.\nHaving read that I have a 2nd Graphics card that I don't use, How (if possible) can i make a VM that could make use of that card through the IOMMU feature in my motherboard chipset.\nThe chipset is an AMD 990X, the 2nd card is an nVidia 8600GT and the Motherboard is an ASUS M5A99xEVO (the first one, as there's a R2.0).\n\nA: I assume you use VirtualBox, like in your question earlier. However you may want to try KVM. They have a How-to on that topic. I did a quick search on if the M5A99x EVO and its BIOS supports IOMMU and it looks promising, may be you need a BIOS update.\n\nA: As far as I know, this isn't stable/working completely in virtualbox.  Here's the ticket where they talk about experimental host bus passthrough.  \nThis wouldn't work for pcie or getting cuda support in the guest though.  For something like that you're stuck with Xen/KVM/VMWare(I hear they have it working, but I haven't witnessed it directly).  \n", "Q: How can I create a USB RAID? Reading this link, it describes how to make a RAID array out of USB sticks, however it describes the process using Gentoo now I don't know about gentoo and have never used it, but I'm supposing this is possible in Ubuntu if so how?.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses udev so you don't need to execute the mknod command in those instructions.\nAs mentioned, mdadm is well documented as doesn't care whether the devices are hard disks, usb drives, or even LVM partitions. Examples:\nCreate a mirrored partition:\nmdadm /dev/md0 --create --level=1 -n 2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1\n\n4 disk RAID 5:\nmdadm /dev/md5 --create --level=5 -n 4 /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdc2 /dev/sdd2 /dev/sde2\n\n\nA: The guide that you linked will be the same with ubuntu. The raid utility \"mdadm\" is fairly common and well documented.\nYou will need to apt-get install mdadm to have this tool available.\n", "Q: Web-apps preview always goes to same Hulu page Every time I access Hulu from the dash using web-apps it takes me to the same (previously viewed) video instead of the main sign-on screen for Hulu.

However, when I am at my computer, I do not want to be prompted at all for my password, for any reason.\nI realize it is a \"security risk\", but I am a developer and the loss of convenience is more important to me. \nAdding \"NOPASSWD\" to sudoers will stop it from prompting at the shell, but stuff like Update Manager and Ubuntu Software Center will still bother me.\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: If you make your own launchers for them in the style sudo update-manager then they will start with full privelidges but not prompt you. The default shortcuts to these programs are structured to prompt you before they run, so just don't use those.\n\nA: OK, I found the answer to my own question. Turns out this ridiculous non-sudoers-respecting password prompt application is called PolicyKit. No way in hell would most people know about this application, so it is hard to Google for. This question will put an end to that!\nFix is simple: in /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/50.local.d, create a file called disable.pkla (or whatever you want, as long as it ends with .pkla) with the following contents:\n[This name does not matter]\nIdentity=unix-group:admin\nAction=*\nResultActive=yes\n\nLog out and back in, and enjoy!\n\nA: As a developer, you should already know that this is a bad idea. When absolutely necessary I've been known to execute sudo bash and enter a few commands. I know how far to (not) trust myself from experience, so I keep the time I leave that shell around to the very minimum and do it only once or twice a year. Sudo works for me very well.\nUbuntu is a free and open source distribution, and you are free to do whatever you want.\nAt AskUbuntu the standard is to copy the information from other resources (legally) to prevent stale links and, as importantly, to keep the information right at hand.\nBecause the reference is very long, and has very important warnings, I'm going to paste a reference instead. The idea would be to enable the root account and then use that for what you want. Here is the reference.\nFor programs like the software center that use policykit rather than sudoers a change to policykit is necessary. The reference is here.\nI strongly recommend that you and the others who refer to this question not do this.\n", "Q: Change \"get help\" and \"translate this app\" quickly If have created an app with quickly with the name \"Vault\"...but in launchpad the name was already taken for a branch i used \"vault-encfs\" because its a gui for encfs...\nnow i have a problem with the option \"get help\" and \"translate this app\" in the help menu which tries to find vault in launchpad and not vault-encfs...\ncan i change it?\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 5, in <module>\n  File \"/usr/share/launchpad-integration/launchpadintegration/main.py\", line 48, in main\n    pkginfo = PackageInfo.fromPackageName(options.package, logger)\n  File \"/usr/share/launchpad-integration/launchpadintegration/packageinfo.py\", line 219, in fromPackageName\n    '\"%s\"' % package)\nlaunchpadintegration.packageinfo.PackageNotFoundError: Could not look up package info for \"vault\"\n\n\nA: This feature actually attempts to determine the Ubuntu package for the application, and then look that up on Launchpad. Because your application is not packaged, the Launchpad integration feature is not able to determine the binary and source package from which it came, and will thus fail to take the user to Launchpad for the online help and translate menu items.\nIt is perhaps worth reporting a bug against the launchpad-integration package, about the feature failing to work with applications which are not packaged in Ubuntu; if one is not already opened.\n", "Q: Radio Tray Unity panel icon color change Thanks to the Linux Action Show I've discovered the awesome Radio Tray panel applet and am loving it.  The only problem I have with it is that the icon is blue and everything else in my system tray is white.  How would I go about changing the icon color?  Thanks in advance from a new Ubuntu fan!\n\nA: Radio tray icons are placed in different folders, but the one you are interested on is named radiotray_on.png, whose location may be found by dropping locate radiotray | grep .png in a terminal in order to know all the locations of the Radio Tray ICons.\nThe one which manages the notification area status icon for the Radio Tray application is set inside of the folder: /usr/share/radiotray/images specifically called radiotray_on.png.\nI suggest you to run nautilus with administrative rights (gksudo nautilus) over that folder in order to open the icon in gimp or any other software of your choice on which you can change the hue, saturation and curves of the icon, then save it (remember to backup) and restart Radio Tray in order to the changes to take effect (you need just to re-play your current radio station if already playing).\nIllustration here: (check the radiotray notification's area icon and the edited radiotray_on.png highlighted with inverse colors in nautilus)\n\nHere is a copy of the image that you can use if you don't feel like editing the icon manually (right click, save as, etc.):\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: I had the same problem and it was because I had loaded two themes, ZorinLight and ZorinDark, and had chosen the wrong icons for the theme. They were loaded in a separate directory, /usr/share/icons/ZorinLight or ZorinDark/(size)/status/(icon).png. The theme I used was ZorinDark but the icons were set (for cinnamon) in dconf Editor. They were under org /cinnamon /desktop /interface /iconTheme. When I changed the setting from ZorinLight to ZorinDark, the Icons became visible on the tray.\nI initially tried to change them in the /usr/share/radiotray/images directory but that didn't work. Setting a theme with unique icons may be the cause of your problem.\n", "Q: How do I restrict ports to certain users? Alright, well, what I wanted to do was to allow my users to only be allowed to access a specific port,\nIn example, UserA can only access port 2004\nWhile UserB can only access ports 2009, and 2010\nTo be more helpful, I'll try and explain.\nBasically, users will be allowed to remotely access the server, and call a program through SSH. The thing is, the program allows the user to type in the port to use. Is there any way to restrict users to only be able to use certain ports...\nI'm assuming I may have to some how modify the program so that a user can only access certain ports (and in turn some how assign the ports to each user), but I'm unaware of how this would be done.\n\nA: What you basically need is the nufw. Ubuntu's classic default firewall ufw allows just port-based restriction by manipulation of ip-tables. The nufw on the other hand, allows user-based restriction, apart from acting as a classical firewall. Here is the debian link (I'm sure ubuntu repository must also be having this):\nhttp://packages.debian.org/squeeze/nufw\n", "Q: Security measures regarding specifically online shopping and banking I've read the community wiki and some questions here on Ask Ubuntu about security measures on Ubuntu, but I would like to focus on the security of online money transactions.\nIs a VPN service with SSL connection enough to make this kind of operation as secure as possible (even if using public wireless spots?)\nI am counting on using a Live-USB with Firefox or Chrome browser, both the Live system and the browser used only and strictly for this delicate purpose, thus creating an independent system to take precautions against any potential malware that may have infiltrated my regular everyday system and browser and I'll also be using a secure connection. Any other security measures that I should be aware of?\n\nA: +1 for the question which affects many of us. I can only say the following:\nEven with today's technology and security measures there will always be a way to bypass them, be them an easy task or a difficult nearly impossible one. At the end, they can be done (See in google stuff like wikileaks, information leak, etc..). With this in mind I will add that having an SSL connection (Secure Socket Layer, although I am guessing a TLS 1.x will be used) is very secured. Even more in Ubuntu (Or any other Linux Distro) since, not only are the standards applied but they even get updated faster and with any new security measures.\nAdd to this that you will be using a VPN will give you even more security.\nHaving that, plus a secured OS like Ubuntu (Very secured since you are going to load it from a Live USB, which is like a Paranoid Security Level PSL) gives you a HUGE security measure over the PC you would be using. Of course the only downside is the connection to the place you would be connecting and the connection to it.\nYou can have a very secured system, but if the connection to the other end is compromised, it lowers your security. It lowers even more if where you are connecting has already been compromised.\nSo from what I can read from your question, the only 2 things left to think about would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Am I connecting to a secure site?\n\n*Is the connection I am using secured (Like somebody capturing packets like crazy)\n\n*Do I have somebody behind me with a gun?\n\n\nThis are questions that can help you when having a more secured way of connecting. Now a good question to ask yourself is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I need so much security just to check my bank account that holds 100$?\n\n*Am I Bruce Wayne that I need so much security?\n\n\nI can give you an example of my father that uses Ubuntu + Firefox to connect to Bank of America and other 3 banks. He pays all bills, does transfers, payse credit card, etc.. This is like 3 years ago (Since he got Ubuntu ^^).\n", "Q: Malformed line in the source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse), dont let me use update manager Here is the error hope i can get some help, i show you the update manager and the line of the error, if you need something else just ask for it.\nupdate manager error prompt:\n\nAn unresolvable problem occurred while initializing the package information.\n\nPlease report this bug against the 'update-manager' package and include the following error message:\n\n'E:Malformed line 58 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse), E:The list of sources could not be read., E:The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.'\n\n================================================================================\nerror line:\n\ndeb http:mx.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates main restricted\n\n\nA: Your URL is mangled:\ndeb http:mx.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates main restricted\n\nshould be:\ndeb http://mx.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates main restricted\n\n", "Q: Wireless unstable with an Atheros AR9285 I have a Asus eee PC 1001PX running ubuntu 12.04.

Adobe will continue to provide security\n  backports to Flash Player 11.2 for Linux.\n\nWhat is the plans for Flash support in the future?\nWith a bit of luck HTML5 media support will drop website developer's dependency on Flash.\n\nA: Well, basically if we want to keep up with Flash Player future versions and corresponding features and improvements, other than security fixes, we will have to switch to Google Chrome. Adobe went on to say that future updates to Flash Player beyond version 11.2 for Linux will be available only through the Pepper API that will run on Google Chrome and not through a download from Adobe directly. Mozilla hasn't provided any statement about this that I know of so far, so it is expected that Firefox will just use the last version provided by Adobe for the years to come. \nI also wish that html5 takes over the Internet, however some functionalities still rely strongly upon Flash player, such as media streams and it will take some time until we get rid of it.\nRead this and this for additional details:\nThere has been some heavy discussion about this as well at Ubuntu Forums. Check those out:\n1 2 3\n\nA: I suppose it may be the last version usable on Linux; HTML5 will eventually take over anyway.

I'm looking into a Laptop with good graphics capabilities for under $1000, and I came across the Lenovo y470p and y480.  The y470p has an AMD graphics card which I'm told is supported better under Linux but is otherwise \"last gen,\" while the y480 has a Nvidia 640m card but is much newer tech.  I'd like to know what the state of Nvidia drivers are in Ubuntu and if this is an unsupported Optimus card or if it would be a good computer to use.  If possible I would like to use Linux for everything, and the graphics would be a nice bonus but I am willing to keep Windows on the computer for the occasional game.\n\nA: I have been using 12.04 on my Y480 for over a month now -- i7, 8GB RAM, 750GB HD. Works great. I have no issues with wireless, sound, etc. The only \"complaint\" I have is that the trackpad occasionally doesn't seem to turn off while typing, so the cursor sometimes ends up in odd places. However, coming from an Apple Macbook Pro (old model), I think the ability to use two fingers for a right click works better under Ubuntu than it did in the brief time I had Windows on the machine. I don't believe I had to go through any extraordinary effort to get the machine working.\nI bought this laptop with the intent of installing Ubuntu on it, trying to escape the Apple/Microsoft dictatorships, and I am very happy with the machine. \n\nA: I got the GPU running on Lenovo Y480P on Ubuntu 12.04/12.10.

I also want to try a fresh install of 12.04.\n\nA: You seem to be inquiring about how well the GT640M works with Bumblebee. I don't know about the 640M, but I have worked out a recipe for getting Bumblebee working with the 650M (which may be a similar model). If you end up owning a system with the 640M and you can't manage to get bumblebee working by following all the official instructions, you might consider following my tutorial here: http://eternalvoid.net/tutorials/linux-optimus-gt650m/\nThe short of it is, until bumblebee 3.0.1 and nvidia-current 304.22b or newer are in your distro's repositories, you may need to follow a procedure similar to the one in my tutorial to get your newish NVidia Optimus card working with the proprietary driver.\nTo answer your question more specifically, when bumblebee works at all, it seems to work very well in my experience.\n", "Q: How do I change the permision on a external HDD Good day,\nI am a ubuntu newbie and I am having trouble using an external 3.5\" HDD. I did some reading about file systems and decided to format my new drive to ex3. After formatting, I could not read or write because I did not have permission. I have tried pysdm and tried chown but it is still not working. Please could someone provide me with a simple step-by-step \"how to\" on this? \nThank you,\nAndrew\n\nA: If nobody except you is using the drive, you can explicitly mount the drive in your home directory.  I am assuming you are currently simply connecting the drive, and allowing the system to mount it automatically, which it does in the /media directory, one which is owned by root.  If it were a permanent directory, then you could change the permissions, but it's dynamic, so you can't.  Therefore, mounting it explicitly in /etc/fstab is the best way, I think.\nFor my instruction, I will assume a directory named \"extern\"; change this if you wish, but make sure to do so everywhere.  I will also assume your login name is Andrew, just for the example.\nCreate a directory in your home directory (/usr/andrew) named extern.\nUsing the bash terminal, enter a command sudo blkid.  Find your external drive in the list, and copy the UUID, hich is in the form of \"########-####-####-############\".  To copy, highlight with the mouse, and press shift-ctrl-C.\nNext, you need to edit a system file using a text editor such as gedit.  To do this, enter the commmand gksudo gedit /etc/fstab.  At the end of this file add one line like this, substituting the UUID from the clipboard for the \"####...\" field (one single line, not two!):\nUUID=########-####-####-############ /home/andrew/extern  ext3    rw,suid,dev,exec,noauto,async,nofail,user 0   0\nSave the file, but don't close it yet.\nUnmount the external drive using either sudo umount /dev/sda2, or whatever number the drive is, or use Nautilus to unmount it.\nIn the bash terminal, enter the command sudo mount -a; this will mount the drives specified in the file.

I installed Xubuntu desktop on top of Ubuntu 12.04. The usage of RAM and CPU is in general lower than in Ubuntu. But when it comes to some serious computations, I did not see much of a difference between the two.\nFor example, I ran a MATLAB program that took 99 seconds to run on Ubuntu and 98 seconds on Xubuntu. Then I ran Geekbench benchmarking and the overall scores Ubuntu and Xubuntu are 2996 and 2997, respectively.\nMy laptop is a 4 year old Dell 1535. Would things run faster on a clean install of Xubuntu?\n\nA: If you are doing the same 1 billion multiply operations, without accessing windows or any other operating system function, and nothing else is going on in the background, it shouldn't really matter what operating system or desktop environment you are using Ubuntu, Red Hat, Windows. The hardware is the constraint. If whatever operating system is bringing the program into memory and then letting the processor or processors do their best your hardware will mostly determine the speed (assuming all of the operating systems handle the multiple processors, hyperthreading, and so on).\nWhen compiled with a better compiler, or compiled with more optimization, you may not be performing quite the same number of operations, however. Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Red Hat, probably are using about the same compiler. It may make a difference how MATLAB is compiled between Ubuntu/Debian and Windows, however.\nWhen you get into doing reads and writes to disk, you shouldn't necessarily expect a benchmark to work the same on Windows, BSD, or Linux, but should probably expect the Linux numbers to be about the same, including Ubuntu and Xubuntu (but the kernels will be configured differently and that may make a difference).\nIf you are putting someone at the desktop and have taught them how to perform some task, Ubuntu and Xubuntu will use different resources when they perform them later, Xubuntu probably fewer resources. The individual may take more or less time to perform the task with either Ubuntu or Xubuntu. In this case it makes all the difference what you decide to measure.\n\nA: In my experience: Xubuntu is a lot faster. In my netbook: Samsung NC110 A02 couldn't stand unity (everything was slow, much clipping etc.). On the other hand: my Asus F3ka have been better with Ubuntu (12.04) but also, slow as hell. It took hours to do simple things, also I don't like how they have hidden most of settings (since 11.10 it isn't a customizable O/S). I tried Xubuntu. And since then I have it in all of my computers. Fast, stable, customizable and light OS. It eats only about 190 MB of RAM. I repaired a lot of old computers with it. I could not even image what Ubuntu 12.04 will looke like if on them.\n\nA: The Kernel is the same, the underlying system is the same, the tools are the same, the desktop is different. It's the same Operating System, it's just using a different Desktop Environment.\n\nA: This is an issue that I looked into pretty seriously because I had an older laptop that was not running very smoothly at all. It took forever for programs to open and execute various tasks, and got slower and slower during the time I would use it, forcing me to reboot periodically just to refresh the system. I experimented between Xubuntu and Ubuntu, and kept track of times to measure the actual difference.\nThe technical answer is, yes, Xubuntu is faster than regular Ubuntu.\nBut, the more accurate answer is, no, probably not in any way that will make a difference to you.\nIf you just opened up Xubuntu and Ubuntu on two identical computers and had them sit there doing nothing, you would see that Xubuntu's Xfce interface was taking up less RAM than Ubuntu's Gnome or Unity interface.\nBut, so what? You don't just run computers to have them sit there. And here's where the rubber hits the road.\nXubuntu isn't just Xfce, it's also a whole suite of bundled applications to handle most tasks you want to do. For example, if you wanted to do word processing, Xubuntu comes with Abiword preinstalled. On regular Ubuntu, you're offered LibreOffice Writer by default.\nAbiword may take less resources, but you pay for that with less features. And while I probably don't use 90% of the features available in Writer, the difference was noticeable enough that I found I would rather use Writer.\nWhich brings us to the real issue when determining whether Xfce is faster or not. Even though underneath Writer, Xubuntu's Xfce interface is using less resources than Ubuntu's Gnome or Unity, the question you're coming down to is this: Is Xfce using less resource to a degree that would make a difference in how fast LibreOffice Writer runs?\nThe answer is, no, not really. LibreOffice uses so much resource on its own that it quickly eats up any savings in using Xcfe. For all intents and purposes, when running something like LibreOffice on Xubuntu, the savings that Xcfe offers you is so negligible as to not matter.\nSo, if you're content to stay within the suite of applications offered by Xubuntu, then you might see some difference.\nIf, however, your hope is to run more or less the same programs as you would with Gnome or Unity but are hoping to get an appreciable performance boost, then there is no meaningful difference. By \"meaningful difference\", I mean a difference in how fast programs open or execute tasks to a degree that a human can tell the difference. I don't know about you, but saving .03 seconds if it takes a minute and a half to open a program doesn't mean anything to me.\nIn the end, I found that buying more RAM for my laptop - going from 512MB to 1GB - was the real solution I was looking for. The dream is that by getting an optimized desktop manager you can breathe new life into an old machine, and I'm sure some people have a situation where they pulled that off. But my experience was that trying to tweak the interface and applications ultimately had too many feature drawbacks for too little return.\nSo the question about which is faster, Xubuntu or Ubuntu, comes down to this: what applications do you want to use? If you are willing to go with the whole Xubuntu suite and all the bundled applications that are meant to be more minimal in resource use, then you might notice a performance improvement. But as soon as you start using bigger applications, the interface savings will become moot.\n\nA: Yes, the desktop environment of Xubuntu is faster than the Unity shell on top of GNOME that Ubuntu uses.\n\nA: I came here looking for a technical answer. I didn't find that. \nI'm looking into this for an Ubuntu server install on a pretty low resources box.\nSo here is a better technical answer with resources comparison:\nhttp://mylinuxexplore.blogspot.com/2012/10/ubuntu-1210-vs-kubuntu-1210-vs-xubuntu.html\nHope this helps someone.\n\nA: Probably yes. Regular Ubuntu brings Unity and a lot of more programs that are kept executing in memory, while Xubuntu brings less of those.\nIf you want a really fast and less memory consuming, you can try download Ubuntu server and install only what you need, or even use a WM likde Openbox instead of a DE.\n\nA: Matlab would be slow on any system, that's what it is. Matlab is written in C++ and you are not compiling it from source for your system to build binaries. It's all compiled code and it is one of the slowest scientific computation environments.\nIt doesn't really matter whether you run it on an RHEL, Ubuntu or Xfce version of Ubuntu. Don't look for these kind of benchmarks. Look for things like sensor outputs throughout the day for normal and extreme usage in your system. SMART data is available for sensors. Just see how the resources are being used through out the day.\nDon't do benchmarks with Matlab. At least write a real scientific code in C++ and Fortran and run it in both environments and see if there is any difference (would be pointless still, if you are gonna do something stupid do it right).\nIf you are the looks person use Ubuntu. If you are the stability person go for Xubuntu. It hardly crashes unless you do something stupid.\n", "Q: Sound Troubles with 12.04 on Dell Latitude D420 When upgrading from 10.04 to 12.04 sound playback with internal speakers stopped working on my Dell Latitude D420 laptop.

So if /home is a separate file system, it shouldn't matter.\nIf you had a file system mounted somewhere under your home directory, the client should be able to synchronise that too.\nThe only thing to keep in mind is that you should ensure that such a partition is always mounted when the Ubuntu One synchronisation daemon is running.  For instance, if a separate file system is mounted at ~/Music and that folder is synchronised, unmounting that folder might look like all the files under have been deleted.\nIf the file system is on a fixed disk and mounted through /etc/fstab, then there shouldn't be much of a problem.  I would advise against doing this kind of thing with removable media though.\n", "Q: How to prevent another user from editing my display name in Empathy?

I've tried some solutions on here which did not work, there are no errors shown when I press the esc key whilst shutting down, and the animation gets stuck on the first dot if it don't press esc.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: Try shutting down using the terminal by running:\nshutdown -h now\n\nand check the output it gives you. Probably you have a daemon that for some reason is blocking the process.\nShutting down using the text mode should give you some hints.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Look at the man page for shutdown, it states for the -h (halt) option:\n\"Requests that the system be either halted or powered off after it has been brought down, with the choice as to which left up to the system.\"\nSo it is platform specific - some systems halt the machine (and don't power it down), other systems halt and power down the machine with the -h option.

I made a liveCD and played around with it a bit and really liked it. I thought that instead of installing Xubuntu itself I would just install the metapackages on my already existing Ubuntu. \nSo, I tried it out by installing XFCE4 and then later xubuntu-desktop on my Ubuntu 12.04. Neither had the exact same style as the liveCD which I preferred, so I decided to delete XFCE from my computer and install a partition instead. \nThrough Synaptic I removed XFCE4 (and completely removed xfce-notifyd so that my notifications would work with the Unity style again). I later went on to remove most of the packages and their dependencies that came with xubuntu-desktop, and I think that removed a lot of it. \nWhile my desktop now works perfectly, it has changed two things. For one, the Xubuntu welcome screen comes out instead of the Ubuntu one (though I have to say the Xubuntu screen looks a LOT nicer). I'd still rather it say Ubuntu. Secondly, I had tweaked Grub with grub-customizer to have an image I found of Ubuntu that was really cool. Now when Grub starts up, it has a picture of Debian (I think that's random but maybe it comes with Xubuntu?). I can probably just change the second one but still I'm just curious.\nCan anyone help me get the old Ubuntu screen back?\n\nA: I did the same XFCE experiment and was also annoyed that the Xubuntu startup logo showed up even after I (supposedly) completely uninstalled XFCE. \nPavan's answer hints at the solution that I eventually discovered. Note that my solution was done in Ubuntu 12.04 (probably works for other versions, but YMMV):\nThese files control are where Ubuntu gets it's start up sequence resources:\n/lib/plymouth/themes/default.plymouth\n/lib/plymouth/themes/text.plymouth\n\nHowever, they are actually symlinks to two more symlinks which point to the actual source files:\n/etc/alternatives/default.plymouth\n/etc/alternatives/text.plymouth\n\nSo the solution is to delete the /etc/alternatives/ links and point them at the original ubuntu resources. Open a terminal and execute these commands:\n> cd /etc/alternatives\nCheck out where these alternatives links are pointing to:\n> ls -la *.plymouth\n\nRemove these intermediate links (in /etc/alternatives):\n> sudo rm default.plymouth\n> sudo rm text.plymouth\n\nCreate new links to the original Ubuntu resources:\n> sudo ln -s /lib/plymouth/themes/ubuntu-logo/ubuntu-logo.plymouth default.plymouth\n> sudo ln -s /lib/plymouth/themes/ubuntu-text/ubuntu-text.plymouth text.plymouth\n\nYou should also remove the Xubuntu resources for good housekeeping:\n> sudo rm -rf /lib/plymouth/themes/xubuntu-logo\n> sudo rm -rf /lib/plymouth/themes/xubuntu-text\n\nAfter doing all that, try rebooting and you should see your familiar old Ubuntu start up logo.\n\nA: Does your /lib/plymouth/themes/default.plymouth refer to the right ImageDir & ScriptFile ? It should point to ubuntu-themes directory.\n\nA: Per Mark Paskal's answer, I had the same problem on Ubuntu 17.04. I just used:\nsudo apt remove plymouth-theme-xubuntu-logo plymouth-theme-xubuntu-text\n\nThe files were removed and the links redirected to the original file as per the above.\n", "Q: autostart application in new workspace in gnome-shell I'd like to autostart firefox and thunderbird on e.g. 2 and 3-rd workspaces when login.

I'd like to avoid using auto-move-windows extension.\n\nA: The following is a program that will start another application and move it to a specified work space.\nYou should copy this into a file named move-at-start.sh, mark it executable, and put it somewhere in your home directory (i would suggest putting it in the ~/.local folder, but you can put it in your ~/bin or some other place if you prefer, just remember where you put it and what you named it).

Will there be any difference in the behavior of processes or any other change at system level?\nWhat are the advantages/disadvantages of one approach over the other?\n-Thanks\n\nA: Outside of windows is better because if it is inside of windows and if windows crash on you or if you don't want windows anymore than Ubuntu will not be bootable or gone.\n\nA: Wubi is not great. Your Ubuntu installation will likely inherit whatever problems your Windows installation had. I installed Ubuntu via Wubi once, and it was so painfully slow I ended up completely erasing the hard drive and redoing the installation.\n\nA: Inside/Outside should be replace with Internal/External Installation in question.\nWubi installation is fair for just try out means for a short time, you can use it. If you want to access Full features of Ubuntu, then you have to install alongside with different partition. External Installation will be Better.   \n", "Q: Installing 12.04 to dual boot: partitions not labeled \nPossible Duplicate:\nInstalling Ubuntu with Windows, which is left and right when allocating space? \n\nI am installing 12.04 from a CD on a computer with an existing Windows XP installation, which I would like to keep in case my mom can't handle Ubuntu. The problem is this:\nWhen selecting \"Install Ubuntu alongside them\", the next screen gives me a choice of selecting a drive (there is only one), and \"Allocate drive space by dragging the divider below:\", with two unlabeled partitions. Their sizes are shown, but their content is a mystery. Between the two sub-partitions (49.3 + 32.0 GB), it's just about the entire hard drive (82.3).\nMy question is this: is Ubuntu about to erase the Windows installation? Do I have to use the advanced partitioning tool? I would love to assume that one of these partitions will be given to Windows XP and the other to Ubuntu, but as they are not labeled, I am at a loss.\n\nA: In most of the scenario Windows XP will be installed in the first primary partition C:Drive.When you choose \"Install Ubuntu alongside with Windows\" Ubuntu will also be installed in the same partition. For Installing Ubuntu you need only 4.5GB but as you have 50GB space in your Windows partition you can give 10-12GB for Ubuntu. This is very simple process. If you want to create a custom partition layout. I will suggest you to copy all your data on the second partition to an external hard disk and then delete the partition. Then reboot the system with the CD and select the installation option \"Something else\" and create a primary partition for root file system(mount point /, file system ext4) that is 10-12GB. Leave the rest of the space as it is, which you can partition in Windows(Disk management) and this will be available in Ubuntu too. No need to crate a swap partition if you have enough RAM, and u can create swap Partition even after installation :) \n\nA: If you are not able to recognize partition. Then Abort installation. reboot your pc with windows. Check the Drives sizes. remember that Windows eats about 4 GB as for a paging so recognize carefully. \nExample: In Windows 7 partitions are \nC: 99Gb\nD: 99gb\nE: 49Gb\n\nLinux can show this partitions as below\nsda1/  103 GB\nsda2/  103 GB\nsda3/  53 GB\n\nNote that which partition is big Windows C: or created New by you.\nand starts Installation again. Select partition carefully.\n\nA: I had the same problem.  Ultimately, I booted into windows to fix it.  I downloaded a partition tool called \"easeus\", and used it to format the free space to ext3.  When I booted Ubuntu again from the Ubuntu CD, it recognized this partition, and I could be sure that I was not over-writing Windows. \nThere are several other free Windows applications to deal with partitions, but I chose that one because of the Linux support.  It worked as it should.\n", "Q: How to get Étoilé on ubuntu Étoilé is a Desktop environment.

Many people hate this thing (updating) their system due to the reason of slow bandwidth.\nSo I think it will better for Ubuntu and other Linux OS's to improve it as soon as possible. I suggest idea of developing any script by which people can only update for particular repository instead of whole one. thanks and please tell me if it only happening with my system .\n\nA: Thanks to the traditional Linux's system of installing software through official distribution specific repositories!! This system is called Package management system.\nAs described in the Wikipedia artcile: It is\n\na collection of software tools to automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner.\nIt typically maintains a database of software dependencies and version information to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites.\n\nThere is two point:\n\n*\n\n*Consistent manner in installing, upgrading, configuring and removing software packages.\n\n*Can maintains database of software dependencies and version information to prevent anomaly\n\nWhy is it required?\nLinux softwares are typically opensource and those kinds of softwares update very frequently. So, a management system is required to give OS consistent support of having updated packages.\nSome of the functions of package management software is: (quoting from Wikipedia)\n\n\n*\n\n*Verifying file checksums to ensure correct and complete packages;\n\n*Verifying digital signatures to authenticate the origin of packages;\n\n*Applying file archivers to manage encapsulated files;\n\n*Upgrading software with latest versions, typically from a software repository;\n\n*Grouping of packages by function to reduce user confusion;\n\n*Managing dependencies to ensure a package is installed with all packages it requires. This resolved the problem known as Dependency Hell.\n\n\nBenefits of this system\n\n*\n\n*You can instantly install,upgrade software from your repository by only doing a search\n\n*You can get updates without hassle, searching for updates in Web and going to the specific websites and downloading is not easier than just marking a package to update\n\n*Consistent system. There will be no conflict between packages\n\n*Distribution of software is easy in this system. Saves money and time to distribute those softwares\n\n*Better protection from malicious software, because there are strict chain of trust maintained in this system for package identification.\n\n*\"eliminate the need for manual installs and updates\". Just imagine how many clicks do you need to do to prepare a new Windows installation for your custom needs. But, In Ubuntu, if you have a list of packages of your choice, just feed the list to the system and all is installed with minimum user interaction.\n\nNote that, Microsoft is going to implement such kind of centralized software management in upcoming Windows version trough app-store. (though the system is not exactly like Linux package management system)\nDo I really need to do apt-get update for every piece of software?\nAs you said, you need to do sudo apt-get update for installing every piece of software. When the index file in your computer is matched exactly with the index file in online repository, apt-get do no update or download the index file, because, it first checks to see, whether an index file online has changed or not. So, it is not true that, you need to do apt-get update every time you install software. It is only needed when repository is updated online (which is not very frequent also. Most of the time, only \"updates\" channels are updated).\nWhat is the problem then?: I assume, you are using Ubuntu 12.04. Unfortunately, 12.04 has a bug which causes apt-get to download index files every time, even it is not updated. This bug is reported and will be fixed soon. You are advised to go to the bug link and check the appropriate checkbox to say, \"You too are affected for this bug\"\nThis problem is discussed in this question the size of apt-get update lists is too big. and the bug link is here http://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/1001780\nAny workaround?\nI do a trick to minimize my download size. I wrote this workaround in that answer. You can go to this link to check. https://askubuntu.com/a/151989/61218\nThe trick is, temporarily disable a repository whose index file is already download and then do a sudo apt-get update to update the interested repository list.

Of course if you've put your data on it since you created it it must be formatted and you shouldn't reformat it.\nI should explain that sudo fdisk -l does not verify that a partition has been formatted. The items like \"linux\" and \"W95 Ext'd (LBA)\" represent flags in the partition table (or extended partition information in this case) and have nothing to do with the actual contents of the partition. They represent what you told the disk partitioner what you intend to do with the partition. If you haven't yet formatted a partition the partition will contain random data.\nA superblock is a part of the formatting of an ext file system within a partition. It must exist to use the file system.\nI don't think this has anything to do with any of the other partitions.\nThis theory may be at odds with your comment on user13509's answer. I can't explain why sometimes fsck.ext4 could sometimes read /dev/sda6 and sometimes not. By the way, before you run it you must have the partition unmounted and must execute fsck.ext4 with sudo.\n", "Q: Do all Linux distros use the same kernel? By \"the same kernel\", I mean the one which was originally created by Torvalds and then updated by people here: http://www.kernel.org\nIs it true that different distros all keep the kernel unchanged(of course they will update the kernel when there is a new version from the above site), and only make changes to the various utilities of their own?\n\nA: All distros use the same \"Linux\" kernel, however all distros make slight changes to it in order make the kernel work best for them, however these changes will almost always get uploaded back to the top where Linus will merge them himself. So all use the Linux kernel, however they all have a few different lines of code in them to make them work best for that distro. It is also worth noting that distros will ship with the version of the kernel that they see fit for each version. Some distros choose a newer kernel then others. The main pro of a new kernel are improvements in driver's and hardware compatibility. The con is a loss in stability as all new code has bugs in it. So you trade features for stability. This is why distros known for being more stable will usually always ship an older kernel than the more risky distros. To find what kernel you are running enter: \nuname -r\n\nThis will show you what you are running in the version of Ubuntu you have on your computer currently. Hope you enjoy!\n\nA: Yes and No will be the answer.\n\"The Linux kernel\" is a fairly complicated piece of software which can be compiled in a number of different ways. Basically, a configuration file is set up with a laundry-list of options, and this file subsequently determines exactly which blocks of source-code are or are not included in \"the Linux kernel\" for your system. (The same process also determines which kernel modules are built.)\nGenerally speaking, a distro writer will do all of that \"heavy lifting\" for you:\nThey'll compile one or more kernels, using config options that they have carefully selected, and include those (in binary form) in their distributions. They might even include custom patches.\nSo, the answer to your question is both 'yes' and 'no'. \n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, several distros might use \"Linux version X.Y.Z.\"\n\n*No, they might not use the same configuration options when building it.   \n\n\nCourtesy: sundialsvcs' comment here.\nAlso check out this post on stackoverflow for some more related information.\n\nA: Yes, It is true, Ubuntu uses same kernel which was originally created by Linus Torvalds, but of course the updated version. \nThe kernels of Linux Distributions are updated from the original one and See this link to get the view of kernel version changes. \nUbuntu is based on latest stable linux version released, more correctly, it is based on the kernel of debian (more correctly, from debian unstable release, except the LTS's which are derived from Debian testing) and then add some more distro specific customization. \nSee these links for more information\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel\n\nA: They do use the same kernel uploaded at http://www.kernel.org.\nBut as per distribution , goals of their respective projects , to what Systems are they targeting their releases shapes the customization of their respective kernels.\nFor a rolling release it will be bleeding edge kernels , for a stable release it will based on Upstream stable release. \nFor example 3.5 is currently in Quantal release but 3.2 is for Stable Precise release and its future updates..\nUbuntu customized kernels are provided at  http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline .\nfedora customized kernels https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/kernel .\n\nThe best way to understand is for example following Ubuntu Kernel team development. \nrolling kernel upgrade policy for 14.04\nCanonical Kernel Team Voices\nKernel Roadmap\n\nA: Kernel get changes as per features requirement in different Linux distros.

I followed this tutorial, which uses fdisk to create a single partition of the maximum size reported by fdisk. I have choosen ext4 format. I then copied across all my media, which took some time. \nI am guessing that fidisk has a 2TB limit, because du is reporting this as the size. Is there any way to increase the size of the partition to 3TB without having to copy all my media over again?\n\nA: MBR partition only supports 4 primary partitions per hard drive, and a maximum partition size of 2TB.  That is why you're only seeing 2TB.\nGUID (GPT disks) can support a volume up to 18 EB (Exabyte’s) or 1 million terabytes.  \nSo you will have to change the partitioning scheme from MBR to GUID (GPT Disk) to be able to see the full capacity.\nNOTE: When dealing with partitions, always make sure that a backup is available in case something goes wrong.

If yes, please show me how?\nI use Ubuntu Server 12.\n\nA: Answer thanks to JoshP in Server Fault:\n\nI just recently did this.  See my\n  question.  It was kind of a\n  long back and forth, but I did get it set up in the end.  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Set up DNS.  The A record will point to your public IP.  So, yourdomain.com points to your.pub.ip.add.  Add CNAME records for the\n  subdomains.  So, sub1.yourdomain.com points to @, and\n  sub2.yourdomain.com points to @, etc.  Although the subdomains are\n  all pointing to the same address, the browser will confer to the\n  webserver which subdomain you are trying to reach.\n  \n*Set up Apache.  You'll want to set up Virtual Hosts for each subdomain (and maybe for primary domain as well).  You can define the\n  Virtual Hosts in different places... mine is defined in\n  /etc/apache2/sites-available, and includes the <Location>\n  directive, which is where you'll set up your reverse proxy.\n\nThis answer was given to OP in ServerFault.\n\nA: The easiest way would be to modify your hosts file, which is in /etc/.\nIt would look like this:\n# This is an example of the hosts file\n127.0.0.1  localhost loopback\n192.168.1.100 webserver\n192.168.1.101 sub1\n192.168.1.102 sub2\n\n\nA: Clients on your lan will need to have thier hosts file updated too unless you install and configure a DNS server too and have your clients use it.  dnsmasq is easy and has lots of helpful comments in the config file.  BIND is another but its config file uses a bizarre nonsensical syntax that nobody really understands.  Unbound is another one with a strong emphasis on security.\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you only have 1 public IP address (on inherently only 1 tcp port 80 on that), but you want to run 3 webservers of which only 1 is direcly public accessible (through a port forward).\nYou have 2 things to configure:\n\n\n*\n\n*DNS level: make sure www. sub1. sub2. all point to the same address as mydomain.com. This can be done in the configuration panel of your DNS registrar (look for a \"Wildcard\" option if available). This should allow you to ping sub1.mydomain.com and all other subdomains.\n\n*As all requests arrive on the server 192.168.1.100, you'll need to configure this webserver to forward requests for the subdomains to other (internal) servers.\n\n\nThe other servers can be accessed if you use the main webserver (.100) as a reverse proxy for the subdomains sub1. and sub2.\nI think this might be a good sample: sample httpd.conf with explanation\nNote: in the ProxyPass and ProxyReverse lines you'll have to use an internal hostname or IP address, not the sub1.mydomain.com because that will have you end up with a loop!\nIf it doesn't work with that website, here are the google search terms: vhost reverse proxy\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Dual monitor I have just installed Ubuntu 12.04 with 3 Monitors.

Except for package management systems and environments, I would like to know what the main differences are between them .\n\nA: There are several points between these two to differentiate them. In easy words differences are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Desktop enterprise edition (Business Desktop Remix) is free to use but RedHat is not.\n\n*Ubuntu focuses on Desktop users, in other hand Redhat main focus is Server platform.\n\n*Red Hat is made by Red Hat Inc. is founded by Young and Ewing while Ubuntu is headed by Shuttleworth, owner of Canonical Ltd. \n\n*Ubuntu is based on Debian (a very famous and stable Linux OS), but RedHat has nothing like this.\n\n*Ubuntu package manager file extension is .deb (which uses other Debian based OS i.e. Linux Mint), whether RedHat package manager file extension is .rpm (which means RedHat Package Manager).\n\n\nA: There are a few different ways to interpret \"Redhat\" here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Red-hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) - A specific, commercial distribution by Red Hat.\nBy far the biggest difference between Ubuntu and RHEL is the license terms - Red Hat Enterprise Linux is commercial.\nYou can, however, get basically the same distribution, but without the commercial contract, for free in the form of the CentOS distribution.\n\n*Distributions which are based on or inherit from Red Hat, which would also include CentOS and Fedora, and their derivatives.\nIt's actually very hard to compare Ubuntu against all those (RHEL, CentOS and Fedora) as if they are one thing, because they are all very different in themselves.  They do all share the same package manager as I talk about below, but the differences between them are greater than the difference between their package manager and Ubuntu's.\n\n*RPM-based distributions in general - that is, distributions that use the Redhat Package Management system.  This would expand your scope to include distributions like SUSE, Mandriva, PCLinuxOS, and their derivatives.\nUbuntu is based on Debian's package manager APT and DPKG.  Red Hat, CentOS and Fedora are based on the Red Hat Linux package management system, RPM.  Both package managers are now quite mature and have roughly equivalent features.  You could debate individual design decisions though but it's hard to say that one overall is better than the other.\n\nA: After many years using both,  I can say that the real differences are:\n\n\n*\n\n*H/W vendor support for various server hardware subsystems like:\n\n\n*\n\n*latest FiberChannel drivers\n\n*iSCSI offloading support\n\n*10Gbps Ethernet\n\n*online firmware (BIOS, NMI) updaters\n\n*SCSI storage accelerators\n\n*Software SCSI drivers (like for HP B Series)\n\n*BMC (Baseboard Management Controllers) drivers/updaters\n\n*Live Controller/RAID configuration\n\n*Hardware health monitoring and reporting\n\n*GUI server management/monitoring\n\n*etc\n\n\n\nAll of the above exist for RedHat through vendor repos, (and in almost all cases can be installed in centos) but for the .deb based distributions (like Ubuntu) you're usually out of luck or in rare cases you get something old that that will waste your time and will often break your system.\n\n\n*EPEL repo (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux): I've found that the EPEL repo (RedHat & CentOS) is not perfect but far more complete and updated than Ubuntu (official) repos, not so for desktop stuff but for server stuff. E.g. latest IPSEC packages, SaltStack, etc for which you would need to configure extra non-official repos in ubuntu.\n\n*Software support (e.g. software/security updates, new kernel drivers). Ubuntu offers 5years, while RedHat offers 10years. This support includes security updates and in RedHat's case, backporting kernel modules from more recent kernels! That means newer hardware is supported even when using old redhat/centos kernels/distros. That hardware may be chipsets, watchdog drivers, etc. \n5yr can be too binding for production use in my opinion (it can be fine for your laptop though where you can afford the time and risk to upgrade).\n\nA: \nRed Hat Enterprise Linux is not free, and its also used for business.Red Hat Linux, assembled by the company Red Hat, was a\n  popular Linux based operating system. Red Hat Linux 1.0 was released\n  on November 3, 1994. It was originally called “Red Hat Commercial\n  Linux” It is the first Linux distribution to use the packaging system,\n  the RPM Package Manager as its packaging format, and over time has\n  served as the starting point for several other distributions, such as\n  Mandriva Linux and Yellow Dog Linux.\nRed Hat’s Features: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Red Hat Linux introduced a graphical installer called Anaconda,    intended to be easy to use for novices, and which has since been\n  adopted by some other Linux distributions.\n  \n*It also introduced a built-in tool called Lokkit for configuring the    firewall capabilities.\n  \n*It uses .rpm package called Red Hat Package Manager.\n  \n  \n  RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a powerful command line driven package management system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying,\n  querying, and updating software packages.\nEach software package consists of an archive of files along with\n  information about the package like its version, a description, etc.\nUbuntu Ubuntu is an operating system, like windows.  Ubuntu is a Linux distribution that starts with the breadth of Debian and adds\n  regular releases (every six months), a clear focus on the user and\n  usability (it should “Just Work”, TM) and a commitment to security\n  updates with 18 months of support for every release. Ubuntu ships with\n  the latest Gnome release as well as a selection of server and desktop\n  software that makes for a comfortable desktop experience off a single\n  installation CD.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Ubuntu uses the.deb apt package:- Ubuntu uses .deb package for    package installation as like .rpm of Red Hat.\n  \n*Ubuntu also uses apt-get package installer to install packages by    using command mode. To install package Graphically, synaptic package\n  manager.\n  \n*Ubuntu is Debian based.1\n\n1Source:The Magnet Blog\n\nA: Main Difference is Ubuntu is based on Debian system. It uses .deb packages. While RHEL uses it own package system .rpm (red hat package manager ).\nRHEL is free but it is charged for support (updates), when Ubuntu is totally free with support for desktop users only professional support is chargeable.  \n", "Q: What are the differences between \"md5sum\" and \"sha256sum\"? Why we need two tools for verifying ISO . is there any specific things to consider between them ? \n\nA: From How To SHA256 SUM page\n\nThe program sha256sum is designed to verify data integrity using the\n  SHA-256 (SHA-2 family with a digest length of 256 bits). SHA-256\n  hashes used properly can confirm both file integrity and\n  authenticity. SHA-256 serves a similar purpose to a prior algorithm\n  recommended by Ubuntu, MD5, but is less vulnerable to attack.\n  In terms of security, cryptographic hashes such as SHA-256 allow for authentication of data obtained from insecure mirrors. \n\nFrom  How to MD5SUM\n\nThe program md5sum is designed to verify data integrity using the MD5\n  (Message-Digest algorithm 5) 128-bit cryptographic hash. MD5\n  hashes used properly can confirm both file integrity and authenticity.\n   The MD5 hash must be signed or come from a secure source (an HTTPS page) of an organization you trust.\n  While security flaws in the MD5 algorithm have been uncovered, MD5 hashes are still useful when you trust the organization that produces them. \n\nBasically it is measure of security concern. If you are using Unofficial Mirrors for downloading the ISO's then probably both can be used to make sure the integrity of file.\n\nA: \nShort answer: For verifying ISOs, there is no practical difference, use whichever you want, as long as you trust the source providing the sums. MD5 is/used to be the standard, but the computing world is moving towards adopting SHA since it is newer and \"better\" for the future; hence, SHA sums are often provided as an alternative.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*md5sum and sha256sum are programs which implement the MD5 and SHA-256 hash algorithms respectively\n\n*In general, a hash algorithm takes an input of any (arbitrary) length and runs mathematical computations on it to produce a relatively small, fixed-length output, called a \"hash\" (or \"sum\")\n\n*Verifying data integrity (e.g. ISOs) is only one of the many uses for hashes\n\n*The primary difference between the older MD5 and the newer SHA-256 hashes is that MD5 produces a 128-bit output while SHA-256 produces a 256-bit output\n\n*For verifying data (ISOs) to work, the hash of the data must effectively be unique, so that no other data produces the same MD5 sum or SHA-256 sum.\n\n*\n\n*In theory, this is possible, i.e. two sets of input data produce the same output hash, called a \"collision\".\n\n*The chance of such collisions is lower with SHA-256 compared to MD5 because its 256-bit hash is double the size of MD5's 128-bit hash.\n\n*In practice, the chance of a collision when verifying ISOs, even with MD5 is zero given the 100+ MB size of ISOs.\n\n\n*Still, since the computing world is moving towards SHA because it is a newer and \"better\" hash for the future, ISO checksums are often provided in multiple formats.\n\n\nA: MD5 and SHA-2 are different hashing algorithms. Its up to the developer(s) to decide what they want to use as an easy way to check data integrity.\nIn this case they are used to 'achieve' the same thing however the results (the hash) are completely diferent.\n\nA: An alternative to md5sum validation is the sha1 and sha256 sums as explained above.\nSuppose you download or torrent the latest ISO from the releases site, say Raring. Notice at the top there's a  file called SHA1SUMS as well as a SHA256SUMS, each with a long number for each .iso file.\nOnce your download of the .iso file is complete, you can calculate the sha1 or sha256 sum for it to make sure it matches the value in the SHA1SUMS file.  You can do this with rhash.\nFirst install it. If on Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install rhash\n\nFor other operating systems, you can download it here.\nThen calculate the sha1 or sha256 sum for the file you downloaded. For example for the ubuntu-13.04-desktop-amd64.iso I downloaded:\n$ rhash --sha1 ubuntu-13.04-desktop-amd64.iso\nffed440f1dc1b43d9c170bd21e5ff669a59447f8  ubuntu-13.04-desktop-amd64.iso\n$\n$ rhash --sha256 ubuntu-13.04-desktop-amd64.iso\nb4b20e0293c2305e83a60c605d39cabf43115794d574c68f1492d49fee0ab3d8  ubuntu-13.04-desktop-amd64.iso\n$ \n\nThe values respectively match the ones in the SHA1SUMS and SHA256SUMS files, validating the download.\nYou can also run rhash --md5 ubuntu-13.04-desktop-amd64.iso and compare to the MD5SUMS file.\n", "Q: Black Screen after installing recommended Nvidia drivers. What to do? \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? \n\nNew to Ubuntu.\nProblem description:\nUntil recently I had Windows on my computer.  My hard disk is divided into two partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*On the first one (app. 10 GB) I had my Windows XP\n\n*On the second one (app. 30 GB) I have  some data\n\n\nI tried to install Ubuntu 12.04 on the first partition (the smaller one). Since I wanted to keep the data on my second partition, I chose the third install option.\nDuring the installation process I deleted the data on partition one, created a new partition with the same size, formatted it as ext4 and mounted / on it. The installation continued fine and at the end I restarted and took the CD out when it ejected automatically (it could have been also before the restart). \nUbuntu started but I noticed that my computer was slow. Then a prompt appeared telling me that I did not have the optimal NVidia drivers and recommended to install a specific one. I clicked on the recommended driver, installation went apparently just fine and at the end I had to restart the system again. I did it, Ubuntu started, asked for my password, I typed it, pressed Enter, the screen turned black and remained like that (only the cursor was there and I could move it). I restarted and the same thing happened again.\nHas anyone had such a problem before and was able to solve it?\nWith Windows I always installed drivers from CDs after installing Windows. Are the same CDs going to work for Ubuntu too or I should find special drivers?\nP.S. During the installation I was connected to the internet and I agreed on installing updates and the third party software.  \nIn the time before I installed that problematic but recommended NVidia driver I checked that there was between 6 and 7 GB free space on the first partition where I installed Ubuntu.\n\nA: Mostly nvidia drivers work well when you install option like \"Nvidia drivers (recommended)\" but sometimes not. Usually Ubuntu drivers app suggests more than one driver version, you should play around. If recommended went wrong you could reinstall and try newer driver version.or older. Since reinstalling takes time, it may not sound as a solution, on the other hand you are newbie, therefore it may take less time than to debug the problem. \nYou could press Ctrl+Alt+F1 or (F2,F3..) where you could login with your username and password and get into terminal, there you can type :\nsudo tail -100 /var/log/syslog \n\nand read some details about nvidia failing.\nRestart X server instead of all system, from terminal type :\nsudo /etc/inid.d/lightdm restart \n\nfor getting back into login screen (it can also be instead of lightdm xdm or gdm it depends on which version of ubuntu you installed xubuntu kubuntu etc.) \nApart from your video drivers problem you should be very careful about your data you don't want to lose on second partition. Even though it should be safe, before making any installation, it would be a good idea to back it up before playing around, especially if you are new to Linux, you never know when you will press the wrong button.\nIf you have a 1GB or less ram in your system I would recommend while partitioning your disk to create 512mb-1gb partition defined as a swap, which works like pagefile in windows. Whenever system is out of ram it uses hdd for storing chunks of data. I have seen very interesting linux machines behaviour after they get into \"out of ram situation\".\nAlso make sure your root partition does not run out of space, you can check in terminal typing df -h what is the usage of your root partition.\n", "Q: Webapp integration in Firefox doesnt show \nPossible Duplicate:\nI don't see the Unity section in Firefox preferences \n\nIn Firefox the webapp integration doesnt show. in chrome it does.

First, run xinput list to find the device number of your mouse:\n$ xinput list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                          id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                         id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nOn my laptop, the device id I want is 10 (SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad). On your system, you will have to decide which device is the correct one. Next, run xinput list-props <your device id> to see the current settings for that device:\n$ xinput list-props 10\nDevice 'SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad':\n    Device Enabled (144):   1\n    Device Accel Profile (266):     1\n    Device Accel Constant Deceleration (267):       2.500000\n    Device Accel Adaptive Deceleration (268):       1.000000\n    Device Accel Velocity Scaling (269):    12.500000\n  [ many more settings omitted ]\n\nThe property you are interested in is \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration (267)\". To slow your mouse down, the value must be increased by running xinput set-prop <your device id> <property id> <value>:\n$ xinput set-prop 10 267 5.0\n\nIn this example, the value is increased from 2.5 to 5.0 and the mouse moves at half-speed.\n\nA: Given what the above post had said, I found this work around.\nThe fact is that the mouse move at a constant multiple of base speed, where the multiple is set by the \"acceleration\" parameter.\nHowever, this multiplier is applied only after your mouse move faster than a \"threshold\" speed, specified by the \"sensitivity\" parameter.\nThis creates the awkward feel of \"acceleration\" where if you start to move your mouse fast, it begins to jump around uncontrollably as it moves past the threshold speed.\nSo what you can do is setting the \"sensitivity\" to 0, thus making the threshold to be 0. What this does is your acceleration is applied all the time to your mouse speed.\nThen your mouse speed is just a multiple of your \"acceleration\" parameter, and since it is a linear multiplication, you should have a constant speed proportional to the acceleration parameter. Without the feeling of acceleration and jumps.\nSo in short:\nSet sensitivity to 0.\nAdjust the parameter \"acceleration\" as if it is \"speed\"\n\nA: Just force the pointer to skip pixels, here's how:\nFirst list input devices:\n$ xinput list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                          id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ PixArt USB Optical Mouse                  id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad                  id=15   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                         id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                              id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ USB2.0 UVC 2M WebCam                      id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Asus Laptop extra buttons                 id=13   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=14   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳   USB Keyboard                            id=11   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳   USB Keyboard                            id=12   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nIn the example we see the mouse is PixArt USB Optical Mouse.

Documentation says it is used to calculate a pointer movement. Quoting:\n\nBy default, the CTM for every input device in X is the identity\n  matrix. As an example, lets say you touch a touchscreen at point (400,\n  197) on the screen:\n⎡ 1 0 0 ⎤   ⎡ 400 ⎤   ⎡ 400 ⎤\n⎜ 0 1 0 ⎥ · ⎜ 197 ⎥ = ⎜ 197 ⎥\n⎣ 0 0 1 ⎦   ⎣  1  ⎦   ⎣  1  ⎦\n\nThe X and Y coordinates of the device event are input in the second\n  matrix of the calculation. The result of the calculation is where the\n  X and Y coordinates of the event are mapped to the screen. As shown,\n  the identity matrix maps the device coordinates to the screen\n  coordinates without any changes.\n\nSo, we want to increase X and Y values, leaving the rest unchanged. An example from my PC:\n\n$ xinput set-prop \"PixArt USB Optical Mouse\" \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\" 2.4 0 0 0 2.4 0 0 0 1\n\nPlay a bit with this until you're satisfied with the speed.\nThese changes are active only for the current session, so once you've chosen a good sensitivity, you may apply it permanently by adding it to xorg.conf (or creating a file like /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-mouse-sensitivity.conf):\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"PixArt USB Optical Mouse\"\n    MatchIsPointer \"Yes\"\n    Option \"TransformationMatrix\" \"2.4 0 0 0 2.4 0 0 0 1\"\nEndSection\n\nthanks go to Simon Thum from Xorg mailing list for giving a hint about the matrix.\nUPD: note, some Windows games running in Wine may start exhibiting odd pointer behavior (e.g. it was noted that crosshair in Counter Strike 1.6 declines down until it stares the floor no matter how you move the mouse), in this case just reset X and Y of CTM back to 1 before running the game.\n\nA: The answers above are now outdated. What has worked for me the most neatly is the last section of this wiki entry:\n\nwith libinput\nAlternatively, since libinput-1.1.0-1 and xf86-input-libinput-0.15.0-1\n  you can use a flat acceleration profile. To enable it create the\n  following file:\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf\nSection \"InputClass\"  Identifier \"My Mouse\"   Driver \"libinput\"\n    MatchIsPointer \"yes\"    Option \"AccelProfile\" \"flat\"    Option\n  \"AccelSpeed\" \"0\" EndSection\nand restart X.\nAnother option is this command:\n$ xinput --set-prop  'libinput Accel Profile Enabled' 0, 1\nWhich doesn't need an X restart, but isn't persistent. Although it can\n  be set up to run automatically with Autostarting.\n\n\nA: The terminology of the mouse settings in Linux (Xorg) are slightly different from the windows world.\nThere are three important settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*threshold - The trigger for acceleration\n\n*acceleration - The speed after the threshold has been reached\n\n*resolution - The \"speed\"\n\n\nThese settings are independent of the Desktop Environment. They are pure X settings. So this always works. See also the mouse section of xset for a truly independent way to change these settings.\nThe Unity settings manager seems to rename the threshold to sensitivity. But as you are talking about KDE, that should not matter.\nOnly threshold and acceleration can be changed by the user. The resolution is a setting to be made in xorg.conf. But usually, the first two settings are enough for most users.\nLinuxreviews has an explanation of these values.\nBasically: The mouse moves at a base speed (modifiable using resolution). If the mouse moves n pixels (n = threshold) in a short time, then the base speed is multiplied with acceleration. As an example, if you want to disable acceleration completely, you can set the threshold to 0. In words: If the mouse moves 0 pixels in a short time, I'll use base-speed * acceleration. So a threshold of 0 gives you constant mouse-speed.\nSo, these two values give you a very fine grained control over the speed.\n\nA: Personally I find that precise pointer motion is better for overall desktop experience, so this setting is important for me too. I was always wondering why OS UXP designers not only make acceleration the default, but also tend to remove control from user interface.\nYou might find that the acceleration, which supposed to get you more comfortable UXP is actually undesirable in some situations, as you could miss the right UI elements on screen when moving mouse fast, or just need precision for some CAD application. Specifically, it's difficult to get in control of slider and spinner UI elements or move a shape on some designer's UI. Also, with acceleration, it's difficult to position the mouse cursor in a text editor precisely as you copy-paste a region of text. Some might argue that when you need to get precision you just slow down, but what if you don't want to slow down, and still get precision?\nYou can check if there is acceleration or not:\n(1). Move your mouse pointer to the right of the screen, notice the physical position of the device on the table.\n(2). Moderately move the mouse to the left a little bit, so the cursor travels around the center of screen, and then very slowly return the physical device to it's original position.\n(3). Repeat steps (1) and (2) multiple times.\nIf there is no acceleration, the cursor should arrive to the right of screen all of the time. If there is acceleration, the pointer would move more and more to the left, so after 3 or 4 times it would just hit the left of the screen, so you need to fix it.\nNo acceleration means you need to adjust the\nDevice Accel Velocity Scaling parameter.\nIt will slow down mouse motion in general, so you need to compensate for that with constant speed adjustment. This can be done with decreasing the Device Accel Constant Deceleration parameter.\nHere is what worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the mouse device id:\n\n\n\n$ xinput list\n...\n⎜   ↳ PixArt USB Optical Mouse                  id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n...\n\nThe device id = 10\n\n\n*List properties of the device\n\n\n\n$ xinput list-props 10\n...\nDevice Accel Constant Deceleration (276):   1.000000\n...\nDevice Accel Velocity Scaling (278):    10.000000\n...\n\n\n\n*Reduce the scaling parameter to its minimum, this should give one-to one mouse motion with respect to actual physical movement. Whether you set it to something like 0.1, 0.001 or 1e-30 does not matter, as it's much lower acceleration than the default of 10.0. You can't set it to zero, as it's considered an error.\n\n\n\n$ xinput set-prop 10 278 1e-10\n\n\n\n*(optional) Now you might notice that despite being precise, speed have been decreased in general, so you might need to play with the Constant Deceleration parameter to restore comfortable speed. In my case a comfortable setting was 0.7 which sped up the pointer by half, made mouse motion feeling like about the same speed that was before, but without acceleration:\n\n\n\n$ xinput set-prop 10 276 0.7\n\nIf you want it faster, set a lower value here, like 0.5, 0.4 etc.\nIf you want it slower, set it to something like 1.0, 1.2, or even 1.5\n\nA: \n  How to adjust mouse speed in KDE\n  \n*\n    \n*without enabling mouse acceleration\n    \n*and only using the settigns dialog (no console, no config files)\n  \n\nThis is a colloquial summary of exhuma's answer, don't forget to upvote it.\nIn KDE, mouse acceleration is not logarithmic. That is, it has two constant mouse speeds: non-accelerated and accelerated. It switches from one to another when you jerk the mouse quickly enough.\nThe first speed is non-configurable (at least, from GUI). The second speed is configurable.\nThe solution is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set \"Pointer threshold\" to 0. As a result, the second speed will be applied at all times. \n\n*Adjust \"Pointer acceleration\" to make that speed bigger or smaller.\n\n\nYou will end up with a constant, non-dynamic cursor speed adjusted to your liking.\n\nA: If you have a logitech gaming mouse you can use piper or if you have a razer mouse you can use qrazercfg. these programs should already be in the repo (so sudo apt install qrazercfg, for example). When forcing a flat accel profile (no acceleration) the mouses set dpi will move at 1/2 the speed that it should, so I simply double the mouses dpi in these programs when I'm on GNU/Linux, and it feels correct.\nHowever if you're using a mouse whos dpi can't be adjusted you simply have to live with half sens or butcher your ability to move in a 3d environment via transformation matrix adjustment.\n", "Q: Can't access certain websites in 12.04 I am using 12.04.

Also you can string together more than one input or output (inputs will be read sequentially and all output will be written to each output file): cat >outfile1 >outfile2 <infile1 <infile2. The target or source of a redirect can be either a filename or the name of a stream (like &1, at least in bash).\nBut pipes totally separate one command from another command, you can't mix them in with arguments: \n[command1] | [command2]\n\nThe pipe takes everything written to standard output from command1 and sends it to the standard input of command2.\nYou can also combine piping and redirection. For example:\ncat <infile >outfile | cat <infile2 >outfile2\n\nThe first cat will read lines from infile, then simultaneously write each line to outfile and send it to the second cat.\nIn the second cat, standard input first reads from the pipe (the contents of infile), then reads from infile2, writing each line to outfile2. After running this, outfile will be a copy of infile, and outfile2 will contain infile followed by infile2.\nFinally, you actually do something really similar to your example using \"here string\" redirection (bash family only) and backticks:\ngrep blah <<<`ls`\n\nwill give the same result as\nls | grep blah\n\nBut I think the redirection version will first read all of the output of ls into a buffer (in memory), and then feed that buffer to grep one line at a time, whereas the piped version will take each line from ls as it emerges, and pass that line to grep.\n\nA: Pipe is used to pass output to another program or utility.   \nRedirect is used to pass output to either a file or stream.\nExample: thing1 > thing2 vs thing1 | thing2\nthing1 > thing2\n\n\n*\n\n*Your shell will run the program named thing1\n\n*Everything that thing1 outputs will be placed in a file called thing2.  (Note - if thing2 exists, it will be overwritten)\n\n\nIf you want to pass the output from program thing1 to a program called thing2, you could do the following:\nthing1 > temp_file && thing2 < temp_file\nwhich would\n\n\n*\n\n*run program named thing1\n\n*save the output into a file named temp_file\n\n*run program named thing2, pretending that the person at the keyboard typed the contents of temp_file as the input.\n\n\nHowever, that's clunky, so they made pipes as a simpler way to do that. thing1 | thing2 does the same thing as thing1 > temp_file && thing2 < temp_file\nEDIT to provide more details to question in comment:\nIf > tried to be both \"pass to program\" and \"write to file\", it could cause problems in both directions.\nFirst example: You are trying to write to a file.  There already exists a file with that name that you wish to overwrite.  However, the file is executable.  Presumably, it would try to execute this file, passing the input.  You'd have to do something like write the output to a new filename, then rename the file.\nSecond example: As Florian Diesch pointed out, what if there's another command elsewhere in the system with the same name (that is in the execute path).  If you intended to make a file with that name in your current folder, you'd be stuck.\nThirdly: if you mis-type a command, it wouldn't warn you that the command doesn't exist.  Right now, if you type ls | gerp log.txt it will tell you bash: gerp: command not found.  If > meant both, it would simply create a new file for you (then warn it doesn't know what to do with log.txt).\n\nA: From the Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook:\n\nRedirection\nThe shell interprets the symbols <,>, and >> as instructions to reroute a command's input or output to or from a file.\nPipes\nTo connect the STDOUT of one command to the STDIN of another use the | symbol, commonly known as a pipe.\n\nSo my interpretation is:  If it's command to command, use a pipe.  If you are outputting to or from a file use the redirect.\n\nA: To add to the other answers, there are subtle semantic difference too - e.g. pipes close more readily than redirects:\nseq 5 | (head -n1; head -n1)                # just 1\nseq 5 > tmp5; (head -n1; head -n1) < tmp5   # 1 and 2\nseq 5 | (read LINE; echo $LINE; head -n1)   # 1 and 2\n\nIn the first example, when the first call to head finishes, it closes the pipe, and seq terminates, so there's no input available for the second head.\nIn the second example, head consumes the first line, but when it closes it's own stdin pipe, the file remains open for the next call to use.\nThe third example shows that if we use read to avoid closing the pipe it is still available within the subprocess.\nSo the \"stream\" is the thing that we shunt data through (stdin etc), and is the same in both cases, but the pipe connects streams from two processes, where a redirection connects a streams between a process and a file, so you can see source of both the similarities and differences.\nP.S. If you're as curious about and/or surprised by those examples as I was, you can get dig in further using trap to see how the processes resolve, E.g:\n(trap 'echo seq EXITed >&2' EXIT; seq 5) | (trap 'echo all done' EXIT; (trap 'echo first head exited' EXIT; head -n1)\necho '.'\n(trap 'echo second head exited' EXIT; head -n1))\n\nSometimes the first process closes before 1 is printed, sometimes afterwards.\nI also found it interesting to use exec <&- to close the stream from the redirection to approximate the behaviour of the pipe (albeit with an error):\nseq 5 > tmp5\n(trap 'echo all done' EXIT\n(trap 'echo first head exited' EXIT; head -n1)\necho '.'\nexec <&-\n(trap 'echo second head exited' EXIT; head -n1)) < tmp5`\n\n\nA: If the meaning of foo > bar would depend on whether there is a command named bar that would make using redirection a lot harder and more error prone: Every time I want to redirect to  a file I first had to check whether there's a command named like my destination file.\n\nA: I've hit a problem with this in C today. Essentially Pipe's have different semantics to redirects as well, even when sent to stdin. Really I think given the differences, pipes should go somewhere other than stdin, so that stdin and lets call it stdpipe (to make an arbitrary differential) can be handled in different ways.\nConsider this. When piping one program output to another fstat seems to return zero as the st_size despite ls -lha /proc/{PID}/fd showing that there is a file. When redirecting a file this is not the case (at least on debian wheezy, stretch and jessie vanilla and ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 vanilla.\nIf you cat /proc/{PID}/fd/0 with a redirection you'll be able to repeat to read as many times as you like. If you do this with a pipe you'll notice that the second time you run the task consecutively, you don't get the same output.\n\nA: Note:The answer reflects my own understanding of these mechanisms up to date, accumulated over research and reading of the answers by the peers on this site and unix.stackexchange.com, and will be updated as time goes on. Don't hesitate to ask questions or suggest improvements in the comments. I also suggest you try to see how syscalls work in shell with strace command. Also please don't be intimidated by the notion of internals or syscalls - you don't have to know or be able to use them in order to understand how shell does things, but they definitely help understanding.\nTL;DR\n\n\n*\n\n*| pipes are not associated with an entry on disk, therefore do not have an inode number of disk filesystem (but do have inode in pipefs virtual filesystem in kernel-space), but redirections often involve files, which do have disk entries and therefore have corresponding inode.\n\n*pipes are not lseek()'able so commands can't read some data and then rewind back, but when you redirect with > or < usually it's a file which is lseek() able object, so commands can navigate however they please.\n\n*redirections are manipulations on file descriptors, which can be many; pipes have only two file descriptors - one for left command and one for right command\n\n*redirection on standard streams and pipes are both buffered.\n\n*pipes almost always involve forking and therefore pairs of processes are involved; redirections - not always, though in both cases resulting file descriptors are inherited by sub-processes. \n\n*pipes always connect file descriptors (a pair), redirections - either use a pathname or file descriptors.\n\n*pipes are Inter-Process Communication method, while redirections are just manipulations on open files or file-like objects\n\n*both employ dup2() syscalls underneath the hood to provide copies of file descriptors, where actual flow of data occurs.\n\n*redirections can be applied \"globally\" with exec built-in command ( see this and this ), so if you do exec > output.txt every command will write to output.txt from then on. | pipes are applied only for current command (which means either simple command or subshell like seq 5 | (head -n1; head -n2) or compound commands (but also please note that for such compound commands the amount of bytes that read() consumes will influence how much data is left on the sending end of the pipe for other commands inside the read end of the pipe ).\n\n*When redirection is done on files, things like echo \"TEST\" > file and echo \"TEST\" >> file both use open() syscall on that file (see also) and get file descriptor from it to pass it to dup2().  Pipes | only use pipe() and dup2() syscall.\n\n*Redirections involve file and directory permissions; anonymous pipes typically do not involve permissions (i.e. whether or not you can or cannot create a pipe), but named pipes ( made with mkfifo ) do involve typical file permissions and read-write-execute bits. \n\n*As far as commands being executed, pipes and redirection are no more than file descriptors - file-like objects, to which they may write blindly, or manipulate them internally (which may produce unexpected behaviors; apt for instance, tends to not even write to stdout if it knows there's redirection).\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn order to understand how these two mechanisms differ, it's necessary to understand their essential properties, the history behind the two, and their roots in C programming language. In fact, knowing what file descriptors are, and how dup2() and pipe() system calls work is essential, as well as lseek(). Shell is meant as a way of making these mechanisms abstract to the user, but digging deeper than the abstraction helps understand the true nature of shell's behavior.\nThe Origins of Redirections and Pipes\nAccording to Dennis Ritche's article Prophetic Petroglyphs, pipes originated from a 1964 internal memo by Malcolm Douglas McIlroy, at the time when they were working on Multics operating system. Quote:\n\nTo put my strongest concerns into a nutshell:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*We should have some ways of connecting programs like garden hose--screw in another segment when it becomes when it becomes necessary to massage data in another way. This is the way of IO also.\n  \n\nWhat's apparent is that at the time programs were capable of writing to disk, however that was inefficient if output was large. To quote Brian Kernighan's explanation in Unix Pipeline video :\n\nFirst, you don't have to write one big massive program - you've got existing smaller programs that may already do parts of the job...Another is that it's possible that the amount of data you're procesing would not fit if you stored it in a file...because remember, we're back in the days when disks on these things had, if you were lucky, a Megabyte or two of data...So the pipeline never had to instantiate the whole output.\n\nThus conceptual difference is apparent: pipes are a mechanism of making programs talk to one another. Redirections - are way of writing to file at basic level. In both cases, shell makes these two things easy, but underneath the hood, there's whole lot of going on.  \nGoing deeper: syscalls and internal workings of the shell\nWe start with the notion of file descriptor. File descriptors describe basically an open file (whether that's a file on disk, or in memory, or anonymous file), which is represented by an integer number. The two standard data streams  (stdin,stdout,stderr) are file descriptors 0,1, and 2 respectively.  Where do they come from ? Well, in shell commands the file descriptors are inherited from their parent - shell. And it's true in general for all processes - child process inherits parent's file descriptors. For daemons it is common to close all inherited file descriptors and/or redirect to other places.\nBack to redirection. What is it really ? It's a mechanism that tells the shell to prepare file descriptors for command (because redirections are done by shell before command runs), and point them where the user suggested. The standard definition of output redirection is\n[n]>word\n\nThat [n] there is the file descriptor number. When you do echo \"Something\" > /dev/null the number 1 is implied there, and echo 2> /dev/null. \nUnderneath the hood this is done by duplicating file descriptor via dup2() system call. Let's take df > /dev/null. The shell will create a child process where df runs, but before that it will open /dev/null as file descriptor #3, and dup2(3,1) will be issued, which makes a copy of file descriptor 3 and the copy will be 1. You know how you have two files file1.txt and file2.txt, and when you do cp file1.txt file2.txt you'll have two same files, but you can manipulate them independently ? That's kinda the same thing happening here. Often you can see that before running, the bash will do dup(1,10) to make a copy file descriptor #1 which is stdout ( and that copy will be fd #10 ) in order to restore it later. Important is to note that when you consider built-in commands (which are part of shell itself, and have no file in /bin or elsewhere) or simple commands in non-interactive shell, the shell doesn't create a child process. \nAnd then we have things like [n]>&[m] and [n]&<[m]. This is duplicating file descriptors, which the same mechanism as dup2() only now it's in the shell syntax, conveniently available for the user.  \nOne of the important things to note about redirection is that their order is not fixed, but is significant to how shell interprets what user wants. Compare the following:\n# Make copy of where fd 2 points , then redirect fd 2\n$ ls -l /proc/self/fd/  3>&2  2> /dev/null\ntotal 0\nlrwx------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 00:08 0 -> /dev/pts/0\nlrwx------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 00:08 1 -> /dev/pts/0\nl-wx------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 00:08 2 -> /dev/null\nlrwx------ 1 runner user 64 Sep 13 00:08 3 -> /dev/pts/0\nlr-x------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 00:08 4 -> /proc/29/fd\n\n# redirect fd #2 first, then clone it\n$ ls -l /proc/self/fd/    2> /dev/null 3>&2\ntotal 0\nlrwx------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 00:08 0 -> /dev/pts/0\nlrwx------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 00:08 1 -> /dev/pts/0\nl-wx------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 00:08 2 -> /dev/null\nl-wx------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 00:08 3 -> /dev/null\nlr-x------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 00:08 4 -> /proc/31/fd\n\nThe practical use of these in shell scripting can be versatile:\n\n\n*\n\n*saving output to variable of a program that only writes to stderr\n\n*swapping stderr and stdout\n\n*separating even input lines from odd input lines\nand many other.\nPlumbing with pipe() and dup2()\nSo how do pipes get created ? Via pipe() syscall, which will take as input an array (aka list) called pipefd of two items of type int (integer). Those two integers are file descriptors. The pipefd[0] will be the read end of the pipe and pipefd[1] will be the write end. So in df | grep 'foo', grep will get copy of pipefd[0] and  df will get a copy of pipefd[1]. But how ? Of course, with the magic of dup2() syscall. For df in our example, let's say pipefd[1] has #4, so the shell will make a child, do dup2(4,1) (remember my  cp example ?), and then do execve() to actually run df. Naturally, df will inherit file descriptor #1, but will be unaware that it's no longer pointing at terminal, but actually fd #4, which is actually the write end of the pipe. Naturally, same thing will occur with grep 'foo' except with different numbers of file descriptors.  \nNow, interesting question: could we make pipes that redirect fd #2 as well, not just fd #1 ? Yes, in fact that's what |& does in bash.  The POSIX standard requires shell command language to support df 2>&1 | grep 'foo' syntax for that purpose, but bash does |& as well.\nWhat's important to note is that pipes always deal with file descriptors. There exists FIFO or named pipe, which has a filename on disk and let's you use it as a file, but behaves like a pipe. But the | types of pipes are what's known as anonymous pipe - they have no filename, because they're really just two objects connected together. The fact that we're not dealing with files also makes an important implication: pipes aren't lseek()'able. Files, either in memory or on disk, are static - programs can use lseek() syscall to jump to byte 120, then back to byte 10, then forward all the way to the end. Pipes are not static - they're sequential, and therefore you cannot rewind data you get from them with lseek(). This is what makes some programs aware if they're reading from file or from pipe, and thus they can make necessary adjustments for efficient performance; in other words, a prog can detect if I do cat file.txt | prog or prog < input.txt. Real work example of that is tail.\nThe other two very interesting property of pipes is that they have a buffer, which on Linux is 4096 bytes, and they actually have a filesystem as defined in Linux source code ! They're not simply an object for passing data around, they are a datastructure themselves ! In fact, because there exists pipefs filesystem, which manages both pipes and FIFOs,  pipes have an inode number on their respective filesystem:\n# Stdout of ls is wired to pipe\n$ ls -l /proc/self/fd/  | cat  \nlrwx------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 00:02 0 -> /dev/pts/0\nl-wx------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 00:02 1 -> pipe:[15655630]\nlrwx------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 00:02 2 -> /dev/pts/0\nlr-x------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 00:02 3 -> /proc/22/fd\n# stdin of ls is wired to pipe\n$ true | ls -l /proc/self/fd/0\nlr-x------ 1 user user 64 Sep 13 03:58 /proc/self/fd/0 -> 'pipe:[54741]'\n\nOn Linux pipes are uni-directional, just like redirection. On some Unix-like implementations - there are bi-directional pipes. Although with magic of shell scripting, you can make bi-directional pipes on Linux as well.\nSee Also:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to make output of any shell command unbuffered?\n\n*Wikipedia example of how pipeline is created in C using pipe() syscall and dup2().\n\n*why pipes are used instead of input redirection\n\n*What is the differences between &> and 2>&1\n\n*Redirections such as <<,<<< are implemented as anonymous (unlinked) temp files in bash and ksh, while < <() uses anonymous pipes ; /bin/dash uses pipes for <<. See What's the difference between <<, <<< and < < in bash?\n\nA: There's a vital difference between the two operators:\n\n\n*\n\n*ls > log.txt --> This command sends the output to the log.txt file.\n\n*ls | grep file.txt --> This command sends the output of the ls to grep command through the use of pipe (|), and the grep command searches for file.txt in the in the input provided to it by the previous command.\nIf you had to perform the same task using the first scenario, then it would be:\nls > log.txt; grep 'file.txt' log.txt\n\nSo a pipe (with |) is used to send the output to other command, whereas redirection (with >) is used to redirect the output to some file.\n", "Q: Interrupting apt-get dist-upgrade: what could happen?

Are there any mechanism that prevents the packages from being left in a 'dirty' state? If not, how to prevent that?\n\nA: Worst case scenario it can break your system making it impossible to boot normaly, but you can always boot into rescue mode and fix it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the rescue mode by booting with an Ubuntu install CDROM and entering “rescue” at the boot prompt \n\n*Mount all of your partitions and to perform a chroot to /target where the root partition is mounted.\n\n*After the system has booted to the menu, select the item that says “Drop to root shell prompt with networking”. This provides you with the ability to update the software packages from the Internet.\n\n*When the prompt appears, start by making sure that all currently installed programs are configured:\n\ndpkg --configure -a\n\nThis may take a long time, depending on how many programs were installed before the system stopped. \n\n\n*\n\n*Then go ahead and update the current list of packages:\n\n\n\napt-get update\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Following this, upgrade the software on the system:\n\n\n\napt-get upgrade\n\nThis last step, again, may take a long time to complete. You should pay attention to the list of packages held back (listed at the top of the output from this command); these packages will have to be requested specifically. \nUsually, packages are held back because they require new software or other drastic changes: the Linux kernel is always held back. Use a command like this one to install these packages:\n\napt-get install some-package some-other-package\n\nYou may have to repeat this more than once until all of the packages have been installed and none are held back.\nThen, you should repeat the update and upgrade in order to completely verify that the system is as updated as it can be:\n\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\n\nThese last commands should execute quickly, as everything is probably complete – however, it is not impossible that the upgrades would have affected something that requires another upgrade. Not doing this probably won’t matter, but why not do it anyway?\nOnce done, a reboot is required to make sure that the old software is no longer being used and all that is used is the new upgraded software. Don’t just continue the boot: reboot.\nOne more thing can be done to clean up afterwards – possibly after the reboot.

I have installed Gnome 3 on Ubuntu today following this guide. All worked well and I have installed the extensions mentioned without problem.\nHowever, after logging out and in, all extensions were gone. Going to the Gnome extensions website, I saw that all my extensions were outdated and that I could install only one other extension.\nI'm rather new to Ubuntu and completely new to Gnome.

The ISP connects to it.\n\n\n*\n\n*The modem/router and your computer Ethernet port have capability of handling 100mbps. So when you connect to it. it shows as 100mbps connection. This is between your router and your computer ethernet port.\n\n*Similarly your router wireless transmitter (inside the roter) is capable of 150mbps. The asus tablet receiver has capability of 54mbps. So it connects at speed of 54mbps.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Why two wireless device has different speed? \nIts depends on hardware. There are different standard for wireless. You can read in detail over here. \n\n*Why I am getting 8 MBps (there's a big difference between small b and big B) speed as download speed\nThis is the real speed your ISP provides. From your computer to router its 100mbps. But after router is controlled by ISP.\nSo its upto your plan.  If download speed (as shown in download managers)is 8 MBps [means 8 mega bytes (not mega bits) per seconds] it can be said your internet plan's allotted network speed is 8*8 = 64 mbps. (this is mega bit, 8 bit = 1 byte)\nIf your network speed is 8 mbps, then in download managers it would show 8/8 = 1 MBPS\n\nA: Is the wifi-chip from Intel?

I'm having 12.04 live CD . \nI want to install ubuntu only with CLI mode . I don't want to do like installing GUI and then setting it to boot to terminal . \nthe purpose behind this question is I want to install many ubuntus  virtually for specific  purpose each one , in my PC and I have low size of space . \nthank you . \n\nA: Sorry, that's not possible if you only have the Ubuntu Desktop LiveCD; this is because the LiveCD does not contain the actual .deb packages but instead contains the compressed image of a full Ubuntu install, which is simply unpacked to your hard disk when you install it.\nTo install a CLI version, you will need the Server or Alternate CDs, or use the minimal \"net install\" CD.\n\nA: If your goal is to have many installs of Ubuntu that are quite similar, but you don't want to have many copies of the same file, then you might want to consider switching to a filesystem that supports copy-on-write and deduplication. BtrFS supports COW, which means you can have about as many copies of a root as you want to without requiring more space on your disk. However, it doesn't support deduplication yet, which probably means you'll start seeing major increases as you install updates. This usually won't be a problem if your machines are short-lived though, so if that's the case, I would consider doing that instead. \nAnother alternative is if you're using KVM. Then you might want to consider using the qcow2 disk image format instead. This will pretty much give you the same benefits that switching to BtrFS on the host system will do, except you'll do it on the virtual harddisk image instead. You'll create one virtual machine \"prototype\", then clone its harddisk without requiring more space. \nI'm fairly certain copy-on-write is something you'll want to spend some time looking into. \n", "Q: Will not shut down My Dell Inspiron 1720 Laptop with 12.04 with latest updates will not shut down when commanded off.\nAfter each upgrade it will probably turn off once, the next time it is commanded off, it will shut down to the numlock, power and bluetooth lights.

There are options to tar to concatenate archives or append files to an archive but you'd need to test to see if they work with an archive that is already compressed, since you don't have space to work with the full, uncompressed, input.\n", "Q: How to install Windows live essential mail How do I install Windows live essential mail on ubuntu? I want this because thunderbird and other clients fetch email every 5 mins, not instantly. \nThanks. \n\nA: Thunderbird, when using POP, checks mail as often as you tell it to.  That said, you don't want to be connecting to a POP server and checking email more often than about 5 minutes in most cases.  Each time requires the server to create a connection, check your login credentials, then check the mailbox for new mail.  This is not instant messaging, it is email. If you check too often, your email provider may complain.  It's like a little kid asking \"are we there yet?\" every few seconds.\nThunderbird can also use IMAP.  Depending on the provider, this has the ability for the server to push email to you rather than you checking for it.  I use gmail, and have Thunderbird set to check every 15 minutes.  But I get mail much more often than that.  I believe I get the mail as soon as it is available.\nMicrosoft mail does not have any abilities lacking in Thunderbird.  It is possible that if you use their email server and their email program, they can do whatever they want, but probably not.  Why would they?\n\nA: Use amsn for Ubuntu. It seems it informs instantly about new emails in Inbox.

How to make ubuntu compile & run programs that run fine on windows? \n\nA: This is really because your C code is broken, its not the fault of Ubuntu or anything else.\nHere's a few tips on how to fix it to work though, and how to compile it.\n\n\n*\n\n*system(\"pause\"); don't do it. Avoid system calls, as they hard-code a requirement of the end system (which doesn't exist on Linux)\n\n*gets(b[top].name); should be replaced by scanf(\"%s\", &b[top].name); which is a more reliable way of taking string input.\n\n*main() is invalid you should replace main() with int main() and replace system(\"pause\"); with a simple return 0; to make your C standards-compliant.\nHow to compile\nCompiling in Linux is much more simple than windows (for small programs like this).\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a command line.\n\n*cd ~/your/code/\n\n*Compile with this command: gcc -Wall --pedantic -o my_program my_program.c\n\n*\n\n*If this command fails, you need to run sudo apt-get install build-essential\nAnd lastly some important advice: Dev C++ died out in 2005 - On windows, switch to Visual C++ 2010 Express, on Linux use Eclipse or a text editor and the gcc command.\n\nHope this helps\n\nA: gcc describing fflush(stream), says:\n\nIf stream points to an output stream or an update stream in which the\n  most recent operation was not input, the fflush function causes any\n  unwritten data for that stream to be delivered to the host environment\n  to be written to the file; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.\n\nfflush is not defined for output streams. It is defined for output\nstreams and for bidirectional streams on which the last operation was\noutput. stdin is an input stream and fflush(stdin) has no meaning.\nSo when you input 23 and press enter. After that fflush doesn't do anything. And gets() function just took a \\n. Replace with it scanf.\nThere are lot improvement can be done in the code. Look through it.\n", "Q: Why does Disk Utility show 8 bad sectors on a 2-months old harddrive?

For the small number of bad sectors that occur on drives normally the controller in the drive will automatically remap those to free space held in reserve for exactly this purpose.\n", "Q: Not able to copy files to USB Recently I am encountering a problem while copying files to Pen drives. The copying as it reaches the end it stalls and continues for a long time. The problem occurs at the end of copying. Can anybody propose any solution for this. i am using Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: If it stalls there for a minute there's a good chance that nothing is wrong. I've seen a pause at that point at times myself. \nWhile nautilus thinks it is writing to the stick, some of the data is being written to kernel managed cache. It's also possible that some of the data that the kernel has written to the stick is still being processed by the firmware on the USB stick.\nWhen the file is closed at the very end of the copy the kernel makes sure virtually all of the data has been written. When you ask that the stick be ejected or unmounted the kernel synchronizes with the stick to make sure absolutely everything has been written. This is the reason for not just pulling out the stick without ejecting or unmounting it.\nIf the copy eventually start again you might try another stick to see if the problem is the media or if there is a bug in your system.\n\nA: I have the same problem with Kubuntu 12.04 64bit and had it with previous versions. There is a problem with a Progress bar when transferring files to a USB memory device: \nIt reports that its done after just some seconds, but the files are still being copied!

Im using ubuntu 10 and the  firefox 10.0.\nWhen using the address bar to search, when i type long words like 'search this in google' the search defaults to google. But when i type in small words like 'search' the browser uses centurylink. Please let me know how to get rid of this and make google as default search engine.\n\nA: I found the answer that works for me:  There is a spot on mine (mac OS) that says in faded letters \"why am I here\" or \"why do I see this\".

Good luck!\n\nA: From the Navigation Toolbar in search box select your favourite Search engine through this menu .\n\nOr select the manage search Engines.. option to remove the Desired Search engine as from the image. \n\n\nA: It is most likely that this is being done by centurylink (your isp) in response to failed DNS queries. \nWithout changing browsers you will be unable to fix this problem.

However when I cd into the repository and run ./configure I keep getting this error:\n[*****@****** bagder-curl-f0d611d]$ ./configure\n-bash: ./configure: No such file or directory\n\nI did some googling. I'm at work and I'm not a system administrator, does that have anything to do with it?

Cmake is easiest:\ncmake .\n\nto create the build files, then\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nlike you're used to.\nFor reference, here's how to use autotools. It is unusual for a git checkout to contain the configure script.

I found this info in the official Ubuntu documentation. I know you already know how to get going with boot repair, but I will include it in case you forgot, or someone else is having the same issue. \nYou can either download the boot repair ISO, burn it to a CD and boot from that, or you can use a regular Ubuntu Live CD. When using a regular Ubuntu Live CD you will need to: \n\n  \n*\n  \n*boot your computer on a Ubuntu live-CD or live-USB.\n  \n*choose \"Try Ubuntu\"\n  \n*connect internet\n  \n*open a new Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), then type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get\n  update\n  - Press Enter.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Then type:\n  \n  \n  sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n  - Press Enter\n\nThe information on getting boot repair also came from the Ubuntu documentation.\nNow, fire up boot repair, click the Advanced options -> GRUB options tab, and check the ATA disk support (solves the [out-of-disk] error) option, then Apply. Reboot, and hopefully that will take care of the issue.\n\nIf still not good, create a separate /boot partition at the start of the disk: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootPartition\n\nA: When one gets the Out of disk error, there are two solutions to try (in this order):\n\n\n*\n\n*First try the ATA disk support option of Boot-Repair as described by reverendj1, then reboot. This is very easy, but it does not always solve the problem.\n\n*Then, if still not good, create a little separate /boot partition at the start of the disk.

What does ./configure do? Why make then make install? How does it know where libs are? ( they are all there and loaded but it cant find them.) Why need libs if compiler is supposed to compile?\n\nA: ./configure\n\ntells you whether are quite ready to build the application. It will check if you have everything needed to build the application, and, if it sees any critical errors it will inform you.\nmake\n\nbuilds (compiles) the source code. Compiler compiles the code, but, most of the times, the code cannot stand alone, it requires external libraries (usually provided by ubuntu packages) to be installed. After this step the executable(s) of this specific application you are trying to install will be created.\nsudo make install\n\nmoves all the needed for the application files to the appropriate system directories. This has to be done after make because the executables of the application have been created and can be moved to the appropriate system directory (e.g. /usr/bin/) for later use.\nLibraries are necessary, because they allow a programmer to use code made by other people to achieve certain things. i.e. if I wanted to do some disk formatting in my program, I could use the libs someone already wrote to do the formatting, and I just have to make my program call those libraries. If that person finds an issue in their library, they can fix it, and it will fix it in my program too.

Can you tell me how I should mount the image?\n\nA: If you already have a cdrom, you should not mount another image as \"cdrom\". You have 2 possibilites: \n\n\n*\n\n*unmount your /cdrom (with sudo umount /cdrom). I would not recommend it. If you want to restore your old cdrom, you have to remember the path in /dev.\n\n*make a new directory (preferrably in /media, but this is not necessary): sudo mkdir -p /media/anyNameEvenCdrom and after this sudo mount -o loop matlab2011a_64.iso /media/anyNameEvenCdrom\n", "Q: How can I use RAM storage for the /tmp directory and how to set a maximum amount of RAM usage for it? After seeing the comment by Anonymous on the question How is the /tmp directory cleaned up?, I found that it would be a great idea to implement on my system, since I have 16GB of RAM and I never used all of it.\n\nMy temporary files never get written to the disk. They get written to a RAM disk. I did put tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0 in /etc/fstab.\n\nMy question is:\nCan I set a maximum value for RAM Usage for /tmp? And in that case, what would happen if the maximum amount got exceeded, would it write into the hard-disk drive?\nI have read a solution which states:\n\nmkdir -p /tmp/ram\nsudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=512M tmpfs /tmp/ram/\n\n\nBut in my understanding, this won't be a permanent solution. If I need it to be permanent, it has to be added to the /etc/fstab configuration file.\nIf this is the correct solution, how can I transform that mount command into a line in /etc/fstab?\n\nA: On systems using systemd, you have the option of using a systemd unit file instead of fstab to accomplish the goal of using tmpfs to mount tmp. On my Ubuntu 16.04 system, I ran:\nsudo cp /usr/share/systemd/tmp.mount /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount\nsudo systemctl enable tmp.mount\nsudo systemctl start tmp.mount\n\nThe file /usr/share/systemd/tmp.mount looks like:\n#  This file is part of systemd.\n#\n#  systemd is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\n#  under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n#  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or\n#  (at your option) any later version.\n[Unit]\nDescription=Temporary Directory\nDocumentation=man:hier(7)\nDocumentation=http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/APIFileSystems\nConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=!/tmp\nDefaultDependencies=no\nConflicts=umount.target\nBefore=local-fs.target umount.target\nAfter=swap.target\n\n[Mount]\nWhat=tmpfs\nWhere=/tmp\nType=tmpfs\nOptions=mode=1777,strictatime\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=local-fs.target\n\nUsing FuzzyQ's fstab approach, systemd translates your fstab entries into mount units dynamically. I don't think either approach is better.\nIn order to set the maximum limit for the RAM as asked, one would need to add size=512M to the Options line, separated by a comma.\n\nA: You are absolutely right. The according fstab entry would look like this:\ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,noexec,mode=1777,size=512M 0 0\n\nPlease note:\nAs tmpfs gets filled up, it will behave as any physical hard drive by giving an \"not enough space\" error. While rebooting (and thus emptying the cache) will fix this, you may run into trouble when a single operation consumes more space to begin with than there's space on tmpfs. In this case your computer will start to swap from ram to disk, which will make your system crawl to a halt, given you've got a swap partition to begin with, of course.\nConsidering this, a size of 512MB might be far too less nowadays, since much more ram is in existence in modern machines and it has become much cheaper. Since you've already got 16GB of ram, using the default value of half your ram for tmpfs should more than suffice for almost all scenarios. To use the default value, simply leave out the size=512M entry in your /etc/fstab file.\nAnother note:\nYou can quite as easily mount other system folders into ramdisk as well, such as\n/var/cache\n/var/games\n/var/log/apt (use only defaults,noatime without mode= or nosuid)\nBut beware: the same rules apply as above, running out of space might cause major trouble. E.g. imagine running out of space for /var/log/apt will render you unable to install any programs!\nFurthermore, loading /var/log folders into ramdisk will delete all your log files upon reboot, so you won't be able to debug your system if anything unexpected happens.\nSo use these settings at your own risk!\nEditorial note:\nI removed the /run in tmpfs mount option since this folder and its subfolders are already mounted in tmpfs by default.\n", "Q: How do I work around this installation error?

IF you want to keep your files, run an upgrade OR install it along side your current install.\n", "Q: Problem with dual-view I've just installed 12.04 LTS on my old IBM ThinkPad R51 and I connected Samsung Syncmaster 21.5\" monitor via VGA port. \nI've tried to do dual-view, but when I try to set a resolution on a monitor, which is bigger then laptop's resolution, I got an error: \nThe selected configuration for displays could not be applied.  \nRequested position/size for CRTC 63 is outside the allowed limit:\nposition=(1024, 0), size=(1920, 1080), maximum=(2048, 2048).\n\nWhen I try to launch nvidia-settings, it says: \nYou do not appear to be using the nvidia x server.\n\nI've tried to install newest Nvidia drivers etc. but that didn't help. \nWhat should I do, to use 1920x1080 resolution?\n\nA: Have you tried setting up the displays as 2 separate x-screens you can run sudo nvidia-settings in terminal, choose the second option down on the left, I would think that might be useful for you.\nAlso if the laptop is old it may not support or have the power to display at 1920x1080, especial if it uses Intel gma graphics.\n", "Q: What does the tilde at the end of a file name stand for? In Windows, I believe that files with a tilde in the file name represent files that are currently open in an application. For example, Microsoft Word creates a file with almost the same name as the file you currently have open, but with a tilde in the name. It's icon is also partially faded. As far as I'm aware, this signifies a temporary file that exists\n\n\n*\n\n*in case the application crashes and you didn't get a chance to save your file, or\n\n*to allow the original file to remain unlocked by the file system and accessible to other applications.\n\n\nIn Linux, I ran into a *.log file with a tilde at the end of the file name (scan.log~). Does that mean the log file is currently open in another application that is potentially writing to it?\n\nA: If a file is appended with a tilde~, it only means that it is a backup created by a text editor or similar program; it does not suggest another program is writing to that file. Besides, any file opened in vi cannot be opened in another application, but that is another discussion. \nTo easily find all these type of files, type cd to get to the top level of your home folder and enter:\nfind -type f -iname '*~'\n\nOr, if you want to find them in a specific directory, type:\nfind /home/mike/Downloads -type f -iname '*~'\n\nThese files can be very useful if you happened to have edited a file and have not saved a backup of the original! Gedit, for example, creates such a backup of any file edited, although you can turn off this setting in the preferences. However, the  (files~) are no substitute for a proper backup, as they might not contain the data you need, or be the version of the edit you wanted.\n\nA: Some text editors (such as emacs) create a backup of the file you are editing, and give the backup file the name of the original file plus a tilde.  The file you describe might be the result of opening scan.log with such a text editor and making some change.\nYou can use fuser (see Ubuntu package psmisc) to see if a process currently has that file open: fuser scan.log~\n", "Q: Can't boot --> PXE-M0F: Exiting Intel PXE ROM Question:\nI recently installed Xen (paravirtualization) on my Ubuntu 12.04 machine.\nUbuntu 12.04 worked excellently before, but afterwards, the trouble started.\nThe laptop crashed every time I closed down the screen.\nUnsurprisingly, that resulted in file-system corruption.\nThough the real trouble did not start until fsck complained about corruption and \"repaired\" it (I tried to abort it right away, but to no avail, Ubuntu wouldn't let me continue until I ran that damn more-trouble-than-worth program...).\nThe system run fine after a second restart (on the first restart, after some time, the file system switched to read-only for whatever reason...)\nI afterward installed dist-upgrade (250 MB), to try to mitigate any trouble caused by corruption.\nI restarted, it still worked fine.\nI compiled bind9, latest version, compiling takes 15+ minutes, so I went to eat, meanwhile the laptop went into standby...\nWhen I came back and tried to wake it, the screen remained black.

It doesn't run inside Windows, but instead of Windows.\nYou can install Ubuntu alongside Windows. Download the CD image, burn it to a CD, and reboot. When prompted, select “Install Ubuntu” and then “alongside Windows”. After the installation, each time you start your computer, you will have a prompt asking you to select Ubuntu or Windows.\nThere is also an installer program you can run from inside Windows. This installs Ubuntu on a big file inside the existing Windows partition on your hard disk, but even so, you'll have to select Ubuntu or Windows when your computer starts.\nAlternatively, you can install Ubuntu in a virtual machine. VirtualBox is an easy one to install and set up. The advantage of running Ubuntu in a virtual machine is that it'll run in a window inside Windows, hence you can switch between Windows programs and Ubuntu programs. The downside is that running in a virtual machine hurts performance; Ubuntu will run slower, and you'll need about twice as much memory since both operating systems are running at once.\n\nA: It kinda sounds like you just want the Ubuntu command line. You can avoid the overhead of the graphical interface by just going with Ubuntu server. Installing that in a virtual machine won't take up a large amount of resources. Another option is to use Cygwin. It isn't Ubuntu, or Linux really, but it gives you a Unix-like shell under Windows.\n", "Q: Tmux key binding issue I've switched from using screen a while back to using tmux. I have a tmux config which uses screen's Ctrl+a sequence, instead of tmux's default Ctrl+b.\nHowever, one issue I've found is that if I press ctrl-a and then hit p for the previous screen, or n for the next screen, without releasing the ctrl key, tmux ignores the key sequence.

How can I avoid data loss when I use both laptops?  \nFor example changing Firefox history on both laptops without syncing? As far as I know, rsync etc. would discard changes of the older one, making syncing essential.\nI don't want to use the cloud for obvious reasons.\n\nA: I am assuming you are talking about data in userspace (essentially stuff that lives below /home/x3oo ). \nYou want to probably avoid syncing everything: There is little point in dragging cache files around. So as people have commented, you need to figure out what files you want to sync.\nIf it's just about firefox browser history, passwords, open tabs etc. you should look into the firefox sync. Since you indicat that you are uncomfortable with cloud storage you could also consider the more general File Synchronizer Unison. It will do most of what you need.\nUnison can be set up to run automatically, on certain directories, exclude certain files, keep some backup copies and do your laundry. If you find unison might work, come back with questions about it for your particular situation.\n", "Q: When I have an interrupted boot process, it shows a text-based Xubuntu splash screen. How can I change this? A while ago when booting up Ubuntu 12.04 I had accidentally turned off my computer.

I have been using Windows since Win 3.11 and have only been on Linux/Ubuntu for about three hours. I know things are done differently on Linux and I do not expect it to be as intuitive and user-friendly as Windows, so I am prepared for a few bumps on the road.\nThe first thing I do when moving to a new Windows version is to install a disk imaging software, because I always manage to screw something up when familiarizing myself with a new OS and then it is nice to be able to reinstall the system in a matter of minutes rather than hours. That is also the reason why I am always very particular about keeping OS and my documents and data separated on two different partitions.\nI have installed Ubuntu 64bit on a dedicated HDD with an 8GB SWAP partition, a 20GB / partition and the rest allocated to a partition I named /D-Drive for documents, data and disk images. After installation, I installed an application called Partition Image from the Software Center and then I hit a brick wall!\nThe problem is that I cannot access my D-Drive, because for some reason that belongs to root and I cannot run Partition Image, because for some reason it also belongs to root (I did not download it as root). In Windows 7, I would just right-click and 'Run as Administrator' or give my user account administrator privileges, but I have not been able to figure out how to do either in Ubuntu.\nHow do I get around this annoying root issue and take ownership of my PC? Can I give my user account root rights or can I take over the root account as my primary login?\nPlease remember that I do not know anything about Linux yet, so I need a step-by-step description.\n\nA: As you have found out things are a bit different in Linux and replicating Windows way may not be the best option. In Linux, all your documents are kept in the /home/username/. The way you have set it up /home is now a folder under the / (20GB) partition. While this partition may be adequate for the OS, it may be too small for all the data, music, photos, video etc.\nWhat you may want to do is set /home as a partition rather than a folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup /home folder and /D-Drive partition.\n\n*The easiest way to create a /home partition is at the time of installation. While reinstalling, (at \"Something Else\" stage) delete /D-Drive and create a new ext4 partion in its place and call it /home (note: it has to be all lower case). Then Ubuntu will know you want to keep your documents and data there.\n\n*If you later create other users for this computer and want to keep some files that can be accessed by other users, you may create /home/D-Drive as a folder in /home partition. Right click on the folder and choose Properties. In the Permissions tab allow others to create and delete.\n\n\nOf course the /home folder can be moved to a /home partition, without reinstalling but the process is a bit complex and I won't recommend it for a new user who may not have a lot of stuff in the home folder.\n\nA: You probably need to change /D-drive's ownership, and might need to change its permissions. Specifically what you'll need to do depends on exactly what you're trying to accomplish:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to use a partition mounted as /D-drive for one user (who is not root) to store data, just non-recursively take ownership of the mount point (do this while the drive is mounted).\nsudo chown $USER:$USER\n\n(If you're not logged in as the user who you want to give this ability, you must replace each instance of $USER with the username. Otherwise, that command can be run verbatim, as the $USER environment variable expands to the current user's username.)\nThe reason to run chown without the -R flag (i.e., nonrecursively) is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Presumably you haven't put any files in /D-drive, so you don't need to change the ownership on files inside it. Once the ownership is properly set, you'll be able to put files in it, files created there will have those default permissions, and files moved or copied there will (usually) have the permissions of the originals.\n\n*/D-drive will start out containing a folder called lost+found. This folder should remain where it is, nobody but root should be able to delete it, and nobody but root should be able to look inside it. This is used to store data recovered when fsck is run (which can happen either automatically or manually). Potentially any files (or parts of any files) could end up inside it. You might, at some point, want to create some files that some user cannot read. So lost+found should keep its default ownership and permissions.\n\n\n*If you want multiple users to be able to create, delete, and modify files inside /D-drive, including files written by other such users, then you should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a group.\n\n*Put users who you want to have this ability into the group.\n\n*Make this new group the group-owner of /D-drive.\n\n*Set permissions on /D-drive so that:\n\n*\n\n*Members of this new group have full control over it.\n\n*By default, any file created in it will be group-owned by this new group, rather than by its creator's primary group. (The setgid bit has this effect, when applied to directories.)\n\n\n\nSupposing you've decided to call this group team-d, here are the commands to do all this:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo groupadd team-d\n\n*sudo usermod -a -G team-d username (run this for each user you want in the group)\n\n*sudo chgrp team-d /D-drive\n\n*sudo chmod g+rws /D-drive\n\n\n*If you want multiple users to be able to put their files into /D-drive, and to be able to modify and delete them, but not to have that same ability with respect to each other's files, then you should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a group.\n\n*Put users who you want to be able to store files in /D-drive in the new group.\n\n*Make this new group the group-owner of D-drive.\n\n*Set permissions on D-drive so that:\n\n*\n\n*Members of the new group can access it, see what's inside, and create their own files there.\n\n*Members of the new group cannot rename or delete files created by other members of the group (that is, make it a sticky directory).\n\n\n\nCalling the group team-d as before, here are the commands to accomplish this:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo groupadd team-d\n\n*sudo usermod -a -G team-d username (run this for each user you want in the group)\n\n*sudo chgrp team-d /D-drive\n\n*sudo chmod +t /D-drive && sudo chmod g+rwx /D-drive\n\n\n*You probably do not want all users to be able to put files in /D-drive, since this would include user accounts that don't represent real people and exist only so that certain system services can be run with reduced abilities (for security reasons). If you look in the file /etc/passwd, you'll see users like mail, www-data, and backup.\nHowever, if you insist on allowing all users to access this directory (but not letting them rename or delete each other's files), you can do this by giving write permission to \"others\" (rather then owner or group-owner) and making it a sticky directory:\nsudo chmod o+rwxt /D-drive\n\n", "Q: Download issue with software center OK so i just got xfinity setup at my house and i seem to be having trouble downloading from the software center. all it comes up with is this:\nFailed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/samba/libwbclient0_3.5.11~dfsg-1ubuntu2.2_i386.deb 404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.166 80]\n\nFailed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/samba/smbclient_3.5.11~dfsg-1ubuntu2.2_i386.deb 404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.166 80]\n\ncan you help?\n\nA: Okay try this:\nOpen up the Ubuntu Software Center and click on Edit < Software Sources\nOnce that dialog opens click on the pull down menu that says \"Download From\" and select other, another dialog will open, click \"Select Best Server\" your computer will run several tests, and then select the best server based on those test.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I get apt to use a mirror close to me, or choose a faster mirror?\nThis usually fixes the problem for me.\n\n", "Q: Why isn't VLC the default video player? Why does Ubuntu come with Totem set as default? Is there a reason or am I just wrongly assuming everybody thinks Totem is actually inferior to VLC?\nNot to mention VLC is vastly known as perhaps the best video player for Windows, which would help with a smoother transition to Windows users making the switch.\n\nA: Because it's not just the playback capabilities that matter. You have to take the user interface and system integration into account as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*Totem is built around anchored technology that is well-maintained and shared by many other applications: GTK+, GStreamer. Therefore, maintenance is easier and less space is wasted on the installation medium (live cd/usb).\n\n*VLC does not follow the GNOME HIG, a range of conventions that address the UI of applications. Therefore it doesn't fit in with the other GNOME and Ubuntu software on your system. Just compare the menus, icons, button placement and terminology with, let's say, Gedit. While at first this seems like an out-of-place comparison, it is actually really accurate, since all GNOME applications share the same \"logic\", even when they serve completely different purposes.\n\n*VLC can pose licensing issues, since the codecs that come with it may or may not be legal in your country.\n\n*VLC offers too much functionality to be named just a player: it can handle DVB, broadcast in all kinds of formats, deal with screen recording, can convert files, and so on. It goes way beyond the simple qualifications a media player has to meet to be included by default, which in fact is not a good thing. Less is more when it comes to default applications. More can confuse the average user.\n\n\nA: Maybe to you Totem is inferior, maybe for other it isn't. \nThere's has to be some sort of choices in the applications that come by default on Ubuntu, and it's impossible to please everyone. \nThe good thing is, that you can make whatever video player you want to be the default on your Ubuntu.\nJust go to System Settings - Details - Default Applications and choose the one you want for Video\n\nA: Totem is built around gstreamer codec adapters.  This makes it a better candidate for gnome-ish-default.  \nVLC is built around direct interface with ffmpeg libraries (if you build mplayer from source it includes ffmpeg inside the svn checkout).  \nThese make both of those options less probable for defaults.  \nI find VLC to be a superior player, but the direct reliance on ffmpeg as opposed to gstreamer is a large barrier to making it a default.  \n\nA: Ubuntu standard edition is gnome based and they choose the best application for the look/feel, integration with the rest of the distribution, the applications developers commitment to the open source community. Gstreamer powers totem and it's the bedrock of codec support in Ubuntu/Gnome and is pretty much bad ass. Plus, VLC sorta sucks for the interface. It's much more a stand alone application, a drop in replacement for other media players, personal choice, for that it's excellent. It's very much a power user media player and as such goes over the heads of some people. The whole point of making a distribution such as Ubuntu is that all the chosen apps are easily usable by everyone. It's really extraordinarily simple, the decision to do so I mean, not totem, actually I mean totem too! ha\n", "Q: How to make Fluxbox stop making annoying sound effects?

I am working with QUICKLY, using Python and PyGtk. I know there is an option for packaging; so I can create a .DEB file. This is for Ubuntu.\nI was reading about PyGTK and it seems that PyGtk runs on MS Windows too. So, can I execute an app built with Quickly on MS Windows? If so, how? Which is the file (.py) that I have to execute on MS Windows? (a Quickly project has many .py files)\nThanks.\nAriel\n\nA: First of all, like I said Quickly on Ubuntu 12.04 uses PyGObject (GTK3) instead of PyGTK (GTK2). There is a MS Windows version of PyGObject too, but I think that QUICKLY uses Linux commands to create the final structure of Python files.

According to the wikipedia entry, a bootloader is a small program stored in ROM(a part of the main memory(RAM), isn't it??) which can only be read and not erased. I am a little puzzled here. Does this mean that every RAM we buy has a bootloader installed by default?\nAnd also, I read from a book which says that there is typically an area called the MBR (Master Boot Record) on the hard drive which includes a bootloader...\nSo where exactly is this bootloader located? Do different Operating Systems store their bootloader in different places?\n\nA: ROM is a separate chip from the RAM.  It does not require power to retain its contents, and originally could not be modified by any means, but came hard wired from the factory.  Later PROM, or Programmable Read Only Memory replaced true ROM.  These chips came blank from the factory, and could be written to once using a special procedure that essentially burned out bits of the chip causing their state to change.  This was then replaced with EPROM, or Eraseable Programmable Memory.  These chips had a little window on them and if you shined ultraviolet light into them, could be erased, allowing them to be programmed again.  These were then replaced with EEPROM, or Electrically Erasable Programmable Memory.  These chips have a special software procedure to erase them so they can be reprogrammed.  ROM generally is still used to refer to all of these types generically.\nThe motherboard has some type of ROM chip that holds the firmware, which in PC parlance is usually called the BIOS, or Basic Input Output System, though it is being replaced these days with EFI firmware.  This is the software that the CPU first starts executing at power on.  All firmware performs initialization of the hardware, typically provides some diagnostic output, and provides a way for the user to configure the hardware, then locates and loads the boot loader, which in turn locates and loads the OS.\nWith PC BIOS, it simply loads and executes the first sector off the disk it decides to boot from, which typically is the first hard disk detected.  By convention the first sector of a hard disk, called the Master Boot Record, contains a DOS partition table listing the locations of the partitions on the disk, and and leaves some space for the boot loader.  Ubuntu uses the GRUB boot loader, which places enough code in the MBR to load and execute /boot/grub/core.img.  Normally a copy of this file is placed in the sectors following the MBR, but before the first partition, and that is actually what the MBR loads, since finding the location of /boot/grub/core.img is too difficult to do properly in the very limited space available in the MBR.\nThe grub core image contains the base grub code, plus any modules needed to access /boot/grub so that it can load additional modules there, and the grub config file that describes what operating systems can be booted, and where they can be found.\nThe EFI firmware used on Intel Macs and becoming available as a replacement to BIOS on most recent PC motherboards requires a dedicated partition that holds boot loader files, and the firmware is smart enough to find those files and load one instead of just loading and executing whatever is in the first sector of the disk.\n\nA: The conflict between what you say about the bootloader being in ROM and it being in the MBR is perhaps due to bootloader being used for any code that works out how to do the minimum to load in code to make the computer do something useful, including each state in a multi-stage boot.\nSo, the starting state is to have a computer, which is a programmable device, but doesn't know how to load software to run because it doesn't have any software loaded. (And hence boot from pull itself up from its bootstraps).\nHistorically, there were a few different solutions to this problem, but these days we start with some code in ROM (mostly likely strictly EEPROM), which is enough to get it to look at different devices and try them in turn until it finds one that's bootable. \n(This is why many systems will boot off a CD or DVD if you put an OS installer disk in and from the hard-drive otherwise, the BIOS [the code on the ROM, including the code we're talking about and some other low-level stuff that get things started] is set to look at the CD/DVD drive first, then at a hard-drive if it doesn't find anything, tweakers often set it to ignore the CD/DVD drive unless manually requested so it doesn't waste time spinning up a non-bootable disk that was left in the drive).\nThis code in the ROM is sometimes called a bootloader.\nWhen it knows what drive to look at, it will then look at the MBR, which contains information about primary partions - how could you later look at / or /boot or C:/ (on a Windows system) if you didn't even know what part of the disk was which partition, never mind how each partition was mounted? - and some code with further instructions to execute. (Incidentally, this explains why some OSes - like Windows - can only be installed on a primary partition, the details of those partitions are in the MBR and that's the only partition information their bootloader has read, and it doesn't load the EBR to learn about the logical partitions, as far as it's concerned those partitions don't even exist yet).\nThat executable code, is also called a bootloader. When we care to distinguish between this and what comes next, it's called a primary boot loader (because unless we're making our own BIOS we ignore the ROM bit as out of our control).\nThat code will be very small as there's only around 400 bytes for it to fit in, so to do anything real, it will load some more code, that can be larger as it doesn't have to deal with this constraint.\nThis code, is also known as a bootloader. When we care to distinguish between this and what came before, it's called a secondary boot loader.\nThat code could perhaps be the final stage in the process. It would if you've only one OS, or if all the OSs on your system use compatible boot-loaders (e.g. two Linux installs that both use GRUB, so whichever GRUB was updated last can offer to boot into either of them) then it presents menus (if desired) loads in a kernel, and passes control over the the operating system.\nIn the case where you've an OS that isn't compatible with that bootloader, it may chainload. E.g. if you have Windows and Linux on the same machine, the GRUB option for loading Windows will in fact load yet another bootloader that only knows about the Windows installation(s), and pass over to it. While this was a tertiary stage in the process, it's still called a secondary boot loader, because it neither knows nor cares that there was another secondary boot loader running before it. This would also be the case with a Linux install that used a different type of secondary bootloader.\nMostly when we talk about the bootloader in terms of Linux, we generally don't mean the ROM code (it's not part of Linux, or changed by installing Linux). When we do update-grub we're changing the secondary bootloader, which is typically in /boot of a particular installation. When we do install-grub we're changing it and also the primary bootloader in the MBR so that it has enough code to know where /boot is (perhaps starting a software RAID as it goes) and will load and execute that when it, itself is executed.\nSo, in summary you were incorrect when you said ROM was part of main memory* because it's separate. (Indeed, RAM is taken as antonymous to ROM). You were correct both in saying there was a bootloader there and in the MBR, because they're two steps of the process and both are sometimes called by that name. And the answer to \"Do different OS store their bootloader in different places?\" is \"mostly\", because if you incompatible secondary bootloaders will either hide other bootloaders (if you install Windows after installing Linux) or chainload into the other one if requested (if you fix that situation, or install Linux after Windows), but an OS can share a secondary bootloader if they are compatible (if you install Linux after another Linux that uses the same type of secondary boot loader, and it can see the other Linux [sometimes software RAID confuses things and makes chainloading necessary).\n*In days where one would programatically make use of both ROM and RAM this was different. On a ZX Spectrum for example, the ROM would be 16kiB and include a BASIC interpreter, so as well as giving you the starting point for loading something into its 48kiB or 128KiB (paged) or RAM, (in which case, it's essentially booting into that BASIC interpreter and then using that to boot into what was on the tape), there was a whole bunch of functions from the BASIC interpreter that programs in RAM could use (why write a trig function when the computer already has one at a known position? especially when you've only 48kiB for all your own code to run in). This ROM was also visible in the same way as the RAM, just at different addresses. In such a case the ROM was as much a part of main memory as the RAM, but not writable. These days you pretty much ignore the ROM once you're past the first stage of booting.\n\nA: ROM is not in Main memory: \nROM isn't a part of Main memory. It is a separate chip, which is most of the time built-in in a bigger IC. More example, Your PC can consists of several ROM. Those are built in your mother board.\nGenerally :\n\n\n*\n\n*ROM are very small in memory size. These memory is non-volatile, in the sense, the program stored in ROM don't get erased with power shut down.\n\n*ROM are used to store permanent programs, which are very essential your hardware to perform correctly.\n\n*A typical example of ROM is BIOS chip. Where the program of very low level booting and initializing hardware are stored\n\n\nYou mentioned that, You read an article where author said, \"ROM is a part of Main memory\". This is confusing, because typically Main Memory refers to the memory of kinds which are volatile, such as RAM. But yes, If you use Main Memory term for the entire memory space of a PC, then ROM is a part of that memory space. You should note that, generally Main Memory exclude memory of kinds as ROM.\nWhere is Bootloader stored:\nModern system use two stage boot loading. In the first step a tiny program is loaded from a sector (called boot-sector more often) of Hard disk. This tiny program in turn load a program from some where in the disk, which is called bootloader. And finally bootloader loads the OS.\nIn term of Ubuntu system, the process is as following:\n\n\n*\n\n*After you turn on your PC, BIOS (which is stored in ROM) automatically runs and initializes various parts of PC hardware. Then it checks for a specific sector in the defined first Boot device (typically Hard disk). This sector is boot-sector, which is 512 bytes in size. \n\n*The program in the boot-sector is loaded in memory (1st stage). This tiny program has information which programs should it load into memory next and where that program is located in Disk or Boot device. It loads that program. In Ubuntu, it is /boot/grub/core.img.\n\n*In the 2nd stage, The OS-Loader, GRUB, loads Ubuntu by loading the kernel and initial ram disk into the memory and hands-over control to the kernel. Then the kernel runs and loads all of the necessary programs such as display manager, Gui's etc.\nSo, we can clearly say, that the bootloader is neither stored in ROM, nor in RAM, It is actually stored on Hard disk (or other Boot device, such as bootable CDROM, USB drives etc) , precisely speaking the first sector of the hard disk, which is of size 512 bytes and often referred to as the boot-sector. And this bootloader loads the OS-loader (in Ubuntu, it is grub) which also resides in the hard disk (i.e /boot/grub/ folder), and it's task is loading the OS (say, Ubuntu).\nAs a test, Remove the hard disk (and all other boot device) and try to boot. You can go up to the BIOS step, but after that step, you can't boot anything. Most probably the BIOS will say, \"No Boot device Found\" or \"No Operating System found\" or something similar.\nHope this answer will help.\n\nFor more information, you may want to visit these links:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory\n\nA: An x86-compatible processor always starts in so-called \"real\" mode, which is a 16-bit mode with 1 megabyte of addressable memory available. From that address space, 640K are available for programs, and addresses above that are mapped to different devices.\nFor example, addresses starting from 0xA000:0x0000 are mapped to the video RAM, so, writing data there would actually write data to the video adapter's memory displaying pixels on the screen.\nSimilarly, BIOS ROM starts from 0xF000:0000 so the CPU, when powered on, simply starts executing instructions one by one starting from that pre-defined address. The BIOS ROM  contains the initial program which starts by performing a \"power-on self test\", or POST. From Wikipedia:\n\nThe BIOS software is built into the PC, and is the first code run by a\n  PC when powered on ('boot firmware'). When the PC starts up, the first\n  job for the BIOS is the power-on self-test, which initializes and\n  identifies system devices such as the CPU, RAM, video display card,\n  keyboard and mouse, hard disk drive, optical disc drive and other\n  hardware. The BIOS then locates boot loader software held on a\n  peripheral device (designated as a 'boot device'), such as a hard disk\n  or a CD/DVD, and loads and executes that software, giving it control\n  of the PC.2 This process is known as booting, or booting up, which\n  is short for bootstrapping.\n\nThe BIOS firmware is responsible for reading the first sector from the disk into memory and passing the control to a small program which is, again, located at a specific address there. The MBR bootloader may then start loading the OS directly (as was the case with MS-DOS) or to load \"second stage\", which is not limited to the confines of a single disk sector.\nBootloaders which use the multi-stage approach can be quite complex with text or graphical interface which allows user to select from which disk or partition to load an operating system.\nSo if, as Uri suggests, you're interested whether the Windows bootloader and GRUB can co exist together, the answer is: the actual MBR can only contain a single first-stage bootloader (come on, the whole sector is just 512 bytes), but the second stage of a bootloader may be able to \"chain-load\" operating systems from different partitions. Windows bootloader is only able to recognize and load Windows, while GRUB is able to load Linux or pass control to another bootloader stored in a volume boot record of one of the partitions, which allows to boot Windows or other OS. The latter process is called chain-loading.\nWhen you install Ubuntu on a computer which has Windows on it, GRUB will be installed into MBR and you'll be able to boot both Ubuntu and Windows.\nHowever, if Windows is installed after Ubuntu, GRUB will be replaced with Windows bootloader and you'll need to re-install GRUB to be able to boot Ubuntu again.\n\nA: Make a minimal working example and run it on an emulator to understand those concepts:\nprintf '\\364%509s\\125\\252' > main.img\nqemu-system-x86_64 -hda main.img\n\nThis is a super simple \"bootloader\" that does a single hlt instruction. More info at: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32483545/895245\nYou can then run it on real hardware with:\nsudo dd if=main.img of=/dev/sdX\n\nand plugging the USB on your computer, and booting from it.\nWhen you do this, it becomes clear that the bootloader is something that lives on a permanent storage disk like USBs or hard disks.\nWhat lives on ROM is the code that starts up the bootloader for us, called firmware (or less precisely BIOS).\n\nA: In days of old, the boot program resided on punched paper tape similar to those used by telegraph machines or punched card media ('don't see both of them around anymore).  the process used to be called IPL, short for Initial Program Load.  Sometimes if a paper tape or card reader was not available one would need to enter the binary IPL code directly into the processor via a console on the front panel. whew!\nNowadays the IPL code reside in pROMs which when executed in turn load and execute any secondary boot loaders tailored to load (bootup) the desired operating system. the secondary loader could be on any medium on any part of the setup known to or addressable by the IPL code.\n\nA: The boot loader usually is in the first sector of the hard drive, usually called the Master Boot Record.\nCheers\n", "Q: Can't install python-distutils-extra from source in Ubuntu I'm new to Linux but I like it more than windows.

Is this false advertising?\n\nA: Update\nA driver for Intel's GMA3600 (aka CedarView) has been added to the Ubuntu repositories, and should be available through Additional Drivers.\nNote: the driver is only available for Ubuntu 12.04.1, 32bit. It doesn't work on 12.04.2 or 12.10.\nCedarView driver\nAdditional Drivers support\nWe don't have the driver, or, in other words, the driver is not freely available, but I can't speak for Asus, Intel, or PoweVR. Asus could have licensed the proprietary driver, or it could use the free gma500_gfx driver, which would be enough to take perfect screenshots.\nPerhaps you can contact Asus, and ask.\nPowerVR chips are actually quite good, the problem is closed binary drivers and the lack of readily available Linux support.\n\nA: There are open source drivers in more recent kernels, I am not sure of the exact kernel version, somewhere around 3.2-3.5 or so.\nYour video card should work with the open source drivers on Ubuntu 12.10 or 13.04.\nThe open source drivers are 2d only. They work \"well\" with KDE and XFCE, but gnome is slow as 3d effects are emulated via llvmpipe. llvmpipe uses your CPU and when I tried it in the past X uses 70% + CPU time.\nIf you want to try the cutting edge of X, I highly suggest Fedora. llvmpipe is back ported to Ubuntu, so Fedora has a more recent versions of kernel + llvmpipe.\nLast I looked at llvmpipe on Ubuntu is here: How to install LLVMpipe?\nThe closed source drivers are required for 3d effecta and are not working on linux.

Maybe this is related and helps you.\nIn my case, audio output breaks a few seconds after the audio output has stopped or I have changed something in the audio configuration. This is due to the PulseAudio module suspend-on-idle terminating the audio connection when it is not used for a few seconds.\nYou can easily try to find out whether this is your problem by (temporarily) disabling the suspend-on-idle module. To do so, put a hash (#) in front of the line load-module module-suspend-on-idle in /etc/pulse/default.pa and restart pulseaudio (by executing pulseaudio -k). If the problem has gone away, leave it as is and please add your findings to the bug tracker entry. Otherwise revert the changes to the file.\nIn general, a pulseaudio debug log is useful for debugging such problems. \n\nA: Are you using the proprietary AMD Catalyst driver or the default open-source driver for your RadeonHD?  I had the same problem with my laptop when using the Catalyst driver, but the last time I performed a clean install I stuck with the default driver instead, and since then and have had no issues with HDMI audio.\n\nA: Ok, so this has received quite a bit of traffic so I thought I would post the solution to my particular problem (it may not solve your problem).\nThe issue is to do with running a Radeon GPU using the closed source AMD catalyst drivers with a media device such as a TV which (unlike a monitor) does not retain a powered connection when it's turned off or in standby mode, this causes the device to dissapear from the connected list in Ubuntu and then for some unknown fails to re-connect without a reboot - If this is your issue you may be in luck.\nSimply, either use and older or newer version of the catalyst drivers. The issue I had seems confined to only 1 version of the catalyst driver (I don't recall which).\nTL;DR; If using Ubuntu AMD catalyst driver through HDMI with TV and losing sound, manually use a different version of the AMD catalyst driver.\n", "Q: How to set up a notification for \"New in repository\" packages?

If it hasn't got a (virtual) hard disk, it can't install Ubuntu because, as it reports, there's nowhere to put a root file system. Because it's effectively a separate PC, it can't see the host PC's disk so cannot see that. \nEither connect up a virtual disk and install it to the VM or find some way to copy the ISO to a USB drive or CD and use that the boot the real PC to install it in dual boot mode. \n\nA: Just experienced the same issue.You should try returning to the partitioning menu I.e 1 step backward&select the 'erase disk&install ubuntu option'.it worked for me\n\nA: you don't need to partition your hard drive...you can use the iso image and try it as you were using a cd, granted you've mounted as a virtual drive first. I'm not quite sure why 12.10 would try and make you partition your hd, but it's incredibly stupid.  You could install a previous version, but be careful where you either download the iso image b/c when you run it it could say that there's not an OS.  Or you can run 12.10 on vmware.  And as soon as go to create a virtual machine and load the iso it will easy install, so you shouldn't have that problem.  If you do, continue to research on either google or bing. Someone will tell you the answer you're looking for. I'm having the same situation, but if i find a way around it or get the answer i'll let you know @user1373670.\n", "Q: How to determine which WiFi technology is currently used in connection?

I have accidently installed Python packages to my system using pip instead of apt-get. I did this in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*using an older version of virtualenv, I forgot to append --no-site-packages when creating the virtualenv - after that when I called pip install, the Python packages where installed to the system rather than the virtualenv\n\n*in a correctly setup virtualenv, I typed sudo pip install somepackage - the sudo installed to the system rather than the virtualenv\n\n\nI happened to notice this because I typed pip freeze outside a virtualenv, and spotted some Python packages listed that shouldn't be there. So now my question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*how do I identify all Python packages that have been erroneously installed on the system (that is, Python packages that appear in the pip freeze list, but were not installed with apt-get)?\n\n*how do I remove them?\n\n\nA: AFAIK sudo pip install will install on /usr/local/lib/pythonVERSION/dist-packages. You need to run sudo pip uninstall to uninstall packages system wide. It seems that pip freeze looks for package metadata and will list anything installed i.e. both from pip as well as apt-get outside of virtualenvs. There is -l option inside virtual environment to list packages only applicable to that virtual environment but it seems to be default case as well inside virtual environment. I think you can just delete related packages on /usr/local/lib/pythonVERSION/dist-packages as well but not very convenient method I guess. \n\nA: Ubuntu Oneiric (and I expect newer versions too) install pip packages to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages, and apt packages to /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages. So just check the former directory and sudo pip uninstall every package you find there.\n\nA: To removing a package installed via pip, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\npip uninstall < package-name >\n\nTo search for packages\npip search <package you want to search for>\n\nTo determine which Python packages were installed by pip, by the freeze command, which will give you a list of installed packages and their versions.  I would suggest removing all instances, and re-installing using the sudo apt-get command\nsudo apt-get install python3\n\n\nA: Pip currently ignores uninstall commands that try to uninstall something owned by the OS. It doesn't error out, like it does with a missing package. So, now you can uninstall with the following process:\npip freeze > dump.txt\n\nEdit the dumped file to remove any -e \"editable install\" lines, everything after the == sign (%s;==.*;;g in vim), swap the new lines for spaces (%s;\\n; ;g in vim). Then you can uninstall all un-owned packages with\ncat dump.txt | xargs sudo pip uninstall -y\n\nI had to do this procedure twice, because a few packages were installed in ~/.local/lib too.\n\nA one-liner to accomplish this:\npip freeze | grep -vP '^(?:#|-e\\s)' | sed 's;==.*;;g' | xargs -r sudo pip uninstall -y\n\n\nA: I needed to clean up disk space from Python packages safely. While this is a complete clean out of packages, I needed to move Python versions  as well so I did not need old packages.  I used the following to get all my package names, skip the first 2 lines and grab the first column, and uninstall without user interaction:\npip list | awk 'NR>2 {print $1}' | xargs -I {} pip uninstall -y {}\n\n\nA: I used the following to uninstall all the pip packages from my virtual environment:\npip list | tail -n+3 | grep -ve '^#\\|^wheel\\|^pip\\|^setuptools ' | cut -d' ' -f1 | xargs pip uninstall -y\n\nI still keep wheel, pip and setuptools.\nAlso, pip list is preferable over pip freeze in my case since pip list lists the packages installed with -e with just their names.\n\nA: This has something to do with Homebrew. I had no issues with pyodbc on my Mac Air until I installed Homebrew and used it for a few things. I found this thread on github that ends in a solution that worked for me. \n\"If you have Homebrew, just install the ODBC headers:\n$ brew install unixodbc\n\nand run \"pip install pyodbc\" again.\"\nThis 100% solved the problem for me and only took a moment.

I'm posting this on AskUbuntu because \"easiest\" in my case includes giving preference to solutions depending only on software available in the default Ubuntu repositories. (to be more accurate, 12.04)\nI am currently developing an application that accesses web APIs and would like to test whether proxy support is working. Ideally, I would like to run a local server and simply tell my application to access the proxy in localhost.\nThe catch is that my application supports SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxies, and I would like to test all possible error cases. This means:\n\n\n*\n\n*sending a SOCKS5/HTTP request to a SOCKS4 server must not work\n\n*sending a SOCKS4/HTTP request to a SOCKS5 server must not work\n\n*sending a SOCKS5/SOCKS5 request to a HTTP server must not work\n\n\n(all cases both with and without authentication)\nSo I can't use ssh -D for SOCKS, for example, because it automagically accepts both SOCKS4 and SOCCKS5 connections.\n\nA: I suggest you try dante-server as your SOCKS proxy. It is extensively configurable and has a lot of features that should allow you to fine-tune your 4/5 test cases. \nNote that the version in the Debian/Ubuntu repos is somewhat old (1.1.x), and you may prefer a more current 1.3.x version which is available as a PPA. I'm on my phone otherwise I'd link you to the exact PPA. \n\nA: There is no easy way to exhaustively test proxy support.\nTo exhaustively test, you would need to configure proxy servers in the various combinations of servers and authentication settings, which are used in the real world, and test against all of them individually.\nNote that in many scenarios, there may be Linux workstations in an office, though the proxy and some other services (such as Exchange, Intranet site, etc…) may still run on Windows under IIS.\nIt can be costly, and tiring, to test against all of these servers. The easiest thing to test against, would be squid, running on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How do I disable joystick input? The file /dev/input/js0 related to joysticks is giving me some problems in games.\nI just renamed the file and everything went to normal.\nSo, how do I disable joystick input? I am using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: If your actual issue is that your Microsoft keyboard gets recognized as a joystick, you are not alone, it affects several people.\nMy solution for that is to download this file and save it as /etc/udev/rules.d/51-these-are-not-joysticks.rules. You can run this command on a terminal:\nsudo curl -o /etc/udev/rules.d/51-these-are-not-joysticks.rules \\ \n  https://gist.githubusercontent.com/denilsonsa/978f1d842cf5430f57f6/raw\n\nLink to my GitHub Gist containing the file: https://gist.github.com/denilsonsa/978f1d842cf5430f57f6\n\nA: You should see your joystick number first... so open a terminal and run xinput list and look to your joystick number and replace its number (instead of the 10) in the example below.\n#!/bin/bash\nid=xinput list | grep \"↳ DragonRise Inc. Generic USB Joystick id=10\" | cut -c58-59\nprops_mouse=xinput list-props 10 | grep \"Generate Mouse Events (\" | cut -c25-27\nprops_teclado=xinput list-props 10 | grep \"Generate Key Events (\" | cut -c23-25\nxinput set-prop 10 $props_mouse 0\nxinput set-prop 10 $props_teclado 0\n\nSave the above into a file like ~/disable_joystick.sh and then run chmod +x ~/disable_joystick.sh.\nYou can now run ~/disable_joystick.sh and it should block your device from generating mouse and keyboard events in X.\n", "Q: Can I split the upgrade downloads into multiple parts? I'm using internet through mobile phone, can I upgrade ubuntu the latest version by 2 or 3 parts? because connection is very slow.  my current version ubuntu 10.10.\nHow can I split the downloads into multiple parts?\n\nA: I think your best bet is to download the iso and use it as a live cd/usb drive.\nSee here: How to upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 without internet without internet connection?\n\nA: You'll need to incremental update from 10.10 to 11.10 first.  This, unfortunately, means you'll need multiple ISOs.  First, the 11.04 ISO.  Then, the 11.10 iso.  Then, the 12.04 ISO.

Which release of Ubuntu are you running? Can you possibly upgrade to a newer version? It would help you reach your goal...\nMany easycap bugs have been fixed in the newer kernels.\nBarring that, you may be able to find a newer kernel if you enable the backports and/or testing repositories if you haven't already done so.\nFinally, you could compile your own mainline kernel.\n", "Q: Enforce file permissions I have a directory where many users have write access and often the permissions on the directory changes. Is there a tool that lets me monitor the files for changes and enforce a specific file permission or any other way I can enforce this when users have write permission. \n\nA: I think that if set the permissions for the group, instead of the user, it should work.\nHave a look in the chmod man page\nYou can also set the group of the directory by using chgrp.\nYou can look in the Wiki for this command\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Why can't I compile this version of Postfix? I just installed postfix 2.7.11 in Ubuntu server from source code. I do not use the ubuntu own one because I need the old version.\nI found a very interesting problem. Before, in both CentOS 5 and 6, I can build the source code without any problem.

I found the reason. \nUbuntu have special .so location. The location is different from CentOS. \nBut in Postfix makedefs file, it do not include this specific location.

Only \"Default\" and \"Failsafe\" remained. Using \"Default\" resulted in a black screen with only the KDE-style mouse cursor visible, using \"Failsafe\" brought me back to the login screen.\nIn the meantime, I've installed unity (and gdm along with it).

Even when I quit (or kill) IDEA completely, it stays. Example of what it looks like:\n\nOnly way I've found to get rid of it is logging out completely and then back in (i.e. restart X / GNOME). But having to do that is very annoying, as it can take 10 minutes or whatever to save (and re-setup afterwards) everything I have open. \nIs there any other way to get rid of the buggy popup dialog, while remaining logged in?

To my understanding, rootkits on linux infect the kernel to get root privileges and there are many scanners (I use rkhunter) to scan for rootkits in the kernel, but I have yet to find a program that would remove rootkits.\nHow would I remove a rootkit in linux? Would I have to download the same kernel and replace the infected files? What is the best way to go about doing this?\n\nA: The intrinsic problem with a rootkit is that it worms it's way deep into your operating system ; if you infected with one, there is no safe way to eliminate it from within the rooted operating system, because if your kernel is compromised, you can't trust anything it says about your files, etc.\nThus to eliminate a rootkit, you have to shut down the OS and manipulate the file system from another OS, and in such a case, it's probably less costly to simply reinstall the operating system rather than try and audit the existing system and repair any rooted components.\nAs @Cumulus007 points out, the incidence of a rootkit on a desktop-usage Linux system is very low. The odds are a little worse for a server-usage installation, but still very low.\n\nA: I think the best and the safest approach to remove rootkits is to reinstall the system after backing up data. It is advisable to search for how the rootkit was installed.\n", "Q: How do I get a Canon Multipass MP390 working? Setting up a computer for a college student.

You need to have libapache2-mod-php5 installed for this, and you may need to enable it with sudo a2enmod php5. When you restart apache, you can look in /var/log/apache2/error.log and you should see something similar this:\n[Sun Aug 05 06:33:46 2012] [notice] Apache/2.2.16 PHP/5.3.3-7+squeeze13\n with Suhosin-Patch mod_ssl/2.2.16 OpenSSL/0.9.8o configured -- resuming normal operations\n\nThe PHP part tells you the module is ready to process php content.\n\nA: There are two main implementations of PHP: the Apache module (libapache2-mod-php5) and the terminal interpreter (php5-cli). The Apache module will cause Apache to check any files ending in .php for PHP script and run that script when a client requests that file. For this to happen, you need to install the package and request a PHP file through Apache.\nThe terminal interpreter is accessed by typing php into a terminal, and will allow you to type PHP directly (with a few modifications to handle linebreaks and execution).\nPHP doesn't run as a window or anything like that.

I would not like to disable the sudo prompt for all users but just for the newly created user (I had seen an answer regarding commenting a certain line in the sudoers file for preventing the sudo password prompt here at AU).\nSimilarly I would like to add svn privileges onto the www-data user.\nwww-data ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/useradd,/bin/svn\n\nCurrently the www-data user is able to create a new user using the useradd command, but is unable to use the svn command.

This may be obtained by use of which useradd. \nSimilarly you can also add search for the svn command using which svn and this will give you the location of the svn command. In my case, it gave me /usr/bin/svn and so when I edited the line \nwww-data ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/useradd,/bin/svn \ninto \nwww-data ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/useradd,/usr/bin/svn \nthe www-data user got svn privileges and I was able to do password-less sudo for the www-data user.\n", "Q: Installing/Cloning from Ubuntu Installed and Running on USB to HD I installed Ubuntu on to a USB and everything's running perfectly thus far.

I'd also like to have the same software as on my USB installed on the other systems. Any changes I have to make to individual system installations, I'll take care of later. \nWhat's the best/easiest way of copying/cloning/installing a live system from a USB to the hard drive on multiple machines?\n\nA: Clonezilla is useful for that task related to \"cloning\"  (tested by me). The \"Install\" Procedure should be better if you run it from the installation disk and start from scratch.\nWith Clonezilla, you can clone your USB's system into a hard disk drive, after which you will have a hard disk drive with the partitions as in your USB with extra unused disk space. (It would be cool if you provide us with the current partitioning sizes of your USB in order to give you a more comprehensive scenery). \nYou may wish to use all the hard disk drive capacity for the system. If so, you will simply need to start again from your USB, (the current one you use for booting or a live CD), then use gParted, erase your current swap file system in order to preserve your boot partition in one piece, and write a new swap at the very end of the partitions.\nThe procedure itself will delay a while depending on your hard disk drive capacity but it is easy indeed. \nThis procedure is how I cloned my 4GB USB system into a 8GB SD Card and some other cases with hard disk drive.\nIf you need further details please provide a screenshot of your current partitions in gparted, let us know how much memory does your computer have and the size of the hard disk drive where you wish to clone your system. \nCloning your system will preserve all your software, documents, configurations, etc.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu browsers trying to make me connect via a proxy that isn't available, how do I stop it wanting to connect to it?

My question is simple -- I want to know more about dpkg -- what does it do? \n\nA: As always, the man command is a great place to start.\nman dpkg can give you all options, nevertheless:\ndpkg is a package manager for Debian-based systems. It can install, remove, and build packages, but unlike other package management systems it can not automatically download and install packages and their dependencies. \nSo basically it's apt-get without dependency resolving, and it's used to install .deb files.\nI warn you though: Uninstalling packages using dpkg, in most cases, is NOT recommended. It is better to use a package manager that handles dependencies, to ensure that the system is in a consistent state. \nFor example using dpkg -r zip you can remove the zip package, but any packages that depend on it will still be installed and may no longer function correctly.\nYou can read some more about it in the server guide, and elsewhere.\n\nA: dpkg is a command line way to install from a .deb or remove already installed packages. For example if you had a .deb file in your home directory, running dpkg -i yourpackage.deb will install that package for you. I find this useful atleast for me because sometimes when clicking on a .deb file it loads the Ubuntu Software Center but never really installs it or has problems.\n\nA: As has been said, dpkg is a low-level system tool to extract, analyse, unpack and install or remove .deb files. However, it is better to use Software Centre or Gdebi to install or remove .deb files that have been gained from other sources because these two programs have dependency resolution.\nHowever, what has not been explained is the anatomy of an update using dpkg and apt-get. If, for example we call apt-get to install cheese, the dependency tree is analysed and the necessary files are fetched by apt-get, which then passes them to dpkg to extract, analyse and install to the correct locations and configure them according to the scripts inside them.\nThe scripts read by dpkg inside each .deb file are important as they give information to the program regarding the packages' installation, removal and configuration. Hence when you look in /var/log/dpkg.log there are a lot of verbose details about 'triggers' and packages going through varying stages of unpacking and configuration. In his blog, Raphael Hertzog (who is a key Debian developer and maintainer of the dpkg package) explains more about dpkg triggers and the way dpkg inspects and configures packages. \nWe are now getting to the heart of what dpkg does; it expertly handles Debian packages, rather than their dependencies. With dpkg-deb, for example, you can perform various actions in analysing and manually extracting files from the .deb archives; see man dpkg-deb for further information.\nThe status of each package is listed in /var/lib/dpkg/status, which can be used with grep to check on a particular package. Dpkg can also be called to reconfigure particular packages that have been configured (see man dpkg-reconfigure):  \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure <package>\n\nOr to do a configuring of all unconfigured packages if there has been a problem with an update and some packages' configuration is still pending:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nFor a great tutorial that focuses on dpkg and apt-get, see chapters 5 and 6 of the Debian Handbook, which is the best discussion available. Enter man dpkg in your terminal or view the Ubuntu manpages online to see all the many options available, such as using dpkg -l to list currently installed packages. \n", "Q: Replacing blank character is not working inside script In a shell script I tried to replace blank space by \\n with this command\necho -e $var |tr ' ' '\\n'\n\nOutside the script it workd perfectly but inside there is no effect .\nThis how i use in the script:\nvar =$(echo -e $var | tr ' ' '\\n' )\n\nThanks .\n\nA: After expanding a parameter expansion ($var) or command substitution ($(cmd)), the shell removes all whitespace from the expanded result in order to split them into words (word splitting). On top of that, it tries to match filenames for the words that contain *, ? and/or [...] (pathname expansion). So always enclose expansions in double quotes (\"$var\" and \"$(cmd)\") to avoid word splitting and pathname expansion to be attempted.\n$ var=$'two\\nlines   here'\n$ echo $var\ntwo lines here\n$ echo \"$var\"\ntwo\nlines   here\n$\n\nHence:\necho \"$var\" | tr ' ' '\\n'\n# or using bash's more powerful types of parameter expansions\necho \"${var// /$'\\n'}\"\n\nvar=\"$(echo \"$var\" | tr ' ' '\\n')\"\n\nSee also: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes\n\nA: From the Bash manual (man bash):\n\nCommand substitution allows the output of a command to replace the\n  command name.  There are two forms:\n$(command)\nor\n`command`\nBash performs the expansion by executing command and replacing the\n  command substitution with the standard output of  the  command, with\n  any trailing newlines deleted.\n\nThat's why the newline characters are lost.\n", "Q: AMD E1-1200 Slow?

Then boot up the Ubuntu LiveCD and install.\nThen once you've installed Ubuntu plug your Windows HDD back in. Your computer will now boot to whichever hard drive is set to boot first in your BIOS. Set it so that your Ubuntu drive boots first and boot your fresh Ubuntu install.\nOnce you're in Ubuntu, use sudo-update-grub in the terminal.

I think my Ubuntu is a bit broken from messing around with it.\nUnfortunately during installation, I did not make a separate partition for /home. Now I need to re-install but want to keep my music and films.\nAny ideas...\n\nA: Ubuntu has always supported this, but it's hard to kill the myth that you need a separate partition in order to preserve your data. Stick the CD in and just reinstall over it:\n\nThe Ubuntu installers for both the desktop CD and server/alternate CD have the ability to install over an existing system, preserving your home directory (and the local system driectories: /usr/local, /usr/src, and /var/local). This functionality also reuses the user ID and group ID of an existing user, if it has the same username as the user you're creating during installation.\nTo use this option when installing, choose the option for advanced partitioning, then select your existing / or /home partition. In the box that appears, make sure the filesystem selected matches the existing filesystem of that partition, and that the format box is not checked. Proceed as normal through the rest of the options.\n\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*What's your recommendation on drive partitioning schemes for a desktop and home server?\n\n*http://www.jorgecastro.org/2010/09/09/no-need-to-complicate-your-life\n", "Q: Built python 2.7.3 from source, now apt-get doesn't work \"ImportError: No module named apt_pkg\" I needed to get a bug fix which arrived in Python 2.7.3\nLatest version available for 11.10 was 2.7.2, so I built Python 2.7.3 from source\nNow when I try to apt-get [anything] I get this error at the end:\nSetting up unattended-upgrades (0.73ubuntu1) ...\nupdate-rc.d: warning: unattended-upgrades start runlevel arguments (2 3 4 5) do not match LSB Default-Start values (none)\nupdate-rc.d: warning: unattended-upgrades stop runlevel arguments (0 1 6) do not match LSB Default-Stop values (0 6)\nChecking for running unattended-upgrades: \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/share/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrade-shutdown\", line 27, in <module>\n    import apt_pkg\nImportError: No module named apt_pkg\ninvoke-rc.d: initscript unattended-upgrades, action \"start\" failed.\ndpkg: error processing unattended-upgrades (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n unattended-upgrades\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nSince this error is python related I assume I have broken some part of apt by installing a new python.\nAlthough I installed to /usr/local/bin and haven't touched the /usr/bin/python, which is still the 2.7.2 version that came with Ubuntu.\nVery grateful if someone can suggest a way out of the mess I'm now in, preferrably without reinstalling the OS.\n\nA: By default the PATH will be set /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin which would cause this issue.

After that, you can successfully run:\n./install\n\nAnd you should be OK :)\nPS: I myself remember, when I was not used to Linux as well, to be very confused by this Permission denied message while I was root.

I think the answer lies with using awk but I cannot for the life of me fathom out how to do it.\nHere is the output of the file command for reference:\nkemra102@kaon:~/Downloads$ file 2012-07-15-wheezy-raspbian.img\n2012-07-15-wheezy-raspbian.img: x86 boot sector; partition 1: ID=0xc, starthead 130, startsector 8192, 114688 sectors; partition 2: ID=0x83, starthead 165, startsector 122880, 3665920 sectors, code offset 0xb8\nkemra102@kaon:~/Downloads$ \n\n\nA: file 2012-07-15-wheezy-raspdian.img     | \\\n    grep -oP '(?<=startsector )[0-9]+'  | \\\n    sed -n '1p'\n\nIf you change 1 to any other number in sed -n '1p' it will give you the other occurrences.\n\nA: It's a bit easier with sed or perl than with awk. With sed: match the whole line, looking for partition 1 followed by startsector 1234 (or any other sequence of digits) with no ; in between. Replace that whole line by just the digit, and print the result. You can change partition 1 to partition 2, of course.\nsed -n 's/^.*partition 1:[^;]* startsector \\([0-9][0-9]*\\).*$/\\1/p'\n\nWith perl: look for a substring consisting of partition 1 followed by startsector 1234 with no ; in between; save the digits after startsector in a group.

I've done a couple of google searches, but I can't seem to come across an answer, at least not within the first two search pages.  I wanted to know whether the Ubuntu kernel is modular or monolithic?  I saw one article which said that most of todays distros are highly modular, but nothing specific enough to mention the specific ones.\nJust something of interest and wanted to know!\n\nA: Linux kernel is both a monolithic kernel and a modular kernel :) Those things are not mutually exclusive.\nMonolithic kernel refers to a kernel all parts of which share a common address space:\n\nThis reduces the amount of context switches and messaging involved,\n  making the concept faster than a Microkernel. On the downside, the\n  amount of code running in kernel space makes the kernel more prone to\n  fatal bugs.\n\nThe opposite of \"monolithic kernel\" is \"microkernel\", where the kernel is only responsible for coordinating services running in user space which do all the actual job.\n\"Modular kernel\" means that\n\nsome part of the system core will be located in independent files\n  called modules that can be added to the system at run time. Depending\n  on the content of those modules, the goal can vary such as: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*only loading drivers if a device is actually found   \n  \n*only load a filesystem if it gets actually requested   \n  \n*only load the code for a specific (scheduling/security/whatever) policy when it should be evaluated\n  \n\nThose modules are still running in the kernel space and not in user space, so the kernel architecture is still monolithic.\n\nA: Ubuntu is a GNU/linux distribution. That means, in particular, that it uses the linux kernel. \nThe linux kernel is considered a monolithic kernel.\nIt has modules, but they all share the same memory (i.e. : one can write in \"the others\" memory), whereas, in a modular kernel, different parts (such as drivers) run with separate memory (and, in certain cases, can even fail without compromising the kernel as a whole) \n", "Q: How do I fix Desktop that freezes straight after boot?

And it even happens when I cleanly eject the card.\nIs there a preferred way to do this so I can know that the files are copied?\n\nA: Make sure you're using \"safely remove device\" button before removing the card from the card reader - to speed up things, the OS buffers data in memory, so the copying process may finish early but the actual data may not be yet written to the card.\nTo do this, you need to click on the Eject icon next to your card's entry in the left pane of the file browser, and wait until the icon disappears, indicating that the card is unmounted. From my experience, this actually may take longer than the original copy operation took because the cards are quite slow.\n\nA: gcp: Command-line Based File Copy Tool for Ubuntu Linux with progress bar\nhttp://www.hecticgeek.com/2012/03/gcp-command-line-file-copy-ubuntu-linux/\nor try the \"bar\" or the \"pv\"commands with progress bar\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oneiric/man1/bar.1.html\ndoes the same error appear with nautilus?\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1963239\n", "Q: New internal hard drive and Ubuntu OS I have a very crappy Acer Aspire and I can to switch out the internal hard drive for a better one.

I just can't use it this way.\nI found a bunch of info on how to remove Ubuntu safely.  But that involved installing EasyBCD and when I installed it, it told me that it cannot find the BCD registry and that it would work only on Vista and Windows 7.  \nIn my understanding, uninstalling/removing Ubuntu safely involves 2 or 3 steps.\n1. Fix mbr \n2. delete the linux partition\n3. Expand the windows partition to use the unallocated disk space (got from deleting the linux partition).\nIn order to fix the mbr, I used the following commmand that I found here.\nsudo lilo -M /dev/sda mbr\n\nI created a bootable USB stick with 11.04 and booted the netbook with it and then did the above command.\nAfter that rebooted the PC, chose to boot Windows (from the Windows multiboot menu -  the GRUB menu was gone as a result of the above lilo command I assume).\nThen I did diskmgmt.msc and deleted the linux partition (sda3).  But I was not able to resize the windows partition (sda2) since Windows XP does not have that option.  I tried using gparted to do the resizing as mentioned here, but that somehow did not work.  That is - the sda2 showed up as 87.72 GB and it did not allow me to increase the size to include the 47.23 GB space that is unallocated as a result of deleting the linux partition.\nNow, when I boot, it still shows me 'Ubuntu' in the windows multiboot menu.  Is there a way I can get rid of it so that it only shows Windows?  \nI am going to install 11.04, but I would still be able to resize the unallocated space so that I could try another version as well which allows me to use USB HDD at a decent speed.\nThanks\n\nA: You do not need to remove an old install of Ubuntu before installing anther distro, you also don't need to re-install Windows bootloader and definitely you don't need to resize Windows partition to take up the space previously occupied by Ubuntu.\nJust boot from Kubuntu/Lubuntu LiveCD/USB, choose \"Other\" when it asks you whether you want to install instead of Windows or alongside Windows and manually choose the partition(s) previously used by the previous Ubuntu install. \nMake sure you're ticked \"Format partition\", which will re-format the partition, removing all the data from it.\n", "Q: Why does my unity music lens not play anything?

What does this advice mean and how can I do it? \n\nA: On an Inspiron 8600, the wireless chip is identified as BCM4309. Its id is 14e4:4324. To work, it needs a driver.

I readed some tutorials online and it was said that I can have only 4 primary partitions. My windows 7 system shows me 3 partitions already: OEM partition, Recovery partition and OS(C:) partition. Is it still possible to install ubuntu satisfactorily? \n\nA: Yes it is. Although you can only have 4 primary partitions you can have as many logical partitions as you want. Logical partitions are basically the same as primary you can install Ubuntu on those.\nJust create logical partitions for your Ubuntu.\nPrimary Partitions\nWhen Microsoft developed it's 'new' partition table type around the 1980s it restricted the number of partitions a hard-drive could have to only 4. These have become known as \"Primary Partitions\". It would be inaccurate to think of this as the main episodes on a Dvd because these could be shorter than the bonus features.\nExtended Partitions\nSome clever people managed to make one of these a new type of partition that could hold a large number of other sub-partitions. This new type of partition became known as an \"Extended Partition\" (it should have been \"Extending\" not \"Extended\" but nevermind). Perhaps think of this as the bonus features menu on a Dvd. When you select \"bonus features\" it doesn't play anything, it just gives you another menu.\nLogical Partitions\nThe sub-partitions became known as \"Logical Partitions\". When people quote the number of partitions on a drive they usually exclude the Extended Partition. Perhaps think of these as the the bonus features on a Dvd. However, the bonus features could be a lot longer than the movie or the episodes.\nAlso more relevant information can be found here and here\n", "Q: Wireless down in dual boot of Ubuntu, but works on Windows side My battery ran completely out yesterday while I was working on my lappy. I plugged it in to a power source but my internet connection will not take hold now. The wireless router is working, and shows up.

No dice. And, I deleted the connection from the Network Manager, and re-added it. Still no internet in Ubuntu. Someone had posted a note about the DPCH being stuck - to go into the terminal and restart the network services from there. But, they did not provide the correct command sequence. Any help?  Please?\n\nA: After resuming from hibernation I could not reconnect to the same SSID however I was able to connect to other SSID in the area.

I tried adding the same style class like this:\nentry.get_style_context().add_class(Gtk.STYLE_CLASS_PRIMARY_TOOLBAR)\n\nbut that class doesn't seem to be observed on a widget that isn't a GtkToolbar. So how can I cue the user's theme to apply the same styles behind a GtkEntry widget?\n(If it matters, I have the GtkEntry in the first cell of a GtkHBox container. But even when I apply a fixed gradient to that HBox the whole cell holding the GtkEntry seems to mask out the background of the HBox with a flat background colour.)\nThanks. \n\nA: It is called primary-toolbar style because it should be applied only to primary toolbar. \nIn Gtk, toolbars by default can hold only ToolButtons, but there is the ToolItem class, which does not have a visual represntation.\nThat is created because it can embed other widgets.\nToolItem has add method which you can use like :\nmy_tool_item.add(my_box)\nwhere my_box contains your entry\nThen you can add your tool item to toolbar\nmy_toolbar.insert(my_tool_item,index)\nYour toolbar of course has called :\nget_style_context().add_class(Gtk.STYLE_CLASS_PRIMARY_TOOLBAR)\nThe reason why you cannot use \"primary-toolbar\" with non Toolbar widgets is most probably because in .css files it is defined like :\nGtkToolbar.primary-toolbar \n\n{\n\n    /* style info*/\n\n}\n\n\nA: You did not say, why you can't use a toolbar, so I will suggest exactly that: \nreplace the HBox by a toolbar, give that toolbar the Gtk.STYLE_CLASS_PRIMARY_TOOLBAR style and you should be done...\n", "Q: Finding out what filesystem a casper-rw file is formated with? I have an old casper-rw file I'd like to loop mount but I can't determine what filesystem it was created with.  What I do know is that I used UNetbootin to create it.\nI tried to mount it with all the ones I could think of off the top of my head, ext4, ext3, ext2, ReiserFS, and vFAT...something tells me that it might be squashfs, but I don't know what argument to use to mount it with squash.\n\nA: Have you tried using file to determine the file type? It also recognizes lots of filesystems.\nfile casper-rw\n\n\nA: From the unetbootin source on Launchpad I believe it is formatted as a EXT2 file.  See approximately line 4126 in src/unetbootin/unetbootin.cpp in the source from the project git repository.\nI gather that on various setups this can either be a file or a separate file system.\nI think the way this is done is sort of standard. I'm a bit more familiar with sticks created by Startup Disk Creator. The main and first partition (maybe only partition) has MS formatting. Unless there is a separate partition labeled casper-rw there is a casper-rw file, which itself is a disk image of an EXT file system (for unetbootin EXT2, directions for other live boot sticks have examples of EXT3 and EXT4).\nYou shouldn't necessarily expect to see much on this file system. It only contains files in the live systems / file system that have been changed or created. There's some magic that uses a special file system that overlays the read-only root file system from the CD with the changes made to the file system embeded on the casper-rw file.\nOn one of my sticks made last year with Startup Disk Creator I was able to mount the DOS file system on the stick and enter the commands:\nsudo losetup /dev/loop0 casper-rw\nmkdir /tmp/a\nsudo mount /dev/loop0 /tmp/a\n\nand examine the contents of /tmp/a to see the files created or changed when running from the memory stick.    \n", "Q: How to make a USB stick swap disk? OK , I know this sounds a bit silly and solid state drives like a USB flash stick are probably the last thing on earth you want to use as a swap disk since they could go bad pretty quick from all the read/writes.\nRegardless of the bad idea aspect of this I would like to know how to make one of my old 4 gig USB sticks my designated swap disk so that when my computer running Ubuntu Precise starts up, it will use the USB stick as swap.\nCouple of twists to add to the challenge:\n\n\n*\n\n*the computer I'm using is my wife's laptop core2 duo  and has 4gigs of ram\n\n*she likes Ubuntu but doesn't trust me to backup her hd so I have her running Ubuntu 12.04 on a 16gb highspeed USB 2 flash memory stick with persistency. \n\n*the second USB stick will be my swap disk and when the live USB starts up I want it to do all the heavy swap writing etc on the second USB stick \nAnyone up to the challenge. Trivial maybe but please indulge me :D\n\nA: 1) Make sure your USB stick is connected. In a terminal type:\nsudo blkid\nIt will list all your connected drives. Search for your USB stick you want to use as swap and copy the UUID (everything inside these quotes UUID=\"XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\").\nThis represents the individual name of your device.\nAlso note the /dev/XXX point of your device.\n2) Now unmount your device by typing:\nsudo umount /dev/XXX (where XXX represents your device name)\n3) Format your USB stick as swap, e.g. by terminal\nsudo mkswap /dev/XXX (<-- be sure to use the correct device name here or you'll probably end up formatting the wrong drive!)\nor simply use GParted.\n4) Now you have to edit your /etc/fstab file, so type\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\nand enter the following\nUUID=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX none swap sw,pri=5 0 0\n(for all the Xs, use the UUID number you got by typing sudo blkid)\n5) Now type\nsudo swapon -a\nThat's it, this should already work.\n", "Q: Wireless network adapter manufacturers with best Linux compatibility record?

The best card hands down for the ubuntu desktop is the intel centrino cards. All other cards had connection stability issues and significantly slower speeds. I eventually realized that my laptop never had these issues which prompted me to determine the driver and hardware being used for it's wireless internet. I found that the laptop was using an intel centrino chip which used the iwlwifi driver. A quick google search for intel centrino cards for desktops and $25 later, I had a  fast and stable internet connection using the iwlwifi driver. By fast and stable I mean, no disconnections ever, and wireless speeds up to 54 mbps at a distance of three rooms horizontally and a floor below the wireless router.

Every time there's a kernel update, nvidia graphics drivers stops working because there's not a valid kernel module.\nWhat is the ubuntu way to 'recompile' the nvidia module for the new kernel?\nShouldn't it be done automatically? I am suffering a bug?\n\nA: If you have installed the NVIDIA driver as an ubuntu package, it should be updated automatically after each kernel upgrade.\nYou can install the packaged driver using the Additional Drivers tool in the dashboard, or installing the package nvidia-current.\nIf you have installed the nvidia driver directly from their website it is probably sensible to remove it before installing this package - I'm not certain how good it will be at detecting the conflict.\nIf you have installed the package from the ubuntu repositories, you can try reconfiguring it with dpkg-reconfigure but I suspect building the nvidia module is triggered by installing a new kernel, and I'm not sure how to trigger this otherwise. The traditional uninstall and re-install might well work (sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current; sudo apt-get install nvidia-current).\n\nA: For me dpkg-reconfigure rebuilds the Nvidia driver with the latest kernel. This then requires a reboot to take effect. My example below uses the older nvidia-304-updates. \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure nvidia-304-updates\n\nEDIT: I managed to automate this by writing a script zz-dkpg-reconfigure-nvidia that runs after kernel updates\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# Reconfigure nvidia driver\n\nDRIVER=nvidia-304-updates\n\ndpkg-reconfigure $DRIVER > /var/log/dpkg-reconfigure-nvidia.log 2>&1\n\nexit 0\n\nI installed the above script by running\nsudo install zz-dkpg-reconfigure-nvidia /etc/kernel/postinst.d\n\nWorks on my Ubuntu 14.04 kernel 3.13.0-29 to 3.13.0-36 update.\n\nA: When you have installed the NVIDIA binary driver, you probably haven't installed the dkms package. Dkms makes sure that every time you update kernel, modules which support it are recompiled:\nsudo apt-get install dkms\nYou would probably need to re-install the NVIDIA binary drivers afterwards, and allow to use DKMS during the setup as it needs to be registered with it.\n\nA: If you want to rebuild the kernel modules only, then you might just want to execute\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-current\n\nif you have nvidia-current installed, or if you have nvidia-331 installed then this should do the work:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-331\n\nno need to add a repo or install new software :-)\n\nA: Please note that neither installing a kernel upgrade nor drivers from officially unsupported repositories is recommended! Follow these instructions at your own risk and only if you know what you're doing!\nIf you installed an kernel that's ahead of current official Ubuntu repositories (e.g. kernel 3.4 or 3.5) you might not succeed with simply reinstalling nvidia drivers.\nThe only way I found so far to get nvidia-drivers to work again is by adding the following ppa to your repositories. In a terminal type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nAfter that, do a sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get install nvidia-current.\nThat should do the trick. If not, run an additional sudo apt-get upgrade.\n", "Q: Need help with Ubuntu installation I have a Toshiba Satellite-L655 laptop with Windows 7, and I want to install 12.04 LTS.\nThe problem is that I have a problem with Windows. The problem is that, when I turn on my laptop, it gives this options: \"start up repair (recommended) and \"Start Up Normally\".\nIf I choose Start Up Normally it goes to Start Up Repair anyway.\nWhen Start Up Repair runs, it says \"startup repair is checking your system for problems\".\nThis goes for like 7 minutes, then it says that it couldn't fix the problem, so I can't use Windows.\nI was wondering if I was able to install Ubuntu in somehow.\nIf possible, please tell me and help me.\n\nA: Just connect your USB stick in the pc, power on and press F12 for the advanced boot menu and choose USB.\nIf you have any files on the disk you need to keep, choose \"Try Ubuntu\" (be patient, it might be slow) and make a copy of your files somewhere else.\nThen reboot and choose \"install Ubuntu\", entire disk. It will erase the windows partition and reformat it.\nFollow instructions.\n\nA: You mentioned in your comments that you don't need to keep Windows. If I understand you correctly, you just want a fresh Ubuntu installation. \nYou're good to go. Ubuntu won't care if Windows is not working if you use the USB as installation medium.\nThere is plenty of documentation on this on the net. Good luck!\n\nA: If you want to keep the Windows system, you may install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a VM (virtual machine).\nIf you want to remove the Windows system and reinstall Ubuntu 12.4, you just need boot your laptop on ubuntu DVD, click Install Ubuntu, provide the information requested by the installer, and let the installer install the OS.\n", "Q: I uninstalled mono, how do I reinstall it? I uninstalled mono in 12.04 by:\n   sudo apt-get remove mono-*\n\nbut afterward the theme of Ubuntu changed to an ugly one. It seems that some of the themes depend on mono!!!\nMy question is how can I revert packages removed by that command? \n\nA: That's because mono-* will mark more than just the mono framework for removal. It also removes some fonts and themes of the standard installation. Use\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends ubuntu-desktop\n\nto reinstall the packages you removed accidentally. After that, you might need to reassign Ambiance as theme in the System Settings (under Appearance) and log off and on again.\n\nA: You removed MonoDevelop and it affected the theme? That's strange but you can install mono easily:\n\nsudo apt-get install mono-complete\n\n\nA: You likely removed the package ubuntu-mono.

So I read some Ubuntu news sites. In the past months I saw many different articles about the integration of web-sites to the unity-desktop.\nFrom what I understood there are at least two different efforts:\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu web-apps\n\n*fogger\n\n\nWhat would be the main differences, and are there more efforts that do the same? I am a bit unclear on what I should choose to install.\n\nA: I am currently taking Fogger for a test drive after looking at web Apps. Here are some differences (from my perspective)\nUsers  will only be able to get Web apps through a PPA as there are no plans (at present) to fully backport it to the LTS. Fogger is available now in the USC. However webs apps appears to have better integration with ubuntu.  I try to stay clear of PPAs (personal choice)\nThere are a limited number of sites supported by Unity Web Apps (out of the box), however these do include Facebook, Twitter, Pandora, Last.FM, GMail, and Yahoo! Mail) a notification bar will appear asking you for permission to integrate.  Fogger seems limitless in terms of what sites can be wrapped ( I have been using it on apps like Evernote and OL photo editors and it works perfectly, especially when level of deep integration are not needed and you just want your web application to behave like native desktops one.\nPreferences I suspect will be subjective I'm sure and I look forward to how both these tools mature.\n\nA: They are different in many ways.\nFogger is an application that creates separate webapps for your preferred website. It basically creates an app that loads a specific page. But by default it doesn't integrate with the native Ubuntu desktop. \nThis is where is webapps is more integrated into Ubuntu. When you choose to integrate a site, that site became a part of your Ubuntu desktop. \nFor example, if you create a facebook application in fogger, it will create an app. If you open that app it will load a window with a web browser that connects to facebook. Using user scripts you can get notification. For new message, new notification (facebook), it creates a pop up with something like 1 New messages \nBut if you integrate facebook, you can get the exact message in your desktop. Empathy activates automatically so that you can reply using it. (In fogger, you have to reply via the window, which is basically a webpage.)\nIf you integrate Libre.fm you can play music with rhythmbox. But if you create a fogger app, it will be played via browser.\nIf I am not clear to you, I suggest that you install both. You can spot the difference very easily.\n\nA: The two approaches are quite different under the hood.\nAfter using both for a few days I prefer Fogger (at least at this stage of development).\nUbuntu Web Apps\nUbuntu Web Apps uses your preferred browser (Firefox or Chromium) to view sites utilising a browser plugin to create a page-specific shortcut in the unity launcher and to access unity desktop features (notifications, messaging menu, sound menu, dash, etc.).\n\n*\n\n*One advantage of this approach is deep integration with the desktop.\n\n*One disadvantage (IMHO) is that web apps aren't given their own separate browser instance, but are just opened as a new page in Firefox or Chromium.\n\nThis means, e.g., that when cycling through open apps with Alt-Tab your web app simply appears as another browser window.\nIt also means that in some situations the web app seems to open as a new tab in the browser instead of creating a separate browser window.\nAll of the usual browser 'Chrome' (statusbar, URL bar, bookmarks bar) also appears in the app's browser window, meaning that you don't feel like you're using a desktop app--you're clearly using your browser.\nFinally, you can only \"integrate\" a web page if your browser gives you the option, i.e. if someone has set up an integration script already.\n\nFogger\nFogger creates its own new browser window, with a new application instance for each web app and uses two kinds of files to customize the web page's behaviour:\n\n*\n\n*user scripts\n\n\n*user styles\nThe user styles basically override the css of the page, customizing the page's appearance (see the Fogapp for Facebook).\nThe user scripts are javascript files that can customize the behaviour of the page in any number of ways. For these user scripts, Fogger exposes unity desktop features through a javascript API. One advantage of this approach is that pages feel more like desktop applications: they have their own separate icon in the Alt-Tab cycle, and the usual browser toolbars are absent. (I like the lack of clutter).\nA big advantage of Fogger is that you can turn any page into a Fogapp on the fly, in a matter of seconds. For those who like visual tweaking, it's also easier to use a custom icon for a Fogapp, and Fogapps respect your icon theme where it has an applicable icon (e.g., for gmail).\nIf there is a disadvantage to Fogger it may be that the javascript API doesn't (yet) provide access to as many features of the unity desktop.\n\nIn summary\nIn the \"I don't know which is better\" category, the two frameworks take very different approaches to your user data.\nUbuntu Web Apps try to centralize data. Not only does your web app use the same data profile as your default browser, it also centralizes account data at the OS level via Gnome's \"Online Accounts\" manager.\nFogger, on the other hand, isolates each app's data. This makes it easier to, e.g., keep your browser signed in to Google but use a Fogapp to surf YouTube without being signed in (to avoid Google's nasty data collection).\nIt also makes it easier to set up multiple web-apps for the same site, each of which uses a different user profile. This could be especially useful if multiple users employ the same computer and want separate apps for \"Mary's Gmail\" and \"Bob's Gmail\". It also makes it easy to clear the data for one web app while leaving your other data untouched.\nMy Preference\nSo at present, I think Fogger provides a more flexible and satisfying kind of integration, even though at present Unity's Web Apps offer deeper access to the unity desktop.\nThere's nothing stopping Fogger from expanding its API for user scripts, though, and I hope that happens. Actually, it would be great to see the two approaches be united (unity?), with the current differences becoming different options you could choose when creating an app. This is one instance where I'm not sure competition is necessary.\n", "Q: Install Regex plugin for Gedit I am using Ubuntu 12.04.I want to install Regex Search and Replace plugin for Gedit.So can some one please tell me where can I get it and install it.Any help and suggestions will be highly appreciable.\n\nA: Download Regular Expression Plugin  for Gedit 3.

It helps with awesome wm.\n\nA: Try installing gnome-icon-theme-full.\n\nA: I'm on Xubuntu 12.04 and using awesome WM. I can confirm that installing gnome-icon-theme-full partly solve the problem. I can also confirm it just install one single package without any excessive dependencies. But it has some side effects. It replaces some Xubuntu customised icons and makes them look weird. So I deleted it. After doing some search, I find another solution here works better. Just install lxappearance and choose a icon theme. You can also change your gtk theme using it. It's weird that xfce4-settings-manager doesn't work under awesome.\n\nA: I had a similar problem on XUbuntu 18.04 and I fixed it by opening the \"Appearance\" settings and going to the \"Icons\" tab. I selected \"elementary Xfce\" and the icons displayed correctly.\nNote: I left \"Adwaita\" selected in the \"Style\" tab, but in the \"Icons\" tab the icon for \"Adwaita\" has a \"broken icon/red ex\" in it, I think this is an indication that some icon files are missing from that theme (I didn't track down why).\n", "Q: Use swap partition for hibernation I just created a swap partition out of my useless USB drive (4GB).

For example: if your filesystem is on /dev/hdc1, run sudo e2label /dev/hdc1 my_external_hd. I think you may need to unmount the filesystem with sudo umount /media/a1f2e5f6-a9bc-dd2a-c2c9-1f48c39b39ee before this will work.\nTo find out what device your mounted filesystem is on, the command mount will give you a list.\n\nA: If you prefer not to use the command line, the Disk Utility (should be installed by default on 12.04) also has this option. Select the device and then select Edit Filesystem Label. When the device is next mounted it will appear under this name instead of the UUID. \n", "Q: Can't transfer photos from Kodak Easy Share C195 Camera I am unable to mount and transfer photos from my Kodak C195 Digital Camera to my Laptop running Ubuntu 12.04.\nIs there software that I need to download to get my  camera to mount to my OS? I have tried using Rapid Photo Downloader and the original software that came with Ubuntu but nothing will allow me to view all and transfer all photos from my camera to Ubuntu.\n\nA: Before you try all the suggestions below, there is a useful note in the FAQ on gphoto.org that may suggest a quick solution:\n\n3.3.2.  I have a Kodak EasyShare™ camera, and gphoto2 can't detect it. What shall I do ?\nJust press the button on the dock so that the USB device gets detected by the system and [then the] gphoto2 software can detect it. \n\n\nNote: This answer may also be useful for anyone who has a similar problem mounting their camera and is not just applicable to this particular camera model.\nDigital cameras are usually mounted automatically using libgphoto2 and are not mounted as usb storage devices; there is more information on the gphoto project here. There are several solutions to your problem:\n1) Try to get the camera mounted; connect it and switch it on. Even 'unsupported' models can actually be mounted. By entering lsusb you can find the device and bus addresses:\nBus 001 Device 009: ID 040a:0565 Kodak, Inc.\n\nand then manually mount it with gvfs-mount by specifying those usb bus and device addresses:\ngvfs-mount gphoto2://[usb:001,009]\n\nYou could also create a script and make it executable and then run that script to mount your camera:\nNOTE: I recommend to grep the vendor/product id string, as that is one of the unique identifiers; just grepping Kodak could identify other products or the wrong one. \nYou MUST replace the vendor/product string below with the correct one for your device, found with lsusb.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nval1=\"$(lsusb | grep -i \"040a:0565\" | awk '{print $2}')\"\nval2=\"$(lsusb | grep -i \"040a:0565\" | awk '{print $4}' | tr -d ':')\"\n\ngvfs-mount gphoto2://[usb:\"$val1\",\"$val2\"]\n\nexit 0\n\nNow, use your file browser and click to show hidden files and your camera should be accessible from your .gvfs folder in your home folder. You should also be able to import photos by using applications such as gthumb. \nSome cameras switch off after a while, so if this happens you will have to mount it again using the steps above.\nNote: For Ubuntu 12.10 (and beyond) this ~/.gvfs folder is now: /run/user/username/gvfs.\n2) The second option is simply to take the memory card out and put it in a card reader and then there will be no problems accessing it from your computer. I find this is often the best way if no other solutions work.\nAlso, the program you were using, Rapid Photo Downloader, does not detect digital cameras and is best used with a card-reader, as the developer notes on his site. So gthumb's (or Shotwell's) import facility is probably what you want to use; Shotwell's import facility even managed to import my pictures even when the camera was not mounted or available in the .gvfs folder because Shotwell always requires that a camera is unmounted anyway, unlike gthumb. So if you don't want to go through all the steps detailed in the first method everytime you connect your camera a workaround would be to use Shotwell to import your pictures (although you won't be able to browse them in your file browser or in the .gvfs folder). \n", "Q: Samba and NFS conflicts? I'm using NFS server for quite some time now, and never needed a samba share. But now I'll need to connect one Windows PC to a network, and I should use samba share on the same server.\nI'd like to install samba and set it up, but without touching the current NFS configurations for the rest of the LAN, is this possible, dangerous in any way? It's very important to me that the current NFS configuration stays untouched.\n\nA: I don't see that your SAMBA or NFS will interfere with each other in any way.\nDifferent protocols , different ports. And I've used both on the same server without issues.\nBut if your machine is in a production environment and are worried about installing things. You should have a copy of your production environment, a test study environment where you can try things out. and then move the features you have tested in to your production environment.\n\nA: Based on experience I can clearly say: NO, there is no interference. I did a parallell share of the same files for the same users in SMB and in NFS (simultaneously, same machines, same files, same users). Absolutely no interference.\n", "Q: Force tabs in chrome I'm running ubuntu 12.04.  Chrome remembers what tabs were pinned, and re-opens them, most of the time.  Sometimes, on my computer, if the browser dies, it forgets and I have to redo them.  I have found that I should be able to force it to always open specified pinned tabs, but am unsure how to do this in unity. I have tried modifying the first exec line in /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop, but when I do, it doesn't work and it removes chrome from my side bar, until I re-add it.\nI am trying to modify it like this:\nExec=/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --pinned-tab-count=3 http://www.gmail.com/ http://internal.server1/ https://internal.server2/\n\nDo I have my syntax wrong, or is that now how I should modify its default behavior, or both?\n\nA: Another, very different, approach to the basic problem might be to use the \"session buddy\" extension.

This will prevent Windows from booting and will not fix the Wubi install.\nUbuntu cannot be booted if Windows has not been shut down cleanly, you have to clear the Windows filesystem from Windows (there is no chkdsk equivalent for Linux yet). \nIf Wubi fails to start, \n\n\n*\n\n*boot into Windows\n\n*run chkdsk /r from Windows on the same drive where you installed\nUbuntu\n\n*shutdown cleanly and then try to boot into Ubuntu again.\nNote that sometimes files are moved by Windows into a hidden folder called C:\\found.000.\nYou need to have C:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk. If you do not see this file, look for found.000. You need to change the Windows Explorer settings to be able to see hidden folders first, then move the files from found.000 to their original location. Sometimes the entire \\ubuntu\\disks directory may be recovered to \\found.000 in a folder named dir0000.chk.\nThe data from Wubi installation cannot be recovered by booting Ubuntu from USB. This is because Wubi does not create separate partitions for Ubuntu, but keeps everything in a big file C:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk inside the Windows partition. If this file is damaged, or deleted, recovery depends on repairing or undeleting the damaged file using Windows tools.\nHope this helps.  \n", "Q: How to install Printer drivers I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once downloaded install it directly without uninstalling window 7 right?\n\n*where do I download drivers for the printers?\nThank you!\n\nA: You don't have to uninstall anything from windows to use a printer from Ubuntu.\nHow to install a printer in Ubuntu can depend upon the printer brand and model. Ubuntu comes with support for many (almost all?) printers without having to download anything or install anything else.\nHaving said that, some printer manufacturers may make available special driver for Ubuntu/Debian systems.\nAfter you have connected the printer to your system, or to your network, the place to start is to go to the Gear icon at the top right of your screen and choose \"Printers\". Then you can use the \"+\" button to add your printer.

I backed-up an image from a Pentium Core 2 Duo (2007 hardware) and restored it to a Pentium i5 machine (2012 hardware).  Mind you, the drivers were all similar (nVidia graphics, Asus Mobo, Intel CPU)... but many new drivers were installed/downloaded on first-boot. Nevertheless, it worked quite well, especially after I went into the device manager and deleted all of the old unused drivers.  You'd think it would be quite successful on a VM due to the simplified virtual (and universally generic) devices the VM uses.  But I wouldn't expect anything spectacular out of it (ie gaming).\n\nA: You could try the latest version (Acronis True Image 2013) with the \"Plus Pack\".

Reading AskUbuntu and on the forums, I am trying to find out what to do about a WebGL and Google MapsGL problem (described in a Google forum thread starting at post #5).\nSpecifically, Google's MapsGL works perfectly in Windows 7 (on this same machine with dual-boot), but on Ubuntu, the Photo Tour and 45 Degree Satellite View show grey blurry blobs (see screen-shot).\nAccording to post #10, I may have better luck with an updated driver. I seem to have Mesa 8.0.2 installed, and see from the Mesa website that 8.0.3 is available.\nI have added PPA ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates, but the only two items it provides for update are xdiagnose and xserver-xorg-video-intel.

Eg. Having 12GB partition with 4GB of free space, when im trying to clone it on the new 25GB partition it does clone it, but the data that previously was 12GB, now are 21GB with 4GB(the same amount of free space still as it was on the old partition). It happens everytime im cloning my home and root partitions (ext4). \nI was also trying to lower the size of the new partition, to the size of the old one, but then dd ends with error saying that there's not enough of space, which should be enough...\nAnyone? What's going on?\n\nA: I assume you are doing something like:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda98 of=/dev/sda99\n\nwhere /dev/sda98 has a size of 12GB and /dev/sda99 is 25GB in size.\nObviously these names are wrong, but you get the idea.\nWhat you have done is to move not just the data but the entire file system, including all of its metadata describing what's free and what's used, to the new partition. It has lot's of free space but that free space hasn't been incorporated into the file system on /dev/sda99 so its hidden at the end of the partition and completely unusable.\nThe solution is to resize the file system located in the partition:\nsudo resize2fs /dev/sda99\n\nit works on EXT2, EXT3, and EXT4 file systems.\nI'd encourage you to make a backup first, but I assume you still have the data in the original partition.\nThis will tell the file system to expand into all available space on the partition, incorporating the new space into the file systems's metadata so files can be stored in it.\nYou can't copy a bigger partition to a smaller partition with dd unless you tell it to only copy so much with the count parameter. dd does a bit for bit copy of everything in the source partition to the target partition, in this case it tries to copy all of the hidden/invisible space to the smaller partition along with the original contents. It has no idea or care about what it is copying--it needn't be a valid file system at all.\n", "Q: Error while trying to install ATI/AMD proprietary drivers (post-release update) I tried to install the proprietary driver which is available for my graphics card.

This will run it as root, and also not need sudo.\nsudo crontab -e\n\n\nA: I won't get into how much this is a bad idea; simply put, running sudoin crontab requires your password to be stored somewhere in plaintext. \nIt's a bad idea.\n\nThe following is the preferred method of running administrative tasks through cron. Since you don't really need to write sudo in the crontab, if you are modifying root's crontab.\nUse root's crontab\nRun the following command: \nsudo crontab -e\n\nThis opens up root's crontab. sudo is not necessary to run your command in this context, since it'll be invoked as root anyway.\nTherefore, you would simply append the following to root's crontab.\n@hourly rm somefile\n\n\nNow, if you absolutely want to be unsafe and take risks with your password, the following will run your command from your own crontab, and enter your password automatically when prompted by sudo.\nAgain, this is not recommended.\n\n\nIn your own crontab, write your command like so:\n@hourly echo \"password\" | sudo -S rm somefile\n\nThe obvious disadvantage here is that, should anyone ever access your crontab, your password will be readable in plaintext.\nYou shouldn't do this.\n\nA: Sometimes it is necessary for root to execute a command as a specific user of the system. For example, with borgbackup, it is common to have root check the warehouse using the borg user.\nif the task must be executed once a day, we will use the /etc/cron.daily folder, like that:\n# cat /etc/cron.daily/borgbackup_check\n\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo -u borg borg check /borgbackup >> /var/log/borgbackup.log\n\nwhere \"-u borg\" is used take the identity of the borg user, \"borg\" is the borg command and \"/borgbackup\" is the wharehouse.\n\nA: Nobody mentioned having an executable script with setuid bit?

So you've got to have either one installed. You could also use Oracles Java packages (e.g. using this method). Then you can remove all OpenJDK (and IcedTea) packages like this:\nsudo apt-get purge openjdk* icedtea*\n\nYou will keep the java-common package because Java is now provided by the sun-java* packages.

It seems like the \"turn off\" filtered this device in some ALSA configs but grep returned nothing under /etc.\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nI solved it by removing all the files in ~/.pulse except client.conf.\n\nA: I figured it out. In \"Audio Settings\", you can change the audio profile for your BT device. However, once you set it to \"Off\", which is what I did, BT audio device no longer shows up in \"Audio Settings.\"\nThe simple solution is rather simple: blueman. Install via PPA and right click on your audio device and change audio profile back to not off.\n\nA: I was facing the same problem, then after I solved this by uncommenting and change the line ControllerMode = dual to ControllerMode = bredr of main.conf file. You can open that file using sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/main.conf and then restart the bluetooth using sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart .\nyou can follow this\n", "Q: Is there any application on Ubuntu equivalent to fedora's 'Connect To'? On Fedora 14 I use to use an app called 'Connect To' (I think it was default app) to make SSH connections. It was GUI based SSH connection tool. \nNow I have migrated to Ubuntu (11.10 to be precise). I use terminal based OpenSSH. OpenSSH is pretty good but sometimes I wish it was GUI app. I have tried a few but none do the job like 'Connect To' on fedora.\nIs there any Connect To equvalent on Ubuntu ?\n\nA: Remmina would be a good solution. I believe it ships with 12.04, but I think you have to manually install it on 11.10.\nsudo apt-get install remmina\n\nOr, just install it from the Ubuntu Software Center:\n\nIt also works with VNC, RDP, NX and SFTP. \n", "Q: Is there a good text editor for VHDL(GHDL)? I would appreciate very much if someone could recommend me a good text editor for VHDL.\n\nA: The absolute easiest way to go would be gedit with plugins (specifically, the code snippet plugin)\nsudo apt-get install gedit gedit-plugins\ngedit has the benefit of working well with GHDL.\nEmacs (which should come pre-installed on your machine) has a very useful VHDL mode documented here.\nIf you want something more full-featured, Scriptum is very full-featured and comes with support for other languages such as Verilog, C/C++, and Xilinx UCF. Its download page is here. (You have to fill out a form, but it's free and doesn't require a license.)\n\nA: For the record, I've been working on a VHDL syntax checking plugin for Vim called vim-hdl and it supports GHDL. You can check it out on github\n\nA: Vim includes a syntax file for VHDL by default. \nAlthough a little tough to understand at first once you get used to it there are few editors faster or more useful than VIM.\nYou can install it by running sudo apt-get install vim-nox or if you want it with the small gtk shell sudo apt-get install vim-gtk.\nBe sure to run vimtutor if this is your first time using vim, it will help you get up to speed on how vim is used. Alternativly you could take a look at this  online vim tutorial.\n\nA: You're opening pandora's box here! Most editors will support syntax coloring for a wide range of languages, including VHDL. So your question could be re-interpreted as a question for just a nice editor.\nSpecifically for VHDL however, Emacs, VI, Notepad++ and UltraEdit are very popular as editors. See this poll and this poll. There's not Notepad++ for Linux, though (afaik). \n\nA: My personal choice is Sublime Text. You will have to add a package for Verilog and VHDL but it is very easy and Sublime Text includes modern features such as multicursor.\n", "Q: Installing tomcat 7 on Ubuntu Server 12.04 I'm trying to install tomcat 7 on Ubuntu Server 12.04 with:\nsudo apt-get install tomcat7\n\nwhich most sites and guides tell to do, but immediately I receive this answer:\nReading package lists...

I need to take make a script that takes a particular log file in /var/log/ and puts it somewhere where I can easily get it (most likely a web or FTP server I have access to). I don't think I want to use mail to send it. Webdav might be an option. It just needs to work without any user interaction, and be pretty fast and painless. Any suggestions? (no password needed, basically)\n\nA: *\n\n*Log files in /var/log are usually world-readable and require no password to access.\n\n*If you already have an FTP server -- could be a back-end to a web-server too -- the simplest option IMO is to use the wput utility.\n\n*\n\n*Install it with sudo apt-get install wput if necessary.\n\n*The syntax is:\nwput [options] [file]... [url]...\n\n*where the URL is of the form:\nftp://[username[:password]@]hostname[:port][/[path/][file]]\n\n\n*Example:\n\nwput /var/log/syslog ftp://jack:salty@ftp.website.com/www/mylogs/ \n\n\n*Use the -u option to force an upload when the destination file already exists.\n\n*See wput --help or man wput for many more options.\n\n\n\nNote: Putting the password in plaintext as in the examples above is extremely insecure in general; I strongly recommend creating a restricted FTP account on the server which only allows uploads to a special directory you create for downloading/viewing the logs.\n\n\nA: Another useful and secure command you can use would be the scp command which uses ssh to copy files to and fro. \nTo use this you can use seahorse to create an ssh key pair and copy the public part of the key to ~/.ssh/. You should not protect the password you use for this with a password since you don't want to login to use it. You should probably only use the password pair you use for this for this script. You use the scp -i identity option to select it.\nThe private key takes the place of a plaintext password.\nI assume you could place an invocation of the script in your crontab if desired.\nWith izx's helpful approach you need to be careful to protect where you place the script to protect the password \"salty\" for the remote computer from prying eyes. With this approach you'll have to take the same care to protect the private part of the key pair since it is not password protected.\n", "Q: Error accessing Gio.Gsettings on application made in quickly I am trying to develop an application using the quickly/pygtk stack.

(replace app-name-here with the actual name of your quickly app) I believe that this would be done automatically if I had packaged my app into a *deb and then installed it.

I use firefox & as command in terminal. This must dissociate firefox from terminal. Still when I close terminal, firefox exits. Any ideas, why this happens? How can I overcome this situation?\n\nA: You can exit the terminal by pressing Ctrl+D; this will break the parent-child chain, so that the terminal is no longer the parent.\nUsing the ampersand only places the process in the background; it doesn't disassociate the parent from the child, so when the parent process exits, so do its children.\n\nA: As has previously been stated, the additional & only puts the process in the background (i.e. you get a new prompt) and can type in a fresh command. \nKilling the parent process, by closing the terminal, sends a signal to all child processes to end.\nDepending on the shell you are using you can de-couple the processes by using nohup or disown. The later is probably what you want, as the former is required in invocation. You need to specify the job number proceeded by a %, most likely this will be 1. So type:\ndisown %1\n\nIf you have more than one backgrounded process, type:\njobs\n\nto get a list.\n", "Q: Trick 64-bit Ubuntu to allow 32-bit pci wireless card? I have an older 32-bit Belkin F5D6001 (aka ADMtek ADM8211 802.11b Wireless Network Card) that I got to work in 32-bit Ubuntu 12.04 via NDISWrapper (Windows Wireless Networking) by using the CD it originally came with and NDISWrapper (where it said hardware detected: Yes).  Tried the same procedures in 64-bit 12.04 & even though it sees & communicates with the card, it will not connect to Internet.  \nIt can see the networks around me but when I enter the 10-digit (xxxxxxxxxx) security key, it freezes the system.  Did hard reset by powering down & removing plug & power btn for several seconds & restarted but same thing occurs.  Spent countless hours researching on this & was wondering if there is a way to fool this 64-bit OS to accept the driver.  I have tried countless cmds (iwconfig, ip addr, ndiswrapper related, etc.--you name it, I've tried it) and even though it can detect it, it keeps freezing.  \nI read that there is a default wireless card driver built-in to Ubuntu that may conflict & must be removed in order to prevent the freezing but I'm still a relative novice to Linux & am unsure where this driver is located so I can remove it.  Even if I do find & remove it, I don't think it will solve it because this step was not required in the 32-bit OS which I stated above was successful.

Because of ubuntu's updates my disk is now on low space. i wish to add more.. maybe another 50g to make it 80g. Ive seen some tutorial about wubi resize1.5b. BUt i dont know why it says this:\nskadush@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ sudo bash wubi-resize_1.5b.sh 80\nwubi-resize_1.5b.sh: The new disk cannot exceed 32 GB unless the\nwubi-resize_1.5b.sh: --max-override option is used (not recommended).\n\nPlease help.. I realy want to extend may disk space on ubuntu.. thanks\n\nA: Instead of sudo bash wubi-resize_1.5b.sh 80 type sudo bash wubi-resize_1.5b.sh --max-override 80.\nMake sure the 50GB, next to your Ubuntu partition, are free.\n\nA: 32 Gig should be more then enough for a wubi install with a small home directory. If you need significantly more you should probably do a full install of ubuntu, not wubi. \nSince you said that the disk space is low because of updates you might want to try running sudo apt-get clean; sudo apt-get autoremove which will remove old files update files and programs that were automatically installed but are no longer needed. \n", "Q: Wifi not working on Acer Aspire One D270 (Broadcom BCM4313 wifi adapter) brand new baby linux user here, never used Ubuntu or any other linux OS before, so be gentle and use short words!\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my new Acer Aspire One D270-F61C/KF netbook (it's a Japanese computer which had Japanese windows preinstalled, and I decided to take the plunge and try Ubuntu because English Windows costs the earth and stars). Wifi isn't working; I enter my wireless password, it tries to connect for a while, then asks for my password again. And KEEPS ASKING, every few minutes. Wired connection works fine.\nWireless card is a Broadcom BCM4313; I have the \"additional drivers\" checked and installed (I tried unchecking and then reinstalling them in case that would help, no joy, and now my home wifi connection isn't showing up in the list of available connections, argh). I've done a lot of googling and I gather there's a lot of issues with Broadcom cards, but some of the answers are for earlier ubuntu builds and many of them are a bit confusing for a new user. I gather I need to try installing some new drivers other than the proprietary ones provided, but I'm having trouble figuring out how that's done.\nAnyone got some simple, step by step instructions for me? Please bear in mind, TOTAL N00B.\n(EDIT): OKAY, got it fixed finally; after suggestions on the Ubuntu forums and messing around with drivers, what finally worked was installing Wicd. Not... using Wicd, for some reason, just installing it fixed it.\n...I CHOOSE NOT TO QUESTION IT.\n\nA: I have acer laptop and using broadcom too, many story with it along ubuntu 12.04, imo there are something issue between the kernel and the proprietary drivers (I've tried with ubuntu 12.04.2 untill 12.04.5 with different experiences)\nThe easiest method is try to install the newest ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: This will solve the problem:\nsudo rfkill unblock wifi\n\n", "Q: Can't connect to the internet in Ubuntu 12.04 I am new to Ubuntu. I recently put together my own computer and I installed a wireless card in it, but I need to use a CD to install drivers so it is recognized. The problem is, Ubuntu doesn't seem to be able to run the CD. I appreciate any help I can get on this.\n\nA: Ubuntu is so powerful that it can detect any Wireless card. You don't need to install driver and you are new to linux, so you have to just propery configure it. The reason of you can't install drivers from cd is Ubuntu has .deb package managing system for installing softwares. So .exe (windows Installer ) can't run in ubuntu directly.\n", "Q: 12.04 Suspend not working proper Okay I may have a strange issue. I can suspend my session and the computer will suspend as normal i.e I can press my power button and the computer will come back to my session. However, when I leave the computer for an extended amount of time it will not come out of being suspended. The computer will cold boot. I've tried looking through similar questions and can not find this exact same issue. \n\nA: I suppose it depends on what you mean by \"an extended amount of time\".\nSuspending your computer puts it in a low-power mode, but not a no-power mode. The low-power is used to keep the contents of your RAM memory intact. \nOn my computer I can suspend for about a day and a half. The lights on my computer are different from when the computer is on or off.\nIf I need to put the computer to sleep for a day or more I can use hibernate instead. It writes the contents of RAM to your swap partition (assuming you have one) and then turns the computer off completely. It takes a long time to write everything to disk and to boot and recover from disk so it might not be worth the time and effort over saving everything and shutting down. I don't do it often.\nsudo pm-hibernate\nwill attempt to hibernate your computer.\nHibernation is harder for Linux to do on some computers so it no longer appears in the menus for 12.04, but if it works for you consistently it can be reenabled. See How to enable hibernation? for instructions.\n", "Q: reinstalling ubuntu and purchased software via USC anyone know what will happen if we freshly re-install ubuntu and our purchased software via USC. will it gone forever and need to purchase back or no need? \nThanks,\n\nA: To buy software you need to have an ubuntuOne account.

As your output shows, you upgraded most of the packages on your system that were not being held back.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The majority of it is from the .deb files that apt-get caches -- 514MB at least!\n\n*\n\n*You can recover the space by simply running sudo apt-get clean.\n\n\n*apt-get's estimate is often on the low side because of the way filesystems work; the lowest logical amount of disk space that can be occupied is a \"block\", usually 4 kB for ext4.\n\n*\n\n*So you should round up the actual space occupied by each new file installed/upgraded to the nearest 4 kB.\n\n*If there are a lot of small sub-4k files in the packages being installed, then the actual disk space used will be than the estimate.\n\n\n*Finally, your upgrade also installed a new kernel-image and kernel-headers; for safety reasons, apt-get will never remove the old kernel-image/headers.. This is what is probably taking up ~100MB of space.\n\n*\n\n*You can manually remove the older kernel after rebooting successfully: use dpkg --list | grep linux- to find out the exact package names to remove, or use Synaptic.\n\n\n", "Q: Do all updates, even kernel, take affect without rebooting I use 11.04.\nWhen I upgrade a package, it shows a message similar to this :\n  Unpacking replacement libkrb5support0 ...\n  Preparing to replace libgssrpc4 1.8.3+dfsg-5ubuntu2.2 (using .../libgssrpc4_1.8.3+dfsg-5ubuntu2.3_amd64.deb) ...      \n\na kernel message:\n  Examining /etc/kernel/postinst.d.\n  run-parts: executing /etc/kernel/postinst.d/dkms 2.6.38-13-generic /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.38-13-generic\n   * dkms: running auto installation service for kernel 2.6.38-13-generic----------------------------------------------\n    *       vboxhost (4.1.18)...

Is this true in all versions of Ubuntu?\nThank you~\n\nA: Kernel updates will need a reboot to complete.  \nAfter a kernel update, the new kernel is installed but Ubuntu continues to run to old kernel until reboot.  upon reboot, the new kernel is loaded.\nMost other updates can be done with the system running, any open applications that were updated run the old version until they are restarted but the system does not have to be restarted, just the application.  This is because the running application is loaded into the RAM so they continue to happily run the older, loaded version until they restart at which time they reload from the hard disk with the new version.\nAbout the kernel update message you posted;\nThis update message is telling you that the new kernel is being installed and the system boot files updated and then finally that Grub is being updated to find the new kernel and then add it to the boot list as the default version at boot.  While the new kernel is installed on the disk and set as the default boot selection, it will not be loaded until reboot.  \nIf you install one of the updates that need a reboot to take affect, after a short time the gear icon on the top right hand corner of your screen(assuming you are using Unity) will turn red to notify you that you need to restart.  If you try to log off when a restart is needed a dialog box will pop up notifying you that a reboot is needed and asking you if you would rather restart instead of logging off.\nEdit: I forgot to mention that this is true not matter what version of Ubuntu you are running.\n", "Q: How to upgrade boost lib using apt-get?

I have recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit on a Lenovo X220, that is certified to work correctly with the OS (see here) including its default 128Gb SSD by Samsung. As soon as I got the laptop I have immediately upgraded to a Crucual M4-CT512M4SSD1 (7mm 512Gb) SSD that apparently works nicely but for what is described below.

The laptop has a SATA 3 controller. The full disk is used for Ubuntu, and fully encrypted with LVM.\nThen, basic performance indicators: see palimpsest's output here, hdparm below: \ngiacecco@giaceccos-x220:~/Temp$ sudo hdparm -Tt /dev/sda\n/dev/sda:\nTiming cached reads: 9664 MB in 2.00 seconds = 4834.41 MB/sec\nTiming buffered disk reads: 1402 MB in 3.00 seconds = 466.81 MB/sec\n\nAssuming hard disk encryption is not relevant, the SSD appears to be slow in respect to the 128Gb equivalent on cached reads but faster on timing buffered reads (according to some benchmarks on wiki.archlinux.org). I do not have sufficient understanding of SSD architecture to understand if this can be considered normal or not.\nFinally, the actual issue.

Thanks!\nGiacecco\n\nA: The COMRESET line is simply a side-effect of the previous line in the log:\nata1: link is slow to respond, please be patient (ready=0)\n\nIf everything seems to be working fine, all that means is that the device (SSD) takes a few seconds to \"wake up\", and impatient Ubuntu spits out warnings.\nThe very next line shows that the device wakes up half-a-second after the warning:\nata1: SATA link up 6.0 Gbps (SStatus 133 SControl 300)\n\nAll in all, no problems and nothing to worry about. Cached reads are a synthetic benchmark and your rate is certainly speedy enough; naturally, at 5 GB/sec you may be limited by the full disk encryption.

Done\nmysql-client-core-5.5 is already the newest version.\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 47 not upgraded.\n\nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: First, remove the current version of MySQL you're already using:\n$ sudo apt-get purge mysql-client-core-5.5\n\nNow, to install MySQL, run the following command from a terminal prompt:\n$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server\n$ sudo apt-get install mysql-client\n\nDuring the installation process you will be prompted to enter a password for the MySQL root user.\nOnce the installation is complete, the MySQL server should be started automatically. You can run the following command from a terminal prompt to check whether the MySQL server is running:\n$sudo netstat -tap | grep mysql\n\nWhen you run this command, you should see the following line or something similar:\ntcp        0      0 localhost.localdomain:mysql           *:* LISTEN -\n\nIf the server is not running correctly, you can type the following command to start it:\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart\n\nYou can edit the /etc/mysql/my.cnf file to configure the basic settings: log file, port number, etc.\n\nA: That suggestion seems a little bizzare because it would miss out other dependencies and utilities. I would just run this and be done with it:\nsudo apt-get install mysql-client\n\n\nA: This command installs the MySQL server, which you need.\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nIf you want to run commands from the workbench and not from a terminal, you need the client as well (this is optional):\nsudo apt-get install mysql-client\n\nFor MySQL Workbench (also optional):\nsudo apt-get install mysql-workbench\n\n\nA: First you have to remove mysql completely from your system using following commands in terminal\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nNow try to reinstall Mysql.\n", "Q: Can Google Desktop be used with 12.04? I would like to use Google Desktop with ubuntu 12.04.

This only has 4 SATA so I was thinking of getting a Highpoint Rocket Raid 2720SGL controller.\nHighpoint web site says it support \"Lunix\" \nI have download the drivers from Highpoint, but they seems to be compile your own.\nHas anyone got these to work with 12.04?\nDose anyone have the step to make them work?\nThx.\n\nA: I just installed the card and didn't install any drivers. It seems to work as an HBA (host bus adapter). As far as I can tell, software RAID is better than fake-RAID. I have a RAID0 on it that I configured using mdadm (software RAID). The RAID0 was already configured before I added the rocketraid card, and I didn't have to do anything else after that. Essentially, I am using the Rocketraid to add more SATA ports.\nI am booting from a separate SSD, so perhaps that makes the switch easier, however I did have some issues with booting. I have two SATA controllers on my motherboard, and with the Rocketraid card installed, I can boot from a disk connected to the Rocketraid or from a disk on the Marvell SATA controller. Of course the SSD takes a performance hit with the Marvell SATA controller (540 GB/s vs 400 GB/s read speed), so I just switched the SSD to the Rocketraid and it boots just fine. Once booted, I can see and use drives on the on-board (non-Marvell) SATA controller.\nFor what you want to do, my free recommendation would be to get the Rocketraid 2720SGL and two SAS/SATA cables so that you will have 8 SATA ports total.  There are certainly other cards out there, but the 2720 has two main advantages - SATA III/6Gb/s and PCI-e x8.  Most other \"cheap\" cards out there are x1.\nEdit: Now I'm having issues with booting from my startup up disk, which is connected to the controller. I think this is because I added disks after the OS was installed. I seem to remember something buried in a readme file about that.\nAt any rate, I decided to install the drivers: here's what I did:\nDownload the webGUI for linux and the open source drivers. I used the generic Linux drivers. http://www.highpoint-tech.com/USA_new/CS-PCI-E_2_0_x8_Configuration.html\nTo install the drivers, untar the source and navigate to the rr272..blah..product/rr272x/linux folder. There is a readme me along the way, so might as well read it.  In the linux folder, the usual make, make install will build the drivers. You might need build-essential and a few other packages (apt-get install build-essential). There was an error about not finding rr272x_2x, but it seems ok, the driver is rr272x_1x.\nNow to install the webGUI, unzip/untar/unpack the webGUI from the website. This is an rpm package so use alien to un-rpm it and convert it to a deb package: alien rr272..blah..$ARCH.rpm. Choose the one appropriate for your architecture type (32 bit versus 64 bit). This will spit out a deb package, which you can install with dpkg -i blah...foo.deb (apt-get install alien, if you don't have it already)\nNow reboot, cross your fingers, and short to ground.\nOnce rebooted, open a terminal and set up the driver for htpsrv to use. This is detailed in the readme file, echo rr272x_1x > etc/htpcfg\nnow start the server by typing hptsvr in the terminal. You should see fireworks, hear bells and whistles, and be generally underwhelmed by the lack of output. Next, go to your open-source browser, such as Firefox, and navigate to localhost:7402. You might have to substitute an ip address instead of localhost. -u RAID -p hpt You can flash the BIOS via the webGUI too, but I found this out after I went through all the trouble of creating a Freedos USB disk.\n", "Q: Vmware installation over ubuntu sever 12.04 lts How to install  vmware workstation 7.1.6-744570.i386 on Ubuntu Server 12.04 lts.\ni installed it but error is coming .\nVmware kernel module updater Unable to build kernel module.\nSee log file /tmp/vmware-root/setup-8887.log for details.\nmake[2]: * [/tmp/vmware-root/modules/vmmon-only/linux/driver.o] Error 1\nmake[1]: * [module/tmp/vmware-root/modules/vmmon-only] Error 2\nmake[1]: Leaving directory /usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-27-generic-pae'\nmake: *** [vmmon.ko] Error 2\nmake: Leaving directory/tmp/vmware-root/modules/vmmon-only'\nplease provide the solution for this \n\nA: This is a VMware problem.\nSome kernel internals relating to the spin lock changed from 2.6 to 3.0 and VMware didn't' back port the changes to 7.1.6. \nI dont believe there is a workaround at the moment.\n", "Q: Is there a schedule for the system updates that come through update manager in 12.04?

Am I being paranoid or is this a real concern?\n\nA: ubuntu wiki seems to suggest that there is no set schedule. They say they don't update unless it's important but there can be times where a lot of updates get sent out. It also is a fairly new release, which is where most of the updates happen.

This is perfectly reasonable as this would generally require human intervention to decide if you want to boot into the recovery etc. hoever, I would like to override this and set a timeout and boot to the OS every time. \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: If you add timeout=10 to /boot/grub/custom.cfg (creating the file if it doesn't already exist) then the menu will be displayed for 10 seconds every boot, regardless of any settings in /etc/default/grub or any failed boots. If you do this, you should also add a comment explaining this to /etc/default/grub so that the next person that tries to change the timeout (which is normally done by editing /etc/default/grub) will know that the setting has been overridden in /boot/grub/custom.cfg.\n", "Q: Chromium Doesn't want to run Java applets I can run the Java test page here in firefox, and it works fine.

Ubuntu and data experts, please, any advice on this situation:\nWe had a server with Ubuntu 12.04 with 2 HDDs in RAID1. One day system just didn't boot and after some investigation we realized that not all data are in place, in fact. There are no /home, /bin and /var folders\nHere's a screenshot from Ubuntu Desktop Live CD. Could someone explain how this happened: \n\nWe checked HDDs with fsck - nothing came up\nSmartmontools showed around 200 sectors to remap on 1st HDD, and everything is fine on the 2nd one.\nWe tried to restore data with TestDisk - no files in /home, /bin, /var. Just these folders - /home, /bin, /var which are shown red (as deleted, I guess)  (same on both HDDs)\nActually, we found a bad block on 1 HDD with TestDisk (on picture below), but how just one bad block can affect more than 32 GB of data? Could that be a superblock?\n\nMy question - is there any way we could restore that hidden data? And could someone tell me how this happened, was it hardware failure or someone's evil intent?\nUpdate: Phillip thank you very much for your answer, \nFirst of all, running Nautilus as root doesn't give us access to any additional files.\nSecond, you're right, we checked /dev/md1 with Testdisk, not individual HDDs, because Testdisk didn't want to work on /dev/sda2 or /dev/sdb2 saying that this partition is a part of a raid array. \nThird, I said that /bin, /home and /var are shown red when checking RAID with TestDisk, but those folders appear to be empty when I tried to get inside them (when in TestDisk)\nForth, here's output of sudo ls -ld /home /var /bin :\ndrwxr -xr -x 2 root root 2799 Apr 23 11:41 /bin\ndrwxr -xr -x 1 root root 60 Aug 9 18:56 /home\ndrwxr -xr -x 1 root root 120 Apr 23 11:38 /var\n\nBut this command checks not desired disk, but our virtual disk (we're working under Ubuntu live CD right now)\nSo, we modified this command to get to our desired mounted HDD like this: sudo ls -ld home var bin etc\nls: cannot access home: No such file or directory\nls: cannot access var: No such file or directory\nls: cannot access bin: No such file or directory\ndrwxr -xr -x 92 root root 4096 Aug 5 20:31 etc\n\n(I added etc to the command just to check if command works, because etc is available on our HDD)\n\nA: Your first screenshot does not indicate a data loss. The message \"some contents unreadable\" indicates that the file manager could not read the sizes of all files because of file system permissions, not because of file system damage.\nRunning nautilus as root or sudo du -h /path on the command line will give you the file usage of all files.\nSecond, you say that folders are shown in red. What do you mean by this (where are they shown as red)? Deleted files and folders are not shown at all, so that is not the cause. It could be that there are just the permissions missing, or that these directories are in fact not directories but symbolic links where the target is missing (in this case, ls for example shows them in red color).\nTo further clear things up, please paste the output of sudo ls -ld /home /var /bin.\nAs to the read error, you say it is on one HDD, but the screenshot says it is on /dev/md1 (so on the raid with both disks)? In general, a single failure on a file system can create a complete data loss, but this is unlikely. I think you will be able to recover your data if you are careful, don't do something prematurely, and interpret all the signs and messages correctly.\nAn important note:\nBefore you do anything, especially something which changes data on the disks (this includes raid resync, mounting, fscks, testdisk runs etc.), please make a complete bitwise dump of the disks! Only this way you will be able to safely experiment.\n", "Q: Why am I getting a \"failed to create pid file...Permission Denied\" error? If a program requires write permission how should I set it with chown? Specifically, what would program foo's permissions be to solve this error?\nfailed to create pid file '/var/run/bar.pid': Permission denied\n\n\nA: If you have a program foo trying to create/write to a file, the permissions of the foo binary don't matter, but the user it's running as makes all the difference.\nIn this case, foo is trying to write to /var/run, which is owned by root and only writable by root.\nSo you would have to run the program as sudo foo for it to create that PID file. Please consider the security implications of allowing a program to run as root before you do it...\n\nA: What I did is simply add the creation of a folder just before the start-stop-deamon is executed. This works because the script is generally executed as root during start up. It just creates the folder in /var/run and changes the owner immediately, so a PID can be written.\nIn the example below, I check for the existence of the subfolder of /var/run where i put the PIDs as the current run user, in this case user 'pi' (since I am on a raspberry).\nAlso check this link since it was very educational to me: Python script to run as service, however, it did not cover the problem discussed here.\nExample portion of my shell script:\n# The process ID of the script when it runs is stored here:\nPIDFILE=/var/run/power/$DAEMON_NAME.pid\n\ndo_start () {\n    log_daemon_msg \"Starting system $DAEMON_NAME daemon\"\n    if [ ! -d /var/run/power ]; then\n        mkdir /var/run/power/\n        chown pi:pi /var/run/power/\n    fi\n    start-stop-daemon --start --background --pidfile $PIDFILE --make-pidfile --user $DAEMON_USER --chdir $DIR --startas $DAEMON -- $DAEMON_OPTS\n    log_end_msg $?\n}\n\n\nA: General approach: determine the user and group of the process trying to access the file. This is often found in the configuration of the software (such as webservers/mailservers/...), but if the software is already running use this:\nps aux \n\nLook for the process you want to configure access rights for. The first column tells you under which username it's running.\ngroups <username>\n\nThis will tell you to which groups the user belongs. \nChange the owner or group of the file to match the service.\nNote 1: As the question points out that the file is in /var/run/ I'm assuming only one process needs access, if this is not true, you shouldn't change owner or group, but you might consider adding the process' user to the group or creating a new group for this file/folder.\nNote 2: Funny things can happen with apparmor, which is a security system: it can prevent processes from writing to files and folders to which they have (on filesystem level) all necessary rights. With aa-status you can see whether a specific rule for your service is active.\n", "Q: How do I get an HP 1018 laser printer to work on 12.04? edit : already printed on windows-machine\nUbuntu 12.04, LJ 1018.\nI've tried making foo2zjs from sourse.\nI've downloaded firmware and placed it where necessarily manually from here\nI've also tried this - same as manual dowload but with some patches like stoping cups, etc..\nI've fixed usbfs: process 11200 (usb) did not claim interface 0 before use\n problems using sudo rmmod usblp as described here.\nAnd now I have \nAug 10 11:51:59 pav /usr/sbin/hplj1018: foo2zjs: usb://HP/LaserJet%201018?serial=KP07RLV... download failed.\nAug 10 11:51:59 pav /usr/sbin/hplj1018: foo2zjs: loading HP LaserJet 1018 firmware /lib/firmware/hp/sihp1018.dl to CUPS USB device ...\n\nerror.\nBefore that prinet was stucking on \"Sending data to printer\".

Just as if there is no display output from the graphics card, or the resolution is not being read by the monitor. Actually, there is an output, but it is out of sync.

You should be more worried about Hardware , it has more tendency to damage in such cases.\n", "Q: Can I use Ubuntu as a wireless media server which performs all decoding/processing server-side?

I want only bandwidth of Wi-Fi to be use in this and media center hardware resource.Remote end gadget should use only speaker and screen and not processing power of their own.\nPlease any suggestion is it possible to do so ?\n\nA: Although this is not a totally \"pure\" answer to your question (client still performs some processing), you seem to be describing a process called transcoding.\nTranscoding involves the server playing a compressed file and sending a decompressed stream to the client. Thus the server does most of the heavy lifting because playing a pure, uncompressed WAV- or MPEG- like signal requires much less computation than would be necessary for a compressed original source such as MP3, Matroska with x264 compression, etc.\nThere's a few options for UPnP servers that support transcoding on Ubuntu. I like PS3 Media Server. From what I've read rygel looks pretty promising as well. MediaTomb and uShare are two other fairly popular UPnP servers, but I don't believe they transcode.\n\nHope this helps! I don't know how stringent your requirement is. If you need the client to do absolutely zero processing, this obviously won't work. But you may find this lightens the load enough for your purposes. Good luck.\nPS: In the strictest sense izx is correct - the only way (of which I am aware) to perform this with absolutely zero processing at the recipient is as he describes. Pure AV signal just like you could put into a television.\n\nA: If you want the \"media server\" to perform all processing and only the \"screen and speakers\" to be used on the remote side, and to do this over wifi, you need to use HDMI-over-WiFi.\n", "Q: How to get Ubuntu version number on the Wallpaper?

The only problem is that it is configurable only via editing a config file by hand, but displaying static text only is pretty easy.\n\nA: One way of doing this is to modify your background image in a graphics editor (Like GIMP).  \nYou can add a text layer and place the text anywhere you like  on your wallpaper. If you use your background wallpaper dynamically in LightDM then you should also disable the LDM greeter UBUNTU 12.04LTS to avoid overlap.

Currently am unable to use the disk space of '/' or /media/data . I want to merge all three partitions into the '/'. But I have my 80gb of data in /home. How do I merge all the partitions into '/' without losing my data and not crashing my system?\n\nA: I guess this is sort of the reverse of this question: Change default location of programs / users\nAs always, the safest option would be to backup all your data before messing around with anything.\nIf 120gb is enough to store all your current data, from all three partitions, I would suggest first booting into recovery mode, and then moving everything to that partition.  Then I believe you would have to edit fstab to be able to actually use the data.\nThen, you can edit, i.e. merge, your partitions using gparted from a live USB stick, extending your 120gb partition and getting rid of the other two.\nIf 120gb isn't enough, I guess you would have to move things around a bit, for example backup to an external disk, and then merge your partitions before you can move the files to the single partition.\nSince I'm not particularly well versed in the commands needed for the above steps, I would probably try the following.  Perhaps not the most elegant, but I'm sure it's functional.\nFirst backup all relevant data to an external disk, and then reinstall Ubuntu.  Using the advanced settings from the CD or USB stick, merge the partitions and reinstall to that single partition.  Then restore your backup data.  I know that copying your /home folder also copies any configuration files (for example browser history).  I've only done this with /home, but I would think that the same goes for the \"/\" and /media/data partitions, meaning you shouldn't lose any of your data.  Just make sure that you backup all the hidden files and folders as well.\n", "Q: How do I convert an MP4 to an MP3? I have some songs which are in mp4 format and I want to convert them into mp3 format. \nI am new to Ubuntu/Linux. So please explain the step by step process or give any software which can do the above job.\n\nA: Here's how to extract the audio from an MP4 video losslessly (keeping the original sound intact without reducing quality)\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -acodec copy audio.m4a\n\nGranted, this results in an M4A audio file not MP3. But most software and cell phones now can play M4A out of the box. \n\nA: I would recommend Sound Converter. It is extremely simple to use for what you want. You can find it in the Software Center, or install it from the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install soundconverter\n\nUbuntu Repo: soundconverter\nApt Link: Install soundconverter \nAll you need to do is open it up, change your preferences (Edit -> Preferences) then click the \"Add File\" or \"Add Folder\" buttons to add the music to be converted, and click Convert. It doesn't get much simpler.\n\nA: I have extracted the audio from mp4 and m4a files and converted them to mp3 format many times; it is very useful when a lot of podcasts come in m4a or mp4 format.\nI found that the most reliable way to allow ffmpeg to use proprietary formats was to build it from source, although you can see if it works with jfreak53's method if you do not wish to build from source. (After uninstalling any ffmpeg files, I compiled ffmpeg from source using this guide)\nIn addition, the following script, which I have modified, (credit to the original creator), preserves the original name of the file in the newly converted file, which may be useful for you. Save it in a text editor and make it executable with chmod +x yourscriptname.\n#!/bin/bash\nfor f in *.mp4\ndo\n    name=`echo \"$f\" | sed -e \"s/.mp4$//g\"`\n    ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -vn -ar 44100 -ac 2 -ab 192k -f mp3 \"$name.mp3\"\ndone\n\nIn addition, following a suggestion by evilsoup, you could also use the following one-liner. It 'converts every MP4 in the current directory to an MP3', preserves the original name of the file, and 'to use it for an flv or avi or whatever, simply change both instances of mp4':\nfor f in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -vn -c:a libmp3lame -ar 44100 -ac 2 -ab 192k \"${f/%mp4/mp3}\"; done\n\n\nA: If you mean export the audio from the video MP4 file then use ffmpeg, I do this all the time from FLV files. Firstly install ffmpeg:\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg libavcodec-unstripped-52\n\nThe run:\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -f mp3 -ab 192000 -vn music.mp3\n\nIt might say that your missing some codecs for MP4, in that case just run:\naptitude search codecname\n\nAnd find it to install.\nBy the way, you can get more information about this by searching the web.

I use it now. I used to use ffmpeg, but it was a little complicated and some formats weren't available/didn't work.\n\nA: I would recommend Winff a GUI for ffmpeg for all video/audio conversions.\nAll you do is add the video, choose your output (audio, mp3) in this case, choose the folder the converted file is to be saved in and click convert.  \nsudo apt-get install winff\n\nA: Combining things here, but this keeps file names and dumps a original sound copy to m4a:\nfor f in *.mp4; do name=`echo \"$f\" | sed -e \"s/.mp4$//g\"` && ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -vn -acodec copy \"$name.m4a\"; done\n\n", "Q: How do I start an application as a service?

Downloaded Ubuntu tweak and set window controls to the right side. Only some programs follow the rule. Pidgin as an example has window controls on the right. But Chrome, Thunderbird, Geany, still have controls on the left.\nHow can I move ALL window controls(close/min/max) to the right (or left)?\n\nA: 14.04\nShort answer:\nIt seems that Canonical went the totalitarian way and ordered that users should not be allowed to change the buttons position (you can find more technical details of this change on the bottom of this post).\nAs for now the only way to have windows buttons on the right side in 14.04 is to switch from Unity to the Gnome Flashback session (what I personally recommend). More details on how to do that are presented below.\nSwitching to Gnome Flashback:\nOpen terminal and run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository universe\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-flashback\n\nNext logout and select Gnome Flashback session in login manager.\n\nYou can select between Metacity and Compiz managers. Metacity is more lightweight, however it lacks some effects. With Compiz you will get more similar experience to Unity. You can speed up Compiz by turning off animations plugin (use compizconfig-settings-manager).\nWhile in Gnome Flashback session, to move buttons to the right open a terminal and enter this command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout 'menu:minimize,maximize,close'\n\nBut I want to still use Unity:\nAs I wrote in technical details, Canonical hardcoded buttons position in their Unity plugin. Changing of this needs this plugin to be patched by some third-party programmers. As for now such a patch is not available. (When such a patch will be published, please edit this answer and post it here.)\nTechnical details of the change:\nUnity uses Compiz as its window manager. They used Compiz plugin called GTK Window Decorator to draw window borders and titlebars. This plugin draws borders basing on the Metacity theme, which itself is highly configurable. That is why until 14.04 we had been changing Metacity settings in order to change buttons position [1].\nNow they have resigned from using gtk-window-decorator and implemented window decoration right in their Unity Compiz plugin. They deliberately hardcoded buttons position on the left side and do not expose any position switch to the user, in order to maintain \"consistent user experience\", as they call it [2].\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04:\nFar more easy than I thought (or remember it was in previous versions)\n\n*\n\n*Install the unity tweak tool\n    sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\n\n\n*Open System Tools -> Preferences -> Unity Tweak Tool\n\n\n*On the tab \"Window Controls\" (last tab) you can now choose between Left or Right.\n\nA: 12.04 until 13.10\nfrom 12.04 and newer gconfeditor wont work use this:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout ':minimize,maximize,close'\n\n14.04\n@Piotr Jurkiewicz answer\n\nA: For Ubuntu 12.10 and lower.\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*Type: gconf-editor\n\n*Go to Apps -> Metacity -> General\n\n*Find: button_layout\n\n*Change value to: menu:minimize,maximize,close\nFor Ubuntu 10.10 the string needs to be menu:minimize,maximize,close, with a comma in the end of the string.\n\nA: gsettings set org.gnome.shell.overrides button-layout :close,minimize,maximize\n\nTry the above command in the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T). This will work. It actually follows the principle of slicing in Python. You can give close,minimize,maximize: to move the keys to left. Further u can interchange the positions of close,minimize and maximize :)\n\nA: For ubuntu 17.10\nsimply type in terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout 'close,maximize,minimize:'\n\n\nA: For 12.04 and 12.10\nUnity\nRun this command in a terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout \":minimize,maximize,close\"\n\nNote that this will only change the position of the window controls of non-maximized windows. The maximized windows will continue to have their window controls on the left in title bar. To set the controls back to being on the left side:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout \"close,minimize,maximize:\"\n\n\nGNOME-shell\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.overrides button-layout \":minimize,maximize,close\"\n\n\nA: System>Preferences>Appearance Change the theme to something other than Radiance/Ambiance.\n\nA: You can also download Ubuntu Tweak, which has an easy GUI option to switch the window buttons to the right.  It's found under the Windows Manager Settings option, under the Desktop category.  Just select the \"Right\" radio button and you're done.\n\nA: I found that the gconf-editor suggestion just reversed the order of the buttons. They remained on the right hand side of the window. To switch buttons to the left hand upper corner, I used System Settings > Ubuntu Tweak > Tweaks > Window. Window Control\n\nA: Some applications do not adhere to the global window decorations, and Chrome is an example of this behaviour. Right-click its window border and choose \"use system window decoration\". Pretty much every major application other than Chrome uses the default, system-wide kind, so peobably this is all you will have to do.\nAlso, I strongly recommend you leave the button order as it is, because this change did not come out of nowhere. For instance, in Unity, maximized windows have their buttons in the top-left corner as well, and this tweak won't change that.\n\nA: In dconfig Editor go to org>gnome>desktop>wm>preferences>button-layout and change it to :minimize,maximize,close and hit enter.\nBe sure that you include the colon before minimize.\nI have two laptops using the gnome desktop environment.

I am using terminator 0.96 as terminal emulator. How can I make it run in the background and make it appear/disappear like guake terminal (i.e. using a shortcut key). \n\nA: The easiest way to do this would be use xdotool, and use the windowunmap/windowmap command to hide/unhide the desired class of windows. (This approach was not mentioned in the other answers that mention xdotool.) The solution will work well across all desktops, whatever window manager they are using. As the manpage notes,\n\nIn X11 terminology, mapping a window means making it visible on the screen. \n\nSo, unmapping a window will do the opposite and hide the window. Unfortunately, there is no toggle available to use with xdotool to switch between map/unmap states, but the two commands you need are below. The first hides the window:\nxdotool search --class terminator windowunmap %@\n\nand the second reverses the effect:\nxdotool search --class terminator windowmap %@\n\nPlease note that if the window is already minimised, the windowunmap command will be unsuccessful.\nFor more information see man xdotool, the Ubuntu manpages online, and my answer to this related question.  \n\nA: By selecting a set of preferences in Terminator, you can make it work almost similar to Guake.\nRefer to the following article for detailed explanation.\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2011/07/install-terminator-with-built-in-quake.html\nI would advise you to follow all the steps in the article to get the desired results.

So I was wondering if I installed Ubuntu individually instead of inside my windows installation, then it would perform much better. I assume that because then Ubuntu wouldn't have to navigate to it's folder all of the time. I might also be able to access folders from my hard drive as well, even with my windows installation broken. So would it perform any better if I installed it individually without using an OS?\n\nA: Yes. An independent Ubuntu (dual-boot) configuration will be faster and may be more stable than a Windows-based (Wubi) install.\n\nA: Independent Ubuntu installation in its defined Filesystem (EXT4) performs much better then NTFS. \nFrom Wubi page \n\nWubi uses a virtual disk that is sensitive to forced shutdowns.\n  If Wubi becomes damaged as a result of a hard reboot, there is a\n  chance that Windows may also become corrupted since the principle\n  behind Wubi is that of a virtual disk within the host operating\n  system.\n\nInfact this kind of Question was addressed previously , you can refer here\nWhat performance differences are there when installing with Wubi?\n", "Q: Battery not charging beyong a certain percentage After checking two HP Laptops, one relatively new, only 2 months old and the battery is less than a week old. The other one is about a year old. both have the same issue. The laptop's battery charges up to a certain percentage and then stops right there.\nHere is an image of what I see when checking the charge:\n\nThe way  I read this is that the Total Battery Energy by design is 88.8Wh.

Somehow is not charging completely or not showing the correct percent.\n\nA: You should try recalibrating it; discharge first to the auto-shutdown/hibernate point (~5%), not to 0%. Does it charge with earlier Ubuntu versions? If so, that may indicate a problem with Ubuntu.\n\nA: I have seen that happen on old, almost-dead batteries. I have also seen that happen when the power supply on the laptop failed. On my 18-month old Dell, acpi -V returns \"last full capacity = 87%\".\nAre the 2 laptops the exact same model?

When I start my system it asks me if I want to select Ubuntu or Windows 7.  No problem, but I wanted to dual boot by giving ubuntu 250 gb and keep 2500 gb for my windows.  The only problem is I am afraid that if I install Ubuntu on my machine and use the new partition I created that I will not actually be able to boot into it(because I already have a version installed)\nAlso, if I just install Ubuntu from an iso will it let me select which system to boot into, or am I better off to leave it how it is now?\nThanks\n\nA: Do you want to keep the version you have now?  The easiest and safest way to accomplish what you have said would be to remove the current version, which you can do via the Windows uninstall.  If you need data on the current version, you could copy the needed data to the Windows partition or an external drive.  Copying your home directory is usually enough, although if you have installed a lot of programs that have configurations, some of this might be stored in the /etc directory.\nInstalling the new version will normally keep the existing Windows, assuming you don't tell it to do something differently.  The default is to keep any existing operating systems, but this can be defeated.  The only thing it will do that is somewhat destructive is to add a boot manager that will replace the normal Windows MBR code.  Once this is done, you don't want to simply delete the Ubuntu partition without first repairing this, which is not hard.\nYou can read more on the Ubuntu Help site\n\nA: You should remove the Windows version (Wubi) first by uninstalling it from Windows like any Windows program.

In other words, when I invoke this command, it complains about missing a package I already installed.  Weird.\nHere is the missing link: cowbuilder--and by extension, pbuilder--are trying to create a clean, minimal, chroot environment, inside which there are no extra packages installed.  Even though cowbuilder is already installed outside the chroot, it appears to want to be installed inside the chroot as well.  Inside and outside the chroot are totally different worlds.  Outside the chroot (the regular environment), your /etc/apt/sources.list file is king.  But inside, it is a different set of rules.  The default pbuilder environment only includes the most critical and minimal repositories necessary for a base/clean install.\nThe accepted answer talks about adding the \"COMPONENTS\" argument and specifying some additional repositories.  It did not work for me.  I tried adding the COMPONENTS value to the /etc/pbuilderrc file, my local .pbuilderrc file, and also doing that on the command line as an environment variable.  No luck. I did find a few references that mentioned how the COMPONENTS argument is not supported for cowbuilder.\nFinally, I stumbled upon a blog post that talked about adding a variable named OTHERMIRROR to the /etc/pbuilderrc file.  For me, I simply added the following:\nOTHERMIRROR=\"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu saucy main restricted universe multiverse | deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu saucy-backports main restricted universe multiverse | deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu saucy-security main restricted universe multiverse | deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu saucy-updates main restricted universe multiverse\"\n\n[Note that you can update/change saucy to whatever  you would like (e.g. trusty, raring, precise, or even wheezy and sid provided you have the appropriate debian mirrors, etc.).\nThen, I simply ran the following from the command line and everything was created successfully and I was able to proceed:\nsudo cowbuilder --create  # defaults to using current distribution\n\nObviously you can change distributions using the \"--distribution\" command line argument.  It takes a few minutes to establish the initial environment, but once it is created, you can easily update the packages, etc. using cowbuilder.\nThe cowbuilder page on the Debian website talks about creating an Ubuntu-specific cowbuilder. It mentions that cowdancer has been moved to the universe repository. They reference running the following command to build a cowbuilder environment on Ubuntu:\nDIST=trusty sudo cowbuilder --create --distribution trusty --components \"main universe\"\nThe --components=\"main universe\" flag is the critical piece to ensure the creation process has access to all the necessary repositories.\n", "Q: Is it safe to upgrade OS X from Snow Leopard via the App Store on a dual-boot system? I have a MacBook Pro that dual-boots Ubuntu 12.04 and OS X Snow Leopard. I'd like to upgrade OS X to Mountain Lion, but have never done this on a dual-boot OS X system before. Will the upgrade work safely, or is it to likely to mess with the EFI stuff and my partitions? \n\nA: I did the same thing about four days ago, but the upgrade was from Lion to Mountain Lion. I also have done the same with Snow Leopard to Lion. I have a triple boot with windows 7, ubuntu 12.04, and osx, with refit (which I highly recommend installing if you haven't already). All of this on a MacBook Pro 5.5.\nHow I upgraded was through the app store (downloaded, and then clicked open the file and told it to install. I did not upgrade through making a DVD or usb, and it was not a clean install, so I can't say if that will some how change things.) and it worked perfectly fine for me. I'd be interested though to see if anyone has had issues like that before.\nBut, hope this helps ease your worries. If anything just be safe and back everything up of course.\n=)\n-Barkerto\n\nA: I'm going to answer my own question, as it was not a straight-forward process, but it all worked safely in the end.\n\n\n*\n\n*After downloading the Mountain Lion installer from the App Store, I ran it, but it wouldn't allow me to install onto my \"Macintosh HD\", giving the message \"This disk cannot be used to start up your computer\".\n\n*The solution to this is to resize your target install permission to provide 128MB of space afterwards, as described here. However, my disk couldn't be resized as disk utility produced the error \"MediaKit reports no such partition\".\n\n*However, I was able to run disktutil resizeVolume from the term, but this failed during the validation stage due to errors in the filesystem. Disk Utility was unable to fix these online, so I needed to boot from an OSX install disk to run Disk Utility from there.\n\n*At this point I ran into an issue that my Leopard and Snow Leopard install CDs wouldn't boot up correctly (the former just hung, the latter kept restarting my system). Luckily I had a Lion install CD, and this was able to boot and I could run Disk Utility from there to repair the partition.

When you\n  installed Ubuntu, you answered some simple questions such as\n  specifying your country and language. Ubuntu used the answers to those\n  questions, in part, to choose a suitable locale for your installation.\nThe basic functionality is provided by the locale package, which is\n  installed by default. Actual locales are installed separately via the\n  language-pack-* packages.\n\n\n\nMost users want a single locale to be used for all aspects of their\n  session. In this case, the GUI provided by System Settings -> Language\n  Support does the right thing. \nBelow are some of the things that you can do:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*List installed locales\n  \n*List current settings\n  \n*Changing settings temporarily\n  \n*Changing settings permanently\n  \n*(Re-)Generating locales1\n\nRead On\n1Source:Ubuntu Documentations\n", "Q: How to restart in live cd persistence?

(/hibernate.img)\nIn the corner of the screen, it says system snapshot, compression ratio, etc.\nHowever, when I resume from hibernate, the top left corner reads \"resuming from hibernate.img\" but then the system just freezes. Every time.\nSome of the tutorials mentioned using a specially compiled kernel, and I have not done this. The kernel is simply 3.2.0-25-generic.\nI am using 12.04 64-bit. Any help would be great.\n\nA: Do you really need a swap file? In Linux you usually make a swap partition. That is a partition solely dedicated to function as swap memory. If you installed Ubuntu on a blank disk, you should have one by default. If you chose your own partition layout and didn't make one, I suggest repartitioning to have one.\nThe only issue I have encountered with hibernation so far is that if the swap partition is smaller than your physical RAM, hibernate always fails. Is the image file larger than your RAM or not?\n", "Q: How can I make this evhz.c file to run properly? I'm really new at linux. I just installed Ubuntu 12.04- I compiled and tried to run a program but it doesn't work and I don't have a clue why. searched on google but no one seems to have a problem with it. It must be a silly error.\nthe program is evhz.c (link here: http://web.archive.org/web/20060623094750/http://homepages.nildram.co.uk/~kial/evhz.c ).

Do I need to be a member to report a bug? I have a Launchpad account and I tried reporting it while logged in but I see no option to do so.\n\nA: Those using Launchpad can use it for many things, or can choose only to use certain features. It appears to me that the group providing a PPA for Skype Wrapper only use Launchpad for hosting the packages in a PPA. Some projects may include a pointer to a bug tracker or to the project's homepage, but I don't see one in this case. \nThere is no rule that a project with a package in a PPA must take bug reports or continue to maintain their package.\nUbuntu uses the infrastructure developed by Debian, and packages follow Debian's rules. Included is a rule that all packages must include a changelog and that they should contain the e-mail for the person responsible for the change.\nAssuming you have installed the package you can view /usr/share/doc/skype-wrapper/changelog and view the last (top) changelog entry and that entry will give you a possible e-mail address you could use to ask that individual if bug reports are taken and where to send them. For the skype-wrapper package there is only one entry at this time.\n\nA: Just for the sake of completeness, I emailed the author and he told me they manage the bugs from Github: https://github.com/sagetarian/skype-wrapper\n", "Q: Very low volume from headphones and external speakers on HP p7-1235 (Ubuntu 12.04) Installed 12.04 on a new HP Pavilion desktop p7-1235 (AMD A8-5500 APU).

Used alsamixer to set everything to max, unmuted, same result.\n\nA: Try installing pavucontrol:\nsudo aptitude install pavucontrol\n\nIt might be that an output device has its volume low and the volume indicator doesn't control it (i.e. when you increase/decrease the volume, this only affects one sink only)\n\nA: There's a chance that your sound card might not be driving enough electricity to up the volume. If it goes lower when you reduce it, this may be a good indicator of that.\nThe best suggestion would be to get a set of externally powered headphones/speakers.\nSource: I had an HP DV-9000 with the same issue about 2 years ago.\n\nA: I'm not sure if you have done it yet, but try either\n\n\n*\n\n*new headphone maybe?\n\n*maybe you could try another version of ubuntu, possibly 12.10?

I usually have different instances of my web browsers to attend to various types of usages, on Windows that means using portable versions of Chrome and Firefox. The existing portable versions of Firefox and Chromium for Linux are outdated and lack immediate support, compared with the portable apps for Windows. I am wondering if there is any way to make the current versions of Firefox and Chromium provided by Ubuntu work as \"portable\", which by that I mean running as the equivalent of a Windows portable app, detached from the default browsers.\n\nA: Would using Mozilla Firefox with multiple 'profile' work?  Each of these would have separate settings, plug-ins, history, etc.\nUse this to setup additional profiles:\nfirefox -ProfileManager\n\nThen this to set a particular profile:\nfirefox -P <profile>\n\n\nA: I think its impossible to use two ubuntu firefox at the same time. you could choose your first or the alternative profile but you cant run them at the same time. To enter firefox in a shell will open the allredy running firefox instance, but no new one.\nOne idea could be to use the ubuntu firefox and a static linked firefox (if it is still avaible). \n\nA: As a last resort and if you chose to use Chromium you could set up multiple online profiles and just create multiple instances of the program and sign into each one of them individually.\nThis remembers your bookmarks, settings, extentions, history and everything else.\nOf course this will be a last resort due to the length of time it might take to setup all of these online profiles but it's worth a shot if all else fails.\n**Start a new window by right-clicking the icon and selecting \"Create a new window with a temp profile\" and sign in from there on each instance.\n\nA: If you launch then from the terminal you can get as many instance as needed.\nJust open a terminal and type:\nchromium-browser\n\n", "Q: Dual-Monitor with Radeon 7970 HD Graphics Card? I'm trying to setup dual 23'' dell ultrasharp monitors in 12.04 and have run into a few difficulties. I'm running a Radeon 7970 HD graphics card, and am using the latest catalyst (12-6) at the moment. \nUnfortunately, my right monitor is the only screen which is correctly configured, and my left monitor is at an extremely low resolution (640x480) and I'm having difficulty configuring it.\nI've also run into this, which basically says that my graphics card is only \"officially\" supported with catalyst 12-1.

I'm totally at a loss.  \nI'd really love to get this working and I've spend nearly a week installing and un-installing different drivers and versions of Catalyst. Any info about this would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The solution for me was eventually to update to 12.10. I'm currently on 13.04 now, but it seems to be a non-issue with this release.

I KNOW it's plugged in because I can see Windows 7 just perfectly.\n\nA: Option 1\nRe-download the .ISO from Ubuntu download site, and burn a CD (under your Windows OS).  Make sure to verify the checksum, as @Ketan suggests, before burning.\nThen proceed with install.\nOption 2\nAsk a friend.  Get them to create a USB install, from their existing Ubuntu machine.\nBoth of these methods generally will work, even when nothing else will.  Good luck ..\n\nA: It might be a graphics issue.

Is there any way I can run quickly applications from source on other distributions without installing deb package.\nWhat I need is to run/develop in non-debian based distributions.\n\nA: Assuming you have all of the build and run-time dependencies already installed:\nIf you are running on a debian related system but simply don't want to install a deb I would think you can use the package_version.tar.gz by uncompressing and untarring it into a directory. Then run debian/rules build to make the package and debian/rules install to install it.\nIt may be possible,using the same untarred directory, to use setup.py to install a quickly python package in the typical pythonic way.\n\nA: No, You must have install .deb packages or install .tar.gz by compiling packages.\n", "Q: Connection failed to open the DB connection: could not find driver I am newbie for Ubuntu and I was trying to run LAMP.\nI installed MySQL, and PDO extensions.

This applies to closing applications with middle click in the GNOME 3 'Activities' Overview.\nhttps://extensions.gnome.org/extension/352/middle-click-to-close-in-overview/\n\nA: Ubuntu and Unity still depend on metacity(!) for this kind of action. So you would find all possible 'titlebar action' possibilities in gconf-editor >apps>metacity>general. Unfortunatelly (as in gnome3) there is no 'window close' option.\nAs there is no 'out of the box' solution for your idea, my approach would be different.\nMost of your application will have a 'close' or 'quit' keyboard shortcut. That might be >ctrl< q for QUIT, or >ctrl< w for WINDOW CLOSE, or >ctrl<>shift< q to QUIT a gnome-terminal. \nI would now install the software easystroke and add a mouse gesture for the given command. The same mouse gesture can have a different command, following the active window. Let's say a 'right click' and drawing a 'circle' would mean >ctrl< w for the filemanager, but >ctrl<>shift< q for the gnome-terminal.\nThis solution would give you a similar ease of use, as 'middle-clicking' the titlebar. Needless to say that I am using this kind of solution... ;)\nHere is some video I found on the youtube... easystroke in action\n\nA: The Middle click has a special meaning in Unix like systems that use a certain library. If you mark text somewhere and then click on a field that accepts text, it will paste the marked text into that field (try it in your browser). So no matter what you do, you will not be able to make the middle-click work as expected for all applications.\nHowever, you can try mapping the middle click to a keyboard key and then assigning a keyboard shortcut to close windows.\n\nAnother possibility is using the Many Button Mouse or IronAHK.\n", "Q: Which of two video drivers am I using?

I am a beginner of Linux. I don't know to handle the following instructions, please teach me in details.\nThe instructions are below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the mmed-release-0.1/src/. \n\n*Modify the makefile to set appropriate PATHs for Vlfeat, Cplex, GSL Cblas. \n\n*To compile, type:\nmake\n\nCompiled mex files are put in ./bin/\n\n\n*\n\n*Compile LibSVM by going to the source directory and type:\nmake\n\n\n*Open Matlab, change directory to: ./src/. \n\n*Change the paths to HMMall and LibSVM, and run:\nm_setup \n\nMatlab might complain about name conflict of assert. This is the problem of Kevin Murphy’s HMM. Just ignore it.\n\nA: \n1.Go to the mmed-release-0.1/src/.\n\nThat means in a shell you should change directory (cd mmed-release-01/src/) to the mentioned directory. That might be in a folder created, when you unpacked the archive that contained Matlab.\n\n2.Modify the makefile to set appropriate PATHs for Vlfeat, Cplex, GSL Cblas. \n\nIn a file called \"Makefile\" in the directory mmed-release-0.1/src/ there should be variables that contain the location of the libraries \"Vlfeat\", \"Cples\", and \"GSL Cblas\". Since Matlab doesn't know how your system is configured you might have to set those library paths yourself. However you can install them with the Ubuntu package manager and then the linker should normally know where they are.\n\n3.To compile, type: make\n\nIn a shell (e.g. gnome-terminal) cd into the directory where the Makefile is located and execute make by typing \"make\" and pressing enter.\n\nCompiled mex files are put in ./bin/\n\nThe result of make can then be found in the subdirectory called bin of the directory where the Makefile is located.\n\n1.Compile LibSVM by going to the source directory and type: make\n\nChange directory to the root of the \"LibSVM\" library and make it as in the above step 3.\n\n2.Open Matlab, change directory to: ./src/. \n\nReally self explanatory.\n\n3.Change the paths to HMMall and LibSVM, and run: m_setup \n\nThat one I don't really get. Either you have to run the script m_setup in Shell or in Matlab. I assume, just like in the Makefile you have to change the respective paths in the file m_setup to the right location of the libraries \"HMMall\" and \"LibSVM\"\n", "Q: Understanding APT source code I want to analyze the APT source code.

Or maybe you are the admin and you just got frustrated with the awful state of VPN tools.\nYou don't want to create an ssh port forward for every single host/port on the remote network.\nYou hate openssh's port forwarding because it's randomly slow and/or stupid.\nYou can't use openssh's PermitTunnel feature because it's disabled by default on openssh servers; plus it does TCP-over-TCP, which has terrible performance (see below).\n\nHere is the discussion forum and here are the Debian Packages\n", "Q: What to do after Installing 12.04 LTS via WUBI?

I don't see proprietary drivers in the system settings.\n\n*How do I install all codecs in Ubuntu? Something like K-lite codec pack or CCCP for Matroska?\n\n*How do I make Ubuntu look like Windows? I don't like the launcher on the side.\n\nA: As far as knowing if your video card's driver is installed, you can look under System Settings --> Details.  Also you can click on Additional Drivers, to see if any drivers needed.\n\nFor installing Codecs, you need to install Ubuntu Restricted Extras.  You can do that from the Ubuntu Software Center, or by clicking below\n\nAs far as making Ubuntu look like window, Why?:) You can do that  by installing themes.  You just have to look for one that you like, and install it.  Also you may want to take a look at LXDE.  I have tried installing the Windows 7 theme, but with no luck.\n\nA: 1) open jockey-gtk \n2) go to software-center and install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n3) just use this article and find others on Google about how to make Ubuntu look like Windows 7\n", "Q: Wireless won't connect properly, keeps asking for a network key I have double and triple checked my network key and it is correct but I just can't connect to my wireless network.

I'm reading the Unix Programming Environment book. I came across the od command. The command works for the file contents but not for the directories when I run it. However, this command seems to work on directories when demonstrated by the authors of the book. \nWhen I run the following command : \nod -c .\n\nI get an error message that says : \nod: .: read error: Is a directory\n0000000\n\nWhy am I getting this error? \n\nA: Why od -c directory Doesn't Work\nA directory points to zero, one, or a bunch of files, it isn't really a file itself so it can't be processed by od or hd. Most Unix-like programs process files, not  whole directories.\nWhat to Do\nYou can list the contents of the directory with ls and then use the od -c or hd -b command to dump each file you want to examine. By doing them one-by-one you will know what each file contains.\n(od -c file1 file2 stuffs file1 and file2 together and then dumps the whole thing. That makes it heard to find where the first one ends and the next one begins.)\nYou could also write a little script to give you, one by one, the filename of each of the files in a directory and then dump it in octal or hex. Here's an example:\n for f in *; do echo $f; od -c $f; done | less\n\nfor f in * assigns each file in the current directory to $f in turn; echo $f provides the name of the file on your terminal preceeding each file dump; od -c $f produces the dump; and done says to go on with the next file or finish if there aren't any more. |less says take all of the above and send the output through the \"less\" program which let's you look at it bit by bit rather than having everything roll off the top of the screen.\nA script like this is interpreted by a program called by a \"shell\". When you are typing commands into the terminal you are talking to a \"shell\". By default, Ubuntu uses the \"bash\" shell.\nIf you would rather look at hex output you can use od -t x1 filename or hd filename. Use man od or man hd for more options.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you want to do an octal dump of all files in and below the current directory, use find, e.g.:\nod -c `find -type f`\nSee man find or google for a tutorial on find for more information.\n\nA: To be able to read directories as files, as shown in the book the Unix Programming Environment (page 51) isn't possible in recent releases of Linux. \nAs mentioned in this answer (When did directories stop being readable as files?) on the Unix & Linux sub-site this seems to be a break from the POSIX standard which allows directories to be read as files as long as they are opened in read-only mode. \nAlso relevant: How does one inspect the directory structure information of a unix/linux file? \n\nA: \nod [options] [files] od --traditional [file] [[+] offset [[+] label] ]\n\nDump the specified files to standard output. The default is to dump in\n  octal format, but other formats can be specified. With multiple files,\n  concatenate them in the specified order.

I'm creating my own fake Chromium OS session in Ubuntu 12.04. However I don't really know how to make it so that when I close Chromium, it automatically logs out on it's own.

Using AMD CC I set it up so that the notebook screen is my primary monitor and the 22\" my secondary. \nIf I am planning to watch a movie or the like I sometimes switch my notebook screen off by rotating through the available display configurations FN+F3. That works fine but as soon as I restart my PC the dual monitor setup I configured disappears and in its place I get a mirrored setup. Rotating through the configuration option doesn't help. \nAs a result, each time I turn off either of the screens, I have to reconfigure the dual monitor setup on next system start. That wasn't the case before with Ubuntu Natty.\nHow can I solve this problem?\nThank you very much in advance.\n\nA: I should create a script that replaces your xorg.conf file after every reboot.  Go into the /etc/ directory, and do the following:\nsudo cp ./xorg.conf ./xorg.conf_boot\nsudo nano ./script.sh\n\nThis is the content of the script to enter in nano:\n!#/bin/bash \ncp /etc/xorg.conf_boot /etc/xorg.conf\n\nThen use Ctrl+O to save and Ctrl+X to exit nano and then do the following:\nsudo chmod +x ./script.sh\nsudo mv ./script.sh /etc/init.d\nupdate-rc.d script.sh defaults\n\nI had to check out the way they do the inittab now, and I'm assuming that the thing edits the xorg.conf.\n", "Q: How to merge folders with different letter cases into one? Nautilus doesn't merge folders with the same name if one of them has uppercase letters and the other doesn't; if one is called \"Folder\" and the other is called \"folder\" then Nautilus wouldn't merge them. I have a large amount of files that I need to merge, is there a script that would allow Nautilus to mass merge them all? If not, is there another way than manually renaming all the folders?\n\nA: \nIt is by design. File and folder names are case-sensitive in *nix systems.\n\nRenaming can be automated in a variety of ways.  Mass renaming utilities are available, pyrenamer , \nnautilus-renamer  ,\nrename,\n mmv  , to quote a few.\nTo complete the answer, here is a script that does the renaming for you.\nrename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *\nThis should rename all files/folders to lowercase.\n\nA: NO, you can't simply merge them.\nIn any Linux or Unix (including Ubuntu), filenames and folder names are case sensitive.

I installed zRam as described on webupd8.org. I installed it from the terminal. Is that all I have to do or do I have to do some configuration or something? Does the zram-enabler do everything by itself or do I have to set some parameters?\n\nA: Starting with Ubuntu Precise, there is an official upstart script for Ubuntu by Adam Conrad to configure zram in the main repository:\nsudo apt-get install zram-config\n\nSource: http://gionn.net/2012/03/11/zram-on-debian-ubuntu-for-memory-overcommitment/\n\nA: Here you go. Here is the whole tutorial about zRam in Ubuntu:\n\nzRam is a code inside kernel, that once activated, creates a RAM based\nblock device which acts as a swap disk, but is compressed and stored\nin memory, allowing very fast I/O and increasing the amount of memory\navailable before the system starts swapping to disk.\nzRam is integrated into the Linux kernel 3.2 and above, so it's\nincluded already in Ubuntu 12.04.\nPreviously on my 2GB machine, without zRAM, when i open lots of\nbrowser tabs, the system start choking, while HDD start copying data\nto SWAP causing a total slowdown.  Now after activating zRam, instead\nof freezing after running out of RAM, the system worked like nothing\nhappened. I didn't notice any difference at all. It looked just like\nadding more RAM ;)\nFrom my experience, zRam is useful for people using computers with 1GB\nor 2GB RAM. Since zRam is compressing data, it require some processor\nresources. Not much, but always. For that reason i do not recommend to\nuse it with old processors. Also if you have 4GB RAM most likely it\nwon't be necessary to use it.\nTo activate it, type in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install zram-config\n\nTo remove [type the following]:\nsudo dpkg --purge zramswap-enabler\nsudo dpkg --purge zram-config\n\n\n\nA: Make sure to reboot Ubuntu and check if Zram started during boot. \nFollow the instructions as noted earlier to check by cat /proc/swaps\nIf you don't see your zram swap devices listed, (in my case too) then do this :\nsudo su  \nupdate-rc.d zramswap defaults\n\nThis will list zram as a startup service.\nreboot and check to see if it started during boot.\n\nA: Like Sergey \"Shnatsel\" Davidoff was quoted in that blog post, this package installs a script to run it as a service. The script automatically configures itself and the service starts up automatically. There is no further configuration needed. The service can be manually controlled via:\nsudo service zramswap start|stop|status|restart|reload|force-reload\n\n\nIf you open the deb package with file roller you can see that only two files are installed:\n/etc/init/zramswap.conf\n/etc/init.d/zramswap\n\nAlong with some documentation files. The DEBIAN directory contains package meta data and commands to initialize the service. Thats all there is in the package. The corresponding devices are named after this scheme: /dev/zram[0-9]\nHave you installed it via PPA? I recommend doing that.\n\nA: On my Ubuntu 14.04 VPS I had to run the following:\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r)\nsudo apt-get install zram-config\n\nThe first line installs the zram kernel module.\n\nA: The service daemon will activate instantly upon install. You can verify this by typing in a terminal:\ncat /proc/swaps\n\nThere should be some /dev/XXX entry (given you have a swap partition/file active) and at least one entries with \"swap\" in its name (there will be one for each processor core on our system). If not, try rebooting and type in the command again.\nThere are no further actions neccessary.\n\nA: Note that in Ubuntu 21.10 the zram module was removed by default (on Raspberry PI) to decrease the size of initramfs.  As a result you need to take an extra step to enable zram on a Raspberry PI:\nsudo apt install linux-modules-extra-raspi\n\nSee also:\n\nno longer works on ubuntu 21.10 (raspberry pi 4)\n#71 \n", "Q: Is there any way to boot Windows 7 partition in virtual machine? I have a dual boot machine with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Some time I need Windows 7 during my work. For that I reboot to Windows. It's not a way that I won't access NTFS partition. I need my Windows 7 environment sometime.\nIs it possible to boot my Windows 7 partition in virtual machine in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS? That would break me from rebooting. I had heard about Xen and KVM virtual system but don't know how to use.\nAny help to use Windows 7 partition on hard disk to boot in virtual box?\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, both Virtualbox and VMWare virtual machines will boot from a physical partition provided they are started with the appropriate permissions (gksudo/sudo).\n\n*The problem lies with Windows, in that its driver settings, particularly for storage devices, are not portable. Unless you modify the Windows registry to force start storage drivers for both the physical and virtual machines, you will mostly likely end up with a 0x0000007B STOP blue screen error each time which will require a restore or modifying the registry to fix.\nSee this guide for hints on how to do this and troubleshoot 0x7B errors if you want to try (it discusses physical-to-virtual conversions).\n\nA: If all you are looking to do is be able to use your existing Windows environment underneath Linux, what you are looking to do is best served by cloning your setup and migrating it into a VM. At that point, you resolve any registry issues once and only once (and more simplistically). Rather than dealing with the back and forth of drivers between underneath Linux and bare metal, converting it to a true VM will be as if you moved the Windows environment into a new computer. Windows is much more forgiving about that scenario.\nHow exactly to do it depends on what solution you want to use. Some links for further reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disk2VHD - a guide to migrate the Windows install to a VHD file from inside Windows itself. Says it works with VMWare and Virtual Box.\n\n*VMWare vSphere Converter - VMWare's conversion tool.\n\n*VirtualBox Guide - VirtualBox's guide to using their conversion tools.\n\n\nI'm not aware of any way to get it to work using Xen or KVM, but I could very well be wrong about that. VMWare or VirtualBox are most likely perfectly acceptable solutions, however.\n", "Q: A possible Java problem causing a java program to not work? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I install Minecraft? \n\nI think I installed Java correctly from Oracle, but I'm not too sure.

I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 with Gnome 3. I've tried multiple terminal emulators, but they all seem to have a common failing: you need to hold the ctrl key down while left clicking to open links in a browser, or right click and select the context menu option \"Open Link\".\nThis is sub-optimal for me. The machine I'm using as a Linux desktop environment is the laptop I use for work. I use this when I'm working from home and I'm in my bedroom as opposed to my office; in my office I have my Windows gaming rig and my local Linux server (which I usually access over SSH from the laptop or the gaming rig, and run tmux inside). I often use this when my wife is sleeping and I don't have the space to use an external mouse. I know that's a lot of extra details (bordering on off-topic), but I'm trying to give a clearer picture of the reasoning behind my use case, and rule out certain solutions that won't work. \nRight clicking and selecting open link and even holding the ctrl button down are easier when I can use the external mouse, but when I'm using the track pad, it's really uncomfortable to do so. Part of why I work from home and use the laptop in bed is because I have chronic pain conditions, so finding a way to customize my environment for my comfort is important to me, to help manage my disabilities.\nI've tried gnome-terminal, terminator, guake, and several others that I can't remember at the moment. rxvt doesn't even seem to recognize links (in regular or unicode versions), same for xterm. Unicode also seems to be important so that tmux draws correctly (there might be config tweaks to work around that, but that's just what I noticed when testing now).\nAny suggestions for how to configure one of the popular emulators to work with this, or another emulator to try? I've been using Guake lately since it seemed the best of them, but I'm definitely open to switching if it gets the job done. I would prefer not to hand-patch code, as I prefer to manage everything through apt if possible, but I will if it's necessary. I've avoided KDE-specific apps so far because of the extra overhead to get a single KDE app to run inside Gnome, but if there are no alternatives and it performs well enough, that's worth exploring as well.\nI'm sorry if this seems like a trivial concern to folks, but this is actually the single-most annoying thing I'm dealing with trying to use Linux as a desktop environment (which in my opinion says a lot of good things about the state of the Linux desktop). However, with my disability, I'm getting tempted to set my default boot back to Windows as a result. I got very used to using putty-url which handles this perfectly. \nThanks for your help.\n\nA: urxvt is probably the single most configurable emulator out there.

Unfortunately, the default looks of urxvt are not, shall I say, very convincing, it's more like the old xterm than the modern gnome-terminal, and the configuration runs through config files rather than context menus.

I have a DVD ISO file and I want to burn through the terminal.\nWe have many command formats but I am unable to choose the best & safe one. so please give me a best command to burn the ISO through the terminal. \n\nA: There are several ways to do this, but here are just two ways that I use regularly. Please replace /dev/sr1 with the device identifier of your target drive (find out what it is with inxi -d), and replace myiso with your iso and its disk location if necessary.\n\n*\n\n*wodim -eject -tao  speed=2 dev=/dev/sr1 -v -data myiso.iso\n\n\n*growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/sr1=myiso.iso\nMore information about the read and write capabilities of your drive can be found with the following command, again substituting my example /dev with your device identifier:\nwodim -prcap dev=/dev/sr1\n\nFor more options relating to wodim and growisofs, see their respective manpages by entering man wodim and man growisofs.\nFor installation of growisofs :\nsudo apt install growisofs\n\nFor installation of wodim :\nsudo apt install wodim\n\n\nA: An easy to remember command line:\nwodim CD.iso\n\nIt will use some defaults and try to guess your drive, which is fine in most cases.\nThat way you only need to set other options, like speed, if you really need to.\n\nA: I came to know that we can use dd also to write.Open your terminal ( CTRL + ALT + T ) \ndd if=/path/image.iso of=/dev/cdrom1\n\nif- Input File, path where you have the image.iso. \nof- Output File, where this file have to sent .\nIf you are trying to burn DVDs using dd, then you have to follow below command line.\ngrowisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/dvd=/path/image.iso\n\n\nA: Another possibility is to replace wodim with Jorg Schilling's cdrecord from Brandon Snider's PPA. This has often solved odd burning problems for me and has been tested extensively under my Trusty Tahr installation. First add the repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:brandonsnider/cdrtools\n\nNote that this will replace the wodim package with cdrecord as well as installing cdda2wav. Then find the appropriate device address for your DVD drive by running:\ncdrecord --scanbus\n\nFinally run a commandline like the following (your own device address will be different):\ncdrecord -v dev=0,0,0 -speed 8 driveropts=burnfree fs=32m -eject my_distro.iso\n\nA modern cdrecord has no issues with either CD or DVD burning, or Bluray for that matter...\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*CD and DVD Writing from the Linux Command Line\n\n*CDRTools: Brandon Snider\n\nA: Use the following command to locate your DVD drive:\nwodim --devices\n\nIt will list an output like below (bold emphasis mine):\n\n    wodim: Overview of accessible drives (1 found) :\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     0  dev='/dev/sg1' rwrw-- : 'TSSTcorp' 'CDDVDW SH-S223F'\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom the above output, we can determine the drive location. In this case, /dev/sg1 is the drive location.\nNow, to burn the ISO, you can use the following command:\nwodim -v dev=/dev/sg1 speed=10 -eject /home/$USER/file.iso\n\nReplace /home/$USER/file.iso with your preferred path.\n\nA: bashburn is your friend.\nsudo apt-add-repository universe\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bashburn\n\n\nCurrently BashBurn can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn data CDs/DVDs (Including CDRWs)\n\n*Burn music CDs\n\n*Burn CD/DVD-images\n\n*Rip data/music CDs\n\n*Manipulate ISO-files\n\n*and probably more…\n\n\nSource\n\nA: You could use Brasero, using command line arguments\nbrasero --help\n\n\nA: cdw \n\nI would recommend this nice app for burning disks with ncurse interface...\n\n", "Q: How to change audio input to output?

I have a folder with all dependencies needed for my program (gimp) in a folder.

But every time i try to dpk -i gimp.deb it throws me some error on Dependencies not met.\nHow can i tell the dpkg to search for dependencies in my own folder.\n\nA: dpkg makes this easy.\nsudo dpkg -i -R directoryname\nWhere directoryname is the directory where you have stored all the dependencies will -i install -R recursively. You may wish to move the gimp.deb out of that directory and install it separately once you've successfully installed all the dependencies.\nOther methods include writing a script to loop through the packages in the directory and creating a package list to install from but I don't believe these are necessary.\nSources:\nman dpkg\nhttp://www.tecmint.com/dpkg-command-examples/\n\nA: I'm afraid it's not enough to have the dependencies in a folder. The debian packaging system Ubuntu uses requires the dependencies to be installed in the system. Each installed package is added to a database.\nA possible advantage of this is that the dependencies' programs and other files will be copied to the directories that are part of the system's various search paths so other programs you install later will be able to use them too.\nIf you have to install the debs manually you can examine them first with the archive manager (just right click the deb's in your GUI and you should see it). Look at the DEBIAN/control file to see what dependencies it has. Then you can try to install just the dependencies you need. If you get an error message about dependencies when you are installing a dependency you may need to recurse.\nGimp is so complex that you may have to take your system somewhere that has an Internet connection, unfortunately. Gimp spawned the toolkit library gtk that is used all across gnome GUI programs (many, many Ubuntu GUI programs). Fortunately, all the basic ones should already be part of your system if you are working on an Ubuntu desktop system.\n", "Q: How do I find my firewall is blocking mysql? I'm very new to Ubuntu.

I have searched for the solution in forums and tried the recommended solutions given in the following link, but they did not work.\nPlease help to solve this problem, can I disable the EFI boot option from Ubuntu?\n\nA: Edit your /etc/fstab file and comment out or remove the entry for /boot/efi; that should do away with the error message. You're now booting Ubuntu in BIOS mode, not in EFI mode, so you no longer need the /boot/efi partition. (That partition is the \"FAT32 boot partition\" you referred to earlier, also known as the EFI System Partition, or ESP.)\nThat said, my suspicion is that you're booting Windows in EFI mode. If so, you'll probably need to use your firmware's boot manager to select which OS to boot. That might or might not be convenient. If you prefer to use something else (GRUB Legacy, GRUB 2, rEFIt, rEFInd, or whatever), you'll need to get EFI booting working again for Linux. By deleting the ESP and re-creating a fresh one, you also deleted the EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. The fix you followed was the hard way to do it; the easy way was to boot into EFI mode (using the Ubuntu installer, say) and use the efibootmgr program to add the Linux EFI boot loader (probably GRUB 2) back to the NVRAM options. You can still do this, but you'll have to uninstall grub-pc and re-install grub-efi. This will entail jumping through a number of hoops. Alternatively, you could switch to something else, such as GRUB Legacy, ELILO, or the kernel's EFI stub loader (if you're using a 3.3.0 or later kernel). See my Web page on EFI boot loaders for much more information on these options. Overall, if you're happy selecting your OS the way you're doing it now, it's probably easier to stick to that method, at least in the short term.\n", "Q: Does Accomplishments work in Lubuntu?

Please, if anyone is able, help me to get this solved before my classes start again.\nOutput of \"less syslog | grep etwork | pastebinit is available here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1141667/\nThank you\nJake\n\nA: I'm facing the same problem and haven't got to a full solution yet, but I have a workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Let computer boot without network configuration, then after you log in, run terminal and run the following command: sudo service network-manager restart\n\n\nIf I find a permanent solution, I'll post it here.

I hope it helps.\n\nA: I was able to reproduce this situation by adding \"auto ie0\" to /etc/network/interfaces. Wireless wouldn't come up, and I got the boot messages you mention.\nWhen this is in place you are telling the system not to come up all the way until this interface is up and configured. After a couple minutes there is a failsafe mechanism to cause this not to stop the system from coming up at all, but networking can't be fully initiated, and the network manager can't be started, until all of the interfaces specified as \"auto\" are up. The system thinks you need each of those networks in order to boot the system (using NFS, for example). Just specifying the configuration stanza, without even specifying \"auto ie0\" is enough to cause this situation in older Ubuntu versions due to a bug.\nI assume some people specify this in a attempt to set a static IP address or other special configuration without using the network-manager.\nA work-around I got to work is to issue the command:\nsudo initctl emit --no-wait static-network-up\n\nwhich simulates the network interfaces coming all the way up.\nNevertheless, if you instead remove the 'auto ie0' and configure your Ethernet interface with network manager you can eliminate the long wait at boot time, too.\n", "Q: Update Manager shows '2 updates have been selected' when there are no updates The Update Manager is showing '2 updates have been selected' and that 4.1mb will be downloaded.\nIn the info box, no updates are shown.\nWhen I click 'Install Updates', the installing updates box opens and closes immediately and  it shows the progress bar as it shows after it's done refreshing the sources.\n\nI did 'sudo apt-get upgrade' in the terminal and it shows that no updates are available.\nWhat's the deal?\nReading package lists...

(The OP figured this out, but accepted this answer,  so I've augmented it to include this for the benefit of others experiencing this problem.)\nFixing Ownership\nsudo eclipse runs Eclipse as root, but it still uses your (that is, not root's) home directory to save its files. Since it runs as root, files it creates are owned by root, and users other than root cannot access them. The result is that if you've run sudo eclipse once, Eclipse can only be run via sudo eclipse afterwards, until the problem is fixed.\nThis is not actually a permissions problem, it is an ownership problem, and the solution is to retake ownership on the affected files and folders. It's usually safe to be the owner of all the files inside your home folder. So, with Eclipse not running, run this command:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~\n\n$USER will be expanded by the shell to your username, so you can run that command exactly as-is. Alternatively, if you want to replace $USER with your actual username (in this case, engine), that works too.\nHow that command works:\n\n\n*\n\n*chown is the command for changing ownership on files and directories.\n\n*~ is shell shorthand for your home directory.\n\n*-R means it's not just changing ownership of your home directory, but that the operation is to apply recursively, to all files contained anywhere within your home directory. \n\n*The first $USER means you will be the owner of the files. The second $USER (after the :) means your user's group (the group created with your user account, to be the default group-owner of your files) will be the group owner.\n\n\nFor future reference:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you must run a graphical application as root, you should use a graphical sudo frontend like gksu/gksudo or kdesudo. This sets the $HOME environment variable to /root--root's home directory. (It also makes a copy of ~/.Xauthority.)\n\n*However, it's best not to run complex applications like Eclipse or Firefox as root at all, for security reasons. Some graphical utilities must run as root to work, but Eclipse is not an administration tool, and you should never need to run it as root. If you do, something is wrong.\n\n\nFixing Location\nAs @Engine wrote:\n\nThe problem wasn't the whole directory, but only the folder /tools in\n  android-sdks. I copied it from the root folder and then I gave my\n  user the ownerships rights with:\nchown -R $USER:USER ~\n\n\nThat is to say that, when eclipse had been run as root, it had (at least at some point) used root's home directory (not the user's home directory), and the Android SDK had been stored inside root's home directory.\n\n\n*\n\n*Either that, or the Android SDK could have been manually installed as root beforehand.\n\n\nFor the benefit of others with this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*The tools folder can be copied from inside /root with:\nsudo cp -R /root/android-sdks/tools ~/android-sdks/\n\n\n*Or you can move the tools folder (rather than copying) with:\nsudo mv /root/android-sdks/tools ~/android-sdks/\n\nThen fix ownership as described above. Or, just for the relocated tools folder, with:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/android-sdks/tools\n\n\nA: Yes, I know this issue.\nCheck/change permissions for the folder.

Now I am wondering, whethe should I change every use of that, or is it just the same function?\nThey appear to work the same now, but maybe there will be some misleading differences later, I just want to know.\n\nA: eval $(cat ...) doesn't work in all cases. For example line breaks are converted to a single space by $(cat ...) before the content is processed by eval. This often breaks multi line statements like loops and here documents.\nTry for example the following file with both methods:\nfor i in 1 2 3; do\n echo $i\ndone\n\ncat<<EOF\na\nb\nc\nEOF\n\n\nA: As already mentioned by @glennjackman, you'll want to quote the command substitution, else word splitting and pathname expansion will modify the content before it gets evaled. And while both will execute the commands from the file, there are differences. \n\n\n*\n\n*When you source a script, various special shell variables will be modified, mainly the BASH_SOURCE, BASH_LINENO and FUNCNAME arrays. These are useful for printing error messages and debugging.\n\n*You can return from a sourced script with the return command (help return). With the eval, you won't get that effect. And similarly a RETURN trap will not be triggered for the eval.\n\n*When sourcing a script, you can pass arguments to it. You can't do that with that eval.\n\n*With the eval, the command substitution will read the entire content of the file into memory before passing it on to eval. When you source it, bash will read from the file as it goes.\n\nA: There's a nice summary of what source, eval and exec do here: \nhttp://www.unix.com/shell-programming-scripting/54347-bash-shell-exec-eval-source-looking-help-understand.html \nI'd think your use of eval and source'ing the file will do the same thing. I'm not completely sure, though, that variables inside the subscript will behave the same in any case. I'd recommend using source if possible, because it's the more straightforward way to go and makes your code more readable. \n", "Q: Install a 'recommended' package when user asks for corresponding action Let's say that I am building an application to a DEB package, which has as recommended dependency a package, let's call it package1.\nSo, package1, if installed, can provide extra functionality to my program, but not directly related to my program's basic functionality (that's why it is a recommended package)\nSo, the user doesn't choose initially to install the recommended package (in Ubuntu Software Center you can choose by ticking/unticking to install or not to install the recommended packages), but in the future, while using my application, it asks for the corresponding functionality.\nWhat is the best way to tell him that an extra package has to be installed in order for this functionality to work? What program can I use so as to install this package directly from my program with a dialog indicating how the installation process is going?\nI want to do this via the default way, and, preferably a way that is Linux Desktop Environment independent.\nIn short, I want a way to install a package from my program neither by opening Ubuntu Software Center (via an apt:// URL) nor by doing it at the background.\nIdeally, it would be a dialog like the one that is used by the Update Manager (or, for the ones that remember, from the Synaptic Package Manager).\nPS: I would prefer something that could be implemented using C++ !\n\nA: If you're using python, python-aptdaemon-gtk is probably the way to go.

See man session-installer, and https://launchpad.net/sessioninstaller\nYou could also use the command xdg-open apt://package: it will open the default package manager with the possibility to install your package (ubuntu software center in recent releases).\n\nA: This is an old question but I've found the answer, which is apturl.\nIt works as follows:\napturl apt:packagename and it is exactly what I need and what nautilus uses!\nImportantly, it is available pre-installed on many linux distros :)\n", "Q: Can't right click on an HP Pavilion dv6 After installing, I initially assumed that right-clicking just wasn't a feature.  I've been trying to separate myself from what I'm accustomed to in Windows, so I didn't think much of it.  I've since read that right-clicking is definitely something other people are able to do. \nHowever, right-clicks, in any context, are behaving as left-clicks.  I'm using the touch-pad on an HP Pavilion dv6 laptop.  Did something go wrong with my installation?  Maybe a driver issue?  I've tried quite a few Google searches on the issue, and I haven't come up with any results relating to a complete loss of right-mouse functionality.\nI have read that Shift+F10 is the default keyboard shortcut for right-clicking.  However, I am finding that it has no noticeable effect whatsoever when used.\nI've checked System Settings, and I don't see anything that allows for toggling the right touch-pad button on or off.  Lacking experience with the system, I don't really know where to look next.\nMy questions then, would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Am I crazy, or does 12.04 normally have a right-click function that brings up a menu pane?\n\n*Is this a problem that anyone has heard of or encountered previously?\n\n*If so, how has it been resolved in the past?\n\n*My buttons are indeed part of a click-pad.\n\n\nI checked some of the \"related\" links that showed up with the page.  I checked \nsynclient -l and found that quite a few parameters were questionably set at 0.\n RightButtonAreaLeft = 0\n RightButtonAreaRight = 0\n RightButtonAreaTop = 0\n RightButtonAreaBottom = 0\n\nThe same goes for the MiddleButtonX parameters, but I'm not concerned about those.\nClickPad = 1\n\nAll of the AreaXEdge parameters = 0\nAt the top of the list, these four parameters stand out:\nLeftEdge = 1766\nRightEdge = 5378\nTopEdge = 1627\nBottomEdge = 4331\n\nI haven't tried to adjust these before.  I imagine that it could easily vary a great deal between click-pad models, but does anyone know which of the above parameters I actually want to adjust, and to what values?\n\nA: So, I'm not sure what the original problem was, and I'm not entirely sure how my pad is mapped.\nThat said, I found an interesting work-around here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics#Buttonless_TouchPads_.28aka_ClickPads.29\nIt mentioned changing some options within /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.conf, but that directory doesn't seem to exist for me.  It suggested changing certain values for the percentage of the click-pad to be dedicated to a given button, and then it suggested checking certain parameters within synclient -l.  I wound up just manually editing the parameters to match.  The boundaries do not seem to match perfectly with the lines marked on my click-pad, but those are completely arbitrary.  The differences could be resolved by trial and error if it became an issue, I suppose.\nShift+F10 still does not work, but I have since learned that right-click was simply mapped elsewhere.  I don't know where to find the default settings for that particular shortcut; it is not included in the list shown by holding down Super.  However, I have learned that it was mapped by default to a button between my right alt and ctrl keys.  The key resembles the usual menu, with one bar highlighted.  This probably won't be relevant to many folks on non-HP machines.\nThanks, everyone, for taking the time to work with me.\n\nA: I have an HP Pavilion dv7 and I notice that when all the RightButtonArea[Top/Bottom/Left/Right] parameters are 0, my right mouse button doesn't work (or more accurately it behaves the same as the left button).  This recently started (perhaps when I installed ccsm).  This is fixed for me by the following terminal commands synclient RightButtonAreaLeft=3572 and synclient RightButtonAreaTop=3984 (which were the defaults when I first installed 12.04).  For some reason, putting these values in /etc/X11/xorg.conf and /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf isn't making the changes permanent on my system.  I had to make a simple script with the above synclient commands in it that runs at system startup.  This question has a lot of info but nothing worked for me except a startup script.\n\nA: Does your laptop have \"real\" buttons or is it a click-pad?

Usually not what you want. \nYou may want to use setgid on the directory using chmod g+s. This way, when someone changes a file, the group ownership will stay the same.

You won't actually see swap being used util processes actually need more space.

In my case was solution very simply.  Centerbox and subwoofer output was muted only (this was the default state after Ubuntu 12.04 installation). That's why I don't get centerbox and subwoofer output when I click to the test buttons. \nOpen Terminal and run the command alsamixer. Find your SB card (key F6) and check if the columns “Surround” and “Center/L” are set to OO (MM = mute). It has to be set to OO if you want to hear output.

I have a system where all the partitions (/, /home, and swap) are encrypted except for /boot. /boot resides in an external device which also contains a set of encrypted key files used to automatically decrypt all of the partitions. In other words, my desired end result was to have 2-factor authentication using an external device and a password where the password would be entered once during boot and the boot scripts would use the password to decrypt all of the partitions.\nI'm a newbie to Ubuntu (and Linux in general), but I did some trial and error modifying the various scripts found in initrd.img using update-initramfs. The cryptroot script seemed to be doing all the work mounting the partitions at first, but after some experimenting, it appears that it is only responsible for decrypting the root file system. I had modified a string in the script changing Enter the passphrase to simply Password, which appeared to work when decrypting the root file system, but used the old prompt again for decrypting the next partition. In other words, this is what I'm getting:\n\n\n*\n\n*cryptroot script loads.\n\n*The script asks for a password to decrypt the key partition and mounts it.\n\n*The script calls the setup_mapping function to decrypt the root file system.\n\n*The script tries to read the key file from the key partition to decrypt the root file system.\n\n*The root file system is decrypted and mounted.\n\n*The system prompts to enter a passphrase to decrypt the next partition…\n\n\nI think Ubuntu might be running another copy of the cryptroot script somewhere to decrypt all the other partitions after root, but I don't know what else to modify.\n\nA: First, find out where cryptroot is, what package provides cryptroot, and what else (source, documentation, examples, ...) is in the package.

It can be found by searching the Intel Download Center for the filename or the string \"Linux* PowerVR Graphics/Media Drivers\". The download page links to the file, release notes and a link, Enabling hardware accelerated playback that takes one to a page containing links to two pdf documents titled \"Enabling Hardware Accelerated Playback for Intel® AtomTM Processor N2000/D2000 Series\", one for Ubuntu and one for Fedora.\nThe instruction and release notes speak to working with kernel 3.1.0 and since I do not feel I have the skills, knowledge or training to do anything else but, follow the instructions to the \"T\", I am very reluctant to try anything on my freshly updated 3.2.0 kernel. I would much rather use a Ubuntu supported kernel that applies these drivers and doesn't break anything in the process. Is it a case where this is so new that Canonical has not yet included these drivers but, soon will do so?\n\nA: I can't provide a specific answer to your question, but LTS-versions of Ubuntu will get newer kernels from time to time. I think the idea is that new installs will automatically use the newest kernel, while installing updates will not automatically switch. You'll then have to install the new kernel from the archives. \nThe first \"dot release\" (similar to service packs) of 12.04 is scheduled for August 23. I don't know if that will get a kernel upgrade or if that'll wait until 12.04.2 (January 31).

I've giver her a separate user account.  Is there a way to make my folder not show up or be password protected for her username?  I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 with a gnome classic desktop.  I'm not worried about her going through terminal, I just want to hide those files or that folder in her session.\n\nA: Yes, you can do that by changing the permissions on the file(s) so that they are not readable by \"others\" (sometimes called world or public). \nRight-click in Nautllus, go to the Permissions tab, and uncheck all three (read, write and execute) under the Others section. \nFrom the terminal, you can also use chmod to accomplish this, setting permissions to 640 for regulat files and 750 for any binaries. \n", "Q: Can't burn ISO to CD I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS which was installed with WUBI.\nMy Windows became corrupt, so I need a installation CD to repair it. I downloaded the ISO image and took 'Open with Brasero' (I also tried 'Write to Disk'). The Burning Process get completed (That's what I think) and the window shows 100% Completed. But a process is still going on saying 'creating image checksum'. It shows no progress although the window is not frozen.\nEither please instruct a way to fix this or recommend a good software that burns ISO image to CD without fail. Or you could tell me if there is a software for burning it into a USB Flash Drive WITHOUT needing to format it.\n\nA: Use k3b, which is very powerful and easy to use burner. Also you can make your usb flash drive as a installation media. But for that you  need to format(not manually, apps will) your flash drive. UnetBootin is a application(in ubuntu repositories) by which you can use your flash drive as a bootable device.\n", "Q: How to install VMware Workstation in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I get VMware Workstation 8.0.4 working on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit? \n\nI am totally new to a Unix/Linux based OS.

Help much appreciated but much detail needed as I am newbie to Linux, the terminal and Wine.\n\nA: You need to use the full Linux path\nWine does not find executables using the drives you enter into Winecfg.\nIn order to execute your files from the command line, you need to find their path in Linux.\n\nFor example, if the file is on your CDROM, you need to use wine /cdrom/setup.exe in the commandline.\nWhy Winecfg allows you to add executables\nThe reason for this is because some applications need \"workarounds\" or native dlls in order to run on Linux via Wine.\n\nOnly add applications here if they need a library override.\nWinecfg allows you to add these applications so that you can configure their requirements easily, but it does not mean that Wine will automatically find the files when you type \"wine appnamegoeshere.exe\".\nHow Wine Finds executables\nMuch like Windows, Wine only finds files automatically if they are in the \"system folders\". These include C:\\, C:\\Windows, and C:\\Windows\\System32 (and a few others).\n\nNote: These are drive mappings, and do not make executables and files automatically visible to Wine\nAdding D:\\ to the list of drives does not make executables automatically visible to Wine. Instead, what it does, is make it easier for applications (and you) to find files as you would on Windows, using Drive Letters and the usual path format from Windows.\n", "Q: Can I change Synapse shortcut to Super/Windows key alone? When I try to edit the synapse config it does not allow me to use the left Super as a shortcut to invoke it. Is there a round-about way that I can go through.\n\nWhen I just press the Windows/Super key the configuration window does not acknowledge it. However, a combination shortcut (such as Super+A) does work fine.\nSince I'm using Precise, with Unity, I'd also need a way to change the default dash behaviour for Windows/Super key to something else.\n\nA: \nSee better answer below this one.\n\nYou must bind the action to the Super's scancode or keycode; normal hotkeys record the state of the modifier keys and throw away their keypress events; so you never see something that reacts to just pressing Alt, but instead to the A key plus the Alt key's recorded state.\nThe hotkey library in use is libgtkhotkey (0.2 on 12.04) and it doesn't support using the key press event from modifier's. You'd have to write your own patch to catch that and perhaps support such a thing in the signature format.\nAll tests with the existing signature format failed to produce anything but an error.\n\nA: A temporary workaround is to remove the modifier from super and remap the key to a \"normal key\" you do not use. I choose \"µ\", which is named \"mu\".\nxmodmap -e 'keysym Super_L = mu mu mu'\nxmodmap -e 'clear Mod4'\nThe first command will pretty much make super useless for anything else than typing \"µ\" and the second command will clear all Mod4 modifiers (I do not use them anyway). Use xev to find the name of a key, look for a line similar to:\nstate 0x80, keycode 58 (keysym 0xb5, mu), same_screen YES,\n\nThe changes will be lost after logging out. To make them permanent, add the commands to your .bashrc OR create a file named .Xmodmap in your home directory with the content:\nkeysym Super_L = mu mu mu\n\nclear Mod4\n\nIf you mess up while playing around with xmodmap, just log out and log back in again to restore your old settings. \nI've only tested with this one key, and I can still type µ by pressing Alt Gr + M without having Synapse pop up. I also tried remapping Super to Page Up;  Synapse was able to detect the key while entering it in the settings, but failed to open the launcher when pressing it.  \n\nA: Apparently ~/.config/synapse/ doesn't exist anymore.\nI just installed synapse on XUBUNTU 12.04.02 and changing the Signature entry in \n~/.config/hotkeys/synapse/synapse.hotkeys \nwas enough to have synapse pop up with a single hit on the Super-key.\n\nA: I know this is a little old now but thought solution by be useful anyway.\nFirst remove any super key bindings e.g. <super>+p is a common one for screen settings\nThen close Synapse\nIn        ~/.config/hotkeys/synapse.hotkeys\nchange\nSignature=<Control>space\n\nto\nSignature=Super_L\n\nRelaunch Synapse\n\nA: In later versions of synapse installed from the launchpad ppa the setting is in .config/synapse/config.json. Edit it while synapse is closed to specify Super_L as activation key.\n{\n  \"ui\" : {\n    \"shortcuts\" : {\n      \"activate\" : \"Super_L\",\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNote: In some environments the key should be specified as \"Super\".\nSee https://launchpad.net/~synapse-core/+archive/ubuntu/testing.\n\nA: You can assign it the super key shortcut via Settings Manager->Keyboard->Application Shortcuts tab\nadd synapse\nthen set its shortcut as super key.\nWish you good luck! \n", "Q: Ubuntu preinstalled laptop: How to change the default search engine and home page in Firefox? I have a new Dell Ubuntu pre-installed laptop. It came with 11.10 and I've just upgraded it to 12.04 (Precise).\nFirefox has its homepage set to Yahoo search and the default search engine is Yahoo too. I want to change the home page and the default search engine. Every time I change this, the settings do not stick until the next time I start the browser again.\nThere don't seem to be any such settings that I can change in Edit->Preferences. (It does not stick until the next startup of the browser if I change the homepage in the Preferences/General tab).\n\nA: Change the Home Page to about:home in Edit -> Preferences -> General. If you want the home page to some other website, you can change it likewise.\n\n\nTo change the default search engine, Type about:config in the URL bar in Firefox. Accept the warning.\nChange the value of browser.search.defaultenginename to Google. The capital letter on Google is important.\n\nA: I just found the fix. The Dell preinstalled Ubuntu comes with a package called yahoo-default-settings. This is a locally installed package and does not seem to be present in a repository (neither in Ubuntu official repository nor Dell partner repository).\nJust uninstall the package. Then, one can change the defaults and it sticks till the next start of the browser.\n\nA: In my case package was named yahoo-browser-defaults, so I had to \nsudo dpkg --remove yahoo-browser-defaults\n\n(inside this package there was /usr/share/xul-ext/ubufox/defaults/preferences/001yahoo-defaults-dell.js file and in general /usr/share/xul-ext/ubufox/defaults/preferences/ directory is the one to check in case of such problems)\n", "Q: Where can I find the Ubuntu kernel changelogs? \nPossible Duplicate:\nFinding Kernel ChangeLog for Ubuntu Kernels \n\nI was wondering if there was a specific source that posted Ubuntu's changelogs for their kernel releases.

What purpose does that serve?\nAre documents in that folder accessible to all users on the same computer?\nWhat are the default permissions on that folder?\n\nA: The folder is used for sharing files publicly, so your files won't be exposed.\n\nThis folder isn’t shared by default, but you can easily set up several\n  different types of file-sharing to easily share files on your local\n  network.\nThis folder was originally meant for the Personal File Sharing tool,\n  which is no longer included with Ubuntu by default. You can install\n  the Personal File Sharing tool or use Ubuntu’s built-in file-sharing\n  feature to share files.\nThe Personal File Sharing tool – also known as gnome-user-share – was\n  the original reason for the Public folder. It uses Apache to offer\n  convenient WebDAV-based file sharing, but doesn’t work with Windows\n  systems.

The function it does is accomplished by a keystroke. The icon remains the same (two windows on Desktop 1) whether there are windows on other desktops.\nIs there a better workspace switcher - one that represents windows on desktops in real time?\nAlternatively, can I, and how can I turn the Workspace Switcher icon off?\n\nA: I had the same question as you because I am working on a small laptop with limited screen real estate, and I configured my touchpad to perform all of my workspace switching. I found out how to remove the icon, and it is not too involved. Please note that I am using 12.10, and this may not apply to 12.04. I am still a novice programmer and linux user, so please excuse me if I misuse any terms. Since the workspace-switcher-icon AKA the expo icon is \"baked into Unity\", you have to get the source code, alter it, and recompile it. The procedure is very similar to the one mentioned here:\nHow can I disable arbitrary default multitouch gestures in Unity?\nHere is the procedure:\nIn terminal, enter these commands:\n$ sudo apt-get build-dep unity    \n$ cd /tmp\n$ mkdir unity\n$ cd unity\n\nI used the tmp directory, but you could do it elsewhere.\nGet the Unity source code:\n$ apt-get source unity\n\nGo to the directory \"unity-6.12.0\":\n$ cd unity-6.12.0\n\nUse your text editor of choice to open \"LauncherController.cpp\"\n$ gedit /tmp/unity/unity-6.12.0/launcher/LauncherController.cpp\n\nPress Ctl+F and seach for \"workspaces\". On Line 627 there is a command\nbool wp_enabled = (workspaces > 1);\n\nChange the \"1\" to a higher number than the number of workspaces you wish to use. For instance, I want to use 3 workspaces so I changed my entry to look like this: \nbool wp_enabled = (workspaces > 4);\n\nSave and close the LauncherController.cpp file, and then build Unity:\n$ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -nc\n\nIt will take a few minutes.  Then install the modified Unity that you just built:\n$ cd ..\n$ sudo dpkg -i *deb\n\nOnce it's installed you logout and log back in. Then open CCSM, go to General>General Options>Desktop Size tab, and change your number of desktops to 1.  You should see the Workspace Switcher icon disappear from the Launcher. Now you can change your number of desktops back to the number you want to use, and the Workspace Switcher icon should remain hidden. You might be able to reboot and accomplish the same result, this is just what I did. You're done!\n\nA: Pawelki's answer regarding Compiz might work. There is no official 'Dynamic' workspace Switcher icon. \nYou can change the number of workspaces using Compiz or MyUnity or Ubuntu Tweak. Gnome 3 allows dynamic number of workspace which you might like, though Unity is great.\n\nA: To remove workspace switcher icon form Unity launcher.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install CompizConfig Settings Manager\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n*Open Unity dash > type \"compiz\" > run \"CompizConfig Settings Manager\" \n\n\n*\n\n*on the right panel click on Ubuntu Unity Plugin (it is in the Desktop group)\n\n*switch to third tab - \"Experimental\"\n\n*and uncheck \"Show 'Expo Icon' in the launcher\"\n\n\n\nA: An alternate workspace switcher? I don't know exactly what is wrong with the current one. I personally find it a ton more useful if you set expo to initiate upon moving your mouse to a corner, for me I have it set to the bottom right, and boom it goes to the workspace switcher (AKA expo) you can set that in the expo settings under the Compiz settings (CCSM) \nIf you want something more minimal like what existed in 10.04 you can try this:\n\nYou can install that by running these codes in terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:geod/ppa-geod\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-workspaces\n\nThen run the program from the Unity dash by searching \"work spaces indicator\" and if you wish you could simply follow the instructions listed by others to disable the switcher Icon. Although it says it is for 11.04 you should have no problems using it in 12.04.\n\nI got the latter information from this website: http://www.techdrivein.com/2011/05/10-useful-application-indicators-for.html\n\nA: Install Synaptic in terminal: sudo apt-get install synaptic and there install package \"docky.\" Startup Docky in Unity-menu and now it is in bottom of display. \nIn preferences of Docky select workspace switcher and hide it automatically. \n\nA: I dont know another icon but you can turn it off. Install compiz config settings from software center, install it and open it.\nOn the left choose general then general options goto desktop size tab and set all options to 1.\nThen just wait for compiz to restart and it will be gone.\n", "Q: How can I fix missing key presses when running Ubuntu as a VM under OSX? Environment\n\n\n*\n\n*OSX 10.7.4\n\n*Mid-2010 iMac\n\n*VirtualBox 4.1.18\n\n*Ubuntu Precise Pangolin (all updates applied)\n\n\nIssue\nI have created a fresh VirtualBox vm and installed Precise from the standard desktop ISO. As a part of the install I selected the 'English UK (Mac International)' key-map. All of the keys seem to be emitting the correct character, however, for some keys a character will not be registered until I have pressed the key twice.\nFor example, the first time I press the ` key no character appears at the terminal prompt. However, the second time works.\nThis also happens for some other keys and shift combinations - ie ~ (shift + `) is also affected.\nFurther info\n\n\n*\n\n*This does not appear to be a VM issue. I installed Precise under VMware Fusion and the exact same problem seems to occur.\n\n*It isn't related to the speed that I'm typing. I can press the key, wait a couple seconds, then press it again and I get the same behaviour.\n\n*Switching to an alternative keyboard layout (English UK extended WinKeys) the problem persists for the backtick character (you must press the § key on the keyboard). Pressing the ` key emits a character () immediately. In other words the problem seems to be related to specific characters, rather than the hardware codes emitted by particular keys.\n\n\nxev output\nFirst keypress:\nKeyPress event, serial 30, synthetic NO, window 0x4a00001,\n    root 0x138, subw 0x0, time 3935772, (317,33), root:(320,141),\n    state 0x0, keycode 94 (keysym 0xfe50, dead_grave), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (60) \"`\"\n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: True\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 33, synthetic NO, window 0x4a00001,\n    root 0x138, subw 0x0, time 3935884, (317,33), root:(320,141),\n    state 0x0, keycode 94 (keysym 0xfe50, dead_grave), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (60) \"`\"\n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nSecond keypress:\nKeyPress event, serial 33, synthetic NO, window 0x4a00001,\n    root 0x138, subw 0x0, time 3939630, (317,33), root:(320,141),\n    state 0x0, keycode 94 (keysym 0xfe50, dead_grave), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (60) \"`\"\n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: True\n\nKeyPress event, serial 33, synthetic NO, window 0x4a00001,\n    root 0x138, subw 0x0, time 3939630, (317,33), root:(320,141),\n    state 0x0, keycode 0 (keysym 0x60, grave), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XmbLookupString gives 1 bytes: (60) \"`\"\n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 33, synthetic NO, window 0x4a00001,\n    root 0x138, subw 0x0, time 3939777, (317,33), root:(320,141),\n    state 0x0, keycode 94 (keysym 0xfe50, dead_grave), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (60) \"`\"\n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nThird keypress:\nKeyPress event, serial 33, synthetic NO, window 0x4a00001,\n    root 0x138, subw 0x0, time 3956078, (317,33), root:(320,141),\n    state 0x0, keycode 94 (keysym 0xfe50, dead_grave), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (60) \"`\"\n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: True\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 33, synthetic NO, window 0x4a00001,\n    root 0x138, subw 0x0, time 3956214, (317,33), root:(320,141),\n    state 0x0, keycode 94 (keysym 0xfe50, dead_grave), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (60) \"`\"\n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nThe additional \"grave\" key press only seems to be emitted every other physical key press.\n\nA: It seems that the keyboard map is incorrect for these keys.\nThe simplest solution is to make the following corrections via xmodmap:\n$ xmodmap -e 'keycode 94 = grave asciitilde'\n$ xmodmap -e 'keycode 48 = apostrophe quotedbl'\n\nTo have these modifications applied at login you can create a file called .Xmodmap in your home directory with the following contents:\nkeycode 94 = grave asciitilde\nkeycode 48 = apostrophe quotedbl\n\n\nA: Just an addendum to Johnstok's answer.  Add\nkeycode 94 = grave asciitilde\nkeycode 48 = apostrophe quotedbl\n\nto file .Xmodmap in the home direcotory and run \nxmodmap .Xmodmap\n\nFor me this did the trick, but it reverted to the old way every time I rebooted.

I read from a book where it says, the command rm deletes the inode and not the file. Which means if I delete with the rm command, then it cannot be restored. \nI'm very new to Ubuntu environment. Now my doubt is, how does the Del key works? It is not deleting the inode as far as I am concerned, because I can restore it from my Trash folder. So am I right to say that Del  key is doing a mv command to Trash folder leaving the inode unchanged? Or am I missing something here?\n\nA: Your understanding is essentially correct - the Del key as used in Nautilus (or other file manager) is NOT the same as using rm; it \"moves\" the file to Trash instead so that it can be recovered unless you Empty Trash (which is the same as rm).\nNote that even if you rm a file, the actual data is still on the disk after the inode is deleted. If you act immediately before the data is eventually overwritten, you can still recover the data using a tool such as testdisk/photorec.\n\nA: Delete just transfers the files / folders (things you have deleted) to the trash, while \"rm\" command permanently removes that thing/s from your hard disk.\nNOTE : You can still recover permanently deleted files. To \"not\" do that you will have to shred the file so that it cannot be recovered.\n\nA: To be able to permanently delete the Files... You would have to use  'srm'  ..

So far, I've installed wireshark and run the following commands:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common\nto allow members of the wireshark group (me) to access network interfaces\nsudo chmod +x /usr/bin/dumpcap\nnot sure what that does, but I think dumpcap was previously only executable by root.\nsudo usermod -aG wireshark (me)\nto add me to the wireshark group\nThis allows me to sniff network interfaces without running as root, but I still can't see the USB interfaces.\nrunning\ngksudo wireshark\nruns wireshark as root and I can see usb interfaces then.\nIs there a step I've missed to make USB sniffing possible for non-root users?

What are the important differences between fsck and chkdsk, and which command will reduce and correct the most hard disk errors?\n\nA: Apart from the link that fluteflute mentions the main difference for the end user is that chkdsk only checks the filesystems that are supported in windows, Fat32 and NTFS as the main ones.\nfsck checks, Fat32, NTFS (Via ntfs-3g), ext2, ext3, ext4, reiser, xfs and a whole bunch of other ones. doing a man fsck wil give you the details. But the thing is that fsck actually uses another program to run the check depending on the filesystem that is going to be checked, so for example, if the filesystem is ext4, then it will use fsck.ext4, if the filesystem is btrfs, then it will use fsck.btrfs.\nSo basically chkdsk is limited and optimized for ntfs while fsck is not only opened to several fylesystems but it receives far greater optimizations and features than the windows counterpart in the same time frame. And because of this, it does some quick checks and some deep checks to a filesystem depending on the actual fylesystem, error detected, flags on the fylesystem and other attributes that are active on the system.\nThe tools that look like chkdsk when the NTFS filesystem is involved are several of the ntfs-3g collections of tools that in some cases surpass what chkdsk (And even scandisk) can do, for example:\nntfsfix - Forces Windows to check NTFS at boot time  \nntfsresize - Resize an NTFS volume  \nntfsundelete - Find files that have been deleted and recover them  \nntfsdefrag - Defragment files, directories and the MFT  \nntfsck - Perform consistency checks on a volume  \n\nThis gives into some new ways of doing software recovery, maintenance, and repair. For example, in cases where a problem arises that the Windows system does not load, you could load up your Ubuntu and fix some of the problems with a quick fsck/ntfs-3g on the partition/disk. Or undelete something, defragment, etc.. Gives you an additional solution to several problems.\n", "Q: Apt-get on a virtual server with no internet I've been trying to install a GCC compiler on a Natty,10.04 64 Ubuntu server.\nI don't have an internet connection on it, I can only transfer files to it indirectly.\nI've tried mounting an image of the full DVD on it, successfully (I think)\nby doing:\nmount -o loop /tmp/ubuntu-11.04-server-amd64.iso /media/ubuntu-11.04-server-amd64\n\napt-cdrom -d=/media/ubuntu-11.04-server-amd64/ add\n\nand I updated fstab \nBut when I tried to apt-get from it (all I need is a source from which I can apt-get build essential) it still tried to connect to the internet.\nAlso, when trying to install a package by running ./configure I got:\n\n\"no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH\"\n\nHow can can I do this without a connection to the internet?\n\nA: apt-get looks in /etc/apt/sources.list for the list of locations where to get packages.\n(and possibly any files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d)\nyou added the cdrom location with the apt-cdrom command, but it seems you forgot to remove the default internetlocations\n-> make sure you have commented out all the internet locations\n\nA: In the worst case, you can install the packages one by one through dpkg. But I believe, someone will provide a better answer on apt usage.\n\nA: If you have another identical machine where you did this already (Installing GCC compiler) then it is easy. /var/cache/apt/archives/ is the path where the apt checks for the installables (*.deb). If it is not there it will try to download. So here is how I did some thing similar earlier - I had things in one of my machines and then I copied all the .deb files from that archives path to the new machines archives path.

The crontab has all the .sh files listed within it and the .sh files run the jsp files to display the announcements.\nAfter I finished updating the jsp files, I rebooted the server and ever since then the announcements have stopped running. I can run the .sh files via putty manually and they work perfectly fine so the changes I made to the jsp files are not the problem.\nI did some research before posting here and I checked the syslog for cron entries. Up until the point I rebooted my server the cron service was running as it should. Since the reboot there has been no entries in the syslog for cron. \nI've tried rebooting the server again, I also tried restarting the cron service, I also even tried stopping the service completely and starting it again with no effect. I can't figure out why the cron service would suddenly stop working as nothing to do with cron or any of the operating files were touched during the update of my server.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to why it may have stopped working?\nI'm using Ubuntu Server 11.10\n\nA: 1. Note down all the cron jobs for all users including root, for example:\nTo list the root's crontab\nsudo crontab -l\n\nTo list your crontab\ncrontab -l\n\n2. Delete the crontab complete for all users using the following\nTo delete the root's crontab\nsudo crontab -r\n\nTo delete your crontab\ncrontab -r\n\n3. Restart the system\n4. Place your jobs back into the cron (Preferably the root's cron) either by creating a text file then pointing cron to that file or manually.\nTo set up manually\nsudo crontab -e\n\nTo point cron to a text file\nsudo crontab <filename>\n\nLogically, preferably entered in the order of occurance. For example if you have a job that runs before another (in time) place that above.\nRemember that the cron file or crontab must have entries in the following format\nm h dom mon dow full path command\n\nFor example shutdown at 2:30PM ever day of week except weekends would be \n30 14 * * 2,3,4,5,6 /sbin/shutdown\n\nAnother example run a script file (test.sh - located in /usr/local/myScripts folder) every monday at 2:00AM would be\n0 2 * * 2 /usr/local/myScripts/test.sh\n\nI had the same problem with cron, once and I remember reading in a forum that we need to delete the user's cron and restart the system then recreate it.\n\nA: If your script are running from interactive terminal but not from crontab, this is typical of an environment problem.\nCron runs your programs with an almost empty environment.\nIn your crontab, try adding >/tmp/script.log 2>&1 at the end of your scripts to catch the errors in a logfile.\nYou can also try to run your script with env -i to make sure they run properly with an empty environment. (env -i /you/script.sh)\nYou may have to add some entries in the PATH environment variable.\n", "Q: How do I configure ufw to allow ssh on another port? I'm having some difficulties at the moment with my Ubuntu SSH server. The only title I could come up with summarizing my situation was too long so here is my problem:\nI recently discovered the firewall \"ufw\" command on Ubuntu, now I am trying to configure so that when I use putty to connection via SSH to my Ubuntu OS, that I could only use a very specific port number and not the default port \"22\".\nFor some reason, I am being refused access on my newly chosen port. Since I'm still new to Ubuntu and networking, I don't quite understand what's wrong, any advice?\n\nA: I guess you haven't allowed the SSH port in your ufw configuration.\nIn the case where you have not done this, the port where SSH is running is blocked by the firewall. I guess you can't have remote access to your server... \nIf you have (physical) access to your server you can open the SSH port using following command:\nsudo ufw allow <port number>/tcp \n\n", "Q: How do I set up user level restrictions on a gateway? I am aware that Ubuntu Server can be used as a gateway to allow Internet connection to a LAN.\nThen we use IP tables or other firewall settings to restrict (for example), certain websites from being accessed.\nMy question: Can this restriction be done on individual users, and if so could some please share a link or resource that I may use for this purpose?\n\nA: You can use something like iptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner 1001 to match on a local user. But this only works for users on the firewall machine.\nOver the network, your firewall needs to be able to identify which user is which. Normal Internet traffic has source and destination addresses only and are not tagged with usernames, which means that your firewall cannot differentiate between different users and so cannot block different users differently.\nSo blocking by machine is easy, but blocking by user is non-trivial without some extra mechanism in place to differentiate users.\nIf you want to block website traffic, you can do this using a web proxy server such as squid. You will need to configure your firewall to block web traffic except traffic going via squid.\nThere are various ways to configure users so that they go through the proxy, including \"web proxy auto detect\" (wpad), \"proxy.pac\", \"transparent proxying\" and manually.\nHTTP supports an extra proxy authentication step, and if you enable this then users will be prompted for a username and password when they attempt web access. Then squid will know who is who.\nFinally, there are various solutions that plug in to squid that make decisions on what is and isn't blocked; although if you just want some specific URLs blocked then you can do this in squid directly.\n"]
