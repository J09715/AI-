["Q: How to change background color in grub I use Ubuntu 12.04. I want to change grub's background color to black. I mean just background color, not background image. I can only find guides how to change the image. I tried some GUI software which had an option to change the colors, but unfortunately grub just ignored those changes.\nI hope you can help me.\n\nA: Try Grub Customizer.  If you don't have it installed, you can install it, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:adabbas/1stppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nOnce installed, and you open the applications,  go to Appearance settings, and change backgroun colour\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to allocate unallocated space of hard disk in Ubuntu 12.4 after installation How to allocate unallocated space of hard disk in Ubuntu 12.04 after installation.\nMy system is running fine with Windows and Linux.

I installed along side XP. Now I need to remove 12.10 and find a compatible linux destro which will work. Need to say that I am inexperienced in linux? Thanks for any help.\n\nA: I would not bother deleting it right now. The next time you will install a distro, simply install it over your Ubuntu 12.10 install, on the same partition. The installation process itself will erase your Ubuntu 12.10, and replace it with your new distro.\nOtherwise, you can use a program like GParted to format the partition that Ubuntu 12.10 is currently installed on, this would delete it.\n\nA: Here are the steps you need to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into your Live CD for Ubuntu\n\n*Start a Terminal session with Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Type gksudo gparted and hit Enter\n\n*Delete your Ubuntu partitions (you should have two, the main partition and swap).

But oftentimes the GUI install does not work (on anything older than about 2006, just forget about graphical installs, and I have a lot of experience trying to load Ubuntu on a P3 computer, AMD k6-2, and a AMD XP). \nI would highly recommend going here and downloading the Lubuntu Alternate ISO. That makes it so you can install from the text-based system, and I was successful in installing Xubuntu 7.10 on an ancient AMD K6-2 with 96 megs of RAM.

I like to know, what are the advantages of Mir.\n\nA: \nWhy Not Wayland / Weston?\nAn obvious clarification first: Wayland is a protocol definition that defines how a client application should talk to a compositor component. It touches areas like surface creation/destruction, graphics buffer allocation/management, input event handling and a rough prototype for the integration of shell components. However, our evaluation of the protocol definition revealed that the Wayland protocol does not meet our requirements. First, we are aiming for a more extensible input event handling that takes future developments like 3D input devices (e.g. Leap Motion) into account. Please note though that Wayland's input event handling does not suffer from the security issues introduced by X's input event handling semantics (thanks to Daniel Stone and Kristian Høgsberg for pointing this out). With respect to mobile use-cases, we think that the handling of input methods should be reflected in the display server protocol, too. As another example, we consider the shell integration parts of the protocol as privileged and we'd rather avoid having any sort of shell behavior defined in the client facing protocol.\nHowever, we still think that Wayland's attempt at standardizing the communication between clients and the display server component is very sensible and useful, but due to our different requirements we decided to go for the following architecture w.r.t. to protocol-integration:\nA protocol-agnostic inner core that is extremely well-defined, well-tested and portable.\n     An outer-shell together with a frontend-firewall that allow us to port our display server to arbitrary graphics stacks and bind it to multiple protocols. \nIn summary, we have not chosen Wayland/Weston as our basis for delivering a next-generation user experience as it does not fulfill our requirements completely. More to this, with our protocol- and platform-agnostic approach, we can make sure that we reach our goal of a consistent and beautiful user experience across platforms and device form factors. However, Wayland support could be added either by providing a Wayland-specific frontend implementation for our display server or by providing a client-side implementation of libwayland that ultimately talks to Mir. \n\nThere is a more detailed discussion here : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mir/Spec?action=show&redirect=MirSpec\nAnd from the Mir technical architect:\nhttp://samohtv.wordpress.com/2013/03/04/mir-an-outpost-envisioned-as-a-new-home/\nMore information:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://blog.cooperteam.net/2013/03/artistic-differences.html\n\n*http://blog.cooperteam.net/2013/03/mir-and-you.html\n\n*http://blog.cooperteam.net/2013/03/for-posterity.html\n\nA: Jono Bacon on his Q and A has answered this a few times. His latest answer is here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Oa2psAewtg&feature=share&t=56m36s\nFrom what I have gathered from the likes of Jono's Q&A's, and Popey's comments on Linux Unplugged, the points can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wayland does too much. Having perpetually unused features in your software stack is poor software design.\n\n*Wayland's team would not be flexible enough to offer a gutted version of Wayland to accommodate adequately, respectfully.\n\n*Mir is to Wayland, what LightDM is to GDM/KDM.\n\n*Ubuntu has very dire deadlines that they need to meet with phone manufacturers and the like. Having control over a project makes it easier to infuse extra resources to guarantee that these deadlines are met.\n\n*Although I do not think this reason ever officially came from canonical, and thus is just speculation upon my part, at the time which the decision was made, Wayland did not seem like it was moving quick enough to market, and the existing Android technology seemed like a more appropriate base to launch their product from.\n\n", "Q: Unseen process using up all the memory?

So far, I'm loving it. The writers really tried to think of everything, and have done a good job of keeping the O/S modern. Nonetheless, it is still a bit of a learning curve to me. I have some experience using a terminal from OS X, but I'm still learning my way around and how things are done. So to anyone who answers, please assume I know nothing, and explain each step.\nDuring the O/S installation, I chose to place my 'home' on a separate partition. I did this so I could use this space as portable area where I could store frequently accessed files, use it to transfer stuff between O/S's, and be able to retrieve them easily in an emergency. I formatted this partition using XFS, thinking it was an acronym for exFAT File System, an ideal cross-platform FS which supports files larger than 4GB. Doh! Turns out XFS is a somewhat obscure journaled, server FS. Also turns out 'home' likes to live in a FS that supports permissions, so that rules out exFAT anyway. OK so that was a learning experience, but now I want to move 'home' back to the partition which Ubuntu is installed on, and reformat the XFS partition to something else (decide later).\nI read a few related questions here on Ask Ubuntu, but I didn't get anywhere. Either because there were some differences in my situation or version, or I got unexpected results, or I simply didn't know what I was doing. Any help would be much appreciated.\n\n\nA: \nNote 1: The below will assume that you have a USB stick which you used to install Ubuntu, but the same goes for using a CD. So, wherever you see \"USB\", it's basically \"the media at which you made bootable with Ubuntu\".\nNote 2: Wherever you see userName in the commands, replace it with your actual username that you use in your Ubuntu.\n\nOkay, what we'll be doing is booting into live Ubuntu using a LiveUSB. So, if you still have the USB you used with Ubuntu on it, then just boot from it, as if you were going to install Ubuntu from scratch, except, we'll choose to Try Ubuntu, not install Ubuntu. This will boot up Ubuntu from the USB, so this is not your actual installed Ubuntu. [Too many \"Ubuntu's\".]\nAll of the following will be typed in a terminal. You can open one by  Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\nNote: If, at any point, you get an error, stop, and let us know.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo mkdir /media/rt\n\n*\n\n*This will create a directory called rt under /media. This will be the folder that will be housing your actual Ubuntu root partition.\n\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sda3 /media/rt\n\n*\n\n*As apparent from the command, this will mount (make accessible) /dev/sda3 (your root partition) on the folder /media/rt.\n\n*Note: if the command gives you an error about the \"file system type\", do sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sda3 /media/rt instead.\n\n\n*cd /media/rt\n\n*\n\n*This will change our working directory to that directory, which is now your Ubuntu's / partition.\n\n\n*sudo chroot --userspec=userName:userName . Don't forget, replace userName with your Ubuntu username.\n\n\n*\n\n*This...well...basically, the prompt that you see now would be the same prompt you would get if you opened a terminal in your actual Ubuntu installation. Your prompt should change to userName@hostname:$, something like that.\n\n\n*sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak\n\nNote: I'm not entirely sure if this command will ask you to enter a password. But if it does, enter your username's password. This goes for all the remaining commands.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This is taking a backup of the file fstab that we're going to edit in the following couple of steps.\n\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\n*\n\n*This will open up that fstab file, of your Ubuntu installation, in a text editor. This file is responsible for mounting the /home partition at startup when you boot up your Ubuntu. It's also responsible for mounting the / partition, so be careful with editing this file.\n\n\n*Look for the following two lines:\n# /home was on /dev/sda4 during installation\nUUID=<random-numbers> /home           ext4    defaults        0       2\n\nThey won't be exactly the same as this. You'll probably find exactly the first line, but the second line might be slightly different. It could start with /dev/sda4 instead of UUID=<random-numbers>. But essentially, what we're looking for are the lines that have /home in them.\n\n*Put a # in front of the second line of the two. So, it should look like this:\n# /home was on /dev/sda4 during installation\n#UUID=<random-numbers> /home           ext4    defaults        0       2\n\nPutting that # basically means that 'this line is a comment', so we're essentially deleting it, but we're not going to actually delete it.\n\n*Save and close the editor. This will take you back to the terminal.\n\n*ls /home. You should not see any output. If you don't see any output, continue on with the steps. If you see your username as the output (highly unlikely), go to step 13.\n\n*\n\n*This command is basically checking if you already have a home folder. You should not see any folders there because all of your /home directory was mounted on a separate partition anyways.\n\n\n*sudo mkdir /home/userName. Don't forget, replace userName with your Ubuntu username.\n\n*\n\n*This is creating a new home directory for your username. But it has incorrect ownership, so we'll fix it in a while.\n\n\n*sudo cp /etc/skel/{e*,.[a-z]*} /home/userName\n\n*\n\n*This will copy some essential files to your new home folder.\n\n\n*sudo chown -R userName:userName /home/userName\n\n\n*\n\n*This is changing the ownership of your new home folder to be you.\n\n\n\nNote: There might be an easier, one command method to accomplish steps 11, 12 and 13, but meh, I don't know of it.\n\n\n*exit\n\n*exit\nThis should close the terminal.\nAt this point, we have removed auto-mounting your /home partition, created a new home folder for your username, copied some essential files to it, and gave it the correct permissions.\nShutdown this live Ubuntu. Remove the USB stick. Boot into your Ubuntu as you normally would. Cross your fingers. You should boot normally, and find that you have a home folder with all the subdirectories (Documents, Pictures, etc.) just like you did, but now, all of this is under one partition, the root partition.\nLet's do some checks.\n\n\n*\n\n*cat /etc/fstab. Look for the # that we added to that line. It should be there.\n\n*ls -l /home. You should see something like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x 43 userName userName  4096 Jun 30 20:49 userName\nAs long as those bold words are your username, everything is good.\n\n*ls -l /home/userName. You should see all of those subdirectories created, and all of them should have your username in place of those bold words above as well.\n\n*Open GParted. You should not see /home as the mount point for that partition (/dev/sda4) like in your screenshot.\n\n\nIf all of this checks out, congratulations!\nAt this point, your other partition (the one that used to be /home) is now free for you to do whatever you want with. Open GParted, and delete it, format it, burn it, throw it out the airlock, whatever.\nPhew.\n", "Q: Is Onboard graphics enough for running Ubuntu 12.04?

Maybe the Disk Management tool also shows which partition is the boot partition.\n", "Q: Uninstall backtrack 5 dual booted with Ubuntu Some days ago I installed BackTrack over my Ubuntu installation.

I'm using this method to mute the microphone in Ubuntu 13.04, however I'm missing a visual representation that the action has taken  place and is currently in action.\nIs it possible to improve this method, or use another method, to have my microphone muted and know for sure that this has happened? A microphone indicator would be enough, probably.\n\nA: OK, I've solved it!\nI've created two shell files:\nmute_mic.sh:\nkillall notify-osd;\namixer set Capture nocap && notify-send 'Microphone ! DISABLED !'\n\nunmute_mic.sh:\nkillall notify-osd;\namixer set Capture cap && notify-send 'Microphone ! ENABLED !'\n\nThen I've simply assigned to run those two files on my desired keyboard shortcuts.\nThanks to @Wouter for finding the notify-send command!\n\nA: if you're using gnome-shell, the gnome-shell extension nothing to say, which can be installed from its extensions.gnome.org page, provides a microphone icon, mouse and keyboard control, and walkie-talkie style push-to-talk.\n\nA: Most Linux desktops already react to a special mute microphone key (that on notebooks often is accessible via some Fn + function key combination, along with volume up/down/mute). If you don't have such a key, you can map a free key to it.\nMy keyboard has a set of multimedia keys; I used xev to find out the keycode of one (163), and then remapped that to the XF86AudioMicMute target. Put the mapping in ~/.Xmodmap and activate via $ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap:\n! Map the Mail special key from my MS Natural Keyboard Pro to microphone mute.\nkeycode 163 = XF86AudioMicMute NoSymbol XF86AudioMicMute\n\nIn GNOME and Unity, the toggling of the mute state will be indicated by a big icon overlay in the middle the desktop.\n\nA: For a more recent answer in Ubuntu 20.04: open Settings -> Keyboard Shortcuts and search for \"Microphone mute/unmute\" in the list. You can then assign the shortcut you want.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.4 doesn't search for files on desktop when type a letter When I trigger show desktop action and get a clear view of the desktop, I want to do fast search for some file eg.

It is very important for me to keep my files in a safe Host. I use ubuntu one because of ease of using in Ubuntu. You think is it safe enough of spying ?\n\nA: According to the German Wikipedia and the results of Whois and GeoIP lookups, the Ubuntu One servers are located in Great Britain, which is definitely not the worst location to have servers, since it is inside EU, meaning that there are relatively strong privacy security laws in effect, and that it's a partner country grade 2 (source) of the USA, meaning it's explicitly excluded from their systematic data theft and industrial espionage (at least, officially).\nThe transmission of data to the Ubuntu One servers is done using SSL, meaning that it's reasonably secure, at least if you use the web interface and check the used security certificate (the NSA and other industrial espionage agencies have the wrong to have certificates for TLDs issued, allowing Man-In-The-Middle attacks if one doesn't check the certificate used).\nNevertheless, Ubuntu One stores files unencrypted, to enable the user to publish them over it. So, if for any reason a British court decides that Ubuntu One has to give data to the police, the police will get the files and will be able to read them without problems.\nTherefore, it is strongly recommended to encrypt any data before it gets uploaded to Ubuntu One (or any other cloud storage). You can either do this manually (for instance with gpg or openssl), or use an automated solution. Someone reported that he used encfs with Ubuntu One successfully.\n", "Q: Problem viewing network on Nautilus Windows machines are able to see shared folders on my Ubuntu machines but the Ubuntu machines cannot consistently see any other machines through Nautilus.

When I open the workgroup icon, it shows the local machine and my WIFI service again.  I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

But frequently it seems to fix the problem temporarily.  \nAs suggested in some of the posts I read, I've tried changing the workgroup name to all caps. and I added a netbios name, also all caps. to the /etc/samba/smb.conf file to no avail.  \nI can get Nautilus to see the machines if I use Connect to Server under the file menu and type the local IP address.  I can also see them if I run  \nnautilus smb://[IP address]  \n\nin the Terminal.  \nDoes anyone have any ideas?  Please help.  \nThanks.  \n\nA: This is likely a configuration issue with the file /etc/samba/smb.conf on the machine with the shared directory.

I want to keep it simple so I decided to use the Flickr account I already have configured in my system (online accounts framework).\nI have studied the Online Accounts for application developers tutorial and was able to get my Flickr account details.\nThe problem appeared when I tried to use the flickrapi module. I have tried the latest version from and as well as the version available via apt in 13.04. The API has changed a bit, but both tries ended with a message that I have an invalid oauth token.\nThis is what I have tried:\nlatest source from flickrapi hg repo\nimport flickrapi\nflickr = flickrapi.FlickrAPI(u\"d87224f0b467093b2a87fd788d950e27\", u\"4c7e48102c226509\",\n             token=flickrapi.auth.FlickrAccessToken(u\"my_token\", \n                       u\"my_token_secret\", u\"write\",\n                       u'DarGad', u'dargad', u'user_nsid'))\nflickr.test.login()\n\nwhich leads to:\nERROR:flickrapi.auth.OAuthFlickrInterface:do_request: Status code 400 received, content:\nERROR:flickrapi.auth.OAuthFlickrInterface:    oauth_problem=parameter_absent\nERROR:flickrapi.auth.OAuthFlickrInterface:    oauth_parameters_absent=oauth_token\n\nversion from apt-get (1.2-3)\nimport flickrapi\nflickr = flickrapi.FlickrAPI(\"d87224f0b467093b2a87fd788d950e27\", \"4c7e48102c226509\", \n                             token=\"my_token\")\nflickr.test_login()\n\nresults with FlickrError: Error: 98: Invalid auth token.\nI have also tried different combinations of FlickrAPI constructor flags (e.g. store_token, cache) without success.\nI have used a similar approach for Twitter (used python-twitter module from apt) and it worked perfectly with the account I already had configured.\nMy guess is the problem is with flickrapi, since the same token works with Shotwell and unity-photos-lens. I have checked their sources and none do not uses flickrapi (and Shotwell is not even in Python).\nI will appreciate any hints on making flickrapi work with the online accounts framework. Or maybe there is another Python module that works correctly with online accounts? I have also tried flickr.py and python-flickr-api but I got impression that both are outdated - no success with them either.\n\nA: Looks like I have managed to find a way after all.\nThe correct version to be used is the version from the sources. The version shipped with Ubuntu 13.04 is too old and it uses previous flickr auth API. The 2.0-beta from hg uses the new oauth API.\nThe problem was that the token provided in the FlickrAPI constructor was not passed to the internal OAuthFlickrInterface. To workaround this problem I needed to simply call:\nflickr = flickrapi.FlickrAPI(\n                             # args same as before\n                            )\nflickr.token_valid()\n\nif this method returns True we can make sure:\nrsp = flickr.test.login()\n\nThis will perform an API call to check the token, but before doing so it will pass the token object to OAuthFlickrInterface as a side effect.\nI can now use flickrapi with my Ubuntu Flickr account!\n", "Q: Unable to ping Ubuntu from Windows I'm using wireless router for internet access and local wireless network.\nWhen I ping from Ubuntu to Windows XP over a wireless LAN, it works using either IP or hostname of the Windows device.\nBut when I ping from the same Windows device to Ubuntu it doesn't work at all (neither IP nor hostname).

I'm new to linux and I've set up a web server with Ubuntu Desktop edition so I can practice with the GUI a bit before transitioning to Ubuntu Server. \nI've already set up a LAMP stack as well as FTP.

Have you heard of SCP?  SCP is just like FTP in that it is used to transfer files, but it is done over SSH, which can make it easier to administer and allows you to more securely transfer files.\nIf you decide to try SCP, you would want to add your user to the www-data group (as I imagine it has +RW access to /var/www/) and then execute the following command:\nscp ~/Projects/site/index.html user@host:/var/www/\nIf you're 100% sure you want to use FTP, please let us know which FTP daemon/server you are using to better help you configure it to your purposes.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make a fullscreen on VirtualBox?

Is there is a way to make it big?\n\nA: View -> Switch to Fullscreen Mode (or HOST+F)\nRight CTRL is normally the default HOST key.\nYou need to install the Guest Additions to be able to adjust the guest screen geometry to the host in fullscreen mode.\nHere are different instructions to install Guest Additions.\n\nA: You need to enable \"Scaled Mode\" after installing Guest addons.\nHost+C\n\nA: Once you have installed Windows Operating system go to the resolution settings by >Right Click > Screen Resolution > change to (1920 x  1080) \nIf this does not work keep trying each resolution within the Settings. You should come across one which will fit your screen. \nDon't forget to also (Auto Fit Guest) within the Virtual Machine View Settings.\n\nA: This is not a problem with Guest Additions not installing. If copy-and-paste works between your host and your VM that means Gues Additions installed ok.\nTurn off your VM. On VirtualBox VM console, select the virtual machine, go to Settings->Display and set your Graphics Controller to VMSVGA. This will fix the problem.\nAnother problem is the Linux desktop will be fine until you do a \"yum update\". Some package is being updated and once it does, the desktop icons will become huge.

You'll want to change the aspect ratio in the guest OS. In Ubuntu this can be done by clicking the downward facing arrow in the top right corner of the screen, this will open a small window in that area, click on the settings button, then go down to devices, and then display, and select a display size. The correct choice will depend on your monitor, but I selected \"1440X900(16:10)\" and that got rid of the gray borders on my computer.\n\nA: In the beginning my mouse did not fit in the virtual OS, now the mouse is working in the full screen mode.

Please note tha Wubi\n8.10 requires the Desktop 8.10 CD/ISO. The DVD and Altrenate CD/ISO will not work. You can find the 8.10 ISO here. If Wubi does not find\nan appropriate ISO/CD and/or if the ISO/CD is corrupted, it will\nautomatically download a new ISO. It is recommended to let Wubi\ndownload the ISO for you.\n\nThe Wubi website has a lot of other info., you might want to take a look at it if you still have questions.\nOne thing I would recommend it running your Disk Check utility before installing Wubi.  One of the drawbacks of Wubi is that it is sensitive to a corrupted NTFS filesystem.  Doing a diskcheck will help prevent any problems.\nNote that Windows 8 is not compatible with Wubi  To install on a Winodows 8 computer you will have to do a full install and it must be 64 bit.\n\nA: Yes, you can.

On giving cd \\, I get the > symbol while cd / changes the ~ sign in my directory to /. \nAlso ls command shows me directories like dev, root, usr in case of cd /.\n\nA: In Bash, your shell, the \\ (backslash) denotes an escape character. This should be used in cases where you want to escape characters like spaces, quotes and other characters meaningful to the shell syntax, but you want to have it propagate as data to the command you're running. By having this as the last character on the line you're escaping the newline and Bash is waiting for further input (multiple lines).\n/ is just a forward slash (meaning directory separator). With just / this means the root, so for example ls / lists the contents of the root. By changing the working directory to /, the indicator in your shell also changes from ~ (short for home directory, e.g. /home/gert/) to the directory you're in then (/).\n\nDemo\n$ touch a filename with spaces\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 gert gert 0 Jul  1 02:33 a\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 gert gert 0 Jul  1 02:33 filename\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 gert gert 0 Jul  1 02:33 spaces\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 gert gert 0 Jul  1 02:33 with\n\nOh noes, it was my intention to create one file with the name a filename with spaces. So, here we use the \\ to escape the spaces. This prevents the shell to provide four arguments to touch, but instead provide a single one with the spaces included.\ntouch a\\ filename\\ with\\ spaces\n\n$ touch a\\ filename\\ with\\ spaces\n$ ls -al\ntotal 24\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 gert gert  4096 Jul  1 02:35 .\ndrwxrwxr-x 55 gert gert 20480 Jul  1 02:33 ..\n-rw-rw-r--  1 gert gert     0 Jul  1 02:35 a filename with spaces\n\nOf course, by using quotes (touch \"a filename with spaces\") one can achieve the same thing.\nIt is also used to declare special characters like newlines:\n$ echo -e \"bla\\nnewline\" # \\n means a newline character\nbla\nnewline\n\nWe need the -e option here for echo, because as the manpage put it: -e     enable interpretation of backslash escapes.\n\nA: If you enter a backslash you can enter your comand on multiple lines. This is what the prefix '>' stands for. \n\nA: The > sign means that the prompt is waiting for you to input more, because the previous command was incomplete. You can reproduce this with anything, not just cd. Just type whateveryouwant\\, and you'll get >.\nThe part where you see the ~ denotes the current working directory. To change the working directory, you use the command cd, which means change directory (folder). So if you do cd /, it changes the directory to /. If you do cd /usr/bin, it will change to /usr/bin, and so on.\nls is a command to list what's in the current directory/folder. So, if you do cd / (meaning you've changed the directory to /), ls would list whatever files and folders in there. If you do cd /etc/ and then ls, it would list whatever files and folders that are in /etc/, and so on.\n", "Q: Data on hard drive I have a laptop that's having some is problems with windows 7 tried everything but can't get it to come up with out have the original cd this is where Ubuntu comes in I'm making the switch but I want to know since I will be booting from the cd or USB and installing it on the computer what about the old data that was originally on the hard drive will it be over written (this is what I want) or will have have to wipe the hard drive and then install Ubuntu?\n\nA: Yes. If you install on the same partition (your harddrive may be one partition) or you choose a new collection of partitions it will format those before installing (ubuntu likes to install on ext2 not ntfs). Formatting destroys data.\nThis guide says that there will be an option to replace the windows 7 and that it will delete all your programs and files\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-desktop-latest\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu, a selection screen will eventually come up asking you how you would like to install it. One of these options is to wipe the disk and install (or something like that). This will completely remove all data and install Ubuntu in place.\nSo, yes, all the old data that was originally on the hard drive will be overwritten.\n", "Q: .htaccess causes 403 error I have a working website on a free shared server. I decided to hire a dedicated server and purchase a domain for my website.

If you start your PC with the CD and it comes up fine then that confirms that the PC is OK but the graphics driver must be updated.\nRestart the PC without the CD which will give you the dead screen. Cut the power and start again but be prepared to hit the down arrow key as soon as the boot options screen shows up. Choose the fail safe startup to get the PC up and runing with basic graphics.\nFind the icon for additional hardware (look like a circuitboard) and update the graphics driver. You will probably have to accept a driver from the graphics board maker but at least its free.\nOnce updated you can restart and adjust the graphics resolution.\nDon't give up.\nPS.

(I know I can use Alt+F1.)\nWhat should I modify to get this completely uninstalled?  I cannot find anything in the rc2.d directory.\n\nA: sudo apt-get remove does not remove the configuration files, but since you already removed the packages you cannot purge the config files. Your best bet is to reinstall the same packages then purge them, thus removing all configuration files.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg xfonts* gnome gdm\nsudo apt-get purge xserver-xorg xfonts* gnome gdm\n\n\nA: While as Scott Goodgame says apt-get purge can only purge packages that are installed, dpkg -P does not have this limitation. So there's no need to reinstall a package for the purpose of re-uninstalling it with the purge action.\nThose skeptical that dpkg has this ability can test it out, perhaps by installing, removing, and dpkg -P-purging a package rarely present on desktop systems, with configuration files but minimal dependencies, such as gamin.\nTo remove the packages' systemwide configuration files (this will also uninstall the packages if they're still installed, this acting like sudo apt-get purge ... in that case), run:\nsudo dpkg -P xserver-xorg `dpkg-query -f '${binary:Package} ' -W xfonts\\*` gnome gdm\napt-get matches regular expressions like xfonts*, but dpkg doesn't, which is the reason for the italicized backticked expression.\nAs a secondary matter, you might be surprised to learn apt-get interprets xfonts* as a regexp. If xfonts* were expanded with shell-like expansion, it would match all names starting with xfonts. Since it's expanded as a regexp instead, it matches all names with xfont (not xfonts, xfont) anywhere in them, including packages like fonts-ipaexfont-gothic. This is because, in regular expressions, x* means \"zero or more xes.\" The pattern you probably want is ^xfonts, which matches xfonts at the beginning of a package name (or of a line, in the general use case).\n", "Q: Problem with MTP device World.\nHow may I connect a MTP device on Ubuntu 12.04?\nWhen I try to connect to transfer some music, an error message appears on the display.

Similarly, w (lower) will be activated both by pressing w (with CL off) and SHIFT+w (with CL on). This because keystrokes are internally treated as characters, which makes an upper W produced with SHIFT indistinguishable by one entered with CL.\nmupdf doesn't watch if a file changes.

I tried to copy a large file from one partition to another and got a read error, so I ran badblocks. It reported somewhere around 250 bad blocks, if I remember correctly. My first reaction was \"Oh, guess I need a new hard drive\", but it's not my boot partition, and the system is running just fine. It is, however, the same physical device as my boot drive.\nThere's nothing life shattering if I lose it, but it'd be an annoyance. \nI figure this is either a pretty ominous sign that the drive will utterly fail soon, or that I just need to run something to move the data and mark those blocks out?\nWhat command or app would best help me further diagnose / fix the problem?\n\nA: If your concerned about your HD the run disk utility you can find it in the dash. \nClick on the button to check the disk and allow it to run all tests, it can take a long time, 30+ minutes is reasonable.\nAt the end of the tests it should tell you if you hard disk is failing. Not sure if 250 bad blocks is critical, it may be that that part of the disk is just at the end of it's write life, the rest of the disk may be fine, see what the disk utility tells you for the best idea. \nHere are some screen shots to help you out.\n\nFirst select your hard disk from the tree on the left and then you will see the info on the disk.  The area circled is the overview of the disk that is made just by it running, first look to see if you have the green light and it says the disk is healthy.  Then you can click on the SMARTData button and it will give you detailed info.\n\nThe lower part of the window gives you the running info that is used to determine if the disk is healthy, any bad part will give you a red light.  The rest of the window is rather self explanatory but if you click on the Run Self-test button it will give you the option to run the disk check.  When you click on it a window will pop up asking you what kind of test to run.  Selecting the Extended test will run the full test.  As I said earlier expect it to take 30+ minutes, it will give you a running commentary on what it is doing but it is not that exciting to watch. \nWhile it is possible to use the computer while it it working it will slow down the tests and all your programs will start much slower, browsing the internet should not be a problem as long as you are not using the offline cache, i.e. use a private browsing window so that the web pages are only stored in your RAM.  This may not be possible if you have a weak processor or very limited RAM without slowing down the computer.\nAfter you let the test run you should see the results and if it tell you the disk is failing you might want to get a new disk and clone your old one.  There are many questions here on how to make a complete copy of your hard disk so just do a search and see which ones seem the most helpful to you; I will not get into it here as I only know how to do it in theory from reading the answer on askubuntu.\nIncidentally as you can see on the second screenshot there is a box that you can check  to stop the disk utility from notifying you that the disk is failing if you leave that unchecked it will give you a notice that \"Disk failure is imminent\"  if it see some critical problem, I'm not sure when it will do this, I think during the boot process, I've not had that unfortunate message come up yet.\n\nA: Do NOT run these commands on a mounted or live filesystem! You can do serious damage to your Ubuntu installation. Instead, maxe sure you boot using a LiveCD and select \"Try Ubuntu\".\nMake sure you have a backup of your data. Just in case.\nOpen a terminal window and identify the hardrive you want to scan using:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nI'll assume that the partition you need checked is /dev/sda1. Perform a filesystem check to find (and fix) disk errors on /dev/sda1:\nsudo fsck -y /dev/sda1\n\nThe -y flag tells the check to automatically fix errors it encounters.\nOnce the scan is complete, you can exit the Live Session and reboot.\n", "Q: Why are mysterious jpg files being created in my home folder?

Actually one of these, was started by me. After inputs from others I have successfully printed using Canon LBP6000 from my Ubuntu machine for around a year. If it failed to print, restarting the daemon using this homemade script coaxed the printer to print.\n#!/bin/bash\n\npkill -9 -x ccpd\npkill -9 -x captmoncnabc\n/etc/init.d/ccpd start\n/etc/init.d/ccpd status\n\nRecently, I am not successful any more, or successful on a limited and sporadic basis.\nSometimes it prints when turned on after logging in, sometimes when the driver is reinstalled. I keep on trying the random steps (call abracadabras) until I get success. Again, not always success comes. I frustrate on for hours only to get  single page printed. I loose precious time on the issue of printing.\nI have read and read all the documents available over the Internet.\nHowever, if you please notice, none of the guides, articles, tutorials (these are too many to list here) seem to be dealing with diagnosing the problem when it fails to print. They tell you where to find the drivers, how to install them, or which script to run to make the installation process automatic.\nYes, some of the articles or comments suggest a step to try, without any systematic order. But these fail to suggest a step based on symptoms, mostly.\nThis morning, my Canon LBP6000 failed to print. After sometime, there was a message for system error, details of which was found to be something like this.\n\nWhen I search for this error (c3pldrv crashed with SIGSEGV in write ()), I find a number of articles including this one. None of these are actually helpful. Mostly, these are 'me too', 'tell me if you find anything'.\nRunning captstatusui -P LBP6000 produced this,\n\nYes, the printer is connected and actually turned on.\nI believe that there are a number of frustrated Canon printer users out there like me. But there is not a step by step definitive guide to systematically diagnose a non-printing printer.\nDo you think that you can provide your diagnosing inputs so that a systematic document can be built?\nMay be we will want the Ubuntu users to stay away from Canon printers. But as I believe, as a Linux user for more than fifteen years, such a scenario is not acceptable any more. May be this was acceptable in the infancy days of Linux, but not today.\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04, by the way, I prefer LTS versions.\n\nA: This is not simply a \"me too\" post.  I have been researching for a year and a half, in detail, how to make my Canon ImageClass D420 laserjet all-in-one work with Linux.  Bottom line -   Try the latest drivers (2.7 - June 2013) from Canon then sell your Canon and buy something that works!  If time is money, and you value either one, sell it sooner rather than later.\nI started out with Ubuntu 12.04 (64-bit) only to find that almost no one had succeeded in getting many of the Canon Laserjets to work.  I kept at it with countless hours of research and eventually got the printer to work on a very marginal basis.  I apologize that much of that 64-bit knowledge was \"dumped\" or became dated with semi-annual upgrades as I ventured into Mint Mate (Xfce desktop) with 12.10 and Xubuntu (Xfce desktop) for 13.04.  But the same issues with Canon drivers persisted.  During June '13, Canon released their 2.7 drivers.  I was pleased that my LaserJet worked right off the bat (as well as it ever did).  However, I still needed to shut off the power to the printer between print jobs to get it to work.\nSince so many users encountered most of their problems with 64-bit versions, I decided to go with 32-bit Xubuntu (excellent!) for 13.10. This download from Canon (look for your specific model) includes .deb files for:\ncndrvcups-ufr2-us_2.70-1_i386.deb and\ncndrvcups-common_2.70-1_i386.deb \nI think the common file needs to be installed before the ufr2 (if it doesn't work one way try the other).  Next, printer settings have to be set to recognize both your printer and the connection, not as easy as one would think.\nMy settings:\nDescription: Canon D400-450 (UFRII LT)\nConnection:  usb://Canon/D400-450%20(UFRII%20LT)?serial=SJ3026\nDevice URI:  Canon D400-450 ver.2.7\nAfter a lot of tinkering, sweat, cursing and time, the Canon doesn't work any better than it did with my first frustrating experience a year and a half ago and three separate Ubuntu installations later.  Yes, I can print some of the time - if I shut it off between print jobs.  I have great difficulty printing .pdf files from my browser or email.  I can work around this (most of the time) by printing to file first - then printing the .pdf from my local file.  However, just today, I printed a 30 page .pdf document. It printed 30 pages of solid black!  Never did get it to print correctly using all my tricks.  After giving up on it and trying to print a USPS mailing lable, I noticed my CPU indicator was PEGGED and task manager told me 'C3pldrv' was using 90% of the CPU capacity.  After closing all programs and rebooting everything was fine - and the printer spit out my mailing label without being prompted.\nThe bottom line of four installations and tons of research is that the Canon LaserJets and all-in-ones should be avoided like the plague.  But then, you wouldn't be reading this had you bought something else.  And that is just the printer portion of this Canon.  I have had absolutely NO success with the scanner.  The Canon scanner tool does not work with this machine.  \"No devices recognized\"  I have tried so many SANE front ends back ends and upgrade tricks it has driven me in-SANE.  The one ray of hope for the scanner is to use VueScan ( a fantastic (low-riced) scanning application which was developed with Ubuntu ) with their recommendations.  I am going to try that again as I found it at a critical moment when I actually had to get some work done other than trouble shooting the Canon.  Good luck - I'll follow up with more info as I get it.\n\nA: Now (in 2016) it works well in Ubuntu, although it still took some trouble to figure out the steps. It boils down to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download UFR II/UFR II LT Printer Driver for Linux Version 3.10. One source is: http://support-asia.canon-asia.com/contents/ASIA/EN/0100270810.html.\n\n*Open a terminal (press CTRL-ALT-T).\n\n*Extract the downloaded file and enter the installation directory:\ncd ~/Downloads\ntar zxvf Linux_UFRII_PrinterDriver_V310_uk_EN.tar.gz\ncd Linux_UFR*\n\n\n*Now run the installation script as root. The script has tweaks in it to work for most linuxes, including ubuntu.\nsudo ./install.sh\n\n\n*That's it! Now, open a PDF and print to try.\nMost instructions on the web asked to install the printer drivers directly by double clicking the .deb files in the extracted directories. This did not work. The key is to run the installation script (step 4 above). This worked, for me.\n\nA: I had a case when latest driver version 3.40 did not work for Canon MF4120 on Kubuntu version 17.10:\nc3pldrv -i 6 -o 11 process used 100% of one CPU core when I tried to print something.\nStrace showed that it constantly tried to read(12, \"\", 6).\nFortunately previous driver version 3.10 works!\nI just had to ignore dependency libpng12-0, which is missing on Ubuntu 17.10.\nInstalled package libpng16-16 did not satisfy the .deb package requirements, so I had to ignore the dependency:\ndpkg --ignore-depends=libpng12-0 -i cndrvcups-common_3.40-1_amd64.deb cndrvcups-ufr2-uk_3.10-1_amd64.deb\n\nUnfortunately it leaves \"broken package\", so later I modified the cndrvcups-ufr2-uk_3.10-1_amd64.deb and in control file I replaced libpng12-0 by libpng16-16. Deb file can be modified using Easily unpack DEB, edit postinst, and repack DEB.\nThen reinstalled modified package and that's it.\n\nA: I struggled for hours until it finally worked\nfirst download the driver from canon site for linux ver 3.0\nonce downloaded you need to extract it with archive manager\n/home/xxxx/Linux_UFRII_PrinterDriver_V300_us_EN.tar.gz\n\nthen you will see a folder with the same name\nyou open it, extract it  and there are 32 bit folder and 64 bit folder \nI opened 64 bit folder because my computer is 64 bit you also open /home/jxxx/Downloads/cups-2.1.0-source.tar.bz2 folder extract it , a debian folder extract it there are 2 folders here open both right click run\ngo to settings to add a printer  click ppa file and search it in your computer click on Linux_UFRII_PrinterDriver_V300 and Voila!\nprint test\ndone  \n", "Q: Custom .desktop file -- name doesn't show up in Unity dash on Ubuntu 13.04 I have several .desktop files that I migrated over from 12.10 ubuntu.

I messed around with a bunch of settings within my .desktop files to try to get the name to show up in the Unity launcher, since I had created the .desktop files in ~/Desktop then moved them to ~/.local/share/applications\nAll I had to do to get the Unity application launcher to show the names is log out of Ubuntu and log back in. Pretty lame, I know, but it worked.\nAt least this shows that in my case (and probably yours too) the .desktop files were not somehow wrong. After all, in my case, the desktop-file-validate program didn't list any errors. There was probably some name cache within Unity that needed to be cleared. It would be more satisfying to know how to do that without logging out, but this workaround is good enough for me for now. Hope this observation helps someone else!\n\nA: Ubuntu will not register the .desktop file unless whatever you are executing with:\nExec=<path-to-executable>\n\nis indeed executable, i.e.:\nchmod a+x <path-to-executable>\n\n\nA: What worked for me is restarting Cinnamon (if you have Linux Mint) by pressing ALT+F2 and writing \"r\". There's surely a similar procedure to restart Unity.\nThis will refresh the menu cache without logging out and logging back in.\n\nA: I solved this problem in a fairly straightforward way that probably doesn't apply to most others here--for some reason, my .desktop file included the line NoDisplay=true, with a fairly predictable result. After I removed this line and relogged, the app showed up in dash search as hoped.\n\nA: Corrupted or bad permission desktop file in  ~/.local/share/applications may overwrite  desktop file in  /usr/share/applications.Delete or repair desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications first.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu 13.04 work on HP Pavilion g7-2243us?

This laptop had installed Windows 7 and when I upgraded it I didn’t knew about the UEFI advantages.\nI tried several times to install Ubuntu from a USB device and it loads the logo and then I can’t go further in the installation. \nI thought it was the version of Ubuntu and tried to install Fedora (even if I personally prefer Ubuntu). I had the same problem: Fedora’s logo appears and it gets stuck.   \nI tried also to boot from different USB devices and didn’t work either. \nMy BIOS has EFI options to boot but they were not enabled. So I tried to enable them to boot the USB in UEFI mode. A menu shows up with the options of install Ubuntu and try Ubuntu. If I click the Install or try option, I get a black screen and I can’t go further with the install (which I think is normal since I don’t have Windows 8 in EFI mode).\nMy hypothesis is that the BIOS isn’t letting Ubuntu write or read from my SSD, because the activity LED in the USB memory is on when it’s loading the installation files. Once the files are ready and the Ubuntu logo is loaded I don’t see a LED activity on neither the SSD or the USB. \nThanks\nIf I missed data you can ask me. \n\nA: You would never suspect the ambitious Secure Boot, won't you?\nGo to BIOS settings and turn it off.

There is RAID0 of 2 drives connected through Silicon Image 3132 SATA SoftRAID controller. Under Windows it was partitioned as one dynamic GPT-disk having 4 TB NTFS volume. There is a lot of music and movies on the drive. I'm trying to get him to be seen under Ubuntu as a single disk, not as 2 by 2 terabytes.\nI tried to read it through dmraid, had no success, it is not displayed in /dev/mapper. Also tried to configure the kernel, but did not find anything suspicious, the driver for my controller was turned on. There is also a driver from the manufacturer, but it is only available for RHEL and SLES. Here it's reported that SoftRAID is supported by the kernel, but apparently not completely. If I thrust drives in the AMD controller, built into the motherboard, the drive is seen as a single, but the data is lost. I know about mdadm that it is able to ditch all the information on the disks. So, is it possible to somehow create an array without actually recording information on used drives and to make the system correctly identify sections on it later?\nInformation about the array:\n/dev/sdf - Disk 0\n/dev/sdg - Disk 1\nArray type: Stripe\nChunk Size: 64KB\n\nAlso, a device /dev/md1 is created using command mknod /dev/md1 b 9 1\n\nA: Had to destroy my data, but found a solution. The --build command actually constructs an existing array and runs it. The full command in my case looks such:\nsudo mdadm --build --verbose --chunk=64K /dev/md1 --level=0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdh /dev/sdi\n\nI think that chunk and level options are not necessary, but use them to be sure everything goes right. And I also should never use the --create command, because it destroys existing arrays.\nAs far as time passed, dmraid was improved. Now, in 2017, it can detect Silicon Image SoftRAID volumes, so I just installed and ran dmraid -ay.\n", "Q: Wrong resolution for Lightdm/GDM on Ubuntu 13.04 using HDMI I've tried all the solution I could find on the matter so far, but the error persists. My problem is that the login screen (both under gdm and lightdm) runs with the wrong resolution, even though all is fine when I log in. The error occurs solely when I have my HDMI cable connected to my other screen. The login screen resolution becomes 1024x768 (for my 1366x768 laptop screen) and mirrored on my screen, which is 1920x1080. \nI've had this issue on version 12.04 (the last one before I upgraded to 13.04), but I got it fixed by adding the xrandr commands on the begining of the /etc/gdm/Init/Default file. This doesn't seem to work anymore.\nI've also tried telling lightdm to run a script fixing the resolution with xrandr (by editing /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf), but lightdm crashes, and I'm forced to log in with low graphic settigs.\nHint: when ubuntu is loading, the resolution starts OK, then goes bad right before the login screen is initialized. Does that mean that there's nothing wrong with my graphic cards?\nWhat do you think? Cheers!\n\nA: I faced the same problem running Ubuntu Gnome 13.04. My laptop uses a ATI Radeon graphics card. The laptop display runs at 1980x1080 resolution and I have a Dell 1980x1200 screen connected through the HDMI port.

Since I am still learning about Ubuntu, I don't know how to run the installer. These are the only instructions that I have- To install CrashPlan run the installer in this directory:\n./install.sh\nDoes this mean I need to create the directory? I know how to do that, but if that is the case where (or how) do you run the installer?\n\nA: You downloaded a file named CrashPlan_3.5.3_Linux.tar.gz file from the website and stored this somewhere on your computer. Open a termimal and go to the directory you downloaded it into and type\ntar xvfz CrashPlan_3.5.3_Linux.tar.gz\n\nThis will extract the file. After it is done cd into the directory it created and install...\ncd CrashPlan-install/\n./install\n\nIt will then start installing CrashPlan. From their website: \n\nCrashPlan automatically starts up after installation and prompts you to create a new account.  Enter the information and click Create Account. CrashPlan will send backup reports and notifications to the email address you enter. \n\nExtra: there is a README file inside the directory. Notable:\nNOTES:\n1) CrashPlan for Linux uses the Sun Java Runtime Environment to run.  If\nyou do not have the Sun Java Runtime Environment installed, CrashPlan\ncan download a version of the Runtime Environment and install it alongside\nCrashPlan itself.

Thanks, Ceci.\n\nA: General solution for such situations is to do several dist-upgrades to the next release until you reach supported version. For your issue, you need to update to 11.10 release then to 12.04. Then you have to decide if you want to have LTS version or the latest one which is 13.04. Of course, you need all transitional releases to be downloaded and burned to CDs, or you have to use Ubuntu old-releases site to make transitional upgrades.\n\nA: First update your ubuntu 11.04 with all required updates by\nsudo apt-get update\nthen \nsudo apt-get upgrade\nIf any new version available it automatically intimate you to upgrade\n", "Q: Would security be comprimised if I install a gui (e.g. zPanel) for LAMP? I am an Ubuntu/Linux noob. There are many questions I have regarding the use of my system as a server. First and foremost is security. I want to install a simple GUI (zPanel appears the most user friendly) that will allow others to log into the server and database with ease, similar to a hosting service, though my intent is for the development of one site. Upon looking at the instructions of numerous GUI's, they require installation as root. This makes me uneasy, as my thoughts spiral to the possibilities of the developers creating the elusive 'back-door', thereby giving them root access to my entire system. Am I just being paranoid or is that theoretically possible? If it is possible, what steps are necessary to ensure security?\n\nA: That is the beauty of open source: as soon as something fishy gets installed someone will notice since it only takes 1 user to find a problem and make it public for all of us to benefit. Unless you are a specific target of course.  \nInstalling software with sudo is not a problem in itself. What you need to make sure is that the permission are set as restrictive as possible. So never use chmod 777 and check the permissions of the files that got installed for zPanel. \nBackdoors require the software to go in and out of your system. That will cause log files to be updated so the easiest method of finding them is to check log files for activity. \n\nAm I just being paranoid or is that theoretically possible? \n\nA little bit of paranoia is not bad and yes it is theoretically possible. But there are more likely scenario's than that.\n\nIf it is possible, what steps are necessary to ensure security?\n\nThis will work for any piece of software:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to use only software in the repositories and from trusted sources; Try webmin first.

We can not add an additional window frame in this preview. From the default theme Adwaita there is then not much difference from an active vs. an inactive window. It is hard to spot.\nUnfortunately we also do not have much options to change the windows decoration of an installed theme by design. However below are two examples of other themes which both have a better contrast from the active vs. inactive windows:\nFaience\nThere is not a great difference, but it is a theme many users like. We can see that the active window's title (gnome-tweak-tool) is slightly darker than the titles of the two inactive windows (terminal, firefox).\n\nEsco\nThis is one of the default themes that comes with the Ubuntu GNOME remix.

However, my newly acquired Huawei E3131 is causing problems.\nWhen plugged in, Ubuntu detects the device as a CD-ROM and a modem. I can browse the dongle's contents using Nautilus and Network Manager is able to configure and work the dongle out-of-the-box. I can even get to surf.\nHowever, within minutes, the connection drops and the CD-ROM is unmounted. I wait about 15 seconds, then the CD-ROM mounts again and Network Manager is able to connect again with short-lived surfing. Rinse, lather and repeat.\nIt's strange that the device mounts as a CD-ROM, but works as a modem, too, suggesting that mode switching happens somewhere. It's not a signal coverage problem, either because I tested the same SIM card using 3 other different dongles (2 ZTEs and another Huawei) and it is only this E3131 that has this problem.

I haven't tried anything of this, so I can't give any guarantees.\nVery probably you can catch the plugging/unplugging events with acpid, which can be configured to run shell scripts on such acpi events. To find out if acpid recognizes plugging/unplugging events, there's a command line tool called \"acpi_listen\". Run it and plug/unplug your charger to see how the corresponding events are named.\nThe hard part is to figure how to change display brightness on command line. I don't know if a user-friendly hardware-independent frontend exists, but you should be able to directly turn the knobs in sysfs... Usually there's a file in sysfs that lets you control brightness simply by writing the desired value to it. Take a look at the subfolders of /sys/class/backlight. There's a description of the sysfs backlight interface in the Ubuntu Wiki.\nWith this information you should be able to write short shell scripts that set brightness. Put them in /etc/acpi and write an EventScript similar to what people did in the acpid article on thinkwiki for other tasks.\n\nA: Try laptop-mode-tools. it's in Ubuntu repositories. \nafter installation go to /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/lcd-brightness.conf and change parameters according to your need. \nFor example:\nCONTROL_BRIGHTNESS=1\n\nBATT_BRIGHTNESS_COMMAND=\"echo 25\"\nLM_AC_BRIGHTNESS_COMMAND=\"echo 40\"\nNOLM_AC_BRIGHTNESS_COMMAND=\"echo 40\"\nBRIGHTNESS_OUTPUT=\"/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\"\n\nThis is my actual settings on my Sony SVF13N17PGB Ultrabook.\nPlease change BRIGHTNESS_OUTPUT to proper path according to your notebook.

Yet every time I open Firefox, I'm asked to configure it again I have installed Keepass2 from the Ubuntu Software Center and Keefox in Firefox. The setup works fine. Both can communicate with each other.\nHowever, every time I start Firefox I'm greeted with the same window asking me to configure it all over again even though there is no need.\nHow can I fix it? There is no obvious setting in the extension or about:config to change this behaviour.\n\n\nA: Probably worth taking a look at this page if you've not already: https://github.com/luckyrat/KeeFox/wiki/en-|-Installation-|-Linux\nThe setup tab appears because KeeFox does not think that you have setup everything correctly.\nThe above page and/or manually entering the paths in the Options/KeePass panel should do the trick but if not you could try the KeeFox help resources: http://keefox.org/help\nThe path information should be explained on the setup page but it's possible this is different in non-English languages.\n\nA: You do not need to use application plus add-on.\nAll i use is Keepassx, no other application or firefox add-on required.\nYou can use a global hotkey with keepassx.\nOnce setup step 1) enter global hotkey 2) enter password = All done.\nYoutube link on instructions:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BM8XxS1jUE\n\nA: I had the same issue.

Everything worked just fine before, but i suppose KeeFox updated and was expecting a newer version of KeePassRPC too. I was hesitant to set it up again because i had done so before, but when i copied the rpc plugin supplied by KeeFox again everyting worked as expected.\n\nA: On the KeePass settings page that other answers mention, I had to check the checkbox for \"Remember above settings (e.g. when using KeePass Portable)\", even though I was not using a portable location.

I don't mind having to wipe out my disk (again). \n\nA: If the disk has no existing partitions, the installer might be creating a fresh and new partition table; but it should not do that if the disk has existing partitions and if you tell the installer to use the (badly named) \"something else\" setup option, which requires you to set up your partitions manually.

I have successfully installed python 3.3 on Ubuntu 12.10. Since I don’t need multiple versions of python, I want to remove the existing python 2.7. When I try to do that, using\nsudo apt-get remove python2.7\n\nUbuntu warns me that there are tons of system dependent components which will also be removed. It looks really scary.\nSo, is there a way to remove python 2.7 without removing the system dependent components, or can I direct those dependents to use python 3.3?\n\nA: You can't, and you don't really want to.\nPython changed drastically between 2.7 and 3.0, and broke backward compatibility.  Python scripts that were written for 2.7, which are used to support a large amount of the system's infrastructure, won't necessarily work properly with Python 3.x.  Those scripts need to be updated to work with the new version, and until that happens, you'll need to keep Python 2.7 around.\nThis is why you notice such a large number of dependencies on the old Python - the system depends on it.  Besides, there's no harm in having both versions of Python installed on the same system.  And you may come across applications in the future that still use Python 2.7, so keeping it around is a good idea.\n\nA: You can't.\nFrom the Ubuntu wiki / Python:\n\nLonger term plans (e.g. 14.04)\nMove Python 2 to universe, port all Python applications in main to Python 3. We will never fully get rid of Python 2.7, but since there will also never be a Python 2.8, and Python 2.7 will be nearly 4 years old by the time of the 14.04 LTS release, it is time to relegate Python 2 to universe.\n\nThis means that a lot of base packages have hard dependencies on 2.7 and it will still take a lot of time tot get things migrated. Note that Python 3 has numerous backwards incompatible changes -- it's not a regular package upgrade.\nIf you really want to get rid of Python 2.7, you'll have to wait for the 14.04 release, but there's no guarantee.\n\nA: Came here in 2019 because I develop in Python3 by default and came to the same conclusion as OP after seeing what'd be removed after running apt purge python\nSince what I really wanted was to call Python3 with just python, I ran\nsudo rm /usr/bin/python\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python\n\nThis way, if Python2.7 is still needed, it can be called explicitly with python2.7 while simply calling python will default to Python3 because of the symbolic link.\nI don't have any bash level scripts that call python2.7 with python so this change wouldn't be disruptive - while other systems would need their scripts adjusted accordingly if they did. \n\nThe main barrier to a distribution switching the python command from python2 to python3 isn't breakage within the distribution, but instead breakage of private third party scripts developed by sysadmins and other users. \n\n- The \"python\" Command On Unix-Like Systems\nThis answer isn't a direct response to OP, but as someone who had a similar question this is the functionality I was looking for when I was thinking of removing 2.7.

I am using Lubuntu 13.04.\nHow can I install programs from a Live CD from chroot?\n\nA: Actually Live CD consists of very Limited software that needed to install a basic Ubuntu System with required software.All the software will be available in .DEB format and you can install those software in your system if you want.\nSimply copy that software somewhere in your directory and then open your terminal and cd to that directory.\nIf you want to install all those packages once then simply \nsudo dpkg -i *.deb will help you.\n\nIf you want to install application by application then do as \nsudo dpkg -i <place the file name here >.deb\n\nhope that helps.\n\nA: No, you can not use chroot to install software on a current system. chroot is a wrapper that allows you to change the root directory so anything inside the chroot can not change (or even see) your system. Basically you put the software in a jail and it can not do anything outside that jail. \nA popular example of a chroot is to create your own installation Ubuntu Live DVD. You download an Ubuntu ISO, create a pseudo filesystem with chroot and then mount the ISO so you can alter its contents and, when done, burn the ISO to a DVD. \n\nA: You can use chroot in that way. \nYou have to mount the root HD somewhere such as /mnt \nThen you have to mount --bind for /dev /dev/pts and /sys.  In some case you may also need to mount /usr\nThen mount proc /mnt/proc\nyou may also need to copy in resolv.conf to get net \nthen chroot in\n", "Q: Why don't custom upstart job names tab complete in the service command? I'm used to create upstart services with a file in /etc/init/<service>.conf and it works perfectly fine, the only thing I'd like to is to have tab completion the same way that every service in /etc/init.d/ have right now.\nWhen writing sudo service xx the name of the service should apear. \nIs there a way to add upstart services to that autocompletion list?\n\nA: Every package that provides a standard daemon using upstart is required to provide a symlink in /etc/init.d by Debian policy. So autocompletion for sudo service name already works. Make sure that you have the bash-completion package installed if you're having problems.\nIf you are creating your own upstart jobs, then symlink /etc/init.d/your_job to /lib/init/upstart-job like the other upstart jobs are doing already. This will make your own jobs work the same way.\nThere are special upstart jobs in /etc/init that do not have a corresponding entry in /etc/init.d. These are an exception. From Debian Policy:\n\nAn exception to this rule is scripts or jobs provided by the init implementation itself; such jobs may be required for an implementation-specific equivalent of the /etc/rcS.d/ scripts and may not have a one-to-one correspondence with the init scripts.\n\nThese exceptions do not currently work with bash-completion. However, you can use start, stop, restart and reload directly without service, and autocompletion will work. For example, sudo start shut correctly autocompletes. But you shouldn't normally need to directly call upstart jobs that do not have a corresponding init.d entry.\nNote: I tested this on Saucy. If support doesn't appear in an older release, perhaps it is not available there (but you'll get it soon when you upgrade to a sufficiently new release).\n", "Q: Migrating an Ubuntu mirror made with `apt-mirror` We have one office with broadband and another one with dialup.

In Windows' power options, you had the ability to configure your system to use either 'active' or 'passive' cooling schemes.\nIn the 'active' scheme, the fans would start running faster as the CPU got hotter - then slow the CPU if the fans were at maximum.\nIn the 'passive' scheme, the CPU would slow down before running the fans faster.\nIs there a way to configure Linux to switch between these 'schemes' somehow, either set up manually with a configuration file or similar?\nAs a note, pwmconfig states: There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed and fancontrol states: Can't read configuration file.\nI'd like to be able to switch to a passive power scheme at times for times when I need my laptop to remain quiet, but not necessarily fast, e.g. in a library.\n\nA: What you need is cpufreqd, this can take input from various sources and apply rules to set each CPU to a given profile, dependent on a scoring system.\nI use it with the lm-sensors package. This lets cpufreqd query motherboard and chip temperatures, voltages and fan speeds (and, dependent on your hardware lots of other things) and you can use that to create weighting factors that are tested by the rules to switch power profiles.\nEach power profile can set things like individual CPU frequency, how that frequency is govenered and other things like monitor brightness (for power saving) and fan speeds.

So, you must pay attention when you choose the keyboard layouts and the shortcut.\nWish you success when typing!\n\nA: It is true that you can only have 4 keyboard layouts installed by default. This limitation does not come from Ubuntu, but from Xorg.\nWhile a scripted approach to make multiple sets of 4 keyboard layouts available should work, IMHO it is cumbersome to use and vulnerable to breakage in the future.\nYou can, however, have as many input methods as you need, assuming the input method exists for the language you need. One other point is not to confuse language support in general with the keyboard layout.\nMy recommendation is to use the input editor ibus for as many languages as possible; and then to use a keyboard layout that works well with the other languages.\nIbus\nIbus is the standard input method for Ubuntu. To enable it, use Language Support in System Settings.\n\nFor the fullest range of input methods, you also need to install ibus-m17n \nSet Ibus Preferences and Input Methods\nAfter logging out and back in, you will see the ibus indicator (a little keyboard, similar to the keyboard layouts indicator. Use the drop-down menu to open the Preferences dialog. You can also start the preferences dialog from the command line with ibus-setup.\nAs an aside, on the General tab, it's a good idea to change Show language panel to When active or Always. There is a bug or conflict somewhere that keeps the default option of Embedded in Menu from working. The language panel provides additional functionality for the various input methods.\n\nThen choose the Input Method tab. Choose Customize active input methods. Please note that installing the ibus-m17n package or language support for a language does not automatically set up an input method. You still need to do this separately.\n\nUse the Select an input method button to access the sub-menus for a long list of languages.\n\nAfter choosing the one you want, the text will change to that input method. Click Add and the Close.\n\nKeyboard layouts for the remaining languages\nMost languages that use the Roman alphabet with diacritics do not necessarily need a specific keyboard layout. If after setting up input methods, you only have 3 or 4 left, by all means use the specific keyboard layouts.\nBut in most cases, you can insert whatever characters with diacritics you need by using the English international keyboard with dead keys or by enabling the compose key in Keyboard layout options. \nHow you input the characters is completely separate from how programs such as LibreOffice provide language support and spell checking.\n", "Q: how to un-install a special driver/kernel in 13.04 I have tried to install a special ATI driver using a method described in this Debian help wiki page\nDetails:\n\nAlternative ATI Legacy Video Driver PPA installation for (for < 5000\n  series cards):\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev*\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade \nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic fglrx-legacy\nsudo aticonfig --initial\n\n\nAnd then reboot.\n\nThere were a couple of warnings at sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic fglrx-legacy with update-alternatives.\nBut, at the last step I got \naticonfig: No supported adapters detected\n\nUnity does not start any more.

But I don't understand why I have to keep applying changes over and over.\nIs possible to set some kind of permission permanently so that both operating systems will respect permanently?\nI guess 777 will work, but I thought that this is not a smart thing to do. But as long as  'others' does not get full access (third seven), I see a lock icon on the file in ubuntu.\n\nA: User names are irrelevant. Permissions in both HFS+ and Linux-native filesystems are stored in terms of user IDs (UIDs), which are numbers associated with usernames. In Ubuntu, as in most modern Linux distributions, the first user is given a UID of 1000 by default. In OS X, the first user is given a UID of 501 by default. Thus, when sharing media that encode UID values, the UID values are likely to not match.\nOne way to fix this is by setting loose permissions (the mode value, as in rwxr-xr-x, or 755 in octal). Note that the permissions octal code is not the same as the UID value. In either OS, you can set the default permissions used on files with the umask command, which specifies the bit value to be removed from file permissions. For instance, umask 022 removes write permission for the group and other permissions, resulting in 755 (rwxr-xr-x) permissions on new files (or 644 if something removes the execute permission bit, which is common practice for files). This is largely a command-line tool, though; if you're largely a GUI user, you'll need to find another tool to do the job, probably related to your desktop environment's defaults. This may be obscure and poorly documented. Also, setting loose permissions in this way can have security drawbacks, especially if yours is a multi-user system.\nA better approach is to synchronize your account UIDs across Linux and OS X. You can easily change the UID value in Linux with the usermod command, as in:\nusermod -u 501 dale\n\nThis command sets the UID for dale to 501. There are some significant caveats, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*You should log out of the account you're modifying before you modify it. Trying to modify an in-use account will cause that account to begin behaving strangely.\n\n*usermod must be used as root. You can execute it via sudo, but doing so from the account you're modifying is inadvisable in the extreme. Thus, you'll need to either give root a password and log into root directly or use sudo from a second user account.\n\n*The usermod command won't change the ownership of any files owned by the user in question. To adjust ownership of those files, you'll need to locate them and then change their ownership with chown. Most of the files will be in the user's home directory, so chown -R dale: /home/dale, typed as root after changing dale's UID, will change most of dale's files to use the new UID number. Some of the user's files may be located elsewhere, though. Typing find / -uid 1000 will find all the files that use the old UID (assuming it was 1000). Note that this find command will probably take several minutes to complete. To speed it up, unmount any filesystems on which you're sure it will find no hits, such as FAT or NTFS volumes.\n\n*If you access FAT or NTFS volumes, their UID values are determined by options at mount time. If you use a GUI file manager, chances are the UID value is set to whoever is running the file manager, so you need do nothing special. If you mount the volume via an /etc/fstab entry, though, you may need to adjust the UID value it specifies.\n\n*Ubuntu stores the minimum value it uses for UIDs in /etc/login.defs. If you fail to change the UID_MIN value in this file, you'll likely discover that your account will seem to \"disappear\" from the GUI login screen, and perhaps from some other systems. Thus, you should edit that file.\n\n\nIn theory, you could change the UID of your OS X account(s) in a similar way to achieve the same goal. I'm less familiar with the OS X account-maintenance tools, though, so I can't provide explicit instructions for doing so. Adjusting the OS X values would have the advantage of your not having to adjust UID_MIN in Linux.\nIf you've got multiple accounts on your computer, you should adjust them all to keep them all synchronized across your OS installations.\nOne more point: The Group ID (GID) value is stored in a similar way. IIRC, Ubuntu assigns a GID value for each account that's identical to its UID value. I don't recall what OS X does by default. You might want to adjust the GID values for the two OSes in a way that's analogous to the UID changes, but this isn't likely to be as important as adjusting the UID values.\nEDIT: If you want to change your UID (and GID, if desired) in macOS/OS X rather than in Ubuntu, you can do so. As this modification in macOS is beyond the scope of this site, I'll just link to a few pages that provide procedures for doing this in macOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change a user's User ID on Mac OS X (10.6 - 10.12)\n\n*\"Changing your UID and GID\" on Apple Communities\n\n*\"Consequences of changing uid/gid on snow leopard\" on SuperUser\n\nA: Open a terminal and:\nIn OS X, try this\nsudo dscl / -create /Users/<ubuntu-username>\nsudo dscl / -append /Groups/<os-x-username> GroupMembership <ubuntu-username>\n\nIn Ubuntu, run this\nsudo adduser --system --no-create-home --ingroup <ubuntu-username> <os-x-username>\n\nNow you should be able to use 774 or even 770 for file permissions.\n\nA: I have found that sometimes you can click on a folder you would like to share and hit command + I.  Then click on the lock and enter your password if it is not unlocked\nNext, then where it says \"everyone\" choose read and write.\nAnother thing that works is to set up a folder as a \"shared folder\" you can do this in the sharing preference pane in system preferences.\nGo to system preferences > sharing > file sharing.  Then make share that the file sharing box is checked and add the folder you would like to share using the plus button.  Then you can change the permissions to read an write. \nONE NOTE: using the second option will also open up your computer to allow access to the folder of your choice over the internet (only while booted into os x)!!  Make share you have a secure password and that you probably disable this in public places (don't forget get your tinfoil hat!)\n", "Q: Permission Denied on Installer When I try to install Ubuntu with wubi, it gets to about 70% but then it stops for a couple minutes.

My ten year old XP pc has a D-Link GO-USB-N150 Wireless N 150 Easy USB Adapter. Will this usb wifi adapter work well with Ubuntu?\n\nA: Booting Linux\nUbuntu can be sort of memory intensive for an old pc.  The first step is to make sure you have at least 512 mb of ram.  For other requirements check here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements.  The good news about an old pc is that most of the hardware should be figured out.  However, there is a chance that you may need to rely on some legacy drivers for things like graphics.  I would recommend against installing ubuntu desktop.  Look at lubunuhttp://www.lubuntu.net/ and xubntu: http://xubuntu.org/ as they are FAR less processor/memory intensive.\nHowever, I would recommend that you look into something more lightweight like archbang http://archbang.org/.\nWhat you might want to try first is see how your computer handles one of the light live distros such as slitaz which only requires 16mb of ram: http://www.slitaz.org/en/.\nYou can burn any of these options onto a cd as per the distro specific instructions.\nNow, as actually installing/booting a cd, you are going to need to edit your bios.

See How to chroot Ubuntu using Live CD to fix GRUB rescue prompt.\nBasically how it works is you boot of the live CD and mount your Ubuntu install.

Ubuntu is hosted under Windows NTFS filesystem. \nUbuntu Wubi Installer and Wubi Guide for more info. \nIf you want to change the boot-order, then you should use carefully a Windows tool → \nEasyBCD\nI strongly suggest to install Ubuntu alongside Windows = regular dual-boot. \n", "Q: How do I disable the fourth button on an Apple Mighty Mouse? I have an Apple Mighty Mouse, but it's been banged up a bit. The side buttons (4th buttons) are way too easily pressed. When I'm using Firefox, the 4th button can accidentally click and I'd go back one page, which can be really aggravating. How can I disable the 4th button (on either Firefox or Ubuntu) without getting any new hardware?\n\nA: Those buttons (forward and back) drive me crazy too! Here's what worked for me:\nOpen a terminal (CtrlAltT by default),  and run:\n$ xev | grep -A2 ButtonPress\n\nThis will pop open a window. Move the mouse into that window, and press the button(s) that you wish to disable. Look at the third line for each button-press, which will look something like:\nButtonPress event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x4000001,\n    root 0x2f2, subw 0x0, time 355888399, (114,122), root:(114,174),\n    state 0x10, button 8, same_screen YES\n\nNote the number after button. For me, the back/forward buttons were numbers 8 and 9.\nClose the xev window, and create/edit an .Xmodmap file in your home directory:\n$ cat >> ~/.Xmodmap\n! Disable buttons 8 and 9\npointer = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0\n\nIn your case, to just disable button 4, you'd want pointer = 1 2 3 0 5 6 7 8 9.\n Press CtrlD to return to the prompt, then test it out:\n$ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap \n\nThis will load the .Xmodmap file and your button(s) should be disabled immediately.\nMost desktop environments should load this file automatically next time you log in, making the change permanent.\nThis is an old question, but I hope this answer helps someone.\n\nA: its simple. just follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into system settings found in your dock or by searching after pressing Alt-F2\n\n*Go into \"mouse and touchpad\" (or something similar, thats just what it says for me)\n\n*Go change the setting you want\n\n", "Q: Is there anyway to run Ubuntu only when a cd is in my computer I am fairly new to modern linux.

However, it has a 60MB storage limit (although text files are not going to occupy much space, but the limitation concern still remains). \nToday, I installed Xournal, which has great features like annotating, nice background, free hand shapes and notes, save in PDF format, and many more. But the big problem is that as far as I've noticed, there is no intrinsic feature for search inside the notes (created using Xournal with .xoj suffix). I used Catfish File Search application (which creates bash commands for full text search), but it couldn't help as well. Is there anyway to search inside a .xoj file at all? If so, it could be a suitable alternative to evernote, if you put your .xoj files on a cloud (which certainly offers you much more storage space than 60MB).\nIf not, is there any other convenient app similar to Evernote, but with higher storage limit or without a limit? Somebody suggested Zim desktop wiki app, which looks great, but I'm nut sure if I could copy and paste everything there (a mixture of photos and tables and text with various formats and highlights), like what I do with Evernote. And a very useful tool I use is Evernote Web Clipper (browser extension). Of course, having a desktop client like Everpad is a plus, but not the absolute need.\nPS: I use pocket, so please do suggest that (it only preserve links (which might change over time) not the actual text). I also use google drive or docs, I don't like that  for this purpose neither, it's too slow, doesn't have a browser extension and a desktop client.\nThank you so much in advance. \n\nA: To search into a Xournal file, you can change its suffix from xoj to gz, then gunzip it.

BTW the external hard drive i have is basically a 2.5\" 200GB laptop HDD with a USB 2.0 SATA enclosure.\nThank you very much\n\nA: Hi and welcome to askubuntu!\nThe answer is affirmative. I myself am running Ubuntu from an external hard drive with a separate partition (FAT32 formatted) where I keep my music and common documents.\nThe only caveat is making sure that in the installation process you select the right drive (the external one) as the boot loader target. You will have to manually edit your partitions and leave free space for your extra partition(s).\nYou should also make sure (!) you are editing the partitions on your external hard drive. Remember that formatting the disk will erase its contents, it would be unfortunate if you end up erasing your internal hard drive :)\nThis image shows the point at which you must choose the right drive for the bootloader (this is also an image of the Do something else... installation option):\n\n\nMy recommendation (a simplistic one) is to create the following partitions:\n/boot   with ~300 MB\nswap    depends on the RAM of your system (if you've got 1 GB of RAM try with ~2 GB of swap)\n/       with ~25 GB (if installing a lot of software consider ~35 GB)\n/home   make the sum of this and the others equal to ~100 GB\n\nthen leave the remaining 100 GB for common storage (format it to FAT32, for example).\n", "Q: Download to file external hard drive My netbook does not have enough hard drive space. I have tried to download Ubuntu to my C:\\ drive but ran out of memory. How can I download Ubuntu to an external hard drive bypassing the internal hard drive?\n\nA: Plug in your external hard drive. From the Ubuntu downloads page, right click the link to the .iso file and click 'Save Link As' and save to the external hard drive.\nIf you are planning on installing Ubuntu on this computer (which I assume is running Windows, since you mention a C:\\ drive) you obviously won't be able to run both Windows and Ubuntu if you are out of hard drive space. You'll have to decide if you want to keep running windows, or if you want to replace it completely with Ubuntu.\n\nA: @amc, using \"save link as\" doesn't usually work.\nJim, you will need to open your browser preferences and then tell it to ask you where to save downloaded files.\nNot sure if this bypasses your primary HDD completely though. It might download to the primary first and then move the files to the external source once the download is complete.\nAlternatively you could lump a bunch of files, preferably audio/video from your primary to your external and then download. The ubuntu installer isn't really that big so it shouldn't take long at all.\nOther options, disk defrag and/or clear cache (CCleaner is a good free program for performing maintenance like this), make sure your recycling bin is empty, delete old useless backups of your computer, remove windows indexing.\n", "Q: OS not found :( Ubuntu / Win 7/ Kali I had two partitions with Win 7 and one partition with Kali Linux (Debian). Everything was working great but I got into Android Dev, specifically ROM dev and along the way I figured there was more support on Ubuntu for Android dev.\nI decided to reduce some redundancy as I had many of the same apps on both Win 7's and the OS on C:/ (the original with ACER) was a bit screwy due to my insatiable curiosity. I decided to Install Ubuntu 12 on C:/ instead, so I have C:/, G:/ and Kali, Ubuntu is already installed on C:/ all the OS's are there but something happened to my MBR.\nWhen I try to boot up it runs a few lines and the tries a network boot (last option in Bios) first HDD then USBs and then Network is the order I have it now, it was USB first the HDD then Network. Then it jumps to a black screen and says \"Operating System not found\"\nI am sure this is a common problem, I tried to reinstall Ubuntu with several different setup options while being careful not to overwrite the other two OS's. \nI think GRUB tried to take over my MBR. I used to be able to boot up and choose to boot either one of the Win 7's or Kali and when I chose Kali it would boot GRUB2, so I had MBR to boot into windows or Kali and if I choose Kali MBR would boot GRUB2 to boot into Kali.\nAny Advice would be great, my last option is to back up my Media and settings then to reinstall everything from scratch which would probably take a week to accomplish with my schedule.\n\nA: Try following this guide for using boot-repair\n", "Q: GRUB failed to install to the following devices error on upgrade I'm upgrading an old laptop from 12.04 to 12.10, but during the process I'm getting some errors relating to the grub upgrade.

I have removed Ubuntu from my dual-boot machine. I just manually deleted Ubuntu partition being under Windows. I used \"Disk Manager\" for that operation.

Everything is OK, Windows boot works fine.\nBut now it seems that Windows doesn't see that partition (where Ubuntu was). I cannot create any new logical partition on that place. When I try to create a partition Windows throws an error. What happened and how can I restore the access to that partition from Windows?\nI want to try Lubuntu (because Ubuntu was slow).

Disk Manager just throws an error if you want to do something with that partition. But Ubuntu (or Lubuntu) sees that partition just fine.\nSo, this is what I did to get that partition back in Windows. I reboot Windows using Windows CD and from there I chose to create a new 10 Gb partition on that space. Then I entered Windows as usual and Disk Manager could see that new 10 Gb partition. I formatted it with FAT32.\nSo now I have 10 Gb FAT32 shared partition and 50 Gb for Lubuntu.\n", "Q: Why is LibreOffice default instead of OpenOffice.org I have read before some articles about OpenOffice.org (OOO). They were saying that because of the status of OOO before it is maintained by Apache, the distros avoided distributing OOO along with the installations. Now since OOO is maintained by Apache, why don't distros use OOO again?\nDo you have any idea about cons and pros of LibreOffice against OOO?\n\nA: Assuming you read What is the difference between OpenOffice and the newly created LibreOffice? (I was going to mark it as duplicate but your question is more of a why Ubuntu and others still use LibreOffice) the differences right now and possibly for the future are:\n\n\n*\n\n*LibreOffice Development is several times faster than OpenOffice which helps users and distros get better performance, stability and features ready for when a new distro version comes out.\n\n*Many of the changes users have asked for years with OpenOffice were implemented in less than a year in LibreOffice (Many types of formats for example)\n\n*Staying with LibreOffice gave some guarantee to all Distros that the next version would not magically change licence and try to make them pay for it.\n\n*When the Apache Foundation took over, it was already too late. LibreOffice had many features, updates and commits made that were much better than OpenOffice and it had a programming rhythm that was and is faster than the one OpenOffice has.\n\n*Trying to work on OpenOffice, knowing the above points is leaving many of the things LibreOffice has done and working twice as much to implement some of them back to OpenOffice.\nNow for my personal opinions over this based on experiences with both and since the creation of LibreOffice:\n\n\n*\n\n*The move from OpenOffice to LibreOffice was basically (And this is my personal opinion) because Oracle is simply a not so friendly open-source type company that since the moment they touched everything Sun had, it became to some degrees, unfriendly for the open source user (VirtualBox, MySQL, OpenOffice and Java to name a few). They started changing many things. From VirtualBox not offering USB support (Yes I still remember when VirtualBox was installed and you had USB 2.0 support from the start) without the extension, to MySQL changing parts of its Licence, to OpenOffice changing many development aspects and where its heading was. This is the reason many of its developers simply left and created the documentfoundation.org because they believe in the open source idea of sharing without limiting and knowledge before money.\n\n*LibreOffice covers many file types that I needed for many years and OpenOffice did not offer. I for one made about 50 students join Ubuntu just because LibreOffice not only supported older file types, but had better support for doc and docx documents.\n\n*The memory footprint of LibreOffice is less than OpenOffice, so it helps computers with limited resources.\n\n*Since the development is faster, many of us can pinpoint a bug and most of them are targeted very fast and solved very quickly. Not only that but as you can see there is even a contest to find Bugs and win a TShirt.\n\n*I personally have seen more bugs and fixes applied to LibreOffice in 6 months than 3 years in OpenOffice. you can see the development of Apache OpenOffice vs LibreOffice. As you can see LibreOffice has almost 20 times faster development than OpenOffice right now. That gives anybody an idea to which one to stick.\n\n*The team behind Apache OpenOffice is not in a hurry and although they are an excellent group and Apache, well, what can I say of this amazing foundation that you have not heard, comparing speeds of development, I would not be amazed if they left OpenOffice to die its last days.\n", "Q: Will a USB Ubuntu 12.04 Boot Image Work if Copied to a CD/DVD? I have an old computer (HP D220 MT) running Ubuntu 12.04.   I recently made a USB pen drive boot image (in case my hard drive crashes), but the BIOS won't let me boot from USB (booting from CD's/DVD's works fine).  I can't directly create a CD or DVD as my computer can only read CD/DVD's (no write available).\nMy question:\nIf I copy the USB pen drive directories/files to a CD or DVD (on a different computer).  Will my computer have a crying chance to successfully boot from this CD/DVD?\nThanks.\n\nA: There may be a way to do it but just copying the drive to the CD will not work. This is because CDs and USBs us a different mechanism to boot. Also bootable CDs load their OS into the ram because the CD has no write ability. The Ubuntu installation you have on a USB is not configured to load into the ram.

The /media/ represents where I want the logical volume to be mounted.\n\n*And then with Samba, I ran gksudo nautilus in the terminal, edited permissions, and shared it. The reason I ran this command in the terminal is to open up the file manager as root so I can be the \"owner\". I would not have been able to edit permissions without running this command.\n\nA: You should just add a line in your /etc/fstab/ like\n/dev/fileserver-media /media/ ext4 defaults 0 0\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 alongside Windows 8 - How to partition from Windows I plan to install Ubuntu 13.04 alongside Windows 8, and I'm looking for a CLEAR answer on how to conduct partitioning appropriately.  \nI'm very new to all of this so a thorough explanation with minimal jargon would be great.  I have an Acer Aspire M5 x64 with 6G RAM.  I think I already figured out how to deal with the fast startup, UEFI and SecureBoot issues (I disabled fast startup and disabled Secure Boot).  I am able to boot into Ubuntu from a LiveUSB, and I think I am ready to install Ubuntu. Note - despite some advice found here, I do have to disable SecureBoot to boot 13.04 from my LiveUSB.\nFrom what I have read here, it seems that I should (at least at first) create the partitions from WITHIN Windows 8, not from the LiveUSB, to avoid reported problems.  I have run compmgmt.msc and I see the existing partitions.  I see the following:\nDisk 0:  400 MB Recovery; 300 MB EFI System; Acer (C:) 444.95 GB (Boot, Page File, Crash Dump, Primary Partition); 20 GB Recovery\nDisk 1:  3.74 GB Primary Partition; 14.90 GB Primary Partition\nI gather I need to create a mounting point '/' Partition (??), a swap partition, and a home partition.   Please explain what these are, how big they should be, how I create them from Windows Disk Management, and anything else I need to know.  \nEventually, I plan to fully replace Windows 8 with Ubuntu, but for now I want to run alongside Windows 8 and not screw things up.  I don't have any critical files saved on this computer yet.\nThanks.\n\nA: Initially, you have to free space on your hard drive. Right-click the C: partition and choose Resize option. I recommend you to free 50+ GB. Then you should add 3 new partitions: swap, Ubuntu and home. Simply right-click on free space and choose appropriate option to do this.\nSwap usually takes the exact amount of your RAM and has purposes similar to Windows swap, but you're permitted to make it of any size, depending on how hard your computer is loaded. Big swap can help you run more applications when you have small RAM, but slows performance. Ubuntu partition is the system partition. It contains the kernel, boot files, GNU executables and related stuff. For most cases it should be about 20 GB, but 10 GB is enough too if you not plan to install many packages. And the remaining space (~20 GB) you can give to home partition which is analog of user's folder in Windows. \nAfter you install Ubuntu, you can add some symbolic links pointing to your music, pictures and videos on Windows partition from the home folder for convenience and salvation of free space.\n", "Q: How to add grant permissions to a group?

If you are doing this on one harddisk, continuously, it will affect performance. Not per se because of cat, I believe cat isn't especially an issue here, but because of the intrinsic I/O effect of your functionality.\nIf you keep on reading and writing from a disk (especially when it is the same), you'd have a noticable performance effect on all other programs that want to read or write. How much is just a question of the speed of the system, if there are any breaks in reading/writing at all, how many disks you are using, etc etc.\nSo yes there CAN be, but as with all performance questions: you should really TEST if it is the case.

Information I've found here suggests that for my system, I need to install 13.04 into an EFI-type partition, since it needs to boot as UEFI.  I also understand it is advisable to have only ONE EFI partition on the disk; I've read here that it is OK for Ubuntu and Windows to share the same partition (please confirm).  When I try to install into the existing EFI drive, I get the message \"No root file system is defined.  Please correct from partitioning menu.\"  Do I change the EFI boot partition to another type?  Doesn't that defeat the purpose?  If I change it to Ext4 Journaling File System, I am given the opportunity to define the '/' Mount point.  I haven't proceeded beyond this point for fear I am going to destroy Windows 8 by altering this partition.  \nBTW, I created three partitions in Windows before installing, per the helpful response to my previous question.  But if I try to install into the partition I created for Ubuntu, I get the \"No root file system...\" error again.\nI have read this question/answer several times over:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nMuch of that answer talks about dealing with Secure Boot - I have already figured out how to disable Secure Boot, so according to that answer \"there is no problem\" there.  If I understand correctly, I want to stay in UEFI with Secure Boot disabled.  There is already have an EFI partition, and when I try to install Ubuntu into that EFI partition I get the error message \"No root file system is defined.  Please correct from partitioning menu.\"  This is my question - and I may be missing something, but I don't see how the question/answer I duplicated helps me with that problem.\n\nA: On an EFI-based computer, the EFI System Partition (ESP) is a FAT partition that holds boot loaders and related files. The firmware reads boot loaders from this partition to boot any OS. Although the EFI spec says that a computer can have multiple ESPs, the Windows installer tends to flake out if there's more than one ESP present, so it's advisable to use just one ESP per computer (or at least per disk; I'm not sure offhand how Windows responds to a two-disk computer when each disk has an ESP). Thus, you should keep your single-ESP configuration. In GParted, parted, and most other libparted-based tools, the ESP is identified as having the \"boot flag\" set. IIRC, the Ubuntu installer identifies it as an \"EFI boot partition.\" The GPT fdisk (gdisk, cgdisk, and sgdisk) utilities identify the ESP as having a type code of EF00.\nNote that you don't install Linux onto the ESP in any meaningful sense. You should create Linux partitions in the normal way on your GPT disk -- say, for swap, /, and /home. In the Ubuntu installer, you then mark the ESP as being the \"EFI boot partition.\" Alternatively, the various automated partitioning options do this automatically.\nWhatever you do, do not create a new filesystem on the ESP, and do not remove the \"boot flag\" from the ESP or set a \"boot flag\" on any other partition.\nUbuntu has long supported EFI installation and ESPs, and Ubuntu 13.04 is no exception to this rule. This support has been steadily improving, and it's probably better in 13.04 than in previous releases; however, there are still problems. At the moment, Secure Boot is the biggest problem area. Although Ubuntu 13.04 officially supports Secure Boot, there are a lot of problem reports about this combination, so many people prefer to disable Secure Boot in the firmware's setup utility.\n", "Q: creating domain in ubuntu server 12.10 I install ubuntu server 12.10 , I want to implement a domain on this server.\nhow can I implement domain ?\nI read the document of samba but i think this cannot solve my problem .\n\nA: I don't know what kind of domain you want that cannot be set up with Samba...

I have grabbed multiple cloud accounts for free ranging from 2gb to 50gb in size and I'd like to backup my data encrypted to those clouds. Some of these accounts includ dropbox, box.net, microsoft skydrive, google drive, and others. All of my systems are running Ubuntu 13.04 Raring. Any ideas?\n\nA: The downside to using a bunch of services is that your storage is fragmented, but a benefit in that is if you isolate the types of files you back up with each service, you know exactly where to find them.  The other downside is that you'll have a few apps running processes on your system all at once. For the most part this should work just fine so long as you don't try to alter files at the same time. \nThe only thing that I could find that comes close is called Duplicati.\n\nDuplicati is a free backup client that securely stores encrypted,\n  incremental, compressed backups on cloud storage services and remote\n  file servers.

You'd like to replace only a part of it, and leave the other matching parts unchanged.\nTo demonstrate with an example:\necho \"'some-name'@'some-host'\" | sed -r \"s/(')([^']+)('@'[^']*')/\\1user2\\3/g\"\n\nwill display:\n'user2'@'some-host'\n\nThe sed command performs the replacement by using the s/search-regexp/replacement/g syntax. In our case:\n\n\n*\n\n*(') matches the first single quote. This is trivial, but could be more complex. It represents the part of the string before the replacement. sed assigns the value of this sub-expression to the special variable \\1.\n\n*([^']+) matches the user name. Basically any character starting from the previous position that is not a quote. sed assigns the value of this sub-expression to the special variable \\2.\n\n*('@'[^']*') matches the '@'host-name' part. Similarly to the previous sub-expression, a quote, a @, a quote again and any character that is not a quote and then a quote at the end. sed assigns the value of this sub-expression to the special variable \\3.\n\n\nThe replacement part will replace anything that matched the search-regexp. By using the variables shown above, we can replace the user name and leave the other regions intact. \\1 + your new user name + \\3 will produce the desired result. Thus:\n\\1user2\\3\n\nResults in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Whatever contents the first sub-expression has, (it is a single quote)\n\n*followed by the string \"user2\", (note \\2 is intentionally not used, because we replace the user name)\n\n*and finally the contents of the 3rd sub-expression (which is a '@ and the host name in quotes).\n\n\nIf you cat your script file and pipe it to the sed command, you should get the desired result.\n\nA: Wrapping your sed command around speechmarks will work:\n\nadder@adamj-T1500:~$ cat sed_test \nuser1'@'localhost\nadder@adamj-T1500:~$ sed -i -e \"s/user1'@'localhost/user2'@'localhost/\" sed_test\nadder@adamj-T1500:~$ cat sed_test \nuser2'@'localhost\n\nThere's a number of different ways you can escape a single quote for a sed command, there's a number of questions with answers on stackoverflow:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/9112157/escaping-single-quotes\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/7990750/escape-single-quote\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/7517632/how-do-i-escape-double-and-single-quotes-in-sed-bash\n", "Q: Clementine Dark-Light Icons in Unity tray Do not matter which icon set I use, Ubuntu-Mono-Light or Ubuntu-Mono-Dark, the Clementine tray icon does not change.

I installed Ubuntu 13.04 without problems. Later, Windows 8 did a BIOS update which messed up everything, nothing would boot. I recovered everything and went back to fabric settings.\nNow Windows 8 works fine, but when I try to install Ubuntu it does not detect any operating system, so I can`t install Ubuntu alongside Windows.\nI`ve googled as much as I can, ran a boot-repair, disabled fast- and secure-boot. I have a GPT disc, been looking into gdisk without luck. \nHere`s my boot-repair summary http://paste.ubuntu.com/5835719/\nIs it necessary to convert the GPT disc to MBR? Is it possible to hard-reset the disc \"even more\" than fabric settings? \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: First, \"fabric\" is a flexible material used for making clothes, drapes, bedsheets, etc. Based on context, I suspect you mean \"factory\" or \"default,\" not \"fabric.\"\nSecond, you made things much harder for yourself by re-installing everything. You could have used an emergency boot disc like rEFInd's CD-R or USB flash drive image to get an OS or EFI shell booted, then used a utility like efibootmgr (in Linux), bcdedit (in Windows), or bcfg (in an EFI shell) to re-register your preferred boot loader(s) with the EFI. This approach requires a certain amount of know-how, but it's much easier than re-installing everything. You're well past the point where this remains an option, though. I mention it so you can keep less radical solutions in mind in the future.\nGiven where you are, it's not 100% clear to me precisely what's failing or why. I recommend you try the (poorly named) \"something else\" option when the Ubuntu installer gets to the point of asking how to install. That should enable you to re-size your existing partitions and create new ones for Linux. If the Ubuntu partitioner claims that your disk is empty, then that indicates a damaged partition table or leftover RAID data.

If you have requests that never end, you'll see them in a thread dump of Tomcat. You can do a thread dump by running kill -3 PID where PID is the process id of the Tomcat JVM. You can run ps aux | grep java to find the process id; it's the number in the 2nd column.\nHowever, if you're not seeing anything obvious in the Tomcat access logs already, then the network traffic might not be going to Tomcat.\nYou could try using tcpdump to monitor what network traffic you are getting whilst the spike is occurring. See the man page for more information.\nDepending on the cause of the spike, you might want to try asking on the AWS Developer Forums or on Server Fault where there is a larger population of system administrators.\n", "Q: Transmission torrent client very inconsistent speeds I have inconsistent download speed using the transmission bit torrent client.\nThe speed will vary greatly between 400kb and 1kb per second (My internet is crap 400kb is a acceptable maximum). I also noticed that even though hundreds of peers are available Transmission will only connect to about 20 at any time (I have set the connection limit to 200 per torrent and 500 max).\nI hope someone know a fix.\n\nA: It probably does not apply to your case, but a typical problem with torrent (and other p2p protocols) are routers, that cannot handle many simultaneous connections or that have issues if many connections are initiated in a short period of time. People often realize that they are affected by this issue, when they switch from Windows to some other operating system. The reason is that Windows has limits for simultaneous connections and new connections per second, and at least in earlier versions of Windows those were set to ridiculously low values per default, so people never realized that their router doesn't handle many simultaneous connections well.\nA symptom of this is, that not only the p2p downloads are slow, but also other internet connections like web-browsing are affected and show very low speeds while p2p software is running.\nIn such a case, it actually increases the p2p-download speed, if one limits the number of connections in the p2p software. Some p2p programs even offer a limit on the number of new connections per second (actually I only know one: mldonkey). I'd suggest to start with low values for these settings and then to increase them until issues arise (and then go back a little bit - in order to have stable conditions).\n", "Q: Change language encoding for file uploading Previously we were running a Wordpress site on a Mac OS Server machine.

In Ubuntu, I feel that when we create a new user, by default the root user's password will be assigned to the new user. Even then, reset and assign some new password to the newly created users. \nOnce after the user password reset and making the following changes in sshd_config, now I am able to connect all my systems (from my network) to remote server.\nPlease Note:\nI have switched off all SSH authentications (like RSAAuthentication, PubkeyAuthentication and KerberosAuthentication)..

If this user is preinstalled on the system it may be locked for  a reason (security  reasons), but I cannot decide that for you since this isn't a regular Ubuntu install apparently.\n\nIf the above makes you feel uncomfortable, you could create a separate user:\nsudo adduser username\n\nand answer the questions. You should be able to login just fine. Also make it able to become root (use sudo) by adding it to the sudo group:\nsudo adduser username sudo\n\nIn case you need to switch to the ubuntu user on the command line, you'll have to use your elevated privileges, because you can't provide credentials for the same reason as why you can't log in using SSH. Now, log in using SSH as username, and run this to become ubuntu:\nsudo su -l ubuntu\n\nFor security reasons I would not advise to use root to log in directly.\n\nA: This is not exact answer for this question. But In my case, there was redundant lines. (there were same line twice)\nPermitRootLogin yes\n\nand also \nAllowUsers otheruser\n\nYou should add 'root' user to this line or comment this line. \nAnd restart ssh service sshd restart\n\nA: I have a solution for you\nIn your sshd_config file you add this following line in the end of the file:\nAllowUsers senthil\n\nThis line will allow your server can connect to user's name: senthil. Another user will be denied.\nAfter that go to your terminal on your sever type this command:\nssh senthil@yourhostname\n\nDone!

For applications that you (for whatever reason) didn't install with the\nYou can examine the unity launcher icon, it may be able to tell you:\nThe launcher file will usually be located in /usr/share/applications/, and named something like my-application-launcher.desktop. If you don't know exactly what the file is called, use ls to examine the directory. (For your specific one, it is called wireshark.desktop.)\nOnce you know which one it is, examine its contents (anything from cat to gedit will work, but if you use gedit make sure to do it as gksu gksu gedit, not sudo gedit).\nThe file will contain an entry with something like Exec=command or Exec=/path/to/script.sh. If it only has a command, you can use which or locate (like @Rinzwind said) to get the full path for it.  Another option is to use whereis to find the binary or source location.\nThe directory containing the launcher's target should be the installation directory for the program.  If the launcher points to a shell script, sometimes examining its contents can reveal additional locations, if needed.\nRunning gksu nautilus when you get there will give you a windowed file browser with root permissions, meaning you can use it to copy/delete/edit any file, since normally installations are protected and will prevent you from modifying files as a normal user.\nIf that doesn't work, another option is to use find, to find anything with the same name, or grep, to find files containing the name.\nHowever, you should only do this if you don't have any better alternatives.

This is fine even though you might not have ever booted into those kernels. There are no cross-dependencies between the different kernel packages. Each kernel package only has dependencies for it's own version.\nSo, if you are currently using the \"3.2.0-24-generic\" version, I would advise you to remove the following kernel packages and the corresponding \"linux-headers\" packages:\nlinux-image-3.2.0-36-generic\nlinux-image-3.2.0-37-generic\nlinux-image-3.2.0-38-generic\nlinux-image-3.2.0-39-generic\nlinux-image-3.2.0-40-generic\nlinux-image-3.2.0-41-generic\nlinux-image-3.2.0-43-generic\nlinux-image-3.2.0-44-generic\n\nI always keep at least two older kernels, in case I ever need to go back.\n\nA: yes, you can safely uninstall old/unused kernels (images+headers), and this can free up a significant amount of disk space in some cases.\nmake sure to keep the currently used kernel and perhaps some older ones should you ever find the need to boot an older kernel because of a regression.\n", "Q: Update Manager on Ubuntu 12.04 I can't find the Update Manager when I tried searching it on the Dash Home bar.

The .bashrc file doesn't seem to do any good either. \nI am wondering how I can possibly modify my environment variables in this case. \n\nA: According to the Ubuntu documentation, they do not recommend using ~/.profile, instead they recommend using ~/.pam_environment for adding items to $PATH:\n~/.pam_environment - This file is specifically meant for setting a user's environment. It is not a script file, but rather consists of assignment expressions, one per line.\n\nPATH DEFAULT=${PATH}:${HOME}/MyPrograms\n\nA: You can configure your environment variables such as $PATH or $PS permanently for bash sessions in your .bashrc file that is your $HOME directory.\nif you need to set it permanently, and system wide (all users, all processes) add set variable in /etc/environment\n", "Q: Reboot ubuntu without a complete hardware reboot I would like to reboot the OS as if it is pulled up from GRUB, but without actually rebooting the entire computer.

The primary\n     difference between a standard system boot and a kexec boot is that\n     the hardware initialization normally performed by the BIOS or \n    firmware (depending on architecture) is not performed during a kexec\n     boot. This has the effect of reducing the time required for a reboot.\n...\nInsert the command-line parameters that must be passed to the new kernel into command-line-options. Passing the exact contents of /proc/cmdline into command-line-options is the safest way to ensure that correct values are passed to the rebooting kernel. \nNever tried kexec myself (except maybe during crashdump to load the dump kernel, but it was an automatic process), I would go to single user mode first to stop all the processes before running kexec .\n", "Q: Deluge daemon connection?

Why localhost is refusing connection and how do I connect to daemon? I have tried the command\nconnect 127.0.0.1 58846\n\nbut it doesnt seems to work.\n\nA: The most common reason is because you are running deluged as a different user to the one you are running deluge-console with. \nFrom the Deluge wiki: \n\nIf you are running deluged under another user you will need to\n  temporarily login as that user to enable deluge-console to access that\n  daemon's config:\nsu --shell /bin/bash --login deluge\n\n\n\nA: The most probable reason is that you are not running the daemon.

In my case I get\n$ apt-cache show evince | grep Conflicts\nConflicts: evince-gtk\n\n$ apt-cache show evince | grep Breaks\n<blank>\n\nso evince conflicts with evince-gtk that means they shouldn't be installed at the same time (APT will complain if this ever happens).\nIn my case evince doesn't declare to break any package so let's skip to gedit. Now, run\n$ apt-cache show gedit | grep Conflicts\n<blank>\n\n$ apt-cache show gedit | grep Breaks\nBreaks: gedit-plugins (<< 2.91)\n\nAs you can see gedit does not conflict with anyone. Nonetheless, it does break the package called gedit-plugins for versions strictly less than 2.91. That means gedit-plugins most be more recent than this version to work correctly with gedit and in particular APT will refuse to install gedit unless you remove gedit-plugins (<< 2.91) first.\nNotice that even though the gedit-plugins in the official repositories are recent enough, you might want to download (from github maybe) a particular GEdit plugin that is older, this line serves you as a remainder that this older version should not work with the current GEdit version.\nFor more details about package relationships (and the official definitions of Breaks and Conflicts) refer to Debian Policy Manual - Chapter 7.\n", "Q: Aruba VPN configuration for Ubuntu Server 12.04 I need to configure VPN client for Aruba Intranet Access.\nAruba provides VPN clients only for Windows, Mac and Android not for Linux.\nMay be someone can help me to configure Linux server?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: There is now a Linux client available for download.

What i'm missing in 12.04?\n\nA: From the desktop download page:\n\nUbuntu 12.04.2 LTS is a long-term support release. It has continuous hardware support improvements as well as guaranteed security and support updates until April 2017.\nUbuntu 13.04 will be supported for 9 months and includes cutting-edge new features that make your music, videos, documents and apps much easier to access.\n\nYou might choose 12.04 if you need stability and don't want to worry about upgrading or reinstalling your OS after a short period of time. Note that releases between the LTS versions are now only supported for 9 months, while the LTS versions are supported for 5 years..\nOn the other hand, you might choose 13.04 is you are interested in trying out the latest features and the newest apps. The releases between the LTS versions are now seen as a way to get new features and apps out there for testing and bug reporting.\n13.04 brings changes to the look, interaction with and management of online accounts, workspaces, and the Dash lenses. See new features in 13.04 at OMGUbuntu.\nA note on upgrading thanks to lgarzo:\nWhen it is time to upgrade, your upgrade paths will vary by which version you choose.\nLTS-versions come out every 2 years and are designed to upgrade to the next LTS-version. So with an LTS, you can upgrade to a cutting-edge system every 2 years, while maintaining stability.\nNon-LTS releases upgrade to the next available release, so in general you can stay more up-to-date, but you may have less stability.\nFinally, an LTS-version can also be upgraded to the next non-LTS, but doing this will convert the upgrade path to the same as a non-LTS.\n\nA: if you want everything to be the newest you shall choose the 13.04 but there shall be a new version available soon and you might have to upgrade to it. So if you want to get familiar with ubuntu better start with 12.04 LTS which will be supported with updates for longer period. \n", "Q: My Ubuntu Touch seems to be broken no matter how many different files I try So I'm planning on testing out Ubuntu Touch, and developing some applications for it so I thought I would flash it to my Nexus 4 that was already unlocked, and running Paranoid Android and the kernel associated.\nI headed to Ubuntu's website, browsed around and came across this page: Touch/Install - Ubuntu Wiki\nI followed Step 1 perfectly, word by word.

So it booted up and all seemed normal, but it wasn't.\nHere are some major bugs that only seem to happen to me.\n\nSo I was greeted with a normal lock screen:\nBut one of the first noticable things on the home screen is that I only have 4 tabs, not 5:\nSome of the applications that are supposed to work do not (I know some are dummies) like here with the calculator, this is what I get: \nOn the homescreen it is a black box, it will crash a couple of seconds later: \nAnother annoying problem is that when I want to close apps, I have from right to left, if I close an app on the left first it will close it, but it will open the app to it's right, weird: \nYet another bug, this one is in the pull down drawer, when you just click on it, you can see that not all the icons are there: \n\nPretty much everything else works as it should, but my main problem is that there is no telephony, I'm not sure how it works exactly, but I'm never asked a SIM code (I'm guessing you need that?), I can't compose SMS's and can't dial numbers, it won't let me select the 'Send' or 'Call' button.\nI've after tried manual installs all over the place with these files:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-touch-preview/daily-preinstalled/current/saucy-preinstalled-armel+mako.zip (Says 44MB on site - 46.6MB on my laptop)\n\n*http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-touch-preview/daily-preinstalled/current/saucy-preinstalled-phablet-armhf.zip (Says 366MB on site - 383.2MB on my laptop)\nThere are some weird size differences between what the site told me and what I downloaded, but I've tried re-downloading just to end up with the same file.\nAnd it just alway ends up with the same problems. No telephony and those weird bugs.\nSo my question is, how the hell can I get the same version as everyone else, with the ability to send texts and call and open the calculator and more?\nAlso, definitely running saucy: \nAnd maybe useful?

It loaded up fine but when I clicked on the Ubuntu logo purple and pink lines appeared on screen and they didn't go away so I thought that if I installed the OS it would be fine so I installed the OS, logged in and lo and behold the purple and pink lines where back.\nMy video card is nVidia N force (I think)\nAnyone having the same problem???\n\nA: I've seen purple and pink geometric artifacts on the Ubuntu desktop before. I discovered that the problem was due to a failing graphics card. Swapping the graphics card with another graphics card solved the problem. Generalizing from this experience, I recommend that you install the correct graphics drivers for your system with the following commands:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt remove '^nvidia'\nsudo apt autoremove\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall \nsudo reboot\n\nIf that doesn't work look for a way to temporarily swap your graphics card with another one for testing purposes.\n\nA: Graphics driver issues can cause the artifacts you describe. \nIf this is a fresh install, I'd recommend running\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n(to update the OS, including it's drivers)\nand then going to \"Additional drivers\", at the start, and see what Ubuntu offers.\nNow, to be completely honest, at my office we have 4 GeForce6100 cards (nForce chipset) and NONE of them work properly, with any driver, in Ubuntu 12.04. Using 3D mode causes random crashes that requiere logout/reboot, while 2D mode works OK. \nWe chose to stick to 2D using the current nvidia drivers (via sudo apt-get install nvidia-current and then sudo add-apt-repository ppa:x-swat && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade).\nGood luck!\n\nA: update your Nvidia driver.  To do so, open a command terminal window, and type:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\npress enter\nthen type\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\npress enter\nthen, reboot\n", "Q: xen issues in wubi ubuntu 12.10 I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my Windows 7 from Wubi.  Now I want to install Xen on it.\nI have searched a lot and read many blog.\nI tried to install but when I run a command xm list to check whether Xen is install or not it gives me error that it cant find hypervisor.\nUpdate grub command now not working as I have changed many things so should I reinstall from Wubi? \nIs installing Xen on  Wubi a problem?  Should I install Ubuntu from live CD or without Wubi?\nWill my windows crashed if install Ubuntu without Wubi?\nMy main objective is to install Xen on Ubuntu.Please help me\n\nA: XEN works with Wubi. When you install ubuntu-xen-server all you need do is change the /boot/xen parameters to /wubi/boot/xen in the primary operating system (so in this case Windows 7 and not the Wubi install). That should be the only thing you need to do.\nBut most manuals regarding XEN expect you have a dual boot kind of setup and not Wubi so if you do re-install I would go for a normal Ubuntu install.\n", "Q: How to increase the disk partition size? I desperately need to increase the size of a partition.I am running Ubuntu with dual boot(windows,no WUBI).\nTwo hard disk partition\nC: Windows\nD:I don't know how but D: is separated into 3 spaces.One contains Ubuntu-->Linux swap and NTFS.When right clicking on Ubuntu disk I am not getting any option to increase size.\nI want the safest solution. I can create space in C: or D: .\n \n\nA: Assuming that you need to increase the size of your Ubuntu partition (sda6) by 10GB, I can recommend the following steps:\n\n\n*Back up all your data.\n\n*Use an Ubuntu Live CD or USB to boot your computer (otherwise you\ncan't modify your Ubuntu partition as all partititons in use are locked).\n\n*Start GParted Partition Manager and unmount linux-swap partition\n(sda7) or any other as necessary.\n\n*Delete linux-swap partition (sda7).\n\n*Reduce the size of your next partition (sda7) to create an\nadditional 6.14GB free space before it (so as to sum up to 10GB\ntogether with the linux-sawp partition deleted). Please note that this (moving data in a large partition) might take quite a while (sometimes several hours?) and, more importantly, it is recommended to make a backup especially when changing the starting point of a partition as in this step.\n\n*Reduce the size of sda7 again this time to create a total of 4GB\nfree space after it together with the already existing unallocated\nspace at the end.\n\n*Create a linux-swap partition using the entire (~4GB) free space at\nthe end of the disk. (Please note that you might need to replace the UUID for swap in your /etc/fstab file with the new UUID after this step.)\n\n*Finally, you can enlarge your Ubuntu partition including the entire\n(~10GB) free space that has just been created between sda6 and sda5.\n\n\nA: Sadi's procedure is more-or-less correct, on cursory examination, although it will be necessary to edit /etc/fstab to point to the new swap partition's UUID if this procedure is followed.\nI'd like to add two points, though.\nFirst, you've got just under 40GiB of unused space in your filesystems, on a hard disk that's 465GiB in size. In other words, you've got just 8.5% free space. As a general rule, it's unwise to fill a disk beyond 90% full (a somewhat arbitrary figure, I admit), since efficiency drops off when a filesystem gets too full and because you may encounter an emergency or temporary need for extra space. Thus, I strongly recommend either deleting as many unused files as you can find or buying a new hard disk to either supplement or replace the current one. If this is a desktop system, you can get a 3.5-inch internal disk with twice your current disk's capacity for about $70. 2.5-inch disks for laptops are pricier; or you could go for an external disk, which would also add a bit to the cost.\nSecond, any operation that involves resizing a partition (especially by adjusting its start point, as Sadi's procedure does) or moving it is inherently risky. I don't recommend doing this unless you've got a backup of any important data on the disk. Although the failure rate is fairly low (probably well under 10%, and maybe under 1%, although I don't have hard data), the cost of failure is extremely high, since it's likely to become extremely tedious to recover any data, and some files might become unrecoverable. Of course, you should have a backup of any important data anyhow, but a backup is especially important when you undertake a risky operation like a partition resize or move.\n", "Q: How can I tell if all the hardware in my system has correctly installed drivers? I'm working on making the switch from Windows to Ubuntu.  Does Ubuntu have an equivalent to \"Device Manager\"?  What I want to do is check if all of the hardware in the machine has correctly installed drivers. (without having to run a plethora of individual lsusb, lspci, modprobe, etc.  I'm not quite there yet.)\n\nA: Dash, type in \"test\" and it will show a test suite.When started it will take a while collecting and then show this:\n\nIt will take a while but the end result will be a full report. \nBesides that... if you do no run into crashes or get error notices it basically works. Ubuntu (Linux in general) uses generic drivers. So if you can use it it works ;)\nFor you graphics card there is an alternative to go 3rd party (proprietary).\nDash, search for \"software & updates\":\n\n\nA: The situation is rather different with Linux, because most drivers are included with the kernel, so there's not the same need to compare what is installed and running with what is available from various websites. As long as you keep your package manager up to date, it will inform you of any updates.  \nBut you can install a package called hardware info, with it you can find a lot information about your hardware similar to device manager, and more.  You can generate a complete system report.\nPlus, if you haven't installed Ubuntu yet, you can choose try Ubuntu, to make sure that all your hardware is working.\n\nHere is a comparison between Hard Info, and System Testing\n\nA: You can also go to Start --> Additional drivers and then Ubuntu will report if there is any outdated or recommended driver. Remember that older and propietary drivers may show up, thats completely normal.\n", "Q: Is there a plugin that makes Rhythmbox Smart Playlists more like iTunes? I'm in the process of moving completely to Linux and I noticed that Rhytmboxs Smart Playlist functionality is lacking one key feature (for me at least), that's the sub arguments, (I think that's what they're called)\nIn iTunes there are two levels to the Smart Playlists but in Rhythmbox there is just one. Is there a plugin that will allow me this extra functionality.\n\nA: Not sure what exactly is meant with sub arguments to smart playlists and iTunes-like levels but the smart playlists in Rhythmbox can quite nicely be adapted to personal needs.\nOn creating a new automatic playlist or when editing a playlist the following window will let us add several selection criteria like \"Time of Last Play\", \"Rating\", \"Artist\" to name only a view:\n\nThis criteria can be set to match all criteria or if ticked to match any of these criteria for inclusion in a playlist of unlimited or limited number of songs. In addition we are able to sort the playlist from various criteria.\n", "Q: Compiling software generated with an old version of Qt Designer I'm trying to compile and install K3dsurf following the instructions in the \"Readme\", which says:\ntar -xvzf k3dsurf-0.6.2.tar.gz;\ncd k3dsurf;\nqmake; make;\n./bin/k3dsurf & ;\n\nThe problem is that when I execute make, the following error message appears:\n\ncd src/ && make -f Makefile \n  make[1]: Entering directory /home/miguel/Downloads/k3dsurf-0.6.2/src'\n  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/bin/uic k3dsurf.ui -o ui_k3dsurf.h\n  uic: File generated with too old version of Qt Designer (3.3)\n  File 'k3dsurf.ui' is not valid\n  make[1]: *** [ui_k3dsurf.h] Error 1\n  make[1]: Leaving directory/home/miguel/Downloads/k3dsurf-0.6.2/src'\n  make: * [sub-src-make_default] Error 2\n\nThanks\n\nA: The error message is telling you that the program depends on an outdated version of Qt Designer (3.3). In theory, that is fixable; but I would guess it would be just the first in a long chain of outdated dependencies.\nThe basic problem is that program has not been updated since 2007. Debian removed the package from both testing and unstable in June, 2012. Ubuntu removed the package from 12.10 both because Debian did so and because it depends on obsolete Qt3 libraries.\nk3dsurf is, however, available in the Universe repository in 12.04. If you are already running 12.04 or can install 12.04 to a new partition or to an external drive, that is your best bet for using the program. \nThe most recent version 0.6.2.4-1 is available directly from the Software Center, so you won't need to worry about installing from source. \nUpdate: The OP stated in a comment that the k3dsurf Windows version runs fine under Wine.\nGiven that the software is fairly old and is using an older version of Qt, it may a good idea to be aware of security risks with Wine, no matter how unlikely they may be.\nThe Wine FAQ on risks states:\n\nJust because Wine runs on a non-Windows OS doesn't mean you're protected from viruses, trojans, and other forms of malware. \n\nSecuring Wine on the Wine Wiki warns:\n\nWine doesn't support most Windows security constructs, and instead relies on the underlying operating system for security. Unless you run Wine as root, for instance, it's hard for malicious software in Wine to modify files belonging to other users. But Wine doesn't protect you against malware you run yourself. \n\nBoth pages go on to list several ways to improve security.\n", "Q: how do I remove a startup application from the command line?

I am using muon as a packet manager with Kubuntu. Normally everything works just fine, but I have some difficulties with LaTex packages. muon does not seem to find the latest versions. \nOn CTAN there is a version from June 2013, while muon tells me that my version from 2012 is up to date. \nI could install it manually, of course; but it is not that practical since I use LaTex a lot and would like to have all updates as soon as possible. \nI noticed that it is possible to add new repositories to muon, and I considered adding the whole CTAN directory to the muon sources. But I do not know if that is necessary or even possible, plus I don't really understand the menu for adding repositories. \n\nA: No. CTAN is not an Ubuntu package repository.

Look especially at the set of links under the C++ extensions section. Please note that these examples are specifically for Qt 4.8. Please also see Porting QML Applications to Qt 5\nAlso see Integrating QML and C++ in Qt 5.0.\nRunning Native Desktop Apps\nAs for problem of running a desktop app written in C++ with a QML GUI as opposed to calling C++ from QML, I think the problem you are running into is that Ubuntu Touch is an ongoing project and that many planned features are not yet implemented.\nI believe the following information shows that what you want to do will be possible eventually, but that right now native C++ apps may need to run as console based.\nFrom the Touch FAQ:\n\nUbuntu Touch is primarily designed to support web apps, and native apps programmed in qml and javascript or C++. As it is a real linux, of course all non graphical applications run equally as on any other linux system. You can ssh to Ubuntu Touch and run any console based application.\nX11 is not supported (so far) so all GUI standard applications will not run.\nUbuntu Touch is a real linux, of course you can install a c compiler and all the rest of the essential-build system and can develop on the mobile devices like on any other linux.\n\nFrom the XDA Developers FAQ:\n\nYes, native apps can be written in C++/Qt, or QML/Javascript. We provide a UI Toolkit with native widgets that you can use in your apps.\nThe desktop shell (Unity 7) will be re-implemented in the same codebase as Ubuntu Touch (Unity 8), so that there will be one \"Unity\" that can change the way it looks and behaves depending on the kind of device it is running on. For app developers, the platform will be the same, the APIs will be the same, they won't need to maintain separate versions of their app.\n\nYou can also view the status of features in the Ubuntu SDK. Most features are still In Progress or TODO\n", "Q: Can I install ubuntu over Vista on a laptop computer? Can I install ubuntu OS over the Vista OS on a Compaq laptop.  Are there any instructions out there for this???\n\nA: Check out the WUBI installer: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer \nThis gives you the impression that you are installing Ubuntu 'over' your existing OS. In reality, it's just a nifty tool that does replaces the legwork need to go the old fashioned route of having a 'dual-boot' setup in which you have a separate disk partition (or physical disk) for each OS you want. There is a selection screen (called a bootloader) after the BIOS at which point you can select which OS you'd like to boot.\nThe only way to truly have one OS 'over' another OS is to use virtualization of some sort. There are many options here.

In my university, we want to create Metapackages to provide all the software used in the differents careers, and signatures.\n¿We can do this? I ask because recently I read this:\n\"Note: We will not accept uploads of packages that are unmodified from their original source in Ubuntu or Debian, only packages that include your own changes. We ask that people include useful changelogs for each package so that users and other developers can understand what new features they are exploring in their work. Read the PPA Terms of Use for more information.\"\nhttps://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA/Uploading\nBasicly we don't want to change the source code of the package, we only want to do a \"compilation\".\n\nA: You can upload a metapackage to a PPA on Launchpad, yes. As a metapackage contains no actual source code, and only results in an empty binary package (or multiple empty binary packages), that only depend on other packages, you must upload a source package which contains your own modifications, as you are creating the source package and specifying what the metapackage names are, what they depend on, and the other relevant metadata.\n", "Q: I need to use sudo for any Hadoop operation, how to change permissions? I am self learning Hadoop, starting yesterday.\nFor the purpose of learning, I have set up Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit on VMWare Fusion on my MacBook Pro. And I am following this excellent tutorial. Before this I have never used Ubuntu as a development platform.\nSo far I have managed to set up Hadoop and have successfully run the WordCount example. But along the way, I have to use sudo to do anything, e.g. starting up Hadoop services:\n/usr/local/hadoop/hadoop-1.1.2/bin/start-all.sh\n\nnever works, giving exceptions, but\n    sudo /usr/local/hadoop/hadoop-1.1.2/bin/start-all.sh\nworks fine. Same is the case with stop-all.sh and for practically anything else.\nAdditionally, while starting Hadoop services, the OS asks for password multiple times (once before starting each component) and same happens when I use stop-all.sh.\nI could not copy the downloaded files to /usr/local/hadoop using the UI. I had to copy them using the terminal using sudo.\nIf I open '/usr/local' in the UI, there is no permission to copy, move, delete or create new folder. And I searched how to change permissions, but for this folder, the owner is not the logged in user, but it was root, so the UI for setting permissions was disabled. And one cannot log in as root and use the UI logged in as root.\nAlso when came the stage of adding congfigurations to /usr/local/hadoop/bin/start-all.sh, conf/mapred-site.xml and conf/hdfs-site.xml, I could not save the edits using GEdit, and had to make changes using nano (preceded by sudo), which was again due to permissions.\nOne thing different in my setup is that instead of /usr/local/hadoop/, I have used /usr/local/hadoop/hadoop-1.1.2/ as the extraction folder of Hadoop.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to add to permissions so that I can use the UI, and GEdit or any\neditor of my choice?\n\n*How to make all the commands run without sudo?\n\n*And a slightly non-related question, what is the best IDE for\nHadoop? Coming from Visual Studio and XCode, I am looking for a free\nIDE which I can use while getting used to of doing things using the\nterminal and using GEdit for simple changes in the code?\n\n\nA: Have you tried\nchown -R yourusername /usr/local/hadoop\n\nto sort the permissions? This should change ownership of those folders and files to your user, allowing you to change things in those folders without using root/sudo.\nRegarding an IDE, I have nothing but good words for Geany IDE: www.geany.org\n", "Q: How does the Display Server - Display Manager - Window Manager structure exactly work? I would Like to know what exactly each does and how they are layered/structured or interrelated to each other, their functions, their interdependence, their communication protocols and when and why they interact and all that stuff!\ni would really appreciate a detailed answer, for 2 reasons -\nm not very well at this part. the display servers and all, and, all users who encounter this question and the answer can know everything!\nThankyou! :)\n\nA: An X Windows server provides a very basic graphical environment, usually connected to a monitor, a mouse and a keyboard.\nA display manager (DM) is just the login screen, which runs in its own X windows server session.  When you log in, the DM will usually start an entirely fresh X session and will also start the window manager (or desktop environment) that you have chosen.  \nThere are many window managers (WM) available for X.  These provide the basics of handling switching and focusing windows, positioning, resizing and decorations (or no decorations in the case of twm/ratpoison/awesome).\nA desktop environment (DE) usually provides a window manager but a bunch of other stuff too: panels, start button, applets for volume, network etc.  They provide an environment in which everything looks similar and easily recognisable, and provide GUI tools that allow you to do many admin tasks without having to type in a terminal.  They often provide a display manager too, for a consistent end-to-end experience.  And in the case of Gnome and KDE, a full suite of applications too!\nSo hackers can survive with just a window manager, but general computer users prefer a desktop environment where everything is integrated in a familiar style.\nThe fun thing is, thanks to Unix's philosophy of decoupling components, and since the only common required component is X windows, you can mix and match the rest if you want to.  You could use Trinity KDE's display manager but ask it to run the Fluxbox window manager when you log in, and then startup LXDE's panel (lxpanel) to provide some icons, applets and a workspace pager.  You could even run bbkeys to perform window management actions using your favourite keybindings, and keep using it if you switch to a different WM later!  :)\n(A setup like that can be achieved with configuration in .fluxbox/startup or in .xinitrc if you skip the DM and just run startx from the console.)\nFinally, many window managers will let you switch to a different window manager via their menu (sometimes found by right-clicking the desktop), without restarting the X session or losing any of your windows!  This is great when you want to try out some WMs to see which one you like most.  Sadly modern Desktop Environments don't seem to bother with this cool feature.\nSome distributions will offer you a failsafe login, which may provide an x-terminal with no window manager.  From there you can boot a window manager, kill it, start a DE, kill that, start a new window manager etc.  The X session itself will not close until that x-terminal does.\n\nA: You may find partial enlightenment at the following link: http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/xwtf.html\nOther great reading on the subject comes from WikiPedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System\nHopefully these resources will give you a good primmer.\n", "Q: The package system is broken: can not update or install new packages I am not new to Ubuntu, but I don\"t know what to do with the following:\nsudo apt-get -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=yes dist-upgrade\nReading package lists...

If you can help me in any way it would be awesome, this problem is really bugging me!\n\nA: The screenshot is virtually unreadable due to lack of color contrast, but it seems that the reason for the problem is simply that the font being used does not contain glyphs for the characters ☁ or ☂. A little box is typically the way programs indicate the presence of a character that has been recognized but cannot be displayed due to lack of a glyph.\nThis explanation sounds problematic, because xrvt FAQ says: “When rxvt-unicode sees a character, it will first look at the base font. If the base font does not contain the character, it will go to the next font, and so on.” So it should find a glyph if any available font contains it. But presumably this process goes wrong, e.g. because character repertoire information in some font is faulty (a font may say it supports a character but lacks a glyph for it). Testing with different base font settings may help to identify the problem.\n", "Q: how do install windows 8 in ubuntu?

(Select the new user acct. on the left first)\n\nYou will be presented with the following, just enter the new password in the new password box and the repeat it in the confirm box.  The current password for a new account is blank so you don't enter anything in that box.  The final step is to click the Change box.

You need to use a combination of sudo with passwd like this:\nuser@user-ubuntu1:~$ sudo passwd\n[sudo] password for user: # enter your sudo password here\nEnter new UNIX password: # enter the password you want for your su password here\nRetype new UNIX password: # reenter your new su password\npasswd: password updated successfully\n\nAnd there you have it - no more errors.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses sudo\nso \nsudo ./eset_nod32av_64bit_en.linux\n\nSee: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for details.\n", "Q: deleting a file from an user account when only the guest account is accessible I was trying stuff and my cousin (owning applestuff) sent me a bash_profile file.\nI replaced it with my old profile file (the one you find in home, .profile) - I backed up the existing one as \".profile (old)\"\nI am now unable to sign in to my account, and can only log in using the guest account.

Everything seemed fine until I rebooted. Suddenly, my trackpad stopped functioning, and I couldn't view available wireless networks anymore. I've run this command many times to update packages, and I have no idea how to go about diagnosing the problem. I also don't have access to a wired network to see if running another update fixes the issue. I do have a live USB but wouldn't know how to go about using it to resolve the problem.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Posting the solution I found for the sake of others:\nI checked and could not find the device for either my trackpad or my wireless card, so I decided to try reinstalling the driver. I came across http://kuscsik.blogspot.com/2007/06/how-to-install-intel-4965-wireless.html which explained how to install the driver for my computer (Dell Inspiron 1720). I only had to run the one command sudo modprobe iwl4965, and my wifi immediately started working again. I ran sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get upgrade, rebooted, and then the trackpad worked perfectly as well.\n", "Q: How do I completely remove Evolution? The looping of Evolution factories slow the system to sudden and lengthy halts. When I access the System  Monitor I can stop the individual processes that cause the problem. These processes are as follows;\nevolution-source-registry\n\nnotably,\n    evolution-addressbook-factory\nOnce evolution-addressbook-factory is stopped the processes are eventually replaced by similarly named processes, but the looping stops. When I connect to Thunderbird it slows substantially. Initially I used evolution mail when running Ubuntu 12.10 but removed it and have been using Thunderbird.\nMy laptop specs are:\nUbuntu 13.04 32-bit\n2.0 GHz (dual core, both cores at 2.0 GHz)\n1GB RAM\nAfter carrying out the recommended procedures for complete removal I recieved a cache read error after removing evolution from the package manager entirely. Re-downloading the packages in the package manager enabled email recognition and produced the error seen in the screenshot.\n\nA: None of the above helped me, as e-addressbook-factory was continuing to run and take 99% of CPU even after the purge command.  The executable lives in /usr/lib/evolution:\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 10544 Jul 30  2013 camel-index-control-1.2\n-rwxr-sr-x 1 root mail 14664 Jul 30  2013 camel-lock-helper-1.2\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 27760 Jul 30  2013 e-addressbook-factory\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 31984 Jul 30  2013 e-calendar-factory\n\nAs a last resort I moved the folder out of the way with this:\nsudo mv /usr/lib/evolution /usr/lib/evolution-fu\n\nAnd now it has stopped running.\n\nA: Removing is too messy (because a lot of other packages depend on it even if they don't use its functionality), but disabling is relatively straightforward.\nIdeally this should be done using dpkg-divert (but that has a problem with diverting to the same file), to not confuse apt/dpkg when you upgrade your system.\ncd /usr/share/dbus-1/services\n# This part create a copy of your original files\nsudo cp org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.AddressBook.service org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.AddressBook.service.backup\nsudo cp org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.Calendar.service org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.Calendar.service.backup\nsudo cp org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.Sources.service org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.Sources.service.backup\nsudo cp org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.UserPrompter.service org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.UserPrompter.service.backup\n\n# This part does the trick\nsudo ln -snf /dev/null org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.AddressBook.service\nsudo ln -snf /dev/null org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.Calendar.service\nsudo ln -snf /dev/null org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.Sources.service\nsudo ln -snf /dev/null org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.UserPrompter.service\n\nIf we just delete the file or use any empty file the next update/upgrade will put them back. So we're using a symlink to an empty file (/dev/null is a special empty file, it stays empty even if you write something into it).\nHere you find an article about what /dev/null is.\n\nA: on Ubuntu 19.04 to stop evolution:\n#!/bin/bash\nchmod -x /usr/libexec/evolution-addressbook-factory\nchmod -x /usr/libexec/evolution-calendar-factory\nchmod -x /usr/libexec/evolution-data-server/evolution-alarm-notify\nchmod -x /usr/libexec/evolution-source-registry\n\n\nA: apt install gnome-session && apt purge evolution && apt autoremove\n\n\n\n*\n\n*part will only mark gnome-session as manually installed,\n     so it doesn't get removed by 3rd part\n     (gnome-core depends on gnome-session)\n\n*part will remove evolution\n(gnome-core depends on evolution, so gnome-core will be removed as well)\n\n*part will purge all packages which the system considers as not needed\n     (without step 1 this would have removed gnome-session as well)\n\n\nA: To remove Evolution, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove evolution evolution-exchange evolution-plugins evolution-common evolution-webcal\n\nThe above command will not remove evolution-data-server, evolution-data-server-common\nI would recommend that you use Synaptic Package Manager to completely remove Evolution.  Just search for it, and mark it for complete removal.\nAlso just to be sure, after removing do:\nsudo rm /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications/evolution\n\nNow keep in mind that removing evolution, will also remove gnome panel.  to install just do:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-panel\n\n\nA: With Ubuntu 18.04 (and probably 16.04) you can't get rid of Evolution without getting rid of GNOME, so your best bet is to disable it.\nBuilding on PAStheLoD's answer and its comments, I wrote a script to disable the evolution services and to inform dpkg/apt of the changes so they aren't wiped out on upgrades.  Hopefully, this will help those of you who, like me, script your system setup just in case you need to reinstall. \nI tested this on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n##\n## Disables the Evolution mail program's services by moving the services files\n## to another directory.\n##\n## This must be run as root.\n##\n\nSERVICES_HOME=\"/usr/share/dbus-1/services\"\nDISABLED_DIR=\"$SERVICES_HOME/disabled\"\n\n\nexitOnError()\n{\n    local errorCode=$1\n    local errorMessage=\"$2\"\n\n    echo \"$errorMessage\"\n    exit $errorCode\n}\n\n\nmain()\n{\n    # Make sure that we are running as root and that the services directory didn't change!\n    if !

I have this N52TE keyboard from when I used it on my Windows, it works out of box fine but it only acts as the left side of a normal keyboard, is there a way to edit custom buttons on Linux? There is no official driver for Linux.\n\nA: The author of Keyboarding Master generously added support for the N52TE after I asked about it recently. It is supported in a developer preview, and I can confirm it works!\nI'm unsure whether the developer preview can be installed alone, without previous drivers being installed to root. I have an official release installed to /opt, and then ran the preview from a folder in /home. At any rate, I suspect a full release with N52TE support will happen and resolve this uncertainty.\nIf you are running Ubuntu with Unity, there's a chance the 'taskbar' icon for the program may not appear. I would suggest keeping the main window open, and not hidden, so you don't lose your interface to disable and configure the drivers. If this happens, though, you'll have to kill the process from the terminal.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to use Gnome's extensions (silent installation failure) I tried asking this in the Unix & Linux stackexchange, but this may be a better place.\nI have been trying to install some Gnome extensions from the site https://extensions.gnome.org.

You must open a Terminal, for instance, by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal and run the follwing command:\n$ sudo mv -f -i <Source> <Destination>\n\nThe -f option will force the move. The -i will instruct mv to ask for permission before overwrite some file.

I want to try out Kubuntu but I don't want to over write my Ubuntu with Kubuntu.\n\nA: Ubuntu flavors or derivatives\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuFlavors\n\nIntroduction to Flavors\nThe difference between the flavors are in the set of packages\n  installed. However, all flavors of Ubuntu use the same repository for\n  downloading updates, so the same set of packages is available\n  regardless of which flavor you have installed...\n\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/derivatives\n\nDerivatives Ubuntu is a popular operating system and a popular\n  starting point for people who want to create their own operating\n  systems.\nDerivatives of Ubuntu include local-language and hardware-specific\n  versions...\n\nKubuntu\nhttp://www.kubuntu.org/\n\nKubuntu is based on free software from many\n  communities of developers including:   \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*KDE Software, applications that\n  give you power   \n  \n*Plasma, KDE's desktop and netbook workspaces   \n  \n*Linux, an operating system kernel taking over the world   Debian, supplying\n  most of our packages   \n  \n*Ubuntu, turning free software into distributions such as Kubuntu\n\nKDE\nhttp://www.kde.org/\n\nThe KDE® Community is an international technology team dedicated to\n  creating a free and user-friendly computing experience, offering an\n  advanced graphical desktop, a wide variety of applications for\n  communication, work, education and entertainment and a platform to\n  easily build new applications upon...\n\nInstalling KDE or Kubuntu\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingKDE\nRemoving desktop enviroments\nHow to completely remove desktop?\nHow to remove desktop environments?\n\nA: Install the KDE window manager.

The basic ubuntu install uses one desktop (based on gnome) but there are others like KDE (which kubuntu uses) and XFace and many others that determine how the information on the system is displayed, how much memory they use, how configurable they are etc. etc.\nThe one constant with Linux is that there are 100 ways to skin a cat, you should try several of them if your new and find the way to skin the cat you like.\n\nA: It's a desktop interface.  Ubuntu will install Unity desktop by default.  If you select Kubuntu, it will install KDE desktop instead of Unity desktop.\n", "Q: Wubi downloads ISO even though it's already there I am trying to install Ubuntu on Windows 8. My system does not have the SecureBoot and UEFI option. I downloaded the Ubuntu 12.04 ISO from the website. It contains wubi.exe, but when I run Wubi it starts downloading the Ubuntu ISO again. \nI tried the option of putting the ISO and wubi.exe in an empty folder and then running it, but it still downloads a new ISO. Why can't it use the ISO I already have?\n\nA: Most possibly you have downloaded (the default downlaod) a 32 bit ISO where as your machine support 64bit. So wubi detects it and tries to download 64bit ubuntu ISO.\nTo force using 32bit, open the folder where you stored wubi.exe and ISO. Now right click while pressing Shift, click on Open a command window here\nNow execute Wubi.exe with parameter --32bit, the command should be like Wubi.exe --32bit\nFew more points for troubleshooting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are not using dvd/ alternative ISO. Those are not supported by wubi.\n\n*ISO not corrupt.\n\n*Download wubi from http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/wubi.exe\n\n*5GB free space is required.\n\n\nMore FAQs and details : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu support SATA drives in AHCI mode? I have a current installation of Ubuntu 13. Will it boot if I switch my SATA controller to AHCI in BIOS? (I installed Ubuntu in IDE mode) I have to wait until I fix my GRUB (Windows ate it), so I thought I'd take a poll here first in case there are any precautions. I ask, because it was a royal PITA to do it in Windows. Will I need to reinstall Ubuntu to enable this? I don't mind doing that since it was just installed and I having nothing on it yet, and I kinda botched the install anyway.\n\nA: You will generally have no problem with Ubuntu when you enable AHCI mode, because it detects this mode automatically. In Windows 7, you have to patch one registry value. And in Windows XP you should install Intel Matrix Storage Manager. I don't consider it is a painful problem though it needs some researching.\n", "Q: Upgrade to 13.04 was not successful. Gstreamer not working. What do? I finally decided to upgrade to 13.04.

Click Dash (in the top left) and search for GParted. When the application opens up, on the top right, you should see a drop down arrow to scroll between different hard drives. Scroll between all of them, and (assuming you don't have any important data on this computer), delete all of the partitions so you can start fresh. You can do this by highlighting a partition and clicking the X, then the checkmark to verify that you want to delete the partition. Again, please be sure that the partition doesn't contain anything important before you delete it.. When this is all done, it should say unformatted or unallocated. After you have erased your previous Ubuntu installation, click Install Ubuntu, and go through those steps.

I have the following problem.\nRecently I have installed vim (which I compiled myself, as the one in the Ubuntu repositories are old). With it I installed Cscope and You-Complete-Me plugins.\nNow everytime Ubuntu checks for updates, it wants to \"upgrade\" my vim and the vim You-Complete-Me plugin stops working (because it actually downgrades my vim...).\nHow can I tell Ubuntu to mind it's own bussiness and stop \"upgrading\" my vim? I don't want to deselect boxes each time there is some system update...\nUPDATE: I have installed vim using the steps provided here: https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source\n\nA: To hold your installed version, prevent the package manager from automatically updating it in the future running this command in terminal:\necho \"<packagename> hold\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\nChange <packagename> with what package you wish (in your case may be vim).\n\nA: You can set packages to be on hold.\n\nhold —  A package marked to be on hold is not handled by dpkg, unless forced to do that with option --force-hold.\n\nBasically packages on hold will not be upgraded (or as apt says: will be „kept back”).\nHere is an easy way to set any package on hold.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the selection state of the packages by running dpkg --get-selections >selections.txt\n\n*Edit your selections.txt file and search for the package name you do not want to get updated. Replace the text at the second column holding the state from install to hold. Save the file.\n\n*Apply the your customized selections by running sudo dpkg --set-selections <selections.txt.\n\n\nNow run sudo apt-get upgrade and the package should not be upgraded anymore.\n\nA: The dpkg-hold tool does the same as @lgarzo described, but in more convenient manner. You can install it using sudo apt-get install dlocate. Then run sudo dpkg-hold packagename and it will become hold.\n\nA: An arguably better solution would be not to install vim over the existing binary installed by Ubuntu's package manager in the first place. This is always a bad idea and it is going to bite you sooner or later.\nThe files in /usr/bin, /usr/lib are managed by Ubuntu and if you want it to mind its own business you should not put your stuff in there. You can put your own hand-compiled binaries in /usr/local, /opt or even your home directory.\nThe offending bit in the instructions is --prefix=/usr - removing it should install vim in /usr/local - then you'll need to modify the rest of the instructions to account for the new location.\n(also, the fact that Ubuntu overrides your binary suggests that you haven't removed the system vim before overriding it with yours - which the instructions you linked to actually mention)\n", "Q: gdb uses wrong python When I launch gdb (on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS) it immediately crashes with the following output:\nBlockquoteTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 562, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 544, in main\n    known_paths = addusersitepackages(known_paths)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 271, in addusersitepackages\n    user_site = getusersitepackages()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 246, in getusersitepackages\n    user_base = getuserbase() # this will also set USER_BASE\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 236, in getuserbase\n    USER_BASE = get_config_var('userbase')\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py\", line 577, in get_config_var\n    return get_config_vars().get(name)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py\", line 476, in get_config_vars\n    _init_posix(_CONFIG_VARS)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py\", line 337, in _init_posix\n    makefile = _get_makefile_filename()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py\", line 331, in _get_makefile_filename\n    return os.path.join(get_path('platstdlib').replace(\"/usr/local\",\"/usr\",1), \"config\" + (sys.pydebug and \"_d\" or \"\"), \"Makefile\")\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'pydebug'\n\nFrom these two similar questions\ngdb cannot run due to python error\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/10641201/attributeerror-module-object-has-no-attribute-pydebug\nit seems gdb catches the wrong python install?\nHow do I know which python gdb should use and where do I set which is used?\nI have one python in /usr/lib/python2.7 and one in /opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7.\nI have previously used gdb successfully on this machine.\nThanks!\n\nA: You can't configure which Python it should use without building from sources; all you can do is run something like:\nreadelf -d $(which gdb) | grep python\n\nto find out which Python it uses.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Partition after installation I have already installed Ubuntu 12.04 with all the space allocated to just one drive in which Ubuntu is installed.

This questions on how to use bind in your lan should help.\nFailing that, there are a number of questions regarding bind already.\n\nA: If it is for just local use, you can just put the IP address entry into your hosts file.  You can make up any domain name you want for this.\nOn modern Windows, that is c:/Windows/drivers/etc/HOSTS\nOn linux, the file is /etc/hosts.\nFor the rest of the world, you will want a registered domain.  Then you can use your domain registrar's control panel to point it to your computer's IP address.\n\nA: If for instance port defined in Apache is 8080, this can be done by assigning this port in the router to your machine. All requests to yourdomainname:8080 will go to your machine where Apache is installed. Another means is by using a DMZ defined in the router.\n", "Q: USB Stick became Read-Only after using Pen Drive USB Installer Yesterday I tried to make my 16Gb USB Stick bootable with Ubuntu 13.04 (Desktop x64).

But no standard user can ever create a new user account.\nThe user created when you install Ubuntu is an administrator, not a standard user. You should always have at least one administrator account--if you were to make all the users standard users, then you would be unable to perform any administrative tasks (though this can be fixed).\nPerhaps you have an administrator who you want to be a standard user? If so, you can change that in any of the same places where you'd create new user accounts. If that's not working, make sure the user who you want to be a standard user is not a member of the admin or sudo groups. (The adm group is different; you don't have to remove someone from that to keep them from being an administrator.)\nIf that doesn't work or you need help doing that, then please edit your question to provide as much additional information as possible, including the output of groups username run in a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), where username is the name of the user you're interested in.\n", "Q: Set background for Page{} element in ubuntu touch How can I set the Background (picture or color) of The Page{} element in ubuntu touch?\nThank You,\nBoaz\n\nA: As far as I know, you can't directly set the color of a page, unless you created a rectangle to fill the background of the page. However, if you want to set the color of the MainView, you can do it as follows:\nMainView {\n    backgroundColor: \"<COLOR_HERE>\"\n}\n\nThere are also two other properties, headerColor, and footerColor, that allow you to create a gradient from the top to the bottom.\nThis won't work perfectly, since it changes the font colors, and the while the font color looks good on the background, it looks bad in popups where the background is white. I'm sure this will get fixed soon!\nTo set a picture, you can do something like this:\nMainView {\n    Image {\n        anchors.fill: parent\n        source: \"/path/to/picture\"\n    }\n}\n\nI'd recommend still setting the background color of the MainView so the font colors look good on top of the picture.\nIf you want to do change the background color/picture for a page, you can do it as follows (I haven't tried this, but it should work):\nPage {\n    Image {\n        anchors.fill: parent\n        source: \"/path/to/picture\"\n    }\n}\n\nPage {\n    Rectangle {\n        anchors.fill: parent\n        color: \"<COLOR_HERE>\"\n    }\n}\n\n", "Q: How can i prevent standard user from accessing terminal? How can i prevent/restrict standard users from accessing terminal in ubuntu-12.04.2-desktop-i386 ?\nI need to prevent standard users and administrators(not root account) in Ubuntu user accounts from accessing terminal.I am doing a R&D for \"ubuntu Desktop management\"that is to be done through our Network monitoring software\n\nA: If you are looking to ban users that you allow to log in from using a terminal for security reasons, it does not make much sense. \"The Terminal\" is  a tool that will allow you to perform certain actions that you have rights to do. If you take away the right to run \"the terminal\" (which is actually just another program), the right to perform these actions is not taken away. A user could simply run another program (downloaded?) to perform these actions.\nNow if you want to block other users (non-standard I would call them) from loging in at all (be it via the normal method, or via 'the terminal'), you could change the shell line in /etc/passwd to something like /sbin/nologin: this user will not be able to log in.\nExample (I can't stress enough that this is probably not what you want for normal users, but it is the only way I can see use for the question. proceed with care)\nnologinuserx:111:123:description,,,:PATH:/bin/false\nnormaluser:1123:1123:,,,:/home/myname:/bin/bash\n\nI'm currently using /bin/false instead of nologin it seems, but that's how it looks\nAs @gertvdijk mentions in the comments, you could (should?) do this with the chsh (CHange SHell) command like so:\n$ sudo chsh -s /usr/sbin/nologin username\n\n", "Q: tmux becomes unresponsive when tailing a quickly updated file I have a log file that I am writing a few hundred lines to a second. I want to tail this in a tmux pane. \nHowever, when I do this tmux becomes unresponsive - I can't change panes or windows and I can't even CTRL+C to stop tail. \nAfter about 3 or so minutes tail will eventually be killed by CTRL+C and I will regain control - but until then I can't do anything (except change from terminal to another window such as my browser).\nIs there anyway to resolve this? I suspect that the issue is being caused because so many lines are being written to the log file.\n\nA: The problem is more likely to be tmux overhead, especially if you've got a vertical split on your pane. You can set tmux to not update the screen when there are a bunch of control characters being written. See man tmux for more details, but I have the following in my ~/.tmux.conf.\nset -g c0-change-trigger 20 #default is 250\nset -g c0-change-interval 1000 #default is 100\n\nThis tells tmux that when 20 control sequences per milliseconds are being printed to the screen, tmux should change it's update interval to once per 1000 milliseconds (1/sec).\n\nA: This has been greatly improved in tmux 2.1. \nThe c0- options metioned in other answers have been removed and a back off approach to buffering introduced: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmux/tmux/master/CHANGES\n\nA: This is NOT likely to be caused by tailing log file which is being written a few hundred times per second.\nTry to ssh to the box or open another terminal session, use strace to attach to the tmux process, see the system calls made by and signals received by the process. This will definitely help.\nExample:\nstrace -tT -pPID\nOutput to a file\nstrace -tT -pPID -o /path/to/tmux_output\n\nNOTE: strace is a light-weight debugger, it helped me to solve several tmux related problem in the past, e.g. tmux not able to create / remove files/directories in /var/run or /run.\n\n\nA: I know that this will not solve your problem, but try to pipe the output of the command to either less or more:\n\n\n*\n\n*less allows you to scroll from within even a non-scrollable terminal:\n<command> | less\n\n\n*more prints a page then you press enter to bring up every line after that:\n<command> | more\n\n", "Q: How to restrict standard users from accessing system setting in ubuntu-12.04 desktop? I need to restrict/prevent standard users from accessing \"system settings\" in UI \n?\n\nA: You can't really restrict that since there are user specific settings in \"System Settings\" - If you are scared of someone changing something, as long as they are a standard user they can't change any system-wide settings. If you really wanted to remove their access to \"System Settings\", you could move the executable to somewhere not in $PATH, and set your $PATH to match the new directory.\n", "Q: Wifi Direct P2P-go and P2P-client support in ubuntu I am trying to get wifi direct working on a laptop with ubuntu 12.04\nWhen I type the command 'iw list' it doesn't show P2P-client or P2P-go under 'supported interface modes.From http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/iw/replace-iwconfig I found that 'iwconfig' was replaced with 'iw'.Does it mean that my hardware doesn't have support for wifi-direct or is it just the software(drivers) issue?

I'm also running apache.\n\nA: You can't have more than one application listening to a port on a device. You have the following choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove Nginx or Apache. Just use one.\n\n*Keep both and move Apache or Nginx to another port. From there you can have the port80 server proxy the other one so that it is available for certain domains (see proxy_pass or mod_proxy).\n\n*Keep both and move Apache and Nginx onto distinct IP addresses or interfaces. If your server is configured to have 10.0.0.3 and 10.0.0.4 (just examples) you could give the first to Apache and the second to Nginx and both could have a port80 on their respective IPs. This has knock-on consequences for DNS but that's not hard to account for.\nThis does mean you need to stop using 0.0.0.0 as a setting in both servers.\n\nA: You will need to change the configure port of either Apache or Nginx. After you do this you will need to restart the reconfigured servers, using the 'service' command you used.\nApache\nEdit /etc/apache2/ports.conf and change the 80 on the following line:\nListen 80\n\nfor something different.\nNginx\nEdit /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default and change the 80 on the following line:\nlisten 80;\n\nfor something different, this should be near the top, and be in the first server { section.\n", "Q: Forward TCP Connections with Iptables I receive connections to my server from several ip addresses I want to route these connections just like rinetd does but based on the ip the connection is coming from to connect to a specified host.\nJust like this:\nIP 10.10.12.1    => CONNECTS TO MY SERVER => MY SERVER REDIRECTS IT TO 82.12.12.1\nIP 10.10.12.2    => CONNECTS TO MY SERVER => MY SERVER REDIRECTS IT TO 81.121.12.10\n\netc\nIs it possible or do I need to write my own daemon to achieve this functionality ?\n\nA: iptables can do that:\nsudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s 10.10.12.1 -j DNAT --to 82.12.12.1\nsudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.10.12.1 -d 82.12.12.1 -j MASQUERADE\n\nThe first command changes the packet's destination address, redirecting it to the external host. The second command changes the source address, so the external host can send a reply to your server.\nProbably you'll want to redirect only the packets destinated to specific ports, e.g. if 10.10.12.1 talks to 82.12.12.1 only via TCP ports 80 and 1234 the first iptables command would be:\nsudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s 10.10.12.1 -p tcp -m multiport --destination-ports 80,1234 -j DNAT --to 82.12.12.1\n\n", "Q: Is there a document editor with revision control I'm looking for a document editor (or software) that 'create a revision' every time a file saves (if there are changes).

(Example)\n\nA: Two come to mind:\n\n*\n\n*Emacs\n\n*Anjuta\n\nMore detailed answer:\nFrom the Emacs manual:\n\n28.1 Version Control\nA version control system is a program that can record multiple versions of a source file, storing information such as the creation time of each version, who made it, and a description of what was changed.\nThe Emacs version control interface is called VC. VC commands work with several different version control systems; currently, it supports GNU Arch, Bazaar, CVS, Git, Mercurial, Monotone, RCS, SCCS/CSSC, and Subversion. Of these, the GNU project distributes CVS, Arch, RCS, and Bazaar.\nVC is enabled automatically whenever you visit a file governed by a version control system. To disable VC entirely, set the customizable variable vc-handled-backends to nil (see Customizing VC).\n\n\nFrom the Anjuta features list:\n\nIn addition, the file manager context menu also lists actions associated with other plugins, such as build actions (associated with the build system plugin), CVS/Subversion actions (associated with version control system plugins) and project actions (associated with the project manager plugin).

So what is their purpose? Or, under what conditions would these folders be populated?\nHere's a screenshot from a video showing these folders (within the red rectangle):  \n\nA: \nThumbnails are reduced-size versions of pictures, used to make it easier to scan and recognize them, serving the same role for images as a normal text index does for words (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumbnail).\n...\nThese thumbnails are created by Nautilus. Having thumbnails may make your system perform better. If you have pictures, Nautilus will have to create new thumbnails for them every time you go into your picture directory. If you scroll down the directory, you will notice that picture previews take quite a bit of time to display. By keeping a repository of thumbnails it already made, Nautilus can skip that part and display your pictures straightaway.\nIf you want to turn them off, start Nautilus, click on Edit -> Preferences -> Preview, choose Show thumbnails: Never.\n\nSource: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/27345\nFor information about cleaning up thumbnails take a look at How do I reset the thumbnail cache?.\n\nA: I'm using Lubuntu 12.10 with PCManFm, the default file manager.\n/home/myhomefoldername/.thumbnails/normal is populated with more than 2000 itens, all of them are .png thumbnails made from files such as images (png, jpg or any other image format) and from pdf files. I can't see thumbnails made of other file formats such as .odt or .ods; .mov or even made from .txt.\nWhen are they created? From what I'm observing here, they're created when I goto folders with those kind of files. Note that I view files on PCManFM as a detailed list, not as thumbnails. You don't need to open the files I listed at the previous paragraph. Just open a folder/directory with those kind of files and the thumbnails will be created at /home/myhomefoldername/.thumbnails/normal.\nNote that all thumbnails seem to have a size limit: xx by 128 pixels. On PCManFm>Edit>Preferences>Show (not sure if it's the accurate translation once my Lubuntu is not in English) you'll see options to enable/disable thumbnails creation. \nDefault is to create thumbnails sized 128x128 and to not create thumbnails of files larger than 2048kb.

If windows sees an NTFS volume, it'll be able to access and use that part of the drive.

All the installation process go fine, after rebooting my laptop, it just stick to the purple screen.\nThen I boot it with USB again, tried boot-repair, tried make an EFI partition, still the same.\nI have searched on the web, and all of them was about dual booting with windows 7 or windows 8, I don't wish to do dual booting as I wish to have single OS which is Ubuntu on this laptop.\nplease help, thanks in advance.\n\nA: I feel that UEFI is the problem, your boot-sector is locked which prevents it's modification.\nTo solve this issue , You have to first go to BIOS settings by pressing , Del or whatever function key that takes you to that BIOS Setting menu.\nLook for secure-boot option and disable it , save settings and restart.\nRepeat the Ubuntu installation process after reformatting drive and it will work.\n\nA: Try using the USB flash drive or CD-R boot image version of my rEFInd boot manager. With a default installation of Ubuntu and with Secure Boot disabled, the USB flash drive should boot your Ubuntu installation when you select an option to boot a Linux kernel (vmlinuz-{version}) directly; but given your problem, it's possible that this won't work. If it doesn't, you should at least see diagnostic messages on the screen as you attempt to boot, and these may provide some clue about what's going wrong. Take a screen shot (with a digital camera) and post it here, being sure that the text is legible.\nIf you can boot all the way with rEFInd, you can install the Debian package version of the program on your hard disk.\n\nA: thank for helping me out here guys, i found a way to install it and it runs smoothly which is, since i need only ubuntu on the machine, what i do is, i avoid create EFI, FAT, FAT32, NTSF partition, so the bootloader will not search for any Windows installation, and grub will just boot ubuntu only. and now my laptop booting up ubuntu 13.04 64 bit nicely :)\n", "Q: Can't log in to MineCraft?

I'm new to Ubuntu, I just installed 13.04 on a dedicated machine.\nI want to update to the most recent versions of scientific software namely Bowtie, Tophat and Samtools but I can't figure out how since the newer versions are not available from the software centre. These software are command line only by the way.\nI'll take Bowtie as an example. I installed it from the Ubuntu Software Centre but it is an old version. I therefore downloaded the latest version from the developer's website and unzipped the pre-compiled package in my home directory. Software centre installed the old version in /usr/bin/ and some files at other locations like /usr/share/doc/ and /usr/share/man/man1/. My understanding is that having the binary in /usr/bin/ makes it available to all users and allows calling it from the command line without having to type the complete path. So, to update the software, do I overwrite the binary in usr/bin/ and the other files elsewhere with the newer versions? That seems very awkward to me. I suspect there must be some Linux command to achieve this goal but I can't find it. \nThank you all for your help.\n\nA: You can update all your software on your Ubuntu system like this: \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install bowtie\n\nYou can use install, it will check for the latest version.\nI hope this helps\n\nA: You should never override files in /usr - they are managed by Ubuntu package manager and modifying files manually behind Ubuntu's back would lead to problems (for example, Ubuntu will override your changes when an updated version of the package appears in the repositories).\nAs Bruno Pereira says, the ways to install each application may be different, however, there are a few common locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*you can install your custom application in /usr/local\n\n*you can install your application in a subdirectory of /opt - say, /opt/bowtie - and add the latter directory to PATH\n\n*if you only need the application for one user, you can keep it in your home directory - if you create a directory called bin in your home directory and put a symlink to the application's binary there you'll be able to run the app by simply typing the application name in the terminal\n\n\n(you may also want to make sure you completely removed Ubuntu-provided versions of the application to minimize a chance of running the wrong version accidentally)\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut added to lubuntu-rc.xml is not executed on keypress I wanted to add a custom keyboard shortcut to control mplayer. mplayer config file is set up properly.\n~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml:\n<keybind key=\"XF86AudioPlay\">\n    <action name=\"Execute\">\n        <command>echo \"pause\" > /home/username/.mplayer/pipe</command>\n    </action>\n</keybind>\n\nPressing the corresponding key has no effect.\nExecuting the command itself (echo \"pause\" > /home/username/.mplayer/pipe in terminal) works as expected.\nIs there any way to check if the file is parsed and loaded correctly?\nPlease help. Thanks.\n\nA: One way is to run openbox --reconfigure from a terminal and look out for messages that may help you fix things.\nAre you sure you've added this code within the <keyboard> and </keyboard> tags? If it's elsewhere, it will be ignored.\n\nLooking at your code, with the echo in it, I'm not sure that Openbox does such stuff.

How can I find how often a program (like firefox, teeworlds, thunderbird, etc.) has launched? I'm a Java programmer, so solutions that must be implemented programmatically are acceptable, and preferred.\n\nA: The only solution that I could come up with is to wrap the programs you're interested in. That of course is only feasible if the list of programs you want to observe is short enough. \nLook after the command dpkg-divert. It lets you move files under package control aside while still being managed by the packaging system. Something like this could work:\n# dpkg-divert --add --local --divert /usr/bin/firefox.mylogwrapped --rename /usr/bin/firefox\n\nThen link a log script to the original path like\n# ln -s /usr/local/bin/mylogwrapper /usr/bin/firefox\n\nInside that wrapper do whatever you need to do and then exec /usr/bin/firefox.mylogwrapped \"$@\". You can access the name of the originally called binary with the $0 environment variable. \nGood luck!\n", "Q: Why can't Ubuntu find any hard disks or volumes during installation?

only known solutions there are to install Ubuntu in such disks are to convert them back to basic or install Ubuntu in another disk that has not been converted.\nMore information about the tools you need and procedures to take to convert a disk to a basic volume here.\n\nA: Something is wrong with the drive or the controller as they won't reset and initialize correctly.\n\nA: The issue maybe the partition table, however there are minimal chances of this as Windows is working fine.\nMy guess is that you're using your HDDs as 'Dynamic Disks' in Windows. The best (and probably the only sane) resolution is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup ALL your drives to another HDD (which is Basic). Contact a friend (or foe) if you need. [You may also boot into Windows and copy all data from partitions of Drive1 to those of Drive2. And then disconnect Drive2 when you install Ubuntu.]\n\n*Boot into Windows now, and convert the drive to Basic (convert both drives if you backed it up to a 3rd drive; or only Drive1 if the backup is on Drive2).\n\n*Delete all partitions on the drive (to be foolproof).\n\n*Install Windows, AND then, Ubuntu. (Avoid extended partitions if you can, they've messed my partition table in the past.)\n\n\nCan't reinstall Windows?\nOkay! Then say Disk1 has Windows installed, copy contents of Disk2 to Disk1. And convert Disk2 to Basic. Install Ubuntu on Disk2. Make Disk2 the default boot-device from the BIOS. And final step is to do sudo update-grub\n\nA: yep., that is may be getting into account while you are installing ubuntu from boot because it doesn't support dynamic disk volumes with formats .NTFS and .GTP etc.., but did you ever tried to start ubuntu installation from the windows it self and when you doing like this it may ask you to choose which Drive you want to install ubuntu and how much memory you want to use for OS and which version do you want to install all these options are available with this mode of installation.., checked it out once.\n\nA: My friend also reported this problem today, that Ubuntu was not able to detect the partitions, while Windows installer detected.\nI told him to try out different Linux Live CDs to check if the problem persists, but he had success with Linux Mint which could read his partitions.\nSo you could download Ubuntu 12.04.3(LTS), and try it also, otherwise you could also try Linux Mint to see if its detecting your disks.\nPerhaps theres a bug somewhere.\n", "Q: Pulseaudio equalizer not working Pulseaudio equalizer gui won't start, it gives this error when typed in terminal:\nmanevskifi4o@M-Ubuntu-13:~$ pulseaudio-equalizer-gtk\nGetting settings...\n/usr/bin/pulseaudio-equalizer: line 221: /home/manevskifi4o/.pulse/equalizerrc: No such file or directory\nmkdir: cannot create directory ‘/home/manevskifi4o/.pulse/presets’: No such file or directory\n/usr/bin/pulseaudio-equalizer: line 229: /home/manevskifi4o/.pulse/equalizerrc.availablepresets.unsorted: No such file or directory\nsed: couldn't flush stdout: Broken pipe\n/usr/bin/pulseaudio-equalizer: line 232: /home/manevskifi4o/.pulse/equalizerrc.availablepresets.unsorted: No such file or directory\nls: cannot access /home/manevskifi4o/.pulse/presets/*.preset: No such file or directory\n/usr/bin/pulseaudio-equalizer: line 235: /home/manevskifi4o/.pulse/equalizerrc.availablepresets: No such file or directory\nrm: cannot remove ‘/home/manevskifi4o/.pulse/equalizerrc.availablepresets.unsorted’: No such file or directory\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/share/pulseaudio-equalizer/pulseaudio-equalizer.py\", line 535, in <module>\n    Equalizer()\n  File \"/usr/share/pulseaudio-equalizer/pulseaudio-equalizer.py\", line 357, in __init__\n    GetSettings()\n  File \"/usr/share/pulseaudio-equalizer/pulseaudio-equalizer.py\", line 46, in GetSettings\n     f = open(eqconfig, \"r\")\nIOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/manevskifi4o/.pulse/equalizerrc'\n\n\nA: To fix it, create this folder:\nmkdir -p ~/.pulse/equalizerrc\n\nThen run:\n/usr/share/pulseaudio-equalizer/pulseaudio-equalizer.py\n\n", "Q: Why syntax error near unexpected token `fi' is coming This is my simple script but it is saying that syntax error near unexpected token `fi' \nmysql --user=root --password= erpint -B -e \"select * from user_info;\" | sed      \"s/'/\\'/;s/\\t/\\\",\\\"/g;s/^/\\\"/;s/$/\\\"/;s/\\n//g\" > /home/mayuri/detail.csv\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\nmutt -s \"Mutt attach\" srini@erpint.com -a /home/mayuri/detail.csv < /home/mayuri/trials.txt\nfi\n\n\nA: If it's a bash script, make sure you have included \"#!/bin/bash\" on the first line of your script file. \n\nA: When attaching single or multiple files, separating filenames and recipient addresses with -- is mandatory:\nmutt -s \"Mutt attach\" -a /home/mayuri/detail.csv -- srini@erpint.com < /home/mayuri/trials.txt\n\nSee man mutt fore more about:\n\nmutt [-nx] [-e cmd] [-F file] [-s subj] [-b addr] [-c addr] [-a file [...] --] addr [...] < message\n\nAlso, be sure that first line of the script is:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n", "Q: How to convert markdown to rich text (rtf) in Ubuntu 13.04? I want to convert text written in Markdown to Rich Text on Ubuntu 13.04. I could not find any solution on the web, except for one Mac OS X script.\nHow can I do that on Ubuntu 13.04? Preferably in the browser.\nP.S. I don't need it the other way, the text gets always written in Markdown and needs to get transformed to rich text.\n\nA: One alternative is http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/ which is in the repos,\nsudo apt-get install pandoc\n\nThen you can take your markdown file and convert it to rtf, or a variety of other formats with,\npandoc -s -f markdown -t rtf -o file.rtf file.txt\n\nThe -s switch is for standalone, so that it doesn't just create an rtf fragment. There are also a variety of other useful switches such as -S for smart quotes. I use it all the time to create epub and pdf files.\nIt would also be a good idea to check out the documentation on their site, since the pandoc markdown format supports several extensions.\n\nA: You could try a two-step approach. Open your markdown file in ReText (available from the Software Center) and export in .odt format. Then open the .odt file in LibreOffice Writer which allows saving as rtf.\n\nReText is a text editor for Markdown and reStructuredText markup languages, written in Python.\n\nFeatures:\n* Full Markdown and reStructuredText support\n* Markdown extensions support\n* Supported export formats:\n   - HTML\n   - PDF\n   - ODT (OpenDocument Text)\n   - Webpages generation\n* Tabs and Live preview\n* CSS styles support\n* Syntax highlighting\n* Tags and symbols boxes for quick insert\n* Page breaks support (for Markdown)\n", "Q: New Ubuntu/Linux user have some questions I'm a new Linux/Ubuntu user came from Windows environment trying to figure my way into Linux and planning to make a full transition when i feel ready, and have some basic questions to make things clear to me.\n1- Im using Ubuntu 13.04 with Kernel 3.8 pre-installed, what changes would happen if i installed newer kernel? will i lose my installed apps? drivers? theme? configurations? anything i should be aware of in this matter?\n2- I install most of my apps directly from repositories/ppa's , if i installed apps downloaded from sites - .deb files - will i be able to get lastest updates to these apps? or would i update them manually? \n3- Is there any IDM like or any download manager that is integrated with Browsers, to click and download with some nice features - multithreading, schedule, resume?\nAs i mentioned above i just came from Windows, any tips to make things easier and clear would be appreciated.\nThank you :)\n\nA: *\n\n*No, on all questions. But do not bother and stick with the one that is installed by default. We all do. Well almost all of us do. If a newer kernel becomes available (mostly from security updates) you will get an update warning and the system will take care of it. \n\n*Depends on the app. In general you need to manually update but sometimes it has an automated updater. Example: Aptana IDE; you install it yourself through a tar file but it does warn you and does update if you let it from within Aptana. \n\n*There is a list of downloadmanagers here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DownloadManager but these are mostly single browser (firefox).\n", "Q: Dual boot MacBook with Ubuntu 13.04, 32-bit Please how can I dual boot Ubuntu 13.04 on my MacBook running Mac OS X 10.5.8 with the following specs:\nModel Name: MacBook\n  Model Identifier: MacBook5,2\n  Processor Name: Intel Core 2 Duo\n  Processor Speed: 2.13 GHz\n  Number of Processors: 1\n  Total Number of Cores: 2\n  L2 Cache: 3MB\n  Memory: 2GB\n  Bus Speed:    1.07 GHz\n  Boot ROM Version: MB52.0088.B05\n  SMC Version (system): 1.38f5\n  Serial Number (system): W89214SE9GU\n  Hardware UUID:    D0110864-A751-56AF-8BB3-BBA03A9E93FA\n  Sudden Motion Sensor:\n  State:    Enabled  \nI enjoyed using Ubuntu on my Dell notebook, but I don't have it anymore plus I am new to Mac and would love to have Ubuntu running side by side with my MacBook.

There are more pages containing a table with 3 columns (current number, name and a grade). \nI scanned it and got 16 jpeg documents. Each jpeg is a scanned page. \nNow, I need an OCR to convert each jpeg into text, in order to insert this table in an excel document. \nI use LibreOffice and Ubuntu 12.04. \n\nA: The Scanning and OCR page on Ubuntu Apps show us several alternatives, of which I suggest you to use XSane Image Scanning Program or Simple Scan (usually pre-installed in 12.04 and maybe earlier versions too) and/or gscan2pdf, to get your documents scanned.\nMy favorite is gscan2pdf, which allow you to follow the Scan/OCR process in the same GUI with no problem. \n\nPlease notice that I am attempting to run a OCR to a screenshot.\nYou simply Scan or Import the documents/images and go to the Tools Menu, choose the OCR Option and you'll be asked for a OCR Engine, simply choose the one that gives the best results for you and click \"Start OCR\". \n\nYou'll find the OCR Output in the tab with the same title as shown in the next screenshot.\n\nPlease note that even with good quality images the OCR may fail interpreting certain characters, which may result in misspelled words or simply Egyptian hieroglyphics. The process to OCR a large set of documents may delay for a while. \nHere is a link to a comprehensive video which explains the process to Scan and OCR in GScan2PDF: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjjogfWfWsQ\nGood luck!\n\nA: Bit late in answering this question. \nBut for others who come to this page searching for an OCR solution for LibreOffice,  I recently develeped LibreOCR, an OCR plugin for LibreOffice. \nIt is part of Indic-OCR project. \nThe extension can now be found from LibreOffice Extensions Website\n", "Q: libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.16' not found When importing a library (cdms2) in python, I get the following error message:\nImportError: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.16' not found (required by /usr/local/uvcdat/1.3.1/Externals/lib/libcurl.so.4)\n\nMy version of libc6 is currently 2.15 (Ubuntu 12.04). My understanding is that the newest version is not in a stable repository: how can I force apt to update to version 2.16?\n\nA: There is a much safer way to run a single app. Problem is: while glibc is meant to be backwards-compatible, it is not 100% accurate. Issues are known. So, do not update the library system-wide. Instead, prepare a whole set of updated libraries. Put them in, say, /catbed. Then just run\n   /catbed/ld-linux.so.3 --library-path=/catbed:/whatever-else /usr/bin/python -python-args\n\nOf cause, adapt the filenames to your case. This is much safer way to go, because if you mess up your system ld-linux+libc pair you will not be able to fix it from inside the OS. You will have hard times even chrooting into it then. \nI routinely use the trick for old proprietary Linuxes (gcc 3.1, kernel 2.3) on which I want to run Qt5. \n\nA: \nWas the  UVCDAT installation manually built one or downloaded the\n  pre-built binaries ?\n\nBinaries of UVCDAT 1.3.1 were built on Ubuntu 13.04 platform .  Even if you solve this one, could come across many other errors. Try downloading UVCDAT 1.2.   If you want the latest UVCDAT and want to stick to 12.04 try building from the source code.

(Sansa 240)\nI initially attempted to select \"Show hidden files\" in my File Explorer options setting, but that was already selected.\nFurther Googling then lead me to the Sandisk website where I learned about the USB mode (connectivity) problem. It says that I should switch to the MSC mode on my device, then connect to my PC. When I checked, MSC was already selected but there was another option called Auto Detect, which I selected. When I connected to my PC, my folder view instantly changed and I was finally able to see my music files (and delete unwanted ones). So it was not actually the MSC mode that I needed, but I learned that I had to \"unselect\" it in order to view my Sansa files on the PC.

In the \"Displays\" settings you can configure them to your liking, as shown here:\n\nYou can get to Displays by simply searching for it in the dash, or by going to System Settings > Displays. Your mileage may vary based on your graphics chipset. For example, an Nvidia chipset may have its settings in a utility provided by Nvidia instead of being fully configurable from this interface. In my example, the chipset is an Intel HD4000.

Why? Too many files. I laughed and then ran:\n# df -ih\nFilesystem     Inodes IUsed IFree IUse% Mounted on\n/dev/xvda        2.5M  2.4M   91K   97% /\n\nCrap. 2.4million inodes in use. What the hell has been going on?!\nI've looked for the obvious suspects (/var/{log,cache} and the directory where all the sites are hosted from) but I'm not finding anything really suspicious. Somewhere on this beast I'm certain there's a directory that contains a couple of million files.\nFor context one my my busy servers uses 200k inodes and my desktop (an old install with over 4TB of used storage) is only just over a million. There is a problem.\nSo my question is, how do I find where the problem is? Is there a du for inodes?\n\nA: Often faster than find, if your locate database is up to date:\n# locate '' | sed 's|/[^/]*$|/|g' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tee filesperdirectory.txt | tail\n\nThis dumps the entire locate database, strips off everything past the last '/' in the path, then the sort and \"uniq -c\" get you the number of files/directories per directory. \"sort -n\" piped to tail to get you the ten directories with the most things in them.\n\nA: a bit old thread but interesting so I suggest my solutions.\nFirst uses few piped commands and it finds directories with over 1000 files inside:\nfind / -type d  |awk '{print \"echo -n \"$0\" ---- ; ls -1 \"$0\" |wc -l \"}'|bash |awk -F \"----\" '{if ($2>1000) print $1}'\n\nSecond is simple. It just try to find directories that have size over 4096B. Normally empty directory has 4096B on the ext4 filesystem i 6B on the xfs:\nfind / -type d -size +4096c\n\nYou can adjust it of course but I believe that it should work in most cases with such value. \n\nA: Check /lost+found in case there was a disk problem and a lot of junk ended up being detected as separate files, possibly wrongly.\nCheck iostat to see if some application is still producing files like crazy.\nfind / -xdev -type d -size +100k will tell you if there's a directory that uses more than 100kB of disk space. That would be a directory that contains a lot of files, or contained a lot of files in the past. You may want to adjust the size figure.\nI don't think there's a combination of options to GNU du to make it count 1 per directory entry. You can do this by producing the list of files with find and doing a little bit of counting in awk. Here is a du for inodes. Minimally tested, doesn't try to cope with file names containing newlines.\n#!/bin/sh\nfind \"$@\" -xdev -depth | awk '{\n    depth = $0; gsub(/[^\\/]/, \"\", depth); depth = length(depth);\n    if (depth < previous_depth) {\n       # A non-empty directory: its predecessor was one of its files\n       total[depth] += total[previous_depth];\n       print total[previous_depth] + 1, $0;\n       total[previous_depth] = 0;\n    }\n    ++total[depth];\n    previous_depth = depth;\n}\nEND { print total[0], \"total\"; }'\n\nUsage: du-inodes /.

Here is a post that someone has already asked on the subject. link here\n\nA: The information pertaining to your device are available on the page\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Devices/i9300\nRemember that Ubuntu Touch is still under development and we still have much work to do.\nIt is possible to find problems or the desired software is not yet available for installation or download\n", "Q: How Can I install Ubuntu 13.04, preferably without creating a new partition on my 64 bit Windows 8 UEFI Acer Aspire E1-571 laptop? I realise this might be a duplicate I am asking because I can't find any questions so far that address this question but I wouldn't imagine it'd be too rare. I accidentally deleted Windows 8 last time I tried to install Ubuntu on my laptop so I would like to be guided through this please. I love Ubuntu, don't mind Windows 8 and it'd be just great if they could coexist in peace and harmony on my laptop. \n\nA: In terms of not creating a new partition on your existing disk, I know of only three solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install in a virtual machine -- You can use VirtualBox, VMWare, or similar software to install Ubuntu in a virtual environment under Windows. This usually works well, but there may be a performance penalty.\n\n*Install on a separate disk -- You can install Ubuntu on a separate hard disk. (For a laptop, that's likely to be an external disk, but some laptops have bays for two hard disks.)\n\n*Use WUBI -- This installs Ubuntu in a file on the Windows filesystem. This option, however, works only on BIOS-based computers, and IIRC, the developers are moving away from WUBI. Thus, it's not a real option for you unless your \"UEFI\" tag is a mistake, and even then it might not work in another release or two.\n\n\nAs a practical matter, your best solution is to be prepared with a complete system backup and a plan to restore it; then familiarize yourself with the installation procedure and the meanings of all the options, so that you can navigate it to do what you want. Unfortunately, the step-by-step guides that are so popular today do little to provide the sort of understanding that's needed for making meaningful decisions about your installation.\n\nA: It is easy to select \"Install Alongside Windows 8\" during the installation process, and Ubuntu will automatically be installed next to Windows 8 without deleting it. Just make sure that you select this option when you get to the part where you set up partitions. Should be a simple two clicks, and it won't delete Windows.\n", "Q: 12.04: Is it possible to close windows in \"spread mode\"? I had to switch back to 12.04 after using 13.04 for a few weeks.

If I understand correctly, Unity 7 will not be backported to 12.04.\nIs there another possiblity to have this function, maybe using CCSM?\n\nA: In 12.04 you can do this by \"enabling the plugin 'Scale Addons' in CCSM and enable the option to close windows on middle-click\" \nSource.\nBefore that you have to install CCSM and the compiz add-ons.\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nsudo apt-get install compiz-plugins-extra\n\nIf your launcher is on auto-hide, it may not appear after activating the function.

Extended partitions don't really \"belong\" to any given OS, although it's possible to create an extended partition and then populate it with logical partitions that belong to just one OS. That's not the case on your disk, though.\nI disagree with the suggestion by Alaa that you can safely delete /dev/sda5. As an NTFS partition, /dev/sda5 is almost certainly a Windows partition, so its non-use by Linux is irrelevant. Instead, I recommend you evaluate its utility, or lack thereof, from Windows. You might be better to ask about it on a Windows forum -- but be aware that many Windows users are clueless about Linux and about the needs of a multi-boot computer; they may offer bad advice based on this poor understanding of such issues.\n", "Q: How to get ubuntu 10.04 live cd for 64 bit pc can anybody give me a link for downloading Ubuntu 10.04 live cd/dvd \nfor 64 bit desktop pc\n\nA: Here is the link to download Ubuntu 10.04.

Every 15-20 mins my wifi stops working. The connection remains intact but internet access dies.\nWhenever this happens - I restart Network-Manager and all is well for another 15 mins.\nWhat I would like to do is set up a CRON job which does this for me. I have the following in my crontab...\n*/2 * * * * service network-manager restart\n\n(It is 2 mins for debugging)\nThis does not work though. I read online that when doing things akin to this via CRON, one needs to specify the full path (which I do not know).\nCan anyone help me with this problem?\n\nA: The asker has stated that they eventually added the necessary paths to the top of the crontab file. I thought it useful to direct others searching through this thread to a little more information about the solution.\nSee: Reasons why crontab does not work\nQuote:\n\nCron passes a minimal set of environment variables to your jobs. To\n  see the difference, add a dummy job like this:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*\n*\n  \n*\n*\n  \n*\n*\n  \n*\n*\n  \n*env > /tmp/env.output\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Wait for /tmp/env.output to be created, then remove the job again. Now\n  compare the contents of /tmp/env.output with the output of env run in\n  your regular terminal.\nA common \"gotcha\" here is the PATH environment variable being\n  different. Maybe your cron script uses the command somecommand found\n  in /opt/someApp/bin, which you've added to PATH in /etc/environment?\n  cron does not read that file, so runnning somecommand from your script\n  will fail when run with cron, but work when run in a terminal.\n\n...\n\nYou can also set the PATH variable in the crontab file, which will\n  apply to all cron jobs. E.g.\n\n> PATH=/opt/someApp/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n> \n> 15 1 * * * backupscript --incremental /home /root\n\n\nA: You can start by looking in the log files (/var/log/*) to find which one(s) mention \"your wifi\", probably \"wlan0\". If not, use ifconfig -a to list your interfaces.    \nOn my system, here's what looking for wlan0 looks like:  \n$ grep -li wlan0 /var/log/*\ngrep: /var/log/btmp: Permission denied\ngrep: /var/log/btmp.1: Permission denied\n/var/log/dmesg.0\n/var/log/kern.log\n/var/log/kern.log.1\n/var/log/pm-powersave.log\n/var/log/pm-powersave.log.1\ngrep: /var/log/speech-dispatcher: Permission denied\n/var/log/syslog\n/var/log/syslog.1\n/var/log/udev\n\nNote that I ran the command as a non-root user, but btmp and speech-dispatcher logs aren't used by networking, so I don't really need to be root.  \nThe next step would be to remove the \"l\" option from the grep, pipe the output through less, and find the interesting (from the timestamp or the contents of the message) lines.    \ngrep -i wlan0 /var/log/* | less\n\n\nA: In the end I just added the paths required to the top of the crontab and it all worked. Internet is unavailable for 30ish seconds once every 15 mins which is no biggy in my case.\nThanks for the input people.\n", "Q: high frequency app for the Ubuntu smartphone An app is considered for the Ubuntu smartphone that involves:\n\n\n*\n\n*Monitoring low voltage, compound analog wave forms with a peak frequency component of 4.4 MHz.\n\n*Uploading faithful digital equivalents in a cloud.\n\n*Downloading from the cloud processed digital equivalents.\n\n*Converting the stream of the digital equivalents into faithful, low voltage compound analog wave forms that include a peak frequency component of 4.4 MHz.\n\n\nMy question is: can the Ubuntu smartphone carry out all the above activities?

When I install Ubuntu, does it cause change or something else in the Windows partition?\n\nA: On a system with Windows already installed, Ubuntu's installer will  usually shrink down Windows's partition(s) to make room to create its own. This does modify the partition--it physically moves the files in it so that they are not as far apart--but it shouldn't change the contents of any of your files or where they exist in the Windows filesystem (i.e., a particular file may be relocated physically on disk but you should still find it in the same place in Windows that you found it before).\nIf you're wondering if you ought to make sure your backups of important files on Windows are current before installing Ubuntu, the answer is yes. There's a small chance that dynamically shrinking the Windows partition will cause data loss, and usually a somewhat larger chance of the user making a mistake that could cause data loss. For example, if you accidentally tell Ubuntu to install using the entire disk, then it will overwrite the contents of other OSes, which would result in you losing the files in your Windows system.\nFurthermore, you should always maintain current backups of your important files (such as documents); if you don't have such a backup, now's a great time to create one, before installing Ubuntu. If your Windows system is broken and will not boot (sometimes that's what interests people in using Ubuntu), you can use the Ubuntu live CD/DVD, the same one you'd use to install, to access those files. So even if your Windows system is broken, you can back up any important documents in it.\n\nA: If you have installed Ubuntu on a different partition than your windows partition. Ubuntu will not access the windows partition.\n", "Q: How do I gain access to the files in the /etc/apt folder?

For example:\nsudo -H /bin/bash\ncd /etc/apt\ndo your editing of files\nexit\n\nGood practice is to save a copy of the original files (e.g. Adding a .orig suffix), before editing.\n\nA: One way of doing this is by opening nautilus as root from the terminal:\nsudo nautilus\n\nFrom there, proceed as you have tried before, change the filename and copy your file\n\nA: To change a file name:\nsudo mv /etc/apt/somefile /etc/apt/somefile.bak\n\nTo move a file into that directory:\nsudo cp ~/somefile2 /etc/apt\n\nThe ~ supposes that the existing file is in your /home/user directory.

Under \"User Accounts\", there's a toggle option labeled Automatic Login:\n\nWhat does that do if it's tabbed to \"on\"?\nI haven't tried the function yet and I'd like advice from an expert.\n\nA: the automatic log in means that the user will be logged in automatically and wont have to enter password and username at the log in screen. \nThat's it. \n\nA: \"Automatic Login\" Inside of each User's options on the User Accounts dialog (remember that you can have several users in the same computer), just means that the user won't be prompted for his/her user password in order to start his/her session.\n\nYou can have only one \"Automatic Login\" even if this seems to appear in each user.

Several months ago, I installed Lubuntu alongside Windows 7 on my laptop. I decided to uninstall Lubuntu and install Linux Mint, and so I used EasyBCD to write the MBR for Windows 7/Windows Vista and boot directly into Windows 7 at startup. I then deleted the 2 volumes which contained the data for my Lubuntu installation (which I originally created by partitioning my second hard drive), deleted the partition, and I extended my second hard drive with the free partition. This process had worked for me when I was uninstalling Lubuntu from another laptop several months ago, and I was sure this would work again without any hitches.\nWhen I restarted my computer, however, I ran into a missing device error with grub. I didn't really know how to fix it, so I used a LiveUSB of Ubuntu in order to use the boot-repair tool (by running the Try Ubuntu option and downloading boot-repair) to regain access to Windows. I ran it, and it said that the boot was successfully repaired and it was safe to reboot. I did as such, but Ubuntu took a long time to shutdown, so I thought it must have been some error and I did a force shutdown. \nAfter turning on the laptop, it said that bootmgr was missing, and the only option given was to restart the computer, and after restarting 5 times, it still said the same message. I used the LiveUSB again to run the boot-repair tool to repair the boot, and I am currently waiting on Ubuntu to reboot.

After the first reboot you had GRUB MBR on first disk, Windows MBR on second and no partitions where first could find boot configuration. Sad. And after boot repair you have the same situation because this tool apparently does not recover deleted volumes, it only fixes typical boot problems. To boot Windows, you should make the second disk first in boot sequence or use Windows Repair or Installation Media to fix boot problems, because Ubuntu now nas no deal with it.\n", "Q: Trying to switch from Win7 to Ubuntu but boot disc won't work Okay, I have Win7 Ultimate on a machines, and I want to put Ubuntu 12.4 on it instead.

Such as graphics driver from intel, broadcom wireless driver.\nIf you search this site, you will get detailed instruction on how to install.\nLike - What is the correct way to install proprietary ATI Catalyst Video Drivers (fglrx) directly from AMD? or How do I get AMD/Intel Hybrid Graphics drivers to work? or Installing Broadcom Wireless Drivers \nIn general you can look at this question : How do I install additional drivers? \n\n*You are replacing an OS. If you are not good with partition type (Legacy/ UEFI) and their operations. Be safe, copy your data to some external drive.\n\n*Have a look here also - Ubuntu 12.10 64bit installation on HP Pavilion g6 & HP Coolsense for Ubuntu?\nAfter installation, if you face any problem you are welcome here to ask your problem. \n", "Q: Broken dependencies after upgrade After an apt-get upgrade\nI got the following error:\nReading package lists...

I have downloaded Opera for Linux 64-bit version, but when I try to install via Ubuntu Software Center it tells me it is the wrong architecture. What can I do?\n\nA: I'd recommend installing Opera using the Opera repository.  That way it will install the version that is needed and run the updates automatically.\nTo add the Opera repository, run the following in the terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb https://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free\"\nwget -O - https://deb.opera.com/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install opera-stable\n\n(if you prefer beta releases, use deb https://deb.opera.com/opera-beta/ stable non-free in the first line above).\nFor more details see the guide on manual setup of the Opera apt repository.\n\nA: To install Opera, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nFor 32bit\nwget snapshot.opera.com/unix/dancingelephant_12.13-1725/opera_12.13.1725_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i opera*.deb\n\nFor 64bit\nwget snapshot.opera.com/unix/dancingelephant_12.13-1725/opera_12.13.1725_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i opera*.deb\n\nSource:LinuxG\n\nA: There is a generic Opera repository available at http://deb.opera.com (with full description of how to add it). The Canonical repository for Opera no longer works\ndeb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free\n\nThe line above will make sure you get all final public releases. By default the sources repository is also added (which does not exist for Opera) so remove that. Add the following line if you want to get the newer alpha and beta releases instead.\ndeb http://deb.opera.com/opera-beta/ stable non-free\n\nIt is advisable that you add the Opera GPG key.\nwget -qO - http://deb.opera.com/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -\n\n(If you get \"The following packages cannot be authenticated\" warnings, you'll also need this:)\nsudo apt-get install debian-archive-keyring\n\nInstall via the shell\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install opera\n\n", "Q: Password protect files/folders using cli I have some important documents that I need to protect from anyone else having access to my machine. \nThe problem being the other persons have access to my machine via root account so changing the file permissions is not a option for me. I have seen apps like cryptkeeper but I was wondering can I password protect my files/folder by command line mode in ubuntu.\n\nA: If other users have root access to the system, then the only way that I can see to protect your files/folders is encryption and decryption. \nLot of answers are listed here (in AskUbuntu) about encrypt/decrypt , but I will show the simplest method, in my opinion. \nOpenSSL\nEncrypt/Decrypt file \nopenssl aes-256-cbc -in file -out file.aes\nopenssl aes-256-cbc -d -in file.aes -out file\n\nOpenSSL & Tar\nEncrypt/Decrypt Folder\ntar -zcf - directory | openssl aes-256-cbc -out directory.tar.gz.aes\nopenssl aes-256-cbc -d  -in directory.tar.gz.aes | tar -xz -f -\n\nKeep your decryption password out of the sight, and out of the System.\n\nA: Another simple solution. Say, you want to protect the folder \"secret\". Do the following:\nmv secret secret.tmp\nmkdir .secret.enc\nmkdir secret\nencfs ~/.secret.enc ~/secret\n\nNow encfs will ask you about some options and a password. After that, .secret.enc will contain an encoded copy of anything you put to ~/secret.\nmv secret.tmp/* secret\nrmdir secret.tmp\n\nYou can now treat secret as a normal folder: edit files, copy, move whatever. When you are done, do\nfusermount -u ~/secret\n\nThe directory secret will now be empty, and the files will be, encrypted, in .secret.enc.\nNote about the root: if anyone else has root permissions, you have no privacy, full stop. Even with encryption, root will always have the possibility to snoop on your terminal, hijack your passwords and keys, and gain access to your encrypted data.\nAnother solution with the GUI: put your files in a folder. Open the parent folder in Nautilus. Right click on your \"secret\" folder.

In fact, Ubuntu will take more different files than Windows 7. Computer files are not specific for any OS. What might not work out-of-the-box in Ubuntu are game files, since they will most likely be in binary format, specifically for the game they were used for. But even this often works by using Wine or PlayOnLinux.\n", "Q: How to manage permissions for user groups for internal harddisk partitions I was advised that for managing permissions to access the partitions of hard disk you should add users to groups and I figured out how to do that.\nBut I don't understand how to add permissions for users in such a way that they do not have access to some specific hard disk partitions, but they have access to other partitions (without use of sudo password)\nAfter mounting partitions as admin user, when I go to properties and then to permission, and there try to change the permissions for groups to access files/directories and I change the groups and try to save, it automatically changes to the previous setting before I can save it.\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\nHow can I manage permissions for users to have access to hard disk partitions?\n\nA: I got the solutions for managing premission by installing sofwares\nI have tried mount manager and storage device manager for mangaing the partition.\nBoth sofware are good but storage device manager is easy while mountmanager have more functionalities.\n", "Q: Sony Vaio SVF1521C5E sound problem with Ubuntu 12.04 I have a problem on my Sony Vaio Fit 15 E (SVF1521C5E) running Ubuntu 12.04.02 x64.\nIn particular I can't hear any sound from my speakers.\nI have no problem to listen with the headphones.\nMy hardware is the following:\n$ lspci -nn|egrep 'ultimedia|udio|sound|AC97|ac97|EMU'\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Panther Point High Definition Audio Controller    (rev 04)\n\n$ aplay -l\n**** Lista di PLAYBACK dispositivi hardware ****\nscheda 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], dispositivo 0: HDA Generic [HDA Generic]\nSottoperiferiche: 1/1\nSottoperiferica #0: subdevice #0\nscheda 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], dispositivo 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\nSottoperiferiche: 1/1\nSottoperiferica #0: subdevice #0\n\n\n$ cat /proc/asound/car*/co* |  grep Codec\nCodec: Realtek ID 233\nCodec: Intel PantherPoint HDMI\n\n\nA: I solved the problem upgrading my ALSA drivers:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/UpgradingAlsa/DKMS\nSimple and fast.

I have to use the integrated graphics because I was not able to install Ubuntu with an external graphics card and found no linux driver for the external card. Therefore I have to use a VGA connection.\nUnder Windows XP the resolution 1920x1080, 60 Hz, works precisely this way. 'Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS' enables precisely the same resolution and frequency with a monitor that it recognizes, even using VGA connection. But the Ubuntu does not recognize my TV set and, with the TVset, it does not offer the 1920x1080 resolution.\nAccording to https://askubuntu.com/questions/298797/intel-driver-cannot-detect-my-monitor-and-get-native-resolution?rq=1 and http://www.garrypassarella.co.uk/2011/04/23/add-undetected-resolutions-in-ubuntu/ I have got the resolution 1920x1080, 60 Hz for a moment using Terminal \n$ xrandr  \nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 768, maximum 2048 x 2048  \nVGA1 connected 1024x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm  \n   1024x768       60.0*  \n   800x600        60.3     56.2  \n   848x480        60.0   \n   640x480        59.9   \n\n$ cvt 1920 1080 60  \n 1920x1080 59.96 Hz (CVT) hsync: 79.57 kHz; pclk: 206.25 MHz  \nModeline \"1920x1080_60.00\"  206.25  1920 2056 2256 2592  1080 1283 1293 1327 -hsync +vsync  \n\n$ xrandr -newmode \"1920x1080_60.00\"  206.25  1920 2056 2256 2592  1080 1283 1293 1327 -hsync +vsync  \nand  \n\n$ xrandr --addmode VGA1 \"1920x1080_60.00\"  \n.\n\nI need to continue adding the resolution into the Ubuntu displays menu because, in a new run, the Ubuntu 'System Settings'...'Displays' offers only the former '1024x768 (4:3)' and '800x600 (4:3)' resolutions.\nAccording to the http://www.garrypassarella.co.uk/2011/04/23/add-undetected-resolutions-in-ubuntu/ :\nI see no /etc/X11/xorg.conf file in that directory.

Finally I have placed it as a start-up application for both users according to the How to run commands at login on ubuntu 12.04?   and it works: the resolution is now really 1920x1080; I \"only\" need to close a remaining warning that the system could not apply the stored configuration for monitors.

You can add additional resolutions that already exist in the list xandr shows just by putting them in quotes and adding them to the end of the modes line.\nSo for reference, mine looks like this:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n  Identifier \"Monitor0\"\n  Modeline \"1280x1024_60.00\"  109.00  1280 1368 1496 1712  1024 1027 1034 1063 -hsync +vsync\nEndSection\nSection \"Screen\"\n  Identifier \"Screen0\"\n  Device \"VGA1\"\n  Monitor \"Monitor0\"\n  DefaultDepth 24\n  SubSection \"Display\"\n    Depth 24\n    Modes \"1280x1024_60.00\" \"1024x768\" \"800x600\"\n  EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nAnd you’re done!\nOnce you’ve saved 10-monitor.conf in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/, restart your computer and you should have your brand new resolution available and set as default.\nexcerpt modified by me used this on Ubuntu 12.04 this is working I reboot and it does not revert, \nsource: http://samuelmartin.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/enabling-resolutions-in-ubuntu-12-04-lubuntu-12-04/\nOnly difference is in the beggining he used gtf 1920 1080 60 where as I used cvt 1280 1024 60\nI hope this is of some use to some\n\nA: gdm was replaced by lightdm.

But when Mathematica finishes computation, CPU usage remains at 100% for up to 15 minutes.\nCan anyone explain why?\n\nA: Your CPU might have overheated more than the fan/heatsink could cool it. Ubuntu would then have clocked down the CPU to keep it from burning out. It would then have only been clocked 'back up' once it cooled down again.\nYou could check to see if the fan/heatsink are not blocked by dust that would cause the cooling to be ineffective and clean the inside every few months from dust.\n", "Q: Wine fails to start Foxit Reader When I tried to install Foxit Reader through wine, I got the following error pop-up window.

I need help crafting a crontable entry that will make sure the MongoDB service (daemon) is running on a particular port and if it is not, start it.  I want to set this up so that if MongoDB crashes, it is automatically restarted.  I'd like to have the check occur every five minutes.  I have done this for other server processes but those services automatically exit if they find the port they want to bind to is already in use.  My concern as a MongoDB newbie is that I'll end up starting yet another instance of MongoDB every five minutes instead of making sure only one instance is loaded.  For example, here is my crontable entry for a chatbot service I keep running:\n0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * cd /home/[username]/ChatScript; ./LinuxChatscript32 2>/home/[username]/cronserver.log \n\nHow can I create something similar for MongoDB?\n\nA: */5 * * * * /bin/bash -c 'if ! pgrep mongod; then /usr/sbin/service mongodb start; fi'\n\n\nA: Take a look at  supervisor.\nIt's supposed to do exactly that.\n\nA: For anyone who stumbles upon this now, I have found Monit to be most useful for this. https://mmonit.com/ it can monitor the port and restart if necessary as well as monitor ram/cpu usage.\nThe reason I would suggest this is because, in my experience, mongodb can appear to be online with the process still running, but not responding due to high cpu usage or running out of ram.\n", "Q: Docky lubuntu autohide issue I installed lunbutu 13.04 with docky and when i open windows the dock is not hiding.\nI tried to enable auto hiding in dock setting but will not let me change the setting,also i can't change to 3d dock.Every time i enter docky it say that composititng is not enabled.\nAny way to enable compositing or at least fix autohide THX\n\nA: Use gconf-editor  to change Metacity options in apps/metacity/general\nYou need to tick compositing_manager and possibly compositor_effects.

I did research online, and tried the solutions, but couldn't make it to work for me. I did service cron start and it said it was already running. I also restarted the service. The permissions are set correctly, I gave all users read, write, and execute permissions just to make sure (I know the permissions are correct).\n\nA: Regarding your test script -- crontab jobs are not connected to a physical console, so don't expect any output. Try\n* * * * * /bin/touch /tmp/foo\n\n... and see whether the /tmp/foo file gets updated. It should.\nTo get a script running every five minutes, there is a shortcut:\n*/5 * * * * /bin/sh /whatever/script/blah.sh\n\nFurthermore, I would edit your script such that it logs its activity. For example,\nLOGFILE=/var/log/leoncleaner.log\n# ...\necho `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` Starting server >> $LOGFILE\n\nAlternatively, you can redirect the output from the crontab file directly:\n*/5 * * * * /bin/sh /whatever/script/blah.sh >> /var/log/leoncleaner.log\n\n\nA: Try running echo PATH=$PATH > path.tmp.  Then add the contents of path.tmp to the beginning of your script.  This will provide the same path you have interactively to the script. \nYou may want to add a bang path to beginning of your scrript.  Something like #!/bin/bash  should work.   \nAlso make sure your script is executable.  Run the command chmod +x m.sh.  Then test your script can be run as ./m.sh.\nOutput of the script should be mailed to the user id of the crontab it is running.   In the case of root, ensure you have an alias to a user id you are monitoring for mail in /etc/aliases.  Generally, you don't want output from cron scripts unless something fails.  Redirect output to a log if you need it.  \n", "Q: Installing ubuntu on usb and booting on uefi I have a new Laptop with Windows 8 preinstalled. I want to install Ubuntu on a USB stick.

The Cups error message then turns into:\n\n\"cannot load library\"\n\n\nA: I also had a \"cannot specify model number\" error.\nTurned out, the printer driver was from Canon package (cnijfilter), however, the printer description (PPD) was from GutenPrint package - they are incompatible.\nFixed by changing the PPD file to the one from Canon (Printer properties -> Make and Model -> Change, then select the appropriate driver - mine was called \"MG4200 Ver 3.90\").\n\nA: Here is a setup that works on all my systems now, Ubuntu or Windows:\n1.) I use the older 32bit-driver ver. 3.30 that is also available directly from Canon.\n2.)

I just made a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and I wasn't sure how to go about all partitioning, and mount points. \nThe installer wanted each to be mounted in a different place, and so I did it. Now when I open the File system, in / I see 99 GB of free space, but when I change to /home/chris/ directory, there is only 31.7 GB free. How can I access the remaining over 45 GB that there should be? \nI tried cd /dev/sda5 , but it warns me that such directory does not exist. \nIf I entirely made it wrong, please let me know what partitioning should I have done, I can always reinstall again. All your help is really appreciated.\n\nA: Most desktop users today don't bother splitting /usr off into a separate partition. In fact, Ubuntu's default setup doesn't split off any separate filesystem partitions (although Ubuntu does create a swap partition). This has the advantage of simplicity, but IMHO it's best to split off /home to its own partition, because that makes it easier to re-install without losing your user settings and files. Beyond that, some users do split off /usr, /tmp, /var, and other partitions; but unless you know what you're doing and how to size these partitions properly, it's best not to do so.\nIn your case, IMHO you should delete all your Linux partitions (backing up any user data first) and re-install. Make your root (/) partition about 20-30GiB, make a swap partition that's about 1.5-2 times the size of your RAM, and give the rest of your available space to /home. That will put most of your free space where it will be useful to you for storing user files (in /home), while still giving you room for installing new programs (on /), should you decide to do so. Note that this is just my personal recommendation. Other people may give other suggestions. If so, no one of us is right or wrong in any absolute sense. There are a lot of ways to do things in Linux, and partitioning suggestions tend to vary in fairly subtle effects -- or at least, reasonable partitioning suggestions vary subtly. When a partitioning scheme is way off (as yours is, I'm afraid), the effects are more noticeably undesirable.\n\nA: You have created 4 separate partitions in your machine\n\n\n*\n\n*partition 1 - /dev/sd7  -- /    contains 107 GB Space\n\n*partition 2 - /dev/sda1 -- /home  contains 34 GB Space\n\n*partition 3 - /dev/sda5 -- /usr  contains 43 GB Space\n\n*partition 4 - /dev/sda6 -- swap\nUse this command in your terminal\ndf -h\n\nIt'll display all the disk usage statistics. You can navigate to the directories using mounting points but you cannot use partition names/device names\n\nA: Your /dev/sda5 is mounted on /usr\nIf you want to change the mount point you need to make a new mountpoint (a directory). For example, if you want to mount your /dev/sda5 on /home/hdtwo\n#mkdir /home/hdtwo\n#mount /dev/sda5 /home/hdtwo\n\nif you want to access it, you could then run\n#cd /home/hdtwo\n\n\nA: There are up to 4 primary partitions possible. A swap or an extended partition is handled like a primary partition. So your hard-disk could look like this (if you leave away one swap-partition here in example - there would be space for another primary partition ) :\nJust an idea, it would be possible too like this:\n/dev/sda1    swap    (with about 4.096 GB)\n/dev/sda2    swap    (with about 4.096 GB)\n/dev/sda3    extended-number1 (with totally 100 GB)\n/dev/sda4    /        (ext4 - root with    60.00 GB)\n/dev/sda5    /usr     (ext4 - with about    40.00 GB)\n/dev/sda6    /home    (ext4 - with          78.118 GB)\n\nNo remaining \"unallocated space\" - all partitions to work with, are lying within extended partition - so you could access them normally and change between them. root with 80 GB or with 60 GB would be big enough for the partition totally with 186.31 GB. I chose here a sort of \"tandem-swap\" - but if you take only one swap, then /home would have in total 82.118 GB - so this would be good-looking in the end.\nAssumed /home partition would lie in outer space of extended partition (gparted refuses this to do) - then it would not be possible to do data-exchange from /home to / or to /usr.\n", "Q: Assign users to /home folders after fresh install To the point:\nAfter a fresh install, I cannot figure out how to assign users to existing folders on the /home partition.\nThe details:\nI upgraded from 10.04 to 12.04.

The next to last is the home directory which you can change at will. But one important thing is the number in the 3rd column which muust match the userid permissions of all the files in that directory. You can either change it there or reassign an entire home dir:\nsudo chown -R 31415 /home/callig\n\n\nA: You have a few options. \n\n\n*\n\n*As mentioned by @dargaud, you could modify the /etc/passwd file such that it no longer points to /home/andy but to /home/andyl1. PRO: easiest solution. CON: as you have updated the system, the new directories with default directory skeletons might contain configurations that work better with the current version. Furthermore, having home directory with a different name than your username is annyoing.\n\n*Move /home/andy to /home/andy.tmp, then /home/andy1 to /home/andy. That way, you keep the new skeletons as a backup. CON: same as the first \"CON\" above. You can make it automatically:\nfor dir in /home/*l1 ; do\n  home=`basename $dir l1`\n  mv \"$home\" \"$home.backup\"\n  mv \"$dir\" \"$home\"\ndone\n\n\n*Try to identify the potential problems, and improve solution (2) such that you transfer some of the new configuration files to the new locations.\n\n*Let the work to the users -- tell them to transfer the files they want to the new homes.

Such a partition can contain other partitions. Because an extended partition is also a primary partition it might be necessary to remove a primary partition first.\n\nHere's a Screen Shot:\n\nsda1 is that small space that windows loves to create for reasons unclear to me\nsda2 and sda4 are windows 8 drives C: and E:\nsda3 is my linux drive\nthe last unallocated 10.2MB? I have no idea where that came from.\nBut why is Ubuntu counting Window's drives as primary?\nBut more importantly, how can I get that 90GB back, Win8 Disk Management also gives some error :(\n\nA: This is a limitation of the partition table. The partition table has only enough space to hold the informations of 4 partitions therefore you cannot create more than 4 primary partitions.\nTo have more than 4 partitions you have to create an extended partition. In this extended partition you can create more partitions as needed and can then create more than 4 partitions.\nThe primary partitions are named sda1, sda2, sda3 and sda4 in your case. The partitions in the extended partition will then be called sda5, sda6 and so on.\n\nA: Uwe Plonus's explanation is correct, but gives no solution to your problem. Here's the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot a Linux emergency disc. (The Ubuntu installer in its \"try before installing\" mode should work fine; or you can use Parted Magic or something similar.\n\n*Launch GParted.\n\n*If any of the logical partitions (those with numbers of 5 and up) are locked (typically with a little key icon, as in your screen shot), unmount them. There should be an option to do this when you right-click the icon. Your swap partition is the only one that's likely to be so affected, and its unmount opiton is called \"swapoff.\"\n\n*Right-click the extended partition (this is easier in the list in the bottom pane of the window) and select the option to resize the partition.\n\n*Adjust the size of the extended partition to fill the available space.\n\n*Create your new partition within the extended partition, which should now contain the unallocated space.\n\n*Click the \"apply\" icon (typically a green check-mark).\n\n\nA: You can create only 4 primary partitions in a HDD.

I downloaded the required PPD from the Sharp site and installed it using the CUPS Gui on localhost:631\nThe department requires us to identify by \"user identification\" (Actually in German it reads Benutzernummer, which would be literally \"user number\").

Without that number, jobs get silently ignored. (printer seems to accept job but ignores it)\n\nA: File to change is /etc/cups/ppd/{your_printer_id}.ppd.

The only way I have overcome this is by using my keyboard's \"brighten the screen\" button.  Only then does the screen the login or lock menu.  I was hoping that at some point, an update would fix the problem.  But as of now, it has stayed the same, and I have been putting up with it for nearly three months.  Why does 13.04 cause my laptop screen to go black?  Is there a way to fix it?\nThe laptop in question is a HP Pavilion dv4-2160us Entertainment Notebook\n\nA: This has been reported as a bug. \nBug #765438 On startup, the backlight is off on laptop\n", "Q: No games work at all So far I have tried downloading Steam and even Tux Racer, and nothing will run.

I'm looking for suggestions for software that reminds me of the birthdays and anniversary of friends, like MS Outlook. I also need to be able to import contact details from Outlook to Ubuntu.\n\nA: You may wish to give a chance to Evolution (Available in the Software Center), which is one of the various alternatives to Outlook in Ubuntu.\nThis video shows the easy steps for how to process a .pst file in order to import your Address Book the same as your Mail, Appointments, Tasks and Journal entries in the same process for a created account in Evolution, after which you can work with your data with ease from within Evolution.\n\nPlease notice that the picture was taken as a screenshot in the video.\nI am aware that other software, such as Thunderbird offers the same workarounds but I prefer Evolution.\nEvolution integrates in Ubuntu so that you'll receive notifications of new email (if properly configured), appointment's reminders and/or birthdays/anniversaries from your contacts (as you wish).\nIf you need further support, don't hesitate to drop a comment.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Thunderbird (and I assume Evolution) is a multipurpose email client, just like Outlook. It supports contacts and calendars, including birthdays.\nThunderbird should be installed by default if your'e running a recent version of Ubuntu. If not, open the Software Centre and search for it, or from the commandline enter sudo apt-get install thunderbird\nTo import contacts in Thunderbird:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to 'Tools' > 'Import...' and select 'Address Books'\n\n*Select the file type that you exported from Outlook (LDIF, .tab, .csv. .txt, or .vcf)\n\n*Select the file you wish to import.

Why is it attempting to use the NVidia driver (I don't have it installed).\n(EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not found)\n\nA: Something must have installed the 'nvidia-common' package which enables the NVidia check.

When I press one of them, the following appears on my screen:\n\nAnyone got an idea how I could make the controls work?\nThanks!\n\nA: The behaviour you observe indicates that these controls are not implemented in your Spotify client.\nMedia key control via a Bluetooth headset is transmitted via DBus MPRIS protocol to the player to be further processed there.\nYou can test this by running Rhythmbox which should have a full implementation of the MPRIS standard (but unforutnately a Spotify plugin seems not easy to get). On my system here I am able to control the Rhythmbox playback including fast forward and rewind buttons from a Bluetooth headset. But I am unable to do so with a player that does not support MPRIS (e.g. Audacious) where I also get the warning sign you posted in your question.\nYou may need a fully MPRIS complatible media player that comes with a Spotify plugin.

Can that command be used to download torrents faster like an album your downloading through a torrent client such as Transmission, and, if so, what do you put at the end of the command to specify what to speed up, eg:do you put apt-fast-(link address) or apt-fast-(eminem discography)? Also, could you run this command in the middle of your download or does it have to be done at the start?\n\nA: Torrents are already fast in this sense, because they download from multiple peers, and start at different parts of the file, downloading in many more pieces then can be achieved with a download accelerator.\napt-fast downloads multiple parts of the file from the same source.\nYou may be able to use Axel or aria2 (what apt-fast uses) to download regular files, but not with torrents.\n\nIf you are asking how to use apt-fast, It is used exactly like apt-get is used to install programs. https://askubuntu.com/a/171562/47291\n", "Q: (Steam) Mount ext4 partition with exec permissions I have most of my disk space in an ext4 partition which I automountt on startup through fstab.

Is this the correct solution for the mentioned issue?\n\nA: The defaults option in fstab will give you what you want. As per mount , \nman mount \ndefaults\n          Use default options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async.\n\nSo a line like \n/dev/sda9 /media/rest    ext4  defaults    0  0\n\nshould be OK. \n\nA: If you use defaults but later you use users, it comes with its own set of options.\nFrom man mount:\nusers\n  Allow any user to mount and to unmount the filesystem, even when some other ordinary user mounted it. This  option  implies  the  options noexec, nosuid, and nodev (unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line users,exec,dev,suid).\n\nSo a proper line to have exec permissions and allow users to mount/umount would be:\n/dev/sda9 /media/rest    ext4  defaults,users,exec    0  0\n\nThere's no need to use users and user, the first one covers the second.\n", "Q: Can't install linux headers I keep getting an error:\nE:The package linux-headers-3.5.0-31-generic needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.\n\nI have searched everywhere for this error and how to fix it but since this came up there has been no reference to this anywhere.\nAny help please or it will be a complete re-install to get rid of the problem.\n\n\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release amd64 (20120425)]/ dists/precise/main/binary-i386/\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release amd64 (20120425)]/ dists/precise/restricted/binary-i386/\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release amd64 (20120425)]/ precise main restricted\n# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to\n# newer versions of the distribution.\ndeb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring main restricted\ndeb-src http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring main restricted\n## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the\n## distribution.\ndeb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-updates main restricted\ndeb-src http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-updates main restricted\n## N.B. software from this repository is ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu\n## team.

Even I cannot say that for myself, since I've had quite a lot of trouble until I got my system in a state that I wanted to. But I guess it is always the case when you are trying to install GNU/Linux on a laptop and especially on a newer one.\nI have the very same model (Lenovo Y510p) with Ubuntu 13.10 installed which is currently running quite well. My model is the one with only one graphics card (Nvidia GeForce GT755M). \n\nLet me try and break down the current state of my machine:\nGraphics: I'm currently using the integrated Intel GPU for the system and I'm able to use Nvidia for a process with a command. (Bumblebee) Actually this is just what I want since I don't want my laptop heating up without any need just because it's using the Nvidia graphics. And it saves a bit of battery power to use the integrated Intel GPU as well :) So you only call the heavy artillery (Nvidia) when it's needed. There are still a few glitches that need to be fixed. (e.g, The brightness is automatically set to 0 when booting and I need to set it up manually with my keyboard.) But for now I'm happy.\n\nAudio I/O: No issues so far. Works like a charm.\n\nBluetooth: Works fine but has a few problems as well. (e.g., When you resume from sleep, my devices are not able to connect.) So far I have found some workarounds but they are not very convenient.\n\nTouchpad: After some set up it works pretty decent.\n\n\nI cannot currently think of other things that could be relevant to what you would demand from your machine. Please feel free to ask me if you want to know something more.\nIf I (personally and subjectively) had to give some compatibility score, it'd be:\nCompatibility with Ubuntu: 5/10\nI'm yet giving such a low score, since I would expect all the things to work out of the box without the need to further configure and tweak.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I bought one with no OS installed and it was relatively easy to install Ubuntu (1 Nvidia 755m).

Is there any way to change the default behaviour to be 'do nothing unless I explicitly turn it on'?\n(Note to answerers: I'm not looking to globally disable ipv6, or completely turn off autoconf.  I'm looking to disable autoconf by default (as in, I don't want ipv6 unless I say so in /etc/network/interfaces, in the same way that I don't just get a v4 address unless I've explicitly turned on dhcp).  What's happening is that, for any interface that's up - e.g. has an ipv4 config - a v6 address tends to just turn up on the interface as well, despite the fact that I've not enabled that explicitly.  The solutions to date are fine as far as they go, but if I disable v6 or autoconf globally, I can't then re-enable v6 on a per-interface basis with a simple command in /etc/network/interfaces.  I'm fairly sure I'm asking for the moon on a stick, mind you.)\n\nA: To check if IPv6 is enabled or disabled\n$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6\n\n0 means it’s enabled and 1 is disabled.\nTo disable IPv6\n$ su -\n# nano /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nand add these lines to sysctl.conf file\n#disable ipv6\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\n\nSave sysctl.conf file with new config, then reboot your system\n# reboot\n\nCheck your system again\n$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6\n\nNow you should see “1″ means IPv6 has been disabled on your system.\nFrom http://namhuy.net/1419/disable-ipv6-ubuntu-linux-mint.html\n\nA: Similar to, but different from, one of the other answers, I tried this with a great deal of joy:\nAdd a sysctl file in /etc/sysctl.d to disable ipv6 - not universally, though, just as an interface default state:\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1\n\nThen, in the interfaces file and for only the interfaces you wish to have ipv6 on, add:\niface eth0 inet dhcp # .. or whatever\nup sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.$IFACE.disable_ipv6=0\n\n... thus, interfaces don't get IPv6 addresses when they come up (as currently) but can be persuaded to have them in specific cases.  You could no doubt disable RAs before enabling ipv6 if that's what you wanted, too.\nNB: I suspect you'll run into issues with VLAN named interfaces (e.g. eth0.100) and will have to spell that out in the 'up' command as 'eth0/100' rather than $IFACE, which will have the wrong format - I haven't tested, but that seems to be how sysctl views the world.\n\nA: Autoconf in part of the basic functionality of IPv6.  RA announcements are not DHCP, and the RA server does not assign addresses. RA is much closer to the IPv4 auto-configuration done on the 169.254.0.0/16 IP range.  If privacy is enabled, your IPv6 address will change over time.  Your old address will be retired and eventually removed.\nYou can disable ipv6 autoconf easily with the command:\nsudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.autoconf=0\n\nSubstitute all with the interface name to disable one interface.  Replace autoconf with disable_ipv6 to disable IPv6.  Create a file in /etc/sysctl.d with the variable assignments you want to have the setting applied during startup. \nTo find all the ipv6 related settings run the command:\nsudo sysctl -a | grep ipv6 | less\n\n", "Q: How to acces from live cd to windows 7 disks?

If your interface is configured via DHCP then it's probably being sent by the DHCP server. Then fix the DHCP server configuration. If NetworkManager is involved, use the Connection Editor to make sure that localdomain is not in the Additional search domains field on the IPv4 Settings tab of any active connections.\n\nA: I have a similar issue where resolution without a dot tries to resolve to the localdomain, which I do not want.\nlocaldomain is added to the symlinked /etc/resolv.conf file on Ubuntu 18.04 which is managed by systemd-resolved according to the file comments.\nI found some info on how to set search domains but it does not explain the presence of this specific domain, I am guessing it's some kind of default.\nIt's possible to set search domains like this :\nsudo systemd-resolve --set-domain=local --set-domain=prod.ldap --interface=enxxxxxxxxx\n\nIf anyone can explain where and why localdomain is always present it's appreciated.\nThe above command can be used to set per interface search domains, which seems like a good workaround - this does not survive a reboot.\nAnother option to set search domains is to use the network manager GUI tha was hidden, run from a terminal:\nnm-connection-editor\n\nThere you can set search domains, those will be appended to localdmain, not replace it.\nI hope this helps anyone.\n", "Q: Ubuntu running slow and laggy My Ubuntu has been running pretty slow, but I don't know why. I have the latest updates and all. I installed Ubuntu i368 on a AMD processor does that effect the speed? \nThank you.\n\nA: Very little information to go on here, but I'm going to take a shot at it anyway.  Normally when Ubuntu gets laggy for no obvious reason it has to do with gvfs-metadata.  This is particularly true if you've been moving files around a bit.  It's a pretty easy fix.  All you have to do is close Nautilus or whatever file browser you are running, open an terminal and type the following:\npkill gvfsd-metadata\nthen hit ENTER and when you get the prompt back, type:\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata\nThe first command stops the gvfsd process, and the second command erases gvfs-metadata file which often becomes corrupt or just too big.  Don't worry, though, a fresh new gvfs-metadata file is created as soon as the gvfsd process starts back up.  At the very least this does no harm and gives you a bit more speed / CPU usage.  The worst case scenario is that you see a bit of improvement.  The best case is that this fixes your problem.\n\nA: If you followed Blind Fish replied you may also would want to consider installing Preload, (adaptive readahead daemon) see here:https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/search/?q=preload&op= read the description FYI....\nLuis\n", "Q: Secure boot not enabled and disk partition in install type not shown I have an ASUS Q400A notebook which originally came with Windows 8, but I reformatted the hard drive and it is now running Windows 7 as the main OS.\nI was able to run both Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.04 along with Windows 7 as dual boot. I uninstalled Ubuntu 12.04 to install Ubuntu 13.04, but now when I reboot the system with a live CD, it says:\n\nSecure boot not enabled\n\nSo I changed secure boot from disabled to enabled from BIOS -- doing that gives another error saying:\n\nBinary is whitelisted\n\nSo, I deleted the Windows 8 volume, extended the C drive to the Windows 8 volume, and formatted the Ubuntu volume (I). I have 2 partitioned drives C and D(for Ubuntu) and 100MB for system recovery.\nBeside that, while installing, it won't show my disk partition on install type. It just shows /dev/sda 750 something.\nI did chdisk and defrag to see if anything was wrong with the partitioning, but no errors were shown.\n\nA: First, neither the \"Secure Boot not enabled\" nor the \"binary is whitelisted\" messages are errors. Those messages are displayed by the shim program, which is one of two programs for working with Secure Boot systems. The \"Secure Boot not enabled\" message means just that -- the computer is configured to boot without Secure Boot (or it doesn't support Secure Boot at all). The \"binary is whitelisted\" message means that the follow-on program (typically GRUB) is registered with a valid key. These are not errors and they are not diagnostic of any problems. Unfortunately, the follow-on program will sometimes crash without displaying any output, thus making the normal shim status messages look like errors, but they aren't, and trying to act on these messages as if they were errors can result in wasted time. I do recommend, however, returning to your firmware setup and disabling Secure Boot; it can cause problems in some cases, so it's best to proceed with it disabled until you get things working. If you want to use Secure Boot in the long run, you can re-enable it later.\nBeyond that, it's unclear to me precisely what you've done. It sounds as if you've deleted Windows 8 and adjusted your partitions in some way, but it's not clear what happens when you boot the Ubuntu installer. You write that \"while installing it won't show my disk partition on install type,\" which implies that the installer is running but you're having problems with the partitioning. It sounds like you're seeing a completely blank partition table, but I'm not really 100% positive of that. If I'm right, then that indicates either leftover RAID data or a damaged partition table. You may be able to fix a damaged partition table with gdisk -- see its documentation for details. To provide more precise advice, I'll need more details. The output of gdisk -l /dev/sda and sgdisk -v /dev/sda would be most helpful. (You'll need to install the gdisk package to use the gdisk and sgdisk commands; or run them from Parted Magic.)\n", "Q: Windows 7 Virtualbox guest in seamless mode has bottom clipped off in Ubuntu 13.04 I realise that this is a duplicate of this post but I was unable to comment on that one.\nI am able to replicate this issue on a fresh install of 13.04\nI have tried installing the prop nvidia drivers, this had no effect\nI then put Cinnamon and KDE on to see what would happen. Neither desktop had this issue, it only happens with Unity. The area clipped seems to be exactly the same size as the footer of the guest in a normal window.\nThis clipping only occurs in seamless mode. And only effects the guests windows (Windows 7). A window from the host (Ubuntu 13.04) renders correctly to the bottom of the screen.\nI have tried different resolutions on both the host and the guest, no effect.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\nEDIT: Also if I move the mouse near the bottom of the screen it sort of scrolls down to show the clipped off bit. This was noted in the other post but what is interesting is that the visible part of each open window also scrolls. I mean that if you have a command prompt open and you move you mouse to the bottom of the screen the menu bar at the top disappears and an equal area of the guests desktop is revealed at the bottom.\nEDIT: If I plug a second screen into the laptop and apply the display changes, the problem goes away. But if I then reboot the VM it bluescreens on boot until I unplug the second screen and reboot....\n\nA: I've recently encountered this bug, when switching from Seemless Mode to FullScreen Mode, and some how the top and Bottom gets clipped... I went to the Display settings only to see something like \"1366x747\" or something like that.. instead of \"1366x768\". After many attempts, I think I have found the solution.\nSolution: \nFollow Instructions on this page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution#Adding_undetected_resolutions\nExample (What I did):\nMy Screen Resolution is 1366x768\n$ cvt 1366 768 60\n# 1368x768 59.88 Hz (CVT) hsync: 47.79 kHz; pclk: 85.25 MHz\nModeline \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync\n\nCopied everything after \"Modeline\"\n$ xrandr --newmode \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync\n\nrun xrandr command with the copied line\n$ xrandr --addmode VBOX0 1366x768\n\nSave the newly-created mode\n$ xrandr --output VBOX0 --mode 1366x768\n\nApply the newly-created mode and You're done!\nNow go check in the display settings and everything should be good.\nNOTE: Just do what I did but I do strongly recommend actually running the commands and not just copying the \"Modeline\" in the example, since it could be different for you even if you have the same screen resolution as me. This was done with the VirtualBox Guest Additions Installed, I don't know if it works without it, it should work though...\n\nA: *\n\n*Click on workspace switcher.\n\n*Move Virtualbox machine window to another workspace.\n\n*Touch the machine window to the top of the workspace and it will maximize.\n\n*Switch to the workspace.\n\n", "Q: Inexperienced Ubuntu user trying to set up internet connection on laptop with 13.04 I haven't installed 13.04 yet, but I need to know how to access internet before I install. Can I get instructions? Wireless will be my main form of connection.\n\nA: You can set it up BEFORE installing so no worries there.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check your router and take note of your passphrase and encryption details (Ubuntu does not work with WEP anymore since that is broken by design; make sure it is WPA2). You need the password later.\n\n*Use \"try Ubuntu\" before \"install Ubuntu\";\n\n*Select your wireless;\n\n*Insert and save password;\n\n*When it connects Ubuntu use the \"install Ubuntu\" shortcut to start installing. The installer can then also fetch packages from the web for the 3rd party extras (like mp3 support) and/or upgraded software.\n\n\nIn the rare case it does not find your network or does not pick up your card you can still stop the installation and first check out why this is. You will need your wireless card details (brand, chipset etc) and search for it on AskUbuntu, ubuntuforums or the Ubuntu WIKI in case it is hardware related.  \nSince you said \"main\" form of connection: of course you can also use a wired connection after installation to fix a wireless network problem. You only need to do this one time and only if the wireless connection gives problems.\n\nA: If you are running Ubuntu 13.04 via Live DVD/CD it should be able to detect your wireless card automatically and you should be able to see a notification letting you know that there is wireless connections available, are you not seeing this if running Ubuntu via Live CD/DVD?\nLuis\n", "Q: Cannot find the .iso file to create a live USB disk Hi, it may be obvious once you have read this but I am new to using Ubuntu 13.04. I have got it up and running, and I've been online so far so good. I am now trying to create a bootable USB stick, it's a 4 Gb formatted fat32 disk.\nI opened Startup Disk Creator, the USB stick shows in bottom portion of the make a start up disc window and this is where it falls apart for. I click on other to select the iso file but it does not show up under desktop or any of the other places in the left pane. Any and all help will be gratefully received. Thanks.\n\nA: When you open Startup Disk Creator, you see in the Make Startup Disk window the following text: Source disk image (.iso) or CD. In order to get the ISO file that you need, visit the Download Ubuntu Desktop webpage.\nBecause the Ubuntu ISO is a large file, it is better to copy its link location and then download it with wget, because wget can resume broken downloads. To download a file from source http://www.ubuntu.com/start-download?distro=desktop&more-stuff... and save it to your Desktop, open the terminal and run the following command (for Ubuntu 13.04. For later versions of Ubuntu follow the 4 steps below the command to replace the Ubuntu 13.04 download link with the current download link):\ncd ~/Desktop && wget -c http://www.ubuntu.com/start-download?distro=desktop&more-stuff...\n\nIn Ubuntu 14.04 and later replace the link in the above command: http://www.ubuntu.com/start-download?distro=desktop&more-stuff... with the link that you get when you visit the Download Ubuntu Desktop webpage and then follow these steps to get the URL of your download link:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose your flavour from the dropdown menu.\n\n*Click the Download button.\n\n*Click the link at the bottom of the page that says: Not now, take me to the download ›\n\n*Right-click the link to the correct iso file to download where it says download now and from the context menu select Copy Link Location. The exact wording of the Copy Link Location menu entry may vary depending on what web browser you are using. The link location is the URL of your download link.\nAfter you have downloaded the ISO file, the md5 checksum hash is used for file verification. The Ubuntu Documentation UbuntuHashes wiki contains all of the md5 Hashes for the different versions of Ubuntu. Let's assume that you downloaded a file called FILE.iso to your Desktop, and you want to find its md5 checksum. To find the md5 checksum of a file called FILE.iso, open the terminal and type:\ncd ~/Desktop\nmd5sum FILE.iso\n\nWhen the ISO has been downloaded and its md5 checksum has been verified, it is ready to use in Startup Disk Creator.\n", "Q: Live USB Boot Error I am trying to install Ubuntu on an Acer Aspire 5320 laptop that was abandonded by a friend when he purchased a new machine.  I have created several different Live USB drives using my primary Ubuntu computer and both Startup Disk Creator and Unetbootin.  I have verified that these disks are all bootable using a third computer, a Gateway that is currently running Linux Mint.  The problem is that every time I put one of these into the Acer I get a black screen with a two word message:  Boot Error.  I have entered the CMOS and ensured that the USB is the first boot option, so the error is being thrown in relation to the USB.  I have since taken the situation from bad to worse.  The Acer was running Windows Vista.  The Windows installation worked but was hopelessly slow.  I was able to boot into Vista and access the USB from inside Windows.  It gave me the option of booting to the USB now ( which I knew would throw the aforementioned boot error ) or creating a boot helper on the hard drive.  I opted for creating the boot helper.  This ran to about 70% when it threw an error because there was no more space on the hard drive ( I know, I'm an idiot for not checking.  My friend had literally crammed her entire hard drive with photos and videos. ).  The result of this being that apparently just enough of the boot helper made it's way onto the hard drive that now when I try to boot to the hard drive I get absolutely nothing.  Just a black screen with a cursor.  I can no longer get into Windows, and I cannot boot to the USB.  I appear to be completely stuck.  I saw one similar question on here and the suggestion was to go into the BIOS and reset the USB Mass Storage option, but that is not an option in the CMOS on this Acer.  The CMOS is extremely limited.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You can fix boot problems with Windows using it's Repair CD or installation media. But before this I recommend you free some space on hard drive. There are several ways of doing this. You can use aforementioned Windows tools, but it is much easier to run Ubuntu LiveCD because it looks like much more normal system. Be sure that you chose right version of CD's architecture, I suspict you made 64-bit USB stick while your laptop has 32-bit Intel Celeron processor.\nAnd if this does not help, you can extract hard drive from laptop and try to repair it on another computer.\n", "Q: Launch Chrome with a very minimal Window manager So i'm setting up a box running Lubuntu and i want it to run a news website with Chrome browser on startup and with a very minimal window manager (no desktop icons,no panel...).\nIs there any way to trick Lightdm or another window manager to start and run one and only app ?\nThanks.\n\nA: Window managers don't start apps.\n~/.xinitrc:\n#!/bin/sh\nsh -c \"while true; do google-chrome; done\" &\nexec metacity\n\n", "Q: Can't run a .sh file even when changing directory I want to know how to excute a .sh file.

And how can I fix this? Thanks.\n\nAdditional info:\nI use zsh rather than bash. Is this a shell compatibility issue?\n\nA: I don't think that this is a shell issue. However, I do see that other people have this problem as well -- there is even a bug report on that. Apparently, the files end up in /usr/lib and when ldconfig tries to process them, it naturally fails. However, since that is only a warning, maybe you should not worry about it? Alternatively, you could try to move them to temporary location somewhere and see where it gets you.\nTry figuring out to which package this file belongs (for example with apt-file search \"libisl.so.10.1.1-gdb.py\"; I think it might be libisl8-dbg -- do you need this package?), and check whether the package itself (or packages that depend on that package) run w/o problems.

I realized that a lot of the installations came in the form of tar and deb files. I have no idea how to install tar files so I searched and found that you can covert them into deb files and install them using the Ubuntu Software Center.\nSo I did that, but when the deb file finished installing I looked for the program in the dash and could not find it. When I looked at the install section in the Ubuntu Software Center it was not there either. I just want to see if anyone can give me steps on how to install both deb and tar files since I’m new to Ubuntu and only used to the install processes in Windows. I really like this OS and would like to learn.\n\nBy the way, would some programming knowledge be needed to use this OS to its full potential? If so, what can I do to learn?\n\nA: There are several methods to install a program in Ubuntu. I will list them in order of ease.\n\n\n*\n\n*Look for the program in the Ubuntu Software Center.\nBy default, Ubuntu provides many programs which are free. These programs are available in your Ubuntu Software Center. This is the most hassle-free way to install, because once you install from the Software Center, any updates which come will be directly integrated with system update.\nAlso, it takes care of dependencies between software. For example, when a program wants to use a particular version of a shared library which is not available in your system, the Software Center downloads the required library.\n\n*Using PPAs. PPA stands for Personal Package Archives. These are software bundled for Ubuntu provided by the community. The updates are also integrated into system update. But be sure you are installing from a trusty source. In this method you add a source URL to your system. Install the software provided into that repo. One such example is Google Chrome. It is not available in Ubuntu’s repo, but you can add it and install Chrome.\nFor more information, please read “What are PPAs and how do I use them?”\n\n*Installing from source: This is what you get in tar/zipped format. This is general way of installing software in any Linux OS. In this process, you compile the program from source.\nOn the other hand, the deb files are nothing but a compiled form of software which are packaged in a way that is understandable by Ubuntu for an easier installation process.\nThe big disadvantage of compiling from source is that for any update you have to compile it again. If your software depends on the kernel (like the drivers), on each update you need to compile again.\nTo know more about the process, please read “How do I install a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) file?”\n", "Q: How to know what makes ubuntu shut down?

At some point a dialogue similar to this one should have been shown:\n\nIf you selected the first option, then your documents are still there. As Luis posted, in that case you should simply be able to access the Windows partition in Nautilus.\nIf however you selected the second option, that deletes \"all of your Windows programs, documents, photos, music, and all other files\", then your old documents are no longer accessible, and were possibly already overwritten, so that even professional data recovery companies will no longer be able to restore them.\nIf you chose the third option, you partitioned manually and you should remember what you did with the Windows partition...\n\nA: Are you dual booting? When you were installing Ubuntu, did you erase entire disk or install side by side as the installer prompt you to do so? When you open Nautilis are you able to see various file systems under devices? If so look for your Windows file system to access your documents.\nLuis\n\nA: If you dual booted, and an easy way to see if you did and to grab those files, head to File system from nautilus and see if there is a folder called \"host\" if there is, then you are able to get your documents, if not, you can't, to get them if you have that folder, you simply open it, and it shows the content of your windows 7 stuff, you should see a folder called \"users\", \"windows\", and \"program files\" just head into users select your main folder an viola, your windows seven stuff.\n", "Q: Can ubuntu run on 512MB Ram?

First basic truth you have to know: you should never do primary login as root and never use root as home user account! It is the fastest way to kill system, especially for new users. But in home user folder you can do ANYTHING. \nSet password to your root account and use it with caution. Ubuntu has a lot of scripts to do system tasks, use them instead of manual hacking. Now simpliest solution is to reinstall Ubuntu completely without formatting hard drive. This will keep all your data and restore system files. Though if you placed your data in wrong location like /etc, /usr, you have to move it in /home/user directory before you proceed.\nOr you can try to restore files you have deleted using this instruction.

My question is: How can I move the /usr partition in /home partition ?\n\nA: You have to copy the content. Please note that the following instructions may lead to data loss if you do not do them right. Therefore for such operations it is wise to make a backup first. Also note that I assume that you do this steps in a running system. Perhaps it would be easier to do the steps with a live CD. This only works if the /home is not encrypted. Also note that I write all commands from my head and have not tested it.\nFirst unmount the partition /usr:\nsudo umount /usr\n\nNext mount the partition to some arbitary mount point:\nsudo mount <partition> /mnt\n\nYou have to replace <partition with your real partition (e.g. /dev/sda5). I cannot tell you which partition is used.\nNext you have to copy all data to the /usr directory:\nsudo cp -dpR /mnt /usr\n\nAfter copying all data you can wipe the data from the partition:\nsudo rm -rf /mnt/*\n\nNow please check if there is any hidden file left:\nsudo ls -a /mnt\n\nThis command should only show two files: . and ..\nNext you can copy the content of your home directory to the wiped partition:\nsudo cp -dpR /home /mnt\n\nNext you have to change the file fstab and change the entry /usr to /home.\nNow when everything was done right you can reboot and have your home data on the extra partition.\n\nA: You should follow this guide: Partitioning/Home/Moving.\n", "Q: Unity is not responding to mouse clicks I am using Ubuntu for 5 weeks now.\nLast night Ubuntu did not respond to mouse clicks.

I wanted to gave my ubuntu partition more space of my HDD. Unfortunately, when I open GParted it showed me an unallocated space on my partitioning table. This very \"unallocated space\" actually contains my C:/ and D:/ partition of my windows 7. When I double clicked the item, it showed me this warning: \"unable to satisfy all constraints on the partition\".\nPlease, help me. I want my partitioning table to be fixed. So that, I can grow my ubuntu partition.\n\nA: If you're saying that GParted is showing the entire disk as being unallocated, then you probably have one of two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leftover RAID data -- If the disk was used with motherboard-based software RAID in the past, the leftover RAID data can confuse GParted. Typing sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda in Linux can correct this problem; however, you should be absolutely positive that the system isn't currently configured to use RAID before you do this. (Some computers use RAID even on single-disk setups -- weird, but true.)\n\n*A damaged partition table -- Any number of partition table problems can cause GParted to flake out and claim the disk is unpartitioned. Most of these can be fixed by using my FixParts program on the disk. This program is part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu.\n\n\nYou might also want to consult my Web page on this problem, which describes it in more detail.\nIf you mean that only some partitions seem to be missing, but others appear in GParted, then the problem has another cause. Providing more detail, such as the output of sudo parted /dev/sda print and a clear description of precisely what's missing, is necessary to diagnose and fix the problem.\n\nEdit: Based on the information in the comment below, it appears that the partition table is damaged. FixParts might be able to help, but I make no promises of that, and I advise caution in its use. If FixParts doesn't do an adequate job, TestDisk might be able to recover the lost partitions.\nBackground, and to answer your questions: On a traditional Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system (which you've got), there can be up to four primary partitions, one of which (the extended partition) can serve as a placeholder for an arbitrary number of logical partitions. The partition that fdisk has identified as w95 ext'd (lba) is an extended partition. Under Linux, primary partitions (including the extended partition, if one is present) are numbered 1-4, while logical partitions are numbered 5 and up. All the primary partitions are defined in the first sector of the disk (the MBR), but each logical partition is defined in its own data structure, known as an Extended Boot Record (EBR), which is similar in structure to an MBR. The message about \"invalid flag 0x6165 of partition table 7\" means that a key identifying feature of one of these EBRs is damaged. Depending on the partitioning software and the partitions involved, this can make it difficult or impossible to recover the partitions in the usual way.\nPartitions contain filesystems, but the two are distinct concepts -- a partition is just a set of contiguous sectors on the disk (say, sectors 2048 to 923,647). A filesystem is a much more complex data structure that enables you to store files in a partition. The two are often created and manipulated together, but there are tools for doing each part of the job separately. fdisk and parted, for instance, both manipulate partitions but not filesystems; while mkfs, tune2fs, fsck, and similar tools manipulate filesystems. Filesystem-manipulation tools typically take partition identifiers as arguments, since they need a way to locate their filesystems, and partitions do that -- the filesystem usually begins on the first sector of the containing partition. I'm babbling on about this because it's your partition table that's damaged; your filesystems may well be perfectly OK, except that with the partition table damaged, you have no way to identify their start points.\nTestDisk ignores the partition table and scans for filesystems in order to construct a new partition table, which is why it might be useful -- it doesn't need the data structures that are damaged. OTOH, scanning the whole disk for filesystems can be time-consuming and can turn up stray bits of old filesystems that are no longer valid, particularly if you've re-partitioned or moved filesystems on your disk in the past. TestDisk is also likely to fail if the filesystem is damaged, which could be the case -- whatever damaged your partition table might not have stopped there, but might have wreaked havoc with one or more filesystems. Thus, TestDisk should be used only as a last resort.\n", "Q: Simple way to recover a deleted file in a sub-dir of an encrypted home directory (ext4 file-system) I need a simple way to do it, such as one command or program to which:\n\n\n*\n\n*specify the directory the file was in\n\n*ask for the list of the recoverable files found \n\n*specify which files have to be undeleted\n\n*specify the output directory where the file shall be recovered\n\n*a \"start recovery\" command\n\n\nAs outlined in the title, the deleted file is in a sub directory of my /home/username/Desktop/ directory, and the whole /home/username directory content is encrypted as chosen during Ubuntu 13.04 installation.

What can I say -- sorry for lecturing you, but you really should have made backups. Nowadays backups are easy and cheap, and really not such an effort to make. You know what they say -- there are two kinds of people: those who do their backups regularly and those who will.\n", "Q: golden dict problem I have just install 'goldendict' on my ubuntu 13.04 and when I try to run it a massage apears :\nGoldenDict has crashed with an unexpected exception\n\nException: Config::exMalformedConfigFile\nMessage: The configuration file is malformed\n\nBacktrace:\n  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6(+0x5ef76) [0x7f874ddf3f76]\n  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6(+0x5efa3) [0x7f874ddf3fa3]\n  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6(+0x5f1de) [0x7f874ddf41de]\n  goldendict(Config::load()+0xa25) [0x484075]\n  goldendict(main+0x48a) [0x4584aa]\n  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xf5) [0x7f874d4d3ea5]\n  goldendict() [0x459d81]\n\ncan any body help me dealing with this problem ?\nthanks\n\nA: I think the error message is clear enough.

Here is a (command line) function that will automatically cd into a path for a given fully qualified file path: \nfunction fcd () { [ -f \"$1\" ] && { cd \"$(dirname \"$1\")\"; } || { cd \"$1\"; } ; pwd; }\n\n\nA: If you append \"/..\" to the filename that will take you to the correct directory e.g. cd /path/to/file.end/... It works on Cygwin anyway.\n\nA: Type cd $( dirname /path/to/file.end). That will take you into /path/to.\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*dirname returns the complete path for a file (without the filename, which you would get with basename) - i.e. dirname /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99update-notifier returns /etc/apt/apt.conf.d\n\n*the expression $(anything) is replaced by the result of the command in the parentheses. So cd $( dirname /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99update-notifier) is executed as cd /etc/apt/apt.conf.d\nAnother (but old and discouraged) notation for the same was \ncd `dirname /path/to/file.end` \n\n", "Q: QML button colors not working I have followed the steps in here, and the app runs, but I am running into a little problem.

You might of allow Ubuntu to use your whole disk and had Ubuntu overwrite your data.  Put your Ubuntu install disk and use TRY UBUNTU. Go to top left corner of screen, and click on the top button[DASH]. Type in disks and click on the disks button.  Hopefully you will have three or more partitions showing.  Two will be NTFS, these are your Windows partitions,  and one should be ext4, this is Ubuntu.  If you see this setup, you might only have to mount your windows partitions.  Do this by clicking on one of the NTFS partitions, and go to the small box on the bottom, left side, click on the first button.  If you only see one large partition, not do anything else on your computer, til you receive more help. You might be looking at data recovery, which I can not help with, hopefully someone here can help you with that. Only use the install disk or another computer till you get more help.  Good luck. Colin \n\nA: Looks like you installed Ubuntu on the same partition where the Windows was. It is means, that the partition with Windows was formatted, and another OS was installed there. Part of your data was overwritten with data of newly installed system.\nHere still could be a way to recover part of your data, but it depends on what kind of a data you're seeking for. You may try Dragon UnPACKer(I am not sure if it works on GNU/Linux despite the fact that this is Open Source, probably you need to launch it with WINE). It could recover some data like images(i.e. photo) and video, but I don't think that it can find something like Office documents.\nWhat you have to do: load Ubuntu with live disk, next install there WINE(enter the  sudo apt-get install wine in terminal), download and launch the Dragon UnPACKer, open this program with root rights(enter in terminal to the directory where the program is, and launch it with gksudo wine <paste_here_a_progam_name>). Next choose the plugin \"Hyper Ripper\"(or something like this, don't remember exactly, but you won't miss), you will see a menu that is asked for which format of files you wanna seek. (Un)check the ones in which you're interested, and open with this plugin your drive that most probably is the file /dev/sda.\nBeware that this is will take many hours; depending on a speed and size of your drive you could wait even whole day. As a a good side this program can find even some partially screwed files -- I have tried this with a dump of some screwed flash card in which a man asked me to recovery photos, and this found even partially overwritten ones.\n", "Q: How do I install my Lexmark X1270 printer on Ubuntu 12.04 I have been trying for days to install the above-mentioned printer under 12.04.

I got into a lot of trouble when changing the permission of a folder myfolder residing in /.\nI issued the command\nsudo chown -R luca:luca /myfolder/.*\n\nMy intention was to change ownership of all the hidden files in /myfolder.\nUnfortunately I realized that also the ownership of / was changed, which of course left me with a broken system. I think this happened because .. matches .*, but still seems weird to me.\nIs changing the parent directory the correct behaviour or should I file a bug report?\nIf it was my mistake in using chown, what are the best practices to use to prevent changing the ownership of system folders and files?\n\nA: Remember that the command line is expanded (interpreted) by the shell before being executed\nsudo chown -R luca:luca /myfolder/.*\n\nis interpreted first as : \nsudo chown -R luca:luca /myfolder/.  /myfolder/.. /myfolder/.adobe  /myfolder/.bash_history\n\nnote the /myfolder/.. in your command line\nchown -R luca:luca /myfolder/.. is equivalent to  chown -R luca:luca /\nthat makes the chown running \"backwards\"\nUse echo /myfolder/.* when you use \"*\" to verify .\n\nA: Well. Command line as root is very powerful. Read some of these classics. And yes, .* matching to .. is exactly what is intended. Dot is not a special character. It is a convention. By convention, files that start with a dot are hidden from the default view when listing a directory -- nothing less, and nothing more. By convention, the inode leading to the current directory gets the . name and the inode leading to the parent directory gets the .. name.\nWhat you should have done was\nchown -R luca:luca /myfolder\n\nDid I mention that there is nothing special about the file names that start with a dot? Recursive chown doesn't think so.\nRight now, you might be able to rescue some of the functionality by changing the ownership back to root. In the long run, you will probably have to reinstall the system, though.\nAs a general rule: \n\n\n*\n\n*Avoid working as root.\n\n*If you work as root, read each command twice before hitting Enter. \n\n*If you are unsure about expansion, try it first with a \"safe\" command (like echo .*).\n\n*Do not work as root.\n\n*There are many tasks that can be performed safely using a graphical interface (your problem is an example of such a task).\n\n*Did I mention that you should avoid using the root account?\n\n", "Q: How can I redownload previously purchased Linux Format magazine on Ubuntu Software Center?

If you do not like Unity you can install Gnome3 and some other Desktops via the Ubuntu Software Center. You can change between them in the login screen after installation.\nTo find things use the Dash. It's the Icon at the top in the Launcher (on the left side). You can also open it using the Super-Key.\nSteam\nI guess (most likely the problem) that you are not using the proprietary drivers, which are needed for most 3D games. You can easily install them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the following application (via the Unity Dash if you're using Unity): \"Software & Updates\"\n\n*In this application click the last tab (should be called \"additional drivers\")\n\n*There choose the proprietary driver for your graphics card.\n\n*Apply your choice.\n\n*restart your computer\n\n\nIt will automatically download and install the driver you selected.

SELinux policy controls whether users are able to modify the SELinux context for any given file. When using chcon, users provide all or part of the SELinux context to change. An incorrect file type is a common cause of SELinux denying access.\n\nchcon is intended for temporary changes.\nSee https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/12/html/Security-Enhanced_Linux/sect-Security-Enhanced_Linux-Working_with_SELinux-SELinux_Contexts_Labeling_Files.html. \nYou almost certainly will want to use restorecon\nsudo /sbin/restorecon -R -v /var/www/\n\nIf that fails, post the avc denials and provide more information on what you are wanting to do. Most likely there would be a Boolean that you would need to configure. \nSee https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Security-Enhanced_Linux/sect-Security-Enhanced_Linux-Troubleshooting-Fixing_Problems.html\n\nA: You are in this case:\nchcon -R --reference=RFILE FILE\n\nwhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*chcon - change file security context; you can check any security context of a file with ls -Z.\n\n*-R - operate on files and directories recursively.\n\n*--reference=RFILE - use  RFILE's  security  context rather than specifying a CONTEXT value.\nSo, the above command change recursively the security context of each file from /var/www/html/install to those from /var/www/html.\nType info coreutils 'chcon invocation' in terminal and  you will have access to the complete manual.\nThis manual can helps you to understand everything about Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux).\n", "Q: XRDP screen size is tiny I am using Windows7 remote desktop connection. The 'Display' settings for RDC are set to [1920x1080]. When remote desktoping into my Ubuntu Server 12.04, I get a 1920x1080 window. However, the actual view of the Ubuntu terminal is about 600x400.\nSince an image says 1k words, here you can see two of them: \nRemote Desktop Connection settings:\n \nTiny Resolution:\n\n\nA: You are accessing a terminal, which is 80x25 characters by default. This will not change. Different RDP software can resize fonts, but still will be 80x25 chars. It is not clear if you ar eusing VNC protocol to access the server, but most probably yes.\nI will recommend to use putty (http://www.putty.org/) for Windows instead via ssh protocol, which allows you to display whatever size, font, fontsize, etc, of your server text screen. You will need to have port 22 open for that purpose and sshfs installed (usually is installed by default, but we dont know anything about your server).\nif it is a server I would not recommend to install a windows manager on the server, it is pretty useless. If you want to manage a server in some clickable windows mode, it is good to install webmin (web-admin)\nto install sshfs (if it is not present) enter following in command line of your server.\nsudo apt-get install sshfs\n\nTo install webmin follow this (How to install webmin?) or this guide: (http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-webmin-on-ubuntu-12-04-precise-server.html)\n\nA: That's correct. That terminal is xterm It's like the Terminal in Ubuntu. The problem is your not running a window manager. \nThe \"Gray\" area is just the default for X.\nIn order to \"fix\" the problem you need to run a window manager. Start metacity or something. \nI can't really tell you how to start a window manager because I don't know what your using to start the server on the Linux side, but if you can type in the terminal type mutter and you should get a window manager. \nYou will likely want to set up a more complete environment, I suggest running mate or icewm depending on your needs but there are tons of choices. \nYou can run icewm, if it's installed, by running icewm-session from the terminal that popped up there, or if that is vncserver by having \n\n[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup\n  [ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources\n  xsetroot -solid black\n  vncconfig -iconic &\n  icewm-session &  \n\nin your ~/.vnc/xstartup file.

After that, every time I start the PC the Windows boot manager shows up and asks me which OS I want to boot into - Ubuntu or Windows 7. \nSince most of the time I'm using Windows, I'd like to know if there's a way to skip the boot menu when turning on the PC and boot straight to Windows by default but still be able to press a key and boot to Ubuntu if I want to on the next restart. \nHow can I do that?\n\nA: If you set the Windows boot manager Time to display operating systems (timeout) to zero, making sure that Windows is still the default boot option, then the Windows boot manager will not be shown and it will boot directly to Windows. See here for details I don't believe there is any key you can press that will make the Windows boot manager show, but F8 is supposed to give you alternative boot options. So try that first.\nOtherwise, you can set a one-time boot into Ubuntu at the next reboot by going to a command prompt (run CMD.EXE by right-clicking and select Run as Administrator) and then determining the GUID for the Ubuntu entry and setting it to boot once. e.g. (reference)\nbcdedit /bootsequence {GUID}\n\nOnce you've got the GUID you could create a batch job (.bat file) to do this from the Desktop to make it more convenient.\nTo identify the GUID, run bcdedit and look for the Ubuntu entry e.g.:\nReal-mode Boot Sector\n---------------------\nidentifier              {1476af63-e5bc-11de-b180-0024543ae029}\ndevice                  partition=C:\npath                    \\ubuntu\\winboot\\wubildr.mbr\ndescription             Ubuntu\n\nThe above shows the GUID as 1476af63-e5bc-11de-b180-0024543ae029 so you would run:\nbcdedit /bootsequence {1476af63-e5bc-11de-b180-0024543ae029}\n\nSo you could then create a .bat file with the above line in it, and right-click on it and Run as administrator to set it to boot to Ubuntu at the next start.\nThis isn't a convenient solution, but it should do the trick.\n", "Q: How can I permanently sync my videos in ubuntu 13.04? So some of my videos are out of sync and although I can temporarily fix it (I use VLC) it does not fix this issue permanently.\nIs there a way to fix this? Maybe software (from the software center) that will allow me to change the sync? (I have Dell Mini Inspiron 10v, so it may struggle with some software).\n\nA: You will need to remultiplex the video and audio streams in a video container file to increase or decrease delay. Tools like avconv (no GUI), mkvmerge (GUI called mmg), and avidemuxer (GUI) can achieve that.\n", "Q: Missing Window Switcher and Expo not working I just installed Ubuntu 13.04 (64 bit).

Is there any way to disable the launcher without disabling the 'expo' functionality.\n\nA: The absence of workspace switcher is not a bug, but a design decision. To reenable it, simply right click on your desktop and choose Change Desktop Background. Then hit the Behavior tab and enable the workspace switcher.\n\nAs for the keyboard shortcuts to open the Dash and Expo, these can be simply changed in the CompizConfig Settings Manager.\nFor the Dash, click on Ubuntu Unity Plugin, then change the shortcut at the top:\n\nFor Expo, click on Expo and change the Expo key shortcut:\n\nFinally, as rrosa pointed out, you need to make sure you have installed the extra Compiz plugins to use Commands in the CompizConfig Settings Manager.\n\nA: i did this and got the switchers back:\nsudo apt-get install compiz-plugins-extra compiz-plugins compiz-gnome\n\nsalú\n", "Q: Powerpoint compatibility in ubuntu and windows I have made power point presentation using ubuntu. \nNow, I want to open same file in windows XP or windows 7. How can I do it?\nDoes simply copying the file in windows and opening with Microsoft power point solves problem?\n\nA: You probably made the file in LibreOffice Impress which can potentially save in a format that Office Powerpoint does not like(e.x. odp,otp). Check the file extension, it should be something like .ppt or .pptx. Just save in the proper format and you should be fine. You can cahnge the format when using File -> Save As. Select ppt in the dropdown list. \n\nA: Your question is related to a Power Point Presentation, which makes me think that you already created a .ppt or .pps file.\nThe short answer is \"YES\", these files will run in Power Point for Windows (any version).\nIf you haven't yet created the .ppt or .pps file just proceed to save it in the proper format by using the File/Save As option from the Menu, after which you can choose which format you are going to use for the saved file, then you can simply copy/paste your file into any Windows based system (perhaps via USB or any other way) in order to enjoy your presentations.\nLibreOffice/OpenOffice Presentations will run in Windows based systems if you install/already have installed the proper piece of software on them.\nGood luck!\n\nA: The real answer is NO! \nYou can open a presentation made in MsOffice in Linux programs like LibreOffice, OpenOffice or other but the design of the presentation is lost. The same goes for making a presentation in Linux and exporting it to MsOffice. You can start over with the presentation.\n\nA: The question is from 2011. Since then, Linux office suites made a lot of progress, and now in 2017, I see an impressive match between LibreOffice and PowerPoint.\nWhere you can run into problems is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fonts - make sure you either use the fonts distributed with your target system by default, or embed the fonts in the .ppt file, or at least distribute them togeter.\n\n*Animations, which were not documented too well by Microsoft so the implementations may differ.\n\n*Embedded videos which may use some codec not present on the target system.\n\n*Advanced features like forms. Typically, the clones like LibreOffice will alert you if that's the case.\n\n\nA: A friend did  a couple of slides using libre office impress that had to run in a windows computer with MS Office. All of her animations where gone (in the windows computer), and not all the colors and fonts where the same as in her initial design in impress. You can open files but the compatibility is still far from perfect. So I suggest using a pdf or maybe a .pps like some users above commented.\nIf you have internet connection during the presentation, you could use google docs or prezi (I never tried prezi, but the feedback from users is good).\n\nA: No, its too bad. Whats Needed is a small viewer app like powerpoint has, so impress could run on Windows. I find impress easier to use, more intuitive (not completely tho) than powerpoint. Instead you must export impress to PDF then use one of the PDF apps to join these PDF images into one document. Dont forget to set the export to landscape. features like fonts and animation will be lost. so I always bring my linux laptop to the presentation. Consider Wine or Virtualbox and make Powerpoint slides to start.

I have another computer for gaming, movies and all other bell and whistle programs.  I want the netbook system as clean and streamlined as possible. So I returned my netbook to factory settings, which unfortunately came with a ton of windows based bloatware.  If I do a complete install of ubuntu as the sole OS, will it actually wipe out these unwanted programs (e.g. norton antivirus trial)?  If not, can I uninstall them after I install ubuntu, or do I need to wipe them out beforehand?\n\nA: Removing Windows will delete ALL Windows software. So that is a firm YES to your question.\nYou can wipe your whole disc (and all Windows related items) during the installation of Ubuntu so need to do anything special upfront or after installing. At some point it will ask what to do with the disc lay-out (ie. partitioning). If you choose \"wipe disc\" it will do this for you (you can do it also with the \"something else\" option but that would require for you to have some understanding on how to manually alter your partitions. Might be a bit overwhelming for a new user).\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu as the sole OS (taking the whole hard disc volume) will wipe out everything there is inside the disc. Ubuntu will install its own applications. As you mention, the machine you have is a netbook so my recommendation is to install Lubuntu as the OS, because it's lighter and will run better on your machine.\n", "Q: How can I downgrade AbiWord to version 2.8.6? The AbiWord version (2.9.2) that is installed (with Lubuntu in my case) has many bugs! Does anyone know if/when Ubuntu will switch this back to the stable version (2.8.6)?\n\nA: We've had abiword 2.9 for 3 releases now, but it seems that it may have been added by accident. Assuming that's the case, the most reasonable course of action would probably be to offer 2.8 for the next release, and offer a backport allowing users to install it.\nThis could be accomplished in one of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*offering a differently named package that provides 2.8 even when 2.9 is available (for example, the package could be called abiword-2.8 instead of abiword (if it's not built in a way that allows both to be installed at a time, its dependencies could reflect that, forcing at most one of abiword and abiword-2.8 to be installed).\n\n*downgrading the version provided by abiword (in a subsequent release) to 2.8, but naming it with a higher version number so that it actually gets installed on a system that already has abiword 2.9.\nThe version string for the latest (and only) abiword package in Raring is 2.9.2+svn20120603-8; saucy-updates currently has 3.0.0~svn20130523-1ubuntu2. Packages of later versions supersede (i.e., by default get preference for installation over) packages of earlier versions.\nBut if a package providing abiword 2.8 were given version string 3.0.0+actually2.8.6, the package manager would see it as a later version. (This could be provided in a PPA too, if someone wants to do the work--I've found AbiWord to be surprisingly difficult to compile, at least when I try to include all the features that one could reasonably expect to be present. An official package would probably not be called that because it doesn't fit with the naming conventions for packages--Ubuntu-specific versions like this have ubuntu in their names--but I believe this could be accomplished within the accepted naming conventions.)\nSpeaking of a PPA, vasa1 has pointed out that there is (at least) one. Lionel Le Folgoc's PPA provides abiword 2.8.2 (and it uses a version scheme like that described above: the version string is 2.9.2+svn20120213really2.8.6-0ubuntu0.1~ppa1). However, that PPA unfortunately only provides abiword 2.8.2 for Precise. (If you select a different version in the \"published in\" drop-down menu on that page, it will not appear.)\nWith all that said, a downgraded Ubuntu package for abiword will probably not be offered officially. This is because:\n\n\n*\n\n*The development version of abiword gets better and better (overall, and in terms of stability) with each release. Most or all of the bugs you've experienced are probably fixed in a later development release. This is why it's silly to include a frozen development version in a stable Ubuntu release--it will have lots of bugs that will then never be fixed unless the SRU proccess is undertaken. That process has not happened for abiword in the last few Ubuntu releases. But it also means that offering the next development version will fix most of the bugs.\n\n*I'm not sure when AbiWord 3 will have a stable upstream release (i.e., a stable release from the AbiWord project itself, which can then be packaged for official downstream inclusion in OSes like Debian, Ubuntu, and other GNU/Linux systems). But it seems likely a release--or at least a beta--is forthcoming. Hopefully it will be released in time to make it into Saucy. The change of version number from 2.9... to 3.0... hopefully means that a release is coming soon.\n\n*GTK+ 2.0 is still packaged for the latest versions of Ubuntu, but there is a push to port apps to GTK+ 3.0, since that may provide better integration with today's desktop environments, and because eventually GTK+ 2.0 might be deprecated for removal.\n\nI've tried to give a reasonable answer that incorporates relevant\n  facts (\"good subjective\"). This is CW so it's easier for\n  anyone to update/improve. With that said, if you want to start or\n  participate in a full-blown discussion of this topic, someplace\n  like Ubuntu Forums would be better.\n\n", "Q: Cannot install XBMC due to dependency issues I am unable to install XBMC even after following all the steps...\nThis is the error message\nReading package lists...

Hope this helps.\n\nA: First open Sound settings:\n\nThen in Output tab adjust the balance for left and right speakers:\n\nAlso you can click on Test Sound button to test the volume for each speaker.\n\nA: Open Pulseaudio volume control, then under the Playback tab (first tab from the left) check each channel volume level and check if the channels' volume levels are locked between them (they have to be locked in order to keep the same volume level for the two channels -left and right-).\nAs a side check, check the plug too. Sometimes a bad contact kills the sound of one of the channels.\n\nA: pavucontrol did the trick for me.  \nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04 on this hardware (Intel motherboard) https://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/7624/i-love-my-raspberry-pi3b-as-a-workstation-but-what-is-the-next-step-better/7625#7625 \n(A $38/free shipping to US) for-real computer.  \nI thought it was hardware until running pavucontrol.\nIt showed that one channel was turned all the way down.  As soon as I started moving one they moved together, and it now works great.\n\nA: I too faced this problem not just with one Linux OS but all of them.\nI was using creative sound blaster 0106.  I tried all that I could but failed. \nI recollected earlier I had Yamaha sound card and when I changed from windows XP to 7 but it did not work and so I procured Creative which worked fine with Windows 7 Ultimate after downloading and installing drivers for Windows 7, so I thought why not go back to Yamaha sound card and give a try in Linux.\nIt works fine without any additional effort.\nSo the problem is with Sound card and not Linux.\nIn addition I would like to add I was very impressed by Windows 7 but using genuine free edition of Linux Mint Sarah is a big pleasure and it upgraded to to Serena like a song I have tried many Linux distributions like Ubuntu PC Linux Peppermint and liked all of them and now settled with Linux Mint Serena.   Hats off to Linux creators\n", "Q: Use of an external Hard Drive for backups I have acquired an used external HD (a WD Passport) that I'm planning to use for the backup of important files - I was thinking of using it with Déjà Dup.\nShould I format it beforehand? Which partition type would make sense? Should I go for the \"Don't Partition\" option? All of this is supposed to be done trough the disk utility, right?\nSorry if the questions seems somewhat silly - I'm definitely not very savvy regarding these matters. \nThank you very much. Done as suggested, formatting the whole thing as ext4. A separate 700 Mb partition with stuff from the HD producer (instructions, an automated backup program for windows etc...) seems to have survived. Should I go after it or leave it be?\nThe disk is pretty big and I backup mostly texts, so I'm not really craving for more space.\nAnother question: would the ext4 interfere with the recovering of the data in the HD by using a non-unix system? How much of a hassle would that be?\nThanks again!\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, you can not use an unformated disc. Plus if it is second hand it might have a Windows filesystem. \n\n*ext3 or ext4. I would go for ext4 myself.\n\n*No, if you solely use it for backups do not split it up.\n\n*Yes, gparted is the name of the program.\n\n\nA: I've just done this.\nI backed up my home directory onto an external hard drive that also has windows files on it.\nUbuntu just sees it all as part of the file system when you connect via usb.\nSo I didn't reformat it or anything, just plugged it in, created a backup folder on the hard drive from ubuntu file manager, did the backup with luckyBackup and everything is fine.\n", "Q: Can't use Nvidia GeForce 310m in Ubuntu 13.04 Okay so before anybody marks this as a possible duplicate or something along those lines let me say what ive worked on; I have used Bumblebee,Manually installed the drivers myself,tried a bunch of old drivers and new ones in hopes of something happening,re-installed drivers and bumblebee and done a re-installation of the OS and nothing...\nIm dualbooting Ubuntu 13.04 next to Windows 7 (both are 64-bit) and the problem is that i cant seem to get my GPU running and i found that Ubuntu cant acces the gpu for some reason (this showed up while working with bumblebee in a terminal)...i have Intel HD Graphics (built in) and an Nvidia Geforce 310m (512mb) \nThese are my specs;\nCPU; Intel Core i5\nRam; 4Gb (3.7 to be exact)\nHDD; 500gb (divided equaly in half for both Operating Systems)\nGPU; Nvidia Geforce 310m 512mb (as mentioned)\nComputer/Laptop; Toshiba Satellite E205\n:) Help is apretiated\n\nA: i have the Samsung q330 and i have the same issue, i can resolved it with this.\nOpen synaptic and remove all nvidia drivers and nouveaun, like so:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia * nouvea* or sudo apt-get clean nvidia* nouvea*\nOpen terminal and install: \n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic nvidia-319\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee virtualgl linux-headers-generic\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils\nsudo reboot\n\nAnd you can test with this command: \noptirun glxgears -info\nIf all works out you can see something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*GL_RENDERER   = GeForce 310M/PCIe/SSE2  \n\n*GL_VERSION    = 3.3.0 NVIDIA 325.15\n\n*GL_VENDOR     = NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\nits run some 3D graphics and say you fps.\nYou can use too optimusrun glxspheres, and glxspeheres to test mxpixel/sec\nGood luck \n", "Q: Install Mobile Partner in Ubuntu 13.04 without download I have Huwawei E303 HSPA Dongal and it has already provided software for Linux.But I cant install it.\nThis is Dongal\nhttps://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fIdfg85yv1M/UdciqwwTdnI/AAAAAAAAAX0/Q7ObEgg4hkQ/s588-no/Screenshot+from+2013-07-06+01%253A06%253A08.png\nI have very few knowledge about Ubuntu.I tried in terminal as fallowing.\nroot@nandika-OEM:~# su\nroot@nandika-OEM:/home/nandika# \nroot@nandika-OEM:/home/nandika# /media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux/install\nbash: /media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux/install: Permission denied\n\nroot@nandika-OEM:/home/nandika# dash /media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux/install\n/media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux/install: 43: /media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux/install: LANGUAGESTRING[0]=zh: not found\n\n/media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux/install: 44: /media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux/install: LANGUAGESTRING[1]=en_US: not found\n\n/media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux/install: 45: /media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux/install: LANGUAGECODE[0]=0: not found\n\n/media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux/install: 46: /media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux/install: LANGUAGECODE[1]=1: not found\n\n/media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux/install: 49: /media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux/install: Bad substitution\n\nroot@nandika-OEM:/home/nandika# \nHelp to install.I cant get call,SMS without this.\nBut I Can connect internet.\n\nA: Connect your 3G dongal & run the following codes in the Terminal one after another:\n\ncp -r /media/nandika/Mobitel/Linux ~/\n  cd ~/Linux\n  chmod +x install\n  sudo ./install\n\n\nA: First go to the folder and right click on the mobilepartner.bin file, then check run as executable from Properties -> Permissions -> Allow executing file as program menu.\nNow, try the above command and if you are using 64bit system you may need to download 32bit libraries, by using apt-get install command.\n", "Q: How to remove this title bar off window from gnome-shell?

I have printer sharing enabled as well as discovery enabled on the Vista machine, and I'm able to find/print from other windows machines in my house with no issue.\nI can't do that with my Ubuntu machine though, and I have not seen any guides online on how to do so, it's usually a ubuntu 'printer server' in all the cases.\nI've tried finding the printers with the printer settings by both SAMBA and the IP address assigned by my router to the Vista machine.  \nSo I'm just going to ask for a direction in how to go about doing this.\n\nA: Is there a Windows (or other) Firewall on your Vista machine? Have you opened port 631 on that machine to the IP of the Linux machine? If not, try that. CUPS uses port 631 by default for communication so you should also verify that your Firewall on the Linux machine also allows for port 631 communication. If it does not from the machine listed, that too, could cause the non-discoverable printer issue. \nHope that helps put you on the right path. It is truly easy once discovered.\n", "Q: Canon (MG 5350) scangear doesn't appear in dash I recently downloaded the Ubuntu scangear driver from their website for my canon pixma MG5350 3 in one printer. I downloaded the debian package and installed it trough the terminal, however I can't seem to find the app himself. \nI searched for it trough dash and other scanning apps didn't work from the beginning (like Xsane and simple scan), since they don't seem to recognize my printer/scanner.\nThe terminal seemed to install the driver/program just fine; it didn't encounter any errors.

I tried to debug and iotop identifies jbd2 (Journaling block device) as the process responsible. This process is only called while I do regular activities and not when the computer is idle. It did not seem that the problem is that it is called too often, but that when it is called, it takes too much time to do its job. So I have tried to check my disk and was unpleasantly surprised by its extremely slow performance parameters.\nsudo hdparm -tT /dev/sdb6\n\n/dev/sdb6:\n  Timing cached reads:     2 MB in  2.43 seconds = 842.41 kB/sec\n  Timing buffered disk reads:  22 MB in  3.01 seconds =   7.30 MB/sec\n\nI did a fresh install of 13.04 (I had all my data backed up so it was not so radical) and that did not fix anything. I also checked the disk performance while booted from USB and the disk performance is the same (the system booted from USB is very responsive so I assume that this cannot be cpu or memory problem).

I added the following script to \n/etc/pm/sleep.d\n called 0001fixhibernate \n\ngksudo gedit /etc/pm/sleep.d/0001fixhibernate\n\nand added this text:\n#/bin/sh\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n\n    suspend|hibernate)\n        echo ON > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n        echo DIS > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n        ;;\n    resume|thaw)\n        echo IGD > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n        echo OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n        ;;\n    *)\n        ;;\nesac\n\nWhat the script does is activating the discrete graphics card just before suspend or hibernation and disables it again on resuming or thawing.\nWith this script I'm working around a freeze after resuming that's accompanied by the fan running at full speed. Please give any feedback if it works or not.\n", "Q: When is the ubuntu os for mobiles released? When are you going to release ubuntu phone version?

About 2 weeks ago on Friday, so exactly 2 weeks ago, I accidentally screwed up GRUB on Ubuntu 13.04(64-bit). I don't remember how, but I did. I tried fixing it on my own. Tried several boot repair disks, and couldn't figure it out. Then one day, I decided to try to install MBR on one of my repair disks. Sadly, that kept me from even reaching the boot screen. Now I can't remove that. The only way I can boot Linux Mint and Ubuntu now is through Super GRUB Repair or something. It's in the Rescatux thing..... Anyway, there is an option that allows you to look for Operating Systems on the computer. It finds both Ubuntu and Linux, but only Linux is bootable because grub is fine. But Ubuntu, grub is messed up and its the primary operating system. I had booting from a disk every time and I'd like to get it fixed. I have to go out of state Sunday, but I only have internet until Saturday.\nI'd also like to add that I'm willing to risk losing data if I must reinstall Ubuntu. I noticed in the installer that I can reinstall, but it insists that I backup before doing so, but I can't even access /home/User/ so..

Using an external hard drive I downloaded the 64 bit version of ubuntu 13.04, and used the recommended tool to put ubuntu on to the hard drive (http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/). I restarted my computer and everything seemed to work fine. I set up ubuntu and installed in on my main hard drive. I ran into the issue when I had to restart my computer to finish the installation. I restarted it, and when it was starting up there were two different options for ubuntu, the only difference being that one began with an upper case U. Apparently I picked the wrong option because it booted into windows 8. I tried restarting again but it wanted me to go through the whole installation process again. I decided it shouldn't be too difficult, so I did. This time it ran into an error about failing to install something relating to grub (which was a fatal error). After that I tried to reinstall it once more (again having an error with grub) before I erased the data on my external hard drive and deleted the partition that I had already created for ubuntu. I formatted the hard drive and tried to start completely over without any installation of ubuntu on my computer. At that point my computer stopped recognizing ubuntu on my hard drive all together.

I used Startup Disk Creator to try and make a bootable USB ubuntu stick to install on my new ultrabook.\nI had my 2TB backup USB drive attached, as I had just backed up everything on the flash drive.\nI ran the Startup Disk Creator (as detailed here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu ).  I selected the appropriate ISO (which was surprisingly also pre-selected), and I checked the \"Device to Use\" and confirmed that it was the correct drive (by name).  I clicked \"Erase\" to clean the drive.\nA few minutes went by, and I saw activity on my USB drive.  I thought perhaps it was formatting instead of erasing.  Then I noticed that my backup drive activity was churning...not a good sign.\nWorst possible thing was true, the startup disc creator was erasing my 2TB backup drive.\nI have been googling to see what to do, and what exactly \"erase\" does in Startup Disk Creator.  I am currently running testdisk and doing a deep scan, as the quick scan did not show a partition with files.\nWhat did I do wrong with the Startup Disk Creator?  How could it erase a disc that wasn't selected in the \"Devices\" dropdown?  What exactly did it DO when it erased, and is my data completely hosed or can I expect this long deep scan to bear fruit?\n\nA: How could it erase a disc that wasn't selected in the \"Devices\" dropdown? \nIt is a bug in  'startupdisk creator'. The list box in startup disk creator shows only the first usb device in the destination. But it selects the last device. So when you saw the destination you would have noticed your flash drive, but actually the 2TB hardisk was selected. This will be visible only when you scroll down or maximize the window. \nWhat exactly did it do when it erased?\nThe program may have tried to erase or format the drive, but it couldn't do it due to some reasons and  it managed to corrupt the data by deleting whatever was possible like partition-table and has left the data to an unrecoverable state. Or maybe it might have even formatted the disk and deleted the data and left something to show up in the drive properties. \nIs my data completely hosed?\nYour data is gone forever and there is nothing you can do to retrieve them with the same folder structure. But you can use the recovery software like potorec, scapel, foremost, recurva etc. to get pieces of your data. Some recovery software might also retrieve you the 100% of data. But still that wouldn't be what you expected. \ncan I expect this long deep scan to bear fruit?\nIf you are referring to the deep scan in testdisk, then the answer is no.\nBut there is one important thing that you should do first. Get an empty hardrive of 2TB or more and make a clone of the affected one using dd command. This does not recover you data, it helps to have a backup of the affected disk. Do every experiments that you want to do using the different recovery methods only on the cloned drive. \n", "Q: boot manager is missing, ubuntu 12.04 I did a clean installation of ubuntu 12.04 from a usb stick.

I've been trying to look for ways to overclock my rather old cpu, AMD Turion 64 x2 Tl-56 1.8ghz dual core. My Acer Aspire 5100 series bios does not give me the option to overclock. After referring to this question and this thread I found using google, I came to the conclusion the only utility that supports AMD's k8 processor family was cpupowerd. I downloaded the code here, compiled it with\nmake && sudo make install\n\nloaded the msr kernel module with \nsudo modprobe msr\n\nand ran it with\nsudo ./cpupowerd --freq \"0|1900\"\n\nwhich returned the following message:\ncpupowerd 0.2.1 written by Markus Strobl.\nWARNING: This program could cause damage to your Hardware!\nFrequency 1900 MHz not available!\n\nI then did\nsudo ./cpupowerd -s\n\nwhich returned\ncpupowerd 0.2.1 written by Markus Strobl.\nWARNING: This program could cause damage to your Hardware!\nVendor                      : AMD\nFamily                      : K8\nModel                       : 4\n  Mastercpuid               : 0\n    Affected cpuids         : 0 1\n    Current voltage (VID)   : 1.1000 V (18)\n    Current frequency (FID) : 1800 MHz (10)\n    Supported frequencies   : 800 1600 1800 MHz\n\nIt doesn't want to set the frequency to something other that what's on the supported frequencies list.

Mid-2010). The MacBook Pro is running OSX 10.8.3 and I'm trying to make it dual-bootable (i.e., so I can boot into Ubuntu or OSX). When booting from the live CD and selecting \"Try Ubuntu,\" I made the allegedly necessary partition tables and was ready to install. Through the installation process, I selected my newly created \"ext4\" partition, changed it (in the installer) to \"Use as ext4 journaling file system,\" and pressed continue. However, the following window popped up:\n\nBelow is a snapshot of my partition table in GParted.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of the installation window.\n\n\nThe Hypothesis\n@Seth and I are geared towards thinkhing this is an issue with Ubuntu not detecting that my computer is using EFI instead of BIOS. I think that if we somehow get Ubuntu to recognize that I'm running a computer that uses EFI, the installation will run smoother. However, because I'm running on a MacBook Pro, users who've had similar problems with Windows won't have the same solutions for me (or other future problem-havers) to use.\n\nThings Tried & Investigated\nBelow are things that I've tried and looked into. I'll be updating it as this issue progresses.\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried researching this issue, and came across this thread as well. After discussing this issue with people in the chat room, though, I'm -- we're -- pretty sure it's a hardware issue.\n\n*Additionally, I tried this wiki, but the wiki looks geared towards Windows and, again, I'm pretty sure this is a hardware-specific issue. Update: I went ahead and tried the section I linked to, and it didn't entirely workout. When following the instructions, I wasn't able to click onto the \"GRUB location\" tab because it was disabled: \n\n*Another untried option @Seth and I went over was bypassing the error, then running the boot-repair program listed above. There are concerns about this being dangerous, though, so I'd be glad to hear another opinion.\n\n*I've tried the solution provided by @rod-smith. However, as apparent in the comments on his answer, I ran into some issues. When trying the alternate steps under step 10, booting up just got me a blank screen that wouldn't go away (the most recent amount of time that I've spent on that screen was about 40 minutes until I rebooted). Continuing to follow the instructions, before step 18 shows up (which it never does), I get the following error:\n\nWARNING: no console will be available to OS\n  error: no suitable video mode found.\n(see image)\n\n\n*While keeping the partitions/all settings as setup by my explanation in the fourth item (above), I tried the link in the second item above because GRUB was installed. I could access the menu and I ran through everything needed to be done. However, upon reboot, I ran into the same indefinite blank screen.\n\n*In accordance with @TheMysteriousMan's post, I've also tried selecting /dev/sda1 to install the boot loader on, but I received the same error.\n\n*The Ubuntu 13.04 (64-bit, Mac alternate) has been tried also, but again, the same error is received.\n\n*Something I've noticed is that when double clicking on a partition (while in the installation process seen in the 3rd photo of this post) and bringing up the \"Edit partition\" window, under the \"Use as:\" drop down (where options like \"Ext4 journaling file system\" appear), I have the option \"Reserved BIOS boot area.\" I'm wondering if the error is asking me to do something with the option. If it is asking me to use this option, should I create a new partition and set this option on it? How big should the partition be? Or do I put it on an existing partition?\n\nTLDR & The Question\nThe main question here is: how do I get by this error message? Is there some configuration I have to do that I haven't already? Or is this a safe error message to bypass?\n\nA: The last time I checked (two or three releases ago), the \"Mac alternate\" version of Ubuntu was basically just the normal Ubuntu but stripped of its EFI boot options. This may seem peculiar, since Macs use EFI, but the problem is that the Mac's EFI is weird, and the standard Ubuntu installer had problems with the Mac's EFI. (I don't recall the precise nature of the problems, though.) Since Macs provide a BIOS compatibility layer, booting in that way makes sense; and when GRUB installs to a GPT disk using a BIOS boot mode, use of a BIOS Boot Partition (what the Ubuntu dialog box refers to as a \"reserved BIOS boot area\") is necessary. Hence, the dialog box asking for that area.\nOne option for how to proceed is to acquiesce with the request to create a BIOS Boot Partition. Ubuntu will then boot in BIOS mode, if all goes well. You can subsequently change the Linux boot mode by installing an EFI-mode boot loader. See my EFI-Booting Ubuntu on a Mac for one example of how to do this, and particularly the section entitled \"Fixing the Installation.\"\nAnother option is to try using the standard Ubuntu installer rather than the Mac variant. You may need some help getting it to boot; it's possible that rEFInd will help with that, although I can make no promises. Once the installer is booted, you should ensure that it's running in EFI mode by looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode, and if it's not present, you've probably booted in BIOS mode and should try again.\n\nA: Have you tried to choose /dev/sda1 as the place to install your bootloader? On the bottom of the custom installation menu, there is a place marked: \nDevice for bootloader installation\n\nChoose /dev/sda1 from the dropdown menu.\n\nA: Read the whole answer before following the instructions below.\nIn order to fix this issue you need to create an extra partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install rEFIt or rEFInd1 in Ubuntu.\n\n*Start Mac OS X.\n\n*Launch OS the Disk Utility application.\n\n*Make sure to have already resized your \"Macintosh HD\" partition so that you have room for the new partitions (~50 GiB is what I chose).\n\n*Restart using a Ubuntu Live CD.\n\n*Select \"Try Ubuntu\".\n\n*Start the application named GParted.\n\n*Create a new partition called \"bootloader\" with file system ReiserFS. I made this partition 500 MiB. I'm not exactly sure if the file system or size matters. According to Wikipedia BIOS Boot partition page, this partition can be as small as only 1 MiB.\n\n*Create a new linux-swap partition that's about 1 GiB. I called this one \"swap\".\n\n*Create an ext4 partition called \"primary\" using the rest of your unallocated space.\n\n\nAfter following the instructions above, GParted should look similar to the following image. Keep in mind that I took this after installation. The labels for my linux-swap and ext4 partitions disappeared and the key/exclamation icons were added after installation by Ubuntu. Also, no need to set a bios_grub flag for the ResiserFS partition, this was also automatically added post- (or during-) installation.\n\nNow that the partitions are set up, go back to the desktop, click on \"Install Ubuntu 12.04\" (this should also appear in the menubar on the left if it's not on the desktop), and follow along below\n\n\n*\n\n*Go through the options (personalizing them however you like) until you get to the \"Installation type\" screen that asks you how you want to install Ubuntu.\n\n*On the \"Installation type\" screen, select \"Something else\" and continue (press \"Install Now\").\n\n*You'll now arrive at a window that lists all the partitions you have. Identify the \"bootloader\" partition (if the labels don't show, identify it by the device, type, or size columns) and double click on it.\n\n*A window that says \"Edit partition\" should popup. Select the option field next to \"Use as:\" and click on the value that says \"Reserved BIOS boot area\" (figure below). Press \"OK.\"\n\n\n*Identify the ext4 partition you just created and bring up the \"Edit partition\" window.\n\n*Set the \"Use as:\" value to \"Ext4 journaling file system,\" check the format option. Make sure to also set the mount field to /. Press \"OK.\"\n\n*Go ahead and continue the process, personalizing the results as you desire.\n\n\nFrom here, everything should work fine. Make sure to have rEFIt or rEFInd installed so that you can boot into Ubuntu later1.\n\n1. It turns out that if you get stuck while booting, instead of using a program like rEFIt and it's predecessor, you can just hold the alt/option key to boot into a partition/disk/whatever.\n\n", "Q: Software Center shows none of my purchases On both my Chrubuntu Acer C7 laptop, and on my desktop box, this week, the Software Center shows a blank screen when I select \"Reinstall previous purchases.\" In other words, it says that I have no purchases at all.\nI \"purchased\" a couple of free programs in the For Purchase menu, so I could verify that my username & password were valid.

Thanks :D\n\nA: You can log in directly as root instead of a user. If you're logging into a graphical desktop, this is very bad security practice, since you'll end up running a huge amount of software as root that doesn't typically need to be run as root, and isn't designed to be; a massive attack surface. Logging into an ssh session or text console as root is much less of an issue, but still potentially bad for security auditing reasons.\nIn Ubuntu, the root user by default has no password, so you can't log in as root[1]. To change this, you can run \"passwd root\" as root (e.g. using sudo). Make sure you pick an extremely complex password; enabling password-based login as root reduces your system's security, and using a weak password will reduce it significantly more.\nSince you really don't want to reduce the security of your system this way, use sudo as described in the other answer, or my favorite sudo bash.\n[1] except over ssh using an SSH key for example...\n\nA: i've looked, as i wanted to do this so i could move files from /host to the desktop, and from what i've seen, there is no way, because of the security of it.\n", "Q: Not Shutting Down Using Raring Ringtail on Acer V5 (UEFI Bios mode).

You can do this on a test basis in GRUB by hitting \"e\" to edit the kernel options, or by hitting F2 or Insert twice in rEFInd. If this works and you want to use this setting permanently, you'll need to adjust your boot loader configuration. Something called \"GRUB Customizer\" should do the job if you're using GRUB, but I've never used this myself, so I can't provide more details of how to use it.

I would like to make some good decisions now, so any help would be appreciated. \n\nA: No, Wubi is designed to try out Ubuntu without partitioning and runs a 'virtual disk'. If you have a 40 GB SSD, then you should install direct, not with Wubi.\n\nA: You can just boot from the installation USB/DVD and install Ubuntu straight on to you SSD. \nThe format of the partition that / is on is ext4.

Please Help. \n\nA: Creating a table is done at the kernel level; normally there is no need to create a new one unless one is adding to the kernel's TCP/IP capabilities.\nWhat you likely want to do is create a new chain in one of the existing tables, which is done with the -N flag.\n\nA: I think you are looking for creating a chain, not a table.\n   -N, --new-chain chain\n          Create a new user-defined chain by the given name.

I developed a software product which integrates the Ubuntu system. I want to sell this software someday. Is it legal to integrate the Ubuntu system in this software product?\nDo I need to pay? Or write an application to Ubuntu?\n\"integrate\" means that I distribute my software product by a CD. And I need to integrate the Ubuntu in the CD too. And my software is run on Ubuntu system. It is an App on Ubuntu. I will not modify Ubuntu. I think I do not need to make my software open source. \n\nA: Refer to the Ubuntu licensing information. If you are still unsure it would be best to email Canonical to confirm. It seems to depend on individual packages involved and their licences, so you may need to read each piece of software's license you use to check that they do not rule out commercial uses.\n\nA: Software within Ubuntu is widely GPL compatible and various essential base components are certainly GPL2 or GPL3. Those are the licenses you're going to have to abide by.\nThe core understanding is that if you include this software, you need to make the source code available. I'm not sure if that stretches to your software (if it just sits on top) but if you've customised any of the Ubuntu system by modifying existing files, you must provide source for that.\nI would strongly suggest talking to a professional about this. The FSF might be able to help but either way, I would start just by reading through what the GPL is and how it effects you:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.gnu.org/licenses/\n\n*http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html\nPeople take these licenses seriously. Don't ignore them.\nJust to express this again: GPL is not the only license in use (there are a myriad of various open source licenses in use in the default install of Ubuntu) but adhering to GPL should (talk to a lawyer about how you do that and to indemnify yourself that if this is true) mean you're also complying with their licenses. Aka, GPL is the fussiest license.\nIf you install other things (including things from the repo, or software that Ubuntu offers to install like drivers), these may have different licenses and you'll need to audit that. See the comments for some questions on dealing with that aspect. The rest of my answer assumes a clean Ubuntu install.\n", "Q: How can I create a bookmark to the listing of a computer's network shares? I have a server on my network which shares a lot of folder where I keep almost all my data. In my Windows enviroment I have a shortcut that goes to \"\\SERVER\" which lists all those folders.\nI am looking for the same in Ubuntu. There seems to be a limitation that you can only create shortcuts (or bookmarks) to individual folders, like \"\\SERVER\\Pictures\" for example and not to the folder listing.\nIf I go into a folder, that folder will appear under the Network headline to the left so I can then right click it and choose \"Add Bookmark\".\nThe server won't appear there if I just list its shares, therefore I can't save a bookmark.\nIs it possible to achieve what I want?\n\nA: You can click on Browse Network and the double click on the server as it should be listed. Then simply click bookmarks and add from the menu bar\nIf you cannot access the menu bar press: Ctrl + D to create a bookmaker.\n\n", "Q: Why is there a skip option when installing Ubuntu? When Installing Ubuntu (12.* or 13.04) on a machine, there's a final advertisement-like screen where it shows what software will be installed (With panels like \"Have fun with your photos\" with some details about Shotwell, etc)\nAt the bottom, there's a progressbar that can be expanded to show a log. There's also a \"skip\" button. It seems to be enabled even during some seemingly crucial steps.\nI've installed Ubuntu many times now, however I've never clicked this button for fear of screwing up the installation1.\nWhat is this button for? What does it skip?\n1. I usually make dual boots, so there's a chance that playing with this may damage the bootloader and then I'll have to grub rescue, which I'd rather not do. Otherwise I'd experiment away.\n\nA: This button skips attempts to download updates from Internet. If, during installation, Ubuntu detects any network, it attempts to get updates from it. \n", "Q: How to completely deactivate a Bluetooth USB device?

I think there's something wrong with pulse audio and the sound card (maybe problems with an updated driver) or maybe something with the pavucontrol application.  Either way, I had to tell PulseAudio to stop looking for my sound card and just play everything through Alsa.\nI ran aplay -l | grep card to find the specific sound card I wanted, then I edited /etc/pulse/default.pa and added a line load-module module-alsa-sink device=hw:0,0 where the 'hw:0,0' corresponds to the card found in the aplay -l command.

According to Novell knowledge base, the kcore file is all the addressable memory of the kernel. The size correspond to the arcitecture limits and you have a 64 bit linux-system with a 128TiB kcore.\nAs with most files under /proc/, it's a virtual file and it's not wise to do anything with it. \n", "Q: How do I install and reference QtLocation 5.0?

You should have enlarged the partitions before re-syncing each drive, then the grow should have worked. Can you tell us which metadata format you are using?

Growing in your situation would be easier if it was 1.2.\nmdadm --detail /dev/md1\n/dev/md1:\n        Version : 1.2\n\nIf it's 1.2, all you have to do is make the partitions (sdb2 sda2) larger. Make sure only the end of the partition moves, the start must remain the same, or your RAID will be broken. If you are unsure, do it for one disk only, so the other can still save your behind in case something goes wrong. You can do this with fdisk, but a better alternative is parted or even gparted if you prefer a GUI.\nFor parted, the following command should work (dangerous, writes partition table without asking):\nparted /dev/sdb unit s rm 2 mkpart primary 609374208 100%\n\nCheck fdisk output again if it looks correct; reboot to see if everything still works (/proc/mdstat should show the RAID being in sync UU); do the same for /dev/sda and then after another reboot, try to grow again.\nIf it's still 0.90 metadata, I'd take this opportunity to build a new RAID 1 with 1.2 metadata. In a live CD, fail one drive, create a new RAID on it with one drive missing, dd or rsync -aAHSX the data over, add the other drive, etc.\nFor growing, I think you'd still have to fail a drive, enlarge the partition, then re-add it. 0.90 stores the metadata at the end of the device and it will not be found if you move the end by enlarging the partition.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 - can not start Kile I have installed Kile via Ubuntu Software center.\nI wanted to start it.

This probably reflects a bug in the program.\n\nA: Perhaps you need to update it, heres the update link for Raring: http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/core/raring/universe/base/kile\n", "Q: Ubuntu software center remove configuration files Synaptic has options to remove the configuration files during uninstall, and I thought this was because the back-end apt-get has this as a parameter. How do I access this feature from the Ubuntu Software Centre, which replaces Synaptic as the default package manager software for Ubuntu? \nI have a program which seems to have saved a configuration file wrong (LieroLibre) and now it just wont run at all. I tried reinstalling it to no avail. \n[Edit] Ok, installed Synaptic and found its complete removal option doesn't actually remove ~/.FOLDERS that the program creates. Deleted ./lierolibre and it ran fine after that. Shouldn't those types of folders be considered configuration stuff?\n\nA: There is no conflict involved in installing both Synaptic and the Ubuntu Software Center. If you need to use a feature of Synaptic, it is possible to do so without it interfering in any way with the Ubuntu Software Center.\n", "Q: Stuck on \"waiting for apt-get to exit\" in Software Centre I'm trying to download something, and it's stuck on \"waiting for apt-get to exit\". Also, when I'm trying to use the terminal it says \"unable to lock the administration directory\" after I type in a command. \n\nA: apt-get is a tool for handling dpkg packages and handles one package at a time. There's may be a case that your previous action is still engaging the apt-get engine. Just like @karel suggested, 'close first and then only try another'\n\nNote: If its not solving the problem and neither rebooting, maybe some old apt-get thread was halted while executing, leaving apt locked.  \nYou'll need to delete the lock file with sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock and also the lock file in cache directory with sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock\n\nA: Maybe you had two conflicting package download commands trying to run at the same time, so neither command would run. If so, try closing all your open windows, and then open only the Ubuntu Software Center and try again to install your package.\n", "Q: Can't SSHing to Ubuntu via hostname and port other than 22 I'm trying to connect to Ubuntu via SSH from OS X, and I took the same step as explained in this page (https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/openssh-server.html). After setting it, I tried to connect by the form of username@ip_address, then it was successful and I was able to be in Ubuntu from OS X Terminal (this time I used port 22). However, when I tried to SSH to Ubuntu by the form of username@hostname, then I couldn't and the error ssh: Could not resolve hostname my_user_name: nodename nor servname provided, or not known occurred. I also tried to connect via port 2222 by changing /etc/ssh/sshd_config, then it failed too by spitting out the error debug1: connect to address my_ip_address port 22: Connection refused (this time I tried to connect by IP address).\nSo I think the latter issue stems from the fact that I have to make some sort of modifications also on OS X, but don't know where/how to do and don't know it's true in the first place.\nThe former issue is more annoying, as I'm not sure whether I could understand it correctly. I used hostname as the value that I got from running hostname on Ubuntu Terminal...but is it right? And when I searched for the issue on the Web, I knew that it's from DNS issue...but don't know what it is and how to fix it...\nThanks.\n\nA: In Terminal on OS X when using ssh to establish a remote connection using a hostname on a local network, add the suffix .local such that the command reads ssh username@hostname.local  If you need to override the default port 22, as your example of using port 2222, add -p 2222 to the command. You can also set this up in Terminal's \"New Remote Connection..\" dialog (Command-Shift-K) for easy access.\n\nA: When you ran ssh username@hostname, the computer that you are connecting from (your Mac OS) does not know the IP of this hostname, that' why it's telling you that ssh: Could not resolve hostname. So, what you need to do is tell your Mac that this hostname is this ip_address. To do this on your Mac, this page tells you how to do it. Basically, what you need to do is sudo nano /private/etc/hosts (sudo nano /etc/hosts on Mac OS X 10.7 and higher), and add a line at the end of the file like this:\nip_address       hostname\n\nWith the actual IP and hostname of your Ubuntu machine. Once done, Control+O, then Enter, then Control+X to save and close the file. Then do dscacheutil -flushcache for the changes to take effect. Now, when you do ssh username@hostname, it should work.\nAnd about that port 2222:\nYou're right, you have to do some modification on Mac OS...well, it's just a couple more characters. When you do ssh username@hostname, what is actually happening in the background is ssh username@hostname -p22, because port 22 is the default SSH port. But, if you know that the machine you are trying to connect to is using a different port, you'll have to manually specify it. So, since you've changed the port on Ubuntu to 2222, you'll have to do ssh username@hostname -p2222. This has nothing to do with using the hostname or ip_address.\n", "Q: Dual boot encrypted Ubuntu 13.04/12.04(option on installation CD) and Win7 Really sorry if someone had already asked this question, but I searched on this topic for a long time and only came up with the ones that used truecrypt. So, is it possible to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*With win7 installation disk, install win7 on a 20gb partition I've made for it.\n\n*With Ubuntu LiveCD, somehow chose the option to install the encrypted version of the installation (which is on the menu).\n\n\nThe order may be reversed, but will be best if you install win7 first, to save the bootloader problems.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible.\nFor info, the following order is the easy way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows\n\n*via Windows tools, reduce the Windows partition\n\n*install Ubuntu with the encryption option\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu will not allow me to add a repository, why can't it access PPA?

Every time the Os runs slow or freezes and crash. According to Ubuntu website. Something to do with (UEFI) and 64Bit downloading. They recommend iso dvd image. Also if you are getting the guy and keyboard symbol , when loading your os from disc. In the begining. You are running in legacy firmware and it may not be 64 bit programing.

Hope it helps. I am an Average to advanced user. American Meggatrends bios are UEFI and some older models , predated 2011, Can change or do both , Legacy and UEFI firmware.

I have a broken monitor on my Samsung 7 chronos (NP700Z5C-S02UB), I can get it to show certain things in my external monitor, but only once Ubuntu starts to load. I really need to return the laptop to bestbuy so that they can repair it, but to do that I first need to return it to the windows 8 installation it came with. But I can't do that without first accessing the bios, and I can't access the bios because I never see the samsung startup screen from which I can press F2.\nMy laptop is one of those affected by the whole Samsung-bricks-in-linux thing, but I have only been booting it in bios mode.\nI only just had it returned from BestBuy's Geek Squad (my god, I believe they are trained to treat customers poorly!), because the laptop initially came with the webcam not connected. It came back yesterday with details of an additional repair they'd found necessary - \"Replaced the defective LCD panel\". I'd never had problems with the LCD panel before I sent it away.\nThe monitor worked yesterday. This is a list of everything I have done since I had the laptop returned to me. I created a back up disk image of windows 8, I turned off UEFI and Fast Boot, I stuck in the Ubuntu 13.04 DVD, installed the system, and refreshed my files from my backup. I watched a TV episode through an external monitor. I unplugged the external monitor and messed around online for a while. Then I closed the laptop. When I reopened it 5 minutes later the screen was completely black, no pushings of buttons had any effect.\nI held down the power cable for 4 seconds to shut down, and turned on again. I get the noise of the dvd drive starting up. I hear the harddrive powering up. The keyboard backlight comes on, along with the hard disk light and the power light. Nothing more.\nI plug in the AC adapter... ...same result.\nI plug in an external monitor...  ...success! The external monitor shows my desktop, and everything appears to work.\nSo, the screen is kaput! Though, the computer seems fine. But I can't change the bios settings because I never see the initial startup screen. Is there a way to get at the bios settings through an external? Or does anyone know the exact keys I'd have to press to change the settings back on this computer without observing the screen? (Pressing F2 immediately after booting up appears to work, I press F10 to \"save changes and exit\" then press return, and the computer boots.) \nI need to return the laptop, it's been nothing but trouble to me, I'd hope they'd give me a refund but I expect they'll insist on taking 2 weeks to fix it), but whatever I do I first need to return it to Windows 8.\nEDIT Following a suggestion from my house mate, it's not because the laptop thinks that the lid is open. cat /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID0/state returns state: open.\n\nA: During boot, F2 will get you into the BIOS config.\nOnce you're the there, F9 will load the default configuration, you have to press ENTER for the yes/no confirmation dialog. The F10 will save and exit the changes. Again, you'll have to press ENTER for a yes/no confirmation dialog.\nThat should boot windows.\n", "Q: Qualcomm Atheros AR8172/8176/8178 network UNCLAIMED I installed Ubuntu OS.

Anything will help, as I am at a dead end.\nThanks!\nlsmod (Kubuntu 32 Bit):\nModule                  Size  Used by\npci_stub               12550  1 \nvboxpci                22896  0 \nvboxnetadp             25636  0 \nvboxnetflt             27261  0 \nvboxdrv               285137  3 vboxnetadp,vboxnetflt,vboxpci\nparport_pc             27504  0 \nppdev                  12817  0 \nrfcomm                 37420  0 \nbnep                   17669  2 \nbluetooth             202069  10 bnep,rfcomm\nbinfmt_misc            17260  1 \ndm_crypt               22321  0 \nkvm_intel             126842  0 \nkvm                   376505  1 kvm_intel\nsnd_ctxfi              87112  0 \ndcdbas                 14021  0 \nsnd_pcm                80890  1 snd_ctxfi\nmicrocode              18286  0 \njoydev                 17097  0 \nsnd_page_alloc         14230  2 snd_ctxfi,snd_pcm\nsnd_seq_midi           13132  0 \nsnd_seq_midi_event     14475  1 snd_seq_midi\nsnd_rawmidi            25114  1 snd_seq_midi\nnvidia              10287297  32 \npsmouse                81038  0 \nsnd_seq                51280  2 snd_seq_midi_event,snd_seq_midi\nsnd_seq_device         14137  3 snd_seq,snd_rawmidi,snd_seq_midi\nsnd_timer              24411  2 snd_pcm,snd_seq\nsnd                    56485  6 snd_ctxfi,snd_timer,snd_pcm,snd_seq,snd_rawmidi,snd_seq_device\nserio_raw              13031  0 \nmac_hid                13037  0 \nsoundcore              12600  1 snd\ni2c_nforce2            12876  0 \nlp                     13299  0 \nparport                40753  3 lp,ppdev,parport_pc\npata_acpi              12886  0 \nhid_generic            12484  0 \nusbhid                 41805  0 \nhid                    82666  2 hid_generic,usbhid\nfirewire_ohci          35292  0 \nfirewire_core          61718  1 firewire_ohci\ncrc_itu_t              12627  1 firewire_core\npata_amd               13761  0 \nforcedeth              61777  0 \nsata_nv                23004  3 \n\nlsmod (Kubuntu 64 bit):\nModule                  Size  Used by\nparport_pc             28152  0 \nppdev                  17073  0 \npci_stub               12622  1 \nvboxpci                23194  0 \nvboxnetadp             25670  0 \nvboxnetflt             23479  0 \nvboxdrv               320372  3 vboxnetadp,vboxnetflt,vboxpci\nbnep                   18036  2 \nrfcomm                 42641  0 \nbluetooth             228619  10 bnep,rfcomm\nkvm_intel             132891  0 \nkvm                   443165  1 kvm_intel\njoydev                 17377  0 \ndcdbas                 14397  0 \nsnd_ctxfi             107768  2 \nsnd_pcm                97451  1 snd_ctxfi\nmicrocode              22881  0 \nsnd_page_alloc         18710  2 snd_ctxfi,snd_pcm\nsnd_seq_midi           13324  0 \nsnd_seq_midi_event     14899  1 snd_seq_midi\nsnd_rawmidi            30180  1 snd_seq_midi\nsnd_seq                61554  2 snd_seq_midi_event,snd_seq_midi\nnvidia              11309139  40 \nsnd_seq_device         14497  3 snd_seq,snd_rawmidi,snd_seq_midi\nsnd_timer              29425  2 snd_pcm,snd_seq\nsnd                    68876  10 snd_ctxfi,snd_timer,snd_pcm,snd_seq,snd_rawmidi,snd_seq_device\nsoundcore              12680  1 snd\npsmouse                95870  0 \nserio_raw              13215  0 \nmac_hid                13205  0 \ni2c_nforce2            13020  0 \nlp                     17759  0 \nparport                46345  3 lp,ppdev,parport_pc\nvesafb                 13828  1 \npata_acpi              13038  0 \nhid_generic            12540  0 \nusbhid                 47074  0 \nhid                   101002  2 hid_generic,usbhid\nforcedeth              66977  0 \nfirewire_ohci          40103  0 \nfirewire_core          64508  1 firewire_ohci\ncrc_itu_t              12707  1 firewire_core\npata_amd               14129  0 \nsata_nv                31812  5\n\ncat /proc/asound/cards (64 bit):\n$ cat /proc/asound/cards\n 0 [XFi            ]: SB-XFi - Creative X-Fi\n                      Creative X-Fi 20K1 Unknown\n\ncat /proc/asound/card0/codec#0 (64 bit):\n$ cat /proc/asound/card0/codec#0\ncat: /proc/asound/card0/codec#0: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: Most likely it is new driver sheduling.

I am trying to understand the do-release-upgrade process i.e. the way that Ubuntu prompts me to upgrade to the next spring or autumn Ubuntu release.\nAfter reading the sources for ubuntu-release-upgrader I found the /etc/update-manager/meta-release file on my system.  This file appears use an HTTP URL to point to http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/meta-release where the various Ubuntu releases from Warty 04.10 to Raring 13.04 are listed.  This file lists the releases, their support status, the date of release and has a link to the Release file.\nNow the Release file has a corresponding GPG signature and the sha1sum of the Packages file which, in turn, has the sha1sum of the individual DEB binaries that get installed.  The recent releases also have an upgrade script and a corresponding GPG signature for these too.  All sounds good.\nMy question is about the meta-release file itself.  It is not served over HTTPS and I cannot find a GPG signature for it.  If somebody replaces this file could they somehow cause my machine to upgrade...\n\n\n*\n\n*...to a signed release that hasn't yet gone through security testing?\n\n*...to an old release that is not supported and has unfixed security vulnerabilities?\n\n\nA: do-release-upgrade requires admin rights, and if you are on a LTS release, will stay on that and not automatically bump you up a version. If you use non-official sources it brings up a bunch of warning messages.\nHowever, GUI variants on this are, to the end user, no different to UAC on Windows, where anyone not technically minded enough will just click the button or type in the password, ignore warnings and go off to make a cup of tea. So in practice, it's no more or less secure than Windows Update.\nIn short - I wouldn't trust the upgrade to be secure. In fact, if you are on a LTS and using Ubuntu for mission critical stuff, I'd avoid upgrading a major version until your release is no longer supported - upgrading does break stuff in subtle ways which takes time for you to fix.\n\nA: *\n\n*Only Admin can cause permanent changes to the files in pc. Guest users can't change these(or any other) files.So no one else than the admin himself/herself can cause update-manager to look for some potentially harmful link.  \n\n*now, the Admin will not damage his own pc(unless he is out of his mind).And one should never let any third-person to access Admin Rights.So there is practically no risk.\n\n*Maybe malicious apps could,but if you use trusted repos,this risk does not prevail.\n\n*As @gertvdijk said,user still has to confirm the upgrades\n\n*And finally you can always restore the original link.\n\n\nSo in short \"somebody\" can't change this file.Only the Admin can make changes to files.\n\nthis process could surely be more secure.maybe software updater could encrypt these files and also use a gpg key\n\nFinally Ubuntu weekly newsletter keeps you updated with recent updates/upgrades.you can confirm from it so that you can ensure your pc's security to the best.\n", "Q: No GUI when I login to the Enlightment DE (Ubuntu 13.04) Ubuntu noob here again. \nI recently installed the desktop environment Enlightenment for Ubuntu 13.04. \nIt was running great until now.

If you need a (more or less)  stable e17,I'd go with the semi-official PPA: \nhttps://launchpad.net/~efl/+archive/trunk\nIt might not work, to directly install the PPA packages without first uninstalling e17 (and maybe also all the EFL libs). \nTo completely get rid of e17, run the following command:\nsudo apt-get purge e17\n\nTo also remove libs installed by e17 and not needed by anything else:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nYou can also try to reset your e17 settings to defaults.

But, after the installation was over, there was no grub that let me decide between Ubuntu and Windows 8.\nSo, I used EasyBCD. The grub appeared at the startup now. However, it would only run Windows 8. On running Ubuntu, it would say something like, \"a recent hardware and software change has caused this... use system repair etc.. and it will also mention something abut BCD.\"\nHence, I experimented some more, but unfortunately, I ended up deleting BCD entries (or something else related mbr), because of which neither Windows nor Ubuntu would start. After reading a lot about how Microsoft ships laptops that recognize only Windows 8, I disabled secured boot, used Ubuntu repair and Windows 8 repair. In the process, I ended up using commands like bootrec.exe and also encountered grub-rescue and what not. \nAfter all this nightmare, I am now back to square one. I do not want to do something stupid again. Can anyone tell me what is the simplest way to set up a grub that would allow me to choose the OS at the startup ?\n\nA: The current state of your system is quite unclear, so it's hard to say what the best way to proceed is, except to run additional diagnostics. The Boot Info Script will provide at least some of the relevant information -- but given the number of things you've tried, there will still be some uncertainty about what that script returns. If you run this script and need advice, edit your post to include a link to the RESULTS.txt file that the Boot Info Script returns, and add a comment to this reply to alert me to the new information.\nIf Windows is booting right now, then there is at least one thing you could try that stands a good chance of working: Install my rEFInd boot manager in Windows. Be sure to install the ext4fs driver (or the driver for whatever filesystem you used for Ubuntu). Depending on your configuration, that may enable you to boot Linux directly by using a rEFInd icon that refers to the Linux kernel (a file with a name that includes the string vmlinuz). If Windows is not booting, you could try rEFInd from a CD-R or USB flash drive. (The rEFInd downloads page includes links to images for both these media.) That might get Windows and/or Linux booting, but I can't make any promises of that.\nAnother comment: The Boot Configuration Data (BCD) is a Windows-specific boot loader construct. Thus, the fact that you got messages about BCD when attempting to boot Linux is a clear indication that you were not booting Linux. Furthermore, the last I heard EasyBCD was pretty much useless for assisting in dual-boot configurations on EFI systems. Thus, you shouldn't bother with that software. Instead, use the firmware's own boot manager, GRUB, rEFInd, or another boot manager to select which OS to boot.\nRight now, the easiest way to deal with Secure Boot is to disable it. If you must boot with Secure Boot enabled, though, it can be done. Theoretically, Ubuntu supports Secure Boot, but I've seen enough problem reports that it's clear that this support is far from perfect. If you use a third-party tool like rEFInd, you'll need to take extra steps to get it working with Secure Boot. The rEFInd documentation includes a page on Secure Boot, so consult it if you want to use rEFInd with Secure Boot. For other boot loaders, I've written a more general page on Secure Boot.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Lts Cpyrit-Cuda/pyrit/cpyrit-opencl install problems Hi im having a problem building and installing pyrit cpyrit-cuda and cpyrit opencl here is what im getting when i try to build and run the installer..\nbrandon@sanfran-Dell-System-Inspiron-N7110:~/cpyrit-opencl-0.4.0$ sudo python setup.py install\nsvn: '.' is not a working copy\nrunning install\nrunning build\nrunning build_ext\nBuilding modules...\nbuilding 'cpyrit._cpyrit_opencl' extension\ngcc -pthread -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O2 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fPIC -I/usr/local/cuda/include -I/usr/include/python2.7 -c _cpyrit_opencl.c -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/_cpyrit_opencl.o -Wall -fno-strict-aliasing -DVERSION=\"0.4.0\"\ngcc -pthread -shared -Wl,-O1 -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -Wl,-z,relro build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/_cpyrit_opencl.o -lcrypto -lz -lOpenCL -o build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/cpyrit/_cpyrit_opencl.so\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lOpenCL\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\nerror: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1\nbrandon@sanfran-Dell-System-Inspiron-N7110:~/cpyrit-opencl-0.4.0$ f\n\nSomeone please help if possible all responses are greatly appreciated thanks!!\n\nA: The error message you got is telling you, that the OpenCL libary could not be found. Probably it isn't installed on your system, for Ubuntu is supposed to put a link to the OpenCL library in the default library folder /usr/lib. \nIn order to install OpenCL, install the proprietary graphics card drivers for your system. The tool \"additional drivers\" (program name: jockey) should help you find the appropriate package, but you can also install them manually. If you have an nVidia graphics card, this is probably the package nvidia-current or nvidia-current-updates for even newer versions. If you have an AMD graphics card, install fglrx or fglrx-updates. Do not use the *-experimental packages, for these (at least for AMD) do not include OpenCL functionality.\nYou might also need to install the opencl-headers package. On nvidia, there's a metapackage avialable, called nvidia-opencl-dev which should install everything needed to start working with OpenCL. \nIf your are certain that you installed OpenCL, and still don't get it running, find out where your libOpenCL.so file resides. Simply run\nlocate libOpenCL.so\n\nThis should give you a list of files of that name installed on your PC. In my case, there's a link \"/usr/lib/libOpenCL.so\", pointing towards the file itself, which is \"/usr/lib/fglrx/libOpenCL.so\". This means that in my case, the folder would be /usr/lib, or /usr/lib/fglrx. Once you know the folder name, you can run your install command again, but with LD_FLAGS set. I don't know how sudo reacts to setting variables, so I'd run an interactive root shell and set LD_FLAGS within:\nsudo -i\nLD_FLAGS=\"--library-path=<folder the lib is in>\" python setup.py install\nexit\n\nIf (for some strange reason, for instance if you didn't use Ubuntus graphics driver packages) your OpenCL lib is not installed in a default location (meaning: not in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib or /lib), and there's also no symlink to it in one of these folders, I'd either put a symlink manually (the dirty, but easy hack), or write a file with the folder the lib is in and put it in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ (have a look at the other files there to see what I mean and to check if it's not already there) and run \"sudo ldconfig\", in order for your programs to find it. The folders listed in files in /etc/ld.so.conf.d are a list of directories, that are searched for dynamic libraries by ldconfig, which in turn generates an index that is used by program to search for shared libraries.\nOtherwise you might have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH every time you run your compiled OpenCL application...\n", "Q: Laptop powers down for no apparent reason Over the past day, my laptop which is running Ubuntu 12.04 has been abruptly powering down for no apparent reason. It has a full battery charge, so there are no issues there.\nI can't think of any reason why this is happening. Any help would be appreciated because this is leading to a lot of unsaved work being lost.\n\nA: Your laptop's crashes could be caused by several possible reasons. I will discuss one possible reason, overheating, in this answer. Overheating is an easy problem to detect. You can continually monitor your computer's hardware temperatures using an application from the Ubuntu Software Center called Psensor.\nInstall Psensor. Also install lm-sensors to detect your computer's hardware sensors. Then detect your computer's hardware sensors by opening the terminal and running the command:\nsudo sensors-detect\n\nThen you will get asked a lot of questions about what hardware you want the program to detect. It is generally safe and recommended to accept the default answers to all questions, unless you know what you're doing.\nIn Ubuntu 16.04 and later Psensor detect your computer's hardware sensors automatically without running sudo sensors-detect\nPsensor is displayed on the desktop as a little thermometer icon in the notification area in the upper right-hand corner of the desktop. You can right-click the thermometer icon at any time to display the hardware temperatures. As a general guideline, a hardware temperature of 60o C is hot. A hardware temperature of 70o C and above is too hot, and could cause your system to crash.\n", "Q: Dell Inspiron 5220 Screen Brightness buttons I've installed Ubuntu 13.04, everything seems fine except using the Fn key to change the laptop's brightness.\nIt just stays permanently on full brightness.\nEven if I go into System Settings and change the brightness with the slider, it stays at full.\n\nA: If your willing to use a bit of a hack, this might work.\nMy Dell Inspiron had the exact same problem, so I came up with this little python script and a couple of minor changes.\nI'm not sure how universal it is, but my computer has a file called \"brightness\" in the path \"/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight\" which this script depends on. If that is not present then this solution will likely not work.\nAssuming that is there, the next step is to give ourselves permission to write to it. We'll add this line to \"/etc/rc.local\" so that it is executed at startup automatically. I used nano to edit it. Gedit doesn't seem to work. So in the terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T):\n$ sudo nano /etc/rc.local\n\nAdd this line before exit 0:\nchmod 666 /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nIf you want to be able to test this without a reboot, you can run that same command now as root:\nsudo chmod 666 /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nNow we, as a normal user can change the brightness through that file. But instead of editing that file for each brightness change, let's use a simple python script:\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom sys import argv\n\nimport os\n\nPATH = \"/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight\"        # You shouldn't have to change this,\n                                                     # if you need to and you know what\n                                                     # you're doing, go ahead.\n\ndef getMax():\n    maxFile = open(os.path.join(PATH, \"max_brightness\"))\n    ret = int(maxFile.readline())\n    maxFile.close()\n\n    return ret\n\nMAX = getMax()\nMIN = 200                # You can change 200. My 0 was literally black (I could not see\n                         # the screen), so play around with that.\n\nINC = (MAX-MIN)/8        # You can change 8. It is approximately how many times you have\n                         # to change the brightness before it goes from MAX to MIN, or\n                         # vice versa.\n\ndef getCurrentBrightness():\n    curBrightnessFile = open(os.path.join(PATH, \"brightness\"))\n    return int(curBrightnessFile.readline())\n\ndef setBrightness(newValue):\n    brightnessFile = open(os.path.join(PATH, \"brightness\"), \"w\")\n\n    brightnessFile.write(str(newValue))\n\n    brightnessFile.close()\n\ndef up(increment = INC):\n    change(increment)\n\ndef down(decrement = INC):\n    change(-decrement)\n\ndef change(increment):\n    curBrightness = getCurrentBrightness()\n\n    newBrightness = constrain(curBrightness + increment)\n\n    setBrightness(newBrightness)\n\ndef constrain(value):\n    if value >= MAX: print \"MAX\"\n    if value \nNow, copy that code into a file and save it wherever you like. You can end the name in \".py\" as is the python tradition, but it is not required. Now make it executable. Either you can find it in Files, right click on it, click properties, click the permissions tab in the top, and make sure \"Allow executing file as a program\" is checked. Or you can navigate to it in the terminal and run this:\n$ chmod +x /Path/to/file.py\n\nNext, copy the path to the file, or remember it; make sure you have it. Go to \"System Settings\" > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\".\nClick the \"+\" button in the bottom. For the name you can put \"Brighten Screen\". For command, put the path to the python script. If there are spaces in the path, surround it in quotes. After the path (outside of the quotes) put a space, and then \"up\".\n\"/path to/the/python script.py\" up\n\nDo this again, but use \"Dim Screen\" for the name, and use \"down\" instead of \"up\".\n\"/path to/the/python script.py\" down\n\nIf you click on the \"Disabled\" label to the right, you can assign keyboard shortcuts to these commands. I tried the original Fn keys, but they did not seem to work, so I used <Alt-Up> and <Alt-Down> instead. This can also be run from the terminal by executing the file, but the keyboard shortcuts make a lot more sense, and are much more like the original Fn keys.\nI put a couple of comments in the code (lines followed by a \"#\") mentioning numbers you could change to make it work better for you that you might take a look at.\nThis seems ridiculously complex when I write it out here, but it probably took me two minutes to actually add to my system (plus the python), so I think it should go pretty smoothly.\nI hope this helps. Good Luck!\n", "Q: From windows xp to ubuntu 13.04 I managed to dig out my old XP machine and want to install Ubuntu on it. Anyway, what I'm wondering is whether I should choose the 32-bit or the 64-bit.\nOn the download page there stands that if you have UEFI firmware you should choose the 64-bit, but I don't know what that is so?\n\nA: UEFI is something new, it kind of replaces the BIOS. It's used on new Computers that come most times with Windows 8. You don't have to worry about that.\n32-bit will work in every case. If you can, you should use a 64-bit installation. It's faster and supports more (random access) memory. You can use up to between 3 to 4 GB of RAM with a 32-bit machine.\nIf it's an old computer it may support only 32-bit. Newer ones support mostly 64-bit (and 32-bit too). If you try to install a 64-bit Ubuntu on a 32-bit machine, it won't work, so you can just try if you want. If it does not work, try 32-bit Ubuntu. Your computer should tell you if you try to install 64-bit Ubuntu on a 32-bit computer.\nAlternatively just look whether your windows XP installation is 32-bit or 64-bit. It should be visible somewhere in the \"Workspace > Right-Click > Properties\" (Names may be different since I did never use Windows in english.)\nIf you feel Ubuntu is too slow on your computer, or even the 32-bit version does not work correctly, please understand that Ubuntu is a modern system that is supposed to run on not too old computers. In this case, consider using these Ubuntu derivatives:\nhttp://lubuntu.net/\nhttp://xubuntu.org/\nThese are supposed to run smoothly on older computers and offer a different desktop experience (with better performance).\n\nA: If it's 3 years or older you have a good shot at it being 32 bit. I wouldn't focus on the UEFI statement too much. The question still remains if you have 64bit or 32bit CPU. If you don't see any stickers on the outside of your laptop stating 64bit or x64 and the original Operating System pre-installed on it was Windows XP, I'm willing to be it's 32 bit.\n\nA: Unless you have more than 3GB of RAM memory on your computer you should choose the 32-bit version of Ubuntu to install. It's very uncommon for an old PC like yours to have UEFI firmware instead of the usual BIOS.\nYou'll get better performance on your old hardware if you select one of the lightweight versions of Ubuntu, either Xubuntu or Lubuntu.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu non-carrier phones be available? I live in India, where CDMA technology (where you can't change your SIM card, and you have to stick with one service provider once you buy the phone) is not popular. GSM is the general trend. I am really really keen on buying an Ubuntu phone. But so far, i have only heard of phones shipping Ubuntu along with a carrier (which i believe is the same as the service provider), and i'm wondering if canonical will ship Ubuntu phones, without any carriers, in which you can insert your own SIM card? I've wanted the Ubuntu phone to be my first smartphone. Now, if Ubuntu phone is going to release in April, 2014, and that too, without GSM capability, i don't know if I should wait for it to release. I want Ubuntu Phone to be my first smartphone, but if the wait isn't really worth it, should i go ahead with another phone now?\n\nA: According to the Ubuntu Edge website (Which I think you are referring to), the Ubuntu phone is unlocked.  As such, it is open to any carrier.  ALL these phones will be non-carrier specific.  Now the problem here is that I doubt that the project is going to go ahead, because funding does seem insignificant.  Anyway, you can read more up on the Ubuntu phone here:\nhttp://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ubuntu-edge\n\nA: The Nexus 4 (which you can buy unlocked directly by Google) is capable of being flashed to run the Ubuntu Touch OS. But that's supposedly risky as it may brick your phone and is only recommended for developers. As of right now, I'm not aware of any phone that you can buy with Ubuntu Touch pre-installed, unlocked or not.

Monkeying around with the kernel made no difference, so I asked here (can't find my old question). Someone advised upgrading to 12.10, so I did it but it didn't boot. \nAll I get is a partial boot and a black screen. I managed to get into the GRUB, and messed about in recovery mode. If I go via recovery mode, I can get to a command line, but it freezes after a couple of minutes. I tried doing sudo apt-get update, tried uninstalling and reinstalling graphics drivers, tried the whole clean/dpkg repair/check file system, not going so well.\nI boot off a USB now, which means I get a fresh system each time which sucks, can't boot graphically, and don't really know what I'm doing with the command line. Can anyone help me?\nUPDATE AND MORE INFO: I used the boot repair program, it made no difference. It returned http://paste.ubuntu.com/5855376, so there might be some helpful info in there?\nMy computer is an Acer Aspire 5750, it has an Intel® Core™ i5-2430M CPU @ 2.40GHz × 4, and Intel HD graphics 3000. Not sure which graphics drivers I should be using, but I don't have Nvidia, which I understand was the cause of some similar trouble.\nUPDATE THE SECOND: I've narrowed it down a bit more. It seems like an incomplete install of X11, according to my friend who is more knowledgeable about these things. cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log puts out http://paste.ubuntu.com/5861520/, which seems to basically say that it can't load intel, vesa, modesetting or fbdev (also some fonts are missing, but I doubt that's the problem).\nI tried adding the x-updates repository and doing apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade (with and without -f and -m), but it appears to have made no difference whatsoever. On the advice of , I made /etc/X11/xorg.conf (which was missing before) and put in\nSection \"Device\"\n   Identifier \"intel\"\n   Driver \"intel\"\n   Option \"AccelMethod\" \"uxa\"\nEndSection  \nbut it changed nothing. Not sure what to do now.\n\nA: FIXED! Apparently, X wasn't configured properly. After reinstalling X11, I tried Xorg -configure, but it kept talking about another X process running. I went and got the 3.7.7 kernel, rebooted, and got into low graphics mode. Was able to get it to configure from there. This whole process has been very educational, but I'm glad it's over.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 13.04 via the Windows installer Hello,\n*If I install Ubuntu 13.04 using the windows installer, will it overwrite my windows?*\nI am asking this because I like the freedom of Ubuntu, but I want Windows just in case \nthanks :)\n\nA: Incase you're still looking, here's the WUBI Installer for 13.04. For all other Ubuntu releases see here.\n\nA: no if you use wubi (the windows installer) it will install in the free space (it makes a very large file and installs it in there). This is the case for me. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi. edit.  There is no support for  wubi for 13.04.

I suggest you install gdisk even if you do not use it for creating partitions.\nsudo parted /dev/sda units print\n\nsudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nIf using the nVidia driver you need nomodeset. From grub menu press e for edit, scroll down to Linux line and change quiet splash to nomodeset. But some new systems also require other boot parameters.\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?\n\nA: The error /mnt/newinstall is not a block device is caused by your giving the parameters in the wrong order.\nmount newdevice mountpoint says \"mount the device with name newdevice in the directory with name mountpoint\".\nSo what you need to do is change the second command to \nsudo mount /dev/sdb8 \n\n", "Q: Turn off ethernet without turning off WiFi I'm new to Ubuntu but somewhat familiar with PCI.

This may be a crazy question, but here goes...\nMy brother suggested that I could somehow use either a Ubuntu Live Boot CD or Flash drive or Kubuntu as a way to diagnose issues I'm currently having with my laptop. I'm running Windows 7 and for some reason my laptop has suddenly started freezing during Windows start up. This started immediately after I began seeing the hard drive light remaining on and my computer running very, very slowly - even though when I checked Task Manager it said that no applications or unusual processes were running at the time and CPU usage was 0%. Strange, I know.\nI've used the Restore disks 3 times already, thinking maybe it was a virus, even though I run Norton 360 and it found nothing upon a full system scan. But every time I end up with Windows failing to start up at all, or it getting stuck on the \"Windows Starting\" screen for at least 15-20 minutes before it starts.\nI'm at a total loss here. I'm thinking it is either a Hard drive issue or perhaps a RAM issue, but I am a total moron when it comes to the operational aspect of computers. I don't know where to begin. My brother said that if I used a flash drive of Ubuntu or Kubuntu and tried to boot from there that I would know immediately if it was my Hard drive because it wouldn't operate. I don't understand that since it wouldn't be operating off my hard drive, it would be running from the CD/flash drive.\nDoes anyone have any clues on what I can do to check this out? I'm tempted to buy a new hard drive and RAM, but would hate to buy something I can't return if they aren't the issue.\nI'm stuck...any help would be very appreciated. Thanks so much and have a wonderful weekend.\n\nA: Yes, you can use a Live image of Ubuntu to diagnose several problems in you HDD (no matter what OS you have installed there). The only thing that matters is the Operating System that is installed has been shutdown properly (no hibernation) \nFor HDD problems you can use gsmartcontrol. \nBoot from Live CD/DVD/USB of Ubuntu and select \"Try Ubuntu\". Then open a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and issue the following commands \nsudo apt-get install gsmartcontrol \n\nThen run in terminal \ngksudo gsmartcontrol \n\nSelect your HDD and check the attributes. \n\nIf you see any red marked text you will understand the failure of HDD. \nFor RAM problems you can use a Live image and memtest86+ \nSee here how : Memtest with Ubuntu 12.04 live CD\n\nA: You have an option for both without the need to install anything else:\nChecking your RAM (MemTest)\nSimply boot your LiveCD, LiveDVD or LiveUSB and on the first menu you will see the option for Checking you Memory RAM (This option will not show on EFI boot enabled systems. For an explanation of this behavior please visit the MemTest86 Support Page and a Bug Report already present since 2011):\n\nThis is most likely the BEST app to check your memory. Simply wait until the first line that says PASS gets to 100% (The one that says 4% on the image below). It will repeat itself but with one pass should be enough:\n\nIf you do have a bad memory, you will get at least one RED row on the bottom half of the app. If you get at least one, then you have some serious Memory problems. In the image below, the user has MANY memory problems and should immediately change the RAM:\n\nI suggest to test each memory individually if you do find a memory error. This way you will know which memory slot is the culprit and can simply change that one.\nChecking you HDD or SDD\nIn the LiveCD, LiveDVD or LiveUSB and without any additional installation you have the Disk application. Simply open Dash and type disk, you will see the \"Disk Utility\" app:\n\nOpen it and it will look something like this:\n\nNow select your HDD or SDD and then select the Gear icons to the right. From that menu select the SMART option:\n\nHere you can see the state of the disk, Temperature, Powered on time and any errors it has, any FAILS it has and you can even check it for problems with the Start Self-Test button below:\n\nSo as you can see the LiveCD, LiveDVD or LiveUSB comes in handy when you want to do some diagnostics on the computer.\n\nA: As a more recent data point complementing and partially contradicting this answer by @Luis Alvarado, I used a USB flash drive with an ISO image of Ubuntu 14.04 on a Lenovo ThinkPad T420 machine but didn't see any screen offering me the option of a memory test. Instead, my choices were \"Test Ubuntu\" and \"Install Ubuntu\" as can be shown in the screen below:\n\nThe Ububntu USB flash drive was created with USB Creator (usb-creator-gtk from the command line).\nInstead, when I created a USB flash drive with an ISO image of Ubuntu 16.04 using the Unetbootin utility, I was offered the following choices:\n\nCaveat: Upon selecting the \"Test memory\" option you need to press TAB and remove the initrd=/ubninit part from the boot options otherwise you get a message: \"cannot load ramdisk with an old kernel image\". This is apparently a workaround around a bug of Unetbootin (suggested here, here and here).\nI don't think that Ubuntu 14.04 versus 16.04 had any bearing in the ability to run the memory test. Instead I believe it was simply a matter of the utility that was used to create the Ubuntu flash drive. So I think if you use the Unetbootin utility you should still get the memory test option even with modern Ubuntu releases.\nupdate\nIn the comments section of this answer Luis Alvarado states that this is more of a UEFI vs. BIOS thing as opposed to USB Creator vs. Unetbootin thing. However, the fact remains that on the exact same machine the USB stick created with Unetbootin presented me with the option for a memory test whereas the USB stick created with USB Creator didn't.\n\nA: For testing ram -> boot from the cd/usb and hold down a key (it will load and give option for testing memory) Memtest with Ubuntu 12.04 live CD  For hard drive boot all the way to the ubuntu and in programs there will be a program called disks #(in disks click on the drive then the cog symbol and choose SMART) data or gparted.

I want to use a torrent to download some files and on my Windows laptop I can get speeds of 1.4mbps (on average), the same was true when I had Windows on this desktop machine. However now I am trying to download using Ubuntu (using Vuze, though I did try using Transmission) and am only getting speeds of 140kbps max. Also no matter what torrent I try it never connects to more than 3 seeds. The port is open (used three checks) and is routed to this Ubuntu machine. I was wondering if Ubuntu limits connections?\n\nA: Ubuntu itself does not limit connections. I have run the Deluge BitTorrent client and had around 1000 connections going simultaneously (on a good torrent).\nIt is possible that Vuze/Azurues might have a setting somewhere for throttling the numbers of connections (probably in the same place as bandwidth settings).\n\nA: What you are describing is the TCP half-open connection limit which Windows suffers. Linux doesn't have such limit. In fact, due the nature of Linux, which is UNIX-like, and characteristics of server; a hard limit to the amount of any connection is a flaw. Now, there are limits that can be configured easily, like the maximum amount of guaranteed sockets:\n➜  sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range\nnet.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 32768    61000\n➜  sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout\nnet.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 60\n\nWhat says these numbers? Umm... that Linux guarantee (61000-32768)/60 sockets at the same time, is a total of 470, now, these are not important for torrent connections. In fact you can have 1000 connections with this configuration. Chrome at any moment has 30 active and open sockets. You can have several services using the internet and possibly never reach this limit (services as client transfers, etc., things you use in a desktop). There are other limits but none is directly relevant to torrents.\nSo, does Ubuntu limit connections? Yes, but is not something you have to be concerned with.\n", "Q: How can I open Terminator with mutiple windows already open When I run Terminator i want it to open up already split vertically 8 time.

As far as I know only the play, previous, next buttons do.\nIf you cannot get the box to go away by unsticking the keys you may have  a key that is going bad and so is giving you spontaneous key presses.  I that case the best thing to do would be to disable the affected key and then enable it again if you get  new keyboard.  Unless you are able to figure out which key is giving you the problem you may have to try then one at a time until the box goes away. This will stop the keypresses form doing anything on the OS so the key can spam away and the system will just ignore it.\nGo to system settings in the dash and select the Keyboard(my mouse pointer is on it)\n**\non the window that come up click on the Shortcuts tab and then select sound and Media you will see the list pop up for the various button, clicking on the list will highlight the line and will give you the option for a new accelerator from here you would press a new key or combination of keys to preform that function.  To disable that function you press Backspace.  \nYou could either disable it or set it to a new key and see if that makes your box go away.  I would disable then one at a time until I found the culprit and then re-enable all the good ones and then change the function of the problem key to another key combo.  If you click on the wrong one you can either click off of it or press Esc  and it will reset to the last setting.

However, due to my UEFI setup, the Ubuntu installer fails after it has already been installed once and leaves my GRUB install completely unusable (and sending me into grub rescue upon boot), and I have to do a total factory restore to be able to continue. This is not ideal, as I have to reinstall and set up everything on each OS I have in use.\nHow can I restore Ubuntu to the state that it was in upon install? If this is not possible, then how can I do a reinstall of Ubuntu over the same partition without reinstalling GRUB? Thanks to anyone who can help.\n\nA: Here is one method that might help,\n1.Mount your partition:\nsudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt   (X=whichever sda number you're using)\nBind mount some other necessary stuff:\nfor i in /sys /proc /run /dev; do sudo mount --bind \"$i\" \"/mnt$i\"; done\nchroot into your Ubuntu install:\nsudo chroot /mnt\n2.Time to update grub:\nupdate-grub\n3.Depending on your situation, you might have to reinstall grub: //if you got errors in the previous step\ngrub-install /dev/sda\nupdate-grub \nIf everything worked without errors, then you're all set:\nexit\nsudo reboot\n", "Q: NVIDIA X Server Display Configuration - I don't have any resolution!

I see, when I connect a mouse in usb, within seconds my mouse starts woking, similarly for pendrive it is mounted. I just want to know as its the same USB port, How do Ubuntu understands what type of device has been connected? I am asking this question because I have a wimax modem, but ubuntu seems not to get that. If I know how automatically ubuntu gets that, I may be able to manually start the modem. and BTW, I just need to know how they are recognized?\n\nA: USB devices provide information describing what they are so the OS can automatically select an appropriate driver to communicate with the device.  If your modem does not work, it is probably because there is no Linux driver for it.\n", "Q: Is it just me or were people trying to hack my server?

So, this is probably a quickie.\nI've gotten a copy of Ubuntu 11.10 on a memory stick. The contents of the folder is similar to what I found in the .ISO of Ubuntu 12.04. My question to you now, is as follows:\nI don't actually have the .ISO-file, but I have all the contents .. Can I still use it to install?\n_ Edit:\nI am indeed aware that this is an outdated version. The reason I cannot install a newer version, however, is because I am working offshore, and I have a 128/256 kbps internet connection here (Varies between the two). This connection is shared among the entire crew and computerized functions onboard, meaning an Ubuntu download would take days upon days, not to mention it would render the connection useless to anyone else. I simply have to use whatever I can get my hands on from other members of the crew. \n\nA: If you got a copy of it on a USB then it should be bootable, but before you boot into it make sure you have set up a partition \n\nA: Yes, On mac os you can move the contents to a folder (ubuntu) and then open terminal and type:\nhdiutil makehybrid -o ubuntu.iso /path/to/ubuntu/folder\nthen you can burn it to a cd, put in the cd and type:\nhdiutil burn ubuntu.iso\n\nA: If you don't have a disk then download the iso file then download Daemon tools and it will let you format the iso to the usb so it will become bootable.

I'd recommend to try to update the Mainboard firmware (BIOS), and if that doesn't help, try to use the latest Ubuntu version. If the Linux developers get to know about buggy firmware, they often implement so called quirks, which should enable Linux to run on it nevertheless, and maybe a suitable quirk for your hardware is already included in the latest Ubuntu.\nYou can also try to disable ACPI when booting, but if you don't get it running after installation, you might not be able to use power management features. To disable ACPI, you can pass the ACPI=off parameter to the kernel. A temporary way to do this is to press \"e\" in the GRUB menu to edit the current selection, then add the paramter in the appropriate line (the one that also has quiet written in it) and then press CTRL+x to boot. For a permanent setting after installation, edit /etc/defaults/grub. For more details see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingACPI\n\nA: Make sure that you have the partition set up correctly, and that there is space for it. I got this same error before, when trying to install on a partition with not enough space allocated. If you still get this error, or you have enough space in the partition/hard drive, I would suggest using Ubuntu Desktop to install, if you want Ubuntu on your main hard drive. It is safer and easier to set up.\n", "Q: Where to locate a tgz file and contents of it? I downloaded processing-2.0.1-linux64.tgz. \nIn Windows, when I download a non-install software (.exe) I locate it under Program Files directory so that it stays with other software. I don't want it to run in Downloads or somewhere else. I'm vety miticulous about my directory structure. \nSo in Ubuntu I want processing software to run just like firefox.

I tried it however the tgz file was disabled, not clickable.\n\nThis is contents of processing-2.0.1 folder.\n\nA: Firstly a .tgz file is not a program file.  It is an gz compressed tar archive file, and as such is not runnable.  Usually, this will be a source package and will need to be built.  \nIt appears you have already expanded it into a directory.  If not the command tar xzf processing-2.0.1-linux64.tgz' will expand it.  I would copy or move it to/opt` and expand it there\nFrom the contents it appears to be Java based program.  And will fail if you don't have Java installed.  \nOpen a terminal window and cd to directory where you have expanded the archive.  Try running processing and processing-java.  Remember which one starts the program as you want.  \nTo run the program from the classpath (assumes expanded to /opt/processing-2.0.1) create the following file in a different directory. (I'll use the name processing ). \n#!/usr/bin/bash\ncd /opt/processing-2.0.1\n./processing\n\nThen run the following command to add make it executable it to /usr/local/bin. \nsudo mv processing /usr/local/bin\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/processing\n\nYou can also edit the menu to add a new item, or create a desktop icon.

How can I use a GUI to edit my sudoers file?\nI want to add the nopasswd option without having to learn any vi shortcuts.\n\nA: No there isn't.  It doesn't exist.  The assumption is that if you're editing the sudoers file that you understand the rammifications of the thing.  The requisite is that all people that understand those rammifications actually know how to use vi.\n\nA: Instead of a GUI editor, try using nano.  While not a GUI, it is more intuitive for new users than vi.\nThere are a couple ways to get visudo to use the editor of your choice.\n1) My preferred method: Set your EDITOR environment variable to point to the path of the editor you wish to use.  For a one-off-edit issue the command \"export EDITOR=/usr/bin/nano\" before issuing the visudo command.\nYou may also permanently set EDITOR in your shell's profile.  Note that using this environment variable method requires sudo to have been built with the --with-env-editor option, which I believe is common on most distros.\n2) Modify the sudoers file to contain \"Defaults editor=/usr/bin/nano\" or substitute the path to whatever other editor you choose.\n", "Q: How to invert Ctrl and Cmd on a Macbook Pro keyboard? using Mac computers for few years, I got accustomed of using the Cmd key on the keyboard as a standard Ctrl key. \nWith Ubuntu 13.04 on my Macbook Pro 5,3 (2009), the Cmd is used for Unity controls, and Ctrl for applications shortcuts. Is there any way to switch the two keys? So that, as an example, close a tab in Firefox would be Cmd+W instead of Ctrl+W?\n\nA: I found out a workaround. The solution is to use the xmodmap utility and make it load a personal file with the correct mapping for the keyboard.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and create a new file in your /home folder, lets call it .Xmodmap\nnano .Xmodmap\n\n(I use nano as a nice text editor inside the console, you can use Gedit instead, install nano with the command sudo apt-get install nano if you'd like to test it, it's quite obvious to handle.)\n\n*Copy/paste the following content to the new file:\nclear control\nclear mod4\n\nkeycode 105 =\nkeycode 206 =\n\nkeycode 133 = Control_L NoSymbol Control_L\nkeycode 134 = Control_R NoSymbol Control_R\nkeycode 37 = Super_L NoSymbol Super_L\n\nadd control = Control_L\nadd control = Control_R\nadd mod4 = Super_L\n\n\n*Make the file executable.\nchmod +x .Xmodmap\n\n\n*Test it now with the following command:\nxmodmap .Xmodmap\n\nThe dash should now appear with Ctrl instead of CMD, hurra!\n\n*Now we want the file to be executed each time the system starts up. Open the Startup Applications utility and add a new entry, name it as you want and put the following comand in it:\n/user/bin/xmodmap /home/YOURUSERNAME/.Xmodmap\n\nReboot, it should be ok. If it is not, you should add a .xinitrc file in your /Home folder, and add the command inside it.

Where do I start to have the basic knowledge of networking in Ubuntu and the basic knowledge about apache,mysql etc servers(If I have interpreted the client/server/host meanings correctly)?\nAnd by the way, my ultimate goal is learning Penetration Testing. But I have realized that without knowing this basic networking stuffs I can't do much. I have set up a virtual network in vBox with two Ubuntu OS. So my question is how do I proceed in learning networking, I just need a guideline? \nPS. Should I Install Ubuntu server in one VM and normal in the other?\n\nA: The best resource is Ubuntu's documentation. I have listed below some pages within that documentation and some other sources to help with you.\n\n\n*\n\n*The index of networking topics, covering topics such as DHCP, home servers, WiFi and security.\n\n*DHCP (general), static DNS, dynamic DNS, configuration of a DHCP server.\n\n\nThe LAMP topics (Linux, Apache, PHP and MySQL) are covered here.\nAs for security, the Ubuntu Wiki has an index page, which covers various topics such as intrusion detection, firewall and encryption. You may also wish to consult the guidance given by Ubuntu's Security Team. \nI'm not sure how networking works in a virtualised environment. The needed set up also depends on what you want to achieve. For example, any security testing should probable be done on a real installation, as any limitations, bugs or security features could make your testing results unreliable or inaccurate.\nFinally, this blog article lists various distributions that specialise into Penetration Testing, such as backtrack-linux or NodeZero, which is based on Ubuntu.\n\nA: If you are serious about developing a skill-set on penetration testing, and plan to do more than just run scripts someone else wrote, you should start with the basics. \nI suggest a three step approach:\nFirst and foremost you should develop a solid understanding of computer networks. I have found A. Tanenbaum's \"Computer Networks\" now in 5th ed invaluable on this (I have 3rd ed and still consult it from time to time.) ISBN-13: 978-0132126953 Steep price but worth every penny. \nSecond, you should start building your knowledge of network protocols (like TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, etc) These are the backbone on which the various internet services are build. \nAnd the last step would be to focus on specific applications like web servers, mail servers, database servers, etc\nThese three steps will help you gain some traction. After that you will be able to \"dig deeper\" on specific setups, depending on installed operating system, available services, network topologies, etc \nNote 1: The field is so vast that its very easy to get overwhelmed. Don't get disappointed if at first nothing makes sense and press on. As the different concepts start to sink in, you will start seeing the interconnections between the various parts and everything will start to make sense.\nNote 2 : The reason I suggest buying the book is because its a textbook and as such it is highly structured. You can get the same information from around the internet, but it's not worth the time and effort to try to structure those info in a way that is coherent and that highlights the overall picture.\n", "Q: Black screen after log-in on 13.04!

I want to access my PC from anywhere. I'm able to connect to the PC within the same LAN using the local IP. However, outside the local network I see a connection time out error.\nHow can I configure my OpenSSH server on Host and my router to allow SSH connections from anywhere over the internet?\n\nA: You need your remote Client, your home router, and your Host server to cooperate in creating an SSH connection on the same Port. Use port-forwarding within your router's configuration to forward the correct port (e.g., Port 22) to the local IP address of your Host server.\n\n\n*\n\n*Port-forwarding settings should be present inside \"NAT\" or \"Virtual Network\" on the 192.168.1.1 page you use to configure your router :)\n\n*ifconfig on Host server will show its current local IP. Use nm-connection-editor to generate a Static IP address for this machine if it's not Static already.\n\n*Host server listens for SSH connection on Port listed in /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n", "Q: ACPI and Macbook Pro 5,3 Ubuntu 13.04 Found out that I can't use ACPI on my Macbook Pro 5,3 (2009) with Ubuntu 13.04. I tested it with the 3.6.x and 3.8.x kernels, and with nVidia drivers 310 (\"tested\" driver in \"Additional driver\") and 313 (also available in \"Additional drivers\").\nIf I boot with ACPI=off, the system runs good, but I can't go in suspend mode, the screen stays alive when I close the screen, and when I shut down the computer the process stops after the \"system halt\" message (and I'm forced to long-press the power button to shut it down once and for all).\nIf I boot with ACPI on (that is, I delete the \"ACPI=off\" in Grub2), I can manage the battery, I see it in Parametres > energy, but the system suddenly freezes after a minute of two, whatever I'm doing at the moment. I'm forced to long press the power button to reboot the system...\nAny idea how to fix it?\n\nA: Here is a workaround... It's not THE solution but at least it allows for a nice management of the battery and suspend/hibernate. The trick it to tell the system there's only ONE CPU instead of TWO. So that's not really a solution because the computer is a little bit less powerfull with only one CPU, but for the everyday life (browsing, editing images, watching stuff...) you won't see the difference.\nIn order to run with only one CPU, you have change your GRUB2 configuration file so that when the computer is booting, GRUB2 says to Ubuntu that there's one CPU to handle.\nIn order to do that, you have to edit the grub2 config file, update grub2, and then reboot.\n1 - Edit your GRUB2 config file.\nYou can do that with a terminal. Type sudo nano /etc/default/grub to open the config file. There is a line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"blah blah blah\", add the parameter MAXCPUS=1 (maximum CPUs is 1) and delete the parameter ACPI=OFF.\n\nSave the modification (Crtrl+O then press ENTER) and close the file (CTRL+X).\n2 - Update your GRUB\nStill in the terminal, just type update-grub and presse ENTER. \n3 - Reboot!\nYou can do that in the terminal with the command sudo reboot\nNow you should see the battery indicator in your menu bar and the battery management options in System Settings > Energy Saving.\n\nAdditionnaly, you can install the TLP utility that allows for a better battery management. You just have to install it and forget about it, it will tweak the power management for a longer battery life, see here for details: Is there a power saving application similar to Jupiter?\nLet's hope some update to come will allow for a good power management of the Macbook Pro 5,3...\n", "Q: How do I configure graphics? Please bear with me as I am a noob to linux. I recently installed Ubuntu into a virtual machine that I made with Oracle's VirtualBox, assigning the recommended RAM and storage.

The usual recommendation is to make swap space 1-2x your available RAM. The main reason for this is so that you can use the suspend-to-disk feature of the OS; when using this feature, RAM is copied to swap space, so swap space needs to be at least as large as your RAM. On most modern computers, swap is seldom used aside from this feature, so some users who don't use suspend-to-disk prefer to do without swap; however, I prefer to create it, since it gives you some insurance in case your memory use temporarily increases beyond normal limits.\n", "Q: Wifi doesn't work after suspend I have HP Pavilion DV7 6163-us and every time i put the computer to suspense or close the lid, then start it again, the wifi doesn't work.

If things go wrong try running qmake-qt4 instead.\nRunning\n./build/target/minitube\nA word about Phonon on Linux\nTo be able to actually watch videos you need a working Phonon setup.\n  Please don't contact me about this, ask for help on your distribution support channels.\nInstalling on Linux\nRun:\n     $ sudo make install\n  This is for packagers. End users should not install applications in this way.\n\nThe bold is simply because in the notes text file it has has marks for some reason. But to me this is very vague. I have the entire contents of the source file extracted into a \"minitube\" folder in my home dir. but I have tried running these qmake commands that are mentioned every way I can think of. And in every directory I can think of that makes sense. Still no use. And I'm not sure if I have the lastest version of Qt (4.5 or 4.6) installed as mentioned, not sure how to find out or how to upgrade as its not listed in my update manager.\nAny tips would be much appreciated.\nSide note, I have already ran the most recent version of Minitube previous to this one with no issues for a long time installed with simple apt-get from ppa. So I'm not sure what the issue is here.\nThank you and God Bless.\n\nA: I've never even heard of Minitube, but I have written some Qt, so I'll try to help.\nSince you're trying to build a Qt app, it may be advisable to just build the Qt source and link to that.  The latest version of Qt 4 is currently 4.8.5.  Download the tar ball for Linux/X11.  Follow the instructions here for building Qt for X11, very carefully.\nWhen that is finished, your dependency problems (Qt dependencies anyway) should be gone.  Now you can run qmake.  qmake should be ran in the same directory as the .pro file for the project.  qmake will then build you a Makefile based on the instructions in the .pro file.  You should not have to create this .pro file, but if you can't find one anywhere then sometimes Qt can generate one for you by running qmake -project.  Note that this is a last resort only if there is no .pro already.  The default .pro will work sometimes, but only for simple projects.  \nAfter qmake finishes generating the Makefile, run make by simply typing make.  After make finishes building the target, you can run the executable by typing (from same directory) ./build/target/minitube\nTo recap:\n\n\n*\n\n*Build and install Qt for X11\n\n*Run qmake in the directory of the .pro file, or run qmake -project to generate a .pro, then run qmake on the .pro\n\n*Run make\n\n*Run the app with ./build/target/minitube\n", "Q: Installing IDLE (using Python 3.3.2) in Ubuntu 12.04 I am trying to install the text editor IDLE using Python 3.3.2\nin Ubuntu 12.04, but from the Ubuntu Software Centre I have been told that there is no  package called idle-python 3.3 from current software sources.\nDoes this mean that it is not possible to install for Ubuntu 12.04?

My Ubuntu 13.04 after upgrade was unstable so I decided to make a clean install. When I went to install from bootable DVD I chose the Something else... option so I was able to manually set up my partitions. I selected the / partition of 80 GB and selected partition. I left the swap unchanged of 14 GB ( I have 8 GB RAM). When I selected the /home partition I didn't select partition because I wanted to keep my old home file system but now I have a strange organisation if I open the /home there is:\n\nmyUser -> this a clean home with no files just the default folders you get at start\n  home/myUser -> here is where all the old files are\n\nSo I was wondering if I could just copy the contents of the old home folder and paste them to replace the new home.\nI am having doubts because in the old home there are some folders from old programs. Will they create problems for the new system? will the old programs work? Should I copy only files and not the programs?\nFor now the new install has none of the original settings nor programs. Is there a way I could do this operation on command line and indicate that home folder is actually old home folder and delete the new home?\nI followed the instructions of this link Installing fresh Ubuntu 13.04 instead of Ubuntu 12.10\nso I thought my home folder would be kept and used as is but instead I have this weird setting.\n\nA: Options from the live CD\nWhen reinstalling on a system having only Ubuntu installed we have four options from the installer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall Ubuntu:\nthis will keep your settings and your home as much as possible. This means you will still have your personal files from HOME, and the settings from your applications there but you may have to reinstall applications you had installed before. It may also be that some setting from your root directory will be kept which in case of a broken installation may not be what we want (but it may be worth to try before we have to start from scratch).\n\n*Install alongside:\nthis will create a dual-boot with your previous installation (which may be quite confusing from the resulting boot menu).\n\n*Erase Ubuntu and reinstall:\nall of your data will be deleted. The hard drive(s) and all partitions on it will be deleted, reformatted and used for a new installation. In this case we need backups to be able to restore our personal data.\n\n*Something else:\nthis option lets you fine tune your partition, and will also let you define partitions to use for special purposes in your new installation.\n\nSomething else but keep HOME\nAs soon as the partitioner gparted opens it's window we are able to inspect the exiting partitions on our drive to select which ones to use for the new installation.\nBy default all used partitions are marked as \"do not use the partition\". After having selected a partition we may press \"Change...\" to edit this. The following window lets us define how to use the selected partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use as: choose the filesystem your existing HOME was on\n\n*Mount point: choose the mount point /home for your HOME partition\n\n\ndo not tick \"format\" to prevent from formatting (and deleting) your existing data\n\n\n*\n\n*repeat the above for mount points \\, \\swap or any other partitions you want to reuse.\n\n\nonly tick format on those partitions you really want to delete\n\nReuse an existing HOME partition\nIn case we had installed without choosing the mount point of our existing HOME we will create a new /home/ directory filled with default values for the newly created user.\nIf we then need to reuse the old HOME partition we have to make sure to mount it on boot. The steps are similar to how I outlined in my answer to the following question but without the copying bits:\n\n*\n\n*Move home folder to second drive\nBasically, you need to edit your /etc/fstab to mount the existing partition as /home. You also should delete (or better rename to be able to undo) the newly created empty /home of your new installation before you can use the previous HOME partition on the next reboot.\n\nTo avoid doing this when a user is logged in it is better to perform the above from a live session.\n\nThe advantage of keeping your old HOME partition is that all your data and all your application setting will be preserved.\nBut this also may be disadvantageous in case your broken installation came from bad user settings. These of course will then also be restored.\n", "Q: Why can't I open the \"root\" folder in Xubuntu? After I finished installing Xubuntu I tried opening the Folder \"Root\" which has a cross next to it (I didn't know what was that) I already know that Root is my hard drive so i opened it and I got this:\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: The /root folder is the home folder of the root user (the administrator). That is, you (as a normal user) cannot see the personal stuff of the administrator which is fine and is the right thing to happen. Now, the root partition is just /. I guess you just misinterpreted the meaning of the folder /root and the root partition /.\nThe root partition (and corresponding folder) is called /.

(It is preferable if you have the terminal maximized, so the output fits.)\nThis is also a good time to tell you that you can \"label\" your partitions in GParted (for example). This is just giving them names so it is easier to identify one another. You can only label a partition which is not in use, i. e., you would be able to label Ubuntu's partitions from Xubuntu, but not from Ubuntu itself.\n\nA: Run this command in a terminal:\nmount\n\nYou will get an output like this:\n/dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Touchpad Menu Gone I just got a new laptop (Asus g46) and have had several issues with it, odd since I've never had issue with Ubuntu and I've used it since 7.04. \nAnyway, my touchpad menu is gone in the Mouse and Touchpad menu, which is rather annoying because I'd like to have it disable while type so my palms don't click elsewhere, as well as re-enable scrolling since I can't do that anymore as well.\nThanks a bunch!\n\nA: My solution to disable the touchpad while tapping text is to add the following command in the startup utility, as a new entry, named as you wish: \nsyndaemon -k -i 2 -d &\nReboot and you should be able to type text with no more touchpad messing around with your palms.\n", "Q: What should I do at \"Installation Type\" step in the Ubuntu installation? I have put 12.04 onto a USB drive and I am attempting to install Ubuntu this way. I'm using Windows 8 (I upgraded from Windows 7 myself). I don't know what to do when I get to \"Installation Type\" step during the Ubuntu installation.\nI am given a box with 3 things:\ndev/sda\ndev/sda1  104mb   35mb                        {windows bootloader?}\n\ndev/sda2  1000000mb unknown                   {this is my hard drive}\n\nUnder the box are the following buttons: New Partition Table, Add, Change and Delete.\nAnd there is another section which says:\nDevice for bootloader\n\nsda  ATA Seagate    {this is my hard drive}\n\nsda1 Windows 8 bootloader\n\nsda2\n\nI want to dual-boot Windows 8 with Ubuntu without losing any of my Windows partition,\nis this possible?\n\nA: Realizing this thread is a little outdated, I came across it while seeking info on installing Ubuntu onto OS X and just wanted to close it up for the next person who might stumble across it.\nTo answer the question, when you get to the point in the process where you have to choose between overwriting your existing install (Windows or OS X), or \"something else\", choose \"install over existing\". The installer will advance to the next step and allow you to chose which partition or drive you wish to install Ubuntu onto.\nI just went through this with my MacBook and was stumped for a moment, but then I realized that no installer is just going to wipe your drive without asking for confirmation at least twice, it's something you really want to do.\nMaybe in future installers they might include a small note like \"You will be able to select where you want to install Ubuntu on the next screen.\"\n\nA: Your sda1 partition is an EFI partition. Don't erase it or you won't be able to boot Windows any more.\nTo install Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot into Windows. Via the Windows partitioning tools, reduce your Windows partition until it becomes, let's say 80GB for example.\n\n*Run the Ubuntu installer. It should now propose the \"Install alongside\" option. If it doesn't, choose the Something else option, and create 2 partitions (root and swap) in the free space, see this page for more info.\n\n\nA: You tried to install Ubuntu with a custom install am I right? Usually there is a window before that one with a few options, you might have clicked too quickly and gotten to that window.\nYou can set up Windows and Ubuntu to boot up side by side. If you exit the installer and re-enter it, and instead of choosing \"Something else\" there should be an option with a half black and half white circle saying to \"Install Ubuntu 12.4 LTS alongside Windows 8\". From there you can decide how big you want to make your Ubuntu partition, and your Windows things will not be touched.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu and upgrade Windows I'm running Windows 7 on my laptop.\nI'm going to upgrade to Windows 8 and also installing Ubuntu along side.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should I install Ubuntu to my SSD ?

(I have UEFI disabled, currently on Legacy boot so I guess the order does not matter?)\n\n*I have Intel Smart Storage Tech. (SSD cache) should I disable it when upgrade/install Ubuntu and Windows 8?\n\n\nA: I'm sure that you'll be able to install Ubuntu onto a solid state drive, given that it is large and fast enough, though performance has always been greater on HDD for me, why are you unable to create more partitions?\nI always install Linux second so that I can use GRUB to boot to both Linux, Windows 7 and Windows 8 (I installed the three alongside).\nI can't imagine you having problems with Intel SST though, if you do, feel free to return to the Askubuntu community with a new question! \nMake sure to mark any answers you deem acceptable as answered to keep the community going.\n\nA: I am using SSD i have installed windows 8 first then i have installed Ubuntu beside it\n\n", "Q: Notepad++ NppFTP alternative in linux I know there are questions about notepad++ here but mine is a bit different. I am developing a website and with the NppFTP plugin in Notepad++ I am able to directly connect to the server that contains the site I am working on. I am able to create/edit/delete pages/content etc. Is there something similiar in Linux. Any tool that will let me edit pages directly on the server. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Emacs and the Tramp extension does that and more.  It supports ssh, sftp and the old insecure ftp extension. And yes, it works like editing the file locally.  No need to anything extra installed.\nJust open the file like this in Emacs: C-x C-f /user@machine:/path/to/file\nBut if you are serious working with a website or something like that, you should use a version control system like git or subversion.  So when you want to put the data on the server, you just check it out from the repository into the server.  That allows you to make lots of tests, and always back upp to previous version if it doesn't work.  Even work on many different versions at the same time.\nYes, Emacs have good support for many different version controll systems too.\n\nA: Sublime text with Ftpsync plugin. https://github.com/NoxArt/SublimeText2-FTPSync or\nSublime SFTP(paid)\n2 Install curlftpfs and use this to mount ftp site locally.\nsudo apt-get install curlftpfs\n\nLet's say here's the detail\nMy ftp User: surendra_a\nMy ftp password: redhat\nMy ftp Server: ftp2.linuxnix.com\nMy mount point: /ftpmount\nNow create the mount point and mount ftp account data.\nmkdir /ftpmount\n curlftpfs -o allow_other surendra_a:redhat@ftp2.linuxnix.com /ftpmount\n\nThis way you can use any text editor.\nMore details here.\n\nA: Just use nautilus to connect to the server, then you can use any program that you like to edit those files.\nTo connect to the server, open the file manager (Nautilus), hit CTRL+L and type in the bar the server address (somthing like ftp://ftp.server.com). A window will open asking for an user name and a password. Afterwards the remote folder will appear on the left bar and you can use any program to save or edit files in it.\n\nA: You can use jEdit with the FTP plugin. \njEdit FTP Plugin description:\nThe FTP plugin plugs into jEdit's virtual filesystem to allow transparent access to \n(S)FTP servers. It integrates with the filesystem browser (hence you can do things like \nadd favorites which point to remote servers, and such), caches remote directory listings \nfor improved performance, remembers passwords, and has optional support for passive-mode \nFTP.\n\nIn addition, when running on Java 2 version 1.5, the FTP plugin can edit and browse files \nstored on SFTP servers.\n\njEdit Website\n", "Q: Ubuntu hanging almost constantly after changing NIC driver How I think it happened\nI recently tried to install a different driver on my network adapter because I thought that my ethernet port was causing problems - turned out it was my router and that nothing was wrong with my computer.\nSymptoms\nNow, my computer keeps hanging when I try to do anything, although System Monitor doesn't seem to register any kind of CPU usage. I'm not 100% sure that the network driver was the issue, but it was the last change I made.\nAlso, the \"Wired network disconnected\" message keeps popping up - but only in normal mode and when the computer is hanging.\nAnother strange thing is that if I start in safe graphics mode, the computer functions normally (most of the time). Also, the problem seems to be getting worse. The first couple of times it started hanging, I reset the machine and it was fine after that. Now I can barely get it to function normally.\nIt is also worth mentioning that the problem seems to have something to do with startup: if the computer isn't hanging after startup, it will be fine that entire session. If I restart, and it begins hanging, it will never stop.\nAre there any possible options for \"undoing\" whatever it was I did?

You can search for any answers having the word Psensor in them if you want to find out more about how to monitor your hardware temperatures. I don't think that overheating is your problem though, because it often causes crashing and your problem is freezing.\nWhat does often cause freezing is a failing graphics card. If your computer has a graphics card and you are fortunate enough to have a spare graphics card that you can temporarily swap with your GeForce GT 540M, then you can test this possibility for yourself.\nIf neither of these two possibilities proves to be the cause of your performance issues, then at least you will have narrowed down the range of possible causes of your performance issues.

The optical drive has been removed and I placed a second hard disk in its place using an adapter. I have Ubuntu 12.04 running on the primary hard drive which is a 256Gb SSD. On the secondary drive (in the optical drive position on the board) I have windows installed on a 450gb partition of a 1TB drive. The other partition is going to house my data such as music, photos, videos, movies, etc. Can anyone offer me any guidance on how I can choose what drive I am booting to? Do I need to have both operating systems installed on one drive? Or can I set up something that will allow me to choose which drive I want to boot to? Would this be done in windows or ubuntu? I looked through the bios settings to see if I could find anything. I can choose the boot priority but I can't choose which drive to boot to. When I go into the boot menu on the bios the again I only have the ability to choose hard drive. No option for which drive I want. Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: If you didn't install Ubuntu while your secondary drive with Windows was plugged in, GRUB didn't get a chance to recognize it and thus will only show Ubuntu in its menu.\nWith the Windows drive plugged in, on Ubuntu, try running sudo update-grub. If all goes well, the output should tell you that it found a Linux image (or multiple, it doesn't matter), and Windows 7 on your secondary disk (most probably /dev/sdbX, where X is a number, though it could be another letter).\nOnce it's done, reboot, and make sure the drive with Ubuntu installed is the first one in your boot order. You should then see the GRUB menu with an entry to boot Linux, and another to boot Windows.\nIf not, you may need to make sure GRUB is set to appear and not timeout too quickly. Type sudo nano /etc/default/grub (or any other editor you like, as long as you're sudo'ed), and make sure that both GRUB_TIMEOUT and GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT are greater than 0, and that GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET is set to false. Run sudo update-grub again and you should be good to go.\nAs an aside, most BIOS I know allow you to choose which disk to boot to for this boot only. Most of the time it's accomplished by pressing one of the function keys while the computer is booting. Mine is F12, but it can change depending on your BIOS. Of course, the option may not be present at all...\n", "Q: How do I disable the touchpad while typing on Macbook? I have a Macbook Pro 5.5 and I can't disable the touchpad while I'm typing.

My first guess is that a file needed to start the interface is located in a damaged disk sector. You can test that hypothesis with debugfs: Identifying file associated with unreadable disk sector (on gra2.com) is a good explanation how to do it. It's not straightforward, mind you, but maybe it would be worthwhile to get through the steps just to make sure the two phenomenons are really connected.\nIn short, you need two steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*convert the LBA (logical block address) of the bad block into the block address of the filesystem. LBAs are counted in different units than the filesystem block numbers, and start relative to the beginning of the disk, whereas the filesystem block numbers start at the partition start\n\n*once you have the filesystem block number, you can use debugfs to find the inode associated with that particular block. Hopefully you will find that (a) the file or files cannot be accessed and (b) have something to do with setting up the interface.\n\n\nThe above is not the remedy but forensics -- understanding what is going on.\nHowever, I'd suggest to first shut down the system, boot it from the CD and do all subsequent operations from the rescue system.

Can i prevent/restrict standard user from installing/uninstalling software in Ubuntu 12.04 desktop?\n\nA: You have asked a lot of similar questions.\nTo install software you either need to be root a special account which is locked by default or an administrator.\nIn 12.04 and later administrators are part of the group sudo in previous versions it was admin.\nYou can check what groups a user belongs to by typing id in a terminal when logged on as that user or id username replacing username with the name of that user.

To stop someone being an administrator just make sure they are not in the sudo or admin group.  To make someone an administrator add them to the sudo group.    \n\nA: Can you?  Anything's possible when you put enough resources at it.  You can make the partition the users launch from a read-only partition.  Pretty restrictive, but that would solve that problem.\nAlso, there are application whitelisting solutions for Linux.  Those will block installations.\nI think that the biggest question here is what you mean.

If you are not interested in some of the messages you need to filter it yourself by modifying appropriate script in one of /etc/cron.* (i.e. /etc/cron.daily/) directories.\nIf you don't want to see updates from /etc/cron.daily/ntpdate - edit the file and redirect standard output of command to /dev/null or better to a log file because you may want to check it in the future or do some custom filtering that would suite you. If you want to be notified about some erroneous conditions you should probably not redirect standard error stream, so it can be included in cron email report.\n\nA: Cron jobs (including Anacron's jobs) are standarised to report by email any output.\nFor commands like ntpdate which output when no errors occur, one can use cronic, which will suppress such output but still report by email on errors!\nCopy the cronic script from the link above to /usr/local/bin, check that it does only what it is supposed to do (for security reasons), and modify /etc/cron.daily/ntpdate prefixing /usr/local/bin/cronic to the ntpdate command.\n\nA: There are two settings in yum-cron to look out for in terms of emails:\n# Whether a message should be emitted when updates are available,\n# were downloaded, or applied.\nupdate_messages = no\n\n# Use this to filter Yum core messages\n# -4: critical\n# -3: critical+errors\n# -2: critical+errors+warnings (default)\ndebuglevel = -3\n\nWith update_messages yes, you'll almost always get emails.

Installed it at first time two days ago and suddenly got this problem. Writing my question from good old trouble-proof Windows XP (long live Microsoft).\nThe problem:\nXubuntu boots to command line instead of GUI. It prompts for a login and a password and after I provide I get a command line instead of Xubuntu.\nMostly people suggest to type:\nstartx \n\nin command line. But is it suitable for Xubuntu? Xubuntu uses Xfce, not GNOME. What do I need to type to start GUI from command line?\nWhy does this happen? How can I start GUI again? And what can I do to avoid it next time?\n\nA: So I managed to get GUI back without any command line typing. I did nothing, just hit Enter on Ubuntu option the next boot attempt. Just didn't let GRUB stopwatch to reach 0 and didn't use arrows in GRUB menu, just hit Enter. Very strange.\nFirst of all, I remember when it happened. I turned on the computer and left my room to do other things. Before it I always manually selected in GRUB menu what system to load, either Xubuntu or Windows. I never let GRUB stopwatch to reach 0 and boot itself, I always hit Enter earlier. So when I came back to computer I saw the command line prompt instead of GUI.\nI didn't know how to restart Xubuntu safely from the command line, so in this situation I just hit the restart button. The following boot I immediate used arrows in GRUB to go down the menu (up to Windows XP option) and then go up to select Ubuntu again. Just to stop GRUB stopwatch. Then hit Enter. But got command line again. I again reset the computer with the reset button.\nThis time I switched to Windows, surfed the Internet for answers, wrote this question. Found this 7 pages thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1570540. A user experienced the same problem in 2010. The main solution is on page six http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1570540&page=6&p=9935242#post9935242. So I did the same.\nI tried to boot again but this time I didn't use arrows. I just immediately hit Enter on Ubuntu option in GRUB. And I got GUI. Xubuntu is installed but GRUB's option is Ubuntu, not Xubuntu.\nXubuntu also fixed some crash when I entered GUI:\nexecution path:\n   usr/bin/Xorg\npackage:\n   xserver-xorg-core 2:1, 13,3 - Oubuntu6\nproblem type:\n   Crash\ntitle\n   Xorg crashed with SIGABRT in raise()\n\nSo my conclusion is: if you want Xubuntu, immediately hit Enter in GRUB menu. Don't let stopwatch to get 0 and don't use arrows. I you want Windows, choose a Windows option using arrows and hit Enter.

Thanks\n\nA: There will not be an official backport, but you can build unity from source.\nHere is a good link with some more information.\n", "Q: Service starts when called, but not on startup I wrote a simple upstart script that kicks off a python program, I have it saved as vgpusher.conf.\nIt doesn't start automatically, but if I run sudo start vgpusher it starts and runs just fine.\nThe code is simple:\ndescription \"vgpush\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nscript\n    cd /home/computer/\n    python pusher.py\nend script\n\nI placed the script in /etc/init. Other than that, I have done no configuration.\nThe machine is running Ubuntu 10.04 Server.\nDo I need to take an extra step for the service to start on startup?\n\nA: First, you don't need script:\ndescription \"vgpush\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nchdir /home/computer\nexec python pusher.py\n\nSecond, it may help to log the output. If you upgrade to 12.04 (Highly recommended!) you will have a log in /var/log/upstart/$jobname.log. For 10.04, you have to do it manually:\ndescription \"vgpush\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nchdir /home/computer\nexec python pusher.py 2>&1 >> /var/log/vgpush.log\n\nThat may give some clue. If I had to guess, it is because vgpush needs a network interface to be up that is not, and 10.04 starts runlevel 2 before all network interfaces are ready.\n\nA: When troubleshooting an upstart job, there are a few things to check.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the upstart job is correct. Yours looks pretty good, but I would suggest using the full path to the python executable ( /usr/bin/python ).\n\n*Check the upstart job log. there is a log file for each job at /var/log/upstart/.log It's possible that your job is starting and failing for some reason (maybe pusher.py needs the network to be up) and this log file will probably have information on that. At the least, it will at least show if the job is trying to start.\n", "Q: Add file to set screen size on Xorg I recently installed Ubuntu on my new Chromebook Pixel and I'm trying to get the resolution right.

TCP/IP can comunicate machines on the same network.\nChange the address in the Ubuntu computer to some address like 192.168.1.x (where x < 254 and x > 0), netmask 255.255.255.0 (or /24) and gateway 192.168.1.254\nIf the router has a dhcp server activated you can define network address as DHCP in network manager\n\nA: From the comments, you've mentioned that your router is 192.168.1.254, so let's do some changes.

If you get a response, great!\nWe'll need to make these changes permanent. Your machine is configured with static IP settings, so we'll need to change that. Do sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces; this will open up that file in a text editor in the terminal. Look for something like this:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n\nIf it does look like that, then delete all the , and change the second line to iface eth0 inet dhcp.

Will I be able to mount and access it under a new installed Ubuntu?\n\nA: With ecryptfs your files are not actually in /home/janos but in subdirectories under /home/.ecryptfs/janos (assuming your username is janos).\nMake sure you safe anything in this subdirectory!\nThose files are also visible under Windows (though the filenames are garbled because of the encryption).\nConsidering this detail the answer is positive: You will be able to use these files in a newly installed Ubuntu.\nIt might become necessary to adjust the userid and permissions after replaying the backup (as Windows cannot store those natively) but the encrypted content is not damaged by backing up the encrypted files in Windows. Also no files outside of the /home/.ecryptfs directory are vital to the encryption.\nJust make sure you configure your newly installed Ubuntu for using encrypted homes and just to be sure see to it, that the user in the new installation uses the same password as in the previous one.\n", "Q: Thunderbird Address Book Error On Start When I start Thunderbird (Version 17.0.7) in Ubuntu 13.04 I get the following notification - \n\nAny thoughts on what I can do to fix this?\nThanks\nUpdate for Bob\nHere are my installed add-ons, I believe it is all default except for adblock\n\n\nA: As far as I remember, address book named personal is made from EDS.

On the other hand, you should have an other address book named Personal Address Book which is the \"working\" address book.\nUpdate: Since this does not solve the problem, I propose to try and create an empty profile:\nstart TB with profile manager in terminal:\n\nthunderbird -profilemanager\n\nThen create a new profile. In next screen give a name to the new profile and locate the folder for the profile. There you can point to new folder and then import any data from old profile you wish. But at this point, the problem of the EDS address book (personal) should be solved because it should be repopulated.\nYou can actually make more than one profiles for backing up purposes. \nThe address book file is located in your profile folder and is named abook.mab.

I thought the non-X11 alternative was setterm and I've tried (as root) the following:\nsetterm -powersave powerdown > /dev/tty1\n\nto set the DPMS state when the screen is blanked. However, I get the following error:\nsetterm: cannot (un)set powersave mode: Invalid argument\n\nI get a similar error on other Ubuntu installs on different hardware and for any variation on the -powersave options listed in man setterm.\nWhy am I getting this error?

I'm running a slightly modified community-supplied version of 12.04.02 server.\nThis modified version comes with a driver which provides sysfs screen control, including a writeable psuedo-file to supposedly switch off the backlight, but you can still see it glowing in a darkened room. I'm hoping there will be a way to power it down completely.\n\nA: The source of the error turns out to be that the setterm command is picky about what can be redirected and what cannot. You can do this:\nsetterm -clear all > /dev/tty1\n\nfrom an SSH session to clear the physical console, but you cannot issue any -powerdown commands in the same way. I don't know why this is.\nFor the record, issuing setterm -powersave powerdown from the console is accepted, but does not appear to be doing what I want for my hardware - there's no apparent difference to just setting the brightness to zero (there's still a faint light from the screen in a dark room).\n", "Q: Cant Install anything on Ubuntu 12.04 after power failure I was installing Google Earth from a package, and my power went out in mid-way. \nWhen I power on my computer a pop up comes saying system problem detected.

I already have 64 bit Ubuntu but need 32 bit for a specific program that I need to run. I have tried Startup Disk Creator on Ubuntu, and tried several methods on OS X but none of them create a disl that will show in the boot options. I tried Penguintosh and that got it to show up and it booted as far as the starting kernel message but then it hung there for hours. I have tried redownloading, and as I said multiple methods of creating the boot disk. I've been trying to make this live usb for almost a week now lol. I don't have CD's. Any suggestions?\n\nA: The 32 bit image is for bios based PCs only.  You can install 32 bit apps on a 64 bit system.\n", "Q: Workflow with self made packages I have a folder ~/Packaging where all my public and private packages are in. For example, in the Packaging/think-rotate folder, there is the typical Debian stuff, like so:\nthink-rotate-2.5.2/\nthink-rotate-2.5.2.orig/\nthink-rotate-2.6/\nthink-rotate-2.6.orig/\nthink-rotate_1.0.tar.gz\nthink-rotate_2.5.2-0ubuntu1.debian.tar.gz\nthink-rotate_2.5.2-0ubuntu1.dsc\nthink-rotate_2.5.2-0ubuntu1_source.build\nthink-rotate_2.5.2-0ubuntu1_source.changes\nthink-rotate_2.5.2.orig.tar.gz@\nthink-rotate_2.5.2.tar.gz\nthink-rotate_2.5.orig.tar.gz@\nthink-rotate_2.5.tar.gz\nthink-rotate_2.6-0ubuntu1_all.deb\nthink-rotate_2.6-0ubuntu1_amd64.build\nthink-rotate_2.6-0ubuntu1_amd64.changes\nthink-rotate_2.6-0ubuntu1.debian.tar.gz\nthink-rotate_2.6-0ubuntu1.dsc\nthink-rotate_2.6-0ubuntu1_source.build\nthink-rotate_2.6-0ubuntu1_source.changes\nthink-rotate_2.6-0ubuntu1_source.stable.upload\nthink-rotate_2.6.orig.tar.gz@\nthink-rotate_2.6.tar.gz\n\nI have some script that goes through my projects and generates the latest .tar.gz from my source code. So for the matter of this question, new tar archieves pop up in the packaging directory every now and then.\nSince I do not want to run uupdate ../….tar.gz on every project by hand, I wrote a Python 3 script which takes care of that, runs debuild -S and dput to upload it to my Launchpad PPA, and then debuild to build it for my local machine.\nThe Debian changelog is just populated with the default “New upstream release” message. Those packages are more for organized local deployment, than for the general public.\nThe script then also uses apt-cache show to check whether the latest version is installed, and if not, uses dpkg -i to install that package.\nThis works somewhat, but I encountered a couple problems with my current version of that script:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I upgrade my machine to a new Ubuntu version, it does not rebuild everything. So I have a lot of packages that did not receive any upstream updates, and the latest version in my PPA is quantal, not raring.\n\n*Packages are build for amd64 on my main computer, and often cannot be installed on my other computer, which has i686. Some packages are all, so that does not hurt. But I would need to rebuild the any packages on that machine. The Launchpad PPA takes care of building it for every architecture, but my script did not upload that package for raring, see first problem.\nTo summarize, the workflow has to contain all those steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Extract new source tar archive and update the debian/changelog. (uupdate)\n\n*If not already uploaded to PPA, build a source package and upload it to the Launchpad PPA. But only do this, if this is public package, do not upload my private packages to the PPA. (debuild -S and dput)\n\n*If the package needs to be upgraded locally, build a binary package for the current architecture and install it. (debuild and debi or dpgk -i)\n\n*Check if the series is outdated, i. e. the latest upload was for quantal, and the current system runs on raring. If so, rebuild the source again and upload to PPA.\nBefore you say that I should work on every package by hand, keep in mind that I have 43 packages sitting around, and I would really like to save work here.\nI could work on my script to work around the current problems, but I'd rather use something that already works instead of rolling my own. Is there some tookchain or workflow that maintainers use in order to keep so many packages up to date in their PPAs or official repositories?\n\nUpdate 2013-07-08: I now worked on the script to handle the problems as well. But I am still interested in a canonical solution.\n\nA: I maintain quite a few packages at work, so let me give you my personal perspective on this.\nAll your stuff should be built in one central location, for all the distributions and architectures that you need.  Do not upload source packages, and then build again locally.  Pick your \"private\" packages from the build server where you host everything.  That way, you can keep your private repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list with all the others (password protect them if needed).\nIf Launchpad does not work for you, set up your own build system.  Since you have a lot of packages (over 40), setting up a build environment tailored to your special needs will pay off sooner or later.\nYou will need a dedicated machine with network access for that – either in your home or at work or a rented server in a datacenter.\nHere are two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Jenkins CI and build script to do the package building.  There is Jenkins Debian Glue by Michael Prokop, which does the job and it's well documented (I ended up rewriting it from scratch, but it might work for you).  It's 100% shell code, so be prepared to do some Bash scripting if you need to tweak it.\nWith this, you'll be able to build all your packages for all the combinations of dists and arches that you desire.  Jenkins is wonderfully flexible and ROCK stable, and it will be easy enough to compartmentalize your repositories (for private and public consumption).\n\n*Use Buildbot – this is going to be more manual work than option one, but Buildbot is a Python project, and from your question I assume that you will feel at home setting that up.  The i3 (window manager) project has an excellent description of how they set up their Buildbot environment, use that as a starting point.\nI also strongly recommend sbuild over pbuilder.  Jenkins Debian Glue uses pbuilder (one of the reasons why I ended up discarding it).\nIn any case, you will need to do some things that you did not have to, so far, such as setting up package repositories (which can be pretty painful) and maintaining a build server.  At the end of the time, it will be worth it, though – and you will learn a lot.\n", "Q: Ubuntu randomly change resolution by itself to 1024x768 I'm running 13.04 on an IBM machine with integrated intel graphics on a 1920x1080 monitor.\nWhen I boot up, the resolution is fine for a couple of seconds and then the screen goes black, and the display change to 1024x768 resolution. \nI am able to temporally fix the issue by just opening the display setting screen and (very stragely) the screen comes back to my 1920x1080 optimal resolution.

Is there a way I could install it alongside Windows 8 64 bit?\nI recently had Windows 7 on this same machine and I updated Windows later. At that time, I could easily install Ubuntu along side Windows 7.\nNeed some help on this guys.\n\nA: The short answer depends if you have UEFI or not.

They only change when you format a partition. [post number 3 in the linked discussion]\nThe disk might have been replaced due to several possible reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*SMART values have been deteriorating and to prevent loss of data on the respective disk it was cloned and replaced\n\n*disk was filling up and was replaced by a bigger one with same partition layout\n\n*disk was replaced due to speed reasons, e.g. HDD --> SSD\n\n*disk was replaced to obtain the original disk with it's data - for example as backup or evidence - but leave the system running.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Dual boot install I have a 64-bit Win7 laptop and I would like to try Ubuntu with dual-boot option. Can I install Ubuntu on a sd or flash drive and have everything related to Ubuntu including programs, apps, etc on that drive instead of on my harddrive and still have dual-boot?\n\nA: Yes and no. Yes you can have a partually functional portable linux install on an sd card or usb drive. No that install won't be like a regular dual boot due to 3 main reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*SD cards and all usb's except 3.0 are slower than any sata interface so the os will run slower\n\n*Due to the fact that it's installed on an SD card you cannot have the regular GRUB bootloader just give you a choice of what to boot in , instead you will have to select in bios to boot from usb or sd card.\n\n*When you install linux on an SD card or USB you cannot use the actual installer because as far as i know you can't just boot your pc from ubuntu cd with a usb plugged in and expect to see the usb in the installer(not sure for the latest versions could actually be possible) , you will have to use unetbootin or similar which will make a live cd not an actual install  and will limit the amount of changes you can do to this by making a live cache and this live cache will limit the changes you do eg. installing stuff because the purpose of a live cd is to give you a short demonstration of the os and a few features to play with  and let you install the os , not be the os.\nApart from that it will work\n\nA: Well running Ubuntu on a SD card is very slow. You won't get anywhere near SSD performance.  Its due to the read/write speed limitations of SD cards.  Now installing on a USB flash drive would give better, performance.\nMake sure that you do it with 8GB flash drive.  4GB for /,4GB for /home and SWAP. You can create partitions during installation.  Keep in mind that USB 2.0 is some what slow, you should consider using a USB 3.0 fast flash drive if your PC has USB 3.0 capability.\nNow for installing programs on the flash drive, depending on what, and how many apps you need, maybe you should consider a larger USB.\nYou may want to look at Live Usb Pendrive Persistent\n", "Q: Hyperlinks clicked in evince document viewer are not opening, any ideas on how to fix?

If you are using it for browsing the web and coding, you should expect 7-8 hours, maybe a little less. This is because Ubuntu uses more power than Windows. The drivers on the computer are designed to work with Windows, and so when you use Ubuntu, not all of them are used and this takes up power. If you are concerned with battery life, take a look at some power saving tweaks here. \nA tool I have used to improve Ubuntu's battery life is Jupiter. I find that it is really nice because it changes some parameters and settings on your computer based on whether your computer is on battery power or is connected to a power source.\nTo install it, open up Terminal in Ubuntu (Dash -> Search for Terminal) and use the following code:\n    sudo add-apt repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install jupiter\n\nYou can also try powertop.

I stumbled on this web page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sogfl/?source=navbar\nHow do I install the downloaded file called sogfl_v0.1.0.1.tar.bz2 in Ubuntu?\nSome help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T should work), then cd to the directory to which you have downloaded the file (you should move the .tar.bz2 file into some empty directory):\nmkdir -p ~/Apps/OpenVPN-gui\nmv ~/Downloads/sogfl_v0.1.0.1.tar.bz2 ~/Apps/OpenVPN-gui/\ncd ~/Apps/OpenVPN-gui/\n\nThen you have to unpack it, it can be done by this command\nbzcat sogfl_v0.1.0.1.tar.bz2 | tar x\n\nThen you can see many files, i.e. README in this case so do cat README and see, that there is written to do typical configure & make & make install dance:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nNote: There's probably a mistake in the README file - make and make install should be without ./ and if you're not root user, you probably will need do make install with sudo.\nThis is the way how to install most of the source tarballs.

I can run the title function fine from the command line. Regardless of what I do, the title function doesn't run when I run my script file. There's no error, just no change to the title. What am I doing wrong?  \nA bit more info: I added an echo 'changing title' line in the title function. The echo is being output but the title isn't being changed. So there must be a problem with the title function? \nRelated: How to change Gnome-Terminal title?\n\nA: If you need to change the title of the terminal, I'd advise you to use wmctrl that will also work from within a script (in fact, your solution fails because the prompt is not used when running scripts). So, first install the wmctrl package, e.g., using apt:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nThe nice thin with bash is that it has a variable named WINDOWID that contains a window id (no kidding!) that wmctrl can use. From within Bash or from within a script, try:\nwmctrl -ir $WINDOWID -N \"A cool title\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The -i option is to tell wmctrl that the window will be specified using its numerical id (do echo $WINDOWID to check that WINDOWID is indeed a number, and do wmctrl -l to list all the windows managed by your window manager and compare... you'll probably have to convert from decimal to hexadecimal or maybe use printf '%#.8x\\n' \"$WINDOWID\").\n\n*The -r option is to tell wmctrl that the specified window will be ready for the following action, i.e., -N, change its title to the specified title.\n\n\nman wmctrl for more info about this funny little tool.\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: 13.04 PPTP VNP to Windows Server but NO Internet I am currently running on an Ubuntu 13.04 environment.\nI am able to connect just fine to my Office VPN, the only problem I am having now is I don't have internet access once I am connected.

When I try to boot, I get a message \"SYSLINUX 4.06 EDD 2012-10-23 copyright (C) 1994-2012 H. Peter Anvin et al\"\nThe next line has a blinking underscore.  It will not allow me to enter anything.\nWhat do I do?\nDid I try to use the wrong version Linux?\nIf so, what should I use?  \nI don't care which version from 12.04 - 13.04 I load.  I couldeven use an earlier version if it will work.  I just want it to boot, so I can install linux as the only OS on this machine.\n\nA: First, you can re-install the live usb using the same version (Ubuntu 13.04), although I'd suggest using Ubuntu 12.4.2 if you will be using it for a long time. \nSome things to consider. Is your hardware / BIOS set to use UEFI?\nIf so, change it in the BIOS settings and / or select the proper way to mount the USB via the BIOS boot selection. \nHave you set the bios to boot from the USB?\nThis also can be done via the BIOS settings.\nAs long as the version you are trying to use is listed on the Universal USB Installer, everything should work on that end. Re-install it on the USB and give it another go. \nAlso, check out the answers on the possible duplicate tag above. \n\nA: I also have an inspiron 600m.\nUnfortunately I didn't have the same problem, so I can't help you directly. But I can tell you that the newer versions of Ubuntu will not work on this machine: They require something called PAE, which your computer processor does not support.\nMy solution to this problem was to finally buy a new laptop (after waiting 7 years). This is what I purchased, if you're interested - it's cheap and lightweight, and comes with Ubuntu preinstalled.\nThe 12.04 version of Ubuntu (I'd reccomend either Xubuntu or Lubuntu) should work on your machine, and should be supported until March 2014, but won't be supported after that. You could try installing a different linux distribution that still supports non-PAE hardware, such as Debian.\n", "Q: Making a Network Drive Faster To Access I have mounted a 450 GB Logical Volume in Ubuntu and I am sharing it over the network using Samba. On my Mac, I am able to connect to the shared folder and mount the volume; however, it takes minutes for me to see all of my files, which consist of music and photos. Is there any way to speed up this process? I know that Windows 7, for example, can index drives, but would this work even if the server is turned off and on again? My Ubuntu server is using ethernet.\n\nA: In /etc/samba/smb.conf on the server, check that the socket options line is:\n   socket options = TCP_NODELAY\n\nNote that adding SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF may speed things up for Linux<>Linux communication but can have some bad slowdowns for Windows or other OS that connect to the share.\nAs another troubleshooting step, try connecting to the share not by its name (netbios or DNS) but by its IP address (eg. 192.168.0.2).  If this works fine you have something going weird with name resolution, which is a black art (more here).\n", "Q: GRUB installed on /dev/sda1, \"no such partition\" after image restoration My partition setup is:\n[Win7] [Ubuntu] [extended [logical partition]] (in that exact order)\nThe bootloader installed in the MBR is a non-standard one that allows you to chainload a secondary bootloader on another partition.

I recommend this if you are using these for personal use (or school), but probably not for enterprise.\n\n*Download VMWare Player from here.  If you will be doing a lot VM management/hacking or if you are in an enterprise environment, you may want to start here and then upgrade to fancier VMWare offerings later.  VMWare has cool options like VMWare View Client where you can drive a VM that is running on a server from any thin client (like a laptop or even Android phone).

It works great (my belkin micro-n adapter quit on me) for now, but the laptop is so hot, just sitting there burning energy. I would like to shut it down to it's lowest powered state while keeping the connection alive. Any thoughts?\n\nA: You can't power down your Laptop in this case.\nAs mentioned in the comments to your question, this task cannot be done without an operating system (on normal pcs/laptops) and therefore involve your CPU. The only thing you can power down is your screen, but that will not make your Laptop significantly cooler. Except you somehow deactivate your graphics card which you should not do if you do not know linux as good as your own room. Also it's not assured this will solve your problem.\nSo really, there is no mode or option that will save power in such significant values. If you still want to try, there are several questions on askubuntu about power saving. Just try the search on the top (on the right side). Those can extend battery life and maybe help a little. I can recommend \"Jupiter\" to do this as it's really user friendly. But do not expect too much.\nIf this is the only thing your laptop is doing, it's a bit strange it's getting hot. Check whether your laptop fans are running (you'll find help on the fans here on askubuntu, just try the search bar). Also you could look in the system monitor what is causing your CPU to get busy/hot.\nLong term solution: a router or wlan access point\nSuch devices are specialized to this activity and do not consume as much energy as a laptop. They can run 24/7 without problems. This is also a very easy and relatively cheap solution.\n", "Q: Grub Rescue error Ubuntu 13.04 Dual Boot i'm a newbie to Linux and had install Ubuntu 12.10 dual booted with Windows8. But the ubuntu several times showed some wierd kind of errors (which I've never heard of, like it got hanged and freezed). So I decided to upgrade to 13.04.\nWhat I did: I wanted to increase the space allocated for the disk on which ubuntu was installed, so I shrinked one disk (using Windows Partion Manager) and deleted the one in which Ubuntu(12.10) was installed.\nSo when I restarted it, it showed \"Grub rescue\" kind of error.

I am using them in portrait mode so each resolution is 1080x1920.\nI have a video which is 2360x1920 i.e. (1080p+200p+1080p)x1920p.\nI want to run the video fullscreen, and cut the 200x1920p part in the middle. Is there anyway I can modify my xorg.conf to do this ?\nTL;DR - multimonitor setup, wants to increase horizontal resolution of Monitor 1, the \"increased\" part of the resolution needs to be cutoff (not displayed in screen/hidden).\nIs there anyway I can achieve this ?\nThank you.\nEDIT- Here is an image demonstrating the setup - \n\nA: You can use xrandr for this.\nFirst, run it in a terminal to show your display names. You will see each with a resolution and offset (e.g. on my setup, I have a primary display, VGA1, at 1920x1080+0+0 and LVDS1 at 1600x900+1920+180). The + numbers define the coordinates of the top left of each screen, relative to the top left corner of the primary output (where positive X is right, and positive Y is downwards)\nThe command for changing the start point of an output is xrandr --output <name> --pos <X>x<Y> - so with my example, if I wanted to add a 200px offset in between my monitors (a dead zone, essentially, as you describe), the command would be xrandr --output LVDS1 --pos 2120x180 - this would add 200 pixels to the current offset of LVDS1 (in your case it would be --pos 1280x0, but you will need to find the output name from xrandr)\nThis will only change the setting for your current session; to make this change permanent add it to your ~/.xprofile if it exists; or if it doesn't, create a text file ~/.xprofile and add that line to it.\n", "Q: Will ubuntu import all important files? This is actually a question for later when Ubuntu 13.10 comes out but I couldn't wait... I am asking when ever you upgrade to Ubuntu 13.10 or any version will all your important files transfer? I am still a bit new to Ubuntu and I started out with Ubuntu 13.04 so I am a very new ubuntu-er. \n\nA: Usually whenever you upgrade an existing installation all the files you keep in the /home directories will be kept untouched. This includes not only your personal documents, but also application settings, desktop appearance, e-mail accounts, browser preferences and history.\nBut note the word \"usually\" above. There never is a guarantee that it will work in 100% of cases (imagine a power failure during upgrade...). \nIt is therefore best advice to\n\nBackup all data in your home directory\n\nprior to a distribution release upgrade. I always do that.\n\nA: As long as nothing in your home directory is removed or damaged, most apps will usually do a best-effort attempt to use the configuration and data under it.\nThe OS itself doesn't care about home directories, usually only /etc. Those files are usually a little more flexible, but it will still try to a certain extent.\n", "Q: GUI for Server Editions I'm developing a Photo sharing app so that I can seamlessly upload to my photos to my Home Computer even when I'm too much far from my Home.\nFor this purpose I'm planning to setup my own Home server using PostgreSQL and Glassfish because I only know C and Java.\nThe question is that is there any GUI available for Ubuntu 12.04 Server Edition so that I can easily manage these stuffs? I never used a server environment before.\n\nA: Any desktop environment available for Ubuntu is available on the server edition of Ubuntu and can be installed as any other package with apt-get.\nubuntu-desktop will install the default Unity desktop, kde-desktop will install the Kubuntu KDE desktop, lubuntu-desktop will install the LXDE packages of the Lubuntu release and xfce-desktop the Xubuntu desktop environment.\nAny of those will work for you, but there are other more \"light\" options. Please check the appropriate ubuntu wiki page for GUI setup in a server environment.\n\nA: For this type of server, where you actually want a GUI, I'd recommend just using the desktop edition and then installing the services you need.

It also indicates that in my custom keyboard layout is correct on the key that I want:  for the z key I have mapped 'З' (pronounced \"ze\") and for Alt-Gr + z I have mapped 'Ж' ('zhe').  This information shows up in the onscreen keyboard.  However, trying this key combination produces no text on the first press, and on subsequent (joint / combo) presses, this produces only the non-altered 'З', same as I'm expecting from the non-combo z press only.\nIn summary, the Compose key is mapped correctly, and the character I want is mapped correctly (all 4 options (2 letters each with upper and lower case) appear in the onscreen keyboard), but the combination does nothing (on first press) and then the non-altered thing subsequently.\nThis is what my \\usr\\share\\X11\\xkb\\symbols\\ru file looks like:\n[...]\nkey <AB10> { [ U0417, U0437, U0416, U0436    ]   };\nAccording to the documentation I've seen, the first two entries should be produced by pressing the z key and shift + z respectively (I'm working in Dvorak, so that's the key just to the left of the right-shift key), and the last two should be produced with the Compose + z and shift + Compose + z respectively.  But, as mentioned, the actual behaviour I'm getting with Alt-Gr is nothing and then the default z and shift+z behaviour only.\n\nA: I think this is what you're looking for:\n\nChoose your current keyboard layout:\n\n\n\nA: You have modified \\usr\\share\\X11\\xkb\\symbols\\ru to follow a Dvorak layout, and you have modifed the key <AB10> section within the name[Group1]= \"Russian\" section by adding 2 additional keys.\nExtra keys that are defined in the keyboard layout file in this way are not Compose key sequences. These keys are 3rd/4th-level keys. \nIn order to reach Ж that you defined in key <AB10>, you need to use a 3rd level chooser rather than the compose key. The 4th-level key is reached with 3rd-level-chooser+Shift\nIn the Keyboard Layout Options dialog, open Key to choose 3rd level, and choose whatever key works best for you.\nI modified my Russian keyboard with the changes you indicate, set menu as the 3rd level chooser and menu+key-to-left-of-right-shift now correctly inserts Ж.\nI chose menu because I never use it otherwise, and because I prefer Right-Alt as the Compose key. \nThe main point here is that the same key can't serve as both the Compose key and the 3rd level chooser. The system won't complain, but the 3rd level setting will have no effect. \nIf you prefer Right-Alt as the 3rd level chooser, be sure to select something else for the Compose key. When trying out different combinations, sometimes I've had to logout out before they took effect.\n(Btw, you seem to have the capital/small letters in the swapped positions, unless that is what you want.)\n", "Q: How do I hide GRUB entries?

All I want are two entries: one for Ubuntu, and one for Windows. I'd also like to be able to rename them, since the entry for Windows 8 has a name that doesn't make any sense.\n\nA: First try grub-customizer, see this answer, but you should know that grub-customizer has some issues with the newest grub-2.00. \nIf you like the manual editing way, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run \ngksudo /etc/grub.d/40_custom && gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nHere you will create YOUR custom grub entries. If you have another Linux system (Windows no matters), then you must update these custom entries by hand every time a new kernel arrives in the other Linux system (not Ubuntu). \nNow you must have two documents opened, the one (40_custom) is opened with root privileges. \nEach entry begins with \nmenuentry \n\nand ends with this symbol  } \nCopy paste the entries you want from grub.cfg to 40_custom . Not Ubuntu's entries. Only the entries from ### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ### and below. \nWhen done, save the 40_custom document. \nRun in terminal \nsudo chmod 644 /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/grub.d/40_custom \nsudo update-grub \n\nAbove commands will remove the execute permissions from 30_os-prober (that scans for other Operating Systems and add the entries) and will give execute permissions to your custom script (40_custom). Last command will update grub with the new values. \nCheck the new values with \ncat /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nAbove method is a bit tricky and dangerous. You should edit the files very carefully because you may wind up with a corrupted grub menu or no menu at all. \nIf that's the case, you have to use boot-repair from a Live media to restore grub.\nMore grub tips and tricks can be found in Ubuntu Wiki/Grub2, for custom menus look here.\nGood Luck \n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch the first phones I am a web-developer and I really love Ubuntu.

Right now, in development, the official reference models are Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 4. You'll be able to install Ubuntu Phone on either of those, but keep in mind it's not meant to be ready for the public yet – and it will require you to unlock the phone. \nAs of now, there are no official statements from hardware manufacturers intending to ship Ubuntu Phone on their devices by default. Because of that, it's impossible to say anything about prices, or when to expect them. I would, however, not expect any phones to hit the market until spring/summmer 2014. After all, that's when the next LTS is released, and I would assume that hardware manufacturers would want long-term support for their devices. That is pure speculation, of course. \n\nA: As of now (July 2015) there are three devices available to the general public with Ubuntu Touch already installed. \nYou can find a list including features and pricing here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/phone/devices\n", "Q: Dual Boot 64 bit Windos 7 and Ubuntu 64 bit Windows 7 is in the machine.

If these aren't available, but rather a *.tar.* file, you should be able to find precise instructions on site as to how they should be installed.\nIf you find *.zip archives, there will either be a binary file (an executable, usually no file extension but marked differently in nautilus, the default document explorer) or a shell script (*.sh) inside. These can be run via double clicking them in the GUI (nautilus) - perhaps you might need to check the \"allow execution\" box in the file properties. If you cannot find such a file, consult the README.\n\nThat said ...\nAs for lampp (which is the Linux version of xampp), follow precisely these instructions. Only then will it work (and, in fact, that might still need some tweaks due to the new security manifest).\nFor Spotify, you can follow these instructions.\nAnd for the Flash Player you can use this guide.\n\nA: Installing Spotify Preview\nThis is just try clear up a bit of confusion with the instructions Spotify gives.\nPress CTRL+ALT+T to open terminal. Type\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nto open the file /etc/apt/sources.list in the text editor (type your password when prompted). Add the line\ndeb http://repository.spotify.com stable non-free\n\nto the bottom of the file, save and close the text editor. Now back in terminal, type the following lines individually:\n    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 94558F59\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install spotify-client\n\nThis should install Spotify.\nAs for everything else you wish to install, I would suggest you submit a question about each thing individually (if you cannot already find the answer) and it will be easier to provide answers. Each thing on it's own should be quite easy to install and you will learn from examples, but it's difficult to give a general guide (although @FEichinger 's guide in the other answer does a good job)\n", "Q: I'm having a difficulty in the application intalled menu How can I see all the installed application collectively except the default ones\nIf there's not, please make one because it's hard to know if its a default or a installed one.

You should be able to select your boot device in BIOS or EFI. You cannot install Windows by using PlayOnLinux.\nAlthough it is possible to install Windows after Ubuntu and get dual boot working (search askubuntu, there are probably guides for this), if you don't loose to much, I'd recommend to first install Windows and Ubuntu afterwards.

Is this the proper way to do this?\n\nA: replace localhost by your hostname or use ALL if your sudoers file is not dispatched on other hosts\nanthony ALL= (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/myscript\n\nedit:\nScripts can be tricked by environment parameters. It is more secure (and easier to use) to sudo the killall command into your script than to sudo the script itself.

Eventually it will stop copying and I can remove the drive successfully but the question is why doesn't dd command wait for copying to finish. Why does it run in background. And how can I make it wait?\n\nA: Despite popular belief, dd is a perfectly ordinary command, it isn't more low-level than cat or cp. Your command reads from the disk cache and writes to the disk buffers like any other command.\nIn order to make sure that the data is fully written to the physical media, you need to call sync. The command sync flushes all output buffers to the disk(s). When the sync command returns, the data has been fully written¹.\nsudo dd if=~/Desktop/ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=1M; sync\n\nMost of the time, you don't need to call sync, because unmounting a filesystem does the same job. When the umount command returns, or when you get a confirmation message after clicking “Eject”, the buffers have been written to the disk. Here, you're directly writing to the disk without going through a mounted filesystem, so you need to explicitly flush the buffer.\nNote that instead of dd, you could use tee. This has two advantages: there's less risk of inverting the source and destination due to a typo, and it's probably slightly faster.\n<~/Desktop/ubuntu.iso sudo tee /dev/sdx >/dev/null; sync\n\n¹  At least on a “normal” Ubuntu system, or more generally Linux. This may not be true on other Unix-like systems or if Linux is running in a virtual environment (Cygwin, WSL, virtual machine, …). In a virtual environment, flushing writes to persistent storage may require the cooperation of the host system. \n\nA: Try this:\nsudo dd if=~/Desktop/ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdx conv=fdatasync bs=1m\n\nThe conv=fdatasync tells dd to use the special options to make sure that the data get written to the physical device. \n", "Q: How to install the google play lens on 13.04 I've tried following the instructions from, \n \"http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/11/new-lens-lets-you-search-google-play-from-the-         unity-dash\". \n\nThe first command,\n \"sudo add-apt-repository ppa:abhshk-btra/rotatingcanvas\"\n\nadds the repository and returns successfully.\nThe second command,\n \"sudo apt-get update\"\n\nfails with,\n\"W: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/abhshk-btra/rotatingcanvas/ubuntu/dists/raring/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\nE: Some index files failed to download.

Auto-hiding the application menu in Unity makes no sense to me.  It slows me down because instead of automatically moving the cursor to the appropriate menu item I have to look for it then remember that it is hidden and move my cursor to the menu bar.  Maybe over time this will become automatic but even so it still doesn't make any sense.\nJust wondering if there are some good reasons for this decision or was it just a programmer showing off.\n\nA: There are a couple of good reasons. One is saving screen space on small screens. You want to focus on content as much as possible. Hiding parts of a picture in order to show a menu, isn't really that friendly. Also, by hiding the menus when you don't need them, you make the desktop feel less cluttered and technical. A lot of application developers have also started removing the menu bar and the way things are going, the old-style menus will be superseeded by new ways of accomplishing your goals. \nYou can deactivate this if you want to, although it's not as user friendly as it could be. \nPress Alt+F2 and enter gksu gedit /etc/X11/Xsession.d/81ubuntumenuproxy. The file will be empty because it does't exist yet. Enter the following: UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 and save the file. The next time you log in, menus will be on each window and not in the panel. In order to reverse, just open the file again and remove the content. \n\nA: The rationale is that hardware is moving in the direction of touch screens and tablets. \nKeep in mind that you can use the \"Windows\" / \"Super\" button on your keyboard and then start typing the name of the application you need. You can also right click on the icon when an application is open and lock it to the task bar. \nUltimately with the keyboard shortcuts, the new unity is a lot faster when looking for applications. \nStill frustrated? You could also install something like Cairo Dock or my personal favorite EasyStroke which allows you to create mouse gestures that open specific programs or input commands. \nXubuntu, Lubuntu, and Linux Mint may be the way to go if the new Unity just isn't for you.

While installing Ubuntu 13.04 I accidentally deleted the Windows 8 system entirely!How and where can i get Windows 8 back?\n\nA: There is no way to recover the Windows 8 system if you have deleted it.\nHowever, if you happened to have made a bootable clone of the Windows 8 system before deleting, you could boot into the external drive, make a partition so you can dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 8, and restore to that newly created Windows 8 partition.\nIf you do not have any backup, then you must follow mdpc's advice and reinstall from the Windows 8 Install DVD.\n\nA: Welcome to AskUbuntu. Unfortunately the short and only answer to your question relies in to re install the whole Microsoft Windows 8 Operating System by using the DVD's and the product key which came with your computer when you purchased it.\nThe process itself is easy in Windows 8, unfortunately the details are off topic on this site so I suggest you to look for assistance in the Microsoft Support site at: http://support.microsoft.com/ where they can tell you exactly what to do even if you weren't provided with DVD's/Product key when purchasing your equipment.\nAnyway, if you're not in a hurry and wish to give a chance to testdisk, you may succeed bringing back the whole previous partitions, after which you can easily recover your data and if you're lucky enough, the old OS will work again. I suggest you to check for previous answers to data-recovery related questions in which you will find fully documented procedures to do so. If you are only interested on recovering certain data, the same answers will give you a clue on where to begin.\nGood luck!\n\nA: For to recover lost datas there are forensic commands like photorec and testdisk.\nActually photorec cannot recover Windows-8 as still too new filesystem.\nBut testdisk is already familiar with filesystem of Windows-8.\nBut recovery is only possible if lost datas are NOT in the same track, like the new datas, who have been written over them. If they are in the same track (of your hard-disk), then they are lost.\nForgotten to mention this: You could recover with a live-CD of knoppix 7.2.0 - only in case that new datas have not over-written same physically tracks like your Windows-8 had before.\n", "Q: After installing Ubuntu I no longer have the option to start Windows 7 Professional I have just installed Ubuntu for the first time.

After installation, the Ubuntu was orange. When I reboot I am not given a choice of operating system: instead it goes straight to Ubuntu. How do I change this so I can access Windows 7 again?\n\nA: You can try using Boot-Repair: Boot-Repair instructions\n\nA: Presuming that you installed Ubuntu 13.04, here is what you can try.  Boot from the Ubuntu 13.04 LiveCD.  Open Gparted by typing it in the Dash.  When it loads you should see all the partitions that are on the hard drive. Linux partitions will be EXT4 and the windows partitions will probably be NTFS.\nLook at the list of partitions and see which one is the Linux partition, and look at the Mount Points of the partitions. You should see one with a / under Mount Point with a file system of EXT4, and look to see the name of it. In my case as per the images below of terminal, and Gparted its called /dev/sda1 (yours may be different).  Open Terminal, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

I can't figure out how to make the same thing happen in Ubuntu. It seems that some kind of cert is required.\nAny idea how authenticate with an OpenVPN server with only a username and password?\n\nA: You can authenticate using a username/password perfectly fine without a server/CA certificate. However, I highly recommend configuring it to verify it with your CA certificate to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks.\nWithout any server verification anyone can impersonate your OpenVPN server and just accept your username/password. Results:\n\n\n*\n\n*The attacker can intercept all traffic. As you don't verify the server you're connecting to, anyone can claim to be your server in a public network (or private network controlled by the attacker).\n\n*The attacker knows your username/password combination. Very very bad in case you reuse the same password for other things as well.\n\n\nIn Network Manager, it works fine without CA Cert as shown below, but please don't use it like that! If you don't use any server/CA certificate on Windows, you're really vulnerable to the above attacks.\n\n\nA: I have found answer here: http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html#auth\nRemember, you still need to have server certificate\n\nUsing username/password authentication as the only form of client\n  authentication\nBy default, using auth-user-pass-verify or a\n  username/password-checking plugin on the server will enable dual\n  authentication, requiring that both client-certificate and\n  username/password authentication succeed in order for the client to be\n  authenticated.\nWhile it is discouraged from a security perspective, it is also\n  possible to disable the use of client certificates, and force\n  username/password authentication only. On the server:\nclient-cert-not-required Such configurations should usually also set:\nusername-as-common-name which will tell the server to use the username\n  for indexing purposes as it would use the Common Name of a client\n  which was authenticating via a client certificate.\nNote that client-cert-not-required will not obviate the need for a\n  server certificate, so a client connecting to a server which uses\n  client-cert-not-required may remove the cert and key directives from\n  the client configuration file, but not the ca directive, because it is\n  necessary for the client to verify the server certificate.\n\n", "Q: development desktop in ubuntu 12.04 how do I create programs for ubuntu, with the same ease that I have with visual studio express on windows?\n\nA: In the Ubuntu Software Center \\ Development \\ IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) you will probably find what you are looking for.

I am not looking for the path of the ruby installation, but rather the path at which a ruby instance was executed\n\nA: So you got the process id, you can then look around the /proc/ virtual file system. Everything is there. For e.g. \n\n\n*\n\n*/proc/23124/cwd - the current directory of process 23124\n\n*/proc/23124/cmdline - the full command line of the process.\n\n\nA: Even though /proc has been mentioned briefly above as a source of information for learning about processes on a system, I include here a basic Bash script to parse some information out of it. For an excellent introduction to the /proc virtual filesystem, see this IBM article, which explains how it can be useful for both users and programmers.\nParsing /proc with a generic script can be unreliable, as different processes often have different /proc layouts, but basic information can usually be gleaned with this script, although it may have to be modified if you want to parse any other specific information. I have written it using Bash, but there are better parsers which you could investigate if you want to write it using a different scripting language. \nOften in the output of the script you may see a \"permission denied\" message, which means the /proc location is not readable by $USER, so you can run the script as root if you want in that case to gain the full output.\nCopy the body of the script into a new file, save it, and make it executable (chmod u+x) and then call it with at least one argument (it now can handle multiple processes at the same time):\n./proc_script xfce4-panel\n\nor put it in your $HOME/bin and then you can run it like other programs if $HOME/bin is in your path. (However, if you use sudo you will still have to give the absolute path location of the script, as $HOME/bin is not in root's path.)\nThe body of the script; it is also available and updated at my Github page:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash  \n\n(( $# == 0 )) && { printf \"Usage: Please specify the name of one process \\\nto research.\\n\" >&2; exit 1; }\n\nargs=(\"$@\")                   \nfor process in \"${args[@]}\"; do                    \n    # store user input in a variable and warn then exit if program is not running\n    queried_pid=\"$(pgrep \"${process}\" || { printf '%s\\n' \"No such program\" >&2; })\"\n\n    # add the contents of the variable into an array\n    pidarray=($(echo \"$queried_pid\"))\n\n    # iterate over the array, however many pids have been found\n    for i in \"${pidarray[@]}\"; do \n        printf \"Pid is: %s\\nExe is: %s\\nCmdline is: %s\\ncwd is: %s\\n\" \"$(echo \"$i\")\" \\\n    \"$(stat -c %N /proc/\"$i\"/exe)\" \"$(cat /proc/\"$i\"/cmdline)\" \"$(cd /proc/\"$i\"/cwd/; pwd -P)\"\n    done\n    printf \"\\n\\n\"\ndone\n\nexit \n\nSample output 1:\n./proc_parse firefox\n\n\nPid is: 1830\nExe is: `/proc/1830/exe' -> `/usr/lib/firefox/firefox'\nCmdline is: /usr/lib/firefox/firefox\ncwd is: /home/mike\n\nSample Output 2 (dealing with multiple pids):\n./proc_parse evince\n\nPid is: 3113\nExe is: `/proc/3113/exe' -> `/usr/bin/evince'\nCmdline is: evince/home/mike/Z_IBM_lpic_Linux_pdfs/l-proc-pdf.pdf\ncwd is: /home/mike\nPid is: 3119\nExe is: `/proc/3119/exe' -> `/usr/lib/evince/evinced'\nCmdline is: /usr/lib/evince/evinced\ncwd is: /\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu as Miracast Sender/receiver I couldn't find anything about Ubuntu acting as a Miracast receiver or sender.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can it work at all?\n\n*Are there hardware prerequisites?\n\n*Is WiFi a requirement or can it work over LAN or another kind of network connection?\n\n*WiFi direct seems to be a necessary requirement, is it a sufficient one?

If anyone can confirm, or suggest another device with Ubuntu drivers, that would be great.\n\nA: The Google Cast extension for Chromium works in Ubuntu (to cast Chromium pages/browsing to your TV using a ChromeCast at 720p which looks just fine, though a bit lagged).\nIt doesn't cast the YUV (video overlay) space well though, even on 802.11n.  (Testing in 12.04 LTS and 13.10, with latest Chromium)\nHaving said that, casting YouTube from my Android 4.3 (Galaxy Nexus) phone works beautifully.  (The ChromeCast dongle takes over the download+display, so it's not dependent on your phone/laptop once you've hit Play). \nI've not found any Miracast sender apps (eg. EZ Air) for Ubuntu yet unfortunately (for eBay HK/China generic HDMI Miracast dongles).\nSo the 5 metre HDMI cable (also from eBay) is still our solution for ondemand TV at full-screen 1080p. \n\nA: OpenWFD is dead and now superceded by MiracleCast:\n\nMiracleCast is an open-source implementation of the Miracast technology (also: Wifi-Display (WFD)). It is based on the OpenWFD research project and will supercede it. We focus on proper and tight integration into existing Linux-Desktop systems, compared to OpenWFD which was meant as playground for fast-protoyping.\nDespite its name and origin, the project itself is not limited to Miracast. We can support any kind of display-streaming with just a minimal amount of additional work. However, Miracast will remain the main development target due to its level of awareness.\n\nIt's still early in its development cycle. Currently it seems like it can do the linking, but won't do the actual video streaming.\nThe OpenWFD demo at FOSDEM 2014 also did the streaming bit, but as I understand MiracleCast is a do it right project, whereas the code he showed at FOSDEM \"will probably only work on this machine\".\n\nA: I got inspired to hunt a little more, and indeed, there isn't much on miracast, however I did find this post from a few months ago that claims android doesn't even have it yet, thus I suspect it's still being worked on.\nBecause of this I'm going to take some liberty and discuss DNLA / UPnP as it is almost the same (minus the direct connection and exact screen mirroring)\nApparently, in KDE there is a media KIO-slave for kde called kio-upnp-ms that I saw announced here.\nMoreover there seems to be a fair amount of other UPnP and DNLA options, such as XBMC as listed here and here\nAlso, searching for 'upnp' in synaptic will give you a many gnome options, for example Rygel is well integrated in Gnome and easy to use.\n\nA: On the receiver side (sink) the already mentioned MiracleCast seems to be the best choice. There is also work going on to support sending streams (source).\nGnome-Network-Displays (formerly Gnome-Screencast) is a new (2019) effort to support Miracast streaming (source) in GNU/Linux.\n\nA: You can try out the gnome-screencast project.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 32-bits, for some experiment I need to disable ASLR; how do I accomplish that? What should I do after that to enable ASLR again?\n\nA: If you want to construct a program which disables ASLR for itself when it runs, you can use the personality system call on Linux. Here's a recipe:\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <sys/personality.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n    const int old_personality = personality(ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE);\n    if (!(old_personality & ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE)) {\n        const int new_personality = personality(ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE);\n        if (new_personality & ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE) {\n            execv(argv[0], argv);\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"&argc == %p\\n\", (void *) &argc);\n}\n\nIf you look at the source for setarch, it calls personality twice in roughly this pattern. The major difference is that setarch calls exec on some other program, whereas my recipe execs itself. It's important that you use non-zero-ness of & ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE and not equality tests: else you can go into an infinite exec loop if you e.g. compile with -z execstack.\nSee also the man page for personality.\n\nA: The /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space interface controls ASLR system-wide.\nIf you don't want a system-wide change, use ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE personality flag to temporarily disable ASLR. Controlling of this flag can be done with setarch and its -R option, like\nsetarch `uname -m` -R /bin/bash\n\nThis will open a new Bash shell for you with ASLR disabled, including all child processes run from this shell. Just exit the shell once you're done.\n\nBy the way, on i386, ulimit -s unlimited can effectively \"disable\" ASLR.\nEDIT (Apr 2016): The ulimit -s unlimited was fixed and assigned CVE-2016-3672.\n\nA: The more permanent ways of disabling ASLR should be kept in a VM for obvious reasons.\nto test the ability to overwrite stack frame return addresses etcetera, you'll need to compile without stack canaries -fno-stack-protector, while to allow you to execute code on the stack you need to compile with -z execstack, making\n$ gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -o <my_program> my_code.c\n\n\nA: You can use the following command to temporarily disable ASLR.\nsudo sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space=0 \n\n\nA: According to an article How Effective is ASLR on Linux Systems?, you can configure ASLR in Linux using the /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space interface.\n\nThe following values are supported:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*0 – No randomization. Everything is static.\n  \n*1 – Conservative\n  randomization. Shared libraries, stack, mmap(), VDSO and heap are\n  randomized.\n  \n*2 – Full randomization. In addition to elements listed in\n  the previous point, memory managed through brk() is also randomized.\n  \n\nSo, to disable it, run\necho 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space\n\nand to enable it again, run\necho 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space\n\nThis won't survive a reboot, so you'll have to configure this in sysctl. Add a file /etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-aslr.conf containing:\nkernel.randomize_va_space = 0\n\nshould permanently disable this.\n", "Q: Unity will not load, ccsm settings don't stick When I log in, the only thing I get is a desktop background, but no Unity elements.

When it's abandoned, will Canonical abandon it as well, or will they backport security fixes from PHP 5.4+ (where applicable) until 2017?\n\nA: PHP is in the main repository.\n$ apt-cache policy php5\nphp5:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6\n  Version table:\n     5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6 0\n        500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security/main amd64 Packages\n     5.3.10-1ubuntu3 0\n        500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/main amd64 Packages\n\nand supported for 5 years:\n$ apt-cache show php5 | grep ^Supported\nSupported: 5y\n\nCanonical's definition for software in this repository is:\n\nMain\nThe main component contains applications that are free software, can\n  be freely redistributed and are fully supported by the Ubuntu team.\n  This includes the most popular and most reliable open-source\n  applications available, many of which are included by default when you\n  install Ubuntu. Software in main includes a hand-selected list of\n  applications that the Ubuntu developers, community and users feel are\n  most important, and that the Ubuntu security and distribution team are\n  willing to support. When you install software from the main component,\n  you are assured that the software will come with security updates and\n  that commercial technical support is available from Canonical.\n\nSo, yes, the policy is to provide security updates to PHP for five years, independently of what PHP is doing. This is not unique to Canonical, but also Red Hat, Debian and other distributions backport security patches for newer versions.\nI don't think that point releases of Ubuntu LTS will upgrade to PHP 5.4 - it may be available as a separate package though. See also What are point releases in LTS versions?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 installation issues: unable to handle kernel paging request error I wish I could say that I’ve done more for the Linux community as of recent but I am very VERY new to all of this and I feel very much in over my head. I figured I would install Ubuntu. on my computer and then I would learn and contribute to the community simultaneously. I will try to be as detailed as I can, please ask questions if you need clarification.\nI installed Ubuntu. 13.04 (64-bit) on my dell Inspiron 1501. This has an AMD Turion 64-bit TL-56 1.8 Ghz mobile processor. It is a dual core. It has an ATI Radeon Xpress 1150 chipset in it as well. As of right now I only have a total of 2Ghz ram, however I was planning on upgrading that in the near future so I opted for the 64-bit Ubuntu. 13.04.\nI first tried the live CD and everything seemed to be functioning correctly other than the wireless (but that's not the issue at hand, there are plenty of guides on the internet on how to get that functioning). The internet worked just fine when it was plugged in so no issues there. However, once I went from that to installing 13.04 (just 13.04, no dual partitioning... I want this computer to run strictly Ubuntu.) it did not work. It took me into a shell that I could not type anything into. In this shell it said Bug: unable to handle kernel paging and then it called a bunch of traces and froze up. \nI had to hard reset the laptop. I tried the boot-repair program multiple times with many different settings and typically after starting up the laptop would say something along the lines of recursive errors. will attempt to fix and then it would attempt to fix a couple of things, and then the computer would freeze up after the text said end trace... so I had to hard reset it again. I'm not an impatient person either, when I say it would freeze up it would be for a period of at least 15 minutes each time before I decided to hard reset. I attempted to install 12.10 on it instead and I got the same exact message, and when I ran boot-repair it did the same exact thing as before.\nI am currently in the process of running memtest64+ on the computer's memory, though I really don't believe that, nor any of the hardware is at fault due to the fact that it was still running windows vista perfectly when I had decided to switch over to Ubuntu. so far the memtest has came back just fine without any errors, but I’ve only been running it for approximately an hour.\nSo this is the situation I’m in. I did notice when I was using the live disk that the video driver needed updated so I performed that, though I’m fairly certain that has nothing to do with this. I have also attempted (though I’m not certain that my attempt was successful in accomplishing what I had planned) to manually edit the grub settings by making acpi=0 along top of adding nomodeset to the boot commands. Like I said, I’m not sure I did that correctly though, but I’m fairly certain I did.\nIf anyone needs any more information I will be more than happy to provide it, I will post back once I get the full results of the memtest. I very much appreciate any ideas anyone else has, I’ve been at this for a few days to no avail... thank you\n\nA: From experience I tried 12.10 and currently running 13.04 flawlessly BUT needless to say that I find 12.04 LTS, THE most stable release out there nopt to mention that is a Long term Support version until 2017....Did you try 12.04 yet? I would if I was you, maybe you'll have better luck with this version.\nGood luck and welcome to a wonderful community....such is Ubuntu and Linux.\nLuis\n\nA: For anyone who stumbles across this question in hopes of an answer:\nI got to thinking about my problem and the answer became quite clear to me. I was told by the person I had received this laptop from that my laptop was a true 64 bit system. He's a close friend of mine and he's pretty tech savvy. I was taking his word that it was in fact a true 64 bit laptop but Upon further research I discovered its not actually a true 64 bit system. So basically ehat was happening was it was searching for a node that wasn't actually there, hence the error. \nI them installed the 32 bit version of Ubuntu 13.04 completely error free. It runs very smoothly, the only glitch I had was getting the wireless card to work. So i hooked it up via ethernet cable and installed the correct nonfree driver. I really do hope this helps anyone looking for an answer to this or a similar issue. I will be answering more questions as soon as I configure everything the was I want and figure out what the hell I'm doing\n\nA: I got this error when I was trying to install the 12.04.3 LTS 64-bit on Dell Latitude E6430 from USB, which I prepared with the UNetbootin (in Windows).  At last I created the installation USB with the Universal USB Installer and the installation succeeded.\n", "Q: Unable to open software-center in ubuntu 13.04 When I click on Ubuntu Software Center it does nothing.

I have two old hard drives from my MacBook that I would like to get usable files off of.

You can copy files easily, but for your purpose, you can change file permissions or owners easily and recursively with a nice GUI interface. It's going to install a lot of KDE stuff you might not need otherwise, but it's a really nice file manager I use a lot.\nI would copy everything off to a safe place using dolphin, change the file permissions and owner to something that makes sense, format the drives to ext4, and put them in an external USB housing.

I will discuss one possible reason, overheating, in this answer. Overheating is an easy problem to detect. You can continually monitor your computer's hardware temperatures using an application from the Ubuntu Software Center called Psensor.\nInstall Psensor. Also install lm-sensors to detect your computer's hardware sensors. Then detect your computer's hardware sensors by opening the terminal and running the command:\nsudo sensors-detect\n\nThen you will get asked a lot of questions about what hardware you want the program to detect.  It is generally safe and recommended to accept the default answers to all questions, unless you know what you're doing.\nIn Ubuntu 16.04 and later Psensor detect your computer's hardware sensors automatically without running sudo sensors-detect\nPsensors is displayed on the desktop as a little thermometer icon in the notification area in the upper right-hand corner of the desktop. You can right-click the thermometer icon at any time to display the hardware temperatures. As a general guideline, a hardware temperature of 60o C is hot. A hardware temperature of 70o C and above is too hot, and could cause your system to crash.\n", "Q: Modem stopped working on Ubuntu 12.10 I was using MTS Mblaze Modem for ~9 days on Ubuntu 12.10.

It's description states:\nThe purpose of this package is for applications that only support OSS\nto depend on it, hence preventing common \"/dev/dsp not found\" errors\nthat would confuse unexperienced users.\n\nYet after installing it, no /dev/dsp devices have been added to the system and older applications still have the same problems. Other OSS emulation instructions also did not work.\nI though it might have trouble as I have two sound devices (a sound card and tv/fm tuner), but physically removing one device and restarting made no difference.\nI have also tried the aoss and padsp OSS wrapper applications but without success (works for applications not seeing /dev/mixer, but not those that require /dev/dsp). \n\nA: According to the comments on a bug filed on launchpad, it seems the oss-compat package works under the assumption that the ALSA OSS compatibility modules (snd-pcm-oss, snd-seq-oss and snd-mixer-oss) are already in your current installation. Unfortunately, it seems the Ubuntu kernel no longer includes these modules by default and it is necessary to recompile your kernel with a custom config to include them. \nA simpler option (which is only available on newer Ubuntu versions) seems to be the osspd package that creates a daemon proxy for emulating OSS.\n", "Q: How to install Realtek Wireless Drives Just incase I' will give you this \n02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

I just am tired of my internet connection cutting out from time to time. Also whenever I move closer to the router it still sometimes cuts out too.\n\nA: Which version of Ubuntu have you ?  few weeks ago I bought my new HP Laptop and I tried to install on it Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I couldn't get an internet connection at all. I had to an external usb wireless adaptor. Then I had the idea to try and install the LATEST version of Ubuntu (13.04) and that pretty much solved my problem. The 13.04 installation automatically detected the realtek drivers and I no longer had to use the wireless adaptor. Try upgrading to the latest version (if you are using any other version but 13.04) and if that also doesn't work, go to System Settings --> Software & Updates --> Additional Drivers Tab. \nPlease let me know for further details. \nRegards, \nAnthie G.\n", "Q: Shell script to check if something is plugged in the wifi USB port I have a wifi access point that allows to plug a USB hard drive accessible from any computer sharing the same wifi. I would like to know if there was a way a shell script could test if something is plugged there or not.\nIf there is a way to check which USB key or hard drive is plugged would be a delight, but I'm not asking that much.\n\nedit\nThe goal is to check if the drive is on before I can work with the files. I want to access the drive using samba. The IP is 192.168.0.1. I can get the name of the drive, but the IP is fix, whichever drive I plug.\nNOTE: my final goal is to upload files on that drive with a shell script. I don't mind if you give me another way to do it: SSH, FTP, HTTP, morse code, …\n\nA: You're probably not going to be able to figure out which drive it is without some fiddling around.  More on that later.\nFirstly, try to mount the device.  If the mount fails, nothing is plugged in.  Change the paths and options, obviously.  (must be run as root, or with sudo)\nmount -t cifs -o <options here> //192.168.0.1/share_name /mnt/whatever\nif [[ $? = 1 ]]; then\n   echo \"Drive not available.\"\n   exit 1;\nfi\n\nIf it succeeds, continue on with your copies to /mnt/whatever.\nIf you want to be able to tell which drive is inserted, one simple thing you could do is create a file in the root of the USB key or drive that identifies it.  I have a Corsair USB key, for example, create an empty file called \"CORSAIR\" in the top directory of the key.  Obviously, you could call it anything you want.  Then, after mounting, test for the existence of the file.  You could even unmount it at that point and mount it on another directory for further use.\nif [[ -f /mnt/whatever/CORSAIR ]]; then\n    echo \"CORSAIR USB key detected..\"\n    # do some stuff\nfi\nif [[ -f /mnt/whatever/PERSONAL ]]; then\n    echo \"Personal USB key detected...\"\n    umount /mnt/whatever\n    mount -t cifs -o <options> //192.168.0.1/share_name /mnt/PERSONAL\nfi\n\nSince you're mounting and unmounting, you'll have to run as root or use \"sudo mount\", which will prompt for passwords.\n", "Q: How to install app with run file in Ubuntu 13.04 Downloaded Copy application (dropbox alternative) for Linux https://www.copy.com/install/ \nArchive contains variant of GUI binaries with .run file. \nI successfully executed it, but after reset OS app does not auto-start with and I cant find it with search.\nI suppose that application needs to be installed somehow\nPlease advise how to install this application \nI am novice with Linux so please make instructions as clear as possible.\n\nA: I have downloaded the archive, and I have found no .run file. Instead, I have read the included README file which I actually found quite straightforward.\nThere are three programs:\n\n\n*\n\n*CopyAgent -- it will display a nice GUI login screen and (probably) will become a tray icon. Could not test it, since I have no Copy account.\n\n*CopyConsole -- a headless (no output, no GUI) process that can run in background and manage your synchronisation.\n\n*CopyCmd -- a command line interface\n\n\nIf unsure, use CopyAgent by clicking it. There is no need to install it. It will just run. \nP.S. Um, apparently running sudo CopyAgent -installOverlay installs a Nautilus overlay (which I guess allows to show which files are synced, which not). I think it does not replace running the CopyAgent itself.\n", "Q: Downloading older versions of Ubuntu I need to get Ubuntu 10.04 version.

I have a 13\" Macbook Pro 2010. Should I download the 32-bit version or the 64-bit version of Ubuntu?\n\nA: The way you work this out is by looking up what sort of CPU you have and then looking up that CPU to see what it supports. In your case:\n\n\n*\n\n*The 2010 MBP uses a Intel Core 2 Duo P8600\n\n*The P8600 has a 64-bit instruction set\n64-bit should be fine. 32bit will also work.\n\nA: According to Google, your MacBook has 4GB of RAM memory. The rule of thumb to use is that you should install the 64-bit version of Ubuntu if you have more than 3GB of RAM and if your CPU supports a 64-bit OS. Intel Core 2 Duo CPUs support 64-bit OSs, so you should choose the 64-bit version of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: External Hard Drive Drop/Fall I actually am having a problem for which I would really appreciate some advice.\nYesterday night my external 500GB (USB) hard drive (a big one, with case) fell. It was on my PC and fell down on the carpet. It was in its case of course but the cable was moved a bit and it fell on the carpet. I was using the HD at that time. I was watching a movie that was located on the Hard Drive. After the fall my computer does not recognize it. \nWhen I plug it in I can hear the sound of the HD (which I guess means it gets power) but it does not appear as an external HD. I used \"Disks\" in Ubuntu to see if the system can detect the HD and it appears in that application as a USB HD. I tried then to right click on the HD and \"Create a Disk Image\" but I had no luck at all. I am sure that the HD can power on (because of the sound) and it is recognizable from Ubuntu's Disks Application and Windows Disk Manager as well. My problem is that it's not accessible. I have more than a lot of data stored on this Hard Drive. \nAny ideas to save it?\n\nA: Remove it from the case and use normal connectors to try to access the drive: it might be just a data channel cable that was broken during the fall.\nIf you remove the drive from the case you will find yourself 99.9% of the cases with a perfectly normal hard disk that can be plugged in to a computer and accessed as a normal drive. If plugging it in to the computer as a normal drive gives you the same results (disk is visible but seems that there is no access to it) then I would start to be worried about your data.\nIf plugging it in to the computer works then I would say its just a matter of buying a extra hard disk USB case and installing the drive back.\n", "Q: canon IR C3380 driver I need to configure a Canon IR C3380 printer.

Ie., user created, like compiling software manually, writing documents.\n\n*Is there a way to list files that are from packages, but are changed? To check what did I modified.\n\n\nThis would be useful to me at a project to update custom-made images that are used internally. Also, when re-installing at home and I forgot what I did. Of course most interesting are outside the home dir, but changes in for example dot-configuration files in home are also interesting.\n\nA: To answer your question literally, you can list files that do not come from packages this way:\nfind / -xdev -type f | sort >/tmp/root.files\nsort /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list >/tmp/installed.files\ncomm -23 /tmp/root.files /tmp/installed.files\n\nThat will of course include every file in home directories. You can skip some directories in the find command by adding -prune directives (you'll also need to add -print to print the rest, as the -print action is only implied if there is no action).\nfind / -xdev -type f -path /home -prune -o -path /var -prune -o -print | sort >/tmp/root.files\n\nTo check if a file has changed, you can compare its checksum against the one in /var/lib/dpkg/info/$PACKAGE.md5sum. If you want to compare every file (which will take a very long time):\nfor p in /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list; do\n  diff <(md5sum $(cat $p) | sort) <(sort ${p#.list}.md5sums);\ndone\n\nYou should not need this, because you should not modify files that come from packages. You should not add your own files in system directories either.\nIf you modify a configuration file, it lives in /etc; this is the only place where you should modify system files. Install the etckeeper package to keep track of your modifications in /etc. Run sudo etckeeper init, and /etc will be under version control (Bazaar by default).\nIf you install software system-wide, install it under /usr/local. Don't touch anything in /bin, /sbin, /lib (except manually-installed kernel modules if you need them because you have unusual hardware), or /usr (except /usr/local which is for your own use).\nAll files in your home directory were created by you (except for a handful that were copied from /etc/skel when you created your account). There's no general way to keep track of which ones are application defaults, which ones result from you selecting configuration options and which ones record current state (open files, command history, etc).\n\nA: For your second point, you can use debsums -ac (from the package of the same name) to list all package files (including configuration files) that have been modified.\n\nA: Putting the other answers together, here's a script that lists all files that are not from any installed packages, followed by all configuration files that have changed.\n{ \\\n    find \"${PREFIX-}/\" -xdev -type f && \\\n    echo \"\" && \\\n    cat -- \"${PREFIX}\"/var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list; \\\n} | awk '\n    done { --seen[$0]; }\n    /^$/ { done = 1; }\n    !done { files[++n] = $0; ++seen[$0]; }\n    END { for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i) { if (seen[files[i]] > 0) { print(files[i]); } } }\n' && debsums --admindir=\"${PREFIX-}\"/var/lib/dpkg -a -c 2> /dev/null\n\nBefore using it, note the following:\n\n*\n\n*Replace -a with -e and add -not -name \"*~\" after -type f if you only care about changes to configuration files.\n(This is significantly faster.)\n\n\n*Add sudo as needed.\n", "Q: Upgrading ubuntu 12.04 from 32 to 64 bit So I know this has been asked alot on this site, but I want to be a 100% sure if I am doing it correct (seeing as I don't want to break my notebook or what not). \nI read several questions and I think I figured out how to do it, (please note I only have 32 bit for a day, so I don't have to be afraid of losing files):\n\n\n*\n\n*First I go to Ubuntu.com.\n\n*Once there I'll download the 64 bit version.\n\n*I restart my computer and dual-boot to the 64-bit version.\n\n*Once I am in the 64-bit version I perform steps 3 to 5 of this question.\nAm I correct? Or will my laptop fall apart if I attempt this?\nI did the test described here, and yes my notebook is 64-bit compatible.\nI am totally new with Ubuntu so please be gentle :)\n\nA: You don't really have to uninstall the previous 32 bit version of your Ubuntu. Download the 64 bit image and install it on the same partition where you installed the 32 bit version. That should do it. I followed the same approach when I installed 12.10 on my Desktop and I dint screw it up! And don't forget to format the EXT4 partition so that remnants of  32 bit is completely wiped out. \n", "Q: how to configure rsyslog to send file from specific program to specific location on remote server I want to configure rsyslog on a centralised server so that all the logs of clients are stored at one place now the problem I'm having is I dont know how to implement rsyslog so that it creates logs based on programmes on client machines i.e. like 'httpd' etc. and save them in different files i.e. '/var/log/httpd.log' and while it sends the log to the remote server the files should be saved like '/var/log/ip-address of host/httpd.log' I have these two problems\n\n\n*\n\n*Logs should be created on programme basis\n\n*while logs are transmitted to remote server they should be stored on program basis with different directories for different hosts. \n\n\nI hope I made my question clear.

I have about 50~ poorly indented and very very hard to read to code. Do you guys have any tips on how to indent this to make it more readable?\n\nA: I regularly use a tool called HTML Tidy to clean up dirty HTML. The Ubuntu package is simply called \"tidy\". \nFor PHP there seems to exist a tool called phptidy, but apart from testing if it works, I never used it.\n\nA: If you have worked with Python before and the code is HTML or XML, then I would suggest using BeautifulSoup and automate the process for all files. In a Python console run this:\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc)\nprint(soup.prettify())\n\nHere html_doc is just the text of the file to be indented.\nOr the non-geeky was is to use some IDE to get it done individually.\n\nA: PHPFormatter is a php script found here -- https://github.com/NathanWong/phpformatter\nIt can be run via the command line and does an awesome job of formatting PHP,HTML,and Javascript. From the authors description:\n\"This PHP script will format another PHP script using my arbitrarily set formatting rules (real tabs, 97 chars per line, brackets on their own line, indentation based on operator hierarchy not alignment, spaces around most operators but not commas or brackets, space after if, etc.). It will also format inline HTML, and if JS Beautify is available, it'll use that for inline Javascript in inline HTML too.\"\nIt works great in Geany (sudo apt-get install geany).\nI simply unzipped the 2 files : format.php and jsbeautify.php to my home directory and then added the following custom command in Geany (Edit->Format-Send Selection To->Set Custom Commands):\nphp /home/myusername/format.php -\n(Note the dash at the end. This tells the script to accept input from the standard input stream which is where Geany sends the text.) Now all you have to do is a quick Ctrl+a (SelectAll) then Ctrl+1 (or whichever number you put the command on) and ...\nVoila...\nBeautifully formatted code!!\nThanks Nathan!\n\nA: maybe you could try phptidy command line tool which works on Linux and Windows\n\nA: E-tools is a GUI application that indents, formats and highlights HTML, JavaScript, JSON and SQL code. To install the e-tools snap package in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu, open the terminal and type:\nsudo snap install e-tools\n\nHighlighting is a nice feature that helps you to scan the code for obvious errors and fix them.\n", "Q: can't install jre ( java runtime enviornment ) in ubuntu 10.10?

When I boot, I get directly to Windows 8, without any prompt or boot menu/grub menu. To access Ubuntu, I have to go to boot options by pressing F-12 while booting. How do I get the boot menu?\n\nA: This might be a problem of broken grub. Grub is basically a boot loader. In other words it is the screen that comes up with options to start Windows or Ubuntu.  I had a very similar problem. In my case I had dual booted Mint and Ubuntu. To fix the grub, check this.\n", "Q: Run shell commands from browser I'd like to access the terminal from Firefox specifically.  I only have access to firefox, I can't access terminal on its own.\n\nA: You can't do this by default. No page-level element has access to anything like that and the standard chrome (the interface, not the competing browser) is fairly locked down.\nHowever there are plugins. Chrome-level elements can access and fork out commands. To do this you'll either need to write your own Firefox-based terminal emulator or use something like commandrun.\nI'm sort of assuming this is a kiosk machine you're trying to break. If it is, and whoever owns it has done their job, you're not going to be able to install a random plugin (that would be pretty awful security!) so this just isn't going to work.\n", "Q: which version of ubuntu is compatible for compaq presario V2555US please suggest me the UBUNTU version suitable for  compaq presario v2555US  having specifications as \nRAM:512mb,  Processor:AMD sempron 1.8 GHZ,  Hard drive:40GB\n\nA: I strongly recommend to use a desktop environment that does not need compositing (this is used for desktop effects), since compositing often consumes more than 100 MB of RAM and with your graphics chip you might not get a descent desktop experience. Therefore, Gnome 3 (Ubuntu Gnome Remix) and Unity (Ubuntu) are out of the question. In KDE (Kubuntu) one can disable compositing, but the KDE programs are also relatively heavy when it comes to RAM usage. \nLong answer short: That leaves Xfce (Xubuntu) and Lxde (Lubuntu) as good candidates. \nFor your computer, you'll probably have to use the 32bit version.\nAs a personal opinion: For stability I recommend to use LTS versions of *buntu whenever possible. If you decide to use Xubuntu, I'd therefore go for the 12.04 LTS version and upgrade to 14.04 LTS once it gets its first big update (14.04.1). Sadly, there is no up to date LTS version of Lubuntu.\nA second personal opinion: You might even be better off with Debian Wheezy and Xfce, which is even more lightweight than Xubuntu.\n", "Q: unmet dependencies, linux-server depends: linux-headers-server, but boot is full Hello I have an problem with unmet dependencies, but I cant fix it.\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade \nReading package lists...

I want to do this in 1 step for all files in my directory. \nAny assistance would be great. \n\nA: Here are two more extensive examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an md5 file in each directory which doesn't already have one, with absolute paths:\nfind \"$PWD\" -type d | sort | while read dir; do [ ! -f \"${dir}\"/@md5Sum.md5 ] && echo \"Processing \" \"${dir}\" || echo \"Skipped \" \"${dir}\" \" @md5Sum.md5 already present\" ; [ ! -f \"${dir}\"/@md5Sum.md5 ] &&  md5sum \"${dir}\"/* > \"${dir}\"/@md5Sum.md5 ; chmod a=r \"${dir}\"/@md5Sum.md5;done \n\n\n*Create an md5 file in each folder which doesn't already have one: no paths, only filenames:\nfind \"$PWD\" -type d | sort | while read dir; do cd \"${dir}\"; [ ! -f @md5Sum.md5 ] && echo \"Processing \" \"${dir}\" || echo \"Skipped \" \"${dir}\" \" @md5Sum.md5 allready present\" ; [ ! -f @md5Sum.md5 ] &&  md5sum * > @md5Sum.md5 ; chmod a=r \"${dir}\"/@md5Sum.md5 ;done \n\nWhat differs between 1 and 2 is the way the files are presented in the resulting md5 file.\nThe commands do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Build a list of directory names for the current folder. (Tree)\n\n*Sort the folder list.\n\n*Check in each directory if the file @md5sum.md5 exists. Output Skipped if it exists, output Processing if it doesn't exist.\n\n*If the @md5Sum.md5 file doesn't exist, md5Sum will generate one with the checksums of all the files in the folder.\n5) Set the generated @md5Sum.md5 file to read only.\n\n\nThe output of this entire script can be redirected to a file (.....;done > test.log)\nor piped to another program (like grep).\nThe output will only tell you which directories where skipped and which have been processed.\nAfter a successful run, you will end up with an @md5Sum.md5 file in each subdirectory of your current directory\nI named the file @md5Sum.md5 so it'll get listed at the top of the directory in a samba share.\nVerifying all @md5Sum.md5 files can be done by the next commands:\nfind \"$PWD\" -name @md5Sum.md5 | sort | while read file; do cd \"${file%/*}\"; md5sum -c @md5Sum.md5; done > checklog.txt\n\nAfterwards you can grep the checklog.txt using grep -v OK to get a list of all files that differ.\nTo regenerate an @md5Sum.md5 in a specific directory, when you changed or added files for instance, either delete the @md5Sum.md5 file or rename it and run the generate command again.\n\nA: I hit this issue, and while the solutions above are elegant, I wanted a quick and dirty hack for this situation: 1 directory, with subdirectories one level deep inside it.\nSo, enter the directory in a shell and run:\nmd5sum * */* 2>/dev/null > md5sum.md5\n\nThis gets all the files in the top level directory, removes the error warning about the sub directories being directories, and then runs md5sums on the subdirectory contents. Advantage: easy to remember, does exactly what it's supposed to do. I always get confused by find syntax and can never remember it off the top of my head, so no need to loop etc, dealing with spaces in directory names, this one liner worked fine. Not a robust powerful solution, no good for > 1 level of subdirectories, but a quick and easy fix for the problem.\n\nA: Here's mine:\ntime find dirname/|xargs md5sum |tee dirname.md5\n\nIt throws errors when it tries to calculate it for a directory, but it's good enough for me.\n\nA: A great checksum creation/verification program is rhash.\n\n*\n\n*It can create SFV compatible files, and check them too.\n\n\n*It supports md4, md5, sha1, sha512, crc32 and many many other.\n\n\n*It can do recursive creation (-r option) like md5deep or sha1deep.\n\n\n*Last but not least, you can format the output of the checksum file. For example:\nrhash --md5 -p '%h,%p\\n' -r /home/ > checklist.csv\n\noutputs a CSV file including the full path of files recursively starting with the /home directory.\nI also find the -e option to rename files by inserting crc32 sum into the name extremely useful.\nNote that you can also change md5sum with rhash in the PhoenixNL72 examples.\n\nA: You can pass md5sum multiple filenames or bash expansions:\n$ md5sum * > checklist.chk  # generates a list of checksums for any file that matches *\n$ md5sum -c checklist.chk   # runs through the list to check them\ncron: OK\ndatabase.sqlite3: OK\nfabfile.py: OK\nfabfile.pyc: OK\nmanage.py: OK\nnginx.conf: OK\nuwsgi.ini: OK\n\nIf you want to get fancy you can use things like find to drill down and filter the files, as well as working recursively:\nfind -type f -exec md5sum \"{}\" + > checklist.chk\n\n\nA: Using a for loop:\nfor i in *; do md5sum $i > $i.md5; done\n\n\nA: The rclone utility has this functionality and it's available from sudo apt install rclone\nYou can run it with:\nrclone hashsum MD5 <dirname>\n\nYou can also run other fun hashes such as:\n\n*\n\n*md5\n\n*sha1\n\n*whirlpool\n\n*crc32\n\n*sha256\n\n*dropbox\n\n*hidrive\n\n*mailru\n\n*quickxor\n\n", "Q: GRUB error.

So I have a question for those who are a little more clued up on this than myself.\nI have a laptop which is about 2 years old now and has been plaguing me with various issues for some time. The most common issues I get are overheating, complete halts, and random shutdowns.\nThe difference between overheating shutdowns and random ones are that when it overheats, it shuts down telling me that it's reached a critical temperature, whilst random is like someone pulled the power out and just goes pooof and off it is.\nAt first I thought I might have bad ventilation, serious overheating on the CPU, RAM and things like that. But I happened to stumble upon a small issue being mentioned on a hard drive test.\nOver the last few days things went from bad to worse.\nFor instance, last night I had booted the laptop from cold and opened the Downloads folder (which was slow, unresponsive and buggy for a few seconds) and then opened a video file (something i've done 1000x without issues) only this time I heard the startup music but the screen was blank, so trying to close the app, I discovered the laptop had completely frozen, no mouse movement and no response to any keyboard, so I was forced to do a restart.\nNeedless ton say, I'm now doing a dd clone to another hard drive I have.\nI want to say before I actually ask the question, that I had opened up the laptop a few weeks ago and to my surprise saw nothing wrong at all, no dust, no hint of burn marks, everything looked completely in tact.\nMy question is, if my harddrive is the problem and it's starting to fail, can that also be responsible for heating issues?\n\nA: \nMy question is, if my harddrive is the problem and it's starting to fail, can that also be responsible for heating issues?\n\nI won't say it's impossible but I've never seen it. Most disks are quite a long way away from the important parts. I'm sure some know-it-all will come along with an example where the disk is mounted on the CPU as its heatsink, but that isn't common. The HD is usually nice and accessible for maintenance, upgrades, etc.\nI would sooner blame the repetitive overheating doing damage. I've had a few thermal casualties over a couple of decades and not one left a scorch mark. The slot-CPU casing melted once (that was fun) but that was the only time I've ever seen evidence that the system got too hot.\nAnd remember there's nothing to say that this is just one issue. Disks fail all the time. Laptops cook themselves all the time. It could be possible that both are happening to you.\n\nA: If you are able to test run the laptop while it is open you night check the heat pipe. its the flattened tube that runs from the CPU to the vents in the back or side on the unit, i have encountered at least one machine whos heat pipe leaked out the gas and the CPU got hot to the point of thermal shutdown but the fan exaust was still cold. the heat pipe wasn't transferring the heat away!\n", "Q: Ubintu 13.04 hangs after install and reboot I installed Ubuntu 13.04 on an empty 34GB partition from an USB stick.

When you ran qmake-qt4 -project you stomped all over the previous (and likely correct) .pro.\nOnce you are back to the start, navigate to the directory containing the .pro and type qmake-qt4.  That will generate a Makefile based on the characteristics in the .pro.  When it finishes, run make.  This should build the entire project (assuming you already have the qt4 build dependencies installed).

According to the site, you must choose Ubuntu 11.10 to do the job. My question is will it work in any other versions of Ubuntu, or say other Linux distribution. \n\nA: It should work with any version of Ubuntu or Linux as long as you can properly mount the filesystem.

My laptop is a 64 bit machine, but I need to download a 32 bit version of the Ubuntu OS because my school has said that a particular program I need 'was made with the intention that the user will not be running it on a 64 bit version of the Ubuntu OS'. That is pretty much true because I have tried many ways to run it, and all my attempts have failed.\nThe problem is that after I have downloaded the client for the 32 bit version of Ubuntu (I'm sure it's the client for 32 bit because I have even redownloaded it) and installed it into my computer, the system settings in Ubuntu will say that I have the 64 bit of the OS installed. I check this by going to system settings > Details > OS type. My question is... how do I install a 32 bit version of the Ubuntu OS on a 64 bit window 7 machine?\n\nA: If I understand your situation correctly you already have Windows 7 64-bit installed on your laptop.  If you want to keep Windows installed but also use Ubuntu, there are a few options I can think of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a live CD\n\n*Use Wubi\n\n*Use VirtualBox\n\n*Use a dual boot\n\n\nThe VirtualBox option will definitely allow you to use the 32-bit version of Ubuntu but the others should as well (someone can correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nA: Here is the direct link to download the official and extended support version of ubuntu (12.04):\n32bit:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/questions?distro=desktop&bits=32&release=lts\nJust select your amount of donation, you can also set all to zero and hit the download button.\nMake sure the name of the file is: ubuntu-12.04.2-desktop-i386.iso\nI just checked the link, it should work.\nNow, instructions on how preparing method of installation depending on operating system and media available:\nWindows\n\n\n*\n\n*How to burn a DVD on Windows\n\n*How to create a bootable USB stick on Windows\n\n*Installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with the Windows installer\nOS X\n\n\n*\n\n*How to burn a DVD on OS X\n\n*How to create a bootable USB stick on OS X\nUbuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*How to burn a DVD on Ubuntu\n\n*How to create a bootable USB stick on Ubuntu\nAnd finally.\nInstallation instructions.\nI hope this was helpful \n:-)\n", "Q: Missing shared libraries when using chroot I'm attempting to use schroot to run a 32-bit application on a 64-bit Ubuntu (actually Lubuntu) Raring installation.  I was successful creating the chroot populated by the following command:\nsudo debootstrap --arch=i386 raring /srv/chroot/raring_i386 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu\nWhen I enter the chroot environment however and try to start the application I get errors about missing shared libraries.  For example:\n\nerror while loading shared libraries: libICE.so.s: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nSo far all the missing libraries in my chroot environment are located at usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/.  I can copy these missing libraries from a different full installation of 32-bit Ubuntu but I would have thought that the debootstrap step above should have downloaded these directly.  Can someone provide some additional insight into how the use of debootstrap should create the chroot environment?  Have I possibly missed a step or is there a different option in the call to debootstrap to tell it to get some additional shared libraries?\nMuch thanks!\n\nA: After a bit of trial/error and lucky web searching I think I found the solution I was looking for.  Here's a summary of the steps I used to solve the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Within the chroot environment run the following command to reveal the missing libraries:\nldd <binary executable>\n\nThis will reveal missing libraries as \"not found\".  Alternatively this command can be piped to grep as:\nldd <binary executable> | grep \"not found\"\n\n\n*Use the following command to locate the packages that will supply the missing libraries:\napt-cache search <library name>\n\n\n*Install the package from the previous step from within the chroot environment (multiple may be found):\nsudo apt-get install <package name>\n\nAfter I repeated the above steps for all missing libraries I was able to successfully launch the application from the chroot environment.\nThe reference I found that gave me the clue to search and install missing libraries is here.\n", "Q: Wifi is connected, but no internet access.

Actually I had such setup before and in case I reach top memory the usability went down. Try to add maximum memory you can. Then it could go somehow, depending on what you need to run. Otherwise I will recommend to use 12.04 Xubuntu or Lubuntu, which does not use Unity and therefore are less demanding to system resources. But you will loose some comfort Unity has. \n\nA: Personally I would not even try Ubuntu with a single core pentium.  Ubuntu and Kubuntu will be way too slow as will Gnome Remix.\nYou may be OK with Xubuntu however but I would recommend  Lubuntu it  runs on almost any hardware. Lubuntu is not an LTS release so I would go with the latest 13.04.\nMake sure you have a good set of backups first.\nTry it from a live USB/CD then assuming you have no problems install. You can restore your personal data from the backup.\nBoth Xubuntu and Lubuntu are official Ubuntu releases and supported here, Launchpad and on the Ubuntu Forums\n\nA: Try 13.04, Raring Ringtail. I do seem to notice a slight performance boost [on my legacy quad-core AMD] and suspect you may get something similar out of your Intel Core Duo. Everything is a little more snappy. \n\nA: Your computer will do a \"good\" work if we use \"Single task with enough time to finish each task\" as a synonym of \"good\" BUT JUST if you use a lightweight desktop environment, such as XFCE. \nOther users have recommended the usage of XUbuntu or Lubuntu but I would go for a plain install of Ubuntu 12.04 and after the painful installation of the operating system, I would invest some time to install XCFE Desktop Environment by dropping sudo apt-get install xfce4 in a terminal. This command will  install only the Desktop Environment, leaving the rest as-is.\nThe next steps will be to start learning how to log into XFCE by choosing the proper Desktop Environment from the list in the login screen and -of course- get familiar to the new Desktop Environment.\nI have tested myself this in a single core component with 1 GB RAM and it does a good work when browsing the net, watching movies (even online), doing some programming, working in documents, spreadsheets, etc. The problem starts when you wish to be doing several things at once. In example: having more than 3 tabs opened in Google-Chrome, listening to music, chatting in facebook chat and working in a document at once. Several things at once will reduce the speed on which the things works on your computer.\nHaving that in consideration I would go for the 12.04 LTS and XFCE.\nI am aware that there are other lightweight Desktop Environments such as LXDE but if you are looking for stability I suggest you to stay in XFCE.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: SSH into shell, get 'Error: Can't open display: (null)' I don't want to open an X11 Session or what not, just to open up a shell to a PC.\nI type in Terminal:\nssh -p 1337 localhost\n\nAfter entering my password, I get the banner, last login, and then the error: \nError: Can't open display: (null)\n\nAlso, if I type in  a command after localhost, it works\n\nA: My bet is that you have something in either .profile or .bashrc that requires X.

The best solution is to continue to build the lwfinger driver as described below and then blacklist the driver included in Ubuntu.\nThat how-to link is outdated; the latest version of the rtl8723au wireless driver can be found at https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723au.\nIn preparation we'll need some build tools and kernel headers:\nsudo apt-get install git build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\nHere are the steps to install:\ngit clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723au.git\ncd rtl8723au/\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe 8723au\n\nWhen you update the kernel, you'll need to run these steps again to get wireless working (except for the git clone).  To fetch the latest version of the code, use git pull. Alternatively you can set up DKMS to do that for you as described in user20826's answer.\nThe bluetooth driver for that chip can then be found at https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723au_bt. Perform the preparation as above and install like this:\ngit clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723au_bt.git\ncd rtl8723au_bt/\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\nA: The author merged in DKMS support a few months ago, but didn't integrate it into the make install process. Following these commands will add it to DKMS so you don't have to manually recompile after every kernel update.\nFrom https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723au/blob/master/README.dkms:\nTo get DKMS to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dkms\nsudo apt-get install dkms\n\n\n*Clone this source to the directory /usr/src/8723au-0.1/\nsudo git clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723au.git /usr/src/8723au-0.1\n\nor if you already had it cloned to [PATH]\nsudo cp -R [PATH] /usr/src/8723au-0.1\n\n\n*Run (as root):\ndkms add -m 8723au -v 0.1\n\n\n*Test a build:\ndkms build -m 8723au -v 0.1\n\nFrom now on this driver should be available for any new kernels.\n\nA: Post #6 here, although it is for a different driver, describes the process to download and install linux-headers and build-essential on a flash drive, transfer them to the Yoga and install them. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2050126  It is cumbersome and tedious, but it can be done.\n\nA: I made a youtube video to walk everyone through this it is at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3WdsSHo5Sw justfollow the instructions in the notes section or watch the video very carefully.\nSorry I just made a new channel and had to change the link\n", "Q: Using text list to batch-rename files Suppose I have a folder with some 20 files (say, photos I took on a trip), and I want to rename them in one go, only there isn't any specific Perl expression I want to use (for example, if I'd like to add additional text to each name that's not part of the individual files' meta-data, such as descriptions and/or comments).\nAnd suppose I can more easily generate a text file with what I want each file's name to be (or, if preferable, a 'before-and-after' sort of list).\nIs there any way to apply the changes implied in that text list to the folder in question?\n\nA: 1. Open the terminal and change directory to the working directory (where the files to be renamed are located).\n2. File names with numbers can alter the sequence therefor zero pad the numbers in file names by running the following code after changing .ext to your extension e.g. .txt .pdf etc.\nrename 's/\\d+/sprintf(\"%04d\",$&)/e' *.ext\n\n3. Put the list file, with the new names in sequential order, with extension, as file.list in the home folder. eg.\nnewname file x.jpg\nnewname file y.jpg\nnewname file z.jpg\n\n4. Run the code below in terminal after changing .ext in the code to your extension e.g. .txt .pdf etc.\nrm ~/undo.sh; for old in *.ext; do read new;  mv -v \"${old}\" \"${new}\"; echo \"mv\" '\"'$new'\"' '\"'$old'\"' >> ~/undo.sh; chmod +x ~/undo.sh; done < ~/file.list\n\n5. An undo.sh file will be created in home folder to undo the renames if needed.\n6. If you don't need the undo file the following code is enough.\nfor old in *.ext; do read new; mv -v \"${old}\" \"${new}\"; done < ~/file.list\n\n\nA: This looks like a job for xargs.\nIf your file is formatted like this:\nold_file1 new_file1\nold_file2 new_file2\n\nthen you can do xargs -a your_file -n 2 mv.\n", "Q: Running BaseX as an upstart job I'm trying to configuring BaseX to run as a service on my server. The basexserver command has a flag -S whose functionality is listed as \"start as service\".\nIf I run basexserver -S at the command line, it outputs Server was started. and returns to the shell prompt, with the server running as a background process. If I then run basexserver stop, it outputs Server was stopped. and returns to the shell prompt, with the server process no longer running.\nNow I want to make this into an upstart job (something which is new to me). I'm not clear on how to translate this start-and-stop interface into an upstart job, particularly with respect to the expect stanza. The Upstart Cookbook recommends a procedure for establishing the fork count of an application; this yielded the number 34, which is well outside the range of expected results.  What's the best way to handle this?\n\nA: basexserver is a bash script. Instead of calling provided bash script you should translate it to Upstart job. The article EVENTING UPSTART will give you good ideas how to do it. \nI would start crafting Upstart job with a simple Upstart stanza exec java -cp BaseX.jar org.basex.BaseXServer.

In other words, Ubuntu assumes a system without anacron to be a server. If that is a problem for you, then you can try removing execute permissions from the anacron binary:\nsudo chmod a-x /usr/sbin/anacron\nsudo chmod a-x /etc/init.d/anacron\n\nThis is because /etc/crontab checks for the presence of anacron by verifying whether /usr/sbin/anacron is executable, and if it is not the daily, weekly and monthly jobs are run synchronously.\n\nA: I see no reason why removing anacron would be problematic. The answer mentioned by papukaija doesn't contain any warnings either. Especially since missing jobs is exactly what you want when time is stepped.\nThe package description says:\n\nYou should install this program if your system isn't\n   powered on 24 hours a day to make sure the maintenance jobs of other\n   Debian packages are executed each day.\n\nSo simply remove it with sudo apt-get remove anacron  (Don't use purge so the config files are kept)\nOne problem remains (as you noticed) - cron sees time steps smaller than three hours as results from something like Daylight Saving Time and still executes missed jobs.\n\nSpecial  considerations  exist  when  the clock is changed by less than 3 hours, for example at the beginning and end of daylight savings\n         time. If the time has moved forwards, those jobs which would have run in the time that was skipped will be run  soon  after  the  change.\n         Conversely, if the time has moved backwards by less than 3 hours, those jobs that fall into the repeated time will not be re-run.\nClock changes of more than 3 hours are considered to be corrections to the clock, and the new time is used immediately\n\nYour possible way around lies in the fact that only jobs with exact execution time are affected.\n\nOnly jobs that run at a particular time (not specified as @hourly, nor with '*' in the hour or minute specifier) are affected. Jobs which\n         are specified with wildcards are run based on the new time immediately.\n\nSo if you want to execute some job every 3 hours\nyou would write a line like\n25  */3 * * * root /path/so/some/file\n\n\nA completely different approach (if you want those jobs run at most once) would be to employ at.\n", "Q: SMPlayer playlist works only sometimes I have uninstalled Ubuntu built in player and instead of it i installed SMPlayer.

Can I tag mp3 file such a way that banshee or rhythmbox music player can recognize the multiple artist separately. Right now the different artist are showing together like Arijit Singh & Harshjeep. I mean banshee is recognizing the whole entry as a separate artist, not individual one. So I can't effectively filter music using artist's name. \n\nA: I can't answer re: Rhythmbox, but this is a known bug in Banshee, and has been for some time.  There is no satisfactory workaround.  Banshee's behaviour is as follows:\nIf there are multiple Artist tags on a file (achievable with, exempli gratia, an external tag-editor) it will concatenate them, using a delimiter to treat them as a single tag.  As I recall, this delimiter is a semicolon, although I could be wrong (I don't actually have a local music library with which to check...).  Banshee will then treat the resultant text (\"artista; artistb\") as the artist tag.\nWhen Banshee encounters an artist tag, including one it's just constructed, that contains a delimiter, it does no special processing on it at all and treats it as the single-artist artist tag.\nYes, it's a pain. No, I don't know what can be done about it.  Sorry.\n\nA: I don't know about you, but the thought of editing tags for several thousand tracks one by one is beyond what I'm willing to do. easytag has bulk editing which allows you to change one field of one or ten or a thousand tracks at once without disturbing any other tags.\n\n", "Q: Qt creator HTML5 project -lsqlite3 I've download the Ubuntu SDK to make apps.

( the other drive is in NTFS format)\nWhen we are \"selecting drive\", does it mean selecting one of C or D or ... partitions?\nAnd what does the space allocation means?\n\nA: If you would like to install Ubuntu alongside Windows on a partition you will need to format your partition. Ubuntu uses the ext3 or etx4 format, unlike Windows which uses NTFS. The installer will handle the formatting.\nIf you have multiply hardrives in your computer you will need to select which disk you would like to install to, otherwise \"selecting drive\" refers to partitions.  \nIf you are using Ubuntu 12.04 you can use WUBI to install Ubuntu on a virtual partition within Windows, however this method is not recommended.  \nIf you just want to try Ubuntu temporarily you can run a live session, running it off of a LiveCD (which you create when you burn the ISO to a disk) and play around with it without touching your existing Windows installation. Just select \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" after booting your installation disk/LiveCD.\nSo to answer your question you will need to format drive G: as ext3/4 before installing, which the installer will manage. \"selecting drive\" usually means selecting a partition to install Ubuntu onto.\nSpace allocation will depend on how your drives are configured and what installation method you are using, however \"space allocation\" in the general term means how much space you give Ubuntu to be installed on and use.\nSee also: How do I install Ubuntu?\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu it will format the partition for you to the Ext4 file system.\n\nA: When you boot up from the Live CD and pick \"install\", you will get to choose whether you'd like to clean your entire drive and just install Ubuntu, if you'd like to install it along side your current OS, or if you'd like to configure it your self with the built-in disk partitioning system.

All help is greatly appreciated!\n\nA: This has happened to me a few times.\nIt usually is a problem with the router, not your wi-fi.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the router from the power outlet and wait 20 seconds before\nplugging in again.\n\n*Reboot your PC also just to be sure.\n\n\nAnother problem can be an IP conflict\nSo you have to reserve a dedicated internal IP address for your computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Access your router using the internal IP (usually 192.168.0.1 if\nusing a DLink device but it may vary)\n\n*Use your user and password (usually user: admin and password: admin or blank)\n\n*Search for Network settings and wherever you notice a table of\nMAC addresses and IP's, you should find a button to \"reserve\"\nIP's.\n\n*Reserve the IPs of devices you recognize as yours.\n\n\nNOTE: Instructions are different depending on the make and model of your router.\nAnd that's it.\n", "Q: Where i can download Ubuntu 13.04 ISO torrents? i want to download ubuntu 13.04 desktop using torrent because speed is faster than normal download, where i can download iso torrent for ubuntu 13.04.\nMy torrent client is Utorrent.\n\nA: Direct links to all Ubuntu 13.04 Desktop ISO torrents:\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 13.04 Desktop (64-bit)\n\n\n*Ubuntu 13.04 Desktop (32-bit)\n", "Q: Is it possible to restore my lost photos from memory card? My memory card was found yesterday, but I found the photos stored in it have gone, is it possible to restore them back? If so, how? Please recommend some affordable program and works for my memory card, thanks. \n\nA: Photorec\nThis software is part of the testdisk  suite, specifically designed to recover images from a partially overwritten or otherwise damaged drive.\nThere is an extremely helpful step-by-step guide written by the makers of PhotoRec which I recommend you follow:\n\n*\n\n*PhotoRec Step By Step\nIn case you have Ubuntu installed you can run PhotoRec in a terminal after installation of the TestDisk suite but you can also do so from a live system as further elaborated in my answer to the following questions:\n\n*\n\n*How do I recover my accidentally lost Windows partitions after installing Ubuntu?\nWe should try to recover our files from an image we created from the memory card by running the following command (see also this question) in a terminal:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/home/<user>/<path>/rescue.dd\n\nReplace sdX with the appropriate value for your memory card, and replace /<user>/<path>/ with your path for the rescued file. Be extra careful to get the command right, dd is an advanced tool!\nWe can then recover files from this image with:\nphotorec rescue.dd\n\n\nA: Deleted or lost files can sometimes be recovered from failed or formatted drives and partitions, CD-ROMs and memory cards using the free/libre software available in the Ubuntu repositories.\n", "Q: Installed packages: what repository are they from?

I'm spinning up some new servers and I'm tempted to make the leap to 13.04 solely because I can install php5 without a PPA. It's not a big deal, it's just a thought.\nI've been using 12.04 for about a year now, it's served me quite well and I learned a lot on it. \nI'm not worried about LTS, these servers will probably be replaced with bigger ones, rotated out, re-configured and re-created a few times a year. \nI use only the remote shell to control the things, so Unity is a zero factor, I know that's a controversy these days so I figured I'd mention it doesn't matter here. \nMy stack is nginx, php5, and mongodb. I also use server side v8js in a few small places... if that is of any relevance.\nAre there any other differences I should be aware of? My first reaction was \"No big deal, newer is better, shouldn't make a difference\" - but I can't find a clear answer anywhere that isn't related to UI. \n\nA: The biggest difference you'll find is the version of packages available for each version.  For example, in Ubuntu 12.04, which is an LTS, installing PHP from the official repositories will give you PHP version 5.3.x.  However, if you move to 13.04 for example, you'll get version 5.4.x.\nYou'll encounter situations like that quite often.  Even things like MySQL, etckeeper, and quite a few other major packages will have older versions in LTS releases.  This is because the LTS release is made and maintained for the type of people that don't want to deal with updates that much, and want to 'set it and (almost) forget it' for a long time.  So you want find the latest versions of packages like that.\nOther than that, as a developer, you'll find newer versions of various libraries.  However, for the common user, this will be a non-factor.\nThat's really about it though.  Ubuntu have not made any recent changes major enough to distinguish 12.04, 12.10, and 13.04 with the operation itself.\n", "Q: FOG & Compiling a Kernel We have been using FOG installed on Ubuntu to image computers and have now started creating an image as a Hyper-V virtual machine (an image created as a virtual machine was a recommendation to us, and we are running Hyper-V hosts so we created it as a Hyper-V virtual).\nWe are having trouble getting the kernel that FOG is using to read the hard drive of the virtual (and it won't pass the Disk check of FOG's Compatibility test), so we assume that the drivers in the kernel don't support what the Hyper-V virtual uses.\nWe have now tried to compile a new kernel (3.10) using the .Config file that FOG supplies and the command sudo make xconfig which brings up a Kernel Configurator, but where it says Microsoft Hyper-V guest support there is no tickbox next to it to include it in the kernel? Have tried ticking Virtualization Drivers and Virtualization, and then compiled the kernel, but it hasn't seemed to fix our problem. We are trying to do this on an installation of Ubuntu 12.04.\nDoes anyone know how to include Hyper-V support in the kernel, and whether or not it will actually be a solution for our problem? Any other ideas?\nPlease bare in mind, we do not know much about Linux/Unix operating systems and have never compiled a kernel before.\n\nA: Not sure if this is still an issue for you but thought I would answer your question anyway. You need to enable Linux Guest support first, I ran into the same issue recently. \nGo to -\nProcessor type and features -> Linux guest support\nEnable that and you will then be able to select the Microsoft Hyper-V options. \nNote: If you do enable the option it defaults to enabling the paravirtualization code so go into Linux guest support and disable it. \nHopefully that fixes things for you. \n", "Q: What is \"openssl binaries\" and \"openssl development package\"? \nBuild it using general C development environment with bash, gcc (3 or\n  4 series), make, etc on a linux machine.\nBuilding pre-requirements are:\n**\n1. openssl binaries;\n2. openssl development package with include files (on debian package libssl-dev);\n\n**\n\n\nA: OpenSSL binaries are provided by package openssl.

Mine is Bios - 3.1 - and key is F2.\n\nA: Every time you restart the computer without letting it rest, Grub will start up faster each time, overtaking the Bios start up menu.\nYou need to cause Grub to delay starting up.\nDischarging the computer worked a treat!\nPC: Power off, unplug then hold the power button for 20 seconds to drain any remaining power.\nPlug it back in, power it back up and Grub will delay starting as if your computer has been switched off for weeks, so it won't completely overtake your BIOS menu. This will give you ample chance to access your BIOS menu. If you miss it, you'll need to unplug and discharge your computer again.\nLaptops: Discharge by removing the battery and holding the power button for 20 seconds.\n", "Q: youtube-dl installed, but not found in dash or applications I have installed youtube-dl(program for downloading videos from youtube) successfully but I am not able to see it either in dash or among application folder. It is listed in software centre and synaptic packet manager. somebody suggest a way out..thanks in advance\n\nA: Youtube-dl is run from the terminal. Open the terminal and type: \nyoutube-dl <URL>  \n\nYou can also show a list of available video formats before you download the video, giving you a choice of different video qualities, by running the following command:  \nyoutube-dl -F <URL>  \n\nType man youtube-dl for information about how to use youtube-dl and options.\n\nA: There is also some nice documentation online:\nyoutube-dl Documentation\nhttp://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/documentation.html\nAs well have a look at the 'built-in' documentation from the command line by running:\nyoutube-dl --help\n\nin a Terminal window and scrolling through the many, many options. My own practice is to convert this Terminal output to a readable text file as follows:\nyoutube-dl --help > youtube_dl_helpfile\n\nThen you can read the resulting output file at your leisure with the text editor of your choice...\n\nA: You can use Youtube-dlG, a multi-platform GUI for youtube-dl. The GUI lets you download multiple videos at once, can automatically convert downloaded videos to audio, lets you select the video quality and more & u can find it from dash :P .See This question for more details.\n", "Q: Can't start ubuntu installation I downloaded the ISO from the official Ubuntu site, burnt the ISO to DVD and on restarting, I get the following error-\n\nstart booting from usb device syslinux 3.82\n\nI've tried to install 13.04 and 12.10, but I've faced the same error.

Do I need to download 12.10 and only then can I upgrade?\n\nA: Yes, you'll need to upgrade to 12.10, then to 13.04. You don't need to specifically download the ISO for 12.10 though, you can upgrade over the network. What you will do is open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type update-manager -d.

You need to configure the web server in such a way that the directory in which nph-proxy.cgi resides or the extension are automatically considered programs. The specifics of the configuration will depend on your web server (Apache, lighttpd etc.).\nOr try to move the file into an existing directory (such as /var/server/www/cgi-bin/) that is already configured for executables.\nTo configure Apache, open the file (with sudo or gksu) /etc/apache/apache2.conf:\ngksu gedit /etc/apache/apache2.conf\n\nSearch whether there is a line like this:\nScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /some/directory/or/another/cgi-bin/\n\nIf yes, create that directory (sudo mkdir /some/directory/blah/blah/cgi-bin/) and put your CGI script there. If not, add this line. Then when you call the URL\nhttp://your.machine.blah.foo/cgi-bin/nph-proxy.cgi\n\nit will be executed.\nAlternatively, you can allow the CGI scripts to be executed in a particular directory. Put the following in your config file:\n<Directory /the/directory/where/your/script/is/>\n   Options +ExecCGI\n</Directory>\nAddHandler cgi-script cgi pl\n\n(check whether the AddHandler line is already in your config!)\n", "Q: Can't find Steam in Ububtu Software Center I am having a problem.

from the above information, lshw can detech 8GB RAM on my system, but the OS cannot.

No issues there.\nI have upgraded the BIOS as well. \nCan anyone help resolve this issue? \n\nA: It can be that (some DDR-)-RAM is newer than your BIOS of your machine. This means that BIOS is not recognizing your RAM correctly - so this RAM than stays \"invisible\" for Linux. A BIOS-update could help.\nAnd overseen something : It can be, that your mainboard does not allow more than 8 Gibi ?! So additional 4 Gibi would not work. Ask the producer of your mainboard.\n", "Q: How do I create a bit identical image of a usb stick? I have a usb stick which is unreadable for some reason.  I want to make an image of it for storage purposes so I can try to retrieve the data from the image at a later date.\nHow would I go about creating such a bit identical image of a usb stick?\n\nThis is the error I get when using dd:\noshirowanen@desktop:~$ sudo dd if=/dev/sdd of=/USB_image\n[sudo] password for oshirowanen: \ndd: reading `/dev/sdd': Input/output error\n0+0 records in\n0+0 records out\n0 bytes (0 B) copied, 1.00783 s, 0.0 kB/s\noshirowanen@desktop:~$ \n\n\nA: Use ddrescue. It will continue after errors, where dd will simply fail. \nAdditionally, ddrescue is in the repos. On 13.04, I typed sudo apt-get install gddrescue\nto install.\nUse sudo fdisk -l or dmesg to figure out the device location eg: /dev/sdb, then run a command such as \nddrescue /dev/sdb /home/user/desktop/bkp.img\n\nthere are many options to ddrescue, and you may want to read the man pages. Also I'm not sure why your hardware is failing, and dumping dd. One bad block could make dd quit, but so could intermittent power failures. dmesg may tell you more about hardware failures you may be experiencing.\nMAKE SURE the device is not mounted! when you try to do data recovery, imaging, etc. This may cause problems.\nThere is a lot of things that can go wrong in data recovery. Post back if you have problems. testdisk is a nice utility for doing data recovery once you have an image.\nJust for clarity, is this a usb hard drive or usb (solid state memory) device?\nI/O errors are typically indicative of hardware malfunctions rather than file-system corruptions. \nAlso try obtaining the SMART data analysis of the device, if it is available. This may tell you things like if the device his been over heating, powered on for a long time, has bad sectors, exposed to more than X no. of Gs etc. \n\nA: dd it!\nUsage would be something like sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=~/USB_image where /dev/sdb is your usb drive as listed by sudo fdisk -l and ~/USB_image is the image file where the copy will be made (a path where the image file will be created).\nTo restore the image to another USB drive just invert the process: sudo dd if=~/USB_image of=/dev/sdb will restore ~/USB_image to the device sdb. Just make sure that the new USB drive is as big or bigger than the original one.\nYou can also mount the image file you just created into a path without need to restore it first to another USB drive with mount ~/USB_image /mnt/USB_image -o loop.\n\nA: You can create an image of an USB stick (or another device) by using dd.\nE.g.\ndd if=<usb device> of=usb.img\n\nYou can add more parameters to dd to optimize the command (e.g. bs).\n\nA: dd, as mentioned by a previous poster, is the native way to go. You'll want it to continue over errors, though, so you'd start it with:\ndd if=<usb device> of=<new file on disk with enough space> bs=<should match your blocksize> conv=noerror,sync \n\nThe important part is the last one: conv=sync tells dd to pad all those blocks it could read only partially with zeroes, so the resulting image may have a few zeroes too many, but will structurally equal the flaky disk, minus its read errors. conv=noerror\ntook care of those read errors, telling dd to continue with the next block. At this point, block size matters, for if it's larger than necessary to skip the error, readable data will be lost here.\nThe Blocksize should always be a factor of two - if in doubt, 512k should do the trick.\nThen I'd suggest to:\n\n\n*\n\n*store an unmodified copy of that image somewhere safe \n\n*fsck a copy of the disk image \n\n*mount the disk image\n\n*check your files - they're readable without trouble now, but some may be\nmissing or be truncated\n\n*If the device itself cannot be read at all, you may be out of luck.\nAlso, if the device happens to contain some proprietary software, it\nmay be setup to return read errors when accessed in the first blocks.\n\n\n(Partially quoting myself from an article written back in 2010)\nIf you don't need to remain native, you could always try tools that are trying to ease the process somewhat, such as ddrescue (package gddrescue) and its companion ddrescueview (sourceforge) to visualize the errors.\n\nA: With regards to the second half of your question \"This is the error I get when using dd\": I can see a couple of possibilities.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note the difference in command you typed versus the accepted answer; you're missing a ~ in front of /USB_image. In other words, you're trying to output the root of your filesystem instead of to your home directory.\n\n*/dev/sdd may not be the correct drive. Run sudo fdisk -l and compare the size of the drive to the known size of the USB stick. For instance, I know this is my USB stick because it's close to 16GB: Disk /dev/sdf: 15.8 GB, 15805186048 bytes.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu server routing table i've a ubuntu server (13.04) with 3 NICs.\nThis is my routing table:\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         vodafone.statio 0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 p1p1\n192.168.8.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 p2p2\n192.168.17.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 p2p1\n\nThe server is on the interet and sees the 2 subnets.\nMy PC is on subnet 17.xxx, i can ping all PCs on the subnet 8.xxx but i can't go on the internet.\nHow can i configure the routing table to redirect my request on the web?\n\nA: If you can ping from one subnet to another, there's no problem in your routing table. Probably packets from local networks are being sent to Internet unmodified. The problem is that private network addresses are not routable through Internet.\nPrivate network addresses must be NAT'ed before sent to Internet.

I got a ssh key in ppk format. I found some manual to convert it to an open ssh key. Now I just want to connect to the server using this key. The manuals I find are all about creating one. Do I have to put the key in the .ssh folder? Or can I include the file in a ssh command?\n\nA: *\n\n*Generate a public key out of the private key you have there (if you don't have it yet) and determine the key type:\nssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/private/keyfile\n\nThis will output something like ssh-rsa AAA[...] (for RSA type) or ssh-dsa AAA[...] (for DSA type).\n\n*Put the private key as a file in ~/.ssh/id_rsa (if RSA type) or ~/.ssh/id_dsa (if DSA)\n\n*Put the public key in place - essentially the same as in the first step, but redirecting the output.\nssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/private/keyfile > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nReplace rsa with dsa if needed.\n\n*Fix the permissions (optional, SSH client may complain if not set appropriately):\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nchmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh\n\nAgain, replace rsa with dsa if needed.\nThe ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub paths are default locations where the OpenSSH client looks for keys. You can set your own location, though, by setting this in your client configuration file, e.g. in ~/.ssh/config.\nHost *\nIdentityFile /path/to/myprivatekey\n\n\nA: The OP already has a key, it is a .ppk which is a format used by Putty. The OP has converted it to an open ssh key already.\nTo use the key, \nFirst, by default, the key should stored in ~/.ssh with permissions of 600 as outlined above.\nSecond, you have two options to use the key. \nOption 1 - Use putty - You can install and use putty in Linux. Putty can use the key in either format.\nOption 2 - Use ssh on the command line\nssh -i ~/.ssh/your_key user@server\n\nIf you have any errors , post them here.\nIf you like, I posted some information on ssh keys from a LUG meeting here - http://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/SSH_keys \n\nA: First, you need to have a pair of keys: a private and a public key. You need to put your public key in the authorized_keys file in the .ssh/ folder on the server to which you wish to connect. This public key will then be used during the authentication process to challenge your private key that you must keep in the .ssh/ directory of the computer which is your client (from which you are connecting to the server).\nYou will, without a doubt, run into troubles. Use the command ssh -v -v -v (yes, verbose option repeated several times increases verbosity) to understand what is going on during the authentication. \n", "Q: MDADM - Degrading when copying files to share We have a Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server which is configured with a 2 disk software 1 RAID (mdadm).  The disks are 3TB and partitioned with a 1MB GPT partition and with the remaining assigned to the RAID.  The RAID partition is then allocated as LVM Volume Group and hosts three logical partition for the /boot, /, swap.  Following the system being built we tested it by removing a disk and all worked well.  We then replaced the disk and re-add the disk back into the RAID. \nWe have now installed SAMBA on the system and are trying to copy 200Gb of data to a subfolder of the root partition.  Every time we do this the RAID degrades and one of the partitions sda2 or sdb2 drops off (removedO). \nI can't see any errors in the logs as to the cause for this.

I set up a private cloud on local following by https://juju.ubuntu.com/get-started/local/ and configured network followed by How do I run Juju on a local server? (The difference is the IP address in my setup is 10.200.xx.xx rather than 192.168.x.x) \nHowever, after juju deploy and expose a charm,the charm state is always pending and public url is null....i don't know the root cause,can anyone tell me some prerequisites of setting up the juju on local, say, do i need to set up a DNS server on the host,etc? Thanks!\n\nA: There are no other dependencies in order to use the local provider with juju.  However there are some caveats and limitations.\nBy default, the local provider will use the lxcbr0 bridge that was created when you install lxc.  This defaults to using the 10.0.3.0/24 address space.  This means that each machine you create will have an ip address of 10.0.3.x.  These lxc machines can only talk to each other, and out to the big wide world using the bridge.\nHowever, no other machines can get in without you messing around with some routing configuration manually.  If you don't know what you are doing there, I highly advise not to try.\nThe question that you refer to above is for the old version of Juju (< 1.0), and hopefully the docs now refer to the new juju (> 1.16).  I'm talking about the new juju.\nExposing a service with the local provider does exactly nothing.  You can see any service locally as there is no firewall service doing anything on the local provider, as its intended usage is to test and try juju and to help with writing charms.\n", "Q: How can I disable the \"No mail\" notice on text-based login sessions? I have had an Ubuntu Server (12.04.2) running for quite some time. I was playing around with WooCommerce on WordPress the other day, and wanted to figure out how to get the email notifications to work. In my endeavors, I installed (and uninstalled; well, apt-get purge'ed) both sendmail and postfix.\nAfter I was done playing, and uninstalling everything I had installed (since I could not get either to work), I noticed that a prompt telling me that I had mail would pop-up every time I logged onto the system.\n\nHow can I get rid of this Prompt? I went many, many months without it, and I don't need it or the mail that it wants to tell me I have. Even better, can I turn off the local mail system entirely?\n\nA: Edit the pam_mail line in the appropriate PAM configuration file. For local logins, this is /etc/pam.d/login. For ssh, it is /etc/pam.d/sshd. Note that this affects all users. By default it uses standard, which does print a message if you have no mail. You can change it to quiet to only print if you do have mail. See the pam_mail manpage for full details.\n", "Q: How to change shutdown script timeout? I have a script running at shutdown of my server, it was added to rc.d scripts with\nupdate-rc.d local.shutdown stop 20 0 1 6 .\n\nThe problem is that this script takes a few minutes to complete it's operations, but the system terminates earlier.\nIs there a config value to set, that will extend timeout given to shutdown scripts?\nI was testing how long will it take to kill a long running shutdown script.\nI have created a very simple infinite loop with:\nwhile true; do\n  time >> /root/watch.txt;\n  sleep 1;\ndone;\n\nthat script logged about 2 minutes of execution before it was killed.\n\nA: I spent longer than intended on that one. My test script that takes two minutes to execute (way beyond my normal restart procedure) is able stall the shutdown and to write data on exit without any problems. Also, theoretically speaking, there should be no problem with your setup. Scripts are run sequentially, your script is at the beginning of the sequence in rc0.d, it should run as expected.\nThe only thing I can think of is that your script exits before a process called from the script has finished. You should run your setup with a test script. And you should check your script (or post it here). Pozdrawiam!\n", "Q: How do I get juju 1.11 to bootstrap on a private OpenStack cloud?

I am new at Linux, and am currently using Ubuntu in a dual-boot with windows 7. I'm trying to install Make such that I can build a program given to me with it. I can SEE the make-3.81.tar.gz, but don't know how to extract it\nFor reference, I have this file in /host/Linux/Make\nEDIT I do not have internet access on this computer\n\nA: As already mentioned in the two comments, you do not need to install your own make program, unless you are looking for a particular version or brand. Most of the tools you need to build your programs are already in the main distribution.\nSince you do not have internet access from your Ubuntu installation, and I assume that you are downloading your programs from another computer, you need to search for the correct .deb package in the Ubuntu repositories. Since I do not know your system version, I cannot give you a link.\nHowever, if you insist on using the make that you have on your computer, you can either just double-click on the file and then extract the archive, or open a terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T) and type \ncd /host/Linux/Make/\ntar xzf make-3.81.tar.gz\n\n\nA: This version of make is available in Ubuntu.\nHow to check whether make is installed or not?\nJust type this into the program \"terminal\" and press enter:\nmake --version\n\nIt will tell you the version of your current installed make or tell you it is not installed.\nIt's not installed.

In order to install ClamAV, open the Ubuntu Software Center and search for ClamTk or run the following command from the terminal:\n sudo apt-get install clamtk\n\nThe Ubuntu Documentation ClamAV wiki contains information about how to use ClamAV. By default the ClamTk GUI front-end displays the names of all infected files, but does not delete them, so you have to delete them manually. If you want to scan for infected files and also delete them automatically, you can do this by running clamav from the terminal according to the instructions in the Ubuntu Documentation ClamAV wiki in the sections of the wiki titled Scan Files and Remove Infected Files.\n\nA: This depends how you have installed your program. If you have installed using your systems package manager, you need to go to the Ubuntu Software Center, search for your program under \"Installed\" and click on \"remove\".\nIf not, then the matter is more complex. It might have been installed in a separate folder (in which case you just have to remove that folder), or it might have its own installer / deinstaller.\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't \"see\" external USB Hard Disk It's NTFS.

(Here's a video explanation)\n\nFirstly let's check if Ubuntu detects the device:\nDisconnect your device then open a terminal and input ls /dev/ | grep sd and Enter. Now connect the device and input ls /dev/ | grep sd again and Enter. Now you should have two outputs. Compare them to each other.\nYou should find an extra line (or two) in the second output.

So, after having no luck using the Additional Drivers application, I downloaded the appropriate NVIDIA driver (NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-310.32.run) from the NVIDIA website. I installed the driver with a little help from this page:\nHow to install NVIDIA.run?\nHowever, the screen resolution was far too low. I tried quite a few different solutions I found online involving xrandr and xorg.conf but they had no effect. In the end I removed xorg.conf which fixed the resolution problem but Amnesia still didn't work and all my other games that previously worked fine would not even start up. Plus whenever I logged into Ubuntu the screen would flash grey for two seconds, which it didn't do before, and the Unity toolbar scrolls down instead of having the extra icons bunched together at the bottom.\nSo I gave up and left it as it was for a while and eventually I downloaded an update that somehow restored things to the way they were before (games worked again, Unity toolbar was back to normal and no more grey flash).\nLater I tried again with a slightly more up to date NVIDIA driver (NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-319.23.run), still with no success and with the same problems as before. I tried a few more solutions but ultimately decided that the NVIDIA driver is more trouble than it's worth (I'll have to download the Windows version of Amnesia), so I tried to completely remove it and restore Nouveau using this method:\nHow can I uninstall a nvidia driver completely ?\nThis still had no effect. Now, when I type\ndpkg -l | grep -i nvidia\nnvidia-common is all that's left but the games still won't run (BIT.TRIP BEAT throws up a message saying \"Fatal Error - failed to create SDL window: Couldn't find matching GLX visual\" but the rest do nothing when I click on the icons), the screen still flashes grey on login and I still have to scroll down the Unity bar.\nSo, how can I get my games up and running again?

I am running Ubuntu 12.04 with Apache module. I opened crontab by executing vi /etc/crontab\nIt says on the top that unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the 'crontab' command to install the new version. So I don't have to run crontab crontab? Even if I am trying to execute it I receive the error\ncrontab: No such file or directory\n\nI added this to the crontab file (there are 4 default jobs there):\n*/1 * * * * root http://www.mywebsite.com/crondemo.php\n\nThis file should send me a mail every minute. The script itself works fine, but the job never runs and I never get a mail.\n\nA: A crontab entry must be an executable shell command. A URL is not an executable shell command. Try */1 * * * * root wget -q -O- http://www.mywebsite.com/crondemo.php instead. wget is a command that fetches a URL. -q tells wget to not print progress, and -O- tells it to output the fetched URL to stdout, which cron will then email.\nIf you want to receive emails from cron, make sure you set MAILTO correctly above the relevant job in your crontab, and make sure that your system MTA works. You can use the mail command to test this.\nThe contents of /var/log/syslog may also help you diagnose cron problems, since cron will log jog attempts there even if it can't email you (provided that your crontab is installed and correctly provides a job schedule).\nFinally, the comment is correct.

You see, the desktop entry specification does not determine the viewer or mime type for a link. A link can be an image, a document, whatever, and the correct viewer will be chosen based on what the file is. And so it happens that this link opens with an editor (and not a browser). You have two options. \nHowever, here is a little change that will result in the correct behavior, although it is ugly. Modify the  desktop entry like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Learning Python\nType=Application\nExec=xdg-open http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9780596805395\nIcon=text-html\nMimeType=text/html\nName[en_US]=Learning Python\n\nIt will look the same, but it will be an application launcher.

I read the instructions for flashing the OS onto a Samsung Galaxy Nexus cell phone. I ordered such a phone. When it came I started to follow the instructions on this page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Install?action=show&redirect=TouchInstallProcess\nI watched a couple of YouTube videos to guide me through the process. One video featured a young man who looked like he knew what he was talking about. He said that the Samsung phone had to be a \"GSM\" something, which the Verizon 4G model is not. \nI have three questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Must the Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone indeed be a \"GSM\" in order to accept the Ubuntu OS?\n\n*If yes, could the instructions be made clearer to indicate this fact, as well as any other facts that civilians (as opposed to professional developers) might need to know in order to flash the OS onto a phone?\n\n*If yes again, does anyone want to buy a slightly used Samsung Galaxy Nexus Verizon 4G cell phone cheap?\nThanks.\n~George\n\nA: According to the page, only the codenames maguro is supported.  You can find out what your device codename is by using this app from the Play store.  \nIt is not entirely mandatory that the phone be GSM, just that the OS images that you receive will be specifically for GSM and if you flash it onto your non-GSM phone, it might not work entirely.  \nYou can flash an unofficial ROM that someone created for their non-GSM GNex, but it might not work and may not be a straightforward process.  It is worth reading through the thread if you decide to go down this route.  You should familiarize yourself with Nandroid, ClockworkMod and the commandline for this - in case the results aren't what you want, you will need to flash your original OS back or flash an alternate like CyanogenMod.\nI have submitted a change to the wiki page indicating 'GSM/HSPA+', pending approval.\n", "Q: IntelPentium4 for Ubuntu Can you please tell what version of ubuntu suitable for Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.80 GHz , 2.79 GHz ,504 MB of RAM computer.  \n\nA: I'd recommend Lubuntu and Xubuntu, these are the more lightweight versions of Ubuntu.    \nLink to their websites, where you can download them:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Lubuntu  \n\n*Xubuntu\nAnd Here you can find a tutorial to install them (just like Ubuntu).\n", "Q: Starting from a USB drive without booting Is it possible to start ubuntu from a USB drive without actually booting from it?\nSorry this question did not seem clear. I have just placed ubuntu onto a 4GB flash drive. the computer I was going to use it on cannot boot from a USB port. Only a CD drive, HDD or floppy.\nso, can I get ubuntu started from the USB flash drive I have just created or do I need to create a CD?\n\nA: If your computer cannot boot from usb, first be sure you checked the bios settings and that usb boot is enabled. It's not entirely clear what your purpose is.\nIf you already have Ubuntu installed, you could use grub to boot the usb -- provided it's a full install on a usb, not the live media. You would just start Ubuntu normally, stick in the usb, then sudo update-grub in a terminal and it will add the usb drive to the boot menu.\nIf you are just trying Ubuntu for the first time, the easiest thing by far is just to make the cd and boot from that. But it is possible to install another bootloader to the usb, such as Plob, that can boot machines that don't have bios support for usb booting.\nMost computers made in the past 5 years should be able to boot from usb. If your goal is to a distro in your pocket than you should be safe with a standard live media. (And best to make it persistent as well.)\nIf you think that you may need to use it on unknown computer that can't boot from usb, then definitely look into Plop.\n", "Q: MAAS / JuJu zookeeper issue I have installed a maas server and created 3 nodes. \nThe MAAS web gui states 3 nodes in MAAS,  3 nodes deployed. \nI created my envirment.yaml file and ran juju bootstrap,  and it said it ran without issue.\nWhen I run juju status all it does is waits for zookeeper but I always get a connection refused.\n2013-07-11 15:52:03,148:2744(0x7f337d7fe700):ZOO_ERROR@handle_socket_error_msg@1579: Socket [127.0.0.1:48855] zk retcode=-4, errno=111(Connection refused): server refused to accept the client\nI have read online that it just needs time but it has been stuck on this for over 24 hours. \nI can ssh to all three hosts from maas,  and zookeeper is up and running on one of the nodes with 2181 listening. \nIf I do   juju ssh 1   then I get the same error.\nAnyone have any idea ?\n\nA: \"3 nodes deployed\"\nIt sounds like you're allocating the nodes in the MAAS ui before running the bootstrap.  Don't do that, it means juju has no machines to allocate to itself.\nUse maas-cli to release the nodes (this functionality is not in the UI yet) and I think bootstrap will then be able to allocate a node, or if not re-run bootstrap.\n", "Q: Is TRIM on by default in 13.04? I've just installed the Ubuntu Raring (with Sandisk Extreme) and I know there're multiple articles over the internet (and here) about TRIM, but I suspect it's a native resource on Ubuntu Raring.\nPS: Tried to find something in the Ubuntu's documentation, but did not.\nThen I've read lots (and lots) of articles and all of them providing different ways to enable TRIM (fstab, cron job, init scripts, etc ..).\nIE: How to enable TRIM?\nAnd I got something interesting -> I've performed those tests (creating testfile / removing / running hdparm) WITHOUT \"discard\" in the /etc/fstab and I got that same results, I got those expected \"zeros\" output.\nThat suggested TRIM test I've uploaded (just in case), http://www.pasteall.org/43964/text\nThat's why I'm wondering -> Is the TRIM active by default on Ubuntu Raring?\nIf not .. any recommended way to active it, among so much options? Thx.\nPS: This is not the same question as the duplicated one.

If you get all zeros you are doing something wrong and you are probably reading the wrong segment or device.\nAt this point remove the file and check again.\nrm tempfile\nsync\nhdparm --read-sector FIRST_LBA /dev/sdX\n\nIf TRIM is enabled you should get mostly zeros, if not you should get the same series of number than before.\nSo, to answer your question, if this test is to be belived Ubuntu is not supporting TRIM by default.\nPersonally I add discard to the fstab options, but many prefers to run fstrim from a cronjob, but this is covered by other threads/answers.\n", "Q: Can anyone tell me what I had to be careful with and how I can reinstall grub?

Can anyone redirect me to a video or webpage where someone explains this grub installation in case of secondary linux OS in details?\n\nA: Think of one distro that you install as being the \"main\" one. Let's assume it's your current Ubuntu. Your goal is to keep this copy of grub in place.\nIn order to keep the copy of grub installed by the main distro in place, don't install a new bootloader over it when doing additional installs. This is actually very simple, but may seem tricky the first time you do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the manual partitioner during the install. \nEvery modern installer will provide an opportunity to set up your own partition scheme. In Ubuntu, this is the Something Else option. \n\n*You will also be given the chance to say where (or if) a new bootloader should be installed. \nIf you have the option to not install the bootloader at all, choose that. \nIf you are forced to choose a location, do not choose /dev/sda. This is the location of grub in your main distro. \nInstead, choose the partition where you are installing /, for example /dev/sda5 or whatever the number is.\n\n*Reboot back into you main distro and run sudo update-grub so grub can see the new install. \nYou only need to reinstall grub if you make a mistake and accidentally install a new bootloader to /dev/sda.

Firefox has an addon called \"Download Video Helper\" -- You can download streaming video with that.\n", "Q: Why do I have to sign into Ubuntu One in order to install Steam? The first time I installed Steam for Ubuntu was during the beta phase, and I can't remember I had to do anything special.  A few months later, I'm now on a fresh install of Ubuntu (13.04) and want to install it again.  \nFirst ascertainment: it seems that APT doesn't know about Steam:\n\nWell, ok, perhaps because it's not a free software there is some repository to add to APT before doing anything. Let's try with the Ubuntu Software Center, which sometimes can find more than APT (no idea why, by the way).  For some reason, it will find Steam !\nBut while it's flagged as a free software, the only option here is to click a \"Buy\" button: \n\nWhen I click it, it sends me to some Ubuntu One login page.  I never had to use Ubuntu One before; I don't even know what it is exactly (some sort of Ubuntu cloud service ?)\nQuestions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Why can I find steam in the Ubuntu Software Center but not in APT ?\n\n*Why the \"Buy\" button right next to the \"Free\" flag (somehow related question) ?\n\n*Why the Ubuntu One sign in ?  \n\n*Is it possible to circumvent it ?\n\n\nA: No it is not possible to circumvent it.  Steam is proprietary software(which is why you have to press a \"Buy\" button even thought it is free)\nYou can make it easier buy clicking Reinstall Previous Purchases in the File menu.  It should then show you Steam but you will still have to sign in to install it.  In fact you should have to sign in to find your previous purchases. This method is easier because it will show you all your previous purchases(if you have any).\nB.T.W. the reason APT and hence Synaptic cannot find it is that you don't have the software source enabled.  \nThe Software Center can see the \"For Purchase\" software, even if you don't have the source available. The process in pressing the Buy  button is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Payment page(you must sign in to get to this page), the payment is skipped if it is free but proprietary software.\n\n*Add the software source to your existing sources\n\n*Do a source update(same as sudo apt-get update command in terminal)\n\n*Install your software from the now available software source\nWhen installing previous purchases it just skips step on and does steps 2-4.  I didn't include it as a step but just like installing any software you will have to enter your admin. password to start the process.  (You have experience in installing software so it was not needed, I only mention it here in case a newbie has the same question;  I would not want them to be confused if I left to vague.)\n\nReinstall may not show Steam if you downloaded the Beta directly from Steam and installed it locally, in which case just \"Buy\" Steam from the Software Center and install it fresh.\nTo the other part of the question.  Ubuntu One is a cloud service but it is also part of the \"Single Sign on\" that allows you to sign in across multiple Ubuntu related sites as well as Ubuntu One's cloud service.  In this case it is used to sign into the subscription record of your account so that you can reinstall the \"purchased\" software without buying it again.  If you have never used it then just create an account via the link in the upper right of the page and then you can install Steam.     \n\nA: I know it's necromancy, but I'll up this post.\nI was looking for a way to circumvent the Ubuntu One account creation to install Steam, and I found this.\nThe idea came instantly to my mind : hey why not take a look on Steam official page. Clicked on \"Install\" and it downloaded a .deb file, launched via Ubuntu Software Center. And voilà ! Steam installed without Ubuntu One account, without repo, without any bug.\nBye !\n\nA: You can also get it directly by typing this in your terminal (tested in 14.04):\nsudo apt-get install steam\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Because steam repository will add to apt list only after authentication , it is not supported in synaptic or other apt frontends except usc \n\n*Because this app is submitted through the my apps portal, actually it is a usability bug\n\n*It is global authentication system for ubuntu services . It is for authentication and to get statitics about software installation\n\n*No direct ways . \n\nA: For what it's worth, I believe that you can get around the Buy button now. I can confirm that I was able to install Steam on Ubuntu 12.04 using the method here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Valve#Alternative_Installation_Methods\n", "Q: no login screen after 12.10 ubuntu update i am running dual boot os machine including windows7 and ubuntu.\nfew days back, i did update to 12.10 version, and at that time i was using gnome fallback desktop environment.  \nwhile doing update, i could see in remove obsolete packages, it removed some gnome related files. and at that time i was using gnome fall-back desktop environment with clear looks theme, because i did not like unity much.  \nwhen i restarted machine, it gave me option to select Ubuntu / windows7, when i selected ubuntu, it showed me ubuntu logo, but from that point, only black screen would remain there, and no login screen would come, no matter how far i waited.  \nusing advance options in menu (and askubuntu/ubuntu forums) i tried following methods, but to no avail.\n\n\n*\n\n*booting to old kernel 3.5 and 2.6/2.4. \n\n*dpkg-reconfigure gdm(and both lightdm), setting it to lightdm. \n and restarting lightdm \n\n*sudo /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults -s ubuntu-2d (no use) \n\n*chown username:username .Xauthority (its already on my username)\n\n*/etc/X11/default-display-manager to say /usr/sbin/lightdm (it was\nalready there)\n\n\nand one more doubt:  \nsome solutions suggest to install and reinstall packages, for e.g\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nhow do i install packages even after enabling networking, if i need a manual login, on web page provided by my ISP for starting internet connection.\nmachine: 32bit, intel pentium 4CPU 3.2 Ghz, Standard VGA Graphics Adapter, 1GB RAM\n\nA: After trying above methods and various online suggestions, (which failed, in my case), I formatted / (root) drive by installing fresh 12.04 LTS edition. This didn't deleted my /home and other data, and nothing was lost except few installed programs (which i installed later on).\n", "Q: What does the 'tail' command do? I'm new to Ubuntu. I previously ran a tail -f /var/logs/syslog and get the following displayed results:\nkernel: [ 2609.699995] [drm:gen6_sanitize_pm] *ERROR* Power management discrepancy: GEN6_RP_INTERRUPT_LIMITS expected 000d0000, was 1a0d0000\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nA: The tail command is a command-line utility for outputting the last part of files given to it via standard input. It writes results to standard output. By default, tail returns the last ten lines of each file that it is given. It may also be used to follow a file in real-time and watch as new lines are written to it.\nTo view the last ten lines of a file pass the name of a file to the tail command.\nTo set the number of lines to show with tail pass the -n option followed by the number of lines to show.\ntail -n 1 /usr/share/dict/words\n\nA: I'd suggest you take a look at the man page of tail.  Just run man tail in your shell, or check it online.\n\nPrint  the  last   10  lines of each FILE to standard output.  With\n  more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file  name. \n  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.  \n-f, --follow[={name|descriptor}]\n  output appended data as the file grows; -f, --follow, and --fol-\n  low=descriptor are equivalent\n\nAnd if you don't know what's man, you can always type man man ;)\n\nA: The tail command shows the last ten lines of a file.\ntail -f displays the last ten lines of the file and monitors the file for any new changes. In other words, it will append any changes to the Terminal as they appear in the file.\nOf course, for more information, run man tail in Terminal.\n\nA: What you've got is the output of your /var/logs/syslog file.\nThat is a file that store information about your system functionality. Those files are used to check what is the reason of a possible system failure. Obviously you will not look at those files unless you have a problem.\nFor further information about this sort of files look at this question: Difference between /var/log/messages, /var/log/syslog, and /var/log/kern.log?\nYou should know that tail is a command, and as others users says, you can know what a command does adding man at the beginning.\n", "Q: AVS / Mediagate GP-IR02BK (TSGP-IR01) Remote and LIRC Trying to get an XBMC HTP up and running using ubuntu as the os.

Does it mean that in my C code I could only have local variable of 8192 bytes?\nI am confused which stack size. Does ulimit -s change when we modify its value?\n\nA: First of all, it is 8192 kilo bytes, and not bytes. Furthermore stack is one thing, variable is another, and heap yet another. See this explanation of differences between stack and heap, for example, or this page. As far as I know stack is used for local and short lived variables, and it depends on the compiler whether stack or heap are used.\nAs far as I can tell, if you use [mc]alloc and friends to allocate memory, you are not touching upon the stack, and the limits do not hold.\nBut yes, trying the following at ulimit -s equal to 8192 will result in a segmentation fault:\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n  char foo[10000000] ;\n  foo[0] = 'a' ;\n  exit( 0 ) ;\n}\n\nHere, the variable foo is too large.\n$ gcc test.c\n$ ./a.out\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nHowever, if you change the ulimit (e.g. ulimit -s 16000), it will work.\n", "Q: Creating tar fills system cache My situation is pretty simple: I backup-ed some of my documents and put them on a NAS and since I rather transfer one big file instead of million small ones, I created a tar\ntar cf backup/2013-07-12-pictures.tar Pictures\n\nMy Pictures directory contains about 12GB of data and what happens is, that my cache fills up steadily. If I tar some more files (e.g. my projects, whatever) it doesn't take long and all of my 32GB RAM are used:\nsheldor:~$ free -g\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:            31         31          0          0          0         27\n-/+ buffers/cache:          2         28\nSwap:           29          0         29\n\nAt this point, although the mouse and the system is in general responsible, starting programs (which reads from disk) takes ages. Literally ages: I have an SSD and starting Chrome which usually takes a second needs now about 2 minutes.\nNow you find all those posts on the internet about that it is bad to clear the cache and so on. Here, on Ask Ubuntu you find such a post too which saved my life by providing the command\nsudo sync && sudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3\n\nIf you read through the comments, you find for instance this here:\n\nThis is not a problem, this is how the page cache works. It will keep things cached as long as possible, but release items automatically when memory pressure from other applications increases. Clearing it up manually is unnecessary. – Caesium Nov 22 '11 at 16:08\n\nWhat? My system (Intel Core i7 3.50GHz × 8, 32GB RAM, NVidia Gtx 590) was frozen after a simple tar. I mean, how much pressure do I have to make before my cache is freed automatically?\nQuestion: Is there a way to tweak settings so my cache gets cleared more often? Or is this just something I have to live with?\n\nA: I agree that cache handling in Linux is far from optimal. In fact, in many regards Linux still feels more optimized for server/workstation use than desktop use. See this Q&A for a similar problem with CPU/IO-scheduling.\nWith that said, there are solutions out there that can alleviate the problem. You can manually clear the cache or set up a cronjob, like user197590 pointed out. Another method would be to disable cache generation for specific applications. You can do so with the nocache utility. At the moment it's only available in the 13.10 repos but I was able to install the Saucy package on 12.04 without any problems.\nnocache is fairly straightforward to use. You prepend it to any command you want to execute without cache, e.g.:\nnocache tar cf backup/2013-07-12-pictures.tar Pictures\nIt's not a causal solution but it can most definitely cure the symptoms of overzealous caching.\n\nA: The use of memory prefetching deamon such as preload is the best possible solution I've found.\nIt does the same as MS Windows prefetch mechanism.\nFrom preload website:\n\npreload is an adaptive readahead daemon. It monitors applications that\n  users run, and by analyzing this data, predicts what applications\n  users might run, and fetches those binaries and their dependencies\n  into memory for faster startup times.\n\nPreload is for sure in 12.04 default repo, so\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\nAnd that's it. Preload will learn what apps are you using and take care of filling the cache with right files.\nI've used it on HDD and SSD PCs with a great effect.\n\nA: You can manually free up the memory cache with the following simple command:\nsk@sk:~$ sudo sh -c \"sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\"\n\nHowever, if you want to force the Linux OS to clear the memory cache on a particular interval, just add the command to cron job. Here, I show you how.\nOpen up your terminal and enter the following command to create a file called cacheclear.sh. Say for example, I create cacheclear.sh file in my /home directory:\nsk@sk:~$ sudo vi /home/cacheclear.sh\n\nAdd the following lines to cacheclear.sh file:\n#!/bin/sh \nsudo sh -c \"sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\"\n\nSave and exit the file. Now add this file to the root crontab:\nsk@sk:~$ sudo crontab -e\n\nThis command opens the root crontab.\nAdd the following line to the end:\n0 * * * * /home/cacheclear.sh\n\nSave and exit the file. Once you’re done, the cron job will run this command every hour and will clear the system memory caches.\n", "Q: Bandwidth Limits for App File Downloads I have an Android app that teaches users Spanish/Russian/Italian. Basically the\napp is a series of 10 audio lessons. To keep the app size small, I'm included none of the audio files in the binary (APK) file.\nSo users are prompted to download each file, one at a time. Can I use ubuntu1 for this purpose? \nWhat if I used 1TB/month of data, is this allowed in the free Ubuntu One service?\n\nA: Ubuntu One is not a file hosting service, no. If you want to host a download for your project, and your app is open source, you can create a project for it on https://launchpad.net/, create a release, and upload a file to be downloaded for each release.\n", "Q: Pantheon Not Completely Installed? I have just installed the pantheon shell today, and I have not found any help with this yet. I am not just a random noob, i use a bunch of other shells and i also have a few development applications on my copy of ubuntu.

(if the launchpad is the app drawer up in the upper left corner, or if its the dock. i have it, if thats not what launchpad is, then i cant access it.) I can only change my wallpaper by going back to unity, gnome, or KDE. There is a system settings in the power menu (upper right), but it only has Language Support, Ubuntu One, Additional Drivers, And Printing. I can still access the full ubuntu settings in GNOME of Unity. But thats it. I installed in the terminal, uninstalled, and reinstalled using the software center.\nPlease Help Me If Any Of You Can!\nThanks!!!\n\nA: *\n\n*Install dconf-tools.\n\n*Open dconf-editor. Go through the tree org.pantheon.cerbere.\n\n*Remove \"pantheon-wallpaper\" if present and add 'nautilus -n', 'gala' if its missing.\n\n*Now right click, set as background etc should work.\n\n\nAlso, open from terminal: switchboard .

To do so just select the server platform of your choice.  Once downloaded, open terminal, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, navigate to the folder where the file was downloaded, and run the command(s) below:\nFor 64bit\nsudo dpkg -i couchbase-server-enterprise_x86_64_2.1.0.deb\n\nFor 32bit\nsudo dpkg -i couchbase-server-enterprise_x86_2.1.0.deb\n\nFor instructions, see the Couchbase docs, or the Manual\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on 24GB mSSD Hardware Acceleration Cache I bought an HP ENVY TouchSmart 15t-j000 Quad Edition Notebook PC laptop with a 24GB mSSD customization.

There are no error messages but is clear to me it is not progressing.\n\nIs there any way to fix this? Iǘe never had this problem before and don know if is secure to kill the process.\nThanks\n\nA: This is not a problem. Any *-installer package downloads it's contents during install due to licensing restrictions. For your case, you may want to use package adobe-flashplugin instead of flashplugin-installer.\nAnyway, if you want to use installer version, you have to check your network settings, and be sure that command wget <url> works proper.\n", "Q: question about dual-booting/partitioning? I'm looking into partitioning my hard drive between windows 8 and linux ubuntu. I've never done anything of the sort, so i'm wondering how it works.\nIf I save files while I'm running it as Ubuntu, will I be able to access those same files if I'm running it as Windows 8, say, the next day?\n\nA: Ubuntu and Windows use different partition types. Windows cannot normally read ext4 partitions.\nMy solution to this is to create an extra NTFS partition where I keep my documents, pictures etc.\nI modified /etc/fstab to automount this partition on boot.\nThen I modified the ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs file to point them to the folders in the extra partition.\nI did a similar procedure to tell Windows where are my documents, pictures etc folders.\n\nA: It takes some work to see files in Ubuntu from Windows, but from inside Ubuntu it's really easy to access your Windows file structure.  And you can always store things online using Dropbox, Google Drive, or (I think) Ubuntu One.\n", "Q: NVIDIA driver won't install under 13.04, wants to reboot without X, not so easy NVIDIA complains that it cannot install with x running.\nAll I want to do is kill the X server, but I can't do that.  If I kill it, it simply restarts.  I found an article claiming I could change the grub parameter of the kernel to:\ntext_$vt_handoff\nbut this doesn't work with 13.04, it boots as usual into X.\nI tried init 1, but it warned me not to install in single user mode either.\nI would probably prefer the proprietary NVIDIA driver, though this process is difficult and seems much, much worse than it used to be under Fedora Core 4, a giant step backward in ease of installation.  Why is it so hard to come by instructions for something so mainstream?  Why is it now so hard to shut down the X server?\nAs an alternative I would be willing to use the nvidia_current package, but want to be able to use dual screens, twinview to nvidia.  Does the open software driver support that?  Does it also support rotating monitors by 90 degrees?\n\nA: The several features you are asking are supported in the Proprietary Drivers. For your case you need to follow How do I install the Nvidia drivers?\nThe open source Nvidia (Nouveau) drivers does not yet support Twinview, rotating correctly or Dual screen in all Nvidia models. For the time being, we Nvidia users are stuck with the proprietary drivers.\nPlease follow the link I have mentioned and let us know if doing the steps provided in it solves your problem. Know that if you are trying to install the Nvidia drivers that are found on the Nvidia site I recommend to not do that (It is explained on the link as to why not to use the official one from the Nvidia site). Use the ones that come in the PPA if you really want to have the most stable and updated version available for Ubuntu.\n", "Q: vsftp configuration issue i have installed vsftpd in my local mechine ubuntu 10.04 also in remote server ubuntu 12.04\ni have done same configuration for both of the mechines. but in server when user logs in \nusging ftp client he can view all directory including root,etc,var .... i would like to \nshow only his home directory , following is my vsftpd configuration. kindly advise.\nnote : chroot_local_user=YES\n# Example config file /etc/vsftpd.conf\n#\n# The default compiled in settings are fairly paranoid.

I believe TLS 1.1 is now supported, but you still won't have TLS 1.2.\nSecond, build and maintain your own PPA. There are some instructions for doing so at Override Distro Package with Custom Package? For completeness, there are no existing Personal Package Archives for Ubuntu and OpenSSL that offer the full protocols.\nThird is upgrade to a later version of Ubuntu, like Ubuntu 14.

Command line 'jar -vxf file.war' will extract file.war to the current folder, but command line 'jar -vxf file.war -d /folder/destination' does nothing, which means there is nothing generated under folder destination.\nIs it possible to set the destination folder for jar command line.\n\nA: Jar file is zip file.

Then realised that this is probably a better place.\nI have bluepill setup to monitor my delayed_job processes. (Ruby On Rails application)\nUsing Ubuntu 12.10.\nI am starting and monitoring the bluepill service itself using Ubuntu's upstart. My upstart config is below (/etc/init/bluepill.conf).\ndescription \"Start up the bluepill service\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nexpect daemon\nexec sudo /home/deploy/.rvm/wrappers/<app_name>/bluepill load /home/deploy/websites/<app_name>/current/config/server/staging/delayed_job.bluepill\n\n# Restart the process if it dies with a signal\n# or exit code not given by the 'normal exit' stanza.\nrespawn\n\nI have also tried with expect fork instead of expect daemon. I have also tried removing the expect... line completely.\nWhen the machine boots, bluepill starts up fine.\n$ ps aux | grep blue\nroot      1154  0.6  0.8 206416 17372 ?        Sl   21:19   0:00 bluepilld: <app_name>\n\nThe PID of the bluepill process is 1154 here. But upstart seems to be tracking the wrong PID. It is tracking a PID which does not exist.\n$ initctl status bluepill\nbluepill start/running, process 990\n\nI think it is tracking the PID of the sudo process which started the bluepill process.\nThis is preventing the bluepill process from getting respawned if I forcefully kill bluepill using kill -9.\nMoreover, I think because of the wrong PID being tracked, reboot / shutdown just hangs and I have to hard reset the machine every time.\nWhat could be the issue here?\nUPDATE:\nThe problem remains as of today (3 May 2015) on Ubuntu 14.04.2 .\nThe problem is not because of using sudo. I am not using sudo anymore. My updated upstart config is this:\ndescription \"Start up the bluepill service\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\n# Restart the process if it dies with a signal\n# or exit code not given by the 'normal exit' stanza.\nrespawn\n\n# Give up if restart occurs 10 times in 90 seconds.\nrespawn limit 10 90\n\nexpect daemon\n\nscript\n    shared_path=/home/deploy/websites/some_app/shared\n\n    bluepill load $shared_path/config/delayed_job.bluepill\nend script\n\nWhen the machine boots, the program loads up fine. But upstart still tracks the wrong PID, as described above.\nThe workaround mentioned in the comments may fix the hanging issue. I haven't tried it, though.\n\nA: Quite late, but hopefully this can be of help to other users.\nThere is a documented bug in upstart which can cause initctl to track the wrong PID if you specify the incorrect fork stanza in an upstart config: https://bugs.launchpad.net/upstart/+bug/406397\nWhat happens is that upstart checks the fork stanza and determines how many forked processes it should check before choosing the \"true\" PID of the program being controlled. If you specify expect fork or expect daemon but your program does not fork a sufficient number of times, start will hang. If, on the other hand, your process forks too many times, initctl will track the wrong PID. Theoretically, it should be documented in this section of the upstart cookbook, but as you can see in this situation there is a PID associated with the killed process when there shouldn't be.\nThe implications of this are explained in the bugtracker comments, but I'll summarize here: besides initctl not being able to stop the daemon process and being stuck in an undocumented/illegal state <service> start/killed, process <pid>, if the process belonging to that PID stops (and it usually will) then the PID is freed up for re-use by the system.\nIf you issue initctl stop <service> or service <service> stop, initctl will kill that PID the next time it appears. This means that, somewhere down the road if you don't reboot after making this mistake, the next process to use that PID will be immediately killed by initctl even though it won't be the daemon. It could be something as simple as cat or as complex as ffmpeg, and you'd have a hard time figuring out why your software package crashed in the middle of some routine operation.\nSo, the issue is that you specified the wrong expect option for the number of forks your daemon process actually makes. They say there is an upstart rewrite that addresses this issue, but as of upstart 1.8 (latest Ubuntu 13.04/January 2014) the issue is still present.\nSince you used expect daemon and ended up with this issue, I recommend trying expect fork.\nEdit: Here's a Ubuntu BASH-compatible script (original by Wade Fitzpatrick modified to use Ubuntu sleep) that spawns processes until the available process ID address space is exhausted, at which point it starts back at 0 and works its way up to the \"stuck\" PID. A process is then spawned at the PID initctl is hung up on, and initctl kills it and resets.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# usage: sh /tmp/upstart_fix.sh <pid>\n\nsleep 0.001 &\nfirstPID=$!\n#first lets exhaust the space\nwhile (( $! >= $firstPID ))\ndo\n    sleep 0.001 &\ndone\n\n# [ will use testPID itself, we want to use the next pid\ndeclare -i testPID\ntestPID=$(($1 - 1))\nwhile (( $! < $testPID ))\ndo\n    sleep 0.001 &\ndone\n\n# fork a background process then die so init reaps its pid\nsleep 3 &\necho \"Init will reap PID=$!\"\nkill -9 $$\n# EOF\n\n\nA: For the provided example:\n$ initctl status bluepill\nbluepill start/running, process 990\n\na quick solution for me is:\n# If upstart gets stuck for some job in stop/killed state\nexport PID=990\ncd /usr/local/bin\nwget https://raw.github.com/ion1/workaround-upstart-snafu/master/workaround-upstart-snafu\nchmod +x workaround-upstart-snafu\n./workaround-upstart-snafu $PID\n\nsource: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=582745#37\nI hope this will be helpful. What is going on is explained in the other answers.\n\nA: Unless you are running an Upstart user level job or using the setuid stanza - then your job is running as root. \nSince Upstart is already running as root, why do you need to use sudo at all in your exec stanza?\nUsing sudo or su in the exec stanza have caused the same problems for me as you describe here. \nTypically I will experience item 1 OR both 1 AND 2: \n\n\n*\n\n*upstart follows the incorrect PID\n\n*upstart hangs when I try to stop the process\n\n\nOf course, additionally you must have the expect stanza reflect the correct number of forks. \nYMMV, but for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*using sudo or su in the exec stanza with the correct number of forks specified generally results in situation 1 above.\n\n*incorrect number of forks specified (with our without sudo/su in exec) results in situation 1 AND 2 above.\n\n", "Q: How to return back after Alt+Ctrl+Esc Can anybody help me?\nI did Alt+Ctrl+Esc in Ubuntu and deleted every thing in desktop and bottom.\nHow can I return back to my desktop?\n\nA: I tried Ctrl+Alt+ESC and it does not do anything. \nMy guess is that you did not hit Ctrl+Alt+ESC, but Ctrl+Alt+F1 (ESC and F1 are just next to each other). That takes you to a command line interface. Just hit Ctrl+Alt+F7 to get back to your desktop environment.\nBy the way: you can access command line interfaces with Ctrl+Alt + either of the following keys: F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6.\n", "Q: Where are the pristine, untouched contents of a ~/.profile file?

I suspected that I have seen via distrowatch.com/ubuntu in packages list that using stable version. I prefer to use a stable version like (4.0.2) than release candidate (4.0.2.2).

If the player is flash, sound is not good. If it is not, sound is just horrible. But if I press mic button, sound is perfect!!\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: I would suggest going to Sound Settings and try adjusting them. The bad sound might be an issue that can be fixed through the laptops' settings... If you have tried this, please let me know for further details. \nRegards, \nAnthie G.\n\n\nA: For the laptop, I just put a small binder clip over the microphone button, keeping it permanently pressed. Problem is most new ear bud come with the microphone, so you may have to shop around.\n\nA: It is very simple. The headphones with mic aren't compatible with the only headphone jack.\nThe headphones with mic used with phone has 4 step. The standard configuration is either CTIA or OMTP. The tip is audio L, next step is audio right, 3rd step is ground (or may be mic) and 4th step is mic (or ground).\nOn the other hand the headphone jack only compatible with 3 pin, audio L, audio R and ground. \nThe reason you get horrible sound because of those last two steps. When you press the mic button, it shorts the ground with mic which intern makes your headset act like earphone without mic.\nThis is not related anything to ubuntu. Pure hardware issue. You need to get a 4pin to 3 pin spliter like below, or if you're having this similar problem on a mobile try the second picture \n2\n", "Q: Upstart doesn't produce any log on Ubuntu Raring I've just installed Ubuntu 13.04 and added custom upstart scripts. These scripts work well and are already in use on other hosts (not Ubuntu).\nThe problem is, upstart doesn't produce any log of what it does. The only logs are daemon output logs in /var/log/upstart/. When jobs are started or stopped, no log are created. When a job is killed or exits 1, it is respawned, but there is no log of the respawn event in /var/log/*. log-priority is message, but setting it to debug doesn't change anything.\nHow can I have upstart produce logs of what is does on raring ?\nThanks for your help.\nArthur\n\nA: I've posted an answer to a similar question: https://askubuntu.com/a/490900/297973. Long story short, the messages should show up in dmesg, and you may need to add $KLogPermitNonKernelFacility on to rsyslogd's config to see them in /var/log.\n", "Q: How do I bookmark sections in a PDF file converted from Libre Office? I have an .odt document I have converted to .pdf, with many different sections, subsections, subsubsections, etc.. In the PDF I want to create a nice bookmark table to easily navigate the document.\nThe good part is the sections I need bookmarked are either bolded or italized which is different from all text of the document. Presently I'm bookmarking one by one which will take a number of hours but I have no idea where to look for a program to do this task or how to start with scripting this.\nEven a program on Windows would help - I guessing it's against the rules to mention Windows, but by some off-chance something like this exists it would save me hours. I'm assuming it doesn't and the only way would have to be by way of a script into a pipe. So if anyone knows how to go about this it would be most appreciated.\n\nA: Use Headings!\nYou shouldn't be using bold and italics for the sections/subsections. Bold and italics should be used to emphasize text only.\nTo denote the different levels of the document, use headings. When you convert to PDF they will be autobookmarked for you.\nIn LibreOffice:\nTo the left of the dropdown menu for fonts is a dropdown for applying different styles. Use heading 1 for the highest level sections, heading 2 for subsections, heading 3 for subsubsections, etc.\nYou can modify the style of each of these headings easily by using the \"Style and Formatting\" toolbar. Press F11, find the style you wish to edit, right-click and select \"modify\".\n", "Q: Changed hostname, closed before changing hosts, now sudo is broken, catch-22!

All I need to do is change the name in hosts, but of course I can't do that without sudo.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: SOLVED:\nYou should be able to fix it from the recovery console, you will need to remount the filesystem with rw permissions and then use a commandline editor e.g. after dropping to the root shell,\nCode:\n# mount -o remount,rw /\n# nano /etc/hosts\n\nand make your changes...

While it's possible to make per-application settings by editing lubuntu-rc.xml as described here, a GUI approach may be preferable.\nUnfortunately, OBApps isn't available in Ubuntu's repos but is available as a .tar.gz from here.

I have more than one partition (4). Should I remove some before partitioning to fit Ubuntu (windows 8)?\nI am keen to dual boot Ubuntu 13.04 onto my windows 8 HP laptop. I would like to install it onto USB, then boot it up and try it then give the OS its own partition.\nIs it safe to have more than four partitions and then add a fifth? I am not a particularly 'techy guy, so laymens terms please!\n\nA: The 4-partition limit is an issue on disks that use the old Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system. Computers that ship with Windows 8 almost invariably use the newer GUID Partition Table (GPT), which has a much higher limit -- 128 partitions by default, although that can be raised with the right software. (Even MBR-based disks can have more than four partitions, but one of the four primary partitions must be an extended partition, which in turn can hold an arbitrary number of logical partitions. Getting this set up on a system that already has four primary partitions can be a pain.)\nIf you've re-installed Windows, or if your system came with Windows 7 and you subsequently upgraded to Windows 8, it's conceivable you'll have to deal with MBR's 4-primary-partition limit. If you want to be 100% sure of what you've got, you can check your partition table type, as described here.\n\nA: It is perfectly fine to have the number of partitions you have. Just make sure you have enough free space for your Ubuntu installation. It is good idea to have >= 10 GB free somewhere. \nIf you are manually partitioning during installation, you would be allocating this space to /, /home and /boot mount points and perhaps some others. Again you can have as many of these, apart from the three necessary ones, as you want.\nAs you are dual booting with Windows 8, you might not be able to access these ntfs partitions right away from Ubuntu. In that case refer to this: Unable to mount Windows (NTFS) filesystem due to hibernation\n\nA: Have 4 or 5 partitions seems to me not the problem should just make sure that your pc have enough memory to do what you want to do.\nIf it has enough memory no problem.\nRegards David\n", "Q: Reliably check if a package is installed or not I have a simple requirement. I want to define several variables that will correspond to any number of given packages I want to install via a shell script.\nSample code below:\nMISC=\"shutter pidgin\"\nWEB=\"apache2 mongodb\"\n\nfor pkg in $MISC $WEB; do\n    if [ \"dpkg-query -W $pkg | awk {'print $1'} = \"\"\" ]; then\n        echo -e \"$pkg is already installed\"\n    else\n        apt-get -qq install $pkg\n        echo \"Successfully installed $pkg\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nEverything kinda works, but the logic seems flawed because it's not reliably installing the packages I want. It either says they've been installed already or it's trying to install packages that have already been installed previously.\nI've also been trying with command -v or the following:\nif [ \"dpkg -l | awk {'print $2'} | grep --regexp=^$pkg$ != \"\"\" ]; then\n\nAnd even with the -n and -z flags to check if the returned string was empty. Pretty sure I'm missing some good sense here.\nDo you have any idea what I could do to make sure a package is actually installed or not?\nThanks!\n\nA: You can test it by dpkg-query:\nif dpkg-query -W -f'${Status}' \"$pkg\" 2>/dev/null | grep -q \"ok installed\"; then\n\nNote that * and ? are wildcards, if they appear in $pkg. I guess dpkg-query may print \"reinst-required installed\" instead of \"ok installed\", if package is broken and needs to be reinstalled by command apt-get install --reinstall which can be used to install new packages as well.\n\nA: Essentially you only need to replace the if condition with\nif dpkg --get-selections | grep -q \"^$pkg[[:space:]]*install$\" >/dev/null; then\n\nIt is not possible to use dpkg-query, because it returns true also for packages removed but not purged.\nAlso I suggest to check the exit code of apt-get before giving the successful message:\nif apt-get -qq install $pkg; then\n    echo \"Successfully installed $pkg\"\nelse\n    echo \"Error installing $pkg\"\nfi\n\n\nA: #to check package is installed or not without distribution dependency\n#!/bin/bash\nread -p \"Package Name: \" pkg\nwhich $pkg > /dev/null 2>&1\nif [ $? == 0 ]\nthen\necho \"$pkg is already installed. \"\nelse\nread -p \"$pkg is not installed.

If I change the file group to www-data so that it looks like\ntest.php me:www-data 770\n\nthe file loads fine.  The problem is that I upload the files over ftp under the user me.

This won't work because the process would be killed if the computer restarted, and I might look in the program's memory to find the string.\n\n*Let the program change the root password to the randomly-generated string, removing root access from me; let it store the string in a file that only root has r/w access to, and let root repeatedly run a program which checks whether the period is over, and if so, give me the string (and thus root access). This sounds like it would work, but removing root access would be inconvenient and I'd have to reinstall Ubuntu every time something went wrong.\n\n\nThe reason I need to do this is that I have an addiction to internet porn. Most of the time I can control it, but I get cravings late at night. This is even harder because I use a computer for my work and I work from home.

What I want to do instead is to generate a password for dhclient (by encrypting dhclient, or just creating a zipfile with that password), and then only have the password given back to me the next morning. Basically I'm trying to find a commitment device, a bit like an alcoholic pouring his liquor into the sink.\nThere might be a really easy way to do this that I'm missing - please tell me any ideas you have.\nAny help with this will really be appreciated!\n\nA: A physical measure may be easier to implement and cumbersome enough to circumvent.\nFor instance, a proposal would be: Plug in your router and modem into a power strip, plug said power strip into a timer device , then lock the entire setup in either a closet or a cupboard, such that only a power and network cable come out (by \"network\" I mean what you'd plug into the modem, be it a phone line or a coaxial cable). Have someone else (neighbor, relative) keep the key, in case you need to fix things. The timer will control when you have access to the internet. Again, this is possible to circumvent, but cumbersome: unless you have extra equipment, or go into such a rage that you thrash the closet or cupboard to gain access, you should be well-covered and need not mess with the computer itself (which is a good idea since you need it to work).\nTo implement this entirely on the computer,  first I'd do some research to locate the most low-level component you need to disable in order to remove all internet access (perhaps the network card driver? the ifconfig and ip commands?). Then you could gpg encrypt that component with a randomly-generated symmetric key, and schedule an e-mail to be sent to you later with the key, so you can reenable things. You need some sort of service where once you schedule the e-mail, you have NO way of looking at it or changing it (so something like a calendar reminder may be out of the question). Perhaps one of those e-card services where you can schedule card sending.\n", "Q: Underclocking (overclocking) Nvidia card I have a GTX295 Nvidia card which sadly won't run on stock clock frequencies any more, I did a brief inspection of the PCB and reapplied the TMI. It just turns itself off for some odd reason after 2-3 minutes in games, though benchmarks run perfectly fine even if overclocked.\nAnyway I switched from Windows to Linux for reasons. In windows there were applications made by the card manufacturers that allowed you to adjust whatever you wanted, pretty much, in Linux however this is not as simple as I had hoped. I switched to a proprietary driver, 304 I believe, followed instructions on how to do the Xorg.conf with Coolbits 'hack' which unfortunately resulted in no change at all. I couldn't get NVclock working too. \nDoing research I read multiple times that they pulled overclocking ability on Linux. I'm not exactly sure whether that is true. Playing games such as Team Fortress 2 with the Nouveau driver results in a blank screen, the proprietary one works good enough, but I can't enjoy a game for more than 5 minutes due to the card being broken.\nI haven't done something like that on a Linux machine ever before and I would appreciate guidance in my quest.

I need the user to be able to input an integer, restricted to values between 0 and an upper bound. The upper bound is too big to fit within the 'int' data type so I have used a 'real' data type with a DoubleValidator. \nThe DoubleValidator doesn't properly restrict the upper bound whereas an IntValidator with an int value works as expected.\nIntValidator example\nThis restricts the entered text to integer values between 0 and 1000:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\n\nMainView {\n    id: main\n    width: 500\n    height: 500\n\n    TextField {\n        id: tf\n        text: \"0\"\n        anchors.centerIn: parent\n        validator: IntValidator {\n            bottom: 0\n            top: 1000\n        }\n    }\n\n    property int value: 0+tf.text\n\n    Label {\n        id: label\n        text: \"\"+main.value\n    }\n\n}\n\n\nDoubleValidator example\nThis restricts the entered text to integer values (doubles with 0 decimal places) and ensures the value is greater than or equal to 0.

I've used all my web search skills to make sure this question wasn't already asked. So here is my unique situation.\nMy 320GB hard drive had 5 partitions - let's call them A, B, C, D and E\n­٠A: Windows 7\n­٠B: Ubuntu 10.10\n­٠C: Linux Swap\n­٠D: Ubuntu 12.10\n­٠E: Linux Swap\nAfter formatting all Linux partitions and installing Ubuntu 12.04, the state of my hard drive is:\n­٠A: Windows 7\n­٠B: Ubuntu 12.04\n­٠C: Linux Swap\n(The purpose was to simplify the hard drive and remove unnecessary OSs.)\nI had used Tomboy notes on Ubuntu 12.10 (Partition D). Before all the formatting, I thoroughly checked all folders and backed up the necessary ones on external hard drive. Since the tomboy notes folder is hidden, I forgot to back it up.\nNow I have some very very important entries in Tomboy notes. I need them badly. I'm willing to pay a decent sum to anyone who recovers those notes. That's how desperate I am. I'm unable to concentrate on my studies because of this.\nMy question:\n1. Is the recovery of my Tomboy notes even possible?\n2. If yes, what is the best way to go about it?\nN.B. I have decided not to use Tomboy notes again.\nEdit:\n1. When I used the \"deep search\" option in testdisk, it did detect all the old partitions - A to E. How can I exploit this?\n2. I have stopped using my computer to avoid overwriting the existing data.\n\nA: First stop using your system because you might overwrite recoverable data! The most likely situation is that your data is gone because with the new install you will have probably already overwritten the files. There is however a small chance you will be able to recover the data. \nRead this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery .\nCreate an Ubuntu live usb with persistence: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick .\nBoot from the live usb and install testdisk (sudo) apt-get install testdisk on it. Use the photorec package wich is part of testdisk to try to recover your files (sudo) photorec. Photorec will ask you after selecting proceed and pushing enter on wich partition to run. Choose your Ubuntu 12.04 partition. Make sure you have an external hdd to put the recovered files on. This is your best chance but it is a small chance.\nUse testdisk partition recovery only on an image or clone of your disk. If you use it on the original it will mess up your current partitions. So you need an external hdd as big as or bigger then your current 320Gb hdd. Ideally you create the image and make two copy's of it to have the possibility to try out different recovery methods and be able to mess them up without losing date because you will have another image to work on. Before you really use testdisk read man testdisk (type in terminal: man testdisk) and this information: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step . On askubuntu there are a lot of questions about testdisk, search for them, they might be helpful e.g. this one: How do we find out if the partition table recovered with testdisk is OK? .\n", "Q: Openoffice didn't install correctly, how do I remove it? I attempted to install openoffice with the packages that the openoffice site automatically got for me which were incorrect; RPM files insead of DEB files. The problem is after attempting to install the wrong files and the going back a trying to reinstall with the right files Ubuntu thinks there is already a working version of openoffice, which there isn't. I tried to remove it the way you would if it was the correct installation and working, that hasn't worked. So is there any way to remove every thing related to openoffice so I can try again?\n\nA: You want to install aptitude first on your Ubuntu system. Run this command in Terminal to install aptitude.\n    sudo apt-get install aptitude\n\nOnce that finishes, you can purge openoffice and remove it completely with this command:\n    sudo aptitude purge openoffice.org\n\naptitude will remove all dependencies that were included with openoffice. This is why we are using this instead of apt-get.\n", "Q: Why is Unity not as smooth with the proprietary Nvidia driver as with open Intel? I have a Thinkpad W520 with Intel HD3000 onboard graphics as well as an Nvidia 1000M graphics chip, and I'm running Ubuntu 13.04. I experience a rather big difference in how smooth Unity appears with Intel vs. Nvidia. \nAlthough games run much better with the dedicated Nvidia card, Unity seems to like the Intel graphics better. This is especially noticeable when minimizing/maximizing windows and using the exposé feature, as well as other effects. Why is this? You would suppose the better graphics card leads to better Compiz performance, but this does not seem to be the case.\nI'm not really talking about Unity being slow, but instead a bit laggy, as I'm dropping frames, with Nvidia that is.\nIt's not a Optimus problem as I'm lucky to have a BIOS that allows me to choose whichever I prefer.\nAre there any fixes or improvements that I can do to improve my Unity appearance and performance with Nvidia graphics?\n\nA: The short answer is that the proprietary drivers are optimized for running proprietary software (ie games), and the open source drivers are optimized for running open source software like Unity and Gnome Shell, and optimizing for one thing tends to make everything else slower.\nUnity actually runs smoother with Nouveau (the open source Nvidia driver) than it does with the restricted driver. Unfortunately games do not (if they run at all). The reason is complex. Optimizations used for windowing systems are different to the optimizations used for games, and so it often comes down to the developers choosing one or the other.\nUnity, and window systems in general, don't need a particularly powerful graphics card. They don't need hundreds of shaders like games. Instead they need a very specific subset of operations to be as fast as possible.\nGames are typically proprietary and written for Windows where only the proprietary driver is available. Therefore game developers target this driver. As a result the proprietary driver is commonly used by gamers, and Nvidia optimizes it to make games run fast.\nOn the other hand, Unity and Nouveau and Intel are open source. Unity targets the open source drivers because it is easier to get their bugs fixed and because they don't need to run on other OS. The open source drivers are not used much by gamers and so they don't get optimized for games (and so gamers don't use them... and so on.)\nAs for what you can do to fix it: Not much unfortunately. Not using Compiz is the one thing that seems to make a difference, but that also means not using Unity, and the difference isn't that big.\n(If you're really seeing a HUGE amount of lag, and not just a minor annoyance, then you have an actual problem with your system.)\n", "Q: Comparing Virtual Memory Size with Resident Size I came across this stackoverflow post:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/10400751/how-do-vmrss-and-resident-set-size-match\nThe answer voted correctly states the following:\n\"So, VSS should be greater than RSS. If they are close to equal, that means your process is sitting comfortably in memory. If VSS is much larger, that means there isn't enough memory and parts of it have to be swapped out to disk (i.e., because of a competing process, etc.).\"\nThat statement confuses me a lot because when I inspect my system, I notice the following. \nFirst, I notice I have a lot of free memory:\n$ cat /proc/meminfo\nMemTotal:        6113156 kB\nMemFree:         3668992 kB\n\nThat means I have 3.5 gigabytes of pure memory (no swap, no disk, etc)\nHowever, when I look at my spawned apache2 child processes, I come to a surprise:\n$ ps aux | grep apache2\nUSER       PID  %CPU %MEM  VSZ  RSS     TTY   STAT START    TIME    COMMAND\nroot      1130  0.0  0.1 149080 10600 ?

I mean, for example, for the apache parent process (the parent process is 1130):\n$ ps xao pid,ppid,pgid,sid,comm | grep apache2 \n 1130     1  1130  1130 apache2\n23211  1130  1130  1130 apache2\n23440  1130  1130  1130 apache2\n27038  1130  1130  1130 apache2\n27041  1130  1130  1130 apache2\n27183  1130  1130  1130 apache2\n27242  1130  1130  1130 apache2\n27349  1130  1130  1130 apache2\n27405  1130  1130  1130 apache2\n27456  1130  1130  1130 apache2\n27457  1130  1130  1130 apache2\n\nThat parent process is taking up 146 megabytes of virtual memory compared to 10 megabytes of resident memory. That is a difference of 136 megabytes of swap space being used! \nSo this doesn't make sense to me. I have so much free memory, but it's using so much more swap space?? According to the post on stackoverflow, he says \"means there isn't enough memory\". Well that's not true. I have plenty of memory.\n\nA: The \"swapped out\" conclusion the SO post makes is wrong. For example, here is a trivial program:\n#include <sys/mman.h>\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <fcntl.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"Started - sleeping 10s; pid = %i\\n\", (int)getpid());\n    sleep(10);\n\n    int fd = open(\"10469068800-byte-file\", O_RDONLY);\n    void *map = mmap(NULL, 10469068800, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);\n\n    printf(\"Mapped - sleeping 10s; fd %i to %p\\n\", fd, map);\n    sleep(10);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWhen I check ps after it prints out the started message (before the mapped message):\nanthony@Zia:~$ ps u 13420\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\nanthony  13420  0.0  0.0   4080   348 pts/13   S+   16:10   0:00 ./test\n\nand after:\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\nanthony  13420  0.0  0.0 10227780 348 pts/13   S+   16:10   0:00 ./test\n\nPart of the program's address space is currently on disk, but that's because its a memory-mapped file which has not yet been read (or may never be). A similar thing happens with this program:\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"Started - sleeping 10s; pid = %i\\n\", (int)getpid());\n    sleep(10);\n\n    void *mem = malloc(1024*1024*1024);\n\n    printf(\"Allocated - sleeping 10s; mem at %p\\n\", mem);\n    sleep(10);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBefore:\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\nanthony  15150  0.0  0.0   4080   352 pts/13   S+   16:18   0:00 ./test2\n\nAfter: \nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\nanthony  15150  0.0  0.0 1052660  352 pts/13   S+   16:18   0:00 ./test2\n\nIn this case, the memory has been allocated but, as an optimization, the kernel doesn't actually put actual pages of memory behind those addresses until the program uses them. So, again, you see a much higher VSZ than RSS.\nYou're probably seeing the above two things (and maybe a few more) in Apache. You can use pmap -x to tell. Here is what the second program (the malloc one) looks like:\nanthony@Zia:~$ pmap -x 15997\n15997:   ./test2\nAddress           Kbytes     RSS   Dirty Mode   Mapping\n0000000000400000       4       4       0 r-x--  test2\n0000000000600000       4       4       4 rw---  test2\n00007fba82f94000 1048580       4       4 rw---    [ anon ]      <--- HERE\n00007fbac2f95000    1672     300       0 r-x--  libc-2.17.so\n00007fbac3137000    2048       0       0 -----  libc-2.17.so\n00007fbac3337000      16      16      16 r----  libc-2.17.so\n00007fbac333b000       8       8       8 rw---  libc-2.17.so\n00007fbac333d000      16      12      12 rw---    [ anon ]\n00007fbac3341000     132     104       0 r-x--  ld-2.17.so\n00007fbac3533000      12      12      12 rw---    [ anon ]\n00007fbac355f000      12      12      12 rw---    [ anon ]\n00007fbac3562000       4       4       4 r----  ld-2.17.so\n00007fbac3563000       8       8       8 rw---  ld-2.17.so\n00007fffb7163000     132      12      12 rw---    [ stack ]\n00007fffb71fe000       8       4       0 r-x--    [ anon ]\nffffffffff600000       4       0       0 r-x--    [ anon ]\n----------------  ------  ------  ------\ntotal kB         1052660     504      92\n\nNote you can see the anonymous mapping which is huge but has almost nothing resident.

I'm using Ubuntu 13.04 desktop on a PC with two NICs.\nSo I have installed dansguardian and squid and I also installed the full dnsmasq package so I can use it as a DHCP server. These are the same packages ClearOS uses. My setup is working well except for one issue.\nIn dnsmasq.conf, I statically assigned 192.168.1.4 to the MAC address of my PC. I do this because I configured the proxy/content filter to allow myPC to bypass the filter, based on its IP address.\nHowever, I turned off myPC and went to another PC (call it kidsPC) and manually configured kidsPC with the same address (192.168.1.4). Oops, kidsPC can bypass the proxy/content filter. \nWith ClearOS, when I did the above, the gateway would not allow traffic from kidsPC to the internet. It somehow detected that I've already statically assigned this address to another device's MAC.\nIs it possible to mimic the ClearOS behavior? Is there a setting I'm missing? The forums at ClearOS don't seem eager to help me. I've googled and can't find an answer.\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: I certainly am no expert in using squid, but i think you might benefit not using the ip address in the acl proxy/content filter, but use the MAC instead.\nI presume you have something like the following to identify your computer:\nacl myPC src 192.168.1.4\n\nTry to change it to the following (where the 00:00:00:00:00:00 is your MAC-address)\nacl myPC arp 00:00:00:00:00:00\n\nThis way the IP does not really matter, only the MAC is used as a criteria.\n", "Q: Black screen after trying to fix password I went to fix the password and the entire screen took me to a BIOS type of black screen.

I have several logical partitions, but the Ubuntu installer shows me only 4 primary partitions. When I run the Ubuntu live CD I have access to all of the logical partitions.\nHow do I fix it?\n\nA: Some third-party Windows partitioning tools can convert a disk from the proprietary \"dynamic disk\" (aka Logical Disk Manager, or LDM) configuration to a conventional system with primary, extended, and logical partitions. IIRC, both EaseUS Partition Master and Partition Wizard provide this functionality. Also IIRC, there are free or demo versions of both tools. I'm not very familiar with either of them, though, so I can't help beyond providing the preceding links.\nOnce the disk is converted to a conventional partitioning setup, the Ubuntu installer should be able to resize the partitions and create partitions for Linux.\nBe aware that partitioning operations are inherently dangerous. Thus, I strongly recommend that you make a complete system backup, or at least back up your critical personal data, before using these tools or resizing your Windows partition(s).\n", "Q: Trying to export xinput information for remote display in 12.04 I am trying to run xinput --list on a remote machine.

I created a system user through adduser command for use in an application I installed. This user is supposed to run application-specific processes and such (think of postgres system user doing nothing but running postgres related stuff)\nBecause this user doesn't do anything except do the application's bidding, is there a way to prevent a human from logging in with this user? This user isn't part of any groups (so I don't have to worry about ssh logins or other group perms). I have read that not having a home folder will help prevent logins, but I needed a home folder for this user because that's where I compiled/installed the application.\nAside from preventing a human from logging in to this user account, is there other security considerations to consider?\n\nA: You just need to lock the account so that no valid password can be entered:\nsudo passwd -l username\n\nNow login to this account with a password is disabled, but login via su (from a process running with root permissions (such as sudo -i)) or ssh-keys (which you have probably not enabled) would still be possible. I don't recommend disabling the account completely because the programs you need it for could not run.\nYou could accomplish almost the same by editing /etc/shadow with  the command sudo vipw -s (vipw locks the file to prevent corruption and calls your favorite CLI editor) and replacing the string after the first colon with !.\n mysysuser:!:15819:0:99999:7:::\n\nIf you take the second route it's advisable to back up /etc/shadow (in case of a mistake). One way is sudo cp /etc/shadow /etc/shadow.old. Once the new configuration works, remove the backup (sudo rm /etc/shadow.old), as it may be regarded as bad to have extra unnecessary copies of users' password hashes lying around (once a password is changed the hash should go away so old hashes cannot be cracked to gain access to other systems where old passwords may still be set).\n\nA: There are two things you should do to prevent people from using this user account like a \"real human user account.\"\nSince no one ever has to log in as this account for any purpose, the first and most important thing you should do is to ensure password authentication can never succeed. guntbert's excellent answer explains this in detail. In summary, you can run:\nsudo passwd -l user\nSeparately from that, it's also a good idea to set the user's login shell to something that performs no operation and immediately quits:\nsudo chsh -s /bin/false user\nThat way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logging in as the user using a mechanism other than password authentication (such as key-based authentication) to obtain a shell will typically fail. However, it may still be possible for some SSH-related functionality to work.\nFor example, if key-based authentication is enabled for the user, someone can still use it to authenticate and open an SSH connection for scp or sftp or to create an encrypted tunnel, and might possibly access other functionality.\n\n*Attempts to simulate a login shell will typically fail. However, someone who can run programs as root or who has some non-password-based way to authenticate as the user can still often run a non-login shell, which provides the same capabilities as a login shell.\nFor example, setting user's shell to /bin/false will prevent su - user and sudo -i -u user (among others) from working, even if run as root. But they will not prevent su user, sudo -s -u user, or sudo -u user bash (among others) from working when they are run as root.\nClearly, disabling the login shell of a user who already cannot log in via password authentication and who does not already have key-based authentication configured does not confer a great deal of security benefit. So, why do it? Because:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is likely to help remind users who do have administrator powers to think twice before logging in (or simulating a login) as user.\n\n*Setting a user's shell to something nonfunctional is a convenient and usually effective way of showing anyone reading /etc/passwd that the user does not represent a human being and is not intended to be impersonated interactively.\n(In Ubuntu and other modern Unix-like systems /etc/passwd stores account information but not the actual password hashes--those are in /etc/shadow. /etc/passwd can be viewed by all or most human users on the system, including non-administrators.)\n\n*If for any reason password authentication is re-enabled for the user, then the user's login shell being nonfunctional does typically afford a substantial security benefit.\n", "Q: SSH—Can't reach iphone root folder When using Nautilus Connect to Server to connect with an iPhone over SSH, it takes me to a location that just has the Media and Library folders.

The laptop came with a pre-installed version of windows 8. I somehow managed to install ubuntu 13.04 on it and it was working very well. But, I needed to work on windows as well, so I used the boot repair to start windows 8.\nIt successfully worked. Here is report - http://paste.ubuntu.com/5868906/\nWhen I logged on to windows8, it made a update and there after on restart it did not show the grub. I used boot-repair again but it does not work. I am unable to see grub and hence log into ubuntu.\nHere is the report generated from boot-repair - http://paste.ubuntu.com/5869002/\nYour help will be much appreciated.\n\nA: It looks like your GRUB file (grubx64.efi) is missing from the ESP; or perhaps Boot Repair isn't finding it for some reason (I've heard of this happening on occasion). You've also got a number of errors relating to your ESP; summarizing a few of them:\nmkdir: cannot create directory '/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu': Input/output error\n[  382.544276] FAT-fs (sda2): error, fat_get_cluster: invalid cluster chain (i_pos 0)\n[  382.544283] FAT-fs (sda2): Filesystem has been set read-only\nError: no grub*.efi generated. Please report this message to boot.repair@gmail.com\n\nOverall, it looks like the filesystem on /dev/sda2 is damaged. You should repair this. In Linux, the dosfsck utility can do the job, as in sudo dosfsck /dev/sda2. If that doesn't work, you should back up all the files, use mkdosfs (or GParted) to create a fresh FAT32 filesystem on /dev/sda2, and restore the files to the filesystem. You may also need to change the UUID= value in /etc/fstab to refer to the partition by the new \"UUID\" value if you re-create it.\nThis type of problem can be caused by the Windows \"fast startup\" feature, which might as well be called the \"don't play nice with other OSs\" feature. Basically, instead of shutting down properly, Windows uses a suspend-to-disk type of feature. This leaves its filesystems in an inconsistent state, which can then cause filesystem damage if anything but Windows is booted next. You should disable this feature to make it safe to dual-boot with Linux; however, be aware that this will result in longer Windows boot times. In fact, you might want to do this before using dosfsck on the ESP, or run dosfsck again after disabling the fast startup feature, just to be on the safe side.\nOnce you've fixed the filesystem and disabled Windows' fast startup, you'll be left with the issue of getting booting to work normally. It appears that your GRUB file has been removed. Running Boot Repair again will probably fix this; however, I'm not a fan of Boot Repair. It takes a rather heavy-handed approach that can cause further problems down the road. If you run Boot Repair, open the Advanced Options and uncheck the \"Backup and Rename EFI Files\" option. This will rein in Boot Repair's overzealous changes. If the result doesn't boot, though, you may have one of the rare computers that actually needs this type of hackish workaround, so you may need to run it again without disabling this feature.\nAnother option is to try my rEFInd boot manager. You can try booting with the CD-R or USB flash drive image. Chances are that will boot successfully even as your computer is right now (damaged ESP and all). If it works and you like rEFInd, you can install the Debian package; but do this only after disabling Windows' fast boot feature and repairing the damage to the ESP's filesystem.\n", "Q: Why can't I use my @ubuntu.com mail address to register an Ubuntu One account? When I try to do so, it tells me:\nThis email address cannot be used.\n\nA: I got that same error when attempting to use mine. I then found an email in my inbox that said.\n\"We've received a request to create a new account with tgm4883@ubuntu.com, however an account is already registered with this email address.\"\nSo then I used the \"Forgot your password?\" link and I received an email at my ubuntu.com address to change my password. What is odd is that the link to reset my password was for my primary email address that is listed in launchpad (which is where ubuntu.com forwards to).\nSo my guess is that when Ubuntu One sees an email address for a ubuntu.com account, it queries launchpad to find the actual email address that it should use. It then links both email addresses to the same account.\n\nA: Because you already have an Ubuntu One account.\nIn order to have an ubuntu.com e-mail address, you must already have an account on Launchpad. An account on Launchpad is indifferent from an Ubuntu One account. You simply need to log in, rather than attempt to register a new address.\nWhether you log into Launchpad, Ubuntu Wiki, Ubuntu One, or the Software Center, it's all the same account.

I am also including some steps if you would like Windows on here as well.\nInstall Ubuntu First\nBefore installing Ubuntu, make a clean MSDOS Partition table. You should be able to do this with gparted in Ubuntu (Go to Dash and search for it). When installing Ubuntu, make sure to select \"Something Else\". (If you want Windows, for your partitions, parition a drive for Windows, but do not use /dev/sda1)\nInstall Chromium OS Second\nWhen installing Chromium OS, install to a USB first, and then copy the contents of the USB through gparted in Ubuntu to the hard drive. Make sure to put the partition (C-STATE) on /dev/sda\nInstall Windows Third (if triple booting)\nInstall Windows to whatever partition you made when installing Ubuntu earlier.\nFinal Steps\nBoot into live Ubuntu and re-install grub. Do not boot into the Ubuntu that you installed.\nLastly, boot into Ubuntu on the hard drive and run sudo update-grub in Terminal.\nWhen you restart, you should see the two (or three) operating systems that you installed in the boot loader.\n\nA: If you are not installing clean, and want to Install Chrome OS AFTER you have installed Ubuntu, you can follow the steps as shown here \nhttp://blog.championswimmer.in/2016/01/multibooting-chrome-os-on-your-laptop\nBascially you need two partitions - ROOT-A, 2.15GB ext2 and STATE 4GB or more - ext3/ext4\nCopy the contents of the ROOT-A and STATE partitions of your Live USB (using dd to the corresponding partitions on your Hard disk, and run update-grub2 \nYou need to edit the value of STATE_DEV in /sbin/chromeos_startup in your ROOT-A partition to make it point to a device other than /dev/sda1\n", "Q: Second WiFi card stopped all WiFi I have Broadcom BCM4313 internal Wireless.

I think it's all in the syntax of your command line statements. If you have the path to your files wrong than it won't work. It took me a while to work through the instructions but in the end I figured it out and it works. So any one reading this post just take note. And if you mess up you have to clean the mess up as mentioned in the link. I had to mount another on of my macbooks with a live cd to get the file needed. Moved it to a usb drive and then to my Ubuntu Studio. My paths where different than the instructions have and I had to figure that out before it worked. You have to make the script file and have it as part of the startup. They explain that but I didn't have the program installed so I had to install it to. I'm running 12.4 with latest updates FYI.

(This can be added to the ubuntu-html5-app-launcher command in the shell and by setting the run configuration in the SDK). \nWith the --inspector argument, the app's shell output shows an IP address and port. You can open this URL in a WebKit browser (chromium-browser, for example) and you will see an \"inspectable view\" that includes a JavaScript console that you can use to see warnings, errors, and to debug. This allows you to use browser-based HTML tools you may already be familiar with.\nHere's an example launching the app from the shell:\n$ ubuntu-html5-app-launcher --www=HTML5_APP_PROJECT_DIR --inspector\n\nHere is the part of the output with the URL that you need to find:\nInspector server started successfully. Try pointing a WebKit browser to  http://192.168.1.105:9221\n\nAs noted, you can also configure the Ubuntu SDK to do the same thing. Check out the  Projects > Run Settings area and configure the Run Configuration like this:\n\n\nA: The trick is to use WebKit's remote inspector.  Here's how I got it working in QtCreator 3.0:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Google Chrome if you don't already have it.  (I believe Safari also works.)\n\n*In QtCreator, click \"Projects\" in the left column, then click the \"Run\" tab at the top.\n\n*Next to \"Run Environment\", click the \"Details\" drop-down.\n\n*Click \"Add\" to add a new environment variable.\n\n*Set a variable named QTWEBKIT_INSPECTOR_SERVER and set the value to any unused local port number, for example 9999\n\n*Run your project\n\n*Open Chrome and enter the following URL: http://127.0.0.1:9999\nIt may take a moment to come up.  If the URL isn't working you can use a tool like Microsoft TCPView (on Windows) to make sure your process has the port open.\nThe trick to enabling the remote inspector in Qt comes from this post: https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-qt/2012-April/002646.html\n", "Q: Trying to install Ubuntu 13.04 alongside Windows 7 I installed Ubuntu 13.04 alongside the existing Windows 7 OS.

Thats good.\nHowever, it is mounted as \"root\" and I want to mount it as my current user. Is there any way to make it mount not as root through some configurations or do I have to do it as a command?\nThanks\n\nA: Software to run exFAT\nDepending on the version of Ubuntu or Ubuntu based operating system you may or may not need to install the following program packages,\nsudo apt-get install exfat-utils exfat-fuse\n\nSee this link for more details,\nHow do I copy a file larger than 4GB to a USB flash drive?\nMounting exFAT\nMany versions of Ubuntu and Ubuntu based operating systems will mount Microsoft file systems (FAT32, exFAT, NTFS) with read/write permissions automatically for root as well as the current user.\nBut some versions (of Ubuntu and Ubuntu based operating systems) will mount them with write permissions only for root (or not at all). Then you can unmount and remount (mount) the file system with commands like this,\nCreate mountpoint (only if you want a new mountpoint)\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/sd1\n\nUnmount (only if already mounted)\nsudo umount /dev/sdxn   # general syntax\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1   # modify to match your case\n\nCheck your userID's uid number (it is usually 1000, sometimes 1001 or 1002 ...)\ngrep ^\"$USER\" /etc/group\n\nand use that number if you want to grab ownership (default is root).\nExample of mount command line that should give you something that is close to what you want,\nsudo mount -o rw,users,uid=1000,dmask=007,fmask=117 /dev/sdxn /mnt/sd1  # general syntax\nsudo mount -o rw,users,uid=1000,dmask=007,fmask=117 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sd1  # modify to match your case\n\nSee this link for more details,\nHow to change default permissions on automounted usb flash, formatted in NTFS?\n\nA: It seems like the default automount behaviour which is provided by gnome features does not have so much possibility for configuration.\nWhat you want to do, is you add mount option umask=0, which can be done if configured in /etc/fstab like this:\n/dev/sda1 /media/usbdrive exfat rw,async,umask=0 0 0\n\nThis kind of goes against the automount concept though, since it means static configuration. \nIt could probably be achivied by using automount and autofs though:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Autofs\nIf you chose this path, then you should disable the automount option in gnome:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount/USB#Configuring_Automounting\n", "Q: Avoid duplicate pids while grepping for a pattern I have written a shell script that reads the updating logs and sends an email notification when there are OOM using do while loop. \nI am able to get the email notification for OOM errors but every time a duplicate PID is getting generated for the email sent which is creating a huge no. of duplicate pids while I am grepping for that particular process/ Admin server (weblogic).
