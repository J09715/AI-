["Q: Why ubuntu software center, synaptic and terminal are not able to download anything? I am using ubuntu 12.04LTS. From past few days i am not able to update and downlaod anything. The ubuntu software center crash everytime I open it. Synaptic also got the same problem and the terminal show some sort of repository error while downloading and updating ubuntu.\n\nA: Most likely a problem with the repositories, such as a PPA being removed and is no longer available.  Have a look at the answer to this question:\n", "Q: Steam-Linux behind a proxy server I just downloaded Steam Beta from here.\nI installed the package, and when I start steam, I get the following\nIt then says, unable to connect.\nWhen I start it from the terminal, I get this error.\nSteamUpdater: Error: Download failed: http error 407\nSince I get a 407 error, it is related to Proxy Authentication.\nI have set up my http_proxy, ftp_proxy, https_proxy environment variables. I am behind an authenticated proxy server.\nHow do I get Steam working from behind a proxy server?\n\nA: You can use proxychains.\nvim /etc/proxychains.conf\n\nplace your proxy information like this:\n#socks4         127.0.0.1 9050\nsocks5          127.0.0.1 1080\n\nThen run steam like this:\nproxychains steam\n\nI hope this work for you.\n\nA: First off the Steam client doesn't use the proxy for anything other than updating the client.  The rest of the steam communications is all UDP based.  You will not be able to play games via a proxy server.\nFor the updates you can use a proxy, but in general to use Linux applications behind an Authenticating proxy server, you need to get the authentication details supplied to the proxy server.  Most often this is Microsoft NTLM type authentication.\nIn the rare case that it is not, you can authenticate to the proxy by means of the following syntax:\nhttp://username:password@proxyhost:port/\n\nExample:\nhttp_proxy=http://john:TheSecret123@my.proxy:8123/\n\nFor most people though that will not be enough.  To add the MS proxy authentication tags to the outgoing packets you need a program like cntlm.  Cntlm is a small proxy server that runs as a service on your local machine.  You point your applications to this proxy server.\nThe Cntlm proxy server needs to be set up with the following details:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Parent (upstream) proxy server address and port\n\n*The User Name and Domain Name for Authentication\n\n*Either the Password or (recommended) a hash of the password, and the authentication method.\n\n\nThis is done by editing the cntlm config file, usually /etc/cntlm.conf to provide the required details.\nIf you want to use a hash cntlm provides a way of generating one.\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure cntlm with the parent proxy address, port and user name and domain name.\n\n*Restart cntlm, e. g. via /etc/init.d/cntlm restart\n\n*Run cntlm -IM http://test.com\n\n*You will be prompted for your password.  It will test the password against the proxy server and display the rest of the information to be added to the cntlm.conf file, for example:\njohan@Komputer:~$ sudo cntlm -IM http://test.com\nPassword: \nConfig profile  1/4... OK (HTTP code: 200)\n----------------------------[ Profile  0 ]------\nAuth            NTLMv2\nPassNTLMv2      A12B34C56D78E90A12B34C56D78E90A1\n\nAdd those two lines as they appear to the /etc/cntlm.conf file (removing any other that may conflict)\n\nA: I simply made a steam-proxy.desktop file with the http_proxy env var set as such\nExec=env http_proxy=http://192.168.43.1:8080/ /usr/bin/steam -tcp %U\nI saved it under ~/.local/share/applications. \n You can find the full file under /usr/share/applications/steam.desktop\nbeware that steam runs in the background and changes don't take place until it's killed and restarted.\n\nA: Steam does not work on the default HTTP ports (80, 443).\nRead up on it on the steam website.\nYou have to enable additional ports on the proxy server; It seems to be possible, but not supported.\nWhere it is stated that it is not possible is here.\n\nA: You are not allowed to run Steam trough a proxy. The Steam Subscriber Agreement states:\n\nYou agree that you will not use IP proxying or other methods to disguise the place of your residence, whether to circumvent geographical restrictions on game content, to purchase at pricing not applicable to your geography, or for any other purpose. If you do this, we may terminate your access to your Account.\n\nNot really helpful, I know, but i just wanted to let you know.\n\nA: Even though your http_proxy variable is set, if you launch it via GUI it will not work. But if, from the same terminal where echo $http_proxy outputs http://username:password@server:port you launch the command steam, everything works fine - at least it does for me.\n\nA: You can get it working via tsocks, If you are running 64 bit be sure to compile a 32 bit version.I've got it running successfully via putty over an ssh tunnel.store won't work but downloads do.Good luck!\n", "Q: Is there a way to generate the gnome3 effect when pressing the super key on xfce I've switched to xfce from gnome3.

If you have no audio from the speakers but do have audio through the jack, see the Headphone Jack FAQ.\nIf you just re-installed your operating system and do not have audio, go directly to Section 7 of the Audio Driver FAQ.\nI. General Steps\nPerform these general steps in any order.\n\n*\n\n*Configuration Settings\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the volume is not turned down or the speakers muted. Open the Sound properties and check each setting for proper configuration. In addition, each audio application or player you use will have its own settings. Use a common audio file player when testing audio, such as Windows Media Player instead of itunes for example, and play files from the hard drive, not off the internet. The idea is to keep it as simple as possible in order to reduce potential configuration issues and problems with the applications themselves.\n\n\n*Check the default audio device setting and make sure it is set to your device (Sigmatel, IDT or Realtek) and not usb audio, HDMI, etc..\n\n[...]\n\n\n\n*Re-install the Audio Driver\n\n*\n\n*Do a simple reinstall. Open the Device Manager and find the audio driver under Sound Controllers (it will be named Sigmatel, IDT, Realtec, or Crystal). Right click on it then click \"uninstall\" and do not select the option to delete the files. Restart the computer and Windows will reinstall the driver. The reason this process fixes some \"no audio\" problems is because it resets the driver configuration to its default settings.\n\n\n*Install fresh driver files. Go to the Dell driver folder on the hard drive. The location is  c:\\dell\\drivers\nExpand all folders and all subfolders there. Delete all folders that have a subfolder named \"WDM\". Those will be the audio driver folders and it is safe to delete them.\nNext download a new audio driver package from your computer's driver downloads page. Go to the Driver & Downloads Home Page and follow the links to select your laptop model and its operating system. Expand the 'Audio' category and download the audio driver named Sigmatel, IDT, or Realtec. Do not download anything named \"Creative Labs\" at this time. Next, unzip the files and install the driver. When you unzip the files they will be unpacked by default to a new folder on the hard drive at c:\\dell\\drivers\\Rxxxxxx -- similar to the one(s) you deleted except that it will have fresh files and it will be the newest version of the driver if you did not already have that.\nII. Hardware Diagnostics\nIf the general steps did not help, do a diagnostic analysis of the computer to discover the problem area which is the cause of the symptom. Diagnosing \"no audio\" is a process of eliminating potential problem areas and eventually narrowing down to one problem area. These hardware tests can narrow the problem down to either the software or hardware. This is important to know because if the hardware is shot then no number of software solutions will fix the problem and will just just be a waste of time. When doing the tests do not use usb headphones or usb speakers.\n\n*\n\n*Sense Pin Test. Connect headphones or external speakers to the output jack and listen for audio. The reason for this test is that if audio comes through the jack but not through the internal speakers, that is one of the symptoms of a failed sense pin in the jack which is a hardware problem that the audio tests in Dell Diagnostics will fail to detect, so you have to test for it specifically. If this test does produce audio from the jack but not the speakers then see the Headphone Jack FAQ to find out how to complete the diagnostic. Note however that the failed sense pin problem will only occur on Dell laptops with HD audio (all models built in the last 6 or 7 years), not the older models with the AC97 hardware codec.\n\n\n*Dell Diagnostics Audio Tests. These tests are designed to narrow the problem area down to either the hardware or software, and will detect the existence of any hardware failure except the failed sense pin mentioned above. If the computer cannot pass these tests then there is no need to attempt any software solutions. Do not confuse these tests with the PSA tests which will run first but will not definitively test the audio hardware. See the Dell Diagnostics Audio Tests FAQ for more details and instructions.\n\n\n*Original Factory Configuration. If the Dell Diagnostics audio tests cannot be run then an alternate test is to return  the computer to its original factory configuration. This is usually done as a last resort solution, but it is also a diagnostic tool because if it does restore audio functioning then the problem area is the software, and if it does not restore audio functioning then the problem area is the hardware. To return  the computer to its original factory configuration for diagnostic purposes, use PC Restore for XP, or Factory Image Restore for Vista and 7. The instructions are in the Owner's Manuals and Setup Guides.\nNote that there are 2 problems that this will not correct: the bad sense pin mentioned above, or a problem with bad firmware on an optical drive or other device, because the firmware is stored on the device itself. The system BIOS is also firmware. However bad firmware on a device will not cause the \"no audio\" problem that is the subject of this faq.\nIII. Software Problems\nIf the laptop passes the hardware tests then logically the problem area is the software (except in the case of a bad sense pin).\n\n*\n\n*Audio Driver\n\nOften the driver is the cause of the audio problem. Re-install the driver as explained above. [...]\nIV. Addenda\nSome additional things to look at particularly on older models.\n\n*\n\n*Other Hardware Problems\n\n*\n\n*Headphone Jack. As explained above, a jack can have a failure of the sense pin. However that is not the only possible jack problem --  particularly on older models that do not have a sense pin. See the Headphone Jack FAQ for more details and a list of the models that have replaceable jack circuit boards.\n\n\n*Modem. In some models the modem can have a problem that interferes with the the audio system. Symptoms include inability to get the audio driver to install, getting an error message saying no audio hardware present, and audio properties settings being grayed out. To test this you have to physically remove the modem, not just uninstall the driver. With the modem removed, try again to install the audio driver. If the audio works after removing the modem then you might need to replace it. This issue is more likely to occur on older models.\n\n\n*Loose or Broken Speaker Wires. A connection to the speakers can be loose, or on some models the connection to the palm rest which houses the speakers can become loose and cause the speakers to stop working but still allowing the headphone jack to work. Wires are more likely to come loose than to break, but in a few models like the Inspiron 700m & 710m where the wires are routed through the hinges, the wires can pinch during the opening & closing of the display screen and break. Often you can hear some audio through the speakers when the screen is partially closed as the frayed wire ends make contact. For more information on this problem see the Speaker Wires Break in 700m & 710m FAQ.\n\n\n*Speakers. The speakers themselves can stop working. This is somewhat rare but not unheard of. If you hear the test tones when you run the PSA tests then the speakers work. See the Dell Diagnostics Audio Tests FAQ for more about the PSA tests.\n\n", "Q: How to access a XFS partition on external USB drives?

Please help me on how to use this software or tell me how to lock/encrypt my files and folders.\n\nA: I've used encfs from the command line and it works well in Ubuntu 12.10. The program you're trying to use, cryptkeeper, is a Gnome tray applet which brings encfs to a graphical window. However cryptkeeper seems to work with earlier versions of Ubuntu. I also use Ubuntu 12.10 and couldn't get the applet to appear despite cryptkeeper showing as a process in 'top'. I would guess that it's not compatible with the Unity desktop.\nThe command line isn't difficult for this, so maybe you would like to try this:\nSuppose you want to make an encrypted folder inside your home folder called \"locked\". Open the command terminal and type:\nencfs ~/.locked ~/locked (notice the space before each tilde mark)\nThis command creates both the visible and the hidden folder (hidden one has a dot at the start). encfs then asks for the password (which you want to type carefully) and the encryption level (just press enter for the default).\nIf you open your home folder in Nautilus or any file browser you'll see the visible 'locked' folder. When you put anything in the visible 'locked' folder it is really being encrypted and stored in the hidden '.locled' folder.\nIn reality the encrypted folder is mounted in the visible folder. To verify this type:\nfusermount -u ~/locked (this unmounts the encrypted 'locked' folder)\nand then in your file browser you'll see that everything you had put in that folder is now \"missing\". (It is really in the hidden .locked folder, all encrypted and safe.) To access this folder again just type: encfs ~/.locked ~/locked\nthen type your password. You'll see your files again in the visible 'locked' folder.\nSo what I've suggested is the command line stuff that cryptkeeper would have done under the surface.

Richard Matthew Stallman has called Ubuntu \"Spyware\". \nDoes the program called Zeitgeist spy? How can I disable it? What type of data does Zeitgeist send out? \n\nA: The component with which RMS is unhappy is the fact that the Unity dash makes requests to Amazon (via Canonical servers, AFAIK) in order to show requests. This may be a useful feature to some, but doubtless was also considered by Canonical as a revenue source, since they will get affiliate income when you buy anything through this mechanism. Use of web requests in the Unity dash can be easily disabled (although it may be reasonably asked why upon first boot you don't get a dialog box asking you if you want to turn it on, rather than it being on by default as it currently is).\nZeitgeist is a daemon which records actions in a number of GNOME programs, which in theory provides more useful information in the dash in terms of recently used applications. This can result in local information leakage (don't want other computer users (using the same account) to see the pictures or video you've been viewing recently?), but it does not broadcast this information anywhere, so I think describing this as spyware is unreasonable. This can also be disabled.\nWhether you trust Canonical (or Amazon) with your data is up to you.\n\nA: Other way to disable Zeitgeist is to type \"Privacy\" on dash, and turn off the \"log of activities\" on the inferior button.\n\nA: I was never asked for confirmation, or even was notified, of the fact that Zeitgeist daemon will collect all my activity on the system, when I installed Ubuntu (12.04 in my case). There was also no frontend application installed on my system, so Zeitgeist daemon clearly collected that information not for my own consumption. That pretty much is the definition of spyware, so I share the concern of the question poster.\n\"Data it gathers is never sent over the network\" is only a hypothesis. There's HUGE gap between not collecting users' activity without their consent, and doing that without consent and behind their backs, and once that gap is crossed, it's only small next step to also use and forward that data without users' consent. Quoted article from Richard Stallman is the proof that every user of Zeitgeist should be well aware and concerned regarding their private data.\nAnswering the original question posted, to remove Zeitgeist, run:\nsudo apt-get remove zeitgeist zeitgeist-core zeitgeist-datahub\n\n(Taken from http://martesmartes.blogspot.com/2012/06/even-nicer-little-improvement-in-linux.html)\n\nA: Regardless of whether it's intended for local use, the info it gathers could be a high-value target. It has no utility that I can see, but would be of great use to someone implementing spyware within Ubuntu. I prefer uninstalling it over simply disabling it. You're better off without it.\n\nA: First of all, zeitgeist logs your activity using various sources on your computer to enable searching for recent documents, programs and activities. This is \"spying\" only for a very broad definition of \"spying\", and the data it gathers is never sent over the network.\nSecondly, RMS refers to the \"shopping\" results in the dash, which have little to do with zeitgeist. This feature has been controversial, mainly because it's on by default, and because it operates from the \"home\" lens instead of from a dedicated lens - so one is always sending local search queries over the network when using the dash.\nSo if you have privacy concerns:\n\n\n*\n\n*To disable online results entirely in the dash, open the system menu (power-cog icon on the panel) > System Settings... > Privacy > Search results tab, and toggle the \"Include online search results\" switch to the OFF position.\n\n*To only disable the Amazon results, you can uninstall the lens by opening a terminal and typing sudo apt-get remove unity-lens-shopping. You will need to log out and back in for this to take effect.\n\n*To effectively move the Amazon results to a separate lens, you can install an alternative implementation of the shopping lens by opening a terminal and typing sudo apt-add-repository ppa:markjtully/ppa, followed by sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install unity-lens-shopping-alternate, followed by sudo apt-get remove unity-lens-shopping. You will need to log out and back in for this to take effect.\n\n*To disable zeitgeist, open the system menu (power-cog icon on the panel) > System Settings... > Privacy, and toggle the \"Record activity\" switch at the bottom of the window to the OFF position.\n\n\nA: Zeitgeist has 526MB of \"activity\" logged on me, including the URLs of downloads that I made in Chrome incognito mode and/or from the command-line, stuff that I've copy-pasted and I thought I had cleared, web searches (perhaps copy pasted), command line stuff that I had deliberately excluded from by bash history, torrent URLs I've downloaded, and at least three of my main passwords including my main server password, in the clear.\nIt turns out that the Clipit aka Diodon applet which I installed, thinking that it could be useful, logs everything I ever copy-pasted into to Zeitgeist, and it remains in Zeitgeist even after I \"clear\" the history in Diodon. I suppose that Zeitgeist and Diodon were created with good intentions, but this is very user-hostile in my opinion. I don't expect some random Gnome daemon that I didn't even intend to install to collude with a clipboard manager to log half a gigabyte of personal stuff in the clear, much of which I was actively trying to avoid logging, without asking me or letting me know. It is not at all apparent that this is happening from the UI of the clipboard manager.\nThe Diodon package description says:\nDescription-en: GTK+ Clipboard manager\n Diodon is a lightweight clipboard manager for Linux written in Vala which\n \"aims to be the best integrated clipboard manager for the Gnome/Unity desktop\".\n .\n Diodon features include Ubuntu indicator, clipboard sync (primary selection\n and Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V clipboard) and a zeitgeist integration for an infinite\n clipboard history.\n\nI think it's the \"zeitgeist integration for an infinite clipboard history\" that is biting me here.\nIf you use Clipit aka Diodon, or to check what else Zeitgeist might have on you, try these commands for starters:\ncd ~/.local/share/zeitgeist\nsqlite3 activity.sqlite\nselect * from text where value like '%pass%' and length(value) < 1000; -- put a bit of one of your passwords between %s in the query\nselect * from text where value like '%porn%' and length(value) < 1000; -- smut\nselect * from text where (value like '%mp4' or value like '%jpg' or value like '%torrent') and length(value) < 1000; -- media / smut / torrents\nselect * from text where length(value) > 1000;  -- large copy/paste or files\n\nThe sqlite3 program also logs what we enter, so you might want to shred -u ~/.sqlite_history if you enter passwords in an sqlite query.\nIf an enemy got a hold of my activity.sqlite file, they could potentially do me considerable damage:\n\n*\n\n*They could hack my servers, the passwords are in there.\n\n*They could embarrass me by publishing my web-surfing habits.\n\n*They could attempt to get me in trouble with copyright holders of torrents I've downloaded.\n\n*They could blackmail me regarding any of the above.\n\nI'm blaming Diodon for this more than Zeitgeist, but I'll be removing both.\nI reported some bugs around this issue:\n\n*\n\n*Debian bug comment\n\n*Ubuntu Launchpad bug\n", "Q: Airplane Mode in Network Settings The Gnome documentation states:\n\nSwitch Airplane Mode on.

I'd love to do this but HP have loaded their own 'Boot up management software' as the BIOS editor with no such options provided (at least I've not seen anything that looks 'safe' to click).\n\n\nSurely life should not be this hard - and I cannot be the only one with problems?\nHas anyone out there actually achieved an Ubuntu 12.10/Windows8 boot up on a Pavilion G-6 laptop pre-installed with Windows8?  If so, how do you do it please?\n\nA: The last I heard, WUBI didn't work well on UEFI installations; however, I don't follow WUBI very closely, so that may not be accurate. If it is accurate, your best bet is to ignore any WUBI-style boot options and instead boot the Ubuntu CD/DVD directly using the firmware's boot manager (usually accessed by hitting a function key soon after you power on). You may see two CD/DVD device entries in the list; be sure to select the one that's marked as being for \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\" and not one that's marked as \"BIOS\" or \"Legacy.\" Once the installer is booted, I recommend dropping to a shell and checking for the presence of a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted into EFI mode; if not, you've probably accidentally booted into BIOS/legacy mode. Do not proceed with installation in BIOS/legacy mode. Although you can get it to work this way, you'll need to jump through some extra hoops, so it's better to go back and at least try to get the installer started in EFI mode.\nUbuntu 12.10 does support Secure Boot, but this is a brand-new feature and so it may yet be buggy on some systems. If you want to eliminate Secure Boot as a possible source of trouble, you can certainly disable it using your firmware setup utility, but the details of how to do so vary from one system to another.\nFWIW, part of the problem with UEFI systems right now is that, despite a strict and detailed UEFI standard, manufacturers are introducing their own unique bugs, quirks, and idiosyncratic ways of doing things. It's like a cross between the Wild West and the Soviet Union. The point of this is: If you get a computer and it's giving you too much grief getting the Ubuntu installer to boot, return it, and make it very clear why you've done so. You might end up with something a little less mind-bendingly dysfunctional. FWIW, I've seen more problem reports about Sony and HP machines than most others, but I don't know if that's because they're worse than others or because they're more popular than others.\n\nA: This appears to be the same method I came up with independently to boot my HP DV7 Envy (essentially the same build as a DV7 Pavillion).  Here's a cut and paste I've been posting of what I came up with (trying to spread the work to other hapless HP owners ou there :))\nFor your reference,  this is how I achieved dual boot with vendor (HP)  installed Windows 8 / Ubuntu 12.10 on the machine that’s in the linked data sheet,  with manufacturing date 08/12:\nhttp://www.shopping.hp.com/shopping/pdf/c2h70ua.pdf\nThe chipset=HM77, Mobo=HP C181\nIn UEFI (F10 menu):\n• •Disable Secure Boot. I could not achieve boot in any configuration with it on. \n• •UEFI boot scheme (not Legacy BIOS). I tried Legacy mode, and can boot from disk, but not from an installation on the hard drive. UEFI flies right by it during boot every way I tried with it on. \nIn Ubuntu:\n• •/Boot=EFI, /=EXT4, /Home=EXT4, SWAP=swap. \nWith this configuration I can boot with user intervention during the boot sequence: \n1) During the boot sequence, select F9 to obtain Boot options in UEFI (BIOS) \n2) In UEFI / BIOS, select the available Ubuntu Linux 2.6.32-21 option and proceed. \n3) Ubuntu GRUB boot option screen is now available. Select preferred option and proceed. \n4) I'm in.\n", "Q: Cannot detect Windows 8 from Ubuntu 12.04 Live USB installation on Toshiba qosmio x870 From other questions raised, I read that if Ubuntu Live USB boots in UEFI mode then it should detect Windows 8 during installation.

Have you checked that the folders haven't been moved, perhaps into the Ubuntu One folder? If deleted, you may have to use file recovery software such as 'foremost' to recover your files. Foremost can be run from the command prompt and with the -t switch can be set to only look for certain file types. The general syntax is: foremost -t (filetype to find) -i (input, or disk to be searched) -o (output, or destination for found data)\nSo for example if you wanted to search disk B for lost jpeg files and store the recovered data on a third disk the command might resemble:\nforemost -t jpeg -i /dev/sdb -o /dev/sdc/folder\nAs for remastersys running, it's supposed to make a backup of your system as an iso file.

Filenames, however, are not aligned (e.g. my camera starts at IMG0001 but my friend's phone camera starts at pic1234.jpg, and my own phone starts at pic5678.jpg).\nIs there a way with Shotwell to export the files from everyone over to a plain directory, with the filenames rewritten so that the pictures are sorted in chronological order? Then, when I slideshow these files in another computer, with another image viewer (or with Shotwell itself in file browsing mode), they will show in the right chronological order.\nExample.\nIf I have these six files...\n\n\n*\n\n*My camera: IMG_0001.JPG - EXIF exposure date 2012/12/25 12:05:00\n\n*My camera: IMG_0002.JPG - EXIF exposure date 2012/12/25 12:11:00\n\n*My own phone: pic5678.jpg - EXIF exposure date 2012/12/25 12:09:00\n\n*My own phone: pic5679.jpg - EXIF exposure date 2012/12/25 12:15:00\n\n*Friend's phone: pic1234.jpg - EXIF exposure date 2012/12/25 12:08:00\n\n*Friend's phone: pic1235.jpg - EXIF exposure date 2012/12/25 12:18:00\n...then I would like to export them with filenames like these:\n\n\n*\n\n*20121225_120500-IMG_0001.JPG\n\n*20121225_120800-pic1234.jpg\n\n*20121225_120900-pic5678.jpg\n\n*20121225_121100-IMG_0002.JPG\n\n*20121225_121500-pic5679.jpg\n\n*20121225_121800-pic1235.jpg\nso that they show in the right order when browsing with any image browser.\nThe following script does the trick, but is not integrated in Shotwell, which is the point of the question, and will (gracefully) fail if the pictures are not exported with Exif data:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport pyexiv2\nimport sys\nimport shutil\n\ndef getTimestamp(f):\n  metadata = pyexiv2.ImageMetadata(f)\n  metadata.read()\n  try:\n    d = metadata['Exif.Image.DateTime']\n    return d.value.strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')\n  except Exception as e:\n    return \"00000000000000\"\n\nif len(sys.argv) > 1:\n  for f in sys.argv[1:]:\n    try:\n      timestamp = getTimestamp(f)\n      prefix = \"%s_\" % timestamp\n      if f[0:len(prefix)] == prefix:\n        print \"File %s was already renamed, not renaming again\" % (f)\n      else:\n        nn = \"%s%s\" % (prefix, f)\n        shutil.move(f, nn)\n        print \"File %s renamed to %s\" % (f, nn)\n    except Exception as e:\n      print \"File %s not renamed (%s)\" % (f, e)\nelse:\n  print \"Usage: %s <JPG files with Exif tags>\" % (sys.argv[0])\n\n\nA: The easiest approach will be to break this into two parts. \n\n\n*\n\n*First, export all the images from Shotwell to one folder.\n\n*Second, use pyrenamer to give the files the naming pattern you\nwant.\nHere's an example of how to use pyrenamer:  \n \nHere's the code I used to try to match your example in your question:  \n{imageyear}{imagemonth}{imageday}_{imagehour}{imageminute}{imagesecond}_{num3+1}.jpg  \n\nIt produces filenames that look like this:  \n \nNotice that you can add characters between the values in the curly brackets (like the underscore between {imageday} and {imagehour}), to make the output easier to read.  \nThe last {num3+1} bit is optional but helps if you happen to have two photos shot at the same second, and makes the whole lot easier to read.  \nIf you do this and find that one or more of the device clocks are off, you can use Shotwell to modify the time/date, and then re-do the pyrenamer step to have everything in perfect order. This is especially helpful for something like a wedding where people are coming to the event from different time zones, and photos out of order look totally wrong.\nLast, don't forget to include the file extension on the end, or it will be removed and may cause other problems.\n", "Q: How to fix \"E: Some index files failed to download.

After what You might link it where it is expected:\nsudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 /lib64/libc.so.6\n\nIf locate can't find the file -- this probably means You don't have it. You can find out which package provides it with:\n\napt-file search libc.so.6 # You might need to run \"sudo apt-file update\" before that\n\n\nA: I've just installed Matlab 2012b on Ubuntu 12.10 and followed up by installing the matlab-support package in the Ubuntu Software Centre:\nsudo apt-get install matlab-support\n(As per this answer in a related question: https://askubuntu.com/a/140078/16835)\nThis will add a desktop icon/launcher, as well as allow you to fix the compiler linking problem.\n", "Q: How do I partition a drive so that the data is separate from the operating system? I'm planing to install ubuntu 12.10 in a dell inspiron 17 laptop as the unique operating system.\nI would like to know how to partition the drive in  order to have my data separate from the operating system.\nis it better to do it in the installation or I could go with the default and then use gparted to do the job?\nwhere can I find some tutorials on this?\nI'm finding lots of things with dual boot, but I'm not interested on that.\n\nA: Different people have different views on the number of partitions to have in Linux (or Ubuntu). \nIf you go with the default, the installation process will create a root partition with mount point / and a Swap partition. However, since you want the data to be separate, you should select \"Something Else\" option during installation. This is the advanced option where you get to delete everything and make your own partitions.\nI recommend you make 3 partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*One 30GB / partition format ext4\n\n*One 4GB Swap partition format Linux/Swap\n\n*Rest of the drive as /home partition format ext4\n\n\nIf your computer came with UFEI rather than a BIOS, you may need keep the partition for UFEI. \nThe / partition will have the OS as well as all the applications you will download and install in the future. If you are a web developer, or do some server related work, those things will be in the / partition as well. However, I find 30GB is more than enough for normal desktop use.\nThe swap partition is getting less important with 4GB or more RAM. A small swap partition keeps the system run smoothly. Another reason one needs a swap partition is hibernation. Hibernation is disabled by default, as it does not work in all laptops. You may later experiment with it and want to have it enabled. Having a swap partition will be useful then.\nThe /home partition will have all the users' data and personal settings. Photos, music, and videos can take up a lot of space. So I recommend giving the rest of your hard drive to /home. \nIt is possible to do a default installation and then at a later date, shrink the / partition and create a separate /home partition and move all the data there. This gets more difficult as your hard drive gets more full. There is always a chance that something may go wrong while moving data between partitions, and you will lose your data. So it is much safer to create the partitions when there is no data in the new computer.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: If you want to keep data and operating system separate, create a / that is 50 G. And stick the rest in /home.\nAll of the data will be in your home directory. \nYou can resize the partitions later should you need to, but it's a PIA. 50G is more then enough if all of your data is in home.\n", "Q: I tried to install \"ubuntu tweak\" but i can't find it now, how to fix this?

I installed chromium and tabs keep crashing with the 'He's dead, Jim' message, which alludes that chromium isn't getting enough memory. I did not have this problem before the Ubuntu install so I am guessing that there is some way to get it to allocate more of the one gig of ram installed so it won't crash as much.\n\nA: With 1 gig of ram I am surprised that Windows 7 was not more sluggish.

I would like to be able to receive and send emails though a webmail (e.g. roundcube).\nI have a domain name. The web server already works without any problem.\nWhen I googled \"simple method to install mail server on Ubuntu\", I arrive on blogs with literally hundreds of steps to install a mail server:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Mailserver on Ubuntu 12.04: Postfix, Dovecot, MySQL\n\n*Creating a Mail Server on Ubuntu\n\n*Postfix\nBut, for sure I will make a mistake, if I follow those tutorials, and it will be very very time consuming. Most of the steps look very easy to automate, though.\nI've try several install methods:\nsudo apt-get install dovecot-postfix\nsudo tasksel install mail-server\nBut from there, I have no idea how to add email accounts, and test if it actually works.\nDo you know if there is an automated way to install a mail server?\nEDIT - NEW ANSWER\nMail-In-A-Box\nA very interesting open source project that turns a ubuntu machine into an email server:\nhttps://github.com/JoshData/mailinabox\n\nA: Zimbra is a great and easy to setup mailserver with collaboration, it might be a bit heavy for some people's needs, but the first time I installed it I had it up and running in under 30 min. It even has paid support, if you really need it.\n\nA: If you are new to email server but still want to set up one. You can check out my blog page Tiny VPS Postfix.\nIt is a good starting point to learn, and you can expend the configuration for full setup in future.\nWhat it does\n\n*\n\n*Send/Receive mail for your domain\n\n*Forward all incoming email to another email address according to configuration.\n\nWhat it does not\n\n*\n\n*NO local account, all username@your-domain.com are configure for forwarding\n\n*NO webmail. You will be using third party email service (eg. Yahoo, GMail, etc)\n\nIF this is what you want, THEN I will copy the instruction over here. ELSE I will just leave this answer as is.\n\nA: Mail-In-A-Box\nA very interesting open source project that turns a ubuntu machine into an email server:\nhttps://github.com/JoshData/mailinabox\n\nA: I use the all-encompassing WEBMIN. Found here \nIt has different modules that you can incorporate (or not) into managing your server. These modules ie: Apache, RAID, Sendmail and the like are a plug-in for Webmin and therefore become manageable when installed. Webmin can also manage your current installations and reports. \nThis simple application is the administrators backbone for setting up VOIP, Mail, DATABASE, cloud, firewall and more. \nYou can keep it simple or roll with the big boys with this. \nAny well played system administrator has used this or something like it. This IS the front-end GUI to A Mailserver on Ubuntu 12.04: Postfix, Dovecot, MySQL etc. \n\n\nA: You should also consider one of the inspirations for \"mailinabox,\" Drew Crawford's post on how to NSA-proof your email in 2 hours.\n\nA: This is the best/simple method.\nsudo apt-get install postfix\nThat's it a mail server is installed. \nNow administrating that mail server is a whole different story. \nBy default postfix will deliver and relay for all local user accounts. That should get you started. If you want something more complex then you REALLY REALLY need to read, study, learn, apprentice, etc. Mail servers are very very complex to setup correctly. Even when setup correctly they take constant supervision and monitoring.  If your doing anything more then local delivery then I 100% recommend that you do not setup your own mail server. \nDo not forget to setup DNS and SPF records if your going to be sending emails to non-local addresses. This is a bare minimum and will not result in deliverable mail to most ISPs. \nAgain, I strongly urge you to read, and fully understand what you are doing before you even attempt to run a public mail server. Keep in mind, that (at least in the US) you can be fined per email, for emails sent from your server incorrectly. This is rare but has happened. A more common effect is that you get blacklisted, shunned, and marked as a generally evil person and are banned from ever running an email server again (this happens quite frequently).\nIf your  going to run a public server make sure you speak with your ISP/Hosting first. You will need, at a minimum a static IP and their permission. Most ISPs will block you 100% from every getting back on the internet for running an incorrectly configured mail server for an extended period of time.\nI add all these warnings so that you know, local delivery, intranet delivery, your fine. Remote delivery, know what you are doing before you even attempt it. Incorrectly configured mail servers can bring on a whole world of disaster if not handled correctly.\n\nA: This is not short but you won't find anything short. It is easy to follow and very easy to administer as the users, domains, forward tables will be virtual in MySQL. Mail users doesn't need a system account to login to POP or IMAP. Works with StartTLS or SSL.\nIt guides you to build the mysql queries and to hook them in postfix to use mysql as virtual backend and to install antivirus, anti-spam filters and webmail (SquirrelMail).\nThere are various versions of the guide for different releases of Ubuntu.\nhttp://www.howtoforge.com/virtual-users-and-domains-with-postfix-courier-mysql-and-squirrelmail-ubuntu-12.04-lts.\n\nA: Ubuntu help / MailServer\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MailServer\nUbuntu official documentation is most of the time, easy enough. \n", "Q: Sound recorder not responding, Ubuntu 12.10 I don't know what is causing this.  I've noticed lately after upgrading the computer at church to Ubuntu 12.10, the sound recorder will not record when the record button is pressed, and when I press it again, the message to continue without saving comes up.  No matter what I choose the program completely locks up, and the only way I can quit the program is by going to system monitor and ending the process, I then reopen the sound recorder and it then works properly.  Any thoughts as to what can be done to fix this?\n\nA: I was having this problem too. While looking for alternatives I ran into audio-recorder (https://launchpad.net/~osmoma/+archive/audio-recorder) and when I installed it, I noticed that it also installed several gstreamer related libraries (which I remember having previouly but probably were uninstalled during my upgrade to 12.10).\nSo, out of curiosity I tried the sound recorder again after the gstreamer libraries were installed, and what do you know, it was working fine now. \nSo, short answer is: It looks like the problem is that you are missing some gstreamer libraries. \nThis is the list of extra packages that was installed by audio-recorder (and which fixed my problem):\ngstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio gstreamer1.0-x libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-0 libgstreamer1.0-0\nSo, although I can't be sure which of them actually fixed sound recorder, I am sure it was one of them. :).\n", "Q: I broke X, probably by installing a proprietary NVIDIA driver.

I think this problem started around when I tried to install new proprietary NVIDIA drivers. \nHow can I get X back? I would install older drivers using the Additional Drivers program, except I can't start any version of X. \n\nA: I had this same problem. It was caused by a failed installation of the 310 version of the nvidia drivers. I fixed it with\napt-get remove nvidia-experimental-310\n\nAfter that I could start X. \n\nA: Important! Read this entire post before trying!\nGo to a terminal by pressing CTRL+ALT+F3. Login, and enter this command:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-*\n\nThat will remove the proprietary drivers. Once it's done, backup your Xorg.conf, like so:\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak~\n\nThen run this:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nThis updates the RAMFS, which seems to help (forget why though, sorry). Then reboot using this:\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: I got a similar error as I was installing CUDA for Ubuntu 12.10 which is not yet fully supported by NVidia (they have 11.10 as the newer version.)\nThe problem was indeed a mix of libraries. I had to completely remove all libraries installed by default when installing Ubuntu and then make sure to reinstall the CUDA driver.\nTo get a list of the default nvidia packages installed:\ndpkg -l | grep nvidia\n\nTo remove them:\napt-get remove --purge nvidia-...\n\nObviously the other solutions presented here would not work in case you were installing CUDA since reinstalling the default libraries & drivers would overwrite the CUDA installation!\n\nIn the newer versions of Ubuntu (since at least 13.10), CUDA can be installed using:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-dev\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-doc\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-dbg\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit\n\nThese commands should automatically install the cuda library if not already installed.\n", "Q: Using a livecd on an intel iMac I have a livecd that works on Windows.

I'll wait to see if anyone can explain why ubuntu isn't doing what I expect it to do naturally before accepting my own answer.\n\nA: Don't use 'Automatic Mount Options: On'! That just sets it to use the default options for automounting, which for me at least apparently means that the drive isn't automounted. This is perhaps a tad confusing, as you might expect the greyed out settings below to show the  default settings, but they don't.\nInstead, you should set 'Automatic Mount Options' to 'Off' and make sure the 'Mount at startup' and 'Show in user interface' checkboxes are selected manually. You might also want to change the 'Mount Point' to something more readable and useful that /mnt/[UUID] or whatever it defaults to.\nI know this question is pretty old, but it still comes up on searches and is still relevant to new versions, so I thought it useful to answer properly.

I don't know how to get the GPU usage, however, the Nvidia GUI reports no increasing temperature.\nDo you have any idea what is causing this issue?\n\nA: The issue is probably the TV, as now the graphics card has to duplicate it's effort to display to both screens, instead of only one. I'd recommend first unplugging your TV and see if it's faster. If it isn't, then it's another issue, so try updating your driver, like so:\nsudo apt-get update  # Update apt sources\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade  # Run system updates\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-*  # Remove legacy NVidia drivers\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current  # Install newer NVidia drivers\nsudo nvidia-xconfig  # Write NVidia configuration to X11\nsudo reboot  # Reboot your computer\n\n\nEDIT: If the technique above doesn't work, try installing Google Chrome and see if the newer flash version (11.5) works better.

Could not locate dkms.conf file` During a recent apt-get dist-upgrade of 12.10 I received the following error:\nSetting up linux-headers-3.5.0-19-generic (3.5.0-19.30) ...\nExamining /etc/kernel/header_postinst.d.\nrun-parts: executing /etc/kernel/header_postinst.d/dkms 3.5.0-19-generic /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.0-19-generic\nError! Could not locate dkms.conf file.\nFile:  does not exist.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: This is usually caused by modules in /var/lib/dkms that don't have a dkms.conf file within their source subdirectories - dkms expects this file, so will report an error if it's missing, and then may miss out on compiling some valid modules.\nTo find the offending module, run this short script (thanks to Lekensteyn):\nfor i in /var/lib/dkms/*/[^k]*/source; do [ -e \"$i\" ] || echo \"$i\";done\n\nThat will output any dkms module directories; you can then decide whether to uninstall the package that created them, or if they've been manually installed or renamed, to move them somewhere else or remove them.\n\nA: I've been getting that on kernel upgrades for a while, with the result that not all of my dkms drivers get updated on kernel-upgrades.\nFirstly I was able to workaround the problem by reconfiguring any packages that used dkms to force them to be recompiled for the current kernel - eg it was my AMD video drivers that failed (package == fglrx):\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure fglrx\n\nThat would at least get the drivers configured for the current version.\nFinally I found this bug, which includes some steps you can use to diagnose: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dkms/+bug/830915\ndkms status\nls -R /var/lib/dkms\n\nBasically what they're doing is looking around for anything that is surprising, or unexpected - eg packages you have uninstalled - or software you have manually installed on an earlier ubuntu version and may not work with the newer version.  Particularly check the date-stamp on the directories which might show you particularly old packages could be from manually installed packages.\nls -l /var/lib/dkms\n\nIn my case I had an old version of the fglrx install I had used to diagnose some problems a year ago and had simply re-named it.  Deleting this old cruft made the problem go away.\nIf there's junk delete it (or move it out of that directory) - if there's a manually installed package there, consider updating it, or uninstalling it and using the maintained version.\n\nA: I have had this problem with VirtualBox from Oracle's ppa, rather than the one packaged with 12.04 LTS :\nError! Could not locate dkms.conf file.\nFile:  does not exist.\n\nI copied the contents of /var/lib/dkms to another directory as a backup, then removed the vboxhost directory in /var/lib/dkms;\nmkdir ~/backup_dkms\ncp -r /var/lib/dkms/* ~/backup_dkms \nrm -rf /var/lib/dkms/vboxhost\n\nI then reconfigured the virtualbox package like this:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-4.2\n\nand it succeeded in doing this:\n   * Trying to register the VirtualBox kernel modules using DKMS\n\n\nA: I was also suffering from this problem for a long time.  I need to reinstall the NVIDIA driver each time after kernel update and restart.  Recently, I started to look into this problem.  Actually, my problem is that there are multiple module folders with the same prefix nvidia- under /usr/src/ and multiple folders with different version numbers under /var/lib/dkms/nvidia.  After removing the older versions, both following commands\n    dkms status\n    dkms autoinstall\n\nworked.\n\nA: This happened to me once on a Red Hat 7.5 Workstation with an Nvidia driver. I know it's not Ubuntu but this may help someone...\nRemove the Nvidia files from dkms and then reinstall dkms:\nrm -rf /var/lib/dkms/nvidia\nyum reinstall dkms\n\nThen reinstall the Nvidia driver\n./NVIDIA-installer.bin --dkms\nreboot\n\nWARNING, this worked for me but may not be the correct way of doing things.\n", "Q: How do I set a password for guest login Want to set a guest session password for login. How do you do this after skipping it at OS install?\n\nA: First,\nIt might be to your advantage to find how the guest account is to be used.\nSome important points are:\n\n\n*\n\n*According to the outdated documentation for Guest user accounts for Ubuntu: 'A guest account allows visitors to use the computer system without login credentials.' So the whole point of the user is to have no password.\n\n*Ask far as I know, the guest account purges documents or files written into its home directory (which is actually in /tmp) after the session is terminated. This is shown in this comment by @andol.\n\n*Taking these things into accounts, primarily, the guest account should be used for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Persons with no registered account on your computer\n\n*If you need to quickly access the internet or do something that will not need to be permanently stored. \n\n*To restrict use of your account and files by unknown user, but still allowing limited use.\n\n\n\nSo, now I think you can see that the Guest Account should not be used as a legitimate account for your computer, but like a Library or public computer: unless you have a USB or similar, you're files are as good as gone. Therefore, you should have no need to password-protect the guest account at all.\nWhat should you do?\nIf I were you I would make a whole new account, depending on your intentions. If you were looking for an account that wouldn't show your files but could still be used by others (like a young sister) I would just create a new account.\nAdditionally, you could also make your own Guest Account and disable the one that came with Ubuntu 12.04 and later.\nYou can do this by following the steps on the Technology Windows & Linux website. \nAlternatively, in theory, you could use the passwd command. I haven't tried this before, so its just a guess: but you would type either sudo passwd guest or passwd guest. It may not work, and I don't think it's a great idea because of the reasons I have listed above.\nGood luck! \n\nA: You can use the passwd command. Open a terminal by pressing CTRL + ALT + T . Then type passwd and the user name. So it should be passwd guest\n", "Q: Cantgive access to my webcam on websites I am using Ubuntu 12.10.

Hope this can help you.\n", "Q: VDI to Hard Drive Is any way to copy file system from VirtualBox .vdi file (or others like that) to physical partition on a hard drive?\n\nA: There is probably a utility to do this, but you can do it rather easily without any special software, which is always a useful trick to know, as it will work with any type of virtualization software.\nSimply boot up a live image in the virtual machine with .vdi attached. Make sure networking is enabled and the machine with the target disk and guest can see each other. Then, dd the virtual partition and pipe to netcat on the guest, and receive it on the host system with netcat and write to the partition with dd.\nOn the target machine run:\nnetcat -l -p 4444 | dd of=/dev/<target partition or disk>\n\nIt will wait. Inside the guest run:\ndd if=/dev/<source partition or disk> | netcat <target-machine-ip> 4444\n\nThis is assuming the source and target devices are exactly the same size, which they probably are not.\nNote that the target machine does not have to be the virtualization host machine, it can be any machine that the guest machine can reach over the network.\nFor special software to manipulate .vdi images in a variety of ways see: Mount a VirtualBox drive image (vdi)?\n\nA: You should copy the contents of the file system instead of writing an image to a physical disk in bitwise mode. This is especially recommended for SSDs with TRIM support, because when TRIM kicks in it will delete files that it doesn't know about (it just starts to clean blocks where it assumes that no files are stored, which is the case for everything that is written in bitwise mode to a SSD). Additionally, copying files to a new file system automatically defragments the files for you.\nYou can use cp or rsync with the -a parameter as root to preserve permissions and ownership.\nAt last you need to re-install the boot loader, to have a functional booting operating system. GRUB and GRUB2 can be re-installed via live CD with the --boot-directory option, Windows should provide similar functionality on its installation disk.\n\nA: You can convert VDI file into RAW format, then use dd command to copy the image into partition.\nFor example:\nVBoxManage clonehd --format RAW file.vdi file.img\ndd if=./file.img of=/dev/<partition_here>\n\nNote: Use sudo if required.

(Brand and model.) Did it come with Windows 8 or did you install it yourself?\nUnfortunately, some manufacturers are playing very annoying games with their boot loaders on pre-loaded Windows 8 computers. IMHO, blowing those installations away and starting from scratch is looking more and more like a good solution.\n\nEdit/answer given new information:\nThere's nothing in your output that's weird or unexpected, so it looks as if something in Windows is \"repairing\" what it sees as its own \"broken\" boot loader. This requires some elaboration, which will help you understand what's going on:\nAn EFI (or UEFI, which is just EFI 2.x) implementation is supposed to check NVRAM entries to decide which boot loader (a file with a .efi extension) to run when it boots. Some implementations are broken, though, and will only boot the EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi or EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi boot loader. Others will boot other boot loaders, but only if they've got the name \"Windows Boot Manager\" or \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux\".\nTo work around this type of bug, the Ubuntu Boot Repair tool implements a fix that's at least as ugly and confusing as the bug it bypasses: It renames those two default boot loaders with .bkp extensions, places copies of GRUB in their place, and adjusts GRUB so that it will launch the Windows boot loaders using their new names. This gets GRUB booting, but in a way that Windows doesn't understand and might try to \"fix\" itself. I think that this is what's happening -- when Windows boots, it's seeing that its boot loader has been overwritten by another one and so it tries to correct the problem.\nI recommend you try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check your manufacturer's Web site to see if there's a firmware update. If there is, update your firmware to the latest version, just in case there's a bug fix for this type of boot bug.\n\n*Boot Windows and reboot to verify that when you reboot you go straight into Windows. You want to start from this point because it's more standard than the way that Boot Repair sets up.\n\n*Boot a Linux emergency disc in EFI mode. (The Ubuntu install disc should work fine for this.)\n\n*Install the efibootmgr utility, if necessary. In the Ubuntu live CD, you'd do this by typing sudo apt-get install efibootmgr.\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr -c -l \\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\shimx64.efi -L \"Windows Boot Manager\" -p 2. Be careful to type this command exactly as specified, including the doubled-up backslashes as directory path separators. This should set up GRUB to launch as the default boot loader, giving it the firmware label \"Windows Boot Manager\" in case you've got that bug. (You could try with a less deceptive name, and on most systems that will work, but maybe not for you.) If you're not using Secure Boot, you could substitute grubx64.efi for shimx64.efi in this command, but given that shimx64.efi is present on your system, my suspicion is that you are using Secure Boot.\n\n*Reboot and test it.\n\n\nIf it works at this point, then great. If it boots to GRUB but GRUB can't launch Windows, you may need to adjust your GRUB configuration so that it references EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi rather than EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi.bkp.\nIf you can't get your system to launch GRUB in this way, then you may have a very brain-damaged firmware combined with something in Windows that's automatically \"fixing\" a \"damaged\" boot loader on every boot, closing off your best (albeit ugly) avenue of repair. In that case, I have several further suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the computer is new enough, return it to the store and get a new one. Make it very clear, both to the store and to the manufacturer, why you're returning it.\n\n*Look for whatever in Windows is checking and \"repairing\" its boot loader and disable that. You should then be able to use Ubuntu's Boot Repair, or do something similar manually, to get it all working.\n\n*Create a second ESP and install GRUB (or another Linux boot loader) to it using the Microsoft names. By juggling partition ID numbers (using gdisk, for example -- use the t option on the experts' menu), you might be able to get the firmware to use your desired boot loader while getting Windows to look at its own boot loader. This is highly speculative, though; it might not work at all.\n\n*Create a USB flash drive with my rEFInd boot manager. You'll then be able to insert it into the computer and boot from the USB device to get rEFInd, which should then detect both Windows and GRUB and give you the option of booting either. With a little extra reconfiguration, you could get it to boot Linux directly. If you can set your firmware to boot from the USB device by default, you could leave the USB drive plugged in permanently for a permanent solution.\n\n*Install rEFInd or GRUB from Windows. I'm far from positive of this, but if you install a boot loader from Windows (as described on rEFInd's Web site), it might bypass whatever in Windows is juggling the boot loaders, thus enabling your preferred boot loader to run by default.\n\n\nNote that, if you use any solution that involves rEFInd, you may need to set it up with Secure Boot, with involves jumping through some extra hoops. (This situation will improve in time, but for now it's still a bit awkward.) Alternatively, you could disable Secure Boot in your firmware.\nI hope this helps!\n\nA: Instead of the Recommended Repair, try this: \n\n\n*\n\n*run Boot-Repair --> Advanced options --> Untick Backup and rename EFI files --> tick Restore EFI backups --> Apply.\n\n*Reboot the PC\n\n*If it boot directly into Windows, setup your UEFI firmware (~BIOS) to boot the Ubuntu entry, then reboot.\n\n\nA: Microsoft sucks as always, they don't want another OS, so they just overwrite the boot manager. Look for bcdedit in Windows 8. I haven't found out until now how to change it.\nPrevent Windows 8 from overwriting default bootmgr\n\nA: Windows 8 with enabling fast restarting feature will “recover” some data including \nEFI bootloaders when shutting down. Therefore, after you finish setting up dual boot \nenvironment and boot Windows 8 once, you will lost your dual boot settings by next boot. \nThat’s why you need to turn off the fast restarting feature. \nStart cmd.exe as Administrator and type:\npowercfg /h off\nVerify settings: \npowercfg /a\n", "Q: Huge mouse cursor arrow after installing Nvidia drivers After installing the proprietary Nvidia drivers, my mouse cursor looks like this:\n\nThe arrow image is much larger than normal.

However, sometimes I click on the wrong wireless connection by accident in the dropdown list.  If the connection is secure, the machine of course never successfully connects, but somehow it still seems to memorize the ESSID.

You would have better luck asking this question in a Windows forum - people are likely to have more specific knowledge.\nHaving said that, bootmgr is a file on the root of your Windows drive that helps Windows to boot. The error you're getting means that when you used the \"compress hard drive\" option in Windows, you managed to compress the bootmgr file too. Unfortunately, this breaks Windows.\nThe solution is to uncompress the bootmgr file. This is not easily done through linux. If you've managed to format your entire drive to ext4, then you've lost everything anyhow.\n\nA: Whilst the point made by YodaDaCoda is perfectly valid - I can make one suggestion:\nWindows Vista (and its installer) cannot read the Ubuntu file system, but what it can do is format (wipe) the entire drive. Whilst I don't have a copy of a Windows Vista installer to work from, I am 100% confident that the options to formate the entire drive will be there somewhere.

I'm asking this because when i upgraded 12.4 to 12.10 it had a lot of glitches to it. Will the 13.4 run the same after upgrading as if I was to install the it directly as it is?\n\nA: Technically, a system which has been upgraded from a beta to a final release should be identical to a system on which the final version was installed from installation medium, so any bugs should affect both systems equally. This is what package managers are for, after all.\nAt least, this worked fine for me during the 12.10 development cycle - maybe one trick is to make sure you upgrade your system often, so there's no large gap between packages' versions. In this case upgrading to \"real\" final release is just a minor upgrade which is unlikely to break anything any more than any of the previous interim updates.\nStill, running a Beta release on a machine which holds \"all my programs, files, and data on it\" is not advisable - make sure you back up your documents often.

I am doing a network experiment about ip packet forwarding, but I don't know why it does work.\nI have a linux machine with two network interfaces, eth0 and eth1 both with static IP address (eth0: 192.168.100.1, eth1: 192.168.101.2). \nMy goal is simple, I just want to forward ip packets from eth1 with destination in subnet 192.168.100.0/24 to eth0, and forward ip packets from eth0 with destination in subnet 192.168.101.0/24 to eth1. \nI turned on ip forwarding with:  \nsysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\nmy routing table is like this: \n# route -n\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway     Genmask        Flags Metric Ref   Use  Iface\n192.168.100.0   0.0.0.0     255.255.255.0  U     0      0       0  eth0\n192.168.101.0   0.0.0.0     255.255.255.0  U     0      0       0  eth1\n\nBut, when I try to ping from 192.168.100.25 to 192.168.101.47, it does not work.\n\nA: You need to add a route to both 192.168.100.25 and 192.168.101.47.\nIf your forwarding server has IPs 192.168.100.1 and 192.168.101.1 you would add in client 192.168.100.25 \nip route 192.168.101.0/24 via 192.1268.100.1\n\nand in client 192.168.101.47\nip route 192.168.100.0/24 via 192.168.101.1\n\n(This works with just forwarding enabled, no iptables). \n\nA: You need to add a forwarding rule using iptables command, something like this:\nmodprobe iptable_nat\necho 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\niptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -j ACCEPT\n\nsee man iptables for more details, or search internet for howto articles, for example How to set up a NAT router on a Linux-based computer\nHere is Linux IP Masquerade HOWTO which discusses the topic in details.\nYou should also ensure that you have no other rules (e.g. in the FORWARD chain) that are overriding the above ACCEPT rule. If there are, you probably want to delete them.\n", "Q: how do I turn off tap-to-click for logitech k400r wireless keyboard with touchpad? I'm running kubuntu 12.04 i386 on lenovo thinkcenter.  \nThere are no options for the touchpad under \"Input Devices\".\nIs there anyway to turn off tap-to-click by editing some text file?\n\nA: Am not sure but I think that FN plus left click turns off tap to click.\n\nA: I think I had the same problem. No touchpad settings in systemsettings. But I don't remember how I fixed it :(\nBut I know that you can configure tapping with synaptiks.\nJust start a terminal and type synaptiks or alt-f2 synaptiks.\n\nA: Control Panel > Change Mouse Settings > Hardware choose the right Mouse driver (for me it was called HID-Compliant Mouse) > Properties > Change Settings > Driver > Disable\nHope it works!\n\nA: Now in 2020, the Solaar application handles these functions for many Logitech keyboards including the K400. It should be in most distros, and the solaar package is in Ubuntu's default repositories in 16.04 and later.\n", "Q: Why won't xattr PECL extension build on 12.10? I was using the xattr pecl extension in 12.04 (in fact, I think since 10.04) without problem.

Left-click on the email with the attachment in the mail list to mark it and find in the panel/main menu \"Message\" \"Remove Attachments\".  \nBut unfortunately the most intuitive ways and where I looked for the command first does not work: Left-click context menu in the email itself and context menu of the attachment itself does not contain \"remove attachments\".\n", "Q: bash substring syntax as a means of disambiguating environment variable identifiers When bashing, I know that double quoting is sometimes necessary if an environment variable (EV) contains embedded spaces.  Example: \"$JACK\" rather than $JACK.  Sometimes it is recommended to use the syntax borrowed from substringing if the identifier of the EV is ambiguous.  Example, because the EV is not $JACKA, $JACKAN, nor $JACKAND we would use curly braces with no substring indices to write ${JACK}ANDJILL.  \nIt seems that double quotes can accomplish the same thing.  Example: \"$JACK\"ANDJILL\nIn fact if we do nothing but echo the following demonstrates equivalence.\n#!/bin/bash\nTEXAS=\"asdf asdf\"\nFLORIDA=\"qwer\"\"$TEXAS\"\"qwer\" # use quotes\necho $FLORIDA\n\nALABAMA=\"qwer\"${TEXAS}\"qwer\" # use substring without indices\necho $ALABAMA\n\nARIZONA=\"qwer\"\"${TEXAS}\"\"qwer\" # use both\necho $ARIZONA\n\nMAINE=\"qwer\"$TEXAS\"qwer\" # use neither\necho $MAINE\n\nNEVADA=\"qwer\"\"$TEXAS\"qwer # last bit not quoted\necho $NEVADA\n\nIDAHO=\"qwer\"${TEXAS}qwer # last bit not quoted\necho $IDAHO\n\nThe output:\n    qwerasdf asdfqwer\n    qwerasdf asdfqwer\n    qwerasdf asdfqwer\n    qwerasdf asdfqwer\n    qwerasdf asdfqwer\n    qwerasdf asdfqwer\n\nAre there bash statements/constructs where the substring trick cannot be substituted with double quotes?\n\nA: Substring has more function, as the name says it can be used to take a substring of a variable.\nFor example  \nvar='123456789'\necho ${var:2:4}\n\nWill output\n\n3456\n\nWhile using array you have to use substring for accessing array variables.\nFor example  \na[0]=0\na[1]=1\na[2]=2\n\necho $a will print 0.\necho \"$a[1]\" output 0[1]\nSo accessing array variable at location 1 as follows  \necho ${a[1]}\n\nThis outputs 1  \necho \"${a[@]}\" output all variable. ie 0 1 2\nIn these cases substring can't be repaced with \"\"\n", "Q: Replace All Colons From Filenames With Terminal I have a GB's worth of music on my HDD that was formatted with EXT4. I want to move these files to a FAT formatted HDD partition. However, I can't move most of my files because they have \":\" in the names (For example, \"Act 2: .....\" for operas). Is there a way with command line to rename all of my files from \"XXXX:XXXX\" to \"XXXX-XXXX\"?\n\nA: If all your files are in a single directory, try:\nrename 's|:|-|g' *\n\n(where * can be changed to something more restrictive if you'd like)\nIf you have many files in a directory tree, try this from the base of the tree:\nfind . -name \"*:*\" -exec rename 's|:|-|g' {} \\;\n\nYou can add the option -n right after rename to have it tell you what it WOULD do without ACTUALLY doing it.  This might help you avoid accidentally stepping on other files or something else bad...\n\nA: This is a solution in python which handles the case where the files are not necessarily in the same directory.\nimport os\ntorename = []\nrootdir = \"The main directory\"\nlogfile = \"Path to log file\" #Eg: logfile = \"/home/prasanth/renamelog\"\nfor (path, dirs, files) in os.walk(rootdir):\n    for dirname in dirs:\n        if ':' in dirname:\n            torename.append(os.path.join(path, dirname))\n    for filename in files:\n        if ':' in filename:\n            torename.append(os.path.join(path, filename))\n\nprint \"No of files/dirs to rename =\", len(torename)\na = raw_input(\"Continue?

No shorthands or env variables like ~ allowed). No need to put \\ before special characters - for example if the outermost dir is /.../My HDD, put rootdir = \"/.../My HDD\" NOT rootdir = \"/.../My\\ HDD\" (Note the \"s) [I'm being this explicit only because you may be unfamiliar with python. No disrespect intended.]\n\n*Change logfile to desired location of logfile. In the end, this file will contain the list of files renamed - for future reference.\n\n*Call python rename.py.\n\n\nWarning: Do test on a small sample before risking an entire GB of music.\nDetails: Renaming is performed from the innermost files outward.\n\nA: The top answer didn't work on my system. This one did.\nTo show a test run:\nrename -nv \":\" \"_\" *.webp\nTo run:\nrename \":\" \"_\" *.webp\n\nA: Im not at my linux machine right now so I can only give rough information. \nLinux has a commandline utility called rename which works with among other inputs, regular expressions or regexes. You should be able to use that along with a regex like \"s/:/-/\" on your files to achieve the rename you want. \nJust to be safe, do it in small batches and/or first test with the simulation (rename has a flag which just gives you the oldname and new name of the file without actually renaming - use this to verify first)\n\nA: I realize this is a very old post.  AeroGT80's recursive solution is very thorough, but it is pretty slow.  I had it running for about half an hour on a slower server and it only got about half done - I think it was about 73,000 files in about 300 sub-directories.  \nThe solution below will operate much quicker (it operates on all files in a directory, instead of each file one-by-one - using AeroGT80's non-recursive solution).  The only problem is, it only goes down one directory deep (so it's not fully recursive like his solution is), but I'm sure it could be modified easily enough.\n#!/bin/bash\nfor D in *; do\n        if [ -d \"${D}\" ]; then\n                #echo \"${D}\"\n                pushd \"${D}\" > /dev/null\n                rename 's|:|-|g' *\n                popd > /dev/null\n        fi\ndone\n\n", "Q: I don't know my passphrase I have just installed Ubuntu and I am not sure what my password is.

I was playing Morrowind on Wine, and in the game I tried to navigate to the video settings menu to adjust the brightness. I had done this before many times with no problem. As soon as I clicked \"video\", the game silently crashed and returned me to my desktop. The funny part was that my second monitor, which normally remains \"signaled\" with a black screen, while playing Morrowind, was now showing signs of \"no signal\". A quick check in nvidia-settings showed that my second monitor stopped being detected. I thought... ok, no big deal, I'll just restart and everything will be OK... WRONG. Upon restarting, X would not start because the NVidia driver compiled for 3.5.0-18-generic went missing, as in, it was not shown in lsmod. The monitor that had disappeared also did not come back. So I thought, ok, I must have gotten a new kernel, maybe now I have to reinstall the driver. Sure enough, uname -r showed 3.5.0-19-generic, one tick newer. So I sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-current-updates and then sudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-current-updates.

The replacement is the ip command. The modern equivalent of ifconfig on its own is ip address list.\nWhy has ifconfig been replaced with ip? Much new functionality has been added to Linux networking in the decades since ifconfig was written. This involved an entirely new API (netlink) for the userspace tool to speak to the kernel to configure the network. It was far more practical to write a new tool to better map the new functionality through the netlink API and down to the command line, than to try and adapt the old ifconfig tool. Check out the ip(8) manpage for all the cool new stuff that you can do now.\nThe kernel API used by ifconfig and the ifconfig tool itself remains for backwards compatibility, but this interface is blind to anything that does not easily map to the old model.\nThe reason that ifconfig doesn't show you the IP aliases is that it looks like they are being added by Debian's ifupdown (the package that handles /etc/network/interfaces) using a different mechanism that does not add the labels :1, :2, etc. So the ifconfig tool is blind to them, since the old API mandated these labels, and so the extra addresses do not map to the old API. From the ip-address(8) manpage:\n          Each address may be tagged with a label string.  In order to\n          preserve compatibility with Linux-2.0 net aliases, this string\n          must coincide with the name of the device or must be prefixed\n          with the device name followed by colon.\n\nThe bugs linked in maggotbrain's answer seem to be focused around adding support to ifconfig to read addresses without labels. Another approach might be to arrange for ifupdown to create the addresses with labels, such that ifconfig will be able to see them without modification.\n\nA: This is most likely a bug in the net-tools package and ifconfig specifically. \nSee the launchpad bugs here and here for additional information.\nIf you enter your interfaces manually, from the command line using ifconfig like this(following your above configuration):\nsudo ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.202.12 netmask 255.255.255.0\nsudo ifconfig eth0:2 192.168.202.13 netmask 255.255.255.0\nsudo ifconfig eth0:3 192.168.202.14 netmask 255.255.255.0\nsudo ifconfig eth0:4 192.168.202.15 netmask 255.255.255.0\nsudo ifconfig eth0:5 192.168.202.16 netmask 255.255.255.0\n\nYou will have those interfaces show up, as expected, when running ifconfig. \nThese changes will not show up in your /etc/network/interfaces, however. \nSo, you will need to add them in both places.\nNote: This is also not persistent across interface resets, so you will need to re-run the commands upon restarting the interface/machine.\n", "Q: Unity dash search I have my personal folders to a different partition other than home, I had a series of symlinks in my home folder pointing to the folders on the other partition.

If I click on this link I get a Could not find /home/username/Documents error.\nWhy is this and how do I delete these entries from Dash's records?\nIf deleting records is not possible, is there a way to \"reindex\" the dash search database?\nI deleted the ~/.local/share/zeitgeist folder but the problem persists.\nHow to I force \"locate\" to reindex?\n\nA: I found an answer in another similar question.\nBasically the problem was the old bookmarks in Nautilus.\nSo the solution was to open Nautilus, Bookmarks menu, edit bookmarks and then delete all the old bookmarks (that were not showing any longer in Nautilus.)\nProblem solved.\n", "Q: Record my desktop in mp4 format How do I record my desktop interaction (video) and audio directly in MP4 format?\nI have Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.\n\nA: There are a number of tools, but first you should ensure you have the MP4 codecs installed. See here for instructions.\nOnce that is done, there are a number of tools available to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*RecordMyDesktop\nsudo apt-get install recordmydesktop\n\n\n*Other tools referenced here - Istanbul, Kazam. There is also xvidcap.\n\nA: Use the following command:\nffmpeg -f oss -i /dev/audio -f x11grab -s 1280x1024 -r 3 -aq 50 -i :0.0 /tmp/out.mp4\n\nThis records both sound and video of my screen. I have an attached monitor, so :0.0 is that monitor. The -r 3 keeps the file size smaller by doing 3 frames per second, which causes the mouse to jerk around slightly, but is suitable for tutorials. Increase that 3 towards 30 for much higher quality (but larger file size). The -aq 50 stands for audio quality at 50%, which is suitable for listening to tutorials on your laptop, but not suitable for like a large conference, where removing the -aq option might be best.\n\nA: As stated in your comment on the answer about installing recordmydesktop, that application does not (currently) allow saving the output in mp4 format.\nThe solution that worked for me was to install Kazam. This allows screen recording (screencasting as they call it) and you can configure the output codec. MP4 is an option here.\nsudo apt install kazam\n\nOnce this is done, you can record and even edit the output in avidemux.\n", "Q: how can i safely remove an external hard drive?

Kindly advise if possible how to safely remove the drive.  Can the lost icon of the third drive and the datd contained in it be found, please?\nKind regards\n\nA: If you click on one of the partitions in the unity launcher, you can select \"safely remove parent drive\".  Wait a moment for any data to be written out.  If the device automounts again after a few seconds then repeat this operation and you will be able to remove the device.\nIf this is an earlier version that does not use unity (or does not have the remove device functionality)  You can unmount all of the partitions in Nautilus (filemanager) or with the umount command line and then it will be safe to remove the device.\nRemounting partitions after they have been unmount is a different question, and you may not be able to access the device at all if you have used the \"safely remove\" option, until you remove the device and re-insert it again.\n", "Q: What packages do I install to get WINE in 12.04?

I do not use pre-release (i.e. beta) versions of either Steam or Ubuntu.\n\nA: ~/Steam is only for log files  Downloaded data (client updates, etc) seam to go to ~/.steam instead.\nIf you don't want to pollute your $HOME, you can create a folder somewhere on a partition, give it your own user accounts's ownership and access rights and create some symlinks.\nI personally did before launching the Steam Client second time:\nsudo mkdir /opt/SteamFiles\nsudo chown myuser:mygroup /opt/SteamFiles\ncd ~\nln -s /opt/SteamFiles .steam\n\nAfter installing and updating the client, all game and Steam client data ended up under /opt/SteamFiles and installing games directly pointed me to my created file system.\nThis can easily shared between multiple Linux installations on the same PC.\n\nA: In newer versions of Steam, games seem to be located at:\n~/.steam/steam/SteamApps/common\nDon't know when this changed, but Steam is no longer in ~/.local/share\n\nA: It install in this path:\n/home/${USER}/Steam\n\nWhere ${USER} is the name of your ubuntu user.\n\nA: As other users have already said, Steam is installed under ~/.local/share/Steam (where the ~/ means /home/<username>). The games themselves are installed in ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common.\nHowever, when I attempted to find this directory in Wine, for some reason Wine wouldn't show any folder names starting with a \".\", so it couldn't find the .local folder in order to get to the Steam directory. I was able to resolve this by going up in the directory tree to My Computer and then drilling down into the correct drive letter for your Ubuntu file system, which for me was Z:. Note that C: is an internally used drive letter in Wine for compatibility with Windows applications and won't show your Ubuntu files. From there you have to find your /home directory and follow the folders down to your Steam directory, i.e. Z:/home/<username>/.local/share/Steam.\n\nA: It actually depends how you Installed Steam.\n(at least on 16.04LTS)\nVia the steam.deb on steampowered.com the location ist ~/.local/share/Steam\nVia ubuntu's own multiverse repository the location is ~/.steam\nThe second install method is the recommended one.\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/06/install-steam-on-ubuntu-16-04-lts\n\nA: The default install location appears to be ~/.local/share/Steam.  This is where Valve games are installed by default, which can't be changed using the Steam Libraries system.\nThe setup of this directory mirrors how Windows Steam is laid out, with the SteamApps folder containing both the .gcf files shared across Steam accounts and the individual steam account directories.\n\nA: If you installed the flatpack version you may find it here:\n~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.steam\n\nA: In my case I had a different place.\n~/.steam/steam\n~/.steam/ubuntu12_32/steam\n/usr/share/lintian/overrides/steam\n/usr/share/doc/steam\n/usr/games/steam\n\nThe best way to know (at least for me) is to go to the root and find for Steam or steam.\ncd /\nsudo find -name steam\n\n\nA: Mine are in ./.steam/steam/steamapps/common\n\nA: The directories on Linux is separated by user.\nAssuming the user name is John the user folder will be '/home/john/' and Steam directory will be:\n/home/john/.steam/steam/ # absolute path , i.e., full path\n#or\n$HOME/.steam/steam/ # using environment variable\n#or\n~/.steam/steam/\n\nAll above is the same\nThe character tilde ~ is the same of $HOME, both represent the 'home' directory.\n", "Q: Dash home - \"rdesktop \" opens Firefox I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS using Unity. When I go to Dash home (either by clicking the icon or pressing the \"Windows\" key), and try to run rdesktop, it doesn't work - it either:\n\n\n*\n\n*It either says \"Sorry, there is nothing that matches your search\" and does nothing, or\n\n*Opens a new Firefox window on a blank page.\nrdesktop works fine from the command-line, and I think it used to work OK from Dash as well, but I couldn't swear to that.\nDoes anybody have any idea what's happening here?\nThanks\nJohn G\n\nA: When I upgraded to 12.04 I found that there were problems running rdesktop, especially as I was trying to use shared clipboard via RDP, so I tried the current remote desktop package called remmina and have found it to be excellent. The main problem with this option is that it doesn't import all your previously saved rdesktop connections, but they are human-readable if you open the hidden .rdesktop folder in your profile folder.\nAs for rdesktop working from a command line, did you fresh install U12 or was it an upgrade from 11.10? If new, you must have installed rdesktop manually, in which case the dash ought to work, or if you copied it as an executable then the system won't put it in the dash. Run the Synaptic Package Manager (if a new installation of U12 you need to install it: sudo apt-get install synaptic). If installed properly, rdesktop will have a green box next to it.\nRemmina has the added advantage of sharing a local folder via RDP which shows up on the remote MS Windows machine as an extra drive. It's a good way to transfer files to and from the remote machine. Remmina also allows you to easily scale the remote desktop window, even in VNC. This helps me to manage customers' computers from my tiny netbook.\n", "Q: VPN (sort of) works in 12.04 but fails in 12.10 with the same settings My university uses a VPN system for internet connections. A couple of days ago I installed 12.04 on my computer and set up the VPN following a guide specific to linux here. It would work quite well, but disconnect every now and then, especially when I checked for new updates. After a few reconnections however, it would become stable until I powered down the computer. \nOn upgrading to 12.10 , the VPN would connect and then fail instantly whenever any network activity was attempted (checking for updates, loading a web page etc). I have now reverted back to 12.04 with a fresh install.\nSo I guess what I'm asking for is a bit of help as to what I should do next. Reinstall 12.10 and see if the issue disappears? Visit the university's IT helpdesk? My VPN settings are exactly the same as on their guide.\nThe VPN worked flawlessly with Windows installed. The computer is a HP dc7100 SFF.\nAny help would be much appreciated\nThanks in advance\nOli\n\nA: If you have any connectivity at all then your VPN settings are probably correct. That the connection falls away and that the problem got worse on upgrade to 12.10 support the hypothesis that the problem is with the network driver. Do you have another interface (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) which you are not using to connect to the Internet? Try connecting to the Internet only through that other interface and then connecting to the VPN. Does this solve the problem? If so then please file a bug report against the \"linux\" package at bugs.launchpad.net, describing your symptoms and mentioning the hardware and driver involved.\n\nA: I see the university instructions are a wee bit old. With 12.10 I have found that I get best results with \"Allow Stateful Encryption\" enabled, especially if the authenticating server is an MS Windows server.\n", "Q: How to remove GRUB Rescue prompt after deleting Ubuntu partition? I had a Windows 7 pc dual booting with Windows XP and then i got hold of Ubuntu 12.10 and I installed  it alongside Windows 7 and after installing on boot i got GNU GRUB interfering in my bootloader and after some days I by mistake formatted the parttion now my pc does not boot and shows grub rescue \n\nA: if you again install ubuntu (or any distro) alongside your windows then you can get both OSes again.Or if you dont want to use dual boot then install your windows again.You should format drive c while installing new windows in it.Your problem will be solved.\n", "Q: Terminal warning when opening a file in gedit I am getting the following error when running this command line: \nsudo /etc/ddclient.conf\n\nI installed ddclient by :\nsudo apt-get install ddclient\n\nIt does open the editor with the file in question, but what does the error mean?\n** (gedit:4090): WARNING **: Couldn't connect to accessibility bus: Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-cSWf9rWIYX: Connection refused\n\nThank you\n\nA: This seems to be a bug affecting Gnome software. See this link on launchpad:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1061554\nI get the exact same on both of my Ubuntu 12.10 machines from the command prompt but gedit then works as intended.\nIf you're having any difficulty editing the ddclient.conf file you could try nano which opens inside the terminal window, but otherwise I would ignore the warning message in this case.\n\nA: The shell command:\nexport NO_AT_BRIDGE=1\n\nprior to launch will squelch this annoying message.\n", "Q: which software to use for cleaning up files and increase performance of a computer under ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs system cleanup/optimization needed \n\ni am looking for a sofware that would clean up registry , temporary and log files on ubuntu.\nIs there an equivalent to the windows CCleaner freeware?\ncheers\n\nA: Usually, there is no need of a cleaning software to speed up an Ubuntu machine. There is no registry in Linux and temp files are on /tmp directory which is not saved when you shutdown the machine.\nLog files are on /var/log and have absolutely nothing to do with the speed of the machine (while they do not fill up the disk of course). Each log has several files because the old ones are compressed and a new one is created. The compressed (old) ones are usually in the form /var/log/logfilename.#.gz. Usually 2 files of each log are not compressed, the current one and the one before it (usually named logfilename.1). It is not needed and won't speed up your machine but if you need some small extra disk space, you can delete all the compressed ones if you don't need them (sudo rm /var/log/*.gz should work but you may need to do some adaptations depending on the names of your log files).\nA few little things you can do manually:\nDue to the package management automatic dependencies installations, you may have auto installed package that are not needed anymore. Remove them with: sudo apt-get autoremove\nLook at your swap to see if it is used heavily (not enough RAM):\nfree -m\n\nThe last line will tell you swap size, used and free. If use is high and you see on the above line -/+ buffers/cache that free memory is short, you may need to increase your RAM to speed up your machine. If swap is near 100% used, you need to increase swap space (but that is another question :) )\nBrowsers caches usually can be cleaned from the browser preferences.\nOr as suggested in other answers, you can use Ubuntu Tweak! :)\n\nA: You can use http://ubuntu-tweak.com/\nIt let you clean cache from browsers, packages no longer needed, old kernel, and many more.\n\nA: I don't think there's such thing as a registry in Ubuntu. You have a package index, package and config files, cookies, etc.\nTo clean up Ubuntu, you can use Ubuntu Tweak\nAlso, take a look at these tips\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Ugly/Inconsistent Theming in Ubuntu Gnome 12.10 Some applications are displaying really ugly widgets and menus. I think it's a GTK issue and perhaps more particularly, only applies to GTK2 apps but I'm not sure. The numerous questions on here that deal with GTK2 v GTK3 themes do not answer my problem. Here is my situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm using Ubuntu Gnome with Gnome Shell (installed using the \"upgrade\" instructions, rather than fresh install) with the default Adwaita theme\n\n*The reason I did an upgrade instead of fresh install is because I'm on a Macbook Air and there is no mac image/iso for Ubuntu Gnome\n\n*Previously, I did a fresh install of Ubuntu Gnome 12.10 and had no theming problems\n\n*Now, apps like nautilus, rhythmbox, brasero, even third-party ones like Lightread look exactly as expected but other apps, including Firefox, Inkscape, GIMP, Libreoffice look awful.\n\n*Some examples:\n\n*\n\n*Firefox with ugly location bar: http://ubuntuone.com/3e2X0JTa4CT4afC4303U9c vs nautilus location bar: http://ubuntuone.com/3TbHWWuNMcJnlpI4IpjiUO\n\n*GIMP file dialogue (like Windows 95!): http://ubuntuone.com/4ioCcqq3flgO7zAWgAhfWy vs the rhythmbox file dialogue (correct): http://ubuntuone.com/2xLplCOBvQnyeqdsTGdgXq\n\n*Menus in Libreoffice (very bad for usability): http://ubuntuone.com/26WTaEz4PMGmiItGeSmBjZ vs menus in rhythmbox: http://ubuntuone.com/4Ib4thMLqohsle6J5KEvuI\nI've been searching for a solution to this problem for some time. The logical explanation is that all the GTK3 apps are working and anything that is still using GTK2 is not. If that's the case though, why did the same installation (Ubuntu Gnome 12.10) and the same theme (Adwaita) previously work with all those GTK2 apps?\nDesperate for help!\n\nA: Thanks to dobey, I can answer my own question (and apologies for missing something so obvious).\nThe short answer is: you just need to install the pixbuf theme engine: gtk2-engines-pixbuf\nNB. This is basically the same as outlined in this question - I never found that question because it identifies the problem as verbose command line errors instead of ugly widgets and menus.\n", "Q: How connect to a ssh server from Nautilus on startup automatically? I try to connect to the server from the startup automatically. How could I do it to see the server files on Nautilus?\n\nA: I am not sure if this is what you are looking for, but I will write it anyway. Run Connect to server... and connect as usual. You can select remember password when asked. When connected, you can bookmark the location with Ctrl + D. Next time when you boot, just go to the location that you bookmarked. If you didn't choose to remember your password, you will be asked to enter it. Also, I'm using Ubuntu 10.04, so I'm not sure if this will be useful to you. Anyway, I hope this helped a bit.\n", "Q: Adjusting touchpad drag threshold? I find my self constantly dragging text, links, icons, and other things a few pixels by accident. Can I somehow increase the drag threshold? I thought at first it was because I use a trackpad, but I get the same unwanted behavior with a plain old mouse.\nI am using mostly Unity and sometimes GNOME in Ubuntu 12.10.\n\nA: It's in Settings -> Mouse and Touchpad. From there you can set Drag and Drop Threshold. I've got mine set pretty high for that reason.\n", "Q: Block a specific URL, not all domain As the title says, Is there a way to block a specific URL and not the whole domain?\nLet's say I want to block Google Images(google.com/imghp) but not Google (google.com) or block Facebook Groups (facebook.com/groups/) but not Facebook (facebook.com).\nI have tried with OpenDNS and the host file but can't still find a solution to this.\n\nA: How about using Dansguardian?\nInfo here and here\n", "Q: Replace /etc after reinstallation I reinstalled Ubuntu 12.04 after a corruption caused by a faulty operation (not much interesting but you can read about it). The old system had three partitions, one for boot, one for / and one for home. I followed these instructions to restore the system keeping my home dir. Basically what I did was:\n\n\n*\n\n*full backup of the old disc using dd \n\n*export the list of installed packages in the old system\n\n*reinstall Ubuntu 12.04 not formatting the partition containing home directories\n\n*reinstall the packages I had in the old system using the list of step 1.\n\n\nEverything still works and most of the settings have been kept, but not all. I have my desktop icons, my firefox bookmarks, etc. But other configurations have been lost.\nNow I'd like to replace the /etc of the new system with the /etc of the old one - I have a copy of it - so to have the same system as before, or at least very similar.\nBefore trying by myself to swap the new /etc with the old one I'd like to be aware of the possible issues which could arise, so to prevent bad things from happening again.\nAny thoughts or suggestions?\n\nA: If you are using the same computer you are probably safe but don't replace /etc/fstab, you want to use your new system partitions, not the old ones. \nIf this is a different system all hardware-related files (like hdparm.conf, sane.d) could cause trouble.\nIf you just want to transfer a couple of settings (like printers and network config) it's probably wiser to only copy the files and dirs that you want to keep.\n", "Q: Sony VAIO E Series - SVE15129CGB with ATI 7570 HD: Screen Brightness Adjustment I have been running Ubuntu for a long time now!

You should be able to mount an ntfs partition (guessing) via fstab without using fuse. (I do not know if this will break wubi installs)\nThat may gain you some speed, specially if you accessing any data on /host.\nNow your two examples are a different matter. If memory serves Minecraft is Java. You can try different java versions (like sun v.s. OpenJDK) or try some command line arguments. This post may help\nBlock Story I don't recognize. \nWubi however will result in a much slower system then a native install. Usually the bottle neck is around disk access. More details at that link.\nTL;DR; if you want the best performance don't use wubi. When benchmarking make sure to use something objective. Phoronix Test Suite is generally well liked. Run it in both Linux and windows then use that data to decide which is faster in what areas. Using games as your benchmark is not going to give you a good idea. \n", "Q: Libreoffice is losing the title of my doc files I am using Libreoffice Writer 3.6.2.2 with Ubuntu 12.10 amd64, nothing special, just the standard libreoffice that comes from the standard download of 12.10 amd64 from ubuntu.com. Each time I open a doc file (MS WORD) it loses the title and it displays only \"Untitled 1\" in the title and as a result when I hit the save button it ask me for a name and even when I chose the doc file format it still does not display the file in the list of the dialog so I can choose it and it forces me to retype the whole name.\nIt seems to even lose the location of the file as well, so the save dialog does not send me to the folder the file is located. \nAnother weird behavior is that even though libreoffice opens its icon on the left bar does not show the white arrow to indicate the programm is running as it does with all the other opened programms. \nIs this a known problem and if yes is there a fix ? I tried to google it but I have not found anyone else reporting this. \n\nA: it seems the file did not have the \".doc\" extension which cause the \"untitled\" problem. Still seems like a bug to me , but fortunately its a minor one .  \n", "Q: Running text editor as root uses another config I've created a Nautilus Action to edit files with sudo (gksudo) and the text editor that opens the file is always using a different configuration from the normal user.\nThe same thing happen when I run sudo gedit file or sudo subl file\nCan I fix this or is it a security measure?\n\nA: What happens in your case is that probably the configuration contains the option always_set_home which switches the home directory and thus the configuration to /root.\nSolutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use sudoedit for this purpose, which will preserve your environment. \n\n*You can check your sudo configuration using sudo visudo and comment out the always_set_home option\n\n*You can use sudo -E gedit file to preserve the environment\n\n\nI'm not aware of any security implications, but of course nasty things will happen if someone replaces the gedit configuration file with a symlink to a system file. But if you use sudo gedit it is assumed that you know what is going on on your system.\n\nA: This is because when you run anything with sudo you are running it as root, so your local profile/config is not applied. Things like the default window size, whether it makes backup copies of files and the like, will all be different. You can make changes to the configuration while running as root, and they will not apply to your normal user, only to root.\n", "Q: Is there a GUI client for Git? I am using git for version control of various projects.\nIs there GUI software for navigating through commits and branches of a project and for retrieving versions in git projects?\n\nA: There is also a relatively new (just released months ago) software called GitEye.\nIt provides a familiar graphical interface as it is based on Eclipse RCP framework.\nYou can use it on Windows and Mac as well, since it runs on java.\nGive it a try; it's free.\nSo far my only complain is that its merge tool is rather limited\n\nA: ungit seems like a powerful intuitive GUI for git.\n\nA: I use git extensions - I find it very helpful for what I need it for. Here's a link to getting it running on 12.04\n\nA: Having tested all the above mentioned tools, I have settled with the following tools for managing my Git repositories:\n\n\n*\n\n*SmartGit\n\n*RabbitVCS\nSmartGit\nSmartGit is an easy-to-use graphical user interface for Git with optimized work-flows. SmartGit supports all Git and Mercurial features needed for every-day work in software development projects:\n\n\n*\n\n*Local working tree operations \n\n*Status, diff, log\n\n*Push, pull, fetch (for all protocols)\n\n*Tag and branch management\n\n*Merge, cherry-pick, rebase, revert\n\n*Submodule support\n\n*Stash management\n\n*Remotes management\n\n\nI has also an easy to use wizard to connect you to online repositories like GitHub and BitBucket\n\nRabbitVCS\nIn contrast, RabbitVCS has a different approach from other tools. Rather than providing an external UI for your git repository, it integrates its self to Nautilus. In fact RabbitVCS is a set of graphical tools written to provide simple and straightforward access to the version control systems you use. \n\n\nA: If you are using Emacs (Which is fantastic), then you would find magit a super brilliant option :D\n\nA: Yes; git has a gui you can run with the git gui command.\nIf that doesn't work, it means you need to install the GUI for git. You can do this by installing the git-gui  package. Or, even better, install the git-all  package.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git-all\n\nSee man git-gui for details. Note that while the manpage is called git-gui, you run this as git gui.\n\nA: I guess you are looking for an easy to use front-end for git.\nTake a look at \"Graphical Interfaces\" section of InterfacesFrontendsAndTools page on Git Wiki.  There the following have been mentioned:\n\n*\n\n*gitk - graphical history browser, in Tcl/Tk, distributed with Git (usually in gitk package)\n\n*git gui - graphical commit tool, in Tcl/Tk, distributed with Git (usually in git-gui package)\n\n*QGit - uses Qt toolkit\n\n*Giggle - uses GTK+ toolkit\n\n*git-cola - uses PyQt4\n\n*gitg - GTK+/GNOME clone of GitX\n\n*tig - text mode interface for git, is GUI and pager, uses ncurses\n\nEdit: These are the suggestions given in the other answers.\n\n*\n\n*GitKraken\n\n*SmartGit\n\n*gitg\n\n*rabbitVCS\nThere are a couple of software which I personally find very easy to use.\n\n*\n\n*Giggle: I personally use giggle  . It is simple and intuitive to use.\n\n\n\n*Cola Git GUI: I have not used Cola Git , but this does seem promising.\n\n\nA: I used gitg for a while before going back to CLI only. For entertainment value, there's gource, which can turn your git history into an animation :)\n\nA: I am quite partial to smartgit. You can read more about it here It's by far the most complete git client on Linux that I have found. That being said, there is real strength in the command line, and I suggest you learn it well before using a GUI.\n\nA: Rather than downloading and compiling the tar.gz file from source(http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/index.html), there is a PPA on launchpad available that allows one to install smartgit using the normal apt-get commands.\nFrom a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+t), enter the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:eugenesan/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install smartgit \n\nThis will install the latest version of smartgit.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\n\nA: I'm on the team that develops GitKraken, so I'm a little biased, but I'd highly recommend you check it out. It's cross-platform so you can use the same tool in Windows, Mac and Linux and it comes with some other unique features including undo/redo, indexed search and a responsive, intuitive design. If GitKraken doesn't work for you, I've also used and had some success with Git Extensions (Windows) and GitHub Desktop (Windows/Mac).\n\nA: I wouldn't ever call it the best git client but I find it noteworthy that Meld also provides some basic version control functionality although it's main purpose is comparing files and directories:\nCiting the feature overview:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Meld supports many version control systems, including Git, Mercurial, Bazaar and SVN\n  \n*Launch file comparisons to check what changes were made, before you commit\n  \n*View file versioning statuses\n  \n*Simple version    control actions are also available (i.e.,commit/update/add/remove/delete files)\n  \n\nDepending on your purpose and workflow it could also be interesting to have a closer look at the version control plugin of your favourite IDE. I used such e.g. in Eclipse, Monodevelop and PyCharm.\n\nA: The Cola Git is simple but delivers what it promises, and the \nSmartGit is full of features!\n", "Q: Redirect network logs from syslog to another file I keep logging way to much info (not needed, for now) in my syslog, and not daily or hourly... but instant.

However this will quite all logging down. Something that you may not want to do. \nYou could instead, when you need to read that file do a \ntail /var/log/syslog -n 1000 | grep -v \"RT35xx|rt28xx\nusing -v will show only lines not matching and the argument is regex so you could get more complicated. However it looks as if that driver is just evil and the developers need a whomping for making it too verbose. \nSo, to recap:\nFirst try turning down the verbosity of the driver. That would be your best option.\nNext create some kind of grep statement that will filter out the lines you don't want.\nFinally, if nothing else works, or you don't care, turn down logging.\nIf you deiced to turn down logging note that you can be more selective and jsut turn down kernel logging.

I am pretty sure this is a Nautilus issue, but I have reached a dead end. I have one share that I can't mount using smb://server/share via nautilus. I get the following error.\n\nError: Failed to mount Windows share \n  Please select another viewer and try again\n\nI can mount this share from other machines(non-ubuntu) using the same credentials so I know I have perms on the destination share. I can mount other shares on other servers from my Ubuntu box so I am pretty sure I have all the smb packages I need on my Ubuntu box. To make thing more interesting, if I use smbclient from the command line, I mount this share with no problems from my Ubuntu box.\nSo here's what we know:\n\n\n*\n\n*destination share perms are ok (no problem accessing from other machines)\n\n*smb is setup correctly on Ubuntu box (access other windows shares no problem)\n\n*I only get the error when using nautilus\n\n*smbclient in terminal works, no problem\n\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Googling turned up simple mount/perms issues, and I don't think that is what is going on here.\nLet me know if you need more information.\nHugh\nUpdate 1:\ngvfs-mount smb://host/share failed with the following error:\n\nError mounting location: Failed to mount Windows share\n\nUpdate 2:\nJohn - \n\n\n*\n\n*I tried #1 and got the same error as above. \n\n*#2 is not an option. This is a production share and if I changed the name of the share it would break things for many users. \n\n*I tried #3 and got the same select another viewer and try again error.\n\n\nUpdate 3:\nI installed a Debian guest VM on this box. It can connect to this share without issue. I tried both gvfs-mount from the terminal and I tried it from nautilus. They were both successful.\nHere's some info on the Deb VM:\n$ uname -a\nLinux debian 2.6.32-5-amd64 #1 SMP Sun Sep 23 10:07:46 UTC 2012 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n$ dpkg -l |grep gvfs\nii  gvfs                                 1.6.4-3                           userspace \n$ dpkg -l |grep nautilus\nii  nautilus                             2.30.1-2squeeze1                  file manager and graphical shell for GNOME\n\nI hope this helps a little\nUpdate 4\nLooking at the logs was one of the first things I checked. Nothing gets logged to syslog with the mount fails.\nUpdate 5\n\n\n*\n\n*added share name to existing share and got the same error.\n\n*nothing in server event logs\n\n*tested a different share on same server and was able to connect. makes you think it is a perms issue, except I can connect to problematic share from command line via smbclient command.\n\n*I am not thrilled about the downgrade option\n\n\nA: I had this problem too and I'll bet yours is the same.\nIt only happened with some shares.  I had guest ok = Yes, but the permissions only allowed the owner to list the directory contents.\nFor example:\n[documents]\n    path = /home/ghodmode/Documents\n    read only = No\n    guest ok = Yes\n\n... and ...\nghodmode@server ~ % ls -dl /home/ghodmode/Documents/\ndrwxr--r-- 12 ghodmode ghodmode 4096 Dec 14 03:32 /home/ghodmode/Documents/\n\nThe result was exactly the error message you described.  This tells me that nautilus will access shares on a server as a guest user when it can even if it has already accessed other shares as a logged in user.\nThe default guest user is \"nobody\".\nThe solution for me was to change the permissions.  I suspect that setting guest ok = No would also work.\n\nA: Before you begin, double check the network location is typed correctly. This is one reason you will get this error. \\\\hostname\\share\nIn my case, I was able to resolve this issue after diagnosing that it was in fact a DNS issue.\nTry to ping the Windows machine in a terminal from Ubuntu:\nping <hostname>\n\nIf you cannot ping it via its hostname, try the IP address instead. If the IP address works, then you have a DNS issue where the DNS server is unable to resolve the IP address for the host.\nIn my organisation, we use an enterprise DNS with Windows Servers. Using the command prompt in Windows, run:\nipconfig /all\n\nTake each of the DNS Server entries and add them to the hosts file on the Ubuntu machine in /etc/hosts\nThe /etc/hosts file accepts entries as \"IP HOSTNAME\", example:\n10.1.2.1 mydnsserver1\n\nThe DNS should also be specified in the interfaces file\n/etc/network/interfaces, the specific lines you want to check are dns-nameservers and dns-search. dns-nameservers should be set to the entry you put in your hosts file above and can take multiple IP addresses, dns-search should be set to your domain (if in use). IP addresses are just examples.\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n        address 10.1.2.10\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        gateway 10.1.1.1\n        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed\n        dns-nameservers 10.1.2.1\n        dns-search mydomain.com\n\nCheck your /etc/samba/smb.conf file and ensure your workgroup is correct. Just in case.\nOnce you are satisfied, run this command:\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking force-reload \n\nAssuming all the settings are correct, you should be able to ping the host via its hostname which will in turn resolve the error.\n\nA: *\n\n*Lets create some short-hand for easy reading\n\n\n*\n\n*ProblemShare - Windwos share that Nautilus has problem mounting\n\n*ProblemServer - Windows server sharing the ProblemShare\n\n*ProblemMachine - Ubuntu machine/desktop having difficulty mounting the the above share.\n\n*ProblemAccount - Ubuntu account of ProblemMachine having problem mounting ProblemShare with Nautilus\n\n\n*Test #1\nOn ProblemMachine\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure system is not mounting any samba share (check /etc/fstab)\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Create a new user, then try mounting the ProblemShare with Nautilus.\nIf new user mount successfully, your Nautitlus and related package is not the issue.\n\n\n*Test #2\nOn ProblemMachine\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure system is not mounting any samba share (check /etc/fstab)\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Login ProblemAccount \n\n*Make sure desktop/Nautilus don't have any active samba mount, especially with ProblemServer.\n\n*Make sure there is no samba auto mount from login script\n\n*Logout then login ProblemAccount \n\n*Open Nautilus\n\n\n*\n\n*Click 'File' in menu bar(top of screen)\n\n*Select 'Connect to Server...'\n\n*Enter info\n\n*\n\n*Server: < ProblemServer name or IP, not URL format >\n\n*Type: Windows share\n\n*User name and Password, use your Windows credential\n\n\n*Once connected, select 'ProblemShare'\n\n\n\nIf this mount successful, your problem is caused by cached credential or credential in key chain.\n\nA: I got same error message, when I try to mount a windows drive which is not accessible by name, the solution is mount the windows drive by IP address.\n", "Q: Wubi on Win XP - it starts, unpacks, but then ends I try to start Wubi on and older Win XP PC.

Depending on your purposes, it might be better to just go with the bootable installer. \nThat said, there are two things that may be stopping you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not enough RAM. Wubi prefers 256MB of RAM, but you can force it to run with less, though it doesn't like it and may not work at all.\n\n*Not enough hard drive space. Wubi needs at least 5GB of hard drive space free in order to be able to install Ubuntu.

But the problem is when I plug the SD-card into my Pandaboard and start Minicom. this is my output:\nwalter@walter-RC530-RC730:~/Scrivania$ sudo minicom -s\n\n\nWelcome to minicom 2.5\n\nOPTIONS: I18n                                                                \nCompiled on May  2 2011, 10:05:24.                                           \nPort /dev/ttyUSB0                                                            \n\nPress CTRL-A Z for help on special keys                                      \n\n\nU-Boot SPL 2011.12 (Apr 02 2012 - 18:13:04)                                  \nTexas Instruments OMAP4460 ES1.1                                             \nOMAP SD/MMC: 0                                                               \nreading u-boot.img                                                           \nreading u-boot.bin                      \nmkimage signature not found - ih_magic = ea000014\nAssuming u-boot.bin ..                  \nreading u-boot.bin                      \n\n\nU-Boot 2011.12 (Apr 02 2012 - 18:13:04)\n\nCPU  : OMAP4460 ES1.1\nBoard: OMAP4 Panda                                                              \nI2C:   ready                                                                    \nDRAM:  1 GiB                                                                    \nWARNING: Caches not enabled                                                     \nMMC:   OMAP SD/MMC: 0                                                           \nUsing default environment                                                       \n\nIn:    serial                                                                   \nOut:   serial                                                                   \nErr:   serial                                                                   \nNet:   No ethernet found.                                                       \nchecking for preEnv.txt                                                         \nreading preEnv.txt                                                              \n\n** Unable to read \"preEnv.txt\" from mmc 0:1 **                                  \nHit any key to stop autoboot:  0                                                \nreading uEnv.txt                                                                \n\n** Unable to read \"uEnv.txt\" from mmc 0:1 **                                    \nreading boot.scr                                                                \n\n293 bytes read                                                                  \nLoaded script from boot.scr                                                     \nRunning bootscript from mmc0 ...                                                \n## Executing script at 82000000                                                 \nreading uImage                                                                  \n\n4434784 bytes read                                                              \nreading uInitrd                                                                 \n\n6608373 bytes read                                                              \n## Booting kernel from Legacy Image at 80000000 ...                             \n   Image Name:   Ubuntu Kernel                                                  \n   Image Type:   ARM Linux Kernel Image (uncompressed)                          \n   Data Size:    4434720 Bytes = 4.2 MiB                                        \n   Load Address: 80008000                                                       \n   Entry Point:  80008000                                                       \n   Verifying Checksum ...

If you go into \"System Monitor\" and look at the running processes, you'll see a breakdown of what's using your system resources. Dollars to donuts the bulk of it is Unity and Firefox.\nAlso, to give you an idea of just how resource intensive a window manager and desktop environment actually is, the minimum recommended RAM for Ubuntu Desktop is 512MiB, while Ubuntu Server (which has no window manager or desktop environment by default) only requires 128MiB, and the only real difference between the two is the presence of the desktop environment and window manager.\n", "Q: No WiFi on dell vostro 2520 after update to 12.10 I have installed 12.04 on a dell vostro 2520 (previously 11.10) and wifi is gone now but wired network remains.

I saw a Windows beta version so heres hoping, it would just be nice if I could find a GTK version.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install amarok --no-install-recommends will download what's only necessary for Amarok to run (only 69MB <-these are the dependencies) and it will use 199MB when installed (which I guess is what you mean).\nAmarok will probably never be written in GTK as it's part of KDE.\nthere is however Listen a GTK based player similar to Amarok.\n\nListen is an audio player written in Python. Thanks to it, you can    easily organize your music collections.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*It supports many features such as Podcasts management, browse\nShoutcast directory.\n\n*It provides a direct access to lyrics, lastfm and wikipedia\ninformations.\n\n*It intuitively creates playlists for you by retrieving informations\nfrom lastfm and what you most frequently listen to\n\n\n\nAnd let's not forget Exaile which is also similar to Amarok but to a lesser degree, it's available in the repositories.\nsudo apt-get install exaile\n\n\n", "Q: bluetooth not working after installing Ubuntu 12.04 I've tried hci0 reset.

Trying to save some data from an old XP machine, and I am hoping to boot up with a Ubuntu disk that will allow me to go in grab files on machine, and then install XP \n\nA: Yes, it is very much possible.\nJust download the latest Ubuntu Image and create a Live DVD.\nNow, boot from your DVD and select the Try Ubuntu Option.\n\nYou can find more details in the Ubuntu site.\n\nA: Yes, if an ISO is bootable when written to a CD, it is also bootable when written to a DVD.\nActually, if you're trying to use Ubuntu 12.10 you must use a DVD because the ISO is too big to fit on a CD.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD\n\nA: If you only want to grab some files from that old pc, its easier with SystemRescueCD. \nThat is a Linux distro with only a few programs ( partitioning, memtest, file manager, antivirus, xfce desktop) and small memory usage. Perfect for old machines.\nYou can fint it on this site\nIt's like a Swiss knife.

See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootSectorFix\n", "Q: Image viewer with mousewheel scrolling Is there an image viewer which allows the user to scroll the zoomed image using the mouse wheel?\nIt's a crucial functionality, which I'm missing in EOG, gThumb etc...\n\nA: Unfortunately, it seems difficult to configure most image viewing software like gthumb, shotwell, or eog to do this. There doesn't seem to be any hidden options available in dconf-editor or gsettings after investigation.\nThere are two possibilities, however:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first is Pinta, which is available in the repositories and supports scrolling a zoomed image well. It supports using the mouse scroll wheel to scroll vertically, and you can also click to scroll horizontally.\n\n\n*The second is to use firefox in conjunction with the image zoom 0.4.6 addon, and then you can zoom into the picture and indeed scroll it. Firefox supports most image formats, and you can just right click and open an image in Firefox or open it like this:\nfirefox /home/mike/Pictures/IMG_1207.JPG\nwhich will then be displayed in the browser at the local address of\nfile:///home/mike/Pictures/IMG_1207.JPG\nFirefox can be used like a file manager for local or network files and most images formats like jpg, tif, gif, png can be opened.\nAs you can see in the screenshot below, there are settings for the scroll zoom when you go to firefox > addons > image zoom > preferences. Scrolling using both the middle mouse wheel or the two fingers mode on the touchpad works as well.\nAs noted in the description for the addon, you can use it to:\n\neasily zoom in, zoom out, fit image to screen or set custom zoom on individual images...All this can be done by using the context menu or a combination of mouse buttons and scroll wheel. \n\nJust open the image in firefox, zoom it up and then you are able to scroll it; it is about the best way of achieving what you want at the minute and I use it regularly. \n\n\nA: Eye of Gnome, eog\nIn 16.04 LTS\nThere are scrolling functions in eog. This is how it works in my 16.04 LTS with eog version 3.18.2-1ubuntu2.1\nWhen the cursor is\n\n\n*\n\n*in the picture itself, the scroll wheel zooms in and out,\n\n*on the vertical scrollbar, the scroll wheel scrolls upwards and downwards,\n\n*on the horizontal scrollbar, the scroll wheel scrolls to the left and to the right.\nTwo finger scrolling works in the same way (I tested in my laptop).\n\nI prefer to press the left mouse button in the picture itself and move it, which makes the picture move with the cursor. This works not only with the mouse but also with a touchpad: press the left button and move a finger to make the picture move with the finger alias pan the picture.\n\nIn Bionic Beaver (to become 18.04 LTS)\nI tested eog version 3.28.0-2 in Bionic Beaver Beta-2 in a Dell Latitude E7240 with a touch screen.\nThe mouse and touchpad work as in the older versions, but there is also new functionality, when you use the touch screen. You can zoom with two fingers (by moving the fingers from each other), and you can move one finger (or two fingers) to make the picture move with the finger(s) alias pan the picture. \nIt works like in a smartphone.\nThe working mode can change so that moving one finger can zoom and also flip the picture (rotate by 90 degrees). I have not tested enough (in the Dell Latitude E7240) to learn what makes the working mode change.\nUbuntu Development version / How to participate\n\nA: I haven't found a program which lets you scroll an image after clicking the mouse wheel button.\nBut Faststone Image Viewer lets you zoom to actual size by holding the mouse button, and while holding it you can scroll around easily with the mouse. When the button is released the image goes back to default. You can switch from actual size and default size with key commands A and B.\n\nA: I was having a very similar problem, but Chrome worked for me. I needed to work with many designs thus all of them must remain open. \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Chrome window in case you are working with multiple images. \n\n*Focus this windows before doing steps below.\n\n*In the file explorer select all your images and right click.\n\n*Choose Open with Another application \n\n*Search / Choose Chrome. Sometimes you have to click on \"See all applications\". \n\n\nAfter doing so, all your images will be loaded as tabs in a separate window, and the scrolling just scrolls, not zooms. \nAs an added benefit you can use your Chrome extensions as a color picker, just remember to give the permission to access files to the respective extensions. \nI tried to use also measure plugins but I think those plugins are not aware of the use case of measuring files (in this case images) or there is some technical impossibility that impedes to work that way.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: can i sync folders with windows and linux? I use windows and now ubuntu and want to use ubuntu one to backup and sync files between them both so no matter what OS I use, I have the latest synced files.

All following\n          arguments to find are taken to be arguments to the command until\n          an  argument  consisting of `;' is encountered.

Both  of  these\n          constructions might need to be escaped (with a `\\') or quoted to\n          protect them from expansion by the shell.  See the EXAMPLES sec‐\n          tion for examples of the use of the -exec option.  The specified\n          command is run once for each matched file.  The command is  exe‐\n          cuted  in  the starting directory.   There are unavoidable secu‐\n          rity problems surrounding use of the -exec  action;  you  should\n          use the -execdir option instead.\n\n   -exec command {} +\n          This  variant  of the -exec action runs the specified command on\n          the selected files, but the command line is built  by  appending\n          each  selected file name at the end; the total number of invoca‐\n          tions of the command will  be  much  less  than  the  number  of\n          matched  files.   The command line is built in much the same way\n          that xargs builds its command lines.  Only one instance of  `{}'\n          is  allowed  within the command.  The command is executed in the\n          starting directory.\n\n\n\nA: To find files (or directories!) without a dot, use the extended file matching pattern \n!(*.*)\n\nYou need shopt -s extglob -- I think that option is on by default in interactive shells.\nTo delete executable files in bash\nshopt -s extglob nullglob\nfor file in !(*.*); do\n    [[ -f $file && -x $file ]] && echo rm \"$file\"\n    # -f -> true if it's a file\n    # -x -> true if it's executable\ndone\n\n\nA: A binary file will have the executable bit marked. \nSo you can write a simple bash script which checks if the executable bit is set, and if so delete the file.\n", "Q: Function inside .profile results in no log-in I've created a custom function in my .profile, and I've added right at the bottom, after my custom aliases :\n# custom functions\nfunction eclipse-gtk {\n       cd ~/development/eclipse-juno\n       ./eclipse_wb.sh &\n       cd -\n}\n\nThe function starts a custom version of my eclipse. \nAfter I've added it, because I didn't wanted to log-out/log-in, I've reloaded my profile with the command:\n. ~/.profile\n\nand then I've tested my function by calling eclipse-gtk and it worked  without any issue.\nToday when I booted, I couldn't log in.

My host operating system is Windows 7 - 64 bit, running VMWare Workstation 9.0.1. I have a virtual machine running Ubuntu 12.10 - 64 bit. When I attempt to put VMWare in \"Unity mode\", I get the following message:\nThe virtual machine cannot enter Unity mode because:\n- Unity is not supported on the guest operating system.\n\nFrom the VMWare site, there is nothing listed that says that Ubuntu is not supported for this... and I have installed the latest vmware-tools on the guest operating system. It seems like a lot of people have had this issue, but I haven't seen a good resolution to it yet. Does anyone know how to get Unity mode working with Ubuntu?\n\nA: My two cents.\nI've installed several flavors of Ubuntu on virtual machines, using both VMware Player and Virtualbox, and Vincent's answer is absolutely correct. VMware hates the Ubuntu desktop called Unity (unfortunately, as mentioned before, this shares a name with VMware's own Unity Mode). This is just one more reason to avoid Ubuntu's proprietary desktop.\nMy suggestion, is you MUST use Ubuntu, try Xubuntu, which uses the XFCE desktop, and is fully compatible with both VMware's Unity Mode, and Virtualbox's Seamless Mode. As an added bonus, XFCE is lighter, faster, offers a better workflow, and (IMO) prettier that Unity Desktop, which I avoid like the plague.\nAnother option, which may be even better than using XFCE, is to use a more stable distribution that utilizes the older Gnome 2 desktop. An excellent choice for this is CentOS, which is a fully RedHat compatible distribution. It works perfectly with VMware. It is not suitable for those that want the newest, prettiest, most cutting edge software (i.e. Pipelight, newer versions of LibreOffice, etc...) but if you want a rock solid development, programming platform that is VERY bug free it would work very well. \nLast thought, Linux Mint's MATE desktop is simply a Gnome 2 fork, so would probably offer an excellent alternative for those who need cutting edge software and VM compatibility. It also has the advantage of being based on Ubuntu, so there would be no need to adjust to the idiosyncrasies of a new Linux distro.\nAnyhow, that is altogether too much info, but it's late, and I can't sleep. I hope this was marginally helpful.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I thought it is just Ubuntu 12.10, so I setup 12.04 in Vmware Workstation 9 and had the same result. You're right, it's hard to find the solution for this.

Unfortunately, that is a moot point since VMWare just got rid of Unity for both Linux hosts and guests.  This is effective on Workstation 12 and VMWare Player.  Just an FYI when people upgrade either product and find Unity Mode doesn't work anymore even on XFCE.\n\nA: A bit outdated now, but it seems like they have removed it completely for every Linux guest in Workstation 12\n\nThe following features have reached end of life in Workstation 12 Pro and have been removed:\n\n*\n\n*Unity mode on Linux guest and host operating systems\n\n\nhttps://pubs.vmware.com/Release_Notes/en/workstation/12pro/workstation-12-release-notes.html\n", "Q: Install apps to another disk I have very little space left on my main hard drive (the one that I installed Ubuntu on) and need to install apps from the software center to another disk like in Windows XP. How can I proceed in doing this?\n\nA: In Linux all files are organized into a single tree so there's no notion of \"other drive\" as in Windows. Your partitions are mounted into that tree as directories, so basically the problems boils down to moving files to another directory, while making the system think the files are still in their original location.\nTo achieve that, you can replace any directory with a symlink to another directory, possibly on another partition:\nmv /some/dir /mnt/otherdisk/some/dir\nln -s /mnt/otherdisk/some/dir /some/dir\n\nthe only tricky part is that non-root partitions may be mounted later in the boot process than the program is needed which is now located on that partition, so you need to exercise common sense when doing that.\nAlternatively, you can mount some root directories, say, /home, /opt, /var to another partition.\nYou can also resize the root partition to make it bigger. \nBefore doing anything drastic though - have you deleted old kernels, apt cache and other cruft which accumulates over time recently? You may find that you're not that short on space.\n", "Q: Save last \"copy\" from clipboard to file I am able to copy a massive string of text but unable to paste it anywhere without the program crashing.\nSo, I wonder: How can I fetch it from the clipboard via CLI and save it to a file instead?\nThanks!\n\nA: xclip is the command line interface to X selections (clipboard)\nxclip -o > helloworld.c\n\nYou may need to modify the command depending on the selection you're using\n   -selection\n          specify  which  X  selection  to use, options are \"primary\" to use XA_PRIMARY (default), \"secondary\" for XA_SECONDARY or\n          \"clipboard\" for XA_CLIPBOARD\n\n\nA: I created a file browser extension for that :) +info.\nBest regards.\n", "Q: fglrx: No matching Device section for instance... found. how to fix it?

It is here: /home/your_name/.mozilla/firefox/randomstring.default\nIn there, look for a subfolder called chrome. If it doesn't exist, create it.\nIf chrome does exist, look for a file called userContent.css. Otherwise, create an empty file with this name in the chrome folder.\nNow open userContent.css with a text editor and paste in this code:\nINPUT, TEXTAREA {color: black !important; background: #aaaaaa !important; }\nSave the file (as plain text) and close the text editor.\nRestart Firefox.\nYou should now have black text on a light gray background. You can use whatever color combination you prefer.\nNotes: \nchrome and userContent.css are case-sensitive and should be spelled correctly.\nThe settings here will take precedence over those in the OS theme and will remain the same in Firefox irrespective of which gtk theme you switch to.\n(By the way, you maybe interested in the Stylish extension and a whole variety of styles created by users and hosted at userstyles.org.)\nEdit:\nI'm providing some links related to users wanting Firefox not to be influenced by the OS (gtk) theme.

How do I update my operating system to ubuntu 12.10 when I am already using 12.04? How can I create a disc onto which to load ubuntu 12.10 O/S from the ubuntu 12.04 O/S?\n\nA: If you are updating from 12.04, you can simply update through the update manager. Since 12.04 is a LTS release (Long Term Support), you will first need to go to the window Software Sources and in the last option of the third tab (Updates) state that you are interested in being informed of every new release of Ubuntu (first option in the drop-down list). You will need to enter your code.\nNow you can close the window, open the software updater and it will tell you that Ubuntu 12.10 is available.\nAnother option is to burn it to a disc or make a USB for booting by downloading the image from www.ubuntu.com and use either Brasero for burning CD's or the USB creator application to make a start-up USB, which you can boot from upon system start-up.\nI'm a bit confused by the title of your question. Are you using Windows or Ubuntu already?\n\nA: there are two option \n1- update by using Terminal \n>sudo apt-get update\n\nthen\n>sudo do-release-upgrade\n\n2 - update by using update-manager\n2.1 open update-manager \n2.2 click Settings in the Update Manger\n2.3 then select Normal Releases from the Release Upgrade menu.\n2.4 check for upgrades again, and you’ll be notified that Ubuntu 12.10 is available for   upgrade.  \n2.5 Click the Upgrade button to get started.\nclick here to watch my video that show you how to update Ubuntu 12.04 to 12.10 \n", "Q: CPU Temperature above normal (92 C) I have just installed Ubuntu 12.04 and after running it on my laptop for few hours I decided to check the CPU temperature with acpi -t and it said 92 degrees Celsius\nWhen I ran windows 7, it always shows between 48 and 51 Degrees C, anyone know what might be causing this overheating problem.\n\nA: I would recommend if you already updated the system with the latest packages (And also installed the proprietary drivers for your video card if it applies) installing powertop:\nsudo apt-get install powertop\nThen run it from a terminal like so: sudo powertop\nIt will show you what is using so much power. If you press the right arrow key and go to the last option called \"Tunables\" it should show you what optimizations you can do to lower the temperature.\n\nAside from powertop, there are also a couple of others like Jupiter and TLP.

I just want to install VLC latest from 12.04 LTS to 10.04 LTS\nHow to do it?\n\nA: One of the methods of installing a software not in the standard ubuntu repos but through apt-get is by using a Personal Package Archive (ppa). All ppa's are hosted on http://launchpad.net. On searching, i found that one of the ppa has the version of vlc that you require (vlc-2.0.4 ).\nhttps://launchpad.net/~n-muench/+archive/vlc.\nThis has all the dependencies vlc-2.0.4 needs.\nAdd this ppa to your system like so:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:n-muench/vlc2\n\nThen update your sources by:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen install again:\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nThat should do it. I tried and it works. You can install from other ppa as well but make sure it builds successfully by checking in the right hand side of the ppa's main page.\n\nA: As of today, the latest version of VLC available now is 2.0.4, which is the same one available in Ubuntu 12.10, so if you upgrade to Ubuntu 12.10, you will have the latest version of VLC\n\nSince you are in 10.04 release, the VLC version you can get from Synaptic is only the one in 10.04 repos.\nIf you want a more recent version of VLC, you can get the .deb package from the this website.\nBut the problem is that the dependencies of the latest VLC version may not be present in your current 10.04 repos. In that case, you would have to go manually install them and then their dependences and so on.\nThis defeats the purpose of having a package management system.\nSo, if you want to use a latest version of VLC (say available in 12.04 repos), I suggest you upgrade your system to 12.04.\n", "Q: Upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 without losing files? I accidentally exited the window asking me to upgrade to 12.10, and now I can't find a way to upgrade other than wiping my drive and installing the latest iso. \n\nA: Run this command in the terminal\nupdate-manager -c\n\nThis will check for the latest distribution available. This should hopefully show Ubuntu 12,04.\nIf that does not solve your problem, try running\nupdate-manager -d\n\n\nA: Have you opened the update manager?  It allows you to update and upgrade the system via a graphical interface.\n \nInstall any security updates, then open Update Manager's settings.\n \nMake sure your settings look the same as mine.  Especially make sure that 'Notify New Ubuntu Version' is set to 'For Any New Version'.  Then run Update Manager again.\n\nA: For a GUI version of Karthik's method:\nWhen you are in Update Manager, click on Settings. Go to the Updates tab and change \"Notify me of a new Ubuntu Version\" from \"For long-term support versions\" to \"For any new version\". You will have to enter your password.\nThen Close that window and click Check. It should notify you near the top that \"New Release '12.10' is available\" and have an Upgrade button.\nThis method works for any version of Ubuntu to the next version, at least since 9.04, likely longer. Keep in mind that doing an upgrade instead of installing fresh (with a backup of your home directory and any other data) always has the possibility of causing hiccups.\n", "Q: Why does rebooting with control alt delete not require superuser privileges When you press Control Alt Delete in a Terminal, your system reboots. This does not prompt for authentication to reboot. However, running sudo reboot does require authentication as a sudoer to execute. These commands appear to be doing the same thing. Why does one of them require superuser privileges, and the other does not?\n\nA: Ctrl-Alt-Del combination only works when you're at the physical keyboard connected to the machine (as opposed to being connected to a remote machine via an SSH session). So it only works if you have physical access to the machine. In this case, asking for a password makes no sense - you can just use Reset button or even unplug the machine from the wall socket or pour a cup of coffee inside it - all those actions will effectively shut it down without asking for a password.\nYou can disable this feature if you want: see Console Security in Ubuntu wiki\n", "Q: enabling initrd and kernel boot messages grub2 In the changelog for grub2 on ubuntu, I noticed that several versions ago it was decided by the maintainers to:\nSuppress kernel/initrd progress messages, except in recovery mode\nThis is counter productive for server installs as it can render a system unbootable and without a method to learn about the possible problem. My question is simple - how does one revert to showing all initrd and kernel boot messages including the processing of init.d scripts before the login prompt? (ie. enable printing of all initrd/kernel progress messages)\nI've tried the various \"solutions\" discussed in answer to similar questions and cannot find a simple, works-everywhere solution. FYI, I'm using grub version 1.99-21, but afaics the change to suppress kernel/initrd progress messages was made well before that version.\n\nA: Answering my own question, the following steps can be taken to enable initrd and kernel boot messages. Please be aware that I'm doing this only on a server install with no graphical environment.  Desktop users may be unconcerned with a lack of boot nessages. So, take an unmodifed /etc/default/grub and make two changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the 'quiet splash' options from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT\n\n*Uncomment GRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\n*As root or using sudo, run update-grub and reboot\n\n\nIf you want to take a further step and also obtain a console something like the old kernel option 'vga=xxx' would give, see the following url:\nhttp://frontseed.com/entry/enable-frambeuffer-ubuntu-karmic-koala-using-grub2\nFollowing the steps there, I only found it necessary (at least for ubuntu-12.04-1) to:\n\n\n*\n\n*add 'vesafb' and 'fbcon' to /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and run \n\n# update-initramfs -u\n\n\n*edit /etc/default/grub, adding only (for my desired screen resolution):\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=\"1024x768\" then update-grub and reboot.\nThe solution isn't perfect, but is as close as I can get to a similar boot screen as with other distros that are still using grub-legacy.\n", "Q: Error message \"failed to download repository information\" when attempting to check for updates via update manager \nThis comes up sometimes when I attempt to check for updates.

I was wondering how and if it is possible to install Ubuntu on this hard disk without it giving me an error message. I have tried the alternate install disk image and the regular desktop image and get basically the same error message. Is there a way to somehow override this and get it installed\n\nA: If the hard disk is failing, it needs to be replaced. Even if you managed to get an OS installed on it again, the drive could become worse off quickly enough, and the system could become unusable at an unknown point in the future, and render the disk completely inaccessible, and the data unrecoverable. Your best option is to replace the drive.\n\nA: If it is a failing hard drive I would buy a new hard drive. \nYou could try getting a cheap external hard drive and putting it on that.

I'd like to know if it's possible to make Ubuntu One automatically download data changes that have been uploaded automatically to Ubuntu One from one computer to the equivalent data file in the other.    \nClarifying a bit further,  I've installed Red Notebook in both computers and so they each have their own /.rednotebook/data folder containing a series of .txt files corresponding to the monthly entries in each of them.  These are sync'd to upload any changes to those .txt files to Ubuntu One.   My question is can I,  and if so how,  do I make Ubuntu One automatically download and replace those .txt files in the other computer after they've been updated and uploaded from the first computer?  \nI did labouriously manage to download all those text files which had been uploaded from the first computer,  from Ubuntu One  one-by-one to the second computer,  but what I want to do is automate this process and that's where I'm stuck.\nI'm aware that things could get a bit complicated if both my computers were on-line at the same time and both were simultaneously making different Red Notebook entries,  so that's not the scenario I'm trying to cover.   All I want to achieve is that whatever updates to the files have been uploaded by one computer,  will automatically be downloaded to the same-named files in the other computer as soon as that second computer appears on line and detects that Ubuntu One has matching but more recent sync'd files than the ones it's holding.     \n\nA: If the folders are synchronized on both computers, and thus subscribed on both computers, then Ubuntu One will keep them in sync, while they are connected to the service.

I erased the partitions used for the Ubuntu 12.04 with EaseUS partition Manager.\nHowever, when I start my PC, there is still the option of \"Ubuntu 12.04\" to chose, is that bad?\nAnd what about now, can I use the Windows Installer of Ubuntu ( http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-ubuntu-with-windows ) to install the Ubuntu 12.10 ?

(good read)\nWhat's the difference between Wubi and a regular \"alongside Windows\" installation?\nTo answer your first question:\nThe fact that you still get grub after deleting the ubuntu partition means that your original installation(12.04) was done using Wubi as well. Then just deleting the partition will not tell wubi that the installation has been removed. That is the reason the entry is still showing up. ( your first link isnt really accessible, thats why im guessing that you used Wubi for 12.04 insallation ). If you feel having a dead link to an old installation is bad, then yeah, its bad. Apart from that, it wouldn't really do you any harm.\nps:Im still curious about the \"wierd message\".

Kindly let me know if there are upgrades for changing my version of Ubuntu.\nThank you for your kind help.\n\nA: You could only upgrade from 10.10 to 12.10 by first upgrading to 11.04, 11.10, then 12.04 LTS, and finally to 12.10 ..\nMaverick: end-of-life reached on April 10, 2012\nHowever, Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick) is no longer supported, and so upgrading from 10.10 to 11.04 is also not supported.\n\n\n*\n\n*Any upgrade should only be attempted if your are fully updated for the current release. Put more simply, the start and end points are both moving targets.\n\n*Any upgrade problems may directly relate to behavior of the unsupported release you are updating from. The upgrade can be attempted, but lacks 'support'.\n\nOnce you have your data and settings backed-up, you should do a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on your PC. There may be initial issues with drivers, but this should mostly be resolved by doing an update.\nOnce you have 12.04 LTS working, then try out (but do not immediately install) Ubuntu 12.10. This should also work on your PC, but will in turn be replaced by 13.04, etc.\nI have successfully run 12.04.1 LTS on an HP Mini netbook (Atom processor, 1GB RAM) or ex-corporate desktops (P4 2.8GHz, 1GB RAM).\n\n\nUPDATE:\nActually 11.04 is also no longer supported.\nNatty: reaches end-of-life on October 28, 2012\nThe problem is that for releases that are no longer being maintained, upgrading from these releases may have issues which are not likely to be resolved. The release being upgraded to also needs to be supported, otherwise the user is on their own.\nUbuntu / Canonical do support longer usage (without upgrading), but only for the Long Term Support (LTS) iterations. These are usually released only every two years.\n\nA: For upgrading Ubuntu, go to the Update Manager. It has to tell you that a Ubuntu update is available since you are still on 10.10. If it does not tell you this, go to Software Sources to ensure that you allow the system to propose you Ubuntu updates when they are available. Once you see that a Ubuntu update is available on the Update Manager, click on the button near it and follow the instructions. Note that it might propose you intermediate upgrades before 12.10. I especially think to 12.04 LTS.\n", "Q: Unity elements sometimes appear while full screen in Virtualbox - how to stop it? Launcher is great, and it helps me finds stuff. I have the latest release of 12.\nBut when I'm full screen in VirtualBox running another operating system and I hit some key combination I haven't yet figured out, Unity suddenly grabs keyboard focus. It might be alt-tab, it might be left-control x. I have physically pulled both the windows key and FN key off my laptop because they get in the way, so it's probably not the windows key.\nYou don't know the focus has been stolen because the full screen app (VirtualBox) is still full screen and the Unity element is in the background. But you're busy typing into a Unity box, not your foreground application.\nThis is particularly annoying. In my screenshot (taken from a camera, because the built in screen capture program can't capture a screenshot containing the launcher...) the windows VM is the foreground application, but the \"Run Command\" entry box has come up and is capturing the keyboard:\n\nI would like a foreground full screen app to stay that way.\nIs there a way that I can keep Unity but only have it activate its elements (e.g. pop out with its search box) if I physically click a button, not type some random key combination that foreground applications can get confused about? Otherwise I can do without the launcher or other elements, because doing my actual work is more involved than just launching programs.\n\nA: The best way to run virtualbox without any interference with the host operating system (Unity in your case) is create a special session for Virtualbox from your login manager (Lightdm).\nThe best is following this process\nhttp://www.ashokgelal.com/2008/10/run-your-virtual-os-directly-from-gdm-in-ubuntu/\nIt's applied to GDM but should working also with Lightdm.\n\nA: LightDM is optimized for unity.\nGDM is optimized for gnome.\nI had this problem with elements of unity too, when I tried to play crysis2 under unity with LightDM. - in this case it helped when I changed at login-manager to gnome and played crysis2 under gnome - that was in 12.04 - ( I did not play much, because of nvidia-frickle after new kernel of 12.10 - crysis2 was not starting any more - so I make a break in December/January with chess ).\n", "Q: Wireless broken by updates \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to Install Broadcom / STA Wireless card (BCM43XX) \n\nI just ran updates in 12.10 using update manager & now my wireless is not working.

While running XBMC, I can adjust the volume of the XBMC application itself. However, this volume is limited by the current system volume. For example, if the system volume is at 80% and XBMC is at 100%, I am effectively at 80% and cannot go higher. Or if the sound is too soft and needs a boost, I would normally increase the system volume beyond 100%.\nXBMC takes over the whole screen, so the system volume is not accessible. Pressing the Super key brings up the dash and top menu, but clicking on it is difficult and inconsistent, and very quickly XBMC takes over the screen again.\nHow can I adjust the system volume without having to quit XBMC?\n\nA: I had the same problem, that's why I wrote a little script to start xbmc that first gets the current volume, then sets the system volume to 100%, starts xbmc, and after exiting, resets the volume to the original level. That way controlling the volume in xbmc is the same as controlling the system volume since the system volume is on max.\nHere is the script:\ndevice=1\nvolume=$(pacmd list-sinks | sed \"1,/index: ${device}/d\" | grep volume | head -1 | awk ' {print $3}')\nmute=$(pacmd list-sinks | sed \"1,/index: ${device}/d\" | grep muted | awk ' {print $2}')\npactl set-sink-mute $device 0\npactl set-sink-volume   $device 100%\nxbmc \npactl set-sink-volume   $device $volume\nif [[ $mute == \"yes\" ]]\nthen\npactl set-sink-mute $device 1\nfi\nexit;\n\nThe first line sets your audio device id. I have hdmi (device 0) and analog (device 1), you can check this with alsamixer or pacmd list-sinks. It also automatically unmutes your system, and when you exit xbmc it mutes it again if it was previously muted.\nNote: you can also boost your volume to 150 instead if you find the volume too low, however you can also do this in xbmc in the audio osd settings.\n\nA: When searching for \"XBMC change system volume\" this question pops up as the first result. The current answers are not bad, but with the newer versions of XBMC it can be solved differently with script execution.\nBy editing the keyboard.xml file you can change the keybindings to execute scripts. Location of keyboard.xml on all systems\nI created a new keyboard.xml  file in /home/USER/.xbmc/userdata/keymaps/ with the following content:\n<keymap>\n  <global>\n    <keyboard>\n      <volume_mute>RunScript(/home/USER/Scripts/mute.py)</volume_mute>\n      <volume_down>RunScript(/home/USER/Scripts/lower_volume.py)</volume_down>\n      <volume_up>RunScript(/home/USER/Scripts/raise_volume.py)</volume_up>\n    </keyboard>\n  </global>\n</keymap>\n\nThis overrides the default behaviour of changing the XBMC sound levels with executing a script. For Ubuntu, I created a directory with various scripts in my home directory (scripts).\nContents of the files:\nmute.py\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.call( \"amixer -D pulse set Master 1+ toggle\", shell=True )\n\nlower_volume.py\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.call( \"amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%-\", shell=True )\n\nraise_volume.py\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.call( \"amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%+\", shell=True )\n\nThen make the files executable with chmod +x Scripts/* . The minus and plus button on the numpad can still lower/raise the volume of XBMC, but those can also be disabled with changing the keyboard.xml.\n\nA: You can assign shortcuts in you keyboard to control the system volume.\nGo to System Settings -> Keyboard -> Sound and Media. There you can assign a key combination to increase or decrease the system volume.\n\n\nA: From http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=148210\n\n\n*\n\n*From within XBMC, install the XBMC Audio Mixer add-on.\n\n*Open the Audio Mixer.\n\n*Increase the Master volume to 100%. (Can't go beyond 100%, so if you want to boost the volume, you'll still need to do this before launching XBMC.)\n\n\n(Though it would be nice to be able to map the appropriate keys to adjust the Master volume.)\n\nA: You could switch the \"enable system keys in fullscreen\" option on. That stops XBMC from capturing certain keypresses, including the volume keys.\nSystem -> settings -> system -> input devices -> enable system keys in fullscreen\nSadly, as far as I can tell there is no way to choose which keys are passed through and which are not, but this may fit the bill for some users.\n\nA: In XMBC/Kodi:\n\n\n*\n\n*go to PROGRAMS \n\n*get more\n\n*install:  Keymap Editor\n\n*change keys for volume up and down (and mute)\n\n\n. I used keypad +, -, * (mute)\nworks\n\nA: Switch to a different TTY and use aslamixer, e.g. ctrl-alt-f1 into TTY1, login, run alsamixer, adjust levels, logout and the ctrl-alt-f7 to go back to your X session running XBMC.\n", "Q: Unable to see GUI Hey I have Installed UBUNTU 12.04 on vmware work station on Windows 7 but when I start  it up in vmware I get a message on black screen of ubuntu i.e.\n[ 7.3326] pixx4_smbus 0000:00:07.3: Host SMBus controller not enabled!\n\nAfter that it asks for user id and password on black screen and after entering them I am still in a black screen, I am unable to see GUI. \nPlease suggest what to do. I am new to UBUNTU.\n\nA: The SMBus is for information such as motherboard temperature and there isn't any on a virtual machine (as far as I am aware), but Linux still starts the driver for it. I am fairly sure it isn't related to your GUI issue.\nSorry if this sounds Mickey Mouse, but did you install Ubuntu workstation or server? The server hasn't got a GUI by default. Workstations put the GUI in terminal 7. You can switch terminal screens by pressing CTRL+ALT+F7 (F1 to F7 selects the different screens). So when your VM starts, try pressing CTRL+ALT+F7 and see what's on the screen. If it's just another logon prompt, then the GUI isn't working or not installed. Log in and try typing startx to see if the GUI strats. If not, check the messages you get and let us know.\nIf you've installed server and want a GUI, there are quite a few to be had. Some are lightweight and some are extremely heavy. One of the lighter is xfce4.\n", "Q: Kill Java processes I'm working on a computationally heavy code that - for now - crashes a lot, but I'm still working on it :) When it crashes, I can't close the GUI window; I have to open a shell and kill -9 the process.\nIt is a Java process and it is easy to find:\nnkint@zefiro:~$ ps aux | grep java\nnkint   2705 16.6  1.0 460928 43680 ?

So normally i wait for about 7-8 processes to crash, and then kill -9 each of them.\nI want to do this in an automatic way. I think that it should be easy to pipe some commands to take the id of the (n-1) results of ps aux | grep java and kill it but I don't have any idea where to start.\nCan anyone give me any hints?\n\nA: If you want to kill all processes that are named java you can use following command:\n\nkillall -9 java\n\nThis command sends signals to processes identified by their name.\n\nA: Open a text editor and save this short bash script in your home directory as 'killjava'\n#! /bin/bash\n\n# Kill Java process\n\n# Determine the pid\nPID=`ps -C java -o pid=`\n\nkill -9 $PID\n\nThen chmod u+x ~/killjava in a terminal so you can execute the file.\nThen you can just call ~/killjava from a terminal and your Java process will be stone dead. You may wish to consider what other resources your killing of the Java process in this way (such as database connections) will be affected. For example, perhaps kill -15 would be more appropriate - see the explanation here.\n\nA: Here is an alternative approach, based on @Dean's earlier answer.\n\nThis uses jps to identify the java process.\nkill $(jps | grep <MainClass> | awk '{print $1}')\n\nMainClass is a class in your running java program which contains the main method.\n\nA: A few more pipes will get you where you want to be. Here's how I'd do it:\nsearch_terms='whatever will help find the specific process' \n\nkill $(ps aux | grep \"$search_terms\" | grep -v 'grep' | awk '{print $2}')\n\nHere's what's happening:\ngrep -v 'grep' excludes the grep process from the the results.\nawk '{print $2}' prints only the 2nd column of the output (in this case the PID)\n$(...) is command substitution. Basically the result from the inner command will be used as an argument to kill\nThis has the benefit of finer control over what is killed. For example, if you're on a shared system you can edit the search terms so that it only attempts to kill your own java processes.\n\nA: I created this as my Modded minecraft server crashes sometimes and java sticks and wont close got fed up and scripted a sh script that will detect if java is running and attempt to kill them all here is the code if anyone wants it\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"-----------------------------------\"\necho \"Checking to see if \\e[96mJava\\e[0m is \\e[32mrunning!\\e[0m\" \necho \"-----------------------------------\"\nsleep 3\nif pgrep -x \"java\" > /dev/null\nthen\n    echo \"-----------------------------------\"\n    echo \"\\e[96mJava\\e[0m is \\e[32mrunning:\\e[0m Attempting To Kill\"\n    echo \"-----------------------------------\"\n    sleep 2\n    killall SGKILL java\nelse\n    echo \"------------------------------------\"\n    echo \"\\e[96mJava\\e[0m Detection \\e[91mFailed:\\e[0m Ending Script\"\n    echo \"------------------------------------\"\n    sleep 1\n    exit\nfi\nsleep 1\nif pgrep -x \"java\" > /dev/null\nthen\n    echo \"-----------------------------------------\"\n    echo \"Could not kill \\e[96mJava\\e[0m, Are you a \\e[31mSudo User?\\e[0m\"\n    echo \"-----------------------------------------\"\n    sleep 2\nelse\n    echo \"------------------------------\"\n    echo \"\\e[96mJava\\e[0m was killed \\e[32mSuccsessfully!\\e[0m\"\n    echo \"------------------------------\"\n    exit\nfi\n\n\n#Created By Nocturnal_Toker \n\n", "Q: What are the different Unity Web-apps that are available?

This is not a question about setting up media keys, as mine have all been recognised and have their correct keysyms assigned, and I can use rhythmbox with them and other applications.\nI was thinking that there must be a way to use the special XF86Audio keys (such as play, stop, next, and previous track buttons) with decibel, as most media player applications 'grab' the keys when you start the application. Some need setting up manually, but there doesn't seem to be any guides for decibel-audio-player. \nIs it possible to use the appropriate laptop media keys with this player?\n\nA: As long as your multimedia keys have been recognised and have their appropriate keysym assigned, the following explanation will work fine. If not, please see the Ubuntu wiki and my answer for this question.\nYour 'XF86Audio' media keys (i.e. play, pause, next track, previous track buttons) usually do not work straightaway with decibel-audio-player, so you need to use the remote application, which is by default located at /usr/share/decibel-audio-player/src/remote.py. To find the valid options, just run it with python:\npython /usr/share/decibel-audio-player/src/remote.py\n\nHere is the full list of options available for the command-line application, remote.py:\nCommand  | Arguments        | Description\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nnext     |                  | Jump to the next track\npause    |                  | Pause or continue playing the current track\npl-add   | file1 file2...   | Append the given files to the playlist\npl-clr   |                  | Clear the playlist\npl-set   | file1 file2...   | Set the playlist to the given files\nplay     |                  | Start playing the current track\nprev     |                  | Jump to the previous track\nshuffle  |                  | Shuffle the playlist\nstop     |                  | Stop playback\nvolume   | value (0 -- 100) | Set the volume\n\nSo, from the command-line, the python command that pause/plays a track when decibel-audio-player is already running is:\npython /usr/share/decibel-audio-player/src/remote.py pause\n\nOther commands that can be assigned to media buttons (individually) are, for example:\npython /usr/share/decibel-audio-player/src/remote.py stop\npython /usr/share/decibel-audio-player/src/remote.py next\npython /usr/share/decibel-audio-player/src/remote.py prev\n\nNow all you need to do is to assign the appropriate python command to the XF86 keysym that represents, for example, your play/pause on your laptop. Do this by going to shortcut settings, adding a new keyboard shortcut, then placing in the box the appropriate line above and then pressing the appropriate media key. \n\nRepeat this method for however many media keys you have by using a different command and different media key every time.\nWhen you have finished, your keyboard shortcuts application will look something like this, although I am using Xfce, so the settings section will look different for other desktop environments:\n\nI thought this information was worth sharing, as I haven't been able to find any similar tutorials elsewhere, so perhaps it will be useful for someone.\n", "Q: Removing duplicate entries in boot menu (WUBI) I tried a Wubi install, but it got stuck, so I restarted the system, uninstalled it from Windows and did the whole process again.

My plan was to partition the 1TB in half and let one side be Ubuntu and the other OS X (until I can reasonable get rid of OS X. I need it for work).\nRight now I have Ubuntu 12.10 installed on the 1TB and it's fine, but it's taking up all of the drive. It automatically set the partition that way. I made sure to check the LVM box. Easy to resize, they said. Right. Here's what I've got right now, as seen from booting up on a live CD or USB:\n\nThe partition is locked. It's not mounted though. Yet for the life of me I can't figure out how to resize it. It makes me wonder why I bothered with the LVM in the first place instead of just installing on FAT32. In fact the real reason it's this way is that I just let it do the auto install, and was never given an option for other partition setups. I did this because I wanted to make sure the EFI partition was set up right. I've had problems with that on past computers.\nI have a few questions, but only a few need to be answered to solve this for me. I'm less concerned with the intellectual pursuit at this point than I am in just getting it working.\nWhy can't I resize this? Why is it locked? More importantly, how do I fix this? Google returns answers that don't work for one reason or another.\nShould I go back and reinstall but do it all manually and set it up as 2 partitions? If so, do I need to create a EFI and swap partition in the process, or is EFI taken care of automatically?\nI'm coming back to linux after years away, so I'm quite rusty. Any help will be greatly appreciated.\nedit: the following is from the terminal\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo e2fsck -f /dev/sda3\ne2fsck 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)\n/dev/sda3 is in use.\ne2fsck: Cannot continue, aborting.\n\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ umount /dev/sda3\numount: /dev/sda3 is not mounted (according to mtab)\n\nSo it's in use but yet it's not mounted?\n\nA: If you have lvm, you need to use lvm tools to manage the Logical Volumes and Volume Groups. Your /dev/sda3 is not mounted but is probably defined as a Physical Volume in your VG. This is why it is in use.\nTry using sudo pvs command to see your physical volumes, sudo vgs for volume groups and lvs for logical volumes. (pvdisplay, vgdisplay and lvdisplay also give other details about the volumes).\nFrom the LV list, you need to select the LV you want to resize and resize it using the LV name not the /dev/sda3 physical partition.\nObs: as this is probably the LV with the / filesystem, you will need to resize it booting from a live cd (it's the same as without lvm, you can't unmount the volumes in use).\nOBS: from your screenshot, you are using gparted and gparted is not able to work with LVM partitions at least until 12.04 (edit: but on your screenshot of 12.10 it appears to be working...). You need to use fdisk (seems that parted works too but I never used it...)\n\nA: You don't mount a physical LVM volume. Ever. Running fsck (meant to scan Extended Filesystem) on an LVM PV? Installing Linux on FAT32? \nI don't think it's as much about the intellectual pursuit as about the need to understand the basics instead of trying things willy-nilly. In order for this not to be a rant about yet another user unwilling to learn and expecting things to magically work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink your filesystems on Logical Volumes (if the FS supports it)\n\n*Shrink your logical volumes with lvresize\n\n*Resize the underlying physical volume.\n\n*Resize the partition used as the physical volume.\n\n\nTo summarize - not worth it unless you know what you're doing and know how LVM bits and pieces fit together. Plan your installation more carefully in the future.\n", "Q: grub error, cannot boot win 7 after trying to install win 8 I tried installing win 8 and had to cancel the setup at a point.

I will format my laptop which has Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. Which poses lot of problems. \nParag Shah\n\nA: Well, I guess you should download the Ubuntu 12.04 iso, burn it to a CD, place it in your laptop and reboot it. Maybe you will need to have some fun in the BIOS (like setting up the boot order), but other than that, this should be all you should do it.\n\nA: You should go here to download Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 32-bit or 64-bit. (I recommend 64-bit)\nWhile running Windows XP, if you don't have any program to burn the image to a CD, i recommend cdburnerxp, which is a free and very good program to burn CD/DVD.\nThen you just have to put the CD into your laptop, and select the option to boot from CD, either from BIOS or pressing a shortcut while booting, F10 or F12, depends on the laptop manufactor.\nHope this helps you.\n\nA: If i were you I would rather make a bootable USB stick if i were you.

Generally, I want to clone the whole volume, not only some partition. So, I mount the SD card and see something like this in the Log viewer:\nkernel: [  262.025221]  sdc: sdc1 sdc2\n\nalex@u120432:~$ ls /dev/sdc*\n/dev/sdc  /dev/sdc1  /dev/sdc2\n\nSince I want to copy the whole disk, I execute:\ndd if=/dev/sdc of=sdimage.img bs=4M\n\nFile sdimage.img, 7.9 GB (7,944,011,776 bytes) is created (SD card is 8 GB). Now I mount another SD card and execute:\ndd if=sdimage.img of=/dev/sdc bs=4M\n\nThe problem is that the second dd command hangs on some stage, and never succeeds. After this, I cannot reboot or shut down computer, and I need just to switch power off.\nIs this the correct approach? Maybe there is another way to clone an SD card?\nOS: Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), 32 bit.\n\nA: Insert the original SD card and check the name of the device (usually mmcblkX or sdcX):\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nYou might see:\nDevice         Boot   Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type\n/dev/mmcblk0p1 *       2048  2099199  2097152    1G  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)\n/dev/mmcblk0p2      2099200 31116287 29017088 13.9G 83 Linux\n\nIn my case the SD card is /dev/mmcblk0 (the *p1 and *p2 are the partitions).\nNow you have to unmount the device:\nsudo umount /dev/mmcblk0\n\nNow to create an image of the device:\nsudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=~/sd-card-copy.img bs=1M status=progress\n\nThis will take a while.\nOnce it's finished, insert the empty SD card. If the device is different (USB or other type of SD card reader) verify its name and be sure to unmount it:\nsudo fdisk -l\nsudo umount /dev/mmcblk0\n\nWrite the image to the device:\nsudo dd if=~/sd-card-copy.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M status=progress\n\nThe write operation is much slower than before.\n\nA: You should not be using dd on mounted devices. unmount all the partitions first, then your command should work.\n\nA: I am using dd tool to clone usb sticks with multiple partitions, here is my command:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sdc bs=4096 conv=notrunc,noerror\n\nnotrunc - do not truncate the output file \nnoerror - continue after read errors \n\nA: dd is fine, but I prefer cat /dev/sdc/ > ~/backup.iso\nIf you want to put it on an SD card again, just run cat ~/backup.iso > /dev/sdc\n\nA: Here are the steps which worked for me on Ubuntu to restore the image file (~/raspberrypi2.img in my case) back to a new SD card (inspired heavily by Alon's reply above):\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the micro SD card via the card reader. \n\n*Open the Disks app.\n\n*Quick format the whole card (not a specific partition). \n\n*Close Disks. \n\n*Open terminal and execute:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nRelevant output (which showed there were no partitions due to the quick format of the whole card): \nDisk /dev/sdb: 7.4 GiB, 7948206080 bytes, 15523840 sectors \nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes \nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes \nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes \nDisklabel type: dos \nDisk identifier: 0x6957f2f2\n\n\nsudo dd if=~/raspberrypi2.img of=/dev/sdb\n\nThis step takes a few good minutes (even on USB3).

I tried to use xrandr, but not sure what are correct values to enter or whether it's the right way to go.\nEdit\nAfter running  cvt 1366 768 60 I got the following:\n\n# 1368x768 59.88 Hz (CVT) hsync: 47.79 kHz; pclk: 85.25 MHz\nModeline \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync\n\nThen running xrandr I have\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 1280 x 720, maximum 8192 x 8192\nDVI-I-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nVGA-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDVI-I-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI-0 connected 1280x720+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 160mm x 90mm\n   1280x720       60.0*+   59.9  \n   1920x1080      30.0     30.0  \n   720x480        59.9  \n   640x480        59.9  \n  1368x768_60.00 (0x2aa)   85.2MHz\n        h: width  1368 start 1440 end 1576 total 1784 skew    0 clock   47.8KHz\n        v: height  768 start  771 end  781 total  798           clock   59.9Hz\n\n\nHowever, when running xrandr --addmode HDMI-0 1368x768_60.00, I get:\n\nX Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  140 (RANDR)\n  Minor opcode of failed request:  18 (RRAddOutputMode)\n  Serial number of failed request:  29\n  Current serial number in output stream:  30\n\n\nA: See here for the wiki.ubuntu.com entry on xrandr and how to use it.

I just changed that cable and it worked after that. I hope that I can help someone out there with that answer. Just for the record: I didn't change the output.\nJust so you know: try another cable. ;)\n\nA: Try to run,\nxrandr --addmode HDMI-0 1368x768\nif it does not works of fails after sometime\nthen,\nMost Common Problem should be with Graphics Drivers\nOR\nYour VGA Cable Can be affected\nOR\nYour Monitor PCB Can Have Problem.\nOR\nYour Motherboard Graphics Card/Graphics Controller Can Have Problem.\n", "Q: uwsgi can't find python plugin I'm trying to deploy a python app to my Ubuntu 12.04.1 VPS running Nginx / uWSGI.

I have always found this difficult as I am never sure which disk to select. In my case I see one with \"Windows bootloader\". I was guessing that was the boot disk for my system but having selected it and completing the Ubuntu installation, GRUB did not appear and Windows loaded. I had no way to get to my Ubuntu installation.\nI then tried another disk for GRUB after receiving the same message on a re-install of Ubuntu but it didn't work either. In stead of fumbling about I thought I would ask here.\nThanks for any advice!\n\nA: If you are unsure about partitions I wouldn't even install it. My recommendation is to install it inside windows like a program, this way you don't risk overwriting your partitions. I found this link http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\n\nA: Maybe you could use this guide http://www.ehow.com/how_5133222_see-hard-drive-partitions.html to sort out on wich partition windows is stored. Another way is to use an ubuntu live cd and test (instead of installing it) Ubuntu. With Ubuntu, use GParted to check and manage your partitions.

I get a driver issue that tells me to SU /etc/init.d/vboxdrv update. But that gives a command doesn't exist. \nThanks in advance! \n\nA: The windows 7 installer does not install to EFI/GPT as default.\nYou need to put your Win7 installer disk's files onto a FAT32 formatted USB thumbdrive and copy an EFI bootloader into a specific location in order to get it to boot into the EFI-mode installer.\nFollow this link:\nhttp://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/show/1840-installing-windows-from-usb-stick-to-a-gpt-drive\nAlso; this might help:\nHow do I create a multiboot environment using LVM for your *buntu operating systems on a GPT formatted system drive, in a UEFI based system?\n\nA: I'm not sure if Windows 7 supports GPT without EFI.

Choose the GTK 2 version from the Sourceforge link and install the deb file with gdebi or software center. There is also a 'portable' version that you can download, extract and then run the executable without installing it.  \nIts handling of .7z files is good, and it has support for password protected files, which is exactly what you want, and several other useful tools, such as one to check the integrity of archives and even one to benchmark the time taken to compress/decompress files.\nIt has support for extracting many files at once, as you see in the first screenshot; in the second screenshot you can see the simple, file-manager like GUI, which makes it simple to select the archives to be extracted.\n\n\n", "Q: Ruby: Problem with Different Versions I posted this question before but I had 11.04 which is not supprted.

There are quite a few UI applications that use ruby. However 1.9 is the new way to go, so you more then likely would want to use it on new projects (be they rails or pure ruby). \nIf your developing an application Ruby Version Manager should meet your needs. You can download and install it from this site. BUT if your trying to use 1.9 that was packaged for/with Ubuntu, RVM WILL NOT WORK \nRVM only loads in your environment. Usually only in your command line environment (though this doesn't have to be true). It compiles ruby from source and does not use packaged versions. Again this is the accepted way to use ruby for development, not as a user or consumer, or in production.\nIf an app you want to run requires ruby, you should be able to give it a ruby path. If the app in question is built for Ubuntu then installing that app should be all you need. \nIf your working with rails\nDo not use the system ruby or the packaged rails gems. They are totally and completely wrong for development. Instead use RVM + bundler + gemsets to manage your setup. On production boxes you would normally use just bundler.\nIf your working with ruby\nDo not use the system ruby or packaged gems. rvm + gemsets are the accepted way to build new projects. In production this gets more complicated depending on targets.\nIf your deploying Ruby Apps\nThen you need to make sure you run your test suite on the individual system versions that you are aware of. In ruby patch level is important and you need to make sure you code works, or is deployed with, a working ruby. \nShameless plug\nInstructions for compiling a working ruby from source can be found on my website. Note that it's for production servers, and intended to be used in rails environments. But it should get you started if you decide to compile. \nTL;DR;\n\n\n*\n\n*RVM + gemsets = developing ruby applications  \n\n*RVM + bundler + gemsets = developing rails applications  \n\n*bundler (and a complied specific version of ruby) = production rails applications  \n\n*system ruby + lots of testing = production ruby applications\n\n", "Q: I cant upgrade the Ubuntu distro version from terminal When I enter sudo apt-get upgrade command in terminal, it finds some files to upgrade but not the Ubuntu new release.

You can download the iso of ubuntu 12.10 from here: \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download \nOr 12.04.1 LTS, you might prefer 12.04.1 because it's an LTS which means is's supported for five years instead of one and a half years for a normal release:\nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/ . \nBurn the iso on a dvd, boot from it and install. \nIf you're going to dual boot with windows don't follow my instructions because you'll erase windows too.

Recently I was able to increase the left margin between code and line numbers in Gedit (Gnome-text-editor) in Ubuntu 12.10.\nI don't recall how I achieved this, neither do I recall how Gedit reverted to the classical margin which is very tight for me. See screenshot:\n\nDoes anyone know how I can increase left margin in Gedit 3.6.1?\nThanks\n\nA: The request for more space between line numbers and content has sometimes been voiced on the mailing-lists before, and here is a summary of my investigation of the current situation.\n\nWe can find any additional gedit settings by entering in terminal\ngsettings list-recursively | grep -i gedit\n\nand then we can narrow it down a bit further by entering\ngsettings list-recursively | grep -i gedit | grep -i margin\n\nwhich returns the margin entries and your current settings:\norg.gnome.gedit.preferences.editor display-right-margin true\norg.gnome.gedit.preferences.editor right-margin-position uint32 2\n\nBut these are right margin settings, and are just the same as the gui settings menu; there also doesn't seem to be any appropriate possibilities in the rest of the settings or any plugins that would be useful for you.\nIt is important to note that gedit uses gtksourceview, and, when examined, the feature set from that library will be familiar to gedit users. There is, however, no mention in the specifications of the left margin or a way to specify a separation between line numbers and the entries in your gedit document. \nHowever, I think you could do what you want by patching the gtksourceview library,  and patching gedit. After looking at the gtksourceview specifications I think you would need to patch the gtksourcegutter settings; in the documentation it is noted that\n\nThe GtkSourceGutter object represents the left and right gutters of the text view. It is used by GtkSourceView to draw the line numbers and category marks that might be present on a line. By packing additional GtkSourceGutterRenderer objects in the gutter, you can extend the gutter with your own custom drawings. \n\nThere is a discussion on the gutter in the mailing-lists, although not with specific reference to your question, but with regard to possible customisations.\n\nYou may have thought you had enabled space between line numbers and entries in your document by carrying out the process shown in the screenshot below. \nYou create a new file with gedit, go to edit > preferences > view and enable the right margin and set it to 2, for example. Then you place the cursor on the margin, type something, press return, and then save the file. Then when the file is reloaded the space between the numbers and the content stays until you go beyond the margin.\nThis has happened to me a few times, and is confusing, but is not a reliable way of doing what you want. As there are no official settings available the only way to do what you want would be to patch gtksourceview and gedit.\n\n", "Q: Dual Boot Ubuntu and Windows 7: BOOTMGR is missing when I tried to boot in Windows So, I don't know what exactly how I managed to delete the MBR record on windows partition.

It doesn't apply any change \"live\". Also, fbset is not even useful. It looks like it's only going to display current settings.\n\nA: Running sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup changes the font size of all your consoles without rebooting.\n\nA: I saw suggestions to change font size, but it is not the same as changing actual resolution.\nI thought that there should be some file to which we can put our wanted resolution, like this:\necho 1920x900 > /some/file/current_resolution\n\nOr maybe some hack to programmable unplug and then replug video output again with suggested resolution (so it's like a reinitialization of kms).\nBut actutally I have discovered that fbset is a solution.

Now I would like to start from scratch with 12.04 but I'm having some trouble with the existing logical volumes and volume groups.  Erasing data during install looks like it's going to take days.  Is there a quick and simple way to wipe out all volumes/groups/partitions so I can start with 2 empty drives?  When I set this up on 11.04 it took me a while to learn how to do it and I've since forgotten most of what I learned.\nFor what it's worth, I'm only using this box to learn about Linux.\n\nA: I was unable to delete a partition because it was in use by a Volume Group (system).  I was told it was unable to delete that Volume Group because a Physical Volume was missing.\nOnce I ran vgreduce --removemissing system I was able to delete the Volume Group and then the partition leaving me right where I wanted to be.\nThanks for the suggested answers, they got me thinking on the right track. \n\nA: All you need to do is choose the \"use whole disk\" option in the installer.  It will wipe out whatever is on the drive.\n\nA: Just for the sake of this question, I just encountered the same problem and here's how I fixed it (all these commands were entered from a live session) :\nsudo vgdisplay\n\nthen I located the group name to delete\nsudo vgremove <groupname>\n\nsaid yes to all questions.\nThen, I could manually format the whole device thing with GParted.\n\nA: Booting from a LiveCD, starting GParted and creating a new partition table on each drive will effectively remove all existing partitions. The amount of data written will be negligible, so it should not take long.\nAll data on the drives will be lost.\n\nA: I experienced a similar situation.\nI found that I had to go through the installation process to the part where you select the mode of creating the partitions: Guided or Manual.\nThen I could use the Alt+F2 to switch to another console.  When I typed help, it did not show any of the LVM commands.  I used vgdisplay to see the name of VirtualGroup.\nI then specified vgreduce -v -f <inserted my VirtualGroup name from the vgdisplay> - where the v flag specifies verbose so I could see what LVM was doing, and the f flag to force, since the first few times it complained about not finding the missing drive.\nThen I switched back to the main console Alt+F1 and selected Guided using LVM.  The installer found the fixed LVM partition and deleted it, so that I could continue with the install.  \n", "Q: Session locked, Kubuntu 12.10 After leaving my laptop for a while, my Kubuntu session closed.  (I'm not sure which of the  various timeout criteria caused it.)  So I got a screen that said my session was locked and I needed to provide my password to unlock it.  That's a nuisance, not a big problem, but I'd like to fix it so timed-out sessions don't lock the session.\nI assume there's something in System Settings to disable the lockout -- but where?  I looked in Power Management and found a setting \"Lock screen on resume\", but it's unchecked.\nIs this possibly a bug?\n\nA: There should be an application called \"Brightness and Lock\" under it you'll find options that dictate how long your laptop can be left idle before turning off the screen and how long after the screen turns blank before a password is needed to unlock it with an option to require your password to wake from suspend.\n", "Q: Can't get Past Login Screen -Graphics Drivers 12.10 Newbie Linux user here.

Also, be aware that if you create an Ubuntu Live CD/USB, nothing you do while logged into that drive will be saved. You have to perform a full install.\nAs for doing that and making the Live boot drive in the first place, I asked the same question last night and have spent much of the time in between hunting down the answer. \nI've written up the answer here and hope it helps:\ncan't make bootable usb on mac\n", "Q: video/audio output via HDMI Ubuntu 12.04 I've been out of the Ubuntu loop for quite a while now and have a completely new laptop now.

The Ubuntu 12.04 application has never detected anything other than the HP monitor I am using at the moment. \nOnline, I found that one needs the NVIDIA X Server Settings application to work and NVIDIA GPU properly.

I come from a Windows background (DOS before that) and am loving it so far.  I installed it on an older Dell laptop that I wanted to get another year out of.  I set this machine up primarily as a LAMP development machine for a project I am working on.\nThe machine is a Vostro 1500 and it has 4GB RAM (maxed) and an upgraded hard drive.  I can't watch YouTube videos for long before it starts to overheat and start acting sporadic.  I can live without YouTube but every so often the application switching (alt-tab) gets slower and begins not showing all applications and the Dash home quits displaying properly.  I am sure I am asking a lot of this old machine.  What I really want to know is: are there any settings in Ubuntu that allow me to lower the graphic effects (fade-ins, transparencies, fancy transitions, etc) that would be less taxing on the video card?\n\nA: There apparently no settings in the standard Ubuntu Gnome GUI to disable or throttle graphics effects.  Instead you can install alternate GUIs.  Xubuntu was suggested and it is uses the Xfce GUI. \nIn Ubuntu (I have 12.10), go to the Software Center and search for \"xubuntu-desktop\" and install it.  \nNow when I log in, I can select what GUI I want to use. This uses significantly less resources and allows me to work longer without having to reboot.\n", "Q: ZFS partition as swap I'm using native-zfs and was wondering if there is a way to use a ZFS partition for SWAP. I'm running my server off of a thumbdrive and thought that would be a good way to speed it up a little bit.\n\nA: Using ZFS for swap should just work, just like it does under Solaris and FreeBSD.\nzfs create pool/swap -V 1G -b 4K\nmkswap -f /dev/pool/swap\nswapon /dev/pool/swap\n\n\nA: Swapping onto a ZFS zvol is possible, but is not a good idea, because of an open bug that can cause your machine to deadlock when low on space.\nSwap space is used when the machine is low on memory and trying to free some up by swapping out less-frequently used data.\nWhen ZFS processes writes to a zvol, it can need to allocate new memory inside the kernel to handle updates to various ZFS data structures. If the machine is low on space already, it might need to swap something out to make this space available, but this causes an infinite loop.\nSo, instead of swapping to ZFS, just allow a small additional partition for swap space. Or for many situations you can just not have swap, and rely on other data being paged out to the filesystem to free up memory.\n\nA: Here's a more elaborate guide, copied from the zfsonlinux wiki:\nStep 1: Create a volume dataset (zvol) for use as a swap device\nzfs create -V 4G -b $(getconf PAGESIZE) -o compression=zle \\\n      -o logbias=throughput -o sync=always \\\n      -o primarycache=metadata -o secondarycache=none \\\n      -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false rpool/swap\n\nYou can adjust the size (the 4G part) to your needs.\nThe compression algorithm is set to zle because it is the cheapest available algorithm. With ashift=12 (4 kiB blocks on disk), the common case of a 4 kiB page size means that no compression algorithm can reduce I/O. The exception is all-zero pages, which are dropped by ZFS; but some form of compression has to be enabled to get this behavior. If your pool uses ashift=9, you could use compression=lz4.\nStep 2: Format the swap device\nmkswap -f /dev/zvol/rpool/swap\n\nStep 3: Update /etc/fstab\necho /dev/zvol/rpool/swap none swap defaults 0 0 >> /etc/fstab\n\nWarning: Always use long /dev/zvol aliases in configuration files. Never use a short /dev/zdX device name.\nStep 4: Enable the swap device\nswapon -av\n\n", "Q: Installed geany has no options I'm new to geany IDE.

are two downloads available, Ubuntu 64bit (also known as amd64) and Ubuntu 32bit (also i386). If the output of uname -a contains x86_64 you have a 64bit install of Ubuntu and should use the 64bit package of Sublime Text.\nJust download the appropriate package and install it.\nNote: The amd64 designation is a bit confusing. If you have a 64bit Intel processor you still use the amd64 packages.\n\nA: In my case trying to run Sublime in a host without X-es gave me that error.\nInstalling following packages has solved the problem:\nsudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libfontconfig1 libxrender1 libx11-6 libglib2.0-0  libxft2 libfreetype6 libc6 zlib1g libpng12-0 libstdc++6-4.8-dbg-arm64-cross libgcc1 \n\n(I haven't checked if ALL of them are really needed)\n\nA: I had a similar error but I just had to issue sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0 and all the other dependencies were pulled automatically.\n\nA: It looks like sublime is not able to find these libraries\nlibpango-1.0.so libcairo.so libgdk-x11-2.0.so libpangocairo-1.0.so \n\ndo a locate \nlocate libpango-1.0.so libcairo.so libgdk-x11-2.0.so libpangocairo-1.0.so\n\nIf somehow these libraries are not present on your system, then install them again. If the error persists even after the install, then create a copy of the installed libraries and rename them to what sublime is expecting.\n\nA: Background and Short Answer\nIn my case, after opening a fresh shell instance, running subl works as expected. However, after making a number of modifications to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (and/or perhaps another library path environment variable), I suggest that you :\n\n\n*\n\n*clear said variables\n\n*verify that Sublime now runs\n\n*narrow down the offending package.\n\n\nMore Background and Long Answer\nI really actually noticed the issue when building a software project that features several external packages: on the first build everything was fine, but subsequent builds would fail when installing MPICH. Because I modify LD_LIBRARY_PATH on subsequent builds based on what packages are already installed, the compiler was picking up on a library installed via PETSc rather than the system copy.\nIf you find yourself in a similar situation, it just might be that LD_LIBRARY_PATH (and/or other environment variables) is initially empty and that you need to set it to certain system paths before modifying it. For example, put export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:/usr/lib\" in your shell profile configuration file.\n", "Q: Both firefox and chromium have problem with loading webpages I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and always up to date. My Internet speed is good. When I download something, it downloads with a good speed. But in case of browsing, not a single page load completely in both browser. There is always a moving wheel. Some websites take more than 5 minutes to load.(Google analytics) If there is a slider in the web-page, the slider doesn't load. On tab, the moving wheel is moving. \nPlease help.... \n\nA: You may want to check your internet connection starting either with your router and or broadband modem as both browsers are taking a long time to load. The alternative could be that it's something with your Ubuntu installatoin. You could try Google.com to see how fast that page loads for starters (it should load within seconds if that long even). In Ubuntu there is also a application called \"Network Tools\". When you open it, there should be a tab called \"Traceroute\". Enter \"google.com\" (without the quotations\") and trace it. The times shown are in milliseconds and are shown beside each waypoint your computer takes to find Google.com. Times over \"200\", I'd say, may show where you have a trouble spot. The first waypoint should be your computer with the next being either your router or modem and then your ISP and so on.\n", "Q: How do you set your Default Bittorrent Application? Additional details are:\nOS = 12.10\nPresent Default Torrent Application = qBittorrent\nPreferred Default Torrent Application = Vuze\nMy main area in of which I'm looking for advise is magnet links. Plus the program in question isn't 'installed' per say I have downloaded the tarball file for Vuze and I run the executable file from there to run it. \n\nA: I had the same problem and found a solution:\nIn escence you have to make sure your apps's .desktop file on:\n/usr/share/applications\n\nhas this line:\nMimeType=application/x-bittorrent;application/x-torrent;\n\nand then add/edit this line on /usr/share/applications/defaults.list:\nx-scheme-handler/magnet={$MYAPP}.desktop;\n\nsetting the correct app name of course.\nHope this can help.\n\nA: Let me explain this again in my own words\nFirstly we need to check that your program's \".desktop file\" (in /usr/share/applications) has this line:\nMimeType=application/x-bittorrent;application/x-torrent;\n\nTo check, open the text editor (called gedit) and hit \"open\" up to the left, then navigate to your program's .desktop file. As stated; you should find it in the folder /usr/share/applications. After you open it, search for \"MimeType\" (by pressing Ctrl+f and typing \"MimeType\" in the box that shows up).\n...If you did find that it has this line then proceed. (if not then just paste the line wherever in between the lines. Or if you find the line incomplete then you can modify the existing line.) Close gedit.\n\nNow that we've done the checking; open the file /usr/share/applications/defaults.list (the same way you opened the .desktop file). Search for \"x-scheme-handler/magnet\" (same way also). If you found it, make it look like this;\nx-scheme-handler/magnet=YOURPROGRAM.desktop;\n\nReplace YOURPROGRAM by the program you want to set default. The name must exactly match the name of your program's .desktop file.\nexample: x-scheme-handler/magnet=kde4-ktorrent.desktop;\nAnd you're done!\nThanks to Adrian Matteo for the source.\n\nA: Right click on the .torrent file > Properties > Open With (select Vuze), \"set as default\" and you're done.\nYou can always uninstall qbittorrent as well.\n\nA: Within Ubuntu 18.xx, if you want to set e.g. Transmission to open magnet links by default, you can go with this within terminal:\ngio mime x-scheme-handler/magnet transmission-gtk.desktop\n\nNext time you'll be opening magnet links in any browser, set the browser to remember the action for xdg-open and transmission will open automatically.\n\nA: Add the following line to ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\nx-scheme-handler/magnet=vuze.desktop\n\nOr \nIf you are using Firefox go to Edit > Preferences > Applications change default application for magnet to vuze.\n", "Q: Change Ipad setting back from do nothing in nautilus It use to open file explorer (nautilus) when I plugged it in.

I went to settings>detail, but I didn't see it in removable devices. Any help would be great. I'm on 12.10 Ubuntu.\nThanks\n\nA: You didn't see it listed in settings>detail?  Under any of the options?  If not I don't know either.  That is the only place I know to look.\n", "Q: Why does my terminal attempt to execute 'sudo apt-get update' at every launch? Every time I launch a terminal it attempts to execute sudo apt-get update \nThis happens regardless of which terminal emulator is used - both guake and gnome-terminal do it at least. \nIt also does the behavior upon creating new tabs within either terminal application or when logging into different ttys.  Any time a new bash is started it seems. \nAdditionally, the command inexplicably fails (command not found) - though it executes perfectly if I type it in manually.\nHow can I make this strange terminal quirk desist? \n\n\nA: The error message\nsudo apt-get update: command not found\n\nmeans that something is trying to execute a command called \"sudo apt-get update\", not the command sudo with arguments apt-get and update.\nThere must be such a command in one of the several scripts that are invoked when bash starts. It could be any of:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/profile\n\n*~/.bash_profile\n\n*~/.bash_login\n\n*~/.profile\n\n*~/.bashrc\nor something invoked by any of them. Try grepping for apt-get in those files. If that fails, look at other scripts and commands they invoke.\nFor example, I just reproduced the error message by (temporarily) adding this line:\n\"sudo apt-get full-upgrade\"\n\n(including the quotes) to my ~/.bashrc.\nYou can also try running bash -lx from the prompt; -l makes it a login shell, and -x causes it to trace commands. To save the output in a file:\nbash -lx < /dev/null > bash-lx.log 2>&1\n\n\nA: As everyone is saying, most likely is your .profile. But it also says that command is not found because the path to the binary is not specified (in case you want to actually run this command).\n", "Q: Display problem when adjusting brightness in ubuntu 12.04 Recently I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Dell 1554 laptop.\nI was adjusting my screen brightness when this happened :\n\nthis has become a recurring problem which is really annoying.\nI also want to tell you that :\n\n*\n\n*I have installed the graphics drivers ATI/AMD FGLRX graphics driver.\n\n*I have got my graphics driver checked by Dell.\nCan anybody tell me a solution to this and moreover is anybody out there who is having the same problem?\nThanks in advance.\nH/W and S/w details:\n\nDell Studio 1554 Processor : Intel® Core™ i5 CPU M 430 @ 2.27GHz × 4\nMemory : 4 GB VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro\nDevices [AMD] nee ATI Manhattan [Mobility Radeon HD 5400 Series]\nOS : Ubuntu Release 12.04 (precise) 64-bit\nKernel: Linux 3.2.0-34-generic\n\n\nA: I'm not sure how you're adjusting the brightness, but using xrandr, may yield different results.\nAs in xrandr --output VGA-0 --brightness 1.1 or 0.8 for darker, etc (see xrandr's output for your output name, maybe HDMI-0 or so)\n[Q showed up in \"Unanswered Questions\", may help someone with a different brightness option.

Does Linux (Ubuntu in particular) support Intel DVMT?\nI've Intel i5-2500K, 8GB RAM with NO graphics card. It has inbuilt 32MB dedicated graphics memory.\nIn my Windows OS, graphics memory is dynamically allocated from RAM (which goes up-to 1.7GB) and most of the games works fairly well at low FPS. As Ubuntu is in a way to become a gaming platform, I would like to know weather Intel DVMT is supported.\n\nA: I do not know about actual support, but if the question is whether memory is allocated to the graphics, then at least on my laptop with Intel i3 processor and HD4000 graphics that does happen.\nOn Ubuntu 12.10 and 1.8 GiB of my total RAM is always reserved for the graphics (unfortunately leaving only 2.1 GiB of memory to use). I have not seen any sign of it changing dynamically, ever.\nThe behaviour on Ubuntu seems to match the behaviour on Windows 7 (on Windows 7, the Resource Monitor reports 1853 MB of being \"Hardware Reserved\").\nMy laptop BIOS does not have settings related to this, so I have no control over this. Personally I would like to allocate less memory to the graphics, since currently it only leaves 2.1 GiB to use.\n", "Q: Mounted Devices History Does Ubuntu keep the history of the devices that were mounted (i.e. USB devices, external drives etc...). If this is the case where can I find it? \n\nA: Insertion of a USB storage device will generate a message in /var/log/dmesg, as will subsequently removing it. However, this doesn't tell you much (eg, nothing about whether any files were transferred).\n", "Q: local wordpress installation, plugin installation and file permissions I have a local wordpress installation and got everything working, until I tried to install a new plugin. Trying to activate the plugin, wordpress asked me for FTP connection information, which I understood to be a failure of write-access to the plugins directory. Apache runs as www-data, so I ran sudo chown -R www-data: /var/www/wordpress to make the wordpress directory writable for Apache. But now, I cannot edit the files as user anymore. Changing file permissions back to chown -R user: /var/www/wordpress/wp-content/themes, the wordpress dashboard complains again, that it doesn't have sufficient access.\nI tried various \"solutions\" online, but none have worked so far. Do I really need to install something like proftp and create an FTP user & password for my local server? Or can I circumvent the problem with some nifty file permission settings, which allow both me and Apache to access/write the files?\n\nA: It sounds like you've already got it figured out, but I'll let you know how I did it. This set up lets me and apache write to the wordpress directory, and the plugin/theme/upgrade works fine from within Wordpress.\nFirst, I made my user part of the www-data group: sudo usermod -G www-data -a <user>.\nNext, I made the entire wordpress directory owned by www-data:www-data: sudo chown -R www-data:www-data wordpress. I also made all the files readable and writable by user and group: find wordpress -type f -exec chmod 664 {} +, find wordpress -type d -exec chmod 775 {} +.\nFinally, I set the guid bit so that new files would also be group-owned by www-data: chmod -R g+s wordpress.\nNow, this isn't the most secure setup. Any vulnerabilities in Wordpress could be used to write to files within your wordpress installation. But I, personally, have never had any problems. And when I tried to make it less restrictive, updates and theme/plugin installation from within Wordpress Admin usually broke. I never quite found the right sweet spot between security and usability.\n", "Q: How to recover password without restart So I recently installed Ubuntu on this computer, I just started using it today for the 2nd time, I needed to install some video plugins to use for the web and it asked me for a password. \nI do not remember ever setting a password during installation, and I am not asked for a password to login either. As far as I knew I never had a password before, is there a way to recover the user password from within ubuntu without entering into recovery mode? \nI do not see why I need to restart as I never need a password to start up the computer and log in...\n\nA: When it asks for a password just press enter.\nThis happens because the system has been coded to function without a password being expected even if the password is blank.\n\nA: If you didn't set a password and it is prompting for one to install software then just hit ok / enter and leave the password field blank.  Otherwise you did set a password for your user id.  If this is the case then you have to reset it\nI found this to help you.\nHow do I reset a lost administrative password?\n\nA: Usually the password is hashed with a salt, making very difficult to brute force it. In such case I'd reset it instead of trying to \"decrypt\" it.\nAnother thing to notice is that root does not have password, but instead, your username has sudo privileges, meaning that you can become root by executing \"sudo su\" command from terminal.\n", "Q: Problem with apt-get update on ubuntu server I have ubuntu 32 bit 12.04 server edition but i am having issues with apt-get updating.\nThe server is able to ping the outside world (both 8.8.8.8 and www.google.com) but when I attempt to sudo apt-get update the first bit works but then I get this:\n\nIf i attempt to check or autoclean with:\nsudo apt-get check\n\nI get this:\n\nI have tried the fix detailed here:\nHow do I fix a \"Problem with MergeList\" or \"status file could not be parsed\" error when trying to do an update?\nBut it does not work, the same thing occurs again.

Then in a terminal run \"sudo apt-get update\".\n\nA: So the answer is:\nWatch out for university networks.

I followed the installation (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee#Installation) and after the reboot the resolution was still crappy, but this time the desktop did show up, but with bad graphics and I couldn't use optirun and it turned out that bumblebee couldn't start.\nI hope someone might know whats wrong or what I'm doing wrong. \nI have a Lenovo W520 with a nvidia Quadro FX 880M and I'm running ubuntu 12.10\n\nA: I also had this problem but after many days of trial and error this was the only solution that worked for me: \nGo to a TTY (Control+Alt+F1) \n\n\n*\n\n*Log in \n\n*sudo stop gdm to kill X \n\n*sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-256.44.run (but replace this with the actual file) \n\n*Assuming that goes well, it should build, install and load the kernel driver so just sudo start gdm to get back into X \n\n\nNote: Ubuntu's driver will automatically rebuild the nvidia kernel module when it updates its kernel (security updates, etc). Unless you want to get involved in some serious scripting trickery, the manually installed one wont. So after kernel updates you'll likely be dumped at a low-resolution screen with a prompt on what to do next. Click exit to prompt (or the one that sounds like that) and do what you did starting from point 2.\nNote on that Note: I recommend you never use the low graphics mode as it can disturb your desktop settings. Just get out of X, reinstall the driver and get back into X with full hardware capabilities.\nSource: Good NVidia drivers for a GeForce GT 330M on a VAIO laptop?\n\nA: Bumblebee is designed for computers with Optimus graphics.

There are several ways of resetting your firefox data.\n1) Try going to help > troubleshooting and you will see this screen (do not go to about:support without going through the menu or the reset option won't be available):\n\nJust click the reset option and firefox will be returned to its initial state.

Your computer sends the vpn concentrator a packet of data that is 1500 bits, but the vpn tunnel it's self adds overhead (about 37 bits if memory serves) which makes the total size 1537 which can't make it through the router. This is a malformed packet and the router drops it. \nThe reason windows machines connect is because it ignores the concentrator's \"suggestion\" to set the packet size to 1500 and just uses what ever it wants. \nTesting:\nTo make sure this is the problem, try sending a large file (about 1 meg) across the vpn without ssh. This will isolate any ssh issues from lower layer issues. If you get the same disconnect, it's probably the MTU issue.\nThe fix: \nThe proper fix is to have the network admin fix the vpn concentrator, setting a lower MTU then the router. Or perhaps fix the router...\nFrom your side you can adjust the vpn MTU size down to say 1400 and everything will just work. There are several ways to do this but this page should give you a head start.\n", "Q: No internet (wireless nor wired) on HP 6735b after upgrade to 12.10 So I've got a HP 6735b laptop. \nWhen I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on it, I didn't have any wireless.

My clients on the LAN are within the address range of 10.10.10.1 - 10.10.10.255.\nAny help would be appreciated.\nRegards\n\nA: I would suggest that you set up your squid proxy machine to have multiple IP addresses on the WAN facing side - one corresponding to each of your 5 client machines on the LAN (say 192.168.0.3, 192.168.0.4, 192.168.0.5, 192.168.0.6 and 192.168.0.7).\nYou then set up a squid ACL and tcp_outgoing_address rule as described here to map your internal client LAN addreses to one of the WAN facing IP addresses on squid, e.g. 10.10.10.1 maps to 192.168.0.3, 10.10.10.2 maps 192.168.0.4 etc).\nFinally you set up your router to NAT your first external IP to 192.168.0.3, your second one to 192.168.0.4, and so on.\n", "Q: PHP 5.4 interactive mode on Ubuntu 12.04 I'm a big fan of PHP interactive mode (php -a).

If you are looking for the command to start a shell, use\nsudo -i\n\nor\nsudo su\n\nThese will have you type the password of your user, and the user needs to be in the sudoers file.\nIf you don't want the user to be added to that file, you could just use the command\nsu\n\nwhich will have you type in the root (administrator) account.\nAnd finally, if there is an account called administrator, you could do \nsu administrator\n\nto gain access to that.\n\nA: If you meant that when logged in as user you want to execute a command as administrator then you need to do:\nuser@localhost:~$ sudo -u administrator vim\n\nHowever, the user's password will be asked not the one from adminitrator. To do so you need to run as administrator (hmm) the following command to configure sudo:\nvisudo\n\nThen scroll down in the opened file and look for other Defaults definition. In this section, preferrably at the end of it, add a new line with:\nDefaults targetpw\n\nAnd save the file and exit.

Keeping older, stable versions is part of the release schedule of Ubuntu. This makes sure developers can 'freeze' the shared libraries and use them efficiently. Security and severe bugs will be backported to the versions as released with the OS release.\n\nA: In order to get a more recent (untested against Ubuntu) version, you can download the latest tarball from the source at http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gawk.git/tag/?id=gawk-4.0.1 and run the commands:\n./configure \nmake \nsudo make install\n\nI would also recommend reading the Ubuntu CompilingEasyHowTo prior to installing just to make sure you have the necessary tools on your system already.\n", "Q: What does sudo service do? As far as I know and it seems that other people have the same opinion sudo is a command that executes something with administrative privileges.\nHowever when I run rcconf I can see this line:\n[*] sudo    Provide limited super user privileges to specific users\n\nSo what the point with this service? Or is this even a service?\n\nA: Short answer\nTo revoke the 'cached' authentication actions of users on reboot. It's not a daemon, just a script run at boot time.\n\nExtensive answer\nBy inspecting the init file /etc/init.d/sudo that 'starts the service', you can easily see what it's doing:\ncase \"$1\" in\n  start)\n        # make sure privileges don't persist across reboots\n        if [ -d /var/lib/sudo ]\n        then\n                find /var/lib/sudo -exec touch -t 198501010000 '{}' \\;\n        fi\n        ;;\n  stop|reload|restart|force-reload)\n        ;;\n  *)\n        echo \"Usage: $N {start|stop|restart|force-reload}\" >&2\n        exit 1\n        ;;\nesac\n\nSo, basically, it just touches some files in /var/lib/sudo on start of the system to have it a very old modification timestamp. As a result, the 'cached' granted authentication actions are revoked on the start of the service (which happens at boot).\nSome more detail on the /var/lib/sudo directory and those time stamps, please? Well, from the mapage of sudo(8):\n[...]\nOnce a user has been authenticated, a time stamp is updated and the\nuser may then use sudo without a password for a short period of time\n(15 minutes unless overridden in sudoers).\n[...]\nSince time stamp files live in the file system, they can outlive a\nuser's login session.  As a result, a user may be able to login, run a\ncommand with sudo after authenticating, logout, login again, and run\nsudo without authenticating so long as the time stamp file's\nmodification time is within 15 minutes (or whatever the timeout is set\nto in sudoers).\n[...]\n/var/lib/sudo           Directory containing time stamps\n\n\nA: The sudo service file exists to make sure that privileges called for don't stay after a reboot. Basically it guarantees that after rebooting, normal users that called for root permissions will stay as normal users.\n\nA detailed explanation about sudo\nAll of the explanation below is to get all the information for everyone that reads this question and to then explain what the sudo file in the service folder is doing there. \nWhen you install Ubuntu or any other distro that uses sudo the difference between being root and being a user that uses sudo for gaining \"root like\" privileges (Administrative or super user Privileges) is the following:\nAs root\n\n\n*\n\n*You are not asked for a password for each or all commands you run on a session\n\n*Not all commands you execute will be logged by default\n\n*The system assumes you know what you are doing (Reason why it does not ask for a password each time you execute a command)\n\n*There is no second chance or last minute option if you make a mistake\n\n\nAs sudo\n\n\n*\n\n*You are asked for a password for each or all commands you run on a session. For example if you open a terminal and execute a command that needs administrative privileges it will ask the password once for that session until you close the terminal or logout. This varies depending on what command you use and where. It might ask once or multiple times.\n\n*All commands you execute will be logged since you are actually asking for permission to use a super user privileged command.\n\n*The system assumes you e asking for permission temporarily and the administrative right will be lent temporarily (Until you logout, close terminal, etc..)\n\n*You have a last minute option to correct any mistake. This is done in the moment you get asked for the password.\n\n\nWhy was SUDO Created\nThe creation of SUDO was done because in the past, using root created more problems than solutions. Users had all rights, which meant that if they did some spring cleanup and literally deleted the /usr, /lib and /bin folders (because they thought they did not needed them).. guess what would happen. Many problems in the past were because users did not know the power they had when using root. Basically they had root but did not understand Linux, the file system hierarchy, what files were important, etc.. (Something like having a ferrari and not knowing how to drive... in a highway!)\nSUDO is also used by GUI apps (Like Update Manager) when they need temporary administrative privileges to do something. They only need it for a specific amount of commands (Typically 1) and then they go back to the user level privilege. This is to avoid having root privileges all the time and to avoid making a mistake if the user decides to remove some important part of the system.\nAdditionally it gives a better security because the root user comes disabled by default.\nLast, if you have a Desktop PC or Server, you really do not want everyone to be root, nor to have all admin privileges. Very bad idea if your little sister or little brothers starts to wonder what would happen if /boot met DEL key. This is where sudo comes in to decrease the chance something bad happens.\nWhat does Provide limited super user privileges to specific users mean?\nsudo user or sudoers actually have a configuration file that tells them how limited or opened the sudo command for a specific user is. The file /etc/sudoers has all information to limit or give access to a sudo user. By default it comes with access to everything, but you can configure or limit this as you wish.\nFor information on how to use the sudoers file type man sudoers in a terminal. For example the normal format is:\nUSER HOST = COMMANDS\nFor example cyrex server1 = /bin/ls will give the user cyrex in the host server1 access to run the ls command.\nFor example cyrex server1 (root) = /bin/ls will give the user cyrex in the host server1 access to run the ls command as root.\nFor example cyrex ALL = /bin/ls will give the user cyrex in all hosts access to run the ls command.\nFor example cyrex ALL = ALL will give the user cyrex in the all hosts access to run all commands.\nFor example luis   ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, /usr/bin/killall will allow me to run sudo for the kill and killall commands as root without asking for a password.\n\n", "Q: My update manager is not working \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I resolve unmet dependencies? \n\nAn error occurred, please run package manager from the right-click menu or apt-get in terminal to see what is wrong. \nThe error message was: \n'unknown error:'<type 'exceptions.system Error '>' ('E:The package tty-mscorefonts-installer needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.' this usually means that your installed packages have unmet dependencies\n\n\nA: Your system's dependencies are broken.

Windows is on sda1. Ubuntu is on sda6. I want to use unetbootin to install another Linux on sda5.\nMy question is: Why are sda5 and sda6 both included under the \"extended\" rubric?\nI probably did something I didn't understand when installing. \nIs this a problem, or can I just clear out sda5 and install as usual?\n\nA: It is absolutely okay that there is more than 1 partition in the extended section of hard drive. You should probably read something on disk partitioning to get the idea.\nThere are however things to consider. For example Windows can only install on a primary partition, but as you see Linux doesn't require that, so you should be okay.\n\nA: The MSDOS partition table only has 4 slots for partitions.  To overcome this limit, you can use one of them as an extended partition, which is then subdivided into one or more logical partitions, numbered starting at partition 5.  In other words, the whole point of an extended partition is to hold multiple partitions inside it.\n\nA: Try using a Ubuntu live cd. Had problems myself resizing partitions but with a live cd it worked.\n", "Q: How do I run a script at start up? I have a script in a folder:\n/path/to/my/script.sh\n\nI need this script to run every time the system starts (even if no one logs in to the system). What do I need to do in order to make this happen?\n\nA: You don't need root, or to even login.\nYou can edit your crontab (crontab -e) and create an entry like this:\n@reboot /path/to/script.sh\n\nThis way, you can run it as a regular user. @reboot just means it's run when the computer starts up (not necessarily just when it's rebooted).\nP.S.: Regarding comments that this does not work properly\nSome have said that this doesn't work on Debian-based distros, such as Ubuntu. I have personally successfully used this method on both Ubuntu and Mint. There are a few things to consider, however.\nThe @reboot jobs will run when the cron daemon starts. I've found that on Debian-based distros, this may occur before the /home partition has been mounted. If the script you're running is in your home folder, it will fail.\nAdditionally, this isn't limited to Debian-based distros, but if your home folder is encrypted, it may not be decrypted until after you login. There is probably no way around this.\nAlso, your network interface may not be up yet, and if the command requires Internet access, it may fail.\nFinally, again, this is not limited to Debian-based distros, but cron runs under a much more limited environment than your shell runs under. In particular, the PATH variable has much fewer paths. It is possible that the command being run isn't found, if it's in, for example, something like $HOME/.local/bin, which may be in your PATH in your shell session, but not under cron. It's even possible that the command being run depends on some environment variable that's not set in cron.\nSo, there are a number of reasons why your command will to run under cron, but it's not because @reboot doesn't work on your distro.\n\nA: You will need root privileges for any the following.

Basically, Flock browser would also qualify, and it had support for Linux: but it was discontinued. \n\nA \"Firefox clone\" is a term that I adopted from the use in Windows, the meaning of which includes these two elements:\n(1). is a browser that is identical (based on Mozilla Firefox) or very similar and has large/full support for FF extensions, configuration, profiles. = can use FF extensions etc.\n(2). runs independently from Firefox, can be opened at the same time with Firefox = does not share FF extensions etc.]\n(That is, a FF clone would be to Firefox what Google Chrome and SRWare Iron are to Chromium - almost identical, but able to run separately in parallel.) \n\n[Seamonkey, has support for Linux, but (although it can use a lot of FF extensions): themes are not working, the interface is in general different and rather primitive. It has the merit of keeping the pace with FF 4+ (in contrast with Swiftweasel, for example.)]\n\nAre there such more browsers available in Ubuntu?\n(As for comments asking why I \"really\" need these \"clones\", I am just used to doing that, I like two separate Firefox-like browsers: isn't pleasure, just like curiosity, a good reason for an action?)\n\nEdit after using multiple accounts: after testing for a while this solution that has prevailed here (was most up-voted) of using multiple accounts  I have to say that it may involve certain problems in cases where other separate customizations/advanced uses are implemented. (For example, using scripts to search internet for selected text may open new unwanted profiles instead of the default one; or using firefox \"openwith\" addon to try and open a link with a new ff profile would give a report that the profile is not accessible.) A complete separate browser for a parallel use may be in such cases more useful. (In this respect, Seamonkey deserves to be taken into account. )\n\nEdit considering the definitive answer: although answers proposing the use of multiple accounts were most voted, I will prefer an answer that proposes a separate browser, for two reasons: 1. that is what the question asks for in the first place, and 2. multiple accounts may involve some problems, like those mentioned above.\n\nA: Now, Pale Moon is available for Linux. More on this, here.\n\nIn addition to the previously mentioned Iceweasel, there's also IceCat, Swiftfox and Swiftweasel.\n(If you're feeling adventurous, there's also Conkeror, which is basically Firefox for people who hate using a mouse.)\nFlock was discontinued.\nFinally, if you want, literally another Firefox installation, you could just download the binary package and install it to another location.\n\nEdit for setting as the definitive answer:\nAs indicated, the intended browsers should satisfy two conditions: (1) support Firefox addons and plugins, and (2) run separately from Firefox, without interference.\nIcecat fully satisfies these demands. More details in this complementary answer.\nSwiftweasel also satisfies the demands, but in relation with an outdated version of Firefox.\nSeamonkey has a limited support for themes but the most important extensions are supported (more here.)\n\nFor details and updates keep an eye on this complementary answer.\n\nA: Pale Moon, mentioned in the question, is my favourite in Windows and it was in fact the main reference when asking for a similar application for Ubuntu: now, it is available for Linux. \nThe website:\n\nGeneral info on the project:\n\nAn article on Pale Moon, here.\nPale Moon in Linux fully supports Firefox themes and addons:\n\n\nWhat I was really asking in the question was browsers that satisfy the following two conditions:**\n1.  To be a 'double' of Firefox, that is to be identical, or very similar, so as to have all support  for Firefox extensions, plugins, themes.\n2.  To be able to run side-by-side with Firefox but without any interference (regarding profiles, extensions etc).\n\nIcecat (first mentioned in this answer)\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnuzilla-team/ppa && sudo apt-get update\n  && sudo apt-get install icecat -y\n\n\nFull support for all Firefox extensions, plugins and so on. Operates completely separate from Firefox.\n\nSwiftweasel kept the pace with Firefox only up to version 3.5.6 (here - just like Seamonkey, it runs 'portable').\n\nGmail is displayed in html version only. \n\nLast update - 2010.\nBut for the rest seems to run smoothly, a lot of main extensions ans themes are still supported and it also seems lighter than last Firefox: but this could be misleading, as it takes less RAM but sometimes more CPU resources.\n\nConsidering the other browsers mentioned in the linked answer:\nSwiftfox displays version 3.6.1, the forum link and download links are not working. I was not able to install it (in the past I did, but it was not working separately from firefox).\nIt is a bit tricky to install Iceweasel in Ubuntu and this browser will \"take over\" (\"compete with\") the main Firefox installation (see this answer). \nFlock browser is dead. (Only a mobile version proposed.)\n\nSo, one solution is: Icecat.\nAnother solution is Nightly version of Firefox - as specified in this other answer.\nAlso, Seamonkey satisfies in fact those conditions, in the sense that most important addons work, or have separate support from places like mozdev.org. More here.\n\nA: If you really want them to be identical, but still have at least some difference, you may want to use the Firefox Nightly build.\nSince the only Linux downloads on the site are annoying source-code tarballs, you will probably want to install via the repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install firefox-trunk\nThen, just check your programs list for \"Nightly.\" It will be called \"Nightly Web Browser,\" but that one is Firefox Nightly.\nIt runs with a completely separate profile, and will have some subtle differences from the stable, tested Mozilla Firefox.\nThis should be exactly what you're looking for!\n\nA: The best Firefox-clone would be a new separate instance of Firefox running with a separate profile. That could be launched from a separate shortcut/launcher or from within Firefox (see the addon at the end).\nFirefox allows the creation of separate profiles, they are easy to setup and you may use as many sets of addons and configurations as you wish. \nTo start the profile manager, open the terminal and type \nfirefox -ProfileManager -no-remote\nThen the profile manager comes up, click on create profile, and then name your profile, for example set1. You can also point another location for the profile folder. By default, the profile folder is located at /home/user/.mozilla/firefox/ and is named with a string of 8 random characters, followed by the name you gave it. You have to do Ctrl + H while in the home directory, to be able to see .mozilla folder.\nInstead of rebuilding an existing profile you have already built on Windows, you may go to the profile folder of your Windows Firefox, copy all contents and then paste them on your recently created profile folder in Ubuntu's Firefox. As detailed here, on Windows, the default location of Firefox profile folder is **%APPDATA%\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles**\nThen again, start profile manager, select your profile and you will be using it just the same.\nRepeat the process for every profile you wish to create.\nNow to be able to start each profile from a single shortcut and use more than one profile simultaneously, as detailed in this question, create a new text file on your desktop, name it set1.desktop. \nCopy this to the text file\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Firefox set1\nComment=My primary profile\nExec=firefox -Profile /home/user/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.set1 -no-remote\nPath=/home/user\nIcon=/my/icon/location\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=false\n\nReplace user and set1 with your username and profile name, respectively, and place the 8 random characters attributed to this profile.\nNote that you can set up a customized icon for this profile, this is helpful for diferentiation purposes, just point its location on the Icon line, for example /home/user/images/firefoxicon.png\nAfter that, save the changes, right click on the text file, make sure its name has the .desktop and on the permissions tab, allow it to run as an application.\nNow you have a shortcut to start this Firefox profile. When launched, you can right click on this icon in the Unity launcher and lock it there, so it is always accessible. You may move the shortcut somewhere else in your home folder too, it doesn't have to be on the desktop.\nRepeat the previous steps for each profile you have created before, and then, with just a double-click, you will have one or more Firefox profiles started.\nIt will require some work to set up, depending on how many profiles you wish, but after that, it really is almost like you had several Firefox instances installed.\nThe source of this answer is this one given by Mik to a separate question: How to create shortcuts to different Firefox profiles.\nTo switch profiles within Firefox with one click, see this addon.\n\nA: Instead of using clones, you may use different profiles with Firefox.\nJust press Alt + F2 and type firefox -profilemanager. Create different profiles as necessary and run them simultaneously if needed.\n\nTo run Firefox with a different profile you would type firefox -P PROFILENAME -no-remote\nYou may even create different .desktop files with the command-line options added to launch them easily. Simply copy the /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications rename it and edit the exec line adding the -P PROFILENAME -no-remote.\n\nA: Yet another possibility (not necessarily the best) is to run Tor Project's portable Firefox from the Tor Browser Bundle.\nSome arguments in favor are:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's Firefox ESR with some modifications.\n\n*Completely portable (source of quote), meaning its user profile is separated from any other Firefox or similar installed on the system:\n\n\nThis package requires no installation. Just extract it and run.\n\n\n*No hacking other than extracting the files and double-clicking on either start-tor-browser (you might choose to stop Tor services) or directly run-mozilla.sh under the App/Firefox folder. Naturally, it can be added to the Dash too.\n\n\nTo still benefit from the protection provided by the Tor software, you can simply make a copy of the Firefox folder somewhere else. \nThis way, you keep the original Firefox distributed as part of the Tor Browser Bundle (and use it whenever you want anonymity on the internet), and you can run and configure as you like the copy of the Firefox.\nThis is because several extensions and plugins are not compatible with the anonymity intended when using the Tor software.\nI wouldn't claim this is the best answer, but I think it clearly fits the requirements on your original question.\n\nA: I've found Waterfox very helpful. It's updated and supports Firefox's add-ons, it also doesn't restrict the addons you can install and keeps a different profile from the original Firefox.\n", "Q: How to emulate pressing the Close button from a script? I wanted Thunderbird to stay in the Background to notify me of incoming mails.\nAfter a bit of searching, I found this post.\nHow to keep Thunderbird and Pidgin running on background?\nThe solution is to install an addon so that when we close Thunderbird it just stays in the background.\nNow, to have thunderbird running at Start up we can just add it to Startup Applications.\nBut, when I open my system, Thunderbird also gets opened and I have to manually press the close button everytime to make Thunderbird go into the background.\nThe solution given in the above post for this problem is to select Minimize on start. But doing so affects the way in which Thunderbird works when invoked from the Messaging menu. So I deselected this option.\nBut, if there is a way to emulate pressing the Close button from a script, I can just add that script to Startup Applications\nSo is there a way to achieve this?\nNote : If there is a simpler way to solve my original problem of keeping Thunderbird in background please post that also.\nMany thanks.\n\nA: In the probable absence of a Thunderbird command-line option that you could use to start it minimized or in the background, your best option is probably to use something like xdotool, which is in the repositories. (See my later note on the minimize to tray addon).\nThis is the command you need to minimise the instance of Thunderbird; xdotool searches for the Thunderbird window on the window stack and then minimizes it\nxdotool search --class thunderbird windowminimize %@\n\nMaximise Thunderbird and then try it in the terminal; it seems to be the command you are looking for. Often when used in scripts the --sync argument is added, as noted in the man page:\n\nAfter requesting the window minimize, wait until the window is actually minimized. This is useful for scripts that depend on actions being completed before moving on.\n\nYou may also have to delay the command a bit until Thunderbird has actually started up, and there is a sleep command built into xdotool, so you could use\nxdotool sleep 6 search --class thunderbird windowminimize %@\n\nand set the sleep interval at whatever value you needed.\nThis minimises Thunderbird, but not to the background like when you use the minimize to tray addon, as you set up that addon so that pressing exit sends Thunderbird to the tray. Assuming that addon is installed, it may be possible to use xdotool to emulate the mouse-click of the x in Thunderbird's window and so background it. However, using windowkill instead of windowminimize with Thunderbird (when the tray addon is installed) closes the entire application.\n\nAfter discussion it was said that the windowunmap option was the one necessary to actually hide the window; this is much easier than trying to emulate a click on the thunderbird window. \nxdotool sleep 6 search --class thunderbird windowunmap %@\n\n", "Q: How to split .zip files and join them in Windows?

Something like this should work:\nsplit your-zip.zip -b 32M ZIPCHUNKS\n\nThis will create a bunch of ZIPCHUNKS* files, in order, and all 32 MB or less in size. Change the 32M parameter to vary the chunk size.\nTraditionally you'd use cat to glue them back together:\ncat ZIPCHUNKS* > reassembled-zip.zip\n\nSince you want to do the reassembling on Windows, you need a substitute for cat. Is there replacement for cat on Windows may help, but note that the Windows type command will not work as it adds the files names between them when processing more than one file. One working approach is copy /b ZIPCHUNKS* > reassembled-zip.zip.\nYou can also use rar which natively supports creating \"split\" archives which can then be decompressed by a GUI tool on Windows such as WinZip or WinRar. On Ubuntu, install the rar package, then:\nrar a -v32M destination.rar files/to/compress\n\nThis will create files called destination.partXX.rar. Transfer these to Windows, then unrar the first one (destination.rar), which will link to the others automatically. \nOne trick you can potentially use is to \"rar\" the original zip file, that way you can reassemble it on Windows. If you have the original files, it may be easier to just rar them and work with that.\n\nA: Use zip command with -s split_size to compress files.\nThe example command is following.\nzip -r -s 100m filename.zip  compress_folder\n\n\nA: I had to do this a year or more ago. It is inconvenient, because Windows just doesn't have the same tools.\nI ended up using GSplit, which does work under WINE (or PlayOnLinux). It creates a .exe file and a bunch of .gsd files. If you are zipping a PDF file, you need to pre-zip it because Windows gets confused!\n\nA: If you have zip installed on your Ubuntu machine, you should also have zipsplit. This takes a large zip file and splits it into a number of smaller, stand-alone zip files. It doesn't rely on any particular version of WinZip or Rar to work, as the files it makes are plain Zip files.\nOne caveat: zipsplit still lives in the world of CP/M / MS-DOS 8.3 file names, so if you use it on biglongfilename.zip, you'll end up with biglon_1.zip, biglon_2.zip, biglon_3.zip, etc.\n", "Q: Is there a way to order applications in the launcher by frequency of use? Is there a way to order buttons in launcher by frequency of use? Have around 40 items and small screen size to view all of them. Did a search on software center, search engines but nothing about it.\n\nA: For your case, since you have a small screen and a lot of items to put in the launcher, I would first suggest the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Categorize Items\nBy using a tool like Drawers you can save a lot of space if you group apps with similar usage (Drawing apps, sound apps, office apps...)\nTo install, copy/paste the following lines in the terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ian-berke/ppa-drawers\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install drawers \nTo use is easy, create a \"Drawer\", put it in the launcher and just drag from the Dash the items you wish to have in that specific drawer.\n\n\n*Manually put in the top, the most used apps. Even though is manual, at least it will save you more time since you have the most used ones in the top.\n\n*Dash remembers. Open Dash an by typing the first letters of an app you normally use or rarely use it will pop in. You don't even have to write the whole name. If it appears as the first one, just press Enter. I know is not a solution but since what you are looking is to save you some time, pressing the SUPER and typing 3 or 4 letters is faster than looking for the app in the Launcher sometimes.\n\n\n*Post the idea in http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/ so it gets picked up and maybe included in a future version of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Symfony2 - Apache vhost for app_dev different port As I'm using url rewriting to access my Symfony2 application, it is directly available from\nhttp://my_application.my_domain.net\n\nNow I'd like to be able to access the dev environment simply using a different port like:\nhttp://my_application.my_domain.net:8081\n\n\nA: If you don't want to use\nhttp://my_application.my_domain.net/index_dev.php\n\nThat does pretty much the same job, here the solution:\n\nAfter having allowed your external IP to my_application/web/app_dev.php\n// ...\nif (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'])\n    || isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])\n    || !in_array(@$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], array(\n        'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx', // <- your IP\n        // ...\n    ))\n) {\n// ...\n\nConfigured /etc/apache2/ports.conf to tell Apache to listen in the additional port\n#...\nNameVirtualHost *:80\nListen 80\nNameVirtualHost *:8081\nListen 8081\n#...\n\nSimply duplicate the applications vhost (if you are using one)\n$ sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/my_application \\\n          /etc/apache2/sites-available/my_application_dev\n\nand change the file pointed by the url rewriter\n<VirtualHost *:8081>\n    ServerName my_application.my_domain.net\n\n    DocumentRoot \"/var/www/my_application/web\"\n    <Directory \"/var/www/my_application/web/\">\n        #...\n        <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n            RewriteEngine On\n            RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\n            RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /app_dev.php [QSA,L]\n        </IfModule>\n    </Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n\nFinally activate the new vhost\n$ sudo a2ensite my_application_dev\n$ sudo service apache2 restart\n\n", "Q: unsaved settings Just had ubuntu 12.04 installed on my pc, the only problem I am discovering is that none of my settings are saving.

I am automating some configurations on my systems using Puppet (however, that is not really relevant here). For a group of machines I want to load a kernel module at boot time. The most elegant way seems to edit /etc/modules and add one on an individual line. However, I would like to use separate files in a \".d\" directory structure for easier maintainability, rather than having Puppet editing a file.\nFor modprobe and specifying the options for or blacklisting modules, there's /etc/modprobe.d/, but what's the most elegant way for actually loading modules at boot time using a single new file? Basically, I'm looking for the non-existing /etc/modules.d/ directory.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: The directory you are looking for is\n/etc/modules-load.d\n\nFor example, to always load the nf_conntrack_pptp kernel module, add nf_conntrack_pptp to /etc/modules-load.d/pptp.conf. The filename doesn't matter, but I'm guessing the convention or requirement is that it ends in .conf.\nThis is implemented for older Ubuntu versions (without systemd) using a SysVinit script in /etc/init.d/kmod. For newer systemd-versions (15.04+), systemd handles this. Read the documentation man 5 modules-load.d.\n\nA: You should be able to put additional .conf files in /etc/modprobe.d/ to do module loading as well (even though the default files in there are all about blacklisting things).\nYou may be able to just put the module name on a line by itself, or if you need more complex behaviour, you can use 'install' at the beginning of a line.  From the manpage:\ninstall modulename command...\n    This is the most powerful primitive: it tells modprobe to run your command \n    instead of inserting the module in the kernel as normal. \n\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man5/modprobe.conf.5.html\n\nA: When using a file in /etc/modules.d directory\nyou have to use install directive.\nSince \"install\" is expecting [module_name] [command]\ninstall your_module /bin/true\n\nwill do the trick ;)\n", "Q: Preventing Users/Groups from accessing certain Domains I have created a Study account which I use when doing anything school related work. It's purpose is to remove the distractions of my normal account, such as social media and news websites.\nI know /etc/hosts can be edited to block certain domains from being accessed, but this is for all Users, and I don't want to have to switch in and out of Admin to change it every time I want to focus.\nIs there any way to block these domains for specific Users or Groups?\n\nA: You could use iptables to restrict the network access. The module ipt_owner enables you to match network packets by user id. A command like\niptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner mike --dst www.google.com -j DROP\nwould prohibit user mike to access www.google.com.\nAs iptables really works with IP's instead of hostnames, this would create several rules, one for each IP of www.google.com. Downside is that you can't use iptables to limit whole domains, you would have to repeat that command for every single hostname you would like to restrict.\nBe warned: If you're new to iptables you might have a hard time... ;)\n", "Q: What does this rule mean When I run sudo iptables -L, I get:\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nREJECT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:www flags:FIN,SYN,RST,ACK/SYN #conn/32 > 20 reject-with tcp-reset\n\nChain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\n\nWhat does this mean?\nI am pretty new to the whole Ubuntu world. I cannot access webmin at times, keep getting The connection has timed out error. \n\nA: This rule limits the number of parallel connections coming from a single IP to your webserver. In this case no more than 20 parallel connections from a single IP are allowed.\nUsually rules like these are used to protect against DoS attacks.\nGiven a browser which opens a new connection for every image included in the HTML file you might easily exceed this limit.\n\nA: That firewall rule prevents a particular type of attack against your computer, and wouldn't have anything to do with being unable to access a web-based tool. \nAn occassional \"connection timed out\" message generally means there is something wrong with the network you're using, or with the webserver hosting webmin.  \nThe only way the above rule would be affecting you is if you're running webmin on your own computer - is that the case?\n[edited to be more specific/accurate]\n", "Q: Wifi browser login problem We use a wifi network at my school in which you must login with your student account in the web brower.

I tried with Chrome and Firefox, but both browsers won't show any page.\nIs there a solution to this problem?\n\nA: I had the same problem with Ubuntu 16.04.

Save the file.  Then restart network-manager.\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nThen reconnect to the Wi-Fi network.\n\nA: I had this happen at a coffeeshop - I tried the suggested \"sudo dhclient\" above but got the error \"RTNETLINK answers: file exists\".\nI wondered if I had an actual IP address yet, so I did an \"ip addr show\" which told me I did indeed have a successful DHCP - out of curiosity, I figured I'd see if that LAN \"router\" address was open - so typed in the 192.168.x.1 (where x is the subnet of that coffeeshop) - and boom, the browser showed the login page just like windows did.\nSo anyway, if you're stuck, this might work for you too.

Is there anyway I can make an application in which a button made in Glade can be clicked to play a custom re-definable sound?\n\nA: You would need to connect the 'activate' signal of the button  to a handler function that then calls a library to play a sound.  For the sound playing part you can use any of the modules listed here\nIn glade select the button then choose signals and enter a name for the function handler:\n\nThen in your python code for the window, create the function (on_iconbutton_activate in my example).

But when I do I get this:\nsudo sysctl vfs.zfs.prefetch_disable=\"1\" \nsysctl: cannot stat /proc/sys/vfs/zfs/prefetch_disable: No such file or directory\nI cannot find anything for vfs or zfs in /proc/sys.\nWhere does one do this kind of thing in Ubuntu?\nThanks\n\nA: The option is already set by default in most zfs-fuse packages.  Double check that this is in the /etc/zfs/zfsrc file:\n# zfs-prefetch-disable : disable zfs high level prefetch cache\n# This setting can eat as much as 150 Mb of ram, so uncomment if you want\n# to save some ram and are ready to loose a little speed.\nzfs-prefetch-disable\n\nAlternatively, to set this option for the native ZoL driver, do this:\n# modprobe zfs zfs_prefetch_disable=1\n\nTo make the change permanent, create a /etc/modprobe.d/zfs file and put this line in it:\noptions zfs zfs_prefetch_disable=1\n\nMost tunable parameters for ZFS on Linux are set through module options.  You can get a full list of available options by running this command:\n# modinfo zfs\n\nMost of these options will correspond directly to things that can go in the loader.conf or sysctl on other systems.\n\nA: You can find more settings in /sys/module/zfs/parameters\nFor exmaple:\n$ cat /sys/module/zfs/parameters/zfs_prefetch_disable\n0\n$ echo 1 >/sys/module/zfs/parameters/zfs_prefetch_disable\n\n", "Q: Fingerprint GUI on Thinkpad X1 Carbon I have a Thinkpad X1 Carbon.

I've installed FTL: Faster Than Light on my girlfriend's Lubuntu machine and created a .desktop file for it.  Strangely, the program won't launch via its menu entry under 'Games'.  \nIf I navigate to /home/andi/.local/share/applications/ via pcmanfm and double click on FTL Faster Than Light.desktop the game launches without a problem.  I know the menu entry is generated through the .desktop file so why won't it launch from the menu?\nHere's the .desktop file I created: FTL Faster Than Light.desktop\n\nA: Based on your response to Alex L.'s comment, it sounds like FTL is looking for various things in your current working directory, so if you navigate using a filebrowser or using cd, it works.  Since the menu doesn't do that, there's something that it can't find. \nTry editing the .desktop file so the Exec line looks like this instead:\nsh -c \"cd /home/andi/.local/share/FTL/ && ./FTL\"\n\nThat will switch directories first, and should let FTL find everything it needs to start.\n\nA: Paste the following into your text editor:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /home/andi/.local/share/FTL/\n./FTL\nexit 0\n\nSave it as FTL-launch in ~/bin/ and set it as executable. Then change the exec line in your .desktop file to\nExec=FTL-launch\n\nThis is, of course, based on ImaginaryRobots' answer; I've used similar launchers for some old windows games running in wine, where they need to be launched from within their directory.\nIf you don't have a ~/bin, you'll just have to create one - though then you may need to log out & log in again for it to work.\n\nA: Did you install the desktop file? As far as I understand, desktop files need to be installed by doing,\nsudo desktop-file-install myfile.desktop\n\nWhere, of course, myfile.desktop should be 'FTL Faster Than Light.desktop' in this case.\nYou could also try using alacarte (also called Main Menu), in which you can create launchers via a GUI.\n\nA: You could try making the .desktop file executable. While it's not part of Lubuntu, I know that Nautilus will not run any non executable desktop files. Maybe Lubuntu's menu requires this as well.\nAlso, I would try removing the spaces from the file name of the .desktop file.\n", "Q: Graphic issue on intel945 chipset I used Intrepid(8.10) and my graphics used to work fine with compiz effects and all(on better resolution than 1024x768).Now I have upgraded to Precise(12.04)but I use gnome classic(with compiz effects)as my desktop but the compiz effects seem not to work, only unity 2D works.\nWhen I ran lshw -c video it gives:\n\n*-display UNCLAIMED\n\n   description: VGA compatible controller\n   product: 82945G/GZ Integrated Graphics Controller\n   vendor: Intel Corporation\n   physical id: 2\n   bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\n   version: 02\n   width: 32 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: msi pm vga_controller bus_master cap_list\n   configuration: latency=0\n   resources: memory:fea80000-feafffff ioport:dc00(size=8) memory:e0000000-efffffff memory:fea40000-fea7ffff\n\nSysinfo shows:\nDisplay\nResolution       1024x768 pixels\nOpenGL Renderer  Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe(LLVM 0x300)\nX11 Vendor       The X.Org Foundation \n\nOn SystemSettings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Memory    993.3 MiB\n\n*Processor Intel® Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.40GHz\n\n*Graphics  VESA: Intel(r) 82945G Chipset Family Graphics\n\n*OS type   32-bit\n\n\nglxgears output comes to be around 100fps which used to be around 900fps in Intrepid\n", "Q: Boot to Runlevel 3 I am running Ubuntu Server, and just installed the gnome desktop on there (I neeeded to run an application that would only work in a graphical interface). However, now the server boots to the GUI every time. I need the server to boot to the command line (runlevel 3). According to several articles that I've read, Ubuntu does not use the standard runlevels. What file do I need to modify in order to boot to runlevel 3 (or whatever the Ubuntu equivalent is)?\n\nA: Theoretically, if Ubuntu were compliant with UNIX and Linux standard, adding '3' to grub's 'kernel' command in /boot/grub/menu.lst should have been sufficient, because runlevel '3' means no 'X11' according to this standard.\nUnfortunately, Ubuntu has ignored the standard and that's why you'll need to change /etc/init/lightdm.conf or /etc/init/gdm.conf (or whatever DM you use) as well. This is how mine \"on start\" condition looks like:\nstart on ((filesystem\n       and runlevel [!06]\n       and runlevel [!03]\n       and started dbus\n       and plymouth-ready)\n      or runlevel PREVLEVEL=S)\n\nIn Grub's menu.lst I've also added a menu item that allows me to boot to runlevel 3:\ntitle           Ubuntu 11.10 Server No UI, kernel 3.0.0-32-generic-pae\nroot            (hd0,0)\nkernel          /vmlinuz-3.0.0-32-generic-pae root=UUID=your-root-disk-id 3 ro\ninitrd          /initrd.img-3.0.0-32-generic-pae\nquiet\n\n\ntitle           Ubuntu 11.10, kernel 3.0.0-32-generic-pae\nroot            (hd0,0)\nkernel          /vmlinuz-3.0.0-32-generic-pae root=your-root-disk-id ro\ninitrd          /initrd.img-3.0.0-32-generic-pae\nquiet\n\nNow I can chose between booting to runlevel 5 with X11 or to runlevel 3 without it.    \n\nA: I think there is a good answer at How do I disable X at boot time so that the system boots in text mode?\nJust to answer your question on how to change run level. Edit the file /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf and change this line.\nenv DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL=2\n\nBut changing runlevel won't stop X. Look at the start condition for ligthdm:\nstart on ((filesystem\n       and runlevel [!06]\n       and started dbus\n       and (drm-device-added card0 PRIMARY_DEVICE_FOR_DISPLAY=1\n            or stopped udev-fallback-graphics))\n      or runlevel PREVLEVEL=S)\n\nYou need change the start condition in the /etc/init/XXX file to something than isn't met, e. g. a higher run level than you use. XXX is the display manager you use, e. g. lightdm.conf, gdm.conf, failsafe-x.conf.\n\nA: Here is deep instrtuction for runlevels - http://sysadmin.te.ua/linux/linux-boot.html \n\nA: The following is for Ubuntu Server 12 LTS \nFirst you need open a real term with CTRL+ALT F1 and login.\nStop gdm with.\n$ sudo service gdm stop\n\nRemove gdm you dont need it at all on a server.\n$ sudo apt-get remove gdm\n\nSet next boot runlevel with.\n$ sudo telinit 3\n\nWithout gdm you will need to install xinit if you want to still be able to run gui based apps without the gdm window manager.\n$ sudo apt-get install xinit\n\nReboot to runlevel 3.\n$ sudo reboot\n\nTo run a GUI or desktop after reboot do. \n$ startx\n\nThis will start your gnome session as normal.\nWhen finished simply logout of your desktop to and drop you back to a level 3 term\nAlso you can now start individual apps without a desktop too like.\n$ startx nautilus\n\nor privileged with  \n$ startx sudo synaptic\n\n\nA: it's quite simple, (I'm using 15.10 so depending on your release you might need to turn off gdm instead of lightdm)\n\n\n*\n\n*turn off the your display manager for the desired runlevel (for me 3)\nsudo update-rc.d lightdm stop 3\n\n\n*tell grub to boot runlevel 3 by default\nsudo vim /etc/defaults/grub\n\nand change\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"3\"\n\n\n*update your grub config\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n*reboot the box or run\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\n\nA: I was trying to install NVIDIA graphic card driver and CUDA toolkit, and the installation guide says \"Reboot into text mode (runlevel 3)\".

First of all, sorry for my bad English, as it isn't my primary language.\nI have a home network with my Ubuntu box, a Windows XP box (sister's laptop) and a Windows 7 box (mother's PC). Never had a mixed network; with some effort I could install Samba and see the PCs (and be seen for them).\nAll Windows PCs can access Ubuntu, create and delete files and folders in the shared folders like a charm, and I can do the same with the Windows XP PC. From Ubuntu to Windows 7, however, I can't; a window requesting credentials appears, but there's nothing password-protected accounts in Windows 7. There's just one user account on that computer, without password.\nHow can I access this computer?\n\nA: You might need to check that \"Turn off password protected sharing\" is selected under Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > Network and Sharing Center.\nYou may also be able to give access to a Guest account on the Windows 7 box for the folders you want to share, and then from Ubuntu just enter the log-in name as Guest.\n\nA: If you want to access the Windows 7 computer without a password? \n\nI suggest you disable \"Password protected sharing\" on the Windows 7 computer, and then specially allow Guest account to access the shared components.\n\nTo turn off Password Protected Sharing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Start, enter \"Network and Sharing Center\" in the Start Search box .\n\n*Click \"Change advanced sharing settings\" in the left pane.\n\n*Make sure that \"Password protected sharing\" is turned off.\n\n\nA: I recommend for you to add a simple password in you Windows 7 system, a simple one just for you access the network in that case you can ask the system, both Ubuntu and XP, to memorize the password. I had the same problem; it's work very well for me.\n\nA: Make sure you add a user on the Windows 7 machine for the username on the Ubuntu machine. For example, if you want to connect to the Windows machine as \"Fred\" you need to add a \"Fred\" user to the Windows machine to assign permissions in Windows 7.\n", "Q: Strugling with Samsung NP300V5AH and bumblebee on 12.10 I have some problems with optimus on 12.10.

/etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf with those values:\n\n\n*\n\n*KeepUnusedXServer=false\n\n*TurnCardOffAtExit=true\n\n*Driver=nvidia\n\n\nEvery time you change this file, restart bumblebee using sudo restart bumblebeed. If it still doesn't work try replacing nvidia with nouveau. \nAlso make sure you have installed bumblebee-nvidia package and that you are not using an experimental nvidia driver (nvidia-experimental-310, for example).\nIf it still doesn't work, the best way to diagnose the problem is starting it in verbose mode\nsudo stop bumblebeed\nsudo /usr/sbin/bumblebeed -vv\n\nThen you can start optirun SOME_PROGRAM in another terminal and post the errors you get on bumblebeed terminal.\nTip: after you get this to work, as you want to use it for gaming you should take a look at primus.\n", "Q: Bash script won't stay open in background after running through while I can't get the following bash script to stay open after the first message is received from NC:\n#!/bin/bash\nport=3333\nnc -l $port | while read msg; do notify-send Alert \"$msg\"; done\n\nAfter the first message it exits. I want it to stay open and continue monitoring for new messages from NC.\nI know that if I launch nc -l port without the while loop it stays open and I can chat away between the two connections even disconnect from the connected host.\nI am sending the message using:\necho 'done' | nc IP port\n\n\nA: Just add a -k option to nc. Like this:\nnc -l $port -k | while read msg; do notify-send Alert \"$msg\"; done\nAs seen in man nc:\n\n-k\n  Forces nc to stay listening for another connection after its current connection is completed. It is an error to use this option without the -l option.\n\n\nA: You should use -k option. nc -lk 3333\nAs stated by man nc\n -k      Forces nc to stay listening for another connection after its current\n         connection is completed.  It is an error to use this option without the\n         -l option.\n\n\nEdit:\nNotice me and my comrade here posted same answer close to simultaneously.

I have had an AMD Radeon HD 6950 (i.e., Cayman series) for a couple years now, and I have tried a lot of combinations of drivers and settings with terrible results. I'm completely at a loss as to how to proceed. The open source driver has much better 2D performance, but it offloads all OpenGL rendering to the CPU.\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*All the latest stable Ubuntu releases in the period, plus one Linux Mint release.\n\n*All the latest stable AMD Catalyst Proprietary Display Drivers, and currently 13.1.\n\n*The unofficial wiki installation instructions for every Ubuntu version and the semi-official Ubuntu instructions.\n\n*All the tips and tweaks I could find for Minecraft (Optifine, reducing settings to minimum), VLC (postprocessing at minimum, rendering at native video size), Catalyst Control Center (flipped every lever in there) and X11 (some binary toggles I can no longer remember).\n\n\nResults:\n\n\n*\n\n*Typically 13-15 FPS in Minecraft, 30 max (100+ in Windows with the same driver version).\n\n*Around 10 FPS in Team Fortress 2 using the official Steam client.\n\n*Choppy video playback, in Flash and with VLC.\n\n*CPU use goes through the roof when rendering video (150% for 1080p on YouTube in Chromium, 100% for 1080p H264 in VLC).\n\n*glxgears shows 12.5 FPS when maximized.\n\n*fgl_glxgears shows 10 FPS when maximized.\n\n\nHardware details from lshw:\n\n\n*\n\n*Motherboard ASUS P6X58D-E\n\n*CPU Intel Core i7 CPU 950 @ 3.07GHz (never overclocked; 64 bit)\n\n*6 GB RAM\n\n*Video card product \"Cayman PRO [Radeon HD 6950]\", vendor \"Hynix Semiconductor (Hyundai Electronics)\"\n\n*2 x 1920x1200 monitors, both connected with HDMI.\n\n\nI feel I must be missing something absolutely fundamental here.

In hindsight obvious, since both end up offloading the rendering to the CPU.\n\n\nMy /var/log/Xorg.0.log after upgrading to AMD Catalyst 13.1.

All three \"monitor\" devices are connected with HDMI.\n\nEdit: Chris Carter's suggestion to use the xorg-edgers PPA (Catalyst 13.1) resulted in some improvement, but still pretty bad performance overall:\n\n\n*\n\n*Minecraft stabilizes at 13-17 FPS, but at least the CPU load is \"only\" at 45-60%.\n\n*Still 150% CPU use for 1080p video rendering on YouTube in Chromium.\n\n*Massive improvement for 1080p H264 in VLC: 40-50% CPU use and no visible jitter\n\n*glxgears performance about doubled to 25-30 FPS when maximized.\n\n*fgl_glxgears still at ~10 FPS when maximized.\n\n\nA: The best and most stable performance I have managed from my Radeon 5450 has been achieved by adding the xorg-edgers ppa found here \nHaving spent an age experimenting between fglrx proprietary drivers and AMD Catalyst drivers this has been one ppa I have no hesitation in adding. \n\n\nA: One thing you may wish to do is COMPLETLY removal of fglrx drivers. Up to manual removal of any files that could be omitted.\nThan installation of Mesa drivers (so you have anything more than VESA mode :P ).\nAnd then fresh installation of drivers.\nPS Do you have hybrid graphics under Windows?

Firefox, Opera, SeaMonkey, Chrome etc etc. Except leave the thick mark out from passwords so you do not reinstall or re-type them on next time you surf like to any web mail or facebook, twitter etc.\nOn system no need to clean extensive files like memory, deep scans etc. Temp files are ok. Bash is just what you have typed in terminal it will clean them text cache out. If you use skype, pidgin, emphaty chat clients, you can clean them as well all.\nSystem type is good to use caution so you do not clean things that your system is needing to operate normal ops or apps.\nAPT you can tick all of them, same on bash history.Chromium all except passwords.

Under 12.04 \"rfkill list all\" displays the following for bluetooth:\n2: dell-bluetooth: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n4: hci0: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\nI have a dell M1210 running 12.04. I am able to pair and maintain bluetooth connection with my BT mouse. BT mouse connection works after resuming from suspend as well. When I installed 12.10 rfkill does not list \"dell-bluetooth...\" -- only \"hci0: Bluetooth\" is listed. Also in 12.10 bluetooth connection to my mouse must be repaired after resuming from suspend. I tested \"rfkill block bluetooth\" and noticed the bluetooth indicator light does not go off under 12:10 (it did under 12.04). I reinstalled 12.04 and bluetooth works perfectly.\nHope this helps troubleshoot.\n\nA: Try installing 'Blueman blutooth manager' from Ubuntu Software Center and restart computer. It worked for me.\n\nA: I am not sure \"Blueman bluetooth manager\" helps.\nIn my case, I tested with and without it. It seems random. Sometimes the bluetooth device will be found and will be working fine. Other times it won't even show up on hcitool dev, but it will be there on lsusb and it will be listed with all items as 'no' on rfkill list all.\nWhen it does not work, I just restart the machine until eventually it works.\n", "Q: Issue installing *gfortran* I am trying to installing gfortran on my ubuntu system and I am following the steps mentioned in http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries32Linux , unfortunately one of the step in the installation steps to says \nInstall using the following command:\ntar -xzvf gfortran-4.5-linux-i686.tar.gz -C /\nbut the download link provides a .deb file which I have installed it.

So what's the right solution here?\nEDIT: The start script did actually start the service, but dumped errors out due to the juju-log calls.  I'd still like to know what the \"right\" solution is here.\n\nA: Well, if this was a Juju config option for the charm, I think the charm should restart it automatically.

First restart your computer and see if your still facing the same problem. \nIf the problem still exists, open your ~/.bashrc file and add the proxy entry in this file.\nFor this to take effect, you have to either restart your terminal or run source ~/.bashrc\n", "Q: What PDF Editors are available on Ubuntu? I was wondering if there is a pdf reader-writer-publisher-editor that can add text, highlight, shapes and general edit an existing pdf document.\nSomething like Nitro in windows.\n\nA: There are several FOSS options out there, none of which come close to the functionality of editors such as Foxit PDF Reader under Windows or commercial solutions under Linux. That's why I prefer to run Foxit via PlayOnLinux. \nAs far as native applications are concerned, Master PDF Editor is probably the most advanced free (as in beer) PDF editing suite available in Ubuntu right now. It's available from the Ubuntu Software Center but requires you to register an account with Ubuntu before installing.\nA few months ago I stumbled on Quoppa PDF Studio, a commercial PDF editing solution that runs natively on Linux via Java. It comes with a very impressive featureset and is very close to Adobe Acrobat in terms of PDF editing functions. However, I have found PDF Studio to be a bit less stable than Adobe's solution when editing very large PDF files (≥ 500 pages). \nOther than that I would say that PDF Studio is a very good, albeit expensive, piece of software and probably the best PDF editing suite out there on Linux right now. \nYou can download a free trial version here. It doesn't come with a time restriction. Instead, edited PDFs are automatically watermarked by the software to indicate that you're using the trial edition.\n\nA: LibreOffice 4.0 opens PDF files in LibreOffice Draw where you can make all kinds of edits.  I just used it to enlarge 80 images and move them around; it worked great!  \nIf you are using Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, or 13.04 then you probably have version 3.5, which does not have this feature.  As I did, you can now force Ubuntu to upgrade to version 4.0 by typing the following in a terminal (press enter after each line).\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf you don't have LibreOffice installed for whatever reason, then instead of the last line, type this.\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice\n\n\nA: I've been using PDF-Xchange Viewer for quite some time with no problems.  In order to use it, first install PlayOnLinux and then choose to install the viewer from PlayOnLinux.\n\nA: Master PDF Editor (current version 3.3.20) for linux is pretty good and is available for Ubuntu for free. It has been very good for me, by and large and worth a try.\nRecently I have been collating text books for my daughter and have finished more than 15 Higher Secondary textbooks from individual chapters available from National Council of Educational Research & Training, India, using Master PDF Editor (64bit) on Ubuntu 15.04. The average number of pages are about 350 with lots of illustrations, graphics, multiple columns etc. I could insert cover images, add book marks, remove water marks (individually, from each page, though), correct some errors. I could not get the default paper size of the document and had to extract the first page and reinsert delete content for adding exact size blank pages. It worked fine. Else, trial and error is the only option. You can easily delete unwanted characters, boxes, etc. But inserting symbols and subscript/ superscript is a problem. I copied and pasted symbols available elsewhere in the document. If you have to add content, probably you need to use another editor, I guess, carefully, matching the font, size, style, symbols etc. You may be able to get the details from document properties or publisher documentation. \nI could do well in all, till I encountered with Class 12 Biology book, which contained heavy graphics, colors, non embedded fonts and other non-standard pdf stuff, perhaps. Master PDF Editor, started misbehaving, hanging etc. even for opening editable files, page navigation, saving etc. The files after simple removal of water mark, merging etc. got bloated nearly twice the size of the original components. Not able to process even a couple of hundred pages and cumulative file sizes of about 175 MB. \nI have submitted this sample to their technical support and got a feedback that large files could be a problem and being worked upon. \nBottom line: Very good for standard pdf documents for editing. Pdf input and pdf/ image output. Check for non-embedded quantities in input. \n", "Q: Get back to gnome/Enlightenment from the command line So say I accidentally hit CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+BACKSPACE and drop to the commandline from my nice clean engligntenment interface.

During installation select to put grub to the root of your device, for example /dev/sda instead of /dev/sda2.\nIf not, you can still install grub to boot Windows and any other operating systems you may have using pretty much any Linux live media.

I want to ditch these commercial software completely, so please for the benefit of most Graphic Designers and Animation Crazies like myself, and again I plead with you, help us out with a good solution on how to go about it, or maybe even develop a translation tool that helps these programs run seamless in the Ubuntu environment.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Wine (Windows Compatibility layer) is a software that gives you the possibility to run Windows software in Linux and OSX.\nThis of course doesn't mean that every Windows software will work, specially those that require Windows features only available in, well... Windows.\nAccording to Wine's app database:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adobe Illustrator CS6 is rated Silver, meaning it works but up to a certain degree of functionality. (more info)\n\n*Adobe Photoshop  CS6 is also rated Silver (more info)\n\n*Flash Professionnal CS6 is rated Silver,  (more info)\n\n*Adobe InDesign CS6 is rated Bronze, meaning it runs but it's highly unstable, (more info)\n\n\nIf you want to use the Open Source alternatives to these softwares:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inkscape, is a free Vector drawing program to install it: sudo apt-get install inkscape\n\n*GIMP, Pinta are free alternatives to Raster graphics editing software such as Photoshop to install any of them: sudo apt-get install gimpor sudo apt-get install pinta\n\n*Synfig Studio is an animation software resembling Flash to install it download it from their site and select the corresponding DEB file.\n\n*Scribus is a DPT, a Desktop Publishing Tool much like InDesign to install it: sudo apt-get install scribus\n\nA: Nigel: You can try Virtual Box (or VMWare). You create a Virtual Machine and you can install NEARLY any operating system you want. The problem is, that you won't see Windows when you boot up. You will have to run Ubuntu and from there you will have to start the Virtual Machine.\nI use Virtual Box in my job and have seven virtual machines. Two for our proprietary system, four with Debian and one with Ubuntu and they can communicate with each other via internal network.\n", "Q: Can I get further details on \"Application has crashed\" message More often than not, on booting to Kubuntu 12.04.01, I get a pop-up message \"An application has crashed, now or in the past\". I dismiss the message and everything seems fine. Occasionally when booting recently to Windows XP as administrator (though not as regular user) I have had an equally non-informative message \"Your system has recovered from a serious error\".\nShould I be worried; if so, how do I find out which application and fix the problem? \n\nA: The details of recent application crashes are stored in the file /var/log/apport.log.\nThat should give you information on what application has crashed recently.\nAfter that, I would recommend reading How can I track a bug that caused a crash?\nI would also search Launchpad for the application that you are seeing crash to determine if this may be a known bug.\n", "Q: can't make bootable usb on mac I've been trying to do this since yesterday, following the instructions given on ubuntu.com's official page here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx\nI can complete every step without error. However, when restarting the mac, the flash drive simply reports 'missing operating system, press any key...'. From there, there's nothing I can do except a hard reset.\nI've tried Unetbootin, but that won't create a usb that's bootable from a mac. \nedit: I've also fixed the partition tables with rEFIt, but still no joy.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Here's my own answer:\nOK, so I figured it out, largely thanks to this extended thread on macforums\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1329407\nHowever, I'm going to offer a summarized version here. Whoever's responsible for the ubuntu page on this (the one I linked to in my OP) really should get it changed. Those instructions just don't work.\nHere's what you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu.iso\n\n*Download and install rEFIt from here http://refit.sourceforge.net\n\n*Download and install the app UNetbootin from here: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net\n\n*A 4GB Flash Drive formatted to FAT32\n\n*free space on an internal or external disk to boot from and install too.\nCreate flash drive files:\nStart up UNetbootin. Choose the ubuntu iso as the source and the flash drive as the destination. When that's finished you'll get a warning that the USB is not bootable on a mac. That's expected.\nCreate partitions on hard disk:\nOpen Disk Utility and choose the internal or external disk that you're going to use. Create a 2GB partition on it, formatted to FAT32. Create another partition (you can choose FAT32 for this too) the same size as you want your final install to be (I have a 750GB internal disk on my mac, so I gave ubuntu 100GB of that).\nGet device names:\nOpen Terminal.app on your mac and copy/paste this command (you can type it, but there'll be some more complex commands later that you might want to cut and paste to avoid errors)\ndiskutil list\n\nFrom the output, identify both the flash drive and the 2gb partition. They will have names such as /dev/disk1s1 and dev/disk0s4 for example. Make sure you pick the right name, or you could end up doing some damage. \nDismount devices:\nOpen Disk Utility.app, and click on the flash drive in the sidepanel. Hit the 'dismount' button in the taskbar above. Do the same for the 2gb internal partition.\nMove files from flash drive to HD partition:\nCopy and paste this into Terminal, but DO NOT press 'return':\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk1s1 of=/dev/rdisk0s4\n\nChange the device names to match those you found in step 3. The first device name is source (the flash drive), the second one is the destination (the 2gb fat partition on your internal disk). Notice that I've added an 'r' before 'disk' on the output device. That's deliberate and you should make sure you add it too, as it speeds up the copy process considerably.\nDouble check that line is correct, then when you're ready, press 'return' and enter your admin password (it'll be invisible when you type it).\nRemove flash drive:\nWhen that eventually completes, dismount and remove the flash drive. You don't need it anymore. \nFix partition tables:\nRestart your mac with the option key held down. From the rEFIt menu, choose 'sync partition tables'. Confirm with 'y' and exit. Then choose 'restart' from the rEFImenu. \nStart up ubuntu live CD:\nYou should now see the Penguin logo. Click on it to start the Ubunutu Live CD.\n\nA: I got ubuntu installed on my IMac mid 2011 following these instructions. Although I later figured out a way to cut the steps in half.\nI created an Ubuntu image directly into the HD partition without using the USB\nHere's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition the Mac hardisk using disk utilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a 40GB fat32 partition for Ubuntu\n\n*Create a 5GB partition to hold the bootable Linux image\n\n\n*Use Unetbootin to directly create the image in the 5GB partition.\n\n*Restart - hold down option key - boot into Ubuntu using rEFIT.\nHope this helps. Thanks for the the great post.\n\nA: https://bugs.launchpad.net/unetbootin/+bug/896686\nI have found that this bug in Unetbootin is still not fixed.\nUnetbootin does not work well on OSX.  The stick is not bootable in the end but I can use unetbootin on ubuntu all day long.\nI have used this formula successfully for making a USB installer on a mac:\n(first answer)\nHow do I create an Ubuntu live USB using a Mac?\nIt converts the iso to img.dmg, then uses dd.  The USB worked on a PC.\n\nA: Why not just use Terminal?\nJust use dd since Mac OS X is just a unix variant. You can test to see if it is installed by going to the terminal.\nopen up spotlight and type terminal and hit enter\ncmd+space -> Terminal\n\ntype in the terminal\n$ which dd\n\nif it gives you a path, it's installed. if there is no output and an empty prompt, you'll have to install it manually (though, i doubt that will be the case).\nyou basically have a unix shell running bash at your disposal and it would be easier to use your built-in tools. it'll also teach you some basics.\ndd is not typically advised to people unfamiliar with the tool because if used in an incorrect manner, it could destory your hdd, hence its nickname, destroy disk.\nim not sure what tools you'd have available to check your mount points and the devices mounted at those points. \nFiguring out your mount points\nThe most common tools for figuring out where your devices are mounted typically are\ndf - report file system disk space usage (df -h prints human readable info)\nmount - mount a filesystem (mount on its own will print similar info)\nfdisk - manipulate disk partition table (fdisk -l will list local partitions according to the device)\n\nif in doubt, check if fdisk is available.\n$ which fdisk\n/sbin/fdisk\n$ fdisk -l\nfdisk: cannot open /dev/sda: Permission denied\nfdisk: cannot open /dev/sdb: Permission denied\nfdisk: cannot open /dev/sdc: Permission denied\n$ sudo fdisk -l\n...lots of information here...\n\n...partition schema here...\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 1.8 TiB, 2000398934016 bytes, 3907029168 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nDisklabel type: (some type)\nDisk identifier: (id here)\n\nDevice     Boot Start        End    Sectors  Size Id Type\n/dev/sdb1        2048 3907028991 3907026944  1.8T  b W95 FAT32\n\n\nDisk /dev/sdc: 1.8 TiB, 2000398934016 bytes, 3907029168 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nDisklabel type: (some type)\nDisk identifier: (id here)\n\nDevice          Start        End    Sectors   Size Type\n/dev/sdc1        2048 1953515519 1953513472 931.5G Microsoft basic data\n/dev/sdc2  1953515520 3907028991 1953513472 931.5G Microsoft basic data\n\n\nDisk /dev/sdd: 15 GiB, 16131293184 bytes, 31506432 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos\nDisk identifier: 0xc3072e18\n\nDevice     Boot Start      End  Sectors Size Id Type\n/dev/sdd1        2048 31506431 31504384  15G  b W95 FAT32\n\nThe stuff you care about will look somewhat like this.\nDisk /dev/sdd: 15 GiB, 16131293184 bytes, 31506432 sectors\n...redundant information here...\n\nDevice     Boot Start      End  Sectors Size Id Type\n/dev/sdd1        2048 31506431 31504384  15G  b W95 FAT32\n\nWe know the device name and where it is located.\n/dev/sdd (the device name)\n/dev/sdd1 (the device partition)\n\nto confirm, we just use df\n$ df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\nudev            3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /dev\ntmpfs           793M  9.4M  784M   2% /run\n/dev/sda5       450G   15G  413G   4% /\ntmpfs           3.9G  780K  3.9G   1% /dev/shm\ntmpfs           5.0M  4.0K  5.0M   1% /run/lock\ntmpfs           3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\n/dev/sda3        96M   29M   68M  30% /boot/efi\ntmpfs           793M   24K  793M   1% /run/user/1000\n/dev/sdd1        16G   11M   15G   1% /media/$USER/UBSKEY\n\nOnce you know where your usb drive is mounted, unmount it before preceding\n$ umount /dev/sdXy\n\nfor example\n$ umount /dev/sdd1\n\nIt's straight forward from here.\nWriting the ISO to USB\nWe know where the iso is, usually Home -> Downloads (or something similar). Now we just tell dd to write to the usb stick to make a live medium (source). The general idea is outlined as\n\n\n*\n\n*change to the directory where iso is located\n\n*verify youre in the right directory and the file is present\n\n*write the iso to the usb\nfor example\n$ cd ~/Downloads\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0 (if nothing is present)\n    or\n...file names here...\n$ sudo dd if=ubuntu-file-name.iso of=/dev/sdd bs=4M && sync\n\nwait until it is finished. there will be no indication of what is happening until it has completed. sync will make sure everything turned out alright and print out information indicating what it has read and written once it has finished.\nNote: If you use dd to write to a partition, it will always fail to boot. you have to write to the first byte of the device so that it can create a boot sector on the USB. thats why i write to /dev/sdd and not /dev/sdd1\n\nA: Make a bootable USB for Mac.\nGo to GParted in Linux on a PC->Device->Create partition table->In the dropdown box choose Mac->Format USB to FAT32->Use USB writer to write to USB. I tried USB flash drives and they didn't work. \nA 15-year-old IDE HDD in a USB hard drive caddy worked the first time. USB flash drives didn't make a Mac partition table, but the old HDD in a USB external hard drive enclosure did. Plug in the USB caddy->Turn on the MAC and when you hear the sound push and hold the Option key and the USB will appear. Click on USB->It will load->Then install Linux on the MAC hard drive using the USB HDD.\n", "Q: Gesture to minimize window in Gnome Shell I have Ubuntu 12.04 with Gnome Shell chosen as Desktop Manager.\nI'm getting used to how the windows are resized as they are dragged on some edge of the screen (e.g. maximized when dragged on the top, split by half horizontally and right-aligned when dragged on the right ecc), but I'd really like a similar way to minimize the windows when dragged on the bottom, for example.\nI know this is possible with a custom shortcut, but, I'd like to do that with just a mouse. So, is it possible? :)\n\nA: You could try Easystroke. Easystroke allows users to create custom mouse gestures so you could simply make a gesture to minimize all windows or the current window or whatever. This blog post talks a little about it. There is also more information from the tips/tricks and documentation from the developer. \n", "Q: How do you Install the Latest Release of Miro? In the software centre the latest release of Miro available is 4.0.4 whereas the latest release of Miro is 5.0.4. \nHow do I download 5.0.4 on 12.10? \nI have tried following the guide at http://www.getmiro.com/download/for-ubuntu/ (and thus have already run sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pcf/miro-releases) but it failed and when I tried to run sudo apt-get update I received the error:\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/pcf/miro-releases/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/pcf/miro-releases/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nE: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\n\nA: As an update, note that the repository here:\nppa.launchpad.net/pcf/miro-releases/ubuntu/dists\nnow seems to include Miro for Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal.  However, the latest version in the repository is 4.0.4 whereas I understand that Miro version 5.0.4-1 is available for earlier versions of Ubuntu (12.04).  Not sure why this is the case.\nThanks.\n\nA: Just change the source definition of the PPA from quantal to precise. For some reason Precise has the right version under packages and Quantal does not. This will definitely work for you.\n", "Q: Install many fonts at once I have about a hundred fonts that I need to install. Manually right clicking every font file and clicking install, then selecting \"personal\" vs \"system\" in a dialog that appears, and then closing it is tedious. Is there a command that will let me achieve the same effect in one shot? (I am using KDE.)\n\nA: Sure, just move all of the fonts you want to install to ~/.fonts and then update the fontcache via:\nfc-cache -rv\n\nNote you might have to restart the application you want to use the fonts in for the changes to take effect.\n", "Q: Looking for a grep GUI So I want something pretty simple :) App where I put a dir to search, and a string/regexp to search in the file contents recursively in that dir, and it gives a list of results.\nI don't want something like 'tracker' that runs in the background and indexes things, I want something that just searches on demand like grep, given a path.\nIn windows I used grepWin which was pretty perfect for the purpose.\nI tried KFileReplace, seems a bit awkward. Also tried the built-in Nautilus search but it seems to only look at file names?\nEdit: gnome-search-tool seems more like what I'm looking for but it doesn't support regex (or it does, but just for file names).\n\nA: Searchmonkey. You can find it in universe.\n\n\n\nA: I know for these two guis, and I never used them, so I'm not sure if they are available through apt-get. Here are the links:\n\nhttp://sethoscope.net/grepui/\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/jgrep/\n\nAnd it seems that they are not so rich with features (judging by screenshots).\nHope this helps a bit.\n\nA: You could try regexxer, which is in the repositories. You can install it with\nsudo apt-get install regexxer\n\n\nAs noted in /usr/share/doc/regexxer/README:\n\nThe primary audience of this tool are Linux/Unix users who are tired of\n  typing find/grep/sed/awk/perl command lines.\n\nIt seems to be just what you want, as you can search files and folders, and also search within a selected document by using the search and replace feature that uses Perl style regular expressions. (However, you can only search within text files, html and xml files, and similar file types, not pdfs or office documents.)\nIn summary,\n\n\n*\n\n*You can specify various patterns in the pattern search box; for example, globs (*), character classes [ab] and {brace expansions} can be used to help you find your files. You can also search recursively and for hidden files, which is particularly useful. \n\n*You can also use various complex regex patterns in the search/replace box, and there most Perl regular expressions can be used, which you can read about by referring to the previous link. (As an aside, Perl regular expressions can also be used with command-line grep: see man grep; you would need to specify the -P option)\n\n*To search inside a file, or search and replace strings, you find your document with the search on the left hand side, then click the document and use the right hand side to select your search/replace pattern. Then, in the simple example shown, you can click the button to replace or replace all, then save your document.\nSee also my answer here where I compare the respective search options available in regexxer and searchmonkey:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can Searchmonkey find a term inside textfiles?\n\n\nA: I prefer https://glogg.bonnefon.org/index.html\nIt's not too complicated, you can search using extended regular expressions, wildcards or fixed strings (Tools > Options)\nAnd more importantly, it has two views, the first view shows the matching lines, and the second view highlights the line you clicked/selected in the first view so you can view the line within the actual context, not the filtered one.\n", "Q: How to change the IP address on my Ubuntu virtual NIC I have a physical windows system, on which I run VMware Workstation. On a VMware virtual machine I run Ubuntu 12.10 and a LAMP webserver. \nProblem:\nNow my local IP address for my virtual NIC (the one Ubuntu is using) has an address of 192.168.159.7, and my home router only issues IP addresses in the range 10.0.0.x. So if I want to port-forward to the virtual NIC, which has a 192.168 address, I cannot, so my LAMP webserver cannot be accessed externally since the router does not know to send the packets on port 80 to the virtual NIC... How do I fix that? The only way, I guess, is to assign a 10.0.0.x ip address to the virtual NIC?? \nBut how do I do that? I tried to do it on the host Windows machine with 'Get my IP address automatically' but it issues a 192.168 address every time...\nThank you\n\nA: Configure the virtual machine's network adapter to be a bridged adapter instead of a NAT adapter. Then Ubuntu will obtain an IP address from the router and not from the Windows host.\nOne way or another you should see to it that the Ubuntu machine's network adapter has an unchanging IP address. Either configure the interface statically in Ubuntu or create a static address assignment in the DHCP server on the router.\n", "Q: Can't login as root anymore I wanted to change my username, and tried out this explanation here: https://askubuntu.com/a/205470/112035.\nFirst, I changed the username in /etc/passwd to the new one. Then I wanted to change it at /etc/group too, but since changing it at the first file I can't login as root anymore.\nIs there a way to solve this? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: You will need to get root privileges at boot time. Then you can revert the change you made and reset the password on the primary account.\nHow do I reset a lost administrative password?\nBe very careful changing usernames. /etc/passwd associates each username with a user ID (number). In some places in the system the number is used, in others the name. To change a username without breaking things you therefore have to change the name everywhere it occurs. I would recommend that you not try to change your username unless you are an expert. If you are an expert then I don't have to tell you about usermod(8).  ;-)\n\nA: I'we lost my root acsess, but can login in ubuntu...\nSolved with this metod:\nReboot in to recovery mode and \nto get Read/Write enabled done this\nmount -o rw,remount /\nchmod 0440 /etc/sudoers\nchown root /etc/sudoers\n\nThan added me to root user with this\nsudo adduser <my username> sudo\n\nWhen you replace my username with yours (without the <>)\nTo check username do this\nls /home\n\nTo change your password do this \npasswd <your password>\n\nWhen you replace my password with yours (without the <>)\nWhen done youst typereboot\nand you are done...\np.s. sorry for my bad English?!\n\nA: Reboot the computer into recovery mode (esc to grub and enter root prompt) and do\nchmod 0440 /etc/sudoers\nchown root /etc/sudoers\n\nReboot back to desktop and run in terminal:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -a\n\nThis will bring you through a series of menus to allow you to reconfigure all your packages and should fix any permissions issues.\n\nA: Could someone verify this?\nIn UNIX systems you also have an important file called /etc/shadow. Inside that file, you have encrypted password for each user. I think that you changed the files /etc/group and /etc/passwd but forgot to change the /etc/shadow. So now, you have changed a username, but you don't have actually a password for it. I am just theorizing here.\nFor example I created a dummy account, with dummy password. My contents of files are:\n/etc/shadow\ndummy:$6$ddvrCSTQ$4cAt8U.3sd6TQZ8Xi4VzOQv/GR7LA/bi72di9RE5v77y2U7os60DKbb0VLS.JPslf3g9GBBBzbNqW0y5ynkc11:15687:0:99999:7:::\n\n/etc/group\ndummy:x:1001:\n\n/etc/passwd\ndummy:x:1001:1001::/home/dummy:/bin/sh\n\nNow I will remove the entry from /etc/shadow file. This is what I get:\nsu dummy\nPassword: <I type dummy here>\nsu: Authentication failure\n\nSo there you have it. You should generate a proper hash for your new user and it to /etc/shadow.

I don't know as I have tried testdisk and it can't find partitions, and I have tried fdisk and it can't find a partition table in the image either.\n\nA: To recover data from a carved image of a damaged drive we usually simply load this image to our recovery software.\nFor Testdisk/Photorec  we simply issue the following command\ntestdisk image.dd  # to recover partitions\nphotorec image.dd  # to recover single files\n\nPlease consult the very nice tutorials from CG Security on further options and steps to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Testdisk  \n\n*Photorec\nNote that you will not be able to recover filenames, permissions and directories from running PhotoRec. It will just give you random numbered files, but with an appropriate extension.\n", "Q: Blank Screen at boot Ubuntu 12.04 - nvidia-current - Macbook Air 3,2 I've installed nvidia-current using the Additional Drivers application in Ubuntu 12.04.\nI need those drivers so I can use accelerated WebGL.\nAfter installing the drivers, and rebooting X fails to start and I have a frozen system/dark screen.\nBelow is the content of Xorg.0.log\nHow can I fix this problem?\n    [     4.666] \nX.Org X Server 1.11.3\nRelease Date: 2011-12-16\n[     4.666] X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0\n[     4.666] Build Operating System: Linux 2.6.42-23-generic x86_64 Ubuntu\n[     4.666] Current Operating System: Linux david-macbook-air 3.2.0-34-generic #53-Ubuntu SMP Thu Nov 15 10:48:16 UTC 2012 x86_64\n[     4.666] Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-34-generic root=UUID=b3d5ae2a-72af-4ef9-b775-0d40b5f80f9b ro quiet splash vt.handoff=7\n[     4.666] Build Date: 29 August 2012  12:12:33AM\n[     4.666] xorg-server 2:1.11.4-0ubuntu10.8 (For technical support please see http://www.ubuntu.com/support) \n[     4.666] Current version of pixman: 0.24.4\n[     4.666]    Before reporting problems, check http://wiki.x.org\n    to make sure that you have the latest version.\n[     4.666] Markers: (--) probed, (**) from config file, (==) default setting,\n    (++) from command line, (!!) notice, (II) informational,\n    (WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.\n[     4.666] (==) Log file: \"/var/log/Xorg.0.log\", Time: Thu Dec 13 10:18:02 2012\n[     4.668] (==) Using system config directory \"/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\"\n[     4.668] (==) No Layout section.

The binary NVIDIA driver requires something from the (fake) BIOS in order to work properly. There are a few options to deal with this. The easiest is to boot off of a burned install CD and just reinstall because that will install grub-pc instead of grub-efi. Another option is to do apt-get install grub-pc and that will fix the issue as well, but you'll have to actually get to a point where you can boot up and install it which requires network access.\nThe info I found that helped me fix it was here:\nhttp://martys.typepad.com/blog/2012/10/kubuntu-macbook-efi-and-nvidia.html\n", "Q: syscall_table_32.S file not found I want to add a systemcall to Linux, but in training data we need to change the file linux/arch/i386/kernel/entry.S or arch/x86/kernel/syscall_table_32.S.  I can not found the files.\nI looked and could not find and  I have not a folder named i386.\nplease Help me. is Necessary.\n\nA: First of all you need the source code of the Linux kernel. You can download it at kernel.org or you install the package linux-source from Ubuntu. In the latter case you'll find some patches from Ubuntu applied.\nUsually the sources live under /usr/src. If you have unpacked the files there or installed the package, you'll find the tree you mentioned above. So the most recent kernel version has a file called entry_32.S and entry_64.S in the subdirectory arch/x86/kernel. The part after arch has the name x86 and not i386 as you mentioned. If you want to use i386 you should choose a kernel version below 3.7, because i386 was removed from 3.7 on.\n\nA: the entry_64.S file isn't the equivalent file that you need to modify... depending on what you want to do. If you're  in the business of adding a custom syscall to your kernel, modify the file /arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl .\n", "Q: \"Ubuntu One\" authentication Failure in Windows 7 I just updated the Ubuntu One client on my Windows 7 machine today.

So I took a second drive, just an old empty one I had at hands (ATA-Maxtor 90648D3), plugged of the other drive with WinXP, so that it couldn't be harmed, and started the installationof Ubuntu 12.04. Everything went as it was supposed to, until the end. Normal shutdown after successful installation process. But when I tried to boot my new Ubuntu from the HDD, it said:\n error: out of disk.\n   grub rescue>\n\nSo, what to do now?\nI already tried a lot of things in the terminal, e.g. the update-grub as mentioned on http://opensource-sidh.blogspot.de/2011/06/recover-grub-live-ubuntu-cd-pendrive.html.\nEverything worked, he didn't complain about a missing data or anything, but at the end of the day he still wasn't able to boot!\nNext step was to change the etc/default/grub-file, so that it could load the ATA-drivers first, so that there is now problem with my drive.

I just switched the jumper-positions on the HDD, and now it works. I suppose the HDD was registered as a slave, which is not for booting issues. So if you want to boot a OS from a drive, always make sure to have it included as master (1 or 2 doesn't matter, only master) so that the BIOS knows where to search.\nThank you for your help, maybe those hints can help someone else searching for a solution!?\n", "Q: Samba sharing from ubuntu to win7 I have installed and configured a SAMBA server. So far it works well until I try to log in. When the password box pops up from a win7 machine, I enter the details but it says \"wrong details\". The second user I have set up doesn't have password restrictions, so I can log in directly into that account. The 3rd user I have set up, again tells me to get permission from the network administrator. \nAny help on this getting resolved would be highly appreciated.\n\nA: Try to check the samba logs for more details about the error. Make sure that you have  created the samba user and password correctly and added it the valid_user list. Try to reset the smb passwd for the user which is giving error. \nIn the samba configuration file /etc/samba/smb.conf, look for the folder share parameters.

The monitor is connected by a HDMI cable.

Now it automatically sends the sound through the HDMI port instead. \nI can easily change the appropriate settings in the sound configuration menu: I go to hardware and can select the device I want to use: Analog Surround 4.0 Output, instead of the HDMI one. This works and I can hear sound through my laptop boxes.\nBut I have to change this setting every time again when I plug in my external monitor, when I wake my laptop from the suspended state, etc.\nHow can I make this the default setting, without having to reset it all the time?\nThanks!\n\nA: Ubuntu 10.10 is somehow not really up-to-date which makes it a bit hard to confirm the default pulseaudio installation there. However it may be worth to see if you have the module-switch-on-port-available loaded. \nIn case it is there, then try to disable it by commenting out (#) the following line in your /etc/pulse/default.pa:\n# load-module module-switch-on-port-available\n\nAfter the next restart of the pulseaudio server (e.g. with pulseaudio -k in a terminal) we should no longer switch to a different audio port when this becomes available (e.g. by plugging in your HDMI cable).\n\nA: I have an external monitor connected to my laptop through DisplayPort, and faced this problem in Ubuntu 22.04.

The card will have 'HDMI' or 'DisplayPort' listed in its list of ports.\nSome other ways that I tried:\n\n*\n\n*Disable module-switch-on-port-available as told in the above answer. It works, but a side effect of it is that audio won't be automatically routed to the earphone jack when I plug it in. Need to manually change the setting in pavucontrol. Bluetooth earphones are unaffected by this since it uses a different card.\n\n\n*Setting card profile in ~/.config/pulse/default.pa: set-card-profile alsa_card.pci-0000_07_00.1 off. You can find the symbolic name of a card and its profile using pacmd list-cards.

Synaptic reports my version as 3.2.0.34.37(as my reference)  I read the other day about kernel releases, forgetting to write down the version numbers.  If, in fact, we run behind(Ubuntu) on upgrading our kernel thru the software updater, that would be ok, I just need to get my mind around that.  Further information much appreciated!\n\nIt appears upon reading further on this, that I could install newer kernels, but that there is some risk involved.  I have, in fact, decided to read more on the subject before proceeding.  For instance, as a fail-safe, I could easily remove the kernel if it didn't suit (nvidia, etc) and go back to using my present kernel.  Maybe more bother than it is worth?   Opinions appreciated on this point as well, of course!\n\nA: \nwe run behind(Ubuntu) on upgrading our kernel\n\nSort of.

This is because both of them deal better with broken packages, specially synaptic. so do a sudo apt-get install aptitude synaptic. You can skip this step but I really recommend this one to avoid some very rare package problems like yours.\n\n*Eliminate Wine - \n(If this step does not let you eliminate wine, go to Step 3 then back to 2)\nIf you open synaptic, look for ALL wine packages and purge them. Do not just delete them. If you delete them, the downloaded package will stay. Purge them which shows as Mark for Complete Removal if you right click the package inside Synaptic.\nIf you use aptitude then do a sudo aptitude search wine. For each package that has an i in the beginning column (Which means installed), do a sudo aptitude purge PACKAGE_NAME.\nFor example sudo aptitude purge wine1.5.

It will also install it's dependencies and solve any problems. In there you will see the i386 package also. If this is not selected automatically, select the package manually. Remember to also select winetricks which is needed to install additional packages for wine (.NET, DirectX...)  \nWith Apt: sudo apt-get install wine1.5\nWith Software Center: Just search for Wine. Verify that it is the 1.5 version.  \nOf the 4 I recommend first Synaptic, followed by aptitude and apt. Last is Software Center. Not because there is a package problem in general, but because, for this particular case, Software Center for example, gives little put error if something happens, does not show what package dependencies are being installed and one does not know until the end if everything worked or not.\n\n*Verify that everything is correct by either running winetricks from the Dash or the terminal.

I'm not sure what is the situation with support in other other desktop environments that run on Ubuntu.\n\nA: And an obligatory command-line solution :) In the spirit of this answer: What is the command line equivalent of copying a file to clipboard? I wrote a simple Python script which accepts an URL to a resource as a parameter, downloads the file/page to a temporary location and copies the full file name to the clipboard. All that is left is to open Open File dialog and press Ctrl-V.\nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/python2\n\nimport os, tempfile, argparse, urllib\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Download a file from an URL, save it as a temporary file and copy a link to the file to clipboard\")\nparser.add_argument(\"url\", help=\"The URL of a file to download\")\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nfilename = tempfile.mktemp()\nurllib.urlretrieve(args.url, filename)\nos.system(\"echo %s|xclip  -i -selection clipboard\" % filename)\nprint(\"File %s has been copied to clipboard, now open a File dialog and press Ctrl-V.\" % filename)\n\nTo use, create a directory called bin in your home directory, put the script there (I named it gimme) and set executable permission on it:\nchmod +x ~/bin/gimme\n\nAhh, and you'll need xclip for it to work: \nsudo apt-get install xclip\n\nAnd here's how to use it:\ngimme https://askubuntu.com/questions/228667/upload-file-from-url\nFile /tmp/tmpFXs7_S has been copied to clipboard, now open a File dialog and press Ctrl-V.\n\n\nA: I'm not a Python coder, but I did want something like this that uploaded files.  I tried Sergey's answer, but it didn't work for Facebook chat (possibly elsewhere, that's just where I tried it).\nSo I modified it a bit:\n#!/usr/bin/python2\n\nimport os, tempfile, argparse, urllib, urlparse\nfrom random import randint\n\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Download a file from a URL, save it as a temporary file and copy a link to the file to clipboard\")\nparser.add_argument(\"url\", help=\"The URL of a file to download\")\nargs = parser.parse_args()\npath = urlparse.urlparse(args.url).path\nurlext = os.path.splitext(path)[1]\nfilename = tempfile.mktemp() + urlext\nurllib.urlretrieve(args.url, filename)\nos.system(\"echo %s|xclip  -i -selection clipboard\" % filename)\nprint(\"File %s has been copied to clipboard, now open a File dialog and press Ctrl-V.\" % filename)\n\nNow it adds the file extension to the temp name, so FB identifies the proper mimetype and treats it appropriately.\n", "Q: sudo command and how to auto get password I got a problem that: \nI have a file .sh \n    #!/bin/bash \n\nvar=$(zenity --forms --title=\"Tắt giờ vợ yêu nhé\" \\\n    --text=\"Vợ muốn tắt máy sau bao nhiêu phút nữa\" \\\n    --separator=\",\" \\\n    --add-entry=\"Vợ điền số vào đây\")\ncase $? in\n    0)  sudo shutdown -h $var           \n    ;;\n    1)\n        exit 0;;\n    -1)\n        echo \"An unexpected error has occurred.\"\n    ;;\nesac\n\nHow can sudo command autofill the password from echo command or a file.\nI read about sudo -S options, but i dont know how it works. \nAnyone can give an example about it! \nThanks guys\n\nA: It's better to change sudo rules instead storing clear password in a text file :\nCreate a new file like /etc/sudoers.d/script_rights and push \n%user ALL = NOPASSWD:/sbin/shutdown\n\nwhere user is the user allow to run the script.sh. Then the script will not ask the password to run the shutdown command.\n\nA: Is not very secure, just to say that before I give the answer, since somebody could just open the file and see the password but here is how:\nSuppose we want to execute the command sudo shutdown -h 1 but we do not want to type in the password. We would do it like this:\necho PASSWORD | sudo -S shutdown -h1\nFor example, if my password were x then it would look something like this:\necho x | sudo -S shutdown -h1\nAnother example is, if I wanted to do an apt-get update then upgrade without entering any password. I would do this:\necho x | sudo -S apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nThe first sudo (The one with the -S parameter) will grab the password from the standard input, in this case, the keyboard in the terminal. It will then hold the password for the remaining terminal session. Since in this session I am executing 2 apt-get commands, one with update and the other with upgrade, there is no need to type the password again for the second apt-get since the password is active for the session in use. So the rest of the sudo commands will not need to be provided another password until the session closes (Until you close the terminal or script using the password ends).\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 dual boot using windows 7 mbr I'm doing this manually. Chose to not use easybcd. Everythings on new setup so I can reformat as many times as I need to get it right. Installed win7 first, set up partitions, installed ubuntu 12.04, inadvertently overwrote windows mbr with grub, repaired windows mbr, created extra partition for boot/grub, reinstalled ubuntu 12.04 this time using correct partitions, downloaded ext2fsd so windows can see grub partition, used copy function to \"copy\" boot.img file from grub folder, pasted direct to c drive, using windows bcdedit I created the entry to connect my boot.img (copy) which is in windows c drive, now the windows boot manager gives me the options of either win7 or ubuntu...great except that the ubuntu choice gets me nowhere. Message is \"the selected entry could not be loaded...\" and gives file \\ubuntu.pbr and status 0xc000000f. I'm considering deleting the bcd entry, then creating a \"shortcut\" of the boot.img in windows c drive, then back to bcdedit to create the entry pointing to the shortcut.\nIs this what I should do? please don't tell me to override windows mbr with the grub install function or point to easybcd (I may have to go that route anyway)\nthank you, thank you, thank you...from the bottom of my somewhat past newbie heart.  xana40\n\nA: I had nearly the same problem. In my case I solved it using my laptop's native bootloader (I use ASUS) Before any system starts to boot I press Esc and get something like hardware bootloader which is no related to Windows or GRUB. I have a choise between 'Ubuntu boot loader' , 'Windows loader' , 'Windows recovery' , 'Boot from CD' , etc. If I choose Ubuntu I got GRUB loading, If windows, then Windows boot manager. I don't know if it will work on your laptop. Some laptops instead of Esc use F1, F2, F4, F8, F10, F11 or F12.\n", "Q: How to use the new feature of remote login in ubuntu 12.10? Recently i have upgraded ubuntu 12.04 to 12.10. I saw a new feature of remote login under the login page. How can i use that remote login? I have got the Ubuntu live account. Searched on internet but the info was not useful.\n\nA: The link by @mikewhatever is correct. But basically you have to use the Help Question Mark icon in the remote login box first to set up your remote link(s). This opens Firefox in a guest session but it takes you directly to the login (use your Ubuntu One credentials) after which you can set up the settings needed to RDP to another machine. When you're all done, log out and close Firefox. You'll then be taken back to the computer's login screen where you can choose the Remote Login, use your Ubuntu One credentials to log in, and this time you'll see the RDP client(s) you set up earlier. Log in to your chosen machine. After that, any Ubuntu 12.10 machine you use in this way will let you log in to any of the remote machines you set up earlier without having to log in to the local machine because the RDP settings are stored on Ubuntu's servers.\n", "Q: What's the best Office Suite for 12.10, especially with respect to formatting and equation editing tools? I've tried running MS Office through wine but it failed to install correctly. As for LibreOffice it has some limitations when it comes to writing equations which is important for me seeing how I'm a training to become a mathematician next year. I'll also need high-level formatting tools. Which office suite would best suit my needs taking into consideration the aforementioned problems/requirements?\n\nA: On my Ubuntu 12.10, I installed Microsoft Office 2007 normally through the latest version of wine.\nTry installing it and then try installing Microsoft Office again.\nIn a terminal type: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa followed by sudo apt-get update and finally sudo apt-get install wine1.5\nTry installing Office again.\nIf a normal install fails, try installing office through Winetricks.\n\nA: Use Kingsoft Ofiice (includes word, spreadsheet & presentation)\n\nA: The best Office Suite on Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions too) is LibreOffice. It gets a \"Math\" module for editing equations (LibreOffice Math). If your not satisfied, you get alternatives such as Apache OpenOffice (which is very close of LibreOffice) and eventually the Calligra Suite that may integrate well with the KMath KDE software.\n\nA: For formulas, the best tool is probably LaTeX. Actually nearly all scientific publications are written with LaTeX, and the excellent typesetting of formulas is one of the reasons. Nevertheless, it's wygiwyw, so formatting is tedious. On the other hand, if one has a template done, one doesn't have to care about formatting any more, no matter how long the document gets. \nThere is also a scrip for the command line, called latexit, that renders a formula passed to it as argument into a graphic file. \n", "Q: Why does my MySQL remote-connection fail (VLAN)? Again I have a problem with my special friend MySQL :D\nI have got two servers - a database-server and a web-server - which are connected via VLAN.\nNow I want the web-server to have remote access to the database-server's MySQL. So I created the user user in mysql.user.\nuser's Host is xxx.yyy.zzz.9 which is the internal IP-address of the web-server.\nxxx.yyy.zzz.0 is the network. I also created user with Host % .\nAs long as I use MySQL on the database-server logging in as user, everything works fine. But trying to log in as user from xxx.yyy.zzz.9 using\nmysql -h xxx.yyy.zzz.8 -u user -p\n\n(where xxx.yyy.zzz.8 is the database-server's internal IP), I get\nERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'xxx.yyy.zzz.8' (110)  \n\nSo I tried to activate Bind-Address in the my.cnf file. Well, if I use xxx.yyy.zzz.8, nothing changes. But if I try xxx.yyy.zzz.9 and try to restart MySQL, I get\nmysql stop/waiting\nstart: Job failed to start\n\nI checked the log files and found - nothing. The database-server's MySQL doesn't even register, that the web-server tries to connect remotely.\nMy idea is that maybe I didn't configure the VLAN properly, even though I asked someone who actually knows such stuff and he told me I did everything right.\nWhat I wrote in /etc/networking/interfaces is:\n#The VLAN\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress xxx.yyy.zzz..8\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork xxx.yyy.zzz.0\nbroadcast xxx.yyy.zzz.255\nmtu 1500\n\nifconfig returns\neth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  \n          inet addr:xxx.yyy.zzz.8  Bcast:xxx.yyy.zzz.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:241146 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:9765 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:17825995 (17.8 MB)  TX bytes:566602 (566.6 KB)\n          Memory:fb900000-fb920000 \n\nfor the eth1, what is, what I configured.

It refused every incoming MySQL request.\nI reconfigured it via Plesk, allowing it to let MySQL requests to go through. I don't know if I could also have done it in the shell, but deactivating it definitely helped! Yet I think that might be kind of dangerous.\n\nA: Mysql is listening by default only on loopback interface. So even with a user with right privilege, you will be unable to access remotely on your mysql server. Additionnaly, the bind-address option in not dedicated to give access on some host, but to specify the interface to listen.\nSo first check your mysql is listening on loopback interface\nnetstat -tnl | grep 3306\n\nYou will see something like that\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:3306          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN\n\nIf right, you have to change mysql configuration file\nsudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf\n\nThen search for the line :\nbind-address = 127.0.0.1\n\nThen replace 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0. You will obtain the line :\nbind-address = 0.0.0.0\n\nRestart Mysql to take effect\n/etc/init.d/mysql restart\n\nEnd check that Mysql is listening on all interfaces\nnetstat -tnl | grep 3306\n\nYou should see :\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:3306          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN\n\n", "Q: Can I install an Ubuntu app from remote laptop? Is their a way to push/send and ubuntu-app/deb-file to be install on my Ubuntu laptop?\nUsecase...\nLaptop 1.\nI find an app, I need to install!\nBut I´am not at home.\nI just push it to my other laptop to be install..\nLaptop 2.\nI am now at home.\nMy laptop 2 view an dialog asking to install the app I send from laptop 1.\nCan this be do?.. SSH?\nQuestion-update\nCan it be done so it open Ubuntu Software Center and then laptop2-user only need to write their password and press ok? for non-tec users.. like my father...\n\nA: Yes this can be done. You can download the .deb file when you are at laptop 1, use the SSH file system (sshfs) to connect to your second laptop, then just copy from one to the other in Nautilus or whatever file browser you use. This can also be done if you installed the software on laptop 1 and the .deb is still in the cache folder (/var/cache/apt/archives). Just copy it from there to laptop 2 if you have ssh access to it, again using sshfs.\nTo use sshfs, it is similar to ssh in some regards. Switch -p for non-standard port numbers is just the same as ssh, otherwise the standard port 22 is used. Also, -C for compression over slow connections works.\nImagine Joe Bloggs has an account on both laptops. He has downloaded a .deb to laptop 1. He can copy it to laptop 2 using sshfs, then install this file when he gets home. Sitting at laptop 1 he has to do the following:\nMake an empty folder in his home directory of laptop 1, perhaps called copies.\nType at the terminal: sshfs [-p oddportnumber] -C joebloggs@internetaddressoflaptop2: ~/copies\n(Note the colon at the end of the laptop 2 address, and the space between that and the tilde.)\nThis mounts the home directory of joebloggs on laptop 2 inside the folder called copies on laptop 1 using ssh over the Internet.\nNow copy the .deb file into the folder called \"copies\" in laptop 1 and it is actually copying via ssh to the home folder in laptop 2.\nTo unmount you have to type fusermount -u ~/copies\nI hope this is what you were looking for.\n", "Q: Sitronix ST9RM01 touchscreen not working I have a Sitronix ST9RM01 touchscreen that I'm trying to get working with Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe touchscreen is apparently recognized by Linux and X - the hid_multitouch module is loaded, and lsinput and xinput both list the touchscreen as an input device - but touching the screen does absolutely nothing, and xinput test shows no events.\nThe same touchscreen works just fine in Windows.\nHow can I troubleshoot from here?

It appears to me that both these methods allow for elaborate customization of the image while allowing the user to enter their own end-user details (time zone, username, password, etc...).\n\nA: An OEM version is for manufactures of computers (system 76 for example) whereas the custom Ubuntu image is made so you \"personalize\" an image. If I was you, I would just do custom image.\n\nA: The OEM Install\n\n\n*\n\n*The OEM install allows machine by machine customization.\n\n*It does not create an ISO image, but customizes a single machine.\n\n*Customization is done at the stage of installation.\n\n\nAdvantages\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not require a custom iso.\n\n*Each machines can have different customization.\n\n*Suitable for small number of customized machines, each with its own\nset of customization.\n\n*Also suitable for uncustomized machines where user gets to setup her\nown settings.\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\n\n*\n\n*If each machine needs to be customized the same way, they still have\nto be done individually at the time of install and thus, will take\nlonger.\n\n*You will need some other tools to create an iso image.\n\n\nCustom Ubuntu Image\n\n\n*\n\n*On the other hand custom Ubuntu Image allows making a single\ncustomized iso.\n\n*Copy it in multiple CD/DVD/USB\n\n*Deploy the same image in multiple machines quickly.\nAdvantages\n\n\n*\n\n*Suitable for large volume deployment of identically customized\nmachines.\n\n\nDisadvantage\n\n\n*\n\n*Requires an extra step of creating and testing a custom iso\nimage.

I tried most of the online tutorials, and it failed.\nThe code I tried was this:\nusermod -l newusername -m -d /home/newusername oldusername\n\nBut the output is:\ncannot lock /etc/passwd; try again later.\n\nHow can I fix the issue and change the folder to newusername and expect all the applications to work as before?\n\nA: Login with your currentusername, open a terminal and type:\nsudo passwd root\n\nEnter a password for the root account, then logout, press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to open a text console, login as root (username: root, password: \"the one you typed above\") and run:\nusermod -l newusername -m -d /home/newusername currentusername\nexit\n\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F7 to return to graphic console and login as newusername.\nTo change the user's display name (the one that appears at the login screen), go to System Settings -> User Accounts then click the display name on the right-hand side of the dialog.\n\n\nA: You need to do this from recovery mode.\nReboot, choose recovery mode, and then drop to a root console and type the command there. Then reboot again as normal.\n\nA: The first simple solution that you can do is to create a new user with the right username that you want and add it to the administrator group: /etc/sudoers\nother way, you can do that with your old username (I tested it on fedora):\n# usermod -l new-username old-unername\n\n\nA: I would create a new account, and copy all of your files across. This is probably the most idiot-proof method.\n\nA: Changing usernames will cause unavoidable problems. A lot of programs will try to read and write data from the old directory that's no longer there.  Creating a new account and copying over all the old folders seems like a good idea.  I believe there are other problems.\nBut this answers the question where the previous comments did not help me.\nSimply logging back in as as root may not work because my old username had active processes. So I did like other's have said and rebooted into recovery mode.  But then I got the error message the original poster mentions.  As discovered here this is because the drive is read only in recovery mode so you have to make it read-write. \nSummary fix:\nsudo passwd root # assign a password\nreboot  # into recovery mode and log in as root\n\nHold shift during boot if your grub menu is not set to show. \nLog in as root and get to shell.\nmount -o remount,rw /  # make the disk writable\nusermod -l <newname> -d /home/<newname> -m <oldname>\npasswd -l root   #  deactivate the root password\nreboot\n\nYour old username will be the login name, but it will still let you in.  To correct it, edit the file with the command below and look for the line that has your new and old username on the same line and change the old one to the new one:\nsudo nano /etc/passwd\n\nAs others have said in other places, expect problems when changing your username as many programs will try to do things like find or store application data in your old username's folder which isn't there anymore.\n", "Q: Is plugin needed for php code completion in Geany?

Press F12 (or whatever key that takes your computer to the BIOS settings) and check your startup/boot alternatives.\n\nA: For some reason i don't know, looks like your MBR(Master Boot Record) has changed and replaced GRUB with Windows.\nThere are a few steps you can follow to recover the ability to boot Ubuntu again.\n1) You need a DVD or a USB stick with Ubuntu into it. Boot the laptop from it. Choose to run, not to install Ubuntu. \n2) Once there, check if all your data is there. Open Nautilus, the file explorer and look for you partitions.\n3) Next open Terminal and run this command: sudo fdisk -l. It will show all available Hard Disks and partitions in you laptop.

I know that all three mentioned office apps are based on OpenOffice.org . I previously used Libreoffice but I had troubles with editing PDFs and importing/exproting MS Office documents sometimes.

I haven't used Lotus Symphony and I'm wondering if it can edit PDFs and how compactible is it with MS Office\nCould anyone please help me to make a choise.\n\nA: Lotus Symphony as well as Star Office are discontinued, so LibreOffice is a clear winner here, surpassing even OpenOffice it has been forked from.\nLong story short - Lotus Symphony and Star Office were either legacy or not so actively developed software while OpenOffice remained the main player. Then a group of former OpenOffice developers along with new newly recruited developers forked OpenOffice and called their project LibreOffice. Funny thing is within a year LibreOffice team has done more improvements within a year than OpenOffice has in 5 years and it still keeps the high development/code cleanup pace.\n", "Q: lenovo b570e release recommendation I'm wondering what release is more stable in terms of hardware drivers support for a Lenovo B570e , 12.10 or 12.04 ? \nI have a 64 bit system but I see on the website the recommended version is  32bits. \nI'm  a little bit confused, actually what I need to know is which one is better for hardware components support. \n\nA: I can't speak specifically about the Lenovo b570e. But I do see it listed as being certified for Ubuntu 12.04, and community members have listed it as working with 12.04. Presumably it'll work just as well, if not better with 12.10.\nAll Ubuntu releases should be fit for use. Normal releases are supported for 18 months. LTS releases for 5 years.\nNew hardware support gets backported to LTS releases, in point releases. The first point release after Ubuntu 12.10 (12.04.2) should support everything that 12.10 did. But that's only coming out at the end of January. So until then, 12.10 will support hardware that 12.04 doesn't.\n\nA: I have a four-week old Lenovo z580 and I run 12.10 64bit.\nTo answer your questions\n\n\n*\n\n*Though 32 bit is the recommended version, you can perfectly install the 64bit version. It works fine.\n\n*Both 12.10 and 12.04 are fairly steady in terms of hardware support. That is, let me be precise, all your hardware will work out of the box, but if you have nvidia optimus (which means you have a graphical processor on your normal processor and one separately), this will not work out of the box. Check bumblebee for that. All other hardware should work fine both on 12.04 en 12.10.\n\n*One thing you might want to take into account is whether or not you have UEFI booting (if your hardware is new, you might have UEFI). You can check it by holding F2 on boot and going through the menu. From what I know, 12.10 is a signed version (read this post) and 12.04 is not.\n\n*The other thing to take into account is whether or not you want to work on an LTS version (as you indicate yourself). That is a personal choice.\nAll in all, I think 12.10 is the way to go for you. One piece of advice based on my experience: take your time to install ubuntu. I had to play with the boot options in my 'BIOS'. Also, think your partitioning scheme through in advance to avoid unnecessary work.\nGood luck.\n\nA: I have Lenovo b570e :D I have 4GB ram running 12.10 64bit. No hardware problems. So go on. Don't forget to set EFI boot partition about 200MB before / mount point, because we have EFI/UEFI. Aha and when you are about to install from eg.USB just set it in BIOS then save it and let it go, the secure boot will disable automatically, But if you eg. wanna check if usb or dvd is set as first in boot order and you'll find it is and exit bios with \"discard settings\" the secure boot will not disable and you will find that you cannot set the EFI boot partition.\nI have installed like 20 times :/ before i found out why i can't set efi boot partition, and without it after you install system will not boot. If you reinstall you have to set new efi boot partition even if you already have. Hope you understood my  writings :) Please visit my blog www.ubuntufixer.blogspot.com you'll find there lots of tweaks for Ubuntu and mint. Good luck.\n", "Q: Alternative shades $PATH? I've install jdk now with this reference. According to that I have to add jdk directory to PATH variable and add an alternative via update-alternatives. I've done that and everything is fine. But there is one thing that is not clear for me: when I type which java bash returns only /usr/bin/java but tells nothing about usr/bin/jvm/java-6-oracle/bin despite this folder is in the PATH variable and as I see, bash should have find java also there and mention it in the output. Can anybody explain why there's such a \"shade\"?\nThank you.\n\nA: /usr/bin/java is actually a symlink to /etc/alternatives/java, which is itself a symlink to the actual java binary.  The update-alternatives script changes where /etc/alternatives/java is linked to.  By running update-alternatives, /usr/bin/java will end up symlinked to /usr/bin/jvm/java-6-oracle/bin/java.\nThe reason which java returns /usr/bin/java is that /usr/bin is on your PATH before /usr/bin/jvm/java-6-oracle/bin.  If you run which -a java, it should show you both /usr/bin/java and /usr/bin/jvm/java-6-oracle/bin/java.\n", "Q: Samba 3.6 and Samba4 I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 and samba 3.6 (the version of samba that is installed for Ubuntu 12.10, by default).

This may give you some troubles because most Linux distributions provide ODBC drivers compiled against unixODBC. This is another driver manager not supported by MySQL Workbench so you won’t be able to use those drivers unless you compile them against iODBC. Here’s what you should do.\nMake sure that you have iODBC installed. If you are using Debian, Ubuntu or another Debian based distro, type this command in your terminal:\n$> sudo apt-get install iodbc libiodbc2-dev libpq-dev libssl-dev\nFor RPM based distros (RedHat, Fedora, etc.) type this command instead of the previous one:\n$> sudo yum install iodbc iodbc-dev libpqxx-devel openssl-devel\nNow we need to install the PostgreSQL ODBC drivers.\nDownload the psqlODBC source tarball from here.

If you don't have one anymore, you can prepare an USB stick with this process http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\n\n*Boot with the live USB or CD, choose \"try ubuntu without install it\".\n\n\nOnce ready, open terminal and type the following commands\nsudo -s\nfdisk -l\n\nTry now to identify the partition where your Ubuntu is installed. Usually, the partition is named /dev/sdax, where x is the number of the partition. By example, my hard drive has \n/dev/sda3           20923       23507    20755980   83  Linux\n\nYou see 83 Linux that's mean the partition /dev/sda3 is formated under Linux (ext4). If you have several Linux partition, you will need probably try the steps bellow several time until you find the partition where Ubuntu is installed.\nNow mount the partition like that\nmount /dev/sda3 /mnt\n\nCheck if it's the right partition\nls /mnt/etc/fstab\n\nIf the file exist, you have probably mounted the right partition. Now we will try to fix the Ubuntu installed.\nmount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nmount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nmount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\nchroot /mnt\napt-get -f install\napt-get clean\n\nIf updates was not complete before, the process should be started again and finish the updates. If these steps doesn't fix your issue, check also if you don't have space issue with the following command when your linux partition stills mounted.\ndf -h\n\nIn last resort, you can try to place the few last line of the /mnt/var/log/syslog file content, this may help to identify where is the issue.\nGood luck.\n\nA: I also got this error when trying to install 12.04 LTS from a USB stick.

I wanted to 'try again' since one of them didn't install correctly and the other installed differently, but it worked. \nI was getting frustrated with the GRUB menu because it was really sloppy (There were two Windows options - one with the Windows bootloader to go into Ubuntu, and two different versions of Ubuntu from the first install for some reason and memtest, etc.).\nIn my attempts at getting rid Ubuntu to do a fresh installation, I went ahead and deleted the partitions that weren't swap or main via Windows 7. As I said, I am a noob.\nNow, even though I though I completely got rid of Ubuntu, including the GRUB menu, when I boot my PC I am brought directly to GRUB Rescue.

Thanks\n\nA: What you can do is a classic installation of Ubuntu on your second HDD. If you do not know how to do, search it on Ask Ubuntu. There is obviously a link for that on this website. Otherwise, search it on the rest of the Internet.\nAfter that, you have to ensure that the computer will boot on this install of Ubuntu. When you switch on your computer, it looks at the boot devices list (CD or DVD burner, Hard Drive Disks, floppy it you still get one...). On each boot device, it will look if there is something to boot on. The computer will use the first boot device where he finds something bootable and will boot on the bootable thing of the boot device. So what you have to do is placing your new HDD before your current one in the list in order to boot on Ubuntu instead of your old Windows 7 (otherwise it will boot on the Windows 7 of your current HDD because he is before your new HDD and its Ubuntu in the list). For this, you have to go into your computer's BIOS or UEFI (I do not know what you have) to modify the list of boot devices.

I have a Dell Inspiron 5230 with Intel 4000 onboard graphics.\n\nA: Your question appears similar to this one although you mention you have an Intel GPU (it could be unrelated).\nBasically, it looks like LightDM (the default greeter/login screen) can sometimes get a bit confused if you've installed other packages or something has gone wrong with its configuration.\nHere is a relevant bug report, though possibly for a different version:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/lightdm/+bug/971891\nI think the best (least destructive) advice there is the following:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure unity-greeter\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nHopefully that should fix it!\nYou could also make sure that the ubuntu-desktop metapackage is installed.\nSome of the advice in that other question seems suspect to me, either because it involves installing random PPAs or it simply doesn't apply to people with Intel graphics.\n\nA: It has absolutely nothing to do with the GPU.

Verify that your main SSD is on the correct port before you try anything.\n\nA: I gave this same answer here. If this situation applies to you, these seem good workarounds.\nFor Intel integrated graphics on Core processors, it seems that lightdm is the culprit and workarounds are add a delay in rc.local or install and use gdm. Launchpad seems to think that lightdm is too fast at querying for a display and people are saying SSDs can contribute to this race condition. Not sure if this would help you. \n\nA: Try going into system settings, and under the \"Additional Drivers\" section, click on that. Their might possibly be an available driver for the card. I would use the recommended driver if any. That makes my graphics really smooth.

It can grab a TTY session and display it for use in a VNC window. Install it via apt:\nsudo apt-get install linuxvnc\n\nOnce that is done, fire it up: (root access is required to grab TTYs)\nsudo linuxvnc X\n\nWhere 'X' is the TTY # you want to grab. You could do this in a SSH session if you don't have physical access to the server. linuxvnc should indicate that it's listening on port 5900. Now connect with a VNC Viewer of your choice.\n\nA: Install SSH server on the Ubuntu machine, then use an SSH client on Windows or Mac. \nsudo install ssh\n\nTo connect from Mac I believe you may be able to use a command line client:\nssh my.ubuntu.box -u myusername\n\nTo connect from Windows you can use a GUI client, such as PuTTY.\n(if you want to connect to an existing TTY, e.q. to start a session on the Ubuntu box locally, then walk to your Windows machine and connect to the same session from there then you need to use screen command in combination with SSH access.

I wanted to have Ubuntu with full disk encryption on one big partition, and Windows on a small one. In 12.04, only the Server Edition installer has full disk encryption, so I used that and then installed ubuntu-desktop. When it asked for the size, I reduced it from ~999GB to ~750gb. Now after the install, on both gparted and disk utility I see /dev/sda2 taking ~931GB, and nothing unallocated, so I can't create a partition for windows.\nI got the size right, because when I right-click inside a folder, then hit 'properties', I see Free space: ~690GB (I don't know why it's not ~750GB, but at least it's not >900). The command df -h shows the same.\nSo what can I do? Normally I would just resize a partition with gparted to create unallocated space, then create the partition. But here I have two problems: gparted does not seem to be showing the correct values, and also it says it does not support LUKS so I'm afraid it will mess things up.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: On the sizes:\n\n1 GB  = 109 B = 10003 B = 1,000,000,000 B\n1 GiB = 230 B = 10243 B = 1,073,741,824 B\n\n931 GiB is 999 GB\n698 GiB is 750 GB\n\nDisks report in GB.\nGParted report in GiB.\ndf -H report in GB.\ndf -h report in GiB.\ndf -BG report in GiB.\nlsblk report in GiB.\nAlso; when it comes to df versus the other mentioned. \nGParted, Disks, lsblk reports size calculated from core HDD. \ndf, Nautilus etc. reports actual usable space within the file system.

I've got some some home movies that look great, but my video camera doesn't have one of those fancy new stabilizers. Is there extant end-user software (preferably FLOSS) I could use to removing the shaking?\n\nA: Transcode\nTranscode is no longer maintained and was removed from Ubuntu releases 18.04 and newer.

Is it okay to have a python program checking something every second?\nThanks!\n\nA: Just to make sure that the Gtk way is also present in an answer:\nThe equivalent of \ngtk.timeout_add(PING_FREQUENCY * 1000, self.doWork)\n\nin gobject introspection (PyGI) is:\nfrom gi.repository import GLib\nGLib.timeout_add(PING_FREQUENCY * 1000, self.doWork)\n\nHowever, when checking something regularly every x seconds, you should use \nGLib.timeout_add_seconds(PING_FREQUENCY, self.doWork)\n\nThis allows the Glib to group timers and therefore save power, which is important for mobile devices. From the documentation:\n\nThe grouping of timers to fire at the same time results in a more\n  power and CPU efficient behavior so if your timer is in multiples of\n  seconds and you don't require the first timer exactly one second from\n  now, the use of glib.timeout_add_seconds() is preferred over\n  glib.timeout_add().\n\n\nA: It is better to ask one question per... err... question.\nPython's standard library has threading module which has a Timer class which does exactly what you need. Documentation.\nRegarding push vs pull - it is definitely better when your application receives a notification when something happens (push) instead of checking if something happened every second (pull) - \"are we there yet? are we there yet? are we there yet?..\" - because it allows your app to just sleep and do nothing until it's notified, as opposed to doing the same repeating check every second. The thing is, however, that for some types of activities it may be tricky to get a notification, so it depends on the nature of your application. Doing checks too often is also bad for battery life and other stuff. \n", "Q: Autologin not working on GDM with Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04 I would like to know how to make GDM to autologin with the default (and only) account.

This should be a good starting point to figure out, how exactly you would want to contribute.\n\nA: As far as knowing how to answer questions here, hang around for a little while and you will get to know not only the common solutions to common problems, but you will get a better understanding of how the problem solving process works.  To start with, use Google to find solutions to questions asked and compare them to answers that are given by others.  If it turns out that your research suggests a better answer than those already given then write an answer (not just a link) with the information.  Links to the information you found are fine, as long as you write up the answer yourself as well. (Links may disappear, leaving only your work for others that may come along.)\n", "Q: What package is a tool to check hard drive health I have seen it before... some kind of system information tool which among other things was giving out some diagnostic info about my hard drives... like number off r/w errors,  bad sectors etc. Im on Bodhi linux now which is ubuntu based and doesnt have anything like this installed.

Dual boot \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat’s the difference between Wubi and a regular installation? \n\nIs there any way to install Ubuntu on NTFS?\nBecause my files are in that drive, I wan't to dual boot between Win7 and XP.\n\nA: Easiest is way is to install via WUBI, refer to Installing ubuntu with windows 8\nOtherwise, it is possible for ubuntu to be installed on its own partition, while sparing your NTFS partition(as long as you have the space) and even access it from ubuntu if needed.\n\nA: You would need to partition the disk in any case, so you may as well format the partition(s) for Ubuntu as normal (ext4 etc) and your NTFS data files will be accessible from within Ubuntu, but Windows won't see your Ubuntu data so you should consider where to store things that may need to be accessible from both i.e. put it on the NTFS (Windows) partition.\nThe installer will do the partitioning for you and give you dual boot if you choose the \"Install alongside Windows\" option.\n\nA: \nIs there any way to install Ubuntu on NTFS ? \n\nNTFS does not understand Linux permissions so that is a no.\n\nAlternative\n\nIt is fairly easy to create a new partition with a Windows program like Partition Magic that you then can use for Ubuntu.

When the system did boot, it seemed to work. If you do manage to boot, you should be able to trigger the problem with command: /lib/udev/ata_id --export /dev/sr0. Beware, if that truly is the problem, your system will freeze.\nThe command will send an ATAPI command to the optical drive. The problem is, the SATA controller (ASM1061 in your case) does not support these ATAPI commands, resulting in a frozen system.\nThere are two solutions to the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the file /lib/udev/rules.d/60-persistent-storage.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/60-persistent-storage.rules so that edits are not overwritten from updates.\nRemove the warning message at the top about not editing the file.\nFind the line containing word \"ATAPI\".\nComment out the next line.\nThis way, udev will not touch ATAPI.\nSave and run the command update-initramfs -u to finalize the changes.\n\n*Change the SATA port for the optical drive. I used this method, as booting any Linux other than one with the modified udev rule results in freeze otherwise.\nIn my case, the motherboard is ASRock Z77 Extreme4 with the same ASMedia ASM1061 chip for two SATA3 ports. I had a DVD drive in one of them and got the error. Switched the DVD drive to a SATA port handled by the Z77 chip and everything works.\n\nA: In my case I had to unplug my DVD ROM drive as it was in one of the SATA ports that was apparently causing the problem. But never the less works in Windows...\nIt may have also helped setting nouveau.modeset=0 at the end of the linux line in the pre boot settings as well as I had also been getting errors related to that.

How I can make my Ubuntu 12.10 HP laptop and make the IP address a static IP address?\n\nA: The default content of /etc/network/interfaces is\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nIf you removed those lines I imagine the lack of a loopback network might well do bad things to linux.\nYou can configure a static IP using the NetworkManager GUI (Network Icon->Network Settings->(Connection)->IPv4 Settings). If you want to do it manually, the syntax you describe appears correct (see man interfaces for more details).\nTypically on a small network it is easier to set up a static IP by leaving the computer to use DHCP and configuring the router to assign a specific IP address based on the computer's MAC address (which the router will probably tell you, and if not can be found with ifconfig (\"HWaddr\") or lshw -c network (\"serial\")).\n", "Q: How can I configure Postfix to send all email through my Gmail account?

To be clear: I'm not searching for other methods of virtualization or a different way to install my vm, I just want X forwarding fixed.\n\nA: Check to see if forwarding is disabled:\ngrep Forwarding /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nMore info on this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding\n", "Q: Two users sharing the same computer I need to share my pc with a friend of mine living in India.\nHis pc is a p4 and he needs a bit of horsepower for calculation.\nSince I have an i5 I thought to let him vnc and use it but this would not allow me to use the computer at the same time.\nIs there a way to use the computer at the same time with different users?\nI've read Xorg is able to do this but I am not sure is the best solution nor I can implement it.\nWe have Ubuntu 12.04 64bit on the i5 side and Ubuntu 12.04 32bit on the p4 side.\nThank you for your kind help.\n\nA: It could be easiest to use the built-in methods, already available. If you both have X running, configure SSH on the i5 side. Make sure you have SSH configured with\nX11Forward yes\n\nYou may need to open port 22 on the router that provides the network on the i5 side, so that the p4 side can connect. When the SSH server is accessible on the Internet, in short time it will get hammered with people attempting to brute-force their way into the machine; so, be sure to install and configure a method to prevent brute force attacks, like DenyHosts or fail2ban.\nYou may wish to look in your router to see which kind of dynamic DNS it might be able to use and then set up dynamic DNS so that the p4 side can SSH to you by name. (There is also software that could this, and we could devise some hackish methods too, below.) Otherwise, of course, the p4 side would need to know your current IP address.\nFor the p4 side to connect via SSH with X and compression:\nssh -X -C username@hostname-or-ip-address\n\nFor the p4 side to use X applications on the i5 side, just type a command.\nxman\n\nThen xman will run on the i5 side, but display on the p4 side.\nOf course, a hopefully obvious requirement for the i5 side is that the i5 side needs to create a user account for the p4 user (adduser).\nAlternatively, there is something more like the VNC you mentioned, NX.\nThere is a commercial version that is free for Linux, from NoMachine,\nand there is an open-source version, freenx. With NX, users connect via SSH, and the end user gets a display showing the whole desktop, like VNC or RDP.\nPersonally, I use NX from NoMachine. My ISP changes my IP address once weekly. I did not want to pay for dynamic DNS, and I did not want to set up dynamic DNS for myself. So, I devised a way to send myself my external IP address once daily (via a script run from cron). First I set up the system to send mail using ssmtp, software made just to send mail. Then I run the script once a day via cron (/etc/cron.daily/ip.sh):\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nIP_FILE=/tmp/external-ip-address\nCURRENT_IP=$(lynx --dump http://checkip.dyndns.org/)\nEMAIL_ADDR=me@mydomain.com\n\nif [ -f $IP_FILE ]; then\n    KNOWN_IP=$(cat $IP_FILE)\nelse\n    KNOWN_IP=\nfi\n\nif [ \"$CURRENT_IP\" != \"$KNOWN_IP\" ]; then\n    echo $CURRENT_IP > $IP_FILE\n    mailx -s \"External IP Address\" $EMAIL_ADDR < $IP_FILE\nfi\n\nThe script requires lynx, bash, and mailx (heirloom-mailx). Though it has nothing to do with crunching numbers, the remote user could also use sshfs to mount the home directory on the i5 side. It is a very convenient way to use X to manage remote files.\n\nA: You can install xrdp (sudo apt-get install xrdp) on the i5 side and Remmina (available from Software Center) on the P4 side. This will make him have access to your machine desktop.\nI recommend you to set up a new user for him so you won't have problems of the kind \"Firefox is already running on this machine...\" and your files will be protected and separated from his ones.\nTo make the connection you will need to open the port corresponding to the connection type you choose in Reminna. I recommend you to use RDP with SSH tunneling (You can configure Reminna to do this alone) and open SSH port (22) on your machine. The security problem of opening this port is to consider and you should install something to block brute force attacks (like fail2ban - in software center too) and only allow ssh connections with ssh-keys, no password and no root login - configurable in /etc/sshd_config).

I'd like to get the community's advice on setting up such an array as there appears to be a plethora of possible configurations.\nSpecifically, I'll be using the workstation for image analysis (i.e., typical file sizes from several hundred MB-several GB), so if there are optimizations that can be made for such purposes that would be great.\nCheers\n\nA: I don't remember exactly what resources I followed when setting up my RAID on my server, but I think this article was the main point of information. Some important things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use mdadm and not dmraid.\n\n*Use /dev/disk/by-id/ paths to point at the disks, instead of /dev/sda etc… It's easier to map them to the physical devices, in case you need to replace a disk or such.\n\n*Be patient. At first I thought my RAID would be ready after the 5 hours initial setup time. Then it took another day to rebuild itself and actually be ready. (4x2TB)\n\n*Use a separate disk/partition/RAID for primary OS installs. It's easier to manage everything if you keep the large data RAID separate from primary OS and its data. Much easier to recover a small OS disk, than rebuild a huge multi-terabyte array, if something goes bad on the OS side.\n\n\nA: With RAID10 in the given situation I see only two variables candidate for optimization:\n\n\n*\n\n*Chunk size\nSet it to something larger than the default of 512KiB to minimize the overhead for linear reads/writes of large files. You should try it on a small partition on your machine to see what gives the best performance, e.g. 1MB, 2MB, 5MB, 10MB...\n\n*Near vs Far layout\ncomparable to RAID1+0 vs RAID0+1. Far is a bit faster as the performance for reading is more like RAID0. Yet a Near layout is the default because it has a slightly higher chance of surviving the unlikely event that all mirrored disks are broken (some probability math here). Some more visual idea of the differens is below, happily stolen from SLES mdadm documentation:\nNear looks like\nsda1 sdb1 sdc1 sdd1\n  0    0    1    1\n  2    2    3    3\n  4    4    5    5\n\nFar looks like\nsda1 sdb1 sdc1 sdd1\n  0    1    2    3\n  4    5    6    7       \n  . . .\n  3    0    1    2\n  7    4    5    6\n\n\nUpdate about far vs near redundancy from the discussion in the comments. Suppose sda fails:\n       near\nsda1 sdb1 sdc1 sdd1\n  -    0    1    1\n  -    2    3    3\n  -    4    5    5\n\nthen sdc or sdd can still fail, while in far:\n        far\nsda1 sdb1 sdc1 sdd1\n  -    1    2    3\n  -    5    6    7       \n  . . .\n  -    0    1    2\n  -    4    5    6\n\nnow only sdc can fail, as a failed sdb drive make block 4 inaccessible and a failed sdd drive will make block 3 inaccessible.\nConclusion: chances of surviving a 2-disk failure are higher when using a near layout. (can someone do the math here for a quantitative number?)\n\nA: Picking up some hotspares in advance would be a good idea. Also taking these notes into account.\nRecommended storage scheme for home server? (LVM/JBOD/RAID 5...)\nSee footnote [1] in above link to see what happens with cheap storage when you need it the most.\nThis is all a moot point however until you profile how your the target application actually uses storage. You might find that parallelism is possible, so one block can be used for reading results, and one for writing them. This could be further abstracted behind a RAID0 (until the HBA reports QUEUE_FULL) with the results backed up via rsync. \nIt really depends, saying \"I'm doing image analysis\" without defining the workload or level of service just isn't enough; even if you did, that level of performance analysis is real work, I know it's something \"I\" wouldn't do in my spare time. My intentions are to get you thinking about your application to create your own solutions. Spindles are always the slowest part of your system, plan accordingly.\nOne idea if you wish to do the multi-array approach would be creating two RAID 1's, on separate controllers, and adding those MD devices to a LVM VG for management. Sure a RAID 10 is fast, but it's still one storage queue, now you have two, and with separate controllers there's no HBA queue sharing either.\nPerformance Notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.thesanman.org/2011/12/exchange-completion-time-san-storage.html\n\n*http://sqlblog.com/blogs/joe_chang/archive/2010/10/18/io-queue-depth-strategy.aspx\n\n*http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-4kb-sector-disks/index.html\nRemember, SW RAID is no different than HW RAID, understand how it works or when it fails you might end up being more at risk as opposed to say spending your energies creating a regular backup strategy (rsync.net) instead. I've lost count of the number of users who've lost everything because they didn't read the manual and actually test the failure modes.\n", "Q: Run tasks after requesting a shut down I have a small internet cafe with 7-9 Ubuntu 12.04 workstations. Unfortunately, I can't be there every week.\nI've seen a Java solution to upgrade the system, after a normal (non-sudo/admin) user requests a shut down (but not restart!) the system upgrades itself - the base system is Ubuntu 10.04 as I remember, but the programs, and the desktop manager is fully customized, with custom softwares (eg. to check the printers' ink level...)\nThat's why I thought, that if I could set up something similar in our environment, it would be very useful. I've already scripted in Bash, and used Zenity, so I only want to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*how can I call/run my script?\n\n*how can I run root commands(sudo required) inside that script? (eg. sudo poweroff or halt)\n\n\nA: Here is an overview of what you can do.\nIf you want to check for an upgrade every time the machine is going down you can turn your script into a system v init-script that will run on level 0 (shutdown).\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*change your script to be an init script. \nQuick example - http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-write-sys-v-init-script-to-start-stop-service.html\n\n*put it in /etc/init.d/\n\n*create a symlink like: /etc/rc0.d/K01myscipt -> /etc/init.d/myscript\n\n\nThis will send a stop command (K 01myscript) to your script at the beginning of shutdown process (K 01 myscript - meaning, before others). I'm not sure, but maybe you'll have to cancel shutdown at the beginning of the script - shutdown -c now and issue it again at the end - shutdown -h now.\nThe script will be executed already as root so you don't need any sudo commands. You just need to have permissions create the mentioned files.\n", "Q: How can I tell if the Pause/Break key is working? How can I tell if the Pause key is working in Ubuntu?\nThe tilde (~) key is not working without holding the Right Alt key. Maybe something similar works for the Pause key.\nIt seems to work in System Settings→Keyboard→Shortcuts, but when I'm playing a game which needs this specific key, it does nothing.\nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: You can test that any key is working with the xev command.  \nPress Ctrl + Alt + T to open a terminal window, then type xev. Another popup window opens but you can ignore that (it displays mouse activity). Watch the terminal output while pressing the Pause/Break key and see if there is any output. Here's mine:  \n\nNote that the window created by xev will need to be the window in focus, otherwise, the utility won't capture the key press.\nFor how to use this data, or to remap the key, see this similar question.\n\nA: I've written an in-browser test, so you can test this without having to open the terminal. \nSimply press the Pause/Break key and see if it's working.\n⇒ Pause/Break key test\n", "Q: Is it possible to work on the same region as a locoteam but not IN the locoteam Was checking Jono's Site about Ubuntu Advocacy Development Kit and was wondering if it was possible to reach out to others in my country, state, city, community without having to be in the locoteam. \nDepending on the answer, an additional question would be that if it is possible to create another locoteam.\n\nA: Absolutely! We encourage and recommend people to advocate Ubuntu either as part of a LoCo Team or outside of LoCo Teams if they wish.\nThe primary aim of the ADK is to simply provide all the documentation and materials you need to perform great advocacy.

I am using a separate HDD as a disk for my Virtualbox machine. I have made a vmdk using the tutorial provided in the VirtualBox manual, but in order for the machine to run I have to constantly change the owner and group of the /dev/sdb device to the user I am logged in with.\nTime after time permissions get reset back to root:disk, and I'm not certain when exactly that happens. What can I do to change the owner and group permanently or maybe to not have to do it at all?\n\nA: The probably simplest and best way to fix the problem is adding your user to disk group.\nsudo adduser %user disk\n\nThen logoff and login back, you should able to interact with hard drive from Virtualbox.\n\nA: This overriding behavior you see is udev daemon, the system service which maintains those device files. It acts at boot time and whenever a device is added or removed.\nTo configure permissions for that disk so VirtualBox users can have raw access to it, you have to create a rule for udev in a file under /etc/udev/rules.d/. In your particular case, assuming your user is part of vboxusers group, that can be accomplished with a command like this:\n$ echo 'ENV{DEVNAME}==\"/dev/sdb\" GROUP=\"vboxusers\"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/92-sdb-permissions.rules\n\n", "Q: OpenVPN does not start with the error Already running (PID file exists) If I try to start OpenVPN, I get this error:\n/etc/init.d/openvpn start\n* Starting virtual private network daemon(s)...\n* Autostarting VPN 'server'\n* Already running (PID file exists)\n\nBut OpenVPN is not running, what should I do?\n\nA: Did you read the error message? A Process ID file already exists. Usually this indicated that OpenVPN is already running. When you cleanly shut openVPN down it will remove this file.\nIf the laptop crashed, OpenVPN crashed or for some other reason this file did not get deleted then you can manually do that. \n(In Other words: Make sure that OpenVPN really is not running, then remove the PID file You should find it in /var/run/openvpn/)\n", "Q: Clear Linux file system after shutdown / start I have very specific task.

I've just recently installed Xubuntu 12.04 on my 10 year laptop and on my Acer Aspire One netbook and I'm wondering if the software that I run in Ubuntu 12.04 will also work in Xubuntu. I would think that it would work because they're very similar but I want to be sure about this.\n\nA: Yes all the software that work on Ubuntu 12.04 will definitely work on Xubuntu 12.04, after all both these Operating Systems are based on same Debian and Ubuntu base.\n\nA: No, not all software that works on Ubuntu 12.04 will work on Xubuntu 12.04. \nYou have to understand the differences between Ubuntu and Xubuntu are mainly the desktop environments: that means that most programs run just fine, except they are specific to the desktop environment and the corresponding programs (these are e.g. a different filemanager (nautilus | thunar), different window managers (unity-compiz | xfwm4) and so on). \nSo: if the software you are talking about needs specifically the window-manager or filemanager etc. then this software will not run without problems on Xubuntu.\nYou will definitely be able to run those programs on Xubuntu, but that might come with problems (like filemanager switching, which might replace the icons on the desktop etc.). \nThe answers by the other authors probably relate to general programs like libreoffice, firefox, etc, which are not relying on specific desktop environments.\n\nA: I think the bigger question is what software you are you wanting to install?

Can I use wine to install kaspersky antivirus 2012?\n\nA: It is common for new Linux users to wonder what the best antivirus for Linux is after coming from Windows. Antivirus applications are unnecessary for Ubuntu or Linux in general. There are only a handful of viruses on Linux, and most of them are \"proof of concept\" type viruses, so you would have to hunt them down, download them and manually install them yourself. There are very few, if any viruses in the wild. I do not personally know anyone who runs Ubuntu/Linux and uses an antivirus program, and know no one who has ever had an issue. At most, people run antivirus checks on shared files, to make sure that they do not pass any viruses on to Windows users.\n\nA: According to this list of Anti-Virus application for Linux OS, Kaspersky is available for Linux:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_malware#Anti-virus_applications\nAnd I recommend you to read this ubuntu help page about antivirus on linux: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus .\nHere is a direct link to kaspersky's current .deb file: \nhttp://products.kaspersky-labs.com/products/english/antispam/deb/kas-3-3.0.284-1.i386.deb\nYou can install this .DEB file with the following command from a terminal:\nsudo dpkg -i kas-3-3.0.284-1.i386.deb \n\n\nA: You can install with wine but it is useless. It will only scan and protect from viruses only designed for windows. And windows viruses doesn't work with linux. And ubuntu doesn't need a third party anti virus software - It has a built-in one.\nWelcome\n\nA: I'm not sure if the Windows version of any Antivirus program will work on linux and protect it, but you can try other antivirus programs, Avast has a Linux version and is completely free (as in free of paying) only requires registration in their official page and an email account where you will receive your license key. \nhttp://www.avast.com/es-mx/download-software#tab3\n", "Q: How do I check the up time in Ubuntu 12.10? \nPossible Duplicate:\nSee computer’s uptime and history \n\nWell sometimes for testing purposes I want to know the up time but don't know where to look.

Right now I'm running this bs at startup: timeout 1 nvidia-settings\nHappens with all available drivers (nouveau, current/experimental). The original --load-config-only that was on startup doesn't work.\n\nA: LOAD ONLY SOLUTION\nAfter using the nvidia-settings GUI just as user, edit the ~/.nvidia-settings-rc user file, and remove your host name prefix from all lines, leaving just \":\" to start those lines. Just use replace all (your hostname) to nothing, in most editors.\nThen, optionally set the file to read only; to lock any further changes. Otherwise nvidia-settings GUI changes will add your host name back to the file.\nOr you can rename the edited file, and tell nvidia-settings to use it when loading:\n  nvidia-settings -l --config=/home/user/my_edited_nvidia_settings_rc\nYou just have to remember to set the file to read and write, to unlock your settings, so the GUI will change them again, if needed. Alas, then, you have to remove the hostnames from it again.\nI use this to set a correct gamma/color (green cast) for photography editing, with Nvidia cards. My monitor settings don't do it right.\nWhy removing hostname works, I don't know; but it does!

As there is no use of this feature for me I want to disable this feature whenever I delete is stays it stays in .Trash folder of a device e.g. Pendrive and with time it start to take space in GB's. How can i disable it.\n\nA: If you permanently delete something, it will not create a .Trash folder and put it there. To do this in Nautilus (the default file browser in Ubuntu), simply hold the Shift key while pressing delete. This will bypass the Trash, which is similar to the Recycling Bin in Windows and allows undeleting.\nYou can also add a Delete right-click command which bypasses trash in Nautilus. To do this, open Nautilus and select Edit -> Preferences. Then click the Behavior tab, and select \"Include a Delete command that bypasses Trash\".\nAlso, as Uri Herrera mentioned, you can empty the trash to remove it.\n\nA: I too am one of those who have been bugged by this problem for a number of years ... unsatisfied with the existing proposals, I've recently taken the time to investigate a solution myself. If you can live with the fact that the following describes how to disable Gnome's trash globally (i.e. not only for removable devices), then the linked tutorial may just be for you.\nStarting with the premise that I want the Trash to be gone system-wide, I've found that -- for the time being -- the only real solution is to create a custom-compiled version of libgio (» GIO) which is modified to call g_file_delete() every time an application calls g_file_trash().\nFor all technology savvy users interested in this solution: I've just recently posted a step-by-step guide on GitHub:\nGlobally disable GNOME's Trash in Debian-based distributions\nI hope this is of (some) help to those who hate the Trash with the same passion as I do ...\n", "Q: What is aptitude's extended state information I have both apt-get and aptitude installed on my system.

If there are only two partitions on the hard drive - ext4 / and a swap partition then you have re-partitioned and formatted your hard drive.  Recovery would be difficult but you could try testdisk to see if will recognise any of the old partitions and the data on them.\nIf you have multiple partitions including your Windows hidden recovery partition and the NTFS Windows partition, then you could try to mount the main NTFS partition to copy your data off it.\nBackups of important data are highly recommended before installing any operating system or doing anything to partitions.  Data recovery in cases where things go wrong can be a difficult and expensive process.

See this question for how to handle global hotkeys correctly in C: Global Hotkey with X11/Xlib\nNow you only need some Python Xlib library; python-xlib looks like a reasonable choice.\n\nA: I recenlty used PyUserInput for a similar task.

Installation seemed to go fine, and this morning I had a message like \"restart now to complete installation\".  So I restart, get an initial \"Loading Operating System ...\" message, followed by \"error: file not found.  Then it kicks into \"grub rescue>\" mode.  \nPreviously I have this running as a dual boot (window 7) and I just ran the upgrade to 12.10 via the update manager in ubuntu.  Any ideas on what is going on here, or what the error means?  I know my way around the command line, but this is above my pay grade.  Thanks for any advice.\n\nA: It looks like you might just have a UUID problem. So it might be a good idea to try this by booting from USB including live Ubuntu, Parted Magic, Rescatux, etc. (see, for example, http://liveusb.info/), starting Gparted to check the UUID of your Ubuntu partition against the value in the file /etc/fstab in that Ubuntu partition on your hard disk.\nIf UUID values are the same, you can then move on to \"boot-repair\" and then \"rescatux\" as mentioned.\n\nA: Personally I've never had any luck upgrading Ubuntu.  Its always best to do a clean install.  The problem is grub and the mbr (I think, can someone confirm this). A good tip is to have /home on a different partition so you don't lose much if you have to nuke you OS.  Back to your original question one of the best tools for fixing grub is rescatux.  This will almost all grub issues.\nTo you rescatux:\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn to usb of dvd\n\n*Boot the device \n\n*Follow the on screen instructions to fix grub\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nA: All of these answers were helpful, in the end I used the boot-repair tool to fix my issues.  \n", "Q: Xubuntu Mail Watcher (XFCE Plugin) Won't Connect To IMAP I am trying to get the XFCE Mail Watcher panel plugin to check my IMAP mail, but it won't connect to my server.

If I change my username from name@domain to name, I still get this error, but it takes a few seconds longer to appear. Nothing shows up in the log.\nIf it makes a difference, my mail is hosted by Microsoft, in some way. Like I say, I can access it through Thurderbird using the IMAP credentials; but I have the Exchange 2010 web app, if I use webmail. Could this be the problem? (Thunderbird often complains with \"Command Error. 12\" with what it gets back from the server, but carries on regardless.)\n\nA: Try installing a plug-in for Thunderbird called Firetray, its a decent workaround to avoid this Xubuntu 12.10 \"Bug\".\n\nA: You may need to enable \"less secure app\" setting on your gmail account for this to work\nhttps://www.google.com/settings/u/1/security/lesssecureapps\n", "Q: Sizes of application windows are not remembered each time the app is launched Kubuntu 12.04 standard install, kernel is 3.2.0-34-generic.\n\n\n*\n\n*I launch an application (specific application is irrelevant as this issue occurs with all of them).\n\n*I maximize the window, or move it to a specific location on the screen.\n\n*I close the application.\n\n*The next time I launch the app, the window is back at its original size and location.\n\n\nIf any further information is required. \n\nA: Specific application is important, actually.

Ok I always have issues recording my desktop with kazam or gtk-recordmydesktop so now I'm very paranoid so is it ok to have ffmpeg running with kazam at the same time? will there be conflicts? thanks\n\nA: ffmpeg isn't a recorder, it's a transcoder. It's turning what you're recording into a compressed, playable video file. It's likely that one of your screen recorders is calling it.\nBut otherwise, screen recorders use up a incredible percentage of CPU resources. If you were actually recording with two of them at once, you would likely be unable to use your desktop, so I guess that would be a pretty severe issue.\nBut I don't think there would be any actual conflicts. The graphics stack is quite modular.\nHaving two installed (but not running together) should certainly not be an issue.\n", "Q: VirtualBox install I am using Win 7 Ultimate. I have the current version of Virtualbox.

The error message also says it cannot read the disc, etc, etc.\nI have downloaded 2 different versions of Ubuntu. I had downloaded and re-installed VirtualBox twice. I also tried 12.04 but came into the same issue. I downloaded the \"desktop AMD-64\" Thank you in advance for your help.\n\nA: Probably you haven't enabled the Virtualization Technology through your BIOS. I cannot help you with that because every one is different.\nTry downloading the 32-bit version of Ubuntu.\nHope it helps you.\n\nA: Ensure that the virtual disk has enough free space for installation of Ubuntu.\nI believe Ubuntu Desktop edition needs at least 5Gb free space.\n\nA: Make sure you enable PAE/NX and VT-x or AMD-V\nBUT... Something strange happened in VMware.\nWhren I enable VT-x there...\nVT-x is not supported in ths VM.\nContinue without VT-x? \n(Or something like that, I don't concentrate (Forget))\n\nA: Make sure you check the md5sum for the ISO that you download. This simple check can save you hours of frustration.\nIt does sound like it might be a 64bit virtualisation problem however.  Download the 32bit (i386) release, check the md5sum as mentioned, and try installing that.\n", "Q: Keyboard Layout Table – how to force update? After creating a custom keyboard layout, a table picturing the layout in a nice graphical representation was automatically created.\nIt can be accessed from the keyboard icon.\nIt opens in a separate window, cf. below:\n\nHowever, this table isn't updated after making changes to an already existing layout (even not after rebooting).\nThis is annoying, since now the picture doesn't correspond to the actual keyboard layout, but rather to the original one, before making any changes. It is just never updated after a keyboard layout is created with a new name.\nRemoving the keyboard layout from /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/ and creating it again doesn't help; the table seems to be cached somewhere.\nI have no idea where this picture (or whatever it be) is saved, I don't even know what program creates it (it doesn't look too much like the ps-files created by xkbprint). Maybe deleting the table (not the keyboard layout) would do the job, but since I don't know where it is, I couldn't try.\nI'd appreciate any hint on how I can force this table to be updated, so to fit my modified keyboard layout.\n(I'm using Precise with Unity.)\n\nA: A cache of (compiled) keyboard layouts is kept in the /var/lib/xkb/ directory, in the various *.xkm files.  Perhaps deleting these files may help?  There is a README in that directory giving a bit more information.\n\nA: AFAIK the only solution is to restart X server, either by re-logging in / rebooting, or by:\n$ sudo restart lightdm\n\n", "Q: Install Libreoffice SDK in 12.10 How can I install the libreoffice SDK in Ubuntu 12.10?

I'm having a problem with both Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10 with custom keyboard shorcuts. They are reset after a while (I can't find a pattern but it seems to be when a massive upgrade happens). It happend to me a couple of days ago, when 12.10 got about 27 updates. \nI've searched launchapd and askubuntu, and found no question similar. \nMy shortucts are not lost on reboot, I still can't find a pattern to identify the problem as I said. \nI tried also not using Control Center app, but gnome's dconf-editor, but same result as I found on some blog post. \nMy question is, how can I save my custom shorcuts to restore them when this happens?\nCan somebody help me compose a bug for launchpad, like what package could be causing this, so I can fill a bug report.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: This seems to be related to a series of bugs on launchpad.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.10 The first answer to this post has a workaround using gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings <command> \"[<key-sequence>]\" within your startup script.\n\n*Ubuntu 12.10 - I'm guessing it should be merged with the first\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: Thanks to Graham's links, it seems this was fixed for 13.04 but not \"backported\" to 12.10.\nUpdate Amazingly.. this doesn't appear to be fixed in 13.04 release! :(  I still had to use solution below.\nUntil then here's something I've pieced together from the comments on launchpad, it works for me on Ubuntu 12.10.\n/etc/rc.local didn't work for me, so I created ~/.config/autostart/key_settings.desktop :\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=sh -c 'sleep 1; exec ~/.config/autostart/key_settings.sh'\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName=Load My Custom Shortcuts\n\nThen the actual script ~/.config/autostart/key_settings.sh:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n#dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/minimize \"['<Super>h']\"\n#dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/close \"['<Super>q']\"\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings minimize \"['<Super>h']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings close \"['<Super>q']\"\n\nCommented out the dconf method for reference, though gsettings works for me.\nTo find the keycodes, you can simply use Keyboard Shortcuts window open next to Terminal, then use the \"get\" command:\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings minimize\n\nPS: this was meant more to elaborate on a practical fix suggested by Graham's links.\n\nA: Get rid of Alt+F1 (panel-main-menu) binding which is used in some Jetbrain products (Phpstorm)\nI couldn't get the information on how to permanently set custom keybindings in Ubuntu 19 so after countless tries I ended up doing the following (maybe someone knows how to do that without the need of a script):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a script paste code and set executable permissions:\n\n\nvi custom-key-bindings.sh\n\n#!/bin/bash\ngsettings set  org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings panel-main-menu \"['<Alt>7']\"\n\nchmod +x \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt+F2\n\n*gnome-session-properties\n\n*Add command & set path to script\n\n*Done\n\n\nCheck after reboot with\ngsettings get  org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings panel-main-menu\n", "Q: How can I make Seamonkey the default Web and E-Mail client in Precise?

This is a hardware limitation. You need a computer that supports this CPU feature. I'm not sure what else I can say about it.\nIf you're certain that your computer does support either protocol, check the BIOS. I know mine allows me to turn it off (it was on by default).

I have the source folder in my desktop which I can edit without 'sudo'ing. Then, I sync the files to var/www using sudo rsync. I gave the folders in var/www necessary permissions (770 for the mentioned folder,  since www-data is added to root group, and apache has to write to this directory, that is upload directory). It works well. But, when I restart the computer,  files in the upload folder in var/www disappears. I cannot understand what is happening.\n  drwxrwxr-x 2 root www-data 4096 Dec 15 08:26 uploaded_files\n\nmy folder permissions look like this.\nEDIT: The files disappear some time after the upload. \nI'm just confused like hell. \nAny help will be appreciated. I'm a newbie in linux file, folder permission btw.\nThanks.\n\nA: I had my source files in my Desktop, and I was syncing with var/www manually so that I don't have to sudo files individually. I was achieving this by syncing the entire desktop folder whenever I felt syncing is necessary. I used the '--delete' bit in my rsync command, so that any extra files in the destination which might have been deleted in my Desktop source, will be removed.\nHere is the catch: I have a /upload/dir in my desktop, but nothing really gets uploaded, since it is done in document root, which is /var/www/. So, whenever I sync files, my Desktop /upload/dir (which is empty and will always be) replaces the /upload/dir in the document root. Hence the content disappeared.\nMoral (for me & new linux users): Never blindly copy commands in terminal, without getting a basic understanding.\n\nA: They're either not saved, or removed. Check if /var/www isn't on a tmpfs (that's like a RAM disk, files are not saved to disk but kept in memory and so will disappear on reboot):\ndf -hT /var/www\n\nand see what's under \"Type\".

My device is neither the S2 or the Galaxy tab. Any ideas on how to get this working?\n\nA: Possible solution(s) discussed here:\nOMG! Ubuntu > Connect your Android Ice Cream Sandwich Phone to Ubuntu for File Access\n\nAs explained by Google Engineer Dan Morrill, the USB mass storage protocol was a block-level protocol. What this meant was that a partition could not be mounted on two different systems at the same time. Each partition that needs to be mounted on a computer must be unmounted from the phone first. This would be impossible on a phone with only a single partition, since if the system partition was unmounted, the phone would crash.\nTo work around this issue, Android phones up until now either had two partitions in the internal memory (like the Nexus S) or had a microSD slot (like the Samsung Galaxy S II). Phones with micro-SD slots would just export the microSD card partitions to the connected computer.\nBut the Galaxy Nexus only has a single internal partition. Other Ice Cream Sandwich phones in the future are likely to follow suit. ..\n\n\nUPDATE\nLengthy discussion, and possible udev rules to fix this issue, in this forum:\nOpenSuse.org > Cannot connect Samsung Galaxy S3 (Android 4) via USB cable\n\nThat's because it needs a udev rule\nCan you plug the device in and then run the command dmesg, then post\n  the output for your device (in code tags), which should be the last\n  ~10 entries. I can then add a udev rule to my package and update for\n  you.\nOnce you have the updated package, you need to mount like;\n  [CODE]\n  mkdir ~/galaxy\n  jmtpfs -o allow_other ~/galaxy\nTo unmount use;\n  fusermount -u ~/galaxy\n  [CODE]\n  There is a man page, use man jmtpfs \n\n\nUPDATE 2\nA better explanation and suggested configuration (Nov 2011), so may be slightly outdated.\nIce Cream Sandwich explained: MTP - what is it, why use it, and how to set it up\n\nMTP (Media Transfer Protocol) first showed up as default on Android devices with Honeycomb.  It's a bit of a change from the normal USB Mass Storage (UMS) file transfer that we're used to, where you plug in your phone, hit \"USB mode\" and start moving files. And because it's become the standard in Ice Cream Sandwich on the Galaxy Nexus, it's time to have a look at it.  Hit the break where we see what it is, why we're using it, and how to set it up on your computer for easy file transfer.\nOn a Linux install, things aren't quite as easy.  On the plus side you have a bit of control how things are mounted, but there's no one click solution.  Don't be discouraged, you can have MTP set up and running in no time with a bit of terminal command fun.

This is the situation:   \nWorking on (the next version of) a Unity Quick List editor, I would like to add a reliable way of \"restarting\" launcher icons. To do so, I need to remove the icon (editing gsettings) and replace it on the same position. So far no problem. However, if the application in question is running, user will possibly lose data, as the application will quit when it's icon is removed from the launcher. What I need is a reliable way to find an application's process name, to let the editor check in the list of running processes if the application is running, and send a warning message to the user that the icon can not be restarted if the application is running.\nWhat I did so far is make the editor look into the desktop file, to read the command, also read the command, stripped from the directory section, and furthermore look into possible remote scripts the desktop file command might refer to, looking for strings starting with \"./\"\nAlthough the method seems to work well with all applications I tested it on, I have the feeling there must be an easier way to cover the problem in an \"all in one\" way...\nIs there?\nAlso suggestions to catch more exceptional situations are welcome!\n\nA: There is no way to solve this in the general case. Whatever mechanism you come up with, I believe that it will always be possible to write a process that will elude you, unless you modify the way that processes are launched in the first place in order to track them that way.\nUpstart has to deal with exactly the same problem to track if daemons are still running, and upstart job authors have to specify details (the number of forks) for upstart to track. Given that upstart cannot manage it without help, I don't think that you can, either. And upstart is even in control of the way that processes are launched, which I don't think you are here.\nI think the best you can do is what you are doing already. Looking at /proc/<pid>/stat and /proc/<pid>/cmdline is a reasonably general way, but still will not catch every case. The pgrep command wraps this. If you aren't already using pgrep, take a look at the pgrep manpage for options of things you can match against.\nHaving said all that, I'm not convinced that you really need to do this in the first place. If you can't track the process, then I don't see how Unity could do this either. Wouldn't a better approach be to eliminate the application crashes in the first place? I would look into details of why your applications are crashing (surely that's a bug somewhere?), rather than trying to work around it as you have described. I wonder if this only affects Unity-aware applications which are calling back to Unity for extra functionality via DBus?\n\nA: The xprop command (followed by alt-tab to the relevant app window, then click once in the window) seems to do the trick for me.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't boot on windows starter I installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS yesterday from a usb, but it only boots into Windows unless the usb is in, then it boots into the Ubuntu loader where I can choose Ubuntu vs. Windows.

This has all sorts of side-effects, one of the more annoying being that I can't log into my gmail.\nAt first I just waited for a time sync to happen, as I have that activated and all. It never happened. I googled and didn't find any way of enforcing a time sync, which I found very strange. Is there really none?\nSetting the time and date by hand is also a problem. For my 12.10 installation, the time & date settings are bugged. I remember it being for my last, older installation as well, though. Of course the easiest way should be to just manually edit the date and time fields by entering a new date. This is possible in theory, but the changes are reverted as soon as the text boxes loose focus. The other way to do it is to click the +-buttons for a long, long time. The first time I did that, the changes weren't stored either. I found out that afterwards I have to switch from manual to internet-sync mode and wait ~5 seconds until the in the top left corner of my system the new time is shown, or otherwise it won't have effect.\nSo a nice solution would be one of the following: Setting the time/date by hand, maybe via terminal, so I can just enter the right values. Or, a command that would enforce an immediate time sync, that I can run after booting. I know I have to change the batteries soon, but this is seriously keeping me from working...\n\nA: You can set the hardware clock with the command (for example)\nsudo hwclock --set --date=\"2012-12-15 20:49:00\"\n\nYou then need to syncronise the system clock to the hardware clock:\nsudo hwclock -s\n\nReference: $ man hwclock\n", "Q: Firefox on Ubuntu 12.04 cannot connect to the internet Every other browser installed is working fine, but Firefox will not connect to the internet.

Some of them are imgur, yahoo, fed-sudoku, microsoft and addons page of firefox. I am sure there are many more that won't load.\nI have Windows 7 in Dual-Boot and there are no problems whatsoever in opening these pages on Windows.\nBrief History\nTwo weeks ago I installed Ubuntu 12.10. I faced this issue right away. I thought something must have gone wrong with the installation, so I removed Ubuntu 12.10 and instead installed Lubuntu 12.10, but the issue persisted. So, I tried opening these webpages in Live Environments (of Ubuntu 12.10, Lubuntu 12.10 and Ubuntu 12.04.1) from USB. The issue was there for Ubuntu 12.10 and Lubuntu 12.10. However, I was able to access these webpages from Ubuntu 12.04.1. So, I installed 12.04.1 on my HardDisk. Everything on 12.04 was fine till yesterday; but suddenly, these sites don't load anymore. Windows 7 in Dual-Boot works flawlessly.\nUpdates\n(1) In response to Zhang's Answer to check basic terminal commands - I have used both OpenDNS and GooglePublic DNS to test these commands (Restarted my PC in between). These are the terminal outputs while using OpenDNS and while using GooglePublicDNS.\n(2) This is the result of ifconfig - Pastebin Link.\n(3) Thereafter I tried to use wget to check if the problem was with the Browser. However, it didn't work for webpages which are not loading in my browser. This is the Pastebin Link showing it for Google(works) and Yahoo(doesn't work).\n(4) Then followed the instructions listed at noobslab to disable IPV6. Also, restarted my PC. However, it didn't help either.\n(5) Then, I edited my Wired Connection through Network-Manager to ignore IPV6. After that, I tried to open Yahoo in Browser -  it did load the first time. However, when I tried again, it didn't load. Other problem sites didn't load at all.\n(6) Again tried wget. However, this time passed the argument -4 to it; ie; wget -4 www.yahoo.com. But once again, didn't get any response.\n(7) Then, tried to fiddle with MTU. Followed this link to check what is the maximum that I can set. For me, the maximum possible was 10324. Also tried other values like 1500, 1492, 1452 and 100. But this didn't help either.\n(8) Re-installed Ubuntu 12.04.1, wiping out the previous installation and as such all other changes. Also installed all the available updates. For the first half-an-hour, I was able to load all the webpages - including the ones which had problem. But lateron, I have the same issue as earlier - not able to load pages like yahoo, imgur, microsoft, fed-sudoku, etc. \n(9) Question by laurent\n\nFrom wget pastebin info in the question, the problem is not DNS as the wget and dig commands reach Yahoo's IP. This said, I don't know why nothing downloads with wget! Have you set a firewall? (you can check with sudo iptables -L). In ifconfig results, there are 2 interfaces, ppp0 and eth0. Which one should be used to connect to internet? Could you post the result of route command? Obs: eth0 has no IPV4 address so I think it is not properly configured (how is /etc/network/interfaces?)\n\nHere is the Pastebin Link for terminal outputs of sudo iptables -L ; route  and  cat /etc/network/interfaces. I am not running any firewall. It's a clean install of Ubuntu 12.04.1. ppp0 is used to connect to the internet (this takes username and password which was given by my ISP) and eth0 is the Intel's OnBoard LAN which connects the modem through ethernet port.\n(10) Tried to append nameserver 208.67.222.222 line in /etc/resolv.conf (since, I am using OpenDNS). But this didn't help (even after restart). So reverted the changes back. This is also a part of answer provided by laurent - it's required if I want to use OpenDNS.\nOther Info\n\n\n*\n\n*I have an ADSL modem (not a router) connected to the PC with an Ethernet Port. To connect to the internet, I have a DSL Connection. So, I use PPPOE to connect.\n\n*Terminal Output for System Information sudo lshw -C network ; cat /etc/resolv.conf ; ifconfig -a - Pastebin Link\n\nA: Append this line to you /etc/resolv.conf:\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\n\nA: The original problem could possibly have been solved by doing the following.\nsudo apt-get install resolvconf\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\n\nA: Maybe you can try disabling the dnsmasq:\nsudo vim /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nPut a # in front of dns=dnsmasq\nThen:\nsudo restart network-manager\n\nI have a problem of resolving some websites after I installed 12.04 and 12.10. After I disabled dnsmasq everything worked fine. \nIf this helps, you can then install the full dnsmasq service and put your favourite DNS provider in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail.\n\nA: Part 1 - PPPoE connection not working\nI would try disabling the Network Manager and configuring the network manually like explained in Ubuntu help ADSLPPPoE. Use the Config with pppoeconf part first which is basically running sudo pppoeconf and answering the questions. As you need to use a different DNS server than the one of your ISP, answer no to the question about using the peer DNS server.\nOptional if your internet connection is not restarted at boot:\nYou can edit nano /etc/rc.local, add the following lines before the exit line and reboot to test it.\nkillall pppd\nifconfig eth0 up\npon dsl-provider\n\nNetwork manager won't be used when you use the manual config but you can disable it clicking on it and de-selecting the option enable network (and enable wireless if present). If disabling only doesnt work, you can also uninstall it with sudo apt-get remove network-manager and after sudo apt-get autoremove to clean the auto-installed packages.\nPart 2 Changing default ISP DNS server to openDNS\nI found here that the best way to use a static DNS with resolvconf is to add the nameserver in /etc/network/interfaces or to add it in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head. As your interfaces are automatically configured (dhcp) you have to use the head file:\nsudo nano /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head\n\nand add at the end:\nnameserver 208.67.222.222\nnameserver 208.67.220.220\n\nLimitations \n\n\n*\n\n*You cannot use Network-Manager to connect. However, this automatically gets you connected to the internet. Otherwise, you can connect by running pon dsl-provider. To disconnect, you need to be sudo, so running sudo poff disconnects.\n\n*[This issue is only with Ubuntu 12.04.] While Booting Ubuntu (with Modem turned off or while it is still trying to establish a link with the ISP) - Ubuntu waits for loading Network-Configuration for about 2 mins and thereafter boots without Network-Configuration. To get online you have to run pon dsl-provider.\n\n\n\nFixes to remove the previous tests made (not needed in other cases):\nAs we deleted the resolv.conf symlink before, we need to recreate it (not needed on new install):\ncd /etc\nsudo rm resolv.conf\nsudo ln -s ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf\n\nIf this works, you can revert the changes in /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf we made before.\n\nA: *\n\n*Verify that your client can communicate with the openDNS servers\nsudo traceroute -n -w 2 -q 2 -m 30  208.67.222.222\n\nIf the last line of the output does not list  208.67.222.222 as the final hop, or if there are significant timeouts, there may be a network problem preventing you from contacting openDNS servers.\n\n*Verify that openDNS can resolve the selected hostname\ndig @208.67.222.222 www.difficult.com.      \n\nAt the command prompt, run the following command, replacing www.difficult.com. with the name that you were having difficulty resolving (putting a period at the end of the name to avoid problems with domain suffixes and search lists) \nIf the output does not show an answer for the hostname, continue:\n\n*Verify that another open resolver can resolve the selected hostname\ndig @8.8.8.8 www.difficult.com.\ndig @8.8.8.4 www.difficult.com.\ndig @4.2.2.1 www.difficult.com.\ndig @4.2.2.2 www.difficult.com.\n\nIf you do get a successful result, there may be a problem with openDNS\n\n*Check to see if the authoritative nameservers are correct\nintoDNS is very helpful.         \n\nUPDATE:\nThis answer could not deal with the problem , just for troubleshooting.\nIf DNS resolve worked fine,go to see laurent's answer furthermore.  \n\nReference:public DNS troubleshooting\n\nA: Same problem occurred here (ASUS EeePC 1015BX - Ubuntu 12.10 - AMD C-60 system).\nGEditing the /etc/resolv.conf file (sudo -H gedit /etc/resolv.conf) and replacing the\nnameserver 127.0.1.1 line with the following\nnameserver 208.67.222.222\nnameserver 208.67.220.220\n\nsolved the problems.\nYou can make this permanent by using these procedures.\n\nA: Apparently, the problem is how Ubuntu deals with DSL connections. I failed to configure my DSL connection as suggested by the experts.\nAs a work around, I'm using TOR, since there are only handful of websites which are affected by it. \n\nA: Well, I just write this command whenever this stops working, I still believe it to be a bug, or maybe I am doing something wrong with my pc\nservice NetworkManager restart\n\nIt should start working ( if there is a internet connection offcourse). But if it doesn't work, try updating the dns records and then go for the above command again. It shold work. \n\nA: Same issue i have faced in my laptop with Ubuntu 20.04.\n\n*\n\n*Clear the browser history and cookies\n\n*Restart the network manager(sudo service network-manager restart)\n\n*Restart your ubuntu\n\nThis steps fixed my issues\n", "Q: How do I make Ubuntu appear as a bluetooth keyboard? I have an iPad 2 and would like that my Ubuntu system appear as a bluetooth keyboard for it, so that what I type on my computer appears on my iPad.\nIs there a specific way to do that?\n\nA: You can make your computer act as a Bluetooth keyboard for other devices, provided that:\n\n\n*\n\n*It has Bluetooth, and runs Bluez. (This is true of Ubuntu systems with Bluetooth.)\n\n*It's running a Linux-based operating system. (That includes Ubuntu!)\n\n*You have administrative abilities in your Linux-based OS (for example, you can sudo to root).\n\n\nThere is a FOSS program that does this, called hidclient:\n\nThe hidclient program makes a Bluetooth® technology equipped computer\n  appear as a Bluetooth® keyboard and mouse device to other machines.\n  Input events (like keystrokes and mouse movements) of the locally\n  attached input devices will be forwarded to another machine via the\n  Bluetooth® link.\nFor the counterpart (which might be a Linux PC, a Win PC, a PDA...)\n  there is no technical difference to \"real\" Bluetooth® input devices.\n\nSource: hidclient's official site (main page).\nThat totally rocks: you don't have to do anything special to your iPad (or any other mobile device that works with Bluetooth keyboards) to get this to work. You don't have to jailbreak it. You don't have to install any special apps. Just install and run hidclient, then tell your mobile device (the iPad) you want to use your Bluetooth keyboard!\nEverything you need to get the software and learn how to use it is right here.\nAfter reading the whole page (so you understand how it works), make sure to use the instructions at the end (for Ubuntu).\nHere's a compact version (essentially the same procedure – this worked better for me):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install libbluetooth-dev .\n\n*Download hidclient source code for Ubuntu. (Check the official page to make sure that's not out of date.) Put it in a folder by itself and extract its contents.\n\n*Type make and press Enter to compile the source.\n\n*Back up and edit your Bluetooth configuration:\n• sudo cp /etc/bluetooth/main.conf /etc/bluetooth/main.conf.old\n• sudo -H gedit /etc/bluetooth/main.conf\n• Under #DisablePlugins = network,input add the line DisablePlugins = input (no #).\n• Add a # to the beginning of Class = 0x000100; under it, write Class=0x000540 (no #).\n• Save the file and quit the text editor.\n\n*If you want to be able to run hidclient like a normal command:\n• Run sudo cp hidclient /usr/local/bin.\n• Check if /usr/local/bin is in your path with echo $PATH.\n• If it's not, add it with any of these methods.\nIf you skip this step, you can run hidclient by making sure you're in the directory where you compiled it, and running ./hidclient instead of hidclient.\n\n\nRunning hidclient\nRun hidclient --help (or see the bottom of the web page) to see how to use it. \nExcept when run with the --help flag, hidclient must be run as root. So use sudo hidclient (followed by whatever options you're specifying, as explained in the help).\nBasically, there's two steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo hidclient -l for a numbered list of devices.\n\n*Run sudo hidclient -eN -x, replacing N with the number of the device you want to \"forward\" over Bluetooth. In your case, this will be the keyboard.\n\n\nYou're all set. Tell your mobile device (iPad) to use a Bluetooth keyboard.\nTerminating hidclient\nThe last thing you need to be able to do is to stop using the keyboard for Bluetooth input. See, when hidclient is running, the device you select is no longer giving input to your Ubuntu system. If it were anything but the keyboard (say, the mouse), you could quit hidclient by pressing Ctrl+C in the Terminal.\nBut you cannot do that, because keyboard input won't go to the Terminal or any other Ubuntu program. The keyboard is acting as a Bluetooth device!\nSo, when \"forwarding\" the keyboard, quit hidclient by closing the Terminal window (or tab) in which it's running, with the mouse (or trackpad).\n\n\n*\n\n*Of course, if your Ubuntu machine has multiple keyboards, you could \"forward\" one as a Bluetooth device and continue to use the other on your computer.\n\n\nReferences/Acknowledgements\n\n\n*\n\n*hidclient program and project page, by Anselm Martin Hoffmeister\n\n*This Server Fault answer by Capt.Nemo, which pointed me in the right direction.\n\n", "Q: Asus n56vm ssd boot issues New Asus n56vm laptop with an SSD (Samsumg 830) installed instead of the HDD it came with.\nUbuntu is the only OS installed on it and its installed in EFI mode. \nThe problem is that it will boot maybe 9 out of 10 times if an USB device (such as a mouse) is connected before powering up. If no mouse then it will 9 out of 10 times hang right after the grub menu (saying \"Loading initial ramdisk\").\nNo logs are being written to /var/log so there's nothing to google on, I've experimented with with booting into rescue mode, setting/unsetting several grub flags (noacpi, disable graphical boot etc) but nothing has worked so far. \nIn the bios I can see 2 boot options of the SSD (2 Ubuntu with identical names). Booting of the second in the list reverses the issue above (9 out of 10 times it will boot without the mouse attached). \nI've tried this fix: which kind of touches on the subject, but did not solve the issue.\nI ran Boot-Repair on it, and when I did a third boot option off the hard disk appeared, but still the same behavior as above occurred.\nDo you have any hints about how to solve this?\n\nA: It seems to be working now. Here's what I did though not sure what caused it to work:\nI flashed the BIOS from v204 (was default this from factory) to the latest 214 here. The bootup splash image is set to static.\nDid not do this myself but the current kernel is 3.5.0-21-generic\n\nA: I have three ideas about this, all of them very tentative/speculative:\n\n\n*\n\n*This could be a kernel (or kernel driver) bug, in which case you'll need to wait for an updated kernel, or perhaps hunt down a new one that includes a fix and compile it yourself.\n\n*If you're booting with Secure Boot active, try disabling it. Ubuntu's Secure Boot support is very new, and could well have bugs that aren't well-understood, much less fixed.\n\n*You could try another boot loader. Several are available. I recommend trying either ELILO or the kernel's EFI stub loader (probably with the help of either rEFInd or gummiboot). Most of these options will require either disabling Secure Boot or jumping through some extra hoops to get your desired solution to boot with the help of a version of shim that Ubuntu doesn't yet provide.\n\n", "Q: How to boot Windows 8 after installing Ubuntu 12.10?

Specially, when I place my hands comfortably to type, it \"thinks\" I'm touching the top-left corner. This becomes really annoying when I have to use both (the keyboard and touchpad), as it thinks I'm performing a 2 finger click (the mouse stop moving).

(currently disabled)\n3) The \"Block touchpad while typing\" option resulted annoying as well, as I often use both input methods at the same time (like when you are searching for a file in a directory and type part of its name, and then clicking on the correct file). With that option, I have to wait about 3 secs in order to be able to use the touchpad, which I think is too much.\n4) I could disable 2-finger scroll, but I use it a lot. \n5) I thought that changing the Edges could be the easy way to go. I checked X and Y values in: \"synclient -m 100\" , and change the LeftEdge and RightEdge values as shown above. But even after setting them (using synclient LeftEdge=...) the cursor still moves below the LeftEdge and after the RightEdge, what am I doing wrong?\nIt seems that many options have no effect (like TapAndDragGesture), while changing others do (like setting 3 finger middle-click, etc.). Is that possible?\nWhat other alternatives could I try to solve it? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: After so many years, finally I solved. The trick was to set these settings:\nsynclient PalmDetect=1\nsynclient PalmMinWidth=10\nsynclient PalmMinZ=0\n\nThis answer helped: Touchpad palm sensitivity\nUPDATE\nThe above settings solve part of the problem, as the cursor still jumps randomly while you are typing (very annoying). By chance, I found out that the following settings removed that behavior:\nsynclient AreaLeftEdge=2000\nsynclient AreaRightEdge=5000\n\nNote: those are the settings for my device... you need to find out your device values.\nTry incrementing AreaRightEdge starting from zero until you can move the cursor as \"normal\". AreaLeftEdge works the opposite, so from zero, increment it until it doesn't move... then go back little by little until the cursor moves as \"normal\" again. (at the end, AreaRightEdge can not be lower than AreaLeftEdge). \nAnd to save the settings, follow this: How do I make my synclient settings stick?\n", "Q: Wifi - wireless network not working after installing Ubuntu 12.04 I had installed ubuntu 12.04 in my Dell Vostro 3460.

How can I remove it keeping Lubuntu desktop?\n\nA: Chromium is specified as a dependency of the lubuntu-desktop package, so uninstalling it will cause the lubuntu-desktop package to be uninstalled.  However, lubuntu-desktop is only a metapackage; removing it will not actually uninstall the Lubuntu desktop environment.  \nThe only problem you will have is that when you upgrade to the next version of Lubuntu, the lubuntu-desktop package will be reinstalled and with it Chromium.\n", "Q: Problem prevents the update or installation of new software It's been a week now that whenever i run sudo apt-get update it shows me this:\nErr http://archive.ubuntu.com quantal InRelease    Err\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com quantal-updates InRelease    Err\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com quantal-backports InRelease    Err\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com quantal-security InRelease    Err\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com quantal-proposed InRelease    Err\nhttp://archive.canonical.com quantal InRelease    Err\nhttp://archive.canonical.com quantal InRelease    Err\nhttp://extras.ubuntu.com quantal InRelease    Err\nhttp://ppa.launchpad.net quantal InRelease    Err\nhttp://ppa.launchpad.net quantal InRelease    Err\nhttp://ppa.launchpad.net quantal InRelease    Err http://dl.google.com\nstable InRelease    Err http://archive.ubuntu.com quantal Release.gpg \nUnable to connect to 127.0.0.1:9666: Err http://archive.ubuntu.com\nquantal-updates Release.gpg   Unable to connect to 127.0.0.1:9666: Err\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com quantal-backports Release.gpg   Unable to\nconnect to 127.0.0.1:9666: Err http://archive.ubuntu.com\nquantal-security Release.gpg   Unable to connect to 127.0.0.1:9666:\nErr http://archive.canonical.com quantal Release.gpg   Unable to\nconnect to 127.0.0.1:9666: Err http://extras.ubuntu.com quantal\nRelease.gpg   Unable to connect to 127.0.0.1:9666: Err\nhttp://ppa.launchpad.net quantal Release.gpg   Unable to connect to\n127.0.0.1:9666: Err http://ppa.launchpad.net quantal Release.gpg   Unable to connect to 127.0.0.1:9666: Err http://dl.google.com stable\nRelease.gpg   Unable to connect to 127.0.0.1:9666: Err\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com quantal-proposed Release.gpg   Unable to\nconnect to 127.0.0.1:9666: Err http://archive.canonical.com quantal\nRelease.gpg   Unable to connect to 127.0.0.1:9666: Err\nhttp://ppa.launchpad.net quantal Release.gpg   Unable to connect to\n127.0.0.1:9666: Reading package lists...

Don't you have/had any software like apt-cacher and removed/disable it?\nIf this is the case, that information should be configured in /etc/apt/apt.conf or in any file present on /etc/apt/apt.conf.d. To see if it is set in any of those files use :\ncat /etc/apt/apt.conf\ngrep -r proxy /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/\n\nIf you see any information regarding a proxy on those files, just edit it using sudo gedit <path_to_file> and comment that section using \"#\". To have a clue what you should be looking take a look at this answer.\nAfter this just do sudo apt-get update and it should be fixed. If not then you will have to inspect why it is using localhost as a mirror (are you connected to a proxy?).\n", "Q: Way to set a file as a Nautilus Bookmark? Nautilus allows user to set a Folder as a bookmark.\nI want to set a text file (that opens in Gedit) as a bookmark that will appear in the sidepane.

I tried manually adding a path to a text file to that file.  The text file showed up in the side pane in Nautilus, but clicking on it opened the folder containing the text file.  \n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu on separate partition using wubi, can I delete my Windows partition entirely?

Can I simply delete the partition where Windows is located? \nI'm using the Windows boot loader.\n\nA: If you wish to get rid of Windows altogether, it is best to do a fresh install using a live USB or live DVD.\nHowever if you wish to keep settings and applications already installed in Ubuntu you may consider migrating it.\nThis page explains how but in my opinion you're better off, backing up your data to an external drive and do a fresh install.\n", "Q: How to change \"File Type\" on upload to Ubuntu One Cloud Storage How do I change \"File Type\" on upload to Ubuntu One Cloud Storage.

I liked the Ubuntu 12.10, so i Downloaded it and and installed via WUBI, then it told me to restart my PC to complete the installation.

I just wanna use 12.10 nothing else, i have Vista Business installed on the C:/ Drive, And Ubuntu is installed on the F:/ Drive (F:/ubuntu). \n\nA: Shadow passwords are an enhancement to login security on Unix systems. Traditionally, passwords are kept in encrypted form in a world-readable table ( /etc/passwd ). To test a password, a program encrypts the given password with the same \"key\" (salt) that was used to encrypt the password stored in the /etc/passwd file (the salt is always given as the first two characters of the password). Because the encrypted passwords are not \"decryptable\", authentication takes place by comparison. If the /etc/passwd/ file password matches the encrypted login password, the user is granted access.\nMore reading HERE\n", "Q: How to find out where $MANPATH is set? How can I find out in which configuration file the environment variable $MANPATH is set? Is there a way to backtrace the values?\nI am aware of that I can grep through the whole file system using find or grep. I am using zsh most of the time instead of bash. I run Ubuntu Precise.\n\nA: As others already wrote Ubuntu doesn't set the MANPATH by default. You can edit your .profile and add the MANPATH as you like. But where does Ubuntu get the information about your manpath?\nThis information is set in /etc/manpath.config. The package man-db uses this information to configure the paths for man. The environment variable MANPATH has precedence over the file manpath.config. The file has the following (and probably more) entries:\nMANDATORY_MANPATH /usr/share/man\nMANPATH_MAP /usr/bin /usr/man\nDEFINE troff groff -mandoc\n\nThe  first line tells a software which automatically generates the MANPATH what directories it should contain. Typically /usr/man, /usr/share/man and other are set up here.\nNext is a mapping from the users PATH to the correct MANPATH. If a user has /usr/bin in his PATH, the MANPATH should contain /usr/man in my above example.\nThe DEFINE value has some default set of arguments and programs for pager utilities.\n\nA: Ubuntu by default doesn't set $MANPATH, so your search can be limited to your ~/.{ba,z}shrc and the files they include\nThe search path compiled into the man command can be seen with man -w. On my system (12.10), this returns /usr/local/man:/usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man\n\nA: Try running\nzsh -x -ls -c \"exit\" 2> shell-startup-output\n\nAfter running this command, the file shell-startup-output should show you each file being sourced when the shell starts.  You can then examine each of these files to see which one sets $MANPATH$.\nIf this doesn't work for you, the only other way I know to do it is to use grep or find.\n", "Q: How do I fix broken LibreOffice packages I have \"broken packages\" but when I attempt to fix them in Synaptic Package Manager, I get this error message:\ndpkg: unrecoverable fatal error, aborting:\n files list file for package `libreoffice-calc' contains empty filename\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)\nA package failed to install.

I displays ubuntu on the dual boot screen but after a while the screen shutdowns and say it didn't find the boot file or the boot file was missing?\nDo you guys know how to solve this problem? any suggestions? \n\nA: For Ubuntu with Windows 8 you need grub 2 bootloader because of secure boot of Windows 8. As I know only grub 2 can boot both. As DrA7 sayed, open Ubuntu Live session (from disk or usb) and install Boot-Repair. Then open this tool. This will repare your boot loader and after reboot you will be able to select both Ubuntu and Windows 8\n\nA: I would suggest trying Boot-Repair. There are detailed instructions on the site.\n\nA: I believe I have the answer for you as I recently went through exactly the same thing.

You also need to configure it to boot from USB in priority before the C: drive.\n\n*Install Ubuntu from a properly prepared USB boot stick (NOT DVD/CD) and NOT from WUBI which does not work on some UEFI 64 bit systems. This will allow you to call GRUB2.00 which offers Ubuntu as first choice when you boot the computer - it also gives you a Windows 8 option too.  Read and follow these details carefully.\n\n*Install and run the Boot Repair software that other solutions are recommending.  This will allow your PC to access GRUB2.00 directly without Windows 8 stealing the show on boot up. This is how I did it by following expert guidance from others.\n\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Making python 3.3 default python 3 interpreter instead of 3.2 So, to keep it simple. Ubuntu 12.10 has python 3.2 pre installed and it is linked to \"python3\". I downloaded python 3.3 and it's command is \"python3.3\". However, I downloaded pySide for python3 from synaptic. Using \"from PySide.QtCore import *\" fails on python3.3. BUT, when I ran just \"python3\" (aka 3.2) everything works fine. Synaptic just installed lib for python3.2 which is default for python3 in ubuntu. How can I force synaptic to install modules for python3.3?\nThanks\n\nA: You can custom your python3 alias. For this, you can modify your .bashrc file by appending \"alias python3='python3.3'\" at the end of it. This shell script can do it for you :\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd ~\n\n# Create the ~/.bashrc file if it does not exist\nif [ ! -f ./.bashrc ]; then\n    touch .bashrc\n    chmod 755 .bashrc\n    echo \"#!/bin/bash\" >> .bashrc\nfi\n\n# Append the customed alias\necho \" \" >> .bashrc\necho \"alias python3='python3.3'\" >> .bashrc\necho \" \" >> .bashrc\n\n# Reload settings in the .bashrc script\nsource .bashrc\n\n\nA: You may run different python versions on the same system by setting up the appropriate environment variables.  This would allow you to locally install a later version of Python than the synaptic package manager might offer. e.g.  in a file (mysetup) have:  \nTK_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk:/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/PIL:/usr/lib   \nTKPATH=/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk:/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/PIL:/usr/lib \nTCL_LIBRARY=/usr/lib \nexport TCL_LIBRARY TK_LIBRARY TKKPATH   \n\nexport PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk:/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-stdwin:/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload:/usr/lib:.     \n\nand put them into your environment with . mysetup\n\nA: Looking at the file list for a pyside package, it appears that it's only been compiled for Python 3.2. You can either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use 3.2 for now. 3.3 will probably be available with 13.04.\n\n*Download the source code for pyside (use apt-get source pyside), and recompile it for Python 3.3.\n\n", "Q: How to get permissions for all users for new drive added to the system - 12.10 I've added a new disk with a single ext4 partition and I want to use this as a shared multimedia drive /dev/sdd1 for all users and occasional samba users.  It seems to work ok while I am logged in as root, but I can't seem to add rwx permissions for others.  I've used nautilus under gksu to change the properties (permissions tab) for the Media Store folder in media/nick but it seems to make no difference on permissions for other users.\nDo I have to log into each of those other users, mount the drive with the super user permissions, then change the mount permissions for each users mount point folder?

Supposing /dev/sdd1 is mounted in /media/nick/Media Store\nsudo chgrp /media/nick/Media\\ Store my_media_group\nsudo chmod -R 2770 /media/nick/Media Store\n\nThe first command will change the group of that folder. The second will set rwx permissions to owner and group (770) and make new created files have the group of the parent folder (2). If you already have files in that folder, it may be needed to change their group also (it can be made with chgrp -R)\nLastly, for each one of the users in the system add it to that group:\nsudo usermod -a -G my_media_group <username>\n\nI haven't tried this, and it may not be the best way to do it, but if it doesn't work you should be able to go back using chgrp and chmod.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: You need to add an entry to fstab that will define how/where the drive mounts and the permissions allowed to other users.  Add to fstab:\nUUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx /media/nick/Media\\ Store ext4 umask=022,errors=remount-ro,user  0  2\n\nWhere UUID number is the UUID number of the drive you want to mount.\nIf your ext4 drive has a Label (appears to be possibly \"Media Store\") then you can use label instead of UUID eg:\nLABEL=Media\\ Store   /media/nick/Media\\ Store ext4 umask=022,errors=remount-ro,user 0  2\n\nA umask of 022 will allow anyone to create a new file, but only the owner (creator) and root will be able to change the file.\n", "Q: Is Rhythmbox able to queue tracks played while it is offline, to scrobble them later? I'm wondering if Rhythmbox is able to queue tracks played while it is offline, to submit them to Last.fm later when an internet connection becomes available.\nI think Banshee supports that.\n\nA: Yes, I tried it just now on Ubuntu 12.04.2 Live USB. I am still searching the cache file that saves the play counts, which is certainly needed for submitting to Last.fm server when the connection becomes available. \n", "Q: Failed to upgrade to Ubuntu 11.10 This error prevents the system from upgrading to a newer version of Ubuntu, what is causing it?\n W: Failed to fetch http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/source/Sources      404  Not Found\n\n W: Failed to fetch http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\n E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nSince I got the warning message that this release is not supported anymore, should I download and install Ubuntu 12.10 directly from Ubuntu's site instead?\n\nA: Fortunately it's only the extras repo that's not working. You can disable that in the software sources application or by editing the relevant file in /etc/apt. After that, the upgrade to 11.10 should work. It's also advisable to upgrade to 12.04 LTS after upgrading to 11.10 as 11.10 is only supported for a few more months and 12.04 LTS for at least 2 4 (see below) more years (and a few months).\n", "Q: Will all device driver software work with Linux? For example, I write my own device driver for a specific device, any kind really, such as maybe a wireless USB mouse or the like ... how do I add it to the Linux kernel?\nWill the kernel support drivers? How would this process go about?\nNot too familiar with Linux's kernel system...\n\nA: A driver is nothing more than a loadable ELF object file, similar to a normal library. Once your driver code has been compiled into such a file, you can load it with the same tools as you use for other drivers (insmod or modprobe). I'd recommend you read Linux Kernel Programming or LDD3 for much more information about what you actually need to do. You'll find that loading the driver is actually the easy bit :)\n", "Q: Are Windows partitions gone? I had Windows 7 on my laptop (factory setting), because of some performance issues, I decided to use recovery options to restore it to its factory condition but I don't know what has happened or what I have done that the whole operating system was gone after playing around with recovery options from the boot menu. I couldn't find Windows, so I installed Ubuntu 11.04 on my laptop. Last time I had Ubuntu on it, it was not really compatible with laptop's configuration and I had a bit of problems trying to do normal tasks I used to do on Windows.

I had imagined the simplest way to compare the contents of two similar directories would be something like \ndiff `ls old` `ls new`\n\nBut I see why this doesn't work; diff is being handed a big long list of files on the command line, rather than two streams like I had hoped.  How do I pass the two outputs to diff directly?\n\nA: I often use the technique described in the accepted answer:\ndiff <(ls old) <(ls new)\n\nbut I find I usually use it with much more complex commands than the example above. In such cases it can be annoying to craft the diff command. I have come up with some solutions that others may find useful.\nI find that 99% of the time I try out the relevant commands before running diff. Consequently the commands I want to diff are right there in my history ... why not use them?\nI make use of the Fix Command (fc) bash builtin to execute the last two commands:\n$ echo A\nA\n$ echo B\nB\n$ diff --color <( $(fc -ln -1 -1) ) <( $(fc -ln -2 -2 ) )\n1c1\n< B\n---\n> A\n\nThe fc flags are:\n\n-n: No number. It suppresses the command numbers when listing.\n-l: Listing: The commands are listed on standard output.\n\nthe -1 -1 refer to the start and end position in the history, in this case its from the last command to the last command which yields just the last command.\nLastly we wrap this in $() to execute the command in a subshell.\nObviously this is a bit of a pain to type so we can create an alias:\nalias dl='diff --color <( $(fc -ln -1 -1) ) <( $(fc -ln -2 -2 ) )'\n\nOr we can create a function:\ndl() {\n    if [[ -z \"$1\" ]]; then\n        first=\"1\"\n    else\n        first=\"$1\"\n    fi\n    if [[ -z \"$2\" ]]; then\n        last=\"2\"\n    else\n        last=\"$2\"\n    fi\n    # shellcheck disable=SC2091\n    diff --color <( $(fc -ln \"-$first\" \"-$first\") ) <( $(fc -ln \"-$last\" \"-$last\") )\n}\n\nwhich supports specifying the history lines to use. After using both I find the alias is the version I prefer.\n\nA: Command substitution `…` substitutes the output of the command into the command line, so diff sees the list of files in both directories as arguments. What you want is for diff to see two file names on its command line, and have the contents of these files be the directory listings. That's what process substitution does.\ndiff <(ls old) <(ls new)\n\nThe arguments to diff will look like /dev/fd/3 and /dev/fd/4: they are file descriptors corresponding to two pipes created by bash. When diff opens these files, it'll be connected to the read side of each pipe. The write side of each pipe is connected to the ls command.\n\nA: Fish shell\nIn Fish shell you have to pipe into psub. Here is an example of heroku and dokku config comparison with Beyond Compare:\nbcompare (ssh me@myapp.pl dokku config myapp | sort | psub) (heroku config -a myapp | sort | psub)\n\n\nA: For zsh, using =(command) automatically creates a temporary file and replaces =(command) with the path of the file itself. With Command Substitution, $(command) is replaced with the output of the command.\nSo there are three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command Substitution: $(...) \n\n*Process Substitution: <(...)\n\n*zsh-Flavored Process Substitution: =(...)\nzsh flavored process subsitution, #3, is very useful and can be used like so to compare the output of two commands using a diff tool, for example Beyond Compare:\nbcomp  =(ulimit -Sa | sort) =(ulimit -Ha | sort)\n\nFor Beyond Compare, note that you must use bcomp for the above (instead of bcompare) since bcomp launches the comparison and waits for it to complete.  If you use bcompare, that launches comparison and immediately exits due to which the temporary files created to store the output of the commands disappear.\nRead more here: http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_7.html\nAlso notice this:\n\nNote that the shell creates a temporary file, and deletes it when the command is finished.\n\nand the following which is the difference between the two types of Process substitution supported by zsh (i.e #2 and #3):\n\nIf you read zsh's man page, you may notice that <(...) is another form of process substitution which is similar to =(...). There is an important difference between the two. In the <(...) case, the shell creates a named pipe (FIFO) instead of a file. This is better, since it does not fill up the file system; but it does not work in all cases. In fact, if we had replaced =(...) with <(...) in the examples above, all of them would have stopped working except for fgrep -f <(...). You can not edit a pipe, or open it as a mail folder; fgrep, however, has no problem with reading a list of words from a pipe. You may wonder why diff <(foo) bar doesn't work, since foo | diff - bar works; this is because diff creates a temporary file if it notices that one of its arguments is -, and then copies its standard input to the temporary file.\n\nReference: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/393349/difference-between-subshells-and-process-substitution\n", "Q: Function keys on an external keyboard So I bought a keyboard for my laptop. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the function key (though I know many people say it's useless). On my laptop, I control volume with the function key and F9-11.

The advanced keyboard settings don't have an option related to the function key.\nMore specifically, it would be great if I could map it to my 'Menu' key which I'm never going to use.\nOr is there a way to get full functionality without it?\n\nA: If you open the keyboard settings, then click the 'shortcuts' tab, then select the \"sound & media\" page, you can change the shorcut for mute, up and down.

The following is from this file:\n\nIf you are using PostScript fonts that are not packaged for \n      Debian, some changes have been done: updmap now reads all\n      updmap.cfg files it finds. That means, the easiest way to\n      activate local fonts (in TEXMFLOCAL) by putting the respective\n      map lines into /usr/local/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg, and \n      call updmap-sys once (as root). If you have fonts in your\n      home directory you want to activate, paralleling the above\n      you put the respective map line into $HOME/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg\n      and call updmap (as user). But be reminded that you have to\n      do that everytime system fonts have changed (there is no \n      automatic syncronization between user specific and system wide\n      updmap(-sys) generated files).\n\nIn your case it should be sufficient to install the latest version of lmodern, which is 2.004.2-1 for Quantal. After that you run update-updmap and the warnung should disappear.\n", "Q: Default folder deleted - can not change back keybinding theme I accidently removed Default folder from /usr/share/themes and now can not change the Keybindig theme back to default under advanced setting -> theme. Default option is simply gone, not there anymore. Couldn't get it back... \nI am using Ubuntu 12.04 with Gnome shell.\nAny thoughts on what can bring this option back?\nThanks!\n\nA: Open a terminal and enter\ndpkg -S /usr/share/themes/Default\n\nThe command shows you which packages use (and create) this directory. In my case the output is: libgtk1.2-common, libgtk2.0-common: /usr/share/themes/Default.\nSo the best idea would be to reinstall both packages:\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install libgtk1.2-common libgtk2.0-common \n\nSo they create the directory and fill it with the correct content.\n\nA: I better not ask how and why did you delete it, but anyways, probably you could:\n1: reinstall system (aka: upgrade to the same version)\n2: get the /usr/share folder from another installation, or from the liveCD/DVD\n3: create the folder, and add a new theme\nHope that helps, good luck!\nCheers!\n", "Q: 403 Forbidden for /home/my-username/Dropbox/Hemsidor as directory root I'm trying setup Apache to point the directory root to /home/my-username/Dropbox/Hemsidor but when I go to localhost I got 403 Forbidden. I don't have any .htaccess file in the home directory (Hemsidor) so I don't know what the problem is. I have tested to add Options +FollowSymLinks -SymLinksIfOwnerMatch in my httpd.conf file and then restarted Apache but with no luck.\nWhat's wrong?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Set the user and group of the directory as www-data via chown and chgrp command\n", "Q: I can't watch youtube videos in either Firefox or Chromium. version 12.04 I can't watch youtube videos in either chromium browser or firefox. I've tried installing a plugin or flash player, but neither seem to work. I'm new to Ubuntu and I'm not real experienced on working on computers.\n\nA: Ok, I found the fix! I uninstalled the Adobe flash player, and now it works. Not sure why, but now I can watch YouTube videos in either Firefox or Chrome, and websites that require flash work now as well. On YouTube, it still asks you to install a plugin, but then it plays it anyway. Thanks for all the help!\n\nA: I must admit that it is difficult to find a good browser that plays flash. So I installed this one https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/ and am much happier with the performance. \n\nA: Installing ubuntu-restricted-extras  fixed the problem for me. Click the above link to install it using Software Centre or use the command below to install using the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n", "Q: How do I reset the grub configuration files in /etc/grub.d? I have been changing my grub menu to allow the use of an arch system that I am dual booting, but I managed to get rid of the ubuntu advanced options, so I want to reset the config files in /etc/grub.d to the default ones, but I am not sure what I can do short of reinstalling ubuntu.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you dorked the grub...it's an easy fix. \nFirst here are the Grub docs https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2\nSecond here are the boot repair docs https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\n\nA: Another (brute force) option, if other methods fail, is to apt download grub-pc and manually extract the config files into the corresponding locations.\n", "Q: How to restore Ubuntu data after install windows 7? I have installed windows 7. I have lost my all data which were in ubuntu. Now want to get my all previous data. I have installed windows 7 in other partition. Ubuntu partition lost all data if it is possible that I restore Ubuntu please tell me.\n\nA: If you have installed Windows on another partition (and not formated your Ubuntu partition), you should be able to boot a live-cd and reinstall the boot loader (grub) from there - you can find tutorials for \"grub reinstall\" online.\nThis looks good, actually:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n", "Q: launcher settings? Hi my name is Jim Simoni. I wish there was some way to relate to the desktop to the old desk top with menus so this transition would be easier. I like the old organisation in the menu bar. I had places, applications, system and others I have forgotten. I need the list to make the transfer to the new system. Can some one tell me how to look or get a list of all the organization menue it had?\nMy problem though is that I can not find any setting that control the launcher. The quide says in settings appearance there should be a slider that controls the size of the icons. I can not find it. I don't know if my theme makes it invisible? Can someone help I can't find it.\nJim\n\nA: If you like the old style desktop you might install the gnome-session-fallback package via Ubuntu Software Center, but beware that this package isn't the Gnome 2.x desktop, but simply a fallback of Gnome 3.x.\nif you wish to customize Unity (and not only the size of launcher's icons) you might install ubuntu tweak; in this case, you have to proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a Terminal window and type:\nsudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update -y\nsudo apt-get install -y ubuntu-tweak\n\n\n*When the installation process will be ended, launch the System settings and you'll find the icon of ubuntu tweak.\n\n\nA: When you open the appearance settings the slider is at the bottom.\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.10 won't see my external hard drive So here's the story: I installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my acer aspire 7551 last night without a hitch. I have two hard drives from my now out-of-service desktop that was running windows 7 that I'm trying to copy and backup to the laptop so I can then export them to my external HD. This external is detected and everything, but when I put my hard drives from my desktop in the external case to export the files, Ubuntu doesn't see them.

How could I add an applet to the MATE panel from the Terminal using mateconftool-2. I'm specifically asking for DockBarX, but I'd like to add other applets as well (MATEnu, Notification area and Clock).\nWhat I want to do is instead of manually right-clicking the panel, opening the Add to Panel window and selecting the applet, do this from the command line.\nHow can this be done with mateconftool-2?\nEdit: I've found that it can be done with this /usr/lib/mate-panel/mate-panel-add however I don't know yet how I can add an applet with it.\nThis for example would add a gedit launcher to the panel:\n/usr/lib/mate-panel/mate-panel-add --launcher=/usr/share/applications/gedit.desktop\n\nI want to do that but instead of a launcher an applet.\n/usr/lib/mate-panel/mate-panel-add --applet=  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Something like this but I don't know how to add the rest (in this case call the DockbarX applet).\n\n\nA: As MATE is a fork of GNOME2 and most of its components are simply the old GNOME2 with their names changed, I'm assuming mate-panel-add works the same as gnome-panel-add used to. You need to do something along the lines of:\n/usr/lib/gnome-panel/mate-panel-add --applet=OAFIID:MATE_DockBarXApplet --panel=top_panel_screen0 --position=500\n\nWhere the value of --panel= is one of the panels found in mateconf found with something like:\nmateconftool-2 --all-dirs /apps/panel/toplevels\n\nThe --applet identifier can be found in the /usr/lib/matecomponent/servers/ directory.

Then you'd install with dpkg -i. I'd say it's fairly likely that you may miss a package or two and end up with uninstallable packages, so if you're not sure what you're doing, I'd suggest not doing this.\nOne alternative, you could also use gdebi to install the debs once you copy them. gdebi will figure out what dependencies you need, dpkg will not until it tries the install, and apt can't install local files.  gdebi is not installed by default, so you'd need to download it first.\n\nA: So if you have the same packages as you friend do with same version of preparing system . \nfirst you need to grab them from the location mentioned in previous answer . then place the packages in the same location in your pc . \nthen you can do the thing in two ways . \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo aptitude upgrade \n\n*cd to the directory where you placed the packages and do like \n\n\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb . \nit will install all the packages . hope that helps .\n", "Q: Mount ecryptfs automatically after ftp login How can I get my ubuntu server 12.04 to automatically mount the encrypted home partition after an ftp login? It will automatically mount after an ssh login and I can then access the encrypted information over ftp but I don't want to have to log into ssh every time I want to use ftp.\n\nA: When you login into your system, either directly or via ssh, it is usually the pam_ecryptfs module that takes care of automatically mounting your encrypted home.\nThis module will use your password to decrypt a better key (referred to as passphrase in the docs) and make your encrypted home directory available.\nSetting up pam_ecryptfs for FTP logins seems like a really bad idea, though. FTP sends passwords (and data) in clear text. This means that anyone on your network will be able to steal your password and be able to decrypt your data.\nI would either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not use FTP. Use sftp, scp, putty, winscp, whatever, based on ssh.\n\n*If you have to use FTP, I would not encrypt the data at all. Assume that once you do the first transfer, anyone will be able to access it anyway. Or create a subdirectory where you keep data available via FTP.\n\n\nIf you really really want to enable mounting encrypted directories automatically with ftp, you can add a line like:\nauth    required        pam_ecryptfs.so unwrap\nin /etc/pam.d/proftpd, assuming your FTP server is proftp. \nIf you use this and it works, please tell us you are using a VPN or a socks proxy over an SSL tunnel or ssh.

As usual, I just double-clicked the file and then Install, without problems. But, when I tried to do the same in another PC with Xubuntu 11.10 32-bit, it simply does nothing. I installed gnome-font-viewer to try it (I know Xubuntu uses Xfce, but nothing worked). So, do anyone know how to install a font in Xubuntu 32-bit? Will I need another kind of font viewer?\n\nA: After installing gnome-font-viewer, opening the font with it and clicking 'Install Font' should do the trick for the current user.\nAlternatively, you can just copy the fonts to the ~/.fonts directory.\nIf you want to make the font available system-wide, copy the font files to /usr/share/fonts and then run sudo mkfontdir.\n\nA: Thanks to both for your answers. But I tried that and it didn't work. I couldn't install the font. And when I copied the font in the .fonts folder it simple didn't do nothing. I tried different stuff, but nothing worked. I solved this problem from the Software Center, I got into the Fonts section and I typed OCR (the font i was wanting to install) and it appeared only one option. It was what I was looking for.

I.E. VNC will use more bandwidth than just browsing the web.

Only reason I'm preferring perl is that I know its regular expression syntax better. The following line should do what you want:\nperl -0777 -i.bak -pe 's/(body {.*?background-color.*?)#.{6}/$1#000000/si;' ./style.css\n\n-0777 means split on nothing, so slurp in whole file (instead of line by line, the default for -p)\n-i.bak means alter files in place, leaving original with extension .bak (default for -p is to just print)\n-p means pass line by line (except we are slurping) to passed code (see -e)\n-e expects code to run.\nExplaining the regular expression is beyond the scope of my answer, but there are many tutorials out there like this one for example.\nBe sure to check the results as I can easily imagine css files which would cause problems with this expression. For example having selectors which contain the word body might cause problems...\n\nA: I would try for awk:\ngawk -v RS='}[[:space:]]*' '/^body[[:space:]]*{/ { \n  printf \"%s%s\", gensub (/background-color:[^;]*;/, \"background-color: #000000;\", 1), RT\n}'\n\nThis requires GNU awk (but can be done without it as well).\n\n\n*\n\n*We set the record separator to } followed by any amount of whitespace.\n\n*Then we can match body { to the beginning of the record.\n\n*And substitute background-color: #000000; for the first instance of background-color. Replace 1 with g to match all instances.\n\n*RT contains the text matched by the record separator. If we used a fixed string (}) instead of a regular expression, we could use ORS instead. RT needs GNU awk.\n\n*GNU awk also has an in-place editing plugin. Use gawk -i inplace ...\nTruly speaking, this is not a job for regular expressions or record parsers. Something that understands the CSS language should be used.\n", "Q: Cat 6 Only 100mbit speed I tried two different cat6 cables directly connected between my two ubuntu machines. This one I ordered online:\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002SQPDXS/ref=wms_ohs_product\nonly achieves 100mbit speeds, but does appear to be supporting cross-talk (direct pc to pc), the other cat 6 cable, worked perfectly and gets the full 1gigabit speed. \nBoth tests were performed using ftp and checking the network monitor with direct pc to pc connection.\nWas the product description incorrect or do I need to manually set a setting somewhere in ubuntu for some cables? I had thought 10 quid for 20m of gigabit ethernet cable was a bit cheap, you get what you pay for.\n\nUpdate:\nIt seems that after rebooting, the device is set to 1000mbit sec when looking it up with \nsudo ethtool eth0\n\nHowever after a while, this will drop down to just 100, after which to reset it to 1000 again, I have to reboot, and simply unplugging and re-plugging in the cable doesn't do it.\nI tried setting this in networking config file as suggested here:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\npre-up /usr/sbin/ethtool -s eth0 speed 1000 duplex full\n\nbut that resulted in my networking failing to start. Is there a problem with my 'auto-negotiation'?

I am assuming there is a problem with my auto-negotiation on the network. I realise, that networking speeds/issues depend on a lot of factors but it really does appear that overriding a configuration did the trick for me. \nHopefully this post will be useful to others who notice their cat6 connections start getting capped at 100mbit. There is probably another problem on the network and I have only fixed the 'symptom'.\n\nA: This is a complicated question, with no simple answers ..\nAny point-to-point transfer has to factor in all the possible elements that may limit speed, affect latency, or simply stop things from performing anywhere close to theoretical maximum.\nI could probably make some educated guesses, at what might be causing your variance with different cables. But, that would take considerable time and require a lot more information that you have yet to supply.\nAlso, probably off subject for this forum.\n\nHere is someone else's answer(s):\nWhirlpool.net.au > Gigabit .. whats the actual transfer speed\n\nGigabit is up to 125MB/s\n\nThat is just maths, based on a theoretical 1 Gigabit/second, and 8bits in a byte.\n\nYou will never get 125MB/sec over gig eth. For a few reasons.\n1) TCP overheads. Highest you'll ever see in an ideal world is around 100MB/sec.\n2) Disk throughput. Your disk is likely to be the slowest link in the chain here – seek speeds, access speeds, they all play a part.\n3) Machine I/O. If your PC is under load this will likely have an impact on transfer speeds.\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 13\" Retina (10,2): Keyboard and Touchpad don't work correcltly I'm dealing with Ubuntu since about 5 years and installed it on several laptops.

The only way to boot into Windows is by having the external HDD attached.\nIs there any way I can make it so I won't have to have the external HDD attached to be able to boot my Windows 7?\n\nA: When you installed Ubuntu, it placed the Grub bootloader on your internal drive MBR, but all the grub modules are stored on your Ubuntu partition, on the external drive. Grub won't let you do much if it cannot load the modules, so, without the external plugged in you cannot boot anything.\nWhat you should have done is to leave the Windows bootloader on the internal drive, and installed Grub to the external. Then whenever you plug in the external, just override at startup to boot from the external.\nTo install Grub to the external MBR (assuming it's /dev/sdb):\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdb\n\nTo get Windows booting without the external, reinstall the Windows bootloader. To do this boot from a Windows 7 repair CD or the Windows Installation DVD to a repair prompt and run:\nbootrec /fixmbr\n\nYou can make a Windows Repair CD from Windows if you don't have one.

So why am I running Linux? Because Windows was driving me nuts and my friend managed to convince me. day-to-day operations, we're doing fine, but when it comes to problems, I've got no clue what I'm doing!)\nSo here's what's going on, my machine is an HP pavilion dv6, my optical drive is a standard cd/dvdrw, when i load an audio cd of any type (burned, official, etc,..) I have no problems, when I pop in a dvd - i get nothing. the dvd icon comes up in my launch tray, when I open VLC player I can find the dvd in the folder... but it won't play. I can watch movies I've downloaded with no problem, I can also watch movies off an external hard drive.\nThe only thing I've tried is removing VLC and reinstalling, and I tried installing a different player (gnome maybe?

Also, did you install libdvdcss? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/PlayingDVDs\n\nA: A reason for this could be that you have not installed the codecs for reading encrypted DVD's. Go to the Ubuntu Software Center and look for 'libdvdcss' and 'libdvdread4' and install them.\nAs far as I know they are not installed by default, since it is based on closed source and therefore not in the philosophy of open-source software.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread but i couldnt find a more up-to-date one, thaat i could reply on. I am running ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and couldnt get DVDs to run after reinstalling the operating system.

I woke up for a second just to see a black screen which I closed. Upon awakening I lifted the laptop screen (totally addicted to it) and heard voices before logging in. So does Youtube playlists roll on when Ubuntu is suspended or did it just start over from where it suspended? Have I been downloading all night or...??? \n\nA: Suspend is something similar to hibernation BUT the system remains switched on and powered up...\nI strongly believe when u'll suspend your system, the videos on Youtube will halt right away. And once u come back, they will start from the same position u left off !\nSecondly, if you have merely logged out, then your background applications do continue to run. hence your youtube will continue to play even when u'll log out.\nNote: This happens with my system having only one account.

I download and import videos from various website and devices. I also view them on various devices requiring different formats. \nI want to convert my videos into a single base format, then convert them from there to the various formats required for viewing.\nHendre \n\nA: Rather that directly answer your question I think I'll just point out that this is probably a bad idea.\nIf you are converting between different codecs, this will involve not only a deterioration in quality but also potentially wasted disk space, since each codec has its own characteristics at a given bitrate.  That is, it's possible to transcode from format A to B and have a larger file size but reduced visual quality.  Transcoding between two different lossy compression algorithms will never improve the image quality, nor retain the same image quality, only degrade it by varying degrees.  So it doesn't make sense to do such transcoding between formats unless the benefits outweigh this quality degradation.\nI'd advise keeping the videos in their original format, and only converting them when there are significant benefits to doing so, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the videos are at a very high bitrate and you cannot afford the disk space; you want to use a significantly lower bitrate - in which case you don't care about the reduction in quality.\n\n*When the videos are in a format that is not supported by computers or devices you own or are in a \"dead\" format nobody is likely to use anymore - in which case the reduction in quality is unavoidable in order for the videos to remain compatible.\n\n*When you are outputting to a specific target, such as authoring a DVD disc - in which case the reduction in quality is again unavoidable.\nIn all other cases, why not retain videos in their original format?\n", "Q: Is Gnome-Session-Fallback getting updates? I am using gnome-session-fallback, which fairly resembles GNOME2.\nI typed the gnome-session --version command and here is the output:\n$ gnome-session --version\n\ngnome-session 3.6.0\n\nMy question is: Does that mean that it will get updates and bug fixes in the future or is the fallback session old and obsolete technology?\n\nA: That output just shows the package version, and nothing else. \nTo get the idea of the current level of support for the fallback session, consider this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The fallback session maintainer, Vincent Untz, has recently left Gnome to take the position of the OpenSuse chairman.\n\n*It's been announced, that the fallback mode will be droped from Gnome 3.8 onward.\nThat said, Gnome2 will still be supported, for quite some time, by the distros that default to it, most notably, RHEL and its derivatives (CentOS and Scientific Linux), as well as Debian 6, and, perhaps some other.\nThe point is, if you have the right hardware and like Gnome2, there is no reason not to use it for a long time to come.\n\nA: Well, the GNOME team is introducing a new Fallback Mode in GNOME 3.8 that looks pretty sweet, actually. :) Also, MATE is basically a rebadged GNOME 2.\nIf you wanna install GNOME 3.8, including the new Classic mode, to try it out, pull up a terminal type in the following command chain:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3 && apt-get update &&\napt-get upgrade && apt-get install gnome-shell gnome-shell-extensions\n\nHowever you can also give Cinnamon a shot, I used it for a while, before finally settling on (at least for now) MATE, and it's just a gorgeous desktop environment, and highly recommended.

I want to make this file as application/x-executable file. How can I make it?\n\nA: Run: \nchmod +x /path/to/file.sh\n\nTo make it un-executable, run:\nchmod -x /path/to/file.sh\n\nFor example i created .sh file:\nvi tester12.sh\n\nAfter i write some code on vi editor, i'll exit from vi editor:\n:wq!\nchmod +x tester12.sh\n./tester12.sh\n\n\nA: There are two ways of making a file executable:\nGUI Method:\nRight-click the file and select Properties.\nGo to the permissions tab, then tick the box Execute: [ ] Allow executing file as program or in Nautilus Program: [ ] Allow this file to run as a program in Thunar.\n\nTerminal / Command method:\nYou can either use:\ncd /to/my/required/directory\nThen run\nchmod +x filename.extension\nOr just run:\nchmod +x /path/to/your/filename.extension\nchmod does also have some more advanced options:\nThe spaces are to show that it is split up: - rwx --- ---\nThe first set of --- is User. The second is Group and the last is Other (anyone else)\nr stands for Read, w for Write and x for eXecute.\nSo to allow everyone to read it, but only Group to execute and User to read and write it (but for some reason not execute) would be:\n-rw- rx- r-- But this would be added to the command as:\nchmod +rw-rx-r-- /path/to/file.extension\nchmod also can do this in numbers. It is based on binary (I think, as it is 1,2 and 4)\nSo there are these numbers:\nExecute by user is 100.\nExecute by group is 010.\nExecute by other is 001.\nWrite by user is 200.\nWrite by group is 020.\nWrite by other is 002.\nRead by user is 400.\nRead by group is 040.\nRead by other is 004.\nThen you add these together to get the desired combination.\nSo to allow everyone to read it, but only Group to execute and User to write it (but for some reason not execute) would be:\n400 + 040 + 004 and 010 and 200\nThat adds up to 600 + 050 + 004 = 654.\nYou could then run the command.\nchmod +654 /path/to/file.extension to set it.\nAnd to set all permissions you can type:\nchmod +rwxrwxrwx /path/to/file.extension\nOr (this is a bit easier to write, but harder to remember each one):\nchmod +777 /path/to/file.extension\nFinally, you can do:\nchmod -777 /path/to/file.extension\nTo take all permissions away from everyone.\nAnd:\nchmod +300 /path/to/file.extension\nTo add read and write for user, without affecting any other permissions (e.g. Execute permissions).\nThis website has a very useful little grid checkbox thing, whereby you can tick the options you want and it gives you the command:\n\nHowever, not all the possible combinations are sensible to use; the main ones that are used are the following:\n755 - Owner has all, and Group and Other can read and execute\n700 - Owner has all\n644 - Owner can read and write, and Group and Other can read\n600 - Owner can read and write\nAnd, if you're using non-trivial user groups:\n775 - Owner can read and write, and Group and Other can read\n770 - Owner and Group have all, and Other can read and execute\n750 - Owner has all, and Group can read and execute\n664 - Owner and Group can read and write, and Other can just read\n660 - Owner and Group can read and write\n640 - Owner can read and write, and Group can read\n777 and 666 are rarely used, except in /tmp.\nThanks Ilmari Karonen for pointing out the ones in common usage!\n\nA: You can mark the file as executable:\nchmod +x filename.sh\n\nYou can then execute it like this:\n./filename.sh\n\nIf you want to use a different command to start it, you can add an alias:\ngedit ~/.bashrc\n\nAdd this at the end of the file:\nalias <new name>='/home/<full path to script>/filename.sh'\n\nOpen a new terminal session or type source ~/.bashrc in your terminal to apply.\nThen simply use the new name to start the script.\n\nA: Let all users run your script\nAs stated you can set the execution bit of the file to make it executable with chmod +x.

Also the file name changes color to green on most systems.\n\n\n\nRun a script without making it executable\nYou can still run a bash script without making it executable. For example:\n$ echo \"echo Hello World\" > file_command.txt\n\n$ cat file_command.txt\necho Hello World\n\n$ bash file_command.txt\nHello World\n\nNOTES:\n\n*\n\n*First we create a script containing echo Hello World.\n\n*Then we confirm the script called file_command.txt is correct.\n\n*Lastly we run the script by calling bash and passing it the script name. The bashcommand is actually store as /bin/bash and it is an executable on all Ubuntu systems.\n\n*Creating a file of commands saves you from adding the shebang #!/bin/bash as the first line in a script.\n\n*Creating a file of commands saves you from making it executable with chmod +x or chmod a+x.\n\n", "Q: Evolution: Work week Print Layout only prints 5-days and not 7-Days Some of us work 7 days (well, we like to 'map out' out week 7 days) and not 5 days. I used to like MS Outlook (pre Vista) for being able to print out my planned forthcoming 7 days scheduled week and throw a printed copy on my office door. Now I've moved 100% Ubuntu I like using Evolution as it is a 'close' clone to MS Outlook and really does everything I need. I don't really want to move/change to another Diary application, and don't really want add any external functionality (Google apps etc).\nWhen I come to print out the 'Work Week' in Evolution, my 7-day screen view only appears as a 5-day view, pretty annoying and from all the Prefs, I cannot find a way to print out 7-day view other than an alternative work week view, which simply doesn't show the days in detail.\nIs this an App design fault, an omission, or something that can't be done in Evo 3.6x compared to MS Outlook (ala pre Vista) or something I'm missing as a whole, as I cannot find any templates etc to meet my needs? FYI, I'm on Ubuntu 12.10 with Evo 3.6x.\nComments on how/if it can be changed. Thanks.\n\nA: Simply select all days as work days from the preferences.

I got curious today, and ran vrms to check which non-free packages I had.\nTo my great surprise, no kernel packages appeared. \nIt used to be the case that the kernel contained some small non-free bits (like firmware) that made the package unfree.\nI am wondering, now, if vrms is lying, or if all the non-free bits are out of the package?\n\nA: No, ubuntu kernel is not 100% free, It includes some non free kernel blobs. \nsource: http://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html (just look for ubuntu)\nThere is an another distro called gNewsense which is based on ubuntu but removed all traces of non free components. \nFor a list of 100% free distributions, look at http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html\n\nA: For the record, just what constitutes \"free software\" is to some degree up to interpretation. The FSF has the strictest guidelines for what counts as free software, but Debian is slightly looser than the FSF on what it will accept. vrms is based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines, and accordingly some packages that the Debian developers are ok with won't show up when you run it. vrms is not \"lying\", it's giving you its interpretation of what non-free packages you have installed. \nAlthough I'm personally of the opinion that it's a very useful tool, the FSF doesn't endorse vrms because although it uses RMS' name, it doesn't follow his guidelines. Not only does it miss some software they consider non-free, but it also at times flags packages (mostly documentation) written by the GNU project itself.\n", "Q: eCryptfs problems after inapproriate shut down - unable to access my /home folder? Here is what happened to me a few days ago. I was watching a movie in bed and when I turned I accidently pulled the electric plug from my PC and it turned off inappropriately. \nWhen I turned it back on, it took forever trying to fix a major error, it didn't manage to fix it, I ignored the errors. It kept loading and I got to the Ubuntu login page. I entered my password and pressed enter, the screen went black and when it came back, I was where I had been: the login page asking me to enter my password again. \nIt is stuck in a loop, every time I write my password it goes back to asking me my password. I can't access my session. From the guest session, I tried to access my home, I was able to using console ctrl+alt+f1. Using the ls -al command, I found that my /home/ was empty except for a few folders. \nThe present folders are:\n.cache\n.ecryptfs\n.face\n.Private\nREADME.txt\n\nI suspected that through the hard shut down the eCryptfs got corrupted and is preventing me from accessing my encrypted files. I can't remember if I had configured a passphrase and if I did, I don't remember what it is. Of course I remember my login password.\nAt this point, I want to either retrieve my data and then I will format and reinstall or simply have the eCryptfs corrupt files fixed and avoid formatting anything.\nI can provide you with any additional information if you need it to help me.\n\nA: For recent versions of Ubuntu, if you set your account up to use an encrypted home directory during the initial setup, it will have set up a directory called /home/.ecryptfs/[your_user_name]. This directory will have two subdirectories, .Private and .ecryptfs. The encrypted files that get mounted to your home directory will be kept in .Private; .ecryptfs has the wrapped passphrase and other configuration files used by ecryptfs.\nWhen you login to your computer, your encrypted files in /home/.ecryptfs/[your_user_name]/.Private get mounted to /home/[your_user_name] automatically, using your login password to unwrap your ecryptfs password and use that to mount the encrypted files correctly, so you can access your home directory securely.\nSince your hard drive crashed. ecryptfs has not been working correctly. This could be due to corruption of some of the encrypted data in /home/.ecryptfs/[your_user_name], or more likely, corruption to some of the system files that run linux, so that the ecryptfs system (or some related system) no longer runs correctly.\nAs a quick aside - a couple things to note here: first, things like this are reasons why its important to back up your data. Second, if you're using encrypted home directories, it's also a good idea to keep a copy of the unwrapped passphrase used to encrypt your home directory in a safe, secure place, not on that computer (you can see what that passphrase is by running \necryptfs-unwrap-passphrase ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase\n\n...and entering your login password when prompted). This unwrapped passphrase can be of help if you need to recover the encrypted data later.\nIf you need to recover your encrypted data from your hard disk--you can do so with the \necryptfs-recover-private\n\ncommand. For example, if you run\necryptfs-recover-private /home/.ecryptfs/[your_user_name]/.Private\n\n...you will be prompted for your login password (or for the unwrapped passphrase if no wrapped-passphrase file is available). Your encrypted home directory will then be mounted at /tmp/ecryptfs.XXXXXXXX (type df to see the exact directory name). You can then access this directory to get your home directory data, and copy it to another disk.\nNote that if you copy the directory /home/.ecryptfs/[your_user_name] to another computer, you can still run ecryptfs-recover-private as above on the new computer and recover the data there.\nSo in a case where a hard disk is damaged and an encrypted home directory can no longer be accessed, you might typically want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your system from a live CD \n\n*Mount the partition with /home\n\n*Copy the /home/.ecryptfs/[your_user_name] directory to the safe hard\ndisk you want to save the data to. You could use rsync, or cp -a if\nthe safe hard disk is also mounted.\n\n*Use ecryptfs-recover-private to recover the data from the copied\ndirectory on the safe hard disk.\n\n\nA: try ls /usr/share/xsessions/\nif you see a unity.desktop or similar file there, do the following sudo apt-get install --reinstall unity\nhope that fixes your log in issue.\n", "Q: how to use ubuntu desktop as a mail server?

But I wish to receive and store message from others or from my coding via internet.So, I wish to know how to use ubuntu as my mail server ? Please reply me...\nThank all geeks.\n\nA: There are several mailservers to choose from. Full featured beasts like postfix or sendmail for example.

Therefore you have to continue the installation without internet connection and than use the jockey driver program to install the driver for the dongle and than continue to install what you need.\n\nA: You need to save the  firmware for the dongle somewhere in your device in order to install it with a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) before clicking the install button.\nOtherwise you will need a cable connection in order to connect to the network inevitably.\n", "Q: Generate a diff between current /etc/ and default configuration After installation and various custom configurations, is it possible to use eg. apt and some shell-fu to produce a diff for every file in /etc/ that differs from the standard configuration? This would provide a means to generate a short summary of the configuration state after the fact, rather than having to rely on manual logging along the way, should one desire to remember what was changed at a later time.\n\nA: You should take a look to etckeeper : \n\netckeeper is a collection of tools to let /etc be stored in a git,\n  mercurial, darcs, or bzr repository. It hooks into apt (and other\n  package managers including yum and pacman-g2) to automatically commit\n  changes made to /etc during package upgrades.

It's quite\n  modular and configurable, while also being simple to use if you\n  understand the basics of working with revision control.\n\n\nA: I'm in the middle of developing a solution to the same kind of problem.\nBasically, my objective is a system allowing undo and redo with file-level granularity.\nStarting with your question and working backwards...\n\n\n*\n\n*In order to compare to the default configuration, we have to store the originals of all those files somewhere first. Then we can produce what you want with something like...\n\n\nDIFFDIR= ......\nARCDIR=./.archives                         # see below\n\nfunction getlastarchive() {\n  ... code to return last archived version ...\n}\n\nfor FILE in /etc/*\ndo\n  ARCFILE=\"$(getlastarchive $FILE)\"\n  diff $ARCDIR/$ARCFILE /etc/$FILE  >$DIFFDIR/$FILE.diff\ndone\n\n\n\n*\n\n*To store the originals, I've chosen to adopt the convention of having a single .archives subdirectory in any directory with an altered file. It's created as necessary by a file-archive script.\n\n*If you only want one level of undo, you only need copy the unaltered file to the .archives directory before it is changed.\n\n*For unlimited-undo, we need a versioning scheme. An obvious choice is a datetime stamp appended to the name of the archived version. Something like...\n\n\nFiles:                      /etc/hosts\n                            /etc/resolv.conf\n\nArchived Versions:          /etc/.archives/hosts.20121219015459\n                            /etc/.archives/resolv.conf.20121219015459\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Instead, I'm using just an auto-calculated incremental version#, as in...\n\n\nFiles:                      /etc/hosts\n                            /etc/resolv.conf\n\nArchived Versions:          /etc/.archives/hosts.00\n                            /etc/.archives/resolv.00.conf\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The version# is before the extension since I also use this for edited versions of images which need their extensions (.jpg, .png, etc) intact in order to be detected properly by a lot of software. If a file has no extension, the version# is just appended to the end. The code to do this is more complex, but runs instantly so no problem. A case can be made for a number of other schemes but this works for me.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Lubuntu - what task switchers with previews can I install?

It's kind of frustrating because this is a home computer and I mainly use it for browsing the internet and watching YouTube videos. When I try to install something that might fix it, it just downloads a bunch of files and says to extract them or whatever. I'm not sure what to do with the files after I extract them. That's probably the main issue: I don't have a lot of experience working with computers at this level. I'm used to Windows, which seems to make most software installs idiot-proof.

Thanks In Advance.\n\nA: From within the perspective of a virtual machine, you'll see the virtualized (emulated) hardware, not your real hardware. The hypervisor (VMware player in your case) will emulate a whole machine in which your Ubuntu installation is running. Specifically, VMware emulates a new network device (you can see that in Windows device manager) and will route traffic on IP-level, or bridge on Ethernet-level. It won't pass the whole device.\nYou have several options to gain access to your wireless hardware in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu (native) on your machine. Any way will be sufficient: Wubi install, dual boot, or on an external hard drive.\n\n*Run Ubuntu from the Live CD. This limits you from receiving possibly needed updates, and you'll loose all changes on every reboot.\n\n*Using a passthrough technology like Intel VT-d which allows you to redirect all low-level hardware calls to a virtual machine. This will make the hardware unavailable in your host operating system. However, your hardware does not support this, and that's why I don't recommend you to try this.\n\n*Find a USB Wireless card and use USB redirection with that device instead. I'm not sure if that's available in VMware Player, but if it is, this is possible without specific hardware support.\n\n\nA: try reinstalling the network manager: sudo apt-get install --reinstall network-manager\n", "Q: How do I use a 4GB USB flash drive to install Ubuntu 12.10? I've downloaded \"ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64\" and used Pen Drive Linux to get it onto my USB.  I then restarted my computer (a Windows 7 Home Premium edition) and entered the boot menu to have it boot from the Sandisk USB (it called it Sandisk Cruzer Cruzer).  Linux came up and asked if I wanted to try or install.  I picked install, connected to my Wi-Fi, and installed it.  After my laptop restarted, Windows booted immediately.  I have tried several times and cannot get a choice between the two.  \nP.S.\nI have used the Windows Installer, Wubi, but at the last second it gave me some kind of error.\n\nA: *\n\n*First of all you should remove any current Ubuntu or Wubi installation.\n\n*Next download Rufus, an easy tool for creating bootable USBs.\n\n*Download the prefered Ubuntu image from Ubuntu Download Section.\n\n*Open Rufus and write the image on the USB (it is very easy).\n\n*Reboot your PC after finishing, and change the boot order to boot from USB.\n\n*Once the installation window comes up, click Install Now.\n\n*Lastly, choose Run Ubuntu alongside Windows 7.\n\n\nI'm pretty sure there will be a bootloader in order to choose between the two OSes.\n\nA: Linux is most likely installed, but you're possibly automatically booting to the Windows partition immediately. If that's the case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your computer\n\n*Go to your BIOS settings\n\n*Select your other drive, or if you used UEFI and installed to the same disk (not recommended) then highlight \"Ubuntu\" and boot to that.\n\n\nIf you automatically boot to the grub bootloader it will give you the option to pass through to Windows whereas Windows will not do the vice versa. This functionality does not occur automatically during installation though.\n\nA: Most likely, Boot loader for your Linux OS and Windows are on separate disks and you windows boot loader is prioritized to be loaded first. You can press the boot option keys (You may find your's here). When you are on the boot loader screen select the corresponding Disk for Ubuntu. And if you want to make Ubuntu load first, then go to your BIOS or UEFI settings and change the boot order.\n\nA: Or you can also use the Universal USB Installer if you have through windows.\nIt is more easy that way.\n", "Q: How can I get wine to work on my amd64 computer? \nPossible Duplicate:\nInstalling Wine on 64 Bit \n\nI am new to Ubuntu, and want to install Wine on my laptop.

I think you want to create a logfile with only those entries from sshd to see who and when is accessing your server via ssh, right?\nsshd uses syslog to do the logging, in your case rsyslog. This logging is configured in /etc/sshd/sshd_config. The relevant settings are SyslogFacility and LogLevel. Look at the manpage to understand what they do.\nTo get a single logfile /var/log/sshd.log which only contains messages coming from sshd you have to modify the rsyslog configuration. Create a file /etc/rsyslog.d/sshd.conf and put the following line in it:\nif $programname == 'sshd' then /var/log/sshd.log\n\nAfterwards restart rsyslog with\nsudo service rsyslog restart\n\n\nA: To add more details to sshd.log, set the log level to verbose in /etc/ssh/sshd_config \nSearch for the LogLevel line and change it to\nLogLevel Verbose\n\nThen restart sshd\nsudo service ssh restart \n\n", "Q: Why there are tons of softwares on \"Synaptic Package Manager\" when there are only few softwares on \"Ubuntu Software Center\"? I was just searching some Softwares on Ubuntu software center and it was giving me \"not found\" but i could easily find and install them on synaptic.\n\nA: Software centre contains Full packages along with the required dependencies . But In Synaptic all the Packages are individual . \nIf you'd like to install anything from software centre selecting package will be enough but that's not going to be fine if you are doing with Synaptic package manager . \nIf you are a basic user of Linux/Ubuntu then I suggest you to choose Software centre not synaptic . \n\nA: The Ubuntu Software Center by default lists the non-technical packages -- those that an ordinary user might want to install. You take extra steps to see packages such as documentation, debugging, dependencies, etc., (those that may be overwhelming and are typically for tech-minded people). \nAfter searching for a topic click on Shown technical packages at the bottom of a USC package list to see these.\n\nA: As I understand, Synaptic Package Manager and Ubuntu Software Center are both GUIs that use apt-get under the hood. No matter which you use, dependencies will be installed automatically. The Software and Updates program is a convenient GUI to manipulate apt-get's software list. \nIn the Beginning, there was apt-get\napt-get is the tool that actually does the heavy lifting, and it is available from the command-line. It took care of dependencies, and automatic updates.\nThey All Handle Dependencies\nMost software, including Windows software, consists of one or more main executable (.exe for Windows) and many library modules (a .dll in Windows). Each of those library modules can by shared by many applications. Many of these executables, in turn, can be a subcomponent of another product; for example, Synaptic Package Manager depends on apt-get.\nBecause dependencies are managed by apt-get, if you ask to install a product from any of the above tools, all of the necessary dependencies will also be installed (apt-get and Synaptic Package Manager will first ask your permission). That means if you choose to install Java, any of those tools will also install all of the libraries and modules that Java depends on.\nApproved Repositories\nBy default, apt-get will only show Ubuntu's repositories containing Ubuntu's approved lists of software, which include both Free and Open Source software as well as commercial software. However, apt-get allows you to add URLs to other repositories (ppa, or personal package archive).\nThen There Were GUIs\nSynaptic Package Manager was designed to be a full-featured GUI interface to apt-get; it is supposed to do just about anything you can do from the command line, and has been around for a long time. Everything shows up in both SPM and apt-get.\nHowever, showing all of the libraries and other programs that support a particular product makes it difficult to find what you are looking for. If you didn't choose carefully, you might only install some libraries or optional modules for Java instead of actually installing Java. \nThe much newer Ubuntu Software Center was invented to be much more user friendly, thus hiding all the dependencies. If you want to add Java, you don't need to see all the libraries and sub-programs that have java in their name or description. \nAlso, Ubuntu Software Center has some sort of policies in place that also hide some products, probably those that are an integral part of the OS and shouldn't normally be messed with. For example, you can find gcc, but not apt-get in UBC. The details of these policies are still a mystery to me. \nThe Recommended Solutions\n1. First try to find your primary target in Ubuntu Software Center. \n\n\n*Of course, there may be occasions when you are only trying to install some libraries or modules, such as when you are installing a product that is not provided by Ubuntu, and that product depends on other stuff that is hidden by Software Center. Then you will have to revert to the Synaptic Package Manager. \n\n*You only need to go to apt-get if you are on a server without a GUI desktop, or the GUI has failed, or the instructions you have only refer to apt-get (that's often done so that the same instructions will work on servers and desktops alike). \n\nA: Synaptic also lists every package that comes with certain software, whilst Software Center only lists that software without the more \"technical\" and smaller ones.\nI also think that U.S.C. does not list every software due to approval reasons (?)\n", "Q: Unable to find a medium containing a live file system with boot from iso Unable to find a medium containing a live file system:\n reset/press Shift/c (command line)\n grub> insmod iso9660\n grub> loopback l (hd0,6)/lubuntu-12.10-desktop-i386.iso\n grub> set root=(l)\n grub> source (l)/boot/grub/loopback.cfg\n grub> [press Esc]\n Select Install Lubuntu\n ......\n (initramfs)Unable to find a medium containing a live file system\n (initramfs)\n\n\nA: Resolved as:\nset iso_path=/lubuntu-12.10-desktop-i386.iso\n\n \n", "Q: Where is the Full Circle magazine installed by the Ubuntu Software Center?

Command line tools (indexer, server,\netc) are compiled statically.\n\n# Run automake\n./autogen.sh\n\n# Run autoconf\n./configure --enable-compileall --enable-staticbins --disable-android\n\n# Download all dependencies\ncd src/dependencies; make ; cd ../..\n\n# Reconfigure with dependencies (Gecko version)\n./configure --enable-compileall --enable-staticbins --disable-android\n\n# Compile\nmake\n\n# Creates tarbal suitable for distribution (no deps)\nmake diststatic\n\n# If you want to be able to run directly from your dev repository copy\n# the \"xulrunner\" directory in the distributation tarball to the\n# \"kiwix\" sub-directory of your developement tree.\n\n# Don't try to install with \"make install\", if you want to have kiwix\n# install on your system just copy the directory in a /usr/local/bin\n# directory.\n\n\nYou should find the result kiwix-0.*-static-*.tar.bz2 archive at the top folder.\n", "Q: What should the correct path be for my CD/DVD drive in 12.04 and how do I change it? After a fresh install of 12.04 on a dell Inspiron 530 when right clicking on the CD/DVD drive and selecting properties it indicates for location:  \"///\" Obviously this drive does not work. \nWhats the best fix for newb? Please don't go cryptic on me give me a long shot answer.\nMuch thanks in advance.  \n\nA: I think the default device path for CD/DVD Drives is:   /dev/sr0\nAnd when you have a CD/DVD in, you need to go to /media/[userame]/[devicename]\n", "Q: Can't make AWUS036H work in Ubuntu 12.10 I am using 64 bit Ubuntu 12.10. \nThis is my kernel version:\n\nLinux 3.5.0-19-generic #30-Ubuntu SMP Tue Nov 13 17:48:01 UTC\n  2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nMy wireless card is an AWUSU36H\n\nThe first thing I do to install the driver is copy the driver from the CD to the Downloads folder.\ncd /media/me/AWUS036H/Drivers/RTL8187L/Unix (Linux)/Linux driver for kernel 2.6.X$ \ncp rtl8187_linux_26.1025.0328.2007.tar.gz ~/Downloads/\n\nThen I extract the tar\ntar xvfz rtl8187_linux_26.1025.0328.2007.tar.gz\n\nI navigate into the extracted folder, and I try to follow the instructions in the Readme.txt \ncd rtl8187_linux_26.1025.0328.2007\n\nThis are the contents of the folder:\ndrv.tar.gz   makedrv     stack.tar.gz  wlan0rmv\nieee80211    ReadMe.txt  wlan0dhcp     wlan0up\nifcfg-wlan0  rtl8187     wlan0down     wpa_supplicant-0.4.9\n\nThis is what the Readme.txt says:\nRelease Date: 2006-02-09, ver 1.2^M\nRTL8187 Linux driver version 1.2^M\n^M\n   --This driver supports RealTek RTL8187 Wireless LAN driver for ^M\n     Fedora Core 2/3/4/5, Debian 3.1, Mandrake 10.2/Mandriva 2006, ^M\n     SUSE 9.3/10.1/10.2, Gentoo 3.1, etc.^M\n   - Support Client mode for either infrastructure or adhoc mode^M\n   - Support WEP and WPAPSK connection^M\n^M\n< Component >^M\nThe driver is composed of several parts:^M\n        1.

That will allow you to keep the switch on and use the USB. It has a working driver, rtl8187 and has created an interface wlan1.\nFind out the driver for the internal with:\nsudo lshw -C network\n\nFind the part that refers to 'driver=' associated with wlan0, the internal. Then blacklist it:\nsudo su\necho \"blacklist <some_driver>\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nexit\n\nPlug in the USB, reboot and it should be working. If in doubt about the correct driver to blacklist, post your findings and we'll help.\n", "Q: USB Installation reports disk full When installing ubuntu 12.10 via live usb, message pops up reporting partition is full.

That way you can see what's going on with your disk.\n", "Q: Restore default keyboard shortcut for Workspace Switcher/Show Desktop I tried setting the default keyboard shortcut to Hide normal windows (Show desktop) to \nSuper + S.\nIt didn't work and now whenever I press Super + S, I get the workspace switcher. I tried setting Hide normal windows back to Ctrl + Super + S, but it doesn't work. I'm still getting the Workspace switcher.\nHow can I reset these two settings? I use the Show Desktop quite a lot and it is quite annoying not being able to do it.\n\nA: I solved the issue simply by setting Hide normal windows to the original Ctrl+Super+D.\nAs somebody else told me, the shortcut for Workspace switcher is not customisable.\nHowever I think I discovered a bug: setting Super+S for Hide normal windows actually sets it for Workspace switcher. Would like to report this bug but don't know which package is responsible for this behavior.\n", "Q: Reduce the delay of touchpad disable while typing I set the setting to disable touchpad while typing.

With the introduction of the legal confirmation in the Unity Dash (12.10) I am getting a file called 'unitydashlegalseen' in '/home/username/.cache/' that gives a permission error when syncing in Grsync. I googled and thought I could exclude this file in from syncing Grsync under Advanced options/Additional Options. The command I guessed is obviously wrong as it does not work, does somebody know what I correctly have to put in? This is the wrong command I used:\n--exclude '/home/username/.cache/unitydashlegalseen'\n\nA: Ok, actually it is pretty easy, the answer is in the official Grsync forums: http://opbyte.freeforums.org/exclude-from-backup-won-t-work-t192.html\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file called \"exclude.txt\" in the hidden folder /home/username/.grsync\nI did this via right clicking the specific folder in Nautilus and created a new file from the pop up menu. This way I avoided the problems described in the above thread where the problem seemed to be that it had been created with LibreOffice.\n\n*Open the file with gedit and put in the paths you want to exclude from syncing. I put in these two:\n.local/share/Trash\n.cache/unitydashlegalseen\n\n*In the Grsync select the correct Session and then go to Advanced Options/Additional Option where you put in the command linking to your exclusion list (as seen in the second screenshot in the above mentioned forum post):\n--exclude-from=\"/home/username/.grsync/exclude.txt\" \n\n*Mind to delete already synced files (listed in the exclusion list) on the remote location if you do not want them to be there (otherwise they remain as they have been before excluding them - e.g. with VirtualBox images this would save a lot of hard disk space on the remote location). \n", "Q: how to change gnome 3.2.6 panel background color I am using ubunut 12.10 with gnome-shell 3.6.2 .

I am fuzzier on the details here, but I suspect you can  copy the entire /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme folder (so that you have all the pictures the theme requires) and modify the CSS file, which will provide you with a complete theme.\n", "Q: Why Flush torrent client would not start? Flush is a torrent client similar to Deluge or Qbittorrent, is the lightest, and I have used it along Qbittorrent without any problem for some time.\nBut after reinstalling the OS I used only Qbittorent for a while; now when I want to try Flush again I have a problem: after I install it, execute it, and see some action of the processor (i see that light flashing a few secs like when a program starts), but then nothing happens.\nAt first view, this looks similar to a problem reported in connection with FoxitReader, that I also encountered and solved according to the answer. It would have been similar, except that in the case of FoxitReader the program was absent in usr/bin, and putting it there manually after extracting it from deb solved the problem. In the case of Flush, it is already in usr/bin. I see it in Synaptic, in launcher, in menu, in run(alt-f2) and usr/bin: nothing works.\n(In the case of FoxitReader,  the program appeared in menu, launcher, and synaptic, but not in run and not in usr/bin.)\nI have installed Flush from Synaptic (currently 0.9.12) and have also tried the deb version 0.9.10 with identical results.\n(I'm in Lubuntu 12.04).\n(The same happens when I try Frostwire.)\nEdit after comment: after running flush in Terminal I get:\n~$ flush\n(flush:3711): GLib-WARNING **: /build/buildd/glib2.0-2.32.3/./glib/goption.c:2179: ignoring no-arg, optional-arg or filename flags (8) on option of arg-type 0 in entry main:version\n\n(flush:3711): GLib-WARNING **: /build/buildd/glib2.0-2.32.3/./glib/goption.c:2179: ignoring no-arg, optional-arg or filename flags (16) on option of arg-type 4 in entry main:config\n\n(flush:3711): GLib-WARNING **: /build/buildd/glib2.0-2.32.3/./glib/goption.c:2179: ignoring no-arg, optional-arg    or filename flags (8) on option of arg-type 0 in entry main:only-pass\n\nflush: symbol lookup error: flush: undefined symbol: _ZN10libtorrent7sessionC1ERKNS_11fingerprintEii\n\n\nA: That seems to be a compiling/linking bug with flush: that undefined symbol is provided by libtorrent-rasterbar6, which seems to be installed. \nSo you can try to reinstall libtorrent-rasterbar6 and see if you get anything different:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libtorrent-rasterbar6\n\nAlso, there is a PPA that seems to be maintained by the creator of Flush, and so it should be safe for you to try it:\nsudo apt-get remove flush libtorrent-rasterbar6\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:konishchevdmitry/flush \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install flush\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: finding an apt-get installation Warning : totally noob question...\nI just started using ubuntu at home, and i love it, but there are some basic stuff that i don't know how to do and is annoying me...\nWhen I install a package using sudo apt-get install ... I don't even know where the installed package is. For some packages it doesn't really matter to me, but for some it does...\nExample : I just installed vim, and I would like to create a shortcut to vim on my desktop. How would i do this ? How can i find the folder where it was installed and know which executable I need to shortcut ?...\nMaybe coming from the world of Windows, I'm not even thinking like a linux user, so feel free to correct me... :)\n\nA: if you wish to find the directory of the executable vim, use which command: which vim. It will display where the executable is located.\n\nA: And welcome ;)\nTo extend nickanor's answer you can create a .desktop file to point to vim executable. Just open gEdit with root permissions \ngksu gedit\n\nand paste:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Vim\nGenericName=Vim Editor\nExec=vim\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\nCategories=IDE;Editor;\n\nThen save the file to /usr/share/applications/ with name vim.desktop.\nThen you can see vim when you search it in the dash:\n\nAnother faster aproach is just to open the terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and write ´vim filename´ which will open the editor with specified file.\n\n\nA: vim is located in /usr/bin/vim. Most executables, that is, scripts that start a program are in /usr/bin or /sbin or /usr/sbin. You can find about anything with:\nsudo updatedb\nlocate <whatever>\n\nupdatedb indexes a database and takes a few moments, so be patient.\nI doubt you really want a shortcut to vim, however, since vim requires an argument; that is, a file to create or modify, for example:\nvim newfile.txt\n\n\nA: To extend on Ángel Araya's answer. You could run  sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gnome-panel  then open  gedit and type\n\n [Desktop Entry] \nName=New launcher...\nExec=gnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new \nType=Application \n\nThen save to the desktop as gnome-launcher.desktop.\nFinally you should have a button to make a launcher on your desktop.\n", "Q: What's the difference between .Xresources and .Xdefaults?

I want to preserve my original Windows 7 Loader.\n\nA: Wubi maybe the easiest way to go, but it will make your Ubuntu 'part of windows'.\nThe upside is: you can easily uninstall it just like any windows program.\nThe downside: its just slightly slower and a touch less stable then if you install Ubuntu on its own drive or partition, outside of windows.\nBut, as you guessed, the Ubuntu installer (grub2) will mess up your Windows bootloader.\nHowever, to avoid that is easy: the trick is to place the Ubuntu bootloader in its own boot partition, instead of it modifying the one from windows. Follow the link that Rick Green added below your question.\nA very good step by step description how to do this, is here.\n\nA: Install using WUBI. It keeps the Windows bootloader.\n", "Q: Booting Ubuntu Failure : error: attempt to read or write outside of disk 'hd0' I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 in a Western Digital external hard drive (320GB). This is a complete installation, not a live USB.\nWhen I plug it in my HP desktop I go to the BIOS settings and boot off the hard drive, everything work perfectly as it should.

I wanted to post the solution here because I find it unlikely that I am the only one (this question has a lot of views).\nThe answer for me was found here: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-laptop-and-netbook-25/boot-problem-after-installing-ubuntu-11-04-kernel-panic-not-syncing-vfs-919143/\nBooting from a LiveCD and altering grub.cfg to access the block device by name instead of UUID was the fix for me. This was temporary... in that after I updated my packages, it installed a grub update that broke it. I have been messing with the grub.cfg to try and re-fix it, now, but its progress! Hope someone can fill in the next step.\n\nA: Sorry for the late answer, but I recently had the very same problem. I fixed it and am posting this in the hope that it may be useful to others who experience the same problem.\nIn my particular case it was due to a defective SATA cable. Replacing the cable fixed the problem.\nMore generally—by looking at the other answer and comments—I think this message may be caused by some kind of (hardware) problem when Grub is accessing the hard drive. In sorak's case, where modifying the grub.cfg file to refer to the block device by name instead of by UUID helped, it might have been the case that for some reason, the UUID could not be read anymore.\nAnyway, for whoever experiences this problem, I recommend booting a live CD and using S.M.A.R.T. tools to check whether there is a problem with the hard drive, and what kind of problem. That is is what I did; this particular answer got me started. In order to interpret the S.M.A.R.T. attributes output by smartctl for a hard drive, the Wikipedia article on S.M.A.R.T. is quite useful. For me, a high UDMA CRC Error Count hinted to a defective SATA cable, and the cable indeed turned out to be the root cause of the problem.\n", "Q: How to setup debian/control to force updating a library? This question is aimed at PPA/packages maintainers.\nI have a PPA with 2 packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*mypackage (currently version 1~ppa1~quantal)\n\n*mypackagelib (currently version 1~ppa1~quantal)\n\n\nCurrently, the control file of mypackage has:\nDepends: mypackagelib\n\nI want to update the 2 packages to version '2' (mypackage version 2 and mypackagelib version 2).\nHow can I make sure that the 2 packages will be updated when the user updates 'mypackage' ?\nFYI, changing the 'Depends' field to:\nDepends: mypackagelib (>= 2)\n\ndoes NOT work, and returns the following error:\nmypackage : Depends: mypackagelib (>= 2) but mypackagelib-2~ppa1~quantal is to be installed\n\n\nA: Your version numbers are inconsistent. The order relation on version numbers is pretty complex. It is described in the Debian policy manual. In particular:\n\nFirst the initial part of each string consisting entirely of non-digit characters is determined. These two parts (one of which may be empty) are compared lexically. If a difference is found it is returned. The lexical comparison is a comparison of ASCII values modified so that all the letters sort earlier than all the non-letters and so that a tilde sorts before anything, even the end of a part. For example, the following parts are in sorted order from earliest to latest: ~~, ~~a, ~, the empty part, a.\n\nIn particular, 3.196~ppa1~quantal is considered older than 3.196. The typical use case for ~ is beta versions: 1.42~beta3 comes before 1.42. You can check your understanding of Debian package version numbers by running dpkg --compare-versions:\n$ dpkg --compare-versions '3.196~ppa1~quantal' '>=' '3.196'; echo $?\n1\n\n0 means that the order relation is met, 1 means that it isn't.\nThere is some incomplete advice on version numbers in the PPA packaging help. Since your package is not in Ubuntu, you don't need a ~ suffix; you should use a version number like 3.196ppa1. The source dependency can be (>= 3.196) if any release of 3.196 will do, or something like (>= 3.196ppa5) if you need at least a certain package release.\nIf you keep the ~ in here, you must put it in the source dependency too: (>= 3.196~ppa1~quantal). To say “at least the same version as the main package”, write\nDepends: mypackagelib (>= ${binary:Version})\n\nAnother possibility (thanks to tumbleweed is to declare a dependency on 3.196~ (the number and a tilde and nothing more), which is an older version than 3.196~anything.\n\n(This doesn't apply to you, but it might apply to future visitors. What follows applies when libmypackage contains a shared library (.so).)\nThe naming convention for libraries is libmypackage1 and libmypackage2, by the way. If you started with mypackagelib-1, you should leave that, but switch to libmypackage2 for the next version.\nThe two library packages mypackagelib-1 and mypackagelib-2 might coexist if there are programs still using the old library and programs using the new library installed at the same time. Unless the administrator has explicitly requested the installation of the library package (which he'd only do if he has a non-packaged program requiring the library, e.g. in /usr/local), the old library package will be marked as automatically installed, so it will be uninstalled automatically when there are no dependencies on it.\nFor more information on how to package a library, read the Debian Library Packaging guide. Although Debian's policies are not mandatory for an Ubuntu PPA, it's a good idea to follow them: they illustrate best practice for working with Debian packaging tools.\n", "Q: Can I set Ubuntu 12.10 to automatically reboot to Windows once only? Is there some way when I'm in Ubuntu 12.10 that I can set it to reboot automatically to Windows just once, so that when I'm in Windows I can reboot and it will automatically boot back into Ubuntu?  I need this because often when I travel I access my home computer for email and other personal info that I don't want to travel with or leave to the tender mercies of the \"cloud\".

I have a Dell Inspiron 531S that originally came loaded with Windows Vista.  A couple years ago I purchased a copy of Windows 7, formatted the hard drive and installed the updated operating system.  In the process I formatted the 10 GB recovery drive partition on drive D as it was no longer needed for Windows Vista.  I would really like to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS alongside Windows 7 using the empty 10 GB drive D:.  I have two questions.\n(1)  Can Ubuntu be installed on a separate partition, a drive removed from the boot sector on drive C:?\n(2)  If so would Grub be installed in the boot sector and properly select Windows 7 on drive C: or Ubuntu 12.04 on drive D? \n\nA: Sure, the ubuntu installer will handle both questions automatically. You only will have to select the partition to install ubuntu. One thing: Drive D, will probably be sda2 in ubuntu but you will be able to see which partition is what by the different sizes.\nRegarding question1, installing on a separate partition is the only good way to install it in my opinion. Anyways, this is the default way, if you have only 1 partition with windows, the installer will split it and install ubuntu on the 2nd one.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 + Windows 7 - No option to install alongside windows 7 I have a 64-bit Windows 7 OS installed at the moment. I have used GPartEd to shrink the current Windows 7 partition on my 720GB HDD to 200GB. I have then made a new NTFS partition of 200GB which I will keep for later on as a shared drive between both Windows 7 and Ubuntu.\nSo in GPartEd I now have 3 partitions which were all automatically there from the Windows 7 installation, I only shrank the 3rd one from the 698GB or so that it was to 200GB and created the 200GB for the shared drive.\nI first tried creating another 200GB partition at this stage to install Ubuntu too but when I burnt the DVD and loaded it, Ubuntu gave me no option to install alongside Windows, only the option to erase the entire disk and install Ubuntu on the blank drive...not what I want to do. So I tried installing it through clicking 'Something else', it downloaded all the install files but didn't install. I then had a lot of problems with getting the DVD drive to work and what not but now have this fixed so I can use Windows again.\nSo now I've used GPartEd to delete the partitions so again I'm now left with the 3 partitions there which Windows 7 automatically installs and a 200GB NTFS partition I will later use as a shared drive.\nBooting up from the Ubuntu disc and again there is no option to install alongside Windows 7.

I'll tell you why. \nInstead of running a normal computer to stay on irc chat to keep up with the lastest security news or to connect to \"ubuntu\" and open source irc servers, you can use a raspberry pi at 5 watt max to save power, (it uses no power) it's more reliable, it's more secure because it's a one app appliance, and frees up your computer, and you can be always on.\nHow would the live boot be useful?\nit's more reliable...because an irc chat program would not need to write logs onto the boot media and wear it out, it can write to ram.\nSure, you can probably create a ramdisk and change logging directories but maybe not every program will play nicely and things are getting complicated.\nOne way this can be done:\nThe Raspberry Pi verion B has HDMI, 512MiB of RAM, a low power Arm processor and 3 usb ports, one usb port is taken by a RJ45 network port, so you only have 2.\nSupposedly, with a booting sd card, one port would be taken, one left but we still need a few more ports for keyboard and mouse. a usb hub can solve this problem and maybe allow for a fourth port [Live Boot] [Hub=> kb, mouse, _] for storage.\nSomething live-boot-like would be nice because any security breach means nothing if sd cards can be write protected but this means you can't write a log except in memory or only on additional storage or through the network.

I have used Ubuntu for about 3 weeks now, everythings been fine, but I got this message today:\nmicrocode: failed to load file amd-ucode/microcode_amd.bin\n\nIt will not boot past this screen now. I am currently using my old laptop to ask this question. Any ideas?\n\nA: The system is looking for the amd64-microcode package. This is firmware needed by hardware on your system. Ubuntu does a great job of detecting your hardware and in most cases installing what's needed, but it's not foolproof. \nIf you have been using the system for 3 weeks and this problem just started, most likely the kernel was recently updated, and the new kernel has to have this package. New kernels are installed by Software Updates. You may not have realized that a new kernel was installed. \nIt's always possible that a newly installed kernel breaks something. When this happens you can boot from the older kernel until you figure out what you need. In this case, it looks like the system needs you to manually install that package, which is easy. \nFirst try to boot from the older kernel\nThe boot menu is handled by Grub2. When a new kernel is installed, it makes the new kernel the first choice and hides all older kenrels behind the menu item \"Advanced Options for Ubuntu\".\nIf Ubuntu is the only operating system on the computer, you may not see the Grub2 menu by default. To see it, hold down the Shift as the system boots.\nWhen you see the Grub2 menu, use ↓ (the down arrow key) to move down to the advanced options, then hit Enter. You will see one or more boot options with an older kernel. Choose one, and you should boot ok.\nInstall the package\nIt can be hard to find technical packages in the Software Center. The easiest way to do it is to use the terminal.\nCtrl+Alt+t will open a terminal. Copy and paste:\nsudo apt-get install amd64-microcode\n\nRecovery mode\nIf for some reason you don't see other kernel options or still can't boot, you should see an option in the Advanced Options choices that ends in (Recovery Mode). Choose this. After it starts to run, you will see a dialog with various recovery choices. \nFirst try Resume. This may allow you to boot without the problem you were having. If this works, install the package from the command line as above. Be sure to reboot afterwards.\nIf you still can't boot, try again and this time choose Root from the recovery dialog. This will drop you into a command line for root. You will be able to install the package but be careful when working as root. Be sure to reboot afterwards.\nchroot\nIf none of the above work, you may be able to install the package using chroot from the live cd. One use of chroot is change the root environment from the LiveCD to the installed system hard drive you need to target. (This is usually on the hard drive, but could be on a usb or elsewhere.) In short, you are using the Live medium to boot a broken system that won't otherwise boot. This is a little more complicated but is not hard.\n1) Boot from the LiveCD/USB you used to install Ubuntu (or at least make sure the live medium and the installed system have the same architecture - both 32-bit or both 64-bit). Use Try Ubuntu.\n2) Open the terminal.\n3) Mount your Ubuntu root partition: sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\nX is partition letter and Y is the partition number.\nIf you followed a standard \"Replace Windows\", I believe you will have /dev/sda1 as your root partition. \nIf you are not sure, the following commands may help you figure it out.\nsudo fdisk -l\nsudo blkid\n\nIf you are realy stuck on this part, you may need to ask for more help.\nLet's assume root is on /dev/sda1\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n4) You then need to mount various parts of the filesystem. The Ubuntu Community page for resintalling GRub2, has a nice single command to handle this.\nfor i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done\n\n5) Chroot into the installed system with \nsudo chroot /mnt\n\n6) Install the package.\napt-get install amd64-microcode\n\nYou will be at a root prompt, so you won't need sudo. As always, be careful and reboot as soon as you are finished installing.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot your Ubuntu as normal\n\n*When you see the log-in screen, try to Ctrl - Alt - F1\n\n*In my case (ubuntu 12.10), a blank screen appears. dont be panic, try Ctrl - Alt - F2\n\n*A login console shows up and ask you to login using your id and password.\nAfter login.

The phone says \"Connected to PC\" but not the PC. And I don't have a micro SD card adapter. I want to be able to put files onto my phone and take files off of it. Any suggestions?\n\nA: My brother has that same phone but the 680 version of it. I believe it uses a MTP transfer method, which unfortunately doesn't work with any of the MTP software I tested in the software center. For my Nexus 7 I use the gMTP program and it works great. THAT IS THE ONLY ANDROID SERIES I have ever seen that doesn't work on Ubuntu to be honest.\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu on my Mac PowerPC G5 How do I install Ubuntu on my powerpc G5? which version do I download? where do I download it from? and how do I get it to install? I tried burning ubuntu powerpc 12.04 and booting from the cd and all I get is a DOS like setup prompt \"boot:\" I've tried 'live' and everything else listed when I push tab; but, every time I get a bunch of white text on black screen, then black text on white and then my monitor just goes black and nothing happens??? what am I doing wrong? any suggestions?  \n\nA: Still attempting the install on your G5? I've got mine working--except for wireless.\nHere's my experience.\nWhen my screen went blank it was because I had two monitor cards installed. I got rid of the inactive one, and text appeared instead of going blank--as if to suggest that the installer was trying to write to the non-existent monitor. I don't know your setup, so I don't know if that's going to be a help or not. Think carefully about any virtual monitors that you may have created, or mirrored screens that you may have needed to set up for some reason. Maybe that'll jog your memory. HTH. \nI had OS X 10.5.8 installed on a 2 TB drive. I used Disc Tools to adjust the partition to 1 TB (which you can do starting in 10.5.8 and up), and installed the Ubuntu PowerPC 12.04.01 version along side OS X in the remaining 1 TB partition. \nI tried PowerPC Lubuntu (note the 'L' in Lubuntu) 12.10 with miserable results. \nBTW, I also tried PowerPC 10.04 LTS and everything worked--everything. \nHowever, upgrading from PowerPC 10.04 to 12.10 was a train wreck. \nAs I said, I've got both working--OS X 10.5.8 and PowerPC 12.04.01--although I'm still trying to track down the resolution of the wireless / Broadcom / B43 networking issue. I'm hoping that that won't take too long--we'll see.\nThe bootloader in use--yaboot--works great for Ubuntu, but not for OS X. If I want to boot OS X, I hold down the option key to get Apple's option page and choose OS X from there. Apparently, yaboot is passing incorrect or incomplete boot parameters to the OS and after about 30 seconds, yaboot --> OS X freezes. yaboot --> Linux works fine. \nDoug Parker\nOrlando, FL\n\nA: The Ubuntu Wiki has a bunch of stuff about installing Ubuntu on PowerPC, though I'm not quite sure when the last time it was updated.\nFollow this doc for more information: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCFAQ\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS breaking down and sluggish I am in the process of switching from Windows to a Linux based system and am currently deciding between distributions...I am currently trying Ubuntu as WUBI. I find that my experience is not very smooth and streamlined for example, crash-reports, bugs, applications taking time to run etc etc (this in spite of the fact that I am very patient and am constantly researching solution to different driver and application issues). Was wondering if this is because I am running through NTFS right now or is it just like this? Looking to switch to Linux because of its opensource nature, interest in software development in college as well as maximizing the potential of my machine. I am running an AMD quadcore-x64 2.2GHz, 6GB RAM and 750 GB HDD  on an HP G6 notebook. I would appreciate any honest opinions.\n\nA: I would just try re-downloading and reinstalling Wubi. If that doesn't work, try upgrading to 12.10.\nIf neither of the above work, try dual-booting 12.04/12.10 with Windows.\nIf nothing works, then here is how to safely uninstall:\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-safely-uninstall-ubuntu-in-windows-dual-boot-environment/\nI know that this says to use a Windows CD, but if you don't have one, then just run boot repair from an Ubuntu live usb/cd (it can repair Windows partitions as well).\nIf you're really bent on using Linux rather than Windows, you can know for sure that it will work if you buy a machine that has Linux pre-installed. You can buy machines like this from various places, but I highly recommend Zareason and System 76. You might pay a little more for their machines, but from what the reviews say it's worth it, and what they sell is built to last.\n", "Q: When I shutdown the computer, it restarts I am unable to shutdown.

However, if you are using the Startup Disk Creator, make sure not to click the button that erases the drive if you already have things on there.

With a previous version, I usedupdate-rc.d and scripts stored in /etc/init.d/ to get this working by adding %Group ALL = NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/scriptname to my sudoers file, but I can't seem to get an equivalent working for Upstart.\nI tried adding %Group ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/initctl start jobname to the sudoers file, but trying to run the command start jobname produces this error:\nstart: Rejected send message, 1 matched rules; type=\"method_call\", sender=\":1.21\" (uid=1000 pid=5148 comm=\"start jobname \" interface=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart0_6.Job\" member=\"Start\" error name=\"(unset)\" requested_reply=\"0\" destination=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart\" (uid=0 pid=1 comm=\"/sbin/init\")\n\nAs near as I can tell, that's a complaint about how my user account isn't given the power to send 'Start' messages in the D-Bus config file for Upstart.  I haven't been able to actually find any information on how to edit that file to give a group permission to access a specific service--does such an option exist?  Is there a way to edit the Sudoers file so I can run the job without editing the config file?  Am I better off just sticking with the previous version?\n\nA: You can start with finding out where the D-Bus configuration specific for Upstart is kept. See that destination=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart\" snippet from the error message? \nNow try to grep it in the folder with D-Bus config files:\nvhost07:~ $ grep -r \"com.ubuntu.Upstart\" /etc/dbus-1\n/etc/dbus-1/system.d/Upstart.conf:    <allow own=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart\" />\n[...skipped...]\n\nThat Upstart.conf file has some examples of policies. I guess you could try to figure out the format of a policy from them. \nThen try to allow your specific user just the actions that it needs. For instance, as in:\n<policy user=\"pope_benedict\">\n  <allow send_destination=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart\"\n         send_interface=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart0_6.Job\"\n         send_member=\"Start\"/>\n</policy>\n\nThis should permit the pope_benedict user to start that job.\nNote that the values for the 'allow' policy attributes are listed in your original error message.\n\nA: I'm personally using the following line in /etc/sudoers.d/jobname_myuser file:\nmyuser ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/start jobname, /sbin/stop jobname, /sbin/restart jobname, /sbin/status jobname\n\nas described here: https://serverfault.com/a/390723/68608\n\nA: Such option does not exist in sudo.\nThe difference between Sysv scripts and Upstart configuration files is just that: Sysv scripts are scripts, executables in their own right and you can tell sudo to allow some group to execute them. In the other hand, Upstart configuration files are merely just configuration files, not executables, so the execution of start (symlink to initctl) is the thing sudo allows. Your issue here is that allowing people to run initctl you allow them to initctl everything.\nSolution is though simple if your concern in merely a single job. Make a script, say /usr/bin/jobname.sh with\n#!/bin/sh\ninitctl $1 jobname\n\nthen chmod 755 /usr/bin/jobname.sh and finally add that executable to your sudoers file:\n%Group ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/jobname.sh\n\nThis way, everyone can call jobname.sh start or jobname.sh stop to control this specific job. You might want to add some checking to allow only start and stop parameters etc.\n\nA: As pointed above dbus daemon has a configuration file that specializes it for a particular application. \nls /etc/dbus-1/system.d/\navahi-dbus.conf\nbluetooth.conf\n...\nUpstart.conf\nwpa_supplicant.con\n\nThe configuration file also establishes resource limits, security parameters, and so forth.\nFor details see dbus-daemon-1(1) - Linux man page\nTo allow a group to start/stop Upstart jobs add following policy to /etc/dbus-1/system.d/Upstart.conf\n  <policy group=\"YourGroupName\">\n    <allow send_destination=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart\"\n       send_interface=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart0_6.Job\"\n       send_type=\"method_call\" send_member=\"Start\" />\n    <allow send_destination=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart\"\n       send_interface=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart0_6.Job\"\n       send_type=\"method_call\" send_member=\"Stop\" />\n  </policy>\n\nYou should consider security implications of such policy before changing default policy. Members of the YourGroupName will be able to start/stop all Upstart jobs.\n", "Q: Does the removal of i386 from the kernel mean Ubuntu is dropping 32 bit support? I saw recently that the i386 CPU is not going to be supported in the Linux Kernel 3.8\nso does that mean that Ubuntu will only be available in the coming years in 64-bit?\n\nA: Ubuntu hasn't run on proper \"i386\"'s for a long time, support for the processor was dropped in 10.10. \n\nA: No, it means that you won't be able to run Linux on the Intel 80386 chip, the original chip from Intel which supported 32-bit architecture. Those processors had clock speeds of 12-40 Mhz and were superseded by Intel 80486 and then Intel Pentium in early- and mid-1990th.\n\nOther, more modern 32-bit chips (Pentium Pro and above) are still going to be supported. Those processors are characterized as having the i386 architecture but they have some improvements over the original 80386, the use of which allows the removal of some ugly crutches from Linux that are required for 80386 support:\n\nThis tree removes ancient-386-CPUs support and thus zaps quite a bit\n  of complexity ... which has plagued us with extra work whenever we\n  wanted to change SMP primitives, for years.\n\nAnecdote has it that there was some sentimental value in supporting 80386 processor as it was the processor that Linus Torvalds used when he developed the first version of Linux.\n\n[Linux] needs a MMU (sorry everybody), and it specifically needs a\n  386/486 MMU (see later). ...  It uses every conceivable feature of the\n  386 I could find, as it was also a project to teach me about the\n  386.  As already mentioned, it uses a MMU, for both paging (not to disk yet) and segmentation. It's the segmentation that makes it REALLY\n  386 dependent (every task has a 64Mb segment for code & data - max 64\n  tasks in 4Gb. Anybody who needs more than 64Mb/task - tough cookies).\n\nAlso, despite i386 support present in Linux kernel up until version 3.8, in the recent years most Linux distributions were compiled with settings which made them incompatible with 80386 processor anyway. In particular, Ubuntu requires i686 (Pentium Pro) processor or above since Ubuntu 10.10.\n", "Q: Windows 7 and Ubuntu Boot issue I had the idea to dual boot Win 7 and Ubuntu and what I did was the following:\nMade a clean install of win 7 using all of my hard drive, next I used the Ubuntu live cd and gparted to partition my drive to be the following:\n/dev/sda1 ext4 20GB (Linux root)  \n/dev/sda2 ntfs 100GB(Win7)  \n/dev/sda3 ext4 350GB(Home)  \n/dev/sda4 extended 4GB(swap)  \n\nThe thing is, when installing ubuntu I deleted the partition win 7 creates for its boot sector and recovery and then resized the drive to look like what I mentioned, and Ubuntu installed GRUB to the MBR.\nWhen GRUB boots I can see Ubuntu but not  Windows, how can I chainload it?\nOr should I fix the windows mbr with the windows 7 installation disk and try to set the dual boot from there?\nI don't really care which one of the 2 bootloaders I end up using, I just want the dual boot to work out.\nThanks \n\nA: Your Windows 7 BCD is most likely broken since you changed partition layout. I suggest you to use a Windows 7 CD and try to use the recovery options and choose \"Startup Repair\".\nWindows 7 usually does not overwrites GRUB by itself. Instead it just fixes its Boot loader configuration (BCD). If it worked, go back to Ubuntu and call\nsudo update-grub\n\nThen you should have Windows 7 in your list again.\n\nA: Updating the grub installation with sudo update-grub should fix it.  When it runs, it searches for bootable images on each partition.  For example, here is the output when I run it:\nandy@ubuntu:~$ sudo update-grub\nGenerating grub.cfg ...\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.0-20-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.5.0-20-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.0-19-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.5.0-19-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-33-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-33-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-17-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.0.0-17-generic\nFound memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.bin\nFound Windows Recovery Environment (loader) on /dev/sda1\nFound Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda2\nFound Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda4\ndone\n\nIf that doesn't work, make sure you have a Live CD or USB to hand and try the following:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Check that the partition is actually readable and hasn't been corrupted (happened to be me about 2 months ago).  The easiest way to do this is to run GParted and check the list of partitions that appear.  (Testdisk may recover any lost partitions)\n\n*If everything's OK, boot to Windows Recovery and use Startup Repair\n\n*After making sure Windows will boot, restart and boot into your Live CD.\n\n*Use grub-install to reinstall grub.\n\n\nA: Apart from other Answers you can take a look for following links:\n\n\n*\n\n*WindowsDualBoot\n\nA: *\n\n*Use a Windows disc this way: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreUbuntu/XP/Vista/7Bootloader , until you get direct access to Windows\n\n*then use Boot-Repair to recover your GRUB menu\n\n\nA: I appreciate allof the answers, they really gave me valuable info as in what to do.\nBasically what I did was reinstall windows on the partition I had it on, it wrote the bootloader to the MBR, next I just used the Ubuntu Live CD and the instructions for reinstalling grub and alas, grub recovered and identifies the windows loader on startup thus solving my Dual Boot issue.\nI hope this post helps anybody else with the same problem.\nThanks community (:\n", "Q: How many languages are available in the Ubuntu distributions?

I have a Samsung Mini 2 and my wife has an original Samsung 2. I am working with Rhythmbox on 12.10. \nI was initially able to sync my Mini with Rhythmbox when I first set up. Then I deleted all the music that I had synced. But now, it will no longer sync with Rhythmbox. Rhythmbox can see it, can poll it, and tell how much space there is etc. But, the sync button is grayed out. \nI originally thought that I must have deleted a special file when I deleted the first set of music. However, when testing with my wife's phone, the same problem exists. I can drag and drop from various folders on my PC on to the phone. But it just won't sync via Rhythmbox. I tried the empty file .is_audio_player but that had no effect. \n\nA: For the googlers:\nI have read somewhere that Rhythmbox should have at least one music file on the phone. So, copying one file should be enough to make it work.\n\nA: I did the same thing with my HTC Desire HD. After several unsuccessful attempts I decided to \"sync\" it manually, that is, I copied a couple of songs in the Music folder. The next time I ran rhythmbox, it gave me the sync option!\nI have the .is_audio_player file, but I'm not sure if I really need it. One thing for sure is, that it didn't help by itself.

I booted the liveDVD, resized the sda2 partition (28gb of data resized to 30gb based on MiB [originally on a 100gb partition]) and made a new ext4 partition for the home folder. The drive is an SSD drive. I had changed the settings (noatime etc.) for SSD succesfully a week ago. On reboot I get the following error:\n/dev/sda2 contains a filesystem with errors\nInode 74669 has an invalid extent node (blk 6881289)\nfsd / [953] terminated with status 4\n\nI was following this HOWTO, but I did not get to changing any of the files or configs other than those with gparted.\nI have a (two-week old) SSD Samsung drive which is functioning just fine.

It had to do with ecryptfs. See: eCryptfs: Input/output error. I reinstalled.\n\nA: So you increased the size of sda2? A filesystem can live in a partition bigger than its size, but if you want take advantage of this additional size, you have to resize your filesystem. Gparted should have done this for you automatically. Usually this isn't a risky process... Did the Gparted operation went through without errors?\nThe mentioned block 6881289 is inside your partition size (at 26.25GiB) so this block should be just fine...\nI would suggest to check your partition table again, did you move your sda2 partition? Is the partition than before? Try using fdisk and the command (p)print.\nThen you should do a full fsck on that drive (run on the unmounted filesystem from a LiveCD). Scan for bad blocks using the -c option (-f for force, means even the fs is marked as clean and -v for verbose). If more errors appear, there is probably a hardware failure.\nfsck -cvf /dev/sda2\n\n", "Q: does eCryptfs support multiple users? I'm new to ecryptfs and I need some clarification on how it works.\nSuppose there are two root users userA and userB, If I mount some folder under userA:\n[userA@Dev] $ mount ecryptfs real img\nnow I can visit the img folder to access decrypted data.  \nMy questions is:\nWhile userA is still in log in state. Can userB login and  access the decrypted data? This is currently what I observed on my local machine, but I'm not sure if it was cause by my misconfiguration.  If it is the case, how can I avoid other users from accessing the decrypted data while userA is in login state?\n\nA: Yes its possible to access other users decrypted data, since eCryptFS does not distincts who is accessing a file. eCryptFS only manages the encryption/decryption of the files on the disk. As soon as it is mounted, any permitted user can read/write encrypted files transparently.\nHowever, Linux has other technics to define access to a file or directory: E.g. the POSIX file permissions. So its highly recommended to simply restrict access to a private directory to only the user who has the key to it...\nchown -R user ~/Private\nchmod -R 700 ~/Private\n\nThere is also a FAQ entry: http://ecryptfs.sourceforge.net/ecryptfs-faq.html#no-ecryptfsac\n", "Q: Unable to install Netbeans 6.9 in ubuntu 12.04 Unable to install netbeans 6.9.1 to ubuntu 12.04\nroot@cybage-virtual-machine:/home/rdas/Downloads# ./netbeans-6.9.1-ml-linux.sh Configuring the installer...

Besides, I apologize if I was rude with the wording of the situation. Any constructive review is welcome.\nNote: I've already made the partitions in the HDDs (carefully sized, of course).\n\nA: Let's suppose this scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1, sda2, sda3 are the 3 partitions where you got installed the listed operating systems;\n\n*sda4 is your free partition\n\n\nFirst of all, you can only set a mountpoint for one partition. So if you want to set / you can only choose one partition. If you can select two then it should be a bug. There are tools like LVM and mdadm that should let you do something similar (use two partitions as the same mountpoint, either mirrored or stripped).\nSupposing you want to setup / mountpoint. When you select a partition, you have the option to format it. So, if you set the mountpoint of / to sda1, if you choose to format it your old OS is gone. If not your system will be installed there, and files with the same name will probably be overwritten.\nHope this helps you.\n", "Q: After installing Ubuntu I can't boot Windows 8 anymore I just bought a new laptop (a lenovo ideapad Z500) and it came installed with Windows 8.

I added some launchers on the top panel, but they are placed too tightly (also take a look at separators, they aren't really separate anything):\n\nCan I increase the spacing between the launchers?\nAFAIK this can be done by the editing of ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css. I've managed to toggle bold font setting for the panel this way. But I haven't found which parameter have an influence on the launcher and applet spacing.\nAlso the size of icons seems too big for me - they occupy all place from the top to the bottom of the panel, without any border. They were smaller when I was using 10.04. Is there any way to reduce their size also?\n\nA: I've finally managed to resolve spacing problem and ready to share my solution. Add to ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css following lines:\n.gnome-panel-menu-bar.menubar .menuitem,\nPanelWidget .button {\n    padding: 0px 4px;\n}\n\nFirst line affects spacing of the menu headers (Applications and Places), second one affects launchers spacing. Here is the result:\n\nYou can increase spacing even more, changing second padding parameter (6 pixel will make it even with the spacing of the Indicator Applet icons in the top right corner), but I'm pretty happy with 4 pixel. Remember that increasing of padding will also make task buttons on the bottom panel wider, as they are also Panel Widgets. Or you can set spacing separately for the menu headers and launchers - it's up to you:\n.gnome-panel-menu-bar.menubar .menuitem {\n    padding: 0px 4px;\n}\n\nPanelWidget .button {\n    padding: 0px 3px;\n}\n\nUpdate: Finally found the way to increase panel separators padding. Add to ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css several more lines:\nPanelSeparator {\n    padding: 4px 8px;\n}\n\nFirst padding parameter will reduce the length of separators, second one will make the spacing on both sides of the separator.\nHere is the final result:\n\n", "Q: Why can't I get to a shared folder from Windows I want to access a folder on my new Ubuntu 12.10 box from any machine on my network without the need to provide credentials. \nMy machine name is Ubuntu1\nI have a 2TB disk that formatted NTFS that has media on it\nThe mount point is mount1\nI have numerous folders on the disk and I want to share each of them individually\nI have enabled folder1 and folder2 for sharing\nI have enabled shared access, Allow others to create and delete files in this folder and guest access is allowed.\nThe folder icon now has arrows so I assume all is good.\nFrom windows I can see under network\nUbuntu1>folder1\nUbuntu1>folder2\nWhen I click to open the folder from windows I get the error \"You cannot access \\Ubuntu1\\folder1\nYou do not have permission to access \\Ubuntu1\\folder1\nI have them both on the same workgroup.\nYour assistance would be appreciated\n\nA: Try running this command on your Ubuntu server:\nsudo -u nobody ls \"/path/to/my/share\"\n\nThat will try to access your shared folder as user nobody.  If you see an error like this:\nls: cannot access /path/to/my/share: Permission denied\n\nthen your local permissions are the problem (or at least a part of it).\n\nSamba uses Linux filesystem permissions to determine whether it should grant access to shared files; if permissions block access to the shared folder itself, Samba will refuse to allow other machines to connect to the share at all.  Guest access uses the nobody user (from group nogroup), so you should use the 'other user' file permissions to ensure that guests can access your shared folder.\n\nIt's important to check permissions on all the directories leading from / down to your shared folder too: if a user doesn't have execute permissions for a directory then they're prevented for accessing any paths below that point, including your share.  (I created the ls error message above by removing 'x' permissions from an intermediate directory.)\nLet's say you wanted to share /mnt/external/ntfs-drive/folder.  You could add the 'x' permissions on all the parent directories with this command:\nsudo chmod o+x /mnt /mnt/external /mnt/external/ntfs-drive\n\nYou also need to set read, write and execute permissions for the shared folder and any contents, but for parent directories execute permission is enough.\n\nA: Samba needs you to authenticate as a valid user.\nYou either have to enable guest access or create a user with the same username/password combination on Windows...\n\nA: I had the same problem where I could not share files even with the guest access enabled.  I also had the same stat permission denied errors in my log.  Apparently these errors are \"normal\" and are not the real problem.  In my case the problem was my home directory permissions.  My permissions were rwx for the user and no permissions for group or other.  Setting the execute bit for \"other\" users fixed the problem.  Something like this should do the trick:\nsudo chmod o+x /home/your-home\n\n\nA: Hi the answers already here are good and correct but they do not show that there is a very easy way to fix this using the Ubuntu GUI way.  \nRight click on your folder you want to share got to the sharing properties and choose, \n\nAllow others to create and delete files in this folder\n\nand\n\nGuest Access (for people without a user account)\n\nas this image shows.\n\nor you can do as Falstaff has correctly said to create an account on Windows with the same user name and pass, or vice versa, create a unix account with the same user pass.\n\nA: As falstaff explained, you need to allow guest from your Ubuntu1 machine or create credentials.\nI suggest you to have a look at this guide.\nI used it to fix access from both sides (linux/windows clients) to access other SMB shares.\n", "Q: How do I add a network printer in Ubuntu 12.04?

And in particular, will the multitouch gestures work?\n\nA: I'm using T650 on Ubuntu 13.04 (title) and found next gestures:\nThis basic functions works by default.\n1.Mouse-left: Click touchpad.\n2.Mouse-right: Click touchpad from right bottom corner.\n3.Mouse-mid: Tap with three fingers.\n4.Scroll-vertical: Slide two fingers up or down.\n5.Scroll-horizontal: Slide two fingers left or right.\n6.Open unity search (same as Super-button): Swipe three fingers up. \nNext gestures are not defined by default. You can define them example as 'Keyboard shortcuts'. A custom keyboard shortcut can be almost anything. If you do it this way select the shortcut you want define it will ask for 'new accelerator' and then do the motion.\nGesture - System recognized keyboard button.\n7.Three fingers swipe down: Super + D\n8.One finger swipe from left edge: Ctrl + Super + Backspace\n9.One finger swipe from top edge: Ctrl + Super + TouchpadOff\n10.One finger swipe from right edge: Alt + Super + TouchpadOff\nNext gestures don't work (as on Windows 8):\nLeft click as Tap.\nSpread or pinch with two fingers (zoom).\nThree fingers swipe left or right.\nFour fingers swipe up or down.\nFour fingers swipe left or right. \nI think this is still quite useful touchpad even you can't use all gestures as on Windows 8 where it was designed for. Either configuring those extra gestures I listed isn't too easy. \n\nA: As of Feb 19, 2014 there is a new firmware update on the Logitech site that enhances out of the box gestures support for this touchpad. The firmware update process requires a windows box, but once it is done you can use the touchpad on Linux with the enhanced features without any extra software.\nHere is the link:\nhttp://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/touchpad-t650?section=downloads&crid=398&bit=32&osid=14&softwareid=11370\n\nA: Good news and bad.  Yes, it does work on Linux but, because the Logitech T650 is made specifically for Windows, (unless I've been missing something) it is actually a very limited device (doesn't recognize \"tap\", etc.).  As already stated, it does have some basic gestures like 2-finger scrolling and fwd/back for the browser.\nIf you are going to spend the money, (IMO) it's better spent on an Apple Magic Trackpad.  You lose the built-in rechargable battery but you gain a large number of functions.\n\nA: You can find some useful information at this url\nhttp://cmattoon.com/articles/logitech-t650-ubuntu\nThere you can sea what works and what doesn't work at the moment at Linux. Some gestures work and the mechanical click also works, but clicking by tabbing for example doesn't work.\n\nA: So I just bought the t650 today and with the help of\nxev I was able to figure out how to get all of the button presses.  I have not tried to map any buttons to specific functions but as far as I can tell here are the default mappings.  As of yet I have not found a solution to tapping registering as a click. :-(\nButton 1 (Left-click): This occurs whenever the touchpad is pressed down with 1 or 2 fingers so that either the front right and/or front left foot is pressed.  Sole exception is when a single finger is pressed above the right foot.\nButton 2 (Right-click): This occurs whenever the touchpad has a finger placed above the right foot and either front foot is depressed.\nButton 3 (Middle-click): This occurs like a left-click event but 3 fingers are used to press the touchpad.\nButton 4 & 5 (scroll-wheel): Button 4 occurs when two fingers are slid upward on the touchpad and button 5 when two fingers are slid downward.\nButton 6 & 7 : Button 6 occurs when two fingers are slid to the left on the touchpad and button 7 when two fingers are slid to the right.\nButton 8 & 9 : Button 8 occurs when three fingers are slid to the left and button 9 occurs when three fingers are slid to the right.\nOf course moving one finger over the touchpad moves the mouse on-screen.  I also found that moving three fingers up on the touchpad is the same as pressing the super (windows) key.\nSo that's what I found and I hope it is helpful to anyone who uses the t650.\nEdit: This was taken almost verbatim from a review on Amazon.\n\nA: For everything to work, a firmware upgrade might be needed. It involves a Windows computer and is unfortunately not as straightforward as downloading the firmware from the Logitech website and installing it, although that's what Logitech wants you to believe.\nI spend a couple of hours trying to figure everything out, but finally found an answer in a thread in Logitech support forum (it's the answer by AndyCalling at 03-29-2014 07:52 PM).\nBy the way, I'd recommend using the brilliant Solaar to manage Unifying Receiver and connected devices.\n\nA: I believe many of these answers may be outdated, in terms of requiring an additional firmware download. I've used the Logitech T650, which I purchased in 2017, with the following Ubuntu distros, and it has worked fine without any additional downloads:\n\n*\n\n*KDE Neon 18 - 22\n\n*Pop!_OS 19 - 22\n\n*Kubuntu 19.04\n\n*Lubuntu 18.04\n\n*Budgie 18.04\n\n*MATE 19.04\n\nOne caveat: In the KDE desktops (Neon/Kubuntu/Lubuntu), tapping-as-click and \"natural scrolling\" are not enabled by default; you must do so in the touchpad settings. Unfortunately, the setting doesn't seem to be persistent (and in some cases it won't even let you set it via the GUI), so I do it via bash alias:\nalias xinput.='xinput set-prop \"Logitech Rechargeable Touchpad T650\" \"libinput Natural Scrolling Enabled\" 1; xinput set-prop \"Logitech Rechargeable Touchpad T650\" \"libinput Tapping Enabled\" 1;'\n\n(If for some reason this doesn't work, you can do it interactively, via the sequence\nxinput # look for your device number, e.g. 12\nxinput list-props 12 # look for the numbers for the tapping-enabled property\nxinput set-prop 12 290 1 # set the property\n\nNote that the numbers are not consistent between sessions, so using the named properties, as in the alias example above, is preferred.\n", "Q: Difference left/right super button When I press my left Super key the gnome shell appears and when I press the right Super key it does not. Moreover pressing right Super + T does open a terminal at once, but when using left super I have to press the T twice, when I press the T only once it is similar to just pressing the T without holding Super left. This last point also occurs with other shortcuts that I defined (like Super+L, Super+E), but not with Super+Up/Down/Left/Right.\nWhat I want is to press either Super key to get the gnome shell and to use either Super key  in combination with T to open a terminal immediately (and similar with other shortcuts). I use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and the gnome 3 shell.\n\n\nA: xmodmap solution\nI think you can do this using xmodmap, a tool to modify keymaps. Since my keyboard does not have a right Super key I cannot confirm this solution, so please leave a comment if it doesn't work.\nAll steps are done in a terminal\nPrint the current modifier map\nRun\nxmodmap\n\nThis should print the current modifier map which should like something like this\nxmodmap:  up to 4 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):\n\nshift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)\nlock      \ncontrol     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)\nmod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Meta_L (0xcd)\nmod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)\nmod3      \nmod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)\nmod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  Mode_switch (0xcb)\n\nThe important line is the mod4 line, this line shows which key codes are mapped to the Super_L and Super_R key symbols.\nBackup the key map\nBefore we change anything it is a good idea to backup the current key map, we can do this with\nxmodmap -pke > ~/.xmodmap.orig\n\nNow if anything goes wrong you can simply type\nxmodmap ~/.xmodmap.orig\n\nto restore your original key map. (If you made some serious mistakes and you cannot properly type anymore, a reboot also works)\nCheck current key map for the Super keys\nAssuming that the Super keys have consecutive key codes (0x85 and 0x86 in this case) we can check the current mapping by running\nxmodmap -pke | grep -wA1 $((0x85))\n\nwere of course you should change the 0x85 by the key code you have from your modifier map. This should give you\nkeycode 133 = Super_L NoSymbol Super_L\nkeycode 134 = Super_R NoSymbol Super_R\n\n( the $((0x85)) converts the hexadecimal number to decimal)\nCopy the behavior of the left Super to the right Super\nAs you can see from the previous step the right Super key has key code 134 but we want it to have the behaviour of the left Super key which has keycode 133. We can do this by remapping the key using\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 134 = Super_L NoSymbol Super_L\"\n\nChecking if it works\nIf you now do\nxmodmap -pke | grep -wA1 $((0x85))\n\nyou should see\nkeycode 133 = Super_L NoSymbol Super_L\nkeycode 134 = Super_L NoSymbol Super_L\n\nmeaning that both keys now have the same behavior. Also the modifier map should have changed on the line with mod4, we can check this by running\nxmodmap | grep 'mod4'\n\nwhich should give\nmod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_L (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)\n\nAnd of course the shortcuts which you mentioned should work too!\nMake mapping persistent\nIf it works, you can make sure that these settings are automatically applied when you boot. Run\necho 'keycode 134 = Super_L NoSymbol Super_L' >> ~/.xmodmaprc\n\nto store your custom key mapping in the file ~/.xmodmaprc. Run\necho 'xmodmap ~/.xmodmaprc' >> ~/.xsessionrc\n\nto make sure the custom key map is executed when your window manager loads.\n", "Q: Ubuntu live dvd spins down during boot on 2007 macbook I'm trying to install xubuntu 12.10 on a 2007 macbook.\nI have burned the .iso file on a cd correctly and it boots on my desktop, however when I try to boot it on the laptop, while it seems to boot, at some point before loading up any ubuntu graphics or kernel messages, the cd spins down and the screen is stuck displaying a blinking cursor.\nI tried rebooting the machine several times but it always does the same.\nAlthough the drive should be worn out (it's a five year old laptop and most of apple stuff is not designed to be usable for that long in the end) both the already installed xubuntu and macos can read the disk correctly.\nAny suggestions on how I could boot it?\n\nA: Given a dozen tries it worked, I guess with a machine that old and/or dammaged I need to consider alternative ways of installing or buy an external drive\n", "Q: Gnome-shell installed through updates Recently, I noticed that update manager was installing gnome-shell.\nTo be sure that is the case, I tried logging in with the Gnome option and I got to the Gnome 3 window manager.\nTrying to remove it through sudo apt-get autoremove gnome-shell doesn't warn of the automatic removal of other packages, suggesting it is not a dependency issue.\nI do not intend to use gnome-shell.

So far I have created a .conf script to separate log in custom log file based on program name and it's working correctly.\nBut, I want to limit the size of log file at 10K and I am using $outchannel for this purpose. The script is stored as /etc/rsyslog.d/00-abc_log.conf:\n$outchannel o_abc, /var/log/abc.log, 10240, /home/xyz/logrot\nif $programname == 'abc' then :omfile:$o_abc\n\nand script /home/xyz/logrot contains the following:\nmv -f /var/log/abc.log /var/log/abc.log.1\n\nBelow the 10K limit the logging is working correctly, but after log exceeds 10K size limit, file abc.log.1 doesn't generated and logging in abc.log stops.\nIf it matters, my system is Xubuntu 12.04 running rsyslog-5.8.6.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Your problem occurs because the application still has the file descriptor open after you moved it on the filesystem. Unless you can tell the program to restart logging directly after moving (usually for deamons, there's a signal for it like SIGHUP), you will have to use another method for rotation than moving files around to which are written into at that time\nI suggest to use logrotate like the following. Haven't tested it, as you haven't shared the application involved.\nCreate your own logrotate configuration file, e.g. abclogrotate.conf:\n/var/log/abc.log {\n    # don't use time based rotation, but size-based\n    size 10k\n    # don't move, but copy-and-truncate so the application won't have to be\n    # told that the file has moved.\n    copytruncate\n    # maximum of one old file\n    rotate 1\n    # counting old files starts at 1 rather than 0\n    start 1\n    # don't use compression\n    nocompress\n}\n\nNow call logrotate like this: logrotate /path/to/abclogrotate.conf rather than your own script.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Ubuntu in UEFI/EFI boot mode? I'm going to replace my old PC, and the new motherboard wont't have a traditional BIOS but uses UEFI boot mode. Is it possible to install Ubuntu 12.04 with this setup? Are there any known problems?\nI found some info about it online, but I would like to be sure before actually buying the components for my new PC.\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit is supposed to be the release which supports UEFI boot... is that correct?\nI only intend to run Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on this computer; no dual-boot with other OS's.\n\nA: Yes, it's possible to install Ubuntu 12.04 on an EFI-based system. Yes, there are also potential problems. Secure Boot is one potential problem. Another is that some computers have broken EFI implementations that don't honor their NVRAM boot loader settings, meaning you must copy your boot loader file to EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on the EFI System Partition (ESP). There are an assortment of other potential minor EFI-specific problems, most of which are fairly rare.\nIn a worst-case scenario, you should be able to install Ubuntu in BIOS/legacy mode -- most EFI motherboards support this type of operation. This may be limiting in the future, though, particularly if you've got an over-2TiB disk and you want to install Windows to it.\nOverall, I'd say: Just try it. If you run into problems, look for help in the forums or check here. (There are lots of EFI-related questions here, along with answers to most of them.)\n\nA: Yes Ubuntu 12.04 supports UEFI. However, it does not support Secure Boot, so you have to make sure Secure Boot is turned off in your BIOS configuration. \n\nA: I installed ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit on New PC with UEFI, and it work fine!\nIn UEFI settings there is possibility to disable/enable Secure boot mode.\n\nA: Clarification.

The Temperature Monitor in lxpanel (I'm using Lubuntu 12.10) is automatically detecting one of my sensors but I would like to give it an alternate one.\nHere is the output of sensors:\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +26.8°C  (crit = +100.0°C)\ntemp2:         +0.0°C  (crit = +100.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nCore 0:       +58.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +90.0°C)\nCore 2:       +55.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +90.0°C)\n\nIt looks like the Temperature Monitor is picking up temp1 automatically but I would like to set it to Core 0 or Core 2.

But there is another solution: lm-sensors LXDE lxpanel plugin.\nhttps://github.com/danamlund/sensors-lxpanel-plugin\nIt is simple to compile (in lubuntu 16.04 i also used debian install instructions) and simple to use:\n\n\nA: Simple solution\n1) Run this command to list types of available thermal_zone devices:\nls -1 /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/type | xargs -I % sh -c \"echo % ; cat %\"\nYou should get output similar to this:  \n/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/type\nacpitz\n/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone1/type\nacpitz\n/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/type\nx86_pkg_temp\n\n2) Find out which one you need, for CPU it should have type similar to x86_pkg_temp. In my example, if I want to use x86_pkg_temp I will pick /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/. \n3) Specify it in \"Temperature Monitor\" settings, make sure it is slash-terminated (enclosed with \"/\" at the end, just like in my example):\n\nDone, it should work as intended now.  \n\nMore details and alternative solution\nStarted using LUbuntu desktop today and found myself looking on same problem.\nAfter poking around and cracking open source code of /plugins/thermal/thermal.c I found some solutions.\nFirst of all, parameter \"Sensor\" in options refers to location of it as directory.\nLooking on sources it can detect 3 types of sensor directories in automatic mode, and looks for them in /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/, /sys/class/thermal/ and /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon[i]/, functions to look for those are called here:  \nstatic void\ncheck_sensors( thermal *th )\n{\n    // FIXME: scan in opposite order\n    find_sensors(th, PROC_THERMAL_DIRECTORY, NULL, proc_get_temperature, proc_get_critical);\n    find_sensors(th, SYSFS_THERMAL_DIRECTORY, SYSFS_THERMAL_SUBDIR_PREFIX, sysfs_get_temperature, sysfs_get_critical);\n    if (th->numsensors == 0)\n        find_hwmon_sensors(th);\n    g_info(\"thermal: Found %d sensors\", th->numsensors);\n}  \n\nNow, looking on what happens when you set config, we see this:  \nif(th->sensor == NULL) th->auto_sensor = TRUE;\n    if(th->auto_sensor) check_sensors(th);\n    else if (strncmp(th->sensor, \"/sys/\", 5) != 0)\n        add_sensor(th, th->sensor, th->sensor, proc_get_temperature, proc_get_critical);\n    else if (strncmp(th->sensor, \"/sys/class/hwmon/\", 17) != 0)\n        add_sensor(th, th->sensor, th->sensor, sysfs_get_temperature, sysfs_get_critical);\n    else\n        add_sensor(th, th->sensor, th->sensor, hwmon_get_temperature, hwmon_get_critical);\n\nFrom what I understood, th->sensor is set to what you specify in \"Sensor\" input field in options.\nFirst there is check if auto_sensor is set, and if it is not, it will do series of other checks.\nBreaking down this part, if your sensor path does not inlude /sys/ in it, it will use proc_get functions, which is outdated acpi type sensor that is not used in new versions of Ubuntu. Otherwise, if your path includes /sys/class/hwmon it will use hwmon functions, and finally if it is other type of /sys/*, it will use sysfs type of sensor.\nBased on that we can conclude that easiest way would be to specify sensor located in /sys/class/thermal/, for example /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone1. If we would go with /sys/class/hwmon/, it would not pick right sensor anyway, because there is no way to specify exact temp[i]_input to be used, and if we would use non /sys/ directory, it would assume we using outdated acpi/thermal_zone, which is not ideal as well. You could create script that will create fake sensor directory in your home folder with 2 files, trip_points and temperature.\ntrip_points would look like this and does not matter much:  \ncritical (S5): 110 C\npassive: 105 C: tc1=2 tc2=10 tsp=100 devices=0xdf72e380\nactive[0]: 48 C: devices=0xc157fec0  \n\ntemperature would be one to be read for current temperature and should look like this:  \ntemperature: 49 C  \n\nFinally, you would need script to update those files from actual sensor you want to use and schedule it to run each N seconds.\nThis solution would allow using /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon1 kind of sensors and manually read value to be used by LXpanel thermal indicator. You could also use this method to make this thermal indicator display other kind of indicators, but that seems like waste of effort, considering you could just use another indicator instead. I will update with sample script to do it later, if it will be required\\I will make one for myself.\n", "Q: How to add server to the list in Starcraft brood war (Ubuntu, Wine) I'm running Starcraft via Wine.

As you see, I had to ctrl-C to escape. The same happens using other commands such as\n$ ls foo'bar\n$ mkdir foo'bar\n\nI'm curious about the sense of all this, that is what special meaning \"'\" has in terminal commands (so special in fact that it is taken apart even inside ids).\nExtra: As an aside I would also like to know the set of special or otherwise invalid characters in file and folder names, both under Unix-like and Windows systems (to get the common subset of safe ones) (in particular, what about all non-ASCII?).\nThank you,\nDenis\n\nA: Character ' is a special character. You use it to mark part of command line entry that won't be changed (e.g. no replacement for wildcards). For example:\n$ ls 'bla*'\nls: cannot access bla*: No such file or directory\n\nThis means that argument for ls was bla* and not everything that begins with bla. \nThe reason why you get > character is because you must use one ' for opening and one ' for closing part that won't be changed.\nIf you want to use ' in folder names you must escape it like this: \\'. So if you want to list folder named foo'bar you should type ls foo\\'bar.\nOh, and I'm not sure if it is possible to use ' in environment variable names. I think that you cannot use export foo\\'bar=1,\nHope this helps.\n\nA: The ' character  is a very powerful character whenever used in any shell command. Basically the ' (apostrophe marks) disables all kinds of transformations or modifications. It would consider whatever is enclosed with the ' marks as a single entity i.e. a single parameter. Absolutely no sort of substitution or expansion would take place.\nExample:  \n $ echo '$HOME'\n\nwould produce at the output the string $HOME itself and would not print the path to your home directory. Since the single quotes prevents any sort of expansion, substitution and simple considers whatever to be present as a simple parameter in itself.\nIf you want to use the apostrophe as it is, you have to escape it:\n $ mkdir foo\\'bar\n\n $ cd foo\\'bar\n\nIf it is not escaped, it will wait for it's pair to be closed, like it happened in your first example.\nSo, corrected, your command will be:   \n $ export foo\\'bar=1\n\nNOTE:\nAs Milan Todorovic noticed, this will not be valid, because you cannot use apostrophe in this case.\n", "Q: How to set up an rsync backup to Ubuntu securely? I have been following various other tutorials and blog posts on setting up a Ubuntu machine as a backup \"server\" (I'll call it a server, but it's just running Ubuntu desktop) that I push new files to with rsync.  Right now, I am able to connect to the server from my laptop using rsync and ssh with an RSA key that I created and no password prompt when my laptop is connected to my home router that the server is also connected to.  I would like to be able to send files from my laptop when I am away from home.  Some of the tutorials I have looked at had some brief suggestions about security, but they didn't focus on them.  \nWhat do I need to do to let my laptop with send files to the server without making it too easy for someone else to hack into the server?\nHere is what I have done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ran ssh-keygen and ssh-copy-id to create a key pair for my laptop and server.\n\n*Created a script on the server to write its public ip address to a file, encrypt the file, and upload to an ftp server I have access to (I know I could sign up for a free dynamic DNS account for this part, but since I have the ftp account and don't really need to make the ip publicly accessible I thought this might be better).\nHere are the things I have seen suggested:\n\n\n*\n\n*Port forwarding: I know I need to assign the server a fixed ip address on the router and then tell the router to forward a port or ports to it.  Should I just use port 22 or choose a random port and use that?\n\n*Turn on the firewall (ufw).  Will this do anything, or will my router already block everything except the port I want?\n\n*Run fail2ban.\nAre all of those things worth doing?  Should I do anything else?  Could I set up the server to allow connections with the RSA key only (and not with a password), or will fail2ban provide enough protection against malicious connection attempts?  Is it possible to limit the kinds of connections the server allows (e.g. only ssh)?\nI hope this isn't too many questions.  I am pretty new to Ubuntu (but use the shell and bash scripts on OSX).  I don't need to have the absolute most secure set up.  I'd like something that is reasonably secure without being so complicated that it could easily break in a way that would be hard for me to fix.\n\nA: Ok, I think your trying to over architect a bit. SSH is one of the most secure file transfer protocols and if your already rsyncing over ssh then your 90% there.  Your router is acting as a basic firewall so you shouldn't need to turn on iptables for a personal backup server. \nStick with port 22. It will make life much easier.  \nfail2ban is a nice script for public servers, specially where password based logins are enabled. On your server it's going  to make more problems then it will fix. I wouldn't recommend running it. Here are my suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go ahead and get the dynamic IP, it will make it easier, and about the time you go traveling, your ftp script will fail for some really strange reason.  Basically KISS.\n\n*Disable Password logins for ssh. In /etc/sshd_config change PasswordAuthentication yes to PasswordAuthentication no, and make sure challengeresponse is set to  no. That will bock any one without your private key from logging in at all. \n\n\nOther then that your pretty much covered by default. ssh encrypts traffic and verifies the host/client. There not a lot left after that. \n", "Q: Cannot install Ubuntu I'm using Windows 7 and when I try to install and this message appears: \n\"An error ocurred: Could not retrieve the required installation files\nFor more information, please see the log file:\nc:\\users\\.............\\wubi-12.10-rev273.log\"\n\nThe final part of the log -> \n12-17 13:43 DEBUG  Distro:   checking whether F:\\ is a valid Ubuntu CD\n12-17 13:43 DEBUG  Distro:   parsing info from str=Ubuntu 12.10 \"Quantal Quetzal\" - Release i386 (20121017.2)\n12-17 13:43 DEBUG  Distro:   parsed info={'name': 'Ubuntu', 'subversion': 'Release', 'version': '12.10', 'build': '20121017.2', 'codename': 'Quantal Quetzal', 'arch': 'i386'}\n12-17 13:43 INFO   Distro: Found a valid CD for Ubuntu: F:\\\n12-17 13:43 INFO   root: Running the uninstaller...\n12-17 13:43 INFO   CommonBackend: This is the uninstaller running\n12-17 13:43 DEBUG  WindowsFrontend: __init__...\n12-17 13:43 DEBUG  WindowsFrontend: on_init...\n12-17 13:43 INFO   WinuiPage: appname=wubi, localedir=C:\\Users\\TASSO'~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pylED6A.tmp\\translations, languages=['en_US', 'en']\n12-17 13:43 INFO   WindowsFrontend: Operation cancelled\n12-17 13:43 DEBUG  WindowsFrontend: frontend.quit\n12-17 13:43 DEBUG  WindowsFrontend: frontend.on_quit\n12-17 13:43 DEBUG  root: application.on_quit\n12-17 13:43 INFO   root: sys.exit\n\n\nA: This was answered in comments.\n\nYou can try the option --skipmd5check.

Unsure if you can still set up tunnels. \nBTW the documentation for OpenVPN2 is pretty good and if you can run through firewalls, you can probably run OpenVPN2 too.\nCheck out this sslh project which allows you to run a common webserver and ssh (or openvpn for that matter) on the same port! http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh That way you can 'hide' your ssh server behind a proper webserver ;o)\nLast but not least: Check out proxytunnel, which enables you to run SSH over HTTPS which fools even more firewalls.\nNotice though that a security officer may very well be extremely un-amused when he/she finds out that you are using these tools (ssh over port 80 or 443, proxytunnel, openvpn) to squeeze through a corporate firewall to access unsupported services.

I'm having a hard time sorting out what script or program calls the precise-wallpapers.xml or quantal-wallpapers.xml?  After upgrading to 12.10, my wallpaper selection is still the precise-wallpapers.xml, though the quantal xml file and all the wallpaper files exist in usr/share/backgrounds directory.\nRelated, certainly there must be a prober script similar in concept to the 30-os-prober script for grub for creating those .xml files, right?\n\nA: The Appearance module of gnome-control-center is what loads the XML files in /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/ to get a list of installed wallpapers. It always loads all of the xml files in this directory.\nThere is no script similar to the grub thing for these XML files. The XML files are static and included in packages. If you still have the precise-wallpapers.xml file there, then you still have the ubuntu-wallpapers-precise package installed after an upgrade. If you've ever altered the settings by choosing a different image as your background, then upgrading will not automatically cause the background to change to the new default.\n", "Q: How export contacts of ubuntu one? How export contacts of Ubuntu one in 12. 10?\nAnother questions (possible duplicates) is about old versions, and packages like evolution-couchdb are removed in previous versions, thunderbird don't support couchdb.\nI can see my contacts in https://one.ubuntu.com/contacts/.\n\nA: For now, the contacts are still backended to CouchDB. This will stop being the case over the next few months (this should get updated when that happens).\nWhat you need to do is determine the right endpoint for your couchdb instance on the server, and then query that using the couchdb REST API. As all these requests need to be OAuth-signed, it's not trivial to do; there is Roman's tool that will put the credentials into environment variables you can use to build URLs for curl or wget, there is a helper u1oauthrequest (part of the old ubuntuone-couch) that gets your credentials from the keyring, signs the given URL, and prints the result. There is a little script I just threw together from scripts used by people on my team.\nIf you save the latter in a file called u1couch-backup.py, you can then call it via\npython u1couch-backup.py\n\nand it should print out the information about your contacts database. If you want to get the list of documents you'd do\npython u1couch-backup.py /contacts/_all_docs\n\nand if you want the actual documents and not just the ids and revnos you'd do\npython u1couch-backup.py /contacts/_all_docs?include_docs=true\n\nThe whole thing is quite unreliable to be honest so you might need to retry a couple of times, or retry at a less-busy time, which is why we flagged it for EOL over a year ago. The move to u1db should make this quite a lot better (soon!), at which point I'll update this answer.\n\nA: There is a script that creates a vCard file from the data that is stored in Ubuntu One online couchdb.

I would like to know if possible, then how to achieve \nWobbly Windows and cube on Cinnamon GUI ?\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04 minimal with cinnamon \nMDM is the login manager i use.\n\nA: To put it simply, you can't. Cinnamon uses a custom Window Manager called Muffin, which does not feature the wobbly windows and cube of Compiz. It may be possible to achieve these with a plugin, but you would have to write it yourself or ask someone on the Mint forums to do it.\n\nA: There is a wobbly windows extension here:\nhttp://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/extensions/view/24\n\nA: The short answer is you cannot. If you want compiz like effects there are extensions out there that can do that for you. I was able to get my alt-tab switcher to look similar to compiz with an extension. Unfortunately I haven't seen any that can do cube or wobbly windows. You can get extensions at the cinnamon website. I may write a cube and wobbly windows extension when I do start learning Java script. I am still learning python. So it is possible you just need to wait for an extension to roll around. But running compiz on cinnamon is impossible. If you want your compiz effects try Unity MATE GNOME Classic KDE, or XFCE if you want to spend hours working.

At the moment I rely on nautilus to manage the desktop, i.e. access ~/desktop from the desktop and display mounted drives as icons.\nCan the same thing be done with dolphin? If so, how?\nNote: I am searching for a way to start dolphin headless mode at startup, akin to nautilus with nautilus --no-default-window.\n\nA: Yes, but a lot of KDE related packages will be installed together (dependencies) during the installation, as Dolphin is designed for KDE.\n\nA: I think KDE uses KWin to manage the desktop. It even handles the compositing and desktop effects in KDE.\n\nA: KDE 4 uses plasma to handle the desktop. Dolphin does not handle the desktop. If you are looking for a replacement for Nautilus, I would suggest using Nemo from Linux Mint. It is a fork of Nautilus that gets away from the Gnome trend of less is better by adding back what was available in older versions of Nautilus. Search for Nemo or Cinnamon at launchpad.net to be sure you are using the active or best PPA. To get the one available at this time, add the repository with this command in a terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable\nUnfortunately, installing it also adds cinnamon desktop. There is another fork of Nautilus, but I am not sure that it is available as a package. LXDE has a default desktop manager. If Nautilus has taken over your desktop, uninstalling it should return the default desktop file manager, PCMan. This is not the same as the window manager which should be OpenBox by default.

However, when trying to add a new program I'm not able to give it a command-line, just an executable with no parameters.\nIs this even possible?\n\nA: You should be able to place any command-line options in a script (as below) and then select that script through the firefox menu. However, it is critical you include \"$@\" so that the file(s) passed from firefox will actually be opened. Otherwise, just a blank document would be opened. As an example, this is the sort of wrapper script that you use:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/share/playonlinux/playonlinux --run \"Microsoft Word 2010\" Z:\"$@\"\n\nIt is critical to include the Z: or the document will not be found by wine or its equivalent, as the Z: is a symlink to your filesystem.\nI also tried this with WordViewer in Wine and it worked with the following commands:\n#!/bin/bash\nwine /home/mike/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/Microsoft\\ Office/OFFICE11/WORDVIEW.EXE Z:\"$@\"\n\nIf you just wanted Libreoffice, you would instead use in the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nlibreoffice --writer \"$@\" \n\nThere is further detailed information in this useful article if you also wish to associate various file types with Microsoft Word 2010, as also discussed in this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to set MS Word 2010 as default application for all docx and other types?\nCreate a new text file, copy the contents of the first script (which is what you said you want) and make it executable.

Follow this guide HERE\nIts a few years old but the principle still applies. \n\nA: I am going to recommend you just use a X server on your windows box and connect using it. This post should work for you. Keep in mind that a lot of things in Linux are client server, including the GUI. So your Linux box can do all the work and your windows box can just be a dumb terminal. \nI have had pretty good luck with xming in the past.\n\nA: vnc4server -geometry 1024x768 -depth 24\nNew 'kvmsrv1:7 (root)' desktop is kvmsrv1:7\nStarting applications specified in /root/.vnc/xstartup\nLog file is /root/.vnc/kvmsrv1:7.log\nkvmsrv1:7\n\nUse this instead of IP.

I read from wireless developers that I have to run make menuconfig command to change some configuration of the wireless driver (enable/disable something). After changing, do I have to recompile the kernel to give effect to changes? If I have to, how to compile?\n\nA: First of all you have to get the kernel sources. Please have a look at the answer to »Getting the kernel source in Ubuntu«. It shows you where to get the sources. If you used the command apt-get source linux-source, you'll a tar.gz-file. You can double-click on it to unpack or use the command line:\ntar xfz linux.tar.gz\n\nYou might also need several other packages. This command installs all needed:\nsudo apt-get install git kernel-package fakeroot build-essential ncurses-dev\n\nNow you should change into the directory where your kernel sources reside. If you downloaded it with git they might be in the subdirectory linux. Otherwise they are copied to /usr/src.\nIn the next step you should copy your existing kernel config file to the source tree:\ncp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config\n\nAnd now you can execute\nmake menuconfig\n\nand enter your changes. Please see also the site GitKernelBuild in the Ubuntu wiki for more advice.\nAfter you saved your changes you can compile your new kernel:\nCONCURRENCY_LEVEL=`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN` fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-custom kernel_image kernel_headers\n\nand if you enter ls .. you'll see some .deb files. You can install them and use your new kernel.\n\nA: You can look here for more instructions for a Debian specific way.\n\nTo build the kernel, execute these two commands:\nmake-kpkg clean\nfakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-custom kernel_image kernel_headers\n\nAfter --append-to-version= you can write any string that helps you\n  identify the kernel, but it must begin with a minus (-) and must not\n  contain whitespace.\n\nThis site has more generic instructions, which look a lot more familiar:\n\nStart compiling to create a compressed kernel image, enter:  \nmake\n\nStart compiling to kernel modules:  \nmake modules\n\n\n\nA: Recompiling current 5.4.0 kernel on 20.04\nPreparation   \n$ sudo apt install build-essential bison flex gcc-9 g++-9 libncurses libncurses-dev libssl-dev \n\nThe next will download current kernel sources   \n$ sudo apt install linux-source  \n\nGo to the directory with kernel sources archive and extract it   \n$ cd /usr/src/linux-source-5.4.0/   \n$ sudo tar xvfj linux-source-5.4.0.tar.bz2   \n$ cd linux-source-5.4.0 \n\nConfigure kernel       \n$ sudo make menuconfig\n\nChange it if you like, save and exit\nCompile it using your number of threads after a \"-j\" option   \n$ sudo make -j2 deb-pkg LOCALVERSION=-cust\n\nInstall it   \n$ sudo apt install ../linux-*cust*.deb\n\nReference could help\n", "Q: How to install i386 library?

However, if that doesn't work, then it's likely that it won't work at all, especially if the package relies on GTK or anything in the GNOME stack. If you do manage to get something installed, it's pretty likely that it will not work as expected (and may even cause issues in other applications). This is due to incompatibilities between GTK and GNOME versions. \nA quick search shows that the XKCD browser may not be updated for a while. The linked AU question does provide a possible solution, but again, it may cause other issues. Cuttlefish is reported to work on 12.10 if you use the .deb file.\nBlubphone and xserver-xorg-input-synaptics are worth trying, as they probably have their own interface, or aren't dependent on the Gnome/GTK stacks.\nTo find out if a given piece of software works on a given version of Ubuntu, I generally have good luck with searching Google with something like \"ubuntu [version] [software name]\".\n", "Q: Can you make calls with Ubuntu on a Nexus 7?

It's possible that i could encrypt my hard disk without install everything again? And without loosing my files and programs already installed e configured?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The answer is probably no; full disk encryption (at least, using the native dm-crypt method) officially requires completely wiping the Ubuntu partition and reinstalling it inside an encrypted container. It is not possible to do this incrementally without employing third-party tools that come with a lot of disclaimers about the risks involved in this, e.g. LUKS In-Place\nHowever, encrypting the whole disk tends to be unnecessary, since there is little security implication in having the standard parts of an Ubuntu system stored unencrypted.

I use Evernote to keep voice and text notes.\nUnfortunately, I've just discovered that I can't take full advantage of the cloud storage capabilities of Evernote, because the AMR files won't play in Firefox (or Chrome). This problem is discussed in the Evernote forums, though the information there is a little out of date.\nAt first I was getting a \"missing plugin\" error. However, since then I have installed the Medibuntu repository, VLC player, and libopencore-amrnb0 version 0.1.3-2. Now, when I open an Evernote audio note in Firefox, I see this interface:\n\nWhile the plugin image seems promising, sadly, when I hit the play button (or right click and select \"Play\"), nothing happens.\nI have also now discovered that if I download the AMR file to my computer, and open it with VLC, it plays. It also plays in Totem and Mplayer. So the problem seems to be specific to playing AMR files within the browser.\nWhy would playing an AMR file using the VLC plugin in a browser be different from using the stand alone player? More importantly, how can I get Ubuntu to play AMR file directly in Firefox in Ubuntu?\n\nA: VLC can play AMR files. I have used VLC to play AMR files before. VLC also has an firefox plugin which can be used to play AMR files in firefox too .\n\nA: This not a direct fix but works for my purposes.\nThe extension Adblock Plus has an interesting feature that allows you to \"block\" any embedded media you'd like.  But in order to do that, it will tell you the full URL of that media file.\nWhat I do is install ABP on Firefox.\n\n\n*\n\n*On EverNote, mouse-over the \"missing plugin\" window, and a \"Block\" button will show up.\n\n*Click on the button and it will display the full URL of the AMR file.\n\n*Then simply copy/paste that URL in Firefox and the browser will allow you to work with it as a regular downloadable file. To save a few more seconds, simply set your Firefox to automatically open AMR files with VLC or Totem.\n\n\nIt does take a little fiddling, but once installed the process to open an audio note takes only seconds of copy and paste a URL.\nScreenshot here: http://p.lui.li/img-21223_screenshot_p-r-full.png\n", "Q: ubuntu freeze when I plugged the power cable I recently update the system(12.10) on my laptop and after that whenever I plug the power cable in to my laptop it freezes and has no function of the mouse or the keyboard. I have to reboot the laptop and after that it's fully functional.(with the power cable plugged in.) \nI need help to troubleshoot this problem or to report it as a bug if that is required.\n\nA: This is a bug, and should be reported as one. If you find (or someone else reports) an effective workaround, that can be included in the bug report. As per the FAQ, bugs are off-topic on Ask Ubuntu, so the only part of this question that should really be addressed here is the issue of how to report this bug. Detailed work and troubleshooting on bugs in Ubuntu needs to happen on Launchpad; otherwise, valuable work tends to be ignored and fragmented.\nPower management functionality is part of the kernel, so the correct way to report this bug is to run ubuntu-bug linux. Detailed technical information will be sent to Launchpad, but you will still have to describe the problem, including anything you've tried and what happened, in as much detail as possible.\nOne common mistake is to report power management bugs against the acpi  package. That's not the right way, since the acpi package doesn't actually perform any power management; it's just an interface for getting information about the power management that is happening in the kernel (Linux).\nI recommend that you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Trigger the problem.\n\n*Record the time that you triggered it.\n\n*(Re)boot your Ubuntu system.\n\n*Once booted back up, immediately report the bug.\n\n*Indicate that you have done all this in your bug report, and specify the time (or approximate time) you triggered the freeze.\n\n\nThat may make it easier for triagers, developers, and other interested persons to identify entries in automatically attached log files that pertain to the problem.\nIt's a very good idea to read this thoroughly before reporting this or any other bug in Ubuntu. This question is also often quite helpful.\nFinally, please note that if you are reporting this bug against the downstream kernel (linux in Ubuntu, reporting on Launchpad, as described here), you must be running (and you should have last produced the bug using) this version of the kernel, and not a custom-built or upstream kernel.org version.\nIf you report this bug or find it already reported, feel free to subscribe me to the bug if you wish.\n\nA: Do you have Jupiter installed on your system?\nIf you do, I advise you to uninstall it.

I'm a bit of a command line nuthead.\nI have a computer with dual monitors. Its setup works just fine in X11 - dual monitors, where my desktop stretches all the way across.\nHowever, what I would like is to replicate that behavior when I'm using the virtual terminal. Right now, it simply mirrors the output.\nIs there any way to have my resolution streeeeetch all the way across both monitors? e.g. instead of 80x24, I'd have 160x24?\n\nA: Sorry, I reread your question. In TTY without X, no. You can set a default boot connection mapped to a tty session, but without a separate session w/ keyboard map (such as serial/kbd and attached monitor/kbd) I don't know of a way to split that out and to be able to switch between the two. \nConsensus is that the console itself without X, it maps into a default tty session attached to a primary default device. That default device is mapped to default input devices. Theoretically, you could map devices to separate tty sessions, but the single kbd would still map to the primary device mapping. Sort of like me remembering the old-school separate debug monitor output for Borland C in DOS. The second monitor ended up as separate display, but you had no real interaction with it.\nAs for creating a virtual terminal and picking apart that session to diplay across two separate monitors... Not able to do that without some type of framebuffer (graphic's like X).\nIn real-world practice, I believe the answer is \"No.\"\n\nA: It is possible to get two ttys on two monitors by mapping them to corresponding frame buffers using Kernel parameters. You can even have background refresh by using fb terminal instead of the default tty (Getty in most cases)\nCheck this https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/556782/tty-dual-monitors for more clues.\n", "Q: How to migrate to KDE? In the next few weeks I'm going to be seriously trying KDE. I've noticed that I'm slowly ripping more and more out of the default Ubuntu system so I can stick with one panel on the bottom of the screen (Win95-style) so it seems to make sense to move to a KDE than stay with the sinking, unmaintained ship that is gnome-panel.\nI'll be testing in a persisting Live USB environment but assuming I like KDE, I'll want to migrate my existing install. A fresh Kubuntu install would take me too long to re-set-up all my server stuff.\nSo, what's the best way to install a proper KDE environment and then clean out the Gnome environment?\nIn the past, I've installed kubuntu-desktop to play with but this has trashed both environments with extra applications and dodgy file associations.\nIn a slightly separate vein, is it possible to have Gnome and KDE installed on the same instance of Ubuntu without them trashing each other with their own applications?\n\nA: I tend to create separate partitions for '/'  and '/home' so that a fresh install can be done without losing files and settings on the home partition...  That way you can try as many different distros as you like with a fresh install...\n\nA: You could use Mate, the Gnome 2 fork that is used in Linux Mint. That would not be sinking that badly.\nI think that the problem with file associations is that they are not specific for the desktop, but saved in some central folder. There is mimeopen and xdg-open, which do not have anything to do with either desktop. So I do not think that you can separate that, without using different user accounts.\nThere should be a KDE minimal package, that does not install too much stuff.\n", "Q: How to install clpqr library in SWI-Prolog I am using Ubuntu 12.10 and going to write Prolog program with clpqr.

However, even though the installer seems to correctly detect the RAID 0 array, GRUB2 is not installed and the computer boots into Windows normally. The same thing does not happen when installing Fedora 17. The installer (Anaconda) also detects the disk array, but GRUB2 installation is successful. What exactly are the differences between Ubiquity and Anaconda? And is there a way to correctly install GRUB2 in a fakeRAID system, since there are no alternative Ubuntu CDs?\n\nA: You need to put GRUB2 outside of the array, or it will not be seen and booted.\nWhen you create your arrays from the Intel utility, you need to leave a couple of hundred MB, on each drive, outside of the created arrays and put GRUB onto one of these, during the installation process. You can do this by creating a ~500MB array, then your ~100GB and ~60GB arrays and then going back and deleting your ~500MB array. This will leave you the necessary space at the start of the drive for your bootloader. You will then need to use Advanced Partitioning during installation and mount this as /boot.\nIt's been a while since I did this, but I think that this should work from the Live CD. Make sure that you have dmraid installed, and I'd advise doing most of your partitioning through gparted before running the installer. Format one of these two partitions to ext2 to mount your /boot on this, use the ~60GB (/dev/mapper/isw...) volume to create your / (root) (ext4), and swap (swap) partitions and then mount them in the Advanced Partitioning bit of the Ubuntu installer.\nMake sure that you select the low-down-on-the-list, individual entries for your (/dev/mapper/isw...) volumes for mounting during installation. \nDoes this help?\n\nA: I've found an effective way to do this. As Rich.T wrote, the /boot should be a separate partition at the start of the disk array. However, Ubiquity still won't correctly install the bootloader, so a workaround is to boot with an image of Ubuntu Secure Remix and run the Boot-Repair tool, following each procedure. An alternative way could be to either install the whole OS from the Secure Remix CD or to install Boot-Repair in the normal Ubuntu Live CD, however I have not tested it so I cannot guarantee they would work.\nNOTE: It is also required that both Ubuntu CDs boot into non-UEFI mode, otherwise it will not work.\n", "Q: xfce - Stop active window moving when switching workspace I've just switched from Gnome to xfce, and I'd like to know how to stop the active window moving when I change workspace. e.g. I have my internet browser selected then change to another workspace, the workspace will change but the internet browser will also move to that new workspace.\nIs this supposed to happen? Is there a setting somewhere I can use to stop it?\n\nA: This shouldn't happen if you move to the other workspace from the workspace switcher (top right usually). Make sure your window is not defined to appear always on the visible workspace (main window menu in upper left corner of the window title bar). (the right setting for what you want is \"Appears only in this workspace\").\nSee also if the window isn't fixed (appears on all workspaces). This is applied when you click on the small left icon (pin or cirle usually) on the window title bar next to the \"main window menu\" (with maximize ... close) in the corner.

You can use the editor vim:\nsudo vim /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nand enter the sequence 1050Gf.r>:wq.

Assuming you are using Geany:\n\n\n*\n\n*gksu geany +1050 /var/lib/dpkg/status\nThis command  will first ask for your user password and afterwards open the file at line 1050. The line should begin with Depends and you'll find the dot after the opening braket.\n\n*Move the cursor to the dot and change it to >.

You can find it by navigating to Empathy>>preferences>>calls>>\nSkype has an automatic noise cancellation/echo cancellation function, so those calls should also not be a problem.

What is the likely source of echo or noise? etc\n\nA: Echo cancellation in Ubuntu can be done by running:\npactl load-module module-echo-cancel\n\n\nA: What you want to do is basically the same as Echo cancellation in telephony.\nhttp://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+echo+cancellation is simple introduction. Also have a look at the pages for the mark and mark2 echo canceller there and the mentioned TI application note.\nAlso this site: http://www.embeddedstar.com/articles/2003/7/article20030720-1.html explains the mechanics quite well.\nYou'll have to intercept both the music player's output and the microphone input, and then pass the samples via some sort of IPC into your DSP process. JACK actually does this, but setting things up (e.g. ALSA->JACK bridge, if your music player and/or Skype does not natively support JACK as sound interface) does require some skill.\nI guess it could work fairly well, but it probably requires quite some CPU. Especially XRUNS (audio buffer under- or overrun) can be really bad for your echo canceller, i.e. you might need realtime linux kernel patches. Implementation is not trivial, either. Also having stereo sound from your music player will reduce your cancellation success.\nSOURCE : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4875818/software-sound-cancelling-destructive-interference-tools-on-linux\n", "Q: How can I hide or show a different IP to a website?

I do have two connectors listed in the sound settings but regardless of which one is selected it always plays through the speakers.\nI think this might have something to do with the fact that my speakers are plugging into the front of my computer, typically the headphone jack, and my headphones are plugging into the back but when I try disconnecting the speakers from the front there is still no sound from the headphones.\nI fixed the speaker sound by going through the sound settings and making sure they were all set to 100% then rebooting.\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Maxing everything and unmuting everything in alsamixer\n\n*Uninstalling PulseAudio\n\n*Making GStreamer use the only ALSA via GStreamer-properties.

I need someone to explain me.\n\nA: In order to connect via SSH from A to B you'll need a SSH server running in B. To connect to an Ubuntu machine, it's just a matter of installing openssh-server and make sure the service is started. For a Windows machine, you'll have to pick one of the third-party servers available and install it.\nThis question is a good starting point to select a Windows SSH server; Wikipedia also has a comparison of servers. OpenSSH for Windows, mentioned in @FatPopDoWop's answer, has not had a release in years AFAIK (last one in Sourceforge was in 2004). I've used freeSSHd in Win XP and it works well, but I can't say if it does in Win 7.\nThe server (your host) must be able to receive TCP connections in the SSH listening port (22 by default); check the Windows Firewall, as already mentioned.\nThe IP you have to connect to will depend on how the network is set up in the VM. For example, in a VM that's using NAT network mode, the host is reachable from the guest with the IP 10.0.2.2. In any case, check that SSH is listening on the interface the client will use to connect. In NAT mode, the connections are made through localhost (at least in Linux; I suppose VirtualBox in Windows works that way too).\n\nA: There are a couple of answers around already. Take a look at these:\nhttp://www.howtoforge.com/forums/showthread.php?t=55004\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/424083/virtualbox-host-ssh-to-guest\nhttp://wiredrevolution.com/virtualbox/setup-ssh-access-between-virtualbox-host-and-guest-vms\n\nA: To connect to a Windows computer via ssh you need to install OpenSSH for Windows first. Once it's installed, you need to set up the config file so that your chosen Windows user(s) can log in via ssh. You will probably also need to add an exception to the Windows Firewall to allow port 22 incoming.\nFind instructions and downloads here: http://sshwindows.sourceforge.net/\n", "Q: Problems creating a desktop entry for a shell script I did the following procedures to create a application launcher but it doesn't work. \n\n\n*\n\n*create shell script named shell.sh with the following content:\njava -jar foo.jar\n\n\n*Added execution permission: sudo chmod +x shell.sh\n\n*Created .desktop file in /usr/share/applications/ with the content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=foo\nTerminal=false\nExec=/path/shell.sh\nType=Application\nIcon=/path/icon.png\nCategories=Utility;\n\nThen I have an application with icon, but it couldn't run, while double click shell.sh works.

When I swipe really quickly, it can easily span the whole display, but I'd like to increase the general sensitivity. \n\nA: What you describe kind of makes sense, in other words, when moving slowly, the pointer also respods slowly, and when swiping quickly, the pointer gets accelerated. Obviously, if the intention is to move across the screen, you'd swipe quickly rather then slowly.\nThat said, if you wish to increase the pointer speed, bump up the MinSpeed and AccelFactor parameters.\nFor example: synclient MinSpeed=1.2 AccelFactor=0.05\n\nA: I don't know for command line for a fact, but from your list I'd increase\nAccelFactor a lot, and possibly MinSpeed and MaxSpeed if that didn't solve it.\nIf you have ubuntu, then System > Preferences > Mouse gives graphical editor for acceleration and sensitivity, or alternatively: https://live.gnome.org/GPointingDeviceSettings\nhope this helps.\n", "Q: How can I parse a YouTube URL?

ATAPI devices are not supported.\"\nHowever, I have already installed Windows 7 using this drive and I can run the Ubuntu 12.04 installer from it as well. The only time I have a problem is during Ubuntu boot when it tries an IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE which seems to be an ATAPI command.\nI can't simply switch this device to another SATA port because they are already allocated to other devices. (My chipset's 2 x 6Gb/s are connected to my boot SSD and a fast HDD while the 4 x 3Gb/s ports are running a RAID 5 array.) If this can't be fixed or worked around, I suppose I'll have to go buy SATA add-in card. Blech.\nThoughts:\nIf indeed this is a device specific issue (that it doesn't support ATAPI discovery) then I can't expect - is it udev? - to work with it. But, it seems that Windows and even the Ubuntu installer work just fine. So why does udev have a problem?\nAt the end of the day, it would be nice to have the DVD working under Ubuntu, but I can live without it. But, as this is a dual-boot machine, I can't physically disconnect it because I want it to work with Windows. (And physically disconnecting it every time I want to boot Ubuntu is NOT an option. ;-)\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should this be considered a bug? My feelings are that if it works with other OS that it should probably work with Ubuntu as well.\n\n*How can I work around this problem? I have a limited knowledge of linux internals, but it seems I should be able to somehow tell udev (or whatever is doing the discovery) to ignore that device. Is there a way?\n\nA: Turns out these are libata messages from the kernel resulting from ATAPI commands being sent to the DVD drive. The problem is, the ASM1061 to which the DVD is attached doesn't support ATAPI. \nThe solution is to edit /lib/udev/rules.d/60-persistent-storage.rules, find the line containing the word \"ATAPI\" and comment out the next line. \nThanks to Olli Helin for his answer to my previous post for this answer! \n\nA: Apparently, ASM106x and optical drives just don't go together.

You need to create a ntfs partition before you run the windows setup and set the boot flag (I recommend to use gparted). If you now select this partition during setup it won't ask you to create the extra partitions. See also this answer on superuser. Repeat this for your other windows installation.\nNow you still have 2 primary partitions available, one of which I would use for an extended partition with ubuntu and swap, because Ubuntu doesn't mind booting from an extended partition. Then you still have one primary partition left to do with whatever you like... \nSo:\npart1: 60 GB  - Windows 7 installed\npart2: 150 GB - Windows 8 installed\npart3: Extended partition with\n    3.1: part5 160 GB -> Ubuntu 12.10\n    3.2: part6 360 GB -> logical for files\n    3.3: part7 8 GB   -> Swap\n\n", "Q: How to Set a Value of Kconfig Option I want to change the value of a specific CONFIG_... parameter (in here: CONFIG_ATH5K_DEBUG) inside Kconfig option.\nI use make menuconfig command, press / and type CONFIG_... to find its location.

But everytime I run make command, there are always errors.

I was looking at stuff like /bin/bash, and I wanted to make my own file like that that's full of aliases, but I need to know the file extension. Please tell me.\n\nA: You shouldn't add stuff in /bin as this directory is handled by the OS. Use a custom directory in your homedir or /opt/monkeyman/bin for example, and use an extension only if you find it useful for some reason. Unix/Linux doesn't require or even make use of a file extension for commands, it only wants an executable to have the executable permission set.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Cloud UEC 12.04 amd64 image has an invalid locale Following the tutorial in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEC/Images#DownloadUECImages I was able to execute the Ubuntu 12.04 Cloud Image (amd64) in my computer (http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/precise/current/precise-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img), so I can add whatever I want before uploading it to my Openstack Cloud.

Equipment: Pre-loaded Windows 8 Laptop, needs multi-boot capability (Win8 + Linux and BSD)\nLots of USB 3.0 sticks and blank DVD-Rs.\nVarious ISO's, including Ubuntu Secure-remix 12.10\nProblem: After burning aforementioned Ubuntu iso to DVD (or USB), the live disc does not boot in EFI mode. Booting into Legacy mode installs for legacy mode. This makes Windows not work without switching back and forth. \nRequirements: A pre-loaded windows 8 machine that can boot a liveDVD in EFI mode, install Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit in EFI mode, and finish with a multi-boot capable machine.\nWhat is done already: ISO's downloaded. Partition shrunk, leaving lots of room to play with, Ubuntu installed in legacy mode. Windows and Ubuntu work but have to switch EFI depending upon which is being used.\nWhat isn't done: Anything with GRUB.\n\nA: It sounds like you've already installed Ubuntu in BIOS mode. If I'm mistaken, you can either do so or try my first suggestion and/or a rEFInd installation to boot the installer in EFI mode to do the installation directly in that way.\nFirst, try disabling Secure Boot and booting the Ubuntu installer in EFI mode. Secure Boot support is brand-new in Ubuntu 12.10, and it may yet be buggy, so eliminating Secure Boot as a possible troublemaker is worth trying.\nIf that works, you can boot the Ubuntu disc into live CD mode and use it to install the EFI boot loader of your choice. Ubuntu 12.10 uses GRUB 2, but several others are available, and you may prefer one of them. You could try something similar with the System Rescue CD, which supports an EFI-mode boot.\nIf you can't seem to get Ubuntu or System Rescue CD booted in this way, try installing my rEFInd boot manager from within Windows. (You'll need to either disable Secure Boot or jump through some extra hoops to get it working, though.) A basic installation with no extra changes will present a menu with Windows and nothing else; but you can enable a boot to Ubuntu in either of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can edit the refind.conf file, uncomment the scanfor line, and add hdbios to the list of options. This will enable scanning for, and booting to, BIOS-based OSes, such as your Ubuntu installation. This option works with many, but not all, UEFI-based PCs.\n\n*You can install the ext4fs driver that comes with rEFInd 0.6.0. This will enable rEFInd to search for Linux kernels and launch them from your regular installation. You'll also need to create a refind_linux.conf file and put it in your Linux /boot directory, though; without it, the kernel will launch but it won't be able to find your root filesystem. You could do a one-time boot by selecting the Linux icon, hitting the Insert key a couple of times to bring up the editor, and adding ro root=/dev/sda3 (or whatever the Linux root partition's identifier is) to the boot options. Once Linux is up, running the mkrlconf.sh script that comes with rEFInd should generate a suitable configuration file to obviate the need for manually entering this option.\n\n\nThe last I heard, none of the BSDs had a working EFI-mode boot loader. If I'm misinformed or if this has changed recently, you should be able to install BSD and select it with rEFInd. If the BSDs are still behind the EFI times, though, you'll need to use either your firmware's selection tool or rEFInd to switch between Windows and BSD; AFAIK, no other boot program can switch BIOS/EFI boot modes on UEFI-based PCs. (rEFIt can do this on Macs, though.)\n\nA: I think that I have the same basic issue, the Ubuntu 12.10 Live DVD doesn't boot into EFI mode so the installer is not installing Ubuntu in EFI mode even if the hard drive is partitioned as a GPT drive. So when the install is finished, no boot loader works because Windows 8 is in EFI mode and Ubuntu isn't.\nIf I select EFI only, in the system setup the DVD drive doesn't boot at all.\nI'm not sure if there is any possible  solution.\nSomeone stated that Secure Boot support is not coming until 13.04, but I thought that it was already in 12.10. Turning on Secure Boot might force the DVD drive to operate in EFI mode. But who knows?\nI tried installing \"rEFInd\" in Windows 8 and got as far as step 10 at http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html#windows but as Rod stated, he hasn't tested that step and the install fails at that step.\nSo the bottom line is to get a second hard drive and install Ubuntu on it and switch between the drives.\nI find that if I set the system setup to EFI only then Windows 8 boots and if I set it to  Legacy only then Ubuntu boots, but Ubuntu can't mount the Windows volume so no file sharing between OSes (stick in a USB stick to do this).\n", "Q: Unity doesnt shows correctly after proprietary nvidia even after linux-headers-generic I just reinstalled ubuntu 12.10 and cant get nvidia proprietary drivers to work properly in the unity dash..

When using sudo to allow edits to files, I regularly get 'permission denied'.\nFor example, my mouse is jittery and sluggish, so I want to disable polling:\nsudo echo \"options drm_kms_helper poll=N\">/etc/modprobe.d/local.conf\n\nI'm prompted for a password, and then get:\nbash: /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf: Permission denied\n\nSo I tried to do a temporary change to disable polling by using:\nsudo echo N> /sys/module/drm_kms_helper/parameters/poll\n\nYet again the system responded with:\nbash: /sys/module/drm_kms_helper/parameters/poll: Permission denied\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The output redirection is done by the shell from which the command has been invoked. So, breaking everything into bits, here what is happening*:\n\n\n*\n\n*shell invokes sudo echo \"options drm_kms_helper poll=N\", which executes sudo command with echo \"options drm_kms_helper poll=N\" command line\n\n*sudo asks for a password, opens superuser shell and invokes echo \"options drm_kms_helper poll=N\", which runs echo command passing it \"options drm_kms_helper poll=N\"\n\n*echo, running with root privileges, prints the string to its standard output.\n\n*echo command terminates, superuser shell exits, sudo terminates\n\n*the shell from which the command has been invoked collects the output and tries to redirect it to /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf, which is writeable only by root. It gets \"permission denied\" error.\nFor the ways to fix this see @shantanu answer.\n\n(*) - while the above sequence helps to understand why the command fails, in reality things happen somewhat out-of-order: the original shell notices the redirection and tries to open the file for writing before invoking the sudo ... command. When opening the file fails the shell doesn't even invoke the command which was supposed to write to the file (thanks to @PanosRontogiannis for pointing this out). \nHere's a quick test:\n$ touch ./onlyroot.txt\n$ sudo chown root:root ./onlyroot.txt\n$ sudo bash -c \"whoami | tee who.txt\" > onlyroot.txt\nbash: onlyroot.txt: Permission denied\n\nIn the test above the whoami | tee who.txt was going to create a file named who.txt containing the word \"root\". However, when the output redirection fails in the calling shell, \"who.txt\" file is also missing because the command was not invoked.\n\nA: You can use a tee command like this:\nsudo tee /sys/module/drm_kms_helper/parameters/poll <<<10\n\nOr if its a command's output:\necho 10 | sudo tee /sys/module/drm_kms_helper/parameters/poll\n\nIf you had a situation where you wanted to append rather than overwrite the target file--that is, to make tee behave like >> rather than >--you would use tee -a.\n\nA: Another option is to use a temporary file. This is useful in a bash script.\ntemp=$(mktemp)\necho \"Hello, world!\" > $temp\nsudo cp $temp /etc/wherever\n\n\nA: sudo dd of=\nTo append as you want:\necho inbytes | sudo dd of=outfile oflag=append conv=notrunc\n\nor to recreate the file from scratch:\necho inbytes | sudo dd of=outfile\n\nAdvantages:\n\n*\n\n*nicer than tee since no /dev/null redirection\n\n*nicer than sh since no explicit subshell (but an implicit one for the redirection)\n\n*dd has many powerful options, e.g. status=progress to see transfer progress: How to show the transfer progress and speed when copying files with cp?\nWorks because sudo forwards stdin to the command.\n\nA: Output redirection (via the > operator) is done by the shell, not by echo. You have to login as root\nsudo -i\n\nThen you can use redirection \necho N> /sys/module/drm_kms_helper/parameters/poll\n\nOtherwise you can run bash string with sudo\nsudo bash -c \"echo N> /sys/module/drm_kms_helper/parameters/poll\"\n\n\nA: An approach I haven't seen mentioned here is to simply execute the entire commandline in its own shell. The sudo manpage itself gives an example of this approach:\n\nTo make a usage listing of the directories in the /home partition. Note that this runs the commands in a sub-shell to make the cd and file redirection work.\n\n$ sudo sh -c \"cd /home ; du -s * | sort -rn > USAGE\"\n\n\nA: Create a one-line script from your command, then execute the script as sudo. For example:\n\n*\n\n*Use an editor to create a file; for example:\nnano my_script.sh\n\n\n\n*In the editor, insert your shebang, and the command:\n#!/bin/bash  \necho \"options drm_kms_helper poll=N\" > /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf  \n\n\n\n*Save the file & exit the editor; e.g. ~/my_script.sh\n\n\n*Make the file executable:\nchmod 755 ~/my_script.sh\n\n\n\n*Run the script under sudo:\nsudo ./my_script.sh\n\n", "Q: Lag spikes on my website I have a heavy traffic site that gets about +200 concurrent users and receives 4k+ uniques daily.

I want 100 giga. I'm sure one of you smart dudes have the answer, because Linux is where the really people are hanging out these days. Yep, I'm new to this. So please help.\n\nA: I dont think its wise to make a 100Gb wubi install that's why they limit you to 30Gb . It can slow down the performance a lot. If you want a 100Gb install why dont you install it on another partition or perhaps shrink the drive and make a new partition and then instlal Ubuntu into it.\n", "Q: Terminal doesn't see Windows filesystem until I open in Home Folder GUI I'm currently dual-booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu.  When I try to access my Windows HD through the terminal I can't find it.  However, I used the Home Folder application to see where those drives/folders were.  And after I clicked into it in the Home Folder, I looked again at the same folder in the terminal and it appeared.  Is there a reason for this and how can I set it so I always can see those folders?\n\nA: Thats because your windows drives are not mounted automatically during boot.When you click open the drive , Ubuntu mounts it for you automatically and hence you can see it through terminal.\nIf you want to open the drives in terminal then you will have to mount it manually using the mount command and then browse it through terminal.\nHere's a tutorial that show you how http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/mounting-windows-partition-onto-ubuntu-linux/\nTo mount the partitions during boot then you should make the required entry to the /etc/fstab file There are also several tutorials available online that gives step by step instruction how to do that\nHere's a detailed tutorial from Ubuntu which shows how to automatically mount partitions https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions\n", "Q: Unable to launch byobu with custom windows.NAME file Apologies if the solution is obvious but I'm stumped! \nI want to launch byobu from within my Gnome 3 desktop environment on 12.04 but it's not working for me as yet.

I'm using a machine that's about 3 years old.  Setup:\n Intel Core i7 2.8GHz\n 8GB Ram\n 1TB SATA HDD\n\nAt this point, I'd like to install 12.10 and Mint 14, leaving the option open to install additional distros down the road.\nI could be way off, but I'm thinking about creating at least 2 primary /boot partitions (1 for 12.10 and 1 for Mint) and another partition for LVM leaving room for additional /boot partitions.  Then creating a VG and separate LVs for Ubuntu 12.10 and Linux Mint 14.  I understand I can share partitions between the 2 installs, but I'm only using this for testing and I have tons of space to play with.  LVM seemed logical considering I may want to install and test additional distros.  I guess I could share the /swap partition across the board without problems, right?\nI'm unclear about GRUB2.  How do I handle the bootloader situation? Install 12.10 and get it running then make changes to grub.cfg after installing Mint?  And do I not install GRUB for Mint or do I install it in a different location?  Any guidance would be appreciated.\n\nA: With grub2 you do not need a separate /boot partition.  You can either have the other distros not install a boot loader, or reinstall the Ubuntu grub2 and when you run sudo update-grub from Ubuntu, it will detect the other installations and add them to the menu.\nNote that the last time I tried this with Mint, its installer did not seem to recognize LVM.\n", "Q: No sound in Ubuntu 12.10 [Or any distro], mb soundcard Integrated motherboard sound card.

When trying to assemble the raid, I am getting that e and f are misses out due to wrong homehost. I tried to search around but I cant find the correct solution to get the RAID 5 going again.\n\nA: As a safety feature the kernel will only allow automatic assembly of arrays it is part of the same host.

What should I do? I have just gotten my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS desktop computer reassembled after a trip back home and connected it to my parent's wireless Internet connection. The connection seems quite shaky (disconnects half the time, likely an ongoing issue with the wireless card I have installed), and it struggled to download updates because of the constant interruptions. Eventually, it managed to download the updated packages and started installing them. I got up and left it to do its work.\nWhen I came back, I saw it was still having trouble staying connected to the wireless (no surprise there), but then I noticed that it seemed like Update Manager had stopped making progress on the installation. I opened the Details pane to see what it was last doing:\n\nMy guess was that the installation script for flashplugin-installer couldn't complete the download until I stabilized the Internet connection. I hooked my Ubuntu laptop up to my desktop via Ethernet and shared its wireless connection using this guide, and as I am typing this now from my desktop you can see that the connection issue was successfully worked around.\nHowever, even with a stable connection established, Update Manager seems \"stuck\" at its current position and won't go any further. It's not totally frozen, but I can't do anything beyond open/close the Details pane as the Cancel button is grayed out.\nI know it can cause big problems if updates are stopped during installation, but I'm at a loss as to how this situation should be handled. I'm sure it should finish normally if I can just find a way to restart Update Manager, but the question is how this should be approached. How can I safely get my updates to finish installing?\n\nA: Here's what I did.\nFirst I found the stuck process (number 19123 in my case):\n> pstree -p\n├─gksu(7266)─┬─precise(9756)\n│            ├─precise(9757)─┬dpkg(24158)─update-notifier(19121)─package-data-do(19123)\n│            │               └{precise}(9759)\n\nThen I helped out with bug report:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/flashplugin-nonfree/+bug/1243090 .\nBy running \"sudo gdb\" then \"attach 19123\" and \"bt\" to create a backtrace.  The backtrace helps the volunteers determine what's wrong.\nFinally I used \"sudo kill 19123\" and received error message \"Could not install 'update-notifier-common'\" \"subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 143\". \nThe rest of the install then completed without incident.\n\nA: Ideally you should skip configuring flashplugin-installer and reconfigure it when you have a stable connection.\nYou can kill the download processs to proceed without configuring the package, mostly it is wget, or sometimes curl, but here it seems that it downloads via debconf.\nTo abort the transaction, you can kill dpkg,\nsudo killall dpkg\n\nThen remove the lock,\nsudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock\nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock\n\nThen when you have a stable connection, execute,\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\n\nA: I recommend updating flash manually from the adobe website.You can un-check flash update option and try updating it again.\nYou can restart the update by doing the following:\nopen up terminal and run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade .It will download the necessary packages and continue your update.\nsudo apt-get -f install should fix if there are any broken packages.\n\nA: I've just had a similar freeze during upgrade. In my case it was dropbox-nautilus that it froze on, not flash, but the solution might be similar in both cases. In a terminal I did a ps -a to find out which processes were running, and found that dropbox-nautilus was in the list. Its process ID was 325, so I did sudo kill 325. That killed the dropbox-nautilus process, and the upgrade resumed. There was a popup error message stating that dropbox-nautilus had not been configured correctly and might be unusable after the upgrade, but I can worry about that later. At least the upgrade is proceeding now.\n", "Q: Migrating to full Ubuntu after dual installation on WinXP I previously ran 12.04 alongside WinXP to see how it performed on my mom's older laptop.  i also migrated her email to Thunderbird. If I now convert from dual WinXP/Ubuntu to only run Ubuntu will things like her Thunderbird emails be transferred as part of the Ubuntu full install? Or must I do something else? I am fairly tech aware, but not a full IT boffin!\n\nA: You don't have to do a fresh install if you already have a working Ubuntu. I'm assuming you did not use WUBI. In that case I would go for a backup of everything, including Thunderbird mails, and a fresh Ubuntu install. You can migrate a Wubi install for a full install if you are willing to go through this procedure.\nIf on the other hand you have Ubuntu installed alongside Windows in a separate partition with Grub as bootloader then you can simply delete Windows CAREFULLY.\nTo delete Windows I would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup all data on the Windows partition.\n\n*While logged in your Ubuntu install you could format your Windows partition or delete it if you want to (later) increase the size of your Ubuntu partition. How to do this depends on your current partition table. Type sudo fdisk -l and add it to your question for more specific help.\n\n*IMPORTANT: DO NOT REBOOT BEFORE THIS STEP! In a terminal type: sudo update-grub\nNow you can reboot your PC, Windows is no longer there. If you decided to simply format your Windows partition you're done.\nIf you decided to increase the size of your Ubuntu partition with the space left over by the Windows removal you will need to boot from a liveDVD or liveUSB to do the necessary changes. What is needed depends on your current partition table. Again, you might need to repair Grub after doing these changes.\n\nA: You should probably back up the data from Ubuntu 12.04 and the data from W$ XP. A new installation will wipe your disk clean (or at least the partition you install it on). \nIf you have your home directory on a separate partition, that is a different thing. In that case you can leave it untouched.\n", "Q: team viewer 8 beta wont run I installed teamviewer 7 and then one of my friend using windows got version 8 so I installed the beta of version 8 for Linux.

My Windows 7 install recently broke, and instead of reinstalling I decided I might as well upgrade it to Windows 8. To save money, I got the cheaper downloadable version of the Windows 8 installer and chose to put it on a usb. Unfortunately, when I tried to upgrade Windows 8 by booting directly from the usb, it told me that I need to boot into Windows 7 first and then mount the usb to upgrade, which I can't do because my Windows 7 isn't working. I could do a fresh install, but I'm trying to avoid that so I can keep my applications. \nI've been using an Ubuntu live usb while I've been figuring out what to do about all this, and I'm not sure if I can run the Windows 8 installer somehow through Ubuntu and upgrade my Windows 7 install without having to be booted into it first. Any thoughts?\n\nA: The short answer is: No, you can't do this.\n\nA: The Windows installer (whether it be for Windows 8, Windows 7, or any other version) has the following properties that make it unlikely that it could run in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is a Windows program, or, more accurately, a collection of Windows programs. (You can run some Windows programs on Ubuntu with Wine, but see below...).\n\n*It uses Windows device drivers, and it cannot succeed without them. In almost all cases, Windows device drivers cannot be run on Ubuntu. Wine does not facilitate running Windows device drivers.\n\n*It is written for a special build of Windows called the Windows Preinstallation Environment (sometimes written WinPE), which runs from a live CD/DVD or live USB flash drive. The installer is intended to run in exactly this way. Please note that this is a Windows live environment, which is different from an Ubuntu (or any other GNU/Linux) live environment. Even getting the Windows installer to run from an ordinary Windows system, or from a Windows live CD/DVD that is not based on the Windows Preinstallation Environment, would probably require substantial effort. Getting it to run on Ubuntu would require enormous effort (and luck).\n\n\nTheoretically, if you have enough RAM, you could set up a virtual machine (for example, in VirtualBox or VMware Workstation) that uses your physical hard drive as its virtual hard drive. (Those virtualization solutions, and some others, support this.) You could use the virtual machine to run the Windows 8 installer. The problem with this is that the virtual machine would probably have markedly different hardware than your real machine.\nWith Ubuntu, you can take a system drive from one machine to another and usually it works with minimal hassle (unless you're taking a 64-bit installation over to a 32-bit machine).\nBut with Windows, that does not tend to work out of the box. If you did that, you likely would be unable to boot from your new system. You would probably have to do quite a bit of troubleshooting to get this to work.\nI'm not saying it necessarily can't be done. But if your goal is to keep your programs, it's definitely more efficient to just reinstall them after performing a clean install of Windows 8. If you have installation media for whatever proprietary payware applications you have, it's definitely easier. And even if you don't, it's probably much easier to find them. If the applications you want to retain were present on your Windows 7 system when that system was installed, they may be on the custom Windows 7 installation disc that shipped with your computer. If your computer shipped with the applications installed on Windows 7 but with no installation disc, you may be able to restore the original state of the system (consult your manufacturer's documentation), or you may be able to order a DVD from your manufacturer at minimal expense, which would facilitate this action.\nPlease note that if you have documents and other important files (e.g., videos, ebooks, music) in your Windows 7 system, your Ubuntu live USB system can recover those. If you have trouble doing that, please feel free to post a new question about it!\nIf you want detailed information about how to install Windows 8 (using any of the techniques mentioned above, or any other way), that would be off-topic for Ask Ubuntu. I've tried to keep this answer essentially about Ubuntu. One good place to post questions about installing and using Windows is Super User.\n", "Q: How to prevent so many instances of apt-check running? I have an Ubuntu 12.04 server that just crashed because of a very obvious cause: 30+ of apt-check processes consuming all memory, the OOM killer kicking in, killing vital services. I'm not sure where the apt-check processes come from, but I guess my Nagios/Icinga plugins check_apt might use it, as well as the byobu status line may want to display its output. I guess something locked up and all of the processes were just waiting, yet holding memory.\nHow can I prevent to have so many instances of apt-check on the system? It doesn't make sense to me and it should just quit as soon as it can't get a read lock on the dpkg database.\nIt seems that I'm not the only one running into trouble here. All suggestions for apt-check are pretty negative:\n\n(clean browser, not logged in, no personalised search)\n\nA: Some dive into apt-check gave me these clues for being it a very blunt script that needs fixing. With all due respect to the authors of it, it is failing on my servers. Here are my thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-check == /usr/lib/update-notifier/apt_check.py\n\n*forces nicelevel 19 for itself\n\n*no timeouts set on actions\n\n\nThe combination of the last two allows it to pile up endlessly in a spiral downwards. If the system is used for some other purposes with higher priority, the amount of processes will just increase and there's no end to it, as apt-check will never get any priority over it. Trouble will only get worse once the OOM killer decides to kill your vital system processes.\nIf either of these two aspects in behaviour was different, it would not allow the system to end up in such a broken state is my assumption.\nWhile strings is right about the parent processes being responsible in this too, I believe below points are flaws in apt-check and has to be reported as a bug to get addressed properly:\n\n\n*\n\n*it should hint the OOM killer to have itself killed first\n\n*it should not set the nicelevel hardcoded\n\n*it should exit if it takes an unreasonable amount of time to get pieces of information\n\n\nActually, it seems that the Linux OOM killer is doing some heuristic on this. Niced processes will get an increased score, and long-running processes are decreased. (source - thanks to Ulrich Dangel for pointing it out)\nPossible solution I may propose:\n\n\n*\n\n*cache results after processing\n\n*output cache if less than N amount of seconds without loading all Python-APT libraries for every simple (even --help) invocation.\n\n*make the nicelevel configurable - Allow me to change/disable this, please! I believe that setting it to 0 will actually help\n\n*have it increase the OOM killer score\n\n\nA: You need to find out what process is spawning apt-check. you can use something like ps to get the process tree.\nps -A --forest\n\nIf apt-check has no parents, then it might be a issue with apt-check its self and not one particular program. if that is the case I would try to debug apt-check.\n\nA: Written base on Ubuntu 12.04\nI have the same problem and found out that's because of byobu, if I just run apt-get update not using byobu, there will be no check-apt process. Also, it relates to update-notifier package, when I removed those packages (update-notifer-common, update-notifier), using byobu and run apt-get update, it ran another command but quite the same memory using: apt-get -s -o Debug::NoLocking=true upgrade.\nSome other things may run apt-get update (but probably do not run check-apt)\n\n\n*\n\n*passing argument to  check_apt to update/upgrade pkg.\n\n*if configured, /etc/cron.daily/apt may update the package list, too\n(see https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/automatic-updates.html),\nbut it just run once a day, and should not be problem.\n\n\nOn a desktop, there are more things may involved.\nConclude:\nbyobu catches the event when you run apt-get update and trigger these check-apt processes, re-config the status bar of byobu to fix this.\n", "Q: What causes “pam_unix … conversation failed” in auth.log There are thousands of entries in my auth.log like this:\nsudo: pam_unix(sudo:auth): conversation failed\n\nWhat causes these to occur?

I have successfully done this using DD-WRT (too slow) and a virtual instance of PFSense (too limited).\nI'm new to Linux, but I'm 90% complete with this project.  Hardware is 2 wired ethernet ports, one of which is connected to a traditional home router, and a wireless card.\nSo far I have..\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up my wireless to act as a true Master Access point using hostapd\n\n*Created a bridge (I think) between the Wireless and Local LAN\n\n*Set up a DHCP server that is successfully assigning addresses to the bridge - both wireless and wired are getting them.\n\n*Set up OpenVPN so that it successfully creates a tunneled connection upon boot.\n\n\nCurrent behavior routes all traffic from my Ubuntu machine to the VPN server.  The other devices do NOT have any connectivity, and that's the issue.\nMy Question/Goal:\nHow do I configure the routing so that OpenVPN only directs traffic from my bridge (devices under 192.168.10.x) through the VPN tunnel and NOT traffic from the actual Ubuntu computer?\nOpenVPN sets up some routes automatically, but it seems to ignore the bridge I set up.\nI have read a lot of documentation on iptables and route but it makes very little sense to me.  Despite multiple tutorials, I still don't understand how to read the results from the route command.  I also suspect this can be accomplished with route-noexec and route-up in the OpenVPN configuration file, but nothing has been successful.\nMy knowledge of where configuration files and settings are is limited. The above tasks took me at least 30 hours of tinkering, so please go easy on me :)\nThanks!\nEdit\nI've posted a solution below that directs the bridge traffic, but it doesn't prevent traffic on the Ubuntu computer from going through the VPN.\n\nA: I'm not sure this is ideal, but it's at least working.  In a perfect world, the traffic on the Ubuntu computer would not route through the VPN - only those devices connected to the Ubuntu computer.  Anyways, here's the solution..\nIn the openvpn.conf file\nscript-security 2\nup \"/path/to/external/script.sh\"\n\nIn the /path/to/external/script.sh file\niptables -A FORWARD -o tun0 -i br0 -s 192.168.10.0/24 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT\niptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\niptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE\n\nIn the above, tun0 is the tunnel created by OpenVPN, br0 is the bridge between my local wireless and local lan, and 192.168.10.0/24 is the subnet/DHCP pool for my local lan.\nI have no idea what that script does but I cobbled it together from a few sites on Internet Connection Sharing.\nI'll leave this answer un-checked in case anyone wants to provide a better one or explain how to prevent traffic on the Ubuntu computer from going through the VPN.\n\nA: Easier to configure the router itself to connect to the VPN server so all devices on your network will go through it.\nYou can do that from the router's software web interface.\nIn order to allow devices connected to your PC to access the internet, you have to make internet sharing from that PC to others.\n", "Q: Brightness keyboard buttons do not work on Asus 1225c I have problem with my new netbook.

Now you can actually export annotations to PDFs in Okular (this was not possible until recently): http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdegraphics/okular/annotations.html\nIt seems Okular has to be built with Poppler at least version 0.20. It works with Ubuntu 13.04.\nUpdate:\nThe version of Okular (0.19.3) found in at least Ubuntu 14.04 now also supports customising the review toolbar (the toolbar for adding annotations) by adding and modifying the various annotation types that can be selected.\n\nA: Xournal  would be worth taking a look at. Annotations and modifications are stored in a separate file but can be easily exported to PDF. \nI don't think there's any PDF editor out there that supports any kind of sophisticated math notation, but I might be mistaken.\n\nA: PDF-X-Change Viewer is fairly good. You have to run it under Wine, though.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can read up on it here: Finally, real PDF annotating under Linux! (with help from Wine)\n\n*Or you could look at pdfedit .\n\nA: Try qpdfview . It is fast, customizable and has rudimentary annotation support.\nA recent version can be installed by adding this launchpad ppa.\n\nA: I suggest you try these two programs and choose the one that better fits your needs.\nXournal\nsudo apt-get install xournal\n\nAll annotations are hand made (so to speak).

Very useful to keep track of your research notes.\n\n\nA: Evince 3.6.1 (the default PDF viewer) now supports adding annotations and bookmarks (proper PDF bookmarks), that are saved with the document.\nSince Evince 3.14 you can add and delete annotations.\n\n\nUPDATE Evince 3.14: Annotations can be added and deleted.\n\nUPDATE 2020: Key S adds a text note and Ctrl + H highlights selected text. (both still require a mouse click to start writing on the annotation). Thanks @Gogowitsch\n\nA: There is yet another alternative. You can install Adobe Reader.

It also copies out highlighted text. For math, it has the very handy feature that you can drag a \"highlight box\" around content, with the content then shown in the list of notes.\nNote that Polar stores notes etc. in a database, currently with no options to share them, and not embed option.\n\nA: For anyone who found this question, my suggestion is to use:\nFoxit PDF Reader\ninstallation link: https://www.linuxbabe.com/desktop-linux/install-foxit-pdf-reader-ubuntu\nIn my opinion it is a more powerful PDF reader than any mentioned in this post. Its advantages include, but are not limited to:\n\n*\n\n*user friendly interface\n\n*easy customization\n\n*comparable features/functions to Adobe Acrobat Reader\n\nAnd the most important is that it is available cross systems: Windows, Mac and Linux.\nTry it out, I believe you will find amazing!\n", "Q: Error while installing GNU Octave packages I want to install the GNU Octave optim package, but I keep receiving errors in the process.

When I was at the office, I connected my laptop with a projector. Although it can detect the projector, it incorrectly set the projector portrait. Also, if I click the Rotation dropdown, it had no Normal option. It only offered Anticlockwise and Clockwise options. Ofcourse the projector would display my desktop 90 degrees clockwise/anticlockwise.\nI've just tested my laptop again with an LCD monitor, and it happened again. Below is my screenshot of my display settings dialog.\n\nMy display adapter is Intel GMA 950. \nHow to fix this problem?\n\nA: Found the answer myself.\nFrom this question, I tried\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1366x768 --rotate normal\n\nThis command can force the display to rotate the screen back to normal. However everytime I use that command, my laptop became very sluggish and practically unusable. From System Monitor, it appeared that compiz ate all of the available CPU power.\nThen I tried two live CDs, Kubuntu 12.10 and Linux Mint Nadia (Cinnamon edition). The problem exists in Nadia and doesn't in Kubuntu. As Nadia Cinnamon uses compiz while Kubuntu does not compiz, it is another hint that compiz was the cause of the problem.\nSo, I installed gnome-session-fallback and log in again using Gnome Classic (with No effect) and the problem dissapeared.\n", "Q: Date and time format How to echo date and time like this [day-month-year/hour-minutes-seconds] including \"[\" and \"/\".

If your version is 2:1.13.0-0ubuntu6.1 (with updates), maybe downgrading to 2:1.13.0-0ubuntu6 (main release) will do the trick?

The executable requires access to a local binary, \"octane.dat\", in order to run. \nI placed the directory containing the executable and the binary in /opt/ as root and created a symbolic link of the executable in /usr/local/bin/.  Now, if I type \"octane\" anywhere, it launches but throws up an error saying it won't run without the binary, \"octane.dat\".  Octane will only launch if my current working directory is the same as the executable and binary, in /usr/local/bin.\nAny suggestions on how to fix this?  Do I have to make that directory global using .bashrc?\nThanks.\n\nA: Instead of the symbolic link you can create a wrapper script in /usr/local/bin:\n#! /bin/sh\ncd /opt/octane\nexec ./octane \"$@\"\n\nMake the script executable with chmod +x /usr/local/bin/octane.\nThe \"$@\" are the command line arguments, so you can still run octane an_argument. \nThe script changes the CWD (current working directory) only inside the script, because the script is run in a whole new shell instance which ends at the end of the script. Changing the current working directory for the executable might actually be a problem if you want to give a relative pathname to the executable. E.g. if you are in your home directory and run octane a_file_in_the_home_directory, it doesn't work, because the octane executable is called with a CWD of /opt/octane, and a_file_in_the_home_directory is not in /opt/octane. If that is a concern, you can either remember to give absolute pathnames only (octane ~/a_file_in_the_home_directory) or use a more complicated version of the script.\n", "Q: Lost sudo privileges Last night I was working on installing vsftpd on my Ubuntu 12.10 server.

So the workaround is to install first your app(topdrawer), better if its .deb file. It will not run after installation.

Its a known bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dbus/+bug/1102507\nUsing service network-manager restart works through\n\nA: If you can restart the network using the applet of NetworkManager, you do not need to restart NetworkManager itself (at least, most of the time). \nIn that case to restart all the connections, use this code from a shell or in a script: \nnmcli nm enable false\nsleep 5\nnmcli nm enable true \n\nDetails can be found in the NetworkManagar command-line interface manual page. \nNotice that these commands acts as the applet, so they do not need any additional privilege (no sudo or whatever).\n\nA: You could try\nifconfig eth0 down && ifconfig eth0 up\n\n(or whatever your network interface is called) to restart the network.\n\nA: In ubuntu 14.04 they have a new \"feature\" that makes it impossible to restart.\nForce the interface down and up works.\n  sudo ip link set eth0 down\n  sudo ip link set eth0 up\n\n\nA: I do not really think there's GUI method - by default at least.\nI'm also not sure what do You mean by 'restarting networking service', but I feel that the following could help.\nBefore Ubuntu 16.04\nsudo killall NetworkManager \n\nIt kills NetworkManger which automatically restarts after this.\nIt doesn't break the system.\nUbuntu 16.04\nsudo killall NetworkManager && sudo NetworkManager\n\nBased on my personal experience, it seems that in Ubuntu 16.04 NetworkManager does not always restart by itself and it's better to start it manually.\n\nA: For Desktops\nTry\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nOr on recent Ubuntu versions:\nsudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd\n\ninstead.\nUbuntu uses network-manager instead of the traditional Linux networking model. so you should restart the network-manager service instead of the network service. Or use ifup/down.\nFor Servers\nCheck this answer.\n\nA: ubuntu CLI: to restart the network service either\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart \nor\nifdown eth0\nifup eth0\n\n\nA: if ubuntu 14.04 Desktop or Server, you can restart you network by:\nsudo -i\n( ifdown $(ifquery --list -X lo|xargs echo) && ifup $(ifquery --list -X lo|xargs echo) )&\n\n\nA: For ubuntu server 18.04, this works :  \nsudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd\n\n\nA: These days the most direct way to restart network services is to use systemd controls, namely the commandline systemd control utility systemctl. This command will restart the NetworkManager:\nsudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service\n\nMore information can be found here.\n\nA: For Servers\nRestarting networking on a desktop machine will cause dbus and a bunch of service to stop and never be started again, usually leading to the whole system being unusable. \nAs Ubuntu does event based network bring up, there quite simply isn't a way to undo it all and redo it all, so a restart just isn't plain possible. The recommended way instead is to use ifdown and ifup on the interfaces you actually want to reconfigure: \nsudo ifdown --exclude=lo -a && sudo ifup --exclude=lo -a\n\n\nA: rmano's answer is brilliant. Solves so many issues. \nRemark to improve: \nIn U15 I experience a different syntax for nmcli: \nFor analysis do:\nnmcli networking connectivity\n\nTo stop service do: \nnmcli networking off\n\nand to restart do:  \nnmcli networking on\n\nNo sudo required. Thanks rmano!\n\nA: This uses Ubuntu's network-manager to disable, then enable eth0:\nnmcli nm enable false eth0 && nmcli nm enable true eth0\n\nIf your connection has a different name, use it. You can learn your connections name by using the command:\nnmcli c status\n\n\nA: An alternative approach for the server (as of Ubuntu 18.04):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ifupdown2 package :\napt install ifupdown2\n\n*Use service networking restart command\n\nA: I am able to restart the network service on ubuntu with command.\n sudo systemctl restart network-manager\n\n", "Q: how can install plugins for play mp3 and wma file which play on browser I am new user of ubuntu and i am facing an problem when i use web page and play any online mp3 voice file while my voice file not play i show an error \" plug in missing \", ...

After playing around (as in forgot to install chromium-addon for integration and losing half a day to find that out) with unity-webapps I finally got them to work.\nProblem is, if I access a web app from the starter panel, they show the standard Chromium tab bar:. I cannot open a new tab and if I close the tab the whole window will close (fine so far).\nSo I was wondering if there is a way of removing the tabbar from Webapps or configure them so that they will open in firefox (where I could hide the tabbar in options). I however don't want to use firefox as my standard browser.\nAny tips?\nCheers in advance!\n\nA: If you create the Webapp from within Chromium, you'll effectively have what you want.\nGo to Menu/Wrench>Tools>Create Web apps and shortcuts In Chromium/Chrome.

I´ve had some problems with my Ubuntu instalation. \n  I considered reinstalling the OS completely, but the downloads for Ubuntu 12.04 I find online say they are desktop downloads. Can I use one of these downloads for my notebook, or is there a different download I should be looking for?\n\nA: it is as web-e said:\nthere is an ubuntu-desktop dvd just to differentiate from the ubuntu-server dvd\nI run ubuntu-desktop on my netbook just fine\n\nA: Ubuntu-desktop runs on netbooks and laptops. If you are concerned about the performance of your laptop running the desktop version of Ubuntu you should try Lubuntu which is a lightweight distro based on Ubuntu but using the LXDE desktop environment. Lubuntu 12.10 is the latest version.\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.10 usb startup brought settings from the last computer I used a usb to put 12.10 on a dell laptop. Everything is working fine.

I think that it has graphics settings it picked up from the laptop installation. What should I do?\n\nA: A persistent live usb will retain settings from your install. If you are not sure how to change the settings to what you need, the simplest thing would be to remake the usb, being sure to reformat the drive at the same time.\n", "Q: black screen on booting into Ubuntoon Windows 7 PC - Nvidia card \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? \n\nI installed Ubuntu 10.04 desktop AMD 64 on a PC running Windows 7 and the dual booting worked just fine, but \"something\" happened.  Now, When choosing Ubuntu at start-up, only a blank screen appears.  Since the graphics card is Nvidia  (GPU processor: GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 Driver version: 186.55), I hoped the following steps from another post would help:\nIf your graphics card is Nvidia, follow these steps:\n    In the GRUB menu at startup, press \"e\"; then\n    Use the arrow keys to replace quiet splash with no splash or nomodeset.\n    Then press the CTRL+X key combination to boot.\nThere is no \"quiet splash\" text to edit.  I tried adding \"no splash\" as the final line, but upon \"CTRL-X\", the system booted into Windows, which is the default.\n\nA: \"Nomodeset\" is the one I've had most luck with. \nTry again with \"nomodeset\" and not \"no splash\".

I use \"Pidgin\" on Ubuntu instead of Yahoo Messenger, and i recently noticed that when i am offline and somebody writes me, \"Pidgin\" won't show it to me as offline messages, or when i write to my friend by \"Pidgin\" while my friend is offline, he won't get my offline messages either, and i didn't see an option to see conversation history. how can i fix these 3 problems?\n\nA: All the messenger logs will be stored under .purple directory located in your home directory.\ncd ~/.purple/logs/yahoo/\n\nthis is the location where all your yahoo messenger chat logs will be stored.\nYou can also view the logs by selecting \"Conversation -> View Log\" when you have the contact window opened.\nTo send a message to a offline contact, use \"Offline Message Emulation\". Open \"Tool->Plugins\" and make sure you have selected \"Offline Message Emulation\". This will save the message you sent to a offline contact and the message will be delivered once he is online.\nIf you are offline and a contact sends you a message that will be delivered to you when you come online.\nThere are other good plugins for pidgin. To install the extra plugins use the command \n sudo apt-get install pidgin-plugin-pack\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: If you enable the \"History\" plugin, recent conversations will be shown in message windows.

I've done some research and found that there are other people with alike problems, but I couldn't find a solution. Is there anything I can do, any upcoming patch to solve this or any alternative to Compiz?\nThanks!\n\nA: Asus K52J has NVIDIA graphics and they sometimes have trouble in linux. Ubuntu 12.10 no longer comes with Unity 2D and instead relies on LLVMpipe, which is an OpenGL rasterizer that uses your CPU to render the Unity interface. This would explain the high CPU usage.\nTry installing x-swat drivers to fix the problem. \nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\n\nA: I have the exact same laptop model and my cpu usage normally is about 2 - 4% usage, while running compiz. If its using that much of the cpu then yes it most definitely is using the cpu to render the compiz graphics. Sounds to me like the intel graphics aren't loading properly. If you changed some settings in your bios, try resetting them; this same thing happened to me a while ago and that is how I solved it. Other than that the laptop runs ubuntu 12.10 perfectly. Any alternative to compiz would stop any hopes of you running unity; since unity is a compiz plugin. If you do not care about that, try cinnamon, gnome-shell, kde, lxde, elementary OS pantheon, xfce, or you could try dockbarx; which supports the unity quicklists and functions very similarly to the unity dock. Try installing that x-swat drivers from the ppa or the more unstable ones.\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: How can I see which video card on my Optimus-enabled machine is being used? I'm Using Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS on my Optimus-enabled Asus K55v notebook. This means it features two video cards; an integrated Intel one (1GB shared memory), and a discrete Nvidia Geforce 610M. Regarding this, I have a few related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I tell if my system is using the graphic card at all, and if so, how much?\n\n*How do I determine whether the drivers of the Intel graphics are installed or not?\n\n*I tried downloading the drivers from Nvidia's official website, but it did not install. From where do I get the drivers for Nvidia?\n\n*How can I make the best use of the Nvidia graphics card (i.e. in what applications)?\n\n\nA: The command glxinfo displays which video adapter is used for OpenGL graphics. Look for a line similar to the following:\nOpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel(R) Ivybridge Mobile\n\nThe above is displayed on my laptop even though it has Nvidia Optimus discrete GPU. This means that it is still using the integrated Intel GPU for 3D graphics.\nAfter setting up bumblebee I run optirun glxinfo and can see that the system now uses the Nvidia GPU, but only when running commands with optirun:\nOpenGL renderer string: GeForce GT 540M/PCIe/SSE2\n\nIn the end I found out that the Nvidia GPU performs actually worse through bumblebee than with the integraded Intel GPU enabled with DRI_PRIME=1 setting. I will try again when/if there is a better solution in future.\n\nA: You should use your package manager to install the Nvidia drivers because when an update comes down the pipe it makes it easier to upgrade the kernel and still keep your nvidia driver, or even get nvidia driver updates automatically.\nIf you have the other nvidia driver installed you will need to manually uninstall it.  At least in my experience that is the most successful method.  Those details are outlined in the read me file that came with the driver.\nIf you want to use the tested drivers that work well under Ubuntu then run this command\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\n\nThat should do it.  If it is working successfully you should have an Nvidia control panel you can locate that in the dash.\nIt should give you your nvidia system temperature and other facts about your card.\nhope this helps.\n\nA: One command is \nlspci \n\nwhich produces, beneath other things, for example on my system: \n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/PM/GMS, 943/940GML and 945GT Express Memory Controller Hub (rev 03)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)\n00:02.1 Display controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS/GME, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)\n\na similar tool is lshw (list hardware):\nsudo lshw -class display\n\nIn Xfce, there is an entry in the settings menu, 'additional driver', where you can look, if a driver like the Nvidia driver is installed and active, and where you can search for such a driver.

Of course it will not tell you, if there were different scripts you missed. \nSo if you see one source mentioned, read that script to look, whether one script sources another one, and include these too. \n/etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_login come to mind, as well as things from /etc/default.\n\nA: It all depends on with which user you're trying to log in. The global /etc/profile file is loaded for every user, while the ~/.profile is only loaded for the user.\n~ points to the current user's home directory. So, if you would put it in /home/user-a/.profile and login as user-a, both global and its user-specific file are loaded (in that order), whereas if you would login as user-b without a .profile file, it only loads the global one.\n\nA: Both should be loaded, and ~/.profile should be loaded last (meaning it has priority).\n\nA: It's my fault. There was [[ some_test ]] in my ~/.profile and it runs good in bash, but I guess dash runs some pre_session_creation/post_session_creation commands on session start and dash don't know [[ keyword. So everything had been loaded but stopped at the error.\n", "Q: How do I install the nvidia driver for my Nvidia GeForce 6150 LE on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS?

I'm wondering what the normal way to install programs is in windows, specifically ones that will be started from the cmd prompt.\nSo far, I have been adding user environment variables for each program, and appending this variable to the PATH. So, for gvim, I would add\nGVIM_HOME\n\nand then append to my path:\n%PATH%;%GVIM_HOME%\n\nBut now I'm wondering if I should just create a folder and add it to the path, and then put shortcuts to my exe's into that folder. Do any of you know the usual way this is done?\n\nA: It's very interesting to know that you started out with Unix :-) \nGenerally, in Windows directories/folders are not organised with the same idea as they are in Unix/Linux. I normally have a \"System\" partition where I install Windows itself and my applications, and a \"Data\" partition where I keep my own data. In Post-XP Windows, this may be a bit tricky to accomplish but anything you open and close yourself can be stored in Data partition. \nBack to the System partition, the default install location for any programs is \"C:/Program Files\" or something else that the installers will figure out itself. Under \"Program Files\" binaries, documentations and all supporting files are there for the programs to run. But for programs like GVIM, I would suggest you put it under C:/ and use path without spaces. And then you update %PATH. That's how I install Perl and other pure commandline tools which are more popular in Unix world. Or to be more organised you can create a folder like C:/cmdtools and put programs you install manually there. \n\nA: AFAIK there's no \"usual way\" of doing this, mainly because in the (non-server) Windows world, programs are designed to be run via the UI.  But I just checked the %PATH% variable of a nearby Windows box and it has a zillion different paths in it, so that's probably the most common behavior.\nIt's also a good idea because Windows shortcuts don't work quite like *nix soft symlinks.  They're actual files on disk (.lnk), not references to other locations on the filesystem.  You can have a directory full of shortcuts, and you can invoke them from inside cmd.exe (e.g., c:\\>program.lnk will run c:\\foo\\program.exe), but each shortcut has a parameter which tells c:\\foo\\program.exe the directory in which it's to begin its execution.  It's not like $PWD or /proc/[pid]/cwd in *nix.  It's pretty important to not mess up, because it affects things like DLL loading.\n(also, having to call foo.lnk from the CLI instead of just foo seems kind of klunky to me.)\nthis is my experience on XP Pro anyway.  YMMV with newer versions of Windows and command shells.\n", "Q: How to fix Firefox in 12.04 This only happens with Firefox. Everything else runs fine.

I'm now visiting my parents and yesterday I started having an issue with Wi-Fi connectivity for the first time.\nAt first I could connect to their network just fine. Then I started having this issue where I would suddenly be disconnected from the network and the only way to restore connection was to reboot. I found something online about editing the specific network connection and de-selecting the \"Available to all users\" option, which solved that problem temporarily. Later that night I got disconnected from their wireless network again but I haven't been able to reconnect at all since.\nTheir router is old as hell, the best it can do is WEP. Could that have something to do with it? My wife has had limited issues with a couple of her devices as well but nothing this severe and both of our phones are on the Wi-Fi as well as both of my parents laptops so I'd like to rule out my machine before I tell my parents to go drop a hundred bucks on a new router.\nThanks in advance, guys.\n\nA: After a full day of fiddling I finally got myself reconnected to my parents' Wi-Fi so I thought I'd put this here for anyone else in a similar situation.\nMy parents' router is a Liinksys WRT54G. In order to get myself reconnected I deleted the existing connection and created a new one from scratch.\n\n\n*\n\n*I disabled \"Connect automatically\" just for schitzengiggle.\n\n*Listed the SSID (their's includes a space, which I thought might be a small part of the issue, turns out it doesn't matter)\n\n*I specifically left the \"Device MAC address:\" field blank. When you select a wireless network from the dropdown this field gets filled in automatically.\n\n*I left the MTU as automatic.\n\n\nUnder the Wireless Security tab:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Security: WEP 40/128-bit Key (Hex or ASCII)\n\n*Obviously enter the WEP key.\n\n*I left the WEP index as 1.\n\n*Authentication: I changed it to \"Shared Key\". I think maybe this is the particular thing that fixed my issue.\n\n\nIf things change for me I'll be back to update my question and this answer, but hopefully I'm through wrestling with this.

I've downloaded a ubuntu image and I would like to run some tests against that image. How can I test the image on my machine? What tests are available to run and how can I report my results and bugs?\n\nA: Assuming you downloaded a non-release image (that is to say, an image intended for testing), the ISO Tracker contains a list of tests meant to be executed for the image. For example, a daily ubuntu amd64 image has, as of this writing, 21 testcases representing different scenarios for installing and using the ubuntu image on your machine.\nThese tests can be seen, executed and reported all using the ISO Tracker interface. A tutorial on using the tracker can be found here. You will need a launchpad account to login and report results. Each image contains download links for the image, instructions for reporting bugs, and a form to submit results. In general you can utilize your machine, or a virtual machine for testing. Real hardware testing is encouraged, but don't overwrite your current installation and data unless you understand what your doing! Virtual machines such as Virtualbox, Vmware player, or KVM are common for virtualized testing.\nIf you are using a release image of ubuntu and encounter a bug, you are encouraged instead to file the problem as a bug.\n\nA: If you reboot onto the disk and press any key before bootup, to bring up the disk menu, then you should be able to run the self test.\n\nA: In addition to Neojames answer, you can use virtualbox to install it and run your tests on it without having the need for reboot\n", "Q: PHP configured with “magic_quotes_gpc=Off” but phpinfo() shows it as 'On' I've a problem on my Ubuntu Server 12.04 with PHP.\nAs per /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini:\n; http://php.net/magic-quotes-gpc\nmagic_quotes_gpc = Off\n\nBut the phpinfo.php says that Magic quotes are ON...\nAlso\nsebastien@thivinfo:~$ php -l /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini \nNo syntax errors detected in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\n\nHow  \n\nA: Are you sure you are modifying the correct php.ini? phpinfo() shows you were the php.ini is located.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem, and it is a syntax error in php.ini even though running php -l /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini results in No syntax errors detected in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\nI found the error in the following line in the ini file error_reporting = E_ALL& & ~E_DEPRECATED(see the double & &) changing that to error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED resolved the problem.\n\nA: EDIT\nIs this problem still persists ?

I remotely administer a 12.04 LTS desktop and will periodically do\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get upgrade\nHowever, if the upgrade installs something that causes a system issue, I'd like to roll it back to the previous version.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to tell what items will be upgrade, along with the from/to versions?\n\n*Once the upgrade is done, is there a way to restore the previous version (and all its dependencies).\n\n\nFor example, I see on my local machine, that there is a newer version of the flash player. Historically, I've had numerous issues with flash breaking things, so I'm really concerned about blindly updating on this remote system and not being able to back it out.\nThoughts/suggestions?\n\nA: You can display packages that are going to be upgraded and version changes with:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -V upgrade\n\nThe '-V' flag shows you the additional info. As for the snapshots - you really have to roll your own here.\nMy favourite method for having the rollback ability is using LVM with snapshots on Linux - but the last time I checked, there was no progress on the automated rollback to the chosen snapshot. This might have changed since then (I'd be happy for someone to correct me), but you can always boot using root=/dev/vg0/root-snap kernel parameter (for instance) and then use rsync to sync the snapshot /dev/vg0/root-snap to the original volume /dev/vg0/root and then discard the snapshot. Not ideal but can be automated.\nOf course ZFS snapshots rock but there's no official, production-ready ZFS support for Linux (yes, I'm aware of zfsonlinux.org and ZFS-FUSE), so unless you're just playing around, that's not really a feasible option for you.\nUPDATE: it looks that we can now rollback (merge in LVM2 parlance) snapshots. So the update would take the following form with LVM2:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a 5GB snapshot of your root LV:\nlvcreate -s /dev/vg0/root -L5G -n root-snap\n\n*Update the package (as above).\n\n*Roll back if necessary by running:\nlvconvert --merge /dev/vg0/root-snap\nAnd because /dev/vg0/root (the original LV) is opened, lvconvert will notify you that the /dev/vg0/root will be rolled back to /dev/vg0/root-snap upon the next activation of this volume. This happens when you run\nlvchange -ay /dev/vg0/root\n\nwhile this LV is closed, which is upon the next boot or after running:\nlvchange -an /dev/vg0/root\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -s dist-upgrade to see what's going to be installed and updated (dist-upgrade will not do a release upgrade!). The command is a dry run, so that nothing is actually getting installed.\n\n*Make sure there is a system snapshot to restore from. It's not possible to roll/fall/walk/jump/etc back an apt-get command.\nNot updating Adobe Flash is a bad idea, and as Flash doesn't usually break anything other then itself, I'd recommend keeping it uptodate, or else, completely removing it.\n", "Q: How can non-admin users connect to Wi-Fi networks?

I am using 2 screens, and wish to invert the colors on both of them without using compiz (I'm using gnome shell).\nI can use xcalib -invert -alter as suggested in this question, but it only inverts one of the screens. Is there a way to specify both of them, or even which of them, using xcalib? Is there another way?\nWith xcalib, you can specify which screen to alter with the -d (-display) or -s (-screen) options, but alas, X seems to be aware of just one screen: when I use the w command I only see one (the usual \":0\")\nps: this question was originally posted by k0pernikus as a comment here.\n---edit---\nThis is the output of xrandr:\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 3200 x 1200, maximum 8192 x 8192\nVGA-0 connected 1280x1024+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 376mm x 301mm\n1280x1024 60.0*+ 75.0\n1280x960 60.0\n1152x864 75.0\n1024x768 75.1 70.1 60.0\n832x624 74.6\n800x600 72.2 75.0 60.3 56.2\n640x480 72.8 75.0 66.7 60.0\n720x400 70.1\nDVI-0 connected 1920x1200+1280+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 518mm x 324mm\n1920x1200 60.0*+\n1600x1200 60.0\n1280x1024 75.0 60.0\n1280x960 60.0\n1152x864 75.0\n1024x768 75.1 70.1 60.0\n832x624 74.6\n800x600 72.2 75.0 60.3 56.2\n640x480 72.8 75.0 66.7 60.0\n720x400 70.1\n\nI can use -s DVI-0 or -s VGA-0, but they do the same as -s :0\n\nA: No.\n\nNote that as of date of last testing (2014, xcalib version 0.8) xcalib\n  has not been able to invert the colors on all monitors in a\n  multi-monitor setup, because all monitors are presented by the X11\n  server as a single screen. Thus this limitation is coming from the X11\n  server. xrandr-invert-colors does not have this limitation, because it\n  uses XRandR API, which correctly handles all attached monitors.\n\nfrom here: https://github.com/zoltanp/xrandr-invert-colors\n\nA: The display ids in X follow the form :<screen>.<display>. Contrary to intuition, all the monitors in a multiple-monitor setup share a <screen>, but have varying <display>.

What I did\n\n*\n\n*I installed windows 8 normally using a 20GB parition. Windows also created a system reserved partition.\n\n\n*Boot with ubuntu, created two partition. One for SWAP and one for /.\nMost important, choose the GRUB location same as the / partition. See pic below (I think I took wrong screenshot, bootloader location should be sda6 in picture),\n\n\n\n*Now after installation, open up EasyBCD. Goto Add new menu entry, select Linux tab, choose GRUB2 from dropdown and the disk name where we put the GRUb in step 2. Click on Add Entry\n\n\n\n*Goto BCD deployment, and write MBR\n\n\n\n*Now boot and you should get the screen. I restarted several times, every time I got the GUI boot screen. And ubuntu works also.(I forget to change the name step3)\n\n\nA: Even if you use EasyBCD to write the option to boot Ubuntu into the Windows Boot Manager, when you try to press the button for Ubuntu (most people anyway) you will get a \"Windows Failed to Load\" error.  In most cases, the only way you can get into Ubuntu after you install it, is to follow these steps:\nThis assumes that you have Windows 8 installed, and you installed Ubuntu alongside it.  It also assumes you are unable to boot Ubuntu after installation and are booted directly into Windows 8.  IF YOU MADE A BACKUP OF YOUR BOOT SETTINGS WITH EasyBCD (which you should have) BEFORE YOU CHANGED ANYTHING, RESTORE THE BACKUP BEFORE YOU BEGIN.\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the live DVD or live USB, and reboot your computer.\n\n*Select Try Ubuntu without installing from the menu that appears.\n\n*When Ubuntu loads, open the terminal.\n\n*In the terminal type the following commands:\nsudo apt-add-repository yannubuntu/boot-repair  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install boot-repair  \nboot-repair  \n\n\n*Once Boot Repair opens, it may or may not alert you that EFI is detected, select OK.\n\n*Select Recommended Repair.\n\n*You should receive an error that a \"Buggy Kernel is Detected\" and that you should backup and delete the Windows boot files. Select YES.\n\n*Once Boot Repair finishes (it will reinstall and update GRUB) type the following into the Terminal:\nsudo reboot\n\nNow, when you computer reboots, it will probably boot right into GRUB with absolutely no option to boot Windows 8.  You can try two things to fix this.  The easiest way to get back into Windows is to reboot again, and as soon as you see the OEM splash screen (like on my computer, the Gateway splash screen) press whatever key you must press to enter the Boot Menu (mine was F12).  You should see a couple of entries in the Boot Menu.  The top one should be Windows Boot Manager. Select it, and you will be directed to Windows.  Any of the other options should open GRUB and allow you to boot into Ubuntu.  Whenever you want to enter Ubuntu press the key to enter the boot menu while your computer is rebooting, and select the appropriate item from the list depending on what OS you want to use.  Thus, your dual boot is fixed.  Sometimes you have to go into the UEFI or BIOS settings, and enable an option for the boot menu key press, I did, and a lot of newer computers require it.\nAlternatively, there should be an option somewhere in the GRUB menu when it opens called Windows UEFI Manager or Windows EFI Manager, or something to that effect.  Selecting that item from the list should boot Windows without any issues.\nEasyBCD is pretty much useless in a lot of these newer machines, as it can not really handle UEFI and should not be used until it plays a little nicer with the situation.\nThis is the only 100% working way to ensure you can dual boot. Opening the boot menu and launching Ubuntu or Windows from there. I tried for 5 days to get my Ubuntu/Windows 8 dual boot working, and this is the only thing that worked 100%.  \n\nA: For a clean boot of Ubuntu over Windows boot manager on MBR style disks you can chain load either \na) grub boot record or \nb) \"boot.img\" file from grub folder \nusing a so called \"boot sector loader\" in Windows 7 or Windows 8.\nFor detailed steps see Dual-boot Windows 7 and Linux/Unix.\nOn UEFI and GPT disks chain loading Linux from Windows boot manager seems impossible as boot sectors are not used on UEFI. \n\nGoing the other way:\nGrub can chain load Windows 7/8 as well as on MBR/BIOS as on GPT/UEFI. \nHere we have the problem of Windows updates which can write MBR and destroying Grub boot code there or write to NVRAM and changing UEFI boot order.\n", "Q: Launch bar problem Pls see the attached image, seem to me that I press a key combination that put numbers in my launch bar and not allow it to hide.

If you are someone who is having the same issue but with a USB audio device then I recommend the following which fixed it for me:\nsudo rmmod xhci_pci && sudo rmmod xhci_hcd && sudo modprobe xhci_pci xhci_hcd\n\nNone of the other answers would fix it and I assume that came down to the USB device not registering properly on boot. This simply reboots the USB devices. Note: you should only run all commands at once, running sudo rmmod xhci_hcd alone will disable all USB devices e.g., your keyboard, meaning the remaining commands cannot be run.\nI will be honest and say that I doubt that the xchi_pci part is necessary, so if someone is more knowledgeable regarding this please correct me.\n\nA: Have you looked inside the folder to see if pulseaudio was available in init.d, try replacing pulse audio with alsa-utils\n\nA: I had exactly the same symptom: sound suddenly died (after trying to use Audacity, in my case).

Mar 3, 2013\n\n*all date changes were made \"Manually\" using \"Time & Date Settings...\" as seen in the partial window displaying 03/01/2013\n\n*it was possible to change the time/date indicator ap. pull down menu, circled in yellow, to a different date (eventually!!! see below) ... it was changed to Sunday, 10 March 2013\n\n*the top right green circled date is usually not visible and is enabled using \"Time & Date Settings...\" from the \"Clock\" tab (for clarity the calendar display was also turned off)\n\n*note in particular that both green and yellow circled dates in the top right corner are manifestations of the indicator-datetime menubar panel.\n\n\n\nThe simple solution is to ignore the pull down menu date and turn on the menu bar indicator panel option to display date changes instead.\n\nThe utility ntpdate is NOT the problem.  The implementation of the service panel display for the time/date indicator service IS.\nNote that a change of time is relatively immediate, within a minute or so, but a date change takes on another order of magnitude of time complexity to register with the time/date panel pull down menu service ie. it will happen but not for many ten's of minutes.\nThat the date change is effective immediately can be seen with the date terminal command, which DOES correctly show that the effective system time AND date ARE changed. This can be observed irregardless of network connectivity or any NTP daemon.\nThis is easily tested by simply severing ALL network connections (ie. simply dis-Enable Networking) so that any NTP service is ineffective without disturbing the install state of ntpdate.\n(PS. sudo date -s 2013-04-01 is highly effective in any ambient ntpdate state.)\nIf the source of the problem were the ntpd or ntpdate then difficulties would manifest with both the date AND time, not just with one chronometer component.\nObserve closely the discrepancy between the panel pull down menu date annotation with the panel date if displayed.\n:[From Time & Date Settings and the tab Clock select both Show a clock in the menu bar and Date and month and then change the date AND compare to the pull down menu :! ;]\n", "Q: duplicity fails with timeout After one hour of backup with deja-dup, it failed with this exception.\nIs this a network problem on my side ?\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/duplicity\", line 1403, in <module>\n    with_tempdir(main)\n  File \"/usr/bin/duplicity\", line 1396, in with_tempdir\n    fn()\n  File \"/usr/bin/duplicity\", line 1247, in main\n    action = commandline.ProcessCommandLine(sys.argv[1:])\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/commandline.py\", line 1007, in ProcessCommandLine\n    backup, local_pathname = set_backend(args[0], args[1])\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/commandline.py\", line 900, in set_backend\n    globals.backend = backend.get_backend(bend)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/backend.py\", line 158, in get_backend\n    return _backends[pu.scheme](pu)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/backends/u1backend.py\", line 74, in __init__\n    self.create_volume()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/backend.py\", line 323, in iterate\n    return fn(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/duplicity/backends/u1backend.py\", line 161, in create_volume\n    answer = auth.request(self.volume_uri, http_method=\"PUT\")\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ubuntuone-couch/ubuntuone/couch/auth.py\", line 152, in request\n    url, method=http_method, headers=headers, body=request_body)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/httplib2/__init__.py\", line 1444, in request\n    (response, content) = self._request(conn, authority, uri, request_uri, method, body, headers, redirections, cachekey)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/httplib2/__init__.py\", line 1196, in _request\n    (response, content) = self._conn_request(conn, request_uri, method, body, headers)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/httplib2/__init__.py\", line 1132, in _conn_request\n    conn.connect()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/httplib2/__init__.py\", line 889, in connect\n    sock.connect((self.host, self.port))\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/socket.py\", line 224, in meth\n    return getattr(self._sock,name)(*args)\ntimeout: timed out\n\n\nA: Since this is a timeout error from the socket.py Python module, it probably is a network issue.\nHowever, you shouldn't have to look at terminal output to notice errors, Déjà Dup should report them to you in a user-friendly graphical dialog or notification.

But as I don't know how to convince apparmor to allow evince doing mkdir on symlinked targets outside of ~ (which is the reason for the denial), this works well for me.\n\nA: In my case my home directory was a symlink to a network share which was mounted not in /home. This caused Apparmor to deny the creation of the directory. I fixed this by adding my real home directory path to the set of home directory paths in the Apparmor configuration:\necho '@{HOMEDIRS}+=/myrealhomedir/' > /etc/apparmor.d/tunables/home.d/somename\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure apparmor\n\n\nA: I saw the same problem as soon as I changed the way I mounted my samba share. If you use the \"standard\" Nautilus way to access files on a network share, Nautilus will mount the share in\n/run/user/\n\nor\n~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata/\n\nApparmor is set up to accept these directories. But if you mount the share yourself in another directory, it will not work. So we have to add the whole network share to the list of authorized directories.\nThis is well explained here in the Ubuntu help pages . Although user1225999's answer works, the first line is unneeded as the purpose of\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure apparmor\n\nis to allow you to type your share path to add it to the home directory paths. The command will add the path to\n/etc/apparmor.d/tunables/home.d/ubuntu\n\nfile (this file already exists).\n", "Q: Downloads killing internet on my home network I am currently having a problem with my wireless. Whenever I try to download anything it kills the internet for every other application(tabs within the same browser, browsers on other computers on the same network) except the process doing the download. This occurs with everything from downloading updates to iso's. I am not using a torrent. It happens when downloading upgrades, browser downloads, or anything else. This problem does not occur when I use Windows 7 on the same computer and it stops killing the internet for other computers if I turn the download/Ubuntu off.\nI am using an ASUS G74SX laptop running Ubuntu 12.10 with Gnome 3.6. My wireless card is an Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N + WiMAX 6150 (rev 67)\nThanks! \n\nA: I don't know if this may be the cause/issue, but when I was using my brother's network, my laptop used to shut down his internet/network because of it automatically using 'Jumbo Frames'. The solution for me was to manually set my 'MTU' size. This can be easily done in the command line with: \nsudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 1492\n\nwhere you replace eth0 with the adapter, if you are using wireless you probably want to swap eth0 with wlan0.\nOr you can do it in your network manager seen here (change automatic to something like 1492, I believe jumbo frames are 9000):\n\n\nA: Likely cause:\nWireless performance issues on kernel 3.4.0-1-generic (iwlwifi) \nPossible solution:\nCentrino Wireless-N + WiMAX 6150 recognizes Wifi but doesn't connect \nand specifically post #3\nsudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\nsudo modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\n\n\nNote: More diagnostic details needed to confirm as likely cause ..\nTry this command, and report results: (this will eliminate one possible cause)\nlsmod | grep acer\n\n\nA: Unless you have some form of bandwidth allocation manager on your router, that will happen every time. This will happen with every operating system. As long as your wireless card can handle equal to or greater than the amount of bandwidth as your router, your computer will try to snatch it all up.\nIf you're doing an HTTP download, I'd suggest getting the FireFox addon \"DownThemAll\" you're able to manage all of your downloads and allocate amounts of bandwidth to each of your active downloads, much like peer-to-peer sharing software.\nThere are also other things that can cause slow internet speeds such as: VOIP Phones (Vontage, Comcast, etc...), watching videos On Demand (Comcast, or something similar), and having your wireless router on the same channel as a nearby wireless network.\nAnother thing: It doesn't matter how your downloading things from the internet, the limit will always be the same, no matter how it's divided up. Say your bandwidth maxes out at 1mb/s, this could be 333.33kb/s updates, 333.33kb/s downloading ISOs, and 333.33kb/s watching YouTube videos.\n", "Q: I was trying to install \"joomla\" but i got 403 Forbidden error I followed the rules on this link: http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/02/how-to-install-joomla-25x-on-ubuntu.html\nI was doing well until it told me to run \ncd /tmp && wget -O Joomla_2.5.7-Stable.zip http://goo.gl/41TMS\n\nthen it gave me this error:\n--2012-12-20 09:33:48--  http://goo.gl/41TMS\n\nResolving goo.gl (goo.gl)... 173.194.69.139, 173.194.69.100, 173.194.69.101, ...\n\nConnecting to goo.gl (goo.gl)|173.194.69.139|:80... connected.\n\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 403 Forbidden\n\n2012-12-20 09:33:49 ERROR 403: Forbidden.\n\nHow should I fix this?\n\nA: fixed it by downloading the joomla package from it's official site then i extracted it and then i ran this command :\n\ngksudo nautilus\n\nto become root in nautilus file manager, after that i copied everything that was extracted from joomla package, and i pasted it to : /var/www/joomla/ and then i ran this command:\n\nsudo chown -R www-data.www-data /var/www/joomla/\n\nand i went to my browser and i opened :\n\nhttp:// localhost /joomla\n\nand it took me to installation!\nnice and easy\n", "Q: import numpy - no module named multiarray On Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, I installed python 2.7.3, and numpy 1.6.2.\nWhen I try to import numpy, I get this:\nerelsgl@erel-biu:/host/Dropbox/ai/routes$ python\nPython 2.7.3 (default, Nov 25 2012, 17:50:36) \n[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import numpy\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/__init__.py\", line 137, in <module>\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/add_newdocs.py\", line 9, in <module>\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/__init__.py\", line 4, in <module>\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/type_check.py\", line 8, in <module>\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/__init__.py\", line 5, in <module>\nImportError: No module named multiarray\n\nStrangely, this problem does not occur on my other computer, which also runs Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit.\nUPDATE: I removed the manual installation of numpy:\n$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy\n\nThen re-installed using apt:\n$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy\nReading package lists...

Seems to work with any PDF, no matter what the properties of the PDF are or what operating system(s) you're using.\n\nA: I didn't find any native Linux pdf reader capable of annotations.\nMy solution was to install wine1.5 and install Foxit Reader 5 for Windows (not the version they have for linux which is outdated).\nAdd the wine ppa: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nNext type: sudo apt-get update\nFollowed by sudo apt-get install wine1.5\nThen download the Foxit reader for windows installer and run it.\nIf you want to have the Foxit icon instead of the wine icon in the launcher, then see this post.\nWorks like a charm.\n\nA: One can also try Okular. It is available in the Ubuntu Software Centre. One can easily highlight and make notes. The changes made to the pdf document is preserved when viewed in other pdf readers ( I tried to read the modified document in my phone using Adobe Acrobat Reader).

If you haven't seen these two resources yet, I would highly recommend bookmarking them if you're looking to do further bash scripting.\nRemoved portion regarding flow control due to edit in question. The find command needs -exec before the command or else it won't know that mv is actually a command you're attempting to execute on the files. Also, the {} in the find is used to refer to the results of the find command, thus you won't need $source as part of the find. The find command would probably look more like:\nfind $source -mtime +$days -exec mv {} $destination \\;\n\nIf the find results will include files/directories with spaces in them, then you may need to loop through the results (which will bring the do/done back into the mix) so that you can include the results of the find in a variable that can then be enclosed in quotes. That will give a structure similar to the following:\nfor result in $(find $soure -mtime +$days)\ndo\n    mv \"${result}\" $destination\ndone\n\nIf you're still having problems, I'd suggest including a copy of your terminal window from running the script. Also, try running just the find command by itself without the -exec mv... portions and replacing the variables with what you'd normally fill in for them during the script execution. That way you can get an idea as to what the find command is matching so you can be certain that it's matching the files you want it to before making any changes to the location of your files.\n\nA: I think you need to have a for statement before the do loop, in order for it to work.

It probably does not work because print is a special keyword, unlike Python 3.

Since you created your file system directly on the RAID (without creating a partition table) you cannot expect that there is one after reboot...\nWith this command you clearly make a filesystem on to the RAID directly:\nsudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/md0\n\nIt seems that the kernel gave a new name to the RAID after reboot (/dev/md127), try it to mount from the new device...\nmount /dev/md127 /mnt/bigraid/\n\nBy the way, why do you install xfsprogs when you are going to create a ext4 filesystem afterwards?\n", "Q: No user/host info in terminal prompt I open terminal and see only this:\n$\n\nas to where I expect it to look like\nuser@host:~$ \n\nscreenshot here\nDo you have any idea, what I need to do to get the regular shell prompt back? I am using Ubuntu 12.10.\n\nA: You seem to have changed to a very basic shell for that user (e.g. /bin/sh). Try changing to a more common shell, e.g. Bash, using\nchsh -s /bin/bash username\n\nOn a regular Ubuntu installation, the shell prompt is decorated in the .bashrc file in your home directory. However, not all shells are sourcing/supporting that file/configuration.\nFor more details on this decoration in Bash, see the occurrences of PS1 in the ~/.bashrc file.\n", "Q: Can't install Skype through Software Center 12.04 New install of Ubuntu 12.04.1. Start Ubuntu Software Center. Edit menu > Software Sources > Other > tick the Canonical Partners sources. Click close.\nSearch for Skype. Skype app is not listed.\nFollowing the suggestion I have reinstalled software center (surely there's a bug if the software center needs reinstalling after adding a source!), but still it does not show.\nFYI: At a terminal apt-cache search skype lists skype and skype-bin.\nI am comfortable at the command line, but people I am installing Ubuntu for are not. This is a real paper-cut - the first time I show them the software center, it doesn't work and I have to jump to command line.\nSo the question is: how to get it to show up in an easy-to-do user-friendly way?\nPS. Please do not mark this as a duplicate of how do I install skype unless that page is updated to actually answer this question (and presumably this and this).\n\nA: Heres the better solution:\nDownload deb file here. Open terminal, cd to directory of downloaded skype and then run sudo dpkg --install --force-all TheSkypeFileName.deb. After installation, do not run skype, run this command instead sudo apt-get install -f, this will install all the dependencies.

I have a new printer and found the proper driver for it when I am using Windows, but I work under Ubuntu most of the time and the system does not recognize the printer.\nIs there away to install a generic printer that makes it possible for me to use this while I am under Ubuntu? I am using Ubuntu 12.04 64 bits. Color is not important, as long as I can print my documents, I am OK. I can use Windows for color printing.\nThanks in advance,\nFarhad\n\nA: We found the driver which works on all our printers.

I seem to remember on very old versions of ubuntu having to disable the lower part of the touchpad, but I don't think it's been an issue for some time.\n\nA: To disable a strip at the bottom, you'd use synclient AreaBottomEdge=xxx, where xxx is a number which is less then the vertical width of the touchpad.\nFor example, on my Dell mini 10 (1010) with an Elantech touchpad, I had to use the following:\nsynclient AreaBottomEdge=690\n\n...while the touchpad dimentions are:\n~$ cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep range\n[    24.008] (--) synaptics: ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad: x-axis range 0 - 1152\n[    24.008] (--) synaptics: ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad: y-axis range 0 - 768\n\nYou can use AreaLeftEdge, AreaRightEdge and AreaTopEdge options in a similar manner, if needed. \nTo make the change permanent, I had to create /etc/X11/xorg.conf with the folloing content:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad\"\n        MatchProduct \"ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad\"\n        MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n        Driver \"synaptics\"\n        Option \"AreaBottomEdge\" \"690\"\n        Option \"AreaRightEdge\" \"1070\"\n        Option \"AreaLeftEdge\" \"110\"\nEndSection\n\nPS: You can find out how your Mini 10v's touchpad is identified by looking at the Xorg log info - cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep touch. \n", "Q: Configuring Proxy on 12.04 without gedit installed New to Linux and the command line, so go easy on me please.

(I have processes that prints out a lot of info and processes that don't print out anything, if that makes any difference)\n\nA: If I remember correctly:\n\n\n*\n\n*real time represents clock time: it is amount of time that process\ntakes to run. This time depends on number of processes being run on\nthe system, so this may explain why is real time better in first execution.\n\n*user time represents the amount of CPU time attributed to user instructions. (user-mode, outside of kernel)\n\n*sys time is amount of time that CPU spends in kernel within running process. For example, whenever you use read or write methods, time spent within kernel performing this 'services' is charged to this time.\n\n\nSo, when comparing general execution times, you could use user time + sys time.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Internet (wifi and ethernet) in 12.04 after some time just stops working So I have 12.04 on a HP Pavilion g series laptop. \n12.04 works fine on my computer. \nThen several weeks ago, my laptop would no longer connect to the internet.

So, first of all, you should remove the recess installed via npm:\nsudo npm uninstall recess -g\n\nAlso remove the node-less package installed via apt-get, so that we can start with a clean environment:\nsudo apt-get remove node-less\n\nAfter issuing these two commands, ensure that the following files do not exist, and if they exist delete them:\n/usr/bin/lessc\n/usr/local/bin/lessc\n\nAlso check the following directories (and remove them if they exist):\n/node_modules/less\n/usr/bin/node_modules/less\n/usr/node_modules/less\n/usr/local/bin/node_modules/less\n/usr/local/node_modules/less\n~/.node_modules/less\n~/.node_libraries/less\n\nAll that files and directories may be generated in various ways. Different installation methods lead to different directories used. Removing all that files is important to ensure that nothing conflicts: you should always have one, and just one, version of a software installed on your system. The only exception is when the distribution itself provides different versions of the same software (in this case, package are made so that they don't conflict with each other).\nNow you have a clean environment and can install node-less:\nsudo apt-get install node-less\n\nNote that the node-less package does not ship /usr/bin/recess, just /usr/bin/lessc, so it's perfectly OK if recess --compile fails (or, better, it must fail).\nIf lessc still does not work, please check the output of which lessc. Remember: if it does return something different than /usr/bin/lessc, it means that you are not using lessc from the distribution package, but something else.\n\nA: After following the steps from Andrea's answer you may have to run source ~/.bashrc if you're getting bash: /usr/local/bin/lessc: No such file or directory when you run lessc and when which lessc shows /usr/bin/lessc.  This is to update your $PATH environment variable.\n", "Q: Acer Aspire One 725 Temperature I just got my AO725 and I have sucessfully installed Xubuntu 12.10.

However, when I restarted, it just went straight to Windows 8 without giving me a Grub screen with options to start Ubuntu.  I haven't had luck with EasyBCD or the BootRepair utility.  \nAny idea how I can get a Dual Boot working?\n\nA: New computers which come with Windows 8 use UEFI, a try to replace the old BIOS firmware. You can read about this on Ubuntu wiki, but I'll paste you some things you can try to do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a LiveDVD or LiveUSB of Ubuntu-Secure-Remix 64bit or of Ubuntu (>=12.10) 64bit. The former is more convenient, as it already includes Boot-Repair, which is used in step 4.\n\n*Boot your PC using the LiveDVD or LiveUSB and choose \"Try Ubuntu\". Remark: if you get a Secure boot or signature error, disable SecureBoot as described here, then retry to boot the disk. You may also need to disable QuickBoot in the same menu.\nInstall Ubuntu from the Live CD/DVD or Live USB in the usual manner, then reboot the PC.\n\n*If the PC does not load Ubuntu (but instead loads Windows, for example, as in Bug #1050940), or if the Windows entry in the GRUB 2 menu does not boot Windows (see Bug #1024383), boot your PC using the Live CD/DVD or Live USB and choose \"Try Ubuntu\" once again. When the live session has loaded, run Boot-Repair (see link for details). When Boot-Repair loads, click on the \"Recommended repair\" button, and write on a paper the URL (paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXXX/) that will appear.\n\n*This should fix most boot problems. If this does not fix your boot problems, please follow this procedure. If still not good, please create a new thread in this forum, describing your problem and indicating the URL you wrote in the previous step. \n\nA: I had pretty much the same problem and the solution was to\n\n\n*\n\n*disable the secure boot option in the UEFI; then\n\n*Open Ubuntu by interruptiong the boot up (hopefully for the last time) \n\n*run Boot-Repair (which you've already got) using the \"Recommended Repair\" option as already explained above.\n\n\nSee more details here\nI found that if you don't disable the secure boot option GRUB does not run on boot up and the machine loads Win8 by default.\nGood luck :-) \n\nA: I hope you have followed this procedure to install Ubuntu.\nIf yes..You can do a Grub rescue by following this link.\n\nA: For those encountering the same issue, the first thing to try might be simply to change the boot priority order in the BIOS. \nI had the same problem with an Acer Aspire V3 with W8, after I installed Ubuntu 16.04.

Instead of that, I use it for using the full speed of my CPU. To install it, if you're NOT using Quantal, just follow the instructions on the download page. Note it's freeware, to download it for free enter just $0 on the Custom Ammount  textbox before downloading.\nIf you use Quantal, you'll have to download the debs from here if you use 32-bit, and from here if you use 64-bit. Download only granola_5.0.15-0quantal1_amd64.deb (or replace amd64 with i386 if you're using 32-bit) and granola-gui_5.0.15-0quantal1_amd64.deb (also replace amd64 with i386 if you're using 32-bit). Download them on a new subfolder, e.g. ~/Downloads/granola. Then install them entering a terminal and running the following commands:\n$ cd path/to/folder\n$ sudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\n(replace path/to/folder with the relative or absolute path to the folder where you downloaded the debs)\nThat's all what you have to do. As they have a Quantal repo, I assume they'll be adding it on their automatic installer soon, but when I tried it two days ago, it didn't still work. \nAfter installing Granola, search Granola on the dash and open it. Go to menu - Edit - Preferences and select Highest power. Then just open the startup applications configurator, and add a new entry with the name Granola and the command granola. Just save, and Granola will run each time you boot. You can do lscpu the check it.

I wanted to make a parallel installation of Lubuntu. \nI managed to install Lubuntu 12.04 from the CD after some changes in the boot-menu. But it is possible that it wasn't a UEFI-version/installation.\nAfter installing Lubuntu I expected, that the computer would ask me automatically while starting with wich OS (Win or Lubuntu) I wanted to work - as it does on my old computer. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way.\nThan I began to search and changed in the boot options: \nLegacy Support - enabled (loads Compatibiltiy Support Module) and Secure Boot disabled.\nNow I can load Lubuntu, if I push ESC while starting the computer to get to the boot menu. Then I have to manually elect \"Boot from notebook hard drive\" (CSM). And then I come to the well known menu where I can select the OS. Complicated....\nUnfortunatley UEFI boot order has still \"higher priority than legacy boot order\" so the computer starts with the \"UEFI OS boot loader\" where only Win8 works. I can't change the boot order in the way that \"Boot from notebook hard drive\" (CSM) would be at first place.\nWith other words: I haven't found a automatical way to come to the menu. I have to go to the boot menu every time I wnat to start Lubuntu.  \nCan someone help me, please???\nThanks a lot.\n\nA: Thanks a lot for your fast answer!\nI tried it hard, but unfortunatley the \"refind\" Win installation instructions are not totally complete and useful for beginners like me. They are written for someone who knows how to use a command line and the commands. Sometimes it's just a missing simple sentence like: \"to change directory use \"S:\" or \"cd S:\".\"\nAnd then I made a mistake and corrupted my Win8 - System, what can easily happen. So I had to recover my system and deleted everything. In total it took me some 7 hours to have a \"new\" Win8-Version without Lubuntu. Because of lack of time and patience I stay with Win8 now. Maybe I'm gonna install Lubuntu with one of the next versions, when all these children-diseases with UEFI in the common Lubuntu-Installation-Routine are solved. \nAgain: Many thanks, but it was to difficult for me as a beginner.\n\nA: You need to install an EFI boot loader for Linux. There are several available. Ubuntu uses GRUB 2 by default, but you can't install it quite completely in your BIOS boot. Furthermore, any attempt to do so carries some risk that you'll disrupt your minimally working BIOS-mode installation, since the grub-efi (EFI-mode) and grub-pc (BIOS-mode) packages are mutually exclusive. Therefore, I recommend you try installing rEFInd, which can redirect the boot process from EFI mode to BIOS mode, thus streamlining the process you're already using. Once that's up and running, you'll have several possible avenues to improve it further. The initial procedure is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download rEFInd in Windows.\n\n*Follow the Windows installation instructions on the rEFInd Web site.\n\n*While still in Windows, edit the refind.conf file. Uncomment the scanfor line and add hdbios to the list of options.\n\n*Reboot and test it.\n\n\nWith any luck, rEFInd will appear and give you two options: One will launch Windows and the other will launch your BIOS-mode GRUB, which in turn will launch Linux.\nThis may work acceptably well for you, in which case you can use it in the long term. You can, however, add an EFI-mode Linux boot loader such as ELILO or GRUB Legacy to the mix with minimal risk of disrupting the boot process. Switching from BIOS-mode GRUB to EFI-mode GRUB is also possible, but this is done most safely in your situation by compiling from source code, which is tedious. If you upgrade your kernel to a 3.3.0 or later kernel and add a driver for the filesystem on which your kernel resides to your rEFInd installation, you can boot the kernel directly. If you get EFI booting working to your satisfaction, you can remove your BIOS-mode GRUB installation and remove the hdbios option from refind.conf.\n", "Q: 'Error Splicing File: Input/Output Error' When Copying from a CD I'm trying to copy some files from a CD to my harddrive, but I keep getting the error:\nError Splicing File: Input/Output Error\nThe files ARE still copying, but only at about 2.5kB/s and the CD drive doesn't sound like it's doing much. I doubt it's a problem with filenames, since the disc appears to have been created on Windows, which to me seems to be stricter about what can & can't go in a filename. Nautilus shows the disc's format is UDF, although it also shows the disc's size is 0 bytes (with 0 in use) and contains about 3MB of stuff, even though the folder I'm trying to copy is bigger than that. What could be causing this?\n\nA: It is because the files that were written to the CD had not finished writing in the first place. The folder that was copied to the CD has broken files. The files when written onto the CD gets saved in distributed parts. When they don't get written completely, you get these errors.\nThere is no problem with the format. Try writing the whole content over again with a fresh CD.\n", "Q: Use Gnome, but Login With KDM I'm trying to find a way to make the login screen a KDE session in Ubuntu 10.04 while maintaining a Gnome Session after logging in.

It used to refer to just video bitrate, but with the recent ffmpeg/avconv syntax overhaul, it now refers to overall bitrate. So the first pass is telling avconv that it has 800kbit/s to play with for the video, but the second pass is telling it that it has (800-128)=672kbit/s to work with.\nWhat the first pass does is create a sort of roadmap for the second pass to take advantage of - this place is an action scene, it needs a higher bitrate; this is a slow conversation, it needs less - that sort of thing. Because it's working with incorrect information, the roadmap is incorrect.\nUse -b:v instead (and -b:a instead of -ab), like so:\navconv -y -i video.mpg -s 640x360 -pass 1 -threads auto -c:v libxvid -b:v 672k -r 24 -f avi -an /dev/null\navconv -i video.mpg -s 640x360 -pass 2 -threads auto -c:v libxvid -b:v 672k -r 24 -g 300 -bf 2 -c:a libmp3lame -ac 2 -b:a 128k -ar 48000 video.avi\n\nAlso, a lot of those options are possibly unnecessary, as avconv will use the same options the input has. Unless you're resizing the video, omit the -s 640x360 bit. Likewise, unless you need to change the framerate, omit the -r 24, and unless you really need to change the sampling rate, omit the -ar 48000. Obviously, if you know that you need them, leave them in.\n", "Q: Running \"update-grub\" doesn't update GRUB!

(Thank you for your time, bcbc.)  This was my fault.\nIt looks like my Windows boot configuration data got screwed up by Windows' Startup Repair - my recovery partition (at the beginning of the disk) in particular.  It had gotten the Windows 8 bootloader installed on top of it :( and there was no bootloader installed on the new 8 partition.  I thought that it was giving me an old configuration because it in effect wasn't showing any changes.  Since this is a new install, I've just wiped that 8 install and started again, but I suspect that this would be much harder on an established install.\nLesson learned: instead of lazily running Startup Repair, fix things from Command Prompt yourself!  Startup repair becomes unreliable with many Windows installs!\n", "Q: How to enable alt+right click to resize window Been looking around and can't see to find any information on how to enable alt+right click for window resize?\nedit\nMy mistake\nRunning Unity 12.04, I am logged in under failsafe graphics mode as i can't get my 590GX Nvidida card to boot up without being in safe, but thats another problem.\nCurrently, my alt+click works and i can drag windows around. \nBut i can't currently, alt+right-click to resize. \n\nA: The answer from here describes a method that works in both 12.04 (and possibly older versions) as well as 12.10/13.04 with the new gsettings\nPut this in a script and run it:\n#!/bin/bash\ngconftool-2 -s -t bool /apps/metacity/general/resize_with_right_button true\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences resize-with-right-button true\n\nThe gconftool-2 line is for GConf based systems, and gsettings is its newer replacement.\n\nA: Install compizconfig-settings-manager\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nand run ccsm from the Dash or from a Terminal window.\nccsm\n\nClick Window Management and Resize Window.\nFor  | Initiate Window Resize assign <Alt>Button3.\n\nA: Here is the solution I found:\nUse gconf-editor and set /apps/metacity/general: resize_with_right_button = true\n", "Q: Python ImportErrors while trying to get a program (found on Google Code) to work I'm trying to install a program written in Python / -->http://code.google.com/p/amphetype/<-- / \n\nI did subversion checkout\nsvn checkout http://amphetype.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ amphetype-read-only\n\nand tried to setup / run the program, but I am seeing ImportErrors like that:\npm@machina-pm:/home/pn/amphetype-read-only$ python setup.py \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"setup.py\", line 5, in <module>\n    import py2exe\nImportError: No module named py2exe\n\n\nand:\npm@machina-pm:/home/pn/amphetype-read-only$ python Amphetype.py \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"Amphetype.py\", line 10, in <module>\n    from Config import Settings\n  File \"/home/pn/amphetype-read-only/Config.py\", line 5, in <module>\n    from QtUtil import *\n  File \"/home/pn/amphetype-read-only/QtUtil.py\", line 4, in <module>\n    from PyQt4.QtCore import *\nImportError: No module named PyQt4.QtCore\n\n\nEDIT:\ninstalling python-qt (sudo apt-get install python-qt4) helped in getting rid of the second ImportError.However program still doesn't start, now it says:\npm@machina-pm:/home/pn/amphetype$ python Amphetype.py\nNo protocol specified\nNo protocol specified\nAmphetype.py: cannot connect to X server :0\n\nPS. readme.txt that goes with the source code sadly doesn't get me very far (author  says that it was developed under windows, and the whole project seems to be abandoned now). I used to use that software on Windows and I like it a lot, and would love to get it running on Linux.\nEDIT 2:\nUfff... It works at last, moving the amphetype directory from ~/amphetype to /etc/amphetype did the trick, although I'm not sure why...\n\nA: py2exe can only run on windows so I don't know how you can get round that.  Maybe using wine.\nyou can get round the ImportError: No module named PyQt4.QtCore by installing python-qt4\nsudo apt-get install python-qt4\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to change the Skype indicator icon? I've searched high and low on my system for the image that is displayed in the Skype indicator but is nowhere to be found, even the Skype deb file doesn't have anything like it and no other Icon set changes the image.\nIs it possible to? at all?\n\nA: It seems to be hard-coded in the binary. As long as it is not an open source program, you are not allowed to change it. The discussion regarding this topic dates back to 2008!\n", "Q: nm-applet freeze in ubuntu 12.04 I have the same problem as Network Manager Applet menu freezes and does not respond in ubuntu 12.04.\nNow, even restarting the nm-applet won't help.\nIs it a bug? I thought 12.04 would be pretty stable now.\nWhat could I do then？\nThanks!\n\nA: I think I am still having a similar bug on my 12.04 LTS system.  For now, restarting nm-applet works for me, as described in this link.\nalex@alex-desktop:~$ ps -A | grep nm-applet\n21903 ? 00:00:00 nm-applet\nalex@alex-desktop:~$ kill 21903\nalex@alex-desktop:~$ nohup nm-applet &\n[1] 22476\nalex@alex-desktop:~$ nohup: ignoring input and appending output to `nohup.out'\nalex@alex-desktop:~$\n\nCertainly this is not a fix, but it's a quick way to get nm-applet working again (for me).  In fact, when I'm lazy, I can just start a new instance of nm-applet without killing the old one.  Maybe someone call tell me why that's a dangerous idea, but for now it's helping!\n", "Q: Flickering monitor connected by VGA to new System76 Setup:  New System76 Lemur laptop running Ubuntu Unity 12.10 is connected via VGA cable to a new dell Ultrasharp u2312hm 23-inch monitor.\nSymptom:  The Dell monitor has an annoying flicker, like high-speed waves of darkness passing over it, pretty subtle at times, but very annoying at others.  The flicker seems to increase when I type or move the mouse.\nWhy I don't think it is the Dell monitor's fault:  I connected the monitor to an old Dell laptop and there was no flicker.\nQuestion:  Is there a known solution?\n\nA: Solution to my own question:  Stop trying to use a VGA connector.  Instead, use something digital like HDMI or DVI.  My computer had HDMI and my monitor had DVI; an adapter between those two ports gave me a perfect image on the monitor.\n", "Q: All menu items greyed out in Golly. How to diagnose the problem? I tried installing Golly from the package manager. Everything seems to work fine, except that almost all the menu options are greyed out, disabled and unclickable. I tried with the latest version from Sourceforge and have the same issue.\nOnly the \"Preferences\", \"Quit\" and all the \"Help\" menu options are not greyed out. This problem only seems to affect Golly. I found an old bug report, which seemed to be a more specific version of this problem, but that is closed and two years old...\nMy question is: what can I do to diagnose the problem? No other program seems to have this issue. No one else seems to have noticed this issue. What can I try to work out what has broken?\nI am running 12.04. The problem occurs with the version of golly in the repos and with the latest version downloaded from sourceforge.\n\nA: golly doesn't appear to support the global menu so start it without. To test this - from a terminal use - \nenv UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 golly \n\nTo adjust golly's .desktop for starting from application menu/Dash or launcher icon - \n gksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/golly.desktop\n\nEdit the Exec= line to this, save\nExec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 golly\n\nIf you wish to protect the .desktop from an update (unlikely), then copy the .desktop to your Home folder instead & edit as above. (may need to log out/in to take affect, usually doesn't\nmkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications && \\\ncp /usr/share/applications/golly.desktop ~/.local/share/applications && \\\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/golly.desktop\n\n", "Q: Error occured when downloading wubi 12.04 I tried to download Ubuntu 12.04, but it froze so i shut down the computer.

I'm working designing a fix for a paper cut, and I'd like to get someone to approve it before I try to implement it. How should I go about doing this?\n\nA: The process you follow for getting design approval depends on what app your working on.\nUbuntu/Canonical apps\nThese are apps that are originally build and distributed in Ubuntu. These include, but are not limited to, Ubuntu Software Centre, Ubuntu One Control Panel, and Unity.\nTo request design input on a paper cut in one of these, you should follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the bug report has a paper cut task open on it. See here for details on how to go about this.\n\n*Make sure you have proposed a design fix in the comments of the report since it's a little rude to not do some sort of work before asking others to get involved.\n\n*Assign the paper cut task to Nick Tait, a project manager on the Design Team at Canonical. Click on the exclamation mark in the 'Assigned to' field on the paper cuts task.

Use your browser's search feature to find the app your looking for since there's a lot of lists there.\nSend a message to the list, mentioning that your part of the One Hundred Paper Cuts project and are looking for input from the developers on a design fix. Make sure you've come up with an idea yourself before approaching the developers since you're the one working on the bug and it's a bit rude to go to them unprepared.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 password don't works after login During a complete fresh installation I choosed a case sensitive password with an \"!\" inside the string, it works fine for the normal login, but when I try to use sudo or su or passwd or some GUI stuff which requires a password I get an authentication error.\nI really have no idea what to do, I tried to enter the password in an editor to check numlock, etc... no problem.\nAfter the login I get an error (ca. 1 minute after login), in german:\n\n\"Es wurde ein Problem mit einer Systemanwendung festgestellt\"\n\nSomething like:\n\n\"There is a problem with a system process/program\"\n\n\nA: It looks like your root keyboard layout is different from your user's.

I want to get involved with the One Hundred Paper Cuts project, but I don't know what there is to do. I'm not a programmer so I'm not sure if I can even contribute anything. Can someone please explain what there is to do on the One Hundred Paper Cuts project?\n\nA: There are a lot of ways to get involved in the One Hundred Paper Cuts project. It's important to note that you do not have to be a programmer to make a significant contribution. There are many roles that need to be filled, and writing code is only a small part of fixing a paper cut.\nIf you find something below that you find interesting, then join the Paper Cut Ninja team on Launchpad, subscribe to the mailing list, introduce yourself and left us know what you're interested in doing. If you've got any questions at all, we'll be happy to help you out.\nReporter - Reports an issue\nReporting an issue is something everyone can do. If there's something in your favourite app that gets under your skin, then report it (as long as the app is included on the desktop). If you really want to get involved, then pick an app from the desktop and sit down with it for an hour or two and look for paper cuts to report.\nAnalyst - identifies what's actually wrong\nConfirm new bugs - someone needs to come along and see if the backlog of newly reported bugs are actually valid paper cuts. Sit down with the app in question and have a look at what's happening. If the reported did not provide enough information, then request the missing information and mark the report as Incomplete.\nTriage confirmed bugs - once a bug has been confirmed to exist, someone has to come along and figure out what's actually wrong. For example, is the problem with the app itself or in the graphical toolkit it's built with, such as Gtk. This will usually involve talking with someone on the Paper Cuts or Desktop teams for advice until you get enough experience to make the decision yourself. \nOnce the affected package has been identified, then someone can figure out what's actually wrong. If you're not familiar with the codebase of the package itself, then get in contact with the package developer for advice. Once they tell you what's up, you should post that response as a comment on the bug report.\nDesigner - Decides how it should work\nOnce a problem has been identified, a fix needs to be designed. This won't be necessary for every paper cut (some of them will only have a single way to be fixed). In the other cases, you should sit down with the app and think about how the fix should work. Once you've come up with an idea, you should get approval for your design before it is implemented.\nDeveloper - implements fix in code\nIf you know exactly what's going on then you can get stuck right into the code and start fixing the paper cut. How you go about this depends on which app your working on and where that app was originally developed. \nIf it's a Gnome app, then your best bet would be to pull the source code down from git.gnome.org, work on your patch and export the fix as a .patch file which you can attach to the bug report in Gnome Bugzilla.\nMany other project are hosted in Git repositories and track their issues in Bugzilla. If you're even unsure of where to go, then here into #ubuntu-desktop and ask. Someone there will be more than happy to point you in the right direction.\nIf it's a bug in an Ubuntu package, such as Unity or the Ubuntu Software Centre, then there's a great guide to fixing Ubuntu bugs on the Ubuntu developer website.\nTester - verifies the fix works properly\nOnce a path has been developed and submitted for approval, someone needs to test it. This could be left to the package developer/maintainer, but they have a lot of other work to do, and everything that can be done to lighten their workload in one area means they can get more done in others. In that regard, if a patch or branch is sitting on a paper cut, either on Launchpad or upstream, then downloading and applying that patch before giving it a test drive will be a great help.\nOnce you're put it through it's paces, leave a message on the bug report, both upstream and in Ubuntu, detailing your results. In the beginning, the developer or maintainer won't be able to simply take your word that the patch is ready, but if you work on one package a lot and the developer gets to know you, your word will carry more weight and you may even be given upload rights to that packages source archive.\nLiaison - ensures fix is acceptable upstream\nLiason and Tester can, but don't have to, overlap. Once it has been verified that a patch has solved the problem, it needs to gain approval from the upstream developer of the package. Comments from the upstream bug tracker don't always get posted in Launchpad, so someone has to act as the runner between the two, copying and pasting questions and their answers between the two. Remember, Ubuntu isn't the only distro these apps are appearing in, and the developers can't be expected to keep track of everyone that's using their software, so you have to make sure everyone working on a bug is kept in the loop.\nPackager - integrates patch or branch into the distro\nOnce a patch has been written, it needs to be integrated into the existing app package. This will involve downloading and installing the version of Ubuntu you intend the patch to be released on, download the source for the package, applying the patch, and packaging the result. The Ubuntu Packaging Guide covers how to go about doing this.\nDepending on the nature of the patch, you may need to do this up to three times - the current stable release, the current LTS and the current development release are all viable targets for patches.\nUpdater - handles SRU to get patch into the stable release\nThis is one that not everyone will be able to do, as it requires upload right to the Ubuntu package archives. Once a patch has been packaged, it may need to be backported to needs to either the current stable release, the current LTS, or both. If you want to earn those upload right, the best way to go about doing it is to package patches and propose them for SRU. Once you've proposed a number that are perfect first time round, you can apply for upload rights.\n", "Q: Which version of Ubuntu to download to use in Parallels on Mac OS X Which version of Ubuntu do I need to download to create a VM in Parallels on my Mac?\n32 bit  vs  64 bit  ?\ni386  vs  AMD version ?\n\nA: For Linux, amd64 refers to x86_64. If you have Parallels you have Intel hardware. Grab the amd64 version and you should be good to go.\n", "Q: erasing my HDD and starting over \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I securely erase a hard drive?\nHow to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on? \n\nOk. All I want to do i erase my entire HDD including ubuntu 12.04. I just bought win7, and I want to erase everything so I can boot that up. I have no important files, I just want it gone. I am having trouble doing that. I get access denied everytime i try to clear my HDD. Help please.\n\nA: If you have one operating system installed, and you want to wipe the disk and install another operating system, you don't have to do anything in the first operating system for this.\nEvery OS that has an installer (including Ubuntu and Windows) is capable of erasing the old operating system when you install it. This would apply equally well if you were erasing Windows and installing Ubuntu.\nIt's only if you want to keep your first OS that you sometimes need to do something in the first OS before installing the second.\nWhen you install the second operating system (whether it be Windows or any other OS), you will be able to tell the installer where you want it installed. You will have the option to format the disk or remove existing partitions.\nTherefore, you do not need to do anything in Ubuntu.\nYou could boot from an Ubuntu live CD and erase the existing partitions, but there is no reason for you to do that, because the Windows installer (like any operating system's installer) is quite capable of doing that as part of the installation process.\nOn the other hand, if you want to recover some files, such as personal documents, from the Ubuntu system, you can use Ubuntu for that. (But since your Ubuntu system works, I'm guessing you've already done that. If the installed Ubuntu system were broken, you could boot from an Ubuntu live CD and access your files. If you need help doing that, please feel free to post a new question about that.)\nIf you need specific assistance using the Windows installer to wipe out the pre-existing operating system (in this case Ubuntu), that is beyond the scope of our site.

I then set it up so that every time Ubuntu boots, the shared folder will be mounted under /files.\nSo far, everything works well. However, I created a second folder called /files2 and wish to use lsyncd to sync /files to /files2.\n\n\n*\n\n*lsyncd was installed using sudo apt-get install lsyncd.\n\n*After installation, I created /etc/lsyncd/lsyncd.conf.lua.\n\n\nThis is my configuration file (etc/lsyncd/lsyncd.conf.lua)\nsync {\n    default.rsync,\n    source    = \"/www\",\n    target    = \"/www2\",\n    rsyncOpts = \"-ltuspogX\",\n    delay=0\n}\n\nThe problem is that the sync never seems to happen, that is even if I restart or start/stop lsyncd.\nFinally, if I ever create a file in the shared folder on the host machine (windows 7), I can see it in /files, but it never gets synced to /files2.\nI need to get lsyncd to sync when I create/modify/delete folders in /files in my Ubuntu guest or Windows.\nIs there anything in my configuration that I have missed to cause the sync to not work?\n\nA: rsyncOpts was depreciated you need to use the rsync {} structure in the lua config file\nThis link should help: https://github.com/axkibe/lsyncd/wiki/Lsyncd%202.1.x%20%E2%80%96%20Layer%204%20Config%20%E2%80%96%20Default%20Behavior\nLook at the \"default.rsync\" section, there's some example code and below it a list of the available rsync options.\n\nA: Try this configuration\nsettings {\n    logfile = \"/var/log/lsyncd.log\",\n    statusFile = \"/var/log/lsyncd-status.log\",\n    statusInterval = 20,\n    nodaemon = true\n}\nsync {\n   default.rsync,\n   source=\"/files1/\",\n   target=\"/files2/\",\n   rsync = {\n     archive = true,\n     compress = true,\n     whole_file = false,\n     _extra = { \"-ltuspogX\" },\n     verbose = true\n   },\n   delay=5,\n   log=all,\n}\n\n", "Q: SSH need password but i have generated rsa key i have generated rsa key and add it to server's ~/.ssh/authored_keys.\nwhy i nedd password when i ssh server?\nmy local name is A and server name is B(a root user).do i need create a user named A?\n\nA: You need password to Unlock generated keys. It requires only first time when you want use SSH. Then for a specific session no need to enter password.\n(from man pages)\nWhen the user logs in, the ssh program tells the server which key pair it would like to use for authentication. The server checks if this key is permitted, and if so, sends the user (actually the ssh program running on behalf of the user) a challenge, a random number, encrypted by the user's public key. The challenge can only be decrypted using the proper private key. The user's client then decrypts the challenge using the private key, proving that he/she knows the private key but without disclosing it to the server.\n\nA: Although the question is not entirely clear, I suspect that the answer is that you've authorised the key for the wrong user.\nWhen you say you added the key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys that means the key is valid only to log in for that user (whichever it may have been). So, if you were logged in as userA that means that key will be used only if you try and log in as userA again, but won't be used if you try and log in as userB.\nBy default ssh will log you in as the remote user with the same name as your local user. So, if you're logged in to the local system as userA, ssh will try to log you in to the remote system as userA. If you need to log in as userB you can use ssh userB@my.server.net rather than ssh my.server.net.\n", "Q: New computer, same RAID. MDADM won't assemble Ubuntu 12.04 64. Hardware failure (motherboard) led me to build a new machine, and I took the opportunity to do a fresh install of Ubuntu (first one was a learning experience).

I initially had a grub error booting into windows (but not ubuntu), but I could still boot into windows by switching to the windows bootloader in the BIOS. So I ran boot repair in ubuntu and everything was fine. However there were some sound issues, I tinkered with alsa and ended up breaking it more, so I decided to reinstall. When I booted from the USB, I got the option to remove the existing ubuntu and reinstall (which I figured would leave windows alone, since there were other options for that and this option specifically mentioned only Ubuntu files). Now, when I try booting from anything besides the USB, I get the grub2 error: unknown filesystem and it goes straight to the recovery command line. \nIf I could just get windows to boot I could wipe everything besides windows and start over from there, but the windows bootloader now goes straight to grub, where before it still at least booted just windows. My problem is all I can do (besides the grub2 reovery command line) is off the live USB, so I don't think I can install anything (like boot repair) and I can't view my actual hard drive partitions from the ubuntu terminal, as it just lists the USB. I have no clue what to do from here, short of a total wipe of the HDD when installing ubuntu, which will only be a last resort for me.\n\nA: Okay, talk about crazy. I tried another reinstall, this time doing the custom selection for choosing which partition to install to. Still no luck. Tried it a 3rd time, this time choosing a different boot option from the BIOS for the USB(there were 2 options for booting from the USB, one with UEFI in the name). Reinstalled again, once again choosing the manual selection for choosing the partition to install to. On this attempt, everything works great. Including all the sound problems I was initially having which prompted the reinstall. Just have to run boot repair again, as the windows option isn't booting in grub. Just leaves me thinking, what the hell...\n", "Q: List of folders being synchronised on Ubuntu One I think Ubuntu One is syncing my backup folder (deja-dup).  I'm concerned this could be a problem should a file become corrupted, and I need to retrieve it.  Is there some way I can see a list of synced folders and turn off ones I do not want? Thanks!\n\nA: To view the folders Ubuntu One is syncing you need to open the Ubuntu One Control Panel. The first view you come across will be the list of folders currently being synchronised.\n\nIf you see you deja-dup backup folder in there and you want to stop it syncing, then you can do one of two things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Uncheck the \"Sync locally\" option in the Ubuntu One Control Panel.

I have SSD0 on which Windows 7 is installed, and SSD1 on which I'd like to have Xubuntu and Arch Linux. I understand the process when one disk is involved, but have no idea when it comes to multiple disks.\nThank you.\n\nA: There are really three issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot loader location -- Boot loaders may be located on the primary disk's ESP, on the secondary disk's ESP, or on non-ESP partitions on either disk. Officially, the EFI spec allows the firmware to launch a boot loader from any ESP, but in practice non-ESP locations also often work if the partition in question uses FAT or if you've got a suitable driver installed. rEFIt, rEFInd, and GRUB 2 can redirect the boot process to boot loaders stored on other than the main ESP, although they need drivers to read non-FAT (or non-HFS+ on Mac) partitions. Some boot loaders, such as gummiboot, are limited to supporting the partition from which they launched, which could necessitate putting all your boot loaders on one ESP.\n\n*OS installation location -- An ESP-resident boot loader must necessarily support launching an OS that's primarily resident on some other partition. In principle, there's no reason this partition can't reside on another physical disk entirely, and I don't know of any practical impediments to doing so. Thus, you can install a boot loader on the primary disk's ESP and have it boot your main OS from the secondary disk.\n\n*Kernel location -- Linux boot loaders such as GRUB Legacy and GRUB 2 can load Linux kernels from locations other than the ESP, and in principle this other location can be a physically separate disk. In theory, ELILO can do the same, but I've never managed to get this to work. A kernel configured as an EFI stub loader must either be stored on an ESP or be loaded by an EFI that's less fussy about this or by a boot manager like rEFInd that can redirect to another partition or another disk. Thus, your kernel might need to be stored on the primary disk's ESP in some configurations. (Ubuntu uses GRUB 2 by default, so a standard Ubuntu installation is pretty flexible in this respect.)\n\n\nIn the end, there are few major limitations, at least in principle. You might run into some issues with buggy firmware implementations or if you use certain boot loader combinations, but you should be able to overcome these issues by proper placement of your boot loader and kernel files.\n\nA: When using a boot manager such as rEFInd, it auto-detects all installed bootloaders across your disks, not just the disk where the rEFInd bootloader resides.\n", "Q: Does every i5 i7 intel processor have intel graphics on board?

No reply to the bug report or alternative to submit the report or bug not answered First, I am new to Ubuntu, and then I was getting a recurring error: window titled \"crash report\" (it's contents are as below). There is Stop sign being shown at the top next to the battery indicator. Then I can't open the software updates and I'm not able to get updates via terminal.I have tried the 'package manager troubleshooting' help but I don't know how exactly it works and hence I am not able to do anything.\nThe error looks like this:\nExecutable Path\n/usr/lib/evolution/evolution-calender-factory\nProblem Type\n crash\nArchitecture \n Amd64\nCore Dump\n (binary data)\nCrash Counter\n 1\nDate\n Fri , Dec 21...\nDisassembly\n\nthere is a lot description under this and difficult to write but it has something like\ndivl\nmov\nmov\ntest \njne \njmpg\n\n\nA: If you have submitted the crash report, you have little options but wait for the developers to read and solve it. They are usually busy folks, but the bug will get a response, either from a real developer or from a robot processing it.\nNote that the more likely answer is that the bug is a duplicate.\nIf you don't want to wait for a solution, you can only try to solve it yourself (if you have enough knowledge) or try to get someone with the knowledge to solve it (either paying or asking nicely once).\nIf you want better care you can always opt for pay support, but it doesn't come cheap. Please check what some option covers before buying it.

During its work, I'm getting this:\ngnutls_handshake: A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.\nResearch online, including on this website (https://askubuntu.com/questions/136082/ubuntu-12-4-and-gnus-and-maybe-gnutls , Mutt not working due to \"gnutls_handshake: A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.\" error ) shows there's a bug with gnutls in the 12.04 release.\nI posted this information to the gdrive development forum but doubt they will start using openssl because of this. So instead, I'd like to look into upgrading gnutls to fix this bug.\nProblem is - I have no clue how to do that in a way that wouldn't break the entire OS.\nAny directions would be appreciated!\n\nA: Backports\nIt sounds like you need a backport. A backport makes a more recent version of an upstream project in an older Ubuntu release.\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*More information on backports and how to use them.\n\n*How to request a backport.\n\n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily a complete answer for you. Backporting a library successfully and without unintended consequences is considerably more involved, because as you say it can break things.\nStable Release Updates\nIf it is a simple bug that you need fixed, rather than new functionality, then it is also possible to cherry-pick the fix into a stable release update. See:\n\n\n*\n\n*Documentation of Stable Release Updates.\n\n\nHowever, bugs fixed this way generally need to be simple enough that they obviously won't break anything. Again, this is difficult in this particular case.\nPersonal Package Archives\nFinally, you can make changes to packages and put them into your own personal package archive. This way you don't have to worry about adversely affecting others who aren't expecting it (as they have to explicitly enable your own specific archive), and so you don't have to follow the stricter rules required for SRUs and backports.\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to use personal package archives.\n\n", "Q: libvpx not getting installed in ubuntu 12.04 When I use the command :\nsudo apt-get -f install libvpx*\nI get the following error :\nUnpacking libvpx1 (from .../libvpx1_1.0.0-1_amd64.deb) ...\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/libvpx1_1.0.0-1_amd64.deb (--unpack):\n trying to overwrite '/usr/lib/libvpx.so.1.0.0', which is also in package libvpx 110-1\ndpkg-deb: error: subprocess paste was killed by signal (Broken pipe)\n\nBut I checked /usr/lib\nThere is no libvpx.so.1.0.0 present in the directory.\n\nA: If you only intend to install the libvpx library package, open a command terminal (Ctrl-Alt-t), and run the command sudo apt-get install libvpx1.\nBy, including the wildcard * in your command (using libvpx*), you are requesting a number of other files and potentially numerous dependencies.\n\nA: I was able to solve the issue by following below mentioned steps :\nGo to directory /var/cache/apt/archives/\nUse the command :\nsudo dpkg --unpack --force-all ./libvpx1_1.0.0-1_amd64.deb\nNote that using \"force-all\" option is important.\nThis forcefullly installed the libvpx debian package & the issue got solved.\nThanks for all the replies.\n", "Q: Rsync between 2 servers with different OS versions I is it possible to Rsync data between two servers running Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS?

Command line options can specify a\n  different block size for input/reading (ibs) compared to\n  output/writing (obs), though the block size (bs) option will override\n  both ibs and obs. The default value for both input and output block\n  sizes is 512 bytes (the block size of Unix block devices). The count\n  option for copying is measured in blocks, as are both the skip count\n  for reading and seek count for writing. Conversion operations are also\n  affected by the \"conversion block size\" (cbs).\nFor some uses of the dd command, block size may have an effect on\n  performance. For example, when recovering data from a hard disk, a\n  small block size will generally cause the most bytes to be recovered.\n  For greater speed during copy operations, a larger block size may be\n  used. When dd is used for network transfers, the block size may have\n  an impact on packet size, depending on the network protocol used.\n\nsource\n\nA: First command uses 512 byte blocks, whereas the second uses 1MB blocks. Actually a 4kB blocksize will do the trick in most cases as the disk uses 4kB blocksize on hardware level.\nWhat happens in the first case is the following (simplified):\n\n\n*\n\n*read a 4kB block from disk into memory buffer\n\n*replace 512 bytes in memory buffer\n\n*write 4kB buffer to disk\n\n*read 4kB block from disk into memory\n\n*replace next 512 bytes in buffer\n\n*write 4kB block to disk\n\n\n... replacing a 4kB block requires 8 reads from disk and 8 writes to disk.\nI guess you get the image for what happens when you increase block size to 4kB or larger (preferably multiple of 4kB) and how that increases speed. It doesn't have to read the disk any more, because entire blocks are written.\nOn top of that speed up, it is quite likely that the PC is now delivering data fast enough to the disk, that it can probably write consecutive block one after the other, without having to wait for the rotating platter to do a full revolution until the right block appears under the heads.\n\nA: Argument bs=1M in second command means number of bytes read and then written. So, when you run dd with this argument, 1 MB will be read from /dev/zero, and then 1 MB will be written to /dev/sda. When you don't have the argument, default value for byte number is used, I think it is 512 bytes. This number of bytes is much smaller, so more reading and writing is needed to complete requested operation and it will be slower.\n", "Q: PHP 5.4 in official repository When PHP will be updated to version 5.4.x in official repositories?\n\nA: PHP 5.4 has been in the official repositories since Ubuntu 12.10.\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/php5\n", "Q: How to change the NetBeans IDE language?

My PC will be repaired, so I have to create a recovery DVD. How can I do this?\n\nA: Do you mean that you want to back up your entire drive so that you can restore it as it was before you sent it in for repair? Or do you want an Ubuntu installation disk with your particular set-up?\nSolution #1\nTo back up your entire disk, the best solution is a product called RedoBackup. It is a user-friendly product, but you have to install it first. Be aware that your installation will probably not fit onto a DVD, and so RedoBackup will back up instead onto different media; the recommended medium is an external hard drive, or a hard drive on a different computer over the LAN. If you do not have an external hard drive, or access to another computer over your local LAN, this solution is not for you.\nTo install RedoBackup, first download it. To install to a USB stick, install UNetBootIn (if I remember correctly, it is in the Ubuntu Software Centre), and use UNetBootIn to create the USB using your downloaded RedoBackup. To burn to a CD, use the Brasero Disk Burner in Ubuntu.\nAs a precaution, please do your usual daily backups before you send in your computer!\nTo back up your hard drive, boot from the RedoBackup CD or USB (whichever one you made). Follow the instructions to back up.\nTo restore your computer when you get it back, book from the RedoBackup CD or USB and follow the instructions to overwrite your hard drive. Warning: This procedure will erase everything on your hard drive before it restores (which, presumably, is exactly what you want).\nSolution #2\nIf you cannot use RedoBackup, the best solution in my opinion (others may disagree) is:\n\n\n*\n\n*As a security precaution, back up all your data (using your usual daily backup procedure).\n\n*Create a Live CD of Ubuntu; either 12.04 if you want the LTS, or 12.10 if you want the latest.\n\n*Back up your entire home folder, including all the hidden folders.\n\n\nWhen you get your computer back:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall Ubuntu from scratch (it doesn't take long).\n\n*Restore your entire home folder, including the hidden folders.\n\n*Install extra programs as you need them from the Ubuntu Software Centre (always quick).\n\n", "Q: Install Arcreader to ubuntu 12.10 I try to install Arcreader to ubuntu 12.10 64bit.

This may not be the right choice for 1TB external hard drive.

What can I do to restore the functionality of the encfs folders from the portable drive on the desktop machine? I am holding off upgrading the laptop until this functionality is restored.\nEdit: Just noticed that the unity icon for the portable drive on the desktop, running 12.10 also does not show a \"format\" option when right clicked, as the unity icon does on the laptop running 12.04. Again, this may just be a difference between 12.10 and 12.04, or it may be related to the problem.\n\nA: Noticed that the mount points appeared to be different between the old portable drive encfs folders on the cryptkeeper display, and the new encfs folder I had created as a test.\nThe old folders were simply shown as /media/name-of-drive/name-of-folder whereas the new mount point for the test folder was media/username/name-of-drive/name-of-folder\nI went through the import process again, this time using ctrl-h to make the .encfs folders visible in the directory (should have remembered that before!).

I keep reading in the news about this \"Ubuntu by Canonical\" thing, and it seems to me that this isn't entirely accurate. I have, for instance, spent about fifteen thousand hours working for Ubuntu, but I've never – not even for an hour – been employed by Canonical, though I would like to some day. Seems like a good company with good values. Actually, except for some very special cases, I've never accepted any payment for any work I've ever done in this community. Because I do still consider this a community project with a strong sponsor and not a company surrounded by fanboys. \nHas this changed? If so, when did that happen? To my eyes, Canonical supports Ubuntu and Ubuntu supports Canonical, but Ubuntu is not a \"by Canonical\" product. \nAm I wrong about this now, or am I still in the black? \n\nA: If you go to The Ubuntu Story page, you will find this:\n\nGovernance\nVersion 4.10, codenamed the 'Warty Warthog', the first official Ubuntu release, was launched in October 2004. Global interest in Ubuntu was dramatic from the outset. The year following the Warty Warthog release saw huge growth in the Ubuntu community as thousands of free software enthusiasts and experts joined.\nThe governance of Ubuntu is somewhat independent of Canonical, with volunteer leaders from around the world taking responsibility for many of the critical elements of the project. It remains a key tenet of the Ubuntu Project that Ubuntu is a shared work between Canonical, other companies, and the thousands of volunteers who bring their expertise to bear on making it a world-class platform for the whole world to use.\n\nSo you can see that who powers Ubuntu is Canonical and it have ever been, but Canonical is for the Open-Source and the Collaborative Work, it's because of that you have never been hired by Canonical, but contributed to the development of Ubuntu. As you said Ubuntu is a community work, but it has one company that is responsable for it, Canonical, that works like a gatekeeper of the Ubuntu development.\nWe are not fanboys surronding Canonical, we are enthusiasts surrounding Ubuntu, Canonical supports Ubuntu, but does not take it's development to closed doors, it just regulates the path of the development, takes care of legal issues and decides some major issues about the OS. I don't see Ubuntu separately from Canonical, they are one thing, Canonical is all about Ubuntu.\n\nA: On the Ubuntu-Canonical relationship, please think of it this way:\nUbuntu = Canonical + Community.\nFor certain parts of Ubuntu, Canonical will be the biggest contributor/influencer, and for other parts the Community (that is not Canonical) will be. It's a partnership where each party brings certain strengths and contributions (somewhat like a marriage).\nThe problem with the news that one sees out there about Ubuntu is that it is almost always wrong. That is our bug to fix if we want to make Ubuntu spread. (This is being worked on by yours truly.)\n", "Q: Again \"How to get grub2 to remember last choice?\" This question was already asked once but it hasn't helped me in my trouble.\nI have Ubuntu and Windows 7 on my laptop. Usually I use Windows 7 but GRUB always boots Ubuntu by default. My /ect/default/grub contains the following lines:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=saved\nGRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true\n\nI did run sudo update-grub after I changed the values for these variables. Also I made sure that my grubenv file existed and had right permissions (with save_env GRUB command).\nAnd still... it doesn't work! GRUB alwas intends to load Ubuntu despite I choosed Windows last time.\nWhat else do I lose sight of?\nBTW, I don't have neither RAID nor LVM volumes (at least I don't have LVM manager installed).\n\nA: My situation was similar. I had a custom grub entry (using a 40_custom file in /etc/grub.d) for a Chromium OS install. I had set GRUB_DEFAULT=saved and GRUB_SETDEFAULT=true, but it never saved the entry. Turned out that I needed to manually put a \"savedefault\" line into the 40_custom file in order for that entry to save the default. Works like a champ now.\nEdit: If you put GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true, the savedefault line will be added automatically when you run update-grub\n\nA: You can use Grub Customizer for the work it's very simple, just check the box to remember last choice, install it with the commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\n\nA: Press Alt+F2\ntype\n gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub press Enter and enter your password.\nyou will see this line GRUB_DEFAULT=0\nYou can change the default from 0 to any number, corresponding to the entry in the Grub bootup menu (first entry is 0, second is 1, etc.) so if windows 7 is the 4th entry enter the value to 4\nMake your changes, press Ctrl-S to save and Ctrl-Q to exit.\nImportant: Open a terminal with Ctrl-Alt-T and type sudo update-grub to apply the changes you just made.\n", "Q: x230 tablet , realtek 8192ce connects to router but no internet The issue:\nI can ping all devices on the network except the gateway (192.168.0.1) and in turn can not access outside of the network without proxying through another device.\nThe system:\nLenovo x230 Tablet with a Realtek wifi adapter running on Quantal:\nNetwork controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

I currently have a Duel boot process with Windows 7 and 8. I wish to replace 8 with Ubuntu because 8 has been disappointing me greatly. It's taking up space that I could use for something better like, Ubuntu! I was thinking just booting 8 and installing Ubuntu from there but I wanted to make sure. Any advice on this one? I don't want Windows 7 to be deleted.\n\nA: Go to http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop and get a copy of Ubuntu. Burn it to DVD and boot from it. Give it a try, then install it. You will be given a choice as to where to (which partition) you should install and if you want to use it along side Windows. \nMake your choices and have a good time. Follow this tutorial  http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-ubuntu-with-windows and you should have no problem.\n\nA: For a better answer provide more information about how your HDD is partitioned and where are your systems installed. But for now I can say that installing ubuntu from windows 8 will put ubuntu as a third option on your select boot screen and you end up having all three OS'es (this depends on what options you chose when installing ubuntu). Then you can manually delete the files of the one you dont want, and edit grub config to display only two options.  \n\nA: I would start by labelling the different partitions for easy identification (Win_7 and Win_8).\nDownload the Ubuntu iso. Create a liveUSB with Unetbootin or simply burn a DVD.\nBoot from an Ubuntu liveDVD or liveUSB and see if hardware works (Wifi, touchpad, screen brightness control, etc).\nIf you're satisfied, click the Install Ubuntu icon. Choose the something else option. In the partition manager, delete the Win_8 partition, create a small 4GB Swap partition and partition the rest as ext4, mount point /.\nContinue with the installation.\n", "Q: \"No such file\" when running a 32-bit program on a 64-bit system I downloaded a Chromium snapshot and unzipped it, like this:\nmichael@ubuntu:/opt/chrome-linux$ ls\nchrome                  libffmpegsumo.so                nacl_irt_x86_32.nexe\nchrome.1                libppGoogleNaClPluginChrome.so  product_logo_48.png\nchrome_100_percent.pak  locales                         resources\nchrome.pak              nacl_helper                     resources.pak\nchrome_sandbox          nacl_helper_bootstrap           xdg-mime\nchrome-wrapper          nacl_irt_srpc_x86_32.nexe       xdg-settings\n\nBut when I try to run chrome, it isn't there...\nmichael@ubuntu:/opt/chrome-linux$ ./chrome\nbash: ./chrome: No such file or directory\n\nDoes anyone know why it won't open?

Install libc6:i386, i.e. the 32-bit base library package, and all the other 32-bit libraries that Chrome needs (it's likely to be close to the dependencies of the Chromium package).\nWhen you fail to execute a file that depends on a “loader”, the error you get may refer to the loader rather than the file you're executing.\n\n\n*\n\n*The loader of a dynamically-linked native executable is the part of the system that's responsible for loading dynamic libraries. It's something like /lib/ld.so or /lib/ld-linux.so.2, and should be an executable file.\n\n*The loader of a script is the program mentioned on the shebang line, e.g. /bin/sh for a script that begins with #!/bin/sh.\n\n\nThe error message is rather misleading in not indicating that the loader is the problem. Unfortunately, fixing this would be hard because the kernel interface only has room for reporting a numeric error code, not for also indicating that the error in fact concerns a different file.\nOnce you install the 32-bit dynamic loader /lib/ld-linux.so.2, which is in the libc6:i386 package, you will at least get a non-misleading error message telling you of the other missing libraries.\n\nA: The fastest way to get to Gilles' solution is to install ia32-libs-multiarch.

Do I need to install the gpu computing sdk samples to get nvcc?\n\nA: It looks like you installed nvcc but it's not in the executable path.\nThe libraries are located in /usr/local/cuda-5.0/lib and /usr/local/cuda-5.0/lib64, so the executables are probably located in /usr/local/cuda-5.0/bin. Check in that directory, to see if there is a file called nvcc. If so, add /usr/local/cuda-5.0/bin to your PATH environment variable.\nIf nvcc is not located there, search the entire /usr/local/cuda-5.0 directory. One way to do that is to run the command:\nfind /usr/local/cuda-5.0 -name nvcc\n\nOnce you find it, you can add the directory that contains it to your PATH variable, or you can make a symbolic link to it in a directory that's in your PATH, or you can invoke it by its full path name (e.g., /usr/local/cuda-5.0/someplace/nvcc).\n\nA: In my build (Ubuntu Server 13.10), nvcc ended up in /usr/lib/nvidia-cuda-toolkit (in the 'bin' directory) - adding a symlink to there from /usr/local/cuda fixed up all of my CUDA problems.\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/nvidia-cuda-toolkit /usr/local/cuda\n\nBut YMMV.\n\nA: // , Follow the instructions outlined here: \nhttp://www.r-tutor.com/gpu-computing/cuda-installation/cuda7.0-ubuntu\nNVCC is part of the CUDA Toolkit.\nI recommend installing the CUDA Toolkit directly from NVIDIA's site for such things: \nhttps://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?sid=899051\nVisit the above link, select the Linux x86 tab, and pick the .deb file for your distribution. \nLike Eliah Kagan said, you'll find it in the default installation directory for the Toolkit files. \ne.g., if you had CUDA 7.0 one would search in the /usr/local/cuda-7.0 directory: \nfind /usr/local/cuda-7.0 -name nvcc\n\nThe above command should generate output like /usr/local/cuda-7.0/bin/nvcc\nIf that doesn't work, try a more general search, like \nfind /usr/local -name nvcc\n\n...or check where that version installed itself. \nIf one installs a different version, obviously the directory where it flings its files will vary accordingly. \nAlso, make sure that the shell gets nvcc and other runnables in its executable path by adding the following in the .bashrc file of your home folder.\nexport CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-7.0 \nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CUDA_HOME}/lib64 \n\nPATH=${CUDA_HOME}/bin:${PATH} \nexport PATH \n\nThe above will allow you to run make for CUDA projects without errors about the meaninglessness of nvcc. \n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on a USB Hard Drive (not Live) Some time ago I made a question asking How to install Ubuntu on a USB external Hard Drive without losing its external storage ability. They've closed my question and sent to this one.\nToday I did the steps \"Installing Ubuntu to a removable USB drive with Virtual Box\". But When I try to use the Hard Drive as a normal USB Stick, the system doesn't recognize it. I'm using Windows, the Windows detects the drive. Although the bootable Ubuntu works fine, the windows doesn't recognize as hard drive unit. Does it really lead for what I wanted to?\n\nA: I would recommend the method suggested by Tom Brossman in the comment above. \nCreate two partitions on your drive, one for Ubuntu and the other for your Data (NTFS). You may create a third 2 to 4Gb partition for Swap if you wish (recommended).\nWhen you plug it in a Windows machine, the OS will recognise the NTFS partition and mount it normally while ignoring the ext4 partition for Ubuntu and the Swap partition if there is one.\n", "Q: Photoshop Installation in 10.10 Hi all I am new to ubuntu using ver 10.10 anyone tell me how to install the photoshop using terminal.\nI tried googling all result yields to install wine \nSo I open the ubuntu software center and type wine\nbut its display untrusted service package(While Installation).\n\nA: Wine is a free software, developed for executing Microsoft Windows applications on Linux based operating systems and OSX.

I just cant install as the installer hangs.\nI have been reading some articles but all mention boot issues and none mention the installer hanging.\nAnyone has any ideas?\n\nA: Found a solution credits go to Rod Smith https://askubuntu.com/users/57976/rod-smith\nThanks\nYour parted output suggests you've got a partition table problem, or at least an issue that libparted (which is used both by the text-mode parted program and the Ubuntu partitioner) is interpreting as a partition table problem. The \"Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character\" message suggests that parted is having problems interpreting the partition name, which is officially a UTF16-encoded name. Unfortunately, the last time I checked, parted didn't do proper UTF-16 encoding or decoding of partition names; instead, it tried to interpret them as a sort of modified ASCII -- or in practice, a modified UTF-8. This could lead to problems if a real UTF-16 partition name used non-ASCII characters, since they might then look like gibberish when interpreted as a modified UTF-8. Since libparted is very sensitive to errors and offers little in the way of corrective tools, the result is an error, as both parted and the Ubuntu installer demonstrate.\nIf I'm right (and I'm far from certain that I am), you should be able to correct the problem as follows:\nBoot into the Ubuntu (or any other Linux) rescue disk.\nIf necessary, download and install GPT fdisk (gdisk). It's available as the gdisk package in Ubuntu.\nType sudo gdisk /dev/sda to launch gdisk on your problem disk.\nType v to verify the disk's data structures. If gdisk reports any problems, it could be that parted was reacting to some problem other than the partition name, and that may need to be dealt with instead of (or at least before) proceeding with the below steps.\nType p to view your partition table. Look for any non-ASCII characters in the \"Name\" column.\nType c to change the name of any partition that has a strange name. You'll be asked for a partition number and a new name. Repeat this for as many partitions as necessary (up to all of them).\nType p to review your partition table to be sure everything looks sane.\nIf everything looks good, type w to save your changes and exit from gdisk.\n\nIf my suspicion is correct, you should now be able to proceed with Ubuntu installation. If I'm correct, this is a libparted bug, which should be reported to Ubuntu and/or to the libparted developers. Recording the names of all your partitions for inclusion in your bug report is worth doing.\n\nA: As mentioned in my comment, one thing I would try is to modify the boot parameters.  I didn't have this problem with 12.04 or 12.10, but for prior versions of Ubuntu I had to add a boot parameter of \"pci=nomsi\" to get it to find my hard drive (essentially preventing device drivers from generating a Message Singaled Interrupt).\nHere is an article that describes how to alter the boot parameters prior to installation.  Basically, you'll need to get to the advanced boot menu.  From there, pressing F6 (followed by esc to close the pop-up menu) should enable editing of the boot command.  Go all the way to the end of the line and add pci=nomsi.\nTry that and post back if it doesn't work.  If it doesn't work another thing to try would be to remove dmraid prior to installation, as mentioned in this post: Ubuntu Install Failing- Hard Drive.\n", "Q: 12.04 LTS upgrade error on libuuid1 In the process of trying to fix a problem with skype on my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS host, I managed to break libuuid1, and I have tried everything I could think of:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install libuuid1\nsudo apt-get upgrade -f\nsudo apt-get -o APT::Immediate-Configure=no upgrade\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nbut keep getting the same error which looks like a vicious circle:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n libuuid1 : Breaks: libuuid1:i386 (!= 2.20.1-1ubuntu3) but 2.20.1-5.3 is installed\n libuuid1:i386 : Breaks: libuuid1 (!= 2.20.1-5.3) but 2.20.1-1ubuntu3 is installed\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestion on how to fix this, short of reinstalling Ubuntu?\n\nA: I found this Ubuntu Forum thread helpful.

We've determined that from the comments - here's the how and why. In the meantime, just re-download it from a reliable source and check it using md5sum after download against the list of published hashes here: Ubuntu community wiki - UbuntuHashes.\nUbuntu installation media are large sets of downloads. For each file available, Ubuntu publishes SHA1, SHA256 and MD5 checksums (available on your favourite mirror, e.g. here). You can check the integrity of your copy by running the same checksum and verify it is the same as Ubuntu has published. If it matches, then both files are exactly the same1 and you're all set. In a case of a mismatch, several things could have caused it: download from an untrusted source, unreliable network connection, local file system corruption, etc.\nYours didn't match and produced a completely different string. All we know from there is that your image is different than the \"official\" ones on the Ubuntu servers. This may just be a harmless one-off, but if you downloaded it from an untrusted source, somebody may have altered it without you knowing it. Be careful in such a case.\nThis is why one should always check the integrity of the files you are running on your PC. Either an ISO or an application package. APT, the package management tool on Ubuntu, will check it for you already by verifying the integrity all the way from the developer last to touch it until it gets installed on your machine. This is done using GnuPG signatures and the keyring installed on your machine to check it against. However, for ISOs to install the operating system on, this isn't available yet, so you'll have to do it manually.\n1There's a remote possibility of hash collisions, i.e. two different files producing the same hash. However, that's very very unlikely to be as a result of a coincedence.\n\nA: Make sure you have the right OS selected in the VM settings\nI've seen similar errors with a bad iso, try re-downloading the iso\n\nA: I had also experienced this issue and I found that ISO file was corrupted.I downloaded it again and it worked.\n", "Q: Recover data from unreadable NTFS partition I have an Asus laptop with Windows and Ubuntu alongside.

This will most likely mess stuff up.\nYou need another HDD to recover the files to.\nI also recommend running fsck to check that HDD for problems. If fsck says it is ok, then at least at hardware level you are ok. Software level it is better with either the ntfs-3g tools like ntfsck and ntfsfix. To run fsck do:\nsudo fsck /dev/sda2 but be sure to boot either from the Ubuntu you have already installed (If it correctly loads up) or from a LiveCD/LiveUSB. If not, then proceed from another PC. The reason I mention is fsck is to not only verify that the HDD is ok at the hardware level (Because of so many bad sectors and the warnings you got) but also to know that, if fsck can read it, it means you can actually save the information in it.\nJust in case, here are 2 good links to recovery information:  \nFsck vs Chkdsk \nTools to Diagnose\n\nA: I would use a liveUSB or liveDVD, install testdisk and try to recover data from testdisk.\n", "Q: PHP not properly configured I just installed php.5.1.2 on ubuntu server. \nI tried to run simple test:\n<? phpinfo() ?>\n\nit displayed the information but, also display the html tags:\n</table><br />\n<h2>PHP License</h2>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" width=\"600\">\n<tr class=\"v\"><td>\n<p>\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the PHP License as published by the PHP Group and included in the distribution in the file:  LICENSE\n</p>\n<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n</p>\n<p>If you did not receive a copy of the PHP license, or have any questions about PHP licensing, please contact license@php.net.\n</p>\n</td></tr>\n</table><br />\n</div></body></html>\n\nI compiled from source.

A few steps into the installation, there is a screen showing my hard drive, with sda1, sda2 and sda3 partitions. But when I click to install with one of them, it cannot find the root file. How can I get past this and install successfully?\n\nA: It will take you to the advanced partitioner if you select \"Do Something Else\".  You have to specify one of the partitions, tell it to use ext4, to format it, and that it is to be used as root.  This will remove any and all data on the partition.\nIf you select \"install alongside\" then it will make room on the hard drive to install Ubuntu to by resizing a partition automatically.  Some people like to have more control over how Ubuntu gets installed, hence the advanced partitioner.\nI suggest you make backups of any important data before proceeding, as if you make a mistake at this point you could stand to lose a great deal of data.

Note that removing a package leaves its configuration files on the system. If a plus sign is appended to the package name (with no intervening space), the identified package will be installed instead of removed.\npurge - purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and purged (any configuration files are deleted too).\n\nThis of course, does not apply to packages that hold configuration files inside the user's home folder (e.g. /home/Ubuntu_User), these files will not be touched ( Why does \"Purge\" not remove everything related to an app? )\nSo for example, if you were to purge Chrome, Firefox, Kodi, or any other that holds some configuration files inside your /home folder, these configuration files will stay there.\nOn the other hand, if you were to install Apache, squid, MySQL, or any other services similar that save their configuration files in /etc, these configuration files will be deleted if you use purge.\n\nA: apt-get purge removes configuration files, while apt-get remove does not.\n", "Q: How do I download and install packages without an internet connection?

I installed Ubuntu on my netbook quite some time ago, and I don't remember what did I do - but I'd expect I went with more or less default settings.  Now I have two partitions (one ext3 and one ext4, the first one being bigger and practically unused, apart from an empty lost+found directory).  What (apart from my stupidity, which might be the cause - e.g., it's not impossible that I wanted it to be my /home and somehow forgot to actually tell the installer to do so) might be the cause of such a strange situation?  If this partition is not really necessary (which is probably the case - it is not being mounted by default anyway), what is the best way to move my /home there?  I imagine that this should suffice:\n\n\n*\n\n*I mount that partition under /mnt or anywhere and cp -rp /home/* there.\n\n*I use gparted to make it my new /home.\n\n*I boot to check whether everything works.\n\n*I manually unmount it to manually clean the old /home.\n\n\nDid I miss something?\nEdit: as Eric Carvalho asked, here's my output of fdisk -l:\n$ LANGUAGE=C sudo fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 250.1 GB, 250059350016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 30401 cylinders, total 488397168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x05c9ff3a\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048      409599      203776    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2          417690   285075455   142328883    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3       285075456   323862527    19393536    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda4       323864574   488396799    82266113    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5       323864576   328058879     2097152   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda6       328060928   449107698    60523385+  83  Linux\n/dev/sda7       449107968   486324223    18608128   83  Linux\n/dev/sda8       486326272   488396799     1035264   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nand df -h (which I guess is more or less irrelevant, since the partition is unmounted by default):\n$ LANGUAGE=C df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda7        18G   16G  1,1G  94% /\nudev            488M   12K  488M   1% /dev\ntmpfs           198M  876K  198M   1% /run\nnone            5,0M     0  5,0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            495M  224K  495M   1% /run/shm\n\n\nA: /dev/sda7 is your 18GB / partition and /dev/sda6 is a 58GB partition you said is empty.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set a password for \"root\" account: open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) an run sudo passwd root, then type a password for \"root\".\n\n*Reboot the computer.

Add the following to the end: UUID=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee /home ext4 defaults 0 2. Replace the UUID with the one you got in step 5.\n\n*Unmount the new home: umount /tmp/home.\n\n*Mount the new home in the correct location: mount /home.\n\n*Logout from text console (exit), return to graphics console (Ctrl+Alt+F7 or F8) and login with your account. \n\n*Lock the root account: open a terminal and run sudo passwd -l root.\nDone.\n\nA: As you can't unmount your home while logged in, the easiest option in my opinion is to boot from a live CD and do something similar to the following:\nMount the new home partition (I will assume in /mnt/new for the rest of the answer) and the root partition (where is the old home) (in /mnt/old).\nsudo mkdir /mnt/new\nsudo mkdir /mnt/old\nsudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sda7 /mnt/old\nsudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sda6 /mnt/new\n\nWith both mounted, you can move from old to new: \nsudo mv /mnt/old/home /mnt/new\n\nCreate an empty home (mount point) on root disk:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/old/home\n\nEdit /etc/fstab on our root partition to include the new home partition:\nsudo nano /mnt/old/etc/fstab\n\ninclude:\n/dev/sda6 /home ext3 defaults 0 2\n\nObs: check if your sda6 partition is ext3 if you are not sure (I used ext3 based on the text in your question).\nRemove the CD and reboot.\nIt should work!\nA few improvements I suggest:\nWhile you are at it, you have 2 swap partitions and I don't think this is very usefull so you could remove one... (gparted can do that - you have to disable swap and remove the partition and enable swap again - check after in fstab if it is correct).\nIf you have a chance to include new disks in the future (I always consider there is a chance), I think it would be safer to use UUID=uuid_of_the_partition instead of /dev/sda6 in fstab:\nUUID=uuid-of-your-sda6 /home ext3 defaults 0 2\n\nUUIDs don't change, even if the disk is moved to another port on the interface so you'll always mount the correct disk. Using /sda, if you include a disk and change the position of the actual disk in the interface, you have a fair chance to change its name to sdb for example and your home won't mount (very common when using USB external disks for example).\nTo find the uuid of the partitions, while booted on your normal way (without live CD) you can issue ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid and you'll see uuids as symlinks to the actual devices. Another way if you prefer is to use gparted and look at the info of the partition.\n\nA: *\n\n*Your copy command does not copy special files. cpio is a little better. I used that when I moved my home from one computer to the next. Some use rsync instead: see this embrace ubuntu blog. \ncd /home/\nfind . -depth -print0 | cpio --null --sparse -pvd /mnt/\n\n\n*You cannot unmount /home if you are logged in (your step 4). You must do it in recovery mode if you don't follow the procedure described at help ubuntu.\n", "Q: Install .deb files without any Internet I want to install ndiskgtk and whenever I click the .deb file, it gets me through the Software Center.

What is the easiest way for me to alleviate this problem?\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: The number of inodes is set at the time the partition is formatted. Normally the number of inodes created is sufficient for almost any purpose; however, if you have a great number of very small files then you can use up the inodes before the disk is full.\nYou need to find the many thousands of small files you have on the system that are using up inodes and either delete them, or move them to a partition that has been specifically set up with a very large number of inodes available. It is not possible to change the number of inodes available on a partition after it has been formatted.\nThe script written by paxdiablo on stackoverflow might be handy way to check for excessive small file use that you may not be aware of. Here it is again:\n#!/bin/bash\n# count_em - count files in all subdirectories under current directory.\necho 'echo $(ls -a \"$1\" | wc -l) $1' >/tmp/count_em_$$\nchmod 700 /tmp/count_em_$$\nfind . -mount -type d -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 /tmp/count_em_$$ | sort -n\nrm -f /tmp/count_em_$$\n\nPut this script in the text file ~/bin/count_em  and then issue the command\nchmod +x ~/bin/count_em\n\nto make it executable. If you had to make the directory ~/bin then it won't be in the executable path yet, so just log out and back in again.\nTo run the program you just type\ncount_em\n\nand it will list the numbers of all files in the current directory and subdirectories by directory, with the highest count last. Very handy!\n\nA: I found that the inode usage was coming from /root/.local, and deleted that folder.\n\nA: You can also display a sorted list of directories by number of inodes, using this command: du --inodes -d 3 / | sort -n | tail\nFrom there, you can determine which directories to delete\n", "Q: Installing dotnet 2.0 on 64 bit machine I have a speed-reading program I purchased with uses dotnet2.

I'm trying to use an HDMI cable to connect my HP dv5 notebook to a 32\" Sony Bravia TV in order to watch Hulu stuff on a bigger screen. However, Google has been thoroughly unhelpful thus far!\nWhen I hook the computer up to the TV using the Windows partition, it automatically switches the display settings so that the sound and video on the TV are synced up with what's on the laptop screen. In the Ubuntu partition, I think that it's detecting the tv as another monitor rather than as a TV so I get a dual monitor display, which I don't want! Plus, the sound is coming out of the laptop rather than out of the TV.\nI don't know if the laptop's Intel driver is enabled for TV in the Ubuntu partition (I don't think it's an Nvidia driver, but I don't know how to check it), and I don't know how to manually change the settings to optimize tv display. \nEDIT: I think this is the relevant information from the lspci command:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 07)\n\n00:02.1 Display controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 07)\n\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 03)\n\nDoesn't seem like I have an Nvidia chip. I figured that I didn't since the terminal didn't recognize commands pertaining to it.\nMy ultimate goal is to mirror the laptop output on the TV screen-- is this doable?\n\nA: I have an Asus Zenbook Prime with an Intel HD integrated GPU. My machine has the same issues with video and sound settings not automatically switching when I plug in a TV over HDMI. \nTo resolve the video I can either press the external monitor hotkey (FN+F8) to cycle between Laptop only, TV only, Mirrored, and Extended desktop modes. Your laptop may not have this function button so you can also launch the Displays control panel either directly or from the System Settings application. This should identify both of your displays, which you can turn on and off independently or check the Enable Mirroring box to simply mirror you laptop display.\nSound over HDMI can be tricky. An HDMI output device may appear in the Sound control panel in System Settings, but on my machine this doesn't happen. To resolve this, I use PulseAudio Volume Control. You can find this by searching for it in the Ubuntu Software Center. To use it, launch the app and click on the Configuration Tab. There should be a drop-down menu for your sound card labeled Profile, select Digitl Stereo(HDMI) Output from this menu. \nOnce this is done, the Sound control panel should show both the built-in speakers and the HDMI output and you should be able to switch between them as often as you want from there while you are plugged in to the HDMI output. On my laptop it also doesn't automatically switch back to the speakers, you may need to manually select them in the Sound control panel to go back to analog sound output.\n\nA: I had the same problem, mine's was result by opening the dash and write it down: sound, open it and in output tab, appear HDDMI / Display Port I select it and wuala it works for me. My computer is a Asus k52f.\n \nTHEN... it appears \n\nClick on  HDDMI / Display Port and the tv sound should work fine, I saw The dark night rises yesterday using HDMI port!\n\nA: The issue for me was that my laptop and the TV could not simultaneously have their screens on. I had to turn the laptop screen off in order to configure the resolution I wanted for the TV, otherwise I could only mirror my laptops' resolution onto the TV. Same story with using a projector.\nFor the sound, in sound settings you need to change the sound output from analog to HDMI Audio.\nIn windows, the option only pops up after you've connected via HDMI -- but in Ubuntu you can do so any time you wish, you just won't hear anything if you aren't connected to an alternate sound source through HDMI.\n", "Q: Windows not loading from either grub or burg?

Now I gotta get rid of \"Windows 8\" from the boot entry and I'm done. \n", "Q: How \"Install along side Windows\" option works I have created an unallocated space of 10gb on my HDD through Windows.\nI want to know how does the option \"Install along side with Windows\" of Ubuntu 12.10 work?\nWill it use the unallocated space or will it ignore it and try to create a new partition, taking space \"randomly\" from the drive?\nRegards\n\nA: Based on this link it is safe to assume that, rather than relying on ubuntu for the installation, you should shrink/resize your partitions (manually) than allowing ubuntu to handle the partitions for you.\nUnderstand that the risks involved in relying on ubuntu for creating partition for you.\nIf I were in your place I would never go for install alongside windows option, and create and choose the partition by myself.\nBTW I had used that option of installing alongside windows, but I had already shrinked my partitions in windows, ubuntu was installed in the free space created by shrinking the partitions.\n\nA: If you select \"install alongside\" the Ubiquity installer does not just simply go ahead and start re-arranging your drive.  You get a selection window in the next screen where you can nominate how much of the disk you want Ubuntu to use. The screen will look something like this:\n\nI'd expect it will default to the unused space, however 10GB is a little small so it might want to take a bit more.  The OS will install on less than 4GB OK, but will need space for data, downloaded updates, and whatever data you want to put on this partition.\n\nA: If your Windows is installed in your C drive \"Install Ubuntu along side with Windows\" will install Ubuntu also in your C drive.Basically it will replace Windows MBR bootloader with GRUB/GRUB2 boot loader.\nIf you want to Install Ubuntu in the 10gb unallocated place you will have to click on the option \"Something else\".\nThis \"link\" will give you step by step instructions.You could also \"look\" into this guide.Hope it helps you! :)\n", "Q: Can't mount 2nd HD SFS I'm trying to mount a 1TB Western digital hd that was appearing fine yesterday before I reinstalled ubuntu 12.04. I  used to have a dual boot windows 7/ubuntu 12.04, and my 1TB drive would show up fine from either OS. Today, I wiped my boot drive in order to use it all for Ubuntu 12.04, i.e., remove windows 7, and now I'm trying to mount the 1TB drive to /media on my new installation without much success.\nHere is the fdisk output for the device I'm trying to mount:\nDisk /dev/sdb: 1000.2 GB, 1000204886016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 121601 cylinders, total 1953525168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x6f25ce66\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *          63  1953523119   976761528+  42  SFS\n\nI tried running sudo mount /dev/sdb /media, I get:\nmount: you must specify the filesystem type\nIf I try to run sudo mount -t sfs /dev/sdb /media, I get:\nmount: unkown filesystem type 'sfs'\nI also tried mounting as ntfs, ntfs-3g, and a few other types, but of course it says 'device doesn't seem to have a valid ntfs' etc.\nHow can I mount this HD?\n\nA: Ok I know this was a while back but for some reason no one has made this information easily available so here is the answer:\nIt's very very simple. \nRun sudo apt-get install ldmtool then make sure your drive is actually there by checking with sudo fdisk -l and once you have ldmtool downloaded, try to see if the harddrive is recognized by running sudo ldmtool scan.

There was a discussion in summer that Ubuntu does not support retina displays - everything on the screen is too small. Even adjusting DPI does not help, since such an adjusting scales only fonts, bit not images.\nIs Ubuntu 12.10 already optimized for retina displays. if not is it planned for Ubuntu 13.04?\n\nA: Agreed, as of 1st Jan 2013 (might be outdated by the time you read this answer, additional info suggestions welcome via comments), there are several good guides (1, 2) addressing a \"yay-i-got-it-working\" install, but you'll end up with a frankly unusable system where everything is tiny.\nSo I don't have any answer, but I'm compiling a few facts for anyone with the same question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Window Manager / Desktop Environment:\n\n*\n\n*Reports (1, 2) indicate that GNOME Shell (and KDE) currently manage High-DPI better than Unity 12.10. You'll suffer from tiny icons in applications, but Shell itself will correctly scale.\n\n*Discussions happened on summer 2012 in this gnome-devel-list thread, but to sum up: nothing happens because developers have no test hardware; if you want progress done, buy them a MBP Retina.\n\n*A similar thread was brought up on the unity-design mailing list, but did not go much further.\n\n\n*GTK: Bugzilla has Bug 546711, which hasn't seen lots of activity recently. Summary: a patch was proposed years ago but wasn't satisfying. Properly fixing the bug requires more work, probably down to the X level.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 is quite well adaptable, \n\n\n*\n\n*see Adapt Ubuntu to a high-DPI resolution screen\n\n*and Adjust Firefox and Thunderbird to a High DPI touchscreen display (retina)\nOnly some java programs don't scale up, but that will come, I guess\n\nA: Gnome Shell scales pretty good on both low and high resolution screens. Furthermore you can do some fine adjustment changing the fontscale in tweak tool - I set mine to 0,9 on a 1280x800 Thinkpad-Screen - when I was testing Ubuntu 12.04 with Gnome Shell on a MBP about a year ago 1,1 or 1,2 worked fine and looked pretty good. \n", "Q: dual booting Ubuntu 12.04 and windows 7 (partitioning scheme) I would like to ask for help on dual booting because it's my first time to try dual booting and a novice on Ubuntu or any Linux distribution.\nI have 2 partitions on my hard disk:\nWindows 7\nC:\\ Windows 7 (pre-existing installation)\nD:\\ Files (Already exists and has files already)\nPlease help me on the partitioning part.\nCan I shrink any of the 2 partitions I have?\nI know that there should only be 4 primary partitions on 1 hard disk.\nThen how would i be setting the root,swap,and /home. Would that mean I will end up with 5 partitions when only 4 partitions are allowed.\nI'm really confused. Please bear with me.\n\nA: It's been a long time since I've done it on my own system, so bear with me. Back up your system first! Also, I'm not super tech-savvy, so if anyone else has suggestions for improvements, go ahead and jump in. I know that I didn't do it in the most optimal way when I partitioned everything...\nFirst, read this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DiskSpace\nThe way that I set up my drive, I wanted a shared partition between Windows and Ubuntu for storing all of my files so that I can access them from either partition.\nIf you want to set it up with the shared partition, I would suggest moving all your files into external storage for now, so that you can shrink down your Windows partition. (I didn't do this and now my Windows partition is much too large-- I'm going to have to do some juggling to reallocate space...).\nI used the Wubi ISO burned to a disc to run the installation. You'll need to change the boot options so that your computer boots from the disc, since you'll use the gParted tool to do the re-partitioning.\nIn order to have more than 4 primary partitions, you'll need an extended partition. Figure out how much space you want to give to Windows-- if I'd been smart and moved all my files, I would've given it about 75Gb. But that's entirely up to you. I've heard people give it as little as 30Gb, but I don't know how well the system runs with a partition that small... The recovery partition is 4Gb. Everything else will be allocated to Ubuntu.\n**Note: I have a 300Gb hard drive on a Windows 7 64-bit system.\n/dev/sda1 is the Windows partition. /dev/sda2 is the recovery partition. Shrink down sda1 to the size that you want.\nCreate an extended partition, /dev/sda3. The first partition within the extended partition will be your swap partition-- I gave it about 10Gb. Next is root, which is ext4 format; I gave it 15Gb. I put the shared partition (ntfs format) next; the path for this one was /mnt/Shared (the size of this one will depend on how much space you allocate to everything else). The last partition is the Ubuntu partition, /home-- I think I gave this one too much space as well (50Gb?)\nThis article has great information, and I wish I'd read it before I did my own system. I suggest you read it as well: \nhttp://lifehacker.com/5403100/dual+boot-windows-7-and-ubuntu-in-perfect-harmony\n\nA: OK, first of all, get rid of the idea of C:\\ and D:\\ partitions. Ubuntu doesn't think that way. Ubuntu thinks in terms of sda1, sda2, etc.\nYou can use a program like Gparted to make extra partitions and modify your existing ones.\nAlso, it would be helpful to see how gparted analyzes your system.\n\nA: The easyest way to do it, just shrink a partition that you would like, i use \"Easus Partition Manager\", leave the space that you would like to install Ubuntu on as unalocated space. Then go install ubuntu as you would normaly do, when it prompts you how to install it just chose \"Alongside Windows\" and Ubuntu will know to use that unalocated space automaticaly for it, and it will make his partitions the way it needs it, so you don't have to worry about that.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot ubuntu live cd or gparted live cd.(I reffering the partitions by D and E according to yours.Ubuntu doesn't recognize the partitions like this.So please note the size of partitions through which you can easily find which one is E or D partitions)\n\n*Open gparted then right-click on the D partition and click on Resize/Move option to shrink the size of D by how much space did you want to allocate for Ubuntu partitions(/root,/home) aswell as swap partition.\n\n*After shrinking,an unallocated space was created just below to the D partition.\n\n*Create an Extended partition from that unallocated space.Now you can create any number of partitions(/root,/home,/boot,swap) inside extended partition.And install Ubuntu on it.\n\n*Ubuntu can be installed on primary as well as logical partition.\n\nA: [Sorry I cannot use formatting; I am on mobile site now.]\nAnswers to your comments: \nIf you make an extended partition, and / /home etc. partition will be logical, but it wont matter to ubuntu. And yes there will be total of more than 4 partitions. In fact that is why concept of extended partition came up - as a workaround to hsve more than 4 partitions.\nYou don't need to mess with MBR thing.\nIn addition to the above answer, you can also use use windows built-in disk management feature to shrink the drives.\nGo to control panel and search computer management, then you'll find something like disk management. Click that (I guess it will require administrative permissions).\nYes, you can shrink both the drives with all of your data remain as it is, but it is always advised to make a backup of important data before doing anything like this.\nIn that, choose the partition (from which you want to extract free space as a separate partition). Right click it and choose 'shrink drive'. You'll get another dialogue box that will show you much space you can use in the new partion.\nAfter that, you can leave the new partition as unallocated or can format it, but please note that windows will format it in ntfs (or FAT) whereas (what I have observed yet - though I may be wrong here) Ubuntu will require ext3 or ext4 file system.\nNow, to install Ubuntu, you will require at least two partitions, one for swap-memory and the other where you will install ubuntu. And it is advised to keep the size of swap 1.5 to 2 times your RAM, I suggest you to make another partition of appropriate size with windows only.\nIn short you will require two partitions - 1. Swap - about 1.5 - 2 times you RAM and 2. Partition to install Ubuntu.\nPlease note that GParted is an excellent partitioning tool but I am telling you so, just to let you know that there is something you may feel yourself comfortable with, in windows itself.\n", "Q: Computer hangs when trying to start Software Center Every time  I want to open Software Center to install something, my computer hangs before it starts.

I setup LXC using:\nlxc-create -t ubuntu -n lxcguest1\n\nBut I can't access any services running on it from my LAN, it appears to be NATed.  How do I set it up so that I can access it (it probably needs to get it's dhcp address from my Linksys router)?\nThanks.\n\nA: I've just dealt with this issue myself. Basically you need to setup a bridge and bind your network card and container to it. Here is the article I followed:\nhttp://bj0z.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/howto-build-a-base-lxc-container-in-ubuntu-11-04/\nSounds as if like me, you require the 'bridge' solution rather than the NAT solution.\nI also turned off the default LXC bridge setup (which is NAT'ed). To do this just edit the file: /etc/default/lxc and change USE_LXC_BRIDGE=\"TRUE\" to USE_LXC_BRIDGE=\"FALSE\" and reboot.\n\nA: My setup on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (Trusty Tahr) hosts\nAdd to /etc/network/interfaces on the host\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 0.0.0.0\n\nauto br0\niface br0 inet dhcp\n    bridge_ports eth0\n\n(reboot after changes)\nAnd on the container config files (/var/lib/lxc/containername/config) I set lxc.network.link = br0\nWith this the container will get public ip addresses from the dhcp server just like the host.\n\nA: I used the default Ubuntu LXC settings, and configured my router to send all traffic on 10.0.3.xxx to the Ubuntu machine. On a DD-WRT enabled router, the settings look something like the screenshot below. Replace 192.168.1.137 with the IP of the machine running LXC. Other routers should have similar options to set up a static route (here are static route instructions for Linksys, for example).\n\nThis is unrelated, but I also used the DNSMasq service to point a hostname to the LXC container's IP address. This way I can access the container at http://gitlab/ anywhere on the network. In my opinion it's a lot easier to use a hostname to access a container than remember the IP address.\n\n", "Q: \"cannot access archive: No such file or directory\" when installing a package using dpkg I have download the QQ2012's deb in downlaod files, but when I install the deb, system tell me:\n$ sudo dpkg -i wineqq2012-20120719-longene.deb\n[sudo] password for collins: \ndpkg: error processing wineqq2012-20120719-longene.deb (--install):\n cannot access archive: No such file or directory\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n wineqq2012-20120719-longene.deb\n\n\nA: The error message No such file or directory means that the .deb file does not exist, or does not exist in the current directory.\nThe ~ between : and $ in the prompt represents the current working directory. ~ (when the next character is a / or, as in this case, nothing at all) is shorthand for your home directory, /home/collins.\nYou said you downloaded the .deb file \"in download files.\" Assuming this means you downloaded it to your Downloads folder, that means it's located in /home/collins/Downloads rather than /home/collins.\nSo you should be able to install it by running this command:\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/wineqq2012-20120719-longene.deb\n\nIf that doesn't work, try typing\nsudo dpkg -i\n\nwithout pressing Enter.

You need to boot to command line with internet access and do the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThere's more information here.\nAnother solution suggested in the answers to that question is to install a cheap but more modern graphics card that will work. \nA solution that suggests itself in the case that both of these are not feasible is to revert to an older Ubuntu release where the support for the 865 chipset was still given priority.  Unfortunately this would be 10.04 LTS but Canonical support runs out for the desktop release in April next year (four months away).  Still, if you can justify having an unsupported but stable release after this time then it might be the best option for an older machine.  You should download 10.04.4 from one of the mirrors and get it fully updated before April.\n", "Q: Can't boot Ubuntu 12.10 from USB key on Dell Inspiron 15R 5520 (2012 model) I'm new in the Linux community and thus, I wanted to try Ubuntu 12.10 by using a USB flash drive boot (used with LiLi Creator). I installed the ISO file using LiLi Creator on the USB key, but when rebooted my system, the usb drive didn't show up on the boot menu (F12), the usb key is just not there. I use Windows 8 Single Language and the system BIOS has two options UEFI and Legacy but those settings didn't help me booting from USB drive. The USB Emulation is enabled FYI, one last thing: I don't know more settings and Dell Community also dosen't have particular answer, please help me.\nMy config:\nDell Inspiron 15R 5520 Laptop (2012)\nIntel Core i5 3rd gen @ 2.5GHz\n4GB RAM\nIntel HD 4000 graphics,\nWindows 8 Single Language 64bit\nAward BIOS A11 (I think I updated it to A11)\nTranscend JetFlash 2GB for installing Ubuntu 12.10 with LiLi Creator\nThanks in advance :)\nRutul\n\nA: I also have a Dell Inspiron 15R (5520). When installed Ubuntu and Linux Mint from a USB drive by using Startup Disk Creator. Disable Secure Boot, change your settings to Legacy, then reboot with the USB image on your USB drive. Push the F+12 key for the boot menu and you should see your USB drive - highlight this and touch Enter and you should then be booting from the USB drive. This worked for me after much experimentation with different options. Hope this helps --\n\nA: If your drive didn't showed up on BIOS boot menu, that is probably faulty USB drive or faulty USB port.\n", "Q: Can I verbose output during a copy command processing? Situation: If I entered a copy command like cp -rf /src/ /dsc/ then I am waiting several minutes for copy large directories. I forgot to put -v flag to verbose an output, Can I do it during copying?\n\nA: I propose :\nwatch du -sh /dsc/\n\n\nA: No you can't, but you could use the watch command to look at the destination directory to see how the process is progressing, eg.\nwatch ls -l /dsc/\n\n\nA: You could always use rsync instead, you'll atleast get to see the files that are being copied\nrsync -rva /src/ /dst/\n\nOf-course this only works before you start copying as an alternative to cp. The good news is though that rsync will only copy the files it needs to so you can kill your long-running cp command run the rsync command and it will pick up where cp left off.\n\nA: This question seems to be old, but for the cp command you've got the --verbose option. \nSo the command works as follows:\ncp --verbose -rf /src/ /dsc/\n\n\nA: I recommend to use Midnight Commander in case when you need to see a progress of files copying.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Midnight commander:\napt-get install mc\n\n\n*Open it:\nmc\n\n\n*On first panel open source, on second - destination. Start copying using \"F5\". \nMC will display nice and informative progress dialog. \n", "Q: Program for context indexed search in desktop Is there any app similar to Google Desktop?

I am a newbie in linux and I don't know how to open the Ubuntu Software Center via Terminal!!\nPlease help\n\nA: I'm not sure why you'd want to, but \nsoftware-center\n\nshould do it.  If you want to use command line to install a package then the correct way to do it would be\nsudo apt-get install package-name\n\nor \nsudo apt-get remove package-name\n\nto remove it.

In desktop Ubuntu 21.04, it is still possible to install Ubuntu Software Center. Since that is the program specified by the original question, the answer is that you run it from the command line, first by installing it via:\nsudo apt install gnome-software\n\nand then by running it via the following command, with or without sudo:\ngnome-software\n\nYou can also run it by using Show Applications → Software icon (white suitcase with aqua circle).\nSince Ubuntu Software Center is no longer installed by default, this question (if asked today) would refer, instead, to the Snap Store. If it was not present, it would reportedly be installed via:\nsudo snap install snap-store\n\nIn that case, the answer is that you run it via\nsnap-store\n\nOr you could click on the suitcase icon, in this case an orange one bearing the letter A (short for \"Snap\" in Latin, perhaps), whose tool tip says (of course) \"Ubuntu Software\".\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 very slow boot up I don't know why but when I power up my system Ubuntu starts very slow and after waiting for 15 minutes it only gives me the terminal..
