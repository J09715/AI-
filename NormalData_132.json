On the SSD is the OS and my initial thought was to put the two HDD in RAID 1 for user data.\nAfter some more thought I came up with two other setups and now I'm in doubt :) Can someone advise what would be the best setup?\n1: single SSD and HDD in RAID 1 (original thought)\n2: Create 2 partitions on the HDD (128GB and 872GB). Put the two 872GB in RAID 1 and create another RAID 1 with the SSD and one 128GB HDD partition.\n3: Create 2 partitions on the HDD (750/250), put the 705GB in RAID 1 and use the 2 250GB as backup and make automatic snapshots of the SSD to (one of) these partitions.\nI think the 2 main questions are: \nIs it advisable to create a raid array with only part of a drive and actively use the other part of that drive or should you always use the full disk?\nIs it advisable to create a raid 1 array with a SSD and HDD or will that blow the whole speed advantage of the SSD?\n\nA: I would like to add a different recommendation to the pool of possible solutions. I would recommend you to base your setup on btrfs' subvolume and snapshot abilities in combination with a btrbk cronjob.\nSetting this up is not necessarily trivial but largely depends on your skill set and previous experience. There is a lot of literature on the net that will help you. In the end you are rewarded with a very flexible and fast way to backup your SSD regularly with a lot of options to create a solution perfect for your needs.\nNote of caution: Any form of raid can and should never replace regular backups. (Luckily btrbk can easily be extended to external drives or ssh reachable host, see its manual)\nGeneral setup\nThe general ideas of my proposal is to use the SSD as your btrfs system drive that contains your root and related subvolumes and the two HDDs in a btrfs raid1 as your data and backup drive.\nTogether with btrbk this will allow you to perform automated incremental backups of your system SSD to your backup HDDs. And since the HDDs are set up as a mirror, all your backup will be kept mirrored as well.\nFurthermore btrfs ability to send and receive subvolumes (which is what btrbk utilizes to make backups) allow you to freely move your data and backups between your system and data drive. This will allow you to change what data is stored on the fast SSD, while always maintaining versioned and mirrored backups of all your data.\nSetup btrfs\nTo get started you will either need to reinstall Ubuntu onto the SSD and selecting btrfs as your root file system or to convert your existing installations file system to btrfs. Both ways are described on the Ubuntu's community help page about btrfs, which is a good read in general, if you are just getting start with btrfs on Ubuntu.\nNext you need to turn the HDDs into a btrfs raid1, with the following command, where /dev/sdx and /dev/sdy are the two drives (All data on these drives will be lost!):\nmkfs.btrfs -d raid1 /dev/sdx /dev/sdy\n\nIf you are new to snapshots or btrfs, I would recommend the this moment to familiarize yourself with the difference between folders, subvolumes and snapshots and try out some of the commands, before any actual data is written to your raid1.\nThere are many ways you can organize your data and you can find some examples in the btrfs kernel wiki's sysadmin guide.\nOne way to do it is to mount your btrfs root (subvolid 0 or 5) somewhere and use that to manage your subvolumes and snapshot and furthermore store all of the data in appropriate subvolumes, which you mount to convenient locations in your file system. That way you can snapshot, move, recover and replace any data at will.\nFor your concrete example, that could mean the following (all command should be run as root/with sudo):\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount your system btrfs root (subvolid=0) to /btrfs/system\n\n*Mount your data btrfs raid1 root (subvolid=0) to /btrfs/data\nInstead of mounting these volumes by hand, add them to your fstab (/etc/fstab) before mounting, so they are mounted at boot as well. I would recommend to mount them by their UUID, which you can retrieve by running sudo btrfs filesystem show. \nUUID=<UUID of system> /btrfs/system btrfs defaults,subvolid=0 0 0\nUUID=<UUID of data> /btrfs/data btrfs defaults,subvolid=0 0 0\n\nNow mount them with:\nsudo mkdir /btrfs\nsudo mkdir /btrfs/data\nsudo mount /btrfs/data\nsudo mkdir /btrfs/system\nsudo mount /btrfs/system\n\nNow you can any additional subvolumes you might want to each of the btrfs filesystems.\nUbuntu normally creates a subvolume for your root / (subvol=@) and home directory /home (subvol=@home) by default. It is common to turn /var or /tmp into their own subvolumes or to create application specific subvolumes, e.g. for /var/www/.\nPersonally I prefer to keep all my subvolumes at the btrfs root and them mount them to their specific locations using mount and fstab entries.\nFor example, to create a subvolume for your music collection on the HDD raid1, I would do the following:\nbtrfs subvolume create /btrfs/data/@music\n\nI would then mount it with the following fstab entry to /music:\nUUID=<UUID of data> /music btrfs defaults,subvol=@music 0 0\n\nSetup of btrbk\nSecondly, you will have to set up btrbk for the subvolumes you want to snapshot and backup onto the HDD raid.\nAs a simple example on how to backup @ and @home regularly and keeping regular spaced history of your backup you could write the following to /etc/btrbk.conf:\n# The long timestamp recommended for more then one snapshot a day\ntimestamp_format        long\n\n# Set time spacing of snapshots kept on SSD\nsnapshot_preserve_min      2d\nsnapshot_preserve          7d 4w 3m\n\n# Set time spacing of snapshots kept on HDD raid\ntarget_preserve_min        no\ntarget_preserve            8w *m\n\nsnapshot_dir               /btrfs/system/snapshots\n\nvolume /btrfs/system\n  subvolume @\n    target send-receive /btrfs/data/backup/\n\n  subvolume @home\n    target send-receive /btrfs/data/backup/\n\nPlease read the btrbk documentation for any of the details. It will also explain how to recover your data from a snapshot.\nLastly you will have to add btrbk to your crontab with sudo crontab -e. E.g. to run your btrbk snapshots and backup every day at noon, add the following line:\n0 12 * * * /path/of/btrbk run\n\nOther considerations\nSwap\nWhile in general there is less and less need for swap space in modern personal computer systems that have at least 8 GB of RAM, there are still use cases where it can help you out, especially when located on a SSD, where the performance hit of swapping is not as noticeable. It is therefore still generally recommended to set up a swap file or partition.\nThat being said, btrfs does not support swap files. That means, you will have to allocate some of your SSD space into a separate swap partition if you want to be able to use swap on your system at all.\nbtrfs SSD detection\nBtrfs automatically detects if a file system mounted is located on a SSD and enables wear-leveling in that case.   \nThis however is not necessary anymore, as modern SSDs automatically wear-level themselves, while at the same time causing issues with the fragmentation of free space. I would therefore personally advice you to mount your SSD with the nossd option.\nMore details can be found in the btrfs kernel wiki.\nFile system compression\nBtrfs supports transparent file compression. By adding the compress option to your mount flags, it will be enable for all new files written.\nFor example, to enable compression for the @music subvolume I used as an example earlier, I would change my fstab entry to:\nUUID=<UUID of data> /music btrfs defaults,compress,subvol=@music 0 0\n\nTo apply this change, do not forget to remount (unmount and mount again) the effected subvolume. \nWith most recent computers the overhead of compressing files before it is being writing and after it has been read is often negligible. Writing a large but well compressible file to a slow disk might even be faster with compression enabled.\nIf you are worried about speed, you can also use the faster but less efficient LZO compression with compress=lzo.\nMore details once again can be found in the btrfs kernel wiki.\nLocation of home folder\nUbuntu puts your home folder into the @home subvolume on the system drive by default. If you move home to your HDD mirror is up to your personal preferences. You can also keep it on the SSD and include it into your btrbk backup as I showed above.\nTime spacing of backups\nWhile my example set the same retention times for all subvolumes, btrbk allows you to set this time for each of them individually.\nYou could also run btrbk with different configs (see -c option) at different intervals to gain even more control over when what subvolume is snapshotted amd/or backuped.\nAs snapshots are quickly created, thanks to btrfs copy-on-write nature, you could even get btrbk to create a snapshot each hour, but only transfer them to the backup disk once a day, for folders that are changed often, like your home folder.\nDetecting bit rot\nTo make use of btrfs bit rot/data corruption detection (and automatic repair in case of your raid1), you should make sure to run a btrfs scrub at regular intervals, e.g. as a cron job, with:\nbtrfs scrub start /btrfs/system\nbtrfs scrub start /btrfs/data\n\n\nA: The first option is not completely stupid. \"Hybrid RAID1\" does work if configured properly. I have ran this setup myself until my SSD started acting weird and moved out of the box.\nSee these articles for guidance:\nhttp://tansi.info/hybrid/\nhttp://www.vinsec.net/2012/05/hybrid-hdd-ssd-raid1.html\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/293144/combining-ssd-and-hard-disk-in-software-raid1\n\nA: First question\nFor performance reasons, don't do this. It will degrade performance when I/O is performed on the other partition. However, if performance is not of your concern, but redundancy is, you can consider this.\nSecond question\nNo, don't do this. The chain is as strong as the weakest link here. Your array will perform more like a HDD and you'll waste an expensive SSD.\nInstead, use...\ndm-cache or flashcache (quite advanced and experimental). It enables you to use your SSD as cache (read and write) for your slower hard drives. Huge performance gain and tweakable to find balance in durability and performance.\nSee also: How do I install and use flashcache/bcache to cache HDD to SSD?\n\nA: \nIs it advisable to create a raid array with only part of a drive and actively use the other part of that drive or should you always use the full disk?\n\nThe advice is always to use as much similar devices as you can. I'm not sure how much of that advice is superstition though, but lets look at this first:\n\nIs it advisable to create a raid 1 array with a SSD and HDD or will that blow the whole speed advantage of the SSD?\n\nNo. Don't do that, you will blow the speed. Apart from the fact that they are different devices etc, the one thing I am quite sure of is that your speeds will drop, as you are going to be working at the speed of the slowest disk -> your ssd-hdd combo will be way slower then your SSD :\nYou should NOT do that to your SSD. Your first option is the best one. Just give yourself safe userspace, and speedy system disk. Backup that disk. (remember, RAID is not a backup strategy)\n\nA: *\n\n*is probably best.\n\nYou could put everything in a BTRFS RAID-1 array, you would get 1064 GB out of it (as per https://carfax.org.uk/btrfs-usage/ ) and BTRFS optimizes reads (not writes) s.t. they come from the SSD when data is available there, but it is more likely that you know exactly what 128 GB you need to access faster (eg system partition) and you can make it its own partition to avoid the random allocation.\nI would avoid having multiple partitions per hard drive that are each part of multiple RAIDs, it could make access times unpredictible when your filesystem assumes they should be balanced equally but one is currently twice as busy. Splitting the SSD into a single partition and one that's part of the RAID-1 should be fine, but there is very little benefit with that little space.\n", "Q: External monitor problems with Asus UX32VD in 12.04 I've posted this video where I show one of the problems I'm facing with my UX32VD in regard of external monitors.\nAs you can see as soon as I plugged the external monitor the laptop screen goes black and the external monitor displays a single color (color changes between red, green and blue).\nHowever this does not always happen.

I'm am having the same problem and bumblebee/optirun doesn't solve it.\nYou could still use your VGA port if you have one.

However, dcraw is not as nice as ufraw because it doesn't have an interactive user interface. \n\nA: Use the UFRAW to process a .NEF file first, then Gimp should recognize ufraw as the sub-application to import with.   \n\nTo use the UFRaw Gimp plug-in you need first to install Gimp 2.0 or\n  higher. Gimp 2.4 is recommended. If you only plan to use UFRaw's\n  stand-alone tool, there is no need to install Gimp, but the Gimp Tool\n  Kit (GTK+2) is still needed. There is no need to install DCRaw itself\n  since its code is incorporated into UFRaw.\n\n~ http://ufraw.sourceforge.net/Install.html\n", "Q: bc: set number of digits after decimal point bc handles numbers as integers:\n# echo \"100/3\" | bc\n33\n\nbc -l handles numbers as floating point objects:\n# echo \"100/3\" | bc -l\n33.33333333333333333333\n\nIs there a way to limit the number of digits after the decimal point?\n\nA: you can also use printf command to round off result upto 3 decimals  \n# printf \"%.3f\\n\" $(echo \"100/3\" | bc -l)\n3.333\n\n\nA: In addition to previous answers\necho \"scale=2; 1.0150876\" | bc\n\nReturns\n1.0150876\n\nAdd Math operations to get only 2 decimal numbers - (NUMBER*100)/100\necho \"scale=2; (1.0150876 * 100) / 100\" | bc\n\nNow returns\n1.01\n\n\nA: Round-off\nscale=2 truncates the answer to two decimal digits, but we can achieve round-off like so:\n$ echo \"a=12/104; scale=2; (a+0.005)/1\" | bc -l\n.12\n\n\nA: scale works only for division; if some geeks need it in multiplication, then you can do achieve this by using string manipulation.\nSay if you need to multiply 32 * 0.60 , answer is 19.20.

Worth it? I am currently using Ubuntu 12.10. So, as described in the title I am planning to install Ubuntu studio. The programs i use are Blender, Maya 2013, NukeX, Bricscad, Sketchup (with wine) and also i am planning to install revit architecture through VirtualBox. Well, I am using a quad-core CPU and i want to have all the power of my system for rendering/modelling. So, i decided to try a more lightweight desktop than unity.\nAlso, what made me to decide this, is that when i tried to install Bricscad v12 the program does not work. So, i thought that if i want something more professional for my work i should have only LTS versions of lightweight Ubuntu.\nSo, my 2 questions are :1) Worth it?\n                        2) Can i have global menu(close,minimize,maximize buttons, menu) like ubuntu/unity?\nThanks\n\nA: I would suggest installing Kubuntu instead, and then just install whatever free software you want. Ubuntu Studio doesn't come with anything you can't get in Ubuntu/Kubuntu anyway.\nI went with Kubuntu because Unity, being based on Compiz, cannot support more than one graphics card. I think KDE is better than Unity anyway. The KDE project has been under active development since 1996 and it's got a much cleaner interface. I can design stuff on the center monitor and have auxiliary information on the side monitors. This is EXTREMELY nice when you are designing something and need to look at photos or read information, because there is almost zero context switch. You can look at supporting information without making the main app \"go away.\" If you're already running your brain at full tilt, every bit helps, and this is a game changer.\n\nA: There's a fix to make Bricscad run on Ubuntu 12.10.\nSee here\n", "Q: WebEx audio doesn't work on 12.04 LTS 32-bit I got \"The Audio Device is Unaccessible Now\" when trying to connect audio to WebEx session using computer.

They were on /tmp, which was on the same partition as the rest of / , so I need a tool that runs on a mounted system (or maybe I could use a livecd ...)\nRight now, I am trying testdisk on a systemrescuecd that I just downloaded. I can get some files from /tmp, but not all. (is it the right tool ? What exactly are those \"red\" files ? are only some of them recoverable ?)\n\nA: You can also use extundelete\nFirst unmount (umount) the file system where the files have been deleted. \nThen read the chapter What to do if you've deleted a file. \nYou can install extundelete from classic Ubuntu repository:\nsudo apt-get install extundelete\n\nOr better, you can download the latest version and compile it:\ncd ~/Download\ntar -xf extundelete-*.*.*-.tar.bz2  #Replace *.*.* by the version\ncd      extundelete-*.*.*\nsudo apt-get install e2fslibs-dev   #Required for compilation\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\nextundelete --version               #Should be your *.*.* version\n\nExample of usage: restore all deleted files from directory Images into new created directory restore\nsudo extundelete --restore-directory Images/ -o restore /dev/sda3\n\nBad news if you see your file XXXX within the following format:\nUnable to restore inode NNN (Images/XXXX): Space has been reallocated.\n\nSee all restored files (look for your file): \nfind restore -name '*'\n\nBackup your file(s) and remove this temporary directory restore\ncp restore/Images/XXXX MY_BACKUP_DIRECTORY\nsudo rm -rf restore  \n\n\nA: Data recovery, especially on EXT file systems, should be attempted from a live CD or other system that isn't depending on the partition you're undeleting from. Getting the disk unmounted or re-mounted as read only helps a great deal in the recovery effort.\nMost of the time I try to create an image of the partition or disk using dd or a similar tool, so that I'm not working on the disk itself:\ndd if=/dev/sd[xx] of=/media/backup_drive/recovery.img\n\nOnce you have your image, you can use a tool like ext3grep to try and find the files you're looking for. There are lots of different switches that you can try, but this might be a good start:\next3grep --restore-file 'tmp/moms-file.txt' recovery.img\n\nThe ext3grep utility also provides several different ways to search through the file system if you don't know the name of the file. Check ext3grep --help for the various methods of searching.\n\nA: I prefered to use ext4magic as :\nsudo ext4magic  /dev/sdc3 -r -f $USERl/Documents/ -d /tmp/local/tmp/\n\nNote you have to resolv symlink by your own\nReferences:\nhttp://ext4magic.sourceforge.net/howto_en.html\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/ext4magic/\nhttp://rzr.online.fr/q/recover\n\nA:  AnalyzeEXT\nParse data blocks for EXT directory data.\nDetailed documentation on EXT4 can be found here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout\n\n*https://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/tags/ext4\nDownload the perl script with\ngit clone https://github.com/halpomeranz/analyzeEXT\n\nNo guarantee but may be able to reconstruct deleted filesystems. \n\nA: I could not recover my crontab file by using ext4magic or extundelete.\nOn Debian, the crontab for root is here:\n/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root\n\nBut, by using the following command, I was able to at least manually recover my crontab from the logs.  \n grep CRON /var/log/syslog.* -i| awk -F \" CMD \" {'print $2;'} |sort | uniq\n\nIt will output only the executed cron jobs (no timings), but at least this is a lot more than starting from scratch.\nIf you don't remember how often certain cron jobs run, take a full log e.g. syslog.1 and this will give you the count for runs trough the day:\ngrep CRON /var/log/syslog.1 -i| awk -F \" CMD \" {'print $2;'} |sort | uniq -c |sort -n\n\n", "Q: How to create a dedicated user for running a service? I have an application that I want to run as a service on system-start, and that application should run as a specific user (the application is Apache Karaf). I have all this setup, but the user I am using for this has a password, so every time the service is started, the password of that user has to be entered.\nI currently have a user with the following entries in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow:\n# /etc/passwd\nkaraf-test-user:x:1002:1002::/home/karaf-test-user:/usr/sbin/nologin\n\n# /etc/shadow\nkaraf-test-user::15659:0:99999:7:::\n\nAs far as I can see this user does not have a password set, it cannot log in, but it does have a home-directory (this is required for the application). However, when I type:\n/etc/init.d/karaf-service start\n\nI am prompted for the password of that user. How can I prevent this? How can I modify this user to not require a password at this point? I have found this answer, but it seems hacky to me. Is this really the only way? Are there any best practices to respect?\nI am running on Ubuntu 12.04.1.\n\nA: The way I settled upon was to create the dedicated user with password, but always manage the service as root, which does not require a password for su. To make this secure, I have created a group karaf-admins and added the following entry to sudoers:\n%${KARAF_ADMINS} ALL=NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/karaf-service\n\nThis allows members of that group to run commands like sudo /etc/init.d/karaf-service start as root without entering a password. The karaf-service-script itself will then switch to the dedicated user I have setup. As long as users in karaf-admins are not allowed to edit the service-script or the symlink (which they shouldn't be), this is perfectly safe.\n", "Q: Why my upstart script doesn't run?

However, when I try to log on my laptop (without the secondary screen), I cannot do anything: I cannot launch a terminal or event use the mouse.\nHow do I solve this?\n\nA: I too use a laptop with an nVidia graphics card. \nFirst update to the \"experimental\" 310 drivers from the repositories. They seem to do a much better job at auto detecting when a monitor is plugged in.\nSecond, in nvidia-settings, disable the secondary monitor, enable the primary monitor (built in one) and the save to xorg and restart X\nrestart lightdm\nThis should make it so that you can use your internal monitor only. \nNow, with everything running on your internal monitor, install disper\napt-get install disper\nThis handy tool allows you to set up a few things without having to rely on nvidia-settings which seems to really confuse unity, and without directly having to use xrandr which can be a bit of a pain when your randomly changing monitors all the time.\nLast few steps:\nTest that you can get your second monitor to play nice by plugging it in. It should \"just work\" in Ubuntu by going to \"Displays\" and setting it up the way you want it. It's very important that \"Displays\" see two monitors and not 1 large monitor.\n\nWith everything working in unity on two monitors in \"Displays\" run \ndisper -s\nThat should turn off the second display and leave only your internal monitor running.\nNow, finally, to make that work at the greeter, open /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf \nadd or change:\ndisplay-setup-script=disper -s\nFor reference my /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf:\n[SeatDefaults]\nuser-session=ubuntu\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nxserver-command=/usr/local/bin/xswitcher.sh\ndisplay-setup-script=disper -s\nMake sure not to copy the xserver-command, only use the display-setup-script line.\nYou should now be able to log in fine. The primary monitor will get the unity greeter, and once you log in unity should take over, and setup what ever you have configured in \"Displays\"\nFor me this means the greeter has the primary on, the secondary off, and then I log in and the primary is \"right of\" the secondary, with both displays on.

Also you can uninstall by complete the tntnet package.\nOr you can change apache port, edit lampp/etc/httpd.conf, change the port to 8080, for example:\n#Listen 12.34.56.78:80\nListen 8080\n\nStart it using lampp startapache\n\nBy default XAMPP's apache use port 80 (requires root for ports below 1024), anyway it can be changed by editing $XAMPP/apache/conf/httpd.conf\nYou can run\nlsof -i :80\n\nor\nnetstat -nap | grep :80\n\nto figure out the process using port 80\nFor example if I use Python's SimpleHTTPServer module on port 8080\n$ lsof -i :8080\nCOMMAND   PID  USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\npython  16484 terry    3u  IPv4 367600      0t0  TCP *:http-alt (LISTEN)\n\n$ netstat -anp | grep :8080\n(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info\n will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8080            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      16484/python\n\nVery clear.\n\nA: Since I don't know if I'll be needing tntnet, and don't care for finding out the hard way, the best option seemed to change the port Apache uses.\nWith the latest versions of XAMPP, this is very easily done using the GUI manager included:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the manager (use manager-linux-x64.run if working on 64bits):\ncd /opt/lampp\nsudo ./manager-linux.run\n\n\n*Change to the \"Manage Servers\" tab and select \"Apache Web Server\". Click on Configure:\n\n\n*Change the port on the corresponding field to, e.g., 8080 and click OK:\n\n\n*Start all servers from the application by clicking on Start All.\n\n*Open your favourite browser and go to http://localhost:8080; it should redirect automatically to http://localhost:8080/xampp.\n", "Q: How to enable home directory encryption for a particular user?

I want to buy an external USB 3.0 drive and I wonder how to figure out whether my laptop has such a port (or only 2.0). \nNeither lsusb -v, nor /proc/bus/input/devices offers any obvious hints, although the former says a lot of 2.0 root hub which might imply v2 and not v3. Right?\n\nA: If the output of lsusb shows ports with varying USB versios and you're having trouble matching each line to the corresponding USB port of your machine, try the following: Plug in a memory stick at the port in question. Then run lsusb -t and look for the phrase \"Mass Storage\". The parent of this node corresponds to the USB port where you plugged in your memory stick. As Bain said, the transfer speed at the end of that line tells you the USB version (USB 1 is 12M, USB 2 is 480M, and USB 3 is 5000M on my machines).\n(Sorry, I tried to just add a comment to Bain's answer but I don't have enough reputation.)\n\nA: Response from Zanna above is wonderful if you don't have a lot of USB device, but it can be improved like that:\n$ sudo lsusb -v 2>/dev/null | grep -e \"^Bus\\|bcdUSB\"\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 0781:5580 SanDisk Corp.

Just look at the ports on your laptop. If they aren't blue, they aren't USB 3 ports. There is probably some terminal command to determine this but just  visually inspecting the ports will be the simplest.\nEdit: An anonymous user suggested a helpful edit which was rejected, but I think it's helpful as it proves my answer isn't 100% correct. I'll copy it verbatim below and hope it proves useful:\n\nI have read many places that the UBS 3.0 ports are blue, but that is\n  not true in my experiences. I have a Dell Latitude E6430 that does\n  have two 2.0 USB ports and two 3.0 USB ports.

If a USB 3.0 port is not blue, you will most likely see the phrase \"SS\" for super speed next to it, like this:\n\n", "Q: BT Home Hub 2.0 I have used my old BT Home Hub with no problems.

I selected option to run alongside Windows 7 but when it was partitioning it failed and I only had the fresh install as an option as probably Windows became corrupt then?  \nSo I installed Windows again, ran Ubuntu from the livecd, went into gpartition, didn't really know what I was doing but anyhow, resized a partition which was 698gb, one was 100mb, I guessed CD drive.  Gparted said it was gonna take three hours, so I took that for meaning Windows was corrupt again.\nYour help is greatly appreciated.\nThanks\n\nA: You can find out the steps in the Ubuntu Documentation site. It has the steps to follow, along with some extra information you should keep in mind; for instance, it is a lot better to install Windows first, then Ubuntu.\nAlso, if you need to resize your Windows partition, make sure to defragment the drive in Windows first -- this will improve your results.

I have more then one computer at home, and I would really like if I could set up a home FTP server to access all of the files?\nThe WiFi router is connected to a PC that runs Ubuntu 12.10 and files are stored on it that I want to access from other systems. The other systems are — two PCs that use Windows 8 and with one that uses Windows 7. Will it work?\nSo is there an easy way to do this?\n\nA: The easiest thing would be to use SFTP. It has the advantage of being encrypted (communicating over SSH). To install a server for SSH/SFTP, press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal and run this command:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nThen use ifconfig to find out the IP address of your computer. You can then connect to it from other computers using this address.\nIf your computer is running ubuntu, just select the \"Connect to server\" option (I don't use unity, but it should be easy enough to find. You will get a window like the picture below. Make sure to use the correct IP address and enter your username and password.\n\nIf you need to connect from a Windows computer, you can use WinSCP.\n\nA: FTP or SFTP are poor choices in a home network if you need seamless access on multiple types of clients and operating systems. Samba is a better choice because it works with Windows, Linux and Mac very well.\nThe filesystem can be easily mounted to all those platforms enabling direct access to the files without copying it locally first.\nStart here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba\n\nA: If you are set on ftp, look at FTP Server\nHowever, I agree with Peter Jenkins' answer that Samba is the way to go in a multiple OS environment. You will be able to mount the Samba shares from Linux, Windows, Mac, ... and access the files.  \nNote, one side effect of using Samba is if you delete a file on a Samba share using a file browser (Nautilus, Windows Explorer, Mac Finder ...), it is gone, as in it does not go to the trash can.  Samba can \"recycle\" files, however this needs to be setup in smb.conf to recycle.

I now have two Windows 7 running side by side with the option to boot either at start-up.

I've installed Ubuntu on an ASUS S200E, but after the installation I'm no longer able to run either Ubuntu or Windows 8.\nThis is the boot-repair log I've got, here you can find all the info: http://paste2.org/p/2483158\nAfter using boot-repair, this is the new bootinfo summary: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1361562/\nNow, I can boot the system, but I can't login (\"invalid password\" error). Maybe boot-repair deleted some system files?\nSOLVED: Thank you, the problem was that Ubuntu wasn't correctly installed. The installation procedure didn't create the user! I've reinstalled Ubuntu, re-did the boot-repair procedure, and now everything works.\n\nA: According to http://paste.ubuntu.com/1361562/ , Boot-Repair has successfully setup your boot in UEFI mode.\nBoot-Repair never (cannot) touches files related to login, so the \"invalid password\" error is due to something else.\nEg, if your password contains numbers or special character, try to type it with CapsLock enabled/disabled.\n\nA: It's not clear precisely what your symptoms are. If I'm reading correctly, you were initially unable to boot either OS, but after running a boot repair utility, you're now able to boot, but not log in, to at least one OS. Which OS(es) are bootable is unclear to me. I'm guessing you can boot but not log into Linux and are unable to boot Windows. I have some observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 8 includes a \"fast boot\" feature that involves leaving disks in an unclean state on shutdown. This may work fine on a Windows-only computer, but on a dual-boot system, it's a problem waiting to happen. I recommend you disable it by typing powercfg /h off in a Windows Administrator command prompt. With any luck that action will clean up the errors associated with /dev/sda5 in your Boot Info Script output.\n\n*Your disk (/dev/sda; it looks like /dev/sdb is a USB flash drive) is set up with a GUID Partition Table (GPT), and if Windows ever booted from this disk that means that Windows was booting in EFI mode.\n\n*Your disk (again, /dev/sda) has GRUB BIOS-mode boot code in the MBR. If your computer is booting in EFI mode, this is unnecessary at best. On some systems, it can cause boot problems because some EFI implementations look at the MBR and decide which boot mode to use based on the presence or absence of BIOS boot code in the MBR. That said, if you're successfully booting Ubuntu in EFI mode, you should probably leave this alone.\n\n*Your grub.cfg file lacks an entry for Windows, but you've got two such entries in /etc/grub.d/25_custom. You might be able to incorporate them into your GRUB menu by typing sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Alternatively, you could try another boot manager, such as rEFInd or gummiboot. In fact, these can both boot Linux kernels directly, bypassing GRUB, but you'll need to do some extra configuration to get this to work. For rEFInd, once it's set up you won't need to do any more changes in the future; but for gummiboot, you'll need to edit your boot configuration manually whenever you update your kernel.\n\n\nAs LovinBuntu says, a boot repair utility shouldn't have touched your password. If you're desperate enough, you can boot with an emergency disc and edit /etc/shadow on your main installation directly with a text editor. Back up the original file before proceeding, in case you make a mistake. The second colon-delimited field (right after username:, where username is your username) holds the password. It's hashed, so it will be unintelligible and quite long. Delete the password only (up to the next colon on that line) and when you reboot your account will have no password. Log in and change it immediately. Of course, it's best to check the simple obvious-in-hindsight possibilities like the stuck Caps Lock key that LovinBuntu suggested first!\n\nA: Check out the links below. They have helped me.

If I select an icon in Nautilus and select Properties, I can click on the icon presented there. This gives me a file-chooser dialog to select a new icon image.\nI would like to do this via a script of some sort so that I can assign the same icon to many files at once. Or take a list of icons and a list of files and assign them to each other.\nIs there some way I can accomplish this? Something in bash or Python would be great, but I'll take what I can get.\nPlease note:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am not asking how to change the icon for a file type.\n\n*I am not asking how to change an icon on the launcher.\n\n\n\n\nA: gio (gnome > 3.xx)\nSince gvfs tools are outdated, you should use gio instead!\nThe commands are very similar to the one described above. \nFor instance if you want to get information about the icon set use \ngio info ~/path/to/your/dir/or/folder | awk '{/custom-icon/ print $2}' | cut -c8-\n\nThis outputs the full path to the icon, assumed you have made a custom-icon.\nTo set an custom-icon simply use the command\ngio set -t string /path/to/your/dir/or/folder metadata::custom-icon file:///path/to/your/icon.svg\n\n\nA: To change those icons from the command line, you can use the following command:\ngvfs-set-attribute -t string /path/to/your/file metadata::custom-icon file:///path/to/your/icon.png\n\nYou can use this command in a bash script according to your needs.\nIf you run the command and the icon does not change immediately, you can install the xautomation package with:\nsudo apt-get install xautomation\n\nAnd finally, use the command \"xte\" to \"sendkey\" in bash like \"F5\" to refresh..\nA little example would be:\n#!/bin/bash\ngvfs-set-attribute -t string /home/hermes/testicon metadata::custom-icon file:///home/hermes/Desktop/applet_blank.png\nsleep 3\nxte \"key F5\"  \n\nI hope this is useful for you.\n\nA: Roman's answer looks ideal.  There is another less elegant way.  I'm not sure where icons live in the rest of the system, but icons that are on your Desktop are just little plain text files in $HOME/Desktop.  They usually (but don't have to) have the extension of .desktop. One of the fields in these files is Icon=....  You can use a program to change whatever that field is set to to the value of your choice.

Now I want to cp these files to a new dir.\nI am trying,\ncp *.prj ../prjshp/\n\nand \ncp * | grep '\\.prj$' ../prjshp/\n\nbut they are giving the same error,\n\nbash: /bin/cp: Argument list too long\n\nHow do I copy them?\n\nA: cp *.prj ../prjshp/ is the right command, but you've hit a rare case where it runs into a size limitation. The second command you tried doesn't make any sense.\nOne method is to run cp on the files in chunks. The find command knows how to do this:\nfind -maxdepth 1 -name '*.prj' -exec mv -t ../prjshp {} +\n\n\n\n*\n\n*find traverses the current directory and the directories below it recursively.\n\n*-maxdepth 1 means to stop at a depth of 1, i.e. don't recurse into subdirectories.\n\n*-name '*.prj' means to only act on the files whose name matches the specified pattern. Note the quotes around the pattern: it will be interpreted by the find command, not by the shell.\n\n*-exec … {} + means to execute the specified command for all the files. It invokes the command multiple times if necessary, taking care not to exceed the command line limit.\n\n*mv -t ../prjshp moves the specified files into ../prjshp. The -t option is used here because of a limitation of the find command: the found files (symbolized by {}) are passed as the last argument of the command, you can't add the destination after it.\n\n\nAnother method is to use rsync.\nrsync -r --include='*.prj' --exclude='*' . ../prjshp\n\n\n\n*\n\n*rsync -r … . ../prjshp copies the current directory into ../prjshp recursively.\n\n*--include='*.prj' --exclude='*' means to copy files matching *.prj and exclude everything else (including subdirectories, so .prj files in subdirectories won't be found).\n\n\nA: This command copies the files one by one and will work even if there are too many of them for * to expand into a single cp command:\nfor i in *; do cp \"$i\" ../prjshp/; done\n\n\nA: IMHO, the optimal tools for dealing with hordes of files are find and xargs. See man find. See man xargs. find, with its -print0 switch, produces a NUL-separated list of filenames (filenames may contain any character execpt NUL or /) that xargs understands, using the -0 switch. xargs then builds the longest command allowed (the most filenames, no half-filename at the end) and executes it. xargs repeats this until find supplies no more filenames. Run xargs --show-limits </dev/null to see the limits.\nTo solve your problem, (and after checking man cp to find --target-directory=):  \nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.prj' -print0 | xargs -0 cp --target-directory=../prjshp/\n\n\nA: There's 3 key points to keep in mind when facing Argument list too long error:\n\n\n*\n\n*The length of command-line arguments is limited by ARG_MAX variable, which by POSIX definition is  \"...[m]aximum length of argument to the exec functions including environment data\" (emphasis added)\". That is, when shell executes a non-built-it command, it has to call one of exec() to spawn that command's process, and that's where ARG_MAX comes into play. Additionally, the name or path to the command itself ( for example, /bin/echo ) plays a role.\n\n*Shell built-in commands are executed by shell, which means the shell doesn't use exec() family of functions and therefore aren't affected by ARG_MAX variable.\n\n*Certain commands, such as xargs and find are aware of ARG_MAX variable and repeatedly perform actions under that limit\nFrom the points above and as shown in Kusalananda's excellent answer on related question, the Argument list too long can also occur when environment is big. So taking in consideration that each user's environment may vary, and the argument size in bytes is relevant, it's hard to come up with a single number of  files/arguments. \nHow to handle such error ?\nThe key thing is to focus not on the number of files, but focus on whether or not the command you're going to use involves exec() family of function and tangentially - the stack space.\nUse shell built-ins\nAs discussed before, the shell built-ins are immune to ARG_MAX limit, that is things such as for loop, while loop, built-in echo, and built-in printf - all those will perform well enough. \nfor i in /path/to/dir/*; do cp \"$i\" /path/to/other/dir/; done\n\nOn related question about deleting files, there was a solution as such:\nprintf '%s\\0' *.jpg | xargs -0 rm --\n\nNote that this uses shell's built-in printf. If we're calling the external printf, that will involve exec(), hence will fail with large number of arguments:\n$ /usr/bin/printf \"%s\\0\" {1..7000000}> /dev/null\nbash: /usr/bin/printf: Argument list too long\n\nbash arrays\nAccording to an answer by jlliagre, bash doesn't impose limits on arrays, so building array of filenames and using slices per iteration of loop can be done as well, as shown in danjpreron's answer:\nfiles=( /path/to/old_dir/*.prj )\nfor((I=0;I<${#files[*]};I+=1000)); do \n    cp -t /path/to/new_dir/ \"${files[@]:I:1000}\" \ndone\n\nThis, however, has limitation of being bash-specific and non-POSIX.\nIncrease stack space\nSometimes you can see people suggest increasing the stack space with ulimit -s <NUM>; on Linux ARG_MAX value is 1/4th of stack space for each program,  which means increasing stack space proportionally increases space for arguments.\n# getconf reports value in bytes, ulimit -s in kilobytes\n$ getconf ARG_MAX\n2097152\n$ echo $((  $(getconf ARG_MAX)*4 ))\n8388608\n$ printf \"%dK\\n\" $(ulimit -s) | numfmt --from=iec --to=none\n8388608\n# Increasing stack space results in increated ARG_MAX value\n$ ulimit -s 16384\n$ getconf ARG_MAX\n4194304\n\nAccording to answer by Franck Dernoncourt, which cites Linux Journal, \none can also recompile Linux kernel with larger value for maximum memory pages for arguments, however, that's more work than necessary and opens potential for exploits as stated in the cited Linux Journal article.  \nAvoid shell\nAnother way, is to use python or python3 which come by default with Ubuntu.  The python + here-doc example below, is something I personally used to copy a large directory of files somewhere in the range of 40,000 items:\n$ python <<EOF\n> import shutil\n> import os\n> for f in os.listdir('.'):\n>    if os.path.isfile(f):\n>         shutil.copy(f,'./newdir/')\n> EOF\n\nFor recursive traversals, you can use os.walk.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*What defines the maximum size for a command single argument?\n", "Q: java2-runtime virtual package not considered installed by dpkg/apt-get Did a fresh install of Quetzal Server, installed all updates.

How can I do this, especially in Chrome!\n\nA: If you are using Chrome or Chromium, you can install this chrome app that will enable you scrolling with only the middle button of the mouse, however you have to continue holding the middle button down while scrolling\n\nA: It is natively available in Firefox. In recent versions (tested in version 106.0.1),\nOpen the page about:config and set general.autoScroll -> true\n\nOriginal answer.\nIt is native in Firefox, at least 41.0.\nGo to Preferences ➜ Advanced ➜ General ➜ Browsing ➜ \"Use autoscrolling\".\nOn newer versions: Settings ➜ General ➜ Browsing ➜ \"Use autoscrolling\".\n\nA: Not really.

I don't have access to running any installer at the minute so I knew that if running from the CD you just burn the iso file to the CD and your ready to go..but can I download this iso file to my USB and run it straight away when I change my bios to boot from USB?..or do I have to use the installer?..I can't use the installer for different reasons and I'm not really looking to install ubuntu just yet I just want to run it off my USB to try it out..so is it possible not to use the installer to put it on my USB? (I downloaded Ubuntu 12.10) \n\nA: The answer is yes and no.\nNo you cannot just copy the file to a usb and have it run, it will be missing important files to allow the boot.  You could burn the ISO directly  to a DVD(instructions HERE)  and boot from the DVD(a CD is too small for 12.10 but can be used for 12.04)\nYou can, however use a program to install it ISO file onto the USB so that it can be booted.  \nThe instructions to make a bootable USB in Windows are HERE.

Anyone know of a way to remove Steam from Ubuntu 12.04? Looked around the net but could not find an straight forward solution.    Thanks. \n\nA: I had the same issue - installed with the .deb package from the website rather than using Terminal. I fixed by running:\nsudo apt-get purge steam\ncd ~/.local/share && rm -rf Steam\n\nAnd then clicking on the menu and searching for the Steam app that was still present, right clicking it and selecting uninstall which removed the rest of the files. I hope this helps!\n\nA: The .deb package is just a wrapper. Steam's launcher installs itself to ~/.local/share/Steam and can be over 1GiB so make sure you remove it.\nsudo apt-get purge steam\nsudo apt-get purge steam-launcher\ncd ~/.local/share && rm -rf Steam\nrm ~/.steampath\nrm ~/.steampid\n\nYou may have only one of \"steam\" or \"steam-launcher\".\n\nA: Open a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T). Then type: \nsudo apt-get remove steam\n\n\nA: This is to complement any of the answers mentioned here regarding Steam installed via Software Center. If you happened to have installed Steam through Wine and wanted to uninstall it you can go to ~/.wine/dosdevices/c: or by typing the letter C in Dash.\nIn there you will find the Program Files folder which holds the Steam client. If you deleted Wine, this folder and any other install apps will still reside here. They are not gone even if you uninstall wine. You would have to delete them manually. On the other hand, if you still have Wine installed, typing wine uninstaller will get you to the Wine uninstaller, similar to the Windows \"Add & Remove app\".\nYou can also remove everything by simply rm -fr ~/.wine assuming you already uninstalled Wine and do not care about anything else in the Wine folder.\n\nA: You uninstall Steam just as you would uninstall every other application. You search for it in Ubuntu Software Center and then you remove it.\nIf you also want to remove the data created by your Steam installation (like downloaded game files) there are two possible locations where Steam stores these files. One a directory called Steam directly in your home directory. The other is in the hidden directory .local/share/Steam in your home directory (you can view hidden files and directories by pressing CTRL+H).\nRemoving this directory means you will have to re-download your games when you decide to play them again. There is an option to backup your games from inside Steam.\n\nA: Removing Steam using the Ubuntu Software Centre:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Ubuntu Software Centre, by clicking on the appropriate icon in the launcher, or opening the dash and searching for it.\n\n*Search for \"Steam\" in the Ubuntu Software Centre.\n\n*Select it, and click \"Remove\"\n\nThis will remove Steam from your system. Only system files, however, will be removed, user files will not. For most programs, user files are very small and not worth worrying about, but for Steam, they include all your downloaded games, and can be quite large. To delete your user files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus, the default file explorer.\n\n*Click \"View\", \"Show Hidden Files\", or press Ctrl-H.\n\n*Navigate to .local/share/ and delete the steam folder.\nRemoving steam using the command-line:\nYou can do the equivalent of the previous steps in just two commands:\n$ sudo apt-get remove steam\n$ rm -r ~/.local/share/steam\n\nIn general, programs on Linux tend to keep user files in hidden directories in the home folder, either under .local/share, .config or .cache, or in a separate .PROGRAMNAME directory. Hidden files and directories always begin with a dot.\n\nA: You can use Ubuntu Software Center to uninstall or Open Terminal and execute the following command:\nsudo apt-get remove steam steam-launcher\n\nPurge Steam Perfectly with Configuration files with the following:\nsudo apt-get purge steam steam-launcher\n\nNever forget to delete its directory located at home folder:\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/Steam && rm -rf ~/.steam\n\n\nA: I've searched an other way to uninstall it if you have the package .deb.\nYou do secundary click, select open with and choose Installer GDebi package, wait still that charge and after click uninstall all\n", "Q: Open new windows with Kupfer I was using gnome-do before I switched to Kupfer which is awesome, the problem is that when I try to open something like terminal and I already have one open it will switch focus to the existing one.\nIs there any way to set it up that it will open a new window instead?\n\nA: After typing your application name, switch to the \"action\" by hitting tab and type \"launch again\".\nTo make it the permanent default for this application, select \"Make 'Launch Again' Default for...\" from the kupfer menu in the top-right corner.\n", "Q: Anyone Getting Bad Printouts from 12.10?

The current LTS kernel, 4.4 works fine, as does 4.7.  \nupdate 9/2015...kernels above 3.14 or so have most of multitouch built in now, so try uninstalling mtrack if you have problems.  just the built in multitouch driver and easystroke is working fine for me since kernel 3.14, though the 4.0 and up seem to have a regression that breaks the apple trackpad.  3.18 kernel works great though.\nThere are numerous solutions, most of which are still a little half-baked. Many of the documented ones are out of date, so make sure you look at the date of whatever you google.   \nUbuntu has built in rudimentary gestures (2 finger) support in the mouse/touchpad settings applet.\nI found it randomly conked out and two finger scrolling would then be mysteriously greyed out, setting me off on a long chain of googling to maybe get it back.\nThen I tried touchegg, which sort of worked sometimes.\nIt is the easiest to configure and there are good instructions but it is based on an older daemon solution to the problem.\nThe ubuntu multitouch howto (you'll have to google it as I can only include two links) was badly out of date but is slowly getting worked on. It sort of offers another set of patchy solutions, but is in the process of getting updated.  \nThe solution I am currently using is mtrack (in the repos) combined with easystroke (have to compile from source).\nMtrack supports the kernel version of multitouch rather than an ad hoc solution like touchegg and ginn if I understand right, but easystroke is another daemon solution that seems to work well for now on top of mtrack.  \nMtrack's approach seems to be the direction development is taking.  \nuninstall the other stuff (ginn, touchegg) if you use it and then install mtrack from the repos full name is xserver-xorg-input-mtrack.  \nIt is a pain to configure and I have not gotten three fingers to swipe.  See the link at the end of the thread for people's various config files. I use an apple magic trackpad and it is pretty good for that, though it has one annoying glitch in that double-tap and drag for example to move a window is erratic. workaround is to either use an actual button click to move windows, or to hesitate a split second after the double tap and hold before moving the window.\nI just found easystroke, and until mtrack gets a gui you might want to try that if you are adventurous enough to try compiling a program.  \nonce compiled by running make -j2 and installed by sudo make install, start it with easystroke -g to get the GUI and go to the wiki page for instructions.  \nOne other issue you may need to sort out is the drivers.  \nIf you use mtrack, you might need to renumber the files so your mtrack driver gets read last or the synaptics settings will grab everything.  \nThose drivers are stored at /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d.  \ncopy the mtrack driver to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d, edit the settings in that folder (see the linked thread and the README for how) to get your three finger goodness if you can (or use easystroke), and rename the file to a higher number so 50-mtrack.conf becomes 60-mtrack.conf,  otherwise I found the synaptic driver will grab your touchpad half the time.  \nPutting the file in /etc means that it will not get overwritten on updates like the /usr files, and that it is read last and thus takes priority over the default drivers in /usr.  \nHope this helps.  This is an area of fairly active development, so whatever I write will probably be obsolete within a year, hopefully for the better.\n", "Q: Can I reinstall Windows 7 without touching my existing dual boot Ubuntu installation? I have dual boot configured with Windows 7 (32bit) and Ubuntu 12.04(64bit). I installed Ubuntu after windows, now my windows is corrupt due to some virus and I need to reinstall it. Currently when I start my PC, grub loader comes up and I need to select Ubuntu or Windows. \nI was wondering how can I install windows again and still have my Ubuntu install? Is there a way to do this?\nI do not want to install Ubuntu again and lose my settings and data there. \nThanks,\nKetan\n\nA: Point to note: By dual boot you meant Ubuntu not installed by wubi.\nInstall windows 7 as usual in the same drive as it is now. It will replace the GRUB and ubuntu will not be bootable. But ubuntu isn't deleted. You can recover it using a simple tool boot-repair without complicated commands.\nBoot using ubuntu disk after installation of windows 7.\nUse boot-repair to perform a Recomemnded Repair .

Its very useful to me. \n\nA: Many people are using the os.system call way too much. You're running a Python script, then run Python, not Bash!\nUsing os.system will greatly reduce the functionality of your program.

How do I delete the following directory?\nI typed:\nrmdir lampp\n\nThis error comes up:\nrmdir: failed to remove `lampp': Directory not empty\n\nIs there a command to delete all the files in the directory and delete the directory folder?\n\nA: There are lots of ways to delete a directory through CLI mode. It depends on which way you are comfortable with.\nrm -rvf /path/to/directory  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*-r  =  remove directories and their contents recursively\n\n*-v  =  explain what is being done\n\n*-f  =  ignore nonexistent files, never prompt\n\n\nIf you are new in Linux, use the man pages of commands (man rm) for more option and more accuracy.\n\nA: Use the below command :\nrm -rf lampp\n\nIt deletes all files and folders contained in the lampp directory.\nIn case user doesn't have the permission to delete the folder:\nAdd sudo at the beginning of the command :\nsudo rm -rf folderName\n\nOtherwise, without sudo you will be returned permission denied. And it's a good practice to try not to use -f while deleting a directory:\nsudo rm -r folderName\n\nNote: this is assuming you are already on the same level of the folder you want to delete in terminal, if not:\nsudo rm -r /path/to/folderName\n\nFYI: you can use letters -f, -r, -v:\n\n*\n\n*-f = to ignore non-existent files, never prompt\n\n*-r = to remove directories and their contents recursively\n\n*-v = to explain what is being done\n\n\nA: rm -R lampp\n\nHowever, you need to be careful with a recursive command like this, as it's easy to accidentally delete a lot more than you intended.\nIt is a good idea to always double-check which directory you're in, and whether you typed the command correctly, before pressing Enter.\nSafer version\nrm -R -i lampp\n\nAdding -i makes it a little safer, because it will prompt you on every deletion.  However, if you are deleting many files this is not going to be very practical.  Still, you can try this first.\nNote about -f option:\nMany people suggest using -f (combining it into -Rf or -rf), claiming that it gets rid of annoying prompts.  However, in normal cases you don't need it, and using it suppresses some problems that you probably do want to know about.  When you use it, you won't be warned if your arguments supply a non-existing directory or file(s): rm will just silently fail to delete anything.  As a general rule, try first without the -f: if there are problems with your arguments, then you'll notice.  If you start getting too many prompts about files without write access, then you can try it with -f.  Alternatively, run the command from a user (or the superuser using sudo) that has full permissions to the files and directories you're deleting to prevent these prompts in the first place.\n\nA: I was having some trouble with that today, but I overcame it with sudo.\nCaveat: Be very certain you want to delete the entire thing before using the command below.\n$ sudo rm -R [Directory name]\n\nI successfully did this today, and removed many non-empty directories that I confirmed I didn't want/need.\nI'm using 14.04 LTS\n", "Q: The battery indicator& Power setting panel shows wrong battery state My laptop is Thinkpad E420 with Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit installed, the kernel version is 3.2.0-33-generic.\nI have set the battery threshold as 60% via windows7.

The first is the design capacity of the battery, the second is the predicted battery capacity when fully charged. \nPOWER_SUPPLY_ENERGY_NOW=17860000\n..and this is from the ACPI _BST control, showing you the current battery charge. This is dynamic and will change.\nThis data is typically read from the Embedded Controller that talks to the smart battery usually over the i2c bus.  This data is presented to the kernel via the APCI controls so this data is basically what the kernel is given, it has no control over this data but to present it directly to user space applications.\nThese current values show that the battery when last fully charged got to 69.6% of full battery design capacity.  Also your current capacity is about 80% of the full charge capacity and 56.3% of the theoretical design capacity of the battery.\nMy guess is that the user space apps are showing you the battery capacity in percentage terms of the full charge capacity.

If that does not work, please run boot info script (http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/ ) and post the RESULTS.txt that it produces so that I have the information needed to give you proper advice.\n\nA: Method1\n1.Enter Windows recovery mode by pressing \"esc\"(may be different way on your computer) while booting.\n2.Click on \"Troubleshoot\"\n3.Click \"Advanced options\"\n4.Choose \"Command Prompt\" \n5.Type the following commands: \nbootrec /fixmbr\nbootrec /fixboot\nbootrec /scanos\nbootrec /rebuildbcd\n\n6.Now restart your computer\nGood if this works for you, if not then try \nMethod2.\n1.Use Rufus to make Ubuntu live USB drive and boot into Ubuntu.\n2.Start terminal type\nsudo fdisk -l\n\n3.Note down the root partion of linux installation.\n Example: (/dev/sda8) in my case.\nand your boot partion which is indicated by *\nsign.\n Example : (/dev/sda6) in my case.\n4.Now mount your root partion to make some changes and some binding.\nBelow replace \"/dev/sda8\" with your root partion.\nsudo mount /dev/sda8 /mnt\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\n5.Now change the root directory from usb drive to the hardrive's root directory\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\n6.Now install the grub to the boot partion of your's, which you noted down with the * sign\nreplace \"/dev/sda6\" with your boot partion.\ngrub-install /dev/sda6\n\n7.Now type.\nexit\n\n8.Unmount partation previously mounted earlier.\nsudo unmount /mnt/dev\nsudo unmount /mnt/proc\nsudo unmount /mnt/sys\nsudo unmount /mnt\n\n9.Remove the pendrive and reboot your pc.\nAnd next time while dual booting window and linux refer this answer\nDual boot Windows and linux\n\nA: i have a boot fixer too...  not   (sorry i couldn't resist ;)\nRunning the update-grub from live Stick ruined my boot entries.\nbut let me boot into the installed system. (ubuntu 20.04)\nIn my simple case I just had to run update-grub again from the installed and properly booted linux system.\nwhich would find the windows bootloader...\nand an 'grub-install' after would persist it.\nI have a triple boot system. so this is becoming a common process.\nits not like 10 years ago anymore ;)\n\nA: There is no way to undo the partition changes to Windows. You will have to reinstall or recover Windows, then reinstall Ubuntu.\nFirst, try running Boot-Repair(info) and see if this helps. To run this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from a Ubuntu live DVD or USB.\n\n*Type these lines in the terminal one line at a time.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\n\n*Search for Boot-Repair in the Dash and launch it.\n\nTo fix your computer with Boot-Repair, simply click the \"Recommended Repair\" button. If it worked, you are done.\n\nIf Boot Repair didn't work, run a repair with a Windows Recovery CD (ask for one from your PC manufacturer).\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from a recovery CD.  You should see this.  \n\n\n*Open the Command Prompt app and type bootrec /fixmbr.\n\n(images from HowtoGeek)\n\n*Close the Window and choose \"Startup Repair\" this time.  Wait until the process is completed.  It usually takes about 30 minutes-2 hours.\nIf Windows is successfully repaired, you are done.  If it is not, you will have to reinstall Windows with a Windows Installation CD.\nIf you don't have a Windows Installation CD, you could boot an Ubuntu live DVD/USB and install a bootloader with equivalent function to the Windows bootloader.\nsudo apt-get update   \nsudo apt-get install lilo  \nsudo lilo -M /dev/sda mbr  \n\nLilo will give you a warning after it's installed, but you can ignore that as lilo works fine when it is used as a Windows style bootloader.\n\nNext, after Windows is installed or recovered, you will have to delete the Ubuntu partitions.  Identify them and delete it with the Disk management Utility in Windows.\n\nAfter that, reinstall Ubuntu the same way.\n\nA: If the OSs were installed in different modes, dual booting Windows and Ubuntu can't work. If your Windows is installed in BIOS mode, it is recommended to install your Ubuntu in BIOS mode, but if it's installed in UEFI mode, then do the same with Ubuntu. The easiest way to find out if you are running UEFI or BIOS is to look for a folder named /sys/firmware/efi. The folder will be missing if your system is using BIOS.\n\n          BIOS vs. UEFI\nIf you have installed Ubuntu in legacy mode on the same drive with GPT partitioning, you can use Boot Repair's Advanced options to uninstall grub-pc and install grub-efi-amd64. That converts the Ubuntu installation from BIOS boot to UEFI boot, the same firmware as most recently manufactured laptops with Windows pre-installed have.\nConverting Ubuntu into UEFI mode\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Boot-Repair, and select Advanced options -> GRUB location tab.  \n\n*If you do not see a Separate /boot/efi partition option, this means that your PC does not have any UEFI partition.  \n\n*If you see a Separate /boot/efi partition option, put a checkmark in the checkbox to the left of it, then click the Apply button in the lower right corner.  \n \n\n*Set up your BIOS so that it boots the hard drive in UEFI mode. The way to adjust this setting depends on the specific model of the computer, but generally this setting is located in the boot priority settings under the Boot tab of the BIOS/UEFI setup utility.\nFor more information about converting Ubuntu into UEFI mode review https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI in the section about Converting Ubuntu into UEFI mode. \nThe grub bootloader can also be converted in the opposite direction from UEFI to BIOS. Linux can boot fine from a GPT disk in BIOS mode. See this question: Convert from EFI to BIOS boot mode\n\nA: Some secure boot machines cannot seem to boot Windows from grub.\nA workaround is to provide a different set of EFI files for each type \nof boot, putting the second set for Ubuntu on a USB stick, and \nleaving the EFI files on the hard disk for Windows.\nYou have a working Ubuntu set of EFI files already on the \nhard disk, so take a (small) USB stick (empty, as you will lose all data\non it), put a GPT partition table on it, and make a 250M partition for\nthe EFI files.  Copy the hard disk's EFI files to the stick.  They will\nappear in the /boot/efi directory, under the directory EFI.  \nTake the EFI\ndirectory and all its contents, and put it on the USB partition.\nI'd suggest editing the stick version of EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg to change\nthe name of the menu item \"Ubuntu\" to \"Ubuntu on USB\" or something to\nmake it obvious which set of files you are booting with. \nNow\ntry booting from the USB, and see if you get the altered menu item,\nand that it works.  When the USB boot is working, you may simply go\nto /boot/efi/EFI/Boot, which should be the hard disk's EFI partition, and\nit should contain copies (possibly with different names) of the Ubuntu\nversions of the boot files, which should also be in /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu.\nUse md5sum to confirm that you have copies of all files which are in \n/boot/efi/EFI/Boot, because you are going to delete them!  Copy and\nrename the file /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/bootxmgfw.efi to /boot/efi/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi\nand you should be able to boot windows from the hard disk again -- remove\nthe stick and try the Windows boot.\nWhen you update the kernel, and get a new grub.cfg generated on the hard \ndisk (unused, since the hard disk boots only Windows), you will have to\ncopy it yourself to the USB stick's EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg.\nHopefully, at some point, the issue of grub not booting Windows on your\nmachine will be fixed, and you can simply replace the hard disk's EFI/Boot\nfile with the ones on the stick's EFI/Boot.\nJust make sure you have copies of anything you delete, so you can replace them\nif necessary.  This technique worked for me on a Toshiba.\n\nA: Press and hold Shift during booting this should bring you the Grub Menu. Or if you just want the menu to appear always then edit your /etc/default/grub file \nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nInsert \"#\" at the start of the line GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0.\nNow save then run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis should be fine to make Grub menu appears on every boot.\nIt's better to take a look for this GRUB wiki https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2\n\nA: If you are using Bitlocker, you probably made some changes to the partitions right before installing Ubuntu (like freeing up unallocacted space for the Ubuntu installation), then you may get that problem because GRUB cannot deal with the security prompt that appears when starting windows that asks you for the bitlocker recovery key.\nI had almost the same problem after installing Ubuntu 16.04.02 alongside Windows 7. Ubuntu would start fine, but after choosing the Windows 7 loader from GRUB, the screen would show some strange pattern of regular multicolored skewed lines and stay stuck there until the processor fan would turn on and hot and I decided to shut down the computer to avoid damage.\nSalvation came from using Hiren's Boot CD and using the Boot Windows 7 option in the main menu therein, which allowed me to get to the prompt for the bitlocker recovery key, enter the key, suspend and resume bitlocker in my windows session, and use my dual boot system as intended afterwards.\n\nA: Make sure that the Windows 10 installation partition is still there and proceed according to this answer:\n\nThe default installation of Windows 10 requires a minimum of 4\n  partitions:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*sda1 (Recovery)\n  \n*sda2 (For computers that boot in EFI mode the EFI System Partition (ESP) is normally mounted at /boot/efi.)\n  \n*sda3 (MSR)\n  \n*sda4 (Windows OS, usually \"C\")\n  \n  \n  If the /boot/efi partition or the MSR partition has been damaged\n  or deleted during the Ubuntu installation, you might not be able to\n  see Windows in grub. Try the following command in Ubuntu to show all\n  the available partitions:\nsudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL\n\nIt should give you an idea of what happened to your system and allow\n  you to check if all the partitions are still there. You might try to\n  repair Windows with the Windows installation DVD/USB.\nYou can try to install the Grub Customizer application and see if Windows is available in\n  the list:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nThen you can launch Grub Customizer and change which operating systems are available to boot.\nHere's a screenshot of what a correct installation looks like:\n\n\n\nA: In my case I made clean install of Windows 7, left some space unallocated on SSD and during subsequent Mint 18.3 install with default \"Alongside\" option did not got Windows in grub boot menu.\nThe solution was simple: ran command below in Mint and Windows 7 was added to grub menu along with Memtest btw.\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem. After changing order of boot in bios, it booted on Windows but only on safe mode. To solve that I did Windows+R->msconfig->boot:normal. And everything was solved. Hope this can help.\n\nA: First try this source:\nInsert your Windows installation DVD/USB and boot from it. Choose your language and click Next. When prompted to Install now just look left down to that window and click Repair your computer. Wait and a new window will pop up with the operating systems installed in your PC. Click on Windows 7/8/10 and click Next. In the next window click Command prompt. When the command prompt appears type this:\nbootrec /fixboot\n\nPress Enter and type:\nbootrec /fixmbr\n\nPress Enter again and then close that command prompt window and restart your PC. Don't forget the space between bootrec and /.\nAfter that you will no longer have the option to choose between operating systems to boot on startup. You will have to repair grub. You can do that with an Ubuntu live DVD/USB. The easy way is after repairing the Windows bootloader, format the Ubuntu partition(s) and reinstall Ubuntu. To repair grub after repairing the Windows bootloader, try this. \nTo repair grub: \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the Ubuntu live DVD/USB.\n\n*Open the terminal and run sudo fdisk -l to see where Ubuntu is installed.\n\n*Run sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt where X is the partition number in which you found Ubuntu installed.\n\n*Run sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\nTo install grub:\n\n\n*Run sudo update-grub to update grub, and if this command didn't work run it after rebooting.\n\n*Reboot with sudo reboot.\nNote:\nFor me the command in  step 5. didn't work, so I restarted the computer and after restarting the computer booted directly to Ubuntu, so I logged in as root and ran this command:\nupdate-grub\n\nThat solved the problem.\n\nA: First we will bring back the windows MBR then we will reinstall the grub and bring linux back\nFixing Windows MBR(You can either go for solution 1 or solution 2 both works)\nBoot Linux and make sure you’ve a working Internet connection and type the following on the terminal.\n1.

Solution\nsudo apt-get install mbr\n\nIf the package got installed use following to write the MBR.\nsudo install-mbr -i n -p D -t 0 /dev/sda\n\nCommon for both\nReplace sda if you want to install the MBR to a different drive. Do not put sda1,sda2,  or sda3. Just put it as sda for the hard disk. \nNext we need to install the grub,rerunning the boot-repair will fix this and reinstall grub.Reboot and both will work\n\nA: All the options that you have tried seem to be for Windows 8 in mbr mode,\nbut you are using UEFI, so you should repair UEFI partition; when my windows bootloader got corrupted,\ni tried the following command.\nbcdboot c:\\windows /s f: /f ALL\n\nhere c:\\windows is the location of the windows folder on the windows (c:) partiton.\n/s is an option which allows to install the UEFI bootloader files on the UEFI System Partition , which is fat32 formatted and in my case was (/dev/sda4 ) so f:\n(f: is the letter of the uefi partiton)\nafter this command has executed you would get installtion successful/failed\nThis should re-install your windows 8 boot code in the UEFI partition.\nThis command i had tried when booting from the repair disk and select advanced option and then command line repair.\nYou can create a recovery disk by by going in the control panel, and choosing backup and recovery -> create recovery disk/usb or you could borrow it from someone.\nPS.\nIf you have not already tried, then you could try all the options displayed in your grub menu, particularly refind, which automatically detects all UEFI OS.\nYou could also try all the windows entries in the grub menu to check if any one of them works.\nThen you could switch your uefi mode to BIOS from your BIOS menu at system startup and then checkout what options its displaying there, and if any of them work.\n\nA: Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T Or Search Terminal in  Dash.\n\n*Enter the following command in Terminal:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n(This will open grub configuration file in gedit.)\n\n*Edit the file and change following options as following (remove comments # before any of below lines) and save the file:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0  \nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10  \n\n\n*Run the following command in new instance of terminal:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n*Restart your computer, you should be now able to boot Windows if you partitioned your system correctly\n\nA: I am going to make some assumptions:\n\n*\n\n*That Windows is installed and configured to boot via UEFI.\n\n*Ubuntu is installed and configured to boot via UEFI.\n\n*You're currently seeing the grub menu at boot.\n\n*After Windows has been upgrade to 2021 April?

When logged as this user I want the home directory, etc, for this user set up correctly until I log out. How do I do that?\nI tried \nsu -- username\n\nand then keying in the password, it did not produce any error but I saw no visible changes of the command prompt it would still say myname@myhost. The home directory also was that of myname and not the new login I tried to login as.\nI'm - as it's apparent now - quite inexperienced in linux/Ubuntu, so any info is welcome.\n\nA: To which user you want to change to?\nThe problem is that you are trying to \"su\" into a user that does not have a shell assigned to it. Most of the users such as mysql, pulse, etc, created by the system or by some packages when you install software does not have a shell assigned.\nYou can check if a user has a shell assigned by looking into the /etc/passwd file, just look at the end of the line of each user, if it says /bin/false it means that it does not have a shell assigned, if it has something like /bin/bash or any other shell, then you should be able to \"su\" into that user.\nWhen i say \"shell assigned\" it basically means that it has \"shell access\"\nstill if the user does not have shell access, you can always execute commands as that user with \n sudo -u user command\n\n\nA: if you have sudo access then I would recommend \nsudo su username -\nIt does basically the same thing, but only requires you to know your password not the other users. \nhowever if you have the other users password:\nsu username - should work just fine. \nnotice the 1 - and that it's at the end.\n", "Q: Max file size can recover on ext4 Is there a limitation for recovering big files on ext4 like ntfs ( 4 giga max )\n\nA: If you use testdisk and photorec, it is capable of recovering the file you are able to store on that file system, as long as it doesn't exceed the file system limitation, for ext4, max file size will be 16TiB (for 4KB block file system).\n", "Q: How can I change the settings in Crafty (chess engine) I use xboard as a GUI for Crafty, being Crafty a state of the art chess engine I don't want to use anything else, but it floods my home directory with game.nnn and log.nnn files. I would like to change the settings and have Crafty to save this files to a \"Folder1\" instead of my home directory.\n\nA: You can start crafty with the parameter log off. Parameters can be put into the crafty.rc file, or used as start-up parameters from the terminal. The files you see created are created by the parameter log. This is by default set to on. There is an alphabetical list of all the options here. It does not look like you can not put those log files somewhere else. \nThe most important parameter for these  log.{nnn} files is:\n\nlog off|on|{n}\n\nThis command is used to disable logging. The default is log on, which causes Crafty to produce a new log.nnn file for each game played. If you are running Crafty on a server, you might use log off, which disables creating these files as well as the game.nnn files used to restart a game after you exit Crafty and come back later. If you use the form log n Crafty will simply display the last n lines of the log on the screen. If you use log n file Crafty will copy the last n lines of the log to file which could be your hard drive, or a floppy.\nNote that if you run with log off, you will be unable to find out what Crafty was thinking about since there is no other record of the game. You will always see a game.001 because as Crafty plays a game, this contains all the real moves played so far so that you can back up if needed. you will also see a log.001 file, but it will be empty.\n\nAlternative: create a script that moves all the log files to your directory before starting crafty or when crafty stops. That way you have then in your folder in bulk and you can keep logging on.\n\nA: From \"man crafty\":\n   Logging\n       When  a game is played, Crafty normally writes \"logpath/game.<nnn>\" and\n       \"logpath/log.<nnn>\". Details of what is written are modifiable  by  the\n       `log'  command. Because $CRAFTY_LOG_DIR defaults to \"./\" (the directory\n       in which Crafty is launched), trouble  can  occur  if  the  program  is\n       launched  in a directory to which it is unable to write.  Note that the\n       \"log.<nnn>\" file normally contains all output that would be visible  if\n       Crafty  were run from the command line but is usually hidden when it is\n       run from a GUI.\n\nSo, you may define CRAFTY_LOG_DIR in your ~/.bashrc. I'd put the crafty logs in $HOME/var/log/crafty, and set it up by adding the following to ~/.bashrc:  \n[[ -d $HOME/var ]] || mkdir -m 0700 $HOME/var\n[[ -d $HOME/var/log ]] || mkdir -m 0700 $HOME/var/log\n[[ -d $HOME/var/log/crafty ]] || mkdir -m 0700 $HOME/var/log/crafty\nexport CRAFTY_LOG_DIR=\"$HOME/var/log/crafty/\"\n\nTo avoid filling $HOME/var/log/crafty/ with log files, set up \"Log Rotation\". Read man logrotate and man logrotate.conf.\n", "Q: How to install vanilla version of Firefox on Ubuntu? I get daily crashes with Firefox on Ubuntu. Almost every time I start Ubuntu and then try to launch Firefox, it causes X to crash out immediately. Sometimes I have to log in three or four times before Firefox actually loads. These crashes are obviously causing me to lose any work I haven't saved in other apps. As you can imagine, that is a tad frustrating.\nI suspect the crashes might be something to do with the Flash side of things because sometimes when I try to visit a website with Flash content such as bbc iplayer, the dreaded black screen of death appears instantly. \nI know that Ubuntu makes modifications to Mozilla's version of Firefox, so I wondered if I could try running a plain Mozilla version of Firefox without modifications to see if that would work. Could anyone tell me how to achieve this?\n\nA: Most likely crashes are caused by plugins, you can try to disable unnecessary plugins.\nTry to use flash block plugins to disable Flashes (click to play any flash, in my case, I don't even install Flash for Firefox, I use Chrome's built-in flash module anyway...).\nVanilla version won't really help.\nI would recommend backing up your firefox profile\n~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default\n\nUse profile manager to create a new profile and start with that one (you can still switch back and forth)\nfirefox -profilemanager\n\nhttp://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_Manager\nIf you want to have vanilla Firefox binaries (I don't think it'll help), download from:\nhttp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/16.0.2/linux-x86_64/en-US/\nuntar firefox-16.0.2.tar.bz2 to your preferred folder, for example:\ncd /opt && tar axvf firefox-16.0.2.tar.bz2\n\nUse ./firefox to start the vanilla Firefox.\n\nA: This might happen due to a lot of reasons.

From their perspective it is mounted just in my profile and not in theirs.\nI have tried editing the properties of the hdd to allow others to view and create files on the hdd but that has not changed anything. I have also read that this is a new feature to Ubuntu 12.10, the way it mounts via /media/[user]/.\nSo is there a way to have it mount to all the other user accounts too?\nThanks!\n\nA: one simple and best solution would be to give full permission to /media, since its a family pc and none else will use. it can be done by \nsudo chmod 777 /media\nif asked for password give it. to do this you need to have admin privileges.\n", "Q: Install Eclipse Classic 4.2.1 in ubuntu 10,04 I download Eclipse Classic 4.2.1 from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ and it is not .deb, it is .tar.gz. how can i install this package??\n\nA: Eclipse doesn't really need 'installation' if you download it from the Eclipse website. You can simply extract it from the terminal like so:\ntar -xzf elipse.tar.gz\n\nOnce extracted, your home directory is a good place to put the eclipse program folder.\nAlternatively, you can choose to have the package manager install Eclipse by running:\nsudo apt-get install eclipse\n\nAlthough, that will effectively require you do download it again.\n\nA: you need not install. just right click and extract it.you will find a file called eclipse which is an executable.Just run that.Some times you need to give the execute permissions to the file. that can be done in permissions tab of its properties(right-click properties) window. \n", "Q: Copying to ntfs from ubuntu slower than ext4 - why? Is copying to ext4 faster than copying to ntfs, because I was making new containers today on ext4 speed was 45Mb on ntfs same container size speed 14Mb, both containers where madden from ubuntu with truecrypt 7.0, Is there Difference in coping speed between ext4 and ntfs, or ubuntu handle copying to ntfs slower?\n\nA: Ubuntu made copying to NTFS slower\nNTFS is implemented in Linux using a non native driver. One would expect it is not faster than a native implementation. Its not that we made it this way, its just the way it is.\nThink the question should be: Is copying using Ubuntu's ntfs-3g driver slower than when you do it with other distros? The answer should, and within specs will be, no.\n\nA: NTFS in Ubuntu is implemented using FUSE (Filesystem In Userspace, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace).  Thus file I/O and metadata has to transfer to and fro between kernel and userspace which can create context switching and will consume more CPU than a native kernel based file system.  Some anecdotal evidence shows that NTFS using FUSE is similar in performance to other FUSE based file systems (such as ZFS) and there are reports that FUSE based NTFS consumes more CPU than the Windows equivalent. \n", "Q: Is it possible to set up a second monitor/display that doesn't change when switching desktop on your main with unity's desktop wall?

It happened to me. A simple command can fix the problem:\nsudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\n\nA: There seems to be nothing wrong with your Virtual Box settings. However the error you see may be related to a previous fail to install Windows leaving unwanted reference to this installation in your Virtual Box settings (that are usually and correctly located in your $HOME). \nThe issue also may also have come from an installation to a removable drive. Installing the virtual disk .vdi file to an external USB drive is possible but it may lead to unwanted side effects from changed media location or mount points. In addition we then need to make sure the virtualbox user has read and write access to this external drive. Also we obviously should then not access this USB drive from the virtual OS.\nTo solve the issue you may find a solution in the following question where people recommend reinstalling Virtual Box:\n\n\n*\n\n*Getting error message when trying to start a virtual machine\n\nA: I had installed VirtualBox from universal repository, and I solved with this command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-dkms\n\n\nA: The most simple decision, that i found:\n\n\n*\n\n*enter into the folder /home/$user/.VirtualBox/\n\n*find there file VirtualBox.xml-prev, this is backed up the configurations of Virtual Box\n\n*delete VirtualBox.xml\n\n*and change name VirtualBox.xml-prev to VirtualBox.xml.\n\n\nA: The file /home/$user/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml is not valid. It's not valid XML. More then likely you edited the file by hand or some other tool did. \nYour ram sizes and everything else seem fine. \nCan you pastie the config file, maybe it's something easy we can fix.\n\nA: This happened to me when the user (defined by VBOXWEB_USER in /etc/init.d/virtualbox) had no home directory. Re-creating the user, with a home directory, resolved the issue.\n\nA: If you're using Oracle Virtualbox you can try recompiling everything by running /sbin/vboxconfig as root which executes vboxdrv.sh.\nThis works with Ubuntu 16.04 and Virtualbox 5.1\n\nA: I had such an error because ~/.config/VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml was empty. Just deleting it made it work for me.\n\nA: I got this problem and my VirtualBox was installed from VirtualBox.org. I installed(didn't bother to uninstall) VirtualBox again using\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\nAnd this started working fine, yeah!!!\n\nA: My perspective in general for all errors, missing files/packages,etc; is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart into the most updated generic linux headers (recovery mode)\n\n*Do the following in order: \ncheck file system checker\nrepair broken packages\nclean system\n\n\n*Resume boot\n\n*restart again as in the standard grub boot loader\n\n*Start virtual box again and solved.\nI feel this goes for most problems and bypasses researching and entering codes when it does everything for you (finding missing files and repairs them, repairs pakcges, and cleans out the unneccesary)\n\nA: This issue happened to me after the process of setting up a virtual machine failed. \nIt was resolved after deleting (or renaming) the /home/{user}/.config/Virtualbox folder\n\nA: Solutions varies from people.\nSome problems of hardware occured that the disk where I installed my virtual machines became read-only\nI booted that disk (windows 10) and reboot back, trying to remove the problems.\nIt worked.\nI found that when I attempted to apply changes of my virtual machine.\n\nA: Had this same problem on a Mac OS I removed the VirtualBox.xml and it then\nrm VirtualBox.xml\n\n\nA: dpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-dkms\nservice virtualbox restart\n\n\nA: I had the same issue in a dual boot environment. Disk was used in Windows 10, shut down (without shift), the disk is locked in Ubuntu, started Ubuntu, attempted to start the VM and error came up. To fix I had to boot back in Windows 10, shut down properly (with shift pressed) then came back to Ubuntu and started VM without issues.\n\nA: Hopefully this helps someone. I had the same error message. In my case, I was dual booting Linux and Windows. The .vdi file was on another partition. Even shutting down Windows properly did not solve it. On Linux I used this command:\nsudo ntfsfix /dev/sda1\n\nAfter that I was able to boot the VM as usual.\n\nA: The solution for me (VirtualBox 6.1) was to install the last version of the Extension Pack @ https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\n\nA: For me it has been an issue with the enabled USB 3.0 Controller Mode. When I disabled the USB controller I have been able to start the VM and this strange NS_ERROR_FAILURE disappeared.\nAfter that I simple re-install / update the \"Extension Pack\" in order to enable again the USB 3.0 support. See also How to set up USB for Virtualbox? in case you are not familiar with that.\nMay be it helps\n\nA: Run the following commands in terminal:\nls -la .VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml*\ncp .VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml-prev .VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml\n\n\nA: For me installing from .run file instead of .deb archive worked fine. You can find it under \"All distributions\" link on virtualbox downloads page (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)\n\nA: sudo /etc/init.d/virtualbox setup\nFor me this fixed the issue.

So how to install and run UNetBootin?\n\nA: Install UNetbootin in Ubuntu\nUsing these few commands, downloading and running it will work.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gezakovacs/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unetbootin\n\nAdding repository is necessary for updates and support for older versions of Ubuntu.\n\nA: As commented in your question by Web-E , you should just add the executable permission to the file downloaded from SourceForge, then you are able to run it (no installation needed, btw). I had the same problem and that comment gave me the solution, without the need to add the ppa. \nIf you don't want to use terminal, you can right-click the file unetbootin-linux-585, select \"properties\", go to \"permissions\" and then tick \"allow execution of the file as a program\" (or something like that, i don't have an english-language o.s.).  \nEDIT:\nAs suggested in the comment below, here's a little how-to about making a file executable:\nTo make the file executable via terminal (and we are here supposing you downloaded that file using a browser like Firefox or Opera), you only have to go to the folder where the file resides, right-click on the folder and select \"Open terminal here\". When you have the terminal shell, don't forget to run\nls -l\n\nto make sure the file is really here, and to check permissions. You should see something like\n-rw-r--r-- 1 name name 4478124 lug 11 15:28 unetbootin-linux-585\n\nwhich means you have to add execution permissions on it. How you do it? Simply typing:\nchmod +x unetbootin-linux-585\n\n(don't forget to use Tab to autocomplete the long unetbootin name :P). \nNow, checking again the file with ls -l should give the following result:\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 name name 4478124 lug 11 15:28 unetbootin-linux-585\n\nThis means that the program became executable, so just type:\n./unetbootin-linux-585\n\nto run the application. \nHope everything is clear. \n\nA: Use this command in the terminal to install using ppa\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:n-muench/programs-ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unetbootin\n\n\nA: Installing UNetbootin via PPA\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gezakovacs/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unetbootin\n\nNote:\nIn Ubuntu <18.04, we can directly install UNetbootin with single command\nsudo apt-get install unetbootin\n\nBut UNetbootin is unavailable from the standard Ubuntu >= 18.04 repositories, due to requiring now-deprecated dependencies (e.g., gksu, kdesudo). The standard UNetbootin PPA, which explicitly supports Ubuntu >= 18.04, should be leveraged instead.\n\nA: Installing UNetBootin appears to be pretty simple, you can either install it via the source from sourceforge.net or using PPA, easy one will be PPA\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:n-muench/programs-ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unetbootin\n\nAnd to use UNetbootin, there is basically two different option, one is to install downloading the distribution as mentioned by the UNetbootin itself and next is to select Disk Image and choose ISO files.\nSee full tutorial on How to install and use UNetbootin in Ubuntu 14.04?\n", "Q: System will not resolve domain.local websites I have done a brand new installation of the Ubuntu server (v12.10) with bind configured to have a dns zone of gdos.local and apache configured for said domain.\nWith a brand new installation of Ubuntu desktop LTS I try to connect to www.gdos.local and all I get is:\nServer not found\n          Firefox can't find the server at www.gdos.local.\n          Check the address for typing errors such as \n          ww.example.com instead of www.example.com \nHowever if I change the domain to gdos.tmp and type in www.gdos.tmp, I get the internal website. If I change it to mybusiness.local , I get the same error message.\nIf I use a Microsoft os, this works fine, all three domains resolve to a webpage.\nI have searched the internet flat for the past week on dns issues but have not come up with a solution.\nI have followed instructions from removing dnsmasq to editing like resolv.conf (in some very strange places) and I still have no joy on getting the .local domain extension to work.\nI can safely say the issue is not with the server but with the desktops because if the issue was server related the Microsoft OS's would not resolve it either.\nI have done several installs of the desktop in an effort to make sure that I did not break anything while trying to fix this.\nPlease can anyone point to a workable solution for fixing the .local domain extension.\n\nA: The short answer is to use something other than .local.\n.local is used by Avahi by default; Avahi is the GPL implementation of Zeroconf -- see the Wikipedia article.\nThere's a brief guide here which describes reconfiguring avahi-daemon to use something other than .local. You'd need to do this on all your Ubuntu desktops.\nOther possibilities are not to run avahi-daemon or to change /etc/nsswitch.conf to remove references to mdns.\nDisclaimer: I haven't tried any of the above.\n", "Q: watch the file changes in Ubuntu I'm worried about my Windows apps modifying the files in Ubuntu, as there is software in Windows that can see and can modify files on the Linux partition. Can files or applications run normally in Ubuntu after modifying? If so, how can I watch the files for changes in Ubuntu?\n\nA: You can use auditd or inotify to monitor file changes.\n\nA: Altrough you question is ambigous, I will give you a method to monitor your files.   \nIf you want to see the list of files modified you can use the  \nfind / -type f -mtime -1 \nfor example, in this case those modified in the last 1 day.\n\nA: In general, yes, files on Ubuntu will be fine if they're modified in a way they're intended to be, even though it's from Windows. For example, editing an image with Photoshop.\nHowever, there are a bunch of little exceptions, and the only way to find out for sure is to experiment:\n\n\n*\n\n*The safety of your Linux partition will depend on the quality of the Windows filesystem driver: will it correctly use the journaling? Adjust the timestamps appropriately? Will it lose data, or is it rock solid? Etc. Personally, I'd look into exactly who made the Windows software which will be used to mount the Linux partitions.\n\n*Some file types are platform independent (e.g. png), but some are not (e.g. text). If you edit a Linux text file in Wordpad, you may find that every line looks odd because line endings are different in the two systems.\n\n*There are other odd exceptions such as Linux filenames always being case sensitive, while this is not the case for all Windows filesystems. And so small little oddities can creep up.\nMost of these issues aren't tragic and can be easily corrected or worked around.

That part works in your case, otherwise it would output a different error message than what the question shows.\nThe error message in the question:\n\npsql: FATAL:  Ident authentication failed for user \"postgres\"\n\n\nrelates to the fact that only the Unix user postgres has the permission to connect as the database user postgres when using a Unix-domain socket.

So then I popped in my Ubuntu ready installer (USB flashdrive) and I was unable to format the filesystem, it had an output of asking drive if cache failed or something and eventually said that the filesystem couldn't be created.\nI went ahead and popped in my Windows 7 DVD and it formatted it without any issues, and I am now standing on Ubuntu 12.04 in working order.\nNOTE: Ubuntu 12.10 had all of its updates installed and had various apps like VLC, SMPlayer, WINE, and various other typical things.

So I'd rather seek out to a community I know is active and alert.\n\nA: \nIt reported an I/O error on sda1 repeatedly.\n\nThen it's not a filesystem issue, but a failing drive (or I/O controller).

Out of 4 mounted device if suppose C2 has a problem, the script terminate the c2 and try to move the content to c3 and c4. I am struggling this place. If you know let me.\nNote: I can understand -f means force, if an existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it  and try again . \nWhat argument i need to use for copy the content to mounted folder, if any network issues happen, it need to terminate that copying folder.\n\nA: Much that I love python, this isn't really a case for which it is needed. The problem here is that when an smb connection fails, cp operations freeze rather than terminate. Neither python nor bash will detect this.\nSo, you could start all jobs in parallel\nuser@host:~$ for dest in /media/Client_{1,2,3,4}; do cp -f sourcepath/* $dest & done\n\nBut this will probably choke your network. A better option may be to let cp run for an expected duration and then have it killed if it has frozen\nuser@host:~$ for dest in /media/Client_{1,2,3,4}; do timeout -k 9 30m cp -f sourcepath/* $dest; done\n\nWhich will kill the cp command with SIGKILL (signal 9) after 30 minutes if it has hung.\nHowever, if needing to restart the transfer is a frequent problem, you probably want to use rsync instead of cp, which will check what has already been copied and resume wherever it got to.\n", "Q: My ATI graphics card gets very hot and Ubuntu freezes I`m Using 12.10 on my Desktop.

Try removing the fan and then carefully use a vacuum cleaner to remove all the dust.\nIf there is no clogging and the fan is spinning slowly, the problem could be the fan itself. Too much dust inside the fan itself could be a problem. Spraying some oil into it might help, or you could just replace the fan completely.\n", "Q: How to install software from old repository?

This may mean that you have\nrequested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\ndistribution that some required packages have not yet been created\nor been moved out of Incoming.\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n appscale-core : Depends: sun-java6-jdk but it is not installable\n                 Depends: libboost-filesystem1.40.0 but it is not installable\n                 Depends: libboost-serialization1.40.0 but it is not installable\n                 Depends: libboost-thread1.40.0 but it is not installable\n                 Depends: libboost-program-options1.40.0 but it is not installable\n                 Depends: libboost-iostreams1.40.0 but it is not installable\n                 Depends: libboost-python1.40.0 but it is not installable\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nMy system is fully updated and upgraded, so I doubt that I indeed have broken packages.\nI've been in this situation before, that I had a repository that only existed up to some version lower than the current (LTS) version.\nIs there a general way for resolving this?\n\nA: The problem is that the package you are trying to install is old and their dependencies cannot be satisfied. Probably because the libraries you have installed in your system are more up to date than the ones the package needs, or they are not available anymore (like sun-java6-jdk).\nI guess you have three options here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try the manual installation using the .tar.gz provided here;\n\n*Using gem to install it (gem is something like an apt-get for ruby). I don't know if this installs what you need or just some management tools/libraries, but you can try it:\nsudo gem install appscale-tools\n\n\n*Install that package in a Ubuntu Lucid system, which you can have in your current system using virtualization (ex: VirtualBox, LXC, or even a chroot may work)\nHope this helps.\n\nA: You add\ndeb http://appscale.cs.ucsb.edu/appscale_packages lucid stable\n\nto your resources but where do you expect your system to find the dependencies?\nThe package inside that PPA require you to install \nsun-java6-jdk \nlibboost-filesystem1.40.0  this yeilds dependencies for:\n    libboost-system1.40.0 (>= 1.40.0-1) \n    libc6 (>= 2.3.6-6~) \n    libgcc1 (>= 1:4.1.1)\n    libstdc++6 (>= 4.1.1) \nlibboost-serialization1.40.0 \nlibboost-thread1.40.0 \nlibboost-program-options1.40.0\nlibboost-iostreams1.40.0 \nlibboost-python1.40.0 \n\nbut apt-get can not find these packages since we moved to newer version of these packages they have not been available since Lucid.\nThe suggested installation method from the appscale wiki is: \ntar xzvf appscale-tools.tar.gz\ncd appscale-tools\nsudo bash debian/appscale_build.sh\n\nSee if this works.\n\nA: The problem in this case is not your packages are broken, but that the package you are trying to install apparently is designed to work with older versions of packages than are available in precise.\nIt is possible to install an old .deb file, ignoring dependency errors with sudo dpkg --ignore-depends -i package.deb. However, chances are this will not work - if the package includes any binary files the library versions they require at runtime (starting from glibc and working upwards) will be incorrect, or configuration files will be in the wrong place. Basically, you're in for a world of pain and it breaks the point of apt which is meant to ensure all your packages are mutually compatible. \nHowever, if you're feeling bloodyminded openjdk-6-jdk should be a drop-in replacement for sun java, and you can try installing the current version of libboost and making symlinks to fake having an older version installed.

Change it to any other directory which is available in your Linux file system. It would help you in next steps.\n\n\nIf the above does not work after executing it, install an extension for Nautilus:  \nsudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal\n\nAfter that logout and login again. Now go to your CS folder and right-click in an empty space, you will now see an option that says \"Open in Terminal\".\n\nThis is a quick way to get to a folder without typing too much (Easier for beginners). When the terminal opens, type wine cstrike.exe. This should give you the information needed to know why cstrike is not working.\nA common problem is a missing DLL Library (Pretty common actually). The solution is to just copy the missing DLL to the game folder.\nFor example, this is the output I got with a friends CS:\n$ wine cstrike.exe \nfixme:service:scmdatabase_autostart_services Auto-start service L\"SecDrv\" failed to start: 2\nerr:module:import_dll Library MSVBVM60.DLL (which is needed by L\"F:\\\\Half-Life\\\\cstrike.exe\") not found\nerr:module:LdrInitializeThunk Main exe initialization for L\"F:\\\\Half-Life\\\\cstrike.exe\" failed, status c0000135\n\nIf you read through the lines you will see that it says wine had an error while trying to import the MSVBVM60.DLL file. Google this file and paste it in the game folder where cstrike.exe resides. The DLL-files.com is a good place to start.\nAfter pasting it in your game folder, the game should work:\n\n", "Q: Authentication Failure when using any VNC Viewer (Windows) with VNC Server on Ubuntu 12.04 I'm new to VNC on Linux and have been following these general instructions to try connect to my Ubuntu 12.04 VPS and view the Linux GUI, but have been getting authentication failure messages when trying to login:\n\n\n*\n\n*I log in to my Linux VPS and start VNC Server on my Linux VPS:   \n\nvncserver\n\n\n*I then set and verify my password \"to access my desktops\", which I do.\n\n*The vncserver is then started under some new 'X' desktop name, e.g. vps:1\n\n*I use nmap to view which port this new X desktop is running on e.g.\n\nnmap localhost \n\n\n*I run VNC viewer (TightVNC Viewer, RealVNC Viewer) on my Windows 7 PC and connect to the Ubuntu VPS with the given port\n\n*Enter my password from step 2. after successfully connecting to the VPS\n\n*Get \"Authentication failed\" messages over and over again.\nGoing crazy now.

The thing is that playing games with wine often needs very specific settings for each game. And the playonlinux project provides a solution for that. They offer installer scripts that take care of some proven-to-work settings for each game, PoL has a GUI to keep the overview over different games and programs you installed and it provides a way to easily switch beetween different versions of wine without reinstalling (because sometimes you get regressions with newer wine versions for some games!). \nSorry I don't have the time to provide screenshots right now but have a look at their website. they have a PPA to integrate into your softwarecenter (though at the moment you have to take the PPA for 12.04 but this one works fine) or you download the ubuntu .deb file from their website. \nDon't get fooled by the simplistic look - you can adjust anything manually after any installation via the GUI and if you want to get really into things their is a plugin system to add more Wine tools. \nThe program takes care of downloading and managing different wine versions. It also takes care of dependencies while it doesn't touch your systems wine verions installation. \nhope that helps, \npiedro\n", "Q: How to send magic package to windows xp Hi Is there a program which can send magic package to wake on lan Windows XP computer ?

On Windows the Steam client allows me to link non Steam games so that I can use the client as a launcher for all my games in my system.\nCan that be done also in the Linux client for my Wine / PlayonLinux games? How?\n\nA: If your Wine or PlayOnLinux games provide a launcher, then it should work as in Windows. As an example, adding Mahjongg to the Steam games list:\n\nAll the applications that appear on the Dash should be listed here. If the launcher is not on the list, one can use the \"Browse\" button to locate it (using wine they should be located in ~/.local/share/applications/wine).

Foobar2000 volume slider stopped working in Wine\nSound is good but volume cannot be changed from the player's slider anymore.\nIs there a setting in Wine that might have entailed this?\nI have tested [Vineyard][1] (also) and then gave it up on which occasion some setting in Wine might have been altered but cannot see which.\nEdit:\nThis affects the main installation (v.1.1.15) made in Wine, and also portable installations of the same version (as well as portable installations of v.1.1.14 and 1.1.17b that I tested) but does not affect older versions like 1.0.3.\nAfter testing more versions, it seems that the newest version without this problem is 1.1. (That is, before the version that changed the classic white-on-black Foobar2000 icon with the new white one.)\n\nA: As we have discussed various things in the comments without success, what might work is to create a new wineprefix and then install and run foobar always from that prefix. That may allow you to continue using foobar without reinstalling wine, as the corrupted settings may be present in the original .wine folder.\nCreate your wine prefix with:\nWINEPREFIX=$HOME/.foobar winecfg\n\nThen you can temporarily export the location to the environment:\nexport WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.foobar\n\n(see my note below re using export and env)\nThen cd to your newly downloaded version of Foobar2000 and run the install:\nwine foobar2000_v1.1.17.exe\n\nI had to logout and login before I launched the program, or I experienced some odd errors and heavy disk activity. That was probably my system however.\nNow if you have logged out, open terminal and run the export command again and then enter\nwine \"c:\\\\Program files\\\\foobar2000\\\\foobar2000.exe\" \n\nTo alter any settings in this new prefix, you can just run\nwinecfg\n\nas long as the prefix is exported to the environment as above.\n\nNote: I have specified to export the WINEPREFIX environmental variable above; an equally valid method would be to use env, and often using env is very useful as it does not rely on the variable having already been set with export. The WINEPREFIX specified with env is used for that command-line only, whereas using export means that variable becomes the default environmental variable and thus would have to be unset if a different WINEPREFIX was needed to be used. \nSome example usage of env:\nenv WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.special <wine commands>\n\n\nYou will also have to modify the foobar location in the script I recently discussed in my other answer by adding the following, modified for your system, under the shebang at the top of the script:\nexport WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.foobar\ncd /home/mike/.foobar/drive_c/Program\\ Files/foobar2000/\n\n\nThis is definitely one way to get fresh settings without reinstalling wine and removing your .wine folder, and it should make foobar work correctly again, and can be repeated for many different wine programs: see the Wine FAQ.\n\nA: The problem with the volume control appeared for me, too. I changed lots of audio settings in wine and foobar2000, but nothing worked. Then I remembered, that i changed in the wine settings the windows version from Windows XP to Windows 7. Resetting it to Windows XP solved the problem for me.\n\nA: Change the windows Version in Wine configuration under the Applications tab. I had it on windows 7 and the volume slider as well as the Data output format under playback/output in Foobar2000 preferences did not work. I switched it to Windows xp and it now works again. Good deal because it was killing the Sound quality of my Bowers & Wilkins MM-1 speakers. I know they say that I should put the Data output format on 16 Bit however the sound quality was lacking depth. 24 or 32 bit sound waaaaaaaaaaay better.

But I also have tried to configure them with XHCI Preboot mode disabled.\nHave any one solved a similar problem?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If the following does not work then I suggest you read How do I report a bug?\nSome users have reported the same issues on Windows 7 & Windows 8. The solution was doing the first 2 steps provided in here which were basically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update the BIOS\n\n*Make sure that in the BIOS (After upgrading it) you check that in Advanced -> Chipset -> Southbridge the option USB 1.1 OHCI Controllers and USB 2.0 EHCI Controllers are \"enabled\". Of course, there are a couple of K55VD Models, so this applies to some of them.\nThe general idea is to do the steps for the BIOS. If it works great. If not, you have just found a bug my friend. So file the bug using the link above and a developer will help.\n", "Q: Boot path not found, cannot start OS My desktop is 12.04 64bit, and it cannot boot from the hard drive anymore.

I do not know why this is happening, but need to fix it because it used to boot up normally. What I need to know is how to fix it. \nI can boot into a live DVD. Also, there were a few boots I would attempt to boot into a live USB, then it would boot to the hard drive, but that does not work any more.\nSo with the live DVD (it is an 10.04 LTS 32bit), is there any means to correct the boot path from the live DVD?\nThank you for your time and answers.\n\nA: Yes, you can access your files from the live DVD : go to the disk and open the \"home\" folder. In it are all the users' files.\nWere you doing anything such as installing something or uninstalling something when you hit the switch? That could be the cause.\nYou cannot repair from the live CD with a clear function, but I'm sure this \"boot path\" it's looking for is something to change in the BIOS, given the fact that the BIOS is the one looking for the boot path. I had this error once and my only solution was reinstalling Ubuntu after backing up my files...\nEDIT : If you upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or 12.10 you can choose \"upgrade but keep my files\".

Hi I looked at upgrading to 12.10 today, and got the warning that my graphics hardware may not be fully supported. \nI'm using an HP Pavilion dv5000 laptop with a Nvidia 9800 graphics card.\nHas anyone upgraded despite the warning and had un-fixable problems, or does anyone have any tips for getting round this problem, perhaps using unity 2d, or some idea about the timescale this is likely to be fixed on.\n\nA: I received the same message trying to upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 on a Vizio ultrabook. But running 12.10 from a dvd (which I'm doing right now) seems to work fine. Have you tried running from a dvd or usb drive?

Also, do you think that upgrading will resolve my problem or does it come from something else?\nThanks, mjchopperboy\n\nA: If you are uncertain, there is no harm in trying the 64-bit version. If your machine turns out to be 32-bit only, the installer will simply fail right at the beginning while letting you know that you have the wrong version of the kernel.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try installing 64-bit version.\n\n*If it fails, install 32-bit version. No harm done.\n\n\nA: 64 bit is about memory addressing. So if your computer has more than 4 gig memory you use 64bit if less you use 32 bit. There is no command that will tell you if you are compatible.\nBest thing to do is use the \"Live CD\" and test it out. That way you can see if its compatible with your wifi and screen which are the most important aspect.\n", "Q: Installing Skype on 12.10 64 bit causes errors I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 64bit (clean install) and updated it. \nAfter that i tried to install skype, and i get error that skype depends skype-bin, but it could not install it, and that there are some broken packages!?\nIn Ubuntu software center there is no skype.

It is currently running on a WAMP server, with an ODBC connection to the adb file. How can i create an ODBC connection on Ubuntu for the Access database? At this point, i'm open to having the DB live locally on my Ubuntu server, or on an SMB share somewhere. \nMoving it from Access to MySql has already been proposed. It may come down to that, but i'm really being pressured to find another option. Does anyone know if this is possible and how to accomplish it?\n\nA: Your options for replacing the JET database engine running purely in Linux are slim at best.  Remember access files are just flat files, and it is a piece of software provided by Microsoft that actually parses and runs the SQL commands.  Microsoft unsurprisingly does not provide a Linux port.  \nMysql and PHP are a match made in heaven, so you might consider the switch.  If the PHP code is good, the switch will be painless.\n\nA: You can move from MS Access to MSSQL or MySQL or PostgreSQL, but you'll have to move it somewhere if you want PHP under Linux to be able to read it.\nThere are cookbook recipes all over the place for accessing Jet databases from PHP, but they're red herrings - they all assume you're running PHP on a Windows machine with MS Access installed, and use the Windows-only ODBC driver for opening Jet (\"access\") files which is bundled with Access.  No good to you on Linux.\n\nA: Read this link:\nAccessing Microsoft SQL Server from PHP on Ubuntu using PDO, ODBC and FreeTDS\nhttps://secure.kitserve.org.uk/content/accessing-microsoft-sql-server-php-ubuntu-using-pdo-odbc-and-freetds\nfollow these instructions to access SQL Server databases from PHP on your Ubuntu server:\nInstall the packages freetds-bin, freetds-common, tdsodbc, odbcinst, php5-odbc and unixodbc. This provides the libraries you need.\nCopy the contents of /usr/share/doc/freetds-common/examples/odbcinst.ini into /etc/odbcinst.ini. This registers the FreeTDS driver with the ODBC layer.\nRestart your webserver to load the ODBC module into PHP.\n\nThat's it! You should now be up and running. Try testing the database connection with something like this:\n<?php\ntry\n{\n$db = new PDO('odbc:Driver=FreeTDS; Server=hostname_or_ip; Port=port; Database=database_name; UID=username; PWD=password;');\n}\ncatch(PDOException $exception)\n{\ndie(\"Unable to open database.<br>Error message:<br><br>$exception.\");\n}\necho '<h1>Successfully connected!</h1>';\n$query = 'SELECT * FROM table_name';\n$statement = $db->prepare($query);\n$statement->execute();\n$result = $statement->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_NUM);\n?>\n\n", "Q: Moving screenshots from one folder to another instantly I am hosting a gaming site and once in a while the server automatically creates a screenshot in the servers folder. \nUnfortunately it is NOT possible to configure in the server settings where it puts these screenshots; it just always dumps the PNG file in the server config folder.\nMy folder structure is for example as follows:\n/home/Game/Server1/\n\nWhat I would like to achieve is that once the server creates a screenshot in 1 of these server folders (I have multiple), the operating system moves the screenshot immediately (it's always a *.png file) to the webserver folder, for example:\n/var/www/Server1/filename.png\n\nSo that players can see the screenshot on the website.\nAnyone any idea on how I can tackle this problem the smartest way?

What I want is to be able to play music in background in the same terminal and get to write some commands while it is playing. Is it possible or not? If yes, how do I do that? \n\nA: You could use screen. It allows you to to open multiple terminals encapsulated in virtual terminal. After you've installed it (sudo apt-get install screen), you can start it simply with screen. You can start your music and then hold Ctrl and press A and D consecutively to detach the screen. Then you can continue working in the terminal you started screen from. If you want the screen terminal back, just run screen -r. This works only if you have only one screen session open otherwise you have to provide the id of the screen.\nYou can do a lot more with screen but for starters this information should help you solve your problem.\nPS: Consider that the screen session keeps running even if you close the terminal you started it from.

See this help page.\nQuoting here:\n\nNumlock on Apple Wireless Keyboard\nIf the Apple Wirelesss Keyboard stops working after log-in where most\n  keys do not work and some keys on the right side produce numbers, it\n  is because numlock is enabled by default.

If this doesn't work then perform a hard reset, press and hold the volume down button, and then press and hold the power button until the device is reset, showing the Google logo, indicating the bootloader is up.\n", "Q: Stop/start battery charging through software? If a laptop is powered on and connected to AC power, is there a way to issue a command that tells it not to charge the battery?\nEDITED:\nPerhaps charging of the battery may be stopped if there were a way to fool the system into thinking the battery is already at 100% charge.\n\nA: On Thinkpad devices, you can control the start and stop of the battery charging in Ubuntu. Run these commands in your terminal to install tp-smapi:\nsudo apt-get install tp-smapi-dkms\nsudo modprobe tp_smapi\n\nThen write your desired charging thresholds (your own values) to the virtual files in /sys/devices/platform/smapi:\necho 10 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/start_charge_thresh\necho 100 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/stop_charge_thresh\n\nIn the above commands you can change the values 10 and 100 to any value. The first one will help you to choose at what level charging must start and the second value will let you choose at what level charging must stop.\n\nA: You can't disable charging using any known software interface from user space. As it is, the battery controls from /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0 are static and dynamic readings as returned from the ACPI _BIF, _BIX and _BST controls, these are read only.  \nThere are no ACPI controls that allow you to disable battery charging and on all the common x86 mobile platforms I've ever worked on the battery controls are not exposed. \nNormally this data comes from a battery gas gauge and are read using bit-banging i2c usually by an embedded controller.  So you realistically have very little chance of reverse engineering this and most won't allow battery charging disabling. \n\nA: This is highly dependent on hardware. Most laptops at the hardware level, will not allow you to stop charging the battery. LION batteries actually benefit from a small uncharge - recharge cycle, and most laptops will have that cycle built in at the hardware level. \nMeaning as your battery indicator says 100% the battery is actually discharging and recharging a tiny little bit to keep it healthy. Also, for most laptops 100% is not full. \nSome laptops in windows, have an option to \"Disable charging\", but this was just a throwback to NiCad batteries. These days all that \"setting\" does is enable \"performance\" mode. \nIf your looking for the same kind of switch then I recommend Jupiter.  It will allow you to easily move between performance modes, but again not control charging directly.\nBecause stopping that charging cycle is very bad for current batteries it's not very popular. Because it's not popular, I doubt you will find a good GUI tool to do it. Your best bet, might be looking around in /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0 like areas and seeing what you can find, but I am pretty sure, that your not going to be able to disable charging. \n\nA: I could set my threshold to 60% by setting /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold to 60 as su. Ubuntu shows charging icon, but won't charge past 60%. The battery charging indicator LED also turned white, indicating that charging has stopped, much like it's behavior on Windows when Asus' \"Battery Lifespan Mode\" is activated. Also, the file resets to 100 on every boot, you might want to add a rule to set it to 60 on boot.\nSource. I didn't have enough reputation to comment this, so I answered it with my own experience. Do note that most of the people that used this method had Asus laptops and Asus has a similar functionality on Windows by default. I highly doubt if that should make a difference, but one user with an Ideapad said they couldn't find the file. ThinkPad owners should try using TLP's setting for battery threshold.\nEDIT: Heads up, this seems to be a very dirty method, has rendered my machine unbootable in certain situations. And this took me a lot of tries to figure it out because it seemed to be working at certain times and unbootable after sleep.\nEDIT 2: Seems like this solution is actually documented well on Arch Wiki. In fact, they've provided workarounds for the issue I quoted in my edit, Please refer to the section Persist after hibernation where it provides workarounds for the black screen after sleep issue.\n\nA: In most laptops is the Embedded Controller the one responsible for that.\nI suggest you to study the ec_sys module.\nmodprobe ec_sys\n\nthen\nhexdump -C /sys/kernel/debug/ec/ec0/io\n\nYou will see differences when charging and when discharging.\nThere are also more interesting things to do like:\n\n*\n\n*use AC power (if connected)\n\n*use battery (even if AC is connected)\n\n*charge/discharge\n\netc.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 & 12.04.1 LTS mouse freezing (Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.5 Mouse) I've figured it out: it's the Cyborg mouse. I'll be looking through the questions as I remember seeing something about this.\nI'm getting a similar issue to this fellow: https://askubuntu.com/questions/75433/ubuntu-11-04-randomly-freezes-for-over-one-minute\nSometimes it comes back to life after a minute or two only to crash again. Alt-tab works, but it does not display the windows-switching animation. It just switches the focus... sometimes. Ctrl-Alt-T works, thankfully, and the terminal stays responsive long enough for me to get in a \"sudo reboot now\" and type my password. \nI'm running a fresh Wubi install on a separate HDD from my Windows install. 64-bit 12.10 12.04.1 LTS now, with an AMD FX chip, 8GB of RAM, and a Radeon HD 3850. My mouse is a Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.5 Mouse, and my keyboard is a stock Acer one that came with a PC I bought a few years ago.\n\nA: Okay, so thanks to about six different pages (being a new user, I can't post more than two links, so I've posted the two most useful), I've got this going. By running gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf in the terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T) to edit X11's xorg.conf file, then pasting the following in at the bottom:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Mouse Remap\"\n    MatchProduct \"Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.5 Mouse\"\n    #May also be \"Mad Catz Mad Catz R.A.T.5 Mouse\" depending on production date.\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Option \"AccelerationProfile\" \"1\"\n    Option \"ConstantDeceleration\" \"5\"\n    Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 0 0 0\"\n    Option \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5 6 7\"\nEndSection\n\nYou should change the MatchProduct field to match your own version of the R.A.T. mouse. You can find it with xinput.\nA few things to note if you want to understand what this block of text means are the Option fields. AccelerationProfile 1 sets mouse acceleration off. It's a personal preference thing-- you can omit this line if you like acceleration, or make it a higher number for a few different kinds of acceleration. You can read more about it in the first of the links below.\nConstantDeceleration is also not necessary, but it really helps slow the mouse down so you can use a higher DPS (because why use 1600 when you can use 5600?) without having your mouse fly all over the screen. Play with this number if you don't think it feels right-- higher numbers mean a slower mouse.\nButtonMapping is where the actual fix takes place: you'll notice that where one would expect the numbers 13, 14, and 15, there are 0s. This is because the three mode buttons are mapped to 13, 14, and 15. We want to stop Ubuntu listening to those buttons, so we un-map them with 0s.\nZAxisMapping is to get the back and forward thumb buttons working like they should. I honestly didn't do any reading about this one, I just saw one guy saying it should work, so I tried it and it worked. It's particularly mystifying to me since the back and forward thumb buttons are actually buttons 8 and 9, but if it ain't broke don't fix it, right?\nhttp://www.x.org/archive/current/doc/man/man5/xorg.conf.5.xhtml\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1528982&page=2\n\nA: This file is self explanatory can be used to configure R.A.T 5 mouse in Linux, Fedora 17 or Ubuntu 12.04 (tested), probably it will work for other models too.\n# Filename: 20-cyborgrat5.conf\n# Should be added into folder:\n# [Fedora] /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/\n# [Ubuntu] /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/\nSection “InputClass”\n    Identifier “Mouse Remap”\n    MatchProduct “Saitek”\n    MatchDevicePath “/dev/input/event*”\n    Option “ButtonMapping” “1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 0 0 0″\n    # CHANGFE THE 8 AFTER 7 BACK INTO A 2 IF IT BREAKS.\nEndSection\n\n\nA: I messed around with this issue in Linux Mint for a while:\nWhat I did:\nxinput (this have my mouse code 12)\nxinput get-button-map 12\nMy RAT5 (serial nr 43705) has 17 buttons:\n1 - Left button\n2 - Scroll click\n3 - Right button\n4 - Scroll up\n5 - Scroll down\n6 - x\n7 - x\n8 - Thumb back\n9 - Thumb forward\n10 - Thumb scroll to right\n11 - Thumb scroll to left\n12 - Snipe\n13 - x\n14 - x\n15 - Mode button\n16 - DPI forward\n17 - DPI back\nI tested out the buttons by replacing the button id numbers in xorg.conf\nAnd got the horizontal scroll working with this addition to /etc/X11/xorg.conf \nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Mouse Remap\"\n    MatchProduct \"Mad Catz Mad Catz R.A.T.5 Mouse\"\n    #May also be \"Mad Catz Mad Catz R.A.T.5 Mouse\" depending on production date.\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Option \"AccelerationProfile\" \"1\"\n    Option \"ConstantDeceleration\" \"5\"\n    Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 0 0 8 9 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n    Option \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\n    Option \"WAxisMapping\" \"6 7\"\nEndSection\n\n(Button mapping tells the function of the button.\nZAxis is vertical scroll\nWAxis is horisontal scroll)\nIt works in PDF, zooms in image viewer and is broken in Opera.\n", "Q: no internet on ubuntu 11.10 i really really hope you can help me here, i just got a 12.04 server set up and running in London and with port changed and ssh [RSA KEY] log in.

I am fond of using gcc to compile small little C and C++ programs on my main computer.

Once invoked, it acts exactly as \"vanilla\" gcc, with the only exception that it builds packages for the ARM architecture (or a subset including the BCM2835, at least).  Building Embedded Linux Systems (pg 93-94) explains that the names used for invoking the GNU tools in a cross-compilation manner follows this format:\n\ncpu-kernel-manufactuer-os\n\nThe -gcc at the end of the topmost example is the component, used for specifing which part of binutils you want to use.  It can be swapped out for another GNU toolchain component, such as ld (linker) or as (assembler).  For arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc, arm is the architecture, linux is the kernel, gnueabi is the os, and gcc is the component.  Where is the manufacturer?  Apparently, the manufacturer can be specified as \"unknown\", as it rarely makes a difference, or left out alltogether (including it would make arm-linux-unknown-gnueabi-gcc).\n\nA: Officially documented method\nhttps://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md (GitHub)\ngit clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools\nexport PATH=\"$(pwd)/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin:${PATH}\"\nprintf '#include <stdio.h>\\nint main() { puts(\"hello world\"); }\\n' > hello_world.c\nprintf '#include <iostream>\\nint main() { std::cout << \"hello world\" << std::endl; }\\n' > hello_world.cpp\narm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -std=c99 -o hello_world_c hello_world.c\narm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ -std=c++11 -o hello_world_cpp hello_world.cpp\n\nTested in Ubuntu 17.10, tools repo at 5caa7046982f0539cf5380f94da04b31129ed521\n\nA: I am not sure at 100%, but, using https://tandrepires.wordpress.com/2012/08/01/raspberry-pi-openelec-pvr-dvb-t/, you could try: \n1) Required libraries:\nsudo apt-get install g++ git nasm flex bison gawk gperf autoconf automake m4 cvs libtool \\\nbyacc texinfo gettext zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev git-core build-essential xsltproc libexpat1-dev zip \\\nautopoint xfonts-utils libxml-parser-perl libproc-processtable-perl default-jre\n\n2) Compile the project with the following options, where N is the number of cores of your x86 CPU:\n$ PROJECT=RPi ARCH=arm PVR=yes make release -j N\n\nI hope it helps.\n`\n", "Q: I'm running Ubuntu on my Nexus 7, do I have access to the same packages as if I'm running Ubuntu on my Desktop? I noticed that some packages are not available on my Nexus 7 when browsing the Software Center or using \"apt-cache search\". Can anyone explain?\n\nA: No Not Exactly, The Nexus 7 is an ARM based platform, therefore uses a different package archive than your common x86 Desktop. If the desired package is not available for ARM, then it will not be available to download.\nAs there are some Nexus 7 specific packages. These packages are found in the nexus 7 ppa (ppa:ubuntu-nexus7/ppa).  The Nexus 7 PPA is enabled by default when you install. We are currently in the process of migrating all our changes upstream into Raring Ringtail (13.04). When that switch occurs, most updates will come from the main Raring repositories.\n\nA: The nexus 7 uses an arm CPU.

Does anybody managed to update BIOS on Dell studio xps 1647 from Ubuntu? \nI have A01 and want to update to A11. I read a lot of stuff on the web and around how to do this and failed. Freedos approach finished with a problem of running exe file (with BIOS update from dell website) as a file that can't be run in a dos mode (or sth similar). \n\nA: I did a bios upgrade when i first got my 1640; I did not do it on ubuntu; instead I immediately did it on Win 7 that came pre-installed. I am not sure though whether I had dual boot at the time or not.\nMy suggestion is that you do the upgrade from Windows; I guess its safer. If you don't have Windows installed I'd recommend you install a genuine one if you have it. \nIn either case, find the right bios by using the service tag of your laptop; use this page: https://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/DriversHome/NeedProductSelection\nFollow the \"Installation Instructions\" as written on the bios upgrade page.\nOtherwise I suggest you seek help from a computer specialist.\nWarning: a bios upgrade, if failed, can break your computer!\nDisclaimer: this is just suggestions not guidance; I hold no responsibility for any problems or failures!\nAll the best\n\nA: I have a Dell Inspiron 7520 and had similar problems; basically the executable for the upgrade downloaded from the Dell site has to be run in a Windows 7 environment. If your machine is dual-boot with a Windows 7 option that is no problem, but if like me you have removed Windows entirely there are still ways to do the upgrade.\nCheck out my answer to this question. The key is to boot you computer into a Windows 7 command line mode, which can be done using a Windows 7 Repair Disk (not installation media!). If you have the executable on a USB drive it is then trivial to run it. \nIt is possible to make a small USB drive into a bootable Windows 7 Repair drive if you do not have a CD drive.\nI obtained my Windows 7 Repair Disk by installing a copy of Win7 on a VirtualBox VM, but you can download them from the web, or find a friend with a Win7 machine to make one for you.\n", "Q: Setting Up No-Ip on a Ubuntu server 12.04?

Is it possible to run Wine, CrossOver and PlayOnLinux in parallel? I'm testing all three in order to:\n\n\n*\n\n*See which applications run better on which platform\n\n*Which of these is easier to use for non-technical users\n\n\nAn unrelated question: it looks like there is a \"meta-package\" for Wine on Ubuntu that includes multiple Wine packages - is it similar for CrossOver / PlayOnLinux?\n\nA: The answer is yes. Also, using them at the same time may be necessary in order to be able to run certain programs.\nAll three are in fact based on Wine. \nPlayonlinux installs wine whether this is already installed or not. In fact, one of its most interesting features is that it can install and use different versions of wine for different programs and program versions, and in this way cope with version regressions. The corresponding Wine program is automatically downloaded and used, or it can be selected by the user who knows what he's doing. Playonlinux also installs Winetricks to run wine scripts.\nWine installs in ~/.wine. Playonlinux installs in ~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/. But running wine from menus after it was installed by playonlinux would create the ~/.wine folder. From this point of view using Playonlinux already involves in a way using Wine as a separate program. There is no point really in installing Wine after installing playonlinux. Playonlinux installs Wine, which then can be then used from playonlinux or separately. \nFor example, I have installed ImgBurn in Playonlinux, but then went to menus, wine, and installed foobar2000 there just to test and this player now is available from wine but not from playonlinux. But programs like Foobar2000 and ImgBurn are easily installed in all of the three options. Others, like msoffice, especially older versions, are a different matter.\nPlayonlinux is a GUI, but also a program with supplementary specific features. It seems made for games, but I cannot tell whether it is really better then crossover, for example, in dealing with games. \nCrossover has impressed me greatly, but it still may lack some features offered by playonlinux, so having both makes sense. The big advantage with crossover is in the way it facilitates the installation of programs that are difficult to put to work in Wine and playonlinux, like older versions of msoffice. It installs in ~/.cxoffice. I have not tested it enough but I believe it to be indeed a superior program. (While I was not able to install msofficexp in the other two, in Crossover it was very easy to do.)\nFor many small programs it makes little sense having all these three programs at the same time. But for certain special cases like msoffice (which i tested) or games (which i didn't test), and I guess for bigger and complex programs in general crossover and playonlinux may be necessary, so that one could be .\nAfter you test them please report here your conclusions.\n\nUpdate: I was able to install Kindle for PC in Crossover, but it would not run. In Playonlinux, Kindle for PC is registered in the list of software that can be selected for installation; after selecting it, a specific Wine version 1.4 was installed and the application was able to run. This is a good example how PlayOnLinux is very necessary. \n", "Q: How do I install a driver for a Kodak esp 3250 printer?

My second monitor stops working, and when I try to launch NVidia Settings, it tells me that I'm not using an NVidia X Driver.\nNow I've rebooted with the old normal kernel and everything works as before.\nSo, is there some sone bug or incompatibility between the pae kernel and the NVidia Drivers, or will I just need to reinstall (perhaps a different version of?) the NVidia driver if I want to start using the pae kernel?\n(which in turn means, will I just waste money if I buy the additional ram?)\n\nA: If you installed the Nvidia drivers with either the Additional Drivers provided by Ubuntu or the downloaded drivers from the Nvidia site, you will need to reinstall them again. This is because (For the proprietary ones) they create a module and set a couple of configuration options that depend entirely on the Kernel in use at the moment they get installed.\nSince apt-get does not have a reinstall option like aptitude (eg: sudo aptitude reinstall nvidia-current) we need to use the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-current (Assuming is the nvidia-current you installed)\nFor the Nvidia drivers from the Nvidia site you are better of uninstalling them, then reinstalling them in the PAE version.\nBefore doing this you need to start the PAE Ubuntu version in recovery mode.

I have no interest in keeping Windows, but I want to confirm something that remains unclear to me.\nOnce I have disabled RAID, will I be able to access the SS Cache and the HDD individually as one would expect? My ideal configuration would be to have root (/) mounted on the SSD, and /home mounted to the HDD. Is that straightforward once RAID is disabled? Would I get the performance boost I expect from a SSD?\nFinally, are there any other factors to consider relating to compatibility?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: What I did with my u410 was put the sata controller into AHCI mode (enable legace mode booting, and enable USB Legacy mode), and then installed ubuntu to the mechanical disk (I used a single partition, but there's no reason you couldn't use a separate one for your /home as well). From there I used flashcache (step by step directions located here) and now I find that booting and what not happens just about as quickly as it does right off the SSD. I would have preferred to use bcache, but couldn't be bothered to pave that road with ubuntu.\n\nA: I did buy the Lenovo U410, and there was relatively little effort in installing Ubuntu onto it.\nThe BIOS was a bit of a pain to get into because it goes through the startup so quickly, and the BIOS treats the function keys as media keys (which can be disabled in the BIOS, once you get in).\nOnce into the BIOS, setting the controller to AHCI allows the Ubuntu installer to see the SSD and HDD as separate devices, and you can partition and install accordingly.\nI partitioned the SDD for / and /home, and if I start keeping massive files on the computer, I'll just simlink (or mount) folders in my home directory to directories (or partitions) on the HDD. No problems.\nEverything else seems to work well, after about 3 months of use. The trackpad is a little irritating, and I don't have any multitouch features working, but I'm sure that can be fixed with configuration.\n", "Q: errno 5 install I am trying to install ubuntu on my desktop.\nI used a usb that I had used successfully to my laptop, but it doesn't work for desktop.

Is there any synaptics setting that can help?  For the moment, I've enabled tap to click because normal clicking is so tough.\nI didn't have this issue when running Ubuntu in a VM, but I guess that has another abstraction layer that prevents synaptics from being the one interpreting direct touchpad input.\nThanks!\n\nA: On my HP Envy 14 Spectre I added this:\n$ cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/51-envy-quirks.conf \nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Envy clickpad\"\n    MatchDriver \"synaptics\"\n    Option \"SHMConfig\" \"True\"\n    Option \"LeftEdge\" \"1268\"\n    Option \"RightEdge\" \"5680\"\n    Option \"TopEdge\" \"1640\"\n    Option \"BottomEdge\" \"4729\"\n    Option \"AreaBottomEdge\" \"3900\"\n    Option \"TapButton1\" \"1\"\n    Option \"TapButton2\" \"3\"\n    Option \"TapButton3\" \"2\"\n    #Option \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"3915 0 3900 0 3032 3914 3900 0\"\nEndSection\n\nEdges values depends on your trackpad, SHMConfig option is useful to gather edges values with synclient -m 100.\nThe option that disables that click area is AreaBottomEdge but it disables right or middle clicking too, only left clicking is enabled.\nThat is why TapButton2 and TapButton3 is used to mimic missing buttons.\nThe only drawback of this approach is that you can't drag pressing right or middle buttons, only left button. \n\nA: I just found this while searching for solutions to the same problem (I had it really bad on an Apple magic trackpad).  These synaptic options fixed it for me...\ntry this in the terminal:\nsynclient HorizHysteresis=100 VertHysteresis=100\n\nThese options control how much movement you have to make before the touchpad registers it as a move event.

I've read most of the other answers on this site that have anything to do with this issue but I'm still not getting anywhere. I have a RAID 6 array with 10 devices and 1 spare. The OS is on a completely separate device. At boot only three of the 10 devices in the raid are available, the others become available later in the boot process.

Turns out there are several bugs filed in the area. Unfortunately, finding the work-around was very difficult.\nFirst a little bit more info:\n\n\n*\n\n*The hang is nothing of the sort. What is actually occurring is that the system is dropping to a initramfs shell. Unfortunately, this is hidden by the graphical boot so all I see is a slightly purple blank screen. If I type exit it will allow the system to boot up.\n\n*The system is dropping into the initramfs shell because it asks if we want to boot degraded and since it can't receive any input the way boot is setup this times out.\n\n*The last bit of info is that no matter what parameters you pass to kernel you can't get past this prompt. So we're stuck hanging if our drives for our array don't come up fast enough to suit upstart/udev.\nBugs are filed on launchpad (not by me) on all of the above issues and it looks like they are being worked through (this issue is apparently pretty difficult to deal with due to touching on a lot of things). \nFortunately for me, I was able to find a solution which will follow at the end. First I have to give a disclaimer with a strong warning. What I describe could cause you to mount a degraded array without being aware of it. This could lead to a total failure and loss of your data. You have been warned - DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU ARE COMPLETELY CERTAIN YOU ARE WILLING TO TAKE THESE RISKS!\nWhat I did to get Ubuntu to allow the system past this race condition was actually very simple:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure mdadm\n\nThen reconfigure mdadm to allow the system to start the array degraded. As I mentioned before, this can be risky so make sure that you have your mdadm set up to notify you if the array is running degraded and monitoring your array. I'd also recommend you set up e-mail notifications. I also have the system sending me a summary on my raid every time I reboot. I hope this was useful to someone; I sure wish I could have found this answer!\nCheers!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 does not boot after installation I installed Ubuntu 12.04 by replacing my Windows installation.

I found Kubuntu wouldn't run on so little memory but downloaded: Lubuntu-12.04-alternate-i386.iso, which I understood was light enough to go.\nThe laptop has one internal 40GB Toshiba hard drive divided into 3 partitions: C,19GB with Windows XP, Windows program files and some data, D, 19GB mostly data, and a small 2GB partition with some Acer software, which XP can't normally “see”. I transferred most of the contents of D to a memory stick, leaving 16GB free for Lubuntu. I did not want to dump XP yet, though it is painfully slow. I installed Lubuntu from then USB stick, accepting the default answers to most of the questions. The D: partition was further partitioned into a 500MB boot partition, 10GB for Linux, 2GB Swap and 6GB for data shareable between Linux and Windows. \nI had no error messages during installation, rebooted, was offered the choice of Ubuntu or XP, and selected the former. After a few minutes, I get a dark blue screen announcing Lubuntu with five dots underneath which lighten in turn. Eventually the lights stopped, and whatever I try the screen remains blank apart from “Lubuntu”\nI tried several solutions suggested on the forum for “identical” questions but without success. \n\nA: Eventually my son got Lubuntu going, though there can be no guarantee that his solution will be effective on any other make of Laptop.\n He added a file:\n/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-vesa.conf\n\nwith contents as follows\n Section \"Device\"\n Identifier \"Configured Video Device\"\n Driver \"vesa\"\n EndSection\n\n Section \"Monitor\"\n Identifier \"Configured Monitor\"\n VendorName \"Monitor Vendor\"\n ModelName \"Monitor Model\"\n HorizSync 30.0 - 53.0\n VertRefresh 50.0 - 60.0\n\n EndSection\n\n #Section\n \"Module\"\n\n #Load\n \"vesa” \n\n #EndSection\n\n\n Section \"Screen\"\n Identifier \"Default Screen\"\n Monitor \"Configured Monitor\"\n Device \"Configured Video Device\"\n    Subsection \"Display\"\n    Modes \"1024x768\"\n    EndSubsection\n EndSection\n\nHe commented further:\nThe command sudo lshw (list hardware - as a mnemonic) will show you what\n the hardware itself claims to be - this is how we saw you acer laptop\n actually has the ye-olde unichrome S3 display built into the\n motherboard. I would be interested to see if windows claims to have the\n same display adapter. My reading suggests it should work with the\n 'openchrome' adapter, but our experience was clearly that it does not\n work. The motherboard is relevant. I think we might have eventually got\n somewhere by forcing the openchrome adapter and simultaneously forcing\n the screen configuration, but the setup of /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\n was such that it was determining the number of screens and display\n adapters at boot time. Incidentially the file\n /home/”username”/.config/Xorg.config.new was written, even though running\n Xorg -configure didn't work. There were some clues in here - but it was\n wanting to set up three graphics drivers and associate them with the one\n screen. I think that was fundamentally the complaint lightdm was having\n with the xorg configuration, but I cannot be completely certain. Forcing\n a single display adapter that was openchrome without forcing the\n resolution didn't work so I fell back to 'vesa' rendering - this is more\n basic and doesn't fully exploit the graphical processing capability, but\n at least works.\n\nA: I think the problem is that 512MB of RAM (including graphics) was quite respectable when my ACER Laptop was designed, and people designed operating systems and other software round that. However in the intervening 12 years it is no longer enough, and even a lightweight system like Lubuntu will struggle. Even a smartphone has at least 1MB these days!

I Re-sized my partitions (to make more space for Linux) and of course messed up GRUB. This is fine. I corrected the issue, but only after much trial and error. Because the Mac has efi the installer tried to install grub-efi, which is did fine, but I needed grub-pc (the mac MUST boot in BIOS mode for X to work correctly).\nAll tihs trial and error left me with multiple installs of GRUB on several partitions and the MBR. My current setup is:\n/dev/sda - GRUB\n/dev/sda1 - (efi partition for OS X) GURB\n/dev/sda2 - Mac OS X \n/dev/sda3 - GRUB (also Linux partition)\nI need to remove GRUB from /dev/sda, /dev/sda1, and leave it on /dev/sda3. \nI use ReFIT. How can I safely remove the extra installs of grub without harming the install of OS X, refit, or grub on /dev/sda3\n\nA: Are you seeing multiple Linux icons in rEFIt? If not, I'd just leave it alone, since the extra boot code is doing no harm. If you are seeing extra Linux icons, though, you should first check that none of them refers to an EFI boot loader that you're not using. (Check the description that rEFIt shows when you highlight an entry; EFI boot loaders normally show a path to the boot loader, like EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi.) A stray EFI boot loader would be the easiest to remove, since it's just a file on the disk (probably on /dev/sda1, your ESP).\nIf you're sure you've got extra BIOS/legacy boot loaders showing in rEFIt, you can remove the unnecessary code by using dd, as in:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda2 bs=512 count=1\n\nThe details vary depending on what you want to wipe, though. Applied to the MBR (/dev/sda), you'd set bs=440 rather than bs=512, so as to erase just 440 bytes rather than 512 bytes.\nThis procedure is VERY DANGEROUS. A mistake can make a partition, or even your whole hard disk, inaccessible. Thus, you should be very sure that you're wiping out the correct data. You haven't presented sufficient evidence for me to be confident enough to recommend wiping any specific location. If you want more advice, post a link to the RESULTS.txt file produced by running Boot Info Script. That will produce detailed partitioning information and data on what boot loader(s) you have installed.\nOne more comment: If you determined that your Mac needs to boot in BIOS mode to get an X display prior to installing Ubuntu 12.04, you may want to re-examine the issue. Such problems tend to get ironed out over time, so Ubuntu 12.04 (or 12.10, should you care to upgrade again) may be better on this score than whatever you've tried in the past. Booting in EFI mode will enable you to eliminate the flaky hybrid MBR that you're presumably using now.\n", "Q: How do I open a terminal or console window on a new install? Just installed 12.04 desktop and I was astonished to discover no easy way to open an xterm or gterm or kterm (a shell prompt). Writing lengthy shell scripts is a lot easier in a shell. :)\n\nA: I thought Ctrl-Alt-T opened gnome-terminal by default? I believe this also works in Lubuntu. \nFor Unity, you can hit the Super or 'windows' key and type 'term' or some variation on it to get several terminal options (depending on what you've installed). \nIn Unity you can also easily make a shortcut.  Hit super/windows key to open dash, type 'short' or 'shortcut' and it takes you to the keyboard shortcuts with a couple of mouse clicks.\nI've mapped Ctrl-Alt-= to terminator using the custom shortcut option there.\nAlt+F2 works in several desktop/windows environments.

The most commonly used class C address from your consumer router/modem is:\n192.168.X.X\nTake a look at your Broadcast Address and Default Route as well. If your network was properly configured then all of those entries would be populated, most likely they will be of the same range of numbers as your IP Address. If any of these entries don't appear then that may be your problem. \nNext follow this Guide on the Ubuntu Forum and perhaps ask your question in the forum.

Please reinstall the kernel module by executing\n/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\nas root. If it is available in your distribution, you should install the DKMS package first. This package keeps track of Linux kernel changes and recompiles the vboxdrv kernel module if necessary.\nI ran the suggested step to reinstall the kernel module, and the log file is as follow:\nMakefile:181: *** Error: unable to find the sources of your current Linux kernel. Specify KERN_DIR=<directory> and run Make again.  Stop.\nMakefile:181: *** Error: unable to find the sources of your current Linux kernel. Specify KERN_DIR=<directory> and run Make again.

Stop.\n\nI still unable to re-run my win virtual XP vdi file.\nAnyone have any clue?\n\nA: Looks like you don't have the kernel headers installed, dkms needs then to install the Virtual Box kernel drive, to install then run:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\nAfterwards, \n/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\nshould work.\n\nA: The same may happen in VirtualBox 5. The vboxdrv script is now called vboxadd (I guess) and the logic is as follow:\nKERN_VER=`uname -r`\nKERN_DIR=\"/lib/modules/$KERN_VER/build\"\nif [ -d \"$KERN_DIR\" ]; then\n    KERN_REL=`make -sC $KERN_DIR --no-print-directory kernelrelease 2>/dev/null || true`\n    if [ -z \"$KERN_REL\" -o \"x$KERN_REL\" = \"x$KERN_VER\" ]; then\n        return 0\n    fi\nfi\n\nSo basically you need to make sure that you have installed VBoxGuestAdditions and the kernel sources exists in /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build. If they don't match, the command will fail.\nHere is a simple test:\n$ sudo sh -x /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-5.0.16/init/vboxadd setup 2>&1 | grep KERN\n+ KERN_VER=2.6.32-573.18.1.el6.x86_64\n+ KERN_DIR=/lib/modules/2.6.32-573.18.1.el6.x86_64/build\n\nSo make sure you install all the dependencies, e.g.\nsudo apt-get -y install dkms build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) virtualbox-guest-additions-iso\n\nThen make sure that /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build points to /usr/src/kernels/$(uname -r).\nAnd double check that these two commands are matching:\n$ sudo make -sC /usr/src/kernels/$(uname -r) kernelrelease\n2.6.32-642.1.1.el6.x86_64\n$ uname -r\n2.6.32-642.1.1.el6.x86_64\n\n", "Q: Does Zeitgeist slow performance considerably This was talked to me today and I actually did not have a proper answer, so I was wondering if Zeitgeist had any impact in performance.

See the breakdown of ifconfig for more details.\nInterrupt numbers are assigned to hardware devices by the kernel. They are used to multiplex the few interrupt channels that the CPU has between many hardware devices. You can see all interrupt numbers being used by executing cat /proc/interrupts/\n\nA: In this case its most likely a dropped packet. Interrupts are how computers call fucntions at the CPU level.  You load the registers and the stack and then generate an interrupt.\nBut if you really want to understand about interrupts, check out Wikipedia.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt\n", "Q: Unable to run Windows 8 in full screen mode in VirtualBox on Ubuntu 12.10 Not quite sure if this is on topic or not but all of the googling I could find referred to changes to make to get Windows 8 to run in full screen mode on Windows, however I haven't found any documents or guides on running Windows 8 in full screen mode for Ubuntu.\nI am running the 64-bit version of Windows 8 on virtualbox 4.2 and I do have the guest additions installed\nThanks,\nJonathan\n\nA: You may need to install the virtualbox expansion pack:\nhttp://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.4/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.2.4-81684.vbox-extpack\nAlso, I would make sure hardware virtualization is enabled:\nSETTINGS > SYSTEM > ACCELERATION TAB > both checkboxes checked\n\nA: Install Guest Addition in safe mode, it is a lot more complicated then needs to be to get to safe mode. follow instruction at how to geek.\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/107511/how-to-boot-into-safe-mode-on-windows-8-the-easy-way/\nafter reboot I did go full screen (host + f), scale mode (host+c) full screen, both work as expected... seamless mode (host + l) while works, it does not work correctly, unable to access win 8 on screen features\n", "Q: What should be the path for storing Maildir e-mails?

Update 2021: This has not been a problem for a real while. I recently accepted the \"update your system\" since this is (and was) in some sense the correct answer. Remember to use Solaar if you need to play with the USB Unifying device pairing, not needed for out-of-the-box mice.\n\nI have a Logitech Anywhere MX mouse (wireless), when I connect it to the computer it doesn't work.\nThe mouse works in other computers with Windows and with Fedora 17 and Fedora 19, but it doesn't work in two different computers with Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10. Moreover these same computers work with another Microsoft wireless mouse.\nSo I think the combination of Logitech MX and Ubuntu doesn't play well.\nThe dmesg log entry looks like this:\n[  578.845838] usb 3-2: Product: USB Receiver\n[  578.845841] usb 3-2: Manufacturer: Logitech\n[  578.851625] logitech-djreceiver 0003:046D:C52B.0009: hiddev0,hidraw0: USB HID v1.11 Device [Logitech USB Receiver] on usb-0000:00:14.0-2/input2\n[  578.851899] logitech-djreceiver 0003:046D:C52B.0009: logi_dj_probe:logi_dj_recv_query_paired_devices error:-32\n[  578.854518] logitech-djreceiver: probe of 0003:046D:C52B.0009 failed with error -32\n\nInstead of the expected (taken from Fedora):\n[154344.634520] usb 2-1.2: Manufacturer: Logitech\n[154344.647935] logitech-djreceiver 0003:046D:C52B.000D:\nhiddev0,hidraw0: USB HID v1.11 Device [Logitech USB Receiver] on\nusb-0000:00:1d.0-1.2/input2\n[154344.653788] input: Logitech Unifying Device.

Wireless PID:1017] on\nusb-0000:00:1d.0-1.2:1\n\nUPDATE: I would say that at this point, solaar is the way to go. So I accepted a previous answer suggesting this.\n\nA: You only need to update the system if you are using 12.04 or 12.10.\nI have had several questions related to the Anywhere Mouse and the Touch Mouse M600\nIs Logitech's Unifying receiver supported?\nCan I use the Logitech Touch Mouse M600?\nI even participated in this launchpad bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/linux/+bug/958174 where several solutions like:\nsudo modprobe -r hid_logitech_dj\nsudo modprobe hid_logitech_dj\nwere mentioned but at the end, updating the system fixed all issues with both mouses.\nThere is even a askubuntu answer about it here: Logitech M515 does not work after upgrade to 12.04\nBut for all 4 computers I tested this, the solution was to activate all repositories by default not activated (universe, multiverse, proposed, backport), do an update and upgrade. Reboot and the mouse should work out of the box perfectly.\nIf by chance doing this does not fix the problem, then doing a diagnostic to it will help, for example:\n\n*\n\n*After rebooting disconnect/connect the Logitech Receiver. Open a terminal and type dmesg to see the last lines that will mention the receiver. See if an error appeared.\n\n\n*Type lsusb. You should see a line similar to the one below if everything was detected correctly:\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 046d:c52b Logitech, Inc. Unifying Receiver\n\n\n*Turn on/off the mouse (The on/off switch in the mouse is below) and test.\nThis has been tested in USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports. To make sure (at least for most users) that this work, ALL repositories have to be activated. Like the following 3 images:\nHere we see main, universe, restricted and multiverse activated. I also changed the server from my country to MAIN\n\nHere I activated since they were off, the Canonical and 3rd party repositories.\n\nHere wee see proposed and backports activated (Beside security and updates).\n\nAfter all that I did a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade. Rebooted the PC and done.\nThe mouse should work every time while turned on, but if this fails, I see a couple or reasons why:\n\n*\n\n*The Anywhere MX mouse actually drains the batteries faster than other mice I have tested. In my tests, Anywhere MX uses 2x more battery than the Touch Mouse M600 and at least 20x more than the Logitech V450. For example, using it everyday, can use the Anywhere MX for 1.5 months to 2 months. The Touch Mouse lasts around 4 to 5 months. The V450 lasts clearly a full year up to 16 months. So check the batteries. I suspect this is due to the Darkfield Technology.\n\n\n*The Anywhere MX mouse when turned on a green light will flash for about 3 seconds then turn off. This does not mean the mouse if off, it just means that the mouse batteries are good. If the lights were red then you need to change them. In either case, the light will turn on with green or red then turn off to preserve the batteries.\n\n\n*The switch to turn on/off the mouse below can be switch any amount of times when using Ubuntu, but it is better to turn the mouse off when not using it. This way it will last longer. For example when sleeping, going to work, etc..\n\n\n*Certain BIOS options might have an impact on the mouse. Check your motherboard's BIOS for USB options. Play with them just in case the mouse does not work.\n\n\n*Change the USB port where the receiver is connected. Some ports (Like the front ports) are known to really suck at having high power devices on them.\n\nA: Solaar worked for me in 12.04. In terminal type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:daniel.pavel/solaar  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install solaar  \n\nOnce installed, open Solaar from the Dash menu and click on  in the upper left corner. The click on  in the lower right corner and follow the directions.\nIf you had the logitech devices paired to another computer before, you may first need to unpair the logitech devices from the other computer(s). After that reboot Ubuntu without logitech receiver in USB, start Solaar from Dash / menu, plug in logitech receiver, click 'add new devices' and switch new device on/off to be recognized. Repeat for each device.\nOnce paired the devices are recognized every time you start ubuntu (Solaar is automatically installed in 'startup applications').\nAlso check this link as source http://www.webupd8.org/2013/07/pair-unpair-logitech-unifying-devices.html or for more trouble shooting\n\nA: There is a workaround, using this script (copy this into a .sh script, chmod +x this file and run as root:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile :; do dmesg|grep logitech-djreceiver|tail -1|grep -q -c \"failed with error -32\" || exit; \necho -n `date`\" Driver Reload\" ; \nrmmod hid_logitech_dj ; \nmodprobe hid_logitech_dj ; \ndmesg|grep logitech-djreceiver|tail -1 ; sleep 1; done\n\nOr download mousefix.sh which is a link on this page here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1039143/comments/55\nThis fix works by removing and re-adding (rmmod + modprobe) hid_logitech_dj which is the module responsible for the unifying receiver. It does this in a while loop once a second until it is finally recognized. \nThere is apparently a Linux Kernel bug around using this receiver on an XHCI (USB 3) port and newer versions of the Linux Kernel. It probably works fine on USB2 ports. (?)\nHere is the lengthy thread about this issue, where the developers and a lot of other people have been working to sort out this issue. \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1039143\nProps to Jelle Foks for figuring this out. Had been driving me insane for ages. \nAs I leave my receiver in all the time, I run this script at boot, and resume-from-sleep for an \"automatic\" fix and it has been working great the last little bit.\nLet me know if this works. \n\nA: I enhanced the script up top and then also added a udev rule to fire whenever the mouse was plugged in.  I am using a Logitech Performance MX but the rule should be similar.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# loop up to 10 times trying to fix the mouse insertion\nfor i in {1..10}\ndo\n\n  # exit the script if there was no mouse error\n  if [ `dmesg | grep \"logitech-djreceiver\" | tail -1 | grep -c \"failed with error -32\"` -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"No logitech receiver error...exiting\" ;\n    exit 0 ;\n  else\n    # try to reload the mouse driver\n    echo `date`\" Error detected, trying reload of logitech hid driver\" ;\n    rmmod hid_logitech_dj ;\n    modprobe hid_logitech_dj ;\n    sleep 1 ;\n  fi\n\ndone\n\nThis tries up to 10 times to reload the driver before exiting.\nI named the script /usr/bin/mousefix and did a chmod +x.\nHere is the udev rule, a line that can be added to /etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules\nSUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", DRIVERS==\"usb\", ATTRS{manufacturer}==\"Logitech\", ATTRS{product}==\"USB Receiver\", ACTION==\"add\", RUN+=\"/usr/bin/mousefix\"\n\nHope this helps somebody else.  It seemed like an easier thing to do to have the script run whenever the usb connected.\n\nA: K, thanks a lot \"Dennis Kubes\" for your Script, but didn't work for me. \nI had to adjust it to get it to work:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# loop up to 10 times trying to fix the mouse insertion\n    sudo modprobe -r hid_logitech_dj && sudo modprobe hid_logitech_dj ;\n\nfor i in {1..10}\ndo\n\n  # exit the script if there was no mouse error\n  if [ `dmesg | tail -1 |  grep \"logitech-djreceiver: probe of\" | grep -c \"error -32\"` -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"No logitech receiver error...exiting\" ;\n    exit 0 ;\n  else\n    # try to reload the mouse driver\n    echo `date`\" Error detected, trying reload of logitech hid driver\" ;\n    sudo modprobe -r hid_logitech_dj && sudo modprobe hid_logitech_dj ;\n    sleep 1 ;\n  fi\n\ndone\n\nHope this will help somebody.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit support the AMD Radeon HD 6790 video card? Quick question: Does Ubuntu 12.10 or 12.04.1 64 bit support the AMD Radeon HD 6790 video card?\nI tried checking Ubuntu's hardware support wiki information but it hasn't been updated since July 2011 - what a shame.\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: I have a HD 6970, so from the same 6000 series, and there is an AMD driver that can be installed in Ubuntu. You can download it from  \"Software Sources\" -> \"Additional Drivers\". Or you can download it and install manually from the AMD website, which clearly specifies the 6900 series to have a supporting driver for Linux.\n\nA: No. AMD graphics cards are supported by AMD. Check if a Linux driver is available for Radeon HD 6790.\n", "Q: Install/Remove Language show only English, no other choice So my question is, when I want to choose other language to install, it shows only English installed (checked), but what I can see in the other posts, there is a list of languages that allows user to choose.\nI am a totally new to Linux. What should I do to get the list of languages to appear)? Why is this happen, is it because I've skipped the language packs during the installation?\n\nA: I don't know why the options are not coming up. A work-around is to try install languages from the terminal.\nThe following command will list language packs that can be installed:\napt-cache search language-pack\n\nThe packs can be install by entering (for French):\nsudo apt-get install language-pack-fr-base\nsudo apt-get install language-pack-fr\n\nReplace 'fr' by the language code of your choice found by running the very first command.\n\nA: Something appears to be missing.  It's not the fact that you might have skipped language support at the time of installation as I have an EeePC that I installed without a network connection and I can indeed get to a full language selection screen by clicking the Install/Remove Languages button as per the instructions below.\nThe only things I can think for you to do at the moment is install the languages individually as suggested by Mowgli, or try to re-install the gnome language selector and see if that fixes the problem:\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install language-selector-gnome\n\nYou then need to open the language selector from system settings and click on the button Install/Remove Languages.  You will get a separate window that opens where you can select additional languages to install.\n\n\nA: I already resolve it, the main reason why the options are not showing up is because i didn't update it(i skipped updates during installation), so I just simply type in:\nsudo apt-get update\nafter finish update, the languages magically appear, Forgive the Stupid me.

Often the best way with Thunar custom actions is to use a script and apply the correct parameter to that: i.e.\n/home/mike/foo_script %F\n\nthen the parameter can apply to the script.\nThe script I have experimented with is at the hydrogenaudio forums, and I have modified it slightly, but credit to that forum. There is a lot of useful information on that forum about foobar. \n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd ~/.wine/drive_c/\"Program Files\"/foobar2000/\nif [ \"$1\" != \"\" ]; then\nfilename=`echo z:$1 | sed 's/\\\\//\\\\\\\\/g'`\nwine foobar2000.exe \"$filename\" &\nelse\nwine foobar2000.exe &\nfi\n\nCopy the script into a text editor, but make sure you place the correct location of your foobar directory in the script, make it executable and enter its location in the Thunar custom actions dialogue (as in the screenshot below). As you know, select audio files and folders in the other 'appearance conditions' tab.\n\nOnce it has been added as a Thunar custom action with the correct parameters, the script further above allows you to add and then play your music in Foobar just by right clicking on a single track or a folder and selecting your custom menu item.\nHere is Foobar launched with the custom action and playing a folder of Duke Ellington: \n\nIn addition, you could probably modify the script and also use it for other wine applications just by changing the name (foobar2000) of the application and the application folder. Then you could create a new script and another different custom action.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installed on the wrong partition I accidentally installed ubuntu on the windows backup partition of my computer.  How can I uninstall it with out messing up the windows backup?\n\nA: I would not worry so much about your backup partition. In windows booting from a repair disk/install disk has the same effects as booting from your backup partition.\nAlso if you did a normal installation of ubuntu then I would say the partition already is unrecoverable. Ubuntu usually, when given the permission to install the partition, erases the entire partition and rewrites Ubuntu files to it.

You could test by using the test command in the terminal. \n\n*Advanced recovery tools can analyse the residual magnetic fields left on the disk blocks in order to recover data that has been overwritten. The safest way completely destroy data is to write random data to the disk multiple times (this all assumes you are using a magnetic disk, and not an SSD).\n", "Q: Problem in my terminal related clamav Recently I decided to use Avast Antivirus.

Only being able to start desktopcouch as root sounds like this bug: 1-line \"uri_file =\" config fix for CouchDB 1.1.1 compatability\nI proposed a fix for it, but looks like there was some issue with the unit tests (I don't think related to my fix).\nAnyway, desktopcouch is now unmaintained and I recommend not building any new software upon it. If you're interested in Ubuntu sync as a service, look at U1DB, Canonical's replacement for desktopcouch.\nIf you're interested in using CouchDB in desktop apps, look at UserCouch and Microfiber (disclaimer: I'm the author and maintainer of both). These have both been developed as part of the Novacut project. We were originally using desktopcouch, but have since migrated away from it.\n", "Q: apt-get error, cannot install many packages?

Then run a   \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -f install \njust to make sure. If that still doesn't work then continue on.\nRemove the offending package\nsudo dpkg --remove 5.5.28-0ubuntu0.12.04.2\nfolowed by \nsudo apt-get -f install\nThis should remove MySQL completely (including the meta packages you stated).\nYou can then re-install with: \nsudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.5\n\nA: I had the same problem with mysql-server-core-5.5 version 5.5.29-0ubuntu0.12.04.1\n\nmysql-server-5.5 depende de mysql-server-core-5.5 (= 5.5.24-0ubuntu0.12.04.1); \n  sin embargo:\n  La versión de `mysql-server-core-5.5' en el sistema es 5.5.29-0ubuntu0.12.04.1\n\nI solved it with this commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup de database(s)\n\n*Check all version avaible of mysql-server for you linux distribution. sudo apt-cache madison mysql-server-5.5.\n\n*Remove the packages of mysql-server. sudo apt-get remove mysql-server-5.5 mysql-server-core-5.5.\n\n*Install a old version (see the second point for select one).

How can I tell Ubuntu 12.10 to perform auto updates silently without any questions and messages? In GUI tool there is an option to do this if security updates are available. But I want all updates to be installed this way.\nI think it can be done using apt-get with cron. But is it the best way?\n\nA: The package unattended-upgrades is used by Ubuntu to silently install important security updates to your system. It is enabled by default and runs on every current Ubuntu release.\nYou can use the same utility to upgrade your system by enabling unattended-upgrades to upgrade non security related updates. For that use your favourite text editor to edit the necessary config file located on /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades, ie:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades\n\nand remove the // marks on the start of the line \"${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-updates\"; so it looks like this\n\nDont forget to save the file.\nYou can change the configuration of the unattended updates by editing the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic, options for the configuration are in the /etc/cron.daily/apt script header. Read them to configure the frequency of the unattended updates.\nThat is it! Your system will be updating itself, user independent and without interaction needed.\n\nA: This is not a good idea, but one of the great things about Linux is you can do it anyway. \nin a root conjob run\napt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y \nThis will update the apt-cache and then apply your upgrades. However, this could also fail if there are conflicting config files or other things dpkg needs to prompt for (dpkg will detect that it's non-interactive and will do the default for the question, the same as if you just pressed enter on the command line, if there is no default dpkg will fail).\nThere is also the problem of human tendency. If you update your system like this, things could change on you randomly. This could cause things to break or act differently until you restart the program. However you would have no way of knowing this, because everything happened behind the scenes. \nA slightly better option may be to pop the GUI at a given time. Something like:\n0 3 * * * export DISPLAY=:0 && /usr/bin/update-manager\nin your users crontab. Again this will fail quite a bit (if that user is not logged in at 3am, if the DISPLAY variable is wrong, etc.)\nBasically it's a bad idea, no one needs to be \"that\" up to date, set the \"other updates\" to display immediately in update-manager, and accept that your only going to get the notice when something on the system runs apt-get update (there is already a nightly cron job for this.)\n", "Q: How can I get back my desktop? the left and top panels I installed the Ubuntu 12.10 and the driver for ATI Radeon HD 4330 (AMD Catalyst™ 12.6 Proprietary Linux x86 Display Driver) and the latest updates.

It takes from a few to a few hundred milliseconds to begin to play the signal. The ONLY way to fix it is to cause your SPDIF output to constantly send SOME signal, thus keeping the receiver processing alive at all times. At the moment, I just solved this problem in Windows using a tiny utility some guy wrote in .NET that outputs a null signal at all times. He calls it SPDIF Keep-Alive.  This keeps the signal flowing and my receiver constantly listening. I have not yet seen a way to do this for Linux, but I would imagine the support to create such a thing is EVERYWHERE.

In fact, even audio over HDMI is only buggy for me with one specific monitor, so I assume that it is this monitor that turns off its sound system in the absence of a sound signal and requires some time for starting it.\nThe removal of module-suspend-on-idle did not fix HDMI audio for me and instead of the other suggestion of playing a silent audio file in a loop, I came up with a slighly nicer way of keeping the connection alive by connecting a null source to the sound output. The way I did it is by first loading the null source and loopback modules using the following commands:\npactl load-module module-null-source\npactl load-module module-loopback\n\nThis should usually suffice as by default the loopback will connect the null source to the default sound output. However, if you have used these modules earlier and connected them in some other way, then those connections will be remembered and reapplied. In this case one can wire them up correctly in an interactive manner in pavucontrol:\n\n*\n\n*On the Recording tab, connect the input of the loopback device to the null input.\n\n*On the Playback tab, connect the output of the loopback device to the HDMI output.\n\n(If the loopback device is missing from the device list, \"Show: All streams\" must be selected on the bottom first.)\nIt must be possible to do the second part with command line parameters as well, but since pulseaudio remembers the module connections anyway, I never needed to connect the devices again since my intial experiment. Once the devices are correctly connected once, in the future it is sufficient to load the two modules either using the commands from above or by adding\nload-module module-null-source\nload-module module-loopback\n\nto the config file (~/.config/pulse/default.pa or /etc/pulse/default.pa).\n", "Q: Focus follows mouse stops working when opening window from launcher and no click to focus This is 12.04 default desktop (unity).  I set it to focus follows mouse, and changed the menus to be on the window.  This worked for a while, then some unknown even, maybe an upgrade maybe some other setting change caused it to stop working.\nThere are many ways for this behavior to start but one reliable one is to bring a window to the foreground/focus with the launcher.  Now the focus is stuck on that window and not just the window but the regions within the window so the close, maximize, minimize and menus do not work.  I have to use mouse middle and then mouse right and then focus follows mouse is restored for a bit.

Bad luck there.\nOnce I found out the USB mouse was bad I tried another wireless mouse in exactly the same configuration on the KVM.\nEverything immediately started working correctly and I have had no problems for a week.\nI cannot explain why the mouse works on windows and not Ubuntu but I cannot call this an Ubuntu issue at this point considering that the mouse had worked on 12.04 for some time.\nAdvise on mouse issues is check hardware first this way.\nGet a verified working mouse and swap out for mouse on problem system and see if this corrects the problem.  \nGoing the other way, taking the mouse from the problem system and verifying it works on a different system may not isolate the issue.\n", "Q: Firefox bookmarks in the Ubuntu files system I have accessed my crashed Ubuntu version via live USB trial.

I am newbie to Ubuntu, I got into it 2 weeks ago and I reinstalled it like 10+ times already.\nIn most cases Ubuntu graphic interface wont show up, just command line.\nFew times I had \"low graphic settings\" error.\nAll of this happens mostly when I decide to remove useless repository, or install-remove some programs, or remove some pre-installed programs like Rhytmbox or Solitaire, which definitely shouldn't give any problems, but than baah - and my Ubunt wont load.\nI think that good way to keep system alive is never to uninstall anything.\nBut sometimes when I install some program from some repository, and I dont need it - I want to remove repository aswell and again my Ubuntu gets destroyed.\nHow can I keep my system clean yet working?\nWhat should I do?\nShould I maybe use some backup-program also? How can I organize my files/system so that I dont have to reinstall it all every time I mess something?   \nThanks alot!\nP.S.: For example right now I installed LAMP using taskel. Something went wrong, mySQL didn't get installed, so I want to remove it all and retry. how do I do it properly?\n Or, say, JDE. I installed Oracle 7 JDE since I needed it for PhpStorm, I failed to install it since some repository didnt exist. Next time failed version installed. After finally removing old stuff and installing Oracle 7 it worked, than I rebooted and bah - again my system wont load. What am I doing wrong? Am I lost for this world? :)\n\nA: Basically, your going about this all wrong. In you example, a failed lamp install could have just been fixed with sudo apt-get -f install  Same thing with JDE. sudo apt-get remove name-of-package-here works for everything you installed via apt. If you installed via dpkg then sudo dpkg --remove package-name-here.\nMissing or incorrect configuration can cause X (the GUI system) to not start. Usually you fix this is just a matter of removing /etc/X11/xorg.conf and then sudo restart lightdm. If that doesn't work you may need to re-configure your drivers. How you do that depends on your hardware and setup. \nRemoving repositories is dangerous. It's fine to do it. But when you install something via apt you install all it's dependencies. By removing a repository you could be removing more then the repository for just one package. apt will leave the old debs installed (from the disabled repo) but they will be \"orphaned\", meaning they will never get updates again (unless there in another repo). This is even more problematic if your using a \"nightly\" repo that supplies dependencies that are shared by many repos. apt will always use the \"latest\" version, but that version is in a repo that no longer exists. \nRe-installing is silly. You should NEVER have to re-install Ubuntu, short of a hard drive failure, or partitioning mix up.\nFor backups: I recommend back-in-time. It's very easy to use.  You should backup your $HOME directory and probably /etc/. Don't even bother backing up the rest. The only exception would be if you put files in an odd location. \nOne other side note. Won't load, is not that helpful. I am assuming, by your questions that X is not loading. The console is fully functional and can be used to fix problems with X not loading in very short order. \nStick with it. Once the learning curve is over, Linux is very easy to use and maintain. \n\nA: Welcome to the Open Source side :) \nFirst thing you should do is ensure that you mount your /home directory on a separate partition. This way, when you re-install, you can give the same username as last time and you get everything properly i.e. your data is completely fine. You do get the old settings because these are saved in /home/username/.xyz with xyz being whatever program saved the settings. However, you can simply delete the folder you don't like from there. (Just make sure you don't delete something you're not sure about.) \nSecondly, look up aptitude. If you install programs using aptitude, you can remove it and it does a good job of cleaning stuff up. \n", "Q: Bash script to automate truecrypt volume creation, mounting and unmounting I am trying to code a bash script that will automate the several tasks related to truecrypt.\nTasks are:\nCreating a truecrypt volume, mounting it, copying a file in filesystem, modifying the file, unmounting the volume.\nI have a question regarding creating the truecrypt volume. mounting and unmounting will not be a problem for me.\nThe command for creating volume is according to manpages:\n> truecrypt -c [volume path]\n\nbut after this command trucrypt will prompt user to enter several parameters like volume type, size, encryption, hash, password etc.\nHow can automate all these so that user doesn't need to enter any value?\nOk I can use following command for this:\ntruecrypt –size 200M –type normal –encryption AES –hash SHA-512 –filesystem FAT -c myvolume.tc\n\nBut now it asks for password.

I have a Win 7 and Ubuntu 11.10 multiboot system on my laptop. I am planning to upgrade Ubuntu, but I'd like to do it with a CD and make a new installation.\nI am wondering if there is anything I need to know about before I start altering my system. \nI think I just have to format and choose the partition where my current Ubuntu OS is and set the boot for the entire HD and that way thing will go smoothly and after the installation the screen will appear again (the screen where I can choose between Win7 and Ubuntu). Is it so?\n\nA: If you simply want to upgrade your Ubuntu 11.10 to 12.10, then you can use a liveDVD or a liveUSB to upgrade it.\nIf you want a fresh install, then you could choose the \"something else\" option and format your Ubuntu partition and continue installing 12.10 there.\n", "Q: Network sharing for android I am on ubuntu 12.04 and I want to create a wifi hotspot to be used with my android device.

If it does you can turn your WiFi into AP Mode. This basically turns your WiFi card into a normal WiFi Router using the Infrastructure archetype. There was already a Question specifically about AP Mode and someone wrote a very nice How-To. You can find it here:\nHow to setup a wi-fi hotspot (access point mode)?[SOLVED]\nIf your WiFi card doesn't support AP mode I'm afraid your only option is to get a Mobile Router(or buy an external WiFi card that supports AP). I have one and have found it very useful. I've even used my Ubuntu Laptop to act as a bridge between the Mobile Router and Hotel WiFi. That way I can log into the Hotel WiFi on the Laptop and then another device(like a Roku) without a Browser can connect through the Mobile Router and my Laptop to the Internet.\n\nA: Ubuntu allows you to create an ad hoc wireless network though most android and windows devices may not be able to connect to it.

Okay here is the situation -\nI have \n1.Ubuntu (default)\n2.Windows XP.\nI use XP only for android rooting and stuff and thus do not need it 90% of times.\nNow what I want should happen is, Grub should not show up and directly boot to Ubuntu in normal everyday circumstances.\nAnd when I shall want XP, I will do the exact opposite change to what I did to exclude it and make grub show up.(Obviously first booting into Ubuntu,doing that change and then rebooting to get grub)\nSo, How can i achieve this?\n\nA: You can set the grub timeout to 0. Just edit the file /etc/default/grub and set\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\n\nThis leaves us with the question of how to boot Windows. In the same config file set\nGRUB_DEFAULT=saved\n\nAfter that you can set the default entry to select. If your Ubuntu is the first entry run\nsudo grub-set-default 0\n\nThis way grub will always select the first entry if you don't specify something else. If you want to start Windows now, you have to start Ubuntu first. Open a terminal and run e.g.\nsudo grub-reboot 1\n\nif you want the second entry to be selected on reboot. There you have to enter the number of the entry that is your Windows. Keep in mind that the index is zero based, so the first is 0, the second is 1 and so on.\nWhen using grub-reboot your system reboots and the given entry will be selected default instead of Ubuntu. Since your timeout is 0 it will boot directly. Technically grub still shows but so shortly that you don't see it. I suggest you try out grub-reboot before setting the timeout to 0.\nAlmost forgot: After every edit of the config file you have to run\nsudo update-grub\n\nfor the changes to become effective.\n", "Q: skype crashes in ubuntu 12.04 I am using linux, in fact I started using ubuntu when I first met computers.

Rather than logging into Ubuntu from the Windows 7 Bootloader, it lead to the grub> command prompt.  No matter what I did here, it would not log me into linux.  As a result I uninstalled Ubuntu from the Add/Remove Programs application in Windows 7.  I then re-installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS using a liveCD-USB.  This time however, I created a partition.  I then restarted and got the GRUB bootloader which loads Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with no problems, however when I select windows (listed as \"Windows 7 (loader)\"), it just refreshes the grub bootloader instead of loading Windows 7.  I then used the Windows 7 repair disk to run bootrec/fixmbr and bootrec/fixboot.  This led to no bootloader coming up when I started my computer.  Instead I got a blank black screen with a flashing white cursor.  I went on to do a bootrec/buildbcd and bootrec/scanos.  These did nothing to change the situation.  When I ran bootrec/scanos it said that no Windows 7 installations were present.  After this I decided to reinstall WIndows 7 only for this to do nothing to change the situation.  Afterwards I did a boot-repair in which I began to get the GRUB bootloader, which would load ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but still would not load Windows 7.  I also did a sudo update-grub which recognized Windows 7 as being installed, but still didn't fix the issue of loading Windows 7.  While running Ubuntu I have no problem accessing my WIndows 7 partition which is formatted as NTFS.  It shows all the files and folders reflecting that the re-install did take place, and it also shows all of my old applications and folders in the Windows.old folder.  I am completely stuck at this point and have no clue what I should do next.  Any help you can offer me will be greatly appreciate.

As described in another issue, upgrading from 12.04 to 12.10 may break the Ambiance theme, causing many of the menus and controls to display in a strange grey-on-grey state.\nI have checked another user account and the theme appears fine there, so it seems to be a user-specific issue.\nWhat can I do to reset my theme settings to the standard for 12.10? I assume there is some set of config files in my home directory somewhere that are customizing it incorrectly.\n(As the linked issue was closed for being \"too localized\", I'm hoping a general fix can be provided for many similar theme issues.)\n\nA: sudo apt-get install --reinstall light-themes\n\nShould do the trick.\n", "Q: Radeon 6520G with black screen problem. Re-boot make it work I have a HP Pavilion g7 with Ubuntu 12.10. Ever since I installed ubuntu on it the first time when I switch on the pc the screen hangs with a blank screen, but only works after second and subsequent restarting.\nMy display device info http://paste.ubuntu.com/1365995/\nupdate: Filed a bug report with launchpad\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/1080156\n\nA: You machine appears to most likely have the ATI Radeon 4250 graphics adapter based on specifications found elsewhere.  You can confirm this by running \nsudo lshw -C display\n\nIf you are currently using the Radeon driver, try using the fglrx driver and vice versa.  Radeon support is pretty scratchy at the moment.  Your bug report will not go anywhere because it has been filed against xorg when it should have been filed against fglrx or the radeon driver after further testing.  Have a look at this previous question on installing the fglrx driver.\nA black screen does not actually mean that the machine is hung.  If you can press CtrlAltF1 and get to a text console to install drivers and reboot safely etc, the machine is not hung.  This is an important distinction to make at this point.\n", "Q: Laptop fan intermittently stopping Recently I've noticed that the fan on my laptop stops for ~1 second every 8 seconds or so then continues to work as normal. I've uploaded a recording of this here [dropbox] \nHas anyone experienced this before and found a solution? Equally, is this a bug?\n\nA: Well, if its in the same boat as this then you may be looking at something not many may truly have an answer for.\n  You can:\n      Check the BIOS for fan speed settings or anything that will affect it and try different ones. For instance, running the laptop in performance mode will increase fan usage.\n      Check for a new BIOS firmware on the manufactures website.\n      Check sensor temperatures, control fan speeds. Instructions here.\n      See here for a discussion on fan cycling.\n          Notably that it can be caused by hardware issues, dust, air flow. Also that\n          you can try other graphics drivers if its that fan causing the problem (or\n          perhaps different settings in the drivers settings program.\n      I would add though, that if it was a laptop that came with Windows installed then the BIOS could have problems working 100% with Linux.\n      If its a linux bug or driver related then an attempt in trying a different OS such as Windows could determine that.\n      Restarting.\n      Shutdown and waiting a few hours may determine if its heat related.\n\nA: This does not sound like a bug, given that you state that the fan runs 100% while you're playing games or doing other demanding things.  It's probably shutting the fan down once the system drops below a certain temperature.\nFor the most part you could consider this a feature not a bug - lower overall power usage - although if it happens LOTS AND LOTS, startup current involved in bringing the fan up completely from stop might cost more than just spinning the fan very slowly.  Still, for the most part, this sounds like something you can safely chalk up as \"slightly quirky, but not an actual problem\" and ignore.\n", "Q: Disable Alt+Tab switcher grouping by script or command In Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) with Unity, Alt + Tab lets you switch between groups of windows and makes it very annoying to switch to a specific window from a group when it is not the last window used.\nOne way to change this behaviour and get a plain Alt + Tab switcher showing all windows (without grouping) is to install ccsm (Compiz configuration settings manager), and enable the \"static switcher\" or something similar (can't remember exactly).\nI need to modify this setting on several machines, so I don't want to install a complex package for this. (Particularly not when this package makes it easy for users to completely f*k up their system when changing the wrong settings).\nSo I'm looking for a reliable way to change this configuration, through one or more commands (gconftool?), or by modifying a configuration file directly.\nBasically, I want to do directly on other machines what ccsm once did on mine to restore a sane and simple Alt + Tab behaviour.\n\nA: I was scared to use ccsm until I read this blog which makes it look like all that ccsm does is to edit the compiz .xml configuration files.\nA search for compiz reveals:\n~/.config/compiz-1\n~/.config/compiz-1/compizconfig\n~/.gconf/apps/compizconfig-1\n~/.gconf/apps/compiz-1\n~/.cache/compizconfig-1\n\nI backed up these directories and then made then changed from \"unity switcher\" to \"static application switcher\" using ccsm as shown here\nI then logged out and back in again and compared my backup to the changed system.\nHere are the results of diff -r compiz_before_change/ compiz_after_relogin/\nCHANGED:\n\n\n*\n\n*Binary file ~/.cache/compizconfig-1/place.pb\n\n*~/.gconf/apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/%gconf.xml\n5c5\n<   <entry name=\"active_plugins\" mtime=\"1354022954\" type=\"list\" ltype=\"string\">\n---\n>   <entry name=\"active_plugins\" mtime=\"1354023761\" type=\"list\" ltype=\"string\">\n70a71,73\n>       </li>\n>       <li type=\"string\">\n>           <stringvalue>staticswitcher</stringvalue>\n\n\n*~/.gconf/apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/%gconf.xml\n2a3,5\n>   <entry name=\"alt_tab_forward_all\" mtime=\"1354023761\" type=\"string\">\n>       <stringvalue>Disabled</stringvalue>\n>   </entry>\n\nNEW:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.compiz-1/session: 108caf9cb18e534392135401026619047100000017270046\nThese differences don't look big enough to me since I can't see anywhere that shows the keybindings which were changed, only the one which was disabled, so maybe compiz is a real pain and the change is in the binary file :-( Let's hope not!\nI think if you expanded the backup and comparison, perhaps to the entire /home/ folder you would be able to find out which files contain the changes you want to make and then all you have to do is copy them from machine to machine.\nAren't human readable config files just awesome! :-D If compiz saves the settings in the binary file the coders who did that need a very stern talking to. >:-|\nGood Luck.\n\nP.S. In case your wondering, I actually made another backup of the same files after I had logged back in and then compared the two backups.

Or do I have to write one myself?\n\nA: I was tempted to say Vim, just out of habit...  just kidding.\nThis seems like overkill, but you might be able to do it with LibreOffice write, or another word processor, depending on which one is available.\nYou can customize the toolbar to remove the buttons he won't need, and of course, you can choose the font and color.  I think they all have a setting for autosave, or to save recovery information to allow reloading an unsaved file.  \nThere may be simpler editors that will do what you want, and might be better if you don't have any of the open office applications, but if you already have them, it might be fairly easy to customize it.\nI think customizing the existing editor would be easier than writing your own. :)\nEdit:\nI meant to add that an advantage to the overkill method is that as he gets older and learns more, you can expose new features as he needs them.\n", "Q: Streaming desktop with avconv - severe sound issues I'm trying to do some live streaming in Ubuntu 12.10, but I'm having some problems with audio. More specifically, the quality is complete garbage and it's at least 10 seconds out of sync with the video.\nI'm using an excellent guide found here to set up my loopback devices so that I can combine the desktop audio with the microphone input. It seems to work, as I'm able to stream both audio and video to Twitch.tv. But, as I said, the audio quality is terrible. The microphone audio is very, very low, but if I increase it, I get a horrible garbled sound that is absolutely unbearable. Nothing like that is present during VoIP calls or when recording sound alone with the sound recorder, so it's not an issue with the microphone itself. The entire audio stream is also delayed about 10-15 seconds compared to the video stream.\nI put together an imgur album of my settings.\nHere is some example output from when I'm streaming:\navconv version 0.8.4-6:0.8.4-0ubuntu0.12.10.1, Copyright (c) 2000-2012 the Libav developers\n  built on Nov  6 2012 16:51:11 with gcc 4.7.2\n[x11grab @ 0x162fd80] device: :0.0+570,262 -> display: :0.0 x: 570 y: 262 width: 1280 height: 720\n[x11grab @ 0x162fd80] shared memory extension  found\n[x11grab @ 0x162fd80] Estimating duration from bitrate, this may be inaccurate\nInput #0, x11grab, from ':0.0+570,262':\n  Duration: N/A, start: 1353181686.735113, bitrate: 884736 kb/s\n    Stream #0.0: Video: rawvideo, bgra, 1280x720, 884736 kb/s, 30 tbr, 1000k tbn, 30 tbc\n[alsa @ 0x163fce0] capture with some ALSA plugins, especially dsnoop, may hang.\n[alsa @ 0x163fce0] Estimating duration from bitrate, this may be inaccurate\nInput #1, alsa, from 'pulse':\n  Duration: N/A, start: 1353181686.773841, bitrate: N/A\n    Stream #1.0: Audio: pcm_s16le, 48000 Hz, 2 channels, s16, 1536 kb/s\nIncompatible pixel format 'bgra' for codec 'libx264', auto-selecting format 'yuv420p'\n[buffer @ 0x1641ec0] w:1280 h:720 pixfmt:bgra\n[scale @ 0x1642480] w:1280 h:720 fmt:bgra -> w:852 h:480 fmt:yuv420p flags:0x4\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] VBV maxrate unspecified, assuming CBR\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] using cpu capabilities: MMX2 SSE2Fast SSSE3 FastShuffle SSE4.2\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] profile Main, level 3.1\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] 264 - core 123 r2189 35cf912 - H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec - Copyleft 2003-2012 - http://www.videolan.org/x264.html - options: cabac=1 ref=2 deblock=1:0:0 analyse=0x1:0x111 me=hex subme=6 psy=1 psy_rd=1.00:0.00 mixed_ref=0 me_range=16 chroma_me=1 trellis=1 8x8dct=0 cqm=0 deadzone=21,11 fast_pskip=1 chroma_qp_offset=-2 threads=4 sliced_threads=0 nr=0 decimate=1 interlaced=0 bluray_compat=0 constrained_intra=0 bframes=3 b_pyramid=0 b_adapt=1 b_bias=0 direct=1 weightb=0 open_gop=1 weightp=1 keyint=250 keyint_min=25 scenecut=40 intra_refresh=0 rc_lookahead=30 rc=cbr mbtree=1 bitrate=712 ratetol=1.0 qcomp=0.60 qpmin=0 qpmax=69 qpstep=4 vbv_maxrate=712 vbv_bufsize=512 nal_hrd=none ip_ratio=1.25 aq=1:1.00\nOutput #0, flv, to 'rtmp://live.justin.tv/app/live_23011330_Pt1plSRM0z5WVNJ0QmCHvTPmpUnfC4':\n  Metadata:\n    encoder         : Lavf53.21.0\n    Stream #0.0: Video: libx264, yuv420p, 852x480, q=-1--1, 712 kb/s, 1k tbn, 30 tbc\n    Stream #0.1: Audio: libmp3lame, 44100 Hz, 2 channels, s16, 712 kb/s\nStream mapping:\n  Stream #0:0 -> #0:0 (rawvideo -> libx264)\n  Stream #1:0 -> #0:1 (pcm_s16le -> libmp3lame)\nPress ctrl-c to stop encoding\nframe=   17 fps=  0 q=0.0 size=       0kB time=10000000000.00 bitrate=   0.0kbitframe=   32 fps= 31 q=0.0 size=       0kB time=10000000000.00 bitrate=   0.0kbitframe=   40 fps= 23 q=29.0 size=      44kB time=0.03 bitrate=13786.2kbits/s dup=frame=   47 fps= 21 q=31.0 size=      93kB time=2.73 bitrate= 277.7kbits/s dup=0frame=   62 fps= 23 q=29.0 size=     160kB time=3.23 bitrate= 406.2kbits/s dup=0frame=   77 fps= 24 q=23.0 size=     209kB time=3.71 bitrate= 462.5kbits/s dup=0frame=   92 fps= 25 q=20.0 size=     267kB time=4.91 bitrate= 445.2kbits/s dup=0frame=  107 fps= 25 q=20.0 size=     318kB time=5.41 bitrate= 482.1kbits/s dup=0frame=  123 fps= 26 q=18.0 size=     368kB time=5.96 bitrate= 505.7kbits/s dup=0frame=  139 fps= 26 q=16.0 size=     419kB time=6.48 bitrate= 529.7kbits/s dup=0frame=  155 fps= 27 q=15.0 size=     473kB time=7.00 bitrate= 553.6kbits/s dup=0frame=  170 fps= 27 q=14.0 size=     525kB time=7.52 bitrate= 571.7kbits/s dup=0\nframe=  180 fps= 25 q=-1.0 Lsize=     652kB time=7.97 bitrate= 670.0kbits/s dup=0 drop=32\n\n//Here I stop the streaming\n\nvideo:531kB audio:112kB global headers:0kB muxing overhead 1.345945%\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] frame I:1     Avg QP:30.43  size: 39748\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] frame P:45    Avg QP:11.37  size: 11110\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] frame B:134   Avg QP:15.93  size:    27\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] consecutive B-frames:  0.6%  0.0%  1.7% 97.8%\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] mb I  I16..4:  7.3%  0.0% 92.7%\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] mb P  I16..4:  0.1%  0.0%  0.1%  P16..4: 49.1%  1.2%  2.1%  0.0%  0.0%    skip:47.4%\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] mb B  I16..4:  0.0%  0.0%  0.0%  B16..8:  0.1%  0.0%  0.0%  direct: 0.0%  skip:99.9%  L0:42.5% L1:56.9% BI: 0.6%\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] coded y,uvDC,uvAC intra: 82.3% 87.4% 71.9% inter: 7.1% 8.4% 7.0%\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] i16 v,h,dc,p: 27% 29% 16% 28%\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] i4 v,h,dc,ddl,ddr,vr,hd,vl,hu: 22% 21% 14%  8%  8%  8%  7%  5%  7%\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] i8c dc,h,v,p: 47% 22% 20% 11%\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] Weighted P-Frames: Y:0.0% UV:0.0%\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] ref P L0: 96.4%  3.6%\n[libx264 @ 0x165ae80] kb/s:474.19\nReceived signal 2: terminating.\n\nAny ideas on how I can resolve this?

What sort of video chipset does your system have?  You may need to get vdpau (assuming you have nvidia) running in order to get things running properly.\nIt's possible but seems unlikely to me that the problem could be the audio itself - you might try only capturing one channel rather than two and at a lower bitrate, to see if that helps.  I really think it's going to be the video that's the issue, though.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use a PS3 controller to emulate an xbox controller? I have my PS3 controller connected through USB and while that works fine, no applications seem to support its keymap. So my question is whether it's possible to make it emulate an xbox controller similar to what MotionInJoy does on Windows?\nI have done some googling but to no avail. I stumbled upon QtSixA which allows me to assign keys to the controller's buttons, but I don't know what key ids the xbox uses.\n\nA: xboxdrv can do that, but only when the PS3 controller is connected via USB:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/\nAs for the ids, I listed them below, but they won't really help you much. As you can see, Xbox360 USB and Xbox360 Wireless use different ones and most games don't care either way, they just use the button one after another and don't care which button is mapped to which physical button, you have to remap them manually in each game.\nAs for Wine, Wine only supports DirectInput and lacks Xinput support and many modern games require Xinput. To get around that you have to use a Xinput emulation .dll (same trick you have to use on Windows with older gamepads), haven't tried it myself, but it's described here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/xboxdrv/wgY0sp-drD8\n-\nUSB Xbox360 Controller\n======================\n\nstart BTN_START\nguide BTN_MODE\nback  BTN_SELECT\n\na    BTN_A\nb    BTN_B\nx    BTN_X\ny    BTN_Y\n\nlb    BTN_TL\nrb    BTN_TR\n\ntl    BTN_THUMBL\ntr    BTN_THUMBR\n\n\nx1 ABS_X:-32768:32767:16:128\ny1 ABS_Y:-32768:32767:16:128\n\nx2 ABS_RX:-32768:32767:16:128\ny2 ABS_RY:-32768:32767:16:128\n\nlt ABS_Z:0:255:0:0\nrt ABS_RZ:0:255:0:0\n\ndpad_x ABS_HAT0X:-1:1:0:0\ndpad_y ABS_HAT0Y:-1:1:0:0\n\n\nWireless Xbox360 Controller\n======================\ndpad_up    BTN_0\ndpad_down  BTN_1\ndpad_left  BTN_LEFT\ndpad_right BTN_RIGHT\n\nstart BTN_START\nguide BTN_MODE\nback  BTN_SELECT\n\na    BTN_A\nb    BTN_B\nx    BTN_X\ny    BTN_Y\n\nlb    BTN_TL\nrb    BTN_TR\n\ntl    BTN_THUMBL\ntr    BTN_THUMBR\n\nx1 ABS_X:-32768:32767:0:0\ny1 ABS_Y:-32768:32767:0:0\n\nx2 ABS_RX:-32768:32767:0:0\ny2 ABS_RY:-32768:32767:0:0\n\nlt ABS_Z:0:255:0:0\nrt ABS_RZ:0:255:0:0\n\n", "Q: How to find and control the wlan card with setpci?

This is far (!) easier than trying to enable/disable the hardware device with setpci.)\n\nFirst run lspci to find the addresses of all of your hardware; for example, my ethernet controller is\n02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 10)\n\nNow use the bus address/domain (02:00:0) and run lspci again with\nsudo lspci -s 02:00.0 -nnvvxxx\n\nand you will get the full readout of the information available and a hex dump of the PCI configuration space:\n02:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

This can be repeated with the other registers in the list, but again you need to refer to detailed technical information on your devices at the same time.\nIn summary, you will need to refer to the technical specifications of your WLAN card (and possibly PCI specifications) so that you can find and choose the correct register and then refer to the lspci and setpci data so you can prepare the sudo setpci command setting that enables/disables the card. It is not possible to find the correct register without in depth specifications, and often it is difficult to find the correct one anyway. However, I hope that this short discussion might help point you in the right direction. \n", "Q: Installing the third OS I have a laptop which had Windows 7 pre-installed.

If you feel this question is off-topic, please leave a comment explaining why or open a question on Meta.AU.\n\nHow will Qt 5.0 be packaged for Ubuntu when it is released? Currently, the name of the package for installing the Qt 4.8 core libraries is:\nlibqt4-core \nWill the equivalent package for the next version of Qt (5.0) be named libqt5-core? If not, what will the package be named? Will the existing Qt 4.8 libraries coexist with the Qt 5.0 equivalents for the foreseeable future or will they be removed?\nThe Qt 5.0 beta 2 PPA contains a lot of packages - few of which seem to correspond with existing package names.\nIf someone can provide me with a link to a policy outlining the Qt 5.0 migration plan, that would be awesome.\n\nA: Library package names in Ubuntu include the major abi version. Some examples are libc6, libkrb5 and libqt4. So the Qt 5.0 libraries will be libqt5-*. Naming them libqt4-* would be wrong as they are not backwards compatible and packages depending on Qt 4.x would suddenly stop working if Ubuntu would do this. Naming the packages libqt5-* (and taking care of possible filename clashes) allows them to be installed simultaneously so you can run Qt 4.x and Qt 5.x apps on the same machine.\n", "Q: How can I unmount a s3fs mount as a normal user? I use S3 a ton. I have over 40 or so buckets floating around between clients. I like the fact that I can list them in /etc/fstab and that they just work. For reference here is one of the buckets.\n\ncoteyrnet /mnt/S3/coteyrnet fuse.s3fs _netdev,use_cache=/tmp,use_rrs=1,allow_other,noauto,users 0 0\n\nIt mounts fine, but I am having one heck of a time unmounting it. \nThe first problem is:\numount: /mnt/S3/coteyrnet mount disagrees with the fstab\nThe relevant part of mtab is:\ns3fs /mnt/S3/coteyrnet fuse.s3fs rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,user=coteyr 0 0\n\nWhen running mount with no arguments it reports the mount as:\ns3fs on /mnt/S3/coteyrnet type fuse.s3fs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,user=coteyr)\nIn addition to that, if I sudo umount /mnt/S3/coteyrnet I always get \numount: /mnt/S3/coteyrnet: device is busy.\n  (In some cases useful info about processes that use\n  the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1))\nlsof | grep coteyrnet never returns anything of value, nor does fuser. \nMy goal is to get user unmounting working.\nThe inability to mount via sudo has been resolved. By using the  \"use_cache\" setting the files were actually open, but not under the mount point. This is a caveat to that option.  The mount point files are closed but the files were not yet transferred to S3. By waiting \"a while\" and trying again, sudo can unmount.\n\nA: After working with dpb, we have determined that the issue is a bug and not a lack of knowledge or configuration (it can't be fixed by us)\nIssue 309 has been filed with s3fs maintainers.\n\nA: I think /etc/fstab needs the option user.  Right now you said you have:\ns3fs /mnt/S3/coteyrnet fuse.s3fs rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,user=coteyr 0 0\n\nTrying changing that user=coteyr to just user.  That works for me.  When I tried to specify the user with =, it was essentially ignored.\nSee the following output for an example:\ndpb@helo:crash$ mount /mnt/foo\ndpb@helo:crash$ umount /mnt/foo\ndpb@helo:crash$ grep /mnt/foo /etc/fstab\n/dev/vgdata/lvol0 /mnt/foo ext4 defaults,user 0 2\ndpb@helo:crash$\n\nAlternate Solution\nIf this fails, or if you want an alternate approach.  You can set up a sudo rule that allows mounting and unmounting without a password for certain mounts.  Some would claim this is a safer approach, but I'm no security guru.\nMore specifics for fuse.s3fs\nIt appears for umount as a non superuser to succeed, it needs to match what is shown by the mount command.\nIn this case, fstab would need to look like\ns3fs   /mnt/S3/coteyrnet  fuse.s3fs  <options> 0 0\n\nBut, I think you still need a way to specify your unique bucket.  Perhaps try:\ns3fs#coteyrnet  /mnt/S3/coteyrnet  fuse.s3fs  <options> 0 0\n\nThat may be enough to trick mount (I've seen that before in a couple places, and now I'm starting to realize why)\n", "Q: Ubuntu Dual Screen Using Virtual Machine - AMD GPU I've been searching online and reading tutorials and etc about how to make my ubuntu VM dual screen(x86_64).

Thank you in advance.\n\nA: Virtual Box can provide graphics output to multiple virtual monitors. These can either be configured as separate application windows, or can be directed to separate attached physical monitors when in seamless or fullscreen mode.\nThis feature is independent of the physically attached graphic card and can not be achieved by installing proprietary drivers to your virtual machine. Doing so is not recommended, as usually the VM has no direct access to the physical graphics adapter (unless you configured experimental PCI passthrough mode).\nTo enable multiple monitors we can define a monitor count of up to 8 for any virtual machine in the Settings -> Display from Virtual Box Manager:\n\nAfter that we are able to configure these virtual monitors from the \"System Settings ->  Displays... in Ubuntu:\n\nAll monitors will have the name VBX as they are virtually provided from Virtual Box. Which monitor is represented will also be shown in a corresponding coloured box in the virtual window. \nUntick the Option \"Mirror Displays\" in case you want to display different applications on them.\nAfter that we will have two Virtual Box windows numbered :1 and :2 where each can have a different geometry:\n\nVirtual Box on host 12.04 amd64 running a single instance of a guest Ubuntu 12.04 amd64 displayed on two virtual monitor windows\n", "Q: After login I only get a terminal window First of, let me tell you I'm a n00b at ubuntu. I have updated my Ubuntu mediacenter to a later version of ubuntu, currently at 12.04. I'm working through a lot of updates to get to the latest. But since my first update I got the new login screen (lightdm?) and my autologin wasen't working anymore. So I Googled how I could make lightdm autologin. I've managed this by making my /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf look as follows:\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nuser-session=ubuntu\nautologin-user=my_user\nautologin-userutologin-user=-timeout=0\n\nWhich seemed to work... But now that it automatically logs in, I seem to get the following type of screen (through nomachine remote desktop client):\nSorry... I am unable to post my screenshot here because I do not have the 10 reputation points in askubuntu yet.... darn it...\nBut the screen has a terminal at the top left of the screen (not an actual \"window\"), and the ubuntu loading screen is still behind it.\nI've tried running startx as you can see. But, this seems to actually be x server. But if I run unity --reset, it seems that a lot of the desktop gets restored, but... with a lot of errors and warnings and the next time I boot, it's the same story all over again. Also, when I close the terminal window after getting my desktop back, I get thrown back at the login screen.\nPlease bear with my lack of knowledge of ubuntu and it's underlying unix. I thank you in advance.\nEdit: I've just tried disabling the autologin and check if logging in with another user would make a difference. First, I get the login screen as expected. Then I login as a different user then the autologin user (btw, if I try the autologin user from the login screen I get the same result as autologin). Then the screen only shows the background, nothing else, when trying right mouse click, I get the option menu to change background etc... Which I also can open. Nothing more, so no terminal at this user, but nothing else either.\nEdit 2: I've managed to get the other user working again, by going to terminal (CTRL + ALT + T) executing CCSM. There I only had to check \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\". When I did that, the desktop appeared. \nSo I do have a working user now (even after rebooting). But still, the other user still seems screwed. I tried the above there as well, I needed to enable a lot more of options there. ( as mentioned on: http://www.tuxgarage.com/2011/04/missing-top-and-side-panels-in-unity.html) But still, no progress on this user...\n\nA: Well... Apparently, it was a lot easier then I thought. (like always) After enabling some settings in CCSM it still did not work for the one user. Apparently, in my ~/.dmrc, there was a line session=xterm.

I wish to Dual Boot Ubuntu with Windows 7, when i do  the windows setup , do not even get the options to Install Alongside with, Just install or Something else. Someone in another forum said something with the HP BIOS, can not find where to change anything. So what do i have to do so Ubuntu sees my HDD with Windows? Manually make partition? Only have 1 partition my C: Windows. Thanks.\n\nA: Actually, you probably already have four primary partitions on your hard drive.  HP have got in the habit setting up the computer with a partition for the bootloader, a recovery partition, a HP tools partitions, and the partition where they install Windows proper.  All of these have been done as primary partitions, not leaving any options for creating new partitions since four is the maximum allowed on an MBR partition table.\nThe solution normally involves deleting one of the partitions and creating an extended partition which can in turn contain many more partitions.  You can verify that this is the case by booting the Ubuntu LiveDVD and running Gparted.  You can get more of an idea what to expect and how to fix it by looking at this previous question.\nAlternatively you can install Ubuntu as a wubi install.  This is not quite as good as installing alongside Windows because it runs off a virtual disk inside the Windows file system, however it will get you started until you are ready to make some changes to the hard drive.

What's I'm trying to do is to share multiple virtual machines on different disk location with VMware Workstation 9. \nSetup is simple : \n\n\n*\n\n*I have two physical hosts running virtual machines\n\n*Both hosts runs under Ubuntu 12.10 x64. \n\n*I want to have access to my virtual machines wherever the location of the virtual machines on the physical disk. \n\n*I want to use the embedded sharing feature of VMware Workstation\n\n\nOriginally, I was accessing my virtual machines with xrdp. Since I've updated both physical hosts with Ubuntu 12.10, there's a known bug in which prevents me to connect remotely. \nOn the second part, while looking for my solution on the internet, I found this, but it's only a solution for Windows physical hosts.\nThanks you very much for your time! \nDave\n\nA: I found the answer lately while messing around with Ubuntu. It seams like we're able to bind existing folders to other area of the file system and thus, trick VMware Workstation to think that all virtual machines are in the same location. \nHere's the step by step to solve the problem: \n1- Take a look at the shared directory location already configured. To do this, open VMware Workstation -> Edit -> Preferences, then click on the \"Shared VMs\" menu at the left. Adjust all settings to your needs. \n2- Before closing VMware Workstation, remove all virtual machines from your library (DO NOT DELETE FROM DISK, just remove from library, you will understand later). Close VMware Workstation, then, open a terminal and edit /etc/fstab. \n3- Add lines like these: \n/HDDs/sdb2/vm1   /home/name/VMs-Shared/vm1       ext4    bind    0       0\n/HDDs/sdb2/vm2   /home/name/VMs-Shared/vm2       ext4    bind    0       0\n/HDDs/sdc1/vm3   /home/name/VMs-Shared/vm3       ext4    bind    0       0\n\n4- Restart your system or use the following command line: \nsudo mount --bind -a\n\nPlease be advice I'm not sure if this is working, I haven't tested this command for a long time. If you're not sure, just restart the system. \n5- Open VMware Workstation and open all virtual machines from the Shared location (VERY IMPORTANT). Since all VMs are open in the proper location, you just need to right click on a virtual machine -> Manage -> Share.

But now when I run 'fglrxinfo', I get this message:\nX Error of failed request:  BadRequest (invalid request code or no such operation)\nMajor opcode of failed request:  153 (GLX)\nMinor opcode of failed request:  19 (X_GLXQueryServerString)\nSerial number of failed request:  12\nCurrent serial number in output stream:  12\nHow can I get the driver working properly?\n\nA: Currently there is no AMD driver available that installs and is able to run Unity successfully. For more information and follow up on the bug please check out this post\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity does not start after installing the fglrx drivers\nRemove the proprietary driver and use the open-source one for now.\n\nA: The AMD Beta drivers released on 2012-12-03 work for 12.10, as long as you're running single monitor.\nI had this issue and was able to get fglrx to report the video card version properly and my system booted into gnome3 proper with cloned monitors. Trying to enable multi-monitor, though, caused the system (on the next reboot) to fall back into gnome classic with multiplying gnome bars across the main monitor. Moving the mouse toward the second monitor caused it to loop around to the opposite side of the first monitor, very pacman-like. \n@Harris6310, you might try the current beta drivers to see if that solves your issue.\n", "Q: How to use Czech Macintosh keyboard? I just installed ubuntu on my Mac.

I like the browser Epiphany (now Web or something).\nI also hate Flash and I heard about Gnash, its free alternative.\nAll I want to do is to set up Epiphany somehow to use Gnash on YouTube. I can't get that to work.\nI have installed browser-plugin-gnash, but it doesn't do anything. I have plug-ins enabled in Epiphany.

I am not a technical bod; I cannot take this further myself and any help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: It seems I found the answer for the topic starter, also I had to experience it myself.\nAccording to kernel blogs there is a strange behavior then using vfat with \"x-gvfs-show\" option. Now it can be solved by removing this option for vfat partition.\nThe option is used only to show device shortcut in Gnome and Unity then this one is mounted in a location different than \"/media\". So there is a way to configure vfat to be mounted under \"/media\" and to remove \"x-gvfs-show\" option from mount options (Can be easily done via Disks utility). Works very well for me.\n\nA: There's something wrong with the file system on the device.  You might be able to force the mount as read-only for the purpose of backing up your data, which I highly recommend:\nsudo mount /dev/sdg1 /mnt -t vfat -o ro\n\nwhere the device is /dev/sdg as in your example above.\nYou will now find the files on this device until /mnt off the root file system.  Copy the files to another device or the hard drive, then you would be better off deleting even the partition table (not just the partitions) and starting from scratch with this device.\nIf you are not sure which is the correct device name to use type \nblkid\n\nto get a list of devices attached to the system (including hard drives, so be careful)\n", "Q: Installing latest version of R-base I have been unsuccessfully trying to install the latest version (2.15.2) of r-base.

So maybe the best option is to uninstall the old R and install the newer, passing the specific version you want. But before you do that, make a backup of your operating system. It can be difficult to reinstall old the packages after you remove them.\nAlso just a note: if you do sudo apt-get install r-base=2.15.1-5ubuntu1 it will not find a package because the version is wrong. In that repo, the files are named, for example r-base_2.15.2-1quantal2_all.deb, so the correct version should be r-base=2.15.2-1quantal2 or r-base=2.15.2-1quantal2_all, for example.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: One thing I  noticed, if you follow instructions on various R-websites, these will make you add a line to the Linux sources list  /etc/apt/sources.list\nSee, for example, this link: https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-install-r-on-linux-ubuntu-16-04-xenial-xerus/\nHowever, some Linux distros add a line to a separate file in this folder:\n/etc/apt/sources.list.d\nThis can lead to the you have held broken packages error message.\nI commented-out the line (/etc/apt/sources.list) in /etc/apt/sources.list, and added the correct R-repository using the Software Sources manager of my distro (Linux Mint 18.3)\nThis solved the problem.\n", "Q: Ubuntu gets slower by the day Ive noticed that Ubuntu has been getting slower and slower to boot, launch programs, etc. I installed 12.04 about 4 months ago,now 12.10, running on a quad-core Q8300 Intel, 4GB Ram, and an 80GB WD IDE drive. For some reason (ever since 11.04), Ive noticed after installation, the speed is good. The longer I have the OS installed, every bootup gets slower and slower, launching programs get slower, frame rates change radically(onboard GF9400 gets anywhere from 60fps down to 12 in worst cases).\nI would think maybe the HD is the issue, however I installed 11.10 on a 160GB SATA, and the same thing occurred.\nLooking at system resources, I'm holding steady at 1GB memory usage (I have 4GB, but it's actually showing 3.6GB, dunno why), no swap usage, and using right around 4% on cpu currently. HD capacity is only 28% used.\nHas anyone else ran into this issue? I love Ubuntu to death, but using other distros other than Ubuntu, I dont have this problem.\n\nA: There are quite a few things that can effect a computer slowdown that just doesn't seem to have a cause.\nOne is thermal problems, things like processors, Video cards, and memory overheating and causing the machine to throttle back.  Heat sink compound being old, not enough heat sink compound, and in some very rare cases too much heat sink compound, can be the problem.\nDefective and/or dirty fans that cut in and out.\nThere are BIOS settings that can cause slow downs, memory timing issues, wait states, drive controller modes, etc.\nDriver issues can cause slow down problems.\nPower supply problems, even damaged connectors on the cables.\nBad filter caps.\nCards not seated properly in the motherboard.\nYou can even have AC power line problems like drop outs, low line voltage.\nYou could also be having network or internet connection problems, some are real simple things like old cables, blocked Antenna on WiFi, phone line noise on a DSL, or is it time of day related maybe your ISP is bogged down, etc.\nOh and here's a real off the wall one.  Do you have a case with a fan mounted on the side panel?  I saw one customer ware when the user pulled the system open and ran it with the side panel off, everything worked fine, put the side panel on and the computer gradually slowed down.  The power cable for the side fan was sticking in between the CPU fan fins with the side panel on and stopping the fan from starting and then the heat sink would heat up the CPU would throttle down.\nAnd of course we have the old operator error.  Are you drinking too much coffee with lots of sugar and just thinking the machine is getting slow?  LOL!  OK, OK, probably not.\nAnyway a few off the wall ideas that may help.\n", "Q: How does Ubuntu's Application Menu differ from Mac OS As the question says, this is what I was asked today.

As we continue to improve Ubuntu, it\n  will become more like Windows in some respects, and less in others.\n  More like Mac OS X in some ways, less in others. More innovative in\n  some ways, and less in others. We’ll try always to do something not\n  just because others do it, and not just because others don’t do it,\n  but because it’s a good idea.\n\n\nA: the global menu has very little difference to mac OSX , there is no apple button in the top left (equivelant is in the top right) and the menu auto hides when full screen to display the app name instead and returns on mouse over.\n\nA: On Mac OS X, the menu stays on top, all the time. Even when you don't maximize. (Actually, there is no maximizing in OS X. There is this \"full screen mode\", only pretty recently, but it hides the menu.)\nAlso, I am not sure how it is in Ubuntu, but in OS X, Java applications usually share the menu. I just ran NetBeans in Ubuntu and it didn't share the Unity menu for some reason.\nAlso, in OS X, you have an apple menu on the top left which works similarly like the menu at the top right in Ubuntu (About Mac, turn off, and so on), and the name of the application is part of the menu (under the name of the application, you usually have things like per-installation settings, \"about\", and so on).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 startup is slow and dmesg output seems to lose several seconds I use ubuntu on Dell Inspiron n4050.I have upgraded to ubuntu 12.04 from 10.04. \nBut now I find the system startup is a little slow and plymouth only show purple screen without logo during startup.  \nWhen I use dmesg, it shows such messages:\n\n    [    2.497750] EXT4-fs (sda1): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode.

Sorry I can't post it here.\nhttps://docs.google.com/open?id=0B_U5quEFRFT_a2k1WEZPOEU1Mm8\nWhile ubuntu is booting , I also noticed that it appears:/tmp is not ready or present And sometimes follows *Stop saving kernel messages. Is this the reason dmesg lost output?\n\nA: Try install bootchart to figure out bottleneck, where the time gap is spent.\nhttp://www.bootchart.org\n", "Q: Random memory corruption going undetected by memtest86 \n*\n\n*Thinkpad t520; Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS; 3.2.0-33-generic; 16GB of ram.\n\n*Memtest86+ ran for 26 hours, 9 passes, no errors.\n\n*Booted into \"recovery mode\": ran fsck all filesystems - no errors; \"check all packages\" - no errors.\n\n*Apparent random memory corruption: perl/R/chrome segfault every now and then, seemingly at random; sort(1) produces corrupt unsorted files.\n\n\nWhat could be possibly wrong and how do I debug it?\n\nA: There are other tools for RAM testing within Ubuntu. It is possible that they will detect errors that Memtest86+ doesn't, since the errors depend on the patterns written to memory.\nMPrime is a popular RAM and CPU tester. If you use it to test RAM, make sure that you manually specify the amount of memory to use—otherwise it defaults to 1600 MB. E.g.,\nType of torture test to run (3): 13\nMin FFT size (in K) (8): \nMax FFT size (in K) (4096): \nMemory to use (in MB, 0 = in-place FFTs) (1600): 15000\n\nmemtester is another RAM tester and is in the repository.\n\nA: Random memory corruption doesn't tell you that it's for sure memory module problem, there might be lots of other reasons. Starting with software and configuration...\n\n\n*\n\n*You might have been unlucky and your package tree is 1-in-a-million-chance \"internally consistent\", while \"externally inconsistent\" (package and crc corruption resulting in valid package) <- purely theoretical.\n\n*Using not stable branch packages with a bug (software, system or kernel).\n\n*Using stable branch packages with a bug (system bug in your specific hardware and software conditions) or outdated versions.\n\n*Virus, that corrupts in-memory files, like libraries already cached from hdd.\n\n*Kernel problem - one of your kernel drivers is not as stable as it should be. Example? Virtualbox driver is known to cause some random memory problems in host. Other, especially custom (or beta) drivers might cause similar (or other) bad stuff happening.\n\n*Malfunctioning external devices, their drivers might not make some sanity checks... which are not needed for fully operational hardware.\n\n*Hardware problems, while not exactly memory module problem. Malfunctioning internal devices - your chips (like audio/graphics) or pci/pcie cards might be corrupted and might do bad things on your system memory, as they all share the hardware level memory access. Or they might corrupt other parts, that corrupt the memory.\n\n*Environmental problems - Your CPU or bridges might be overheated - (especially the north bridge which connects CPU with system memory, but lately is combined in CPU) - but mind you, they might get overheated from other actions taking place, like GPU-hungry applications (so you won't get any errors in memory-testing software running on VGA session).\n\n\nSo - as you see, there are many different possibilities, but most of the stuff above doesn't happen often in such cases. I'd recommend you trying running the system from liveCD and checking if it segfaults there, if it does, trying to unplug any hardware you don't really need (or disabling it in bios/uefi), then - checking memory module in another computer and checking your computer with different memory module.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Ubuntu support the command 'sh example.sh'? Why doesn't Ubuntu support sh example.sh command?\nIt's more convenient than cd $wd; ./example.sh and add PATH in some situation.\nlogin.sh:\n~/bin/logmitgw.sh -i 4564646 dfdsfsdf\n\nlogmitgw.sh:\nsome code\n\nWhen I'm running  sh ~/bin/login.sh\nI get:\nsh: 0: Can't open ~/bin/login.sh\n\nls -l ~/bin/login.sh outputs -rwxrwxr-x\n\nA: Ubuntu does support running sh example.sh. That works fine if you do everything else right. The problem in your case seems to be that you are giving the incorrect path to the script.\n\nWhen you open a terminal in Ubuntu, it most likely starts a Bash shell. I will assume that to be the case for you.\nAlso, the command sh calls a different shell:\n$ command -v sh\n/usr/bin/sh\n$ ls -l /usr/bin/sh\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Aug  4 11:43 /usr/bin/sh -> /usr/bin/dash\n\nThat is, /usr/bin/sh is a symlink to the dash shell. On some systems, the sh symlink may be to another shell.\nOne thing that might go wrong, is that there is no sh in the system.\nHere is an example script:\n$ echo 'echo \"works!\"' > ~/bin/example.sh\n$ sh ~/bin/example.sh\nworks!\n\nIf I delete the sh symlink, I get an error:\n$ sudo rm /usr/bin/sh\n$ sh ~/bin/example.sh\nbash: /usr/bin/sh: No such file or directory\n\nNote that this is not the error you got.\nI ran sudo ln -s /usr/bin/dash /usr/bin/sh to make the symlink again and get my sh back.\nAnother problem could be that the file is not a shell script, and dash is not able to run it, or it is a shell script, but it is not compatible with dash. In that case, you will get a syntax error of some kind, for example:\n$ file /bin/bash\n/bin/bash: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=a6cb40078351e05121d46daa768e271846d5cc54, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped\n$ sh /bin/bash\n/bin/bash: 1: ELF: not found\n/bin/bash: 2: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string\n$ file /usr/bin/uname\n/usr/bin/uname: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=3354931bca4ff072b26258a956ffde08ead5f341, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped\n$ sh /usr/bin/uname\n/usr/bin/uname: 1: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting \")\")\n\nBut you did not get an error like that.\nWhen the dash shell is asked to run a file that does not exist, it outputs the error you show in your question:\n$ ls ~/bin/anything\nls: cannot access '/home/zanna/bin/anything': No such file or directory\n$ sh ~/bin/anything\nsh: 0: Can't open /home/zanna/bin/anything\n\nThe 0 in this error is the current file:\n$ echo 'echo $0' > ~/bin/something\n$ sh ~/bin/something\n/home/zanna/bin/something\n\nIn your question, you say that you ran\nsh ~/bin/login.sh\n\nand got\nsh: 0: Can't open ~/bin/login.sh\n\nBut that error does not make sense, because the tilde ~ should be expanded to the path of your home directory. Remember my error:\n$ sh ~/bin/anything\nsh: 0: Can't open /home/zanna/bin/anything\n                     ^___^------expansion of ~    \n\nI can reproduce your error by quoting the path:\n$ sh ~/bin/example.sh \nworks!\n$ sh \"~/bin/example.sh\" \nsh: 0: Can't open ~/bin/example.sh\n\nMaybe that is what you did.\nOr, looking at the revision history of your post, it seems you may have run\nsh /bin/login.sh\n\nThat does not work, and will output sh: 0: Can't open /bin/login.sh unless there is a file login.sh in the top level directory /bin. You would probably know if you had created such a file, because you would have had to do so as root.\nAnother reason why you would get the error sh: 0: Can't open /path/to/file, is that you ran sh ~/bin/login.sh but there was no such file. But, the ~ would still have been expanded in that case. Also, you give the first part of the output of ls -l for your file, to show the permissions:\n\n-rwxrwxr-x\n\n\nSo, apparently, ~/bin/login.sh is a regular file with permissions 775. So perhaps that was not the problem.\nNote that, when you call an interpreter, such as (da)sh, to run a script, the script need not have execute permission:\n$ ls -l ~/bin/example.sh\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 zanna zanna 14 Aug  4 11:36 /home/zanna/bin/example.sh\n$ sh ~/bin/example.sh \nworks!\n\nBut your script calls another script, without calling an interpreter to run it. That would cause a permission error if the second script had no execute permission:\n$ echo '~/bin/example.sh' > ~/bin/something\n$ sh ~/bin/something\n/home/zanna/bin/something: 1: /home/zanna/bin/example.sh: Permission denied\n\nBut, once again, this is not the error you got.\nYou accepted the answer by fabricator4, which pointed out that ~/bin is added to PATH if it exists (you can see the code that does this in ~/.profile), so if you have an executable in ~/bin, you can run it without specifying the interpreter, but for that to work, the file must have execute permission:\n$ example.sh\nbash: /home/zanna/bin/example.sh: Permission denied\n$ chmod u+x ~/bin/example.sh\n$ example.sh\nworks!\n\n(Here though the current shell, which we are assuming is Bash, and probably not dash, executes the script, in the absence of any interpreter directive)\nSince that answer worked for you, then it seems that the file existed, it had execute permission, and was a script compatible with Bash. What went wrong with your attempt to run it with the syntax sh example.sh then, seems to have been that you either quoted the path and prevented tilde expansion, or omitted the ~ entirely, thus, in either case, specifying the wrong path to your file.\n\nA: If the script is in ~/bin then ~/bin will already be in the path.  As long as it's a bash script you can execute it from anywhere at all.  No need to shell, no need to cd, and no need to add anything in your path.\neg:\nlogin.sh\n\n", "Q: Connection timeout when accessing Github I have exactly the same problem as described here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12849986/connection-timeout-when-accessing-github\nSo I'll just copy & paste:\n\nI have some weird problems.

It's not something that needs to be done commonly so if changing networks helps, I'd say it's some weird issue with the network, to which Windows is somehow impervious.\n\nA: I could help you diagnose it, if you disable all network applications apart from your application (git client in this case) to minimize the network noise and use tcpdump/wireshark to capture the traffic sent and received when you experience problems.\nMake sure to start capturing before you run the command that's having trouble connecting.\nInstall both programs with:\nsudo apt-get install wireshark tcpdump\n\nand then run \nsudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -o dump.pcap -s 1500\n\nto start capturing before testing.\nIt would be helpful if you capture the traffic during one session that fails and upload the resulting dump.pcap somewhere where I could download it.\n\nA: If you are not behind proxy then ignore this comment.\nI am behind proxy at work and had to configure git to reach through it. Before that I had timeouts for github on Ubuntu machine while Windows machines worked fine.\nSo if you are behind proxy, then open your ~/.gitconfig file and add these lines:\n[http]\n    proxy = http://192.168.219.2:8080\n[https]\n    proxy = https://192.168.219.2:8080\n\nOf course replace IP and port numbers with yours. \nHope this helps\n\nA: I was getting this error while executing 'brew update' in my command line (terminal):\nfatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/': SSLRead() return error -36\nError: Failure while executing: git pull -q origin refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\nI also noticed that none of my browsers were able to connect to the github.com website.\nI solved all the connection issues between my mac OS X Mavericks and github by switching my network wifi connection from 802.11n (5.18GHz) to 802.11g (2.412GHz).\nI don't know why that worked for me, but I'm just glad it's back to normal.\n", "Q: Crron job not running properly Crontab runs my script but file that are fetched are of 0 kb\nand when i am running my script scheduled by own i.e\n./getMSC.sh $1 $2\nits running and files are also fetched\nPlease suggest me why this is hapeening...\n\nA: Usually when a script runs properly if run manually, but fails when run from cron by the same user, the problem is a full path not being specified in the script.  Your PATH variable for an interactive login session is MUCH bigger than the one your cron job is running under; so where, for example, rsync $source $target might work fine from the command line, when run from cron you should specify the full path: /usr/bin/rsync $source $target instead.\nIf this isn't helpful, please post back with more detail about what your script is actually doing, and what specific results you're getting.\n", "Q: Triple Boot Question I have successfully set up a a win7,win8 and Ubuntu 12.10 system. Windows 8 and Ubuntu are located on the same SSD, while windows 7 is located on another SSD. All went great and I can continue playing around with all 3 OS's. My only annoyance is, while restarting, windows 7 boot loader runs first. If I select ubuntu in the win7 manager it then runs grub2 and asks me to select an os. I used easy bcd to add entries into win8's boot manager and was hoping to just use that one. I installed ubuntu's loader on to its own partition. Any suggestions to just use Win8 loader and still be able to choose between all 3?\n\nA: Figured this one out myself. The problem was in settings for easybcd and grub. I achieved my goal by \"hiding\" the grub boot menu from within Ubuntu. Also, when editing entries in easybcd, I checked the \"skip boot menu\" option. I restarted and it booted straight to the pretty blue Win 8 boot menu.\n", "Q: Hardware problem Guys I need help to recover my external hard disk.\nIm using SEGATE FREEAGENT GO 320gb HDD. Recently I tried to format it using command line in win7, but accidentally I removed the hdd before the format is complete and I cannot open it and I tried to recover data using as many software's as I can but no use I have max of 25000 bad sectors. Can i still recover my hdd?\nIs there any way to recover my HDD with max bad sectors using Linux?\n\nA: First if your just trying to get the drive working again then try:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx bs=1M\nmake sure to change /dev/sdx to the correct drive\nThis will basically erase anything and everything on the disk by writing 0s to it. Use with case (you will need to use sudo, I left it out for safety)\nOnce the disk is erased totally (dd should take a long time, maybe even hours) then go ahead and try to use fdisk to partition the drive.\nfdisk /dev/sdx\nAgain this will erase data so use with care and make sure you have the right disk. Finally create a new primary partition, number 1, when asked for start sector, press enter (accepting the default), and do the same (accept the default) when asked for the end sector.\nFinally format the partition by running\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/sdx1\nThis will make the drive ready to use in Linux using the ext4 file system with sensible defaults.\nIf you truly have bad sectors (and it's not just some odd happenstance from your aborted format) Throw the disk out and go get a new one. The are dead cheap, and a disk that has bad sectors will just continue to get worse. I would try the wipe first though. Your \"bad sectors\" are most likely not bad. I haven't see bad sectors in years (like back when 20GB was a lot of data, and that was the biggest drive you could ever get).\n", "Q: Installation problem. \"[Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/target/tmp'\" When I was installing, I got this error from Ubuntu (dialog)\n\nThe installer encountered an error copying files to the hard disk:\n[Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/target/tmp'\n\nThis is often due to a faulty hard disk.

When editing images I often do generational saves, so that if I don't like a subsequent process I can easily go back to the previous save and try again.  This would have also helped you in this case because while you might have lost some work, you would not have lost everything.\nTo do a generational save, I simply add a number to the end of the filename:\nfilename.png  (original camera image) \nfilename1.png (first generation edit) \nfilename2.png (second generation edit)\n\nand so on.  If I produce subsequent images with different resolutions or for specific purposes then I append that information also.  Yes you can get a lot of files this way, but you'll notice that it saves all of your work right back to the original camera image or draft.\n\nA: .ora files are OpenRaster format files. MyPaint uses it but also some other programs.\nIf MyPaint refuses to open the file I would try to open them with an alternative and see if the same happens, you might be lucky and be able to save it in another format or recover your work that way.\nKnown programs that can use .ora files are:\n\n\n*\n\n*MyPaint\n\n*GIMP\n\n*Krita\n\n*DrawPile\n\n*Nathive\n\n*Pinta\n\n*XnView\n\n\nMost of those are open-source and available to be installed in your system.

I configured this:\nAutomatically check for updates: Never\n\nBut the update manager keeps poping up against my wishes, I have no control. I feel like I'm using Windows again.\nI want to be able to install updates from time to time, manually.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Edit  /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and set:\nPrompt=never\nchange this with your favorite editor). \nNever use update-manager with -d this checks whether the next release is available or not.\n\nA: We have installed Ubuntu 20.04 on our local server and installed Lubuntu desktop on it for GUI. We have disabled the update-notifier pop up by uninstalling its package from the server. Below is the command of it.\n# sudo apt-get --purge remove lubuntu-update-notifier\n\nI think the above command will be helpful to you.\n\nA: You've set it to never check for updates, but you'll find the update manager is opening because it already knows there are updates to be done.  Do the updates that it has and it won't bother you again until you update the file lists.\nIt's a bit like terminal will tell you when there are updates in the apt list that have been put there with 'apt-get update', and will keep on reminding you until you install them. \n\nA: It is good that Ubuntu automatically checks for updates, it is not good that it pops-up windows against your will. You can have less invasive notifications via the gnome bar or from terminal based applications (like Byobu).\nTo disable the update-notifier while leaving the update-manager automatically checking for updates, run the following from a terminal: \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install gconf-editor in case you don't have it already installed\n\n*sudo gconf-editor mind the sudo attribute\n\n*search for app->update-notifier and un-tick the \"auto-launch\" option\n\n*close the window\n\n*gconf-editor this time as a user (i.e. without sudo)\n\n*search again for app->update-notifier and change the \"regular_auto_launch_interval\" to the number of days you want it to wait before popping-up (0 is immediately, 1 one day, 99999999 basically never again)\n\n\nA: pkill update-notifier\nsudo mv /usr/bin/update-notifier /usr/bin/update-notifier.real\necho -e '#!/bin/bash\\nwhile :; do /bin/sleep 86400; done' | sudo tee /usr/bin/update-notifier\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/update-notifier\n\nBrutal, but effective.\n\nA: I do not like automatic updates so I want to disable them always.\nI use Ubuntu 14.04 with Gnome desktop environment. gsettings may not be available in other Ubuntu flavors.\nOn slow internet connections disabling apt-xapian-index prevents automatic package downloading which will take all your bandwith (I have 256 kb/s mobile sometimes).\nsudo chmod a-x /etc/cron.daily/update-notifier-common \nsudo chmod a-x /etc/cron.weekly/apt-xapian-index \nsudo chmod a-x /etc/cron.weekly/update-notifier-common \n\ngsettings set com.ubuntu.update-notifier regular-auto-launch-interval 3650\ngsettings set com.ubuntu.update-manager launch-time 1900000000\n\nSeemed to do the trick for me. 3650 means days...\n1900000000 tells that the update-manager is last run on year 2030 :)\nUpdate: On Ubuntu 16.04 it seems that you are able to disable automatic updates with following commands and by editing two files:\nsudo mv /etc/xdg/autostart/update-notifier.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/update-notifier.desktop.old \nsudo mv /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-software-service.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-software-service.desktop.old\n\nIf extension is other than .desktop these commands won't be run on system start.\nEdit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic\nAPT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"0\";\nAPT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages \"0\";\nAPT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval \"0\";\n\nEdit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades\nAPT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"0\";\nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"0\";\n\nIf you have started Update manager even ONCE these files will contain four lines:\nAPT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"0\";\nAPT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages \"0\";\nAPT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval \"0\";\nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"0\";\n\nJust change all values to \"0\"\n\nA: For Ubuntu 16.04, and possibly other releases as well:\nsudo chmod 000 /usr/bin/update-manager\nsudo chmod 000 /usr/bin/update-notifier\n\nThen reboot.  (Alternatively, it is possible that merely logging out and back in is sufficient.)\nYou can verify that update-manager is not running by examining the output of:\nps auxwww | grep update\n\n(Aside: Other posters have suggested sudo apt-get purge update-notifer*.  However, I prefer not to remove packages that might be tangled up in the various desktop meta-packages.)\n\nA: Disabling the popups in the configuration seems not to be possible, as told by coteyr in the comments on this page (https://askubuntu.com/a/218780/19753: \"It's important to note that other then removing update-manager-core you can't really stop the popup. You can just delay it till something else runs apt-get update\" – coteyr Nov 18 '12 at 9:14).\nI also wanted to get rid of the popups and of the underlying program that would consume the resources of my Ubuntu 12.04 system on a weak Toshiba AC100 (ARM) -- https://answers.launchpad.net/ac100/+question/214505/.\nSo the simplest working solution must be removing the \"update-manager\" (as I've mentioned in the comments at https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/46315/4319 ):\napt-get remove update-manager\n\nI have had no problems after that because I could still use apt-get or synaptic to do package updates.\nUseful comments:\nantivirtel: on 16.10 it couldn't be removed, since it will remove other packages, like ubuntu-desktop. A possible solution: remove the binary file (/usr/bin/update-manager) or chmod -x /usr/bin/update-manager, and apt hold package to prevent updates (echo update-manager hold | sudo dpkg --set-selections).\nmchid: ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage so you can remove it without removing the actual desktop so that shouldn't be a problem.\nDylan Parry: It's probably better to just remove update-notifier rather than the entire update manager. Remember to run pkill update-notifier after removing it (or reboot), otherwise Ubuntu will show an error in the indicator panel.\n\nA: Open up the config file that runs the update-manager part after apt\nnano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99update-notifier\n\nAdd '#' infront of the line making it something similar to:\n#DPkg::Post-Invoke {\"if [ -d /var/lib/update-notifier ]; then touch /var/lib/update-notifier/dpkg-run-stamp; fi; if [ -e /var/lib/update-notifier/updates-available ]; then echo > /var/lib/update-notifier/updates-available; fi \"; };\n\nDone. \nThis worked for me in stopping the update manager popping up after every apt update while still allowing me to run update-manager manually if i wanted to.\n\nA: I am not sure why anyone has not tried this.\nI simply disable all checkpoints under \"ubuntu software\" and \"other software\" in \"software and updates\", besides setting options under \"automatic updates\" and \"check for newer version\" to \"never\". This avoids any check up as there is no link, hence no pop-up.\nMy main pain point was that these updates eat lot of internet data. For people on move, 3G/4G data is expensive and we'd like to optimize its usage. Hope ubuntu understands this concern and provides simpler options to disable updates completely as per user requirements. \n\nA: In Ubuntu 20.04 executing\nsudo apt remove update-manager\nas suggested by Ivan Zakharyaschev in accepted answer after some time leads to appearing \"red circle with a horizontal white line through, it persist on the panel in the top right\" as described here.\nReinstalling update-manager removes this red circle warning but it is a bit tricky. Instruction to reinstall it is here.\nFor me to disable update notifications popups helped the following commands:\n\n*\n\n*pkill update-notifier\n\n*sudo chmod -x /usr/bin/update-notifier\nThis approach also works in Ubuntu 22.04.\n\nA: Just turning off notification of updates will not be enough. There are several background jobs that run apt-get update (including a nightly cron job if I remember right).\nTo stop the pop-up run update-manager\nThen in settings, set Update automaticly to 'Never' and Notify of new version to 'Never'\n\nI suggest leave security at immediately and, setting \"others\" to every two weeks.\nYou also need to make sure your not running apt-get update anywhere else. This can happen when you install software, run update-manager, or in a cron job.\nIf that doesn't work for you:\nYou can do this by \nediting  /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic and changeing \n\nAPT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"1\";\n\nto \n\nAPT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"0\";\n\nLast Resort\nYou can also do apt-get remove update-manager to remove the feature all together.\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 running Gnome Session\nYou can fix that by removing \"Update Notifier\" from the \"Startup Applications.\"\nFirst allow it to display in the list of your startup applications.\nsudo sed --in-place 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/update-notifier.desktop\n\nThen uncheck the item here:\ngnome-session-properties\n\nThis way you don't need to make any changes in your auto-update configuration (but you can if you want to), rename system files nor remove packages.\n\nA: To disable the popup you must disable the program responsible for displaying them, which is update-notifier.\nStop active update-notifier:\n\n*\n\n*pkill update-notfier\nDisable the autostart on login for current user:\n\n*\n\n*cp /etc/xdg/autostart/update-notifier.desktop ~/.config/autostart/update-notifier.desktop\n\n*echo \"X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false\" >> ~/.config/autostart/update-notifier.desktop\nTested on Ubuntu 18.04.5\n\nA: If the goal is just to get rid of that annoying popup message, it can be done (and undone later) easily. The UpdateManager is just a python package, so:\nIn text editor with root privileges open\nUpdateManager.py\nsudo gedit /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/UpdateManager/UpdateManager.py\n\nIn function     UpdateManager.start_available\n(string # 237)\ninsert return statement, so as the result looks like:\ndef start_available(self, cancelled_update=False, error_occurred=False):\n    self._look_busy()\n    self.refresh_cache()\n\n    return   # <<<--- added statement\n\n    if self.cache is None:\n        return\n\n    pane = self._make_available_pane(self.cache.install_count\n                                     + self.cache.del_count,\n                                     os.path.exists(REBOOT_REQUIRED_FILE),\n                                     cancelled_update, error_occurred)\n    self._start_pane(pane) \n\nSave the result and that is it.\nIf later you decide to enable the message back, you just remove that return statement.\n\nA: I had a similar issue.

The best you can do is to enable edge stickiness. In ccsm (not installed by default because it's unstable as all get out), go to Window Management and enable \"Snapping windows\". \nMake sure all 4 check boxes are checked and set resistance to 60 and attraction to 20. \nThis should help you keep your windows on a workstation. \nHowever this is one of those taste things.

The embedding is possible using flashmovie LaTeX package, for example:\n\\flashmovie[width=10cm,height=5cm,auto=1]{yournameforvideofile.swf}\n\nI have recently tested it again in current Ubuntu 16.04 and TeXlive 2015 LaTeX distribution and it works well.\n", "Q: \"The volume boot has only 0 bytes disk space remaining\" After a recent update, I'm getting an alert saying:\nThe volume boot has only 0 bytes disk space remaining\n\nBut my computer has plenty of HD space free. Does anyone know how I resolve this. (If it's relevant, I'm using the whole disk encryption feature of the alternate install image for Ubuntu 12.04).\n\nA: It might be that your /boot partition has accumulated too many kernel versions while doing upgrades over time. This partition is likely to be separate from your large disk partition (mounted as /). You can check the /boot partition space like this (look for the line with /boot):\ndf -h\n\nThere is a nice page on how to remove old kernels.\nIn short, check your current kernel version, get the list of what is installed, and then apt-get remove the old versions. There is also a \"magic\" one-liner command on the page that will do all that for you. But use it at your own risk.\nInstructions in more detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the current kernel version, the one you want to keep:\nuname -r\n\n\n*Get the list of all kernels installed:\ndpkg -l | grep linux-image-\n\n\n*Run apt-get remove on the kernels you want to remove. Not on the latest one! For example:\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-2.6.32-22-generic\n\nMore notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*dpkg -l will tell you the status of the (kernel) package before the package name. \nFor example:\nrc  linux-image-3.13.0-39-generic  ...\nii  linux-image-3.13.0-40-generic  ...\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\"rc\" means that the package is removed and has configuration files. These you do not need to remove any more.\n\n*\"ii\" means that the package is marked for installation and is installed\n\n\nBased on this, you could list only the kernel packages that are installed:\ndpkg -l | grep \"ii.*linux-image-\"\n\n\nAlternative solution, using GUI tool Ubuntu Tweak.\nInstall and go to Computer Janitor, check the System->Old Kernel and System->Unneeded packages, and press Clean. \n\nA: To list all kernel:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep \"linux-image-[[:digit:]].*\" | tr \"\\t\" \";\" | cut -d \";\" -f1\nThe results looks somewhat like this:\nlinux-image-3.19.0-7-generic \nlinux-image-3.18.0-13-generic  \nlinux-image-3.16.0-23-generic\n\nDon't delete all kernels, only old ones!\nNext let's remove the 3.16 kernel,\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.16.0-23-generic\nand then all unused packages from the system:\nsudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get autoremove\n\nA: Use this script so that will remove all other old kernels leaving current version and previous (last 1 kernel version) \nKERNELMAGES=`ls -lRt /boot/vmlinuz-*| awk -F/ '{print $3}' | grep -v $(uname -r) | sed 1d | sed -e 's/vmlinuz/linux-image/g'`\n\nKERNELHEADERS=`ls -lRt /boot/vmlinuz-*| awk -F/ '{print $3}' | grep -v $(uname -r) | sed 1d | sed -e 's/vmlinuz/linux-headers/g'`\n\nfor PURGEKERNEL in `echo $KERNELMAGES $KERNELHEADERS`; do\n\napt-get autoremove -y && apt-get purge $PURGEKERNEL -y\n\ndone\n\n\nA: The cause was indeed old kernel images.\nTo clean up all I had to do was run one line:\nsudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThis automatically recognized old kernals and removed them.\n", "Q: Can't make Unity Launcher appear I have Ubuntu 12.10 and I want to make unity launcher to auto-hide but when it hides it doesn't appear again unless I press the start button. Should I reinstall unity through terminal? I don't have any updates and the fastest speed and sensivity didn't work.\n\nA: I had the same problem. In my case it was related to the compability nvidia-current-updates (wich I installed before the upgrade to 12.10) with compiz.\nI fixed it by installing the version 310.19 of the nvidia driver avaiable through this ppa (this is not the official supported version on ubuntu, but works pretty well):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nIn order to get this fix to work, you may have to reboot after installing the ppa. \n\nA: The thing you refer to as Unity is \"Launcher\".

The windows-manager should automatically restart if its process is terminated, but sometimes it don't happen. I first would recommend the system reboot, so the windows-manager would be started automatically by the own system. If it did not happened you could try to run it manually from the Terminal, with the following command:\n$ compiz\n\nOr\n$ compiz --replace\n\n\nA: I found a solution that is available on here under Open Up a Window in Center\nIt simply works for me and the windows appear as what I want.\nNow I am able to ALT+Drag the windows, the buttons are showing up too.\n\nI still consider my situation (before solve) a bug, since I can't Alt+Drag the window, and after restore down the window, the three buttons not showing up as shown in the images under the question.

Under Ubuntu 10 I could easily open as many Terminal instances as I needed, and I often need 6 or more.  How can I do that in Ubuntu 12?  When are they going to fix the bug that restricts me to only one? \n\nA: There is absolutely nothing in Ubuntu that restricts you to opening only one terminal window. At the moment I have anout 30 terminal windows open :)\n\nA: Difference between Gnome 2 and the \"new\" Unity\nI think you are referring to the behavior of the panel on the left side of screen which is now similar to a mac. When you click on an icon, the application is started. If, however, the application is running already, you will switch to its window. \nFor users of good old Gnome 2, this may be irritating. There, starters were for starting applications. No matter how often you click them and no matter what is already running, they start a new window. Switching between windows was done via a separate panel which lists all running application. \nIn Unity, the panel takes over both tasks. Launching and switching to applications. It assumes that the typical use case is to have one instance of an application open and maybe use its built-in tab support.\nMultiple Windows in Unity\nHowever, there is a possibility to open multiple windows by using just the mouse. Just right click on the element and select New Terminal. A more convenient way involving also the keyboard is holding Shift and left clicking on the application icon. \nA third possibility to start the terminal (which is the one I prefer) is using the shorcut Ctrl+Alt+T. \nChoose what you like most. \nAs you can see, its not a bug, its just a big change on the user interface.\n\nA: bash is just the shell. You can open as many as you like. Terminal on the other hand is the application that emulates a terminal. \nSo there are several ways.\nThe text way:\nCtrl+Alt+F1 -Ctrl+Alt+F6 (by deafult)\nThe old school way\nUsing screen or bashes background job support More info\nOr in gnome\nWhich is what I suspect you want. Just lauch gnome terminal several times. There's the File-> New Terminal option, and if all else fails you can always start several terminals from terminal.\ngnome-terminal --window --window --window --window --window --window\nwhich will spawn 6 new terminal windows.\nI do not know of a bug that restricts you to one terminal. I frequently use 4 or more for rails development. \n\n\n*\n\n*Spork\n\n*Autotest\n\n*Guard (long story)\n\n*The Rails console\n\n\nIf you need a more in depth example my autotest script runs (please excuse the poor formating the site did):\n\n!/bin/bash\n  source /home/coteyr/.bash_profile  \ngnome-terminal --working-directory=\"$1\" --profile=rails --tab --title=\"DRB\" --command=/home/coteyr/.bin/spork.sh --tab --title=\"Testing\" --command=/home/coteyr/.bin/auto-test.sh --tab --title=\"Reload\" --command=/home/coteyr/.bin/reload.sh\n\n\nA: This applies to Unity\nsumpfomat mentioned Ctrl+Alt+T will open a new terminal window. You can repeat that as many times as you like and open new terminals. But there is another possibilty: in an already open terminal Ctrl+Shift+T will add a new tab to the already open terminal. From the terminals menu this is File -> Open Tab.\nYou can open as many tabs as you like. To navigate between them you can use Alt+[1,2,3,..]\nThis is really handy if you need to run processes in the foreground that don't need much direct input (watchers for things like sass, continuous testing etc). Everything is contained in one terminal process so Alt+Tabing is not a mess, but you can easily switch between your tabs as well.\n", "Q: Is it possible yet to synchronise music to an iPhone running iOS 5/6? Is it possible yet to synchronise music to an iPhone running iOS 5/6?\nI tried it in the Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) live environment, but I didn't have any luck with Banshee or Rhythmbox.\nIs there some way to do it?\n\nA: Currently there is no linux software (or library) that can successfully read, write and update an iOS device's music library running iOS 5 or higher. All applications (that I know of), are dependent on libgpod for this functionality and libgpod has not worked properly with the current versions of iOS for some years now, ever since the database version (DBVersion) of the iTunes library within the device hit version 5. \nYour best bet right now is iTunes via wine.\n\nA: You can try Ubuntu One Music streaming. I'm shifted to subj after almost year not very fruitfull experience with ITunes(vm)/Banshee/Rhytmbox and honestly can say that's a real improvement in my ubuntu/iphone using.\nP.S. I'm also dind't have any luck in syncing IOS6 with any player (Ubuntu 12.10).\n\nA: Getting the iOS (iPhone/iPad) music player to sync with Ubuntu/Linux based players such as Rhythmbox or Banshee can be a game of cat and mouse as someone else put it. Often there will just not be any way to do it, or only a way that requires level-5 Linux and/or iOS skills. Even if someone manages after many hours of forensic investigation to get it to work, just wait for the next iOS update from Apple changing stuff around or introducing a new “security feature” and – swooooosh - down the hose go all those hours of IT sleuthing. \nInstead of indulging Apple in this game one may choose to engage in a little lateral thinking. By-passing/eliminating Apple prop software by replacing the built-in music player with a third-party app is an easy and sustainable way. A rudimentary example would be installing Oplayer on one’s iDevice and using its HTTP-based file import feature over wifi to get the files from Ubuntu’s music folder. This is not an automatic sync and requires manual work each time one wants to transfer files. It also does not afford us many of the advanced features of, say, an iTunes platform. But at least it works right away and you can have some albums from Ubuntu on your iPhone in minutes. Still, it leaves much to be desired. The dissatisfied user may therefore look for ways to expand on the basic solution and try, say, Dropbox for an automatic sync. Or consider setting up a Samba server on Ubuntu and use the built-in Samba functionality of Oplayer to sync up. Oplayer supports pretty much any and all audio and video formats so unlike with Apple prop software, no need for converting stuff either. \nhttp://www.pocketmeta.com/review-oplayer-best-video-music-media-player-ios-2380/\nAlternatively, one may look into several other iOS apps to achieve a different work-around (e.g. look at FileExplorer Free or MewSeek). The one thing to avoid is to try to tackle the problem head-on! \n\nA: There are plenty of iPod managers out there on the Software center, just type iPod in the search bar.

If we assume that the \"move partition\" operation of GParted is correct, 4GB should be a limit on the amount of data that could have been lost. (Otherwise, the \"move partition\" operation likely could not complete without loss of data).\nIndeed, I was able to recover my directory tree, albeit a bit shuffled (since the move operation had been interrupted, a strange directory configuration resulted, where about half of my home directory was inside one folder).\nThe answer was testdisk, which was able to detect the filesystem in question. After this was detected, I copied the files onto an external HD. This learning experience has brought me closer to enlightenment via http://www.taobackup.com/.\n\nA: Your data is pretty much toast.

I want to boot an older kernel but the boot menu is missing?\n\nA: Hold down shift when starting your computer, and keep holding it until you see the grub menu. This will prevent it from booting automatically.\nYou can also permanently make the menu show. I'm using 12.04 so I can't check, but you should be able to find a file /boot/grub/grub.conf with a timeout option. You can set it to something like 10 seconds, which will display the menu for 10 seconds before booting automatically. Edit it with \nsudo nano /boot/grub/grub.conf\n\nand then run\nsudo update-grub\n\nto apply the changes and try rebooting.\n\nA: While booting, keep the SHIFT key pressed.\nThe GRUB menu should show up, then.\nThanks, mjchopperboy\n", "Q: How is the Lenovo U410 Ultrabook support for Ubuntu?

First,  write down the drive's name, then write down some of those folders in that drive. Then go to Windows 7 and check if the folders match.

How do I restore it? Trying to set the default Python version to 2.7, I ran this command:\nsudo rm /usr/bin/python*\n\nNow when I type python or python2.7, I see these error messages: \nbash: /usr/bin/python: No such file or directory\nbash: /usr/bin/python2.7: No such file or directory\n\nWhat happened? Should I have run the rm command? How can I undo it?\n\nA: Well, isn't normal that if you remove an executable, the system can't find it anymore?\n/usr/bin/python is a symlink provided by the python-minimal package. You can restore it reinstalling the package:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall python-minimal\n\n\nA: If you have python2.7-minimal (or any of the other variants) installed, you should have the file /usr/bin/python2.7 present. Normally, /usr/bin/python will be symlinked to this file, so that a simple call of python actually ends up running /usr/bin/python2.7.\nme@banshee:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/python*\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       9 Apr 17  2012 /usr/bin/python -> python2.7\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       9 Apr 17  2012 /usr/bin/python2 -> python2.7\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2989480 Aug  1 01:40 /usr/bin/python2.7\n\nIf you do have /usr/bin/python2.7 but you're missing /usr/bin/python, you can simply recreate it from the command line:\nyou@yourbox:~$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python\n\nIf you're missing /usr/bin/python2.7, you'll need to reinstall it (again) as proposed by the other answers. Please post back here if that's the case.\n\nA: From a terminal, type sudo apt-get install --reinstall python2.7\n", "Q: How can I create a \"built-in\" color scheme for GNOME Terminal? GNOME Terminal has a few built-in color schemes:\n\nHow can I add more to this list?\n\nA: Although there is a similar question at Unix&LInux, I can perhaps add some new information and expand some of the points made there in order to give you a few useful pointers. However, it is true to say that you cannot add another 'built in' scheme to the menu as those existing ones are defined in the source code, as you can see if you examine the latest code release. \nYou could of course patch the source to include your scheme in the choices and then compile the program, but there are some other alternatives which centre around scripting and which I discuss further below.\nIf you created a color scheme by experimenting with the menus (as in the screenshot below), \n\nyou could back it up by noting the instructions in this answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to store my gnome terminal color palette\nOr you could run gconftool-2 -R /apps/gnome-terminal >> file.txt and then use those values in the resulting text file as the basis for a script. A script would be best, as it would be tedious to manually reapply those values by using gconftool-2 or even by editing the .xml file from the correct profile in /home/mike/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal.\nSo it seems that scripting is the easiest way to apply or reapply your color scheme settings to any gnome-terminal profile of your choice.\nA good model could be provided by the solarised color scheme, which is itself based on the work here. As noted at the github page,\n\nIn Gnome terminal, you can add or edit profiles from the menu bar. However,\n  this functionality is not easliy available from command line.  Here, you'll\n  find a script that will set the palette colors, foreground, background and\n  highlight colors to a light or dark color scheme, overwriting a color profile\n  you choose.\n\nIt would seem to be possible to adapt the method used for scripting the solarised color scheme, and substitute your own color palettes, etc. After running in terminal\ngit clone git://github.com/sigurdga/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized.git\n\nand then using cd to get to the resulting folder, you could examine the scripts and files. In the gnome-terminal-colors-solarized folder, there is a script called install.sh in which gconftool-2 is used to apply the values which are specified in the files in the color sub-folder. \nIt should be possible to create your own custom profile and then change the values of the files in the colors folder, and tweak the scripts if necessary, and then you should be able to apply and reapply your own color scheme, just like you can with the solarised scheme. \nIf you want to produce a really interesting and original color scheme you might need to do some reading and research from here and other sources on terminal color schemes, and which are best for long periods of terminal usage.\n\nA: From this answer, the color palettes list is hardcoded, so you can't edit it.\nBut you can simulate that list with bash script files, where each file is a color palette. \nThis awesome project might help to build these scripts:\n\n4bit Terminal Color Scheme Designer\n\nA: This small script (from the Tomorrow Night theme), besides being an older version will get the job of installing the said theme, and is also rather easy to comprehend.\ntomorrow-theme / Gnome-Terminal / setup-theme.sh\n#setup-theme.sh\n####!/usr/bin/env sh\ngconftool-2 -s -t string /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/palette \"#000000000000:#919122222626:#777789890000:#AEAE7B7B0000:#1D1D25259494:#68682a2a9b9b:#2B2B66665151:#929295959393:#666666666666:#CCCC66666666:#B5B5BDBD6868:#F0F0C6C67474:#8181A2A2BEBE:#B2B29494BBBB:#8A8ABEBEB7B7:#ECECEBEBECEC\"\ngconftool-2 -s -t string /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/background_color \"#1d1d1f1f2121\"\ngconftool-2 -s -t string /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/foreground_color \"#c5c5c8c8c6c6\"\ngconftool-2 -s -t string /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/bold_color \"#8A8ABEBEB7B7\"\ngconftool-2 -s -t bool /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/bold_color_same_as_fg \"false\"\ngconftool-2 -s -t bool /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/use_theme_colors \"false\"\ngconftool-2 -s -t bool /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/use_theme_background \"false\"\n\n", "Q: Fan running continously on HP Pavillion G6 notebook with 12.04.1 LTS, help please?

integrated IronLake graphics (I think thats Intel HD 4000 although I'm not entirely sure).\nThe funny thing is that I have a few native Linux games, such as Humble Bundle 2 and 4, and seperate copies of Amnesia etc.\nWhat's odd is that some of these games will show about a 3rd of the screen whilst others display normally.\nSounds strange I know but for instance, if I play 0AD, I get the full screen experience with no issues whatsoever.\nHowever, Amnesia is a different story altogether, since there it seems as if the game is expecting my monitor to be much larger than it is and I see about a third of the top and a third of the left making the game unplayable.\nUnfortunately, Amnesia is not the only one. One or two of the Humble Bundle games experience the same trouble.\nIt's gotten to a point where it's a hit-and-miss on whether a game works fine or not.\nDoes anyone have any advice?\nAnd on a slightly related question, my Fn buttons don't work for brightness and gamma etc, anyone know how to get them to work? (since that's not my original question it's not too important).\nThanks\nArthur\n\nA: I've had similar problems with my games under linux like that.

This seems trivial but neither\nInformation about SATA, IDE (PATA) controllers, lshw nor gnome-disk-utility\ncan tell me if the SATA ports on my mainboard are SATA I, II or even III. \nOutput of sudo lshw -html > hardwareprofile.html is\nhttp://pastebin.com/mBxEEbEL\nI want to buy a new hard drive. \n\nA: Probably the best way is to check the BIOS, which will have very detailed information about SATA ports and their respective controller chips. It is also worth looking at the manual for your motherboard to be sure on the exact specifications. However, there are some ways to give an indication of the SATA version used on your motherboard.\nOne of the most useful tools is hdparm. You can use it to see how your hard disk is connected by noting which type of SATA ports and the approximate transfer speeds are reported when entering: \nsudo hdparm -I /dev/sda \n\nMore information is available by looking at man hdparm or the Ubuntu manpage online. \nYou can also receive information from the kernel ring buffer by using:\ndmesg | grep SATA\n\nwhich should report the link speed of your SATA boot drive.\nFore more information see: this useful article and also this one.\n\nA: So the 82801JI (ICH10 Family) Intel handbook states:\n\nThe ICH10 has two integrated SATA host controllers that support independent DMA\n  operation on up to six ports and supports data transfer rates of up to 3.0 GB/s\n  (300 MB/s). The SATA controller contains two modes of operation – a legacy mode\n  using I/O space, and an AHCI mode using memory space. Software that uses legacy\n  mode will not have AHCI capabilities.\nThe ICH10 supports the Serial ATA Specification, Revision 1.0a. The ICH10 also\n  supports several optional sections of the Serial ATA II: Extensions to Serial ATA 1.0\n  Specification, Revision 1.0 (AHCI support is required for some elements).\n\n3.0 GB/s is SATA II; so I am fairly confident this chipset supports SATA II.\n", "Q: 12.04 sshd_config file is empty, but my ssh_config is not empty Please know I am no sysadmin.  \nYesterday I re-installed UBUNTU 12.04 LTS - running 3.2.0-33-generic-pae.\nI have worked for hours trying to install vsftpd to no avail, and now find myself trying to configure sftp via the sshd, if that makes sense.\nps -ef |grep ssh\n00:00:00 /usr/bin/ssh-agent /usr/bin/dbus-launch --exit-with-session gnome-session --session=ubuntu\nNOTICE THE SIZE of my sshd_config\nls -la /etc/ssh/\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 125749 Apr  2  2012 moduli\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1669 Nov 18 11:58 ssh_config\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1668 Nov 18 11:47 ssh_config~\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     20 Nov 18 11:25 sshd_config\n-rw------- 1 root root    672 Nov 18 11:29 ssh_host_dsa_key\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    598 Nov 18 11:29 ssh_host_dsa_key.pub\n-rw------- 1 root root    227 Nov 18 11:29 ssh_host_ecdsa_key\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    170 Nov 18 11:29 ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub\n-rw------- 1 root root    973 Nov 18 11:29 ssh_host_key\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    638 Nov 18 11:29 ssh_host_key.pub\n-rw------- 1 root root   1675 Nov 18 11:29 ssh_host_rsa_key\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    390 Nov 18 11:29 ssh_host_rsa_key.pub\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    302 Jan 10  2011 ssh_import_id\n\nwhen I sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart it starts the ssh, but why not the sshd?\nThank You,\nDavid\n\nA: You can't have sshd running with a bad sshd_config.  I don't know what's in that 20 byte sshd_config of yours, but it's broken.  Probably best to just reinstall the default at this point.\nI've recreated your problem here in a VM:\nroot@ubusrv:/etc/ssh# ps wwaux | grep ssh | grep -v grep\nroot    1277   0.0  1.1   49948   2812 ?

Ss  15:37  0:00 /usr/sbin/sshd -D\n\nSo, a completely blank sshd_config is sufficient to get it started.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO THIS, HOWEVER.  Instead, let's purge openssh-server and reinstall it, to restore the ORIGINAL, default sshd_config:\nroot@ubusrv:/etc/ssh# apt-get purge openssh-server ; apt-get install openssh-server\nroot@ubusrv:/etc/ssh# ps wwaux | grep ssh | grep -v grep\nroot    1762   0.0  1.1   49948   2820 ?

I had policy kit launched at startup but the package policykit-1-gnome was not installed. Once installed it worked !\n", "Q: Dual OS onHDD. Standard Linux boot hangs. Safe boot option to retry standard loads fine. what's up? New install of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS from disk from Linux User magazine.  Standard boot hangs. Safe boot displays option to retry standard boot and when selected loads fine. Have updated OS. Any suggestions to get standard boot to work? Ubuntu is on disk along with Windows XP. Thanks....\n\nA: First does windows boot properly?\nIf it does then maybe the Grub boot loader just made a mistake somewhere. \nWith what little information you suppled thats the only thing I can think of.\nYou can try this, as sometimes it repairs a Grub error.\nWhile Ubuntu is running open the terminal, Type sudo update-initramfs -u\nEnter your password when ask for it (don't worry that you do not see any \"*'s \" just type it)\nLet it finish then type sudo update-grub\nEnter your password if ask for it\nlet it finish then close terminal and reboot.\n", "Q: How to hide whitespace indicators in Vim Vim was showing some whitespace with commas and periods on a red background which I didn't want. After some googling I was able to get rid of the commas and periods by removing list and listchar lines from .vimrc, I was also hoping this would remove the red backgrounds it was putting in these places, but all it did was change that to white (see image).\n\nIs it possible to completely remove the whitespace background indicators in Vim? My .vimrc settings can be seen here and the plugins I'm using are listed here\n\nA: Thanks to Lasall's suggestion to check my plugins the behavior turned out to be caused by a plugin named vim-indent-guides - removing that resolved the issue. \n\nA: This will do the trick:%s/^ +// :)\n", "Q: Errors when installing Open Office I followed the first set of instructions on this page to install Open Office: \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install OpenOffice instead of LibreOffice?\nHowever, the last step which says to change the CHMOD of a folder, I got an error saying that the directory does not exist.\nOpen Office now appears in my Ubuntu start menu, but clicking on it does nothing. I tried a reboot.\nBelow is what I could copy from my terminal.\nI am running the latest Ubuntu. I have not uninstalled Libreoffice as suggested somewhere. The reason is that in the Ubuntu software centre, Libre office appears to be made up of several components and I don't know which ones to remove (or all maybe?). They are Libreoffice Draw, Math, Writer, Calc.\nAfter this operation, 480 MB of additional disk space will be used.\nDo you want to continue [Y/n]? y\nGet:1 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/

But the two packages definitely conflict.\n\nA: You don't need Open Office. The differences between LibreOffice and Open Office are minimal to say the least and given that the dynamic of the community is now with LibreOffice which comes nicely pre-installed in Ubuntu, I wouldn't waste your time with OpenOffice.\nOracle decided after acquiring Sun that it was not interested in maintaining it and offloaded it to the Apache Foundation. Meanwhile many of the developers started LibreOffice as a fork of OpenOffice. Some developers do nevertheless continue to work on OpenOffice and I believe there was a new release not so long ago but as I said the differences between the two are negligible and the dynamic is clearly with LibreOffice these days.\nRegarding uninstalling LibreOffice, I think you'll need to uninstall the packages separately since the meta-package is not installed by default.\nThen I'd remove any OpenOffice packages - use synaptic - and start again using the method you were given.\nHowever, once again I cannot recommend to go to all that fuss for a near identical suite of apps to what you have comfortably installed already.\n\nA: You need to remove LibreOffice to successfully use OpenOffice, and vice versa.\nOne is a fork (variation) of the other, and they don't play well together.\n\nSee answer for: OpenOffice doesn't work\n", "Q: Satellite L750 Screen resolution problem I am new in Ubuntu, I just replaced my windows 7 with it, but after installation I am stuck with a resolution of 1024x768 and I have tried most of the fixes I find here and this is my 3rd time reformatting my laptop due to fail attempts on getting my desired resolution which is 1368x768.\nCan anyone help me?\nMy Graphics card is Geforce GMT 525\n\nA: The Built in Linux drivers for Geforce video cards while good are not perfect,\nand that could be part of the problem.\nHowever you \"might\" have an option to install the drivers from Nvidia. \nHere is how you do it:\nFirst I would do a full update for the system from the update manager, and reboot to enable any new kernel stuff that would be put on the system (this really might be all thats needed). \nNext open the \"Additional Drivers\" application and let it look for any drivers that might work.

It tells me to rebuild the kernel modules by running /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup. When I do in terminal the system cannot find the linux-headers-3.2.0-32-generic.  I checked /usr/src and the only headers there are for versions 3.5.0-17 and 3.5.0-18.\nCan anyone please tell me how to recreate the headers that the system is looking for?\n\nA: Well, due to kernel version I guess you have Ubuntu 12.10 (12.11 is not a version of Ubuntu, please edit your question and correct it). \nThen you said that virtualbox not work due to missing headers of 3.2.0-32 kernel. This kernel is from 12.04 Ubuntu version . Ubuntu 12.10 uses 3.5.0-17 (3.5 series). \nSo the only thing I can guess is that you've upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10 and the old kernel remained to your system. \nThe easy solution here is to remove the old kernel 3.2.0-32. \nSee here on how to remove the old kernel\nThen run again sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup and should be fine.\n\nA: You have to install linux headers, remove virtualbox-dkms and install virtualbox-dkms. The step by step instructions are given in the following link,\nhttp://xchamitha.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/fixing-virtualbox-on-ubuntu-1210.html\n\nA: I followed the advice of @NikTh but that made my system unable to boot.  It appears that the Grub boot loader did not completely upgrade when I upgraded Ubuntu to Version 12.10.  The package was extracted but not installed.  I was able to determine this fact after making a command line boot to kernel 3.5.0-18.  I then rebooted from my original installation CD of version 9.04 and from the menu chose \"Recover a broken system\".  Then at the rescue-mode chooser I selected \"Reinstall GRUB boot loader\".  This solved my problem by correcting the errors in the boot loader and therefore providing pointers to the current kernel for vbox to function again.\n", "Q: How to change external monitor brightness via DDC/IC?

After finding that I hadn't used Windows since, I deleted my Windows partition with GParted.  Now, I want to use this freed disk space with Ubuntu.  How can I merge this disk space with the Ubuntu partition?\n\nA: While on live-cd run GParted. Then right click on partition You want to resize and set right amount of space.\n\nA: You should be able to use the Live CD and gparted pre-installed to do this.\nYou 1st need to delete the formatted (empty) partition and then use gparted to resize the existing Linux partition and grow it (ext4 is fine).\nTo get a USB live, the easiest thing would be using unetbootin http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ to create a Live USB from ISO or Internet.\nBTW: I would avoid resizing existing Linux partitions, unless you are using LVM or Btrfs. In this case, I would rather use the empty partition as /home, copy the data from old home to new and modify /etc/fstab, after that you can delete the old home on the Linux partition to free up disk space.\nTo copy data from old home to new (if you use a Live USB, mount old / as /mnt/root and new /home as /mnt/new_home)\nrsync -axHAX --progress /mnt/root/home/user /mnt/new_home\n\n\nA: Start up an Ubuntu LiveCD or USB.  Then, use GParted to \"resize\" the partition you created for Ubuntu until it fills the whole disk.  This may take a long time, depending on the size of your disk.\nThis can only be done from live media - you will have to make another LiveUSB.  To do this, Ubuntu provides a built-in tool called \"Startup Disk Creator\", but you can also use a tool such as UNetBootin, PenDriveLinux, etc.\nGood luck with Ubuntu!\n", "Q: apt-get no longer works after manually deleting folders of a previously installed application I have been struggling all weekend, to upgrade an existing postgresql database from version 8.4 to 9.1.

So confused even that we need to make it even more confused.\nWhen installing/removing packages, certain scripts can be run, these are post-install, pre-install etc. scripts and live in /var/lib/dpkg/info. To make removal work even when these scripts fail because you messed up your system, you can add a line that says exit 0 right after the first line in each of these scripts for the affected packages. Don't edit other scripts.\nThe removal with apt-get remove --purge will then work as far as apt is concerned, but this will leave some mess behind. To remove that mess, you should reinstall the packages you removed using the neutered postrm/prerm scripts and remove them properly this time.\n\nA: You better start by reinstalling 8.4:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall postgresql-8.4\n\nThen you can remove it with \nsudo apt-get remove --purge postgresql-8.4\n\nIf the reinstall fails, show us the error.\n\nA: To remove postgresql and start from scratch, this worked for me:\nList all the installed postgresql packages.\ndpkg -l | grep post  \n\nThen apt-get purge all of the postgresql packages returned from above command:\nExample:\napt-get purge postgresql postgresql-client postgresql-client-common postgresql-common postgresql-contrib postgresql-9.6 postgresql-client-9.6 postgresql-contrib-9.6  \n\n", "Q: How to get a Toshiba L505 to boot USB or CD OK, have a Toshiba L505 (not sure of the extended model number) that got a virus on Windows and will no longer will boot into that, so I'm trying to revive it with Ubuntu. Problem is, when I tell it to boot into a USB image of 12.04 32- or 64-bit, 13.04 64-bit, or elementary Luna 32-bit, it gives me some screen with a copyright from 2000 for Intel, invariably spits out a \"media not recognized\" type of error and then says PXE-ROM exiting. \nWell, that's annoying. \nSo I went in with a CD (12.04 x86_64 having tried 32-bit in the past as well). Boot menu, select, starts running. Seeing the loading screen for Ubuntu, going well... until it's not. Again, invariably, it fails. The CD drive will cease spinning at around the same time each time and then the laptop will stop doing everything altogether (at least, everything spins down and it goes quiet). As far as I can tell, it's not to do with what function is being loaded from the CD at the time (because that bit is variable).\nI'd love to be able to boot from USB (since it will be all but required going forward), but getting the CD to work would be wondrous too.\nAnyone have any ideas of where I can go from here to try to fix this? My friends and I have turned up nothing.\n\nA: Could be a hardware problem, but first eliminate the obvious:\n1) Did you md5sum check the downloaded iso?\n  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM\n  Check the number against the listing in the link for your release listed at\n  http://releases.ubuntu.com under the MD5SUMS link.\n2) If using a CD/DVD, did you burn the disc as slowly as possible?\n  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto\n3) Did you select the media check before trying to install?\n https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/CDIntegrityCheck\n4) Did you ever do a \"memory check\" (another live-media menu choice) on your PC?\nDoing the above can save you a lot of time struggling with a bad install media.\n\nunetbootin is what I use to create live media USBs from Windows (or when Ubuntu's startup disk creator does not work for a later ISO).  Does your BIOS boot setting have the USB device before the hard disk? At boot time, can you type a function key to select the boot device -- and explicitly select the USB?\n  When trying the CD, look at the options from the function keys, and select \"nomodeset\" to avoid some video problems. \n\nA: Sounds like a BIOS / hardware issue, not necessarily a Media Problem. Remove the laptop battery and access the memory compartment. While this may or may not work, Remove the SODIMM from the motherboard. You should be able to access the CMOS battery*, remove that also. Leave it out for about 60 seconds (battery) then replace it. \nNow, look very carefully within that compartment, you should see a part of the printed circuit board with the letters \"pin1-pin2\" probably looks like a soldered stub wire of sort. (a small screwdriver or unbent paper-clip works here) Jumper the terminals between pin1 and pin2, hold for about 5-10 seconds.

If you install a 32-bit OS, you are limited to 4GB total memory, any more will be ignored, because the OS cannot address the memory.\nIf you install 64-bit OS, each process remains limited to 4GB, but the OS can handle as many as your installed memory will allow. \nSo don't worry, you have installed the correct OS bit.\n", "Q: How do I Dual Boot Windows 8 UEFI and Ubuntu 12.10? I have got a new Samsung Series 7 laptop with Windows 8 where I tried to install Ubuntu. It is a 64-Bit system which uses UEFI and has \"Secure Boot\" switched on in the BIOS by default. After I switched if off (and set it to \"UEFI and CSM OS\") I was able to install Ubuntu (Ubuntu 11.10, which recognized Windows as Windows Vista, although it is Windows 8), by booting from CD with Settings/Change PC Settings/General/Advanced Startup in Windows 8. \nBut after the installation and the restart of the machine somehow ignored Ubuntu and booted only Windows 8. Then I tried to reinstall Ubuntu 12.10. It still only boots Windows 8. Then I tried Boot Repair, which was not really helpful. Any ideas how I can create a dual boot system with Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10 ? Here is the link that Boot Repair generated: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1368624/  Is it necessary to create an extra EFI partition with GParted?\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot on your Ubuntu-Secure disk\n\n*Choose \"Try Ubuntu\"\n\n*Connect internet\n\n*Open a terminal and type the following command (this will update Boot-Repair):\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair boot-sav\n\n\n*Run Boot-Repair, click Recommended Repair.

I could not achieve boot in any configuration with it on.\n•\n•UEFI boot scheme (not Legacy BIOS). I tried Legacy mode, and can boot from disk, but not from an installation on the hard drive.

Select prefered option and procede. 4) I'm in.\nIf anyone following this thread comes up with a way for the Windows UEFI boot loader to recognize the /Boot partition automatically, please share. The above method is not that much of a pain, but an automatic boot whre windows recognizes Ubuntu as a boot option would be a somewhat more elegant affair. Also, I would much rather prefer to ahve Windows handle the primary boot sequence, and not grub, as a personal preference, so I can live with the above until other options are available.\n...after I wrote this I see Rod Smith's page above. I am at work for a while but when I get a chance I will weed through that and see if I can try some things to achieve Windows automatic recognition.  Thank you Rod Smith.\nGregg\n\nA: If the boot repair tool that LovinBuntu describes doesn't work, be aware that you seem to have installed at least one (probably both) of your Ubuntus in BIOS/legacy mode, not in EFI mode. The solution is to install a Linux-aware boot loader in EFI mode. See this Web page of mine for more information on this topic. One relatively quick and easy solution is to install rEFInd from Windows. The last couple versions can boot BIOS/legacy OSes on most UEFI implementations, so once you've installed rEFInd, you should get an option to boot that BIOS/legacy version of GRUB you've got installed. With a little more work, you should also be able to boot Linux directly in EFI mode, which can be a little bit cleaner on your system.\n", "Q: MailServer that doesn't store any data outside database?

I am using two displays, one connected with DVI, one with HDMI. I set the desktop to be expanded to both screens and disabled the under scan for the HDMI screen, which is always for some reason enabled on HDMI screens.\nNow the issue. Everything was fine until I restarted my computer. After reboot, the screen connected with HDMI cable had the black borders again, meaning that the under scan is again enabled. I checked the ATI CCC, and under scan was disabled. However, moving the slider to enable under scan and then back to zero fixed the issue -- temporarily. The same issue is repeated every time I restart my computer. The settings remains the same, but the computer seems to ignore it.\nAny ideas how I could solve the issue?\n\nA: My dear friend Google helped me out with this.

I've used Thunderbird for years.\nI keep a huge number of emails. I move them to folders to organize or archive them, but I don't delete anything so I have hundreds of thousands of messages.\nI like the way TB is conceived, and the way it works as long as the volume of data is small. But it just doesn't scale.\nIt has a lot of ridiculous design flaws such that, for example, any time consuming operation blocks the whole UI completely (and you don't even know for how long) as if everything was implemented in a single monolythic all-tasks-are-blocking way. I'm tired of it.\nSo what is the alternative that you would recommend as an email client program with all the usual basic features one expects from any email client program? Important: I mainly use POP3, much much more than IMAP, and my main account is on gmail.\nThis question is not intended to be a rant against TB (I admit it is, as a side effect); I have highlighted its weaknesses BECAUSE the answer I'm looking for is a recomendation for a program that doesn't suffer from these issues.\n\nA: If you would consider a terminal based option, and usually work with plain-text email mutt is awesome. It is lightweigth, and can handle anything thunderbird can, except for photos. \nRather than that, I'd recommend Gmail's web interface, as I find it quite nice, and usually use it for my mail. You can use it as a desktop email client, which receives mail from many different accounts from any provider, via either pop and imap (not sure about imap). It has decent filtering and organising capabilities.\nIf you are interested in desktop clients only, I'd extend @alfC's answer by adding Claws Mail. I've used it for a little while and didn't learn much about it, but it is nice too, I wan't to add it as it is a widely-used open-source option.\n\nA: Of course one alternative is Evolution email http://projects.gnome.org/evolution/, available in Ubuntu Software Center. But it is also bad or worst in your complaints about Thunderbird.\nA client that I found very responsive and well designed is Geary http://yorba.org/geary/, which is also available in the Software Center. It integrates perfectly with Gmail (better than TB and Evolution, regarding the Labels and Archive features), and supports POP3 and imap. Best of all, it seems to be actively developed which indicates to me that it will become better and better with time.\nOne important limitation, at the moment is that it supports a single account, it seems.\nUPDATE June/2013: Geary 0.3.1 supports multiple accounts\n\nA: Claw mail. its a GUI. a very light and featured mail client .\nhttps://launchpad.net/~claws-mail/+archive/ppa\n\nA: Opera mail is the best solution...

In the terminal type: sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/show-desktop.desktop\n\n*Add the info. here you have an example:\n\n(Feel fre to change any data in the file)\n\n*Go to the dash and serch for \"Show Desktop\"\n\n\n*Drag and drop the icon into the Launcher\nThe credit for the script if for Webupd8 , there is this \"wmctrl\" script for \"docky\", you can use it for unity launcher.\nCheers.\n", "Q: Fuzzy static noise on screen My Compaq 8710p laptop with a 256MB NVIDIA Quadro 320m was working fine. I switched to the proprietary driver and tried World of Warcraft under WINE until I got unbearable amounts of static. I restarted the computer and the static persisted. I have now moved back to the open source driver and there is now light static that is very annoying.\nPicture of the static: \n\n\nA: If you get this problem, make sure you're on the open source NVIDIA driver through \"Software Sources\" and restart your computer.

Look for it under: Display Device (DFP-0 in my case) -> Controls -> Dithering Controls. It is set to Auto (Mode: Temporal) by default.\nI played setting the dithering mode, to both Static and Dynamic, and the noise wasn't there anymore.

The RT3572 chipset is supported (sort of...*) by the RT2800 driver, which also supports many other flavors of ralink chipsets.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that this driver is notoriously buggy. Follow the build and install instructions explicitly. Which version of the driver you should use is highly dependent on which kernel version you are using, among other things. The latest version of the driver software is not necessarily the one that will work on your system. Some web searching for the appropriate driver version to work with your kernel may be required.\n\n", "Q: Is there any way to take my old internet connections with me when doing a new install? I have /home on a seperate partition, so every time when  I do a new install of Ubuntu, I take my program settings with me. This works fine for most programs, but I still have to retype my Wi-Fi passwords after each install.\nInstead, I'd like to take my old passwords with me as well. How can I get that done?\n\nA: I believe you can save the contents of /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections and then put them back into place after your install.  You should have one file per connection and it will have your password in plaintext, so be careful with what you do with the files.\nI have /home on a separate partition too, but I always back-up /etc too as there are things in there I don't want to redo, like my autofs setup.\n", "Q: Should I use Logical Volume Management and Encrypt the installation on SSD?

What can I do? \nThanks!\n\nA: If you can have your laptop connected to internet by a cable, you can try to use an other computer or smartphone to send a \"magic packet\" to it, and wake it up.\nLook for \"wake on lan\" (WOL).\n\nA: 1.Basic alarm clock function\nEntering suspend mode\nfor this solution, you need to enter suspend mode by running the script below. It makes the computer go into suspend mode and wakes you up at a (clock-) time, defined by you (in the script). playing your song.\nOf course you can simply run the script manually to use it, but it is more convenient to make it available via a key combination, set in System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts.\nSet up\n\n\n*\n\n*Paste the script below in an empty file, set the wake up (clock) time (in 1-24 hours, 1-60 minutes), set the path to your wake up song, and save it as wakeup.py. \n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport datetime\nimport subprocess\n\n###############################################\n# set wakeuptime and location of the mp3:\nhour = 7\nminutes = 15\ncommand = \"rhythmbox /path/to/wakeupsong.mp3\"\n###############################################\n\ncurrtime = str(datetime.datetime.now().time()).split(\":\")[:2]\nminutes_set = hour*60 + minutes\nminutes_curr = int(currtime[0])*60 + int(currtime[1])\nif minutes_curr < minutes_set:\n    minutes_togo = minutes_set - minutes_curr\nelse:\n    minutes_togo = minutes_set + 1440-minutes_curr\ninterval = minutes_togo*60\n\nrun = \"rtcwake -m disk -s \"+str(interval)+\" && \"+\"sleep 20 &&\"+command\nsubprocess.call(['/bin/bash', '-c', run])\n\n\n*make the script executable\n\n*Set a key combination to run the script; open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts, add the command\nsudo /path/to/wakeup.py (sudo = assuming you do the next step below)\n\nand choose a key combination\n\n*The script needs administrator's privileges. To run it without having to enter the password, open the sudoers file:\nsudo visudo\n\nadd the line to the very bottom of the file:\n[your_username] ALL=NOPASSWD: [/path/to/wakeup.py]\n\nNote that the sudoers file is an essential file; errors in the file possibly lead to serious problems, so be careful!\nN.B.\n\n\n*\n\n*After wake up, the computer is idle for 20 seconds before the alarm starts.\n\n*If you do not want to edit the sudoers file, you need to install\ngksu: sudo apt-get install gksu. In that case, the command to run\nthe script is gksu /path/to/wakeup.py, and you will be prompted for\nyour password each time you run it.\n\n\nNow you can enter suspend mode with your key combination and you'll get woken by your wake up song.\n2.Extended version including stop function when (any) key or mouse is hit\nThe differences between this one and the \"basic\" version is that in this one the alarm stops when any keystroke or mouse movement is detected (more convenient than stopping Rhythmbox on the computer when you just woke up), and that the alarm automatically exits after a defined period of time.\nThe setup is pretty much the same as the basic version, but xprintidle needs to be installed, to detect keystroke- or mouse movement events:\nsudo apt-get install xprintidle\n\nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport datetime\nfrom threading import Thread\n\n#-------------------------- edit settings below -------------------------------\nmax_wakeupduration = 1              # max time the song will play (minutes)\nwakeup_hour = 7                     # wake up hour (0-24)\nwakeup_minute = 15                  # wake up minute\nwakeup_song = \"/path/to/song.mp3\"   # path to wake up song\n#------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ndef stop_wakeup():\n    time1 = int(time.time()); time2 = time1\n    last_idle = 0\n    playtime = max_wakeupduration*60\n    while time2 - time1 < playtime:\n        get_idle = subprocess.Popen([\"xprintidle\"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n        curr_idle = int(get_idle.communicate()[0].decode(\"utf-8\"))\n        if curr_idle < last_idle:\n            break\n        else:\n            last_idle = curr_idle\n            time.sleep(1)\n            time2 = int(time.time())\n    subprocess.Popen([\"pkill\", \"rhythmbox\"])\n\ndef calculate_time():\n    currtime = str(datetime.datetime.now().time()).split(\":\")[:2]\n    minutes_set = wakeup_hour*60 + wakeup_minute\n    minutes_curr = int(currtime[0])*60 + int(currtime[1])\n    if minutes_curr < minutes_set:\n        minutes_togo = minutes_set - minutes_curr\n    else:\n        minutes_togo = minutes_set + 1440-minutes_curr\n    return minutes_togo*60\n\ndef go_asleep():\n    sleeptime = calculate_time()   \n    run = \"rtcwake -m disk -s \"+str(sleeptime)+\" && \"+\"sleep 20\"\n    subprocess.call(['/bin/bash', '-c', run])\n    combined_actions()\n\ndef play_song():\n    command = \"rhythmbox \"+wakeup_song\n    subprocess.Popen(['/bin/bash', '-c', command])\n\ndef combined_actions():\n    Thread(target = play_song).start()\n    Thread(target = stop_wakeup).start()\n\ngo_asleep()\n\nExplanation\nrtcwake\nBoth scripts are written around the rtcwake command, as explained here. The command can be used to put the computer into suspend and wake up after a defined amount of time (and optionally run a command after wake up). The -m disk option is used, since OP mentioned his computer does not support \"suspend to RAM\" feature in BIOS. See also man rtcwake. \nThe stop function\nThe stop function works by a function that measures idle time every second while the song is playing, and remembers the last idle time. IF the last idle time exceeds the current one, it means a keystroke or mouse event has taken place, and Rhythmbox is killed. \n\nA: I had troubles running Jacob's python script, so I rewrote it in bash. Just download it, make it executable and edit variables accordingly.\nA couple of things: alarm time is set via date -d. Some examples from man date: \n\n\n*\n\n*\"Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800\"\n\n*\"2004-02-29  16:21:42\"  \n\n*\"next Thursday\"\n\n\nAfter wake up I use vlc -L to play some music in a loop. If your path is a folder, it will try to play files in it. That's what I do.\n\nA: Not sure if this is what you're looking for,\nbut I just found a simple working 'alarm' that automatically wakes up from suspend mode:\nsudo rtcwake -m freeze --date 05:30:00 ; cvlc /path/to/music.mp3\n\nThe -m freeze option idles processors and freezes all running processes. While -m mem will suspend to RAM and put the system into low-power state to conserve more power, according to rtcwake(8).\nExplanation\nThis code will first run the rtcwake, suspend the computer until 5.30 a.m., leaving the console open while the computer sleeps, and then play the music using cvlc (Console VLC). I'm not sure why the sudo privilege must be included. I guess that's just the nature of rtcwake. The semicolon ; is used so that the code on the left of the semicolon is run first, and then the second code (to the right of the semicolon) is run after the first code is completed. This is similar to running two commands separately:\n[user@localhost ~] sudo rtcwake -m mem --date 05:30:00\n[user@localhost ~] cvlc /path/to/music.mp3\n\nBut since we can't wait until the computer wakes again and play the music by ourselves, we interject these two commands with a semicolon ;.\nRequired Packages\nTo use the VLC functionality, you can install it using the command below:\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nThe cvlc command will only play the music in the background without actually opening the VLC windows interface. To turn off the 'alarm', you can close the console or press Ctrl+C.\n", "Q: authentication version 12.10 I'm trying to sign in, log on, but I continually get a box saying password. Not recognized.

When I start GParted, it sees the new space as well. However, in GParted it only shows the ext4 partition and the swap, but no extended partition. It will not allow me to add the unallocated space to the primary ext4 (...and relocate the swap to the end).  \nIt there a way around this? Can the new drive be expanded in the primary ext4 partition?\n\nA: If you are using LVM, you can create PV and then add the spaces to existing VG and the root LV. If Btrfs, just add the device to the volume btrfs device add /dev/sdd /btrfs \nBut if you are using traditional partitions, it's more complicated.\nYou can try this: delete the swap partition and try to resize the primary partition (/), reserve some space for swap if you want to create a swap partition (I would use swap file instead).\nAnother workaround would be using the new virtual HDD as /var or /home (which ever uses most disk space), use rsync -axHAX --progress src dest to copy data over and edit /etc/fstab to complete.\nBTW: Capacity Planning is important before your go;-)\n", "Q: After a Windows 8 update I don't get my boot menu anymore I did a software update on my 64-bit Windows 8 and after restarting my computer, I no longer get my boot menu with Ubuntu 12.10, but instead get a black screen that says:\nerror: unknown filesystem.\ngrub rescue>\nThis is after running boot-repair, which gave me this link: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1369161\nI really have no idea what to do.

Unfortunately for me, that's exactly what I want to do.\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: OpenVZ is quite out-dated. Linux Container - LXC is the way to go if you just want to use isolated containers (OS Level virtualization), the container is in between chroot and a VM.\nLXC does not require patches to the kernel, LXC is in the mainline, libvirt support...

Pause the VM from Virtual Box and then make a copy of complete folder where you have stored your VM. You can find this path after right clicking on the VM and then going into settings and HHD location.\nNow restore the VM State (Just Start it). Then, click on restart once it shut's down. Pause the VM again and them remove the Installation media / ISO what so ever it is. then restore / start the VM your VM will boot properly.

You can check which Logical Volumes have PEs allocated in the PVs that you still have by issuing this command:\npvdisplay -m\n\nWhich outputs something like this (showing one PV here only):\n--- Physical volume ---\n  PV Name               /dev/sda3\n  VG Name               htpcvg\n  PV Size               929.27 GiB / not usable 18.71 MiB\n  Allocatable           yes \n  PE Size               32.00 MiB\n  Total PE              29736\n  Free PE               1190\n  Allocated PE          28546\n  PV UUID               7SfjbY-3dy4-UDeB-iSEL-3R9Y-vvnv-O7m9jr\n\n  --- Physical Segments ---\n  Physical extent 0 to 28545:\n    Logical volume      /dev/htpcvg/home\n    Logical extents     29430 to 57975\n  Physical extent 28546 to 29735:\n    FREE\n\nWith this info you can know how much of your LVs is stored in that PV.\nThen, if that information shows that you have some extents of your LVs' available, you can activate the VG that contains them with this other command (edit VolGroupName):\n[EDIT: Please read the manpage]\nvgchange -a y --partial VolGroupName\n\nThat should make your LVs \"available\", but faulty anyway (you won't be able to read missing PEs, obviously). To be safe, you could also make your defunct LVs read-only with lvchange -p r --partial /path/to/logical/volume\nNow, given that you probably won't be able to mount the filesystems that reside in your partial LVs, you should copy what's left of them with ddrescue:\nddrescue -n /dev/mapper/yourVG-yourLV /file/for/the/dump ddrescue.log\n\nAnd then do some forensic analysis on that dump. Here you have many options. Photorec is just one.\n\nA: 1 thing for the future generations.\nPartial won't load LVs which were partial.\nAlso it will replace your config and you will still get critical errors for your fs.\nTo load the broken LVs you must first replace the broken/failed/disabled drive or part, with for example nfs mounted loop image.\nDump the config of VG, compare it with backed up configurations and add the working spans except for the broken one, check the segments size to correlate with the quantity of the spans.\nRemember the image should be larger than the previous drive.\nYou can then pvcreate it and assign the extents to the broken LV.\nAfter this do the e2fsck (because superblock will be broken due to broken span) on the broken LV fs. then resize it to new smaller size using resize2fs and you can safely remove the extension loop, first by lvreducing the size of lv to fs (nowadays you can do it in one command without resize2fs), then by vgreduce to kick out the loop from your LV.\nAfter this you can safely mount the healed LV fs and backup data or even reboot the system to run it.\nDon't use /dev/ioerror (as suggested somewhere online) though if your LV is broken with superblock corrupted as well as it won't allow to fix errors beyond the LV boundary and ultimately fail the fsck all the time.\nOnly supplement the loop device or even a real device if you want to.\n", "Q: zoneminder - fewer events, longer duration?

The files will be extracted to 2010_1216_RT5390_LinuxSTA_V2.4.0.4_WiFiBTCombo_DPO folder.\n\n*Download all the patches except the x64_86 patch, assuming you have a 32-bit system, from opensuse website.\n\n*Copy the patches to the folder – 2010_1216_RT5390_LinuxSTA_V2.4.0.4_WiFiBTCombo_DPO\n    Goto the folder.\n\n*Make the following change in  /os/linux/config.mk file – HAS_ANTENNA_DIVERSITY_SUPPORT=y (originally was n)\nsudo su\ncp RT2860STA.dat RT5390STA.dat\nmkdir -p /etc/Wireless/RT5390STA\ncp RT5390STA.dat /etc/Wireless/RT5390STA\nmake clean\nmake   <- i have problems\nmake install\nmodprobe rt5390sta\nexit\nBut at one stage when I run \"make\", I have a compiler error:\n/home/hp650/rt/os/linux/../../common/cmm_asic.c: In function\n‘AsicGetAutoAgcOffsetForTemperatureSensor’:\n/home/hp650/rt/os/linux/../../common/cmm_asic.c:1233:28: warning:\nassignment discards ‘const’ qualifier from pointer target type\n[enabled by default]\n/home/hp650/rt/os/linux/../../common/cmm_asic.c:1246:28: warning:\nassignment discards ‘const’ qualifier from pointer target type\n[enabled by default]\n  CC [M]  /home/hp650/rt/os/linux/../../common/cmm_cmd.o\n  CC [M]  /home/hp650/rt/os/linux/../../chips/rtmp_chip.o\n/home/hp650/rt/os/linux/../../chips/rtmp_chip.c: In function\n‘HWAntennaDiversityEnable’:\n/home/hp650/rt/os/linux/../../chips/rtmp_chip.c:2010:2: error: ‘regs’\nundeclared (first use in this function)\n/home/hp650/rt/os/linux/../../chips/rtmp_chip.c:2010:2: note: each\nundeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it\nappears in\nmake[2]: *** [/home/hp650/rt/os/linux/../../chips/rtmp_chip.o] Error 1\nmake[1]: *** [_module_/home/hp650/rt/os/linux] Error 2\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-29-generic-pae'\nmake: *** [LINUX] Error 2\n\nSomeone can help me in this matter?\n\nA: I suspect you'll have better luck with a newer version of RT5390: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/58267392/2011_1007_RT5390_RT5392_Linux_STA_V2.5.0.3_DPO.zip\n\nA: I own an HP650 which came with pre-installed SUSE Linux Enterprise Novell.\nThe wireless card on this laptop is the Ralink 539a. The driver/module for this wlan card loaded by the kernel is the rt2800pci. The problem of course is that by default they do not work or if they work its unstable and practically unusable. \nAfter reading many threads and following a lot of different lines to build the \n2011_1007_RT5390_RT5392_Linux_STA_V2.5.0.3_DPO the result was never successful failing either at the build with make returning an error for Antenna being changed to y for yes\nor the driver not starting the wlan0 interface if the Antenna switch remains n for off.\nLater I found a bug report and exchange specifically for the Ralink 539a where the solution to the problem was finally found:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download latest Compat-Wireless drivers from linuxwireless.org\n\n*Unpack to a directorv\n\n*cd to directory\n\n*sudo make\n\n*sudo make install\n\n*reboot your computer\n\n*make sure the wireless card light/led is on by using the wireless on/off button....\n\n\nThat did it for me.\nA note I also read is that any time the kernel or drivers are updated the old rt2800pci driver/module gets unpacked and thus the wireless gets back to not working. So the same procedure of make and make install to overwrite with the compat.wireless drivers that work is to be done.\n\nA: If anyone has this same problem for later Ubuntu versions and kernel version 3.8 and above, I made a simple fix for it a while ago. I tested it on Ubuntu 14.04:\nThis package contains driver, patch and full instructions for both installation and recompiling the driver after each kernel upgrade.\nhttps://github.com/agerwick/RT28XX-RT539X-Linux-driver\n", "Q: How do I create another user? I am new to Ubuntu.\nOn login only my single user with guest is displayed. Is it possible to show multiple user names including admin user?\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"greeter-show-manual-login=true\" >> /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf'\n\nCan you explain the above code usage?\n\n\nA: If you go to System Settings - or type \"user\" in the dash - you should see an icon there for user settings. \n\nIf you are the administrator, which you most likely are unless you're using Ubuntu on a network, say at work, your own login is enough. Click on that icon to open the follwoing window:\n\nClick on the Unlock symbol in the top right corner to enter your credentials (administrator rights required):\n\nThen click on the + symbol on the bottom left side to enter a new user as this:\n\nChoose the account type \"Standard\" or \"Administrator\".\nThe account will be disabled until a password was given. To do so click on \"Account disabled\" next to password:\n\nThen enter a password for the new account:\n\nLog out and you will have the choice now to log in as that user.\nNormally you will be the admin user and since Ubuntu doesn't give you root but rather allows you to run with root permissions via sudo, it isn't meaningful to have root as a user to log in.\nYou can create a password for root. Not sure if that's worthwhile, as Ubuntu specifically avoids that path.\n", "Q: How do I get kubuntu to open RTF files in Libre office Using Kubuntu 12.04.01 on a dual-boot computer, I have entered System Settings >File Association to open rtf and richtext files with LibreOffice Writer set as preference over Kate and GNUEmacs. I have several files with .rtf suffix originally created by Windows, although modified and/or renamed by Kubuntu. In spite of my having changed the file association as above, Kubuntu insists on trying to open them from Dolphin with Kate which can't read them properly.\n\"Open With\" is an easy workaround, but I believe Kubuntu should do better. Is it a minor bug,or have I missed something? If a bug is it in Kubuntu, LibreOffice, or Kate?\n\nA: At here\nTested with the sample file: http://thewalter.net/stef/software/rtfx/sample.rtf\nAt here the LO is the default, and working, when opening the rtf format.\nThe KDE file manager (Dolphin) > Right clik the file > Properties > Click the wrench icon (Edit file type) > Application Preference Order (the first is the LibreOffice Writer).\n\nSomething to check\nMake a new user, start as a new user.\nDoes the new user have the same problem ?\nIf with the \"new user\" file association settings are working then it is possible that with the \"old user\" file association settings are corrupted (~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list). \n\nA: THanks user26687, it seems to be behaving itself now. I looked at my rtf file properties and all of them gave Kate at the top, in spite of LO in FileAssocs. Since all my rtf files had started life in Windows, I wrote some brand new text in LO and saved it as rtf. Dolphin then opened even that in Kate. I logged in as a different user, and it is clear that each user can have different File Associations, as other changes I had successfully made \"as myself\" had not migrated to the new account. The new user had no RTF, so I put one in with LO as the default, and it worked. Back to myself as user and - suddenly it works here.     The only explanation I can make is that I had originally wrongly set the file association, then somehow fixed the problem before posting this question, but my fix did not take effect until I logged out and back in! I am 30cm tall and my face is red; Sorry and thanks! \n", "Q: How to enable Apache Solr service on Rackspace Ubuntu Server? We have setup Apache Solr on Rackspace dedicated ubuntu server.

If you have enabled automatic connection your internet connection will started when you clicked Enable mobile broadband. Hope this works. Iam a complete newbie to Ubuntu .

Now the system is always booting in windows 7. I opted for dual boot at the time of installation. But system directly booting windows without asking anything.\nWhat is to be done next ? \n\nA: It sounds like your BIOS is set to boot from the Windows 7 partition/drive and not the partition that has GRUB / Ubuntu.\n\nA: you need to boot up the live ubuntu CD/DVD and rewrite the MBR.\nThis is a simple task, but is best be done with some fundamental understanding of partitions, partitioning and how booting works basically.\nJust steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot in live mode via ubuntu live CD\n\n*open up a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)\n\n*run following command: \nsudo grub-setup /dev/sdX\nwhere X is the letter for the Hard Disk to write the MBR to.

But i tried downloading Google Chrome and Flash Player because I couldnt watch any videos and now Firefox has become unresponsive.\nIt says\n\nFirefox is already running but it is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the exisitng firefox process or restart your system.\n\nI tried restarting but that hasn't worked.\nUbuntu also asked me if i wanted to do a update which I did, could this be a problem also.\nWhen I try to delete the files, it tells me the following:\n\nThe link ''lock'' is broken. move it to the rubbish bin.\nThis link cannot be used, because it's target '127.0.1.1;+1885'' doesn't exist\n\n\n*\n\n*Killing the process does not work either.\n\n\nA: Open the file manager and press Ctrl+H to see hidden files.

I mostly use terminal for installation of programs (as does mostly everybody). However, at times (particularly when I have low battery and no charger wire OR more importantly, when installer file is too big, installation is incomplete and I need to power down my system) I would like to pause the installation (while it is in downloading state) so that I won't loose already downloaded files.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: Ctrl+c cancels it but next time start from where you left\nCtrl+z stops process but then you can't do another process as it remains locked to the first process\nUsing one of the above methods is generally better than just closing the terminal, but if you just close the terminal while it's downloading packages, it should start the download right where it stopped next time you run sudo apt-get upgrade\nIf you want to restart the download after using Ctrl+z:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check paused tasks by typing jobs in the terminal\n\n*To resume a process, type fg\n\n*If you have multiple tasks, then type fg 1, fg 2, etc…\n\n\nMake sure, however, that you never stop it while it's installing the downloaded packages, since this will result in a lock on apt-get, which will require a computer restart or reconfiguration of apt, and you'll have to start at the beginning of the installation.\nSo make sure to only \"pause\" (close) the terminal when it's downloading, not installing.\nIf you would like to start another apt-get process - after pausing the first process, run sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock && sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock; it won't look like it did anything, but you should be able to start another apt-get process.\nTo kill a command that you've paused with Ctrl+z, enter kill -9 %x into the terminal, replacing x with the number that the paused process is (see jobs). The process will remain in the list, but it will say \"killed\" after it instead of \"stopped\", indicating it is no longer active.\n\nSources : [ubuntu] How to pause download operation in terminal\nAccidently pressed Ctrl-Z in a Linux terminal in Ubuntu Intrepid Ipex.

I need a simple http-server and client requests to share files between two Ubuntu-computers. How could I do it?\n\nA: Why use an http server and client when you can use Ubuntu One if it simply file sharing that you need? \nIn any case, if you really want such a system, you could try installing Apache with sudo apt-get install apache2.\nMore information here: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/httpd.html\n", "Q: Add folders to 'libraries' I am dual-booting windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10.

In windows, for example, in the documents library we can add a folder from other directories so we can view all those in one single place. So how can I view all those folders in windows partition under Ubuntu libraries?\n\nA: You should mount your Windows partition under Ubuntu in order to view your Windows libraries: http://www.hecticgeek.com/2012/10/make-ntfs-partitions-read-only-in-ubuntu/\nAdditionally, you could read how to harmonize your dual-boot setup for Windows and Ubuntu here: \nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/35807/how-to-harmonize-your-dual-boot-setup-for-windows-and-ubuntu/\n", "Q: Appmenu (Global menu) for Gnome Shell Is there any one of you that can develop a global menu extension for gnome-shell, based on indicator-appmenu? Is it so difficult?\n\nA: This isn't the place to ask for commissioned/freelance work.\nThat said, you might want to take a look at https://extensions.gnome.org/ to start for any extensions you might want, and the proper channels for asking for them.\nAs for your specific request, I doubt that it will be an easy endeavor (at least for any one individual), since it not only requires knowledge of Gnome and Gnome-Shell, but also of every application and how it handles the menu system (some standards may be found amount GTK, QT, and KDE applications, but you still have the outliers to deal with, as well), and that's assuming that Gnome Shell supports such an extension. Even Ubuntu can be hit or miss with some applications. Depending on your reasons for switching to Gnome Shell, you might be better off starting with Unity and customizing to make it look like Gnome Shell, as opposed to starting with Gnome Shell and making it work like Unity.\n", "Q: check support of Universal TUN/TAP Device on ubuntu 12.04 I am trying to setup Appgate Ip tunneling driver on my ubuntu 12.04 by following appgate instructions listed below:\n Installation, Linux\nMake sure the kernel has support for the Universal TUN/TAP device driver,\n  and then log in as root and create a new directory somewhere, and \n  copy the files\n ag_iptd\n add_route\n add_gw_route\n add_hosts_entry\n ag_iptd\n clean_hosts_file\n del_route\n del_gw_route\n del_hosts_entry\n interface_down\n interface_up\n remove_dns_server\n set_dns_server\n fix_localhost\n\ninto that directory.

By default the network-manager log will go to /var/log/syslog, so that will contain information about when your network connection is up or when it changes, say when you connect to a VPN. That log will have IP and DNS information about the new connection and whether it is using the tun/tap driver.\n", "Q: Cannot run Windows XP from GRUB (returns to GRUB) GRUB had an error, but by using Boot repair I fixed it.\nHere is the boot info script output.\nI have the system selection screen in violet, but I cannot run Windows XP.

Under CompizConfig I'm running the Desktop Cube and Wallpaper settings to have a cube with 4 different wallpapers.  When using CompizConfig Wallpaper, there are no desktop icons.  I can turn them back on via Ubuntu Tweak, but that reverts my wallpaper back to the default on all 4 viewports.  Is there a way to have the desktop icons show up while using CompizConfig Wallpaper, or do I just have to choose between having one or the other?\n\nA: Open tweak tool and click, \"Desktop\" and on the first line there should be the option, \"Have file manager manage the desktop\" and make sure that it is set to, \"on\" instead of, \"off\". If this doesn't work maybe you may have to manually set the icon for the programs on the desktop. This you can achieve by going to your desktop in file manager and right clicking and selecting properties. Then just click on the icon of the desktop icon and go from there to select a new icon.\n", "Q: Wacom Pressure in Photoshop CS5 Using Wine I'm taking a shot in the dark hoping someone here has figured this out, because they haven't figured it out at winehq, which I know is the more appropriate forum to ask.  But,no one knows (that I know of), so here goes:\nDo you know how to get the wacom pen pressure to work in Adobe Photoshop CS5 using wacom tablet?  It works fine in MyPaint, Gimp, Pencil etc.  So I know this is a wine issue with the wacom pressure settings.\nI can provide any information you feel is helpful in solving this, just ask.\n\nA: the answer isn't easy, you need to develop or pay someone to develop on your behalf a wine driver which can use pressure information from xinput devices and deliver them to windows programs in the way they expect.\nThis project might take a lot of time or a lot of money to get written. But I know that it has not yet been written and needs artists to step up to fix the problem.\n\nA: Interestingly enough, I am finding that running Utopic Unicorn with a cracked version of Wine which has been optimized for Ubuntu is working well and every now and then (if I leave pen pressure setting on) I find it registers the pen pressure and draws a thin line. I have no idea what is doing this. I installed it with POL and have it using Opengl only, alongside Wine version 1.7.2.\nI originally had a problem with the brush not working at all. If I knew a way to identify what is happening when Photoshop registers the pen pressure I'm sure a solution could be found.\n", "Q: zlib error webkit I downloaded the WebKit source code and I am building the source code on ubuntu 10.04\nAfter executing below command, i got errors related to glib-2.31.2.\n./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr\n\nI solved those errors and again issued above command.

(Note, this will delete all files on your harddisk, so make sure you've rescued any important data before you do this).\nAlternatively, you could try to upgrade automatically from 9.04 to 12.10 by following these steps: upgrade from 9.04 to 12\n", "Q: which are the different ways i can update software catalog? while facing problem(s) with software center 5.2.6 on ubuntu 12.04, i reinstalled the software center and executed following command on gnome terminal\n$ sudo dpkg --configure -a\nSetting up software-center (5.2.6) ...

Try the askubuntu tag filter to sort out whether your question wasn't already answered.\nAbout the SSD decision, it's basically whether you have the money and the care for such a speed up. Particularly I can't care less for a SSD drive, as long as I'm not developing SSD drivers nor running data servers.\n", "Q: Slow reboot - understanding fsck and tune2fs I'm having a problem with my web server: when it's been up for a long time, and then it goes down for some reason, it takes forever to boot.\nMy workaround to this was to create a cron to reboot the server from time to time (I've been insulted for this, be kind). The reboot was so fast that the server was able to respond to the requests before they timed out, so I was cool with it.\nBut now I've been told that what might be causing this is fsck being forced after X days, and also after Y mounts, so my fix won't help much.\nSo the question is what should I do with fsck? Force it to run more frequently, or disable it? Can it run at any time, or it must be during boot? An example of how to do it with tune2fs is also welcome.\n\nA: To answer the easiest question first:  Checking a filesystem \"at any time\" (i.e., when the system is running) is referred to as \"online\" checking, and in general, it isn't supported.  The reason is simple:  when a filesystem is mounted, the kernel is doing arbitrary things to the actual block device--which is fine, because it keeps track of what it's doing.  But when you throw fsck into the mix, it too messes with the raw block device and doesn't inform the kernel about what it's doing.  So they essentially step on each other's toes when making changes to the disk, and you end up with a corrupted filesystem.  Even if you just \"check\" in read-only mode, the results fsck returns will be meaningless, again because fsck has no idea what the kernel is doing.\nTo change the frequency the filesystem is checked when you mount it, you will use tune2fs, as you mentioned.  Suppose you'd like to fsck every 30 reboots.  Do\n# tune2fs -c 30 /dev/sdaX\n\n(Substitute the block device for your filesystem.)\nOr, if for some reason you'd like to disable mount-count-based checking entirely,\n# tune2fs -c 0 /dev/sdaX\n\nIf you'd rather check on a calendar, you can use -i.  For example, to check every week, do\n# tune2fs -i 1w /dev/sdaX\n\nYou can use d for days, w for weeks, and m for months.  Again, to disable calendar-based checking, give a value of 0 for the interval.  Please, please, please don't disable all checking.  You will, at some point, corrupt your filesystem.\nIn general, you can get away with slightly longer intervals if the filesystem is journaled, although it isn't a replacement.  For more info, read the man pages for e2fsck and tune2fs; they're where I got most of the info for this.  Hope this helps!\n\nA: Change you scheduled reboot to have one of the following included\ntouch /forcefsck; reboot\n\nor \nshutdown -rF now\n\nThe existence of the /forcefsck will tell the OS to scan the disks (I am pretty sure this is what the second command does anyway.\nUse cron to schedule this for a period when the server has the least load and disable the other scheduled scans (date / number of mounts) once you are confident it is running correctly.\n", "Q: How to synchronize a local folder with a remote? I want to upload a batch of files to my server periodically preserving the originals only in the server, that is: \n\n\n*\n\n*If I delete the local folder, files are not ereased from the server.\n\n*If local files are replaced, they are added to remote.\n\n*It should restore the transfer if the connection is lost during the process.\n\n*Bonus points if it works in Windows\n\n\nI thought that rsync and a cron job should do the trick but I happen to have no idea about how to use those (well, ok... I have ONE idea about how to use cron).\n\nA: I'd recommend Unison, which can sync between unix and windows.

You will select which environment you wish to log in to on the login screen at start up by clicking that little white circle. Assuming you have no other environments installed the list should just consist of \"Ubuntu\" and \"Ubuntu 2d\". When you install KDE you will see the two \"Ubuntu\" environments and the KDE Plasma Workspace. Click on the KDE option and input you password and you should be ready to go. \nOne side effect of doing this is that you will have programs from both environments listed. For example, you might have gedit as well as kde's text editor list under programs. You might also have KDE's settings manager and unity's settings manager both listed, which can get confusing. Other than that I have had no problems running KDE,mate,gnome,xfce, and unity all on the same machine. \nIn fact right now I am using a new install of xubuntu with Unity installed with it!

I see the typical purple screen while the OS boots, and then I hear the logon screen sound, but my screen remains purple. I have tried just about every key combination I can think of to get it to display the logon screen, but to no avail. Folding the lid down, and then back up again does not work either. Because this problem is not consistent, I usually just keep restarting the computer by holding down the power button, and then pushing it to start again. Eventually I will get the logon screen and then be able to work with Ubuntu no problem. Not sure why this issue is inconsistent.\nI have tried \"nomodeset\" in the grub configuration, but that doesn't work either. I also noticed that the screen sometimes looks glitched when I boot or try to even use certain applications. I have also tried installing the proprietary graphics driver, which actually created an even bigger problem: I lost all menus and the screen was totally messed up and had to use the terminal to go back to the open-source driver. The proprietary driver was said to be current for 12.10.\n\nA: I would try booting with a different kernel version in the grub menu, or into recovery mode, if possible. If that doesn't work it might be worth considering reverting to what you had before the upgrade. Make sure to try the ctrl-alt-T to see if you can at least open a terminal or get some response from the purple screen.\n", "Q: Migrating from 12.10 (Gnome default) to KUbuntu 12.10 I have installed default 12.10 desktop - Gnome from CD.

But after few minutes, everything freeze and I cannot control anything anymore. The only option left is to press the Power button of my Asus EeePC and switch everything off.\nQuestion 1 : What can I do to get my Unity environment back on 12.10 from the start, without using the terminal every time? What should I do to prevent the all system to freeze once done?\nSecondly, and since I cannot use Unity for new, I'm using an other interface, GNOME Shell. What's bothering me is that the Activities bar (let's call it like that, 'cause I don't know the proper name) and the Internet bar (or any bar from any other window) cannot merge into one another, reducing the display of the screen I'm actually using to peanuts! \nQuestion 2 : Is there a way to merge those two bars? Or is there a way to hide the Activities bar when I'm not using it like on Unity environment?\n\nA: \nWhat can I do to get my Unity environment back on Ubuntu 12.10 from the start, without using the terminal everytime ? and what should I do to prevent the all system to freeze once done ?\n\nThat sounds like something might be corrupted. You might want to try reinstalling Unity.\nsudo apt-get purge unity should do it (note: I haven't actually tried it, and I'm not on an Ubuntu machine right now, so the package name might be something slightly different than \"unity\"). Then, reinstall it with sudo apt-get install unity (or whatever the exact package name turns out to be).\n\nIs there a way to merge those two bars ? Or is there a way to hide the Activities bar when I'm not using it like on Unity environment ?\n\nThe WebUpd8 team has an global menu extension (see their LaunchPad page for installation details). I don't know how well it works (the last post I saw on it was for Ubuntu 11.10, when the extension was still in alpha; the PPA says it's on version 0.9), but it's easy enough to install and try.\nIf that doesn't work, it is possible to tweak the bar through other methods. There are a few ways that you may be able to accomplish basically what you want:\nInstall Gnome-Tweak-Tool (Easy, may not get you what you want) This is probably the easiest way, though I don't know if it will have what you want. Just run sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool to get it, then open it up and find the settings for the Activities bar. Whatever features GTT is set up to change, you'll be able to change them there.\nResize the bar (Easy, may not get you what you want) A similar question over at Unix & Linux offers up a simple way to resize the bar:\n\nHold both \"Windows key + Alt\" then \"Right-click\" the bar.\nThen click \"Properties\".\nIn the \"General Tab\", simply resize the bar.\n\nInstall a different theme (Medium; easy to do, but a lot of work involved; may or may not get what you want) Here's a good tutorial for doing so. Basically, install Gnome-Tweak and Gnome-Extensions, and find a theme you like, install it, and enable it in Gnome-Tweak.\nEdit your theme's CSS (Advanced, can get what you want if the CSS renderer allows for it, or you're creative with CSS) Gnome Shell is largely powered by web technologies (CSS, HTML, and JavaScript), which means you can do quite a bit of customization if you're not afraid to get your hands a little dirty. This may allow you to make changes that aren't available in the Properties. Here's a quick overview:\nFind your theme's CSS file This will depend on your install, and whether you're using a custom theme. I recommend Googling something like \"Ubuntu 12.10 gnome shell theme location\", though the above Unix & Linux cites /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/gnome-shell.css as the location (this may be different if you have a custom theme). Then, open it with Gedit, or your favorite text editor (may need sudo for this).\nFind the #panel block Once you've found the #panel block, you can change a number of its attributes, using CSS. Adjusting the font size will make it shorter (it's set up so its height is based on the text size).\nI'm not totally sure if this will work, since the Gnome devs have only implemented some of the CSS properties, but you may be able to do this to show/hide the top bar:\n#panel {\n  height: 1px; /* Adjust to desired minimize height, while still allowing you to hover over it. */\n  /* Other properties. */\n}\n\n#panel:hover {\n  height: 12px; /* Adjust to desired full size. */\n}\n\nReload Gnome Shell Press alt+F2, then type r in the box, and hit enter. This will reload the Gnome Shell (yes, it may disappear momentarily, but it will reappear).\nFor more things to tweak in the CSS, there's this awesome little post on the Ubuntu forums.\n", "Q: Remmina alternative Does anybody know any good alternative for Remmina (doesn't have to be free)?\nRDP would be the most important protocol for me.\nRemmina is extremely buggy lately.

Does anybody know how to fix this?\n\nA: OK, I've now successfully started using gmock by building my own version as per the README provided with the source download from googlemock project website. \nGet the download zip from the website:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/googlemock/downloads/list\nUnzip this to a directory, say ${GMOCK_ROOT}. Then, as per README instructions:\ncd ${GMOCK_ROOT}\nmkdir build\ncd build\ng++ -I../gtest/include -I../gtest -I../include -I.. -c ../gtest/src/gtest-all.cc\ng++ -I../gtest/include -I../gtest -I../include -I.. -c ../src/gmock-all.cc\nar -rv libgmock.a gtest-all.o gmock-all.o\n\nThus you have your own libgmock.a in ${GMOCK_ROOT}/build. You actually also need pthreads to compile, so your compile command after that becomes:\ng++ -I${GMOCK_ROOT}/include/ main.cpp -L${GMOCK_ROOT}/build -lgmock -lpthread\n\n\nA: libgmock-dev will be included in the default Ubuntu 18.10 repositories, Otherwise in earlier Ubuntu releases you have to manually download and install it.\nsudo apt-get install libgmock-dev\ncd /usr/src/googletest/googlemock/\nsudo mkdir build\nsudo cmake ..\nsudo make\nsudo cp googlemock/*.a /usr/lib\n\n\nA: To give context to Pavel's answer, the compiled Google Mock binary is not distributed with the Ubuntu package because of the reason given here. This explanation is for Google Test, but the principle applies to any C++ library.\nSpecifically, it says:\n\nIn the early days, we said that you could install compiled Google Test\n  libraries on *nix systems using make install. Then every user of your\n  machine can write tests without recompiling Google Test.\nThis seemed like a good idea, but it has a got-cha: every user needs\n  to compile his tests using the same compiler flags used to compile the\n  installed Google Test libraries; otherwise he may run into undefined\n  behaviors (i.e. the tests can behave strangely and may even crash for\n  no obvious reasons).\nWhy? Because C++ has this thing called the One-Definition Rule: if two\n  C++ source files contain different definitions of the same\n  class/function/variable, and you link them together, you violate the\n  rule. The linker may or may not catch the error (in many cases it's\n  not required by the C++ standard to catch the violation). If it\n  doesn't, you get strange run-time behaviors that are unexpected and\n  hard to debug.\nIf you compile Google Test and your test code using different compiler\n  flags, they may see different definitions of the same\n  class/function/variable (e.g. due to the use of #if in Google Test).\n  Therefore, for your sanity, we recommend to avoid installing\n  pre-compiled Google Test libraries. Instead, each project should\n  compile Google Test itself such that it can be sure that the same\n  flags are used for both Google Test and the tests.\n\nSo your original problem was because installing the google-mock package only installed the source code, and when you tried to compile your sample application, no gmock library could be found.\n\nA: I tried to install on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS 'gmock' and everything related to its installation.

As I know from experience, what it says about its support for authenticated podcast feeds in the FAQ is accurate.

It is possible that a system's dependency structure can be so corrupt as to require manual intervention (which\n             usually means using dselect(1) or dpkg --remove to eliminate some of the offending packages). Use of this option together\n  with -m\n             may produce an error in some situations. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Broken.\n\n\nA: No answer of this thread has solved it for me. I had removed the lock files, and there was no PID running, yet, whenever I executed sudo dpkg --configure -a, the shell was stuck at one of the previously locked \"apt\" tasks that I had force-closed by closing the terminal in the end.\nI also killed the apt processes using sudo killall apt apt-get. The stuck apt task in my case was \"Setting up docker-ce (5:20.10.1~3-0~ubuntu-bionic)\".\nSolution in my case:\n\n*\n\n*Boot in recovery mode.\n\n*In the recovery menu, choose \"root\" in order to \"Drop to root shell prompt\".\n\n*Press Enter.\n\n*Type 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'.\n\n*Go on with what you were about to do, it should work now, and / or just reboot.\n\nPlease see screenshots and detailed explanation (e.g. how to get the recovery mode at start) at the answer of docker ps stuck … docker install also just hangs.\n\nA: This can happen if the upgrade process was interrupted (like you're connection was lost). You can try using screen as root (sudo su) to get back into the session.\nscreen -r\n\n\nA: One thing that's not mentioned - you could have unattended/automatic upgrades enabled.  If so, unattended-upgr is likely holding the lock on dpkg.  In that case, forcibly removing the lock file is NOT a good idea!\nYou can check if it's running using the following:\nps -A | grep unattended-upgr\n\nYou can also see if that's the process holding the lock using Step 1 of Daniel Trugman's answer.  Option #2 (using bash) was the only one that showed me the PID that had the file locked, and pointed me to unattended-upgr.\nAFAIK, your only two options are to patiently wait for the updates to finish, or temporarily disable unattended/automatic updates, install the needed package, and turn it back on.\n", "Q: What to use for a working area when learning python and Linux/Ubuntu?

In my case is was 141. \nBy manipulating with export COLUMNS=XXX I was indeed been able to adjust the columns amount.\nAnd this 141 number comes from the next. \nMy .bashrc file contains the next code:\n# check the window size after each command and, if necessary,\n# update the values of LINES and COLUMNS.\nshopt -s checkwinsize\n\nI don't know for sure, but pretty much seems like using shopt command Ubuntu detects my screen resolution and sets the according number of terminal columns.\nAgain, setting export COLUMNS=XXX allows me to change this number for the current terminal window.\nSo in your particular case, you would have to add export COLUMNS=200 after the quoted shopt -s checkwinsize or at the very end of .bashrc.\n\nA: Just make the terminal larger with your mouse and type:\nsudo resize\n\n:-)\n\nA: The following command:\ndocker exec -e COLUMNS=\"`tput cols`\" -e LINES=\"`tput lines`\" -ti container bash\n\nworks under most, if not all circumstances. \n", "Q: Has anyone discovered a fix for the Asus Zenbook screen problems?

Then use the normal installation process.\n\n*If you want dual boot and the current OS uses EFI (which is probably your case), then you can switch to legacy only temporarily to install Ubuntu.  You must setup the partitions manually.

I've come across plenty of tutorials that say to place the files at '/var/www/' and I've also seen others that put them in '/home/$USER/public_html/'.\nDuring my testing and figuring stuff out, I was successfully able to view a test site URL from each location.\nIs one better than the other?\nI thought that maybe it was just preference.\nBut the more I think about it, the more I want to keep all my work in my Home folder.\n\nA: The differences are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you leave it in /var/www you will have some permission problems that you will have to deal with. In your home folder, you are in charge since all files in it have your ownership by default.\n\n*Some users have the /home folder in another partition which means a +1 if you happen to format the root partition and leave the home partition alone for an upgrade.\n\n*It saves you from adding a user to /var/www or having to change permissions for it if you just put it in your home folder. For example instead of /var/www it would be /home/USER/www.\n\n*If you need to share via Samba the files, it is MUCH easier to do it in /home than outside of it.\nThere are more reasons but this are the ones at the top of my mind right now.\n\nA: In general, it will depend on what sort of development are you doing.  If it is purely personal or for learning/testing purposes, then having it in ~/public_html is fine - there is no real difference as far as the webserver is concerned, and you won't run into any permission issues that way.  But if your development will need to be deployed to other servers where things might not match up with your dev box, testing it in /var/www is a very good idea.\nI generally do my web development in a bazaar branch under ~/local/src/ , then I use bzr push to copy completed code into a folder under /var/www for testing.  Once it's reasonably tested there, I can use bzr-upload to push the code to my actual production server.  This ensures that anything that gets deployed is checked in and tested, keeps /var/www clean, and keeps all of the working source code in my homedir.  \n\nA: In your home folder is probably best if you and only you are changing the contents. /var/www/public_html is more standard and works if the user dir directive is turned off.\nRule of thumb: if multiple people will be changing the content it's better to put it into /var/www/public_html and make that folder group writeable allowing all users who publish content to write there.\nOtherwise, either location is fine for the reasons given in the other answers.\n", "Q: Splice gives blank screen on startup I just installed splice from the humble bundle, and I get a blank screen on startup.

For instance, a simple Nautilus window would have, when you move the cursor to the top bar, a list of options such as View / Edit  etc.   I have nothing like that for any window or application.  It's just solid black.  This is a huge problem and I'm not sure what the issue is.  Has anyone else experienced this?\n\nA: Cairo Dock has no options in the bar.

I've just received very old toshiba portege 3480ct from friend and hdd on it has no os. I have an IDE adapter to usb and was wondering, can I install it as an external and then put hdd back into laptop? What can I do here? I tried but when ubuntu boots on old laptop when re-inserted as internal hdd, screen is all messed up and i can hear system loading forever. Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!\n\nA: If the screen is messed up and the computer is taking a long time to load, then the computer might not be able to handle Ubuntu. My desktop, with an AMD Sempron @ 1.7 GHz, 2 GB RAM and an NVIDIA GEFORCE Graphics card couldn't, so this old laptop with a 600 MHz processor and 64 MB RAM (specs here) probably can't. On my Ubuntu laptop, with a CORE 2 DUO and 2 GB RAM, usually about 600-800 MB of RAM is being used at a time, with 30-60 MB being used in the swap. You could try using Lubuntu instead, it's designed to be lightweight. However, I would recommend Puppy Linux. Puppy is an extremely lightweight OS that loads itself into the RAM. It installs on a 1 GB SD card with plenty of room to spare (you can use UNETBOOTIN to put the .iso file onto a usb flash drive or a disk burning program such as Brasero to put it onto a CD). Puppy is so lightweight that it loads itself into the RAM and doesn't even need a hard drive to work! However, if you do want to install onto the hard drive, you can use a frugal install.\nThat's the long explanation. In short, Ubuntu is too much to handle for this old, old, old computer, so you'll have to use something else.\n\nA: Update 11-20-2012\nOk, so I messed around a little more and found a very straightforward way that worked for me.  Before the steps, this is assuming you already have all the necessary files download: puppy linux distro of your choice (I chose puppy linux wary 5.3) and Universal USB Installer v.1.9.1.6 and the neccesary hardware: IDE/Sata USB adapter and USB flashdrive/stick.  Also, a few specs about my laptop:\nToshiba Portege 3480ct\n192mb of ram\nIntel Pentium 2 processor\n12GB HDD\nThe Portege 3480ct does have one usb drive and a port for a PCIMCIA CD drive however cannot boot directly from these two therefore, depending on what hdd you have, you will need an adapter to connect it as an external source, my hdd drive for the 3480ct has an IDE connection and so I just bought a very basic IDE USB adapter.  So if you have an older laptop like my 3480ct that doesn’t allow for a straight boot from CD or USB, this process should work for you. CAUTION BEFORE ATTEMPTING, MAKE SURE YOU BACK UP ALL DATA ON HDD AND OR AM WILLING TO RISK LOSING ALL DATA ON HDD THAT YOU ARE LOOKING TO INSTALL DISTRO ON AS THINGS CAN GO VERY WRONG\nProcedure: If you believe your laptop can boot from USB as a USB-FDD, then skip to step 6 as you won’t have to worry about the HDD step.  If it cannot boot from USB-FDD, then start with step 1.\n1) Plug in hdd drive to IDE adapter then into computer/laptop you will be using to transfer files to. Format hdd to Fat32 and give it a drive letter. MAKE SURE YOU REMEMBER DRIVE LETTER!!\n2) Run Universal USB Installer and select linux distribution from dropbox. (Must select exact distro that you will be putting on hdd)\n3) Browse for where you saved .iso of puppy linux and open.\n4) Then select usb flash drive letter, AGAIN, MAKE SURE CORRECT DRIVE LETTER Another box will pop up saying “Format X:\\Drive (Erases Content) and click on box. Hit create, it’s going to say something about erasing data and stuff just click ok.\n5) After done, unplug and place back into laptop as internal.\n6) Now plug in usb drive/stick and follow same procedure as you did with the hdd, making sure drive letter on usb drive/stick matches when choosing where to put puppy linux distro in USB Installer.  After complete, plug into old laptop USB Drive.\n7) Now boot laptop and click on F2 or whatever F button you have to get to Boot Bios and choose boot from interal hdd. (If booting from USB, choose boot from USB-FDD option)\n8) Let puppy linux boot and then click on F3 for advanced commands.  Next you’re going to want to type in “puppy pmedia=usbflash” (without quotations). I found that this allows puppy linux to directly boot from your flash drive which the laptop Bios doesn’t allow.\n9) Wait for puppy linux to boot and then follow setup instructions.  Depending on your laptop, you might have different choices, just read instructions carefully.\n10) Once puppy linux desktop is up, go Menu>System>GParted Partition manager and HAVE IT SEARCH YOUR INTERNAL HDD.  Format and partition to ext2.\n11) Then go to Menu>Setup>puppy universal installer and click on Internal (IDE or SATA) hard drive. Follow instructions and let puppy universal installer complete the install on your internal hdd, it might ask you some questions just choose all the default choices.\n12) Once complete, a screen will popup and talk about Grub install, if you want to, read it and make note of it.  Then go to Menu>System>Grub Legacy bootloader config. Choose simple install, then standard.  Next a window will pop up asking you where you want Grub file to go, just type in “/dev/xxx” without quotations (xxx meaning whatever your hdd is named in linux, mine was sda, might be called hda, make sure its correct!)\n13) After that is done, reboot and it will ask you if you want to save a warysave file. Just click yes and choose the recommended choices they offer.  Then it will create and whatever it needs.  Wait for it to finish and reboot and THE MINUTE IT REBOOTS, PULL OUT USB FLASH DRIVE/STICK!  This will allow the laptop to boot from the Grub bootloader and it will also say booting from Grub.  Let it load and then a screen will pop up possibly giving you a few choices to choose from.  Just choose the LINUX option and press Enter.\n14) Now it’ll take you back to the beginning of the puppy linux boot loading screen and just let it install.  After it’s done, you’ll then be brought back to the inital puppy linux setup screen where you choose your keyboard etc. and go through it again.\n15) After you are done, it’ll boot to Puppy Linux desktop and you are pretty much DONE!! Mess around with it if you want to and get a feel oft desktop.  After you are done messing around with it, go to Menu>Shutdown>Reboot and let the laptop reboot again. While booting down, it should say something like, “internal hddinstalled, save file already saved\" or something of that nature. Don’t worry, it just means that the warysave file has already been saved because it reads that it’s an interl hdd. Again when reached to screen of options, click Linux again and it should load up and take you straight to Puppy Linux Desktop. Always just choose the Linux option as thats the OS, all other options I did not mess with SO CHOOSE AT YOUR OWN RISK!\nAm looking forward to installing UBUNTU 12.10 on my desktop, can’t wait to mess around with that! Any questions, please ask and I will do my best to help.  Again, am very new to Linux and have gone through many trials and errors to get this to install on my 3480ct, which is one of the hardest laptops to install any OS from forums I’ve read.  Hopefully this one helped.  \nThanks to JOSH for directing me to the Frugal Install which eventually led me to this long and gruesome process of getting it working on my laptop.\n", "Q: I can't make my Windows 8 boot loader to run Ubuntu or even ask me which OS to run as dual boot! I've been trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 as secondary OS on my laptop. The primary OS I have is Windows 8.\nSo I have partitioned drive where NTFS is for Windows 8 and other partition is EXT4 for Ubuntu.\nWhen I installed Ubuntu I picked the EXT4 partition and picked 3 boot loader options so far:\n/dev/sta ATA HITACHI (750 GB) <-= this...\n/dev/sta1 Windows 8 (loader) <-= and this...\n/dev/sta2\n/dev/sta5\n/dev/sta6 Ubuntu 12.04 (12.04) <-= and this...\n/dev/stb\n\nAfter like 3 installations I still can't boot Ubuntu, nor can even see any boot loader... It goes straight to Windows 8 booting...\nPlease help! This has been very frustrating day and a half... And I don't think it should take that long to figure out =[\nANSWER: I could not find a proper solution for my problem. I'm not sure if I encountered some drive corruption, or program glitch, the only solution that fixed my problem was to make drive back-up and completely re-partition my hard-drive. Please post if anyone encounter similar problem. As I really would like to know why my drive failed to install Ubuntu on my drive.\n\nA: How about you use /dev/sta6 for the grub bootloader. Next steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run update-grub to write the ubuntu bootsector\n\n*Copy the ubuntu bootsector into a file: dd if=/dev/sta6 of=boot.lnx bs=512 count=1\n\n*Transfer the file to the windows loader partition /dev/sta1, either by copying or via USB stick and booting to windows.\n\n\nThen use these commands in windows shell to add a Linux selection to the windows loader:\nbcdedit /create /d “Linux” /application BOOTSECTOR\n\nBCDEdit will return an alphanumeric identifier for this entry that I will refer to as {ID} in the remaining steps. You’ll need to replace {ID} by the actual returned identifier. An example of {ID} is {d7294d4e-9837-11de-99ac-f3f3a79e3e93}. Next, let’s specify which partition hosts a copy of the boot.lnx file:\nbcdedit /set {ID} device partition=c:\nbcdedit /set {ID}  path \\boot.lnx\nbcdedit /displayorder {ID} /addlast\nbcdedit /timeout 30\n\nhttp://www.iceflatline.com/2009/09/how-to-dual-boot-windows-7-and-linux-using-bcdedit/\n\nA: Make sure your Windows 8 is not 64-bit with the UEFI boot type, if it is pre-installed then it mean yes.

In Configure custom actions edit the catfish command from:\n    catfish --path=%f\n\nto\n    searchmonkey --directory=/\n\nor\n    searchmonkey --directory=/home\n\nor any path you like and it will start up ready to search what ever path you insert of course. The first command with the search starting at root (=/) will scan every hard drive you have. So far no command options found to search the folder you would right click upon. Possible to make two context menu entries and have one named root and the other named home or whatever path you like. Hope this helps.\n\nA: With gnome-search-tool and catfish, command-line options are available and so the programs can integrate into Thunar quite nicely; the --path=%f option is important as that means the location of the selected folder (with its files) can be passed on to these search tools so they open at the right folder. \nIf you enter the name of the program and then add--help, you will see all the command-line options for these two search tools: for gnome-search-tool --help we have many options such as:\n --named=STRING                  Set the text of \"Name contains\" search option\n --path=PATH                     Set the text of \"Look in folder\" search option\n\nWith catfish there are similar options, but it used to be essential to specify --fileman=thunar in addition to --path=%f. This was found to be necessary as catfish used to only open the home folder, not the one selected if the fileman workaround was not used. However, it works now with just --path=%f with Catfish 0.3.2 and Thunar 1.2.3 on Xubuntu 12.04. \nIt doesn't seem to be possible to pass any command-line options to searchmonkey, and there doesn't seem to be any information available: the mailing-lists and forums seem pretty empty. Even if you set the filemanager and options in searchmonkey > settings > preferences > systemcalls, and then specify options in the custom action, it doesn't seem to integrate into Thunar successfully. \nSearchmonkey doesn't seem to integrate with other filemanagers either after testing, so it must be because it does not accept any suitable command-line options. The only way to make it integrate would be to create a patch for it and recompile it, which is probably not really worthwhile considering how useful catfish is.\n\nA: Please note, as of Searchmonkey v0.8.3 we now accept the command-line args, like this:\n$ searchmonkey -d {directory} -f {filename} -t {containing text}\n\nFor example:\n$ searchmonkey -d /home/tux -f txt -t linux\n\nwill open searchmonkey configured to scan directory /home/tux to search files containing txt in their names and search inside the files for the string linux.\nONE to THREE parameters (-d and/or -t and/or -f) are also allowed, and of course -? will display help!\nLet me know how you get on!\n\nA: Very nice. Here is how I use searchmonkey 0.8.3 in nemo, as a 'search here' script. (placed in /home/$USER/.local/share/nemo/scripts/)\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# This only works with searchmonkey 0.8.3+\n#passes nemo directory string to 'obj' string\n\nobj=\"$NEMO_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI\"\n\n#This cuts off the first 7 characters from the string.\n#Nemo adds 'file://' to the beginning of the directory string.\n#It confuses searchmonkey, and must be clipped off.\n\nCURDIR=`echo $obj | cut -c 8-`\n\n#Add this if you want to see the formatted string, before searchmonkey executes.\n#(For testing purposes only. not needed)\n\nzenity --info --text=$CURDIR --no-wrap\n\n#executes searchmonkey, and passes formatted directory string to it.\n\nsearchmonkey -d $CURDIR\n\nHope this helps anyone using nemo file manager (works in peppermint 10)\n", "Q: Is there any support with a NetGear WNA3100 USB Adapter in Ubuntu 12.10?

But I'm not sure about this.\nTry the command \"df -h\", for file system disk space usage. It will show you the size and usage of different partitions.\nYou can also use baobab, which gives you a graphical representation. It is installed on ubuntu per default. Just type \"Disk Usage Analyzer\" into the Unity hud. \nUpdate:\nWell, as for why Thunderbird uses up so much space. For one, you could look into the folder, maybe you put some other files inadvertently there. \nThe folder with the funny name of numbers and letters is a mail profile. The data is held in sqlite database files, so you best not mess with them but just open Thunderbird.\nLook for mails with attachments. Use \"File->Empty Trash\" to finally delete mails from the trash. Use \"File->Compact Folders\" to optimize and clean up, but that won't bring you gigabytes of space.\n\nA: Running\nsudo du -hscx *\n\nwill not expand to hidden files and folders in the current directory. This is valid for most shells (e.g. Bash) and it concerns the * here.\nI suggest to install ncdu and use that instead.

Quick Version\nI have set up a private deb repository and copied some signed deb packages into it. I have installed the signing key locally. However when I try to install from the repo I get this warning:\nWARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!\n\nWhen installing manually, I can just press y but I want to install these packages automatically using puppet, and that fails.\nSo what's the problem? Do I need to resign packages with a key I control? Is there a better way of ensuring I have a particular version of puppet installed?\nMore Details\nI have got the packages from the puppet debian repository - http://apt.puppetlabs.com/ I just copy the package from (for lucid) this directory\nThe repository is then updated with a script that runs these commands for each repo:\ncd /var/www/html/apt/ubuntu/lucid\ndpkg-scanpackages binary /dev/null | gzip -9c > binary/Packages.gz\ndpkg-scansources sources /dev/null | gzip -9c > sources/Sources.gz\n\nI have installed the signing key on the client.\n$ sudo apt-key list\n/etc/apt/trusted.gpg\n--------------------\n...\npub   4096R/4BD6EC30 2010-07-10 [expires: 2016-07-08]\nuid                  Puppet Labs Release Key (Puppet Labs Release Key) <info@puppetlabs.com>\n...\n\nThe rationale for doing this is that I want all puppet clients to be the same version. So all machines should get the packages from my repository by using the following pin in /etc/apt/preferences.d/puppet:\nPackage: puppet puppet-common facter\nPin: origin deb.example.org\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\n(We are currently using puppet 2.6.x, so I need a priority of 1001 to downgrade precise clients from 2.7.x).\nI have read about holding packages but that doesn't help me change package versions.\nAll suggestions welcome.\n\nA: *.deb packages are not signed directly, in Debian. There is a way to do that, but nothing in Debian uses it.\nThe principle used by Debian and Ubuntu APT repositories instead works like this:\nAll *.deb binary packages are listed in a file (e.g.) binary-i386/Packages.gz with their checksums. (All current Debian and Ubuntu versions use all three(!) of MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 for this. Old versions used MD5 only.) All *.dsc source packages are listed in source/Sources.gz.\nAll these files binary-*/Packages.* and source/Sources.* are then listed, with their checksums, in a file Release, which is signed as either Release.gpg or InRelease, with the PGP key of the repository.\nSo basically, if you put any packages into an APT repository of your own, you will need to sign that repository, and use apt-key add to import your own repository's signing key into your system when you want to use any packages from that repository.\n", "Q: How do I fake an MX record for a domain? I'm testing two mail servers that live on two (virtual) machines with made up domain names for emails. When one of the servers needs to send an email to the other one, it seemingly performs a DNS lookup for the recipient domain's MX record, which doesn't point the sender server to the correct IP, no matter what IP/domain mapping I put in /etc/hosts.\nSo should I install a DNS server and create a custom MX record for the recipient domain? How do I do this on Ubuntu 12.04 or is there an easier way?\n\nA: You don't actually need to set up MX records for email delivery. 'A' records will do the job as well. See \"Fallback to the address record\" at Wikipedia about MX records.\nIn order to make fake hosts in /etc/hosts working for Postfix, you must tell it to actually use that and not just DNS-only by setting smtp_dns_support_level = disabled in /etc/postfix/main.cf. See the postconf documentation for details.\nAlternatively, you could configure your MTA (e.g. Postfix) to use a specific transport for a domain. For Postfix use transport_maps.\n", "Q: Set up Ubuntu Server 12.04 for my office As I have great interest in Linux, I suggested my GM to update my office server to Ubuntu. He agreed to buy a new server (Hardware) after explaining him the good things about Linux & bad things about Windows. \nThe scenario is:\n\n\n*\n\n*The main server will be Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (where I should create a domain & users on domain).\n\n*The old server (which is Win 2003) is going to be an application server.\n\n*Around 30+ windows (both Win 7 & Vista, 32 & 64 bit) machines should connect to the domain & be able to access the shared folders on Ubuntu server.\n\n\nI really appreciate some help as I don't have any experience on Linux server. At least how to guidelines.\n\nA: You are setting up a server in a \"Small Medium Business\" (< 100 employees), which may be very simple or very difficult, depending of what you will want to do with it.\nShort answer\n\n\n*\n\n*substitute a windows server by a linux server is not as easy as it seems, but possible (just it might be overwhelming for the amateur/enthusiast, leave that for the matured professional administrator) \n\n*add a linux server to an existing working network, is very easy and a good way to start with linux without any drawback, nor compromising the existing services. Benefit: linux services don't have licenses - they come  free and forever :)\n\n\nLong answer\nWindow server does more than file sharing. \nSo to substitute it by linux, you will have to:  \n\n\n*\n\n*understand all that windows was doing    \n\n*how to configure linux to do all that  \n\n*and migrate the configuration settings from the windows -> linux  \n\n\nAnd do it all in the backstage without the clients (employees) noticing any change (or they will complaint: if they are your friends they will laugh and joke the first day, but not after 5 days of suffering :) antecipate it :) )\nBefore disconnecting the Windows Server, you should take into account some hidden things that the windows server might be doing besides being a File Server:\n\n\n*\n\n*managing windows domains, primary controllers and active directory\n\n*share printers\n\n*email server (by gods sake, if this is the case, then be aware that preparing a linux email server is no small task... and neither is maintaining it)\n\n*login scripts used by windows clients, and delivered by the windows server (it can be done with linux server also, but you will have to do it (see samba)) \n\n\nThis is not supposed to scare you, but instead to make you aware and avoid disaster :)\nWith that said, here comes the good news: linux runs in almost any machine, with much lower requirements than windows servers, meaning you can recycle old hardware to try and make a test linux server without buying anything, and use it to test&convince all other in the office.\nThe simplest way to start, is to add (not substitute) a Linux Server to the existing network, and create simple services in the Linux Server such as\n\n\n*\n\n*File-Server (with samba, very easy, lots of info, can also share printers)\n\n*Chat service (see ejabberd, not so simple, but not that hard)\n\n*Internal Forum for employees (see phpBB, easy to install, up and running in a breeze)  \n\n*HTTP proxy (well, better check before promissing anything)\n\n\nOther services can also be implemented in Linux (and work better than in windows, that's the backbone of how internet works) but they require a more profound knowledge from the system administrator, such as email, firewall, vpn, active directory, primary domain controller, calendar/task sharing, Dns, system monitoring and alerts, ...\nI would recommend you start by making a virtual machine (use VirtualBox) and try to make the server there as you intend to do in reality. Also use some linux distribution with which you feel comfortable and there is lots of info/people (big community to search for help), such as centOs or Ubuntu Server\nFinally, if you only want to make a simple server-for-1-job, search for a linux distribution which gives you a service and comes ready-to-use, such as  FreeNas\nLinux can provide a fantastic advantage, when well understood :)\nHope it helps - tell how it went\n\nA: This is a very, very bad idea.  Trying to use Samba to emulate even an old-school NT-style PDC, much less a modern Active Directory DC, is not a trivial task and is full of nasty pitfalls.\nI have to be honest here - from the sounds of it, you aren't ready to try to implement Linux in production at all yet.  WITH THAT SAID, if you're absolutely determined to try your hand at Linux in production (not just in test), a more sensible attempt would be setting up a KVM virtualization host, and installing Windows Server as a guest on KVM rather than on the bare metal.  This gets you many of the advantages of Linux (high performance storage stack, excellent memory management, native RAID/LVM capabilities) and the advantages of virtualization (I/O cache that persists through reboots, hardware isolation, ability to run multiple guests on a single host, image based snapshots) without actually changing anything about what the end user expects the system to act like.\nIn practice - I strongly, strongly, strongly recommend that you play with KVM in a test  environment before you even think about deploying it in production.  It's a very powerful tool and could do great things for you, but rushing half-cocked into trying to deploy Linux for production in a Windows environment is a recipe for disaster, no matter how enthusiastic you are.\nFWIW - I do deploy Linux servers in mostly-Windows environments, professionally, every day.  This is not about Linux or Windows being \"better\", this is just about getting a job done well.\n\nA: Everything you need will be answered by reading documentation about Samba\n\n\n*\n\n*Documentation\nhttp://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/\n\n*Wiki https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Main_Page\nWith it you can act as a DC and have a way to setup shares with windows machines\nNote: linux servers don't have any kind of GUI!\nFor your first time, you might want to install one.\nI suggest against it, but deploying a server OS you are not familiar with to a production environment is not a good idea to begin with. \nOfcourse the best way to learn about something is to \"just do it\" ;)\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.10 very high temprature on idle I upgraded my laptop to ubuntu 12.10 and my laptop temperature went extremely high.

I can see that you have quite strong machine, and I assume that you have a good amount of RAM memory - so you do not need a lot of SWAP space. Having big SWAP partition (i.e. 2-3GB) allows system to use hard drive as RAM memory, so your HDD works even if you don't actually access any files on HDD at the moment. \nUnfortunately Ubuntu assign to much SWAP space in my opinion during automate installation in my case Ubuntu took 2GB from 160GB HDD. having 4GB RAM memory I think, that 256-512MB is enough (my friend having 8GB RAM machine use no SWAP)\nI think that can be part of your problem.\n\nA: For most hardware there should only be two ways in which software can affect its temperature:\n\n\n*\n\n*It overloads it by running it close to 100% for a long time. (Should not apply to good hardware)\n\n*It winds down active cooling (i.e. fan speed)\n\n\nIf it's 1, then you should consult the manufacturer of your hardware.\nFor 2 I suggest that you have a look at How do I get fan control working? and make sure that fan speed is turned up.\n", "Q: Software center from kubuntu \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhere is the “pysdm” package? \n\nI was trying to install pysdm on my kubuntu when i saw that i couldnt found it in software center, but in ubuntu software center it is.\nShouldnt kubuntu have repositories from ubuntu, it is in ubuntu's family?\nIf no, how can i get ubuntu repository in kubuntu software center?\nIt is no duplicate since \"pysdm\" is just an example, there are many software that are missing from muon software center and exist in ubuntu software center.\nThanks for the people that answered.\nWanted to know if why they are different since they share repositories(or maybe they don't share repositories and I am mistaken).\n\nA: Muon Software Center is (not yet at least) an all-purposes package manager: it's mainly meant to explore and easily install full applications, sort of avoiding the view of the thousands of dependencies and libraries included in the repositories.\nIf you try to search for any lib* package in Muon Software Center, even when you type the full name of a package in the repository, it will not find it.\nUbuntu Software Center, on the other hand, has this capability.\nI guess that Muon Software Center only selects a range of applications to include and search through.\nSo if you want to install a specific package (even when an application) you're safer by using Muon Package Manager instead, which is the equivalent of Synaptic shipped by default on Kubuntu, or sudo apt-get install as already suggested.\n\nA: Can you try to installing it from the Synaptic Package Manager? \nIt is showing up for me both in the Ubuntu Software center and the Synaptic Package manager.\nYou should also be able to install it from the command line sudo apt-get install pysdm\n\nA: http://www.gogogeekboy.com/2012/07/installing-ubuntu-software-center-kubuntu-12-04/ i did some digging around when i decided to scrap ubuntu12.10 and go back to 12.04 and after deciding to give kubuntu a shot as well, getting the games etc i want was one of my first questions. i haventtried the reccomendations on the siote yet as i havent actually installed kubuntu and am just running a live usb to try it ou but the above might work\n", "Q: adjust max possible volume in pulseaudio Somtimes some sound/movie/music on my Ubuntu_12.04 system is at a very low volume by itself.\nHenceforth I increase the volume of the sound output. I can use the following setting (see screenshot)\n\nIt seems therefore that pulseaudio is able to increase the volume beyond the maximum that appears possible by merely using the \"increase-volume\" buttons of the machine. \nMy questions is how I can adjust Pulseaudio to allow a greater range or a higher max volume increasing???\nEspecially with some audio material that is at a very low volume to start with it would be nice to be able to swiftly increase the output volume (powerup) to a higher setting than maybe necessary to other -already quite loud- material.\n\nA: I tried this command:\npactl set-sink-volume alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo 150%\n\nand it was very helpful. One can change the 150% to any value.\n\nA: Video Demonstration\n\nI use\npactl set-sink-volume 0 100%\n\nWhere 100% is the default unboosted volume and 0 is the Sink # from pacmd list-sinks or the index: from pactl list sinks (if you don't have/like pacmd). You can enter values above 100% to get audio boost (200% for example).\nExample of retrieving your Sink number/index:\n$ pactl list sinks | grep -iE '(^sink|name:|index:|alsa\\.(name|card_name))'\nSink #3\n    Name: alsa_output.usb-0c76_USB_PnP_Audio_Device-00.analog-stereo\n        alsa.name = \"USB Audio\"\n        alsa.card_name = \"USB PnP Audio Device\"\nSink #4\n    Name: alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo\n        alsa.name = \"ALC257 Analog\"\n        alsa.card_name = \"HDA Intel PCH\"\n\n$ pacmd list-sinks | grep -iE '(^sink|name:|index:|alsa\\.(name|card_name))'\n  * index: 3\n    name: <alsa_output.usb-0c76_USB_PnP_Audio_Device-00.analog-stereo>\n        alsa.name = \"USB Audio\"\n        alsa.card_name = \"USB PnP Audio Device\"\n    index: 4\n    name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo>\n        alsa.name = \"ALC257 Analog\"\n        alsa.card_name = \"HDA Intel PCH\"\n\n\nA: The maximal possible volume level we can obtain from sliding the volume control to more than 100% is approx. 153% above the normal peak limit. Provided we had set the ALSA volume with alsamixer to 100 these 100% are the level above which audio will be clipped or distorted. This also will happen when amplifying to 153% with the slider.\nNevertheless is is possible to further increase this level by setting the sink level using the follwing command in a terminal:\npacmd set-sink-volume <sink> <value>\n\nReplace <sink> with your sink name or sink index as given from:\npacmd list-sinks\n\nThe lower limit for <value> obviously is 0, a linear volume of 100% is a value of 65536, anything higher will be further amplified. A value of 512000 will thus lead to an overamplification of 781%.\nThis is a very crude method to amplify sound output of varying level as overamplifying will lead not only to clipping and ugly distortion but may also damage your speakers.\nTherefore it would be a better way to normalize your audio output. See the following question on how to do this with pulseaudio:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatically adjust the volume based on content?\n\nA: Here is a little script to do the calculation and set volume for you (just pass  the volume as an argument).

It needs the drive to be unmounted to format it.\nNormally Nautilus will automatically mount the drive when inserted, so I have to wait for this to happen and then unmount the drive before formatting it. The only problem is that if the user has disabled automounting then my program will wait forever.\nI could change the dconf auto-mount setting when my program starts, and then change it back when it exits, but this is not a good solution because the setting wil not be restored if my program crashes.\nHow can I temporarily prevent Nautilus from automounting USB drives only during the time when my program is running?\n\nA: You may use PROGRAM to check if your program is running to activate that UDEV rule, otherwise it is disabled because pgrep returns unsuccessfully.\n\nPROGRAM\nExecute a program to determine whether there is a match; the key is true if the program returns successfully. The device properties are made available to the executed program in the environment. The program's standard output is available in the RESULT key.\nThis can only be used for very short-running foreground tasks.

Still solvable I'd say, but not without some deep research work into desktop session life cycle or desktop event handling. That ain't my expertise. ;)\nObviously you know already how to switch off the feature in question. If you're concerned that it is not switched back if your program crashes then there are only two possibilities: Take care that your program does not crash or program a program that watches your program and switches the feature back when your program is not running. \nBut maybe there is a different solution. You could append a line like this to /etc/fstab:\nLABEL=somemagic /path ntfs noauto,user 0 0\n\nThen if the filesystem on the drive carries that label it remains untouched by the automount feature and you can (u)mount it without disturbance. See man mount and man fstab for details. You could also use UUID instead of LABEL, but that depends on your use case and filesystem. \n", "Q: Dual head switching problem My media player runs Ubuntu 12.10 with video drivers Gallium 0.4 on AMD RV710, experience standard.  The graphics card is reported (lshw) as a Radeon HD 4350.  This card is driving two displays.  The first is a 17\" Dell 4:3 monitor via DVI at around 800:600 pixels.  This houses the Launcher and a few screenlets and always remains on.  It is the only screen I have on at boot.  The second display is an LCD 16:9 TV of 42\" via HDMI at 1920:1080 pixels.  This is switched on occasionally when required.  The display is then extended so that the Dell is on the left and the TV the right, with the tops of each display aligned.\nThe problem occurs on transitions from switching the TV on or off - though the problem is more common when switching on from single to dual extended display.  The symptom is that more often than not, when the TV is turned on, and the driver detects it, it corrupts the initialisation.  Switching off and on again a few times fixes it.  On rare occasions switching off causes the single display to be corrupted.  Again, switching on and off again usually cures it in one.  I had a similar problem in 12.04 until I finally got the dual head to work properly with the proprietary drivers, after which it worked consistently well.\nSo my question.  As the driver is perfectly capable of initialising and running my two displays, why does it so often fail to do so, and is there anything I can do to make it work more consistently?\nTIA\n\nA: Not so much an answer as a quick workaround.  By switching to a tty and back, X seems to reinitialise cleanly.  That is \n\nCtrl+Alt+F1-6\n\nfollowed by a \n\nCtrl+Alt+F7.\n\nNot a cure, but a very quick remedy.\n", "Q: KWin's wobbly windows do not work any more since I tried `i915_rc6_enable=1` I recently tried to boot my Kubuntu 12.04 LTS on my Sandy Bridge Laptop with i915.i915_enable_rc6=1, i915.i915_enable_fbc=1 and i915.lvds_downclock=1. I had some issues with 3D performance where somebody suggested using those options.\nSince the resolution was not set correctly, I just tried it again with i915.i915_enable_rc6=1, i915.i915_enable_fbc=1.

There is no need to update them (Very different than ATI or Nvidia for example). Ubuntu always comes with the latest Intel driver when it comes out and it also updates the Intel drivers with the most updated Open Source version available.\nIntel is one of the many companies that work a lot in the Open Source world and delivers very good, stable drivers. They also do many updates every year for old and new video cards. Just in case you have any doubts, Ubuntu updates it's Intel video drivers to any still supported version of Ubuntu, that means that your 12.04 will have the latest open source Intel drivers.\n", "Q: Can't open a port I need to run an app on my computer which connects to local port 49100.

And my app cannot connect to local debugger therefore. I ran:\nsudo netstat -anltp | grep \"49100\"\n\nit returns nothing.\n\nA: Generally, firewalls don't block local traffic. If your client application connects to port 49100, it expects to find a service (whatever that is) there. So, you need to start the server application (whatever that is) that listens on port 49100 and provides with the service that the client application is expecting to find there.\n49100 is not a port associated with a well known service, it is not registered as such at IANA (the organisation that assigns numbers on the internet), so we probably won't able to tell you more unless you tell us what that application is.

Sorry for such a Newbie Question, but I'm looking at installing M3 edition of MapR the requirements are at this link:\nhttp://www.mapr.com/doc/display/MapR/Requirements+for+Installation\nAnd my question is this, is the Desktop Kernel 64 for 12.04 LTS adequate or the \"same\" as the Server version of the product?  If I'm setting up a lab to attempt to install a home cluster environment should I start with the Server or Dual Boot that distribution?\nMy assumption is that the two are the same.  That I can add any additional software to the 64 as needed.\nCan anyone elaborate on this?  Have I missed something obvious?\n\nA: Last I recall, Ubuntu desktop and Ubuntu server are, at their core, the same. The only major differences lie in the installer (server edition is a low-graphics/text installer with the option to install packages common to servers, such as Apache, PHP, and MySQL for a web server; while desktop is a graphical installer aimed at typical users), and the desktop stack or lack thereof (server is what's known as a \"headless\" install, meaning it doesn't come with a desktop stack and can only be accessed through command line; desktop, of course, comes with Gnome/Unity). This equivalence also extends to the repositories - both desktop and server edition have access to the same repositories, and anything that works for Ubuntu desktop will work for Ubuntu server (save for GUI applications, which will need the proper libraries and whatnot, but they still work, provided you install the libraries).\nFor server setups of any sort, it's recommended to run the server version, because the desktop stack takes up a fair chunk of resources that are better left for the tasks the server is designed to do. A full headless system, though, requires you to be comfortable with command line. However, if you really want a graphical interface to work with, I still recommend starting with the server edition, then install a lightweight desktop stack, such as OpenBox or XFCE. That way, you're using as few resources as necessary for the convenience of having a desktop, and you only install on an as-needed basis, instead of starting with a bunch of unneeded stuff that you then have to try to rip out (it's easier to build up than tear down in this case).\n", "Q: How do I lock the screen before hibernating? So when i hibernate my laptop the screen doesn't lock automatically.\nTo solve this i've changed /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh to contain:\nsu - myUsername -c \"gnome-screensaver-command -l\"\nsudo pm-hibernate\nexit 0\n\nWhen running this file from a command line it works as intended (ie, lock the screen and then hibernate).\nUnfortunately, when pressing the power button, it still just hibernates without locking the screen -what am I missing?\nEDIT: I've added the line whoami>>~/Desktop/test.txt to verify which user is executing the /etc/acpi/powerbtn.shscript. When pressing the power button, the file test.txt is created, but is empty. \nFrom this i conclude that the script is in fact being called when pressing the power button. What i do not understand is how the output of whoami can be empty...\n\nA: I suppose gnome-screensaver-command needs to know the DISPLAY variable you are using. Since (in theory) multiple users can be logged in on one computer (also graphically), it needs to know whose display(s) to lock. The first one is \":0\".

What can I do? The Ubuntu 12.04 I have installed (in Dual-Boot with Windows 7) using WUBI worked perfectly for over a month. Then it informed me that I ran out of space on the hard drive and I assumed it was because my hard drive on Windows was full. I logged into Windows and deleted the whole New Volume D.\nBut now the problem is that it is not possible to log into Ubuntu but in Windows it's possible. I really paid attention about not deleting important files in Windows.\nWhen i try to log into Ubuntu :\n_either it does not go far and i have to restart the computer\n_or it goes until the loading time and a message says something like \"[...] Graphics could not be detected [...]\" and they ask to choose between 4 options including \"Start with poor Graphics\", \"Reconfigure Graphics\", \"Troubleshoot\" and \"Restart the computer\". But none of the options run and i also have to restart the computer manually from that point\nI have plenty of useful files in Ubuntu so i want to find another way to solve the problem instead of Uninstall/Reinstall Ubuntu.\nI want to know what happened ? And how to make it work ?\n\nThank you,\nbcbc: Wubi was not installed on D: for sure.\nXtremesupremacy3: just before the problem occured, Ubuntu was saying there was no disk space left (so now I cannot reinstall the grahics driver due to lack of space), I logged in to Windows and deleted all the folders from New Volume D:\nAfter that Ubuntu started having problems loading and the \"Running in low graphics mode\" screen appears every time. \nI am trying to update the graphic card driver but I do not seem to be able to install anything due to the lack of storage space. How can I delete files but not all of them to clear up just enough space to get the graphic card driver so I get move on from there?\nThank you in advanc \n\nA: Well firstly lets start by addressing the original reason why this happened.\nWubi is often mistakenly seen as installing a Linux partition. In actual fact, a file gets created within Windows (and inside the Windows partition) which acts like an Ubuntu partition. You can view it like being a virtual partition like on VirtualBox for instance.\nThe reason I tell you this is that if that file has become damaged within the Windows environment it will cause problems with Ubuntu.\nHowever, if that was completely untouched and it's purely graphical, then there is a chance that Xorg (graphics in Linux) has to be reconfigured.\nUsually this is done by hitting Cntrl+Alt+F2 and typing in 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-org' at the prompt. Although I have a feeling this might not work with the error appearing.\nJust out of curiousity, can you remember exactly what you did or were trying to do inside Windows just before the problem occured?\n", "Q: Lightest weight ubuntu desktop for text editing in big terminal windows? I have an older windows laptop onto which I'm installing ubuntu within a VM.  My goal is just to use terminal-based linux tools such as vim and shell scripting.  I don't give a hoot about any gui for this box.\nSo I first installed ubuntu minimalcd and chose \"Basic Ubuntu Server\".  Upon boot, the text-based terminal came up and I logged in, but the problem is it only gives me 80 columns.  I want to do terminal mode vim but have a couple hundred columns to take advantage of my large monitor.  If you happen to know how to do that, please see my question here .  \nThis post is assuming that the other question is not answerable, and that I will need a desktop to get more than 80 columns in a terminal window.  So if that is the case, I want the lightest weight one possible, because this is older hardware and all I want is the ability to have nice big text-based terminal windows for editing text.  From the ubuntu minimal CD, I see options for Edubuntu, Kubuntu, etc.  Which one of the available desktops would be a good choice for my needs?\n\nA: Edubuntu is just Ubuntu really, and Kubuntu runs the KDE environment, all of those are not lightweight.\nIf you are going for a desktop then you might be more interested in something like lubuntu or Xubuntu. Out of those I would think that Xubuntu is the lightest, although I'm not totally sure on that. Either way, both of those are extremely light-weight and designed for older hardware\n\nA: For your needs I suggest you to have Lubuntu which needs a 256MB of RAM to work as i know. If you would like to have total Lubuntu stuff then you can use \nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-destop\n\nIf you don't want any Lubuntu stuff then , type this in your terminal  \nsudo apt-get install lxde\n\n\nA: If you're looking for really light weight, then just skip a desktop environment altogether. You can just install Xorg and a terminal emulator such as terminator or even xterm. You don't need a display manager or even a window manager for your purposes. You can launch the emulator from X's startup script. Then, login and run startx.\nIf gou want a bit more look into one of the very many lightweight window managers. I used to use IceWm a long time ago, but there are lots of options to choose from.\n\nA: XFCE might be what you are looking for.  If you want to try it out, here is the command to install it:\nsudo apt-get install xfce4\n\nOnce you complete that, logout.  On your next login, click on the white Ubuntu icon.\n\nYou should then see a menu that allows you to pick which desktop you wish to use.\n\nClick on \"Xfce\", and then continue entering your password.\n\nA: How about skipping X altogether and staying with a CLI or server install only using vim (or my favorite text editor - emacs) as your \"desktop\".\n\nA: Try using I3. It's a little difficult to use, but it's text-based, and incredibly light.\n\nA: you gan go extreme , by installing just the plain debian os (aprrox 300mB iso)\nand install a terminal(or use the inbuilt) and your required tools using apt(preinstalled in debian_os)\nyou can install xfce4 or gnome (or anything you want) on debian , just like ubuntu using the mighty apt\nthe installer asks if you want to download and install a desktop_environment or not,,, just skip that part , and you r good to go\n", "Q: Is the Alternate Ubuntu installer still required for LVM or Software RAID setup? Over the past 5 years, I have been setting up Ubuntu servers using the Alternate installer. I need to provision a new server today, and I'm curious if the Alternate CD is still the only way to setup LVM/RAID at installation time. I'm my limited experience with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, I noticed it's single installer configures LVM automatically. Has Ubuntu's installer, at least the standard \"Server\" installer, added support for LVM/RAID, or is the Alternate installer still required for that kind of server setup?\nhttp://mirror.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/DVDs/ubuntu/12.04.1/release/\n\nAlternate install CD\nThe alternate install CD allows you to perform certain specialist\n  installations of Ubuntu. It provides for the following situations:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*setting up automated deployments;\n  \n*upgrading from older installations without network access;\n  \n*LVM and/or RAID partitioning;\n  \n*installs on systems with less than about 384MiB of RAM (although note that\n  low-memory systems may not be able to run a full desktop environment\n  reasonably).\n  \n\nLVM has always been fundamental for our server needs, so I'm surprised if it is still not considered a server-worthy feature.\n\nA: The Ubuntu Server image has LVM and RAID, I think since 9.10. Go for the manual option at partitioning, you'll find it there.\nIf you want to have an Ubuntu Desktop on RAID/LVM, then you still need the Alternate image\n", "Q: How to change grub-bios to grub-efi So a while ago I installed Ubuntu on my MacBook. I had to reinstall it because something in the update manager messed up. Not to concerned about that but for some reason after the installation Ubuntu won't boot.\nI found out later that Apple hardware uses EFI as its firmware (BIOS is the wrong term). Every time I try to install it I make a swap space and the root file to make the installation. I noticed that when I make the boot file its in grub-bios. I need to change this to grub-efi. I found out but there is no option to change this. It still won't boot though. When I install it I don't get any errors but doing a little bit of reasearch I find that the boot file may be the problem. \nHow to fix this?\n\nA: Using apt-get or GUI tools to install the grub-efi package should cause the package system to replace grub-pc (the BIOS/legacy GRUB) with the EFI-mode GRUB. Beyond that, it's not clear to me what you mean by several comments in your question:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"When i install it i dont get any errors\" (what do you mean by \"it\"? The grub-efi package?)\n\n*\"It still wont boot though\" (what won't boot, GRUB, Linux, OS X, or something else? What sort of error conditions do you get -- a blank screen, an error message, a boot logo that never disappears, etc.?)\n\n*\"The boot file may be the problem\" (to what \"boot file\" are you referring?)\n\n\nStepping back a bit, the most popular dual-boot configuration for Ubuntu and OS X uses rEFIt as a boot manager to select which OS to boot along with the BIOS version of GRUB to launch Linux. Substituting the EFI version of GRUB is desirable, IMHO. Even better, at least with 3.3.0 and later kernels (included in Ubuntu 12.10), is to use the kernel's own EFI stub loader. This can be facilitated by use of rEFInd as a boot manager. rEFInd is a fork of rEFIt (which hasn't been updated in over two years); rEFInd fixes bugs and adds new features, particularly related to booting Linux. The rEFInd Web page includes detailed documentation on using it to boot Linux. You can use it much like rEFIt (to chainload either the BIOS-mode or EFI-mode GRUB) or you can use it to launch a Linux kernel with EFI stub loader support, thus bypassing GRUB.\n", "Q: Permission denied for some files, even with sudo and chmod 777 I've had multiple times that I wasn't allowed to edit a file. Even when I chmoded to 777 and opend the file with sudo. E.g. the file /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch in\nthis tutorial.\nFirst, how is this possible? Second, how can I get access to this sort of files?\n\nA: It is not enough to have read permission on a file in order to read it. You also need to have read permission on the directory it belongs to. In the case of /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch the problem is /sys/kernel/debug which, by default, is readable only by root:\n$ ls -ld /sys/kernel/debug\ndrwx------ 22 root root 0 Nov 20 18:25 /sys/kernel/debug\n\nYou need to chmod a+r /sys/kernel/debug to have access to the contents of that directory.\n(I would not recommend it, since giving global access to /sys/kernel/debug is not a safe thing to do, but this is a different problem.)\nThe most common way to access such files is to use a root shell:\nsudo -i\n\n", "Q: How does one use Ubuntu for Android? I have heard a lot about this new Ubuntu For Android but how can the average man download and install this neat new feature!!\nThanks\n\nA: There is a difference between Ubuntu for Android and using Ubuntu on android. Ubuntu through a loop file using chroot and (maybe) VNC is running Ubuntu (for ARM, technically). The Ubuntu for Android that I linked to is an addition to android that is something different - they may use a similar technique, but I don't think so, as from their description it sounds more native than that, and only runs through a secondary display (as many higher end phones have some kind of hdmi capability these days). In any case, near as I can tell, it is provided for phone manufacturers only at this point as something to include with their devices, and not something for the average joe (yet... I hope that will change).\n\nA: A little research before posting never hurts... Nevermind, here is a link for a (probably unofficial) tutorial on how to do it : Ubuntu for Android. Now I don't know if this is legal or correct or moral, you just be careful.\nEDIT : Also, here is a complete post explaining in detail WHAT it is, because you don't sound as if you really know what it is. Also, as a direct quote of the article it is said that :\n\n\"The first and most obvious problem is that Linux is a desktop OS, definitely not something meant for touch screens. Tap menu and change the control scheme to touch pad, which makes the touch screen function as a basic mouse. The controls are by no means perfect, but they work.\nTo be honest, this hack works best on tablets. We really struggled to use Linux on our microscopically small phone screen. Even with an easy zoom function, Ubuntu is not easy to use. Side note: To input text, hold down the menu key. That brings up a virtual keyboard. However, we could easily see someone using a physical keyboard and a tablet with this hack in order to make a facsimile desktop PC.\nFinal Thoughts\nUbuntu on Android is certainly not the friendliest of OSes (even by Linux standards), but it is pretty damn neat. Not to mention that all the things normally restricted on mobile devices (like Hulu, The Daily Show and Spotify) are now fair game. No doubt hardcore geeks will find some creative uses for this hack.\"\n\n\nA: I don’t think this is possible for the average man yet, and it would ruin your warranty if you success.

Hope that helps!\nDirect quote from the link :\n\nAnd then I found Syncness. It doesn't require a PC client as it connects straight to network shares over your WiFi.

It costs about £1, but is well worth it.\nPut some music in a dir on your PC, and share it: R click > Sharing Options (then it might ask you for permissions to install some sharing libs). Now open Syncness on your phone and create a new profile and give it a name e.g. Music. Click the \"Share\" folder icon, and let it scan your network for shares, and then select your share from the list. Next click the \"Local\" folder icon and select your Music dir (if you don't already have one, you may need to connect your phone to your PC and create it first). Set \"Sync Type\" to \"Push To / Pull From Remote\", check \"Active\" (so it appears in your \"Active profiles\" list), and also check \"Allow file deletions\", so it can wipe old music you don't want any more.

Hi. I've got a working Ubuntu 12.04 server, which is going to serve as media server. I've added two disks of size 3TB to put my data on, and I wish to combine these as one 6TB logical volume which I could mount under /media.\nSo far, I have created one partition on each disks with fdisk and formatted them to ext3. But now I am stuck on how to continue. Do I use Mdadm to create a Jbod array? Or do I use LVM to make a logical volume of these two disks? I can't seem to find the documentation I need, it's mostly about extending existing volumes or installing a fresh system which I don't need.\nMy OS is on /dev/sdc1 (it's a USB thumb-drive), and the two newly created partitions are on /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1.\nHope you can give me some directions.\n\nA: Don't do it, unless you've got another 2 3TB disks to use in a 4-disk array in RAID10.\nSimply combining the two as a single large partition without any means of back-up of the data, is not a good idea. The data will be interleaved across both disks, and if any part of either disk goes bad, you could end up losing all 6TB of data (assuming you had that much data), rather than only half at most.\nIt'll be much safer to use both as separate partitions, rather than a very large array partition.\n\nA: One easy way to use LVM is :\n\n\n*\n\n*create physical volumes with the \"pvcreate\" command:\n\n\n*\n\n*pvcreate /dev/sdc\n\n*pvcreate /dev/sdd\n\n*pvcreate /dev/sde\n\n*...\n\n\n*use system-config-lvm which is a GUI tool available in the Ubuntu Software Center\nthe new LVM partition might be owned by root but it's easy to set it back to your user with:\nsudo chown -R username:username /path/to/your/lvm\n\n\nA: You should have a look at this detailed answer.\nHere's a summary of it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a physical volume on the first hard drive, and another physical volume on the second hard drive.\n\n*Create a new volume group, assigning both physical volumes to it.\n\n*Create a new logical volume in that volume group.\n\n*Create a new ext3 filesystem in that logical volume.\n\n\nThe diagram I copied from this answer visualises this (but with three filesystems, rather than just one):\n\nAs you can see, creating an ext3 filesystem is the last step, not the first. If you have an existing ext3 partition that isn't in LVM, you can't migrate it to LVM. You'll have to backup the partition, delete the partition, setup LVM, and then copy the files back.\n\nA: On Debian, using lvm2:\n\n*\n\n*Install lvm2 using sudo apt install lvm2 and start it using /etc/init.d/lvm2 start\n\n\n*List all the volumes using lsblk\n\n\n*Create physical volumes\n /sbin/pvcreate <volume from prev list>\n\n\n\n*Then to list the volumes use /sbin/lvmdiskscan\n\n\n*Create a volume group (vg) /sbin/vgcreate <name> /dev/vdb\n\n\n*Format the volume group /sbin/mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/Vol_group\n\n\n*Change fstab if you want to map this vg to some filesystem\n /dev/mapper/vg /var/lib/folder ext4 rw,user \n\n\n\n*Mount the volume using mount -a\n", "Q: gtk2 menus are slow My PC runs ubuntu 12.04 with gnome-shell.

All you need to do is format the flash drive using the FAT32 file system (it is compatible with all systems and so will always work) and then use UNETBOOTIN or a similar utility to place the iso file onto the flash drive. Also, if you're running Mountain Lion on an Intel processor, then you should be able to use the 64-bit version of Ubuntu (link takes you to download page), which should give you some small performance increases. Then just boot from the flash drive in your BIOS boot menu and from there the live USB session should guide you through trying and/or installing Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Messaging menu turn blue for no reason I expect the \"envelope\" from the messaging menu to turn blue only where there is a pending notification (like a new mail or a new IM message).

I'm just wondering if I'll lose my files if I do that. I had Ubuntu, loved it, got a new laptop, and should've installed Ubuntu then but didn't. I don't have any external storage media currently available to me, but if I can install Ubuntu without losing my files I'll go ahead and do that.\nHelp would be greatly appreciated!\nThanks!\n\nA: First of all, Try Ubuntu with a liveCD or liveUSB. To see if it works with your laptop. because sometimes you may end up with a black screen.\nSecond thing, Try to back up your data. I know you don't have any external storage. But try to find one. To tell you the truth I don't back up my data. Even when I installed Ubuntu for the first time. Because the installation process is really simple. all you have to do is to click on \"Install alongside windows\" option and it will automatically adjust it for you. \nNow, if you want to select the \"advanced option\". At that time you should really consider backing up your data. \n\nA: Are you using a CD or are you installing from wubi.exe by copying the files over from the .iso / disc image onto a folder? \nI was able to just run wubi.exe while Windows 7 was still running by taking all the install files off of the disc image. It made a .disk file in my Windows folder, set up a boot option and restarted perfectly. All my Windows files were perfectly fine.\nI don't know what to add for someone using a CD though.\n\nA: There are two options that I would recommend:\nYou can install Ubuntu through WUBI -\n\nInstall the installer with the CD in Windows(wubi.exe) then finish the\n  installation with a reboot(leaving the CD in the tray) \nThis allows you to install Ubuntu to where it is easily uninstalled in windows. This also\n  has the lowest risk of you losing your data.\n\nYou can install alongside Windows -\n\nBoot from Live CD/USB. When installing, click the option \"Install alongside Windows\". This should not install over your existing data and prevents a low risk of losing your data\n\nHow to later retrieve your files:\nWUBI:\nIn File Browser, goto /host/\nAlongside Windows: The partition should show up in the side of the file browser. e.g. Mine says \"Acer\"\n\nA: Easiest method is wubi ubuntu.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer Just click \"Get the installer\" and it should start downloading. After you download, save; it asks you you enter username, password, and then tells you to restart the computer. Once you restart, ubuntu automatically starts. Then, shut down the computer and when you start it, there are two options: windows, AND ubuntu. You are ready to go. This is the method that I followed and successfully downloaded ubuntu. \nIt's a great thing as you have windows and you have ubuntu (without altering anything in your windows).   \n", "Q: Overscan, Ubuntu 12.04, Nvidia driver I know there are many questions about overscan around but I cant seem to find a working solution.

Modern drives are SMART and are capable of reporting errors and remapping any sectors that are bad to a spare pool.  The drive can only remap sectors when you try to write to them though.  If the disk utility reports that the drive has a few pending reallocations, then you can force them to happen by writing zeros to the whole disk:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda\n\nAfter that, there should be no more pending sectors.  If the sectors were physically damaged, the count of reallocated sectors will go up.  If the data had simply been scrambled, writing zeros to the media corrected it without the need to reallocate the sector.\nIf you end up with any sectors that are still pending or offline_uncorrectable, or more than a few reallocated sectors, you need to replace the drive.\n\nA: Well the manpage for e2fsck (the application getting called by the fsck wrapper if its an ext2/3/4 filesystem) states the following\nNote that the block numbers are based on  the  blocksize  of  the  filesystem.\nHence,  badblocks(8) must be given the blocksize of the filesys‐\ntem in order to obtain correct results.  As a result, it is much\nsimpler  and safer to use the -c option to e2fsck, since it will\nassure that the correct parameters are passed to  the  badblocks\nprogram.\n\nSo just use\nsudo e2fsck -c /dev/sda5\n\n", "Q: Need help running Ubuntu Minimal with e17 Recently I have decided to opt for an optimized system for myself.

How could I completely separate desktop environments from each other? For example if I install Cinnamon and MATE, both desktop environments' applications show in the main menu, and the launchers list them too, even if they are useless in the actual DE.\nSo in the end everything just messes up when there are more than one DE installed.\nIs there any method to separate them more?\n\nA: You can do it the «hard way».\n1.- Open your DE. For instance, Cinnamon.\n2.- Check every installed application in the menu and write down those you don't want to appear.\n3.- Open your File Manager (Nautilus or Nemo)\n4.- Go to /usr/share/applications (also check .local/share/applications in your home folder) and identify the file name of the applications you don't want to appear under your present DE\n5.- Open a terminal and type\ncd /usr/share/applications\n6.- For each application, type\nsudo nano [nameoftheprogram].desktop\nFor instance:\nsudo nano yelp.desktop\n7.- Find this line\nOnlyShowIn=\nand delete the DE you don't want. If there isn't this line, add it and add also the DE.\n\n8.- Repeat steps 6, 7 and 8 for each program.\nN.B. This how-to will only help you with the mixing of programs in the menu.\n\nA: No, there isn't any practical way of separating these desktop environments, but why would you want to do that anyway? Deleting a DE would remove all the contents, for example I recently installed KDE Plasma Workspace and didn't like it (screwed up my system), to find my GNOME was full of KDE deafult apps. It's hard enough to remove the whole DE, but if you manage to remove it all, that's the only to remove it.\n\nA: One idea is to dual boot two copies of Linux: one set-up to use one desktop environment, and the other set-up to use another.\nBy dual-booting, you mostly isolate the systems. They could even be different operating systems. For example, you could install Lubuntu and Linux Mint.\nIf you keep /home in a separate partition, you can access this partition from both systems, whether or not you choose to share it.\n", "Q: How to see photos shared in a folder in a sequence Someone shared a folder with dozens of photos with me.

Click on Custom Shortcuts and then click on the + (plus) symbol. Give the shortcut a name and in the command section add \nxset dpms force off\n\nThis command switches the LCD off until you move the mouse or press a key, just like when the laptop is left idle. \nNow here is the bit that may or may not work: Click on your new shortcut where it says Disabled and press your key combination FN + F7. Hopefully it will recognise the combination and FN + F7 will now execute the command to switch the LCD off.\n", "Q: Force wget to use actual Google Docs file I am programming in batch it shouldn't matter because i am using wget on Windows too.\nI found similar question on this site Force wget to use actual filename first solution works for everyone  but why it doesn't working for me  ?

I have a dual monitor setup on my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS: \n\n\n*\n\n*the primary screen of my notebook Toshiba Tecra R850-11D\n\n*my external monitor Samsung SyncMaster P2470HD\nThe external monitor has a much better image quality, since it uses its own ICC Profile (Default, SyncMaster), but the screen of my notebook doesn't use any ICC Profile. \n\nWhat should I do and where could I get the appropriate ICC Profile for my Toshiba notebook in order to gain a much better quality of colors of my desktop environment?\n\nA: You can generate it yourself if you're willing to spend a bit of money and get a colorimeter.  Amazingly, there's one that's not only compatible with Linux, it's built for Linux!\nColorHug\nUse it with the colorhug-client package available in the repos.\nThis is really the best way as the colour profile is generated based on your own individual screen and even compensates for room lighting.\nOtherwise, as you've seen if you do a Google search, colour profiles for something very specific are very hard to find and often don't exist.\n\nA: The simplest way to adjust colours is to create a script file that is auto-started when Ubuntu starts. Add the file to desktop, so you have manual access to it at all times.\nThe contents of the script should be 1 line:\n\"xgamma -rgamma 1.00 -ggamma 1.00 -bgamma 1.00\"\nyou adjust the numbers up or down to suit your taste.\nexample:\n \"xgamma -rgamma 1.10 -ggamma 0.90 -bgamma 0.60\"\nthe terminal command is \"xgamma\".  you can add the \"--h\" option to read the help file.\n", "Q: How to uninstall manually installed Nvidia drivers? How do I uninstall manually installed Nvidia drivers 310.14  and revert to Noveau.  I have Ubuntu 12.10.  \n\nA: Yeap, was going to say what Karasu said. Just to add some information. If the driver you downloaded is called for example NVIDIA-Linux-x86-310.19.run then you would run:\nsudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-310.19.run --uninstall\n\nIf you want to get the help for your Nvidia driver then do this:\nNVIDIA-Linux-x86-310.19.run --help or a more extended version for it:\nNVIDIA-Linux-x86-310.19.run -A which shows you the uninstallation option:\n--uninstall\n  Uninstall the currently installed NVIDIA driver.\n\nThere are a couple of other nice options in case you want to use them like:\n-a - Accept License\n-s - Silent Mode\n-q - no questions\n-i - Driver information\n--update - Check Nvidia site and update to the latest\nFor cases where you use the CUDA installer, in the documentation for it you can find more options on how to uninstall it, like this excerpt:\nTo uninstall the CUDA Toolkit, run the uninstallation script provided in the bin directory of the toolkit. By default, it is located in /usr/local/cuda-11.0/bin:\nsudo /usr/local/cuda-11.0/bin/cuda-uninstaller\nTo uninstall the NVIDIA Driver, run nvidia-uninstall:\nsudo /usr/bin/nvidia-uninstall\nAnd others that can be seen when you run the --help parameter\n\n\nA: First you need the installation file. Then put it in your home folder, open a terminal and type\nsudo ~/installation_file.run --uninstall`\n\nThen restart your computer and your drivers will be completely uninstalled. If Unity don't load after the uninstallation, right click --> change desktop background, then click on \"All Settings\" on the left-top corner of the window. Then go to Software sources and install a proprietary driver from the list.\n", "Q: How to upgrade Firefox on several computers on the network I have about 10 computers on my LAN and I would like to upgrade the Firefox on the computers across the LAN. The computers are not connected to the internet. I can download the tar files from the internet but it's almost impossible to go from system to system to install. Is their a way I can upgrade from the server?\n\nA: First of all, not tar files, but debian packages.\nI see following solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If one of the computers is connected to the Internet, you can use it as a local cache and point the package managers (apt) from other computers on the LAN to that machine\n\n*If there is no other way than to install manually, use pssh or another parallel SSH solution (see here). In essence, you connect to all computers using SSH, type a command, and the command gets executed on all machines.\n\n*actually, it can be even achieved with a simple script if you can log in as root and using key-based authentication (this is not recommended in general, but could be OK on a LAN not connected to the Internet)\nfor host in `cat hosts_to_update` ; do\n     scp install_script.sh tar_file_blah.tar.gz root@$host\n     ssh root@$host install_script.sh\ndone\n\nAll of that will require some initial setting up, but afterwords you will be able to run the updates more smoothly.\n", "Q: What folder structures are changed when doing a version upgrade When upgrading from a LiveCD / LiveDVD / LiveUSB from any older Ubuntu version to a newer one, what folders get deleted/modified/kept intact. For example, I know that /home stays along with everything in it (Except configuration files that get updated). But for example what happens to the following folder in an upgrade:\n/var \n/etc \n/usr\nand others\n\nA: For modified configuration files in /etc, the installer will ask whether to keep to original or override it.\nAs for the other folders, an upgrade basically consists of upgrading a lot of packages. File contained by packages are upgraded or removed if they are no longer required.\nFiles that are created by you and not contained by a package are generally untouched. For example, a common place to store apache 'website' files is in /var/www. These are not removed in an upgrade as far as I know.\nNevertheless, I would recommend to backup important files before an upgrade\n", "Q: Can anyone tell me why Gnome 3 looks like as if it were a gnome fallback session in my virtualbox? For some reason Gnome 3 wont work in my virtualbox. Both gnome classic and gnome look exactly identical.\nThe version of my virtualbox is: 4.1.2_ Ubuntu r38459\nThe 3D acceleration is on in the virtualbox and the Guest Additions is installed in the virtualbox from the software center.\nObviously, the graphic card driver is installed on the main Ubuntu system I am using with my laptop. (although the post-release updates can't be installed for whatever reason)\nGnome shell is installed from the software center in the virtualbox.\nNow the issue is that the gnome and gnome classic look like just the same.\nHere is an image of what gnome looks like (so does gnome classic too....so I am only posting one image):\n\nWhat causes this issue?\nBy the way....I am using Ubuntu 11.10 with gnome fallback session. \nNOTE: I have been asked to use the ~$ gnome-shell --replace command.\nIt basically made the fallback mode into the desired Gnome 3 desktop environment till the next restart, but that's it.\nI got this message in the terminal though:\n~$ gnome-shell --replace\nWindow manager warning: Log level 16: Unable to register authentication agent: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1.Error.Failed: An authentication agent already exists for the given subject\nWindow manager warning: Log level 16: Error registering polkit authentication agent: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1.Error.Failed: An authentication agent already exists for the given subject (polkit-error-quark 0)\n\n(gnome-shell:1860): folks-WARNING **: Failed to find primary PersonaStore with type ID 'eds' and ID 'system'.\nIndividuals will not be linked properly and creating new links between Personas will not work.\nThe configured primary PersonaStore's backend may not be installed. If you are unsure, check with your distribution.\n\nUPDATE: this is the image of the additional drivers. As you can see one can't be installed and this is why it's not active.\n\n\nA: This sounds like a graphical error. Running gnome-shell on a machine (in this case virtualbox) that doesnt meet the requirements will fall back on the classic/fallback session.\nTry:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a terminal ( Ctrl+Alt+T )\n\n*replacing the current session with the shell ( gnome-shell --replace )\n\n\nThis will try replace fallback session with the shell, if it fails at least you will be able to see why because the errors will be output in the terminal.\nUpdating the question with any errors will help us to help you.\nUPDATE: Workaround...\nI believe that gnome-shell is failing an accelerated hardware check which takes place when the session is loaded. A workaround would be to load the gnome-shell when you log into the gnome-classic session.\nYou can do this by creating a file called gnome-shell.desktop, save it to ~/.config/autostart/\nInside it put the following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=gnome-shell --replace\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName[en]=Gnome Shell Startup\nName=Gnome Shell Startup\nComment[en]=\nComment=\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME\nAutostartCondition=GNOME3 if-session gnome-classic\n\nThere is a difference between gnome-classic and gnome-fallback (classic loads with some effects), if you don't have classic installed change gnome-classic on the last line to gnome-fallback\nyou will know if its installed if you have 2 Gnome Classic options in your session menu - one will have \"(no effects)\" written next to it\n", "Q: Is there any difference between LiveCD Upgrade and Update Manage Upgrade Are there any differences between an upgrade from a LiveCD or the software options in the system like Update Manager?\nJust to make sure that when a user updates from a LiveCD, he/she gets the same as doing it via Update Manager included in the system.\n\nA: \nIs there any difference between LiveCD Upgrade and Update Manage\n  Upgrade?\n\nYes,When you upgrade from update manager all the apps including third party apps will be upgraded, If you upgraded using live cd, most of the additionally installed packages will  be removed, you have to install all the packages again \n", "Q: How can I change the icons of window button? How can I change the icons of window button? Is it possible?\n\n\nA: This will involve changing your theme.

At least the most information I got from here:\nhttp://tech-devnet.blogspot.de/2012/05/running-ubuntu-1204-on-mac.html\nWhat I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*installing rEFIt, which is pretty easy. I had the problem that rEFIT didn't start without pressing [alt] while booting, but the solution is the manual install which is easy and described in the rEFIt documentation.\n\n*create a free partition using bootcamp (on snow leopard)\n\n*boot an ubuntu dvd. You can do that pressing [C] while booting.\n\n*install ubuntu.\nProbably I wouldn't have had so much trouble when I skipped the bootcamp part and just let ubuntu split the thing automatically (it seems like ubuntu can do this, i didn't try).\nBut I have to warn people. On my macbook6.1, about 4 Years old, I can use macOS 4 hours and more, but ubuntu only 2 hours until the battery is empty. Even with using powertop, jupiter etc. Many power saving tutorials do not work anymore because they are too old.\nTo improve Battery life try things like proprietary GPU drivers, laptop-tools-mode and so on.

I would like to make use of Btrfs' transparent compression on an external drive. \n\n\n*\n\n*Which tool is best for formatting the drive? Disk Utility or GParted? \n\n*How do I activate the compression? During formatting or when I mount the drive? I guess at mount time. I'm using usbmount to automatically mount newly attached devices, because nobody is logged in on the desktop. Would I have to set general default options somewhere in a system configuration file to get Btrfs mounted with compression, or would I specify this via FS_MOUNTOPTIONS in /etc/usbmount/usbmount.conf and how? \n\n\nThanks! \n\nA: Format and enable LZO\nI would avoid using any GUI to format;-)\nmkfs.btrfs device is good enough, depending on how you would like to make use of Btrfs features:\n\n\n*\n\n*use the external USB HDD as 1 single partition/block device\n\n*create 2 partitions (2 block devices) and form a raid1 or raid0 for data (-d), metadata is replicated on all devices by default, unless you manually specify to change\n\n\nYou can make use of the compression by adding the option when mounting, for example:\nsudo mount -o compress=lzo /dev/sdd /mnt/btrfs\n\nThe good thing about Btrfs is that LZO compression can also be enabled on a subvol basis, very flexible;-) For example\n/* Create a subvolume named subvol1 */\n\n# btrfs subvolume create /mnt/btrfs/subvol1\n\n/* Mount the subvolume and enable compression */\n\n# mount -o compress=lzo,subvol=subvol1 /dev/sdd /mnt/subvol1\n\nNOTE: You can add compression to existing Btrfs file systems at any time, just add the option when mounting and do a defragment to apply compression to existing data.\nBTW: 2 best Btrfs docs out there:\nhttp://www.funtoo.org/wiki/BTRFS_Fun\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E37355/html/ol_btrfs.html\nMake use of LZO compression:\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/servers-storage-admin/advanced-btrfs-1734952.html\nUSB Auto Mount\nI am not too sure about this, will let other blokes answer it;-)\nI'd prefer to write a simple shell script to do the mount because I won't attach the USB HDD to the computer all the time.\n\nA: As the formatting and enabling LZO compression question is answered already, here is the answer to the Question how to automatically set the compression mount option on automount.\nThis solution also works if you have btrfs on a LUKS-encrypted disk.\nUSB Automount\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the disk and let your automounter mount the filesystem\n\n*Use lsblk -o UUID,MOUNTPOINT to find the UUID of the block device the filesystem is on, e.g. 6e642696-3cb4-4d4e-86a6-2fae2b9295cc\n\n*Add a line to your /etc/fstab referencing the UUID and specifying the additional mount option: \nUUID=6e642696-3cb4-4d4e-86a6-2fae2b9295cc /media/user/backupdrive btrfs noauto,subvol=/,compress=zstd\n\n\n*Unmount and re-mount the drive and check that the options were set using mount\n", "Q: Unable to update Ubuntu 12.10 Once I tried to install Banshee on Ubuntu 12.10 and added that PPA.

I ask because I used wubi, but I'm having trouble with certain things like being unable to change my brightness settings and I'm wondering if installing from a usb drive would change anything. Also, I've tried to do a usb drive install, but it doesn't give me the option to install alongside, it only shows the \"Replace Windows 7\" and \"something else\" options. Is this because I already did a wubi install?\n\nA: A Wubi install is the same as a normal dual boot, except for a few key differences - it uses a virtual disk and it boots differently. Brightness settings will not act any differently.\nWhen you install from a CD or USB it does not detect the Wubi install, and it makes no difference to what the installer sees. If it only offers to replace Windows7 it probably means you have used 4 primary partitions already - the maximum on an disk with a MBR partition table. Some computers are shipped with all 4 primary partitions already allocated e.g. HP computers. You best option then is to backup the contents and then delete one of these partitions.\nFrom the Wubi install you can go to a terminal and run sudo fdisk -l (that's a lower case -L) and then edit your question with the result. That should show what's going on.\n\nA: The difference between a Wubi install and a Dual boot is that with a dual boot Ubuntu has its own partition while with Wubi the Ubuntu drive is actually a file on Windows.  I doubt that changing from Wubi to dual boot will make any difference to brightness settings however.\nThat said a dual boot is preferable to Wubi for the following reasons\n\n\n*\n\n*Since Wubi uses a virtual file system; Ubuntu drive is actually a file on your Windows NTFS partition. There is additional overhead in file handling so disk access is slower.\n\n*As Wubi installs inside Windows then if Windows dies you have probably lost Ubuntu too.  With dual boot Windows cant break Ubuntu and Ubuntu cant break Windows. \nI would always install Ubuntu separately either on its own machine or dual boot but since you already have it working with Wubi I doubt you would notice any significant improvement by re-installing.\nIf you do decide to reinstall: remove your Wubi Ubuntu first using the control panel in Windows.  This will free up some space ready for the installer to re-partition the drive.  Also make sure you have good backups of both Windows and your personal files in Ubuntu.  It's rare for the install process to go wrong but people have lost everything in the past.  Finally make sure you read every question from the installer carefully.  Ubuntu will happily install side by side with Windows but the same installer will also happily wipe Windows from your machine if you tell it to.  \n", "Q: Searching for printer/scanner canon pixma mp230 (32bit) ubuntu 12.04 drivers and how to install Searching for canon pixma mp230 (32bit) ubuntu 12.04 drivers and how to install.\nFound the drivers on http://www.canon-asia.com/personal/search?languageCode=EN&filter=p&q=mp230%20linux but the install.sh doesn't seem to work.

After that I accidentally ran the code from within geany in a terminal. There were no syntax errors mentioned and the software installed, it asked me to connect the printer and answer some questions.

I've noticed it to be way slower than it was on Windows 7. Is this normal? I'm using the GT 630m. From what I've read online, nobody has said it to be slower than Windows. I'm just really curious because I want to use Linux so much more than Windows, but if I don't get the same performance I feel really picky.\nThe Nvidia card is still faster than my Intel graphics on Ubuntu, but it's not as fast as it was for my on Windows.\nI get 60 - 80 fps on Minecraft on windows, while I get 28 - 48 fps on Ubuntu.\nAny Ideas why? Thanks so much!\n\nA: Yes it is slower. A performance test shows it can be slowe like 1/8th of windows. This is because of the use of virtualgl to generate the images. \nThe only to get full performance is to connect external monitor via hdmi port and run the required application there. This also depends on the wiring of hardware. If your HDMI port is directly connected to nvidia chip, you can do it.\nThis answer was given by the author  of bumblebee (Lekensteyn) in this site. Unfortunately I forgot the link.\nRelated Links:\n\nIs a NVIDIA GeForce with Optimus Technology supported by Ubuntu?\nBumblebee FAQ\n\nA: There is another option that you can try, which is primusrun instead of optirun.

It seems to take awhile without much happening After deploying a charm, either locally or not, juju status lists \"Pending\".  It seems to sit in this state for awhile, longer in my experience in the cloud, a bit shorter locally.  What is juju doing during this time?\nFor local instances it's a couple minutes or less, longer with cloud instances, up to 10 minutes in some cases. I am just curious if deploy's stay pending when the VM is being setup or is something else going on?\n\nA: What you're seeing looks normal to me. \nJuju needs to not only provision the OS, but also install its client, updates, and whatever the charm you're deploying. On top of that it depends on the cloud you're deploying to, and how many resources the instance type has. Up until that happens juju shows Pending. \nWith the local provider the very first time you do this takes the longest, since it needs to download the ~300mb of Ubuntu server image before it can even begin. After that the bundled apt-cacher-ng bits make deployments after that quicker, so a few minutes for local is normal.\nOn Amazon Web Services the images are already in their cloud, and they also have certified mirrors in all their regions, which means it can be relatively quick (LAN speed) updates and installation. Some other providers don't have local Ubuntu mirrors, so it really depends on internet speed on that day, so this time can vary widely. \nEven with fast mirrors there are other factors. If your charm is doing a bunch of stuff, like say, installing an entire Java stack but you're on a relatively small instance (especially t1.micros) this can take longer than on instances that have higher IO available to Ubuntu. \nWhen doing live demos on AWS I usually get ~5 minute deployment times, enough to fire off some instances, then go back to my presentation.\nHere are some things we're doing to make this better:\n\n\n*\n\n*As of Juju .6 we now use cloud images to install instead of a normal ubuntu-server install that has to go through an entire installation and install and configure packages.\n\n*We work closely with cloud providers to ensure that instance boot time is as fast as it can be.\n\n*With the go rewrite this means Juju won't need to install the associated Java dependencies on each instance, which might lead to faster boot times and less memory consumption for instances. (I haven't tested this personally)\n\n*Encouraging charm authors to mention long downloads/installs in their Charm's README when appropriate.\n\n\nUsually getting the instance up and running is relatively quick, you can find out exactly what's going by sshing into the image as soon as you can and checking out the juju log files, you can just tail them and find the culprit; in my experience it's been waiting for things to download and install via apt.\n", "Q: I removed something called Unity webapp integration (I don't remember exactly), and now I don't have Unity, how to revert this?

I'm pretty much unable to do anything.\nHow can I get it back to normal?\n\nA: Probably while uninstalling webapps you unistalled some important component.

This link works for Ubuntu 10 https://launchpad.net/+help-registry/openpgp-keys.html#publish\nHow can I do this in Ubuntu 12.10 because its different in Ubuntu 12.10.\n\nA: Using the command-line to publish your key you can run,\ngpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys yourkeyID\n\nand then you should get the following notification:\ngpg: sending key yourkeyID to hkp server keyserver.ubuntu.com\n\nYou can check it is present on the server by running the command given in this article:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I check if my OpenPGP key is in the Ubuntu keyserver?\nYou can also use the gui program, Seahorse, to manage your keys, which is the 'Passwords and Encryption Keys' program mentioned in the link you quoted, although you might have to install it now.\nA more recent gpg tutorial is available at Ubuntu help, which goes through in some detail how to create, publish, and backup your GPG keys.  \n", "Q: Where is /etc/inittab in Ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhere is the /etc/inittab file or how to set the default runlevel \n\nI have Ubuntu LTS 12.04 32 bit operating system on my laptop.

I wrote the Ubuntu ISO on a CD and restarted my computer, but \"Press Any key To Boot From CD Or DVD ... \" didn't appear! What should I do? Is it because (I guess) the file maybe is corrupted?\nBecause when I see it's propeties windows, It is written 687 Megabytes!!!! (V 12.10)\nThanks\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.10 doesn't fit on a CD. You need a DVD or a USB drive. The iso is around 800 Mb.\nIf your computer can boot from a USB, like all computers less than 6 years old, you can download Unetbootin and create your bootable USB drive.\nTo boot from the USB, on many computers you have to press F12 or some other key to show a boot menu and then you can choose the USB to boot from. Otherwise, go in thr bios setup (by pressing F2 or Esc in most computers), and change the boot order respectively.\nIf you have important files on your disk, make sure you keep a backup of everything.

The old laptop is this Toshiba 1800-100:\nCPU: Intel Celeron 800Mh\nRam 128 MB (works ok)\nHDD: 15 GB (works ok)\nGraphics adapter:\nIntegrated 64-bit AGP graphics accelerator,\nBitBIT, 3D graphic acceleration,\n8 MB Video RAM\n\nOnly WindowsXP is installed, and works ok: it can be used, but it is slow (and hateful).\nI thought that I could improve performance (and its look) easily, since it is an old PC (drivers and everything known for years...) by installing a light Linux distro. So, I decided to install a light or customized Ubuntu distro, or Ubuntu/Debian derivative, but haven't been successful with any; not even booting LiveCDs: not even AntiX, not even Puppy. Lubuntu wiki says that the last two releases it won't work because they need more ram (and some blogs say much more cpu -even core duo for new Lubuntu!-), let alone Xubuntu. But the wikipedia says:\n\"A lightweight Linux distribution is a Linux distribution that uses relatively few resources. For example, Lubuntu, which requires a minimum of 128 MB of RAM and a Pentium II \"\nThe problems I have faced are:\n1.There are thousands of pages talking about the same 10/15 lightweight distros, and saying more or less the same things, but NONE talks about a simple thing as to how should the RAM/swap-partition proportion be for this kind of installations. NONE!\n2.When booting the LiveCDs, I have tried several different boot options (though I don't understand much about them, and there's ALWAYS a line of explanation missing) and never receive error messages. Booting just stops at different stages but often seems to stop just when the X server is going to start. I am also able to boot to command line but startx lives the pc in a state with no return displaying nothing.\n3.I ignore whether the problem is ram size or a problem with the graphics driver (which surprises me because it is a well known brand and line of computers). So I don't know if doing a partition with a swap partition would help booting the LiveCD.\n4.I would like to try the graphical interface with the LiveCD before installing. If doing the swap partition for this purpose would help. How can I do the partition? I tried to use Boot Rescue CD, but it advises me against continuing forward.\nI would appreciate any ideas as regards these questions.\nThank you\n\nA: *\n\n*RAM/Swap proportion is not much different from a high-performance install. Recommended is 1 to 1,5 times your RAM size as swap. A bit more won't hurt, but won't help much either.\n\n*The Live CD is not the recommended way to install on a low performance machine, try the Alternate CD\n\n*and 4.

If you just want to share files between your host and guest setup Virtual Box Shared folders.

I am working on a remote cluster via ssh with the -X option, because I need to visualize data and graphs, over a vpn protocol. Sometime due to the instability of the internet connection I lose my session. They told me I could use vnc in order to not lose my current session, so that if the internet connection drops I can reconnect and continue with my previously open session. \nWhat I do is to log in the remote cluster 'remote.cluster' and type\n vncserver :1\n\nthen I open another terminal on my system and I type\n ssh -C -NL 5901:remote.cluster:5901 myusername@remote.cluster &\n\nThen I start vinagre on my system and I connect using ssh protocol. The problem is that I do not have x11 forwarding and I cannot open windows. If I try to connect using the vnc protocol with vinagre it doesn't connect, because I get something as connection timeout.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: In case we connect to a remote X-Server via VNC we have the advantage that the graphical application will stay running even when the SSH connection to the remote is down. We can then reconnect to resume the graphical application. See also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Differences between VNC and ssh -X\nTo speed up reconnection we may combine the connection to the remote with an SSH session by using vncviewer from tightvncviewer  with the option -via. By this we can run on the remote server:\nvncserver:0  ## or any other display number e.g. :1\n\nto establish a connection on the viewer via an SSH tunnel:\nvncviewer -via user@remote localhost:0\n\nDoing so will need considerably more bandwith because the whole desktop will have to be transmitted from the VNC server. Therefore it may not really be a good idea for low bandwith connections but it may give you a somewhat better experience on high bandwith but unstable connections as compared with X-forwarding.\n\nA: The command used:\nssh -C -NL 5901:localhost:5901 myusername@remote.cluster &\n\nforward local 5901 -> remote.cluster:5901\nSo you can connect to localhost::5901 to connect to the VNC session running on remote.cluster (which you don't have direct access to).\nX11 forwarding is different from VNC. You need to use -X, for example\nssh -X myusername@remote.cluster\n\nThan you will be able to run remote GUI applications on your local machine, provided that you have a X Server running locally (Ubuntu Desktop or Xming on Windows).\nUpdate:\nI made a mistake in the forwarding, it should be:\nssh -C -L 5901:localhost:5901 myusername@remote.cluster\n\nThen you can vnc to localhost:5901, traffic will be forwarded to remote.cluster:5901.

When you run without -e gnome-terminal runs your default shell (which happens to be bash). When you run with -e gnome-terminal runs the command you provided (bash is not loaded so .bashrc is not sourced).\nYour last example will not work either. $HOME is a variable in bash and not available.

As explained in this upstream thread, you can configure Skippy-XD (in ~/.config/skippy-xd/skippy-xd.rc for a particular user, or in /etc/xdg/skippy-xd.rc for all users) so as: \n\n\n*\n\n*To avoid displaying windows from other virtual desktops, set [general] -> showAllDesktops to false. Should work on most EWMH compliant WMs.\n\n*To avoid displaying windows from other Xinerama screens, set [xinerama] -> showAll to false.\n\n*To avoid displaying windows from other, separate X displays, set [general] -> includeAllScreens to false. (But this is a hidden switch and is disabled by default.)\n\n\nSee Something like 'KDE Present Windows' / 'Compiz Scale' / 'Mac OS X exposé' in Openbox / LXDE / Xfce? for some usage and installation details. Basically you can install latest development packages from Skippy-XD PPA (daily). Then you can bind skippy-xd command to Alt + Tab or Alt + Esc or whatever. When set up appropriately, as explained above, Skippy-XD should display only the windows from the current virtual desktop and monitor.\n\nA: To my knowledge Xfce 4.10 (and I assume that this is what you use) has only limited support for additional monitors. \nIn this respect 4.12 will support extended desktop mode for multiple monitors (see design/xfce4-settings/display for details), which hopefully would fix the issues that you're seeing. You can try out the development snapshots from the ppa:xubuntu-dev/xfce-4.12 PPA. \nOr perhaps you simply need to follow the advice in this question: How do I setup dual monitors in XFCE?. Either way, currently there seems to be a limitation in xfwm4 (if this is what you're using), specifically that it cycles through all the windows on current workspace, whether you use one monitor or two.

If you keep on manually referencing the same data it may be hint that you could automate your life more. I keep a git repo with bunch of bash, python and assorted snippets in it.

Since the pattern contains a / it will be matched against the entire path of the file, if it didn't it would be matched against only the base name of the file. Using the <buffer> argument to the map command will apply the mapping only to the current buffer.\nYou can use :help autocmd to get additional information on defining autocmds, including the available events and details of the patterns that are supported.\n\nA: I wanted a single conditional mapping to switch from the view template to the action and back using the Symfony plugin for Vim.

I still see it as unlikely that Wayland will play any significant role in Ubuntu 13.04. Wayland/Weston will continue to be packaged and likely serve for experimenting with the new display technology and maybe some primitive desktop application support (assuming they build out GTK and Qt5 with the Wayland back-end enabled), but I will be very surprised if they push it into any default installation for the Raring Ringtail. \n\nPosted by Michael Larabel on November 01, 2012 on Phoronix.com\n", "Q: Why doesn't Ubuntu have any media codecs? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy aren’t multimedia codecs included by default? \n\nI'm having some doubt regarding media codec's in Ubuntu. \nMy question is why Lubuntu shipped with all the necessary medic codec and at the same time ubuntu/Xubuntu don't have any? \n\nA: Ubuntu's commitment to only include completely free software by default means that proprietary media formats are not configured 'out of the box'. See Ubuntu's Free Software Philosophy and the Free Formats page for a more comprehensive discussion of these issues. \nNotable part from the 1st link:\n\nUbuntu 'main' component licence policy\nAll application software included in the Ubuntu main component:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Must include source code. The main component has a strict and non-negotiable requirement that application software included in it must come with full source code.\n  \n*Must allow modification and distribution of modified copies under the same licence. Just having the source code does not convey the same freedom as having the right to change it. Without the ability to modify software, the Ubuntu community cannot support software, fix bugs, translate it, or improve it.\n  \n\nand from the 2nd link:\n\nWhat is a Free format?\nSome file formats are proprietary, which means that they are owned by a company or other organisation. Sometimes, the owners of such formats charge licensing fees or impose legal restrictions on the use of their formats. This means that people may be unable to use or distribute these formats without first paying a fee or applying for a license.\nA Free or open format is one which can be used by anyone, free of legal restrictions on how they use the format. Free formats are very popular - the World Wide Web is based on the open HTML standard. Ubuntu supports many free formats and the open-source community as a whole encourages their wider use. \nRestricted Format MP3, AAC, WMA, WMV, MPEG-4, H.263, doc, xls, ppt\nPreferred format Ogg Vorbis, Ogg Theora, WebM, OpenDocument format \n\n\nedit: are you sure Lubuntu installs lubuntu-restricted-extras by default? A small search would suggest not. This suggest Lubuntu uses the same method as Ubuntu:\n\nWhen you installed Lubuntu, you had a chance to check a box enabling you to install restricted addons that enabled things like MP3/DVD/Flash playback. If you forgot to do this, you can still install these packages by opening the Lubuntu Software Center (version 12.04 and later) in the menu under System Tools. Search for “lubuntu-restricted-extras” and, when the selection loads, click “Install.”\n\n\nA: It is due to two reasons\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu believes in free software philosophy, So the all default apps are free(free in free speech). \n\n*Legal issues, It is illegal to include such codecs in some countries\n\nCodecs still remain a problem for open source software because of the\n  legal restrictions placed upon them. Certain codecs (including MP3,\n  Win- dows Media Format, QuickTime, and RealMedia) are proprietary and\n  as such have restrictions placed on their use, distribution, and\n  licensing.\nAlthough developers in the open source community have gone away and\n  created free implementations of some of these codecs, the licensing\n  that surrounds them conflicts with the legal and philosophical\n  position that Ubuntu has set. These codecs are excluded not only\n  because they are legally dubious but also because they disagree with\n  Ubuntu’s ethic of cre- ating a distribution that consists entirely of\n  free software in the most free sense of the word. QUICK TIP\nTo work toward resolving these problems, a number of developers are\n  work- ing on free codecs such as Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora that\n  provide high- quality results and open licensing. The Ogg Vorbis codec\n  is used on audio and can provide better results than MP3 at a smaller\n  file size. The Ogg Theora codec is used for video and competes with\n  the MPEG-4 codec. Ubuntu includes the Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora codecs\n  by default, and you can encode and play back any media that uses those\n  codecs out of the box.\n\nSource: Official Ubuntu book\nLinks\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats\n\n*http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/philosophy\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't come by default with proprietary media codecs installed. However during installation one can choose to install them.\nEven after installing one can simply install ubuntu-restricted-extras package if you need the media codecs.\n", "Q: how to do ALT+ TAB for main system while in VBOX?

By default, this is the right Control key on your keyboard; on a Mac host, the default host key is the left Command key. You can change this default in the VirtualBox Global Settings, see Section 1.15, “Global Settings”. In any case, the current setting for the host key is always displayed at the bottom right of your VM window, should you have forgotten about it\n\n\nA: Two part solution:\n(1) My solution: VirtualBox: File -> Preferences -> Input -> uncheck Auto Capture Keyboard (taken from @baronbaleron above)\n(2) Remap Cycle through open windows to ctrl+tab.  In Linux Mint (a derivative of Ubuntu): Start menu -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> General -> Cycle through open windows -> change binding to ctrl + tab\n\nA: Because I use my left hand to do Alt+Tab, I personally set my Host key to be Left Ctrl. This makes it much more easy to switch if you have your right hand sitting on the mouse: press Left Ctrl then Alt+Tab.\n\nA: Pressing the Host key once before pressing the Alt + Tab combination seems to work for many. In case it doesn't work for you, try pressing it twice instead.\n\nA: On MacOS: \n(Control + ALT) then Tab\nIn the VM I'm using, I also have to hit Enter after this..which is slightly annoying.\n\nA: This allows you to use Win+Tab on the Guest Machine, while Alt+Tab will be passed to the host. I really miss this functionality when I don't have it.\nIt also works with Windows Remote Desktop Connection.\nUnder VitualBox's menu, goto File > Preferences > Input and make sure [ ] Auto Capture Keyboard is unchecked. This can't work with it checked.\nIt requires AutoHotKey (or a similar scripting platform, you'll have to research syntax for that) to be ran on the Host and Guest system. You can do a similar script on just the Host, but you'd have to press Alt after each use of Win+Tab on the Guest machine to release the key-state.\nThis was written for a Windows 10 Host to a Windows 10 Guest, but I see no reason this can't work with other Guests. There are programs like AutoHotKey that may allow other Host OSs to do something like this.\nBoth scripts be run in Administrator to be able to monitor processes that are also run as Administrator.\nHost Machine\nInstall this on the host machine as, for instance, WinTabHost.ahk.\n#SingleInstance, Force\nhostkey = RCTRL                                            ; set this to your VirtualBox HOSTKEY\nboxMode := \"\"\nHotkey, <#Tab, WinTabbing\nHotkey, >#Tab, WinTabbing\nReturn\n\nTabFinish:\n    Send, {ALT UP}\n    RDCKeysState(\"Off\")\nReturn\n\nTabbing:\n    Send, {Right}\nReturn\n\nWinTabbing:\n  WinGetTitle, Title, A\n  StringRight, TitleEnd, Title, 25\n\n  RDCKeysState(\"On\")\n  If (InStr(Title, \"[Running] - Oracle VM VirtualBox\")) {  ; Guest mode\n\n    Send, {%hostkey%}                                      ; Trigger capture-state\n    Sleep, 200                                             ; Sleep to give the machine time to process, just in case\n    Send, #{TAB}                                           ; Send Win+Tab\n    Send, {%hostkey%}                                      ; Release capture-state\n\n  } Else If (TitleEnd = \"Remote Desktop Connection\") and (not Title = \"Remote Desktop Connection\") {  ; RDC mode\n \n    Send, {Alt down}{PgDn}                                 ; Press and hold alt, and press pgdn\n\n  } Else {                                                 ; Host mode\n\n    Send, {ALT Down}{TAB}                                  \n    Sleep, 200                                             ; Sleep to wait a split-second for Alt-Tab window to appear\n    iter := 0                                              ; loop tracker\n    Loop {\n      iter := iter+1\n      if (!WinExist(\"Task Switching\") Or iter > 60) {      ; If Alt+tab is gone, or it's been 30 seconds\n        Send, {ALT UP}\n        Break\n      }\n      Sleep, 500\n    }\n  }\nReturn\n\nRDCKeysState(toggle) {\n    ; This function maps all the ways that a user might end the alt-tab box.\n    Hotkey, Enter, TabFinish, %toggle%                   ; Map Enter, Click, and their alt-counterparts to TabFinish()\n    Hotkey, !Enter, TabFinish, %toggle%\n    Hotkey, LButton, TabFinish, %toggle%\n    Hotkey, !LButton, TabFinish, %toggle%\n    Hotkey, *LWIN UP, TabFinish, %toggle%\n    Hotkey, *RWIN UP, TabFinish, %toggle%\n    Hotkey, *Tab, Tabbing, %toggle%\n}\n\n; if you get the error 'could not close the previous instance of the script,`\n; while ever trying to reload the script, you need to right click it and select\n; 'Run As Administrator'\n\nGuest Machine\nInstall this on the guest machine as, for instance, WinTabGuest.ahk.\n#SingleInstance, Force\nSetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%\nif (not A_IsAdmin) {\n    Run *RunAs \"%A_ScriptFullPath%\"                         ; Run as administrator to detect keystrokes focued on Elevated Programs\n}\nHotkey, <#Tab, WinTabbing\nReturn\n\nTabFinish:\n    Tooltip, TabOut\n    Send, {ALT UP}\n    RDCKeysState(\"Off\")\nReturn\n\nTabbing:\n    Send, {Right}\nReturn\n\nWinTabbing:\n    Send {Alt DOWN}{TAB}\n    RDCKeysState(\"On\")\n    Sleep, 200\n    iter := 0\n    Loop\n    {\n      iter := iter+1\n      Sleep, 200\n      if (!WinExist(\"Task Switching\") Or iter >= 60) {\n        Send, {ALT UP}\n        Break\n      }\n      Sleep, 500\n    }\nReturn\n\nRDCKeysState(toggle) {\n    Hotkey, Enter, TabFinish, %toggle%\n    Hotkey, !Enter, TabFinish, %toggle%\n    Hotkey, LButton, TabFinish, %toggle%\n    Hotkey, !LButton, TabFinish, %toggle%\n    Hotkey, *LWIN UP, TabFinish, %toggle%\n    Hotkey, *RWIN UP, TabFinish, %toggle%\n    Hotkey, *Tab, Tabbing, %toggle%\n}\n\n", "Q: Constant noise in speakers and headphones On my laptop, Samsung 300V5A-S19 I have the constant noise from the speakers.

One option: Shift+Ctrl+Print Screen lets me do a selection using a cross hair to size out the screen capture but I don't know where this gets saved.

Pull up System Settings and look at your Keyboard settings. Shortcuts contain many keys that your system may be expect you to use. Make sure you don't have a conflict with another keyboard shortcut and check that your screenshot shortcut is what you are expecting to use. I've disabled the general ALT key for dashboard that might interfere.\nThis is what it looks like in Ubuntu 13:\n\n\nA: My 'answer' to this, at least for now was to look for the app itself.  So I went to dash home (top left icon with circle) and looked for the 'Screenshot' app then when I saw it I dragged it to my unity icons on the left and now it's simply available as an app and I get the options of capturing just the window, etc. when I use it.\n\n\nA: The reason this happens is that on many (most?) keyboards the PrtScn key is also the SysRq key, and Alt+SysRq is the \"Magic SysRq Key\" (see this answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/5168/50450).  You can either disable the Magic SysRq key, or change the screenshot window shortcut to something else.\n\nA: Alt+Fn+Prnt Scrn = Only print the window\n\nA: Try this!

There you can find lines that look similar to this one:\n\nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\n\nDelete \\w and current working directory will dissappear.\n\nA: The appearance of the prompt is based upon the value of the environment variable $PS1.

I was attempting to install a command line only version of Ubuntu and followed the instructions here.\nI downloaded the alternate CD and went through the installation, but never got an \"Install a command-line system.\" option.\n12.04 is now up and running, though I don't need the desktop GUI. From what I have read I can set it back into text mode using grub, but what packages should I remove that I don't need any more?\n\nA: I'm not sure why the answer about the grub setting that you've linked to is marked as correct, it shouldn't work. This other answer is the correct one. shows a configuration that will stop upstart from even trying to start lightdm. Adding text to the boot cmdline will instead make lightdm's upstart script bail out early when upstart tries to launch it.\nThe package for the Ubuntu desktop GUI is appropriately named ubuntu-desktop. Remove this and all dependencies of it that you don't explicitly need anymore if disk space is an issue. But if disk space is not a problem, you could just leave them installed, because they won't use any other resources as long as they're not actually used.\n", "Q: Why is there no Apparmor profile for the terminal? I understand that Apparmor profiles are useful for securing programs that have access to the internet. Hence the question. I don't see any \"terminal\"-related profile here.\n\nA: Terminal doesn't need a profile. By default, terminal doesn't do anything. Bash (by default) is the command that lets you access a shell (horridly worded, but accurate enough for this answer). From there, you can run other programs. So any profile against terminal would be totally useless (as it doesn't access anything other then it's preference files).\nKeep in mind that AppArmor is basically a supplement to already existing security. If you never want terminal to access a file you can create your own profile and set it up.\nAs you can see in cat /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.tcpdump tcpdump (a command that you would run from bash, inside a terminal) has a profile. This is how you would \"secure\" commands. \nAlso, in cat /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/bash you will see that bash has a profile. Thus \"terminal\" is protected. \n", "Q: Fresh Ubuntu 12.10 install no desktop or wing bar After a fresh installm of ubuntu 12.10 (complete erase) after logging in it appears i have no taskbar or much of anything, although i can still execute my terminal with CTRL+ALT+T. i looked around a little, seems i'm not the only person who has had this problem. \nI found here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12303179#post12303179\nFrom there, i found myself here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates/+bug/1068341\nI followed precisely the instructions provided which were: \nthis problem is solved this way\nSwitch to a terminal (Ctrl-Alt-F1).\nLogin as your username.\n\nInstall linux source (sudo apt-get install linux-source) and headers (sudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.5.0-17-generic).\n\nUninstall nvidia driver - this depends on which version you installed (sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current or sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current-updates or sudo apt-get remove nvidia-experimental-304).\n\nReinstall nvidia driver (sudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates).\n\nIf it successfully installs, restart the computer (sudo shutdown -r now).\n\nSource\nDesktop does not show when I installed nvidia drivers!\nI have rebooted, and i am still having the exact same problem.\nso i back at square one.\ncan someone help me please? this is my room mates computer and i told him i was \"fixing\" it and now i feel like i've ruined it.

Is there a way to open Disks as sudo so i can check off that option?\n\nA: You do not need to run Disks as root to do this. To set your own mount options for a volume, you need to turn off Automatic Mount Options. This is done with the switch at the top of the Mount Options dialog. Just toggle that switch so it says \"Off\" and you will be able to change the mount options as you see fit. When you click OK, you will need to enter your password for the changes to be applied.\n\nWith \"Automatic Mount Options\", volumes are mounted as they appear. When you turn that off, Disks adds an entry to /etc/fstab so the system always knows to mount that disk at startup, and in a particular way. I'm guessing this partition contains a swap file or something of the sort, so you may want to change the Mount Point field or reconfigure your swap file, since the mount point will be different from when it was automatic.\n", "Q: Will AMD continue to update the legacy Fglrx driver?

If I stick something like this in the relation-joined:\nrelation-set user=my_superuser\n\nI'm having an issue where the postgres/db-admin-relation-changed can actually run before the consumer joins runs (or finishes running at least).\nEventually, the postgresql/db-admin-relation-changed will run and get my data, but if it runs too quickly, I could wind up with 2 superusers.\nTL;DR:  Is there a way to guarantee that default configuration is overridden in a service on the provides side of the relationship?\n\nA: There is no way to guarantee which hook runs first in the hook execution scheme, but you can predict which hook series will execute first. When a relation is added the *-relation-joined hooks are fired first (on both services, with no clear winner of who goes first), followed by the *-relation-changed hooks for each service. Since you can't guarantee which of the who hooks in a given relation state will fire first you can trump the relation-changed hook on the Postgres charm by placing your relation-set commands in relation-joined hook in your charm.\nThis won't work for every charm/relation as it depends on where the heavy lifting is done for each relation. For example, the MySQL charm does all the database creation instructions during the relation-joined hook, so the above wouldn't actually help you achieve anything as you'd still have the race condition.\nIdeally unless there's a really good reason using what the postgres charm provides is probably the best way to go.\n", "Q: grub2 - Finding an encrypted Debian I have a Triple-Boot-System, with Windows 7, Ubuntu 12.10 and Crunchbang (a Debian derivative - unstable Debian at that). \nI am trying to get all encrypted: Windows with TrueCrypt FDE, chaining grub on an extra boot partition with the Windows Bootloader on MBR. \nSince Ubuntu cut out the encryption option (none in ubiquity and no alternate install), Ubuntu is not encrypted. \nCrunchbang though is. \nMy Partition map looks thus as follows:\nsda1: Win7\nsda2: win7-boot junk (installed it by default - what is that anyway?!)\nsda3: /boot\nsda4: ubuntu\nsda5: encrypted -> sda8(?): crunchbang\nsda6: encrypted -> sda9(?): swap\nsda7: another ext4\n\nThing is, after installation, I could boot Windows and Crunchbang fine. update-grub however printed out that he found Ubuntu, no Crunchbang but after reboot he just gave me Crunchbang. \nReinstalled Ubuntu, including grub on sda3. Now he only finds Ubuntu. \nThe latter I think is quite obvious, how should grub find an encrypted os? But could someone explain to me how I can Dual-Boot two (in theory encrypted) Linux's with grub2?\n\nA: When you do an update-grub, it scans all the partitions it can see for OSs that it knows what to do with.  If your encrypted partition is not mounted when it scans, it will not find the OSs that are encrypted.\nSo your first step is to decrypt the encrypted partitions and mount them to a block device.  You can do this with cryptsetup:\ncryptsetup luksOpen <device> <name>\n\nSo if your encrypted device is /dev/sda5 (your partition structure isn't clear), use something like\ncryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda5 crunch\n\nto decrypt /dev/sda5 and mount the decrypted block device (not the filesystem!) on /dev/mapper/crunch.  Then you can go ahead and mount /dev/mapper/crunch <some mountpoint> as normal.\n\nA: I had the same problem, when in my dual boot Debian box, the \"not encrypted Debian instllation\", updated grub and left out the \"encrypted LVM\" one. \nThis article helped me a lot, and I performed the following steps to activate the LVM volumes that are installed on /dev/sdg before calling update-grub.\n$ sudo apt-get install cryptsetup\n$ sudo apt-get install lvm2\n$ sudo lsblk -f /dev/sdg  # Identify encrypted device\n$ sudo file -s /dev/sdg5   \n$ sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdg5 encrypted_device  # Open the encrypted container\n$ sudo vgdisplay --short  # Identify volume group\n$ sudo lvs -o lv_name,lv_size -S vg_name=enc-vg  # List logical volumes\n$ sudo lvchange -ay enc-vg  # Activate every logical volume\n$ sudo update-grub\n$ sudo lvchange -an enc-vg  # Deactivate active volumes\n$ sudo cryptsetup luksClose encrypted_device  # Close the opened container\n\n", "Q: Where can I find apparmor profiles? I'm interested in using apparmor to secure my laptop, and I am wondering if there is a place where I can find apparmor profiles for firefox and other desktop programs.\n\nA: The profile for Firefox comes with the installation of Firefox. However, it is not enabled by default.

I installed a couple of Ubuntu versions previously only to be deleted or unused leaving the allocated space they used haunted.Using a tool like GParted how can I merge all those pieces into my original HDD space which was 500GB.Below is the picture of how it looks.Help needed very badly. \n\nA: First, delete all the old partitions that you don't want, using gparted.  Then resize the remaining partition to take up that extra space.  It's pretty point and click; just be sure and do it from a live CD.\n\nUnneeded; kept for posterity\nWhen you're done, the partition will indeed be bigger, but Ubuntu's ext4 filesystem won't know it.  To fix this, do\nresize2fs /dev/sdaX\n\nreplacing sdaX with the proper name of your partition.  Then reboot and you should be done!\n\nTo make room for ChromeOS, don't resize Ubuntu to take up all of the space; leave an unallocated block for ChromeOS.

When I connect the ethernet port to the internet (college network, DHCP) it works out of the box.\nNow I'm trying to connect it to a networked USRP (if you want to know what it is). A friend of mine managed to do this in his laptop (running regular Ubuntu 12.04) just by setting up a new Wired connection in the Network Manager with appropriate addresses. However, when I do the same, no wired connections are available.\nThe output of nmcli -p dev is\n===========================================\n             Status of devices\n===========================================\nDEVICE     TYPE              STATE        \n-------------------------------------------\nwlan0      802-11-wireless   connected\neth0       802-3-ethernet    unavailable  \n\nbut the cable is connected to the device and the device is powered up.\nAny idea how to solve this?\nUPDATE:\nAfter stopping the network-manager service, setting up the connection manually and starting the service again, it now detects the ethernet connection. However, the device still can't receive data and doesn't answer to pings.\nUPDATE 2:\nAs suggested I tried using a cross over cable but the result is exactly the same. However, I found out that connecting the device to the dock (as opposed to directly to the laptop) works fine. I know that the ethernet port in the laptop works fine, because connecting to the network through it works. Is it possible that the port in the laptop doesn't support Gb Ethernet (because that's what the device requires) but the one in the dock does?\n\nA: You probably need ot use a crossover cable.  The device is probably a workstation as is your computer.  They expect to be connected to a switch.  To connect directly to each other you need a crossover cable to swap the wires.\n", "Q: Cannot install preload from the Terminal I am an ubuntu novice. I cannot download preload from the terminal.

Is the .dmg at the end messing it up? Also what format should the USB drive be if I want to use it to boot on my mac?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Yes, having the files as a .dmg rather than a .img is the problem. You converted your file to a be named \"ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.img.dmg\" which is a .dmg file because it's last in line, even though .img is in the name.\nStep 8 in the guide you're using says: \"sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m\" Notice \"downloaded.img\" and how it's not \"downloaded.img.dmg\" like you have it. Make sure you typed everything in step 3 correctly, it should be \"sudo hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o /Users/Trev_Carlson/Downloads/ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.img /Users/Trev_Carlson/Downloads/ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso\"\nIf that's still not working, I would suggest looking at this guide from the help.ubuntu.com page instead:\nStep 4 in the guide says \"Note: OS X tends to put the .dmg ending on the output file automatically.\" What this step is saying that OS X tries to make it a .dmg file unless you force it to make it a .img file instead.\n\nA: You are doing everything correctly! That is the way that it is supposed to be. Just eject and put into any computer you need. It always works for me that way.\n\nA: These steps work for me on my macbook \n\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/disk2\nsudo dd if=./xubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64.img of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m\ndiskutil eject /dev/disk2\n\ndisk2 is in my case the usb drive. you have to know which belongs to your usb drive. You should use sudo dd if=./xubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64.img of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m\n/dev/rdiskN is much faster than /dev/diskN\n", "Q: Gmail-like replacement for Thunderbird I am looking for an e-mail client for Ubuntu 10.04-12.04 which would look like Gmail and would replace my current Thunderbird configuration. I have no problems with the efficiency or reliability of Thunderbird, but I am used to the Gmail interface and the interface of Thunderbird doesn't suit my taste even after forcing myself to learn, use and configure it for several weeks. Unfortunately, I can no longer use Gmail for corporate e-mails.\nI would like to have:\n\n\n*\n\n*interface close to Gmail\n\n*many, if not most features of Thunderbird (and Gmail) -- address books, labels, automatic scoring, conversation view, starring interesting articles, filters, single-key shortcuts (like \"a\" in Thunderbird or \"y\" in Gmail).\n\n\nI would have no problem with a TB plugin that just modifies the interface, if you know of one.\n\nA: Have you tried Thunderbird conversation add-on?\n\nA: An email client called geary is in an early state of development, but provides most of the features that you want. It is explicitly designed around gmail support and the conversation view style and implements features such as starring messages and labels, but search is limited to the message headers and not the full text until version 0.3.\nIt may not be quite ready for your purposes, but it is worth keeping in mind, as it closely resembles the gmail way of conversation style organisation, which is in contrast to how Thunderbird deals with mail. In geary, like in gmail, related emails are viewed as one conversation; i.e. when one mail is opened, the replies and other related mails to it are also shown. For more general information, please see the wiki mentioned or the help pages here.\nThe screenshot below is from the latest compiled version (0.2.2), but I will update it in the future as geary develops.\n\nYou can either compile it from source or install the ppa, while also noting the information here regarding ppas:\nNote: at the current time this ppa is only for Precise (12.04) and earlier Ubuntu versions; geary 0.21 is in the Quantal repositories, but it will be necessary to compile if you want later versions than 0.21 on Quantal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yorba/ppa\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install geary\n\n", "Q: Resize NTFS Volume LVM This is my setup with a Harddrive of 1TB capacity and one lvm partition with the size of around 100GB on it.

I believe 2. is what Ubuntu uses, so I assume it will work well with indicators and with detecting system printers. However, I haven't been able to find any documentation at all for it.\nAny recommendation on the best way to add a print dialog to my app?\n\nA: It seems that a reasonable way to add printing to your app with Gtk would be the Gtk.PrintOperation. This is supposed to be the high-level, portable version of a print dialog.\nIn Python, a basic example could look like this:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\n\nclass MyWindow(Gtk.Window):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        Gtk.Window.__init__(self, title=\"Hello World Printing\")\n        self.button = Gtk.Button(label=\"Print A Rectangle\")\n        self.button.connect(\"clicked\", self.on_button_clicked)\n        self.add(self.button)\n\n    def on_button_clicked(self, widget):\n        pd = Gtk.PrintOperation()\n        pd.set_n_pages(1)\n        pd.connect(\"draw_page\", self.draw_page)\n        result = pd.run(\n            Gtk.PrintOperationAction.PRINT_DIALOG, None)\n        print result  # handle errors etc.\n\n    def draw_page(self, operation=None, context=None, page_nr=None):\n        ctx = context.get_cairo_context()\n        w = context.get_width()\n        h = context.get_height()\n        ctx.set_source_rgb(0.5, 0.5, 1)\n        ctx.rectangle(w*0.1, h*0.1, w*0.8, h*0.8)\n        ctx.stroke()\n        return\n\n\nwin = MyWindow()\nwin.connect(\"delete-event\", Gtk.main_quit)\nwin.show_all()\nGtk.main()\n\n", "Q: Nautilus - show folder size in List view? In the List view in Nautilus, I can see datestamp, name, etc - but it would be great to add one more extra tab and make the size of everything contained in a folder visible at a glance as well. \nIs there a command or a way to do so?\n\nA: I don't think there is a way directly to do what you want to do - if I understand what you want properly - however you might be interested in using baobab (can be run from the command line, or from the Unity Dash - also known as Disk Usage Analyzer) when managing folder sizes.\n", "Q: Skype 4.1 keeps crashing on Ubuntu 12.10!

I had the same problems as you and tried to install with apt-get and yum; manually download and install the package, then purge it; add repositories and do the same; install old versions; use WINE, etc.. \nRemember: it's a Microsoft product now. They'll make whatever they can (without making it too obvious) to make you believe their system is better (because it is inherently more compatible with their products). As you, I really need Skype; so I have a virtual machine with Windows (it's way easier than it was for me to try tweaking Skype for Linux so it could work) for Windows programs.\n", "Q: How can I improve Eclipse's user Interface to get rid of the excessive padding and spacing? Eclipse Juno (historical versions too) has too much padding applied to the tabs and borders. This makes it hard to work with multiple project folders, especially ones containing multiple packages and nested directories, due to an overall lack of space.\nThis only appears to be an issue on Linux. Windows and OSX both have less padding which vastly improves the user experience.\nThis issue affects my 15.4 inch laptop with a resolution of 1366 x 768. I'm not sure if this issue affects larger resolutions.\nIs there a way to change the padding and make the whole application look a little more compact / smaller?\nI've attached a screenshot of an empty Eclipse project in Eclipse. I'll add an OSX screenshot tomorrow for comparison.\n\n\n\nA: Eclipse uses the SWT toolkit which uses GTK, so if you can apply some theme which reduces padding, you'll see that improved on Eclipse.\nI made the following test: created a small .gtkrc-2.0 file on my Home folder with the following contents:\nstyle \"eclipse\" {\n  xthickness = 0\n  ythickness = 0\n}\n\nclass \"GtkWidget\" style \"eclipse\"\n\nSo, the results are (upper screenshot is before, bottom is after):\n\n... not as impressive as the second screenshot, from the New Java Class... dialog (left is before the changes, right is after):\n\nThe clues were from the Eclipse SWT FAQ and the GnomeArt Tutorial on themes.\nCheers!\n", "Q: How to change location where logs are stored? I am running out of space and would like to move my logs to recover some room on my SSD. My question:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have an SSD (mounted at /) and regular hard-drive (mounted at /mnt/d2). How can I change it so that my logs (all the logs stored in /var/log) are stored somewhere on my other hard-drive (maybe /mnt/d2/var/log)?\n\n\nThank you!\n\nA: sudo /etc/init.d/rsyslog stop\nsudo mv /var/log /mnt/d2/\nsudo ln -s /mnt/d2/log /var/log\nsudo /etc/init.d/rsyslog start\n\nYou might want to go ahead and reboot the machine, while you're at it, just in case you have something other than rsyslogd busily trying to write to logs under /var/log - those won't recover until they're restarted as well, which just bouncing the whole box will accomplish nicely.\nWhat we're doing here is, instead of trying to reconfigure everything that might possibly want to write to /var/log, instead just gently redirecting things going there to your other disk.  You can still cd /var/log or less /var/log/syslog or whatever and have it work just fine, this way, and any new programs that try to log to directories under /var/log directly rather than working through rsyslogd will also still work as expected.\n\nA: I don't have enough reputation to add this as a comment, so here it is as a necro-answer:\nIt's probably better to mount-bind this in your fstab, copy all the logfiles currently in it to the new partition, then reboot.

Here are the instructions I used: http://linuxexpresso.wordpress.com/2011/01/02/howto-ubuntu-upnp-server-to-xbox-360/.  I can stream avi files fine but I cannot stream mp4s.  When I go to videos on the xbox, I can see all of the videos and folders but when I click play for an mp4 nothing happens.\nOn my ubuntu desktop I can click on the mp4 file and it plays fine.  And if I take that file, stick it on a thumb drive and plug it directly into the xbox the mp4 will play off the thumb drive.  I'm lost for why it won't work through ushare.  Any ideas?\n\nA: By default, ushare only streams audio mp4 files. I found a fix for this by editing some source code. If you open up the mime.c file and move the mp4 mime type into the video section and change the respective variables, then you can compile and install it to work great. \nIf you don't feel comfortable doing this, I have written a little script that does it all for you and sets your ushare.conf setting for you in the process! The only problem that I can't figure out is that for some reason, even though the xbox configuration is correct in the file, it still doesn't work unless you send the -x argument into the command line. I suggest removing your previous installation before running my script though, because I don't know what exactly happens if you don't.\nYou can download it here: https://rapidshare.com/files/2379920576/install%20ushare.zip\nJust unpack and run the shell script.\nEDIT: This script does not work on Ubuntu 12.10.

It is more or less a single-paged superquick youtube.com meta searcher - which itself inturn launches MPLAYER at the request of any listed video.\nThis entire setup intrigued me as it got me thinking about the bit of code the programmer(s) used to get their GTK youtube searcher to pass an URL/steaming media to mplayer.\nIn that line of investigation, I stumbled across this::\nhttp://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/1405/stream-youtube-url-directly-to-mplayer.\nAnd there, voila, a bit code resembling that which likely was used with this youtube-browser app that comes in Antix Linux (Great distro).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 Unity Performance - Dragging a GLXGEARS through the Desktop I've been using the 12.10 since It was launched. \nI have a I7 with a Geforce GT520 running 304.43 driver version.\nWith 12.04, using a lot of Compiz animation, I could drag a window running glxgears quickly through the desktop, but now, using 12.10, is almost impossible to do this.

I used \"System Settings / Printing / Add Printer / Find Printer\" (roughly speaking) which found the printer as soon as I turned it on. In fact the drivers it found were for a slightly lower spec device - the PX710W - but so far I have not had any difficulties as a result of this.\nI hope you find this useful.\n\nA: On newer versions of Ubuntu (and amd64 Epson drivers), you only need to enable the Universe repository to install the dependencies.\nFor those who are not strictly on Ubuntu but another Debian derivative distribution: I downloaded an lsb-compat forward-port package from an MX Linux forum from here. You may be able to use this on Ubuntu if you do not want to enable the Universe repository.\nThat provided lsb for me and I was able to install the epson-inkjet-printer-scpr and the epson-printer-utility packages obtained from Epson. Shame on the printer manufacturers that they make us go through such hoops.\nFor the record I'm using Devuan Ceres, so I'm not with Linux Mint.

VMWARE has vmtools to enhance VM performance. Does KVM has the same tool to enhance its VM?\nIf so, how to install such tools? thanks for any input! \n\nA: Yes, vmware tools provide paravirtualization support to the guest operating system. The equivalent for KVM is virtio. Drivers are available for linux and windows:\nhttp://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio\n\nA: There is no such thing at the moment.\n\nA: One of the big advantage of VMware is the comprehensive operation and maintenance applications (GUI-based). That's definitely a value-add of VMware tools but at high price (licenses).\nUbuntu w/ KVM seems to have better performance compared to VMware. The challenge here is more related to manageability. Command line provides as well a lot of possibilities but the VMware GUI's are more human readable.\nOf course, it depends about the use case and the experience of your administrator but in a service provider environment, manageability is key of success. \n", "Q: converting the OS with all software installed to iso file I am trying to make my entire ubuntu(12.04) OS with all the softwares installed to an ISO file so that It can be installed through Virtual box in another system .\nCould someone help me in this ?\n\nA: You can check out Linux Mint Forums or this blog where the discuss the same issue. \nApparently the tools to use are Remastersys or Relinux, Relinux appears to be newer and more promising.\n\nA: You can use dd to do this - but you'll need another hard drive available to do so, and it'll need to be big enough to contain a file the size of your entire system drive.\nIt might be better instead to back up and restore your data, installed package list, and files.\nsudo dpkg --get-selections > /home/me/mypackages.list\nThat dumps the list of all packages installed on your system to /home/me/mypackages.list.  Now, do a clean Ubuntu install on a new VM on your Virtualbox.

I always thought that it was MOTU's job not only to bring packages into the universe repository but also make them available in the Ubuntu Software Center. There are many stable releases of applications out there, but many of them are not in the Center.  \nIs it part of MOTU's job to bring that \"some\" packages into Ubuntu Software Center? \n\nA: No, MOTU's jobs aren't to just randomly pull in packages from Launchpad, though it's possible for anyone to file a request for something to be packaged, but that could be hit or miss, depending on who is around to do the work and if it interests them (remember a great portion of Ubuntu developers are volunteers).\nIf you want something to be put into the software center for an existing stable release (not universe) then the best thing you can do is to ask the makers of the software to check out My Apps and submit their application to the Software Center directly. This also has it's drawbacks, namely an application might sit in a queue waiting review (depending on volunteer contributions), or it might sail through relatively quickly, there's really no way to tell offhand.\nEither way currently has a problem of being blocked on humans to review things, which as you can probably tell, doesn't scale, here are some blueprints of plans Ubuntu plans on implementing to make this process suck less:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/appdev-r-arb-review\n\n*https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/appdev-r-app-upload-process-feedback\n", "Q: Upgrade went wrong, laptop essentially 'bricked' I have an old netbook I was trying to upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10.\nUbuntu was in the process of upgrading when everything completely froze.

Only in LightDM without this behaviour after login? I whant to be able just logout to lightdm by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del and it would hibernate after timeout automatically instead of power off or hibernate my computer.\n\nA: You could do this, but it won't be simple. First you can setup a script that runs when lightdm starts the display. Since it restarts the display when you logout, you'd write a small script that has a 5 minute timer in it that hibernates after a 5 minute delay.  You'd set lightdm.conf to run this script by editing the config file like so:\ndisplay-setup-script=hibernate_delay.sh\n\nYou could then have a second script that lightdm runs when starting a user session that would cancel the timer.  You set that in lightdm.conf as follows:\nsession-setup-script=cancel_hibernate.sh\n\nAs for the contents of those scripts, they could be simple. hibernate_delay.sh would be something like this, although you'd need to do the parts after the \"touch\" line in a second script that ran in the background:\n#!/bin/sh\ntouch /tmp/hibernate_timer\nsleep 300\nif [ -f /tmp/hibernate_timer ];\nthen\n  echo \"5 minutes is up, hibernating\"\n  pmi action hibernate\nelse\n  echo \"hibernation cancelled\"\nfi\n\nThe cancel_hibernate.sh script would simply remove the hibernate_timer file so that it doesn't hibernate:\n#!/bin/sh\nrm -f /tmp/hibernate_timer\n\nNow the theory here in my answer is sound, but I've not tried those scripts and like I mention above, the hibernate_delay.sh script needs to fork off a second script so that the sleep doesn't block. I'm sure there's also a better way to do this (using the command at is worth a look), but the hook-up points to lightdm would be the same. \nGood Luck!\n", "Q: All images are gone after open a doc file created by libreoffice writer I got a paper template in .doc format from a conference site.

It works perfectly, but why?  I understand \"login -f username\" and redirection, but I don't see where the auto-login magic is happening.\nThanks.\n\nA: Most of the answer is found in the man page: man login.\nIn your original command, getty does some setup (see the man page) prompts for a login name, and invokes login. In your new command, you're bypassing getty and invoking login directly. The key is the -f option. The manual says of it:\n\nDo not perform authentication, user is authenticated.

I installed it through terminal and it works properly with my web browsers, and otherwise, as far as I can tell.  \nHowever, I was browsing through my installed packages in Software Center, and noticed that both the openjdk-7-jre-lib  and openjdk-7-jre-headless  packages were still installed from when I had the OpenJKD JRE installed, which I have since uninstalled, but did use for a good period of time before I switched.\nShould those be there, or might they cause complications if I leave them installed? Or would it be best to leave them installed?\n\nA: It won't do any harm if you leave them installed. If you do decide to uninstall them (because I don't think they're needed since you're using Oracle's JRE), make sure it does not offer to uninstall other important packages with them.\n\nA: You could remove OpenJDK JRE without any problem or leave it just the same.\nJava is a technology from Oracle (formerly: Sun Microsystems). There are several implementations:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenJDK: The primary goal of the OpenJDK project is to produce an\nopen-source implementation of the Java SE Platform (6 and 7). This\nis the default version of Java that Ubuntu uses and is the easiest\nto install.\n\n*Oracle (Sun) Java 6: Oracle (Sun) Java 6 is the reference implementation for Java 6.\n\n*Oracle Java 7: Oracle Java 7 is the reference implementation for Java 7.\n\n*IBM Java: IBM Java is the preferred Java solution on PowerPC machines. It is a reimplementation with a Just-In-Time Compiler. It is only available from IBM's website.\nTo manage your Java version/flavour in terminal use update-alternatives, to list the available java versions update-alternatives --list java.\nIf you'd wish all could be installed without issues, and you could choose witch one to use using update-alternatives --config java**\nPlease take note that java as four components, they must all be configured to you preference.\n\n\n*\n\n*java Java Runtime Environment (JRE);\n\n*javaws Java Web Start, Java application over the net;\n\n*javac Java Compiler, JDK for Developers;\n\n*And of course the browser plugin, currently mine is libnpjp2.so with firefox is easy to find out yours just type about:plugins in the address bar.\n\n\nNormally the several java flavors/versions are in /usr/lib/jvm, me, for example have OpenJDK and two different versions of Oracle-Java.\n", "Q: Need information regarding Ubuntu for Android As far as I understand, Ubuntu for Android is not the same as Actual Ubuntu in Desktops. So I am confusing both with each other. Please enlighten me on this. Could Ubuntu on Android run 32bit softwares same as the PC versions do? Or it is just the ARM version that would not be able to run the existing PC version softwares? If it is ARM now, would it be a 32 or 64 bit version in future?(Ofcourse if the mobile device architecture supports it). Will there be a separate version for Tablets, so that there would be no need for separate docking and allows seamless switching from Android to Ubuntu internally on the device?\nRegards,\nPremkumar. A\n\nA: COMPLETELY REVISED\n\nUbuntu for Android -- use tag: ubuntu-for-android\nIn every dual-core phone, there’s a PC trying to\nget out.\nUbuntu for Android is designed to run on Dual-Core ARM-based smartphones. It is available from Canonical (Ubuntu 'owner') for OEMs to add to their smartphones (for sale). It is intended to provide the Ubuntu desktop experience, but based on the processing power, memory, and graphics capability of an advanced smartphone.\nCurrently, it has not yet addressed how to modify the interface, touch, memory usage, and other issues to better suit ARM-based mobile devices.\n\nUbuntu on ARM -- use tag: ubuntu-on-arm\nwiki > Ubuntu Core on Nexus 7\nUbuntu for 'mobile' (tablets and smartphones, typically ARM-based) is currently under development and in early beta testing. Its current reference platform is the 'Google / ASUS Nexus 7' 7-inch tablet.\nThis product (for Nexus 7) is specifically compiled to run on the ARM processor, work with the current ROM / BIOS of this device, and to allow testing (and improvements) to \"Ubuntu core\" for this type of platform.\n\nAny question about the future, other platforms, and cross-architecture support are probably too early. Also, any answers would be subject to change, technology, market share, and other factors ..\nIf you want a better answer, ask a single straight-forward question.\n", "Q: Lenovo mobile broadband I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Thinkpad T400, and in addition to traditional ethernet and wifi connections, I would like to enable the mobile broadband, integrated by default on my laptop.

You'd need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the gobi-loader package (later Ubuntu versions have in in the repos, not sure about 12.04)\n\n*Download the Windows driver package and extract the firmware files from it. You need two files named amss.mbn and apps.mbn, the Gobi 2000 needs a third file named UQCN.mbn. Place these files in /lib/firmware/gobi on your system.\n\n\nNote that different versions of these firmware files exist, and the above approach is not guaranteed to work for everyone.

Chrome doesn't know which to display on -- and it can't display on both like other X apps can. That's a documented bug in the Chromium Open Source project. (See also this duplicate bug report which mirrors your situation.)\nWhat's happening is that Chrome is displaying on your local X server instead of a remote one. Unfortunately, the bug is open in the official Chrome project, which means there isn't an immediate solution that's elegant, but some users on the bug report have managed to get it working by basically making two config directories for Chrome, one for each X server, and running them totally separately. (Search for \"--user-data-dir\" for a discussion of that on the first bug report.)\n", "Q: How to increase the disk space of an Ubuntu VMWare guest, without the cd? I powered off the VM and on the VMware side increased the allocated disk space. I did this by Edit Virtual Machine Settings -> Hard Disk -> Utilities and so forth. It then warned me that I should increase the partition size within the guest VM.\nand i dont know how to make the machine know it and i dont know where my CD is..\n\nA: You don't need an actual CD. Just get the .iso image from http://www.ubuntu.com/download.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the .iso in the virtual machine.\n\n*Start the virtual machine and make sure to boot from the CD.\n\n*Select \"Try Ubuntu\".\n\n*Open the Unity dash and launch \"GParted\".

The current iso file for gparted does not support this instruction set (arm64), so you'll be forced to make a new partition and remount various directories.\nI know it sucks.\n\nA: For ARM architecture VMs you aren't totally out of luck, especially if you have set up your VM with LVM. Even though there isn't a gparted bootable ISO for arm64 architectures, it has been ported to arm64 architectures and should be available in your distro.\nExpand your hard drive using your hypervisor's virtual disk resizing process.

(also available as man bash)\n\nA: Instead of a hotkey, how about a bash alias?\nFor example:\nalias b='git branch'\n\nnow b is an alias for git branch, and you can simply type b <ret> in your terminal.\nIt is in a way much better than a hotkey, since you can still add other options to your command before hitting enter. For example:\nb --all\nb --remotes\nb -m newbranch\n\n... and so on.\nTo make this alias permanent, add it to the end of your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_aliases. The latter is preferred, but only works if your ~/.bashrc sources it. The default one for Ubuntu 12.04 does.\nYou can check if a given command is already assigned to an alias, program, function or builtin using type <command>:\n$ type b\nb is aliased to `git branch'\n\n$ type cp\ncp is /bin/cp\n\n$ type cd\ncd is a shell builtin\n\n$ type quote\nquote is a function\nquote () \n{ \n    echo \\'${1//\\'/\\'\\\\\\'\\'}\\'\n}\n\n$ type c\nbash: type: c: not found\n\nLast but not least, it is also worth checking availability for commands that does not exist in your system, but may exist in Ubuntu's repositories:\n$ blender\nThe program 'blender' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install blender\n\nThis way your alias don't shadow any (current or future) command\n\nA: Sure.\nThe best way would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Write a script with the command you want to execute\n\n*Create a .desktop file for this .sh file\n\n*Assign a shortcut key to this .desktop file\n\n\nA: A program like xmacro may be of help:\n xmacrorec can be used to record mouse and keyboard events on any X11 display.\n .\n xmacroplay can be used to playback recorded events or send any other\n mouse/keyboard events you choose.

As you can see in Makefile.cpp there is a line:\n/* USAGE: cpp -P ${CPPMK} > ${TMPMK}; make -k TMPMK=${TMPMK} -f ${TMPMK} ... */\n\nThis means that you should run C preprocessor (cpp) to get real Makefile. By typing cpp -P Makefile.cpp > Makefile.tmp you will generate Makefile.tmp based on Makefile.cpp. According to this usage comment, you should pass this generated Makefile.tmp to make as value for TMPMK variable, e.g. make -k TMPMK=Makefile.tmp detri_new CC=gcc. I hope this helps.\n", "Q: Dual Screen problem when trying to maximize the window on the second screen I am using Ubuntu 12.10. Today I bought a monitor and started using dual screens: one is my laptop's screen, other one is the monitor I bought. Everything seems fine so far except one thing and that is: if I try to maximize the window on the second screen, system automatically carries the window to the first screen and maximizes it on the first screen.

And there is a noticeable disadvantage for enabling nvidia graphic card: it drains battery and heats up you machine.

You normally don't get into that level of control using the default volume control utility in Ubuntu, but you can run a text mode utility called alsamixer. If you find the your line input, you could locate (in the playback tab, not the capture tab) your line input. In the capture tab you can set the level of the input, but whether you can hear the input in your headphones, depends on the playback tab.\nIf you have multiple sound cards (or USB headphones), you might need to let alsamixer know which sound card you want to control, e.g.\nalsamixer -c 0\n\nor\nalsamixer -c 1\n\n...and so forth.\nNote that this will only work within one physical soundcard; it will not work with e.g. a sound card and USB headphones, which are a separate sound card from the operating system perspective.\nAn alternative could be a low latency audio server, Jack Audio Connection Kit. It induces more latency than the hardware solution described above, but gives you more control.

I cannot detect any pattern to when, or why.\nHow can I determine what is causing this, and how can I stop it?\n\nA: Sounds like a hardware problem from here - you very likely have an intermittent short or a mechanical issue in the button on the front of the drive.  Replace the drive.\n", "Q: Drivers for wifi card Atheros AR928X - Find and install I am new in Ubuntu and I had a big trouble with wifi.

I'm setting up a media centre for my living room so that I'm able to watch downloaded films and TV shows on the big screen. The media centre is an old small computer which will have XBMCbuntu 12 installed on it.\nRight now, the media centre has a 300 GB HDD partitioned into two:\n1) Ext4 50 GB (where I'll install the OS)\n2) swap 6 GB (swap area)\n\nI'm wanting a third partition which I can store all my media on to. This partition will fill the rest of my HDD. Although, I'm stuck on which file system I should set it to. I need the file system to be fully compatible with Windows as I'm going to be removing the HDD from the media centre and plugging it into my main PC, running Windows 8, to transfer the media onto it. I can't transfer over Wi-Fi as the media centre won't be connected to the Internet.\nMy options are: Ext4 journaling, Ext3 journaling, Ext2 journaling, ReiserFS journaling, btrfs journaling, JFS journaling, XFS journaling, FAT16 and FAT32.\nI know that FAT32 is compatible with Windows but it can only hold files that are 4 GB or less and my films are well over 4 GB. Some more than 10 GB. Is there a file system I can use which is supported by Linux and pops up under Computer in Windows?\n\nA: I believe NTFS and exFAT are your only solution.\nexFAT wasn't working on my Ubuntu at first, but it only needed to be installed to work.\nsudo apt-get install exFAT\n\nThe linked Wikipedia article has some good information about it.\n\nIn your comment you said:\n\nNTFS isn't an option when creating the partitions in the XBMCbuntu\n  installation wizard.\n\nYou can always leave that partition unformated, and then format it after installing Ubuntu. \n\nA: I don't think any of the file systems you have listed as 'options' are suitable.\nWhy can't you use NTFS?\n", "Q: Alternative to wall, talk, write? For example: A cron script runs in background checking for updates. The user is logged into a virtual console (tty).\nOnly wall has a nonbanner option.\nWall still adds unnecessary newlines at the beginning and the the end. Also pressing enter to return to the prompt is awkward.\nAre there any alternatives for displaying notifications in a tty console?\n\nA: The only other way I can think of is to write to their tty directly.  Use the w or who command to find out which tty the user is on, e.g.\nw joeuser\n 23:10:41 up  1:46,  3 users,  load average: 0.18, 0.16, 0.24\nUSER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT\njoeuser  tty7     :0               21:24    1:46m  3:29   0.82s gnome-session -\njoeuser  pts/0    :0               23:03    0.00s  0.18s  0.00s w joeuser\n\n..and directly write a message to their tty, e.g.\necho \"Hello World\" | sudo tee /dev/tty7\n\n", "Q: My VPS was wiped, can I still access it?

I purged skype abd skype-bin and all it's dependancies but still no go. Why does it happen on LTS which I use in my office??\n\nA: Errors like absence of /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/alsa-lib/libasound_module_pcm_pulse.so means that Skype needs libasound2-plugins:i386.\nSo my recipe that helps me is to run the following command:\napt-get install libasound2-plugins:i386\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem with 12.10. It seems a dependency problem. \nI simply installed skype-bin first and then skype and everything worked perfectly.\n\nA: This worked for me. (the skype downloaded from the website it self directly gave me errors.\nhttp://xchamitha.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/install-skype-in-ubuntu-1304.html\n", "Q: Google Voice plugin for gmail not working (12.04 x64 & firefox 17.0) When I try to use the \"call phones\" feature from the gmail chat pane, I get the following message with a link to the download of the *.deb file.\n\nPlease download the voice plugin to make a call.\n\nIt used to work, and I'm not sure when it stopped working because I don't use it frequently.\nSo far I've purged the google-talkplugin (via synaptic) and tried manually reinstalling the 64 bit .deb file, both through Software Center and with dpkg -i *.deb. No success yet.\nI use a pretty standard set of code:\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu 12.04.01 x86_64 (3.2.0-33-generic)\n\n*firefox (17.0)\n\n*google-talkplugin (3.10.2.0-1)\n\n\nupdate: I tried the 32bit .deb file. Did not work, either.\n\nA: This is not an answer - solution - to your question.\nIf the google-talkplugin is problematic , then is problematic and is not a fault of Ubuntu. \nI will tell you what I did to make it work , but (again) this is not a solution. (maybe a workaround). \nDownload and install Google Chrome , I don't know how ,but for a reason , the plugin works there. \nWhen you have installed Google Chrome , then open Firefox and open a terminal too and run this command\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure google-talkplugin\n\nProbably it will work with Firefox too.

I set up dd to clone a smaller system 40.00GB hard drive (/dev/sda) to a new bigger 111.00GB one connected via a USB reader (dev/sdb) and Its been going for two hours now. The activity meter on the new hard drive shows it's doing something. But the CPU is only about 20%. When is this thing going to complete? Should I re-start the process?\n\nA: I've used pv as well as  (ps and kill) in the past as suggested in the other answers, but more recently I've just been using dc3dd instead which produces the same results while providing a progress report throughout the process.\nYou can check to see if it's already installed with: which dc3dd\nIf not you can install it with sudo apt-get install dc3dd\nThe command switches are similar to dd (for cloning, although wiping is a bit more straightforward). \nIn your case I would use the command dc3dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb\nEdit:\nRecent versions of dd from the coreutils package version 8.24+ included in Ubuntu 16.04 and later include a status parameter. You can accomplish the same result with dd by adding the status=progress switch to your dd command line.\nExample: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null count=1000 status=progress\n\nA: In the future, you should use pv to get a running progress bar.\nsudo apt-get install pv\nWith pv installed, let's assume you want to clone a 20GB drive, /dev/foo, to another drive (20GB or larger!), /dev/baz:\nsudo dd if=/dev/foo bs=4M | pv -s 20G | sudo dd of=/dev/baz bs=4M\nImportant bits to notice: the bs=4M argument sets the blocksize for dd operations to 4MB, which drastically improves the speed of the whole thing.  And the -s 20G argument tells pv how big this operation is expected to be, so it can give you an ETA as well as a current speed.\nI love pv so hard it should probably be illegal.\nNote that while doing it this way is intuitive and nice and neat from left to right ordering, piping to and from STDOUT can incur a performance penalty if you're talking about really fast data streams. The following syntax is faster, if you're looking at moving several hundred MB/sec:\npv -s 20G < /dev/foo > /dev/baz\nThe -s 20G is optional, if you actually know how big (or about how big) the stream will be, it allows pv to give you a time estimate for completion. Without that, pv will try to figure out how large the dataset is if possible (for instance, it knows how big a file is) but if it can't (eg with a block device, not a file), it just tells you the rate of transfer without guessing how long things will take.\n\nA: You can see how far it has got by sending it a SIGUSR1 signal in order to see how much data it has copied and the transfer rate:\nkill -SIGUSR1 $(pidof dd)\n\nFor copying activity you are limited by I/O speed of the device, so the CPU should not be fully loaded, so don't worry about that.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. The cause was different in my case.\nThe target drive is an external hard disk.\nIf the disk was mounted automatically via udisks and udisks-glue then the transfer rate from cdrom to the hd was about 40kB/s.\nWhen I unmounted the hd and mounted it directly via mount I got a transfer rate of about 2.4MB/s.\n\nA: You could instead use ddrescue:\nsudo ddrescue -v /dev/sda /dev/sdb\n\nv stands for verbose.\n", "Q: What is the difference between pm-suspend and pm-suspend-hybrid? I read the man pages of both of them but I couldn't figure out the difference. \nman page says:\nHybrid-suspend is the process where the\n           system does everything it needs to hibernate,\n           but suspends instead of shutting down. This\n           means that your computer can wake up quicker\n           than for normal hibernation if you do not run\n           out of power\n\nIsn't that the same as suspend ?\n\nA: pm-suspend basically turns off the CPU but keeps memory powered on. This is quick to resume from, but if you run out of power the data in memory is lost.  The hybrid-suspend will save the contents of memory to disk and then suspend, you can wakeup from this like normal suspend, however if you lose power you can power up and the machine will load the saved state back from disk and resume, much like traditional a hibernate resume.\n\nA: man-page  pm-action\n    pm-suspend\n       During suspend most devices are shutdown, and system state is saved\n       in RAM. The system still requires power in this state. Most modern\n       systems require 3 to 5 seconds to enter and leave suspend, and most\n       laptops can stay in suspend mode for 1 to 3 days before exhausting\n       their battery.\n\n   pm-hibernate\n       During hibernate the system is fully powered off, and system state\n       is saved to disk. The system does not require power, and can stay\n       in hibernate mode indefinitely. Most modern systems require 15 to\n       45 seconds to enter and leave hibernate, and entering and leaving\n       hibernate takes longer when you have more memory.\n\n   pm-suspend-hybrid\n       Hybrid-suspend is the process where the system does everything it\n       needs to hibernate, but suspends instead of shutting down. This\n       means that your computer can wake up quicker than for normal\n       hibernation if you do not run out of power, and you can resume even\n       if you run out of power. s2both(8) is an hybrid-suspend\n       implementation.\n\nI guess the difference here is that the system state saved to Disk (and not RAM) , but the system is not full shutdown (like hibernate) but suspend instead. \n\nA: Compare to pm-suspend,  I guess the difference here is that the system state saved to Disk and to RAM - both , but the system is not fully shutdown (like hibernate) but suspend instead.\n\nThen for resume:\n\n1. if not run out of power - resume from ram\n\n2. if run out of power - resume from disk\n\nA: Albert,\nSuspend is a \"warm resume\"  meaning the system is still \"active\" merely cat nappign \"with one eye open \" to use the common phrase\" whereas, with hibernate the system is totally shut off adn has the \" Don not distrub me room service people \" mentality\n", "Q: Altering the prompt Ok, so i am trying to create an alias, that would allow me to set the current directory in the terminal, the base directory to be displayed in prompt.

This file is run whenever you login, and sets things like the prompt (environment variable PS1), and aliases.  The PS1 variable is set in several places, depending upon the type of terminal you are running -- change them all, or just the one you are using.  The existing PS1 setup has several codes which get expanded into things like the current working directory path (the \\w).  Edit the .bashrc file (you own it, so no sudo needed).\nChange the \\w wherever the `PS1 being set to: \n${PWD#$BASE}  \n\nTo set the alias BASE, you can add it to the section # some more ls aliases in the .bashrc file.  Its value is just the value of the PWD variable, so  \nexport BASE=\"$PWD\"  \n\n(The quotes would handle the oddities like spaces in directory names).\n", "Q: Boot-Repair after messing up NTFS partition I posted this question explaining what happened after I tried to create a new swap partition on a Win/Ubuntu dual-boot machine. I have since created a live-boot USB and installed Boot-Repair. I had it \"recommend repairs\", after which it tried repairing the wubi filesystems, which as far as I'm aware was not necessary.

You would have to undo the partitioning to restore the primary state of your partition table.\n\nOnly if you had not written to the drive you may successfully recover the files within these partitions\n\nRecover old partitions:\nFor recovery you should carefully follow the steps outlined in the Testdisk tutorial from CG-Security. This tutorial is quite elaborate but its excellent. This is why we do not copy it to here but rather reference it with a link:\n\n*\n\n*CG-Security: TestDisk Step by Step\nTest it!\nIn case all went right you may be able to boot again and have access to all your files as it was before. Do not try to add a swap partition for a Wubi installation as this would mainly be needed for hibernation which should not be done with Wubi.\nWhat if this fails?\nIn case parts of your files were lost you may be able to restore important private data using PhotoRec which is included in the TestDisk suite but you probably will not be able to restore system files from your OS. Then the fastest method to get back a working machine is to reinstall your operating systems with Windows first and then Ubuntu in a dual boot setup. Then a swap partition will automatically be created for you from the Ubuntu installer.\n\n*\n\n*How can I dual boot Windows and Ubuntu?\n", "Q: Iptables working strangely I  have Ubuntu 12.04 x64 installed in my laptop.\nI'm quite new to linux, and I wanted to specify certain rules for the iptables firewall.\nThis is the saved config of my iptables:\n\n*mangle\n\n:PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]\n\nCOMMIT\n\n\n*nat\n\n:PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n-A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 3306 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.100:3306\n\n-A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 11002 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.100:11002\n\n-A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 13000 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.100:13000\n\n-A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 13001 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.100:13001\n\n-A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 13002 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.100:13002\n\n-A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 13003 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.100:13003\n\n-A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 13004 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.100:13004\n\n-A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 13061 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.100:13061\n\n-A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 13099 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.100:13099\n\n-A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE\n\nCOMMIT\n\n\n*filter\n\n:INPUT DROP [0:0]\n\n:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n-A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT\n\n\n-A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\nCOMMIT\n\n\nIn theory, what it does is to drop all connections in all ports except for http, mysql and few other ports.\nMoreover, it redirects all mysql and 13000-13004..etc port connections to a specific local ip in the same port, which is 192.168.1.100.\nBut what I find strange is that when my firewall is active, it blocks absolutely all the input connections, even those which must not block (http, mysql). In fact, I'm literally blocked and I can't establish any external connection.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nPS: I tested the firewall without those redirections, and it still block all inputs, so I suppose it's not the problem.\n\nA: first and for all you need to check if forwarding packets is allowed on your system:\ncat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n\nor\nsysctl ipv4_forward\n\nThis should have the value of '1'. if not (sudo or as root): \necho '1' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n\nand to make the change permanent you can uncomment net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 in /etc/sysctl.conf. Once this has been done you can further test your iptables settings (I presume that it will work after that minor change ;-)). Since you said that you where new to this I've placed a description of the rule under each rule hoping it all makes a bit sense to you.\niptables -P INPUT DROP\niptables -A OUTPUT ACCEPT\niptables -A FORWARD ACCEPT\n\nThis will drop all traffic except traffic that matches the rules that are defined. -P INPUT DROP can be stated as the first rule whereas -A INPUT DROP has to be the last. \nThe next 2 rules will allow outgoing connections and forwarding.\niptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\n\nAllow loopback (127.0.0.1) traffic\niptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELEATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\nThis will allow all packets that have state RELATED (A new secondary connection f.e. FTP) or ESTABLISHED (packets for this connection has been seen in both directions f.e. HTTP traffic).\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ethx -j MASQUERADE\n\nnat because you probably are natting , masquerade the packet going OUT of interface ethx. F.e.: WAN side is on eth1 and lan on eth0 so ethx would be eth0. This is on the POSTROUTING.\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 3306 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.100:3306\n\nthis is the actual forwarding. \nSo basicly your iptables rules where OK, you probably just forgot the ip_forward setting.\n", "Q: Help with vpn on ubuntu 12.04?

To avoid using a potentially very destructive rm -rf, this deletes one level at a time, you may have to run it several times to delete all empty directories:\nfind ./ -type d -empty -exec rmdir {} \\;\n\nSee this question for more details on what find does and how to use it.\n\nA: This should do it all at once:\nfind path/to/dir '!' -iname \"*.doc\" '!' -iname \"*.xls\" -empty -delete\n\n(Except your folders have extensions like .xls or doc...)\nReplace -delete with -print to see what gets deleted first.\n\nA: This requires some fairly fancy rsync syntax, but it can be done:\nrsync -r --filter=\"+ */\" --filter=\"+ **/*.xls\" --filter=\"+ **/*.doc\" --filter=\"- **\" --prune-empty-dirs /path/to/source/ /path/to/target/\n\nDemonstration:\nme@banshee:/tmp$ find source\nsource\nsource/1.xls\nsource/1\nsource/1/2\nsource/1/2/2.xls\nsource/1/1.doc\nsource/lol.crapfile\n\nme@banshee:/tmp$ find target\ntarget\n\nme@banshee:/tmp$ rsync -r --filter=\"+ */\" --filter=\"+ **/*.xls\" --filter=\"+ **/*.doc\" --filter=\"- **\" --prune-empty-dirs source/ target/\n\nme@banshee:/tmp$ find target\ntarget\ntarget/1.xls\ntarget/1\ntarget/1/2\ntarget/1/2/2.xls\ntarget/1/1.doc\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 running on VMWare Fusion 3.1.1 Here is a picture of the problem:\nhttp://screencast.com/t/x0rpYrqa\nFor some reason, Ubuntu 12.10 32-bit in VMWare Fusion 3.1.1 is showing multiple small screens. I am not aware if Ubuntu 12.10 is or isn't supported with this version of VMWare, but if anyone could help that would be great.\n\nA: VMware Fusion 3.1.x is quiet old. The release notes says it only supports up to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. I don't think 12.10 is well supported anyway, especially when you run Unity.\nhttp://www.vmware.com/support/fusion3/doc/releasenotes_fusion_31.html\nTry to ssh to your guest and install VMware tools in it.

I can confirm through experience that iTunes 8 will install, and works pretty well, under Wine 1.4, but I haven't had a chance to test syncing since my iPod is currently not working.\nIn my opinion, its worth a shot.\n\nA: Banshee has a plugin (Edit -> Preferences -> Extensions), which can connect to Apple devices. I didn't try it myself, but maybe it works. You can find Banshee with this plugin in the Ubuntu packages.\n", "Q: Why do some indicator icons have gtk2 and gtk3 versions, while others have only a single version that works with both libraries? For example, in Ubuntu we have:\n\n\n*\n\n*indicator-application\n\n*indicator-application-gtk2 \n\n*indicator-sound\n\n*indicator-sound-gtk2\n\n\nbut other indicators have only a single version that works on both:\n\n\n*\n\n*indicator-cpufreq\n\n*indicator-weather\n\n\nstill others have no gtk2 version and will NOT work with gtk2-based desktops:\n\n\n*\n\n*indicator-messaging\n\n\nWhy do some indicators need to be maintained in two versions while others do not?\n\nA: The reason is that indicators like indicator-cpufreq and indicator-weather use an abstraction provided by indicator-application, which also has a gtk2 version. The gtk2 versions are slowly being phased out, but some still remain.\n", "Q: Changing internal home network ip address for connected devices I have a few computers at home.  For each of the computers, I can see the internal home network ip address on any given device by typing in ifconfig in the terminal. \nIf the device is connected to the home network via ethernet connection or via the built-in wireless connections in laptops, the internal ip address for each of the devices seems to be 192.168.0.X.\nHowever, when I connect one of the devices using an external usb modem wireless adapter, which connects to the home network through wireless, when I check the ip address via ifconfig, for some reason it gets assigned 192.168.42.X instead.\nWhy are the ethernet and build in wireless connections getting 192.168.0.X, but the external usb wireless adapter gets 192.168.42.X?\nMore importantly, is it possible to force it to get an internal ip address of 192.168.0.X?\n\nA: In terms of forcing internal IP addresses, this is known as setting a static IP.\nHere is a good article on setting a static IP in Ubuntu,\nIt basically comes down to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Finding your gateway IP - IP of the router\n\n*Finding the netmask\n\n*Finding DNS server (or use Google's 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4)\n\n*Picking a static IP\n\n*Add them to the connection editor\n\n*\n\n*This should be done on a connection basis not machine basis\n\n\n*Restarting networking service (or your machine)\n\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: I can't install any package, dependency problems The apt-get command doesn't work.

I've got the Faenza Bleachbit icon, that is what I'd like to use as a replacement.\nHow can I do this?\nI'm just a user but I'm happy with terminal commands.\n\nA: You can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unlock the Bleachbit application for your unity launcher\n\n*Type in the terminal sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/bleachbit.desktop\n\n*Search for the label \"Icon\" (at the end of the file)\n\nEdit the field to add the path to your new icon and save it.\neg: Icon=/home/my/new/icon.png\nThen launch the application en lock it to the launcher with the new Icon.\nRegards.\n\nA: If you are using a version older than BleachBit version 0.9.3, then upgrading to version 0.9.3 or later will give you a new application icon.\n", "Q: Insane load average after reboot After doing a reboot of Ubuntu server 12.04 LTS (after an apt-get dist-upgrade) my server load (on a 16GB) machine goes insane (around 80) for about 10 or 15 minutes\nThe only things I can think of is the second mysql process:\n$ ps aux | sort -k6 -rn  | head -30\nmysql     1004 18.0  3.5 4230596 572500 ?

However, after a reboot it doesn't work properly and the worker process would die leaving just the master process.\nnginx has some mongodb stuff (nginx-gridfs) compiled in and needs to start after mongodb which is being started by upstart.\nThat's all I've been able to figure out after some troubleshooting. I believe I have to change over nginx to upstart and make it dependent on mongo. How can I do that?\n\nA: Since nginx-gridfs connects to mongodb, the db server should already be running and ready. This was causing a problem.\nFirst I removed the /etc/init.d/nginx script using 'update-rc.d remove nginx' \nThen I created an 'upstart' script in /etc/init/nginx.conf : \n# nginx\n\ndescription \"nginx http daemon\"\n\n#start on mongodb  \nstart on (local-filesystems\n    and net-device-up IFACE=lo\n    and started mongodb) \nstop on stopped mongodb\n\nenv DAEMON=/usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx \nenv PID=/usr/local/nginx/logs/nginx.pid\n\nexpect fork \nrespawn \nrespawn limit 10 5\n\npre-start script\n        $DAEMON -t\n        if [ $? -ne 0 ]\n                then exit $?\n        fi\n        # Add a sleep of 10 sec. to allow mongodb to finish starting up\n        sleep 10 \nend script\n\nexec $DAEMON\n\nThis fixed the problem for me. \n\nA: You probably didn't set it up correctly use update-rc.d <yourscript> start [startorder] 2 3 4 5 . stop [end order] 0 1 6 . to create the runlevel links.\nIf your script is done correctly, it accepts start and stop command, check that all dependencies are started before your script, normally 40 is safe for startorder, and that all services that depend of your script end before it, 20 is probably good enough for endorder.\nTo better know how to make a good script take a look to the ones in your /etc/init.d\n", "Q: What is the program \"Additional Drivers\" (jockey-gtk) talking me about? The program says:\n\"No proprietary drivers are in use on this system\"\n\nBut it doesn't say if it is talking about graphical drivers only or what.\nThen, it lists two drivers:\nNVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (version 173).\nNVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (version current) [recomended]\n\nBoth have exactly the same description.

Why, or what for, should I have one activated (enabled) but not in use? If a driver is in use it means it is activated? (as I see it can be activated but not in use).\nWhat is the difference between deactivate and remove?, and what is the relationship between: installed, activated, in use, and enabled; and between: removed, disabled, inactive and not-installed?\nWhy can I activate the inactivated and remove (but not deactivate) the activated that is not in use?\nAll this is very puzzling...\nWhat other drivers can I use for an Apple MacBook pro 3,1 and how?

The package nvidia-current is installed.\n\nA: The difference between each proprietary driver is explained in my answer here: https://askubuntu.com/a/218181/7035\nSince you are a Geforce 8600M GT then in my answer you can find which one to install.\nAlong with that, the \"No proprietary drivers are in use on this system\" message appears since there could be other proprietary drivers apart from the video card. There are other proprietary drivers that the Additional Drivers checks when looking for proprietary drivers, some are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Video Drivers (Most common reason to use Proprietary Drivers)\n\n*Wireless Drivers (Like Broadcom. Second most used Proprietary Driver)\n\n*Modem Drivers\n\n*Others (Most can be found here: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/restricted/)\n\n\nSo the message simply states that it could not find any proprietary drivers IN USE in your system. Which means you have not yet installed any proprietary drivers.\nFor the mouthful of words when you asked: \"What is the difference between activate and remove? and what is the relationship between installed, activated, in use, enabled and removed, disabled, inactive and not-installed?\" all I can say is:\nActive - When you are using a proprietary driver at that moment\nRemove - Remove\nInstalled - You installed this proprietary driver but you are no using it at the moment.\nSince you are asking that part I suggest you read on some proprietary driver installation problems from this question: https://askubuntu.com/a/194628/7035 also as yo mention, you are using 11.04. Going back to 11.04 and checking it out, I figure that, in that time, there was a version difference between both options (Version 173 and Version Current), but since Natty was still receiving updates (Ended on October of this year), both got to a point of having the same version, same description and basically installing the same one, but jockey on the other hand, did not update this so this could mean that: \n\n\n*\n\n*Bug in Jockey that they forgot to remove the (Version 173) and leave the recommended\n\n*Both packages actually install the same package (But this still confuses the end user, since a single option should be made)\n\n\nFor both cases I really suggest upgrading the system, here are the reasons, specifically for your question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Between 11.10, 12.04 and 12.10 there were many MANY bugs fixed in regards to jockey, so much so that jockey is not used as seen in 11.04 but rather a more friendly approach to installing and configuring proprietary driver.\n\n*Jockey is known to have some driver confusion from time to time and it was becoming hard to work with it (Examples like this) so some work was done to simplify jockey into the Update Manager and Software Sources.\nMy guess is that you are using 11.04 because of Gnome 2, which actually leaves me with little answers if you do not want to upgrade because of Unity/Gnome3 and performance penalties. My suggestion is, since you found a bug, publish it in Launchpad describing this same problem (Because if it confuses you, imagine how many other people will be confused by it also) and to install any of the 2 drivers, or simply go to the terminal and install the nvidia-current package.\n", "Q: Why does Update Manager install the i386 version of Skype on an AMD64 system?

But that answer does not explain how to map the modifier keys. I looked into the examples and grammar sections of the xmodmap manpage, but they do not explain that. The answer in Remapping Caps Lock to Control and Escape (not the usual way) mention that it is not possible to do that to Caps Lock, since it is a Lock key, but I hope this may be possible to do it with Control which is a mod key. A solution with something different than xmodmap will also be accepted. (I'm running Xmonad in Ubuntu 12.04, so perhaps there is a way to set this up in xmonad.hs?) \nEDIT: The closest I can get is:\nxmodmap -e 'remove Control = Control_L'\nxmodmap -e 'keysym Control_L = Escape'\nxmodmap -e 'add Control = Escape'\n\nWith this I get Escape when I press the Left Ctrl key alone, but to get, say, Ctrl+A I have to press the  Left Ctrl key twice: Ctrl, Ctrl+A (rather than just Ctrl+A) - not sure why I need to press it twice.\n\nA: The latest reply to Remapping Caps Lock to Control and Escape (not the usual way) says this utility will do what you want: https://github.com/alols/xcape\n\nA: This can be done with xmodmap, but be aware that if you have set some things up with setxkbmap, the latter program will override and clear xmodmap settings.\nHowever, to do exactly what you want with xmodmap, you can enter\nxmodmap -e \"keysym Control_L control = Escape Control_L\" \n\nNow, if you look at xmodmap -pm, Escape has been added to the control modifier. This means that when left control is pressed, escape will instead be the result, but when control is pressed with another key (as in Ctrl+C), it will still give the same result as before.\nTest it by entering in the terminal man xmodmap and then press ctrl while looking at the manpage and it will echo 'esc', but when you press Ctrl+Z it will suspend the page.\nIf you wish to reset your experimentations with xmodmap, logout and login again, and if you want to set the above xmodmap command as a startup item, see my answer here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I set Xmodmap on login?\n", "Q: Grub rescue doesn't allow me to boot from LIVE CD/USB I used to have Windows Vista & Ubuntu 12.04 on dual boot. Accidentally, I deleted the Linux partition and landed on Grub rescue on the next boot. The tricky thing for me here is I have been trying to boot through LIVE CD/USB of the ubunutu version, other linux versions but in vain. What happens is, it appears as if it reads the CD/DVD drive or the USB flashes for a while when trying to boot through LIVE versions but the Grub rescue appears after a while. The only option I could think here is to remove the hard disk and connect to the other laptop I have through USB and reinstall a fresh OS. Please suggest me a way to boot through the DVD/USB again. My laptop is Sony VAIO CR32 series.Thanks.\n\nA: Boot order is determined by BIOS and what medium to boot from is decided by the BIOS before GRUB is invoked. I.e. BIOS tries the devices one by one in the order specified in the \"boot order\" setting, once it finds something resembling a valid boot record it passes the control to the bootloader on that drive.\nSo if you see GRUB prompt at all it means that either your boot order is incorrect, with the HDD being on the top, or that your boot medium does not contain a valid boot record.\nCan you test your CD/USB to see if you can boot another machine from it? Also please double-check that in your BIOS settings the removable medium (CD/flash drive) has priority over the HDD.\nAlternatively, yes, you can remove the drive from the machine, plug it into another one and fix the boot record from there.\n\nA: i have had this problem, \nyou get the endless grub loop!\n\n\n*\n\n*put the cd into you computer\n\n*reboot\n\n*enter grub\n\n*press escape key\n\n*type exit\n\n*hit enter\n\n*CD Loads\n\n", "Q: Dash is empty, reinstallation doesn't help I used \nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends ubuntu-desktop\n\nbut dash home didn't show anything.

The suggested answer was to use Translate Shell which is just a single sh file. I had to tinker a bit to have it run on Windows the way I want, but there should be no problem using this tool on Ubuntu (in worst case scenario you'll have to install some dependencies).\nLike libtranslate, Translate Shell also uses Google Translate.\n", "Q: No icon with Skype 4.1 in Ubuntu 12.04 I just installed the new Skype 4.1.0.20.

I'm interesting in using this Deskew plugin which appears somewhat old, with broken links in the gimp registry.\nhttps://github.com/prokoudine/gimp-deskew-plugin\nHow do I go about installing it on Ubuntu 64-bit 12.10 running Gimp 2.8? I can't figure what I have to \"configure\" or \"make\" to compile the plugin. I understand the end result should be placed \nNoob-level: I know how to get around in a terminal, but that's about it.\nThanks!\n\nA: Here is how to compile the deskew plugin for Gimp. It is largely trouble free, but I will note certain important things as I go along. This should work across all Gimp 2.x versions; it has been tested successfully on Gimp versions 2.6 and 2.8.\nFirstly, you need the Gimp development files, and the most important one is libgimp2.0-dev as it contains the header files necessary for compiling plugins for gimp.\nsudo apt-get install libgimp2.0-dev\n\nI already had the other gimp development files installed, as I had run sudo apt-get build-dep gimp, but you shouldn't need them for this one plugin.\nNow pull the code from git with:\ngit clone git://github.com/prokoudine/gimp-deskew-plugin.git\n\nThen cd to the gimp-deskew-plugin folder and run\n./autogen.sh\n\nI would normally specify --prefix=/usr here, as we don't want the plugin installed in /usr/local, however it doesn't install correctly in the /usr hierarchy, but I will explain how to overcome that later.\nNow, run make and the plugin executable is compiled in a few seconds.\nAs running sudo make install doesn't quite get it to where we want it (even with specifying a prefix earlier), it is necessary in this case to manually copy the one executable to the Gimp plugins folder:\nCd to ~/gimp-deskew-plugin/src and run\nsudo cp deskew /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plugins\n\nThe plugin is now accessible from Gimp > Layer > Transform > Deskew.\n\n\nA: Just a heads up. I fixed this in the Git repo and moved the repo over here:\nhttps://github.com/gimp-plugins-justice/gimp-deskew-plugin\n", "Q: How to override the system locale on a single command?

How can one run a command with an override on the system locale to get English output?\n\nA: The environment variables to override with the locale you wish to use are LANG, LC_ALL, and LANGUAGE. Some apps will handle some of these differently, but generally just setting LANG should work. You can run a command in the terminal with it, like LANG=es_ES locale. The locale command will show the current environment variable settings for your locale.\n", "Q: how to get dell laptop display on tv? my dell laptop screen is damaged.

So 2 days ago I was fiddling around with kismet and airmon-ng. I had added a bunch of libraries, I remember adding GTK+, Glib, Pango, etc. After restarting the other day my desktop opened fine but my background was changed to the default and none of my files on the desktop were visible and the top bar and side bar were not visible or functioning. The window managers were still working. I then tried reinstalling my nvidia drivers to see if that would change anything, it did not. Then after doing some searching online I found something that suggested I try deleting the file \"libgtk-3.so.0\". I deleted this and tried to restart the computer. Upon restart, I was greeted by a black screen with some writing saying something about -starting clamAV [OK] -problem with Apache Server could not verify correct...something... - checking battery state [ok]. After it gets to battery state it just stops and sits there indefinitely. So to sum, I cannot login to ubuntu because it just sits at this black screeen. If anyone has any idea as to what is going on and how to fix it please let me know. Thanks!\n\nA: Ok, take a deep breath. \nFirst let me get in the needed comment about deleting libraries. NEVER EVER EVER delete any library or program in the way you did. Always use apt-get or one of the gui front ends. \nNow on to actual helping. \nThe problem your having is that gtk (the libraries that tell the computer how and where to draw buttons, windows, boxes etc.) has been deleted from your box. Therefor lightdm (the login screen) needs gtk to tell it where to draw it's boxes and it doesn't have it.\nBecause you deleted the file by hand, your package manager doesn't know that it's not there. To reinstall GTK try:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgtk-3-0\nIf you are never prompted with a login prompt (it will be text) you can press ctrl+alt+F1 to change to a text console. When entering your password it will not sow on the screen. Just type it as normal, and press enter.\nOnce you reinstall libgtk you need to fix your original problem. First I suggest creating a new user (from the text console) by typing sudo adduser username and following the prompts. This will allow you to test if your settings are wrong or if it's system wide.\nIf it's just your settings then as your original user mv .conf .conf.old and try to login again (you can press ctrl+alt+F7 to get back to the GUI based login screen).\nIf it's system wide, you probably messed up your libraries when you installed those libraries you mentioned above. If that is true, your best path to correction is to either uninstall the libraries if you kept track (assuming you installed them manually) or to backup your home directory and reinstall ubuntu. There are other ways, but they are very time consuming and not for someone new to linux. \nOnce your get gtk installed again it never hurts to do a sudo apt-get update followed by sudo apt-get -f install and then a sudo apt-get upgrade. Apt can fix many problems as long as you used it, or dpkg (or a gui front end) to install .deb packages. \n", "Q: Firefox: middle mouse button stopped working In Firefox, middle mouse button/wheel has been assigned \"Open link in new tab\" action for a while now, by default.\nSince I ran Software Update tonight, this action doesn't work in Firefox anymore. To be specific, middle mouse click doesn't open links anymore. At the same time, it closes tabs just fine (middle-click a tab == 'Close tab').\nI don't know the update details, but I remember that Firefox update was there among other things.\nI tried running Firefox with a clean profile and middle button did work there, so something must've changed with existing settings.\n\nA: This isn't an answer, but I've noticed the same thing, and it isn't Ubuntu-specific.  I saw it on Win7.  It started about the time I updated to Firefox 17.  I also have \"true\" for that flag in about:config.\n\nA: Go to about:config and disable option middlemouse.contentLoadURL, it should bring back the old middle-click behavior without restarting Firefox.\nIt's a new feature in Firefox 17, that makes you open new tab with URL copied from your clipboard, with middle-click. Needles to say, it interferes with the usual middle-click action, I hope Firefox team will fix that.\n\nA: Since Firefox 17 was released 2 days back and Ubuntu provided update to Firefox through its update manager, so it is very possible that some changes had taken place that is why your settings are not working.Try this:\nIn the adress bar type: about:config\nLook for: \"browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick\" and toggle it settings.\n", "Q: 139 updates wont update I can't seem to upgrade the 139 packages I can upgrade.

It's not uncommon for updates to be updated more then a few times, in between the time that you run updates. \nNext try sudo apt-get upgrade from the command line. It will give you more details. \nIf, during either step. you get errors about 404s like the one you posted. It doesn't mean your not connected to the internet, just that the server your tring to download from can't find the file your truing to download. Perhaps it isn't up to date yet (it's still mirroring) or perhaps your out of date.\nIf the problem continues try opening update-manager going to settings and changing your \"Download From\" to either \"Main Server\" or choosing a server from another region.

It is now November 2012, 1 1/2 year later.\nYou most likely are affected by a bug in the 9.10 release or have a media that is somewhat damaged where either the install did not get finished correctly or some other issue prevents the system to boot. \nYou should download a newer version of Ubuntu. Bugs tend to get fixed with newer releases (well we sure hope a newer release never regresses ;) ). \nThe 2 options would be either Ubuntu 12.04 (LTS) or Ubuntu 12.10.

Should we have tried longer?\nIf not, how do we proceed now?\nThank you.\n\nA: Ubuntu 9.10 (Koala) is no longer supported, and so upgrading from 9.10 to 10.04 LTS is also not supported.\n\nOnce you have your data and settings backed-up, you should do a fresh install of Ubuntu on your workstation. There may be initial issues with drivers, but this should mostly be resolved by doing an update.\nOnce you have 10.04 LTS working, then try out (but do not immediately install) Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

You will need to write a script that manually invokes openvpn and place it in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/. The script will need to query networkmanager to see if your other VPN connection has been made.\nI wrote a script that automatically starts my VPN connection under certain conditions, maybe you can use it as a starting place.\nAlso, keep a close watch on your routing table.

You could also rename it but you have to be quite organised to keep track if you do it that way.\nOnce you have done this, you can follow the complete install instructions for Juno posted on this blog. \nI wrote this myself and I always come back to it when I reinstall my operating system (which is quite often) so I know that it works well and is fairly straight forward, though I should point out this is for eclipse 4.2 and lubuntu 12.10 or 12.04 (although you need to tweak the icon if you are running 12.10). \nI have 1.7 and 1.6 on my set up. I choose which path I want when opening a project. \nBefore you try installing juno please be aware that if your project was set to 1.6 and then you tried to use 1.7 without reconfiguring the build path or exporting it to a new project set to 1.7 this could also be the source of your problem and you might be able to keep using 3.7 after all.

Recently I started using quickly to create Ubuntu applications and I was exploring the possibility of using quickly to create scalable enterprise applications.\nCan I use quicky to create such enterprise applications?\n\nA: Yes\nYou can use quickly for enterprise applications. Quickly is just a tool which connects editor, visual designer, packaging and sharing. Currently quickly supports python as the programming language, glade as the interface designer and GTK+ as the toolkit.\nChoosing it for Enterprise applications is your choice, but I personally recommend QT C++ for enterprise apps.\n\nA: You can, but you likely need to create new templates for your kind of enterprise apps.  The default Quickly templates create Python desktop and command-line apps.  You can create your own templates to creating J2EE project, or Python/Django webapps, or PHP projects, or whatever it is you need.\n\nA: Quickly is just a framework/IDE for Python and GTK. So the real question should be if you should use those for an enterprise application. There is the right language for everything, but everyone has a different opinion on that so there is no one right answer.\nPersonally I wouldn't use Python for enterprise applications or any large application for that matter. It is not very fast and I prefer strongly typed languages for good object oriented modelling which is very important in enterprise applications.\n", "Q: Control external monitor brightness via software Hello Ubuntu community,\nI can control the brightness of my DELL U2713HM connected with DisplayPort via the command:\nddccontrol -p -r 0x10 -w 53\n\nwhere in this example the number 53 represents the brightness level (range 0 to 100).

Now you can bind the up and down calls to the script to some keyboard shortcuts of your choice with System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts, like fotomonster suggested.\n\nNotes:\nI don't know how much time ddccontrol -p takes, if it is too long you can also add a sync option to the script which saves the brightness value of the monitor to a file. Then instead of getting the current brightness from ddccontrol you can simply get it from your file, which should be much faster. Of course you would need to update the up and down calls to write the new brightness to the file...\n\nscript inspired by this post on archlinux.\n", "Q: Will Gtk3 applications run in MATE? MATE, the Gnome 2 fork is still using Gtk3, although I think they have plans to migrate to Gtk3 in the future. Currently, is it possible to run Gtk3 applications in MATE?\n\nA: MATE was forked on purpose to stay with Gtk2, for reasons of performance and maintainability; a desktop with similar panel arrangements but using Gtk3 is Cinnamon.\nSee Why was MATE created on the Linux Mint forums.\nWhen running Gtk3 applications in MATE you'll notice they look different, unless you are using a theme that supports both Gtk2 and Gtk3, with sensibly a similar look. You'll have to select the theme in both Preferences/Aspect applet for Gtk2 and gnome-tweak-tool for Gtk3.\n\nA: MATE can still run with GTK3 applications, but make sure that the theme have GTK3 theme support. To change the theme that supports both GTK2 and GTK3, go to System > Preferences > Appearance. Then select the GTK theme you want to use from the Themes tab.\n", "Q: Cannot Install Softwares I have ubuntu 12.10 on my laptop. When I try to install vlc, i get this error\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\nWhat to do? I can't install other softwares too. Also, mp3 files don't play. It shows error that mpehg-1 layer3 decoder not found.\n\nA: This error comes if another program is making some operations on packages (e.g. you're running an update, you have Synaptic opened, etc. ). Only one program at a time is allowed to do so.\nThe way the package manager ensures this, is to check if a file /var/lib/dpkg/lock exists when it starts operating. If it doesn't exist, then the program creates one. It then removes it when it finishes its operation. So if the file exists, it means that another package operation is running, or that an operation didn't finish correctly and thus didn't delete the file.\nCheck that the program you're using (no matter if this is Synaptic, Ubuntu Software Center or command line apt-get) is the only one open at the moment.\nTry also to wait some time: Ubuntu checks periodically for updates, and if you're trying to install VLC while this is happening you might get the error. It should take maximum a few minutes (less than one with a good connection), so if after a short time you still get this error, this is not the problem.\nIf you have checked all the previous and you're still having the issue, there's two possibilities: \n\n\n*\n\n*there is still a dpkg process running in the background: you can easily check by opening System Monitor, looking at processes running and search for dpkg. Or, in a terminal, run ps aux | grep dpkg | grep -v grep: if you get nothing, you're sure this is not the case. If, instead, you find a dpkg process, then something is running. Try waiting. In any case, after restarting your machine the problem should not appear any longer.\n\n*At some point, a package operation (installation, update, removal, or any other) crashed/failed/was incorrectly interrupted. This means that it was unable to delete the file /var/lib/dpkg/lock, as explained. In this case, you can safely remove such file. From a terminal, run sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock.\n\n\nAfter this, you should be able to install any software again\n\nA: Either you have other packages which are using lock to install, or you have terminated or killed a ongoing install program for installation, which is why it is not accessing the lock, and showing this message.\nSimple solution is either restart your terminal, or reboot your ubuntu.\n", "Q: Wireless will not work with an Intel 5100 wireless card I did a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 install on my Sony Vaio laptop, which worked perfectly with 10.04.

Does Lubuntu have the same? Anyway....there is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and the normal 12.10 version. Is that the same with Lubuntu? On their site, for some reason, they seem to be promoting the 12.10 version while for me an LTS is always more appealing. I am wondering if they have the same ideology as the Ubuntu team.\nUPDATE: Is it okay to talk about Lubuntu here at all? I understand that it is a flavour of Ubuntu...but still. Are they 2 very different teams?\n\nA: Yes.\nYou will still receive security updates for your Ubuntu machine if you are using Long Term Support (LTS). However, not all applications will receive security updates since the LTS designation only applies to certain parts of the Ubuntu Archive.\nAlso, please note that if you are using Lubuntu, instead of Ubuntu, you will not receive LTS since Lubuntu 12.04 isn't an LTS release.\nExamples of applications that may receive security updates are those which are supported by the Ubuntu Team or Canonical such as Ubuntu One or Firefox.\nSource: An explanation of LTS in the Ubuntu Wiki\n\nA: No, but also yes. You will receive 5 years support on packages Ubuntu provides support for this term.\nLubuntu shares packages with Ubuntu in a sense that \"underlying\" \"base\" software like Alsa, the kernel, common shared libraries and such are from the same archive and maintained by the same people. Lubuntu is nothing more than Ubuntu with another set of preselected set of packages. It's just that Unity comes with 5 years of support and LXDE doesn't, in Ubuntu.\nFor the example of the kernel, Unity and LXDE core, run this on Lubuntu 12.04 or Ubuntu 12.04 (won't make a difference):\n$ apt-cache show linux-image-generic | grep ^Supported\nSupported: 5y\n\n$ apt-cache show unity | grep ^Supported\nSupported: 5y\n\n$ apt-cache show lxde-core | grep ^Supported\n<no output>\n\nThis way, you can check for every package whether it comes with the 5 years of support or not.\n\nSo, this makes me disagree with the other answer stating\n\nAlso, please note that if you are using Lubuntu, instead of Ubuntu, you will not receive LTS since Lubuntu 12.04 isn't an LTS release.\n\nBecause, regardless of how you installed Lubuntu1, you will receive updates for 5 years, yet not for all of your packages (including LXDE).\n1 You can install Lubuntu in two ways. 1) Install regular Ubuntu first, replacing Unity with LXDE via the lubuntu-desktop^ apt-task and selecting it in your login screen as desktop environment to log in to, or 2) using the Lubunu Live CD/installer directly.\n\nA: No.\n\nUnlike Ubuntu, Lubuntu 12.04 is not a LTS, this version will be supported for 18 months. However, a lot of work has been done to improve the stability of the system.\n\nSource\nNote: Lubuntu 12.04 is not LTS, but it's based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. So it's very stable, the same way as Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I'd like to recommend to you to upgrade your system to Lubuntu 12.10.\nYou can check the differences of Lubuntu 12.10 to Lubuntu 12.04 at this link. \n\nA: If you don't want a bloatware of packages and software on your machine, just install Lubuntu 12.04, but again it's not LTS. To get this \"LTS\" version of Lubuntu, you have to install Ubuntu 12.04 and then open the terminal and install:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\nBut again, you still have a bloatware of packages that came with Unity and Ubuntu-desktop and you need to purge a lot of stuff to get pure Lubuntu desktop and you should be careful when doing this. And another thing is, you gonna using unity greeter lightdm instead of the lubuntu lightdm version. \n", "Q: How to remove limit on core dump file size I would like to increase the maximum size limit for core dump files as a regular user. Using bash, I can set it like this:\n$ ulimit -c 100\n\nwhich works well the first time I set it.\nHowever, the next time I use this command, I can only set this limit to a value not exceeding 100.\nIn general, I can set it to an arbitrary value only the first time I use this command since login.\nAll the next times, the possible values are limited from above by the initially set value.\nHow can I make this persistent across multiple uses of the command?\n\nA: Per @Peter Bašista's answer in his own question:\n\nAt first, I thought this is an error and that's why I started this\n  question. But it turned out it's simply a perfectly correct behavior.\n  It turns out that RTFM saying applies here as well.\nAs man bash reveals, the ulimit built-in command has additional\n  parameters: -H for setting the so-called hard limits and -S\n  for setting the so-called soft limits. Moreover, if none of these\n  options are given, the default behavior is that ulimit tries to set\n  both the soft and the hard limits to the same value at once. And that was the problem.\nNow there is a quote from the bash man page: \n\nA hard limit cannot be increased  by a non-root user once it is set;\n\nSo, there we go. The correct usage of ulimit command should always\n  have this in mind. Most importantly, it should never be used without\n  -H or -S options unless you are sure to know what you are doing\n  (which at the time I obviously wasn't).\nWhat I should have done is something like this:\nAfter login: ulimit -H -c unlimited\nEach time I want to change maximum core dump size limit ulimit -S -c\n  <new size>\nSo, that's about it. I hope it could help someone who might struggle\n  with a similar problem.\n\n", "Q: How to access gnome-power-manager in Lubuntu?

(Because tray is useless ) So as more of you know, ubuntu has dropped the whole thing about tray and bringed something new called indicators..

I have a laptop with an Intel core 2 duo and i do believe it supports 64-bit OS. Will Ubuntu 12.10 64bit run on it without any trouble? Thanks!\n\nA: You can take a look at this site: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements \nThere you find the minimum Requirements for Ubuntu.\nI think it should run, it also runs on my Intel Core2Duo (2x 3.0GHz) machine ;-)\n\nA: It should run. \nThe best thing to do is to make an Live USB /DVD of Ubuntu. The instructions are on the ubuntu.com website. \nBoot your laptop from the USB or DVD and select the option \"Try Ubuntu\". This will allow you to test Ubuntu without installing it on your hard drive. You may want to check Ubuntu runs with your graphics card, sound card, wifi chip, web cam (if the laptop has it) etc. rather than just the CPU. Even though driver issues are less common than they used to be they crop up from time to time. \nIf something does not work out of the Live USB, it does not mean it won't work at all. It means you have to ask some questions and do some extra downloads and configurations yourself.\nSee Installing 64bit ubuntu on Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU T5870 , possible? for some more information.\nBest of luck.\n\nA: I installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my notebook with an Intel Core Duo P8600 processor, that is just a little faster than yours. I think that there should be no problem installing on yours, according to the Ubuntu 12.10 system requirements.\nHowever, the best way to know if it runs fast on your PC or notebook is using the Ubuntu Live DVD or USB (for 12.10, all you need is one DVD or a capable USB pen drive).\n\nA: The laptop upon which I am writing this has an Intel® Core™2 Duo CPU 2.00GHz × 2 processor, same as yours, and Ubuntu runs great on it.  I have 4GB of RAM, and don't know how much you have, but since your processor appears to be the same as mine, I'd say that it won't limit your Ubuntu experience at all.\n", "Q: How to add Silverlight to Chrome in 12.04?

When I run sudo apt-get install ppa-purge I get the error message\nE: Couldn't find package ppa-purge.\nI am following instructions given in\nHow do I update banshee to 2.4?\nThanks!\nLou\n\nA: You are using a command for 11.10+ for 10.04. That might work but more than often does not. \nLooking at the packages on ubuntu.com ppa-purge can be found in lucid-backports and not in lucid: http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid-backports/utils/ppa-purge  So you need to add the backports to your sources. Please read the wiki page thoroughly.

I know that sometimes that does happen, because new models replace old ones at a delayed schedule here.\n\nA: Best and safest, any HP you will buy in India or elsewhere will work with Ubuntu, be it their multi function, stand alone or laser, thats how good HP support for open source is. Epson has also improved but its still patchy, so is Canon.\n\nA: I would ask this on an Ubuntu site that is related to India.

(LX Panel was crashed by another app and the Wine menu was gone)\nWine is installed but not visible in the menu.\nDo not flag as clone of similar questions (like this or this) because: these likely refer to Ubuntu main and not to Lubuntu, which means that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alcarte is not an option in Lubuntu (it does not work or does randomly - see this question and the end of this answer). I have tried it again anyway and Wine was absent there too, and cannot change it.\n\n*Considering this answer, I have not found any 'wine' term in that file, nor in others that I found with similar name, excepting:\n/etc/xdg/menus/lxlauncher-applications.menu\nwhich contains the lines \n<Move>\n        <Old>wine-wine</Old>\n        <New>Work/wine-wine</New>\n\nand /usr/share/app-install/desktop/applications.menu\nwhich contains \n<Menu>\n\n  <Name>Applications</Name>\n  <Directory>X-GNOME-Menu-Applications.directory</Directory>\n\n  <AppDir>.</AppDir>\n\n  <!-- we disable those here, otherwise we see e.g. wine menus -->\n  <!-- Read standard .directory and .desktop file locations -->\n  <!-- <DefaultAppDirs/> -->\n  <!-- Read in overrides and child menus from applications-merged/ -->\n  <!-- <DefaultMergeDirs/> -->\n\nand also in /etc/xdg/menus/applications-merged, with the content\n<!DOCTYPE Menu PUBLIC \"-//freedesktop//DTD Menu 1.0//EN\"\n\"http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/menu-spec/menu-1.0.dtd\">\n<Menu>\n  <Name>Applications</Name>\n  <Menu>\n    <Name>wine-wine</Name>\n    <Directory>wine-wine.directory</Directory>\n    <Include>\n      <Category>Wine</Category>\n    </Include>\n  <Menu>\n    <Name>wine-Programs</Name>\n    <Directory>wine-Programs.directory</Directory>\n    <Include>\n        <Category>Wine-Programs</Category>\n    </Include>\n  <Menu>\n    <Name>wine-Programs-Accessories</Name>\n    <Directory>wine-Programs-Accessories.directory</Directory>\n    <Include>\n        <Category>Wine-Programs-Accessories</Category>\n    </Include>\n  </Menu>\n  </Menu>\n  </Menu>\n</Menu>\n\nBut cannot see what could be changed here according to that answer.\nLXMenuEditor does not display Wine at all and it cannot create main categories anyway  as Alacarte would (see this), and Wine was a such category.\nmenulibre (\"Menu Editor\") displays Wine and its submenus.\n\n\nBut the Wine menu visibility cannot be edited in this app. The same problem of not being able to create main categories (as Alacarte would), but only items. That is, individual items can be created and set to appear in certain categories but there's no setting on these very categories. \n\nA: Partial workaround:\nWine subcategories (Browse C Drive, Uninstall Wine Programs etc) may be set in menulibre to appear within visible main menu categories: putting them all in 'System' and adding \"Wine\" at the beginning of their name makes them all appear grouped together under System Tools \n\n\nThis looks easier to do in menulibre, which now also supports Quantal 12.10.\nTo get the same results in LXMenuEditor, edit and add these entries under one of the main menu categories:\n\n\n\n\n\nA: In the file\n/usr/share/app-install/desktop/applications.menu\n\nuncomment the lines\n<!-- Read standard .directory and .desktop file locations -->\n<DefaultAppDirs/>\n<!-- Read in overrides and child menus from applications-merged/ -->\n<DefaultMergeDirs/>\n\nprobably just uncommenting\n<DefaultMergeDirs/>\n\ndoes the trick.\ncheers\n\nA: 12.04 is a LTS version, so I have a lot of machines at my job running it...\nYo have to make a symbolic link to applications-merged folder for each desktop used. For example, for lxde and unity will be:\ncd /etc/xdg/menus\nsudo ln -s applications-merged lxde-applications-merged\nsudo ln -s applications-merged unity-lens-applications-merged\n\nYou need also to ensure that the Categories= line for your wine programs launchers are ok. wine configuration is for each user. So, yo have to go to:\ncd ~/.local/share/applications/wine/Programs\n\nand ensure that each .desktop file have at mininum\nCategories=Wine-Programs\n\nIf you want to see the application at other Categories, add them. Example:\nCategories=Wine-Programs;Graphics;Education\n\nFolder ~/.config/menus has similar structure than /etc/xdg/menu So, symbolic link to its applications-merged subfolder displays submenues at Wine - Programs for installed wine applications:\ncd ~/.config/menus\nln -s applications-merged lxde-applications-merged\n\nSome years ago I used alacarte. But now I prefer to modify menues and launchers using a text editor. I'm more sure that I'm doing. Specially if the computer uses different desktops (such lxde and unity).\n", "Q: Can't install updates nor plugins for Rhythmbox and other software I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 alongside Windows 7 and it seems a little lagged, running a bit slow. I attempt to check for uploads and plugins for Rhythmbox and Python, and it shows there are updates, but it gets stuck.\nAlso, the wireless icon shows that I'm connected to my wifi network, but I can't load any site.\nI'm a beginner here, don't know if there's a way to fix this or if I should reinstall Ubuntu. In that case, is it possible to reinstall Ubuntu alongside Windows 7? How should I do it?\n\nA: I could connect to facebook and google for a moment, now I can't anymore. That's why I asume it's a problem with Ubuntu. I'm using a usb wifi antenna, the brand is D-Link. Yesterday I downloaded the Chrome Installer, but today I attempted to install it and it asked for my password, started the install and finally failed.\nThe internet connection is fine, I have other PCs at home and they are working just fine, with a usb wifi antenna too.\n", "Q: What is the difference between \"find\" and \"locate\" search methods in Catfish? There seem to be two different methods of searching for files in Catfish\n \nWhat is the difference?\n\nA: locate is fast but bases its results on a local database that needs to be updated for it to find a recent result. Command updatedb is usually run daily by cron to update the default database. \nfind is real time so does not depend on a local database. Being real time it is also slower than locate. \nCatfish uses the actual Linux commands so you can find more information on both commands with man locate, man locatedb and man find if the 2 links do not give enough information.\n", "Q: What Next? What do I do at the GRUB prompt? WUBI Install So I installed Ubuntu 12.04 and did the reboot as instructed.\nWhen I select Ubuntu at the boot menu it takes me to a command line prompt\nGRUB> \nIS that where I am supposed to be?  should of it gone to the Desktop GUI?\nWhere do I go from here?\n\nA: This means that something went really wrong on installing your system. :( What you see is the GRUB rescue.  \nFirst of all try to hit Enter. If does not boot, then enter the following commands (every line is followed by Enter):\n\ninsmod (hd0,2)/boot/grub/linux.mod\nset prefix=(hd0,2)/boot/grub\nset root=(hd0,2)\ninsmod (hd0,2)/boot/grub/linux.mod\nlinux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2 ro\ninitrd /initrd.img\nboot\n\nAfter a successful boot, open a Terminal and type:  \nsudo update-grub\nand let's hope the best.\nNOTE\nIt seems that you are a beginner, so I advice you to search an expert to help you.\n", "Q: System proxy seems not to work I'm using Ubuntu 12.10.\nI've set up the system proxy like this:\n\nHowever, it seems this does not work since I cannot log into Google account in \"online account\" (I live in China).\nHow can I check whether the system proxy is working?\nIs there something wrong or do I need to check anything?\n\nA: Typically I check to see if my proxy is working by finding a site that will tell me what my IP is (such as http://www.whatsmyip.org/).\nIf this displays the IP of your proxy (or a different IP than it shows if you're not using a proxy) then your proxy should be working.\nYou may also need to check setting specific to your web browser to be sure it's using the system settings for proxies.\nYou may also check to be sure websites you're trying to access aren't blocked on the DNS level.  If so you may need to manually specify a different DNS server.\n", "Q: ATI Randeon X1500, what to do? I have a pc with ubuntu 12.04 installed, it has an ATI X1500 Randeon, it's a setup video of only 1024 x 768, what to do?\n\nA: Your card is listed here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver under 'All these Radeon(HD) cards and derivatives have good 3D acceleration support'\nRV505/RV515/RV516/RV550     Radeon X1300/X1400/X1500/X2300 \nDue to buggy hardware or drivers, your monitor's correct resolutions may not always be detected. For example, the EDID data block queried from your monitor may be incorrect. But, though a bit technical you can add them yourself.\n\nAdding undetected resolutions\nIf the mode already exists, but just isn't associated for the particular output, you can add it like this:\n\nxrandr --addmode S-video 800x600\n\n\nIf the mode doesn't yet exist, you'll need to create it first by specifying a modeline:\n\nxrandr --newmode <Mode``Line>\n\n\nYou may create a modeline using the gtf or cvt utility. For example, if you want to add a mode with resolution 800x600 at 60 Hz, you can enter the following command: (The output is shown following.)\n\ncvt 800 600 60\n   # 800x600 59.86 Hz (CVT 0.48M3) hsync: 37.35 kHz; pclk: 38.25 MHz\n  Modeline \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\n\nThen copy the information after the word \"Modeline\" into the xrandr command:\nxrandr --newmode \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\n\n\nAfter the mode is entered, it needs to be added to the output using the --addmode command as explained above. \n\nSource: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution#Adding_undetected_resolutions\nSee the source for methods to make the changes permanent. \n", "Q: Building LMMS: \"Configuring

Used 4 GB Swap Logical Partition, 26 GB Primary Root Partition. Wanting to trying out Mint 13, I booted into Windows from GRUB2, used the latest version of EasyBCD (v2.2) to restore the Windows 7 bootloader to the MBR, deleted the Ubuntu partitions, reformatted them in NTFS. I then created a 30 GB partition of free space for Mint.\nI installed Mint using the same partitioning described above for Ubuntu 12.10, using /dev/sda for the boot installation files, and everything seemed to go well, until I re-booted my computer and it went straight to Windows - I could find no way to get into Mint. So I went into windows, restored windows bootloader to the MBR w/ EasyBCD, deleted partitions, etc., as I figured I'd done enough messing around and would go with Ubuntu 12.10.\nNow the problem:\nI restarted my computer booting from the same Ubuntu USB key I originally used. Briefly, \"error: \"prefix\" is not set\" flashed on screen, and instead of being greeted with the GUI menu of \"try vs. install Ubuntu\", there was a menu with minimal graphics (like a BIOS menu) where I could select install, run from USB, etc. After selecting \"Install Ubuntu\", the familiar install wizard with a GUI came up, I partitioned my drive as described, /dev/sda for the boot installation files, install went well, rebooted and...straight to Windows. This is where I'm at.\nFixes I've tried:\n-This guide:\nHow can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\nto ensure Grub is on the MBR. I followed all steps, but still when I reboot, I go directly into Windows.\n-Installing 12.04 instead of 12.10 - same issue\n-Re-installed Ubuntu, writing the boot files to their own partition, then using EasyBCD to to add a boot option for Ubuntu using the Windows bootloader, ensuring I instruct EasyBCD to look at the partition I created with the Ubuntu installer (instructions here http://neosmart.net/wiki/display/EBCD/Ubuntu). When I reboot, I select the Ubuntu option, and it puts me in GRUB4DOS, with a cursor waiting for input. I have no idea what to put here, so I would just type \"reboot\" to exit out.\nAnd this is where I am now. Any clue as to why I can't boot into Ubuntu?\nMy computer specs are:\nASUS UX31A\nCore i7, Win 7 64 Pro, 256 GB SSD, Intel HM76 Chipset and Integrated Intel HD 4000 Graphics, 4 GB memory\nI've tried to be as clear as possible, but I'd be happy to provide any info that would help anyone along. Thanks for your patience in reading this!\nSincerely,\n-MN\n\nA: When the booting process is taking place, press the SHIFT key and keep it pressed. Normally, a GRUB screen should pop up and you will choose your OS.\n", "Q: A program/command to help translate multiple file names I have hundreds of files with different names  that I want to translate into a different language.\nIs there an application/CLI action that would allow me to copy all this names as in a list/table and then, after having translated them, to paste them back into the list/table, or that would allow a procedure somewhat similar to \"Rename\" in Thunar but with a more complex action closer to what I have described?\n(I am in Lubuntu and I prefer not to use Nautilus due to unwanted interference with LXDE/pcmanfm desktop and LXPanel. If there is a solution in Nautilus please provide it but try to give an alternative if possible.)\n\nA: The script below, which was inspired by a different discussion here, uses translate-bin, the program featured in this related question, and translates and renames your files in one go. It is suitable for batch translating and renaming hundreds of files all in one go. First install the necessary programs from the repositories with:\nsudo apt-get install libtranslate0 libtranslate-bin\n\nThe script is currently set to rename any files with the extension .txt, but it will work with anything you might want: just change all the instances of .txt to .jpg, .mp4 or to whatever files you wish when you want to translate them. \nThe script is currently set to translate file names from German (de) to French (fr), but you can choose any language that is supported by the service (-s) being used; and as that translation service is currently Google there are many language on offer.\nOpen your text editor, save the file and then make it executable with chmod u+x myscript.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor i in *.txt\ndo \n    mv -i \"$i\" \"$(echo ${i%.txt} | translate-bin -s google -f de -t fr).txt\"; \ndone\n\nYou can place the script in the folder with the target files and then execute it, or place it in your ~/bin folder and then use terminal to cd to the folder with the files in and call the script with the name you have given it. For more on the bin folder, see my answer here.\nHere is an example where I open terminal and cd to the target folder: \nBefore the script runs, ls returns dog and cat in German:\nHund.txt  Katze.txt\n\nand after the script has been executed in terminal with ./scriptname, the output of ls is dog and cat in French:\nChien.txt Chat.txt\n\n\nIt is probably best to backup your files before you use the script, but if an invalid translation target such as sgghdsgsh.txt is found, the script does nothing  whatever languages are set. However, to prevent it overwriting files we can add -i to mv: if clicked on and run and the target file exists, nothing will happen, but if the script is run in terminal with ./script, you will then be asked to confirm:\nmv: `Cat.txt' and `Cat.txt' are the same file                                  \nmv: overwrite `Cat.txt'? n  \n\nI don't think it's necessary to put any other checks in the script, so that should be satisfactory.\nFor more options for the program are available from man translate or the Ubuntu manpages online.\n", "Q: Adding a new user on Ubuntu server I have been trying to add a new user. I typed in adduser then username and also tried useradd then username. It does seem to add a user, but when I login I only get a dollar sign instead of user@servername. I have tried adding rules to allow me into the sudo for that username, but why do I only get the dollar sign?\n\nA: Well, I don't know what's the default behaviour for adduser but I think you should specify the options explicity. Like:\nsudo useradd -d /home/testuser -m testuser\n\nthe command above set the home directory for the new user and create it (-m) if necessary. Then you need to set the password for the new user:\nsudo passwd testuser\n\nThere are also several other options, check the man page to see them:\nman adduser\n\n\nA: You might have either accidentally used \"useradd\" instead of \"adduser\" - which adds the user, but does not set up a profile for him/her - or you might be missing the \"skeleton\" files in /etc/skel which normally set up a default user account.\nPlease do sudo userdel username (where username is the name of the account you're creating), then sudo adduser username and post the output here.  You SHOULD get something like the following:\nme@banshee:~$ sudo adduser noob\nAdding user `noob' ...\nAdding new group `noob' (1005) ...\nAdding new user `noob' (1005) with group `noob' ...\nCreating home directory `/home/noob' ...\nCopying files from `/etc/skel' ...\nEnter new UNIX password: \nRetype new UNIX password: \nChanging the user information for noob\nEnter the new value, or press ENTER for the default\n    Full Name []: \n    Room Number []: \n    Work Phone []: \n    Home Phone []: \n    Other []: \nIs the information correct? [Y/n] \n\nIf you do all that and the user still does not get a full prompt, then you're missing some files from /etc/skel - please post back, and we can help further.  I think you just accidentally used useradd instead of adduser, though, which does not do ANY of the above stuff - it just creates a system account and that's it, no homedir, no nothing.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Mac mini and refit I have successfully installed Ubuntu pangolin 64 bit on a mac mini 2011 5,3 ( server version ). I have used the Ubuntu iso which I then converted to .dmg and dd'ed into an usb stick. I didn't want to keep OS X installed so I deleted the current partition and reformatted the drive as ext4 for / + a small swap partition.\nEverything seems to work nicely, but I have now a question since I read lots of reviews/howto when you people installed rEfit on Mac OS X. Did you use rEfit to be able to have a dual boot or there are other advantages by doing that ( apart that you will be able to download updated firmware for your hardware in the future via Mac OS ) like BIOS emulation and the like ?\n\nA: rEFIt's primary purpose is as a boot manager -- it enables you to select which OS to run. As such, it has little or no utility on a Mac that runs nothing but Linux.\nThat said, your configuration is likely to have some sub-optimal aspects:\n\n\n*\n\n*Chances are you've got a hybrid MBR setup. This is unnecessary in a Linux-only configuration, and since hybrid MBRs are flaky and trouble-prone, it's probably best to convert it to a straight-GPT or straight-MBR configuration. (Which works best depends on how you're booting -- use a straight-GPT setup for EFI booting and straight-MBR for BIOS booting.) You can use gdisk to either convert the hybrid MBR to a plain GPT setup or convert to a true MBR configuration.\n\n*Completely removing OS X means you won't be able to update your firmware, and adjusting boot loader options can be tricky. OTOH, note that if you keep OS X, you may need to keep that ugly hybrid MBR, depending on your model's capabilities.\n\n\nIf you convert to a plain MBR setup, rEFIt is likely to stop working. (I've never done this on a Mac, though, so I'm not 100% sure how it reacts. I have heard of people running with such configurations, though.) In such a setup, you can treat the Mac as being pretty much like a normal BIOS-based computer.\nConverting to a straight-GPT setup means that the Apple's BIOS compatibility layer won't load, so you'll need to boot Linux in EFI mode. Chances are you don't now have an EFI boot loader for Linux installed, so you'll need to do some reconfiguration if you go this route. I've written a Web page on this topic, so consult it if you're interested. If you go this route, you'll probably want to replace rEFIt with rEFInd and a 3.3.0 or later kernel with EFI stub loader support, GRUB, or some other Linux EFI boot loader.\n\nEdit/addition:\nTo see whether you've got a GPT, MBR, or hybrid MBR disk, install gdisk and then use it to view your partition table, as in:\n$ sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\nPassword: \nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.5\n\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: protective\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nOf interest here are the MBR and GPT lines in the Partition table scan area. If you see MBR: protective and GPT: present (as in this example), it's a plain GPT disk. If it reads MBR: hybrid and GPT: present, you've got a hybrid MBR. If it reads MBR: MBR only and GPT: not present, then it's a conventional MBR disk.\nAlternatively, you can view the disk with Linux's fdisk. If you see nothing but a single type-0xEE partition, it's a plain GPT disk. If you see such a partition and other partitions, it's a hybrid MBR disk. If you see one or more partitions but none of them are of type 0xEE, then it's a plain MBR disk.\n\nA: By doing some research I found that I am definitely using legacy boot ( MBR ) on my Ubuntu Linux\nroot@nas1:~# dmesg | grep 'EFI: mem' >/dev/null && echo \"Installed in EFI mode\" || echo \"Installed in Legacy mode\" \nInstalled in Legacy mode\nroot@nas1:~# [ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo \"EFI boot on HDD\" || echo \"Legacy boot on HDD\"\nLegacy boot on HDD\nI think I will give GPT a go. So not only I have to convert to GPT table but I also have to convert/reinstall Ubuntu in EFI mode. That's ok, no problem.\nwhat I might need to ask you still is how to find out whether my mac would support efi boot, because as far as I know it uses an hybrid efi ( not bios & not efi )\nThanks\n", "Q: Install 32-bit gstreamer plugins on 64-bit I am trying to install the 32-bit gstreamer plugins on my 64-bit system (Ubuntu 12.10 based).

I have 228 mp4 files (2.6GB) and would like to extract audio from them (mp3 or ogg). I want to batch extract them - preferably with bash. I'm not sure if all files use the same audio codec as they were recorded in different years, ranging from 2006-2012.\nI want to loop through all of them, pick the file name, detect audio codec and use ffmpeg to extract the audio.\nIs it possible?\n\nA: You say you want to \"extract audio from them (mp3 or ogg)\". But what if the audio in the mp4 file is not one of those? you'd have to transcode anyway. So why not leave the audio format detection up to ffmpeg?\nTo convert one file:\nffmpeg -i videofile.mp4 -vn -acodec libvorbis audiofile.ogg\n\nTo convert many files:\nfor vid in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i \"$vid\" -vn -acodec libvorbis \"${vid%.mp4}.ogg\"; done\n\nYou can of course select any ffmpeg parameters for audio encoding that you like, to set things like bitrate and so on.\nUse -acodec libmp3lame and change the extension from .ogg to .mp3 for mp3 encoding.\nIf what you want is to really extract the audio, you can simply \"copy\" the audio track to a file using -acodec copy. Of course, the main difference is that transcoding is slow and cpu-intensive, while copying is really quick as you're just moving bytes from one file to another. Here's how to copy just the audio track (assuming it's in mp3 format):\nffmpeg -i videofile.mp4 -vn -acodec copy audiofile.mp3\n\nNote that in this case, the audiofile format has to be consistent with what the container has (i.e. if the audio is AAC format, you have to say audiofile.aac). You can use the ffprobe command to see which codec you have, this may provide some information:\nffprobe -v error -select_streams a:0 -show_entries stream=codec_name -print_format csv=p=0 \"videofile.mp4\"\n\nA possible way to automatically parse the audio codec and name the audio file accordingly would be:\nmkdir -p output\n# current directory has to contain at least one .mp4 file \nfor vid in *.mp4; do\n   codec=\"$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams a:0 -show_entries stream=codec_name -print_format csv=p=0 \"$vid\")\"\n   case \"$codec\" in\n    mp3    ) filetype=mp3 ;;\n    vorbis ) filetype=ogg ;;\n    *      ) filetype= ;;\n   esac\n\n   if [ \"$filetype\" ]; then \n    ffmpeg -i \"$vid\" -vn -acodec copy output/\"${vid%.*}\".\"$filetype\"\n   else\n    ffmpeg -i \"$vid\" -vn -acodec libvorbis output/\"${vid%.*}\".ogg\ndone\n\nNotes: the output files are created in sub-directory output it creates in the beginning (if necessary). For other codecs than mp3 and vorbis it converts audio to ogg. Ubuntu 14.04 does not have ffmpeg in standard repositories, but you could add ppa:mc3man/trusty-media repository and install ffmpeg package to get the needed software. See here for details.\n\nA: As Nicolas Raoul stated, this needs updating.

I made the USB first in the boot order, booted from the stick with the boot menu itself, but still nothing. I also tried using Unetbootin instead of LinuxLive, but neither worked. What did I do wrong?\n\nA: You BIOS may be corrupt. For now, use a DVD, and/or burn PLoP Boot Manager  to boot from usb in the future. Or try the UNIX utility dd instead of Unetbootin, then it may boot natively.\n\nA: Have you made sure that your computers BIOS is set to allow booting from USB devices?\nI have come across the same problem with a Samsung NP300 series laptop, where if one installed windows, a BIOS option for \"FastBoot\" is enabled, and it blocks \"Legacy USB Boot\" the mode that allows booting linux from a USB device.\nJust my 2 cents.\n\nA: maybe you chose UEFI boot instead of BIOS. (haven't used LinuxLive)\ndo you have UEFI option in the BIOS menu? if you do, try to choose it and check if then it will boot.\nanother option is to create a virtual machine and check the usb in it - you can download virtualbox and see if the usb is bootable.\n", "Q: problem with update when I try to update and type:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nI get this error\nE: Problem executing scripts APT::Update::Post-Invoke-Success 'test -x /usr/bin/apt-show-versions || exit 0 ; apt-show-versions -i'\nE: Sub-process returned an error code\n\n\nA: I know this thread is old, but because people find it when searching for help I thought I would add another answer.

Yesterday I was following these instructions to move my /home folder to a separate partition. After partitioning (Original partition - ~39MB, New partition - ~33MB), however, whenever I try to boot to my Zorin 6 installation, I receive a black screen and \"could not write bytes: Broken pipe\", along with other, varying stuff. I continued to follow those instructions from a liveUSB of Xubuntu 12.10. It was getting too complicated, however, so I just moved the files I wanted to keep onto the new partition using gksu thunar, and booted into my liveUSB to install Xubuntu 12.10 over Zorin.\nI started the installer after choosing \"Try Xubuntu without installing\", and when it came to the option on how to partition, I chose \"install over Zorin 6\", and checked the \"Use LVM\" option. Then I clicked forward, but some error came up. (I can't really remember, I started to panic shortly after this) When I closed out of the installer and opened gParted to see what had happened, I saw that I had two partitions - a 255MB ext4, and a new 72 GB \"unknown\" partition, with a flag of \"LVM\". When I tried to mount the 33 GB partition still listed on my desktop, it was unable to - it received some error of \"not enough space\".\nThis is where I really started getting frantic - I tried to open the installer again, it wouldn't, so I shut down, and rebooted the liveUSB. This time choosing \"Install Xubuntu\" - I followed the same steps, and resigned myself that I lost the data, but after selecting the option to erase the whole disk and install. Immediately after it said that the installer had encountered an unrecoverable error; it was going to boot a live desktop so I can see what went wrong and/or to try the installer again. Afterwards it just stayed on a black screen.\nTo wrap it up, I have three partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*~255MB, type \"unknown\", no flags\n\n*~72 GB, type \"ext4\", flag \"LVM\"\n\n*Linux Swap\n\n\nQuestion: Is there any way I can recover my data without being able to boot the installed OS?\nI have a considerable amount of music, game data, etc. that I would really not want to lose, so any help is appreciated.\n\nA: Here are some advices, if you want to recover data on a broken partion, stop writing things to it or booting from it. Use the live CD to boot and try your stuff.

(If you have lots of free space on the drive, one suggestion would be to copy important data from your 63GB \"C: drive\" to one of the other partitions, then when you do a clean reinstall from your Windows 7 disc, you can just make sure to do a \"Custom install\" and tell it ONLY to install onto that 63GB partition, not overwrite any of the others.)\nThis kind of problem is sadly all too common with dual boot type installations.  It sounds like when you did your Ubuntu install, you accidentally told it/allowed it to overwrite the MBR on your primary hard drive.  In the future, to be ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY 100% SAFE, when doing an OS installation and you DON'T want that OS installed on the system drive, you might consider temporarily disconnecting the system drive entirely until the installation has completed.

You can install it with sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts. You can also search for it in the software center.\n2— You are seeing the Ubuntu Anti-aliasing.

(Which looks better at small sizes, but causes noticeable jaggedness at large font sizes).\n\n(source: wikimedia.org)\nYou can get the best of both worlds(RGBa in the horizontal and regular AA in the vertical) by adjusting the Font Antialiasing settings—There are several tools for this, one of which is the Advanced settings tool [Install sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool].\n\nA: I had the same problem and it was caused by experiences installing very light fonts.\nSolution: run font-manager (must be as ROOT) and disable the User fonts that caused the problem you saw in facebook. \n", "Q: How to repair the smart data?

It provides the program e4defrag.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS does place (at least the primary drive) into EXT4 partition when installed on a clean install (not residing on top of Win-Junk).\nIn this case, if you have just set up a new system, or formatted fresh on an old system and then did a clean install, then by default with 14.04 LTS, you have an EXT4 Partition at /dev/sda1.\nNow, just open a Terminal (CTRL-ALT-T) and type:\nsudo e4defrag -c /dev/sda1\n\nand be patient until the 'check' is completed and you get the fragmentation report back.\nIf you aren't confident about having an EXT4 Partition on your OS drive, simply go HOME and type df -T. Look to see what your sda* partitions are set to (try this in 14.04LTS, and you'll see EXT4 unless you chose another partition type upon harddrive setup).\n\nA: Use Gparted to defrag your file system\nIf you have enough space on your hard drive, you can use Gparted to defrag your file system (ext2, ext 4, nfts, etc.). You have to boot from a CD/DVD/USB boot disc because the drive you're working on has to be unmounted. You also have to have more unused space available than used space for this to work and it may take a while. \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from a boot disc. \n\n*Run gparted and shrink the partition that contains the data you want to defrag to just over the amount of your data. \n\n*Make sure the partition you want to defrag is the last partition on the drive by moving it to the end (you may have to create another blank partition in front of it if there's only one partition on the drive).\n\n\nWith the partition you want to defrag as the last partition on the drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*grow the partition to the left of it to maximum size.

(Not advised, but good for troubleshooting).\n\n*Alternatively (instead of point number 3), modify the /etc/fstab folder to mount the folder with correct permissions for the user that runs the transmission-daemon.\n\n*Start the Transmission daemon sudo service transmission-daemon start\n\nA: Assuming the path to the download folder is /home/chen/TV shows, run the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*add chen to the debian-transmission group\nsudo usermod -a -G debian-transmission chen\n\n\n*change the folder ownership\nsudo chgrp debian-transmission /home/chen/TV\\ shows\n\n\n*grant write access to the group\nsudo chmod 770 /home/chen/TV\\ shows\n\n\n*Stop the deamon with\nsudo service transmission-daemon stop\n\n\n*The last thing to do is change the file creation mask, so that the downloaded files would be writeable by chen.\nsudo nano /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json\n\n… and change \"umask\": 18 to \"umask\": 2. Hit Ctrl+O to save and Ctrl+X to exit.\nStart the daemon with\nsudo service transmission-daemon start\n\n\nA: Since this is the top search result in Google, for anyone reading this, I spend over an hour trying to get it to work. Turns out, the downloads folder specified in settings.json is \"Downloads\" instead of \"downloads\". Note the case.\n\nA: This might be an apparmor profile problem.  Transmission runs under the sanitized_helper profile in apparmor.\nLook for complaints in /var/log/kern.log.  grep transm /var/log/kern.log, particularly just after trying to run transmission and it failing.\n\nA: This just happened to me.  I found this page, was intimidated by all the jargon, so I restarted Transmission, reserved the torrent file to a different location, and saved the torrent data to the same different location (desktop).  Worked like a charm...  \n\nA: my problem was that transmission somehow was running as the user \"transmissions-daemon\" instead of the user it was supposed to run with.\n\nA: In my case the problem was how the drive was being mounted. Using this in /etc/fstab worked for me:\nUUID=2069-1A05  /mnt/ext   vfat   rw,user,exec,umask=0000   0   0\n\n\nA: Mounting the external drive into my home directory resolved this issue;\nsudo mkdir /home/plex/media-server\nsudo chmod 770 /home/plex/media-server\nsudo mount /dev/sdxx/ /home/plex/media-drive\n\nsdxx is the name of your hdd. you can use the following command to find yours:\nlsblk\n\n\nA: Make sure that the path for your incomplete torrents is absolute. My main directory was using ~/path-to-download, which gave me an error. My incomplete directory was ~/path-to-download/incomplete.\nI received an error the first time I tried to download a torrent not using an absolute directory. I fixed that, but kept receiving a permission denied error, even after adding the correct permissions. Once I fixed my incomplete path to an absolute path, everything worked.\n\nA: Try this:\nsudo setfacl -m u:debian-transmission:rxw  /home/*your user*/*your path to folder*\n\n\nA: None of these suggestions worked for me so I just set fstab to use transmission-daemon's default download directory as the mountpoint to mount my USB stick.\n\n*\n\n*First I set the ownership of my USB stick to match that of the default download directory:\n\nsudo chown debian-transmission:debian-transmission /media/pi/[mountpoint]/\n\n\n*Edit fstab:\n\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\nInsert the following text:\nUUID=[insert device UUID here] /var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads    ext4    rw,user,exec 0 0\nNote: you can find your USB sticks UUID by running sudo blkid\n\n\n*Reboot the system:\n\nsudo reboot\n\n\n*You can test whether it is writing data to your USB stick by running df -ha and checking whether the data written to your USB stick increases when you add a new torrent. Note that the data increase happens all at once when you add a new torrent and NOT gradually as the torrent downloads.\n\n\nA: I added the debian-transmission user to my $USER group:\nsudo usermod -a -G <myusername> debian-transmission\n\n\nA: In my case I have the \"download-dir\", \"incomplete-dir\" (and \"watch-dir\") situated in my home-directory.\n(presume my userid is '[user]')\nls -la /home/[user]/Transmission results in:\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 [user] debian-transmission 4096 sep 17 21:21 ./\ndrwxr-x--- 19 [user] [user]              4096 sep 20 20:08 ../\ndrwxrwxr-x  3 [user] debian-transmission 4096 sep 18 23:04 Completed/\ndrwxrwxr-x  4 [user] debian-transmission 4096 sep 20 20:11 Incomplete/\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 [user] debian-transmission 4096 sep 17 21:21 Torrents/\n\nAs you can see the user debian-transmission has all the necessary permissions to write in those directories except... it has no read and execute permission on /home/[user] !!! So as a result, debian-transmission cannot access its subdirectories either.\n\n*\n\n*Lesson learned: check the permissions for the entire path ! Not just the final target directory !\nThere are now 3 options (choose one !):\n\n*\n\n*Add the group [user] to the user debian-transmission (sudo usermod -a -G [user] debian-transmission)\n\n*Set x-permissions on world for /home/[user] (sudo chmod o+x /home/[user])\n\n*Stop the deamon, move the whole directory tree /home/[user]/Transmission to the home directory of debian-transmission. Set ownership of those directories to debian-transmission:debian-transmission. Edit /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json likewise. Add group debian-transmission to [user] and -finally- start the deamon again.\n\nOption 1 and 2 have some minor security issues so option 3 is probably the best.\n\nA: 2022 and I had the same issue.\nA simple sudo chown debian-transmission:debian-transmission -R /path/to/download solved it for me.\n\nA: For those with custom locations, be sure you are applying chown to the original folder path and not a symlink.\nsudo chown -R debian-transmission:debian-transmission /mnt/nas/downloads\n\nNOT\nsudo chown -R debian-transmission:debian-transmission /home/coolguy/nas/downloads\n\nAdd a 755\nsudo chmod -R 755 /mnt/nas/downloads\n\nI was able to get around the permissions issue by doing that. Also, no need to change the umask or 777 (or running as root, not a good plan).\nAlso, the latest transmission-daemon doesn't seem to include and error log. Add this to your config file if you need some error output for debugging:\n\"log-error-file\": \"/var/log/transmission-error.log\"\n\nBe sure to restart\nsystemctl restart transmission-daemon\n\n\nA: I had same issue, and that was a mistake I had made when sym-linking the transmission download directory to my home/user/ directory, I changed the ownership of the sym-linked file which by consequence also changed the ownership of the transmission 'download' directory...\nI just chowned back to 'debian-transmission' ownership and it worked like a charm (without need to restart service)\n#chown debian-transmission:debian-transmission /var/lib/transmission/downloads\n\n(well, you'll have to check according your own linux distribution what is the right owner and eventually also your right path to the downloads directory)\n\nA: I had similar issue with transmission. I got Permission Error while downloading even with correct folder permission settings on the external USB HDD.\nI just mounted the external HDD to the /home/pi/ with the same permissions and it worked fine.\nmount /dev/sda /home/pi/USB-HDD-MOUNTED\n\npermissions are drwxrwxrwx (0777) pi:debian-transmission.\nuser name is changed to pi in /etc/init.d/transmisssion-daemon.\n", "Q: process id from window id When i run xprop -id <wid> on a given windows id for an opengl application (Ubuntu 12.04) i get a bunch of properties, but i don't see _NET_WM_PID;\n$ xprop -id 0x4a00002 \n_NET_WM_ICON_GEOMETRY(CARDINAL) = 0, 488, 64, 65\nXKLAVIER_STATE(INTEGER) = 0, 0\n_NET_WM_FULLSCREEN_MONITORS(CARDINAL) = 4294967295, 1852143205, 19456, 1645412352\n_NET_WM_STATE(ATOM) = \nWM_STATE(WM_STATE):\n        window state: Normal\n        icon window: 0x0\n_NET_FRAME_EXTENTS(CARDINAL) = 1, 1, 28, 1\n_NET_WM_DESKTOP(CARDINAL) = 0\n_NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS(ATOM) = _NET_WM_ACTION_MOVE, _NET_WM_ACTION_RESIZE, _NET_WM_ACTION_FULLSCREEN, _NET_WM_ACTION_MINIMIZE, _NET_WM_ACTION_SHADE, _NET_WM_ACTION_MAXIMIZE_HORZ, _NET_WM_ACTION_MAXIMIZE_VERT, _NET_WM_ACTION_CHANGE_DESKTOP, _NET_WM_ACTION_CLOSE, _NET_WM_ACTION_ABOVE, _NET_WM_ACTION_BELOW\nWM_PROTOCOLS(ATOM): protocols  WM_DELETE_WINDOW\nWM_LOCALE_NAME(STRING) = \"C\"\nWM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):\n        Initial state is Normal State.\nWM_NORMAL_HINTS(WM_SIZE_HINTS):\n        user specified location: 50, 50\n        user specified size: 640 by 480\nWM_CLIENT_MACHINE(STRING) = \"gliese-581h\"\nWM_ICON_NAME(STRING) = \"Full-Screen & Windowed Mode\"\nWM_NAME(STRING) = \"Full-Screen & Windowed Mode\"\n\nhow do i access the process pid associated to the window id?\n\nA: It's there for windows which support it:\n$ xprop -id 0x0540019c| grep _NET_WM_PID\n_NET_WM_PID(CARDINAL) = 25685\n\nBut not all do:\n$ xprop -id 0x2000006| grep _NET_WM_PID\n$\n\nAs far as I know there is no way to access the PID for such a window.\n", "Q: How do I get update manager to update only specific packages from a source?

I only ever want to update the NVidia drivers from this XOrg-Edgers source but I would like everything else (linux headers, image) to come from the regular sources.\nIs there a way I can accomplish this setup?\n\nA: It's called pinning.  You need to pin the ppa extremely low in general, but very high on the specific packages you want... although please note, it's entirely possible you'll screw yourself if you install drivers that need a specific kernel which you're refusing to install.

You might be able to back up your important documents and such to a flash drive by cping the files that you want backed up onto the flash drive. Before this, make sure that only your backup drive is mounted.

Is there a program that replicates the asking of Library ID, since I know you could use timekpr to time it. Thanks:)\n\nA: You could set up users based on library card numbers. This would also allow great control over what the users can do with the systems.  It could be maintained remotely or locally, and you could use a range of tools to administer the system.  The most common access people would want would be the library catalogue and I suggest this should be available with a normal guest login.\n", "Q: Configure sticky edges I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and like the sticky edges feature on my dual monitor setup (extra monitor on left), but would like to configure it a little less sticky.\nCurrently I have to drag about an inch beyond the edge to unstick the cursor.

I moved from Gentoo just yesterday, and I know I can get good quality sound from my hardware. But on Ubuntu 12.04, I have an audio problem. The issue is that the audio volume over both the headphones (front audio jack) and the speakers (rear audio jack) is very low, and seems to have been adjusted for headphones (almost no bass, reduced mid range). I have a HDMI video card (Radeon 5450/HDMI), but I am not using that for the sound. I output the sound via audio jack via the on-board Intel audio. BTW, sound plays from my speakers even if my headphones are connected.\nI have tried pretty much every thing I have seen in this forum, and I know of some issues with Intel audio, so I added options snd-hda-intel model=basic and options snd-hda-intel power_save=10 power_save_controller=N to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf (see for e.g., Headphone sound only since 12.04 upgrade).

The software that you used to re-size the main partition may have corrupted it because it's not 100% compatible with Windows 8.\nI hope you took the precaution of making a back up of your Windows install. If so, you can use it to do a re-install and make the partitions the size that you want from the start. You can also use the back up to possibly repair any problems that may have been created with the re-size / deletion of some partitions.\nFurthermore, I would suggest using Ubuntu version 12.10 or 13.04; in my experience, they play a lot nicer with UEFI machines and Windows 8. I know 13.04 isn't totally stable at this point, but I haven't had any problems with it yet.\n", "Q: How to detect image dimensions and run commands on them?

Now, I can't install new programs (message see in title), or change the admin password (\"change\" button grayed out). I tried a suggested fix from inside the terminal, but can't type anything into the sudo authentication field.\n\nA: OK, there's two parts to this.  First, to answer the question you asked:\nReboot into single user mode (see http://www.debuntu.org/recover-root-password-single-user-mode-and-grub if you don't know how) and set the password for root.\nHowever, I don't think that will solve your actual problem.  It sounds like the real problem is that the account you normally log in as is not a member of the sudo group - the root account on Ubuntu normally does not have a password, and is not allowed to log in directly.  So, instead, I would recommend that you boot into single user mode as outlined above, then issue the following commands:\nadduser youraccountname sudo\npasswd youraccountname\nshutdown -r now\n\nThis will make sure that your user is allowed to become root, and will make sure that your user has a password which you can use when prompted.  Once the machine finishes rebooting (the third command there), everything should be back to normal.\n\nA: If you didn't ever set up a password you do not have to recover it but you just have to create it in System settings/User Account.  There, click on Password.\nSo, let's create a new password that you will use as administrator for upgrading, installations and others. In few words, if you didn't ever create a password, create your password and use it when required.\nGreetings, Bagsmi. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 install stuck at first step I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 from a DVD-R disk, and everything is just fine until I get to the first window after clicking Install Ubuntu I checked the box Download updates while installing and also the Install third-party software box. \nAfter clicking next, however, the install just hangs there.

Thanks!\n\nA: Check the md5sum of your downloaded iso, (in windows use http://www.winmd5.com/), get the checksum to compare with from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes, if the sums are the same burn the iso on another dvd preferably on a regular dvd and try again.

I run :set paste and then enter insert mode, and paste the text in using the right mouse-button menu.  vim them uses 100% cpu for the next several minutes before successfully pasting my text in.  The text is usually only a few pages, and takes less than a second to paste into other applications (gedit window, web window, etc).  What is vim doing with all those clock cycles and how can I make this more efficient?\n\nA: Based on a suggestion from the maintainer after filing a bug report, it seems this problem is caused by the syntax highlighter.  Disabling syntax highlighting temporarily (:set syntax=off) fixes this, though having to do both that and :set paste, and then toggle each back again is rather annoying (yes, I know I could map the commands in .vimrc.  It is still annoying).   Pasting also runs faster in gvim than in vim.  Not sure why.  \nSo, current answer is \"turn off syntax highlighting\"...  \n\nA: The correct way to paste text in vim is with the p command (from normal mode).\nTo paste from the xclipboard (the 'middle-click' clipboard), you should use \"*p. To paste from the Ctrl+v clipbaord, use \"+p.\n\nA: You should probably file a bug report against vim on this one.\n", "Q: HP mini 5102 Ethernet does not work after suspend on Lubuntu 12.10 \nPossible Duplicate:\nNo wireless after resuming from suspend? \n\nEthernet works fine after system is rebooted\nThe onboard card is seen in 'lspci' as:\n43:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd.

I would like to start virtual machines in headless mode. The advantage: I can logoff from the desktop, and the machine will continue to run. However, starting the virtual machine blocks the Terminal from closing. Is there a clever solution to have everything like a service in the background?

To illustrate my misunderstanding, I have four Upstart jobs that look like the following:\nJob 1:\nstart on local-filesystems\n\ntask\n\nscript\n    echo \"job 1 ran\" >> /tmp/job1\nend script\n\nJob 2:\nstart on (local-filesystems and net-device-added)\n\ntask\n\nscript\n    echo \"job 2 ran\" >> /tmp/job2\nend script\n\nJob 3:\nstart on (local-filesystems and bluetooth-device-added)\n\ntask\n\nscript\n    echo \"job 3 ran\" >> /tmp/job3\nend script\n\nJob 4:\nstart on local-filesystems or (local-filesystems and net-device-added) or (local-filesystems and bluetooth-device-added)\n\ntask\n\nscript\n    echo \"job 4 ran\" >> /tmp/job4\nend script\n\nI expect the following file contents after a reboot:\n/tmp/job1:\njob 1 ran\n\n/tmp/job2\njob 2 ran\n\n/tmp/job3\njob 3 ran\n\n/tmp/job4\njob 4 ran\njob 4 ran\njob 4 ran\n\nI expect Job 4 to have ran three times because it can be started by three separate sets of events, all of which occur as proven by the other jobs. But my expectations are incorrect; the files actually contain the following:\n/tmp/job1:\njob 1 ran\n\n/tmp/job2\njob 2 ran\n\n/tmp/job3\njob 3 ran\n\n/tmp/job4\njob 4 ran\n\nWhy is job4 only being run once, even though all three sets of events are occurring? Is there any way to achieve the behavior of running this job whenever any of the signals occur, regardless of how many times the job actually runs? If it helps, I edited it to print out the $UPSTART_EVENTS variable to see what events are causing job 4, and it's local-filesystems.\nTo summarize: I would like job 4 to run on the local-filesystems event, AND on the net-device-added event (as long as local_filesystems has occurred as well), AND on the bluetooth-device-added event (as long as local_filesystems has occurred). How do I make that happen?\nThank you!\n\nA: start on Only changes the job's goal to start from stop. If the job is already in start, the job is not latched and does nothing with the events in start on.\nIf you wanted it to run multiple times anyway, you can add this:\ninstance $UPSTART_EVENTS\n\nWith that upstart will run an instance of the job for each event pair that is matched in start on.\n\nA: The obvious, although inelegant solution is to create 3 different upstart jobs.  You'd just use the jobs 1-3 you created above. I looked into this some in a VM and that's the best I could come up with. I someone has a more elegant solution I'd love to see it.\n\nA: The answer is quite simple, you can't respond to multiple events if the job is already running on behalf of any of those conditions. Upstart doesn't record and replay events. If your job is running due to event A, and event A starts, event B occurs, which said job could also respond to. There is no queue that will save event B and replay it to every job that was previously running to evaluate said event again. After all, this is init, and the goal of init scripts is usually to run once.\nThe bootchart will readily show what signals are emitted concurrently.\nYou can verify this yourself by configuring your job to respond to an event, make it do something simple like sleep 30s, then while the job is running, emit another (initctl emit foo) event. Once the job has finished running the first time it will not run again.\n\"To summarize: I would like job 4 to run on the local-filesystems event, AND on the net-device-added event (as long as local_filesystems has occurred as well), AND on the bluetooth-device-added event (as long as local_filesystems has occurred). How do I make that happen?\"\nhttp://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#starting-a-job\nIt actually spells this sort of conditional execution out quite clearly. That doesn't mean however it will run more than once.

You can resize the space allocated via the instructions given at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ResizeandDuplicateWubiDisk. The minimum you should set the installation size to is probably 5GB as you'll easily use up this much space with just random downloads and programs you install.\nAlternate Route: You could install Ubuntu on a separate partition. To do this you must place a live CD or a live USB into its respective place with respect to your computer such that it can be mounted onto it. When you do this you must reboot and then from there proceed to install Ubuntu. In the case of Dell Vostro 3500 (my pc) at least, as I'm unaware of other PCs, you have to press F12 before it'll allow you to install Ubuntu on a separate partition.\n\nA: This is the size that the installation of Ubuntu will be allowed to take up; I would recommend increasing it if you can spare the space. You will need at least 5GB or so.\n", "Q: Are 64-bit and 32-bit versions included in the same ISO? http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/\nDoes Ubuntu now release 64-bit and 32-bit under the same ISO?\n\nA: No, they are separate images.  You should select the version that you want from the download page.  On the page you linked to, amd64 denotes the iso for 64bit, and those with i386 are 32 bit iso files.\nYou should also get the md5sum for the iso that you download and check that is correct before burning the image to a CD/DVD or USB stick.\nIf you have an unreliable internet connection then you might want to get the files from one of the official BitTorrent downloads because it will have extra error checking and the ability to recover and restart.\n", "Q: Unable to boot Ubuntu 10.04 LTS after hibernation I have Ubuntu 10.04 installed on a desktop.\nI hibernated the desktop and since then I have not been able to boot Ubuntu.\nThe (USB) keyboard seems deactivated and doesn't show any lights when I turn on the desktop.\nI set a BIOS password but can't get beyond the prompt for password because I can't input the password with the keyboard (so booting won't occur).\nUnfortunately, I can't boot from a USB to reinstall Ubuntu.\nIs there a solution that is beginner-friendly because I am not very familiar with using command terminal/lines.\n\nA: If the keyboard isn't working in the BIOS stage then it's unlikely that the issue is being caused by the operating system.  \nHere are some things you might try: unplugging the computer/plugging it back in, different USB port, different keyboard.  If all else fails you can pull your CMOS battery to reset your BIOS settings (hence disabling the BIOS password).\n", "Q: IBus icon is missing at startup?

I've researched answers here, but haven't seen a question that resembles mine exactly: \nUbuntu install and dual Boot with Windows 8 UEFI\nUEFI hardware and dual booting with windows\nUbuntu 12.10 wont boot \nSpecifically, I'm pondering installing a fresh install of Windows 8 (for game purposes), and a fresh install of 12.10 and dual booting them.  I'm not sure if UEFI is hardware specific or software specific, and I'm worried if I try to implement the dual boot I'm going to run into UEFI issues and have to go through the grief of getting things up and running by following a long and tedious procedure.  Can I, starting with Windows 8, then install 12.10 without too much hassle? \nMy current hardware config is:\nMicrostar Motherboard 7514 with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor.  The drive I'm thinking of using is a Western Digital TB drive, new out of the box.  As always, any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.\n\nA: \"Too much hassle\" is of course subjective.\nUEFI is relatively new. This means that software support in Linux distributions is still a bit rough around the edges, and documentation and help is less profuse than is the case for BIOS-mode installs. That said, installing both Windows 8 and Linux is possible. It helps to know a bit about EFI and EFI boot loaders. My own EFI Boot Loaders for Linux Web page may be a good place to start learning.\nSince it sounds like you're building a computer from scratch rather than buying a system in a store with Windows 8 pre-loaded, another option is to install in BIOS/legacy boot mode. The vast majority of UEFI motherboards support BIOS/legacy-mode booting, and using this option can help you manage in the short term.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that you want to install both OSes in the same boot mode (EFI or BIOS/legacy). Although mixing boot modes is possible (particularly Windows in EFI and Linux in BIOS), it's awkward to set up and manage in this way. Unfortunately, most installers don't make it obvious which boot mode they're using, and therefore which way they'll set up the computer. For Windows, if you prepartition the disk, you can use the partition table type as a guide: If you set up Master Boot Record (MBR) partitions, Windows will install to the disk only if you use a BIOS-mode boot; and if you use a GUID Partition Table (GPT), Windows will install only if you use an EFI-mode boot. Linux is more flexible, which can actually cause problems for a dual-boot system. I recommend you drop to a shell and look for the directory /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if not, you've probably booted in BIOS mode.\nOne final tip: When installing Linux in EFI mode, use a separate /boot partition, preferably with ReiserFS, ext2fs, or ext3fs. (FAT also works, but most Linux installers won't let you use FAT on /boot.) The reason is that there are EFI drivers for these filesystems, so using them to store your kernel can increase your options for boot loader configuration, even if the default installation doesn't make use of these options.\n\nA: Can I, starting with Windows 8, then install 12.10 without too much hassle? \n\nYes you can.

This works perfectly when I execute the script as follows ./script.sh. However when the script is executed as a cron expression everyday I get an output from stderr saying 'play: command not found'. \nHence I did some digging on my own and here are my findings :\n\n\n*\n\n*echo $PATH when I am on the shell shows that I have /usr/local/bin available to me hence I can successfully execute the command play status\n\n*however when I type in sudo bash and then echo $PATH I do not have the path /usr/local/bin anymore.

In this case however it probably makes sense to make sure that all users have this in their path and for this you can use the edit line above and just put it at the end of the file /etc/bash.bashrc\n\nA: I would recommend you simply move the symbolic link to /usr/bin.\n", "Q: Recovery from hell - undeleting partition overwritten by Xubuntu 12.10 installer?

I've had a 128GB toshiba SSD on my T400 and have just bought a new 240GB intel SSD (335 series). I want to have a clean new dual boot install of ubuntu and windows 7.\nWith my SATA II system, the new intel SSD should probably be 1.3-1.5 times faster on buffer read and at least twice faster on cached read. Now I need to know which one to mount for my home directory and which one to use for the OS installs.\nOption 1) Use faster SSD for windows+linux+home and use the other SSD for extra space.\nOption 2) Use faster SSD for windows+linux and mound home on the other SSD.\nOption 3) User slower SSD for windows+linux and mount home on the other SSD.\nOption 4) Some type of RAID array setup.\nTypical programs on linux: Chrome, Thunderbird (heavy), occasional torrent download.\nWindows: Starcraft II.\n\nA: I'd use the slower ssd too. Ubuntu boots fast anyway so it really doesn't matter which you choose. You would not notice the difference anyway (unless you do some benchmarks).\n\nA: I'd use the slower SSD for home.  Most of what's stored there are config files and personal files (mp3s,docs,etc).  That leaves the faster to run your OS and applications.

I plan to buy a Intel 330 SSD (encrypts all data whit AES 128) and use it in a Asus EeePC 1215N (supports ATA password) whit the latest *ubuntu and Windows 7. I'm a fair paranoid user and security mathers but I also want a good performance and no trouble. The important data will be in ~ and is not needet to be accessible from Windows. But to have everything encrypted would be welcome.\nIs it better to use a encrypted home or simply set a ATA password (the data on the SSD is encrypted by the device regardless)? Which is more secure and easier to handle?\nI'm specially worried about suspend to RAM / drive (is it working and still secure?). I know suspend to drive is not possible whit a encrypted swap (I need a swap). And I read about hot swap attacks to Selfencrypted devices (but on this Laptop the SSD is under the keyboard and hard to reach).\nWhit a encrypted home and swap, how much would be the performance loss (as this device gains speed through compressing the data)?\nIs it possible to uses the ATA password to login the usere?\nThanks for any thoughts!\n\nA: You might want to look at my other answer about full disk encryption. It doesn't cover your Windows partition, though.

Initially, I had problems with getting the NVidia drivers to work correctly. When I reboot after the driver installation the Ubuntu dash doesn't appear, just the wallpaper. I'm aware that this is a current issue and I have read other peoples solutions and still can't successfully get the proprietary drivers to work.

I just can't get my Three Ireland mifi dongle to work at all. When I plug it in, it only recognizes it as a storage devise. Any ideas on how to establish a permanent connection to this mifi dongle? I'm in Ireland and running a Dell Inspiron 1520 with 3GB of RAM and using the Huawei E586 mifi device. I really want to continue using this OS, but is everything this complicated to get up and running on it?\n\nA: You can resolve this by:\n(a.) Plugging in a USB WiFi adapter to your Dell laptop, or using its inbuilt WiFi capability, OR\n(b.) Finding the correct USB mode-switch settings, so that it (your USB device) switches back to being a modem (and not just a storage device).\n\nSome Background:\nBack in Windows-land, someone had the 'bright' idea that, as all devices need a 'new' driver, any newly plugged-in device should first 'pretend' to be a USB storage device - and attempt to auto-load the driver (stored for that purpose on the device). Then, when the driver starts up it knows to send a command to switch the USB device back into being 'whatever'.\nHowever, Linux (and in particular Ubuntu) does not need lots of new drivers. More importantly, having a device attempt to auto-load a driver (or any executable code) is plain dangerous - and may also breach security policy and/or be prevented by anti-virus software (or similar protective measures).\nInstead Ubuntu (and other Linux variants) provides the 'USB mode switch' function, complete with a large (and growing) list of brands / devices, and the data needed to control them. Unless you are using an unusual (or new) device, a simple update will usually resolve these sorts of issues.\n\nA: Drivers off the Huawei site worked perfectly for me!

Awesome.\n@define-color bg-grey #222;\n@define-color active #313131;\n\nTerminalWindow .notebook {\n    border: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    color: #fff;\n    background-color: shade(@active, 1);\n}\n\nTerminalWindow .notebook tab:active {\n    background-color: shade(@active,1);\n}\n\nTerminalWindow .notebook tab {\n    border-radius: 0px;\n    padding: 3px;\n    background-color: shade(@bg-grey, 1);\n}\n\n\n\nA: Thanks @topless, \nalso edited it further to look like this,\nnote the border-radius: 0, to avoid white space\n@define-color bg-grey #222;\n@define-color active #300A24;\n\nTerminalWindow .notebook {\n  border: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  color: #eee;\n  background-color: shade(@active-grey, 1);\n}\n\nTerminalWindow .notebook tab:active {\n  background-color: shade(@active, 1);\n}\n\nTerminalWindow .notebook tab {\n  border-radius: 0px;\n  background-color: shade(@bg-grey, 1);\n}\n\n\n\nA: After some messing around, I figured it out.\nEdit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/gnome-terminal.css and add:\n TerminalWindow .notebook {\n   padding: 0;\n   border-width: 0;\n }\n\nBug found on this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-terminal/+bug/694468\n\nA: Well its a good practice in general not to modify the original files but override their values according to your preferences.\nIf you don't already have it, create or open a gtk.css file in this path \n~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\n\nPaste the following code, close all terminals and start one new. \n@define-color bg-grey #222;\n@define-color active-grey #333;\n@define-color border-grey #555;\n\n\nTerminalWindow .notebook {\n  border: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  color: #eee;\n  background-color: shade(@active-grey, 1);\n}\n\nTerminalWindow .notebook tab:active {\n  border: 1px solid @border-grey;\n  background-color: shade(@active-grey, 1);\n}\n\nTerminalWindow .notebook tab {\n  background-color: shade(@bg-grey, 1);\n}\n\nNow, not only it will remove the borders as you intended but will also \"fit\" better with the dark background, my eyes \"hurt\" with the light gray. The result when you have multiple tabs it should look like this, which of course you can customize it by tampering the color variables according to your preferences.\n\n\nA: You can either try another theme, configure Ambiance to your likings, or get one of these ( from Ubuntu software center):\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminator\n\n*xterm\n\n*Roxterm\n\n*Tilda\n\n*Guake\n\n*...\n\n", "Q: Unable to install openjdk6 due to unmet dependencies I tried to install openjdk6 on 12.04 LTS, with the command: \nsudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre\nbut got the following error:\nReading package lists...

I can not use chkconfig tools in Ubuntu 12.10\nIt's a very useful tools to configure the service to autostart or not. Why is it no longer available?\n\nA: The Upstart equivalent of chkconfig is the update-rc.d. There's some info on how to use it in the UbuntuBootupHowto linked in L. D. James's answer.\nAdmittedly, this tool is anything but friendly; it tends to expose the ugly underbelly of SysV init with all it's gory runlevel and priority blackmagic. I have almost never managed to get it to do what I want in the first go. chkconfig did a fantastic job of abstracting all those numbers away and providing a simple, usable interface that was loved by all. Nevertheless, it was always lipstick on a pig.\nIt's a brave new world and I would suggest you put in some time towards learning how Upstart works so that you can wire new jobs using that. For existing packages/applications that still provide you with SysV init scripts, update-rc.d should allow you to do everything that chkconfig did, except for one usecase. update-rc.d provides no clean way to see what the current status of a given service is, i.e., there is no equivalent of chkconfig --list. For this particular case, I'd suggest ls -l /etc/rc*.d/*${service_name}.\nHTH\nUpdate: 12-June-2013\nThe answer at https://askubuntu.com/a/161893/111294 points to a more palatable alternative- sysv-rc-conf.\nUpdate: 28-July-2013\nHmm... it appears that the OP has already answered here (https://askubuntu.com/a/277732/111294) suggesting sysv-rc-conf. Can't see how I missed that, have upvoted that answer now.\n\nA: sysv-rc-conf is an alternate option for Ubuntu.\nThe usage is almost the same.\nTo install:\nsudo apt-get install sysv-rc-conf\n\nTo configure apache2 to start on boot\nsysv-rc-conf apache2 on\n\nequivalent chkconfig command\nchkconfig apache2 enable\n\nTo check runlevels apache2 is configured to start on\nsysv-rc-conf --list apache2\n\nequivalent chkconfig command\nchkconfig --list apache2\n\n\nA: chkconfig is a redhat-ism. In Ubuntu we use upstart instead of sysvinit as used by redhat.\n\nA: on 13.10, none of the above 'solutions' work. Ran sysv-rc-conf, update-rc.d. Nada. sysv-rc-conf says bluetooth is off but it still runs. meh\nSays it has been converted to upstart but nothing on how to disable the daemon, where the configuation for upstart is, etc, etc. \nSo, digging around, you can edit /etc/init/bluetooth.conf and just comment things out, presumably only the following is necessary (though I commented anything that looks relevant):\n# exec /usr/sbin/bluetoothd\nThis will probably break with an upgrade but at least the bloody thing is off for a while.\n\nA: As of 12.04, chkconfig could be installed using sudo apt-get install chkconfig.\nI would recommend using Upstart. \nJobservice, along with jobs-admin is a GUI based tool for handling some upstart scripts if that is your preference. It can be installed from the software center or by running sudo apt-get install jobservice jobs-admin from a terminal. \nIf I recall, there did not appear to be an easy way to add new jobs from the GUI.\n\nA: Else install chkconfig from Debian packages pool : \nhttps://packages.debian.org/sid/chkconfig\n\nA: \nWhy is chkconfig no longer available in Ubuntu?\n\nWell, there is some history behind. chkconfig is connected with UNIX System V or SysV (pronounced: \"System Five\").\nSince then, Ubuntu switched to Upstart, and then again it switched to systemd.\nsystemd uses systemctl which reflects what was chkconfig to SysV.\n\nFrom the man page :\n\nsystemctl may be used to introspect and control the state of the \"systemd\" system and service manager. Please refer to systemd(1) for an introduction into the basic concepts and functionality\n         this tool manages.\n\n", "Q: Launcher still missing after installing nVidia driver I've asked this question before but I'm still stuck.

I have one of these, a GE Force 610GT.\nThrough a number of posts, I have found a process that reliably installs the updated nVidia drivers that do work very well with the nVidia drivers. You will need your Ubuntu installation CD.\nIf you go to this web-page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/fballem/Software%2012.04, you will see a set of instructions for installation of Ubuntu 12.04\nIf you put your CD in and reboot your system, you should be able to pickup the instructions at Step 6.

Yesterday I had two NTFS partitions on my drive. One on which Windows 7 was installed (C Drive) and the other contained my data (D Drive).\nDuring Ubuntu installation I choose to install Ubuntu and erase my existing OS. When Ubuntu installed, I was shocked to see no partition. All my data was gone. I must have done something wrong in selecting my option during installation.\nIs there any way I can recover my D Drive?\n\nA: I saw questions like that 2 times today:\nYes. You have lost them.\nIf you are good at linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*DO NOT USE UBUNTU YOU JUST INSTALLED!

My computer is no longer supported and my computer is now trying to get me to upgrade to 12.10. But I want to upgrade to 12.04. Can I upgrade to 12.04 using the update manager  or do I have to use a bootable disk? And will it be fine?\n\nA: I think there are 2 possible ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can download the Ubuntu 12.04 ISO-Image an use this for upgrade.\n\n*You can set the update-manager to check for LTS-Versions. You find an options button in the Update Manager and select the tab Update, in the bottom should be a list, which versions should be checked.\n\nA: You need the bootable disk, or at least the ISO file locally.\n\nOnline (using Update Manager), you can only 'upgrade' to 12.04 (from 11.04) after first installing 11.10 ..\n", "Q: How to write 2 iso file on one DVD How to write ubuntu (iso) and super grub disk(iso) on one DVD?\nI want to boot them.\nThanks\n\nA: This is theoretically impossible - an ISO file represents the phyisical layout of the filesystem exactly as it would be written to disk. Therefore two ISO files could easily contain two different filesystems - how would an ISO image burner \"merge\" the two incompatible filesystems?\nEven if the filesystems in the two ISO files were identical, don't forget that an ISO file can contain a boot image as well. How could two boot images be merged?\nInstead, you could try opening the ISO file with archivemount :\nmkdir mnt\narchivemount some_iso_file.iso mnt\nxdg-open mnt\n\nThose two commands will mount the archive and open it in Nautilus (or your default file manager). You can then begin copying files out of the archive to another location.\nGrub can be written to a CD. You might be able to figure out how to create a bootable CD that contains the contents of both ISO files and can boot either image.\n", "Q: Grub errors during UEFI dual boot for Windows 8 (can't find command 'drivemap') I have got a newly bought ASUS N56V with Windows 8 preinstalled.\nI needed to install Ubuntu so i partitioned the disk and after having disabled the Secure Boot option from Windows 8 i successfully installed Ubuntu 12.10 from a Live USB. The problem is that if i try to access both to Windows 8 (loader) and Windows Recovery System (loader) from the GRUB menu, these two errors show: can't find command 'drivemap' and invalid EFI file path and it goes back to the grub menu.\nIn conclusion I do not have access to my Windows 8 partition but can only use Ubuntu.

I followed the instructions here:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB2#Microsoft_Windows_installed_in_UEFI-GPT_mode\nThe curveball is that I could not edit grub.cfg directly, as on my machine it is generated by the grub-mkconfig command. I added the 'menuentry \"Windows ...\" { ... }' to /etc/grub.d/40_custom\nThe downside is that the windows entry that works is below all the windows entries that don't.

To fix this, you should save all your data (since you say that Windows still recognize that mess) then go to the Disk Utils, and click \"Format Drive\", then select FAT32 from the options and Voila your driver works in Ubuntu and Windows.\n", "Q: Running the Ubuntu Kernel and OS on custom processor This is hardly a theoretical question as many have done this, albeit there's very little information on the underlying processes. \nI'm developing a custom MIPS-based processor on which I would like to run ubuntu. I'm quite baffled as to what to do next after you've designed the instruction set and the computer architecture itself. I need to be able to run a kernel and OS but how does it all tie in? \nAt the moment I'm researching into designing a compiler for the linux kernel to generate the appropriate assembly language. Is that a good way to go? What do I need to do after that?\n\nA: To have any chance of getting this ported you first need GCC to be able to produce the object code for your target CPU, the kernel was written using GCC and we also assume that GCC is used to build a lot of the user space applications too.  \nYou then also need to write the architecture specific parts in the kernel for your CPU and platform.  If you have based your CPU on existing MIPS designs then this makes life a little bit easier, for example the virtual memory management handling may already exist for your target CPU if you are lucky, however you may need to write this from scratch if it is a new design.  \nIf you are writing your own compiler then you need to make it support all the GCC specific extensions which the kernel supports, and there are quite a few.  It is most probably easier to port GCC than write your own from scratch.\nPorting the kernel is the first step, but for a new CPU you need to think about how you will design the way user space does system calls into the kernel and you will need to write a system call hander for the kernel and also the user space C library system call shims too.  You will find that there is a tremendous amount of effort required just to get to the point where you are able to get the user space first process init running.  You will then need to cross compile all the core libraries and utilities just to get a basic system booting.  It's non-trivial.  The first step is to be able to build tools like busybox that give you a minimally set of Linux tools to be able to get a shell running with a minimal set of tools to interact with the system.\nBack in the days of the 2.2 kernel I ported Linux and busybox to a new architecture (a VLIW media processor) as part of a research project (which got canned) and it took about a year to get to the point where I could boot the kernel, run init and start up busybox on a serial TTY. And this was not counting the effort to get a stable toolchain.  Just be warned, it can take some effort.\n", "Q: VLC lagging while running HD videos My vlc player keeps lagging while i play hd videos.

I wanted to run 12.04 (32 bit), 12.10 (64 bit) and Windows 7 with full system encryption on either one of the Ubuntu installations and preferably a shared /home partition (at least the data with encryption). \nI have no idea how to go about it or for that matter if it's even possible. So now I get to my question: Can you please point me in the right direction or get me started?\n\nA: Encryption for both Ubuntu would be easy with ecryptfs (encrypted home folder, on a per user basis). Just make /home a separate partition and mount it in both Ubuntu installations. Name the user the same and give them the same password. Click “encrypt home directory” on installation.\nAn encryption for both Ubuntu and Windows seems harder. The only thing I can think of is TrueCrypt, but that will probably not work as neatly as ecryptfs.\nSo I would probably say that you install all operating systems with full disk encryption (dm-crypt/LVM for Linux, TrueCrypt, PGP or Bitlocker for Windows). Then you create a data partition which is encrypted with TrueCrypt. When you log in, mount that data partition.\n", "Q: How can I backup Gnome-shell extensions I'm creating my post-instalation script for my Ubuntu 12.04 LST x64 and I would like to know how can I backup current installed extensions. Can I create own extension package to easy install? Is here any way how can I install all my extensions with (only one) command over the terminal?\nThanks all for answers. I apologize for my bad english. I hope you will understand me a little.\n\nA: Your extensions should be installed in a directory in your home. Open your Home, press Ctrl+H to show hidden files, then navigate to .local/share/gnome-shell/extensions and make a backup of all the folders inside it.\nProvided you will be using the same version of Gnome you're using now, you can simply copy all the backed-up folders in a new Home to have your extensions again.\n", "Q: How to diagnose and fix Kernel Panic Fatal Machine Check error? I have got a new Samsung Series 7 laptop with dual boot setup for Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10. A fine machine comparable to a Macbook Pro. The Ubuntu installation was quite a hassle, but with the help of Boot Repair finally it seemed to work. Or so I thought. Windows 8 starts fine, but if I want to start Ubuntu regularly the following Machine Check Exception error occurs, quite similar to this one\n[Hardware Error] CPU 1: Machine Check Exception: 5 Bank 6\n[Hardware Error] RIP !inexact! 33 <00007fab2074598a>\n[Hardware Error] TSC 95b623464c ADDR fe400 MISC 3880000086\n.. [similar messages for CPU 2,3 and 0] ..\n[Hardware Error] Machine Check: Processor context corrupt\nKernel panic - not syncing: Fatal Machine Check\nRebooting in 30 seconds\n\nKernel panic does not sound good. Then it starts to reboot, and the second boot trial often works. Is it a Kernel or driver problem? The laptop has an Intel Core i7 processor. I already deactivated Hyperthreading in the BIOS, but it does not seem to help :-(\nI also disabled the Execute Disable Bit (EDB) flag in the BIOS. EDB is an Intel hardware-based security feature that can help reduce system exposure to viruses and malicious code. Since I disabled it, the error did occur less frequently, but it still appears occasionally :-( It seems to be the same error as described here and here. Maybe a Samsung specific Kernel problem? A similar error also happens on a Samsung Ultrabook Series 9 (which seems to be kernel bugs 49161 and 47121).\nAt my Samsung Series 7, it still occurs for instance during booting on battery after \"Checking battery state\". Perhaps anyone else has an idea? These Kernel Panic errors are reallly annoying..\n\nA: According to section 15.9.1 in volume 3 of the Intel Architecture Software Developer Manual the Machine Check Exception 5 from the MSR_IA32_MCG_STATUS MSR indicates in internal parity error.   After reading the manual I am not sure which specific component bank 6 refers to, so I cannot determine where this physical error has occurred.\nThe error message indicates that bit 57 of the Machine Check Status MSR is set indicating that the internal processor state may well be corrupted by the error condition detected and that reliable restarting of the processor may not be possible. So at this point the Kernel has no real choice apart from stopping by using a kernel panic.\nAs things stand, this kind of error is rare.\nI am unsure why disabling the EBD can cause this issue.  Perhaps it is just a co-incidence.  Does this panic happen frequently with EBD enabled?  Incidentally, which processor model do you have? .. to find out, use:  \ncat /proc/cpuinfo \n\n\nA: Slowly but surely.. here we go again. I would like to solve these Kernel Panic errors which occur on both Samsung Series 7 and Series 9 laptops! At least on my machine :-) In this Kernel bug report 47121 someone reported that it maybe helps to set the \"OS Mode Selection\" in the BIOS to \"UEFI OS\", instead to \"UEFI and CSM OS\". The packages and libraries that are loaded seem to be different. I needed to switch to \"UEFI and CSM OS\" to install Ubuntu in the first place. Now I have to switch it off again. But maybe it helps.. After I switched it back to \"UEFI OS\" it booted ten times without errors. If the Kernel Panic does not occur again, then this seems to be the anwser, and I will mark the question as answered. Hopefully..\n\nA: modify /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf with \"blacklist samsung-laptop\".  Reboot.  Problem solved; this will be fixed via a kernel patch (hopefully) soon.\n", "Q: Where to get Aegisub? Where can I get new Aegisub?

I needed to run convert with a lot of images at the same time. The command took quite a while but this doesn't bother me.\nThe issue is that this command rendered my computer unusable while the command was running (for about 15 minutes).\nSo is it possible to throttle the command by limiting resources (processor and memory) to the command, directly from the command line? This can only work if I add something to the same line before pressing Enter because once I start the process the computer slows so much that it is impossible for example to switch to \"System monitor\" and reduce priority.\nEdit: top and iotop results\nI managed to run top and sudo iotop >iotop.txt while doing one of these convert operations.

I found a way around this by running sudo swapoff -a followed by sudo swapon -a\n\nOK, so that means you were exhausting the available RAM on your system, which means you're just plain trying to run too many convert processes at once.  We'd need to look at your actual syntax in spawning convert to advise, but basically, you need to make sure you don't try to open more simultaneous processes than you have the RAM to comfortably handle.\nSince you state what's causing this is convert *.tif blah.pdf, what's happening is that the content of every single TIF and its conversion to PDF are getting stuffed into RAM at once.  What you need to do is split the job up so that this isn't necessary.  One possibility that leaps to mind is instead doing something like find . -iname '*.tif' | xargs -I% convert % %.pdf, then using pdftk or something like it to glue all the individual pdfs together.  If you really want to get fancy, and you have a multicore CPU, this also affords you the chance to write a small script to run conversions in batches of n, where n is your number of cores, and get the whole thing done significantly faster. :)\npdftk how-to: http://ubuntuhowtos.com/howtos/merge_pdf_files  (basically boils down to sudo apt-get install pdftk; pdftk *.pdf cat output merged.pdf)\n\nA: Here's a pretty good article on using a program called cpulimit to limit the cpu usage of any process:\nhttp://maketecheasier.com/limit-cpu-usage-of-any-process-in-linux/2010/09/22\nThe problem is like you said finding the PID of the convert process after it has started. \nAfter starting convert if you can still type commands in the terminal you can run ps aux | grep convert to find it's PID, then sudo cpulimit -p PID -l CPU% to start throttling.\nOr if starting convert also locks up your terminal the article shows you how you can run cpulimit as a background daemon that will automatically monitor and throttle any processes over a certain amount of CPU usage.  Good luck!\n\nA: man nice, and if you need I/O throttling man ionice.\nLet's look at some simple examples.\nThrottling CPU usage:\nyou@box:/$ nice -n 10 /usr/bin/convert blah.gif blah.jpg\n\nFrom your description, however, CPU usage is almost certainly not your real problem here.  More likely, you're having severe I/O contention.\nThrottling Disk Usage:\nyou@box:/$ ionice -c2 -n7 /usr/bin/convert blah.gif blah.jpg\n\n-c2 is \"best effort\", and -n7 is the lowest \"best effort\" priority.  So, this will throttle the job to lower I/O priority than most other things on the system.\nyou@box:/$ ionice -c3 /usr/bin/convert blah.gif blah.jpg\n\n-c3 (no priority level necessary) means \"Idle only\".  Jobs set to -c3 ONLY take up otherwise idle disk scheduling time, for virtually no impact at all on the system - but potentially a considerably longer execution time for your job, depending on how busy the rest of the system gets.\n", "Q: How do I install a Lexmark Pro200 printer driver for Ubuntu 12.10?

That will contain a comma-separated list of packages it depends on, so install them all manually. For example, if you have this (I know, it's kind of ridiculous):\nDepends: debconf (>= 0.5) | debconf-2.0, firefox, ia32-libs | flashplugin-installer, chromium (= 12)\n\nFirst, interpret it:\n\n\n*\n\n*It wants either debconf, greater than or equal to (>=) 0.5, OR (|) debconf-2.0 (any version will do, according to the package), so install either one of them\n\n*It wants firefox, and any version will do\n\n*It wants ia32-libs OR flashplugin-installer\n\n*It wants chromium, at exactly version 12.\n\n\nThen install what it needs (notice chromium=12. That tells apt-get to fetch version 12 instead of the latest. Of course, the ubuntu repositories don't hold version 12, but you get the point):\nsudo apt-get install debconf-2.0 ifrefox ia32-libs chromium=12\n\nThen you can install your package:\nsudo dpkg -i file.deb\n\nHope this helps!!\n\nA: An alternative method is to use the Generic Installer.  This is a binary which you can run on your system as root, and will install crossover under /opt/cxoffice.\nIf you still have problems at that point run:\n/opt/cxoffice/bin/cxdiag --debug\n\nThis will check all of crossover's dependencies and print out a report which shows what it can find and what is missing.  If something is still missing you will need to either install it or link the .so file to the right version.\n", "Q: Do I have to do a new installation?

Please consider reading that post to make sure you avoid the problem. In short, sudo appears to have been programmed not to work at all if the permissions of a sudoers file is not 0440. The visudo command creates files with the right permissions. By using a different method, you could temporarily wind up without administrative access (because the default umask does not create files with 0440 permissions).\nSelect the recovery console during the GRUB boot sequence. You can then change the permissions of the offending file so that all is normal after the next reboot. Or, if it's just a typo, you can fix that, too.\n\nA: Easiest solution is booting into recovery mode by pressing Shift before the Ubuntu logo appears and then edit /etc/sudoers using visudo in the rescue shell.\n", "Q: PacketTracer .pkt file opening problem A few days back I installed .bin packet tracer using terminal.\nIt got installed successfully and is opening too from the desktop icon.\nProblem is when I save a .pkt file that file doesn't open.\n\nA: For the time being, I found that opening the main packet tracer and then opening the saved files by ctrl+o works....\nlet c, if we have any other solution\n", "Q: How do I install the X.org Radeon/ATI driver?

The printer works normally when I connect it directly to the computer, but I don't know how to set it up in Ubuntu when I connect it to the wireless router. I can also connect and print to the printer on a Windows computer using the software provided with the router. I think the software for Windows uses TCP to create a virtual USB bus and the printer is accessed using the same printer installation as when it is plugged directly into the computer.\nI don't know what protocol the router uses. I've seen the question Printing to a printer attached to a network USB hub, but I'm not sure if my router uses the same protocol. I tried the instructions the answer gave using my router's IP address, but when I try to print a test page it says copying data then says printer is in use. In the printer queue window it says not connected.\nI've also tried typing my router's IP address into the \"Find Network Printer\" section of the add printer dialog, but nothing comes up in the search.\nHow can I access a printer connected to the router using Ubuntu?\nThanks.\n\nA: You need go to  /localhost:631/ and follow my step\n\nclick \"Add Printer\"\n\nYou will see printer on \"Discovered Network Printers:\" but i havent .\nand manager will help you\nNOTE : if answer is true please confirm it . mewbies can forget it  \n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 unstable Display, Flickering I use Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe Text character on my screen while on the Internet s too small, so I decided to adjust the display to give larger characters. This caused the screen to become very unstable, once I am logged it the screen begins to flicker. I am now using the guest login.\nHow can I read just the display to first make it stable and secondly to have larger text characters?\nThanks in anticipation,\nElton.\n\nA: A simple solution would be Gnome-Tweak-Tool, also known in the software center as \"Advanced Settings\". Now you may use this to change the font size affecting the software center, however unfortunately all other applications as well. A recommended way to preform the font change would be to open the settings, change the font size, and then when done with the software center, return it to it's original form, or however you prefer it. If you can't get the application from the software center, due to the small size of the font just paste the following into your terminal - \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nOr, click the button below to install for Ubuntu!\n\nHere is what Advanced Settings should appear as, simply click the font size next to the default font to make changes.\n\nWell, you don't really want to mess with the other settings I'm assuming, (Graphics Drivers, or Screen Resolution) But, just to voice other solutions, you could start by seeing if this is the graphics driver, I personally use the open source one because I have no other choice than binary blobs, or the screen resolution could be toned down to make the text appear larger...\nNow, as if this wasn't already long enough, Mijyn here wrote a tutorial on resetting the x configuration settings. This could also fix screen flickering. To start, we want to:\nPress \"Ctrl + Alt + F3\"\nBy doing this, you're opening a virtual console, the appearance may look like DOS, but essentially it's a terminal window, gone full screen with root access. It should ask you to log in, with your password. Now the password will not appear in the window, but don't worry, it's still registering. \nsudo rm -f /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nsudo rm -f xorg.conf*\nsudo service lightdm stop\nsudo service gdm stop\nsudo service kdm stop\nsudo service lxdm stop\nsudo service xdm stop\nsudo service wdm stop\nsudo Xorg -configure\n[ -f xorg.conf* ] && sudo mv xorg.conf* /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure $(dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' | grep \"^xserver\" | tr '\\n' ' ')\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nNow while this seems like a lot, you can copy and paste this into the virtual console, remember, the paste function when in terminal is \"Ctrl + Shift + V\" instead of the common \"Ctrl + V\" used pretty much everywhere else.\nYou'll now want to restart the computer. You can regain access to the desktop using \"Ctrl + Alt + F7\". This should reset the X configuration. \nIf you would like to view MiJyn's work, it is linked here.\nHope some of this can be of help!\n\nA: I wrote a tutorial a long time ago that might fix your issue (can't guarantee it though): http://lkubuntu.wordpress.com/2011/08/30/quick-and-easy-way-to-fix-x11-issues/\nI can't really copy the contents here as it would require copying the whole post here (and I don't want to do that, for relatively obvious reasons)\n", "Q: Installing BURG on 12.10 A while back I was dual booting win 7 and 12.04 and had BURG running just fine.

Now (many) files and (all) sub-folders on it are corrupted (...yeah, I know...). Is it possible to recover [ some | most | all ] of these files and folders?  \nI've been trying to help her by mounting the thumb-drive on my Ubuntu 12.10 laptop. The thumb-drive mounts under Ubuntu (12.10), and does list files at the top level (have not tried to access those top-level files, though), but indicates that it \"can't access /media/robert/CA71-F795/'folder-name': Input/output error\" for every folder at that level (..face-palm...).  \nNot a noob, so though I strenuously try to avoid making this kinda mistake myself, I am unfamiliar with recovery practices/procedures as a result.  Can anything be done to recover these files and folders?  What would you do? \nThanks for any/all [ help | advice | suggestions ].\n\nA: USB sticks are usually FAT filesystem, I'm not sure what tools there are that might repair FAT filesystem, but you might find that you can read most/all of the files just from Ubuntu (ignoring the I/O errors) then recreate the filesystem to copy them back.\nQuite often my partner brings Windows laptops home belonging to people she works with where the filesystems are knackered and Windows won't boot. Usually I can just boot a Ubunu live CD on them and even though you get lots of I/O errors at least Ubuntu will make a \"best effort\" to read the files where Windows seems less inclined to... so far I've always been able to recover the important stuff (photos, music, work documents etc.) for people.\nSo long as you don't try to write to the filesystem (you could even mount it read-only to be sure) it won't cause any further damage to just try to copy the files you need off there.\n\nA: First, you should probably disable automount temporarily on your system.  Start the program dconf-editor and navigate to org -> gnome -> desktop -> media handling and disable automount.\nTo help with the recovery you can make a bit copy of the thumbdrive (doesn't need to be mounted to do this)\ndd if=/dev/sdx of=~/usbdrive.img\nwhere sdx is the device in question.  You can then mount the image of the pendrive as read only on /mnt:\nmount -t vfat -o loop,ro,noexec ~/usbdrive.img /mnt\nIf you get errors but you are sure the file system is DOS (vfat) then you might need to repair the partition table before you can proceed.  Hopefully it's not that bad though.  You can now safely explore recovery options without even having the pendrive attached to the computer.\nSome programs you might want to look at are photorec and testdisk.  I can't give you much information on how to proceed with these because like you, I try not to put myself in this position, but I know from playing with them that they will try to identify valid partitions and the files on them, even if they have been deleted or scrambled.\nDon't forget to set automount back to your preference after you have performed the copy.\n", "Q: What is the difference between charms for Oneiric and Precise?

Since then, although I did never change my password, the whole authentication is not working properly anymore:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can log in at start, BUT\n\n*I can't install updates anymore (I type the password, and I get back the answer \"authentication attempt was unsuccessful\") and\n\n*I can't change my password anymore (same answer as above when I try to unlock the user-account)\n\n*when I'm AFK for more than 10 minutes, come back and the pc is locked, I cannot log in anymore (same as above, I guess, i did not write it down, but he does not get my password anymore)\n\n\nI read a bit here and there searching for similar problems, and although I kind of believe now that Ubuntu might have more than one password (right?), I still cannot understand why the same password which used to work for everything up to one week ago, is now \"half\" useless...\nthankful for any help to set everything alright again (and to understand whats going on as well),\nkind regards, Max\n\nA: First, let's try your account from the console.  WRITE DOWN THESE DIRECTIONS BEFORE BEGINNING - you won't be able to read from here once you start.\nPress Ctrl-Alt-F1.  This will bring you to a text only console.  Log in with your username and password.  Once you've accomplished that, do sudo -s, and give it your password again.  After doing that, press Press Ctrl-Alt-F7.  This will bring you back to the usual graphical screen you're used to.\nWere you able to log in at the shell?  Were you able to successfully sudo to root (did the prompt change to root@yourmachine:~#)?\nOK.  You've done this, and you cannot log in at all.  So, you will need to reset the password for your username.  First, try doing CtrlAltT to bring up the Terminal.  Type in passwd and hit enter.  Will it allow you to change your password?  If so, you should be good.  If not, you'll need to boot to single user mode in order to reset your password.\nIf you could not change your password, let's get into Recovery Mode.  Reboot the system, and at the GNU GRUB menu, press down arrow, and select (recovery mode) as shown here:\n\nNow, drop to root shell prompt:\n\nOK, now you'll need to remount your root filesystem read-write, and then you can change your password:\nroot@yourmachine:~# mount -o remount,rw /\nroot@yourmachine:~# passwd yourname\nEnter new UNIX password:\nRetype new UNIX password:\npasswd: password updated successfully\nroot@yourmachine:~# exit\n\nNOTE: you may be confused about what your actual username is - it's not necessarily the same thing you see at the Ubuntu login prompt!  For example, I see \"Jim Salter\" when I log into my workstation, but my actual username is something completely different and much shorter.  If your system tells you there is no such user, you can do less /etc/passwd to look for your actual account name - it should be towards the end of the file.  Mine looks something like this:\nmyrealusername:x:1000:1000:Jim Salter,,,:/home/myrealusername:/bin/bash\n\nOnce you've successfully changed the password on your account, exit, \"resume normal boot\", and log in as normal, with shiny new (working!) password.\n", "Q: How do I list all the relation variables and debug them interactively? I'm writing a charm that requires a mysql database, I found from looking at other charms that this (below) is how I get the info about the database:\nuser=`relation-get user`\npassword=`relation-get password`\nmysqlhost=`relation-get private-address` \n\nBut I just found that from reading the wordpress charm example, is there a way to show all the relation variables that I can use?\nAlso, while debugging my db-relation-changed script, I wanted to ssh into my host and interactively run those commands, for example relation-get user, but it didn't work. I resorted to having to restart everything and use juju log to print them out.  This wasted a lot of time.  Is there a way to print out these relations, either from my dev box or from the instance running my charm?  (Below is what happens when I tried to interactively run relation-get):\nubuntu@mfisch-local-tracks-0:~$ relation-get user\nusage: relation-get [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-s SOCKET] [--client-id CLIENT_ID]\n                    [--format FORMAT] [--log-file FILE]\n                    [--log-level CRITICAL|DEBUG|INFO|ERROR|WARNING]\n                    [-r RELATION ID]\n                    [settings_name] [unit_name]\nNo JUJU_AGENT_SOCKET/-s option found\n\nI tried juju debug-hooks tracks/0 -e local, that dropped me into a shell and relation-get still failed. \n\nA: A way to interactively debug your charm is to use debug-hooks ( https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/developer-debugging ):\nFor example:\njuju deploy wordpress\n\n( Let's say that the above command deploys wordpress/0 )\njuju debug-hooks wordpress/0\n\nThat will open a tmux session where the hooks can be run manually.  It also sets up the environment so relation-* can be run ( relation-get, relation-list, etc. )\nTry running relation-get ... it should give you all of the available variables for that particular charm/relation.\nNOTE: You actually have to cause a hook to fire once you start the juju debug-hooks. So, add/modify a relationship at this point. (I typically just remove-relationship and then add it right back.) This will create additional hook-specific windows within tmux that DO have JUJU_ setting context and will respond to relation-get relation-set commands.\n\nA: I've run into a variant of this with config-get on the juju unit. I find that if I set\na config value from the deployer machine, then I no longer get the JUJU_AGENT_SOCKET error message:\n    juju bootstrap\n    juju deploy local:wordress # local:$charm\n    juju get wordpress # $charm, gets config.yaml\n    juju set wordpress name=value # set any $charm name\n\n    juju debug-hooks wordpress/0 # $charm/$int\n    $charm-$int: config-get # get config.yaml\n\nWithout doing a 'juju set' on the deployer machine, config-get will return\nthe JUJU_AGENT_SOCKET error. Afterwards, you get all the current values.\nNot an answer, but a workaround. When I know more about relations, maybe a\nvariant works with that too.     \n\nA: Try this:\n\njuju ssh servicename/instance_id sudo apt-get install juju-jitsu\njuju ssh servicename/instance_id\nsudo grep -R JUJU_ENV_UUID /etc\n# take result and export\nubuntu@ip-10-204-237-189:~$ jitsu run-as-hook lamp/0 config-get database-user\njuju-user\n\nalso,\n\n# I attached collectd to this instance\njitsu run-as-hook lamp/0 relation-ids collectd-server\n$ echo $?\n0\n\nIt didn't return anything because I hadn't related it yet,\nnote that it didn't explode either. Hope this helps.\n\nA: When you execute juju debug-hooks service/#, it does a juju ssh into a tmux session. However, that first window of the tmux session (which is like screen) has no JUJU session info. (You can demonstrate this by executing set|grep JUJU and you shouldn't see any settings returned.) There will only be a 0:~ window within TMUX initially.\nOnce a relation is added (from another window/terminal) via something like:\njuju add-relation wordpress mysql\n\nan ADDITIONAL tmux window should be created and become active. The name of the hook being debugged will be embedded in the TMUX title (at the bottom of the screen), something like:\n1: db-relation-changed\n\nYou can now run relation-get or better yet:\nset|grep JUJU\n\nJUJU_AGENT_SOCKET=/var/lib/juju/units/rsetter-1/.juju.hookcli.sock\nJUJU_CLIENT_ID=constant\nJUJU_DEBUG=/tmp/tmp.ZiobnuyhQh\nJUJU_ENV_UUID=b4123455644323333333336d6f8383d\nJUJU_PYTHONPATH=:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/usr/lib/python2.7:/usr/lib/python2.7/plat-linux2:/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk:/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-old:/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7\nJUJU_RELATION=rtest\nJUJU_RELATION_ID=rtest:12\nJUJU_REMOTE_UNIT=rgetter/1\nJUJU_UNIT_NAME=rsetter/1\n_JUJU_CHARM_FORMAT=1\n\n(this for the rsetter charm related to rgetter, not wordpress/mysql)\nYou can then debug (including executing the hooks that would normally be launched as you should be in the parent directory of the charm, so hooks/HOOKNAME)\n", "Q: Library missing for executable file There's an executable I downloaded onto my Ubuntu 10.04 and I can't run because it's missing a library.

Thanks!\n\nA: You have /dev/sda6 labeled as / (root) and /dev/sda7 labeled as /home and /dev/sda5 as swap... so the command you'd use is:\nsudo bash wubi-move.sh /dev/sda6 /dev/sda5 --home=/dev/sda7\n\nNote, it appears that /dev/sda6 and /dev/sda7 aren't completely empty. This is required by the script before it will let you migrate (the script will warn you and exit if this is the case).\nIf you don't want to migrate with a separate /home partition, then the command will be (the first positional parameter is the target partition and the second is the swap partition):\nsudo bash wubi-move.sh /dev/sda6 /dev/sda5\n\nDon't worry too much about it - because the script checks the partitions and won't let you migrate if you get the order wrong. You can also run it with the --check-only argument and it will just perform the checks without making any changes. (Even without that it will prompt you to confirm before making changes.)\nPS. that 691 GiB that's unallocated can't be used unless you first increase the extended partition (/dev/sda4) to include it.

Any ideas on how to get Preferences back?\n\nA: Open a terminal and launch Totem like this:\nUBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 totem\n\nThis will disable the global menu for Totem, so the menu that used to show up on the top Unity panel will show up inside the Totem window, but the GNOME \"Gmenu\" will now show up on the op panel - click it and there you should find the preferences menu along with a few other items.\nScreenshot: \n\nTo always run Totem like this, open its desktop file as root:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/applications/totem.desktop\nAnd change \"Exec=totem %U\" (it should be on line 5) to \"UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 totem %U\", then save the file.\nVia: How To Disable The GNOME Shell AppMenu While Retaining Its Functionality\n\nA: I have a running machine with Unity Desktop and Totem 3.6. (but wiht global menu disable)\nAs you can see the menu bar is in the Totem's window, but also in unity I have a global menu called \"Videos > Preferences\".\n\nOr you can set the focus on the totem's window,then use the \"Hud\" (press the Alt key) and type for \"Preferences\", then hit enter and the preferences windows will be open.\n\n\nTested with \"global menu enable\" the \"Hud\" brings the \"preferences window\"\n\nHope this will helpful.\n\nA: Or, if you really need the menu back, you could downgrade totem and all it's sub-packages and plugins, to version 3.4.3-0ubuntu5 and lock the version from any updates. Launch Synaptic, search for totem and select all *totem* 3.6.* files, go to Force verion, then mark the files as Locked in the Package menu.\n", "Q: 10GB installed but only 7.8 is shown I installed 10GB but my 12.04 LTS 64-bit shows only 10GB.\nBut the swap shows 10GB so I think internally it did find 10GB? I don't remember exactly how Ubunt calculate how much swap needs by default, per memory installed. I would understand if only 9GB is revealed to user, but 7.8?\nIdea?\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          7975        927       7048          0         38        352\n-/+ buffers/cache:        536       7438\nSwap:        10228          0      10228\n\n\nA: OK, 10 GB is an odd number, but now I understand - you've used 5 x 2GB packages because the sixth one was bad.  More than likely you have to fill the slots 2 by 2; the system may not recognise the fifth package because the sixth one is missing.  As Terry Wang said, check how much memory is being recognised in BIOS/Firmware first.\nThere's a good chance it will only be seeing 8Gb because it can't see the sixth package, so it's disabled that pair of slots.  Also check your motherboard manual regarding valid memory configuration.\nMore than likely when you get the sixth memory stick replaced and installed it will be able to see all 12Gb\n", "Q: How to move my downloaded wallpapers to the default wallpaper directory ,I used a Newbie tutorial to download several wallpapers. The tutorial suggested that I create a 'wallpapers' folder on my desktop to store them. That worked fine, but now I want to move those files to the usr/share/backgrounds so they will show up in my default wallpaper list.\nI've tried cp & mv in terminal, but neither works, and I get an error message the \"usr/share/backgrounds\" doesn't exist, though I can access it in Terminal. Could this be a permission problem, or is there an easier way to do this?\n\nA: The theme section you are shown when selecting properties from the desktop also has a drop down menu to select a wallpaper from the /home/$USER/Pictures/ folder.\n\nThis should be the most logical place to store pictures. \nNevertheless the command to store those images in /usr/share/background/ would be \nsudo cp /home/$USER/Desktop/wallpapers/* /usr/share/backgrounds/\n\n\nA: Yes - it's to do with permissions. Just add sudo to your commands and they should work as you intend.\n\nA: It sounds like it may be a permissions issue. Try it with sudo and see if you have any luck.\nIf not, comment on this answer.\n", "Q: Bluetooth mouse not connecting to laptop?

What I mean is that it doesn't have to go through the machine from which the download is issued.\n\nA: if it has ssh, you can always ssh the remote machine, and execute the following command to download a file directly to that machine\nwget <link_of_file_to_download>\n\nfor example, to download a tux picture whose link i know into a server of mine, i would do the following commands\nssh user@myserver\nwget http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Tux.svg/170px-Tux.svg.png\n\n\nA: In order to do what you're asking - download a file in a browser on machine A, but save it to a disk on machine B - you will need a network connection between machines A and B (which means a VPN, if they're not on the same local network) and then you'll need to mount a disk from machine B on machine A.\nThis last bit can be done with nfs, samba, sshfs, or any number of other ways.  We need more info before we can specify something more directly.\n\nA: You could always use secure copy,\nUploading local file to remote server via ssh;\nscp /source/of/file username@remoteserver:/destination/file\n\nDownloading from a remote server to a local directory\nscp username@remoteserver:/destination/file /source/of/file \n\nDownload from a remote server and upload to another remote server\nscp username@remoteserver:/destination/file username2@remoteserver2:/destinatio/file2\n\nRemembering you can also pass options if you would like to recursively upload/download a directory!\nHope this helped.\n", "Q: Cannot connect wireless internet with an Atheros AR9285 802.11b/g/n wi-fi adapter I am new to Ubuntu, Am trying to connect to wireless network but in the network center i cannot even select a local network there are no listings, In windows its straight forward enter in a key, however, I cannot seem to get the wireless to respond. Any ideas?\n\nA: Yes, you are right, the network center does not show awailable wireless networks. To see those you have to click on the wifi-symbol at the right top corner of your display.\n\nThen you are able to choose the network, you want to connect and Ubuntu will ask you for the wifi-key.\n", "Q: Meaning of \"Processing triggers for ureadahead\" I am trying to uninstall Tomcat 7 from Ubuntu 12.04 by issuing the command\nsudo apt-get remove tomcat7\nas a result I am getting the following response\n\nMy Questions\n\n\n*\n\n*Has the package tomcat7 been removed? If yes, why don't the message stating so has not been printed and if no why it has not been removed?\n\n*What is the meaning of \"Processing triggers from ureachahead...\"?\n\nA: Yes it has been removed.  If you issue the removal command again you will see an error stating that Tomcat is not installed.\nureadahead is a mechanism whereby anything that is required to be loaded at boot time is marked as such and the location is noted.   This speeds up boot time because the filesystem doesn't have to go searching for the files before loading them.  As you can imagine, when you install or remove modules some of them may have to be added or removed from ureadahead to keep it up to date.  It's normal mechanism in modern Linux operating systems like Ubuntu.\n\nA: 1) Yes\n2) Packages can subscribe to filesystem events, such as files being added to a certain directory. Packages can also trigger other packages manually. This is done to prevent e.g. update-initramfs to be run many times during a dist-upgrade. Each relevant package now triggers the update-initramfs tool, but it gets run only once, at the end.\n", "Q: Running scripts from another directory Quite often, the script I want to execute is not located in my current working directory and I don't really want to leave it.\nIs it a good practice to run scripts (BASH, Perl etc.) from another directory? Will they usually find all the stuff they need to run properly?\nIf so, what is the best way to run a \"distant\" script? Is it\n. /path/to/script\n\nor\nsh /path/to/script\n\nand how to use sudo in such cases? This, for example, doesn't work:\nsudo . /path/to/script\n\n\nA: You can call your script using only the whole path, without the dot .:\n/path/to/script\n\nsudo also works fine:\nsudo /path/to/script\n\n\nWill they usually find all the stuff they need to run properly?\n\nDo you mean like, \"will my script find the files which are in the same folder?\" That depends of your code. For example, if you have the script /tmp/test.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nls\n\nIf you invoke it from your home folder, it will run ls in your home:\ntest@ubuntu:~:/tmp/test.sh\nDesktop     Dropbox         Imagens  NetBeansProjects     Público     \nDocumentos  Modelos    R          Vídeos\n\nIn this situation, dirname is your ally:\n#!/bin/bash\ncurrent=$(dirname $0)\nls $current\n\nRunning it from your home folder, it gives:\ntest@ubuntu:~:/tmp/test.sh\nacroread_1000_1000     hiRF7yLSOD              pulse-2L9K88eMlGn7   \nunity_support_test.0    clementine-art-jt5332.jpg\n\nwhich is the content of my /tmp/ folder.\n\nA: Common *nix practice for user scripts is to put them in your bin directory.  That way, the script will be searched for by default when you type the name from the command line.\nYour bin (binary) directory should be in your home folder so the full path would be /home/yourusername/bin. (Obviously change yourusername to your login name.)\nThe bin directory should have the following permissions if you run ls -lh from the terminal: drwxr-xr-x\nBy default when you make a directory with the terminal you have the following permissions set: drwxrwxr-x\nThe only thing you need to change is the group permission, but for I will walk you through each step from the terminal (assuming you don't already have a bin):\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal ([Ctrl] + [Alt] + t)\n\n\n*Create the binary directory: mkdir bin\n\n\n*Now either use the GUI or CLI to copy your scripts to /bin.\n\n\n*Now we have to change some permissions so that everything is set up\ncorrectly:\n\n\n*chmod -R 755 bin\n\n\n*This sets the owner (you) to read, write and execute, groups and\nothers to read and execute the scripts. The -R means recursive or set\nthe permissions for all the files in the directory as well.\nFor more help on file permissions see this document.\nNow, you can just type myscript to execute your scripts - you do not have to be in the directory. You don't need the . / or anything!\nFor sudo it's a little different as you will have to define the full path to the script file.\n", "Q: delete /var/cache/* How can I fix it? I accidentally removes all files in /var/cache/ directory with sudo rm -rf command.\nNow I cannot see the files in Trash to bring them back.\nI would like to know how bad is the situation if these files are removed? Is Ubuntu going to work normally and recreate the directories in cache again automatically?\nIf not, which directories do I have to create in /var/cache/ manually to let everything work fine?\nI have already manually made apt and apache2 and debconf in cache directoy but I do not know if I miss more important directory which needed to be created there.\nI hope somebody can guide me to fix this issue.\n\nA: Cache directories fortunately should be expendable. Reinstalling the related packages should bring them back. The problem is /var/cache/apt as you need it for installing.\nSo let's recreate it manually:\nsudo mkdir -p /var/cache/apt/archives\n\nNow you can reinstall packages. On a default installation, these packages own directories in var cache, and this is how you reinstall them:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall cracklib-runtime cups debconf \\\n    dictionaries-common lightdm man-db nscd pm-utils pppconfig \\\n    samba-common software-center\n\nThe only thing I'm not sure about is whether debconf will run without the files in /var/cache/debconf. But try it!\n\nA: rm -rf deletes all files in the given directory immediately without asking and recursively (all sub directories and files). There are not stored in the trash, they are gone.\nIt depends on the installed packages, which folders and files you need in this directory. \nFor example: apache, apt, cups, debconf, flashplugin-installer, git, samba, lightdm, pm-utls, man, software-center ...\nMaybe you can take a look on the Ubuntu live cd, which files and folders are the standard files in this directory.\nEDIT:\nMaybe you can try these tools (on your own risk):\nextundelete\ntestdisk\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 nvidia breaks resolution i am running ubuntu 12.04 64-bit and i have a nvidia Geforce GT 650m, it was running fine with 1920 x 1024, except a lot of tearing everytime i ran videos.

All mobile versions for the Ivy Bridge feature the Intel HD 4000 graphics as integrated graphics processor (IGP).\nSummary\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete /etc/X11/xorg.conf (don't forget to make a backup)\n\n*Manually switch between IGP and dedicated GPU using either Bumblebee or PRIME.\n\n\nBackground\nThis configuration has the advantage, that for less graphic intensive applications the IGU can be used which has a lower energy-consumption. However, in my case it meant, that Ubuntu always used the IGU independent of whether I had installed the Nvidia drivers or not. That's why your configuration says This driver is activated but not currently in use.\nLow Resolution Problem\nYou probably have never used your Nvidia card until you asked the question. The xorg.conf generated by nvidia-xconfig expects a Nvidia card to be used, that is not the case, so I guess the X-server uses some failsafe output mode. That Problem can easily be solved  by deleting xorg.conf file. \nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nThan restart your Window Manager (or reboot), e.g.\nsudo restart lightdm\n\nYou should have your resolution back now.\nSwitching between IGU and dedicated GPU\nThere are multiple ways how to approach enabling support for hybrid graphics. The Hybrid Graphics Linux Team (new user max 2 links, google for launchpad+hybrid-graphics-linux) gives a comprehensive overview. From what I've seen the easiest to use and most advanced technologies are Bumblebee and PRIME. In both cases you start the applications that should use the dedicated GPU with a specific prefix.\nBumblebee\nBumblebee either uses the free noveau or the proprietary Nvidia driver. So far I only tried Bumblebee, which seems to be the better working solution for the Intel and Nvidia combination.\nThere is an Ubuntu wiki page (google wiki+ubuntu+Bumblebee), that describes the steps on how to install it. After the installation you can run applications using the dedicated GPU by prefixing them with optirun. E.g.:\noptirun glxgears\n\nThe Nvidia settings will only work if the card is active so you have to run\noptirun nvidia-settings -c :8\n\nto get to the settings. The monitor configuration works via the default tool.\nAddendum\nPRIME seems to be working good in the combination AMD-IGU with Nvidia GPU. But There does not seem to be much comprehensive reading about it.\nThe hybrid support is still somewhat early and depending on your specific configuration either PRIME or Bumblebee may be the better solution for you.\n\nA: have you tried gksu nvidia-settings,if so i would try and install latest experimental drivers (310) and watch to see if it actually downloads the new drivers,i had to do this a couple of times to make mine work in 12.10 \n", "Q: ssh always prompts for key password I'm using 12.10 with gnome-shell 3.6.\nI have multiple ssh keypairs (created with ssh-keygen). They're stored in ~/.ssh/ids/hostname/id_rsa and id_rsa.pub. I have a file ~/.ssh/config which says which key to use with which host.\nWhenever I connect to one of the hosts, it always prompts me for the id_rsa password. I want the keys to be unlocked whenever I'm logged in.\nI tried to import the keys into seahorse (aka Passwords and Keys), but I ran against this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/seahorse/+bug/1017210\nI then tried to use ssh-add. This gave me the proper behavior, but it didn't persist across sessions/reboots.\nBefore I created different keys for different hosts, gnome-shell would give me a popup asking for my login password, and after I entered it, the keys would be unlocked for the rest of the session. How can I get this to work again?\n\nA: Seahorse will automatically detect the ssh keyfiles if they're in the top-level ~/.ssh directory. My work-around solution was to change how I organized my keyfiles. As such, seahorse detects them, and gnome-shell detects them only asks for my login password once per keyfile. \n", "Q: I got troubles installing xubuntu in my netbook dell I have troubles installing the xubuntu 12.10 version.

Thanks in advance...\n\nA: I had the same problem. \nIt was solved by changing to a server which uses https protocol.\nGot a hint from this answer.\nThe author provides a list of servers that use https\nNote: I had to perform a \"search and replace\" on my sources.list as I could not find https mirrors via the GUI.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 and VMware Workstation 9: RAM caching causes severe performance drops I have read plenty of threads on memory caching and the standard response of \"large cache is good, it shouldn't effect performance\", \"the kernel knows best\".\nI have recently upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10 and changed from VirtualBox to VMware Workstation and the performance differences are severe (I suspect it is because of the latter).\nWhen I am running my virtual machine the system load monitor graph shows less than 50% memory usage generally.\n\nSystem load indicator is showing me that the rest of my RAM is used in the cache all the time.\nPlain and simple this is the comparison:\nBEFORE\n\n\n*\n\n*Cache was very sparingly used, pretty much none of my memory usage was the cache\n\n*Swappiness was 0 (caused my memory to be used first, then swap only if needed)\n\n*Performance was quite good and logical\n\n\n*\n\n*RAM was used fully first, caching was minimal. I could run enough software to utilize my full 4GB of RAM without any performance degradation whatsoever\n\n*Swap space was then used as needed which was obviously slower (I am on a HDD) but was still usable when the current program was loaded into memory\n\n\n\nAFTER\n\n\n*\n\n*Cache is used to fill the full 4GB as soon as my virtual machine is run\n\n*Swappiness is 0 (same behaviour as before but cache uses full memory straight away)\n\n*Performance is terrible and unusable while running Ubuntu software\n\n\n*\n\n*Basic things like changing windows takes 2 minutes +\n\n*Changing screens happens frame by frame over sometimes up to 5 minutes\n\n*Cannot run an IDE and VM like I could with ease before\n\n\n\nSo basically, any suggestions on how to take my performance back to how it was before while keeping my current setup?\nMy suspicion is VMWare is the problem, but how do I see what is tied to the use of the cache? Surely there is a way to control this behaviour in software as polished as VMware?\nThanks\nEDIT:\nCould also be important to note that the behaviour differs depending on whether VMware is open or closed. If VMware is open, then the ram will lock at like 50% and 50% cache and go into the complete lock up mentioned above. Contrastingly, if VMware is closed (after being open), then the RAM will continue to rise as it needs / cache will stay as the complete remaining memory and there is no noticeable performance degradation.\nEDIT2:\nI have swapped my swappiness to 5 as suggested, no change whatsoever (also had the same problems with swappiness of 10 and 60 prior to posting this question). On closer examination, there is something really messed up. System monitor (and confirmed with the terminal commands suggested - free -m namely) are showing the following:\nben@ben-HPdv6:~$ free -m\n         total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          3945       3827        117          0         42       2770\n-/+ buffers/cache:       1014       2931\nSwap:         1905          0       1905\n\nWhich says that only ~ 1GB of my RAM is being used and ~3GB is in disk cache BUT my VM IS running and IS allocated 1.5GB of RAM. There was NO increase in my used RAM when I loaded the VM, but the cache jumped. System monitor (was confirmed with ps -aux) does show that vmware has a correct sounding 1.8GB of RAM but obviously free -m is showing otherwise. The results also suggest otherwise as my system struggled to even open this chrome page to post the reply (I only have vmware workstation and terminal open). Its like the memory isn't being declared correctly as RAM memory usage (as opposed to cache) and then the kernel obviously isn't responding properly based on that? Like its trying to release the cache memory as required like its supposed to but it can't because its in fact used memory / not cache.\nI am just spitballing here now, really looking for some help about how to get to the bottom of this.  Any idea whatsoever on finding out what is going on? Is there a way to confirm this is a VMware problem and not a Ubuntu one?\n\nA: Set swappiness to 0 is NOT recommended in Production environment, especially for a host that runs multiple virtual machines. I've seen weird issues on servers and my own workstations, with swappiness set to 0, changing it to 5 or higher value makes it normal again, just don't set it to zero, unless you are 100% sure what you are doing and the consequence, workaround.\nI don't trust the GNOME System Monitor. Normally use free, vmstat or dstat.\n\n\n*\n\n*free Available system memory = free + buffers + cached, or + buffers/cache in free output. \n\n*vmstat is mainly used to monitor page (swap) out/in. You need to troubleshoot if lots of page out/in happen.\n\n*dstat is more advanced than vmstat\n\n\nHave you tried to check VMware Workstation known issues? Make sure you run the latest version: 9.0.1?\nLinux memory management:\nhttp://www.linuxatemyram.com/\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/449296/why-is-linux-reporting-free-memory-strangely\n\nA: The solution ended up being resolved with future kernel updates. For the record, the offending kernel which caused this problem was 3.5.0-17-generic\n", "Q: Creating folder in new HDD I just bought a brand new 2TB harddrive mainly for storage.  I formatted it as ext2.\nHowever, I cannot create a folder inside the harddrive, nor can I move files to the harddrive\n\nA: First - formatting a large drive with ext2 was a very definite mistake.  So let's fix that.\nOpen Disk Utility from the Dash.  You will see a list of all your Storage Devices on the left.  Select the new hard drive, and click Format Drive.  Select the Scheme GUID Partition Table, and click Format.\n\nNow, click Create Partition under Volumes.  Make sure the Type is set to Ext4, and give it a better name than New Volume.  Make sure Take ownership of filesystem is checked, and finally click Create.\n\nNow, click Mount Volume - you'll see a Mount Point of /media/nameyoupicked, and in the File Manager, it will show up as a mounted Device.\n\nThe new device won't automatically be mounted when you reboot, but it will still show up in File Manager and will mount automatically if you click it.\n\nIf that's not sufficient for you - if you need the disk to automatically be mounted at each boot, before you even log in - that can be done as well, but please ask it as a separate question. :)  Hope this helped!\n", "Q: How to change driver to nvidia-current? Alright, I've already installed the nvidia drivers a while ago and had to deactivate them again because I couldn't change the resolution.\nNow I would like to activate them again for HDMI support. The additional drivers window says that the driver nvidia-current is activated, but not in use. What is needed to use it as the primary driver again? I've already checked the Internet, but couldn't find any help.\nEdit: If I run nvidia-xconfig and relog, my resolution freezes at 640x480 and I can't change it anywhere.

As I use it, the screen will randomly turn grey and become unresponsive. I can then only wait, until perhaps 10-60 secs. later, when I can interact again. Only the bar at the top of my screen retains its colour throughout.\nI thought it might be Firefox, as I have a lot of tabs open. I installed Chromium, used it instead, and the problem remained.\nA while back I upgraded from 1 to 2 Gb RAM. So, I thought recently, maybe I should increase the swap-space. I have 738Mb of 7.2Gb free on root; and 2Gb of 28Gb free on my home drive. I bought a 32 Gb SD Card and assigned 4Gb to swap space. cat /proc/swaps reports that the partition is being used. Alas the problem remains. Does anyone know what's wrong with my machine?\n\nThe SD Card has changed my machine somewhat, but the greying still happens. I ran free -m shortly after another episode, and received:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          2004       1731        272          0        370        769\n-/+ buffers/cache:        591       1412\nSwap:         4073          0       4073\n\n\nUpdate: Using 'top', I can see that compiz uses about 43% of the CPU (#1 position) when the greying occurs. After the greying, compiz drops back down to its usual 8% of CPU.   \n\nUpdate: If I log in to Ubuntu using the Unity2d option (the option pops up when you press the Ubuntu logo on the login screen) instead of Unity, compiz is not loaded, and the problem disappears. Now Firefox's plugin-container is annoying me. I used about:config and changed dom.ipc.plugins.enabled to false. Now Firefox crashes often. Could it finally be time for Chromium? Alas I love Firefox's RSS support. \n\nA: You can check memory and swap space usage with \nfree -m\n\nIf in doubt post it into your question and we'll have a look.  It does sound like the application is busy and going non-responsive.  It helps to have a look at CPU usage when this happens and see exactly what is going on.  I run Gkrellm all the time on my systems, and use the terminal command 'top' to look at processes that are using the highest cpu.  There may be another process that is using a lot of cpu occasionally, resulting in the problem with the browsers.  Once you know what is causing the problem the suggestion usually suggests itself.\n", "Q: Create .desktop file as shorcut to a folder in Lubuntu LXDE What is the \"Exec=\" part of a desktop configuration file for this? I guess I should mention file manager but how exactly?\n\nA: Simple: \nExec=filemanager /path/to/folder\nOn the desktop (that is: in pcmanfm) right click\n\n\n\nA: The option to create a shortcut does not appear for me in Lubuntu 15.10 so I used the following command line:\n\nln -s /path/to/folder ~/Desktop\n\n\nA: I had a same problem!\nThe solution for me was to create a new file on desktop, open it with leafpad and write the following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Myname\nExec=pcmanfm /home/myfolder\nIcon=/home/iconpath\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\n\nSave it and you will have a shortcut to /home/myfolder\n", "Q: How can I do a cdromupgrade if 12.10 does not have an alternate iso? Canonical dropped support to the alternate ISO's and they are not listed in the downloads page, how can I do a CD ROM upgrade now ?\n\nA: Correction:\nApparently you can't.  I've just burned a 12.10 DVD and booted off it to have a look, but it is not offering and upgrade option, only 'use all of the disk' 'install alongside' and 'something else'.  It seems they have indeed removed the CD upgrade option.\nEven holding down Space to get to the utility menu does not yield an upgrade.\nI think there were some problems with the CD upgrade in past versions but I thought it was one of the better ideas I've seen regarding upgrades.  Let's hope it comes back in future releases.\n", "Q: Why is Gnome-Shell thinking my \"d\" key minimizes all windows? I am on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (in gnome-shell) and I am unable to use my \"d\" key.

I'm a bit long-winded so see bottom for quick version and specs.\nFriendly Hello:\nHello all on these askUbuntu pages, I just recently built my own computer and decided to switch to Ubuntu for the extra coolness. I've been learning a lot through all this, and mostly been trying to figure out issues on my own (read: Google searches). However, I couldn't seem to find others with this problem so I've come here for help.\nDetailed Recount:\nSo I just used WINE and WINETRICKS to install Steam. All went well and it worked. Then I went to trying a game out. I remembered that Orcs Must Die! worked from http://www.steamgamesonlinux.com/ so I tried that out. After selecting to download it, that's when the problem occurred. The screen suddenly zoomed in!!! I think it's the resolution right? Half the screen is cut off and I can't see parts of the right side of windows. My theory is that this is due to Direct X being installed through Steam, as Steam automatically installed it as I chose to download the game. It didn't even ask me to install Direct X or not ): It all happened so fast. This all being said, the game works fine! It looks a little strange, as if the resolution was off, but it plays just fine.\nWhat I did so far:\nRestarted my computer. Didn't work -_- Researched Steam installing DirectX on Ubuntu then messing up resolution and couldn't really find anything. Researched uninstalling DirectX from Ubuntu but only found uninstalling DirectX after having been installed with Wine, not through Steam. Got mad and ate my feelings.\nTried \"xrandr -s 0\" but it didn't do anything.\nRan xrandr alone and terminal showed this:\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 640 x 480, maximum 16384 x 16384\nDVI-I-0 connected 640x480+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm\n640x480 59.9*+\n320x240 120.1\nDVI-I-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDVI-D-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nAbout now I was mad so I played Odin's Sphere then took a nap.\nBack to it! I entered the following:\nxrandr --output DVI-I-0 --mode 1024x768\nBut I was met with this message:\nxrandr: cannot find mode 1024x768\nI get the same messages for 800x600, 1400x1050, and seemingly any other combination of numbers.\nI then tried Going into System Settings then Displays, then playing around in there. My Resolution is set to 640x480 and there are no other options for me to choose from. Rotation has Normal, Clockwise, Counter Clockwise, and 180 Degrees. It's set to Normal and I haven't messed with that. Launcher Placement has Unknown and All Displays as its two options. It's set to Unknown, but moving it to All Displays doesn't seem to do anything. Finally, when I click Detect Displays, nothing seems to happen.\nQuick Version:\nLinux noob. Steam installed with Wine and Winetricks. Steam downloaded and installed game + DirectX.

I have had some games mess the primary screen up and wasnt able to get in to the video mode app to restore it. xorg.conf was the only way to resolve that.\nIf its the game its self I have seen that to.  you may need to kill some .conf or ini files in the game.  some times I have had to edit them and forcefully change it to the resolution that works best for me.  other games dont have a conf and you either get lucky or not. startopia was like that. I always try an make a backup of the initial good ini files from install and or first run where every thing works right. its not unusual to have to restore settings for some of the pickier programs. \n", "Q: How to get NBA 2K13 working I am confused about how certain games can or can not be played on Ubuntu. Every sort of \"Big Market\" game available is not supported on Linux. However, when looking on Amazon, I stumbled across NBA 2K13 in the Linux Games section. Here is the link: http://www.amazon.com/NBA-2K13-windows-linux-PCLinux-Unix/dp/B007MMINWQ\nMy question is, if I buy this game, can I just pop it in and it will give me installation instructions and then I can play, just like on Windows 7? Or will I have to do it some other way? \n\nA: I am not entirely sure I believe that game is really supported directly under Linux at all.  Short of seeing something on the actual BOX ITSELF saying so, I would tend to assume this is probably miscategorized on Amazon.\nI did some searching and was unable to find any website talking about a native Linux port of the game, only people talking about (successfully) getting it running under Wine.  So, probably a miscategorization.  You could ask Amazon support about this if you're really feeling hopeful, and maybe see if you could get somebody there to either actually read the box or guarantee a refund should you get it and find out that it's simply been miscategorized.  That's the best advice I've got for you.\nBtw: check out http://humblebundle.com/ for a fair number of pretty cool indie games that are directly supported on Linux and easy to install - most of them can even install directly from the Software Center, once you've purchased your Bundle!\n", "Q: How to create apache Alias ubuntu 12.10 I have installed the LAMP on my Ubuntu 12.10.

Please help..\n\nA: Indeed you have many solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy all .deb files from /var/cache/apt/archives to the new  pc to  the directory /var/cache/apt/archives, or just copy the .deb of vlc dependencies only instead of copying all those debs. you can know the dependencies of vlc by command apt-cache rdepends vlc.\nNow once you have those debs in the /var/cache/apt/archives of the second system then you can run sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get install vlc.\n\n\nBUT this only works if the two systems have same  OS version and same package  version with same updates.more info\n\n\n*\n\n*Another solution which is better is to make your own repository so you can install any application you want without fearing of dependencies hell when offline installation. take a look: https://askubuntu.com/a/648969/150504\n\nA: Answering your question:\ncopy ALL of the debs from /var/cache/apt/archives to the new machine's /var/cache/apt/archives, then simply sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install vlc as normal - it will pick up the .debs in the archive and install without downloading.\nGoing a step further: install apt-cacher-ng instead\nOn the first machine, do sudo apt-get install apt-cacher-ng.  Then do sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf and insert the string Acquire::http::Proxy \"http://127.0.0.1:3142/\"; - this tells the machine to use the apt-cacher-ng instance on itself when it updates.  Now, import your existing cached debs - sudo cp -a /var/cache/apt/archives/* /var/cache/apt-cacher-ng/_import/, then open your browser to http://localhost:3142/acng-report.html, scroll down, and click Start Import.  Once that's done, do a quick sudo apt-get update - and, whew!  You've now got apt-cacher-ng running on your host machine, and every time your host machine downloads updates, it will cache them for both itself and any other machine on your network.\nFinally, on your second machine, sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf and insert the string Acquire::http::Proxy \"http://first.machine.ip.address:3142/\"; where first.machine.ip.address is the IP address of the machine you installed apt-cacher-ng on in the paragraph above - now, when you download updates on either machine, it will update the apt-cacher-ng on the first machine, and you won't have to download them again.

There are a number of ways to fix this. One is to create your own custom Windows boot entry for GRUB in /etc/grub.d/40_custom. Something like this might work:\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt7)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nAfter creating that entry, type sudo update-grub to transfer it to the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file. I can't guarantee that this will work, though; what works for one installation doesn't always work for another.\nAnother approach is to install another boot manager, such as rEFInd or gummiboot. When installed as a primary boot manager, these tools will enable you to select Windows vs. GRUB, and you'll then use GRUB to select your kernel. Alternatively, either can boot a Linux kernel (version 3.3.0 or later) directly, bypassing GRUB entirely. Doing this optimally requires some reconfiguration, though; see this page on the rEFInd documentation for details.\n\nA: http://www.intowindows.com/dual-boot-windows-8-and-ubuntu/ i find a link . and it is very good\nNOTE : if answer is true ; please confirm answer\n", "Q: Quicker alternative to gnome-screenshot? (no animation!, quick!, no frills) I want to take screenshots in Ubuntu.\nThis is normally no big problem with the standard gnome-screenshot program is working good. \nBut just now I ran into trouble because I need to take a screenshot of some window which appears only for about 0.5 seconds. \nThe Problem is that the gnome-screenshot is using a (from me at least disappreciated animation when used... this fancy thing kind of delays all and I really cannot manage to take the picture..) \nSo what I need is a \"no frills\" \"down to the ground\" alternative to the gnome-screenshot. I really disklike the animation - now because it makes me so much trouble. I also hate it that there appears to be no way to disable it after all. Everybody is forced to accept this animation that looks like \"a flash light is going on\".\nI am not against being fancy... but this animation in gnome-screenshot is impacting/reducing its functionality. Indeed in my case the shortly appearing window hides when loosing focus. The animaiton -as I assume- triggers the \"loosing of focus\". So because of the animation I cannot take the screenshot.\nAnyhow I have looked for \"less frills\" alternatives and I have found that shutter is a programme that commes with quite some baggage.. \nBut maybe somebody knows a very light-weight programm that serves the very sinple (do nothing else) purpose of just taking a screenshot...\n\nA: I used a program named scrot which is really lightweight.\nI set up this in the Terminal\ncd /tmp/\nwhile true; do sleep 0.1s ; scrot; done\n\nwhich will cause that (assuming performance allows) there is about 1 screenshot taken each .1s. (Almost like recording a movie :) ). \nscrot saves the files (named with a timestamp) in the current directory. That is why cd /tmp is a good first step.\nAnyhow there is no baggage, no animation... simply screenshot. I kind of like scrot.\n\nA: You can use import from the ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick packages:\nimport -window root screenshot.png\n\n\nA: I'm surprised to hear you're having trouble with gnome-screenshot.  In my experience it takes the image first, then does it's silly animation thing.  I never actually found it annoying before, but now I do, thanks very much. ;-)\nI did some tests with top set to refresh every 0.1 second and found that gnome-screenshop always managed to record the screen shot before top registered that gnome-screenshot was using cpu cycles.\nIn any case, there's a few more features you could try with screenshot that might do the trick for you, mainly run it in interactive mode and see if that improves the response, or used the timed screenshot features it has.  To start the interactive mode:\ngnome-screenshot --interactive\n\nTo see some of the other hidden features have a look at the man page for gnome-screenshot.  BTW shutter is great, but now that I've found the interactive mode of gnome-screenshot I really don't think I need it.\n\nA: Shutter (http://shutter-project.org/) might do the trick. I don't know if it is fast enough but theoretically you can click on the window you want a screenshot of. As you mentioned it does come with baggage, but I think it's the best.\n\nA: I'm loving scrot! Sharing how I locked it to the PrintScreen keyboard key on my Linux Mint 19 xfce system, and customized the folder where it's saved:\n\n\n*\n\n*install scrot: sudo apt install scrot\n\n*Start menu -> start typing Keyb.. and open Keyboard settings\n\n*Go to Application Shortcuts tab\n\n*There is a pre-existing screenshot application of Mint tied to 'Print' shortcut, which opens the interactive window. Still useful for some cases, but let's change the shortcut key for it:\n\n*\n*\n\n*Select it, press Edit. Press Ok for the command, then next window asks you to enter the shortcut keystroke(s). I set it to Ctrl+PrintScreen .\n\n\n*Now the PrintScreen key is free for scrot.\n\n*Click Add button\n\n*Enter this command: scrot '%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S.png' -e 'mv $f /path/to/screenshots/'\n\n*Change your path as per need; and if you're ok with the screenshots collecting in your Home folder then just enter this command: scrot '%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S.png'\n\n*Press Ok, and then it asks you to enter the shortcut keystroke. Press just the PrntScrn key on your keyboard or whatever key/combo you want to use as shortcut\n\n\n\nThat's it! We're set. Now test it - press that button, and check your folder for a new screenshot png saved there.\nWith this I have the best of both worlds : I can quickly hit PrntScrn key to auto-save a full-screen screenshot, or I can press Ctrl+PrntScrn to specialize.\nCheck out the scrot manpage : man scrot to see more options.\n", "Q: Is my swap encrypted or not?

Tried to install Ubuntu 12.04 from USB-stick alongside the existing Win7 OS 64bit, and now I'm not sure if install was completely successful: Disk Utility tool claims that the Extended partition (which contains Ubuntu partition and Swap) is \"misaligned\" and recommends repartition. What should I do, and if should I do this repartition, how to do it (especially if I would like not to lose the data on Win7 partition)?\nBackground info: A considerably new Thinkpad laptop (UEFI BIOS, if that matters). Before install there were already a \"SYSTEM_DRV\" partition, the main Windows partition and a Lenovo recovery partition (all NTFS). Now the table looks like this: SYSTEM_DRV (sda1), Windows (sda2), Extended (sda4) (which contains Linux (sda5; ext4) and Swap (sda6)) and Recovery (sda3). Disk Utility Tool gives a message as follows when I select Ext: \"The partition is misaligned by 1024 bytes. This may result in very poor performance. Repartitioning is suggested.\"\nThere were couple of problems during the install, which I describe below, in the case they happen to be relevant.\nInstaller claimed that it recognized existing OS'es fine, so I checked the corresponding option during the install. Next, when it asked me how to allocate the disk space, the first weird thing happened: the installer give me a graphical \"slide\" allocate disk space for pre-existing Win7 OS and new Ubuntu... but it did not inform me which partition would be for Ubuntu and which for Windows. ..well, I decided to go with the setting installer proposed. (not sure if this is relevant, but I guess I'd better mention it anyway - the previous partition tools have been more self-explanatory...)\nAfter the install (which reported no errors), GRUB/Ubuntu refused to boot. Luckily this problem was quite straightforwardly resolved with live-Ubuntu-USB and Boot-Repair (\"Recommended repair\" worked just fine). After all this hassle I decided to check the partition table \"just to be sure\"- and the disk utility gives the warning message I described.\nI checked my disk specs on Hitachi/HGST website, and yes, it's Advanced Format (\"Advanced Format, 512-byte emulation\").\nAlso, fdisk gives me the following:\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n\n/dev/sda1   *        2048     3074047     1536000    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2         3074048   523241959   260083956    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3       939907072   976771071    18432000    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda4       523243518   939907071   208331777    5  Extended\nPartition 4 does not start on physical sector boundary.\n/dev/sda5       523243520   932153343   204454912   83  Linux\n/dev/sda6       932155392   939907071     3875840   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nApparently sda4 (extended) partition is off by 2 bytes (sda4 starts on 523243518, sda5 523243520), but if I understood correctly, this should not be a problem, as the logical partition sda5 seems to be OK(?). In other words, there should be no need for repartitioning?\n\nA: There's two issues usually involved here.  I think the main problem is that the physical sector size on the disk might be (say for example) 4096 bytes whereas the logical sector size is usually 512 bytes.  Where the start of the partition is not at the beginning  of the physical sector a discrepancy occurs with how the disk is read.  This can mainly cause a performance problem on some machines with some drives.  I don't believe it will actually cause any loss of data or similar problems, however I'm not a disk drive engineer. \nThe second issue is that Linux disk utilities and the ext file system in general seem to assume that partitions should line up with the cylinders on the hard drive.  I've seen it written that if a cylinder extends past a cylinder boundary and the next partition starts in the same cylinder, data corruption could result.  Sorry I've got no firm reference on this and google seems to be finding anything but information on cylinder alignment, but it had something to do with ext2/3/4 assuming that it could write to the end of a cylinder under certain circumstance.\nUsually, I set up partitions with Gparted before I start the installation (gparted is on the LiveDVD) and then select how I want to use the partitions manually by selecting \"do something else\" when I get to that part of the installation.  It's usually later that I realise that Gparted has left a few MB of unused space either at the end of the drive, or if I've set up the whole drive with Gparted, right at the end.  Here's the exact example of the drive that I'm on at the moment.  Note that I have two boot partitions of about 20Gb, with a the rest of the drive being an extended partition containing the swap partition and /home.  Note the 2Mb of unallocated space right at the end of the extended partition.  This was Gparted's doing, not mine.  I've seen other disks that (for example) might have some unallocated space beteen the primary partitions or before the extended partition because the partitions were created at different times and with different programs.\n\nSince it is only a few MB, and after reading the information about the potential problems, I usually let it be.  If Gparted wants to take a belt and suspenders approach I'm quite happy to let it do so.\nI suggest you boot off the LiveDVD/USB again and just resize the ext4 partition Ubuntu is on with Gparted.  I think you'll find that Gparted will try to align the partition with the cylinders, and this should solve the problems for you.  Don't bother re-installing unless the resize breaks the Linux boot in some way.\nDuring my google searches I did find information about Gparted aligning to full MB figures, but this is not my experience.  The amount of space left is more like a cylinder's worth, rather that something that denotes MB boundaries.\n\nA: Fabricator4 is correct about the physical sectors of most modern disks being 4096 bytes in size, whereas logical sectors are 512 bytes in size. This can cause severe performance problems (but not data loss); see this article I wrote on the topic some time ago for details.\nOld utilities aligned partitions on \"cylinders\" for reasons that were valid in the 1980s but that have no bearing today. Nonetheless, the practice continued in most Linux partitioning tools until a year or two ago. No filesystem should write outside the bounds of its containing partition, though, and AFAIK ext2/3/4 never had any sort of cylinder-alignment assumptions.\nToday, some disk utilities produce false alarms about alignment problems under some circumstances, and I suspect that's what you're seeing. In particular, alignment of extended partitions is irrelevant. You need only be concerned about alignment of primary and logical partitions. To be 100% sure of what you've got, view your partition table with fdisk (or parted with sector-precise data, or gdisk for GPT disks, which yours isn't). Check that all the primary and logical partitions begin on sector values that are multiples of 8. (The partition end values are irrelevant, as are the start values for extended partitions.) For instance:\n$ sudo fdisk -lu /dev/sda\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 160.0 GB, 160041885696 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 19457 cylinders, total 312581808 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x8e0cb6b5\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1              63    20033054    10016496   27  Unknown\n/dev/sda2        20033055   103699574    41833260   17  Hidden HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda3   *   103699575   249907139    73103782+   5  Extended\n/dev/sda5       103699638   131781194    14040778+  17  Hidden HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda6       131781258   183992444    26105593+   b  W95 FAT32\n/dev/sda7       183992508   187076924     1542208+  82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda8   *   187076988   187398224      160618+  83  Linux\n/dev/sda9       187398288   249907139    31254426   8e  Linux LVM\n\nThis is an older disk that was partitioned with cylinder alignment, so you can see that a number of partitions do not begin on 8-sector multiples. This isn't a problem because it's an old disk that uses 512-byte physical sectors. If you see such a result, you should check with your disk's manufacturer to determine its status. Look for mention of Advanced Format, which is the marketing name for disks with 4096-byte physical sectors.\nIf you don't have an Advanced Format disk or if all your primary and logical partitions are properly aligned, you shouldn't worry about any complaints from Disk Utility.\n\nA: This is might be due to advanced formatting, which means that the physical sectors on the disc are larger than the traditional 512 bytes, its 4 KB, which is 8 times larger. If the disc was formatted with an old formatting tools that uses 512 B sectors, which can cause the partition not to be properly aligned, and it could cause the message to show up. \nProperly aligned partitions will be very slightly more optimal, and random write performance will be slower on the non-aligned partitions. But it will work.\nIf the system works well, you don't need to worry about it.  But if you want to have it fixed, then I would suggest that yo\nu have a backup of your system, just in case.  I would recommend the you can  have that fixed, the next time you have a good excuse for reinstalling, and repartitioning the drive.\n", "Q: Recently upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10 and now sceen keeps flikering on and off I recently installed 12.04 on my desktop and upgraded to 12.10.\nSince then the screen constantly goes blank every 5-8 seconds.

I just purchased the Asus Zenbook UX31A and I require some advice regarding tuning the touchpad.\nBasically my problem is that the mouse buttons are withing the touch area and I would like it to be disabled. Such that only part of the touch area is recognized. I have attached an image to clarify the idea. Basically only the red area in the image should be recognized.\n\nI have two reasons for this request: Firstly, I like to hold my thumb on the mouse button instead of holding it in the air. This is problematic, because touchpad thinks that I'm trying some kind of two finger gesture all the time and cursor stops moving.\nClicking is also problematic since every finger movement -- regardless of how insignificant it might be -- on the \"button\" will move the cursor.\nI have been playing with some synclient settings like AreaBottomEdge etc. They have some effect but then I cannot highlight text or right button stops working.\nHow could I solve this?\n\nA: For me, doing this was not enough. I needed to let my thumb at the bottom of the touchpad (ready to click). Actually, the AreaBottomEdge don't disable the \"finger counting\" on the dead zone and resting your thumb enable the scroll. Quite annoying. \nTo fix that, I used this patch : \nhttp://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=4v9JP2pe\nDon't forget to change to the AreaBottomEdge value in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.conf\nSource : #24\nEdit: by the way, the bug is referenced here : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-input-synaptics/+bug/1026046\n\nA: It is very simple to accomplish this:\nFirst discover the width and height of your touchpad typing in the terminal:\nless /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep -i range\n\nIn my case the output was this:\n[    24.188] (--) synaptics: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: x-axis range 1472 - 5772\n[    24.188] (--) synaptics: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: y-axis range 1408 - 5086\n\nSo the width is 5772 and the height is 5086.

It created a tar called fs.tar.gz. \nThis fs.tar.gz has the size of 98MB.\nHow can this be possible?\nI did read somewhere that symlinks or something similar can cause this - I do have symlinks in my folder.\n\nA: A tar file has overhead because it also includes information on how to recreate the files. If the content you added to the tar file itself is already compressed you can end up with a bigger file than all the Mibs of all the files together. But... we are talking about small amounts of overhead. Not like 2 times the size of all the files. This indeed smells like symlinks.\nYou can use tar -tvf fs.tar.gz | more to have a look for files that got included but where not 'suppose' to be there. If both symlink and file are in the directories you use to create the tar file you will end up with both files included. \n\n\n*\n\n*Tar has an option for not archiving symlinks; from the man page:\n-h, --dereference\ndon't archive symlinks; archive the files they point to\n\nDo be careful when messing with symlinks: you might up ending with broken ones that you need to fix yourself. \n\n*Tar allows for excluding files either with the `--exclude {PATTERN} or --exclude_from {FILE}. This lets you include the symlink and from that the file and skip the file itself.\n\n*To only include files and not the symlink you can use find /dir1 -type f |tar {etc} \n\nA: I think under certain conditions tarring can create MUCH larger outputs. I'm having same issue as OP, on a higher order of magnitude. The folder I'm tarring is 3.2K and the output tar file is 4MB - over 1000 times the size of the original.\nReproduce it yourself - I'm creating a hundred directories inside a folder named playground, and then 26 empty files in each of those directories:\n$ mkdir -p playground/dir-{00{0..9},0{10..99},100}\n$ touch playground/dir-{00{0..9},0{10..99},100}/file{A..Z}\n$ tar cf playground.tar playground\n\n", "Q: How to select camera in Camorama?

Used it for a bit, then logged out and logged in. Now the taskbar isn't there, and there's a solid gray bar at the top of the screen (width roughly the same as that of the taskbar). What should I do?\n\nA: The solid gray bar is your task bar.

Have you checked in the /usr/share/themes/ to verify that they're actually missing, and it's not some other problem?\nAlso, you should file a bug report about this, as it should not happen.\n", "Q: How to recover files after changing partition filesystem? I tried to install Ubuntu 12.10 but for some reason the process stopped half-way and wouldn't progress, after some time waiting I decided to reboot and to my surprise my D: partition, where I have some files stored, was entirely occupied by Ubuntu.\nI assume that the filesystem of the partition was changed from NFTS to ext4, so I lost access to the files on Windows. Later I recreated the D: partition again as NFTS, with its original size, and didn't do anything else with it, hoping that none of the files would be overwritten, but the partition was empty. I expected that, as I assume during the Ubuntu installation, the partition is formatted.\nHowever I was hoping it would be possible to recover them. I already used PhotoRec tool to try the recovery of such files but all I am retrieving is thousands of text files, apart from a few intact files randomly named.\nIs there any possibility to recover those files, given the circumstances described above?\n\nA: If indeed the filesystem was damaged or destroyed you do not hold the best cards, since the filesystem is as you surely know the link to the files in the partitions. \nStill of course there might be some change to recover the files by using tools which work upon the concept that most files are recocnized by the sequence of their very first bytes. This means that even when the filesystems is missing some files can be found by searching the content for the patterns of files. This all relies on the finding of so called  magic bytes\nA programme to do such a search could be the Ubuntu package magicrescue\nNormaly you should have backup... so all the problem should not exists... since you would revocer your files from  the backup. Just in case you do not have backup... Do not write anymore on the partition you expect to still contain some of your data. You might by this overwrite data valueable to you.\nA good procedure would be to use dd to backup the partitions content first.\nSome other tools you might wanna tryout are\n\n\n*\n\n*testdisk http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk (which has some ability to repair less sophisticated Filesystems like vfat/Fat32 etc) and also to search for files on lost paritions\n\n*System Rescue CD (A ios image of a live-linux which comes with some tools for data recovery for instance testdisk) http://www.sysresccd.org/SystemRescueCd_Homepage\ngood luck.\nPS have some more search in the Askubuntu.com.

I'll be honest I've run both OpenOffice and Libre Office and I'm not impressed with their speed/resource consumption both of them lag on my laptop and I don't think it's because of my hardware, for example Kile a Latex development environment based on Kate runs better although it's doing, I think more stuff in the background.\nSo is there another office suite/ word processor for a Kubuntu 12.10 installation, going with Kate seems too low end while doing everything in Kile is bringing in the big guns to early. \nI am mainly interested in speed and of course saving in a reasonably used format, not in having a lot of bells and whistles.\n\nA: There is abiword if you want a lightweight word processor. Others like Calligra are also available. By typing \"Word processor\" in the Software Center you should find many more:\n\n\nA: It's not for everyone, but you can consider going web-based. Google Drive (formerly google docs) works for me, especially the quick-edit on my laptop. It has the added benifit of not leaving my files on my laptop, which is at risk of being left in the train, stolen, and stuff like that.\nObligatory, but probably superfluous link: https://drive.google.com/\n", "Q: Large loss of files Here is the situation. I was playing with wine settings to see I could get to play some old games. Long story short I ended up removing wine. Right after my wife asked me to help her with something.\nAlong comes my beautiful and perfect daughter. I like, a fool did not close terminal. So with a combination of wild key presses she managed to enter the following command:\nsudo apt-get remove wine*\nHoly crap! This removed like 3/4ths of my installed programs. I am not a expert user but I know enough not to play with *.\nAt this point I'm about 80% sure I'm going to have to a fresh install. Does anyone have a better idea?\n\nA: What you can do is check out your apt-history, and (manually, I'm afraid) undo what has happend. \nCheck out /var/log/apt/history.log for that (from serverfault).\nYou could get pretty far with that as apt resolves a lot for you (if you do it the 'wrong way around' it fixes dependencies, so it might work well, but it will not fix your settings out of the box (the way you might expect \"hmm, I just found this protocol/program/whatever that works with this program, lets just set it up for you\") ... You might end up with some sort of frankenbox.\nMy advice would be: just try it quickly.

The Ambiance theme, and most other themes, has a gtk-2.0 folder and a gtk-3.0 folder.\nTo modify gtk-2 apps, you need to create a hidden file, .gtkrc-2.0 in your specific user's home directory. In this file you'll place mods that override the values present in /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc.\nTo modify gtk-3 apps, you first need to decide where the code is located. For example, in /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0 there are gtk.css, gtk-widgets.css, settings.ini, etc. Copy just the relevant file(s) over to the specific users ~/.config/gtk-3.0 folder and edit what you wish.\nAs described in the other answer, use Gnome Tweak Tool (but this could pull in a lot of other GNOME stuff which may or may not be desirable) or Ubuntu Tweak tool, which in my opinion is more versatile, to change to any other theme and back to your original theme. This step is necessary to get the changes to take effect.\nIn this way, you do not need to duplicate the entire theme or even create a ~/.themes folder. And all these changes don't need sudo.\n", "Q: NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 compatible with 12.10? I was wondering if the MSI NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 1GB card is compatible with ubuntu quantal quetzal.

Depending on what you are trying to do you can click the usb symbol and it should take you to an option screen. Choose Camera mode rather than MTP. This will let you access the memory in a limited fashion. I think there is a file size limit for when you try to transfer files.

I would like windows Office on Ubuntu but that means using Wine, which I don't want. I tried using wine but it went a teansy bit wrong (where i have no idea). So I tend to avoid it.\nHence the question : \nIs there any way I can get any program/plugin/patch/anyting-I-missed to get same functionality as MS Office in Ubuntu?\nI have Ubuntu 12.04 64bit (if required).\n\nA: LibreOffice is the best office suite for Ubuntu, in my opinion.\nYou can use Wine to run Office, as others have said, but personally I also find the experience less than satisfying.\nIn addition, there are other web-based apps e.g. Google Docs' presentation program and Slide Rocket.\nUltimately though, you might do well to think a little creatively and use graphics programs such as Inkscape(+Sozi), Gimp, Blender etc. - and come to think of it why not XMind? - in tandem with LibreOffice Impress to give yourself a much more satisfying range of professional presentation options.\nNote that LibreOffice 3.6 now has some fantastic wide-screen contemporary templates. This has been an area in which Impress has been particularly lacking. Sadly, it's one of these previous editions that you'll have in 12.04. A good reason to upgrade perhaps?\n\nA: What sort of functionality are you missing from Office? It's kind of tricky to answer your question without knowing. \nThere are alternatives to LibreOffice, but few which are as sophisticated as it is.  \nIf you want Microsoft Office without Wine, there is a web app version of Office which you can access through Microsoft SkyDrive. I've not tried them myself, but as they're made by Microsoft, I would have thought they'd have similar functionality to their Windows-based counterparts. \nIn terms of native apps, you might want to try AbiWord - it's a nice word processor which you can install straight from the Ubuntu Software Centre.

USB drives are cheap, and they actually perform better as a boot environment than the discs do anyway.\nIf you're starting out from Windows, you'll need to download Unetbootin (from http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/), which can either work with an ISO you've already downloaded, or just download one for you when you tell it you want to create an Ubuntu bootable USB drive.  Should be very easy and straight-forward.\n", "Q: unity-reset on boot - Ubuntu 12.10 Unity Problem I tried many many workarounds for the unity fix in 12.10 ubuntu version...\nI have ATI Mobility Radeon HD3650 graphics card..\nI managed to install the 12.6 version of it, and downgrade the X-Server from 1.13 to 1.12.3 using the code below of this guy 'Makarewicz'\nCode:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-legacy\n\nNow i using fglrxinfo i get\ndisplay: :0  screen: 0\nOpenGL vendor string: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\nOpenGL renderer string: ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3650\nOpenGL version string: 3.3.11653 Compatibility Profile Context\n\nbut still on boot i cant see unity.\nHowever using in a TTY unity or unity-reset, i can have unity, until i reboot...\nSo is there a way to make this permanent?\nThank you\n\nA: You'll need to add these line to /etc/rc.local.

I'd like to use anacron to run a job annually.  I see only daily, weekly, and monthly configuration for anacron.  Is there a way to run a job once per year?\n\nA: Ofcourse and it is already there with the possible selections you have: pick 1 specific day and 1 specific month and it will run once per year. Day 1 of month 1 would be on the 1st of January. \nAnacron has 2 ways of defining lines. The 2nd one is like this:\n @period_name delay job-identify command\n\nThe period_name can be set to daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or annualy. This will ensure jobs are run once a week, month or year no matter the number of days in this period.\nExample\n@yearly 0 job1 /usr/bin/execute_me\n\nThe 0 means no delay. job1 is an identifier and the command to execute.\n\nA: I think this would work unless my computer was off for all of January:\nFile in /etc/cron.monthly:\n#!/bin/sh\nmonth=`date +%m`\nif [ $month -eq 1 ]\nthen do_yearly_task\nfi\n\n", "Q: Problem using avconv to convert .mp4 to .webm I'll try to describe my situation:\nI have an android phone makes video in mp4 format.\nI like to share this video on my web page and jwplayer.\nSuch that operates well.

I am in the midst of building my own Ubuntu gaming computer, and I was wondering:\nIf I used a variation of Ubuntu, such as Lubuntu, would more resources be put into the game(s), because the operating system is for lower specs? Or would the game(s), for the same reasons, be slower than it would on regular Ubuntu? Or would they be effected at all?\nOn the other hand, for regular Ubuntu, would the same above apply to different desktop environments? \nHope this makes sense :S\n\nA: A few months ago, Phoronix posted some benchmark results of 3D performance with different desktop environments. You can find the article here: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_1204_desktops\nDo note that these were results from Ubuntu 12.04 so results may be a bit different in 12.10 or later. As you can see from the results, Unity tends to eat away a little bit more then other DE's. So, if you are going to make a system purely for gaming, it looks like using the Xfce (Xubuntu) environment will provide the best performance.\n\nA: In general the problem with gaming is the graphic card (it's a simplification, I know). Usually processor and memory aren't the bottlenecks. So the usual way of checking consumption is not really appropriate for this problem.\nThe real impacts comes usually because modern environments use graphic processing for handling the windows. This allows all this transparencies, previews, etc. But for games this is a major problem as it adds a delay in the processing.\nAll the environments are working to try to detect games and deactivate their \"3D processing\" on full-screen games.\nIt is a work in progress and each one is improving.\nSo in general the bigger consumption of a \"bigger\" desktop environment shouldn't be a problem but currently it might be.\nFor 12.10 this benchmark could give you an idea of how are the things. But this things are changing really fast. Take a look on this review:\nhttp://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_1210beta_desktops&num=2\nThey are checking different DE and including a bleeding edge improvement on KDE.\nYou should think if the differences are important for you (they aren't that big in most of the tests). And also you can install ubuntu for standard day work and install Lubuntu for gaming with:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nBut keep tuned. This is changing fast!\n\nA: Yes. You need to consume less resources if you have less resources. That goes without saying. This is what Lubuntu was designed for.\nAt the same time, if you have a more powerful system, you might have other motives for being frugal and might simply wish to free up your system resources from running a powerful desktop environment.\nYou can run all the same software on Lubuntu as Ubuntu and you should notice a marked performance increase etc. The only downside is a more primitive desktop environment, which not everyone appreciates.\nIn my own experience, there's nothing better than a light-weight OS such as Lubuntu or CrunchBang on a powerful system for performance. Of course, the spartan feel of Lubuntu is not to everyone's tastes. But you'd be suprised at how pretty people can make it.\n\nA: You're unlikely to see a big performance impact in-game from running one DE or another, unless your system is very short of RAM and the difference between the memory footprint of a relatively \"heavy\" DE like Unity and a relatively \"light\" one like LXDE or XFCE is enough to make a big difference in the amount of memory available for filesystem caching once your game is loaded.\nIf you have plenty of RAM, a lighter-weight DE may feel considerably snappier when using the DE itself, but the DE won't generally make a significant impact in how well a game will run once you're in the game and the underlying DE is basically just sitting there idle.\nIf you don't have plenty of RAM... well, even if you do prefer a lighter-weight DE, RAM is cheap.  You should get plenty of RAM.  It's worth it. :)\n\nA: I have switched all my gaming on my outdated laptop (hp pavilion dv6 1253cl) from windows 7 to ubuntu using the LXDE desktop.  It put me just over the gap to get 60fps in league of legends and never crash.  Usually if you're building an actual gaming pc this amount of ram and hard disk space you save is inconsequential, but being a guy who is relatively poor, all my gaming on windows has better performance through wine in lxde.  Also, still have all the performance of ubuntu and I can switch back in forth anytime.  So there is that small gap of computer performance that can make lubuntu just the trick.  Sometimes.\n", "Q: Printing with Lacie Lightscribe requires root privileges I have installed Lacie Lightscribe software on Ubuntu 12.04.

If so, remove them\" but I need more detailed step-by-step instructions than that, please.\nIs there anyone who knows how to solve this?\n\nA: You could use the SimpleLabeler application (see further below) and not the Lacie 4L lightscribe application as the former does not require root access and it works well straight away with most drives. I regularly use it and have never used gksudo or sudo.\n\nIf you want to use the Lacie 4L application, download the Lacie Labeller and the Host Software from the official site. Unfortunately, there are no .deb files available and no source code available, so you'll have to use alien to convert the rpms to debs. So run \nsudo apt-get install alien\n\nYou may find it helps to rename the rpms to something like 'Lacie_Labeller' and 'Lacie_Host', as the original file names are very long; they will be renamed by alien with the version number of the software anyway. So cd to the download folder and run for each rpm:\nsudo alien name_of_your_file.rpm \n\nThen install them individually with \nsudo dpkg -i name_of_file.deb\n\nThe LaCie LightScribe Labeler for Linux package should install fine.

If you can now boot into Windows and as I understand you can, try installing Ubuntu again but carefully select the right option, that is to have Ubuntu co-exist with Windows.\nYou might already have Linux partitions, since you had Ubuntu at one point in time, so you might want to delete those partitions if no data is there to keep, via the install Wizard, that takes care of the Ubuntu install. This will result in a clean install, for you.\nEDIT: Ubuntu by default, I think opts for multi-boot setup. But to restore and not install again, you could try this link: Grub restore\nWorked for me a few times when Windows 7 re-install changed the bootloader to it's own version.\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu alongside a pre-installed Windows with UEFI? I'm absolutely new to Linux. I would like to know how to install Ubuntu alongside the pre-installed Windows 8+ OS.\nShould I do it with Wubi, or through the Live USB/DVD?\nWhat steps do I need to take to correctly install Ubuntu?\n\nA: I'm not sure if this works, but for my case, my laptop has 2 hard disk slot. It came with 1 hard disk with Windows 8 pre-installed. Another hard disk is from my busted old laptop, and I just plug it in. Surprisingly, I can boot to Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.04LTS non-UEFI (of course I need to enable UEFI if I want to use Windows and disable if I want to use Ubuntu). \nNow my question is this: Is it possible to installed non-UEFI Ubuntu in the same partition as Windows 8, and boot it by disable the UEFI boot option? If that is possible, maybe we can temporary use this method until our grub are more stable to handle UEFI boot. By the way, currently my configuration on dual boot is like this.\nAnother way though, is to buy one external hard disk and install Ubuntu in that external hard disk. I attempt install Ubuntu on the external hard disk and I can say quite success. I can boot Windows 8 with UEFI boot option, and I can boot external hard disk by changing the settings of the BIOS. Of course this is done using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (non-UEFI).\nAnyway, in conclusion, for the mean time, avoid install Ubuntu alongside with Windows 8, as it is not very stable. I suggest using external hard disk (or if your giant laptop has 2 hard disk slot,use secondary hard disk) for Ubuntu. This will somehow avoid potential OS damage caused by M$ UEFI boot option.\n\nA: I had some trouble documented here.\nThe solution which I chose for now was to install Ubuntu in BIOS mode and leave Windows 8 in UEFI. I'm not sure if this represents a problem, since in the Ubuntu community it is said that both systems need to be in the same format, but I could get both systems working.\nThe only problem (more an annoyance) is that every time I want to change system I need to go to the BIOS setup and enable or disable UEFI.\nI could convert the Ubuntu BIOS to Ubuntu UEFI using this, but during the installation of Ubuntu I needed to create a Bootable BIOS... don't know what would be of that, so I preferred not to play with it. \nHope this can get someone going and if you have any suggestion for me, let me know. Thanks!\n\nA: With Packard Bell EasyNote TE was impossible to disable Secure Boot unless we set a password in the Bios. Once we set up a password, we could change  the Secure Boot value to false! \nI have a HP 250 with UEFI, tried and failed last year to install Ub but after reading this article, tried the new 15.04 distro and cracked it!  One prob, installed, but then would not boot into Linux/GRUB, but rather than sort out the GRUB issue I re-installed wiping the entire windows OS ( never liked Win 8 anyway, very very slow on celerons ).\nNow boots into Ubuntu on start up and everything so far seems fine.\n\nA: If you are new to Linux, I would highly recommend upgrading pre-installed version of Windows to current first. \nI had Windows 8 + Ubuntu dual boot laptop. When Microsoft forced me to upgrade Windows 8 to 8.1 I lost dual boot UEFI GRUB loader and stick to Windows for while. \nLuckily I managed to repair it from Windows when I installed Ubuntu for second time. As a potential new Linux user you wouldn't like to risk loss of Windows during installation, so I recommend to look at this page and install Live USB Creator. \nThat way you could run Ubuntu Live and then decide if you like it. \nLuis Alvarado gave thorough description, so if you finally decide to install follow his advice and read other sites.\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu 16.04+, many issues with compatibility are now solved. But still, depending on the version you are using and the hardware/model you have, you might need all or some of the steps provided in this answer.\nIf you are reading this in August 2017+, I can say that with Ubuntu 17.04 I have installed it on over 40+ Laptops with UEFI, ranging from Lenovo, Dell, HP, Sony, Acer and Toshiba where the models were 2016 and Up, and I have had no issues at all installing Ubuntu by simply following the steps in the installer. With the basic steps I mean:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the Ubuntu USB Installer\n\n*Select Install Ubuntu (Install Ubuntu alongside Windows)\n\n*Select Wireless Card & Upgrade 3rd Party software while installing Ubuntu\n\n*Finish installation and see Ubuntu install without any issue with Windows or Ubuntu.\n\n\nNow, this is not a 100% full proof verification. Am just mentioning that I am impressed by the fact that out of 43 total Laptops, 43 did not have any issues whatsoever on my end. Still, if you do have an issue, this is the reason why this guide was created.\nBefore explaining the steps to do it, I want to be clear that I have tried many ways of installing Ubuntu with versions older than 15.04 (Or any other distro for that matter) from within Windows 8 or Windows 10. No luck. Microsoft Windows really created a big mess for all Linux distributions. If you have a pre-installed Windows 8 system, you will probably never be able to install Ubuntu or any other OS in the normal (LiveCD/LiveUSB) or Wubi way. This is because Windows 8 introduced several new features, of which 2 are:\n\n\n*\n\n*UEFI which substitutes what we have known as the BIOS (an alternative to)  \n\n*Secure Boot which prevents anything but the installed operating system, in this case, Windows 8 from booting. This is no longer the case for Ubuntu since 12.04.2 so there is no need to disable secure boot. \n\n\nOn a further note I want to mention something about Secure Boot taken from the UEFI Wiki\nSecureBoot \n\"Secure Boot\" is a new UEFI feature that appeared in 2012, with Windows 8 preinstalled computers. Ubuntu supports this feature starting with 12.10 64 bit (see this article) and 12.04.2 64 bit, but as PCs implementing support for it have only become widespread at the end of 2012 it is not yet widely tested, so it's possible that you may encounter problems booting Ubuntu under Secure Boot. \nIMPORTANT: If you do find a bug, please file a bug report against the shim package in Ubuntu, preferably using the command:\nubuntu-bug shim\n\nonce you've installed with Secure Boot disabled. As mentioned by slangasek:\n\nIt is not required to disable SecureBoot in the firmware to install\n  Ubuntu on a Windows 8 machine. Ubuntu 12.04.2 and 12.10 are\n  SecureBoot-compatible. Any machine that ships with the recommended\n  Microsoft Third-Party Marketplace keys in firmware will be able to\n  boot Ubuntu under SecureBoot. If there is any problem file a launchpad\n  bug for the shim package.\n\nI also want to notify that I spend this week testing 15.04 and had an excellent outcome. Of 12 Laptops ( 4 Toshibas, 3 HP & 5 Lenovo) where Windows 8.1 was pre-installed, on all cases, Ubuntu detected the Windows Boot Manager correctly, gave the option to install alongside Windows 8.1 (It actually said Install alongside Windows Boot Manager) and solved any issues that appeared on previous Ubuntu versions. I basically did not have to do anything else on this cases. This was with Secure Boot on and on an EFI enabled boot system. I also. Tested 4 Windows 10 PCs and it worked perfectly with 15.10 & 16.04.\nThis does not mean that in your case it will work perfectly, it just means that on my cases, I had a 100% Ubuntu Perfect installation. Again, with 15.04 (Also on 15.10 and 16.04. On all cases it was 64-bit). I even had talks with users like Marius Nestor from Softpedia who actually had to disable Secure Boot in order for the installation to work, so it should be noted that, even if I currently have an excellent experience with Secure Boot, you might not. Keep this in mind when all else fails (We can thank Marius for his excellent contribution). I would in any case, send the bug report to the provided link above.\nSo with all of this said, installing Ubuntu via WUBI is not doable (not recommended at least from me), things like trying to boot for example with the Windows 8 bootloader are not possible right now unless something changes in the future (There are also some bugs related to this in launchpad, like the one mentioned by bcbc). Apart from this, WUBI does not work from within Windows 8 and up if you have UEFI with a GPT Partition (Not MS-DOS type partition). Pleas read Does UEFI support mean Wubi will now work on laptops shipped with Windows 8? for more information.\nNot only that, but trying to install 32 bit Ubuntu is impossible. You need the 64 bit version for everything to work correctly. Read more about Wubi in Can I install Ubuntu inside Windows?\nThe following is a small guide to install Ubuntu with a Pre-Installed Windows 8 or 10 system. The steps HAVE TO BE done in the precise order I mention them here to get everything started. If a step is skipped or done before another, you will most likely end up with some of the problems mentioned at the bottom of this guide.\nFor the time, you need to do it via a LiveCD, LiveDVD or LiveUSB, assuming (actually requiring) you have the following points:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are using a 64-bit version of at least Ubuntu 12.04.2. 32-bit versions will not work.\n\n*Your system came with Windows 8 or 10 pre-installed (And you do not want to delete it)\n\n*You are not installing Ubuntu inside of Windows 8 or 10 but rather alongside of it. Inside it is impossible because it needs Wubi which is unsupported.\n\n*Your system has UEFI activated (And cannot be disabled) with Secure Boot.\n\n*You have already created a free space for Ubuntu from within Windows 8 with at least 8 GB (I recommend to leave at least 20 GB or so, so you can test the hell out of it).\n\n*You made sure that you actually have free space left on the drive to create the needed partitions and you also made sure that you did not have all primary partitions used (In case of using an MS-DOS Scheme) because this will create a problem with the Ubuntu installer showing you only the \"Replace Windows\" option instead of the \"Alongside Windows\" option.\n\n*You know how to burn a LiveCD, LiveDVD or LiveUSB from within Windows 8. If not, look for Windows apps that can do that for you. I do mine in another PC with Ubuntu ^^.\n\n*Windows 8 was not shutdown in either Hibernation mode or any other mode ('fast start-up' which is by default on Windows 8) that leaves it on a saved state. Shutdown Windows 8 in the normal way, with the shutdown option. This will prevent other problems related to this from appearing. Read the bottom (TROUBLESHOOT) of this answer for more information regarding this point.\n\n*You are installing on an MS-DOS type disk scheme (You can only have 4 primary partitions as opposed to GPT Scheme) which has at least 1 Free Primary Partition (You can find out the type of scheme you have from here if operating on an Ubuntu Live CD or here if from Windows). Remember that if you are already using 4 Primary Partitions no partitions will appear on the Ubuntu installer since there are no more Primary partitions left to use (MS-DOS type partitions are limited to 4 Primary ones, GPT are limited to 128). This happens a lot on many laptops that come with 4 pre-created primary partitions. If you are installing on a GPT type partition and want it to boot, you need to leave UEFI enabled.\n\n\nPLEASE READ THE ABOVE POINTS SINCE MANY USERS JUMP THIS PART AND WHEN THEIR PROBLEMS ARE FOUND IT NORMALLY IS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT FOLLOW ONE OF THEM.\nBefore we start we need to do the following:\nRun compmgmt.msc on  Windows 8. From there on, create a partition with enough size. Note that I mention creating this FROM Windows 8 because I have had cases where doing the partition from the LiveUSB rendered Windows 8 unbootable, even after doing a boot repair. So to remove that problem or have a greater chance of removing it (Or simply skipping the problem altogether) and making sure both systems work, partition your hard drive from within Windows 8 first.\nNow follow this steps to have a working Windows 8 + Ubuntu installed on your system:\nWindows 8 + Ubuntu\nWe first need to know with what type of motherboard options we are dealing with. Open a terminal (By going to the start menu and typing PowerShell for example) and run the terminal as an Administrator (Right Click the app that will show in the start menu and select Run as Administrator). Now type Confirm-SecureBootUEFI. This can give you 3 results:\nTrue - Means your system has a Secure boot and is Enabled  \nFalse - Means your system has a Secure boot and is Disabled  \nCmdlet not supported on this platform - Means your system does not support Secure boot and most likely you do not need this guide. You can install Ubuntu by simply inserting the LiveCD or LiveUSB and doing the installation procedure without any problems.\nIf you have it Enabled and have the necessary partitioning done then we can proceed with this guide. After booting into Windows 8 we go to the power off options and while holding the SHIFT key, click on Restart. \n\n(This is a really old trick on most Windows, even since Windows 3.1 where you hold a key to do something special when rebooting)\nWindows 8 will show you a totally different restart window:\n\nWhen you get the menu above, select Troubleshoot\nYou will then get the following options:\n\nSelect UEFI Firmware Settings\nNOTE - In the Spanish version of Windows 8, the option for UEFI Firmware Settings is not available in several laptops, tested Lenovo, HP, and Acer. They do have an option to boot the computer and another custom menu will appear which lets you do a couple of things. In the case of Lenovo, you will not have an option to install Ubuntu with Windows 8, the only option is to remove Windows 8 completely. This only applies if you are not using 15.04+.\nTHIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART\nThe system will reboot and you will be allowed to go to the BIOS (If not press the appropriate key, some common are DEL,F2 or F10).\nIn this part, I can't help much since each BIOS is different for each Motherboard model. There are 2 options you can take here, both of which are optional since Ubuntu might install without any problems at all. You can either look for an option to disable Secure Boot or an option to disable UEFI. In some cases you will be able to find both, it will show in the BIOS as an option called Secure Boot or Enable UEFI. \nIf you find this options, then depending if you cannot install Ubuntu with Secure Boot enable then disable Secure Boot (Remember to report this as a bug using ubuntu-bug shim), to be able to still stay in UEFI mode and also be able to Boot with Ubuntu. In some motherboards, this will be the only option you actually need to change and also will be the only option you see related to UEFI because they will not offer the possibility to disable UEFI.\nDUAL BOOT ISSUES\nI would also like to mention an important note here. If you happen to install Ubuntu in Legacy Mode (No SecureBoot) you might have problems booting both, Windows and Ubuntu at the same time since they will both not appear on a Dual-Boot Menu. If you have Windows on UEFI for example and you install Ubuntu on Legacy Mode, you will only be able to boot to Ubuntu in Legacy Mode and Windows in UEFI Mode.\nSo before proceeding, make sure that you are installing Ubuntu with the same boot options as Windows. This way you will be able to choose which one to boot from in the same boot menu and not worry if one will work or not. From the Ubuntu UEFI Guide\nyou can see that there is a section that teaches you how to know if you actually installed Ubuntu in the same Boot setup as Windows (UEFI Mode):\nAn Ubuntu installed in EFI mode can be detected the following way:\n\n    its /etc/fstab file contains an EFI partition (mount point: /boot/efi)\n    it uses the grub-efi bootloader (not grub-pc)\n    from the installed Ubuntu, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) then type the following command:\n\n    [ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo \"Installed in EFI mode\" || echo \"Installed in Legacy mode\" \n\nSo if you have ANY dual boot problems, this could be the problem. Please read the Ubuntu UEFI Guide since it covers various ways of solving Dual boot problems and converting Ubuntu to Legacy or EFI mode. I have already tested this with various Ask Ubuntu members that helped me apart from 2 Laptops I was provided with for the testing. This should then solve any Dual Boot problems related to Windows 8 + Ubuntu, but I again encourage anyone with problems (same or new) to file a bug report as mentioned above. The Ubuntu Developers are working very hard in providing an easy to install solution for all cases and this is one of the top priorities.\nContinuing with the guide, in other motherboards that do offer the possibility to disable UEFI which would completely eliminate UEFI and Secure Boot on it and boot in the normal BIOS like way, if you find this is the way you want (To have a UEFI free computer and not face any of the problems related to this) then, by all means, do it. I for one have tested the Intel DZ68DB and did both case studies. Remember that doing so will make the Dual Boot process not work in almost all cases you will be left with a system that either Boot Windows in UEFI or Boots Ubuntu in Legacy.\nWith that in mind, remember to also select the Boot Order to make sure that it boots either your CDROM, DVDROM or USB Drive so you can boot from your Live Ubuntu image after rebooting.\nSome points we should consider before continuing:\n\n\n*\n\n*If Windows 8 was installed with UEFI enabled, it is highly recommended to stay in UEFI, although if you still want to disable it for specific reasons you can, GRUB will create the bootable part for Windows 8. But if you do disable UEFI and want to access Windows 8 afterward (before installing Ubuntu), it will not work since the boot part for Windows 8 needs UEFI (Again the Dual Boot problem).\n\n*If you only disable Secure Boot, there is no problem in some cases. You are only disabling the part that creates the most problem between Windows and Linux, which is the one that prevents Ubuntu from booting correctly. In either case, I encourage you to first try to install Ubuntu with UEFI/Secureboot, since in most cases it will work. if you disable any of them and install Ubuntu, you might not be able to boot to Windows 8 afterward through the GRUB Boot Menu.\nNow before saving, some motherboards offer a Boot Mode option. Verify that this option is not pointing to UEFI Boot but instead to CSM Boot (Compatibility Support Module) which provides support for Legacy BIOS like systems.\nOther systems offer a UEFI Boot option you can enable or disable. Depending on the options I mentioned above you can set this to the one you want.\nAnd lastly, others offer a UEFI/Legacy Boot First option where you select which one you wish to use first. Obviously, the option is self-explanatory.\nNow save the changes and reboot.\nWhen the Ubuntu Live image starts, it will show rather different than the normal one we are all used to. Do not worry, this is because Ubuntu has an alternative boot option when a system has EFI installed. Just select everything like you are used to. I highly recommend reading the following article in the Ubuntu site regarding Ubuntu installations when using UEFI. If there is a problem, then try to create a small partition (About 250 MB of size) for the EFI part of the system. This is done in the installation part where it asks you if you want to install on the desired partition or used the Advanced Options. Select the advanced options if you come up with a problem.  In there, create a 250 MB partition for EFI and the rest for GRUB and other stuff you are accustomed to.\nI think up to here you should be fine and have avoided several problems typically found when trying Ubuntu with Windows 8 which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not booting a LiveCD/LiveDVD/LiveUSB/Wubi\n\n*Not installing Ubuntu because of security issues (Yeah right, more correctly monopoly issues)\n\n*Not booting either Windows 8 / 10 or Ubuntu (not showing either one of them)\n\n*Not letting Ubuntu create a partition\n\n*Not recognizing the EFI part of the system\n\n*Ubuntu not recognizing the Windows 8 / 10 Partition\n\n*Not seeing GRUB and booting directly to Windows\n\n*Windows 8 / 10 not booting or readable because or partition changes are done from Ubuntu\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\nYOUR COMPUTER BOOTS DIRECTLY TO WINDOWS\nThis is a common problem and if you do not get a GRUB menu, re-installing or repairing grub will NOT HELP\nEvery BIOS/EFI system is different, it might look like one of the following pictures:\n\n\nNotice the \"UEFI Boot Option Priority\" or \"Boot Option Menu\". Usually, Windows is the default and Ubuntu (or as in the second picture elementary OS) will be an option.\nOnce you select Ubuntu on the UEFI boot menu you will then get a grub menu. You should be able to boot either Ubuntu or Windows from the grub menu.\nAnother issue that could make the system boot directly to Windows (without even showing the GRUB menu) is if either Windows took hold of the boot manager or after installing Ubuntu, the EFI partition was not properly configured for Windows. To solve this, simply go to Windows and open a terminal, then type the following (Need Administrative Privileges):\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\n\nThis will configure the Windows Boot Manager to take into consideration the GRUB Boot Manager. This could still happen even after running the Boot Repair from within Ubuntu. So making sure that Windows reads the Ubuntu EFI partition, in case you are using an EFI boot system instead of the old BIOS will solve it. In the above command line, the difference between shimx64.efi and grubx64.efi is that shimx64 is the actual Microsoft signed binary that works with Secure Boot enabled while grubx64 is the normal grub binary (Not signed).\nWindows 8.1 / 10 Not Recognized / Ubuntu not showing option to Install Alongside \nIf you have followed all the steps above including making a partition ahead of time through Windows 8.x, proceed with the normal Ubuntu installation. When you arrive at the option to how you would like to install it if you do not see the option to install Alongside it, select \"Something Else\" instead of wiping the hard drive. Configure the new partition layout on the empty space you've set aside that isn't Windows 8 / 10.\nYou need to create at least 1 partition for the root system (Which shows as the symbol \"/\") and set it to Ext4, another for SWAP (Virtual Memory). The SWAP space can be as small as 128MB if you have a lot of ram or as high as 4GB. With this 2 partitions created based on the empty space you provided you should be ready to proceed. And one last one for the EFI part which should be around 100MB.\nWhen the installer asks where to put the bootloader, tell it to put it on the partition with the type \"efi\". This will install GRUB which will load once your system starts in the future which will give you the choice of going with Ubuntu (or whatever flavor is installed) or going to the Windows Boot Manager which will take you to Windows 8.\nI would also recommend reading the following links to get additional information on some issues and causes in this particular part:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Install alongside\" option missing. How do I install Ubuntu beside Windows using \"Something Else\"?\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu alongside UEFI enabled Windows 8?\n\n*How to use manual partitioning during installation?\nREPAIRING THE BOOT\nAfter finishing the installation, if you happen to have Windows 8 disabled from booting and it only boots to Ubuntu, do not worry. In Ubuntu after it boots, install Boot-Repair in Ubuntu by opening a Terminal and typing the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair  \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\nboot-repair \n\nBoot Repair will mention that we have some GRUB error, that we have an EFI system and that Ubuntu rocks. Since Ubuntu rocks (It does not work if Ubuntu does not rock! ^^), just click on Apply so boot repair fixes everything. Now reboot and you should see Windows 8 and Ubuntu side by side.\nFor cases with rare booting problems, partitioning or using old hard drives on a newer motherboard, your solution might be checking out FixParts which solves misaligned partitions and other partitioned type problems.\nIf you are experiencing one of the following issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Loosing Data when copying from Ubuntu to Windows 8 after shutting down Windows 8\n\n*Can not access your Windows partitions from Ubuntu getting a Disk contains an unclean file system\nThis is most likely the cause of an option in Windows 8 called Fast Startup which behaves similar to hibernation and keeps a snapshot of the system so when you boot up, it will load faster. Since it keeps a snapshot, anything you copy or change in Windows 8 from Ubuntu after doing the fake shutdown will be lost (Apart from other issues found HERE).\nThe solution in Windows 8 is to go to:\nControl Panel --> Power Options --> Choose what the power button does\nIn here click on \"Change settings that are currently unavailable\" where you should see something like this:\n\nUncheck the option that says \"Turn on fast startup\".\nYou also need to disable hibernation. You can do this with this command (you need to be in a console with admin rights):\npowercfg.exe -h off\n\nThis should remove the hibernation file and enable partition to be mounted in Ubuntu.\nA demonstration video is now available on this issue. We can install Ubuntu 12.04.2 (64 bit versions) onwards with SecureBoot enabled. But we need to disable the SecureBoot after the Boot Repair step.\n\nA: Wubi doesn't work on newer computers with UEFI (see bug report http://pad.lv/694242). If you bought a computer with Windows 8 preinstalled it is almost certainly using UEFI (since this is required for Secure boot and all OEM Windows 8 computers are supposed to be secure boot). \nWubi uses Grub4dos to locate the Grub2 wubildr file. There is no support for GPT disks built into Grub4dos (and UEFI uses GPT disks unless it's booting in hybrid mode). In addition, with Secure Boot, it's not possible just to add new boot entries as before.\nSo, what you need to do is a normal dual boot. If you have secure boot (likely) then you need the 64 bit Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can do the same as you could in Windows 7, although I'm not sure I'd recommend it using the graphical boot menu (reason in the end).\nSome things first:\nThe usual setup for people who have dual boot configurations with Linux being one of the OSs that the machine has installed is to have a Linux bootloader by default, and there add an entry for the Windows OS. What that does is to load the Linux bootloader and if you want to load Windows it chainloads into the Windows bootloader which then boots Windows.\nSince usually there's only one Windows installed the menu selector of the Windows bootloader never appears giving the impression that the entry you added in the Linux bootloader actually loads Windows.\nThe opposite is possible too, although not common among Linux users. For instance, my main bootloader is the one from Windows which then chainloads into a Linux one to boot Linux; I have configured the Linux one to be mostly invisible and load right away though.\nHow to add a Linux entry in the Windows bootloader:\nIt really depends on what you install first and what later, I'm sure there are some guides around the internet to explain a detailed procedure on how to setup a dual+ boot environment. So I'll just go through 2 different setups:\nWhen you install Windows first: In this case when you're installing your Linux distribution, if it allows you to install the bootloader in a partition directly instead of in the MBR of the hard drive do so. After restart you'll find that you're booting Windows just like Linux was not installed at all, after that follow the scenario in which Linux was installed first described below.\nIf you can only install the bootloader in the MBR of the hard drive after the reboot you'll see a Linux bootloader (Syslinux, GRUB, you name it), choose the Windows entry there and boot into Windows.\nNow, I like to use EasyBCD (free for personal usage) to deal with the Windows bootloader, but anything that I do with it can be accomplished without with the proper bcdboot, bcdedit, etc. commands.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open EasyBCD and go to the \"Add New Entry\" section and the\n\"Linux/BSD\" tab.\n\n*Select the bootloader you have for your Linux distribution. In case\nof GRUB2 there's an autoselect mode which will select the\nappropriate partition for you, for Syslinux for example you have to\ncompulsory select the partition where it is installed.\n\n*Name the entry, the name you put there is the one that will appear\nin the Windows bootloader.\n\n*Select the partition where your bootloader resides or autoselect if\nthat option is possible. In the end you should end up with something\nlike this:\n\n\n*Click in \"Add entry\" and you'll receive the result in the bottom\n    left part of the program:\n\n\n*Now you have to restore the Windows bootloader as the default one,\nfor that go to the \"BCD Deployment\" section, there select to write\nthe Vista/7 bootloader in the MBR (which by the way is the same as\nfor Windows 8): \n\n\n*After that you're all set, you'll receive a similar confirmation as\nbefore. When booting up you'll see the boot menu prompting you to\nselect one of them:\n\nWhen you install Linux first: In this case you don't have to restore the MBR (Master Boot Record, tells what to execute next grosso modo) as Windows installation will overwrite any previous value there.\n\nNOTE: with UEFI and GPT disks this may be different though, but I have\n  no way of trying it out.\n\nWhy I'm not sure I'd recommend doing this using the new graphical boot menu in Windows 8:\nEssentially because the way it works is different than with the textual menu (default for Windows 7). In Windows 7 (or Vista) you're first presented with the boot menu and then it starts to load whatever you choose to, in the new graphical menu it first loads some stuff (= takes time) and then presents you with the boot menu. If you don't select to load Windows 8, it reboots the machine and starts to load whatever you selected which in this case is the Linux bootloader.\nI find waiting to load some stuff just to discard it and reboot unnecessary if I just want to boot another OS; but it's my personal opinion on the matter, there's no problem whatsoever by loading Linux, or any other OS in this manner.\nAnyway, there are different ways to use the textual boot menu instead in Windows 8, if you're interested check this answer out.\nSource from : Xandy\n\nA: If your computer comes preinstalled with 64-bit Windows 8 then you need to boot ubuntu using the secure boot option. In other words, when you are at the boot menu, choose to boot the drive as a secure device. Then you can install ubuntu. Most likely, after you install, you'll have to reboot after install using the disk and then do a boot repair.\nThe other option is you can boot the drive normally, do a normal install, and then still reboot after install and do a boot repair. This was the option I ended up doing.\nUbuntu 12.10 does a great job of resizing the windows partition and installing itself alongside Win8. For some reason, Grub is the problem. Once I installed, I could boot into Ubuntu with no problems but couldn't get into Win8. Running the repair got Grub fixed and then everything worked smoothly after that.\nHere's a great link that will probably help because it did help me: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n\nA: With Ubuntu, you really can't go wrong with preparing a live install media by using unetbootin. With unetbootin you can use your Hard Disk or an external flash drive for the installation media.\n1. installing on A Hard Disk\nIn the unetbootin window, choose Hard Disk from the drop down menu. Choose the Ubuntu ISO you want to install from and perform the rest of the steps needed to finalize the installation. The next time you boot up your system, you will see the unetbootin boot menu rather than booting into Windows.\n\n2. installing on a USB flash drive\nThis is fairly straightforward but you can't use this method to install OSes to UEFI-GPT systems unless you install the OS to run in legacy mode. To install to systems that use the BIOS firmware standard, this is the best and most practical method. The variation from the method depicted above is that you have to choose USB Drive in the drop-down menu in the unetbootin window. \n\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a LiveDVD or LiveUSB of Ubuntu (>=12.04.2) 64bit ONLY.\n\n*In your BIOS, disable QuickBoot/FastBoot and Intel Smart Response Technology (SRT). If you have Windows8, also disable FastStartup.\n\n*Boot your PC using the LiveDVD or LiveUSB and choose \"Try Ubuntu\". If you get a Secure boot or signature error, you may wish to disable SecureBoot, then retry to boot the disk.\n\n*Install Ubuntu from the Live CD/DVD or Live USB in the usual manner, then reboot the PC.\n\n*If the PC does not load Ubuntu (but instead loads Windows, for example, as in Bug #1050940), or if the Windows entry in the GRUB 2 menu does not boot Windows (see Bug #1024383), boot your PC using the Live CD/DVD or Live USB and choose \"Try Ubuntu\" once again. When the live session has loaded, run Boot-Repair (see link for details). When Boot-Repair loads, click on the \"Recommended repair\" button, and write on a paper the URL (paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXXX/) that will appear. Then reboot the pc.\n\n*This should fix most boot problems. If this does not fix your boot problems, please create a new thread in this forum, describing your problem and indicating the URL you wrote in the previous step.\nSource: Lifted word-for-word from this wiki.\n\nA: To install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8 (with UEFI, GPT support or not) is a simple or not so simple task, depending on your computer's specifications. Many things have been said in this answers and some of them are obsolete, as Hellreaver noticed. Because every new question about this topic is redirected here, I feel obligated to respond. Now I am not a programmer, so if I can do it, you can do it. \nThere might be a little difference between desktop and laptop computers, hence I will explain first for the desktop (easier) version.\nMany forms of UEFI are out there and every manufacturer has its own solution. For example, I use Lenovo Y580 laptop and it doesn't have an option to boot from a DVD. So I will present a universal solution (and the fastest one) - install Ubuntu from USB. To properly make a bootable USB you need to download RUFUS. Do not use Wubi (nor UNetbootin...) because to my knowledge, at the present time, they do not support all these technologies (UEFI, GPT...), so the only option that I know of and have tested successfully is Rufus. It is a simple and effective program. In case you are wondering whether you have GPT partition table or MBR, you can check this by opening Windows Disk Management, right-click on Disk0 and select properties/volumes tab/partition style.\nAs for other UEFI options, as Luis Alvarado mentioned, you might want to try installing Ubuntu with Secure boot enabled. If boot fails then disable it. You should also disable fast boot (if available) and enable USB boot as well. If everything else fails then you should install Ubuntu in Legacy mode. Afterwards, use Boot-Repair tool to adjust Grub2 (it is an automated process). Then you can boot both OS from the same UEFI mode.\nFor some reason (probably a bug) my UEFI doesn't recognize the bootable USB at first entrance, so I have to boot twice into UEFI to change the boot device order.\nAs for the installation of Ubuntu itself, if you are new to this procedure, take my advice and you should see some explanatory video, for it is reported that some people had some issues when it comes to selecting the installation type. Of course, if you want Windows alongside Ubuntu, you should choose the \"Something else\" option, it's the last one – not the first, as shown on the screenshot!\n\nThen select the partition for Ubuntu (whether to choose sda1, sda2, sdb1, sdb2...). The interface is different from Windows installation.There is a good post explaining this matter, but read it whole especially the OEM chapter. You must know why it is better to have separate root and home partitions, do you need swap area concerning SSD drives, etc.\n\nNow Luis Alvarado already mentioned that you should have free space, for your Ubuntu partition, formed and ready before you start the Ubuntu installation. It is for the best, and you can easily do it from Windows \"Disk Management\". Note that this partition must be an active type partition.\nThis is the point where laptop users should pay attention. My laptop came with Windows 8 preinstalled and with the software option for back-it-up. So it has a keyboard button near the power button, to backup/restore Windows in case something goes wrong. I don't believe you can repartition your hard drive (change its size) and not to mess up your backup software. Apparently it will alter the ID of the Recovery partition. That's why I recommend either to contact your manufacturer how to back-it-up on DVD or you can simply clone it with Clonezilla live CD/USB. It's no problem, obviously, if you have two hard drives, for example, an SSD and an HDD.\nBefore installing Ubuntu you should really try it first. It is important to know whether Ubuntu's current kernel supports all of your hardware.\n\nA: When I installed Ubuntu, the installation media didn't recognize Windows 8. I selected \"Something else\" option from installation menu and then installed it on a disc free space. After rebooting my PC, GRUB did recognize Windows. No problems. Maybe it will be helpful for someone having this issue.\n", "Q: Can I manually fix the wrong printable area settings of the printer?

Certain windows are too tall for the screen. For example save windows will have the \"save\" button off the bottom of the screen. This problem does not happen with the 2D desktop. Does anyone have a fix? Or is there a way to change the default size of such windows? \n\nA: Some windows, like save dialog boxes and even worse, some preferences windows have a fixed size determined by the program so there is no universal setting.\nThere is a workaround. Although it not a very nice solution, you could move the window by pressing Alt and drag the window to show the hidden part of it.\n\nA: Switching the dialog window to fullscreen helps in most cases.

In that line, I removed the ; nvidia-auto-select +0+0. The line now looked like this:\nOption         \"metamodes\" \"1280x1024_75 +0+0\"\n\nThis disallowed the settings manager to select the resolution it wanted and override xorg.conf, thus forcing the computer to use 1280x1024 by default.\n\nA: \nIn nvidia-settings, under X Server Display Configuration, click Save to X Configuration File.  If you've never done this before, it will complain about not being able to parse /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  Just tell it \"OK\", it doesn't matter.  You'll need to give it your password to elevate so that it can write to that file.  Once you've done this, your resolution (and other changes in nvidia-settings) will persist through reboots.\n\nA: My setting were going from 1200x790 to a default of 640x480.\nHere's the solution I found.\n", "Q: Rebooting from Ubuntu server - minimal desktop installation I installed server 12.10 with the \"--without-recommends ubuntu-desktop\" option - this gives a minimal Unity GUI, without most of the addons for a desktop user. \nBut now I cannot figure out how to reboot. There is no system menu with these options; calling reboot from terminal prompt requires access to root.\nStill very new to Ubuntu. How do I reboot from the GUI? control-atl-delete logs out, but does not reboot.\n\nA: Don't know if you can do it from the GUI, but from the Terminal, sudo shutdown -r now will do the trick.\nIf you want to power the machine off, sudo shutdown -hP now - the h is for halt, and the P is for Power off.\n\nA: When it prompts you for the root password, type your own password.

How can I do it?\n\nA: The Ubuntu One files app on the phone is not a synchronization client. It simply allows you to download some files that you have in Ubuntu One.\nYou can delete the files from your Ubuntu computer, or on the Ubuntu One web site, and the changes will be synchronized to all the computers you have connected to Ubuntu One. Note that on the computers where you did not perform the delete from, the files will simply be moved to trash.

The issue would be that VirtualBox does not virtualize the GPU. There's hope though. Search the web for VirtualBox PCI passthrough.\n\nA: If you're running Ubuntu virtually as a guest, Ubuntu will see a virtual graphics card, specific to VirtualBox.

You should be able to verify the signature by right-clicking on the .sig file at that point.\n\nA: Dobey is correct -- once you've got the seahorse-nautilus package installed, you can verify files by right-clicking and assuming you use GNOME, it's probably going to be the best option for you.\nThat said, if you have trouble with that, you could also check out my gpg/openssl frontend Pyrite.

I'm trying to download source code of certain packages, for example rhythmbox, for learning purposes. I want to do this through apt-get, with the apt-get source command.\nFor some reason, apt-get can't seem to find any package. I've tried several packages, and I keep getting this output from apt-get:\n$ apt-get source rhythmbox\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nE: Unable to find a source package for rhythmbox\n\nI've been searching for answers for quite some time now, but I can't find anyone with the same issue. apt-get works fine with installing and updating so apt-get works fine in my opinion. During the search I also learned that I had to enable the 'source code repositories' in Software Sources, so that's also enabled.\nI am aware of the fact that (maybe only for certain packages, not sure) source packages can also be downloaded with bzr from Launchpad, but I want to know why this method won't work.\n\nA: Open the Software Center and choose Edit -> Software Sources. Which server do you use? I'm using \"Server and United States\" and just downloaded the source for rhythmbox just fine. I'm on Precise.\n\nA: apt-get source rhythmbox only works if you have the source repositories turned on, updated your package list, AND you actually have that repository in your sources.\nIf, for example, you installed a normal Ubuntu install and didn't add any apt repos. Then all you need to do is make sure \"Source code\" has a check by it. If you added extra repos, then you need to have two entries for each repo. One for \"main\" (usually) and one for \"source\".\nAlso just in case you haven't. Run apt-get update again to get all the new repos. \nNow apt-get source installs source for the exact package you installed. This means that ifyou installed the deb from some-odd-ppa (main) then the source needs to be in some-odd-ppa(source). Packages installed from some-odd-ppa will not pull source from other repositories because it's not the same version.\nI have checked and rhythmbox is available via source repositories. You simply haven't included the right source repository in your apt repos, or you haven't run apt-get update yet.\n", "Q: Triple-display setup using AMD drivers I am currently running a dual display setup with nVidia 8800GTS video card, on a Ubuntu 12.10 box. The current setup uses nVidia TwinView to render the image on a 1920x1200 display and 1600x1200 one.\nI'm planning to add a third, 1280x1024 display to the setup. The change will require me to upgrade my GFX card to one supporting triple displays. I'll probably go with Sapphire Radeon 7770 (FLEX edition, to avoid additional active DP->DVI adapters).\nBefore I invest in new GFX I wanted to ask - how well the AMD drivers will support such a setup. It does not matter whether it's fglrx or the OSS ones. If I remember correctly, when running Fedora on a Radeon x800, I had 'void' areas above and below the working area on my second display. The desktop was rendered in 1920+1280 width and 1200 height (which left 176px of vertical space accessible for my cursor and windows but not displayed on the screen - I'd prefer to avoid that). It may have very well been my misconfiguration back then. Generally, are there any solutions from AMD on par with TwinView? Or is it a non-issue at all?\nAlso, I'm wondering about the usual stuff - hardware h264 decoding support, glitch-free flash support, any issues with Compiz/Unity?\n\nA: I've been running Eyefinity since the 5000 series came out, which allowed me to ditch the external splitter box I had previously been using. It took AMD another 8 months to add support to the Linux drivers, but they did it.\nAs far as I'm aware, to run three monitors from the same card, you need Eyefinity, and they need to output the same resolution. If that's changed since my 5770, I apologise, but that's my understanding of the tech, so you may need a second card. (nVidia would require a second card in any case - I checked on their website just the other day.)\nPerformance-wise, for general use they're great. No complaints to speak of, really. Flash is fine (installed via the Flash-Aid FF plugin), video is fine, no problems.\nI'm in the Steam beta, however, and the performance in games sucks! I'm working on getting the latest drivers installed from the AMD site to see if there are any improvements, but the config isn't being kind to me. Pro tip: install from repo via Jockey or similar, and leave it at that! You get the full Catalyst control centre, and you don't have the install hassles.\n", "Q: 12.04 custom kernel migrate to 12.10? Just like it says in the title, if I customize the kernel for the computer, does it stay that way if I were to update to 12.10? Thanks!\n\nA: The largest condition is the version you're running. If your kernel still newer than the latest version in Ubuntu — eg you installed 3.6 before upgrading to Precise, and it's packaged in a similar way to Ubuntu's kernels — you'll stay on your custom version.\nIf you installed a custom version of 3.0, or whatever was running on 12.04, and you hadn't done anything special with the versioning, grub will likely rank the newer kernels higher. That's just how it works.\nWhatever happens, the upgrade shouldn't remove your custom kernel. It should still be available in grub and you can remove the newer ones after (if you want to keep using your older one).\nNote: it's not recommended to stick with an old version of the kernel without applying security updates. If you're going to run an ancient version, make sure you're applying patches and recompiling the kernel on a regular basis to remain safe.\n", "Q: I burnt Ubuntu to a cd, and when I went to install it, it asked me to remove the cd and press enter.

Any help?\n\nA: Try holding Shift during boot-up.\nIf that doesn't work, then the GRUB bootloader is not installed.\nYou'll need to reboot into the Live CD, open up the Terminal (CTRL - ALT - T) and type the following commands:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub2 /dev/sda\n\nIf you run those commands successfully, and you're still booting straight into Windows, then reboot again and hold Shift while it's starting up.\n\nA: I don't know if this will solve your problem, but give it a try.\nIn Windows, right-click Computer and go to System Properties->A*dvanced System Settings*.\nThen go to Startup and Recovery.\nCheck the Time to display list of operating systems if not checked, and give it the number of desired seconds (30, for example). Just in case, set the Default Operating System to Ubuntu.\nNOTE: The above steps are for Windows 7. It may vary for other versions.\n\nA: This problem can be solved in the following way\n\n\n*\n\n*once prompted to remove dvd and close the tray and press enter, do it without any delay. \n\n*now your system starts with windows automatically, if not you start your system. \n\n*wait for all windows services to start.\n\n*now go to startup folder, you will find wubi there.\n\n*click on it and follow the instructions ubuntu gets installed.\n\n", "Q: Cannot perform installation due to \"This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect.\" error I am trying to do a fresh install of 12.04 on a system running Windows XP. I only want to run Ubuntu as my OS. After downloading and unzipping the file when I try to run wubi I receive the error:\nThis application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. \n\nReinstalling the application may fix the problem\" I have tried too reinstall numerous times and still I receive the same error. Can some one help me please help me?\n\nA: You can use Wubi, just don't try to do so by unpacking the ISO image like an archive. Instead, you can download Wubi.exe from the Ubuntu website (where it is called \"the Windows installer\"), then put it in a folder with the ISO image. This folder should contain just two files--Wubi.exe, and an Ubuntu ISO image for the same version of Ubuntu. Then run Wubi.exe, and it will install Ubuntu, using data from the ISO image.\nThis was essentially answered by bcbc in a comment:\n\nYou lose me at 'unzipping the file'. You can either download wubi.exe\n  and run it, or the Desktop ISO. You don't unzip the ISO although some\n  archival software will open ISOs for you. If you have the ISO, then\n  download wubi.exe (make sure it's the same release) and place it in\n  the same folder as the ISO and run Wubi.\n\nOr you can run Wubi.exe without the presence of an Ubuntu ISO, and it will automatically download the Ubuntu ISO image and use the image it downloads. (This might be seen as unnecessarily wasteful and slow if you already have the ISO image you need, though.)\n\nA: If you only want to run Ubuntu as your OS - if you no longer want Windows XP - then you should not be using Wubi.  You should be installing directly to your hard drive, by either burning a DVD with Ubuntu or (preferably) creating a USB thumbdrive installer.\nWARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING - if there is data on your hard drive you want to keep, back it up before installing Ubuntu to the hard drive directly!\nThat said, when you're ready to proceed - download the Ubuntu .iso from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop.  I strongly recommend you select 12.04 LTS, not 12.10.  You may either burn that .iso to a DVD (instructions here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/burn-a-dvd-on-windows) or you may create a USB thumb drive (instructions here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows).  Again, I recommend the USB thumb drive if possible.\n", "Q: Dual Booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10 - thinkpad x230 I am having problems getting grub to load Windows 8 properly after installing Ubuntu 12.10 and Windows 8 on a solid state drive.

I have tried numerous times of which either nothing happened or my interface ( menu bars, the top and left bar on desktop, and the ability to close a window) would disappear. Apparently I'm not making the connection on how to get these to install properly. I have tried numerous other posts and websites and attempted \"bumblebee\" to no avail. I am wondering if anyone can write a step by step guide of commands  that I need to run in terminal to get this to work. I've had to reinstall 12.10, so if you could walk me through the process of getting the drivers downloaded and installed, I would greatly appreciate it. I barely know what I'm doing, and this is quite a turn off for someone new to Ubuntu, I really want to enjoy it but this is preventing me from committing. Thank you in advance, and I apologize for being so flustered / helpless with this but I have ran out of patience with this.\n\nA: G'day,\nI'm not sure if this will help, but I had a lot of trouble getting graphics drivers working in 12.04 on my Optimus machine.\nHere is the procedure I eventually used to get it running smoothly: How do I get a Dell Latitude e6420 working?\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: I had same issue.  Turned out it was a missing headers issue.  \nsudo apt-get install linux-source    \nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-current   \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure nvidia-current-updates\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\n\nA: there are two possible methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing the driver from the official Ubuntu repositories (\"nvidia-experimental-310\") removes bumblebee-nvidia because the package depends on nvidia-current. To avoid this, you need to get the Bumblebee source and repackage the deb with the nvidia-experimental-310 dependency instead of nvidia-current. You may also need to adjust the Primus paths and recompile it.\n\n*Add a PPA that uses the nvidia 310 drivers as \"nvidia-current\" not \"nvidia-experimental-310\". There are some (like this one: https://launchpad.net/~2nv2u/+... ), but I don't recommend using an unofficial PPA for this. The only official PPA with such a package is, as far as I know, the xorg edgers PPA: https://launchpad.net/~xorg-ed... which has \"Xorg packages fresh from git\" so it's not stable.\n\n\nKeep in mind that if you add the xorg edgers PPA, do a dist-upgrade, but you'll get many other packages with the driver (you can't just install the nvidia-current package)\n", "Q: How can I turn off my server when i am in the login screen? I would like to turn off my server by pressing the power button. The problem is if I am in the login screen (I haven't logged in yet). Pressing the power button will not shutdown my server.

Spotify will show up under the sound icon in the upper right so that you can skip songs or pause/play without even having to open up the window, and you can always click on the icon (also in the upper-right) to get the functions gotten from right-clicking the taskbar icon under Windows.\n", "Q: USB stick detected but can't be mounted I have a Kingston  DataTraveler SE6 8GB USB stick which I use as a liveusb medium.

The screen resolution is stuck at 1024x768 and the other option is 800x600 but my monitor has the option resolution of 1366x768.\nMy system configuration is: \n\n\n*\n\n*Intel i7-2600k\n\n*Intel Z68DB motherboard\n\n*8GB RAM\n\n*Intel HD2000 Graphics(No graphics card....)\n\n\nI have tried using cvt and xrandr but it changes to default 1024x768 after every reboot.\nAlso i am not able to find the xorg.conf file.\n\nA: Wow, we have the same hardware except for the monitor (yours is better). Anyway some rare monitors report having lower resolution (at least 1 resolution lower) than the maximum they support. I have a 1920x1080 TV that only works correctly up to 1680x1050.\nMy guess is to start playing with xrandr. For example, assuming your monitor is VGA-0 and the resolution you want is 1366x768, then do the following in a terminal:\nxrandr --addmode VGA-0 1366x768\nxrandr --newmode \"1366x768_60\"\nPlay using the --addmode and --newmode settings until you get the one you want. Remember to change the refresh rate also. I put 60 here but could be 50, 55 or other ones for the maximum resolution.\nCiting the information from HERE we have this:\nAdding undetected resolutions\nDue to buggy hardware or drivers, your monitor's correct resolutions may not always be detected. For example, the EDID data block queried from your monitor may be incorrect.\n\nIf the mode already exists, but just isn't associated for the particular output, you can add it like this:\n\n\n  $ xrandr --addmode S-video 800x600\nIf the mode doesn't yet exist, you'll need to create it first by specifying a modeline:\n\n\n  $ xrandr --newmode <Mode``Line>\nYou may create a modeline using the gtf or cvt utility. For example, if you want to add a mode with resolution 800x600 at 60 Hz, you can enter the following command: (The output is shown following.)\n\n\n  $ cvt 800 600 60\n  # 800x600 59.86 Hz (CVT 0.48M3) hsync: 37.35 kHz; pclk: 38.25 MHz\n  Modeline \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\nThen copy the information after the word \"Modeline\" into the xrandr command:\n\n\n  $ xrandr --newmode \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\nAfter the mode is entered, it needs to be added to the output using the --addmode command as explained above.\n\nThere is also a section about Setting xrandr changes persistently which can help if the resolution you set does not stay after you reboot.\n\nA: I think in the display settings you have to un-check 'Mirror Displays' and then select the right resolution. That should solve your problem. Do this setting even if you are using just one monitor.\nIn case you are using two monitors you should identify which monitor should be your primary one and at what resolutions should each monitor operate.\n", "Q: Wubi wants AMD64.tar.xz, I have Intel processor \nPossible Duplicate:\nDifference between the i386 download and the amd64?\nIs the 64-Bit version of Ubuntu only compatible with AMD CPUs? \n\nI have an Intel CPU but wubi wants to download wubi-amd64.tar.xz.

Additionally, it seems faster on big PDFs:\n# extract page range 20-40\nmutool clean in.pdf out.pdf 20-40\n# extract from all over the pdf\nmutool clean in.pdf out.pdf '1, 3-4, 74-92'\n\n\nA: Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with pdftk --version 3.0.9 from May 11, 2018 (date shown at the bottom of man pdftk).\nIf using pdftk, here's how to format it for multiple groups of pages:\npdftk in.pdf cat 13 18 33-36 39-41 52 output out.pdf\n\nThis will capture those groups of pages, inclusive.\nTo install and/or update pdftk:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install pdftk\n\nRelated:\n\n*\n\n*[my answer] How to rotate PDF pages: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/394065/command-line-how-do-you-rotate-a-pdf-file-90-degrees/634882#634882\n\nA: In any system that a TeX distribution is installed:\npdfjam <input file> <page ranges> -o <output file>\n\nFor example:\npdfjam original.pdf 5-10 -o out.pdf\n\nSee https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/79626/8666\n\nA: There is a command line utility called pdfseparate.\nFrom the docs: \npdfseparate sample.pdf sample-%d.pdf\n\nextracts  all pages from sample.pdf, if i.e. sample.pdf has 3 pages, it\n   produces\n\nsample-1.pdf, sample-2.pdf, sample-3.pdf\n\nOr, to select a single page (in this case, the first page) from the file sample.pdf:\npdfseparate -f 1 -l 1 sample.pdf sample-1.pdf\n\n\nA: Very simple. Use the default PDF reader, select \"Print To File\" and that's it!\n\nThen:\n\nNote that with this way, the text will no more be searchable, instead all texts are converted to images: this is how \"Print\" works.\n\nA: PDF Split and Merge is quite useful for this and other PDF manipulation operations.\nDownload from   here\n\nA: Unfortunately, Ubuntu do no provide command to do that directly.\nBut you can use pdfseparate and pdfunite in conjonction (both comes by default with your Ubuntu)\nSo if you want to extract page 32 to 65 of sourcefile.pdf in a new file called extract.pdf, you can type these commands :\nmkdir tmppdfdir\npdfseparate -f 32 -l 65 sourcefile.pdf tmppdfdir/page-%d.pdf\npdfunite tmppdfdir/page*.pdf extract.pdf\nrm -rf tmppdfdir/\n\nWarning : Be sure that tmppdfdir do not already exists before !\n\nA: QPDF is great. Use it this way to extract pages 1 to 10 from input.pdf and save it as output.pdf:\nqpdf input.pdf --pages . 1-10 -- output.pdf\n\nThis preserves all metadata associated with that file.\nFrom the old manual:\n\nIf you wanted pages 1 through 5 from infile.pdf but you wanted the rest of the metadata to be dropped, you could instead run\n\nqpdf --empty --pages infile.pdf 1-5 -- outfile.pdf\n\nHere's a link to the current documentation, giving more examples of page selection.\n\nYou can install it by invoking:\nsudo apt-get install qpdf\n\nIt is a great tool for PDF manipulation. It's very fast and has very few dependencies. From QPDF's GitHub repo:\n\nQPDF is a command-line tool and C++ library that performs content-preserving transformations on PDF files. It supports linearization, encryption, and numerous other features. It can also be used for splitting and merging files, creating PDF files (but you have to supply all the content yourself), and inspecting files for study or analysis.\n\n\nA: pdftk (sudo apt-get install pdftk) is a great command line too for PDF manipulation. Here are some examples of what pdftk can do:\n   Collate scanned pages\n     pdftk A=even.pdf B=odd.pdf shuffle A B output collated.pdf\n     or if odd.pdf is in reverse order:\n     pdftk A=even.pdf B=odd.pdf shuffle A Bend-1 output collated.pdf\n\n   Join in1.pdf and in2.pdf into a new PDF, out1.pdf\n     pdftk in1.pdf in2.pdf cat output out1.pdf\n     or (using handles):\n     pdftk A=in1.pdf B=in2.pdf cat A B output out1.pdf\n     or (using wildcards):\n     pdftk *.pdf cat output combined.pdf\n\n   Remove page 13 from in1.pdf to create out1.pdf\n     pdftk in.pdf cat 1-12 14-end output out1.pdf\n     or:\n     pdftk A=in1.pdf cat A1-12 A14-end output out1.pdf\n\n   Burst a single PDF document into pages and dump its data to\n   doc_data.txt\n     pdftk in.pdf burst\n\n   Rotate the first PDF page to 90 degrees clockwise\n     pdftk in.pdf cat 1east 2-end output out.pdf\n\n   Rotate an entire PDF document to 180 degrees\n     pdftk in.pdf cat 1-endsouth output out.pdf\n\nIn your case, I would do:\n     pdftk A=input.pdf cat A<page_range> output output.pdf\n\n\nA: I was trying to do the same. All you have to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*install pdftk:\nsudo apt-get install pdftk\n\n\n*if you want to extract random pages:\npdftk myoldfile.pdf cat 1 2 4 5 output mynewfile.pdf\n\n\n*if you want to extract a range:\npdftk myoldfile.pdf cat 1-2 4-5 output mynewfile.pdf\n\nPlease check the source for more infos.\n\nA: Page range - Nautilus script\n\nOverview\nI created a slightly more advanced script based on the tutorial @ThiagoPonte linked to.

It is a frontend for python-pyPdf.\n\nInstallation\nsudo apt-get install pdfshuffler\n\nUsage\nPDF Arranger can crop and delete single PDF pages. You can use it to extract a page range from a document or even partial pages using the cropping function:\n\n\nPage elements - Inkscape\n\nOverview\nInkscape is a very powerful open-source vector graphics editor. It supports a wide range of different formats, including PDF files. You can use it to extract, modify and save page elements from a PDF file.\nInstallation\nsudo apt-get install inkscape\n\nUsage\n1.) Open the PDF file of your choice with Inkscape. An import dialog will appear. Choose the page you want to extract elements from. Leave the other settings as they are:\n\n2.) In Inkscape click and drag to select the element(s) you want to extract:\n\n3.) Invert the selection with ! and delete the selected object with DELETE:\n\n4.) Crop the document to the remaining objects by accessing the Document Properties dialog with CTRL+SHIFT+D and selecting \"fit document to image\":\n\n5.) Save the document as a PDF file from the File --> Save as dialog:\n\n6.) If there are bitmap/raster images in your cropped document you can set their DPI in the dialog that appears next:\n\n7.) If you followed all steps you will have produced a true PDF file that only consists of the objects of your choice:\n\n\nA: Apache PDFBox is open source Java tool for working with PDF documents. It comes with a command line tools that can split pages from pdf, among many others things (see manual here).\nTo use it simply install the pdfbox-app-2.?.?.jar and execute a command like:\njava -jar pdfbox-app-2.0.20.jar PDFSplit -startPage 1 -endPage 10 -outputPrefix ch1 book.pdf\n\n\nA: ThiagoPonte's Ghostscript answer is great for its portability, but it does not explain how to use a discontinuous page list, such as 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. That is possible with -sPageList:\ngs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sPageList=2,6-9,11 -sOutputFile=out.pdf in.pdf\n\nHowever I could not get it to work on older versions of Ghostscript, for which case, inspired by a Stack Overflow question, I created this shell script that only relies on -dFirstPage and -dLastPage:\n#!/bin/sh -f\nif [ \"$#\" != 2 ] && [ \"$#\" != 3 ]; then\n    >&2 echo \"Usage: $0 pagelist infile [outfile]\"\n    exit 11\nfi\nrange=$1\ninfile=$2\noutfile=${3-\"${2%pdf}\"out.pdf}\nset --\nIFS=,\nfor i in $range; do\n    set -- \"$@\" \"-dFirstPage=${i%-*}\" \"-dLastPage=${i#*-}\" \"$infile\"\ndone\ngs -sOutputFile=\"$outfile\" -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH \"$@\"\n\nYou can save it in a PATH directory such as /usr/local/bin/, make it executable with chmod +x scriptname and then just call\nscriptname 2,6-9,11 in.pdf out.pdf\n\n\nA: If you want to extract pages in a WYSIWYG way, then pdfarranger offers a nice and simple GUI. It can also join PDFs, and you can rotate or crop pages.\n\nWorked great on a TurboTax file, which pdfmod couldn't open.\nThe only (tiny) donwside was that it couldn't export some metadata and the table of contents was lost, but I verified that the exported selection included all pages I had selected, so the tool did its job.\n\nA: If you want to extract from your PDFs, you can use http://www.sumnotes.net.\nIt's an amazing tool to extract notes, highlights, and images from PDFs.\nYou can also watch tutorials on Youtube by typing sumnotes.\nI hope you will enjoy it!\n\nA: I have started to put together a tool to provide a simplified interface to common actions.\nYou can slice out a subset of a PDF like this:\n$ npm install @mountbuild/mouse -g\n$ mouse slice input.pdf -s 15 -e 25 -o output.pdf\n\nThis will create a new PDF for pages between and including 15 and 25.\nIf nothing else check out the source and see how to write your own script to do this in JavaScript.\n\nA: LibreOffice Draw\nLibreOffice is able to edit PDFs and create new ones, and that allows you to easily and interactively select page ranges with your mouse.\nThis way you can easily inspect which pages you want visually and then immediately move them around without having to note the page number and go to the command line.\nAnother advantage is that almost every Linux desktop user is already going to have the fundamental LibreOffice package already installed in their computer, but if for some reason you don't:\nsudo apt install libreoffice\n\nThen, just open the PDF, e.g. from the CLI:\nlibreoffice raymond.pdf\n\nor just open LibreOffice from the GUI and then File > Open.\nOnce opened, you will see:\n\nNow to split the document up:\n\n*\n\n*Select a page range from the page index on the left. You can use the usual range shortcuts:\n\n*\n\n*Shift for range endpoint\n\n*Ctrl to select or unselect individual items\n\n\n\n*Ctrl + C or Right click > Copy\n\n\n*Ctrl + N or File > New to create a new document\n\n\n*Ctrl + V on new document to paste from the old document\n\n\n*No to \"Do you want to scale the copied objects to fit the new page size?\"\n\n\n*Shift + Delete or Right click > Delete Page to the pre-existing initial blank page from the new document\n\n\n*File > Export As > Export Directly as PDF.\nIf you are doing this a lot, you might want to assign a keyboard shortcut to this option under Tools > Customize > Keyboard.\nThe PDF shown in the above examples is: http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/education/382v-s08/papers/raymond.pdf which is a rendering of [The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric S.

So my advice will be all trial and error but hopefully you will get it sorted with my help.\nNow the usual way when Ubuntu is installed second over the top of the second the grub replaces the MBR record so you use grub and do the following\nTo enter the GRUB configuration mode, type in sudo grub (from command-line and press Enter.) Then type in the following commands in sequence:\nroot (hd0,0) \nsetup (hd0) \nquit \nexit \n\nThe above should work in grub boot commandline - else use live CD and just run from CD and use the terminal.\nIn your case, you would want to make some changes to this as this setup assumes that you are on the same HDD. Change all \"hd0\" to \"hd1\".\nSo it will look like this: \nroot (hd1,0)\nsetup (hd1) \nquit \nexit\n\nWhat you are doing is getting grub to pick up the Windows 7 installation and set it up in the grub.\nAlternatively you will need to do a reverse with the Windows 7 but alter the MBR information within Windows 7 by adding an additional line to the boot loader to get it to boot the Ubuntu.\nWindows 7 bootloader has been made more complicated and you need to use bcdedit to modify it. Unfortunately, adding with it could prove to be a big hassle their is an alternative way which is using a program called EasyBCD which will make altering the Windows 7 boot loader easy.\nIn theory, it should work just remember it is on a separate HDD but from what I have read that shouldn't be a problem.\nCheck Boot Linux using Windows 7 boot loader for more information on Windows 7 bootloader.\nIf you want to do it both ways that is entirely up to you but give those 2 options a go and see what happens after that.\nHopefully this will give you some direction as to what might be going wrong with your current situation if it doesn't fix it.\n", "Q: How to share files/media online Can someone can direct me to a how to that explains not only how to install an FTP but also how a family member on another coast can access this via online?

Any assistance in this matter would be eternally appreciated.\n\nA: If you want to setup your own server, I'd recommend to install something like \"owncloud\" which is a web application for uploading and sharing files using the web browser (such as dropbox, iCloud or ubuntu one) (more info http://owncloud.org/)\nTo install it on your ubuntu computer (that will work as the server)\nsudo apt-get install owncloud\n\nYou can then access the server using any web browser by entering the url http://YOUR-IP/owncloud , it will ask you for the basic config (such login info) the first time you enter.\nKeep in mind that if you'r going to access the server from outside your house (or network) you will have to redirect port 80 from your router to your server.\nAlso, home internet connections are not designed for servers, thus the upload speed is normally low for a server, so expect no-so-fast file transfers when moving files from the outside to your server and the other way around.\nI would also consider getting a free account from a cloud provider (ubuntu one, or dropbox, they both offer 5 gig free) and use that to share files, its simpler, faster, you dont have to worry about setting or mantaining the server yourself.\n", "Q: fresh install, update and x-windows no longer working after login 12.10 I Just recently installed desktop 12.10 on laptop, all was working fine logged in and it stated it wanted to update as it found updates.\nnaturally I let it update and it asked me to reboot to use the new updates\ndid that, now it boots fine i get login prompt.\nlogin as per normal\nthen all i get is background with nothing else, if i turn off the wireless i get the disconnection notification pop up but i have nothing else on screen any wrror messages gets displayed as well but their is nothing.\ntheir was one program that failed that no longer prompts which gives options of reloading or just closing and continuing either way it just look like it hangs I can ctrl alt del to log out and it does that fine but still wont load no mater how many times i try\nsaw a topic about a ati driver playing up which he typed the following in a ty which i can get to all of them as well.\nexport DISPLAY=:0;gnome-shell --replace\nthe answer i got back was the program gnome-shell is not installed you can install it by typing sudo apt-get install gnome-shell\ni also tried sudo pkill X which did nothing\nany help would be appreciated\nThanks\nGnome shell was not installed - installed gnome-shell and this has not made any difference to the issue. \nI have looked into this as my machine was running while unattended i saw that there was an error that could have something to do with this issue.

In my case, I think I did it to myself because I was actually doing things to the language and keyboard settings.  Fortunately, the menu items seem to come up in a combination of English and Chinese, so I was able to find the tool I needed.  First, read this:\nInstall/Remove Language show only English, no other choice\nNote the positions of the controls in the dialog.  They will be labeled in whatever language you have set, but they will be in the same place.  You have to drag \"English\" or any other language you want to the top of the list.

You will be prompted for your password.\nWhat I can't figure out is why I had Chinese localizations installed in the first place.\n", "Q: GET flash memory type: SLC or MLC Just for my knowledge, I would like to know whether the type of flash memory used in my pendrive is SLC or MLC. Is there a way to find it out? I googled but found nothing.\n\nA: The correct answer was given by Mechanical Snail(check the comments above) on Stack Exchange. The answer's brief and simple, every Flash device uses a MLC because it is cheap and has a higher density. Giving SLC to the customer would make the pendrive costly as cost per gigabyte for SLC is more than MLC. For uses like these MLC is always preferred over SLC.\n\nA: Most of the pendrives are using NAND MLC. SLC pendrives are rare and usually more expensive. Some examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Zalman U3M16 16GB SLC Flash Drive\n\n*Mach Xtreme MX-ES Ultra SLC USB 3.0 Flash Drive\n\n*Lexar JumpDrive Triton 32GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive\n\n*IronKey S200 1GB USB flash drive\nI am sure with a little googling you will find more. Interestingly most of the Workspace pendrives, which should be endurable, use MLC, so I guess that is sufficient as well, and we don't really need SLC.\n", "Q: Power USB at certain CPU temperature I have an unusual server set-up. Basically, I have a combination of salvaged parts from 3 Powerbook G4s running a non-graphical distribution of lubuntu. Problem is, I'm better with hardware than the software side of things.\nI'm powering a USB fan (as all other connectors are gone) that I want to turn on when the CPU reaches a certain temperature. Eventually I'll install a proper temperature sensor, but for now that will have to do. \nI'm sure there's a simple script I could write for this which could run in the background monitoring the temperature and enabling power to the USB port. Any ideas? Suggestions?\n\nA: i think you could turn on/off your fan by running the following command:\n# turn off\necho suspend > /sys/bus/usb/devices/usbX/power/level\n\n# turn on\necho on > /sys/bus/usb/devices/usbX/power/level\n\nreplace usbX with usb1, usb2 or whatever\nthen you would have to check the temperatur periodically, for example by running a script every minute using cron job. You can take a look at this german article to see how to implement it. Don't worry if you do not speak german. The bash script from the example is pretty easy to understand without the surrounding text.\n", "Q: Why am I getting so many errors? I have had Ubuntu 12.10 installed for about two hours now.

I don't even know what information might be helpful here, but if you ask for it I will give it.\nThanks,\nAndrew\n\nA: Did you check the ISO/IMG file's MD5SUM? I had experienced a \"successful\" installation of Ubuntu, but every program randomly crashed. I re-installed Ubuntu again and the same thing happened.\nIt turned out that the ISO file downloaded was missing a few bits, so the MD5SUM did not match.\nI downloaded the image again, checked the MD5SUM, and Ubuntu worked without any problems.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: Try uninstaling Ubuntu Tweak. I've found that some of the third part programs for tweaking Unity cause odd problems (make sure you reset everything to default settings first). I would also suggest checking Ubuntu Tweak's website to see if you have the newest version. Hope this helps!\n\nA: Install additional drivers from the software center if possible and install any needed drivers. If that doesn't help, start chrome from the terminal by typing google-chrome and tell us the output from the terminal.\n\nA: I had a similar problem and it had something to do with the amount of memory I had.\nTry @Upper Jack 's answer first, then go ahead with other ones. This is often a problem, even if only a few bytes are off it creates major havoc, if you get my drift.\nFirst off, try installing/using for a day LXDE. \nIt's really easy to do, just open up terminal Ctrl + Alt + T and enter the command sudo apt-get install lubuntu-lxde \nThis will simply install the LXDE DE (Desktop Environment) and will allow you to select it on login.\nTry doing this and then rebooting. When you log in, select Lubuntu from the menu. If this runs fine, then you have a fix! If not, try the following.\nTry comparing your computer's specs to the required ones for Ubuntu and see how close they are (memory-wise/video card-wise).\nIf they are rather close, that could very well be your problem.\n", "Q: Ctrl + R alternative for Guake I have been a heavy user of reverse-search-history( Ctrl+R ) functionality in gnome-terminal(Default terminal client in  Ubuntu).

In the interest of most web developers, who wish to upgrade to 12.10 from 12.04\nBut for most, the preventing factors are like -\n\n\n*\n\n*12.10 is not an LTE release.\n\n\nNeed clarifications here -\nwhat support and benefits exactly do canonical provide for web developer community as an LTE release? Is it worthy considering LTE or going for an upgrade.\n\n\n*\n\n*There are enough stories of users breaking their system after the upgrade to 12.10.\n\n\nWhy are the upgrades not seamless?\n It should work without breaking the system, like one click upgrades, and not re-installs  every 6months.\nThanks, \na web developer who loves ubuntu12+.\n\nA: The support means that canonical will still be providing security updates to the software, that means that packages such as apache2, php, and every package you have installed will still be receiving security updates. Note that security updates means fixes and paches for software malfunction, but it will not update a package to a new version, for example, if a new version of apache comes out, you will not get that installed unless you upgrade your ubuntu version. \nThis is actually good for servers, because if for example you make a web app that works great with a certain version of php, and a certain version of apache and mysql, you dont want those to be upgraded at anytime and possibly break something and give you a hard time trying to find the problem. But that doesnt meen that you will not get security updates for a long time (if you dont update) because if you use a LTS version, you will still be getting those security updates for 5 years without the need of updating.\nFrom what i can say of the other side of the coin is that the upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 is NORMALLY seamless (except if for example, some of your apps are not compatible with new versions of software as mentioned above). It appears it's not because here in askubuntu and most forums you will only hear the bad stories of people whose upgrade went bad and they'r seeking for help, because people who succeed normally dont make threads saying they succeed.\nSo to conclude, i'd recommend to stick with LTS version if your computer is a dedicated server which cannot afford to go down a few hours. If that server is also a desktop computer which you use for other desktop apps and you turn it off once in a while, and you always want to have the most newest possible versions of software, you might be good updating.\n", "Q: Battery died when updating from 12.04 to 12.10 I started the update and went to sleep but I forgot to plugin AC adapter.\nWhen i woke up, laptop was off.
