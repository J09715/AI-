I'm trying to upgrade an Ubuntu 12.10 installation to Ubuntu 13.04 without an Internet connection. Now that the alternate and desktop CDs have been merged, I'm trying to use the 13.04 Desktop CD in order to upgrade my 12.10 system. In Ubiquity, there is an Upgrade Ubuntu 12.10 to Ubuntu 13.04 option. So I guess this is doable.\nSteps to replicate:\n\n\n*\n\n*In a virtual machine, install a clean, fresh Ubuntu 12.10 system. Apply all available updates;\n\n*Shutdown the VM;\n\n*Disconnect network cable from the VM. Make sure your VM has no Internet link -- remember I want to do an offline upgrade;\n\n*Insert the Ubuntu 13.04 beta 2 installation ISO in the VM. Reboot the VM;\n\n*Select your desired language, and select Install;\n\n*On Preparing to install Ubuntu screen, make sure again that you see no Internet connection available. This prerequisite should be marked by an X on this screen. If an Internet link has been found by Ubiquity, disable this connection before continuing;\n\n*Then, on Installation type screen, observe that the Upgrade Ubuntu 12.10 to Ubuntu 13.04 option is greyed!!! It cannot be selected.\n\n\nWhat is strange is the upgrade option as again available if an Internet connection is found by the installer. Repeat the previous steps, but this time, make sure your VM has an Internet link. Back on the Installation type screen, the upgrade option can be selected.\nIs this a bug in Ubiquity? Is it normal -- the expected behavior -- for Ubiquity to require an Internet connection in order to perform an upgrade from Ubuntu 12.10 to 13.04?\n(Please note that I did not have any problem doing an online upgrade using Software Updater from my current 12.10 install. That is not what I want to achieve -- I already wrote the online upgrade guide. What I want to know is: how can I perform an offline upgrade using Ubiquity on the installation disc?)\n\nA: I posted a bug report about this in Launchpad. I got the following answer from Dmitrijs Ledkovs (xnox):\n\nIt is correct, we do not support offline upgrades via ubiquity/desktop\n  CDs. And even for servers, it is not recommended to use new server CD\n  to do offline upgrade.\nThe support upgrade methods are with internet connectivity or a local\n  mirror / package pool. One can for-example use tools like aptoncd to\n  snapshot all installed packages, download them on a machine that has\n  internet connectivity, bring them to the offline machine and upgrade\n  it.\nThe reason behind this move, is enourmous amount of support cases of\n  broken and partial upgrades since newer installation media will be\n  missing manual additionally installed packages; packages that have now\n  transitioned to new names; packages that have been removed from the\n  default installation. Thus default install media for next release\n  simply doesn't contain everything one will reasonably need to upgrade,\n  hence the internet connectivity requirement.\n\nSo here the answer: even when using the Ubuntu installation disc, one cannot upgrade the a newer version of Ubuntu without Internet connection. Ubiquity needs to have an Internet connection in order to make the upgrade option selectable.\nI understand the reasoning behind that. The installation disc cannot have all the repositories' packages. If a user has installed additionnal softwares after he installed Ubuntu -- and he certainly has --, then without an Internet connection, Ubiquity would fail to upgrade every packages, update dependancies, resolve missing dependancies, etc.\nI'm a bit disappointed, though, as because if this limitation a user who wants/have to proceed with an offline upgrade will need to grab another media. He can't just use the same installation disc/USB key he usually lend his friends for them to install; he will need to grad extra packages.\nI'm not familiar with APTonCD. I'll look deeper into this avenue later.\n\nA: I went with a 90% offline method :). This is how - I used the DVD containing the iso image. I opted for \"Try Ubuntu\". After logging in, I ensured that internet connection is working fine. Then I chose Install Ubuntu (it was one of the icons in the menu bar on the left). The process downloaded some additional software from the web, but it did use the DVD for most of the installation.\n", "Q: Why BIOS isn't recognizing USB drive during installation? I have a laptop that I would like to install ubuntu on. This laptop has windows xp on it, but windows wont load. I have ubuntu loaded onto a usb drive, but the computer I am trying to install it on will not recognize the usb drive in the BIOS menu. \n\nA: you may enter the bios and chose the boot device and then save the bios setting and reboot.Though you do not really need to change the boot priority.In fact my samsung laptop always come across this phenomena,it's my solution.It seems that by entering the bios and pretending to change and save the bios setting can make the computer recognizing the usb device.\n\nA: Ran into same problem, answer was that you have to go into the BIOs option about Hard Disks. In mine it saw the USB as a second HDD so I had to change the priority so it would read the USB \"Hard Disk\" first instead of the actual HDD which it did by default.\n", "Q: Lower version of Ubuntu? So I have a 702MB disk that I'll be using, and Ubuntu 12.10 is 753MB. Any way to get an older version of Ubuntu for my disk, then upgrade later? Thanks in advanced!\n\nA: No need. Yes, the size of the iso exceeds that of the capacity of a standard CD. You can either create a live-dvd or live-usb with it. Yikes! The solution is to create a minimal cd. It downloads and installs all the missing packages after you've installed ubuntu. Follow this link to download it. You don't need to download an old distribution, you can download a minimal cd of 12.10.\nYou may want to see answers for this question\n\nA: dont go for older version. just make bootable predrive using unetbootin. you will save you CD also \n", "Q: How to recover Python on Ubuntu 12.10?

Thing is have my linux partition inside another one, \"extended\", which I am not allowed to unmount even when booting from live DVD. In other words, sda4 (the extended) includes sd65 (with ubuntu) and sda5 (the swap).\nThis happened after second installation process. I don't know why the installation process made that. Anyway, I cannot work with remaking sizes while not unmounting sda4.\nClues?\n\nA: Yes, you can still resize the partitions using gparted; it's on the Ubuntu installation medium (either DVD or USB) so you can boot into a live session and run gparted, or you can install it in Ubuntu from the Ubuntu Software Center.  Gparted has a very good track record with this sort of thing, but anytime you mess with resizing or moving partitions it's best to have a backup of your data.\nOf course, if you just did the installation again, just specifying correctly the partitions sizes that you really want, you'll still end up using gparted, so in a way it's the same solution either way.\n\nA: You can install g-parted available from the software centre.It allows you to partition the hard drive without without the requirement for installation of ubuntu all over again.\nAfter installing g-parted, right click on the drive \npartition,unmount them and delete them.Then select new and allot the drives as primary or logical and select the partition size. do the same with other partition drive.\nRemember to create backup of your documents just in case you have created some after installation.\n", "Q: Anyone have problem with HP printer printing only in green?

The log for this is apparently /var/log/X.2.log, but this did not show any errors. Also had to ctrl-alt-del out of this.\nI then created a new user and could login using it, but it would not log out. I could also look into the old-user directories down about 5 levels but had no rights to look at any files. If I read your logic correctly this all means that xorg and lightdm are both ok and that it is a problem with my old user configuration.\nPerformed logical testing procedure thanks to coteyr and followed his advice step by step to find the personal config was \"borked\" for unknown reasons. Instead of deleting .config I did as suggested and typed:\nmv .config .config.old \nwhich I gather backs it up and allows a new .config to be created next time you boot/login.\nThis allowed login of my original user and hence direct access to all my old files. \nHowever, there were a few \"12.04 has experienced an error\" windows popping up to do with: \n/usr/bin/gnome-session\n/usr/bin/gsettings\n/usr/bin/l2tpIPsecVpn\nall crashed.\nSo in the end this was not a lightdm or xorg problem, but a unity/gnome config problem.\n7th May: Since the second login on 12.04 I have not been able to get online, but have just been able to check using wifi, which works. So my DSL connection is now not recognised. I know this is not the same question but can anyone help or should I post this as an additional problem? \n\nA: Seperate your login issues from X issues. \nFirst try logging in to a VTY. Press Ctrl + Alt + F1 and login.\nOnce logged in try running sudo X :2 & you should be taken to a black screen with a X for a mouse pointer. If you do then X is fine, and your problem is your configuration of either lightdm or your desktop. This is common with large upgrades. \nIf X doesn't start then back at the terminal (etrl + alt + f1) run cat /var/log/X.2.log | grep EE that will return all errors. We will need that to really go any further down this path.\nIf X did start then go back to the terminal (ctrl + alt + f1) and create a new user, then try to log in using that user. sudo adduser testing will create a new user called testing. \nIf you were able to log in as testing, then your personal configuration is borked. If you could not log in as testing (in X) then lightdm is borked. \nTo fix your login the best way is to just delete (after backing up of course) your home directory contents. Then copy back the files you need from backup. This will reset all your settings but is a sure fire way to make sure your config issue is addressed. You could also delete just the .config directory, or all the hidden directories. However make sure you have backups. \nTo fix lightdm, you can probably just do sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm. If it's still lightdm and still causing the issue, we will need the full lightdm log (/var/log/lighdm) use pastebin or something to add it to your question. \n\nA: once you login at the terminal, try running\nsudo pkill lightdm\nthen\nsudo lightdm\n(tell us if that fails, and if so, what error msgs)\nWhen ever you see \"Permission Denied\" This means the command probably requires root permissions. use sudo  to gain root permissions. \nlightdm requires root to run.\nif possible, post your dmesg information.\nAlso, have a look at this post, specifically running fail safe X.\nAfter Upgrading to 12.04 I can't get to the login screen\n", "Q: Problems rendering in Kdenlive So I have a basic Kdenlive project; HD 720p 24fps.\nWhen I click render, everything starts okay but then it's finished after about 10 seconds and says everything was done successfully.

My understanding of disc partitioning has always been that you partition a disc to install multiple operating systems so you can boot from multiple operating systems on a single disc. However I'm reading a ubuntu server book and it talks about partitioning the /home directory of a ubuntu installation. \n\n\"The /home directory is a popular partitioning candidate among both administrators and desktop users alike because it holds all of the personal files for user accounts on that machine. If you maintain /home as a separate partition, you can install new versions of a distribution or even different distributions altogether without wiping out any user settings.\"\n\nI don't see how and why anyone would partition the home directory or any other directory for that matter in the file system of a ubuntu installation. \n\nA: You quoted the answer to your own question...\n\nIf you maintain /home as a separate partition, you can install new versions of a distribution or even different distributions altogether without wiping out any user settings.\n\nA partition is just a way to separate the files in the hard drive, it doesn't need to be a place for an operating system. If your system partition and your home partition are separated, if you upgrade your system it'll only affect the system partition, leaving your data alone.\nThere are other uses for a different data partition such as encrypting it or a having a different filesystem than the operating system's one.\nNote that Linux treats /home, /usr, /var... as folders, even if they are separate partitions (they are mounted at bootup). So having a separate /home partition won't affect you in any negative way, go ahead and do it.\nIf you intend to have a server someday, I'd advise to use a separate /var partition, and probably a separate /usr and /tmp too.\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu to a hard drive the installer takes care of partitioning. In case it finds an empty unpartitioned space it will use this for your Ubuntu Installation. If you had already installed an OS the Installer will let you shrink a partition to then hold Ubunutu.\nBy default a single partition, and an additional swap partition will be created. In case the installer finds a pre-existing swap partition it will not create an additional one. We may want to hold our HOME in a separate partition, be it to \n\n\n*\n\n*mirror this partition\n\n*easy format the OS partition without deleting HOME\n\n*having the OS on a fast SSD but HOME on a conventional drive,\n\n*or a variety of other reasons.\n\n\n\nNote that it is not a good idea to share all of the HOME partition with different distributions or releases as this may lead to conflicting configuration settings from differing application versions. Rather than sharing all of HOME we should share data on a shared partition only. These data directories can then be symlinked to from the user's home subdirectories.\n\nIn the following sections let me depict procedures for having HOME on a partition or a drive different to the OS:\n\nBackup all of your important data before you change partitions.\n\nDesktop installation\n\n\n*\n\n*On installing Ubuntu choose \"Something else\" to have access to the partitioner.\n\n*If the drive was used before, remove the partition table or delete partitions to hold your Ubuntu. All data on these partitions will be deleted.\n\n*Create a new partition to hold the OS root directory.\n\n*Choose the mount point / for this root partition:\n\nNote the different mount points you may be able to choose for any partition created.\n\n*Repeat step 3. and 4. for the /home partition:\n\nIn case there is a pre-existing HOME partition holding data we now have to make sure to untick \"Format?\" before we proceed with the installation to not delete this data:\n\n\n*Choose \"Install now\" to partition and format the drive and proceed with the installation.\nUbuntu Server installation\nThe server installation will guide you through the partitioning using partman. At the partitioning step we may delete, or create new partitions similar to the desktop installation. Shown below are interim steps when we do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose \"Manual\" partitioning for an individual setup:\n\n\n*Choose partition to change or free space to create a partition\n\n\n*Select mount points / for root or /home for HOME:\n \n\n*Repeat steps 2. to 4. until finished:\n\n\n*Continue server installation:\n\nMove exisiting HOME to a different location\nSee question and answers below on procdeures to move the HOME directory to a different partition or drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move home folder to second drive\n", "Q: How to revert back to previous state from current updated state in ubuntu 12.10? I updated my Ubuntu 12.10 . after updating it asked for reboot, I rebooted my system. After rebooting my system it shows only blank (black) screen , No mouse cursor ,No terminal Nothing. I want to revert back to my previous state of system just before the update happened.\n(I remembered some packages installed while updating they are XORG ,Linux-header,etc..)\nThanks.\n\nA: It is not clear from your post whether you have installed proprietary graphics driver manually (not from software center/addtional driver)\nIt also seems the updated software contain a new kernel. So removing such update, I won't recommend at all. Also in near future you will have problem updating.  \nIf the above two statement are correct. Please note, you need to reinstall the graphics driver again for the new kernel.\nTo verify, on grub menu (Press shift while booting if you use ubuntu as only OS), \ngo to Advanced option and boot to any older kernel listed there. IF this works flawlessly, then update your graphics driver as mentioned in the following question.\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?\n\nA: Enter recovery mode from GRUB. Can you log into your account? If so, make a backup of your files and check your error logs under /var/log so you can tell what's happening. You can not revert an update, but you can, and should, update again:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n", "Q: Contents of Downloads folder are gone ubuntu 12.04 My downloads folder was there till evening. I went to my room and did a ssh onto my work machine and I find that the downloads folder is empty. I have some important files in downloads folder. Can anybody help me finding my contents?\n\nA: Just check whether your folder is hidden or not.\nIf it's not hidden than I think the folder has been deleted by mistake ..\nSo you can see the section for recovering files and folders here :\nHow to recover Deleted Files and Folders?\n", "Q: How to supress 0 deletion in bash script arithmetic operations? As an example, here is the code:\n#!/bin/bash\ns=00\nuntil [ $s -eq 60 ] \ndo\n    let \"s += 1\"\n    echo $s\ndone\n\n$s will be 1, 2, 3 etc, but not 01, 02, 03 etc. How can I avoid this deletion of 0?\nSo, I need $s to be 01-09, then 10, 11, etc.\n\nA: Add the zeros when you print it.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\ns=0\nuntil ((++s == 60 )); do\n    printf '%02d\\n' \"$s\"\ndone\n\nNumbers with leading zeros will be treated as octal, so values like 08 and 09 will fail. Therefore it's best to operate on the numbers without the leading zeros and only add the leading zeros when you need to print it.\nAlso see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/018\n", "Q: Lubuntu Wine IDM set up with Chromium help needed i'm very new to this forum and to linux. switching from Windows OS is tough at the start and i'm having few problems. i installed Lubuntu because i've old system. i totally love it but i have one major issue.\ni want a download manager for Lubuntu. i searched in software centre but couldn't find any good one. so i installed Wine and some how i managed to install it correctly. after that i installed IDM successfully. but the problem starts now, when i open any download link, chromium automatically downloads itself. means it doesnot open IDM.\ni installed an IDM plugin as well but still it doesnot work.\nanother thing i did was to manually copy download link address to IDM, and i can see the file and i click resume button but download doesnot starts.\nwhat should i do ? any other download manager i need to try ?\n\nA: As it is possible to install and run Windows applications with Wine this should usually not be needed, and it may also lead to instabilities due to an often not 100% compatibility (see Wine database for compatibility issues).\nMany Windows programs have their native Linux counterparts, and I strongly recommend searching for these before we decide to give up, and use a Windows program with Wine. Ever so often you may also find that you simply do not need to install any additional application, because Ubuntu already had the best choice installed for you.\nA good place for searching is the Ubuntu Software Center, but also we do have many questions here to give advice on applications to replace the Windows counterparts. For a download manager recommendation see:\n\n\n*\n\n*What download managers are available for Ubuntu?\nYou will soon find that applications provided from the Ubuntu repositories will nicely integrate with the desktop, i.e. you will easily be able to select any of these applications for standard actions such as downloading, or opening a certain file type.\nThis will not be the case for Wine applications. In case you really do need a Windows application for a given task we then have to manually define a .desktop file to announce this application to the system. For doing so see the following question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How does one create a custom application launcher for Wine installed apps?\n\nA: If you really want something as similar to IDM as possible then I'd suggest Flareget. It does the same thing as IDM. \nUse this with Firefox and you can even download videos embedded in sites like how IDM does. \nI'm on my phone right now so I will edit this answer with the direct links later in the day \n", "Q: Wireless interface stopped working after routine updates I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 on a Lenova ThinkPad.

However after upgrading to 12.10, I only get 200-300kbps when I try to perform the same operation. \nI have tried different usb sticks (which work flawlessly on Windows 7) and still experience the same issue. I experienced the same issue sometime ago on 11.10 but everything was normal when I upgraded to 12.04 so it might be a kernel issue.\nHere's the output of dmseg |tail:\n    mysterio@mysterio-HP-Pavilion-dv6700-Notebook-PC:~$ dmesg |tail \n\n[  871.023093] sdb: sdb1 \n[  871.026909] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdb] No Caching mode page present \n[  871.026920] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdb] Assuming drive cache: write through \n[  871.026927] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk \n[ 1036.226206] ISO 9660 Extensions: Microsoft Joliet Level 3 \n[ 1036.233561] ISO 9660 Extensions: RRIP_1991A \n[ 1086.342973] ISO 9660 Extensions: Microsoft Joliet Level 3 \n[ 1086.343010] ISO 9660 Extensions: RRIP_1991A \n[ 1173.971357] ISO 9660 Extensions: Microsoft Joliet Level 3 \n[ 1173.971441] ISO 9660 Extensions: RRIP_1991A\n\nI have updated my system with the latest updates. What could be wrong? \n\nA: Despite the pessimism of Rodrigo's very thorough answer, I suspect the majority of these cases are simply due to the default behaviour of usbmount or equivalent hotplug handlers to force writing to disk instead of caching. You should check whether sync is enabled for the device, e.g, by looking for the corresponding line from cat /proc/mounts. It may look something like:\n/dev/sdb1 /media/usb0 fuseblk,sync,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,noatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,allow_other,blksize=4096 0 0\n\nNote the sync flag. You need to prevent this from being set. If you mount manually you should change the fstab entry as in this answer. If it's automounted have a look in \nthe output from tail /var/log/syslog just after plugging in and look for a line like:\nJul 21 19:28:51 my-machine usbmount[3823]: executing command: mount -tntfs -sync,onoexec,nodev,noatime,nodiratime /dev/sdb1 /media/usb0\n\nIf it is being mounted by usbmount you can follow my advice in another answer and change the MOUNTOPTIONS line in /etc/usbmount/usbmount.conf from:\nMOUNTOPTIONS=\"sync,noexec,nodev,noatime,nodiratime\"\n\nto\nMOUNTOPTIONS=\"noexec,nodev,noatime,nodiratime\"\n\n\nA: I fear that your problem has no solution. USB slow transfer rates are a phantom in Ubuntu history, that comes and goes away from time to time. It happens because developers in the majority of cases are not able to reproduce this problem and then no solution will be released.\nYou can see a phenomenon of discussions about USB transfer rates being slow in Ubuntu (and its \"cousins\"). For example you can see this thread, this discussion and this other thread.\nSome say that enabling or disabling Legacy USB Support into the BIOS solves the problem, although it seems as specific rare cases.\nThere is a bug reported at LaunchPad that presents a workaround for the issue, but as it is somewhat outdated I can't evaluate it's effectiveness nowadays. The workaround is presented by Jean Pierre at Bug #66115 he talks about the workaround in this comment and after in this more detailed comment.\nA hot discussion is about the sync mode being enabled when Nautilus mounts a device, although beyond Konqueror (KDE equivalent to Nautilus) I haven't found anyone who got sync option disabled for Nautilus.\nSome workarounds of doubtfully effectiveness are discussed in this Super User's Question.\nIf you got no luck until here I shall tell you that there exists no solution for the problem currently.\nThere is currently a bug reported in LaunchPad and you can mark it as a problem that affects you. If your hardware differs from the one that is reported from the bug you may add a comment reporting your affected hardware.\n\nA: Well, there are various reasons why USB transfer is slow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Size of the files being copied. ( the samller the files, the slower it gets)\n\n*The speed of the USB stick.\n\n*The way the USB stick is formatted.(NTFS, Fat32, or EXT4)\n\n\nSo if the stick is formatted as NTFS keep reading.\nNTFS on Linux works a little different to most other filesystem drivers, and so data to be written to an NTFS filesystem actually goes through the CPU. For most filesystems, the CPU doesn't directly deal with the data to be written.\nThat's why writing to an NTFS formatted stick in Linux is slow, than writing to NTFS on Windows.  So you could format your USB stick as Ext4 (Linux-only) or fat32 works both ways, but has a 4 GiB file size limitation. \n\nA: I edited the /etc/usbmount/usbmount.conf on Ubuntu 15.10 server, removed the  \"sync\" word from this line:\nMOUNTOPTIONS=\"sync,noexec,nodev,noatime,nodiratime\"\n\nas mentioned before by Rodrigo Martins (big thx!).\nIt increased the write speed for a 480 mbps connected HDD from 2 Mbytes/sec to a constant 20 Mbytes/sec, ant it's constant and real, not \"cached\", not virtual speed. This drive writes about 30 Mbytes/sec on a Windows machine.\n\nA: I don't know if this will help anyone else but it's what worked for me when I had problems with really slow transfer speeds using Ubuntu 13.04 (speeds of 1mb/s or less). Anyway I restarted my computer with my USB hdd plugged into the USB port right before Ubuntu started up it ran some script on the black screen just before it loads and after that my transfer speeds have been really good on the low end 24mb/s.  \n", "Q: Issues with Lenovo C440 New Lenovo C440, initialised m/s to check machine and validate warranty. otherwise nought on it, apart from usual buy this, use this garbage that came pre-installed.\nBurned new disc (12.04.2 64AMD) from Ubuntu site and it ran checksum to validate, happy loaded  disc into new machine, wouldn't boot from BIOS like my old Lenovo N200 laptop.

Yet :)\nThis is mostly due to the complexity of different manufacturers deploying different methods to utilise U/EFI specification and because of this there is similar but different terminology being applied which is adding a lot of confusion. The lack of appropriate information from manufacturers (some but not all) regarding the use of features on their hardware falls well short of acceptable customer service.  \n\nA: Disable UEFI. The manual for the C440 suggest you can set the \"boot mode\" from \"UEFI\" to \"Legacy support\".\nThat should let you do a traditional boot-to-CD and that should then let you scrub W8 completely and install Ubuntu on the disk proper.\n", "Q: After Xorg update I have a black screen I have Ubuntu 12.10, my video card is Amd HD Radeon 7670M, and i have installed it's driver.

I had AMD Catalyst 13.1 installed. In addition, I followed instructions at BinaryDriverHowto/ATI when installing.\nI booted normally (not recovery) with the nomodeset kernel option (see the \"Black/purple screen after you boot Ubuntu for the first time\" section of the top answer to \"My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?\" on how to do this) and was dropped straight into tty1. \nThere, I uninstalled fglrx by running the following commands:\nsudo sh /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh \nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev* \nsudo reboot\n\nThis should force your notebook to use the open source RadeonDriver, and solve the issue.\nAs a side note, my computer rebooted fine, and I immediately re-downloaded and re-installed (same procedure) the same driver (performance was excellent with 13.1). So far no issues yet.\n\nA: This sounds like a problem with the AMD fglrx driver. Enter recovery mode. (Select booting it at the grub prompt.) Then enter the X fallback mode. Now you should be able to remove fglrx to get your graphical environment back. \nTo get proprietary drivers working again, try installing different versions of the fglrx driver or downloading the appropriate driver from AMD's website.\n", "Q: How can I restrict users fom changing network settings and adding new connection using network manager?

How do I make the live-usb save the settings?\n\nA: By default, Ubuntu live-USB doesn’t keep  settings, and data after system restart, since its read-only.  In order to have settings and data saved you need to create a persistence \nUSB drive.  \nTo do that click Here or Here\n\nA: With a typical persistent install changes are stored in a file named casper-rw.\nMaximum size of this file is 4GB due to the limits of the FAT file system.\nYou can also have persistent ext2, 3 or 4, partitions named casper-rw and home-rw, of any size that will fit the drive.\nCasper-rw stores your downloaded programs and home-rw stores your settings, email and downloads, etc, (but is optional).\nOnce the casper-rw file or partition exists, the session can be made persistent by pressing F6 on boot and then typing persistent.\nThis can be automated by editing syslinux.cfg or text.cfg and adding the word persistent.\nI prefer to overwrite the contents of syslinux.cfg with the following:\ndefault persistent\nlabel persistent\n  say Booting an Ubuntu Persistent session...\n  kernel /casper/vmlinuz\n  append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper persistent initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash noprompt --\n\nThis has the advantage of removing the Try/Install screens and reduces boot time by 30%.\n", "Q: How to install Tv-maxe I am having problems install TV-MAXE on one laptop the issue is that is asking for ubuntu 12.04 lts cd to be in /cdrom/.\nApparently the issue are the files lirc and setserial that will not install,tried with command line,synaptic and software center,mounted ubuntu iso on /media,/cdrom,/home(default of furius iso),mounted live usb and still it will not install the files.\nI have the ppa installed for tv-maxe and internet connection.\nAny workarounds?\n\nA: You can install TV-MAXE on Ubuntu using the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:venerix/pkg\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tv-maxe\n\n", "Q: Bash script indenting command line Hi I have used the following script, which after it has run and exited, causes my command line to display no text when typing, and after each carriage return instead of starting a new line like\nroot@alix:~# \n\nroot@alix:~# \n\nI get\nroot@alix:~# root@alix:~# root@alix:~# root@alix:~#  etc\n\nWhen using ctrl c I get\nroot@alix:~# \n            root@alix:~# \n                        root@alix:~#  etc\n\nHere is the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n###\n### Run command for given number of seconds then kill it\n###\n\nread -p \"How long should I run for? ==> \" count_secs\necho \"Time specified: \" $count_secs\n\nif [ $count_secs -gt 0 ]\nthen\n   ###\n   ### number of seconds greater than zero\n   ###\n\n   watch -n 0.5 'iw dev wlan0 station dump | grep \"signal avg\" >> processmonitor.log' >>/dev/null & \n\n   ###\n   ### assume that the PID of the command is $$\n   ###\n   my_PID=$!\n   sleep $count_secs\n   kill -15 $my_PID\nfi\n\nThanks.\n\nA: You can use the following code without the need to kill any process, after the end of the specified time (secs) it will exit.\n#!/bin/bash\n###\n### Run command for given number of seconds then kill it\n###\nread -p \"How long should I run for? ==> \" count_secs\necho \"Time specified: \" $count_secs\n# $SECONDS is a shell variable\n# we can use it in conjuction with\n# our user input \nwhile [ \"$SECONDS\" -le \"$count_secs\" ]\ndo\n  # execute any commands here (put your code bellow and remove echo commands)\n  echo `date +%r`\n  echo \"i am doing my work now\"\n  # sleep (in secs) before the next execution\n  sleep 1\ndone\n# when the count_secs elapses exit\nexit 0\n\n", "Q: Occasional latency spike between two servers 4 servers on a private network which all talk to each other using dedicated 1gbps network adapters.

We aren't transferring huge amounts of data between them, but it is a steady stream.\nThanks\n\nA: There are several external reasons a spike could happen. Since you are talking about 1 Gbps I will guess you are using a STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) Cable, maybe Cat 5e:\n\n\n*\n\n*Water or water source near cable\n\n*Close to power cables (Electric cables or electric wire in the building)\n\n*Cable close to what I call noise makers, which are any device that creates electric magnetic fields (Like the cable going around a CRT monitor, Fluorescent lights or a motor for a printer for example)\n\n*The RJ45 (8C8P) connector was incorrectly made\n\n*The cable was stepped on, twisted beyond the 90 degree angle or near a heat source.\n\n*Cable is not STP but instead UTP (Not grounded)\n\n*Computer connected to the LAN is not grounded correctly (Hug the computer with love, if you feel a electric spike almost killing you then it is not grounded). This is known as static discharge. It can also happen by touching the cable which would be an insulation problem with the cable.\n\n*Connecting Devices (Router, Switch) took a bit more to process a request.\n\n\nAnd even with all of that, the trouble could be in the activities done in the network (Apps or processes that are running on the computers) or simple packages that are sent at the same time to the same destination, creating small lag while they get returned.\nFor what you mention after 100 ping requests I would actually say you have a very good connection. Doing that to google.com or even to a computer exactly 2 meters aways gives me worse results. I just did it with another computer right now and got 8 packets that took 1400 ms.

I had the exact same problems as you when I started, and wracked my brains trying to solve it with very little response from the forums. \nSeveral months later I am hanging in there, and managed to solve the problems well enough, but I still lack the ability to do fairly normal things on more common operating systems: play HD videos, scroll quickly down a document/webpage with tearing ect... If you are still looking for help, I might be able to get you as far as I have come (much better). \nI have to say, having done it alone, I would go as far as to recommend selling that 5800 series GPU while there is a strong market for it, and buying something else. I am using the Ubuntu provided fglrx repository, and I about to test the xvba-video package.

This related question has more details, but the basics of it are that you want to set the uid and gid values to your user and group.

I am using the USB sound card sweex SC016. \n\nA: 1. Two active soundcards\nThere are two active sound cards in a computer: one on the motherboard and a separate PCI sound card. Or a built-in old-fashioned phone modem: that has it's own sound chip, for making calling sounds.\nIn certain rare cases, Ubuntu has a problem with the presence of multiple active sound cards. Then it's therefore best, to have only one active sound card.\nSolution: disable the on-board card in the BIOS. After you reboot your computer, the sound will come entirely through the PCI card.\nIf you can't find the disabling option of the on-board sound card in the BIOS, search the Internet for the manual for your motherboard.\n2. The volume may not be right or too few sound channels are opened.\nA. Install pavucontrol by means of Ubuntu Software Center.\nB. Now start pavucontrol.

I tried to follow several guides like this one, but these seem specifically written for USB devices. If I follow their steps and type udevadm info -a -p $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/sd2) (sd2 is my Windows partition), I get, for instance, no BUS-value and no SYSFS{product}-value either, although both seem to be necessary for writing rules.\nMaybe newer Ubuntu versions even have a far more easier way to accomplish this task? Many thanks in advance for your help!\n\nA: All you need to do is modify your /etc/fstab file giving the windows partition a fixed mount point.\nThis is an example: /dev/sda2  /media/Windows  ntfs    uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=027,fmask=137   0   0\nPractically, this line says mount the /dev/sda2 partition to /media/Windows and sets partition permissions.\nEvery time you turn your computer on the Windows partition will automount on /media/Windows.\n\nA: Go to System --> Administration --> Disk Utility and change the file name.\nOr use gparted from the ubuntu software centre and right click on the partition drive you want to rename and click label.Now,enter your desirable name.\n", "Q: Does Gwibber/UOA auto-follow people on twitter without my permission?

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit on a Pacard Bell dot S netbook with intel atom 64 bit processor.\nI get then following message when using either apt-get update or upgrade. Upgrade stops on this but update carries out the updates then reports the error\nW: Duplicate sources.list entry http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/ precise/partner amd64 Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.canonical.com_ubuntu_dists_precise_partner_binary-amd64_Packages)\n\nW: Duplicate sources.list entry http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/ precise/partner i386 Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.canonical.com_ubuntu_dists_precise_partner_binary-i386_Packages)\n\nW: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems\n\nIf I remove the files when I run upgrade or update they recur.\n\nA: Basically, this means that in your /etc/apt/sources.list, you have the same repository listed twice.\nThis isn't exactly an error, it's a warning, and it is pretty harmless one too.\nHowever, if you wish to stop these warnings appearing, read below, understand, then decide what you feel is best. If you don't feel comfortable with either, then don't do this. The messages you get are a warning, and isn't even remotely harmful to your OS.\nFirst things first: Back up your /etc/apt/sources.list file in case you make a mistake. Open up a terminal, and run:\nsudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup_warning\n\n(I tend to add descriptive titles to my backups instead of numbering them in case I need to go back to them later)\nNow you have two ways to fix this\nThe simple way: Open up the Ubuntu Software Centre. On the Menu bar, click on Edit and go all the way down to Software Sources. \nClick on the Other Sources tab and maximise the window to prevent removing the wrong repository. Go through the list until you find the repositories listed above and then untick. Then press close and allow the Ubuntu Software Centre to refresh packages. \nIf you have done this right, you should have no more warnings.\nThe mildly complicated way: Open up the terminal. Type\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nand then find those URLS listed above and place a hash ('#') symbol before the lines. Again, if you have done this right, you should have no more warnings.\nPersonally, I'd recommend you go down the simple way, as there is less chance of shooting yourself in the foot and damaging your repository updating mechanism. Or failing that, don't make a single change. Your system is absolutely fine the way it is.\n\nA: You currently have both the 32bit and 64bit repositories listed in your sources list you could edit this through the terminal with the following command and then in your case remove the 32bit repository \"i386\".\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nOr the graphical way to do this would be to open up your \"Ubuntu Software Centre\" then from the top menu select Edit/Software Sources...\n\nThen select the Other Software tab from the top and scroll down until you find the repository you wish to remove click it once to select it and then click Remove from the bottom menu and that’s it.\n\n", "Q: Enable random desktop wallpaper change with elapsed time Is there a way to randomise the Ubuntu desktop wallpaper with time for each displayed wallpaper?\nThis will randomly select a wallpaper from the Pictures folder and display it for the specified time allocated to it in a slideshow.\n\nA: I have wanted to do the same thing at times.\nThere were a few options out there, one of the better ones that I remember is Wallch.\nYou get some control over the interval and you get to add all the individual images you wish to use.\nWallch Website\n", "Q: How do I calculate the size of folders which contains some unreadable contents?

Following the hard reboot the system comes up and mounts most of the raid partitions, but one large critical one (containing /home) is throwing input/output errors.  \nbpbrown@eguzki:/$ ls home\nls: cannot access home: Input/output error\nbpbrown@eguzki:/$ \n\nWe're in Ubuntu 12.04, and owing to the loss of /home, we're at command line only.\nOn reboot, mdadm showed that the array was resyncing; that seems to have completed but still no luck in accessing /home.\nHere are the results of mdadm:\nbpbrown@eguzki:/$ sudo mdadm -D /dev/md10\n/dev/md10:\n    Version : 0.90\n  Creation Time : Thu Feb  4 16:49:43 2010\n   Raid Level : raid5\n Array Size : 2868879360 (2735.98 GiB 2937.73 GB)\nUsed Dev Size : 956293120 (911.99 GiB 979.24 GB)\nRaid Devices : 4\n Total Devices : 4\nPreferred Minor : 10\nPersistence : Superblock is persistent\n\nUpdate Time : Fri Apr 19 10:03:46 2013\n      State : clean  \n Active Devices : 4 \nWorking Devices : 4\n Failed Devices : 0\n  Spare Devices : 0\n\n     Layout : left-symmetric\n Chunk Size : 64K\n\n       UUID : 317df11d:4e2edc70:fa3efedc:498284d3\n     Events : 0.2121101\n\nNumber   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\n   0       8       10        0      active sync   /dev/sda10\n   1       8       26        1      active sync   /dev/sdb10\n   2       8       42        2      active sync   /dev/sdc10\n   3       8       58        3      active sync   /dev/sdd10\nbpbrown@eguzki:/$ \n\nand here's mdstat:\nbpbrown@eguzki:/$ cat /proc/mdstat \nPersonalities : [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [linear] [multipath] [raid0] [raid10] \nmd1 : active raid1 sda1[0] sdb1[1] sdc1[2] sdd1[3]\n      497856 blocks [4/4] [UUUU]\n\nmd8 : active raid5 sda8[0] sdb8[1] sdc8[2] sdd8[3]\n      5301120 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [4/4] [UUUU]\n\nmd6 : active raid5 sda6[0] sdb6[1] sdc6[2] sdd6[3]\n      20530752 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [4/4] [UUUU]\n\nmd7 : active raid5 sda7[0] sdc7[2] sdd7[3] sdb7[1]\n      5301120 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [4/4] [UUUU]\n\nmd5 : active raid5 sda5[0] sdd5[3] sdc5[2] sdb5[1]\n      5301120 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [4/4] [UUUU]\n\nmd10 : active raid5 sda10[0] sdc10[2] sdd10[3] sdb10[1]\n      2868879360 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [4/4] [UUUU]\n\nunused devices: <none>\nbpbrown@eguzki:/$ \n\nUnmounting and remounting /dev/md10 doesn't seem to help, though I may well have missed a step in correctly mounting the raid array.\nIf helpful, here's the contents of /etc/fstab:\nbpbrown@eguzki:/$ more /etc/fstab\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\nproc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0\n/dev/md5    /               reiserfs relatime        0       1\n/dev/md1    /boot           reiserfs notail,relatime 0       2\n/dev/md10   /home           xfs      relatime        0       2\n/dev/md8    /tmp            reiserfs relatime        0       2\n/dev/md6    /usr            reiserfs relatime        0       2\n/dev/md7    /var            reiserfs relatime        0       2\n/dev/sda9   none            swap    pri=1           0       0\n/dev/sdb9   none            swap    pri=1           0       0\n/dev/sdc9   none            swap    pri=1           0       0\n/dev/sdd9   none            swap    pri=1           0       0\n/dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0\nbpbrown@eguzki:/$ \n\nUpdate April 23:\nTried mounting the filesystem directly again and got a possibly useful error message.

Typically, with r202 versions, I get blanks instead of Streetview images & YouTube videos. Chromium seems to use whatever flash player I install in FF and its behavior follows FF.\nRecently, I started to get awful red warnings about r102 being \"vulnerable\" (which I believe, of course) & it is disabled & I have to activate it manually every time I want to use it on the above sites.\nSo in the last few days, I have tried r202 versions again, but they still don't work.\nI am currently using Lubuntu 12.10 with FF20.0, but I have the same behavior with the same versions of flashplayer in Ubuntu 10.04.\nCan I expect any versions to work \"normally\" in Ubuntu?\n\nA: I have just downloaded the latest tar.gz file for 64bit linux from adobe.com (version 11.2.202.280). It seems to me that firefox takes the file from /usr/share/ubufox/plugins/, where libflashplayer.so is a symlink to /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so.\nSo I have unpacked the package, and copied libflashplayer.so to /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/. After restarting firefox, the flash plugin works, it no longer complains.\nI use Ubuntu 12.04, and I have flashplugin64-installer installed, but I think it does not matter as long as you can find the location of the old plugin.\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: Getting Star Wars - Rogue Squadron working on linux I've tried using mupen64plus and project64 2.0 under wine, but both have failed to run correctly.  The video is completely blank, although the audio seems to run fine.  Even when I fullscreen the project64 window, it still remains blank, only changing colour from black to white.\nI've tried various video plugins, including arachnoid, z64, rice, glide64, etc.\nRice comes the closest, by showing small parts of the screen, with the rest being totally blank.\nGlide64 outputs an error message:\nVideo: ucode = -1\nVideo Error: Error: Unsupported uCode!\ncrc: 86b1593e\n\nI've also tried the different available varieties of the game, the USA and European versions, but to no avail.\nNot sure where to go from there.\nEdit: I'm using nvidia proprietary drivers and have had no problem running other games in both mupen64plus and project64 2.0.\n\nA: Do your current drivers support 3D acceleration? If you're running other games in Wine, then the answer is likely yes. If you aren't, or you don't know or otherwise want a sanity check, open terminal and run glxgears. For modern graphics cards, the gears demo should run, and the output should show an FPS well over 1000.\nIf your current drivers don't support 3D acceleration, you'll need to install ones that do. This will depend on your card, but generally, the easiest way is to install the proprietary drivers. You can find them in the \"Drivers\" tab of the \"Additional Software Sources\" app.\nHave you tried PlayOnLinux? PlayOnLinux is a wrapper for Wine that's available in the respositories. It can aid in getting games to work by installing specific versions of Wine (they don't overwrite one another) that are known to work best for the application in question. Often, this is one of the easiest ways to get a game working.\n\nA: Good news! Wine has recently gained the ability to play the Microsoft Windows version which is almost identical to the N64 version. I tested it with Wine 4.12.1 and a downloadable version of Rogue Squadron 3D I purchased from GOG.com. It worked well with two hitches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the d3d11 library using an override in winecfg. Wine will use d3d9 instead, which has much smoother animation (higher FPS). \n\n*The standard camera starts lagging behind the player's ship and does not catch up properly. The fix is to hit \"F1\" so you have the \"Close View\" instead. (From the reviews, this bug is a problem for Microsoft Windows as well.)\n\n", "Q: How do I enable cookies in Opera? In order to access some privileges as far as accessing journal articles and other resources that my university allows me I need cookies enabled. I have tried what I can to enable them like going to the Opera -> Settings -> Quick Preferences -> Enable Cookies (and clicking this) but this doesn't seem to do a thing. \n\nA: Opera has several settings concerning cookies. The quick preferences are what you can commonly also access via F12 when on a website. The quick preferences are there to toggle particular settings quickly and conveniently without having to go into some configuration dialog.\nHowever, if your global Opera settings regarding cookies are set too restrictive, this would likely be where to look first. The three settings I marked in the following screenshot are the most important:\n\nInvoke the preferences dialog with Ctrl+F12 and then go to the \"Advanced\" tab and navigate to the \"Cookies\" settings from there.\nFailing that, there is another place you can look for too restrictive cookie settings. That's when you press F12 again on the website and then choose the (by default) item at the bottom \"Edit Site Preferences\". This has a \"Cookies\" tab with similar settings are the global ones shown in the global settings:\n\nFailing all of the above, which is what you will need if you have no extensions or user scripts installed, I would review my user scripts and extensions, turn them off one by one and then check whether the web site works.\n\nIf you still have no luck, try to tell Opera to pose as one of the other browsers. Some web sites are particular to browsers and make (wrong!) assumptions based on their own browser detection code. You can change that in the site preferences again (\"Network\" tab):\n\n", "Q: How to check if my graphic card is muxless? How can I check whether my Graphic Card is \"muxed\" or \"muxless\"?\nMy graphic card is an AMD HD 8730M, and on my Dell Inspiron 15r 5521 I've also got an Intel HD 4000.\nBut when I use the lspci command I only get this output for VGA:\n\nVGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller\nVGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Device 6601\n\nAnd nothing else.\nMy Dell laptop is overheating and I want to solve the problem. I already installed and configured the i8kmon utility, but that's not the way to solve the overheating problem at its root.\nSo I need to check if my AMD HD 8730M card is muxless, otherwise I won't know if I can follow this guide: AMD/Intel Hybrid Graphics works\n\nA: Mux stands for Multiplex and I believe it wants to know if you have a hardware multiplexer (Not sure about this).  \nThere is a lot of useful information in the archwiki which might be of help.  \n\nA: For me I checked in the BIOS under Video. If there is an option to disable \"Switchable Graphics\" then your laptop is not muxless (meaning you have a multiplexer which allows you to only use the nvidia card if desired). That option was missing on a separate dell laptop (meaning it was a muxless laptop) that I struggled to get nvidia loaded and working properly. Complete pain when you can only use official repos.\nI know this is a very old question but figured it needed an answer that explained how to check and this was the only way I could figure that out.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Gnome 3 and Windwos FAIL BOOT I have a strange issue: \nI wanted to install Ubuntu 12.10 Gnome edition on a usb and every time I wanted to use this Ubuntu to plug my usb into my laptop and boot the usb enjoy the cool OS. I made a usb with the distro and 10gb of perserve space. Plug, boot, on the install screen format and install. Gnome started everything is OK. \nAfter that I wanted to log on my main OS that is Win7. Shutdown the whole laptop. Unplug the usb and start the computer. But it booted automatically (without asking me and I dont know how when the usb is not connected) Ubuntu Gnome3... \nI'm starting to think that I made the huge mistake to format my whole harddrive and not to use the usb as a portable OS :X \nI'm very new to this community and to Ubuntu/Linux = noob, so I will appriciate friendly comments and not too much Linux jargon(terminologie).\nFirst thing is how can I see my whole hard disk and all installed OS?\nSecond is there a way to revert the process :D ?\nThird... I think that whatever happens I will try this (the portable ubuntu OS) one more time so maybe I need a complete/newb guide for someone like me.\nFourth.. I dont know yet but I'm sure that there are more questions that are waiting to be invoked. :D\nThanks!\n\nA: I unfortunately do not have good news. You put the live image of Ubuntu Gnome on your USB key. If you just wanted to use it from the USB your best option would have been to 'Try out Ubuntu Gnome'. However by choosing to Format and install, you did not format your USB key but your entire computer. As the warning indicated, that means you wiped out everything off of your computer completely.\nFor your questions:\n1) Open up the Files program to see everything on your computer (looks like a little filing cabinet). \n2) No, you have wiped your hard-drive and put the Ubuntu Gnome operating system on it instead.\n3) No need to try the portable version at this point, it's installed completely on your computer, might as well enjoy it :)\n4) One option that may be available is to re-install your Windows 7 and then use a live image on a USB key or to create a 'dual boot' system in which you are given a choice of Windows or Ubuntu at start-up.

People have got ubuntu to run on lots of hardware including the nexus tablets, washing machines and toasters (ok, I made up the last two examples). So an AMD6 processor is quite likely to be possible as you can see here.`\nIf you need specific advice you need to give the model of the motherboard and all the peripherals you are interested in. If you buy standard hardware as you do from the sounds of it there won't be any problems.\n\nEDIT after you supplied details of your hardware.\nThe memory doesn't matter since if it works for one OS on your hardware it will likely work for others. Almost the same is true for your processor. I had a quick look at the user comments on NewEgg for your board. There seems to be nothing remarkable, some claim it's fine.

That and more, useful information can be found on the man page:\nman sudoers\nOn standard installs, membership of group admin will get you admin access. You can find out your group membership on the commandline by issuing id (or using a GUI 'user management' to see what groups you belong to).\n\n\n*\n\n*Since you are talking about the 'incessant prompts', I would suggest to get used to them. Attempts to disable them is typically not a good idea. You can lengthen the time you will be allowed to use sudo for. I suggest to only use sudo form one terminal and not from several (since you would have to type in your password in all of those terminals).\n\n*If you are undertaking some more involved administration requiring you to be root for many things, I suggest you switch users:\nsudo su -\nThis will make you root in that session.

I can't figure out how to access my other hard drives while in Ubuntu.\nAlso, is there anyway to make it so that if I don't have my external plugged in it boots straight into windows 7 but if I plug it in it gives me a boot option to go between both without having to click f11 to go into boot menu? \nThanks for the help! :)\n\nA: As an answer to your first question, you should be able to access your internal hard drives by mounting them in nautilus. You can do this by opening up 'files', then clicking on the partitions on the left panel.\nFor your second question, there is no way to do this as far as I know. This is by design of the boot system, as if you install GRUB onto your hard disk it will either always expect Ubuntu to be plugged in, or it will always boot straight to Windows. There is unfortunately no way to give an option besides going into the BIOS boot menu by using f11.\n\nA: BUT if the other OS partition is a internal disk (different disk or partition)\nYou can get grub to add it to the boot menu!\nHere are my notes..\n# Is a different OS visible?\n  os-prober\n  linux-boot-prober /dev/sda2\n# Add to grub boot menu on current OS /boot partition\n  grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n  grub2-install /dev/sda\n# Setup grub boot on other root partition (mounted)\n  grub2-mkconfig -o /mnt/alt/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n  # grub2-install --root-directory=/mnt/alt /dev/sda\n# List entrys and there menu number\n  sed -e '/^menuentry/!d' -e \"s/[^']('[^']').*/\\1/\" \\\n         /boot/grub2/grub.cfg | cat -n\n# reboot to new OS (menu 5 from above) (once only)\n  grub2-reboot 5     # <-- simple    vs  ,--verbose\n  grub2-reboot 'Fedora release 24 (Twenty Four) (on /dev/sda2)'\n  grub2-editenv list\n  reboot\nPS: you can even install a newer OS on the other partition without booting disk or usb.

Therefore i use the command \"w\" in terminal. However the Idle time for tty seems strange (note I don't know much about linux or what tty means). \nFor example, a test of \"w\" command on my work machine shows that the idle time of my session is 14days? But i am using it now... this is something I don't understand.\nw\nUSER  TTY   FROM  LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT\nme    tty7  :0    09Apr13 14days  1:41m  3.07s gnome-session --session=ubuntu\n\n\nA: The idle time is supposed to tell how long it has been since the user typed any input on that terminal.  For Xwindows sessions, it is broken since Xwindows never reads input from a terminal, but instead gathers input directly from your mouse and keyboard, so the terminal never gets its timestamp updated since it is never read from.\n\nA: There are at least 2 helpful hints in your \"w\" output which indicate that the entry you quote is referring to you logged in directly to the display which is physically connected to your Linux machine at home.\nFirst, under the \"TTY\" column, you have \"tty7\".  On a Linux machine, \"gdm\" or \"gnome\" or X-Windows in general will be running on tty7.  When you are physically located at home, touching the keyboard physically connected to your machine, and you cycle through ctrl-alt-f1 up through ctrl-alt-f7, you are correspondingly cycling through tty1 through tty7, and when you get to tty7, you'll see X-Windows/gnome running.\nSecond, under the \"FROM\" column, you have \":0\".  When you see that, that always indicates the X-Windows running on the display which is physically connected to the machine.\nThe third clue is \"gnome-session\" under \"WHAT\", which in all probability would not be running on any display other than the one physically connected to your home machine.\nSo, 14 days ago you sat down at your machine at home and started an X-Windows/gnome session, and that's what you're seeing in the \"w\" output.\nWe also can deduce that you did not list the full output of \"w\", because you did not include the line of output which indicates that you're logged in to your home machine from work, which might list, for example, a \"TTY\" of \"pts/0\", a \"FROM\" of the IP address or name of your work machine, and \"-bash\" or \"-tcsh\" or some shell under \"WHAT\".\n\nA: Idle time is telling you from how long is running a process, in your case gnome-session --session=ubuntu is running from 14 days (your computer is open from 14 days).\n", "Q: How to install drivers for AMD Radeon HD 7850?

The exceptions I noticed are:\n\n\n*\n\n*No touch\n\n*The provided wireless keyboard (or mouse) did not work probably since this is the Logitech Unifying driver, not some generic bluetooth type.\n\n*Issues with Enter key on generic USB keyboard - wasn't activating the Dash contents.\n\n\nI didn't try a USB mouse, since I ran out of USB ports.

It means to open a filesystem and attach it somewhere in the filesystem namespace.  It sounds like you want to dd the image to the new disk.  Assuming the new disk is /dev/sdb, then that would just be dd if=foo.img of=/dev/sdb.  If the new drive is larger than the old one then you will want to fire up gparted and expand the partitions to use the new space.\n", "Q: Purple screen after installing to external hard drive I have Windows 7 64 on my laptop (MSI GX660).

Original information from this blog: http://jechem.blogspot.be/2011/04/fix-plymouth-splash-screen-in-ubuntu-on.html\nFirst install hwinfo by running the following command:\nsudo apt-get install v86d hwinfo\n\nAfter the installation run the following command and note down the highest resolution:\nsudo hwinfo --framebuffer\n\nFor me this was Mode 0x0361: 1280x800 (+5120), 24 bits, next edit the following file:\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nThis will open the GRUB config file, we now look for GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" and change it with the following, change your resolution with mine and also add the color depth (for me 24 could be 16 or 32).\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset video=uvesafb:mode_option=1280x800-24,mtrr=3,scroll=ywrap\"\n\nThen find the following line (uncomment if needed) and change your resolution again, note that you don't include the color depth:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1280x800\n\nSave and exit, next edit the following file:\ngksu gedit /etc/initramfs-tools/modules\n\nScroll to the end of the file and add the following line, again add your resolution and the colordepth like you did before:\nuvesafb mode_option=1280x800-24 mtrr=3 scroll=ywrap\n\nThen in the terminal type the following commands and then reboot:\necho FRAMEBUFFER=y | sudo tee /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash\nsudo update-grub\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nFor me this fixed the problem, I tried all the other suggestions and scripts, none of them worked but this does, good luck!\n", "Q: How to back up and trasnfer ubuntu data and application?

I've restarted 8 times and still don't see it.\n\nA: Did you select boot usb from the start up menu? Its under the F12 menu I do believe and then from the select boot sequence and make usb device first.\n\nA: some machines do not support boot from USB or External hard drives.  Your best option would be to create a live CD.  \nA live CD is the exact same as a bootable USB the only difference being a Live CD will work on any machine with a CD drive.  \nif you are currently using windows then your best option would be to download the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ISO image and then download a ISO burner (there are plenty available for free try ISOBurner) once you have that downloaded burn the iso onto a blank DVDrw.\nOnce you have your live cd go into your BIOS settings, set your CD/DVD drive to the first boot slot and save options and exit (make sure you have the DVD in the drive at this time).\nYour machine will now reboot and will start the Ubuntu live CD\nhope this helps\n", "Q: How can I invoke the soft-keyboard widget on Ubuntu-touch?

I configured a different (correct) proxy and everything worked fine (for wget you can configure this either globally in /etc/wgetrc or individually in ~/.wgetrc with http_proxy = http://proxyhost:port/).\nThe issue had nothing to do with Ubuntu or wget.\n\nA: You seem to have a proxy configured, which wget is attempting to connect through, but which is not available, and so the web server running on that address, is returning an HTTP 503 error response. You should contact the admin of that site, or disable the use of a proxy.\n\nA: If the remote site doesn't accept proxies, you can use wget with --no-proxy in order to skip going through proxy.\nFor example you are wgetting some remote file, the syntax would be:\nwget --no-proxy <path of remote file>\n\n", "Q: Chromium-Browser starts with unmaximized window Chromium browser by default start with an unmaximized window in my Ubuntu system and I've to manually do maximize.\nHow can I open chromium browser maximized by default?\nAlso, I've locked the launcher to the side panel.\n\nA: I think you need to modify your .desktop file for Chromium, wherever it is located. It could be in ~/.local/share/applications or in /usr/share/applications. The former location is better from the point of view of ease of editing because no sudo is needed, and the .desktop file here isn't over-written with each update.\nI use Chrome and not Chromium so you need to find the appropriately named .desktop file for Chromium in either of the two locations I mentioned.\nTo edit the .desktop file when you find it, don't double-click on it. Instead, right-click and choose the editor you prefer. As I mentioned, you may need to use sudo or gksudo depending on where your .desktop file is. (I prefer the terminal route for minor edits in which case I would use sudo nano google-chrome.desktop or just nano google-chrome.desktop, whichever is appropriate.)\nAnyway, look for the line that begins with Exec= and change the contents to look like this:\nExec=/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --start-maximized %U\n\nkeeping in mind the path that Chromium is installed in may differ and the actual name will be different, possibly chromium-browser.\n\nIn short, adding --start-maximized to the command should do the trick for this particular software.\n", "Q: managing XCP using xenopenmanager ubuntu server 12.10 64bit.\ni installed the xen server using the \"apt-get install xcp-xapi\"\ntrying to connect to host using openxenmanager but it keeps on giving me \"[Errno 11] connection refused\".\nping & ssh is working.\ndon't know what could be the problem\nbest regards\n\nA: I have the same problem.

This means you cannot install Ubuntu Studio 12.04 or 12.10 with Wubi. There are some workarounds to do this (not recommended). If you use the 13.04 Wubi then you'll be installing a development release that is in beta and not recommended for normal users. It's also not totally clear when or if Wubi 13.04 will be released.\nSo in order to install Ubuntu Studio you would need to install as a normal dual boot. You would do this by booting from your Ubuntu Studio DVD and select to install it. You can create some free space beforehand by splitting or deleting an existing partition, or see whether the installer can do this for you satisfactorily.\nYou could also update your existing Ubuntu install to Ubuntu Studio.\nNote: if you reinstall with Wubi, it will delete and completely remove any old Wubi install. If you install a normal dual boot, it won't see the Wubi install or interfere with it, but you'll only be able to boot the Wubi install from Windows' boot manager (unless you manually create Grub entries for it).\n", "Q: No dual boot option, no boot priority order I installed Ubuntu yesterday. I partitioned my C: when it was asked to give memory allocation to Ubuntu. The version is 12.04. I was able to install Ubuntu completely:\n\nUbuntu is successfully installed. Restart you computer.\n\nI restarted and there was no Ubuntu option. Windows 7 also asked for a boot repair. So I did that too. I then wanted to change my boot priority order to Ubuntu but couldn't find it in BIOS section.\nI allotted 20GB to Ubuntu and it is deducted from C: but I couldn't see the partitioned drive in Windows 7. Wubi was working fine before on PC with dual boot option.\nI used Linux Live key creator to boot my PC through pen drive.\n\nA: It sounds like you didn't install Grub to the correct location. You can do this by booting the USB again and do it manually, or run a tool like boot-repair if you're not sure you want to mess with Grub.\nManual method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from your Ubuntu USB\n\n*Select \"Try Ubuntu\"\n\n*Identify the partition you installed Ubuntu on, mount it and install Grub to the drive MBR:\n\n\ne.g. \nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo fdisk -l | grep '[\\t ]83[\\t ]' | awk '{print $1}'\n/dev/sda5\nubuntu@ubuntu$ sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\nubuntu@ubuntu$ sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sda\n\nNotes: the first command identifies any linux partition (MBR disk only), but only works with a single all-in-one partition (which you apparently have). The argument for fdisk is lower case -L. In my example I've set the linux partition to /dev/sda5. If this is different for you, make sure you adjust the next line.\nPS even though you tagged your question as Wubi, I am ignoring that as it seems irrelevant. If you actually installed inside Windows with Wubi, then your question is unclear and should be edited. In this, case ignore my answer.\n", "Q: Minecraft server in ubuntu 12.10 I've been living in a hotel do to a house fire.\nI have just tried to setup a server for some of my friends to connect and it doens't seem to work.\nI port forwarded the port 27015 and set that in the server.properties file.\nI also set my ip(192.168.2.104) in that same file.\nEverything should checkout ok but it doens't, I go to a site like http://www.canyouseeme.org and it says \"Error: I could not see your service on 66.192.111.230 on port (27015)\"\nYes my server is running.\nCan you help me?\nPC Specs:\nIntel Core I5 3470 Quad 3.2Ghz\n4GBs DDR3 RAM\nATI Radeon HD 5450 1GB DDR3\n\nA: Since it's just for some friends, try using Hamachi.

However I think the following link shall help you already-answered-here. Good luck\n\nA: This answer comes from Getting started Ubuntu 12.04.\nUse the Ubuntu live cd or live usb, and do the following things.\n$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nTis output means that your system (Linux, on whi Ubuntu is based)\nis installed on device /dev/sda, but your computer is booting to /dev/sda\n(where Windows is located). We need to rectify this by telling the computer\nto boot to the Linux device instead.\nTo do this, first create a place to manipulate your Ubuntu installation:\n$ sudo mkdir /media/root\n\nNext, link your Ubuntu installation and this new folder:\n$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/root\n\nIf you’ve done this correctly, then you should see the following:\n$ ls /media/root\nbin dev home lib mnt root srv usr\nboot etc initrd lib64 opt sbin sys var\ncdrom initrd.img media proc selinux tmp vmlinuz\n\nNow, you can reinstall Grub:\n$ sudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/root /dev/sda\nInstallation finished. No error reported.\nThis is the contents of the device map /boot/grub/device.map.\nCheck if this is correct or not. If any of the lines is incorrect,\nfix it and re-run the script grub-install.\n(hd0) /dev/sda\n\n\nA: /fixmbr normally rewrites the bootloader, so you should expect non-microsoft operating systems to disappear.\nYou may have installed Ubuntu in the wrong mode. First make sure if your current Windows 7 installation is installed in UEFI mode or the legacy BIOS mode? Then boot your Ubuntu live media in the correct mode.\nEasiest thing would be to reinstall Ubuntu. Or you could reinstall grub, but this require some slapping in the commandline.\n// chroot, then\ngrub-install --efi-directory=DIR /dev/sda\nThis guide should help reinstall your grub bootloader:\nhttp://www.reversiblean.com/install-windows-after-linux/\nAnd this will answer some of the most common issues when trying to dual boot Windows and Linux: http://www.reversiblean.com/fix-partition-table-issues-win-linux/\nNormally, if Ubuntu-Installer does not throw any warnings you should be fine.\n", "Q: How can I set CTRL+SHIFT+W to open an internet browser? Small question here. I try to set CTRL+SHIFT+W to open an internet browser. Every time I add it to the keyboard shortcuts in the settings, it takes back a level in the settings menu rather than accepting my new shortcut. Any ideas?\n\nA: Can not confirm what is using or has been assigned ctrl+shift+w to close tabs or windows but that is probably why the window closes when you try to assign that shortcut to launch browser.   \nAfter checking HUD and System Settings>All Settings>Keyboard there appears to be no thing assigned that keyboard shortcut.  Refering to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Keybindings gives information regarding using dconf Editor to view all keyboard shortcuts but again no thing is being shown that indicates ctrl+shift+w being assigned to any thing.\nSearching the web confirms some body has filed a bug at launchpad so it might be worth our while to add as affected here. \nLooking at this question may also indicate something has changed with regard how keyboard shortcuts work in newer flavours.\nIt would appear alt+F4 is the assigned shortcut to close windows. \nDepending on your keyboard you could assign the appropriate media key or hot key or Function Key to launch browser through All Settings>Keyboard>Launchers>Launch Web Browser which would give one button launch ability.\n\nMaybe Unity shortcut may be an option?\nOpen your browser and right click the icon in launcher to lock it to launcher.  \n\nPress and hold the Super(Windows icon) which will show HUD with information regarding keyboard shortcuts.  \n\nNote looking at Launcher your browser icon may have been assigned a number.\nI mostly use Firefox and pressing and holding Super tells me Firefox has been assigned the number 6. So pressing Super+6 will launch browser for me. \nIf pressing and holding Super does not show a shortcut number for your browser\n\nJust drag and drop the launcher icon to nearer the top of launcher for it to be assigned a number.\n\nA: This is because Ctrl + Shift + W shortcut will close all currently open tabs (Ctrl + W will close only the current tab). If you are in a browser (Chromium, Firefox) this shortcut will entail closing the window.\nTry to use another combination like Ctrl + Shift + B or Ctrl + Shift + C (these I tested) and will work like a charm.\n\nA: Here are some shortcut keys that are very common for all major browsers. Even you are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Opera users, these keyboard shortcuts will work for your browsers. \n\n\n*\n\n*Shift+Left Click – It is meant for Opening a link in the new browser window.\n\n*Ctrl+Shift+Left Click – It is meant for Opening the link in a foreground tab.\n\n*Middle Click a Tab – It is meant for Closing any the tab.\n\n*Ctrl+Left Click, Middle Click – It is meant for opening a link in the background tab.\n\n*Ctrl+Shift+T – It is meant for reopening the last closed tab.\n\n*Ctrl+T – Open a new Tab with this key.\n", "Q: How do I reduce the size of the menu bar?

I have upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04 a few days ago.\nLast night I went to a friend's house where we were 5 persons total.\nEveryone noticed that the internet was slow - except me. For me it was fast.\nSo we decided to to a little experiment.We started turning off the laptops to see which was causing the trouble. When I turned off mine, the connection speed was restored for the others! (no one of us was downloading/uploading/cloud synchronizing anything).\nTheir laptops had Windows, but one of them had Ubuntu 12.10 on a partition. So he booted into it, and still his connection was slow. When I disconnected from the LAN, it was ok.\nToday another friend came at my house (running windows) and we are having the same trouble. When I d/c from the LAN it's ok, when I am online his internet is slow. So that means that it wasn't a problem with my friend's router (last night).\nI am concluding the my pc is causing the trouble. I even downloaded avg for linux to search for viruses - it didn't find anything.\nAny ideas what might be the cause? A newly introduced bug?\nNote: I checked the monitor program and I wasn't downloading/uploading anything (~1Kbps download, ~0 upload)\n\nA: I was having the same problem and it was driving me nuts, so I installed a fresh copy of 12.04LTS and the same thing was happening. which was weird 'cause that's never happened to me before.

By mistake, I let for Windows too little space. Question is, how to uninstall Linux, join all partitions and then again divide HDD into few partitions of different size and install Linux WITHOUT uninstalling the Windows. \n\nA: This shouldn't be a problem but you can also resize partitions with Partition manager and in Windows 7 or Vista you can use Disk Management. There are also lots of other programs that will do this, you can use Ubuntu from the USB stick... \nIn partition manager you have first (right click on the parition) and Unmount neighboring partitions  and then resize  them with resize/Move button.\nYou don't have to reinstall anything to do that.\n", "Q: Stop GUI boot ubuntu ARM I am using an ARM version of Ubuntu (Lubuntu specifically) on a pcDuino. I want to use it as more of a server as opposed with a monitor. One of the first obvious things to do would be to disable lightdm/x starting on boot. I googled it and everyone is saying you just need to edit /etc/default/grub but grub is not used to boot the ARM version and is therefore not installed.\nAny help would be appreciated.\nThanks\n\nA: Okay, run levels for Ubuntu and flavors is handled by the Upstart system.  To bypass going straight to graphical mode, you'll need to change the run level as stipulated in the Upstart cookbook.  The Ubuntu default is graphical multi-user plus networking.\nTo switch to single user mode, you'll need to enter the command sudo nano /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf and enter the appropriate password to open the file for editing.  Once open, hit Control-W to search for env DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL and change what is on the other side of the equal sign to 1.

wont Ubuntu desktop shut down? I installed Ubuntu  12.04.2 LTS via USB drive--everything functioning okay--and downloaded 150+ updates. I used the shut down command, and the computer wouldn't turn off.\nThe computer is an Acer Aspire one netbook.  I needed to install  a driver for the Canon printer, and a CD/DVD  writing programme. I have tried the on/off switch, ESC, CTRL+ALT+DELETE.\n\nA: Open console with Ctrl+Alt+T, then type:\nshutdown -h now\n\nOne more alternative (less safe, but works too):\nsudo halt\n\nIf that doesn't work too, try to kill X server first, then shutdown after X restarts:\nsudo killall -9 Xorg\n\n\nA: Hit Control-Alt-F1, login, and then enter sudo shutdown -hP now which should shut your system down.\n\nA: Maybe there's another user signed in. Then Ubuntu wouldn't shut down.\n\nA: If you hit F8 on your splash screen logout, watch for the verbose logout, especially any line that says something related to 'plymouthd has been excluded from killing...\". If you see this, then the protected state of plymouthd is most-likely causing your harddrive to be prevented from re-mounting in read-only state for the logout.\nIf this is the case, this is a known-bug (albeit, apparently only Redhat will admit that, at this point), related to the logout splash screen being protected from being killed at logout. There are a lot of band-aids being offered to fix this issue, however none of them that I have found, have resolved the issue for HP or Dell laptops (efforts like taking ownership at root for plymouthd, etc.)\nHard-powering down by holding your power button can be detrimental to hardware (like harddrives), so I am not sure why this is not of higher importance to Ubuntu, when Redhat has already got a bug-ticket in on this Fedora-related issue.  Going to 'verbose logout' does not stop plymouthd from causing related logout problems, though.\n", "Q: How to format Ubuntu bootable USB? I am new in Ubuntu. First I installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my USB stick which is of 16 GB. So, it installed with 2 partitions of 9 GB and 7 GB. \nNow I want to format that USB.

But  I don't know why I am getting this error. Can anyone tell me the reason?\n\nA: With many applications, there are multiple ways to download/install them.  One way is through apt-get and another is by downloading and untaring the .tar file.  Note, that apt-get has nothing to do with the .tar file.\nUnable to locate package zopectl\n\nTypically, that error indicates the package you are trying to install cannot be found in any of your defined repositories.  Have you done a sudo apt-get update?  Run that command and then try again.  \nIf you cannot get the apt-get install to work, you should be able to install this application by untar-ing the .tar file (which you say you have already downloaded).  In terminal, change to your home directory (cd ~) and try this:\ntar -xvf nameOfTarFile.tar\n\nNote that if the file you downloaded is a tar.gz file, you'll need to set one more flag to get that to work:\ntar -zxvf nameOfTarFile.tar\n\n", "Q: How do I stop Ubuntu 12.10 heating up so much?

First of all, I must say that I have successfully used Disk Utility in the past and thus I could rename my partitions.\nBut yesterday, I saw that my partitions are not mounted, so I used Storage Device Manager to make them to automatically mount at start up. That was a success also but I saw that the partitions are labelled as sda1 and sda7 not as they were initially.

Then I read about Windows 8 installation and found out that it uses UEFI boot as there is a partition created by Windows that is EFI.\nThen I tried to install Ubuntu EFI although I got the very same situation. After that I did a last try making things manually by selecting the partition that Windows created as EFI partition, although the installation couldn't proceed because it didn't identified the EFI partition as an EFI partition. \nWhat I want\nI wonder if I delete the partition that Windows created as EFI and let Ubuntu create it's own EFI in the place will things work?\nBut if that isn't possible I don't want Windows 8 anymore in my PC, I will stick with 7 and Ubuntu, but as I don't know a lot about UEFI stuff I am wondering if I just make a backup partition for my important files in NTFS system and delete all the rest and then install Ubuntu and after Windows 7 it will work. \nBecause I don't know if Windows 8 configurations into the UEFI BIOS will remain after deleting it from the HDD and it will prevent me from installing other OS'es and then I will be with no computer at all.\nIn addition I would like to have Ubuntu and Windows 7 installed both as EFI systems if possible cause as far as I know it improves security (correct me if I am wrong) and my motherboard doesn't support Secure Boot it has any option about that in the BIOS and I ran Confirm-SecureBootUEFI command in Windows that returned that my system doesn't support Secure Boot.\nMy PC Specs\n\n\n*\n\n*CORSAIR Vengeance LP 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3 1333 (PC3 10666)\n(CML8GX3M2A1333C9)\n\n*GIGABYTE Radeon HD 7970 3GB 384-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 3.0 x16\n(GV-R797OC-3GD)\n\n*Intel Core i5-3570 Ivy Bridge 3.4GHz (3.8GHz Turbo) LGA 1155 77W\nQuad-Core (BX80637I53570)\n\n*GIGABYTE GA-B75M-D3H Dual-UEFI LGA 1155 Intel B75 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 Micro\nATX (GA-B75M-D3H)\n\n*Seagate Barracuda 1TB 7200 RPM 32MB Cache SATA 6.0Gb/s 3.5\"\n(ST31000524AS)\nAdditional Info\nAs suggested by user Rod Smith I ran Boot Info Script in the live usb of raring daily build, the content of the file RESULTS.txt is here:\n                  Boot Info Script 0.61      [1 April 2012]\n\n\n============================= Boot Info Summary: ===============================\n\n => Windows is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda.\n => Syslinux MBR (4.04 and higher) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sdb.\n\nsda1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows Vista/7: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        /bootmgr /Boot/BCD\n\nsda2: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows Vista/7: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        /bootmgr /Windows/System32/winload.exe\n\nsda3: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ext4\n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info: \n    Operating System:  Ubuntu 13.04\n    Boot files:        /boot/grub/grub.cfg /etc/fstab\n\nsda4: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       swap\n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info: \n\nsdb1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       vfat\n    Boot sector type:  SYSLINUX 4.04 2011-04-18\n    Boot sector info:  Syslinux looks at sector 1628296 of /dev/sdb1 for its \n                       second stage.

It looks like you've got a reasonable grub.cfg file in your Linux partition, although I've not studied every last line of it; but it looks like something went wrong with the GRUB setup, since there's no trace of GRUB in the hard disk's MBR.\nChances are the Ubuntu Boot Repair tool will be able to get things working, although I can't promise that. If you run it and have problems, post back, since there are manual procedures that will almost certainly work, too.\n\nA: it may be caused by many reasons but definitely not Windows 8 because I use both Win8 and Ubuntu 13.04\n\nYou may have a bad disk. If so, you need to set /boot as a separate partition(/dev/sda1) and put it at the head of the disk.\n\nYou may failed to install grub. if so, type grub-install /dev/sda in terminal in a livecd or try a software called \"easybcd\" under windows.\n\nIf your mbr was overwritten by Windows, you may just try \nsudo -i\nmount /dev/sda[#] /mnt\ngrub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sda\nin livecd.

I wanted to dual boot Ubuntu as I had done on my previous Windows 7 laptop. I followed some guides and managed to install it, with the GRUB boot manager (using boot repair).\nHowever I have decided to sell the laptop and needed to remove Ubuntu, I followed some guide which told me to delete the partition in Windows, then use the Recovery disk to restore the Windows boot manager.

I am now left with a laptop I need to fix in 48 hours and no clue how to do it.\nI tried re-installing Ubuntu but after restarting it still loads up grub recovery. \nHow do I restore the Windows boot manager? I  have seen some guides but people say things like mount ESP - but don't explain how to do it - I don't have a clue how!\n\nA: I managed to solve it, I deleted the EFI partition and the C partition. Then created a 1gb partition for EFI and just installed windows from fresh! (Using the install option on Windows 8 Recovery)\n\nA: I ran into this exact problem. I looked around for a technical solution, but suprisingly, the built-in Windows 8 \"Reset your PC\" functionality did the trick.\nhttp://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-restore-and-reset-windows-8-to-factory-settings/\nI ran \"Reset your PC\", which replaced the Grub bootloader with the original. Created a new user account and used the Windows 8 built-in partition manager to remove the prior Ubuntu partition. Worked without a hitch.\n\nA: You can use the recovery option.\nTurn on your laptop, and press F12 to get the Boot Menu.  Highlight Recovery and Utility, then press Enter. \nOR\nClick the MyRecovery icon on your windows desktop.   \n", "Q: How do I uninstall Adobe Reader?

I'm new to Linux and am having terrible difficulty getting my bluetooth devices to pair/connect. I'm using a bluetooth dongle on my Dell Inspiron 910 running Lubuntu 12.04.2 LTS. I've tried blueman bluetooth manager and bluetooth-applet (which I think came preinstalled with Ubuntu) but both crash my system whenever I attempt to pair/connect devices. \nI don't fully understand it at this point but I've read that there is a problem with the bluez package/stack.

I do not trust the encryption either.

Unfortunately, Corsair Link, only works in Windows and lm-sensors / fancontrol do not recognize anything but the pump RPM meaning you can't control the speed of the fans. \nHow do you control the speed of the fans under linux? \n\nA: Corsair suggests that you connect the two fans to the control module via y-connecter. However, doing so under linux makes it impossible to control the fans and they will always run at 100% RPM. \nIf you connect the 2 fans to the motherboard (as chassis fans) you can control the fan speed as you normally would via lm-sensors and fancontrol (see: How to control fan speed?) , significantly reducing the sound level.  \nConnections would be as follows: \nFans x 2 -> Chassis Fan(s) on MOBO\nCorsair Pump control -> CPU Fan on MOBO\nUSB > USB Header on MOBO\n\nIf you're not overclocking, the cooler unit is very unlikely to require management at all.

Does upgrading wipe your hard drive? If it doesn't, does it mess up your personal settings?\nIf anyone has anything to help me, please do so ASAP. I want to know whether or not I should/have to back up my computer on an external hard drive first.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: if you are doing the upgrade via the software manager then no it just upgrades ethe os and does not touch anything else\n\nA: No, an in-place upgrade will not wipe anything. Even if the upgrade fails, it's unlikely to destroy any data, although you may have to use a live CD to recover the data in this case. So it is always advisable to take a full backup prior to upgrading.\nSome people refer to upgrades as a fresh install that doesn't format the partition - which leaves your /home directory in place. This may remove some pre-existing settings or data if it's stored outside of the /home directory.\nIf you are upgrading to fix an existing problem, it's advisable to confirm that the problem is in fact fixed, either by checking the bug report or by running a live CD. Otherwise you might upgrade only to find you have the same problem, and maybe some other new problems. With this in mind, it's advisable to review the Release notes prior to upgrading.\n", "Q: Install Line 6 Toneport UX1 What am I trying to do?\nAs the title suggests, I am trying to install the the Line 6 Toneport UX1 software.\nWhat is the problem?\nUpon reaching the step where I am told to enter sudo apt-get install linux-headers into Terminal in this article, I am confronted with the following message...\nReading package lists...

I downloaded this version from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer and did as it says on instructions, all good until I reboot. When I reboot a message appear and I just can't continue the ubuntu instalation. I took a picture of the message:\n\nMy computer is an Asus series K55V with cpu Intel i5 and I'm using Windows 7.\nIf you could help, I really don't know what's wrong.\n\nA: The first thing you need to is fix the MBR so you can boot the computer again. This is very quick and simple if you have the right tool.\nIf you have the system recovery disks or a bootable Windows repair disk, you can follow the instructions in the screen shot to repair the system. If you don't have one of these, you can also use EasyBCD to fix the problem. (Look for the free edition for personal use at the bottom of that page.)\nIt's hard to say what went wrong with WUBI (the Windows installer). It is a good idea to do a complete defrag of your hard drive before trying again. There are free tools that are more full-featured than the Windows defrag, such as MyDefrag. \nYou might also consider doing a standard install of Ubuntu alongside Windows 7. In my opinion, a regular install is actually less likely to cause you problems than using WUBI, especially over the long-term. In addition, WUBI does not work with 13.04, which is being released on April 25th.\nYou can burn a LiveCD that lets you try Ubuntu without making changes to your machine and then use the LiveCD to install Ubuntu to a new partition on your hard drive.\nIn addition to defragging, MyDefrag lets you also move your files to the beginning of the Windows partition. This is a good thing to do before doing a standard install of Ubuntu. If the disk is heavily fragmented, this file consolidation may take a long time to run, but you can stop MyDefrag and restart it later if needed.\n", "Q: Unable to install Netflix I have tried to install Netflix but I get stuck\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ehoover/compholio\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install netflix-desktop\n\nafter the 3rd command I get a disclaimer but do not know how to pass it to continue the installation it is as follows:\n | 3.

You'll need to contact your computer's manufacturer or read model-specific documentation to learn how to enter your firmware's setup utility.\nThat said, some boot loaders and boot managers offer solutions to at least some of the specific problems you might be facing. For instance, my own rEFInd scans all available filesystems for boot loaders, so it may be able to redirect the boot process to bootable USB devices. (This isn't guaranteed, though; some computers do only minimal USB activation, so USB devices won't appear in rEFInd's menu.) Most EFI boot managers can also be configured to launch an EFI shell, which can give you a command-line interface to do some (but not all) of the things that a firmware's setup utility can do.\n\nA: I think you still should be able to enter your BIOS and disable some options there like secure boot of fastboot in order to enable booting form pendrive.  \nIn my case (I have a Samsung Series 3 with Win 8 pre installed) Bios wont show any other boot option unless the bootable media (the pendrive/DVD) is plugged/inserted before reboot,  and the options fast boot and secure boot are disable.

You can get Google-desktop search results on a webpage in the browser. I was wondering if there is a way to get that webpage using the wget command or any other way to get the page in the terminal.\nThe URL that shows on the location bar for google-Desktop search is :\nlocalhost:33327/search?flags=8&hl=en_US&num=10&q=hemingway&start=0&s=JD1G1cWkjb88GSZ1EPB3LVgcSwo\nThis sample url for the search query hemingway shows on my computer.\n\nA: It is possible to retrieve the pages via wget. The simplest approach would be to simply copy the URL Google Desktop produces and paste it into wget \"URL HERE\".\nHowever, if your wish is to  do this all from Terminal without having to search using Google Desktop first, that will rely on if Google Desktop has to generate the results before giving you the link or not, and if the port it uses stays the same.\nIf you can simply search for \"PIE\" in Google Desktop and then, and in the Webpage that it opens, modify the URL so it says \"CAKE\" instead of \"PIE\", and then returns results for \"CAKE\". If that works then you can simply copy the URL into Terminal and modify it for whatever results you want:\nwget \"http://localhost:33327/search?flags=8&hl=en_US&num=10&q=SEARCH+REQUEST+HERE&start=0&s=JD1G1cWkjb88GSZ1EPB3LVgcSwo\"\nThat should work and you can feel free to use that in a Bash script or whatever.\nHowever viewing the results of the search in the Terminal is another thing. You could simply use a Terminal Editor like nano to open the HTML file but then you'll be staring at the RAW HTML code and that isn't the easiest thing to look at for search results. It is possible to make a Script to scrape the Results into something legible in the Terminal but that will be a lot of effort tweaking things correctly and is beyond the scope of this question. If you want to use Google Desktop search then I recommend simply opening the Webpage in a Browser like it was designed to do. \n", "Q: Backing up NAS to NAS I am pretty new to Ubuntu.

In addition my Plex media will be stored on a normal WD external plugged directly into the laptop. I would also like this to be sync'd daily. Is this a complicated setup for the syncing? Where do I begin?  \n\nA: Well there are two things you can look at in regards to backup/sync.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup / Archive - This will be a synced backup that will be\nsomething you can recover from the historical data.\n\n*Sync - Same files on both locations similar to dropbox\n\n\nIf you are looking to do a backup / archive sync, there is a protocol \"rsync\" that is fairly handy in linux environments. http://rsync.samba.org/\nIf you are looking for something like the dropbox type sync, bittorrent came out with software that make it easy to have your own sync'd environment. http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html\nThe btsync can be a little process intense depending on what you mean by older laptop.\n", "Q: How can I burn a Video DVD? I've been trying all day to make a simple video DVD to play on a regular DVD player, but I just can't seem to figure to out. I don't understand what an image is and all the apps that I've tried today seem to use this same terminology. I tried Brasero, K3b, DeVeDe, and a few others. I have read here in the forum and in other threads that these were the ones that people seem to use. I just can't seem to create a DVD. I don't know that burning an image means or anything.\nI used Windows for years and absolutely love and prefer Ubuntu now, but I just miss how easy windows software was in creating DVDs. Select a file(s) and press burn and that was it. Can some please help me out on this. I know I sound like a total noob, but I really, truly don't understand any of this burning DVDs here.....yet \n\nA: An 'image' is basically a file that describes what the contents of a disk are. You probably had to download one of these 'images' to install Ubuntu, unless you used WUBI. It looks like you want to burn a video, so I would suggest using DVD Styler, which is in the Software Center. I know that it seems complicated, but you can't just burn a video file to a DVD. It must be properly formatted, so DVD Styler will take care of all that for you.\n", "Q: When using Ubuntu with the Kubuntu desktop it asks me to install Rails Recently I installed Kubuntu (http://www.kubuntu.org/) to improve the speed of using Ubuntu.

THANKS IN ADVANCE.\n\nA: I believe you want to install Ubuntu alongside your Windows 7. You can try this....\nBefore you start the installation, create a separate disk partition in Windows. Insert your bootable disc/USB device. Follow the instructions. When you see the disk chooser, select your newly created hard disk partition. Select the Change option from below. Format it to ext4 and select mount point /. Press okay. Below, you'll see option for bootloader device. Click on it and choose the topmost option (It'll have some information about your HDD i.e. its size, manufacturer etc). Click continue when you are asked for swap partition option. If you do want to create a swap partition you'll have to create another partition. You won't need it in normal use anyway.\n\nA: The solution is very simple ... \nInstall EaseUs partition in technician mode ... \nThen go to HDD menue then click with right and chose convert to basic HDD ... \nThere is a risk to loose your files but I have not loss them ... \nThen you will install ubuntu alongside windows ... \n", "Q: Write Permission Error I have transmission-deamon running and it's giving me the error Permission Denied: /mnt/RyNet/Downloads/the-torrent/some-file.ext\nSo it cannot write files to the download directory:\nryguy@MPU /mnt/RyNet $ id debian-transmission\nuid=120(debian-transmission) gid=132(debian-transmission) groups=132(debian-transmission),117(sambashare)\nryguy@MPU /mnt/RyNet $ ps aux | grep transmis\n120      16184  0.2  0.3  57724 12644 ?

When I rebooted, I got an error claiming that it couldn’t read \\, and got thrown into a read-only shell, which necessitated booting from a rescue disk to revert to the original fstab.\nSo: What are the correct options for SSD, and how can I make sure I won't get locked out of the system again?\n\nA: You used a backslash (\"\\\") rather than a forward slash (\"/\"), which is not allowed on Uinux-like systems like Linux.\n\nA: For my own SSD I use discard, noatime which seems to work, but with the /etc/fstab you have to make sure that no spelling errors are present or it can halt boot-up...\nDuring initial boot hold down SHIFT key and go into recovery mode and from there you can enable read/write by selecting fix repo's and then drop to prompt to fix your /etc/fstab file...\n\nA: You should not add whitespace in the options list. discard,relatime should be used instead of discard, relatime. While you are at it, you can remove relatime since this is the default setting for recent kernels.\nTo fix this error, you can boot from a Live CD, mount your root partition and edit the /etc/fstab file with appropriate permissions.\n", "Q: Please help me speedup my Ubuntu 12 top - 08:28:09 up 12:59,  2 users,  load average: 0.59, 0.47, 0.35\nTasks: 200 total,   1 running, 199 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie\nCpu(s):  7.1%us,  2.7%sy,  0.0%ni, 88.1%id,  2.0%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.0%si,  0.0%st\nMem:   3981656k total,  3817680k used,   163976k free,   145792k buffers\nSwap:  8910840k total,    25940k used,  8884900k free,   632852k cached\n\n  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND            \n 1784 cassandr  20   0 2828m 1.4g  16m S    6 35.7   1:18.35 jsvc               \n 5250 dev       20   0 1537m 195m  47m S    6  5.0   4:19.77 spotify            \n 1202 root      20   0  307m 188m  16m S    4  4.8   2:05.38 Xorg               \n 2972 dev       20   0 1501m 368m  29m S    3  9.5   1:52.79 compiz             \n 5274 dev       20   0  586m  17m  10m S    1  0.4   0:02.33 gnome-terminal     \n 2944 dev       20   0 28020 3712  608 S    1  0.1   0:03.83 dbus-daemon        \n 2981 dev        9 -11  421m 5864 3612 S    0  0.1   0:15.76 pulseaudio         \n 3005 dev       20   0  628m  15m  10m S    0  0.4   0:00.17 nm-applet          \n 3083 dev       20   0  388m  10m 7100 S    0  0.3   0:02.48 bamfdaemon         \n 5485 root      20   0 17440 1476 1040 R    0  0.0   0:06.14 top                \n 6091 dev       20   0  716m  88m  40m S    0  2.3   0:03.06 chrome             \n 6255 dev       20   0  925m  76m  28m S    0  2.0   0:02.26 chrome             \n    1 root      20   0 24564 2356 1288 S    0  0.1   0:02.40 init               \n    2 root      20   0     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.00 kthreadd           \n    3 root      20   0     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:01.72 ksoftirqd/0        \n    6 root      RT   0     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.63 migration/0        \n    7 root      RT   0     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.12 watchdog/0         \n    8 root      RT   0     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.46 migration/1        \n   10 root      20   0     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:01.44 ksoftirqd/1        \n   12 root      RT   0     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.07 watchdog/1         \n   13 root       0 -20     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.00 cpuset             \n   14 root       0 -20     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.00 khelper            \n   15 root      20   0     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.00 kdevtmpfs          \n   16 root       0 -20     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.00 netns    \n\nMy system used to be real fast (Dell Optiplex 745 w 4 GB memory) but now I think that I installed so many applications and that I got that many background processes so that it slows down my system.

You might consider running Spotify minimized so that it doesn't have to update the screen as much, which will also reduce some of the CPU usage of Xorg and compiz; you also might consider using a lighter-weight window manager than compiz, such as Metacity or even switching to Xfce (apt-get install xubuntu-desktop) which provides a mature classic-Gnome-like interface without a lot of bloat.\n\nA: Instead of removing Cassandra, you could have stopped the Cassandra service or removed Cassandra from the init.d entries.\n", "Q: How to know the installed Ubuntu version is beta2 or final release For example, I haved install Ubuntu 13.04 beta2 and sudo apt-get update & upgrade, and lsb_release shows:  \nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 13.04\nRelease:        13.04\nCodename:       raring\n\nBut can not find beta 2 symbol.

I also try to change temporary boot location to the flash drive but in vain. The Windows Screen shows up no matter what I do and I never get a hint of the Ubuntu install menu.\nI've tried doing this before and was unsuccessful a couple of times, and I really want to try Ubuntu. I want to know the exact steps I should follow to boot Ubuntu 12.10 from my USB stick.\nMy system specs are:\nMicrosoft Windows 7 Home Basic\nVersion 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601\nSystem Type X86-based PC\nProcessor   Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU  330   @ 1.60GHz, 1596 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)\n\nA: do not use the reccomended program ubuntu said to use to make the bootable flash drive as it doesn't work properly.\nIstall unetbootin, it is free. Select the ubuntu to install and choose what flash drive to use and it will do everything for you. around 1 hour later everything should be ready. after that you can reboot and choose the usb flash drive to the top of the boot up order menu in the bios. after that the computer should boot into ubuntu. then install ubuntu and go through the steps, in one of the stages it lets you choose if you would like to replace windows 8 with ubuntu or dual boot windows 8 and ubuntu. then it will let make a new partition.\nAfter it finishes install reboot and remove the flash drive and there should be a menu showing you which system you woruld like to boot into every time you switch on your laptop/pc/netbook/mac.\n\nA: Just check if you have done the following while trying to make a bootable usb drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the .iso file to from the ubuntu.com/downloads\n\n*Download linux live from http://www.linuxliveusb.com/en/download and run it.\n\n*While running the program,insert the usb drive you want to boot ubuntu from and select the .iso file and the program burns it to your usb drive.\n\n*Boot your laptop from external device(1st priority) and install ubuntu.When the laptop restarts, press F2(in most cases), F8,F10 OR F12.When the BIOS screen appears, go to the boot tab and deselect the 'boot from hard drive' option and make the 'boot from external device' as the first priority.\nIf you are unable to successfully boot from the usb drive, I would recommend you to make a bootable cd-rom.But there are issues with this type of installation and you maybe required to try a few times due to the compatibility issue of cd-rom these days. \n\nA: could you try resetting your bios, then change your boot order so the usb is first, disconnect any other usb things you have connected while booting?\nif worst comes to worst you could use WUBI if you wish to just try it\n\nA: After installing your USB, restart your computer. hit Enter immediately, go to start - set your boot menu to Default. It booted my Windows 7 Professional to Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can use Unetbootin and press F12 when the brand of your laptop appears on the screen when it boots. choose the usb storage device option.\n", "Q: Nvidia driver for GeForce GTX 660 I am having troubles installing the Nvidia driver on my new installation of Ubuntu Gnome Remix (12.10, at first).

Please try providing more logs. Anyway, Ubuntu's default is pulseaudio and not alsa.\nSo please check your PulseAudio settings (from GUI) whether the pulseaudio sees your hardware and whether it's enabled (and the volume).\n1.)

You can also check /var/log/syslog to see whether there are some bad log messages about your hardware...\n3.) BTW: Upgrading entire distribution just because of an audio. Next time, please try using this site (askubuntu), stackoverflow site and similar well-known and trusted sources...\n4.)

But it's your choice...\n1) You could log into GUI as a root (but ubuntu doesn't have normal root user you can switch into), so i guess this is out.\n2) You can add your user into root/admin/whatever group thus granting him most of the privileges you need. Command is usermod with some parameters...\n3) You can set privileges on each file to rwx for everybody (which is really dangerous). The commad for this is something like chmod -R 777 run in the /.\nBut my opinion is that if you want to use linux system the \"windows way\", you'll be pretty disappointed.

How's that possible.\nEDIT\nJust giving you an example. I have Oracle Java(JDK 7) installed but when I want to install Netbeans via Software Center it is asking to install Open JDK.

(You may also have to do the same for javac, javaw and javaws).\n\nA: Ubuntu supports OpenJDK out of the box. Leave OpenJDK installed. This way installing software that rely on Java will not reinstall OpenJDK each time.\nAfter installing Oracle Java 7, use your environment variables and the Ubuntu alternatives system to configure Oracle JDK as the default.\nWhen installing software like NetBeans you will have to consult the Netbeans documentation and specifically configure Netbeans to work with the Oracle JDK instead of OpenJDK. Some software detect your default Java from the environment variables while others don't.\nHere is a blog entry that installs Oracle Java 7 using the Ubuntu alternatives system: http://hendrelouw73.wordpress.com/2013/04/16/how-to-install-oracle-java-7-update-21-on-ubuntu-12-04-linux/\nHere is a link to the update-alternatives command: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/update-alternatives.8.html\n", "Q: Youtube video useless after the last update After some updates recently, Youtube videos now run extremely jerkily.

Because of this, you end up with the folders that are created in a Read only state.

You can change the 777 value to a 700 if you do not feel safer from others looking on the computer ^^.\nIf the folders are not inside a custom (Eg: home/recoveryfolder/recup_dir.X....) then you must apply the chmod to each folder seperately or do something like this in home:\nchmod 777 recup_dir* -R\nThis should bring back the access permission to all recup_dir folder for you.\n\nA: force remove the folders as root.\nsudo rm -rf recup*\n\nthis will remove all directories starts with 'recup'.\n", "Q: Gaming with Virtualbox, has it worked for you? Currently I am using Windows 8. I have a virtual box with Ubuntu set up for development. Aside from that I sometimes just want to relax and enjoy a game (Battlefield 3, Skyrim, Saints Row: The Third, etc) after hours of research and development. \nI want to have my main machine with linux, and install windows on a virtual box. \nWhat I want to know, from those who have tried or seen it:\n\n\n*\n\n*How is the performance?\n\n*I've never been clear on this but, even if I install the correct drivers on the windows box, will it matter? At least on this part, I'm just curious how it offload. Which drivers will matter the most. \n\n*Mouse and Keyboard integration, I'll be honest, sometimes the mouse integration in Virtual Box is a bit frustrating, mouse cursor disappears, etc. \n\n\nI'm not sure if this is the right place to ask. I'm merely trying to come back to linux, yet I'm a PC gamer so I can't throw away Steam. I'm aware of the linux client, but most of those games won't work. \nIf there's a right place to ask this whether StackExchange sites or any other site let me know. \nCheers and I hope those in the same position find a middle ground. \n\nA: You might want to look at something called Kainy. This is a remote desktop implementation that is specifically for gaming.\nIt sounds like having a Windows PC on your network to run the games might be OK, if you play the game from where you wanted. Kainy has a server for Windows, and clients for a number of OS, and game systems. They don't have a server for Linux, though.\nAs far as gaming on VirtualBox, I think it would be OK if VirtualBox had better graphics accelerator support. I think the emulation argument is a bit exaggerated. Windows is executing with the same processor it expects, no added expense there. VirtualBox mediates Windows hardware calls, and there may be some overhead.\nThe big problem is that VirtualBox is not built for gaming, supporting 3D graphics is not a priority. Nonetheless, if you have an older game that is not requiring graphics support beyond what VirtualBox has, I don't see why you wouldn't go ahead and run it there. \n\nA: The, \"Windows only\", Star Trek game, Elite Force II (Quake 3 based) is working (Full-screen, 1024x768, and fast), in my Virtual box (experimental graphic ON), on my painstakingly (XP's .net fix poo) installed, XP Pro (32bit updated) \"virtual machine\".\nMy VB is running on a stable base/foundation, host OS of Debian 7 (wheezy/stable 64bit). You can run Ubuntu....\nBTW, my DM is Mate, as I have custom added the stable, Mate repos, and custom added Mate's parts (after painstakingly removing most of Gnome 3 = advanced work). \nThe Linux Mint installer (Ubuntu based, with Mate for your 32 bit, or 64bit system)... is the easy way. VB, and over Ubuntu complied packages, not Debian (pure) ones, should be about the same. Use Ubuntu if you already have it. \n\nA: There's a bunch of answers here which tell you that running games over virtualised hardware is a bad idea, and won't get you good performance for gaming.  So don't do that.\nI'm not sure about virtualbox, but I've seen people talk about considerable success by having hardware dedicated to the virtual machine, albeit what I've seen mostly concerned using Xen or VMWare.  Specifically, they use a separate graphics card and sound card, and a dedicated disk partition.  The linux system likely won't even have drivers for the hardware that is used by your windows gaming VM, and certainly won't connect to them.  Problems seem to be more with the sound than the graphics.\nI haven't gone down this road myself, so I won't try to specifics of how you'd set this up.  TBH, for the time it'd take to get this running well (unless I had a very specific recipe to follow), I think I'd rather put a separate machine under my desk and hook up my Keyboard, mouse and screen via a KVM switch.\n\nA: Gaming in a Virtual box is a bad idea. You wont have the great 3D support that you desire and applications that require a lot of resources will lag. Some games will probably work, like minecraft and minesweeper. But running heavy programs like Battlefield, Skyrim and similar will not work. \nThe reason for this is that you are basically running two operating systems within each other and the one you will be emulating will be limited to a small portion of that computers resources. \nA solution to this problem is dual boot. For example you have one partition with Linux (where you are all serious and stuff) and one partition with windows (for gaming). I had this setup on my laptop for several years it works great. \nThere are instructions in the Ubuntu installer for how you install with a dual boot setup. The easiest is to install Windows first and then install Ubuntu. \nGood luck. \n\nA: Personally, I have mixed results running games in Virtualbox. But I can play some of my favorites. There is a (really small) wikia site with some results about working and non-working games at http://virtualbox-gaming.wikia.com/ if you want to take a look or even post your own results.\n\nA: This is an older question, but I'm adding a comment for others that are looking for help.  A friend asked me for advice on this after reading this post.\nUsing the WINE facility works much better than VirtualBox, especially for older games written for WinXP and earlier. I'm a huge fan of the old Star Trek Armada II game, which runs great on Ubuntu using WINE.  It actually runs much better using WINE under UBUNTU-MATE than it does on Windows 10 on the same machine.  \nThe PlayOnLinux package for UBUNTU is a great help.  For games that have problems with the WINE defaults, the PlayOnLinux helps with their configuration.  If the game you want to install isn't listed, you use the link at the bottom to \"install a non-listed program\". Ones that run without any special configuration are often no on the list. The best thing is that it will let you have a separate virtual C: drive for each game you install.  This is really helpful because older games sometimes used DLLs that could conflict with others and cause problems.  By each game you install having its own virtual C: drive, they never conflict with one another.  \nGreg\n\nA: For me, It have worked pretty well, decided to go for the advanced run. Wanted to try GPU-Passtrough (shortly, you make the VM has access to the GPU entirely) Needles to say, I could play games, at full graphics, and Virtual Reality.

I opened the ports 443 (TCP) and 1194 (UDP), in both, router and client system (which is Ubuntu 12.10), and configured Deluge and Transmission to use the 1194 port. When the VPN is turned off, the tests on both programs shows that the port is open, however when I connect the VPN, the port appears closed on the tests, and here is the catch: Deluge and Transmission connects only trough TCP port, and the 1194 port of the VPN is UDP only.\nThat's what brings my number one question: What I should do to open the 1194 port on the VPN? It's possible force Deluge or Transmission to use UDP port?\nMy second question is simpler (I think so). As I said before, I can connect to the VPN using the command \"sudo openvpn --config client.ovpn\", the downside is that it's necessary keep the terminal open, I'd like to connect trough the graphical interface, typically: click on the network manager on the top bar > go to VPN connections > select the connection > and done. But I dunno how to do this, and that's my second question: How can I export the \"client.ovpn\" configurations or setup the connection through the graphical interface?\nI use Ubuntu for an year and half, and I consider myself an intermediary user, however, I've never played with VPS and OpenVPN-AS before, so I'm a totally noob on the subject. I have googled my doubts, but most tutorials are OpenVPN based, and not OpenVPN-AS, and apparently they are quite different.\nI hope that my post it's clear enough, and sorry about my english. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!\n\nA: Concerning your first question: UDP port 1149 should be open at the server so clients could connect to it. I checked here and the client seems to use a higher port range (>50000) by default to send and receive UDP packets to server port 1149.\nHowever, it appears you have a slight misunstanding about the working of a VPN, so I try to clear it up a little. On startup of the client the routing table should be adjusted so that all (or most or some, that depends on your config) traffic goes through the tun0 interface instead of the eth0 interface. The only packets going directly through eth0 should be UDP packets to the server at port 1149, every other packets, TCP or UDP or ICMP, are routed through tun0 where they are encapsulated by openvpn and then send via the 1149 UDP packets through eth0 to the server.\nAt the server the encapsulation is reversed and the TCP, UDP or ICMP packets are reassembled and send from there like they originate from a neighbouring network node incoming on a local interface (eth0/tun0/tap0) and are routed accordingly. So your client appears to \"own\" an interface on the server. Hence the name virtual private network.\nSo you have to configure transmission or deluge to use any other port than 1149 - because this one is used by VPN - i.e. 16000 (TCP and UDP). Use this port in transmission or deluge and open it in the firewall on the server and possibly route it to the VPN interface, so in this example (assuming server has interface eth0):\nOpen ports 16000 on the server\niptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -m tcp -p tcp --dport 16000 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -m udp -p udp --dport 16000 -j ACCEPT\n\nand apply NAT. These lines redirects all incoming TCP and UDP connections to ports 16000-16010 on the server to the VPN interface with the IP address 10.0.0.5\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -m multiport -p udp --dports 16000:16010 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.5\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -m multiport -p tcp --dports 16000:16010 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.5\n\nWell, there may be other or better ways to handle this, but this should get you started.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make Ubuntu \"forget\" a network connection? Is there a file or something that holds the data for the internet connections?\n\nA: In Ubuntu, take a look at the following folder: /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/. \nThe files in here should contain the network connections' settings Network Manager has saved: network card used to connect to the network, SSID name, wireless key/passphrase, IP configuration method, etc.\nOf course, the files can only be read as root. Using your normal account, you cannot open the files and read the settings.\nThe files cannot be deleted by another user than root. To delete a settings file, an administrator would execute the following commands in a terminal:\ncd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections\nrm <filename>\n\nwhere <filename> would be replaced by the actual filename. To delete all the settings files in one time, an administrator would use the * joker as the filename.\n\nA: You can click on the Network Icon --> Edit Connections, this will let you delete previous Wireless or Wired configurations.\n", "Q: manually do a `make install` I just built a large program that had some other programs in the source tree.\nmake install just installed the main program, but I want to install all of the sub-programs that were built as well.\nIs there a way to do this?\nNote: by install I mean that I can type it from any shell, or through any program (though really I only care about make) and it will run.\n\nA: What the make install command does depends on how the Makefile is written and what it consists.\nThe most generic way of finding out what binaries, libraries, man pages, etc. your make command produces so that you can modify your Makefile could be like the one below. I assume you're in the top of your build directory.\ntouch /tmp/tstamp\nmake clean\n./configure [your options]\nmake\nfind . -newer /tmp/tstamp\n\nThis should give you a list of files that have been modified since you've created the /tmp/tstamp file.\nCompare the list of files being installed with make install with the list  obtained by using the find command and add the desired remaining files to your Makefile.\nIf you get that list and just want to make it work (in a quick and dirty manner), moving them to proper target locations should be a matter of a simple for loop one-liner, bearing in mind the --prefix (if any) you've specified during the build configuration stage.\n", "Q: my user ~/bin folder is not working I'm running 12.04\nI have two files  \n/usr/bin/uim-tomoe-gtk  \n~/bin/uim-tomoe-gtk\n\nthe first is the tomoe kanji program\nthe second is a script that runs kanjipad instead\n#!/bin/bash\nexec kanjipad $@\nexit 0\n\nI expect to now be able to type uim-tomoe-gtk into the terminal and get my kanjipad application to start up. But the uim-tomoe-gtk program comes up instead.\nWhat am I doing wrong or what information do I need to provide?\n\nA: There are two things you need to do.\nFirstly, the shell will not get ~/bin/ in $PATH when you login if it does not exist. You will have to log out and log in again after creating the directory, or start a new login shell with:\n/bin/bash -l\n\nor add ~/bin to your path manually with:\nexport PATH=/home/user/bin:$PATH\n\nSecondly, the shell keeps a cache of where programs are located. If you create a script in ~/bin/ (or /usr/local/) which shadows something in /usr/ then you must manually update the cache. You can clear it completely with this command which should do the trick:\nhash -r\n\n\nA: The problem is probably that /usr/bin is ahead of ~/bin in your PATH, or ~/bin isn't in your PATH at all.\nTo fix, put this line at the end of your .bash_profile file:\nexport PATH=~/bin:$PATH\n\nBe warned, though, that this will do the same thing for other scripts in your ~/bin folder. For example if you have /usr/bin/example_command and ~/bin/example_command, the command in your home directory will take precedence.\nHonestly, I would just rename the script.\n", "Q: Why does bluetooth connect but not transmit any audio?

What would I need to do \nbefore I submit my app to the software center?\nFor reference: My app is made with Python 2.7.X, GTK3, and the Ubuntu Quickly tool.\nThank you for any and all assistance.\n\nA: This library is licensed using the LGPLv3, so you can use it with a commercial app without problems.\nNow you have a couple of options to solve your problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*The easiest way is to just include pygal in your project. Just add it as a module. Copy the pygal folder to your project root folder and import it.\n\n*A somewhat more complicated way is to add a script that uses pip to install it. Not worth the time IMHO, it won't auto-update, will need root privileges and looks quite complicated.\n\n*Finally you can package pygal yourself in it's own deb. This option has clear advantages like a clean install and uninstall and a better update policy. While this is clearly the better option for an open-source tool that is going to be distributed by a PPA, it will be very difficult to use with the Software Center.\nSo, in your position, I'd go for number one.\n", "Q: Alienware - Webcam - Mic don't work I have Alienware M14x R1 laptop.

You can then download each installer, right-click on them in your file manager and click: \nOpen With > Wine Windows Program Loader \nthen run the installer WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OF THE DEFAULTS.\nThe desktop links don't normally work, so try finding the actual executable in '~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files' in your file manager (press Ctrl + H to see hidden files like .wine)\nYou can also try:\nsudo apt-get install wine1.4\n\nafter adding the PPA as mentioned before to try the 'stable' version of Wine.\nThis probably won't work, so go to the webpages that I linked you to and check on there for solutions to bugs.

As far as I understand, gsettings stores all the settings in ~/.config/dconf/user. If true, and if it also stores proxy settings there, then is there any way for an external custom application to retrieve these settings from this file?\n\nA: The idea of having a command like gsettings is that it doesn't matter where or how the settings are stored.

You could do 4GB 32/64-bit or 8GB 64-bit. You can run up to 64GB of RAM in 32-bit thanks to PAE (physical address extension) but it is probably best to switch to 64-bit. You should be able to run software perfectly in 64-bit and with chroot/VirtualBox, you can always run 32-bit software that (for whatever reason) doesn't work in 64-bit in an emulated 32-bit system.\nGraphics card manufacturer? Well there is only really nVidia and AMD. Both seem to have proprietary drivers for Linux that you can use. I have had lots of problems with nVidia but I have an old GeForce 7050 (only 256MB of GRAM)...it's your choice really. It might make sense to go with an Intel CPU/nVidia GPU setup or an AMD CPU/AMD GPU setup. Your choice.\nThis is a little off-topic but it is Ubuntu specific ;)\n", "Q: Why doesn't gnome-online-accounts accept a Google \"application specific password\"? I use 2-step verification with Google, so when giving permission to gnome-online-accounts to access my Google account, I have to type in the authentication code as well. That's just fine, it's how things are supposed to work.\nHowever, every so often my login would be reset and I'd need to re-enter everything. So, I tried to create an application specific password for use with gnome-online-accounts, but it won't accept it; it's telling me to use my account password instead.\nAnyone knows why that is or--more importantly--if there's any way of changing the way it works, or otherwise save my Google-credentials with gnome-online-accounts under 2-step verification?\n\nA: No I don't know, but I do know with gnome 3.8 and ubuntu 13.04 there is an issue, see:\nhttp://kparal.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/gnome-3-6-gnome-online-accounts-and-google-two-factor-authentication/\nperhaps this helps.\n\nA: This seems to be a bug.  And from what I read, it looks like there is a workaround for Gnome 3.8.\nAre you using 2-factor authentication with Google? If you are, then it is\nbetter not to use GOA at the moment.\nThe problem is that in 3.6 we use CalDAV for Google Calendars, which does not\nwork with OAuth tokens, only with passwords. Neither does GTalk, which needs\nOAuth2.\nWe have partly solved the problem for 3.8, by migrating our Google provider to use OAuth2. This takes care of GTalk, but the problem with calendars remain.\nGoogle does have plans to support OAuth2 with CalDAV, but not sure when that\nwill be available more widely. Or you can write and maintain a libgdata based\nbackend for E-D-S till that happens.\nThis is only about Google.\nFor complete info, see GNOME Bug 688364\n\nA: Perhaps this helps. http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=175197, its from google, so perhaps this might give some details.\n", "Q: Windows 7 to Ubuntu - erased data I am quite new with Ubuntu and I am not that good with computers at all. I had Windows 7, however due to some problems I didn't like that operational system because of that I decided to install Ubuntu.\nMy problem is: before installing Ubuntu via USB drive, it gives a chance to the program to be tested through it. However, by mistake, I started the installation of the operational system without giving any directory. As you all know Windows has two partitions \"C\" - where the system is written and \"D\" - the hard driver. By begging the installation my entire information and the drivers \"C\" and \"D\" were deleted. Furthermore  at the moment instead of showing \"C\" and \"D\" it shows up one partition with the entire memory of the computer.\nAt that point by stopping the installation of Ubuntu, the computer does not have any operational system only the BIOS (which i am not quite sure what it is). Furthermore the computer is running at the moment by using the Ubuntu operational system installed on the USB. Since it happen me that accident there was nothing over-saved on the computer. \nMy question is: Could it be restored the partition \"D\" (as a partition) or at least the data within that partition?\nIf you are going to ask me did I made a backup on some external hard, the answer is \"no\". Because of that please if some one knows how to restore the lost data to help me. I do believe is still possible to be saved. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to ask.\n\nA: you can recover your data on d partition  through recover software such as test disk or foremost, for safety I recommend to do this data recover with live cd such as Systemrescuecd.\nbut, i dont guarantee 100% data on your deleted partition was back..  you can read more about test disk and systemrescuecd on this website http://www.sysresccd.org/SystemRescueCd_Homepage or foremost on this web http://foremost.sourceforge.net/\n\nA: If the documents and pictures you want to recover are important to you, take it to an expert.  Would you forgive yourself if through an accident or improper action taken when trying to restore, you were not able to restore everything, or you accidentally lost the lot?\nAn expert will be able to restore more than most tools.\nIf you don't, then I can only advise, do not do anything more that will write to the drive.  Do not try to install an operating system on it or boot from it.  Boot only from rescue CDs or the Ubuntu thumb drive.  Buy a second drive, bigger than the one you want to restore from.  When restoring, restore to the extra drive, not touching the original.  Testdisk/photorec are decent restore programs but quite technical and recommended for experts, especially when doing an accidental format restore, which is what this is.  You'll want to search for lost NTFS partitions with cluster size of probably 4096 (4kB) and recover from them.\nI'll also say that your chance for being able to restore most of your data is very good, especially for (what used to be) the second partition (D:, I assume).\n", "Q: Unity Crashed, Ctrl + Alt + T not working, Logonscreen bland Initially I realize this isn't going to have all the information needed so one of the first things that would be good is getting advice on how to obtain the relevant debug logs or... how to actually find my terminal now.\nI was previously using 12.10 fairly happily, I had some kind of repository update error which initially resulted in being unable to update anything due to (I think i remember this right) some corrupt or missing packages. After a bit of fiddling this all seemed to go away with the exception of a red do not entersign which then hung around in my top right hand unity bar for a while. So I trundled on and happily ignored it all for about a month.\nHowever yesterday, I went to update and something went pretty wrong. To my eye Unity seemed to crash, the launch bar disappeared, the top bar disappeared, Ctrl+Alt+T stopped working. I could bring up a new browser window using the F keys, and later discovered I could take it out of graphical mode to access some form of terminal.\nThis even went through to the logon screen which held a similar kind of look, but now with incorrect fonts, inconsistent transparencies and apparently highlightable text. Very odd. \nI figured I'd uninstalled unity somehow, went out of graphical mode, sudo apt-get install unity (which did in fact appear to be missing). Reinstalled it successfully but then... still won't. \nMy plan B was to upgrade to 13.04 (i figured this might paste over the cracks I seemed to be working so hard to develop). I managed this, rebooted but the problem persisted.\nLauncher has returned now although the dash search seems unable to find the majority of installed programs. Ctrl+Alt+T is still absent (which is the most scary for me as my entire working knowledge of Linux centers around cunningly Googled terminal commands). Gnome appears to be the default choice for browser and top bar. \nbasically everything looks like this: \n\ncan anyone tell me\n\n\n*\n\n*How I might have managed this (would be nice not to do this again).\n\n*what therefore caused it\n\n*How to repair it\n\n\nI'd prefer not to have to reinstall my system as there's files poorly organized everywhere and I'm not sure what I might be nuking.\nAlso all of the above reoccurs consistently no matter how many times I go about restarting...\nA beautiful mess. \n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04, you can fix any unity problems by running\nunity --reset\n\nin a terminal. In Ubuntu 12.10 and onwards however, this command is deprecated, and now you must run the following to reset Unity:\nunity-reset\n\nI also see you are having trouble getting a terminal open. Linux normally has 4 terminal sessions open when it boots up, and you can access then by pressing CTRL+ALT+F[1 to 4]. To return back to the desktop, press CTRL+ALT+F7.\n\nIn that case that doesn't fix your problem, then it could be a GNOME problem. A suggestion here guides you on how to reset GNOME settings to their factory settings and goes into detail how to back them up, so I suggest you follow that tutorial.\n\nIf you are still experiencing problems after resetting GNOME settings, then your most likely problem is a missing package of some sort. Try installing the ubuntu-desktop package again by running:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nIt will install many other packages, but hopefully that should fix your desktop without needing to reformat your OS and starting afresh.\n", "Q: Intel desktop mothermoard with integrated graphic.

I made a typo and ran my shell script recursively. Example:\n#!/bin/bash\n# filename: kill-me-please.sh   \n./kill-me-please.sh\n\nThis caused my system to become unresponsive and all I could do was a hard restart.\nTried same on MacOS and it was able to detect this problem and terminated the script with an error.\nI think an operating system should be able to handle such a situation. Is this a bug? \n\nA: What you have done can be called a fork bomb.  A fork bomb is a shell script, or a single shell command that calls itself recursively, and thus fills up all the system resources.  Rather than a bug, this is a DoS attack.\nEvery time ./kill-me-please.sh is executed, a new process is created, using some memory and clock cycles.  Your program is capable of creating infinitely many forks of itself, but because the system resources are finite, at some point on time, you'll run out of resources.  There are many kinds of fork bombs which exploit this possibility.  Another well-known example is:\n$ :(){ :|:& };:\n\nHere : is the name of a shell function.  In the function, the : is recursively called two times in a subshell.  This will have the same affect as your script.\nDefusing these fork bombs is hard, as all the resources might get exploited by the fork bomb until you find and apply the necessary routine.  Some ways of recovery are explained and discussed in this Wikipedia article.\nTo prevent this, on Linux and possibly other Unices, one can use ulimit utility to limit the number of processes that a user can create. ulimit -Hu 50 will hard-limit user to 50 processes (so user won't be able to change it). Also on many systems there are configuration files that can be used to set this kind of limits.\nChances are your OS X system already has a process limit set.  I can think of other ways to prevent this, but I can't say neither my ideas are valid solutions nor they are implemented by any operating system, so, I'll keep them to myself.  Possibly many people reading this thread will think about same possibilities anyway.\n", "Q: problem with ubuntu 12.10 as it is not showing up in boot menu i installed ubuntu 12.10 alongside windows 7.

It doesn't happen consistently, but when it happens, instead of showing the login screen I get some vague one-line error message about some service failing to start (can't remember exactly what it says now, and it's not copy-pasteable...) the following error message:\n** (plymouthd:313): WARNING **: Command line `dbus-launch --autolaunch=56a6ab7418a994dcd756ff100000002 --binary-syntax --close-stderr' exited with non-zero exit status 1: Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed.\\n\n\nFor those of you too lazy to scroll: the line ends with Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed.\nThe only way to get anything done is to Ctrl+Alt+Fx to one of they TTY terminals, which after login proceeds to tell me (once or more twice) that I Failed to connect to X Server, and refer to /var/log/Xorg.0.log for details.\nWhen this happened just now, grep /var/log/Xorg.0.log -e EE gave me this:\n    (WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.\n[     3.936] Initializing built-in extension MIT-SCREEN-SAVER\n[     3.998] (EE) intel(0): [drm] Failed to open DRM device for pci:0000:00:02.0: No such file or directory\n[     3.998] (EE) intel(0): Failed to become DRM master.\n[     3.998] (EE) Screen(s) found, but none have a usable configuration.\n[     3.998] (EE) \n[     3.998] (EE) Please also check the log file at \"/var/log/Xorg.0.log\" for additional information.\n[     3.998] (EE)\n\nI login, and reboot.

Is it likely to be a bug somewhere, or is it due to an error of mine?\nUpdate:\nAs suggested in the linked-to bug report I tried restarting lightdm from the TTY terminal, and that got me a login working login screen. The bug report talks about this behavior being caused by a race condition at startup, so that not all required devices are available when lightdm starts (see e.g. comments #23 and #48). Most of them involve changing /etc/init/lightdm.conf in some way as to either prevent the race condition by stalling (e.g. sleep 2), or respawn if the first attempt crashes (and hope the second attempt is delayed enough to succeed). Is a workaround like that \"update safe\", or will it be overwritten when lightdm is updated? Is there a better way to work around (or even fix) this?\n\nA: This seems to be a problem with lightdm that starts before video device show up.\nPlease see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lightdm/+bug/969489 for workaround.\nOne of the workarounds, which works best for me, is to put\nrespawn\n\nafter\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nThis will force lightdm to restart until it works correctly.\nWorkarounds described in this bug report modifies /etc/init/lightdm.conf, so I would suggest to override this file during update of lightdm package just to be sure that it works with rest of lightdm correctly.

When I play a YouTube video, it does show.\n\nExample of what happens when YouTube video is playing\n\nA: here's a simpler way to fix it: sudo apt-get install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra. Source: Bug #991758\n\nA: I had this problem too. This is an old bug about Chromium: Issue 22152: <audio> tag doesn't work for extension resources. Anyway, I didn't understand how they fixed there (actually I have not bothered myself) - if they fixed (is written that it is fixed). Because of that I won't explain what is happening there.\nI fixed it by following the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install Google Chrome.\n\n*Replace /usr/lib/chromium-browser/libffmpegsumo.so file with /opt/google/chrome/libffmpegsumo.so (preventive, you can make a copy of the original file).\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Optional, uninstall Google Chrome if you don't need anymore or if you don't intend to use it in the future.\n\n*Open Chromium browser and check if you can hear sounds now, in Google Translations for example.\n\n\n\n\nI think, not sure, that this happens because many of the audio and video codecs included in Chrome aren't included in Chromium due to licensing, patents and stuff like this.\n\nA: No need for install, just download the package and extract, like:\nsudo dpkg -x google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb ./google\nsudo cp /usr/lib/chromium-browser/libffmpegsumo.so /usr/lib/chromium-browser/libffmpegsumo.so.backup\nsudo cp /home/YOURUSERNAME/Downloads/google/opt/google/chrome/libffmpegsumo.so /usr/lib/chromium-browser/libffmpegsumo.so\n\nOk, restart chromium.\n\nA: Follow this if you have downloaded chromium from Ubuntu Software.\nThe same problem will occur in this case also.\nTo fix this follow these steps.\n\n*\n\n*Go to Ubuntu Software > Installed > look for Chromium browser\n\nClick on Permission tab\n\n\n*Look at opened window\n\nEnable  Play audio\n", "Q: Does installing a KDE application under Ubuntu mean more CPU load and/or memory usage even when it's not running? The title says it all actually.\nThere might be one or two KDE apps that I might prefer to the Gnome alternative.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm not afraid of having to install many KDE packages (libs, etc.) which might take considerable amount of disk space.\n\n*I'm not afraid of having to use some additional packages (libs, etc.), probably meaning more CPU load and/or memory usage than its Gnome equivalent, when that application is running either.\n\n*But I'm afraid installing a KDE application might entail some KDE software constantly being loaded and running in the background every time Ubuntu starts, even when that application is not being used.\nSo, I will very much appreciate an answer from people who really know and who really have experience on this subject.\n\nA: Short answer: NO.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Unless you load a KDE application, libs will not be loaded, nothing will run.  \n\n*Even if you load KDE applications, the rest like Nepomuk won't run. So basically that means no extra load.  \n\n*Only kdelibs get loaded most of the time. No plasma, no plasmoids, no stuff like that.\n\n*If you start a KDE application AT startup, then the boot will be of course, longer. As Ubuntu will have to load the kdelibs just to run your application. (How longer? Depends on your storage speed.)  \n\n*There will be no overhead or CPU load increase because you run KDE apps. They will run just as fast as they would run under KDE. You might want to check \"systemsettings\" and \"qt4-qtconfig\" though, to set up a lightweight theme/disable animations, and so on.  \n\n*Loading up Kate gave me ~80MB more memory usage. Closing it dropped this to 40MB. Applying the manual drop cache gave back all the memory.  \n\n\nCorrrection:\nYou guys were right. Kdeinit4 indeed stays in memory.\nTo read about it, check man kdeinit4.  \nThere is a way to kill it to free up every last bit of memory.\nIt eats no CPU though. \nIdles with a ~40MB of memory usage. \n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu GRUB directly from Ubuntu I had windows 8 and Ubuntu side by side managed by Ubuntu GRUB menu.

Mac OSx and Xubuntu (newest release.)\nI have followed a lifehacker guide on allowing access of my OSx partition when booted into my linux OS which included changing the linux uID, and disabling Journaling on my HFS+ drive.\nI see my OSx partition when booted in linux in my file browser, but when I go into it deeper, I get 'Access Denied.' I see that, in OSx's disk utility, i have the option to disable encrypting, but when I hit it, nothing changes... Would that encryption be interfering?\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The problem isn't encryption, it's file permissions. IIRC, OS X gives its default user a user ID (UID) of 501, whereas in Ubuntu the first user's UID is 1000. Thus, the files on the disk appear to be owned by somebody other than you, which means you'll have no access to those files as anything but root.\nYou can change the UID of your OS X user or of your Linux user. For Linux, you can use usermod to do this, but you'll need root privileges, and this is a bit awkward given the way Ubuntu sets things up unless you've got two accounts with administrative privileges. Also, using a UID that's lower than 1000 will create some (mostly minor) complications. See this question on this site for more on this topic. I'm not sure how you'd change your OS X UID to 1000, offhand; perhaps a Web search or asking on an OS X site will help.\nI must question the wisdom of granting read/write access to your main OS X partition from Linux, though. This is asking for trouble, for three main reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Linux HFS+ driver, although pretty good, may have bugs that could cause data loss. If you run into such bugs, the mere act of mounting the OS X volume in Linux could trash all the data on that partition. I'd like to emphasize that I don't know that such bugs actually exist, but they might.\n\n*By disabling the journal on the HFS+ volume, you'll increase filesystem check times, which could slow down the boot process if OS X needs to run a filesystem check.\n\n*Linux doesn't include explicit safeguards against damaging OS X system files. Although ordinary file permissions should help, an accident as root in Linux could trash the OS X system.\n\n\nSimilar comments apply to accessing the Linux partition from OS X, too, although you might not need to disable a journal to do the job. (I haven't checked the latest status of OS X's Linux filesystem drivers on this score.)\nInstead of mounting your OS X root (/) partition in Linux with read-write access, it's probably better to create a separate data-exchange partition. If you don't need to exchange big (over-4GiB) files, FAT will handle this task quite well, and using FAT will bypass the UID issues that are the root cause of your problem. So will NTFS, but unless you're triple-booting with Windows, using NTFS is inadvisable because there are no good NTFS repair tools in OS X or Linux, so sooner or later an NTFS volume would become inaccessible. Thus, if FAT is inadequate, a separate HFS+ volume is probably best. You'd then need to either synchronize your UID values or set very permissive permissions on the directories you use in the file-exchange partition (including its root directory).\n", "Q: Why cant I load Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10. Every time i try burn onto disk or usb, it comes back with errors or missing files, i really want to use Ubuntu, but this keeps happening everytime, please help!!\n\nA: Sounds like a corrupted download. Do a md5sum check on the iso and make sure it matches the hashes here before using it.\n\nA: Try downloading the minimal Cd. It is approximately 35MB in size. It will download the missing packages after the core of Ubuntu is installed. The minimal CD can be found here. I don't know why your disks are missing files, but if it is occurring during the download or while burning the disks, a smaller iso will reduce the risk of it happening. Just a suggestion. However, when you go to install Ubuntu, make sure you have a good internet connect because it will download quite a bit.\n", "Q: Easy painless backup of server? I've recently started playing around with ubuntu server, trying out everything I can imagine.  Along the way I've made some mistakes, poor choices and installed some crap that ill never need.  \nMy plan, now that I half way know what I'm doing, is to start from scratch again, and only mess with the minimal settings/programs and have it as streamlined as it can be.  \nOnce I'm done, I'd like to make a backup of everything except a giant data hdd that isn't part of the small install disk (installed on sda, data on sdb) so that in the case the file system hdd fails, I can swap it out and recover and move on.\nWhat would be the most painless way to do this?\nAlso, if that did happen and I needed to recover, all I would need to do is remount the data hdd and it would work the same as before, right?\n\nA: Ubuntu comes with a built-in back-up system but I've had really good results using Clonezilla. \nClonezilla is a free and open-source utility that has the ability to create and restore image backups of your full hard-disk or partitions. It can be downloaded and run as a LiveCD which makes creating and restoring backups really easy - even when your OS is not functional, or completely missing - as would be the case when your hard-drive crashes.\n", "Q: How to use Virtual-Box / Unsuported USB Hardware / US144 in Ubuntu? Is it is possible to forward hardware, which Ubuntu doesnt support? \nIn my case I want to use a Tascam US-144 audio interface into a VM (which contains Windows) where the hardware can be recognized and used.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Yes.\nYou will need to install the closed source extension pack and add your user to the vboxusers group.\nI do it quite often to run programs protected by hardware keys that connect to usb machines. Linux doesn't support either the key or the machine (although the machine is probably using a simple usb-serial port emulation). It works nicely with a Windows XP host.\n", "Q: When will Eclipse Juno (4.2) be coming to Ubuntu? There are many web pages that describe how to install Eclipse Juno on various versions of Ubuntu, but I was wondering when it will be released properly in the default Ubuntu repositories? \nI notice that the new release of 13.04 is still at version 3.8. Is there a chance of it making it in to the 13.10 release?\n\nEDIT: As I state in my original question, there are may web pages that describe how to install Eclipse Juno, so please do not answer with an installation guide for 4.2.\n\n\nA: The main repositories of 13.04 are not likely to be upgraded to the latest release of Juno now that they're released, for reasons explained in Why don't the Ubuntu repositories have the latest versions of software? .  If the Eclipse team has a PPA with Eclipse Juno, then you can use that.\nOtherwise the latest Eclipse software will need to be downloaded and run manually.\nPerhaps it will be backported to 13.04 (or earlier), if the software is available in the next version of Ubuntu.  But only if someone can make sure it builds and runs correctly.\n\nA: Go to eclipse.org, download Juno, unzip it, go find the executable, run it. I personally prefer this method, so I can have various instances of eclipse with different plugin setups. They probably won't fix their repos.\n\nA: I have no trouble with the archive version. I usually install the repository version to make sure I have all the dependencies, then download and unpack the archive from eclipse.org, which I then just run from my home folder.\nIf anything, it's easier to update because you don't have to cope with the schizophrenia that results from the mid air collision of the Eclipse update mechanism (p2) and the Ubuntu package management.\n", "Q: install 13.04 or stay with 12.04 LTS? I've been excited about 13.04 since reading about the new features and new designs made in it. I tried using 12.10 but, in my opinion it is okay and feels a little sluggish to me. 13.04 is suppose to be faster and more stable then 12.10 so, I think I like 13.04 more. I'm only disappointed with Raring Ringtail's support for 9 months instead of 18 months. Would 13.04 support really end at January or will it last a little longer to use by then. Or is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS a wiser decision to choose?\n\nA: A good answer by Eliah Kagan is Should I wait for 13.04?\nBut staying with a release that will last 9 months (And taking into consideration that every 6 months a new version comes out) the question would be then if you want to stay on 13.04 forever or would like to do an upgrade once 13.10 or any newer version comes out (Note that this is only done once every 6 months).\nIf this is not the case I would suggest to sticking with the last LTS which was the 12.04 although if you are like me and wish to see a stable but more updated system, updating from one version to the next every 6 months is no big deal. At least as an end user. I even have a very slow connection (32KB/Seg) and don't mind downloading the ISO or upgrading my current version once every 6 months.\nSo which one to choose depends on if you want to be up to date, or want to stick with one that will receive updates for several years. I want to add that you will also receive updates with the other releases but doing the ugprade every 6 months will simply guarantee that you are up to date and receive additional updates for the timeframe of that release. Best of both worlds (Again, for end users that do not mind downloading the upgrades every 6 months).\n", "Q: If I create a Live usb bootable distro with persistence files, can I later use the usb to install to the hard drive?

The problem is that I can't get the Nexus 7 to mount on the laptop. I've tried different ports but they all lead to the same result. I've even tried connecting it as a camera, but then I wouldn't be able to access the whole device.\n\nA: I was facing the same problem a while a go. The solution I found was not to use the USB cable at all. Although you can eventually get the MTP configuration to sort of work, it remains buggy.\nIn the end I chose to transfer files over my local WIFI. Assuming you have both your laptop and your tablet connected to the same wireless network, all you need to do really is to share one or more folders on your laptop (right click, sharing options). Once that is done you need a file manager tool on your Nexus. I use the free version of File Manager HD (from Google Play). In this you select \"Network\" from the top row of options and enter the connection details. To avoid issues with server paths, using the IP adress of your laptop. Don't forget to enter username and password, it is saved in the connection info so you only have to do it once. Important to realize is that each shared folder requires a separate entry.\nHope this works for you\n", "Q: Error starting Firefox after latest updates this week, firefox will not start. When launching from terminal, it prints the following error three times before quitting:\n** (firefox:13010): WARNING **: Failed to open webapp application path dir /usr/local/share/unity-webapps/userscripts: Error opening directory '/usr/local/share/unity-webapps/userscripts': No such file or directory\n\nRunning Ubuntu 12.10 64bit\n\nA: It looks like Firefox can't find some files for the integration of Webapps into Unity. On my machine (Ubuntu 12.10 64 Bit as well), those scripts are located at /usr/share/unity-webapps/userscripts, your installation is looking for them at /usr/local/share/unity-webapps/userscripts. In other places I also read about paths like /usr/share/gnome/unity-webapps/userscripts. My assumption is that in the course of development those path has been changed, and your installation is not using the same version of the path in all places. \nThe package responsible for the integration is xul-ext-websites-integration. Maybe this package, for one reason or another, is not at the correct version in relation to your Firefox package and needs to be updated? The version on my machine is 2.3.5-0ubuntu1. It might help if you reinstall that package.\nAnother chance might be to uninstall that package. But it is a dependenceny of xul-ext-unity, so you would need to uninstall that, too, and you would probably loose all of Firefox' integration into Unity. So I would do that only as a last resort.\n", "Q: Why would I install a DNS server on my Ubuntu server? When you install Ubuntu server, the default Ubuntu server will only store the core system, but there is an option to add additional server roles. One of these is a \"DNS Server\".\nFrom what I read, when you add this choice to your installation, Ubuntu adds the bind9 and bind9-doc packages to your system. These packages provide the Bind 9 DNS server and its documentation. Now in fact a DNS server is simply a technology that takes a host name and automatically finds the IP address for that host on the Internet. Whenever you purchase a domain, for example, on Godaddy, you have the option on their website to point that hostname at your public IP address. It's that simple. So why would anyone need to set up a DNS server on their Ubuntu installation?\n\nA: This is a very open question, there are lots of reasons to run a local DNS server. I'll give you why we use it at work:\n\n\n*\n\n*As a cache to improve performance. Most of DNS queries are shared among lots of computers, if they are cached on our DNS server, clients don't need to connect to internet to resolve it, a much faster LAN connection will do it.\n\n*We want to name some computers that are only available in the LAN (i.e. on our network, you can't access then from the internet). Some of our servers can only be accessed from the internal network, we want our users to be able do it with a normal name using the same tools that they are used.\n\n*We give different IPs to some names: in a public (ISP) DNS our web server will resolve to our public (internet-facing) IP. When someone from the LAN ask our DNS to resolve its name we return our private IP.\n\n*To temporary ban some domain names, sometimes we need to ban for a couple of minutes some website, an easy way to do it is to change the IP it's pointing. As an example, a couple of months ago a virus was making lots of connections to a strange website. We changed it's name at the DNS forwarding it to a fake web server. Not only did we block it, we also get to quickly discover the infected machine by looking at the web server logs.\n\n\nA: Some people run a local DNS server on their LAN for samba, apache, and Kerberos so that users on the LAN can use hostnames similar to what you describe for godaddy. Sounds as if you have no need for a local DNS server.\n\nA: I actually also use GoDaddy, so I know what you're talking about.  \nHere is the process of what happens so that a computer elsewhere in the world is able to visit your IP address using your domain name:\n\n\n*\n\n*You update your DNS zone file in GoDaddy with your IP address.\n\n*The \"relation\" (between your IP address and domain name) is stored in the name servers you specified in your GoDaddy domain settings.  \n\n*These name servers then communicate with name servers all around the world to globally update this information so that people in Germany can type in your domain name and not be pointed to an old IP address still stored in their local name server.  \n\n\nOf course, they say that \"this takes time - 24-48 hours\" but I usually see it move much quicker than this.  American name servers will usually be updated with your new pointing information within like 10 minutes.  Here is an extremely useful and very cool site for monitoring how your domain name is updated on name servers around the world: https://www.whatsmydns.net/\nThe top practical reason an individual would want to set up a DNS server on their machine is because they have a dynamic IP address and want to automate the process of updating their name server with their IP address when it changes.  I am in the process of learning how to do this but I suspect I can find a way using curl icanhazip.com and checking it against a text file with the results of my last check.  \nHope I provided some clarity!\n-Pierre\n", "Q: What should i do with the upgrade?

Is that still the case? (I am currently not on Ubuntu, so I can't verify).\nThe searching that I have done have brought up results in threads where people have to do manual setup (editing of config files) to get their Wacom tablets working. Is that the case or is there good support for Wacom tablets (with graphical configuration) in Ubuntu?\n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but I think that the below information is relevant to those with the same question that mydoghasworms had a few years ago.\nWacom support is not really up to scratch in 15.04. Still, you can buy a Wacom tablet knowing that you can get it to work well, though it will take a bit of work. I use a combination of the Wacom Tablet settings in System Settings and xsetwacom to set the buttons on my Intuos4 and Intuos5 to things like hotkeys, modifier keys and toggles (even the ring toggle button works). I have not managed to get the LED displays to work, but I didn't try very hard and others seem to have managed it, and in my opinion, a tablet without those working can still be a killer tablet.\nThese links will provide very useful information:\nhttps://braindump.kargulus.de/?p=432\nhttps://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-control-center/issues/76\nThis one specifically for the correct numbers of the buttons in xsetwacom, that took me ages to figure out:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1380744&page=32\nPersonally, I think Ubuntu really has to put a lot more effort into the Wacom tablet setup and configuration tools, but still, get yourself a tablet, it is worth it!\nBy the way, KDE used to have even more customizability options, including the ability to easily switch between program specific button setups, so you could have a setup for Gimp, and another for Krita for instance. This was great, but those options seem to be gone or not working in Plasma 5.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Sorry but the Ubuntu Wacom Gui tool doesn't offer enough options to fully make use of the device, button (re)mapping e.g is not supported, and and you really want to disable/configure the weird touch behaviour and defaults of the device for working without annoyances, or for using it as a mouse replacement. \nI bought a Wacom Bamboo Fun Pen & Touch a few days ago hoping to get full support without googling around for days and getting dirty in the terminal and heavy text editing.. but exactly this is what you have to do, otherwise the device is almost unusable for any serious work. Take that in mind before paying the extra Wacom price compared to other brands. You have to get dirty with text editing anyway, it doesn't matter if you use Arch or Ubuntu, or if you buy a random UC Logic Tablet or Wacom one, to use the device like it should be used a similar amount of self effort is required, and this can put a lot of people off.\nIf Canonical want artists using other OS switching to Ubuntu, they NEED to make a proper GUI tool for those widespread devices, or artists will return to other operating systems immediately.\nIf you're comfortable with text editing/scripting, the options to configure the devices are great though. \n\nA: If you have read the medium wacom article and still confused, don’t worry.Here are easy steps to install wacom tablet in ubuntu\nOpen a terminal in ubuntu (control+alt+T) and run the following piece of code one by one\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:doctormo/wacom-plus\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nDownload the latest release of wacom from here.

I've never gotten the full features out of my Intuos Pro M (PTH-651) on my Ubuntu 14.04 laptop.\nI've managed to get everything to work except for the eraser on the pen and also toggling modes.  The LED's change when I press the center button, but it doesn't change the function of the device.  Considering how expensive these things are, it's pretty disappointing.\nTo me, the worst thing is that I've never been able to assign keys using the System Settings>Wacom Tablet GUI.  I bring up the menu to map keys, and nothing happens when I highlight a row and hold down a key.  So I had to go the hard route, making a script using xsetwacom to launch on bootup.\nI also created a launcher, because I found out that if the tablet isn't connected at boot, the script doesn't work.  This also applies if I disconnect or reconnect it at any time.\nHere's some helpful information for you guys on where to find the key mappings on your system and also a link on how to set things up manually should you need to do so.  It was the only thing that worked for me.\nThe mappings for all supported tablets can be found in the /usr/share/libwacom/ directory. \nThere are text files in the main directory that use a *.tablet extension naming convention. The buttons for the Intuos Pro are designated with alphabetical labels where A=Button 1, B=Button 2, etc.\nThe subdirectory located in /usr/share/libwacom/layouts/ contains vector image files that display a graphical depictions of the tablets and the button assignments. These *.svg files should be opened with Inkscape or another application capable of displaying scalable vector graphics files.\nHere's the link I found helpful in creating my script file:\nhttp://bartssolutions.blogspot.com/2015/02/how-to-configure-wacom-intuos-express.html\n\nA: Ubuntu has great Wacom support.  It's all plug and play but with great graphical configuration options.  You can configure pens and erasers and buttons for all common Wacom tablets.  I was even surprised to find that you can lock a tablet to a single monitor in a dual-monitor set-up.\n\nA: Wacom support in linux depends on several factora. As of today (5/11/2018) there are unsupported models in the market. I bought a One by Wacom (model CTL-472) and it is unsupported in ubuntu 18.04 because the kernel drive shipping with this distro release is not the latest one.\nMy advice: Stay away from last generation tablets unless you know for a fact that it works.\nI compiled the driver, but there are some problems that prevent the tablet from working. Let's hope the first bionic hwe fixes the problem.\n\nA: Support was very good in 12.10 but 13.04 is partly broken. There are work arounds see \nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2139480&page=2&s=773fbf70e6dc15398d100858f0c2ce2e\nand\nhttp://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=110408\nhopefully this will be fixed soon.\n", "Q: Do the features in new Ubuntu releases get backported to the LTS? I am thinking of installing either Ubuntu 12.04 (LTS) or waiting for 13.04 to be released.\nMy question is: Will all the updates that appear in the new release also be made available to the LTS release? In other words, will all the improvements to Unity, all the new features etc., be available to 12.04 as well? Or should I go for 13.04 if I want all the newest features?\n\nA: The LTS releases are expected to be very stable, suitable for offices, and \"mission critical systems\" like power plants. LTS gets all the \"Important Security Updates\" and any updates that fixes security issues. \nLTS can be also updated with newer kernels, but it won't happen on it's own.  \nTypically, 12.04 LTS won't get the newest Unity features from 12.10, 13.04 etc. nor will it get newer versions of applications, like OpenOffice, unless such a feature or a newer application fixes a security hole.\nHaving said that, there are ways to get some of these into the LTS using the backport repositories and PPAs. In my opinion it is not worth the trouble unless you have some special circumstances preventing you to use the latest.\nNormal releases on the other hand get the newest features and more recent applications like OpenOffice.    \nSee What's the difference between a Long Term Support Release and a Normal Release? for more details.\nTo help answer your question about which version you should choose, my advice is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are going to use Ubuntu as a home desktop and either\ndual-boot Windows or have another computer in case of emergencies,\nchoose the latest, say 13.04 in a few days when it is released.\nI usually wait 3-4 weeks to avoid the mad rush and the initial kinks\n(if any) to get sorted out with the first round of updates.\n\n*If this Ubuntu installation is going to be mission critical, such as\nyou will lose your livelihood (or lots of money) if this computer\ndoes not work well for a few hours/days, then choose the LTS.\n\n\nHope this helps\n\nA: For new versions of unity with 12.04, it's not too simple (link). But for most other packages you can install from a PPA and then get the new version (link).\n", "Q: Cannot ssh until pinging url If, after starting system (freshly installed Linux Mint 13), I try to run:\nssh mywebsite.com\n\nit hangs up with \"Connection timed out\". but when I open the browser and enter mywebsite.com there (or even run ping), ssh suddenly starts working. \nThe same happens with one program accessing it's api through https.

Additionally you have to update the bootloader after every kernel update that happened in the system which isn't at the top of the boot menu. (You update your bootloader with sudo update-grub and you can reinstall it with sudo  grub-install /dev/sdX where X is the drive to install your bootloader to (in most cases it's an 'a'))\n\n\nA: Grub will be fine...

I've tried both 'Unity2D' and '3D' on my present computer (Toshiba Satellite, ATI Mobility 4200 series GPU, can post lshw if it's critical to do so) and I've noted that 3D mode is a notable performance hit, to pretty much every aspect of the computer.\nUbuntu 13.04 is being lauded as being quite fast - but 'Unity2D' is being dropped, is it not? Do the performance increases which most people seem to be experiencing require Unity3D?\nBefore people recommend other desktops - I've tried them and I just don't care for them I'm afraid. I really like the Unity desktop, and while I guess I could adapt to something else I just strongly prefer this UX to the others, so before telling me to switch DEs I'd like to understand a little more about the nature of the performance improvements.\n\nA: Unity which follows 13.04 is way faster and more reliable with fewer bugs (causing it to crash and take a lot of resources), and as a cause of the performance-increase they dropped unity 2D.\nI am using 13.04 on my computer at home, and i could detect that it was way faster on an old Acer-Computer. Using unity 2D on 12.10 will be the same as using 3D on 13.04, i promise you.\nHope you got a view on what i meant. Stick with Unity if you would like to ;)\n\nA: --EDIT-- FWIW, the below no longer works. Apparently the ppa no longer exists?\nIt looks like Unity 2D is still available and maintained for now, though there are notes of that changing soon with Unity Next. Unity 2D appears to be not installed by default in 13.04, so you'll have to install it separately:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:unity-team/staging\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity-2d\n\nI've only noticed performance improvements in 13.04 during boot, which was REALLY FAST. On my new Acer Aspire One D270, 13.04 desktop performance is grueling (2-3 frames per second) with the new default 3D enabled Unity, so I would say that Unity3D does not necessarily achieve any performance improvements. Installing unity 2D seems to be the only way to fix the problem, since there don't appear to be hardware accelerated drivers yet for my Intel Atom N2600 chipset in 13.04.\nIt would be awesome if future Ubuntu installers would automatically check for the availability of good hardware acceleration drivers in the future, and gracefully fallback to Unity 2D (or next equivalent) if there aren't any.\n\nA: sorry for late answer but you could try maybe gnome-fallback works like a charm and it is so fast, if you don't care about the dashboard and pretty effects that is the solution which will very much satisfy you.\nIn terminal run\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\n\n\nA: Apparently one of \"the next big thing\" for Ubuntu is MIR, it's a new server for the GUI and people trying it are reporting huge improvements on both performances and battery life, about 1 more hour with great improvement on the responsiveness of the GUI.\nThe only problem is that MIR is scheduled for the next release of Ubuntu, 13.10, so for now it's just a development branch with limited and buggy support to some Intel GPUs.\nIn my opinion your best option for now is to install a lighter desktop such as LXDE or XFCE.\n", "Q: Why is gksu no longer installed by default? I have always recommended pressing ALT+F2 and typing for example gksu nautilus or gksudo nautilus both are equivalent; to run graphical programs with root privileges.  However, I have just installed raring on a test system and this no longer works.\ngksu and gksudo are not installed as part of a default raring install; though they are in the repositories. In 12.04 at least gksudo was just a symbolic link to gksu\nThe reasons I have always done this are because while it is often safe to use sudo under some circumstances it can cause problems with graphical applications because gksu has you running the program as root while with sudo you are running as yourself but with elevated privileges.\nThis can mean you inadvertently change the owner of critical system files.  This can cause problems.\nThis reasoning is explained better here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running Sudo Graphically -- psychocats\n\n*Root Sudo - Comunity Ubuntu documentation\n\n*What is the difference between “gksudo nautilus” and “sudo nautilus”? on AskUbuntu \nWhy was command removed from a fresh install and what should we be using instead?\n\nA: I just installed 13.04 : GKSU is already installed...\n\nA: After a long discussion on #ubuntu-devel I now understand the thinking.\ngksu can be installed on 13.04 with sudo apt-get install gksu and it will work.\nIf you decided to install gksu and are using the 64-bit version you'll need to run gksu-properties once to set the authentication to sudo.  There is no need to do this on 32-bit as it's set to sudo by default.\n\nHowever gksu is not recommended any more and it may be removed entirely from future issues of Ubuntu.  In general the development team would prefer us not to use GUI applications as root but to use sudo and the command line instead.\nIn the long term pkexec is preferred however it's not very easy to use at the moment.\npkexec allows an authorized user to execute PROGRAM as another user.

I'm pretty sure that when my battery gets too low, the laptop suspends itself, but when i plug it back in, it won't come on.  Actually, if I've been playing music or video, i can hear the sound, often glitching and skipping, but there is absolutely no response from the monitor.  The indicator lights come on, as if the computer is running, but no buttons work provoke a response, except when I hold the power button down for an extended time to shut the computer off.\nPlease help: almost everything else on the computer works perfectly.\nThanks guys.\n\nA: I had this same problem.

Hope this helps you as well.\n\nA: I found the Nouveau display driver to be the problem\nFix I did:\nGo into software & Updates (search for this app with the Ubuntu \"search your computer and online sources\" top left menu, Ubuntu icon). Then go to \"Additional Drivers\" tab. Switch from \"Using X.Org X server -Nouveau display driver...\" to Using NVIDIA binary Xorg driver.. 310 (proprietary tested/) version and apply.\nOn the next reboot it suspended fine and has been working great ever since\n\nA: I've had similar sounding issues with hibernate.

I can't even CTRL-ALT-F2 to get to another session.\nExactly the same thing happens with suspend.\nI had no problems hibernating with Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10 (although sometimes gnome-shell used to hang on resume, I could always CTRL-ALT-F2 to another session and kill -9 gnome-shell to recover)\nMy T61 is a little different to the original poster's, it has an Nvidia NV140m rather than intel graphics.

Due to how mirrors works, they can't be up to date all the time.\nIn the netherlands, as example, it's pretty bad:\nKernel.org http ftp rsync  1 Gbps  Last update unknown\nI hope it helps!\n\nA: Installation GD. \nsudo apt-get install php5-gd && sudo service apache2 restart\n\nSome time error in your php library.

Take a package like sqlite3:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/i386/libsqlite3-0/filelist\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/i386/libsqlite3-dev/filelist\nNote that the linker name (/usr/lib/libsqlite3.so) only appear in the -dev package. The same pattern holds true for almost all shared libraries. Why? Won't this confuse programs that tries to dynamically load sqlite3 using dlopen(\"libsqlite3.so\") when that file is missing unless you have the -dev variant?\n\nA: The libsqlite3.so file is only a symbolic link to the fully versioned library file name, libsqlite3.so.0.8.6. At runtime, the dynamic loader only knows about the fully versioned library. This is true for most shared libraries. There are some libraries which are not versioned, and only available as libnspr4.so for example. However, such libraries are also packaged correctly, as appropriate.\nPrograms should not be trying to dlopen the non-versioned link of the library. If they wish to do that, they should instead use the libsqlite3.so.0 filename, for example, which is installed in the binary library package, rather than the accompanying -dev package. This way the program will continue working if sqlite3 breaks API compatibility at some point, and there is a libsqlite3.so.1 instead. Using libsqlite3.so.0 would ensure the program would use the API of the library which it was written to work with.\n", "Q: Recovery Data from failed Raid Disk - NAS My Western Digital My World Book White Light NAS Drive stopped working.\nThis has a single 1TB Disk.\nAt first I started getting the following error:\nVolume Status -

Lets call it www.mysite.com.  It is an online store, and I am using Apache2, and the Magento Community 1.7 Platform.   I had an \"Under Construction\" page set in usr/var/www/ folder (while working on the site)  I also set a subdirectory in there called mystore.  I was doing all my work on the site in the subdirectory.  Now I would like make the website pull up, by just the url, without using the subdirectory (www.mysite.com/mystore/).

When you go to pull up the page from your browser, it still trys to redirect you to the www.mysite.com/mystore.  Can someone please let me know how to do this?\n\nA: Assuming you are working on Ubuntu with Apache...\nApache setup serves www.mysite.com from the directory /var/www/, you probably moved the mystore folder to /var/www and the path to folder now is /var/www/mystore which Apache cannot handle according to your needs and\nwill probably serve (according to its directives) at www.mysite.com/mystore.\nIn order to fix that you will have to edit the site location, that is to show Apache where to find the file you want to serve at www.mysite.com. Since you dont give further details,\ni assume that there is a configuration file for mysite located at /etc/apache/sites-available directory named either default,  default-ssl which are the configuration files coming with every Apache installation on Ubuntu or some other name you gave for site's configuration file.\nYou will have to edit the lines at this file accordingly.\nThe file may contain the following lines:\nDocumentRoot /var/www\n  <Directory /var/www/>\n[...]\n\nchange to:\nDocumentRoot /var/www/mystore\n<Directory /var/www/mystore/>\n\nsave the file and execute the following in order for Apache to load the new configuration:\nsudo service apache2 reload\nYou can find more information on how to configure Apache at Official Ubuntu Documentation -HTTPD - Apache2 Web Server section.\n", "Q: Ubuntu vs. Kubuntu vs. Xubuntu Is there a link or any side-by-side comparisons detailing why one would choose Kubuntu or Xubuntu over Ubuntu? I am running on a somewhat older machine (Dell optilplex 745 tower), so how would this figure into the decision?\n\nA: I don't have a link handy but the main differences are the following:\nUbuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Main distribution\n\n*Uses Unity as the desktop environment\n\n*Close to what people sees when people says \"Linux desktop\"\n\n\nKubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uses KDE as the desktop environment\n\n*Pretty-looking. I personally describe it as a Mac OS X/Windows hybrid, visually speaking.\n\n*Generally slower on lower end/older hardware\n\n*Might use more disk space.\n\n*Has the best MIME-Type association system/launcher, in my humble opinion. (kde-open)\n\n\nXubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uses XFCE as the desktop environment\n\n*XFCE is a fork of the old GNOME desktop, resembles GNOME 2 in appearance, aimed at being lightweight but still usable.\n\n*runs decently on lower end/old hardware\n\n*Not exactly \"super fast\", but better faster than GNOME/Unity/KDE\n\n\nThere's also Lubuntu and Fluxbuntu which are using different desktop environments, respectively LXDE and Fluxbox. Fluxbox would be the fastest and lightest, but not exactly user-friendly, especially if you come from another non-unix-line Operating System.\nOther distributions that are lighter and that might work better depending on how old and powerful this computer is, but I will let you do the research about those.\nAs noted in this answer's comments, LXDE is not actively developed anymore.\n", "Q: Can Microsoft Access files be edit in Ubuntu? I am planning on making a new system of 6 computers for an office and wanted to use Ubuntu as the main OS. \nIs there a program to either convert or be able to use those files so they can be used on Ubuntu?\n\nA: The best solution so far for accessing accdb files has been ucanaccess for LibreOffice 4.2\nhttp://ucanaccess.sourceforge.net/site.html\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded the latest version (was \"UCanAccess-2.0.5-bin.zip\"), and unzipped it to a  place where I will not delete the files.\n\n*Then in LibreOffice followed at:\nTools→Options→LibreOffice→Advanced→Classpaths\nI just added the archives and closed LibreOffice, just like documented on ucanaccess pages.\n\n*Opening first time requires bit typing. At jdbc: write ucanaccess:// and your mdb or accdb file path/filename.\n\n*Then at Driver Class field: net.ucanaccess.jdbc.UcanaccessDriver\n\n*Next give our name and possibly password, and then select where to save it. You are done.\n\n\nA: You should be able to move these files to Ubuntu, but a lot will depend on the the files and your skills. Like all projects, you should think carefully about what your future requirements will be.\nUsing LibreOffice to convert a Microsoft Office Access mdb file to an odb file\nYou said the files were \"way back on Windows XP\", so presumably they are mdb files. Access used mdb as the file format through Access 2003/Office XP. LibreOffice Base is able to convert these files to odb format, but doesn't have good instructions for this in the help and requires an additional package.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install mdbtools or run in a terminal: sudo apt-get --reinstall install mdbtools\n\n*Setup an odbc datasource. This is just a text file that tells LibreOffice how to open the file.\na. Create ~/.odbc.ini\nb. Contents:\n[DatabaseName]\nDescription = Old XP Invoices\nDriver = MDBTools\nDatabase = /path/to/accessfile.mdb\n\nNote: in the code above, replace \"DatabaseName\" and \"/path/to/accessfile\" by the actual (desired) name and path/filename combination, respectively.\n\n*Start Base. It will usually open to the open/import database wizard. You can also open the wizard from any other LibreOffice program through: File >> New >> Database.\na. Choose Connect to an existing database >> ODBC\n\nb. Browse to your datasource\n\nc. Click OK\nd. On the next two screens, you can Test the connection, then save the database with a new name, and open it for editing.\nLibreOffice is able to convert tables, forms, queries, and reports. It will not generally be able to convert any VBA modules.\nUsing Gnome mdb viewer\nInstall MDB Viewer [](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/MDB Viewer) or run in a terminal: sudo apt-get --reinstall install mdbtools-gmdb2\nMDB Viewer lets you view and export the tables, schema, forms, queries, macros, and modules.\n\nThese tools are especially useful if you have an mdb file, but no longer have a licensed copy of Access. \nOther options\nIf you were using Access 2007 on XP, you would need to first save the files in mdb format. There are currently no free tools available to convert or read accdb files.\nYou might also consider using Access to export the data as xml or csv files and then importing them into Base, MySql, or other freely available databases. Access and Base are good as quick methods to create front ends to data but can be limited as multi-user solutions. MySql and similar options allow you create a solution better suited for multi-users. You would then use Base to easily create a front end that can connect to MySql. \n\nA: Ubuntu use libreOffice as the default office software package. \nWith this software, you will be able to open/edit any file that have a Microsoft Office format, so you don't have to worry about a conversion (in must of the cases).\n\nNOTE: You may have format issues, like don't get the exactly same design. For example I draw a simple line in PowerPoint (MO), and then when I open it with Impress (LO) I saw an arrow.\n\nA: To convert a good alternative would be to convert them to CSV.\nYou first need to install mdbtools (Ubuntu, Debian):\nsudo apt install mdbtools\n\nTo export all the tables try this command:\nmdb-tables -d ',' database.mdb | xargs -L1 -d',' -I{} bash -c 'mdb-export database.mdb \"$1\" >\"$1\".csv' -- {}\n\n\nA: If you only want to view or export the contained data you also could use an online viewer/exporter like www.mdbopener.com . mdbopener.com is using the already mentioned mdbtools for .mdb files and the jackcess library (java) for .accdb files.\nDisclosure: I am the creator of www.mdbopener.com\n", "Q: Why can't Ubuntu access my Raspberry Pi across LAN? Okay, I recently got a Raspberry Pi, and I got it connected to my Wi-Fi - I enabled the SSH and installed Hiawatha, and I could access it just fine from my Desktop, which was running Puppy Linux at that time.\nI could also access it just fine when booted into Windows (PuTTY on Win XP Pro,) and the Netbook could access it via PuTTY, as well. (Win 7 Starter)\nHowever, when I booted into Ubuntu, all SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS connections were refused. To confirm that it was Ubuntu, and only Ubuntu, that was having the connection issues, I rebooted into Puppy Linux - connected fine, and into Windows - connected fine. The Netbook could connect to all 3 services without issues either. It was just Ubuntu that said connection refused.\nI'd like to know what's wrong - I've already done all the basic troubleshooting: rebooting the RPi, rebooting my computer, rebooting the wireless router, etc. The Raspberry Pi has no Firewall enabled, and my Router offers all devices connected to LAN unrestricted access to each other. I've done extensive testing, and Ubuntu has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to be the only one not willing to connect.\nUPDATE: Just tested accessing via my external IP, and everything runs smoothly on Ubuntu! However, Ubuntu still can't access the Pi from anything local, and I just re-confirmed that my other OS's can. I think it's weird that Ubuntu has trouble connecting locally (unlike my other OS's,) but is just fine accessing the Pi via my external IP..\nUPDATE 2: Disabling my firewall lets me access the device, but the password reports as incorrect every. single. time. I've tried typing it into Gedit, then dragging-and-dropping it into the password prompt during SSH login, and it authorizes when accessing pi@jamestheawesomedude.cu.cc, but NOT when accessing pi@192.168.2.128. This is unbelievably frustrating.\n\nA: So until you had ufw enabled with default settings on your Ubuntu machine the connection always reported Connection refused. After you disabled the ufw on you client the connection is established but the password is always rejected?\nI would guess in that case your problem is that the 192.168.2.128 ip is routed back to your client Ubuntu machine, and actually you are connecting to the ssh server running on your Ubuntu machine. This would explain:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why you are able to connect from the internet.\n\n*Why your connection was rejected when the firewall was on on your Ubuntu client.\n\n*Why the connection is no more rejected with the client firewall turned off.\n\n*Why now the connection is established, but the authentication fail.\nTo troubleshoot this case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the server's host key with ssh -v pi@192.168.2.128 both for a local and for an internet connection. Does it report the same key? \n\n*Or while you are connecting from local, and you are at the prompt to type your password, from another terminal: sudo netstat -tupan and see if a connection is established to the sshd on your Ubuntu.\nAlthough this case would explain everything, but it is so weird that I have doubts that this is your problem. \n\nA: It's entirely possible that your ubuntu machine is getting a different network IP address than what is expected. Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the raspi, check its IP address with ifconfig | grep 192.168\n\n*on the ubuntu machine, check its IP address with ifconfig | grep 192.168\nIn order to be able to talk to each other on your local network, they should both be using the same subnet - look at the third section of the IP address to see if they are. In your case, they should both be on the 192.168.2.* subnet. \nMake sure they actually have different IP addresses too. This may seem obvious, but can happen if one of them is using DHCP and the other is set statically.\nIf that all checks out, then run the following command to see where your packets are supposed to be going:\nroute -n\nLook in the output for the destination subnet that applies to your raspberry pi. There should really just be 3 rows:\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n0.0.0.0         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0\n169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 eth0\n192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     1      0        0 eth0\n\nIf you have more rows or things are going to weird spots, then that's the answer. \nMy guess is that your ssh connection is ending up hitting a different SSH server from the one on your raspberry pi, which is why changing the ubuntu firewall affected it and your logins aren't working. \n\nA: According to what's in your PasteBin, the \"connection refused\" indicates you're getting a TCP reset from whatever is at that IP address.\nSanity check: While troubleshooting, DISABLE ufw.\nWith your desktop firewall disabled, can you ping the Pi from your desktop?  Can you ping the desktop from your Pi?\nAfter attempting the ping in both directions, look at the output of 'arp -n' on both machines.  Do they see each other's MAC (Ethernet hardware) addresses or is something redirecting/intercepting the traffic?\nIf you can ping in both directions and 'arp -n' indicates the proper MAC addresses are being used (check 'ifconfig' on the opposite machine), the next step is to examine /var/log/auth.log on the Pi.  It should tell you what's wrong with the connection attempt.\nIf the above doesn't help, please show us the output from the following commands on the Pi:\nsudo ifconfig -a\ncat /etc/resolv.conf\narp -n\nnetstat -rn\nsudo iptables-save\nsudo grep ssh /var/log/auth.log | tail -50\n\nAnd on your desktop:\nsudo ifconfig -a\ncat /etc/resolv.conf\narp -n\nnetstat -rn\nsudo iptables-save\n\nI see some of this pasted in the comments above, but the whole thing is important to grab with the firewall off, first.  If you can make it work with the firewall off, then you can proceed to troubleshooting your firewall rules.\nAlso, even if you're targeting an IP address, DNS settings still matter because SSH uses DNS during host key validation.\n\nA: Delete ~/.ssh/known_hosts file and try again.\nIf previously there was a host with the same IP address ssh accessible, you may keep an invalid fingerprint\n\nA: On Ubuntu 13.10 , I could not ssh to my pi , when I previously could on 13.04 and Mint 16.\nWhen trying\nssh -vvv user@host\n\nI got :\ndebug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY\n\nI ran across a suggestion that said to set MTU for the Machine(not the pi) to 1200 instead of automatic. I did this, turned off -> then on my wifi , and connected with ssh to PI on first try. \nHope this helps someone.\n", "Q: Can XAMPP be used for a \"real\" server? According to the Wikipedia article, XAMPP is merely a packaging of server software such as apache, PHP, SQL, etc, that can be run locally.\nThe question becomes: is it practical to use the same software on an actual server, but set a config file to automatically run /opt/lampp/lampp start on startup? Or is it better to just get the software and directly install it?\nNot too savvy with networking, particularly on the server side, so any answers would be a great help.\nThanks!\n\nA: XAMPP works great on Windows. Heck, even for Linux, as it provides a consistent \"packed\" experience. Comes with everything, without the need to set up anything. Great for dev purpose, I suppose.  \nBut on Ubuntu you can install LAMP pretty easily, and it's the \"same thing\", really.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP \n(Except you have to keep Lampp up-to-date by yourself, and Ubuntu provides patches / updates for their own LAMP stack.)  \nShort version: Stick to the Ubuntu LAMP.\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu on chromebook, Ubuntu asks for password that wasn't ever set I installed ubuntu 12.04 on my chromebook.\nIt didn't asked me for a password at first, but when I attempted to install a software from the store it's asking me for a password which I never set.  \nAs in chromebook, it doesn't have a normal BIOS to reset the password, Please tell me how can I reset the password or if there is any other way.\n\nA: The password is user\nI did the same to my Chromebook.\n", "Q: Failing with shell script I am trying to run the following script in Ubuntu 10.04 but hitting with different issues for the intget i declaration.

However, when I used that approach it actually created 5 partitions, and only the root partition looks familiar:\n/dev/sdb5       227G   21G  194G  10% /\nudev            1.5G  4.0K  1.5G   1% /dev\ntmpfs           606M  844K  606M   1% /run\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            1.5G  152K  1.5G   1% /run/shm\n\nwhat is udev, tmpfs, /run/lock/ and /run/shm?\nWhat's even more interesting about this situation is that the guided partition didn't even allow me to select the partition to use. It just ended up using (wrongfully) my storage sdb drive rather than using my sda ext4 partition of my sda drive.  \n\nA: The documentation that you have read is correct. Ubuntu by default will create 2 partitions. One is root (/) and the other is a separate partition for swap space. \nThose that you are looking at the result of (I assume) mount command , are partitions inside root partition. This command mount is not showing a list of the created partitions but the mounted partitions at current time instead.\nSee man mount for more info and use the sudo parted -l to list your actual created partitions. \nAs for the mistake about the partitioning I will try to guess the situation you might faced ,because the info that you gave are incomplete.\nMaybe If you had already 4 primary partitions (on MBR) you couldn't create more , because 4 is a limit of primary partitions on MBR. \nWhat is MBR ? I will quote a \"beautiful\" short but comprehensive answer from ubuntuforums.org\n\nMBR or master boot record is what we have been using to boot PC's\n  since the introduction of the IBM pc. We have 4 partitions, but it was\n  modified to allow converting one to an extended partition so we could\n  add more logical partitions. It also has a maximum of 2TB and since\n  they are now selling 2TB drives the next generation of drives will not\n  use MBR.\nGPT is a newer partitioning scheme used by Apple and some Windows\n  servers.

They will change to 13.04 once the final release arrives. I would also recommend making sure all repositories are activated in the Software & Updates app (Found in Dash):\n\n\nNOTE - Since this is a development version, you will sometimes get when doing an update an error. Maybe it will say \"Bad checksum\", maybe \"Repository not available\" or maybe other errors related to repositories. Do not worry about this.

I just let the wizard set it up as a 2170w and it works fine for me. Don't uninstall the driver you have already added, just add a new printer and let Ubuntu pick the driver for you, print to it, and if it works you can just change the default printer to that one. That way if it works, great, if it dosen't, no loss.\n\nA: I have a Brother HL-2270DW and I solved installing it as \"Generic PCL Laser Printer\", however a workaround (not so convenient in my opinion) for the Brother original driver is to print your document as .ps file and then print that file.\nThis issue is related to CUPS 1.6.x introduced with Ubuntu 12.10, because with Ubuntu 12.04 the printing margins are OK.\n\nA: In the print dialog:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the \"Advanced\" tab \n\n*Set \"Page Margins/Offsets\" to \"Driver Default\"\n\n", "Q: How can I remove a group and its' users?

I've installed Ubuntu via Wubi, and I want to install other distros/desktop enviroments, like KDE, XFCE, etc. Based on WubiGuide:\n\nYou can install your favorite distro from within Wubi (see the advanced settings) and then once you are in Ubuntu, you can install the other desktop environments as normal packages. Each desktop environment is available as a single package (e.g. kubuntu-desktop). You will not have to reboot to change the desktop, simply log-off and choose the desktop environment in the options at login.\n\nI didn't get meaning of that, so what should I do in order to install multiple distros on Ubuntu?\n\nA: The different Ubuntu flavours just install different packages per default.

It's probably not the client sending rubbish along as I previously said in my comment, rather that it's the server doing weird stuff for an unknown reason.\nMany people have documented that fixing this involves disabling the <Super>d binding for showing the desktop but this fix has had to evolve over the years as Ubuntu has upgraded components. There are a few basic options for doing the same thing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into the shortcuts setting screen, find the shortcut and click it until it says disabled.\n\n*Nuke with Gconf (probably only works on older Ubuntu desktops) and log out and in again.\n\n*Manually edit the gconf XML (again, might only work on older desktops)\n\n*Install CCSM to get to the newer version of the settings.\n\n\nOther people report other similar quirks with XRDP so if you're experiencing other issues (and/or you can't fix this one), it might be best to dump it and go with something else. There are a fair few to choose from but the main contenders are VNC (over SSH from Ubuntu, or over SSH from Windows with Putty) or FreeNX.\nFreeNX is a lot less popular than VNC but it's a solid contender and a lot more like RDP than VNC (which can occasionally be a bit flabby if you're doing lots of graphics stuff).

I'm using Ubuntu/Samba and I seek for an explanation how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*put password protection access to computer, not on single directories\n\n*list all directories that I share, and not search them manually\n\n\nI always put directories to permit guests, because when I don't do that when I try access it says invalid permissions. I can't even use my root/user password combination to access. \n\nA: After not being too lazy, I found what I needed. These are probably basic things for advanced users:\n\n\n*\n\n*I couldn't access protected shares with my root username/password because I didn't add that user to samba system (it seems that it doesn't take automatically ubuntu users, and its user/pass system exists by its own which is a good thing). To add a user just use smbpasswd -a [USERNAME] and then type the new password. \n\n*For listing all local shares and their paths just access /var/lib/samba/usershares folder and there you have all configuration files for every single shared directory. Inside the file you have fields path (with the path to your local directory) and guest_ok (y/n type to permit guests) which you can edit manually.\nI will not lock this topic yet, waiting for improvements from other users (if there's anyone who will read this). I just wrote this answer to help some other lost noob like me ;) \n\nA: Also, you can type testparm to make sure your syntax is correct in smb.conf ... plus it'll show you all the shares you have in there.\n", "Q: Can't connect to the internet I am able to connect to my wireless connection without any problems, but when I open Firefox it says \"server not found\".

So, it isn't for sure that you are on the world wide web only by connecting to router? So, firefox tells you that he tried to connect to the internet, and he failed because he didn't find any \"servers\" to connect to.

Since Ubuntu 12.10 Gimp is upgraded and requires me to save via a \"save for web\"-dialog. I have several issues with this dialog and consider it a severe regression:\n\n\n*\n\n*It does not open the location-dialog in the folder where the \"current image\" lives. Requiring deep clicking.\n\n*When chaning some details in the image, re-saving it as PNG or JPG requires me to go through all the steps instead of hitting a shortcut [ctrl]-[s].\n\n*When opening a JPG, gimp forces me to save the image as xcf; probably so it can retain information; which makes little sense, because the JPG it opened is already lossy (lost information).\n\n\nIs there a (hidden) setting to revert to the previous situation or to tweak the current one?\nAm I doing something wrong? I can hardly beleive that one of the most important usages of Gimp (preparing images for web) has such a severe lack of detailed finishing.\nIs there a bug- or issue in the Gimp issuetracker that I am not aware of, which deals with these issues?\n\nA: For my workflow here the definitely fastest way to safe an edited file back to the path it resides is using the \"File -> Overwrite xxx\" menu which appears after an existing file was edited:\n\nTo further speed things up we can also define a key shortcut for file-overwrite which, after removing the shortcut for file-save could also be  Ctrl  +  S :\n\n\nA: Gimp is freeware software made for linux, and the deep clicking you are mentioning, thats a common problem, because it returns you to the home folder, or any other folder you used last session. Thats a bug i think should be reported to the developers of gimp.\nctrl+s is to save it as a Gimp-project. When saving it as an image, you should export it, using ctrl+shift+E instead. Then you select what kind of image type you want, JPEG, PNG, BMP or what else on the list.\nWhen openening a JPG-file, you open it in gimp as a project, and projects are by default as .xcf. Again, when doing small changes, you need to export it into a JPEG - like in photoshop. ctrl+shift+E, and overwrite your old image. \nA smart thing could be to save the project with ctrl+s if you need to edit it, and then export it. Then you can edit texts and other things on the image by opening the project file, and then exporting it again, overwriting the old or making a new copy.\n", "Q: Flashing Screen I have just installed 12.10.\nProblem is the screen keeps flashing.

It stop with the message: Checking filesystem\nBefore that, I got also a message, that the system can't unmount the /cdrom (which the ultrabook doesn't have!)\nThank you very much for help!\n\nA: I had the same problem. It seems theres some strangeness going on.  The way I managed it eventually was.. to wipe windows. Then install Ubuntu .. from external flash disk, (not from an external hard drive)\nYou need to umount the cdrom before attempting install once in live. Then partition your drive and make sure grub is set to the right device, then install.\nIf you have configured all the right hard drive partitions, it should install ok.  Then.. once you try to login, it may give you the 'GRUB' error.. which only lists the memtest.. \nI think this may have happened because I tried mulitiple installs, there are two ways to fix this .. one .. which I did not bother with because of slow internet in my country.. was to download a grub fix iso for ubuntu.. the second was to .. 'repair' the installation.. with a fresh ubuntu install.. which took a while ...\nThen  it booted into the glorious Ubuntu logon screen (startup takes like 5 seconds or less) very beautiful slick unity interface which I have gotten used to.  The only prob is that it munches battery fast.. and not all the battery features are there. (some battery issues). \nAlso, alsa works better with progs like skype for sound (otherwise scratchy) need to configure SSD. In your case you may be able to do a side by side with windows.  \n\nA: Is it a 530U3C? The answer or \"workaround\" for this model provided in several forums and websites is to install Ubuntu with Compatibility Support Module (CSM). You \"just\" have to disable fast boot and secure boot and make sure to boot from CSM (or legacy) only.\nAnd you have to blacklist the samsung-laptop hardware driver [1]. The problem is that it is not possible to boot both OS. If you want to run Ubuntu in CSM you have to format your HDD. So actually there is no choice.\nNevertheless, it is safer to not install any other OS on the above mentioned machine until the bug is officially fixed by Samsung.\n[1] This info is by Greg Kroah-Hartman.

When you press only the the Fn key, this doesn't send any data to the computer.\nAccording with this post, in general there is no way to know that Fn was pressed and the keycode of key-combinations including Fn depends on the individual keyboard design.  \nSo unfortunately, you can't bind it to another key.\nMore about: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fn_key.\n", "Q: How to encrypt full disk after installing? I found that we can encrypt full disk with old version of Ubuntu. I want to do the same with Ubuntu 12.10 but I don't understand the scripts that run when starting with initramfs. So anyone is ever did it?\n\nA: The process of encryption is destructive to your data as you \"should\" first write random data to the disk, which will over write your data.\nIMO the best way to use LUKS (full encryption) is to back up your data re-install.\nIn terms of the initramfs, it is a set of commands that run in busybox (a minimal shell) to initialize your hardware, peform LVM or manage LUKS, and load the kernel. These days distros build an initramfs for you so you do not need to manually edit the initramfs at all.\nIf you want to look at the internals, see http://blog.bodhizazen.com/linux/initramfs/\nIf you want to look at how Ubuntu generates an initramfs, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Initramfs\nIf you have a specific question about a specific step ask a more detailed question.\nThere are several tools to encrypt data post install, everything from an encrytped home (ecryptfs) to gpg.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedHome\nand for post install see http://www.howtogeek.com/116032/how-to-encrypt-your-home-folder-after-installing-ubuntu/\nand http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/06/migrating-to-encrypted-home-directory.html\n", "Q: ListView doesn't appear I'm working at app for ubuntu touch.

This might be a lot faster than just deleting the array.\nAs to how to delete it, there are lots of options. E.g:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get install wipe. sudo wipe /dev/sdX (make sure you specify the right drive!).\n\n*mke2fs /dev/sdX (or mke3fs, mke4fs, mkbfs, ... anything which formats will do).\n\n*dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M. (write lots of zeros all over the disk).\n\n\nThe fastest and most secure method however would be to ask the disk to wipe itself. Either by using hdparms to send the drive the secure erase command, or by booting DBAN.\nIn all cases: Make sure you specify the right drives!\n", "Q: Getting MSI GT70 GT60 ONC LEDs on SteelSeries keyboard working?

Not sure whether this would be more appropriate in a Centos forum, but I'll post it here for starters as I am more comfortable and familiar with Ubuntu. I recently purchased a server with Centos 6.3 already on it. I want to copy some files from my Ubuntu Server 12.04 drive as an external USB drive. It immediately comes up as a drive in Centos, but it only shows a GRUB folder, a Lost+Found folder, and a few other files. I had LVM set up on it, but I don't see any of that.\nAny suggestions? I'd like to avoid copying over the network.\nThanks!\n\nA: It is much more a CentOS problem - to access a partition that is part of a LVM setup the receiving system must have LVM installed (about which I can't tell you anything).\nFrom here the steps are the same on every system:\nYou can see what is there with sudo pvdisplay (to see physical volumes), sudo vgdisplay (for volume groups) and sudo lvdisplay for logical volumes -- all three for checking only.\nYou then must activate all LVs with sudo vgchange -a and will now be able to mount any LV you want.\n", "Q: Why am I unable start the Deluge daemon from connection manager?

I'm wondering why  Shift + Arrow Key result in one of the A, B, C or D letters.\nWhy not other letters? Why any letter at all?\n\nA: Terminal emulators such as gnome-terminal (\"Terminal\" in Ubuntu) but also xterm and urxvt are named \"emulators\" because they reproduce the behavior of older terminals which were the only display of a computer. Such terminals communicated with the computer with a text-based protocol and were initially designed to receive only text. Quickly, more control was needed: how to erase a line? Use colors? Or change the cursor position? \n\nSource: The Art of Unix Usability - Command-Line Interfaces\nEscape sequences were designed for every terminal to do such things. They are named escape because they start with the ASCII escape code: 33. There's no way to print such a character directly, which makes it a good fit for such sequences. When we still want to display this characted, ^[[ is used, and this is what I'll use in my explanations.\nWhen the terminal received ^[[A, it did not mean \"print ^[[A\", but \"the user pressed the up-arrow key\". \"A\" here is totally arbitrary: it just happens to be the letter everybody agreed on, because that's what the DEC VT-52 and its successor the popular VT-100 terminal used.\n\nSource: DEC VT-52 Maintenance Manual 1976\nThis is still the way terminal emulators work today: depending on the $TERM variable, a database named terminfo is responsible for saying what codes should be sent to the shell (bash, sh, zsh...), which is then responsible for understanding them and react to them.\nNow, the code for Shift + up happens to be ^[[1;2A: the terminal emulator sends this code to the shell, which tries to interpret ^[[1;2 but does not display anything because it doesn't know about that escape sequence. But A is left and displayed.\n", "Q: kde profiles for home, work movie watching etc Is there a way to configure different KDE config modes for different profiles?\nwhen i am watching a movie i don't want to see a screen saver or lock screen, but when working at my PC i want to start a screen saver after 15 minutes. \nAlso display dimming and similar settings are different.\nI don't want to create several users.\n\nA: Activities\nThe KDE is having the Activities: http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma -> http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma#Activities\nYou could use the Activities as the profiles.\nExample\nMake the Activities for the home, work, movie watching...\n\nSet the activity power management settings...\n\n", "Q: why doesn't mysql create the pid? mysql starts fine, everything is working as expected, but there is no pid file where my.cnf says it should be, the .sock is there\nthis is the relevant section of my.cnf\n[mysqld]\nuser            = mysql\npid-file        = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid\nsocket          = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock\n\nbut\n/var/run/mysqld# ls\nmysqld.sock\n\nps aux...\nps aux | grep mysql\nmysql    23990  0.1  4.4 887340 75904 ?

Per the Ubuntu site: \n\n\n*\n\n*I've installed the Pendrive Universal USB Installer.  \n\n*I had it download the ISO file ubuntu-12.10-desktop-i386.iso.  \n\n\nBut when it completes and I try to boot it up on the laptop, I'm getting the error:\nNo DEFAULT or UI configuration directive found!\n\nI've read the info about renaming the isolinux files to syslinux but, that has not been helpful.  The syslinux folder already exists.  However, it appears that it's not being extracted correctly.  All the file names (within the syslinux folder) seem to be random bits of words. See below:\n\nIf I use 7-zip to manually extract the ISO file, the isolinux folder is there but, not the syslinux folder.  The correct files appear to be in this folder.

If you can burn the iso to a CD/DVD then you will be able to install that way immediately.  Or you have the option to \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" from the CD/DVD and easily create a Ubuntu Live bootable USB flash drive to install from.\n\nTo install the CD/DVD you can follow these instructions: \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-desktop-latest\n\nTo install the USB drive: \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu \nor something a little fancier: \nLive USB on a 2-partition usb-drive\n\nAs for your issues installing, the tutorial is very clear.  I would recommend clearing the USB flash drive by deleting all files from or reformatting first, to give it a fresh do-over.  To better assist with that particular problem, a more descriptive description would help.

Using VLC 1.1.12 on Ubuntu 11.10, I'd like to show subtitles under the video so that they don't disturb me.\nI tried to change it: Interface > Preferences > Subtitles & OSD > Force subtitle position > -110 px (I also tried with other values)\nbut nothing changed (well, if I set +100px the subtitles are shown in a higher position).\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: This is a complementary answer to the main one.\nDepending on the aspect ratio, a video image may have or may not have a black space under the video. \nConsidering the linked answer: \n\n\n*\n\n*when the picture has a black space below it, it also has a black space above it, and so the picture is not squeezed, but moved upwards, while the above space is diminished (notice that in the images below).  In this way, the video is the one moved and pushed above the subtitles, not just the subtitles under the video.\n\n\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nI am using VLC 2.2 and to get this effect I made some settings that are somehow different from the ones in the other answer:\n\n\n\n*when the aspect ratio is such that it does not leave space under and below the image you cannot add subtitles outside the image without shrinking it somehow. But in such a case it doesn't make much sense to display the subtitles under the picture.  It is enough to have them as low as possible.\n\n\nThe problem with the settings proposed in the other answer is that VLC keeps them even when that is not the most preferable option, and the video image is 'shrunk'.\nIn such a case, when the initial image is this:\n\nThose settings will lead to this:\n\n\nWhen I need subtitles under picture I find it much easier just to open the video in a different player like bomi player, which can easily activate and deactivate the needed setting.\nJust right-click on the image:\n\nAnd you get this:\n\nWhen playing a video at an aspect ratio that fills the entire screen, bomi displays the subs on the picture with or without the 'letterbox' option.\n\nAs an alternative to bomi player I lately am using mpv which displays by default subtitles under video image when needed.\n\nA: You probably want to display subtitles below the picture on the black surface?\nBy default you can only position subtitles inside the picture. That is why when you were experimenting you could not place the subtitles below the picture.\nBut still there is a way to do what you want using Cropadd video filter.\n\nHow to show subtitles under the video in VLC\n1) Go to Tools > Preferences and below on the left, in the\n    \"Show Settings\" section, choose \"All \":\n\n2) In the left menu choose Video > Filters > Cropadd :\n\n3) In the \"Padd \" section enter some positive number for the \"Pixels to\n    padd to buttom \" option. For this example I used 75px, you are free to experiment.\nNOTE\nAs was noticed in the comments, with the current settings (75px) there is a tiny green line below the video. The solution for getting rid of that tiny green line is simple: enter some even number (for example 76) and there will be no green line below the video. Thanks for this tip to some anonymous user and the community moderator Grace Note who passed this tip in the comments below. \n\n4) Then, again in the left menu, go to Video > Filters and in the\n    \"Video filter module \" section check the \"Video scaling filter \"\n    option. The result must be that in the text field below the current\n    section there will be written \"croppadd \".\nNB!\nThere are two \"Video scaling filter \" options to choose from: one in the left and one in the right column. On of them is for another filter - \"Swscale\". Choose the one, that will give you the word \"croppadd\" written in the text field below (see the picture):\n\n5) Click \"Save \" button:\n\n6) Now, for the changes to take effect, you must restart VLC (close it and run again)\nThat's it.\nThis way you can customize the position of subtitles so they will be shown outside the picture .\n\nShowcase\nDISCLAIMER:\nThe following screenshots are taken using videos from the Stanford University's learning course\n\"Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1\".\nNOTE: this course has already transformed into \"Algorithms Specialization\n\" as of year 2019.\nBEFORE:\n\nAFTER:\n\n\nUseful tips\n\n\n*\n\n*It is very helpful to assign the related Hotkeys to manipulate\nsubtitles position in real time.\nGo to Tools > Preferences > Hotkeys and assign some hotkey\ncombination for the\n\"Subtitle position up \" and \"Subtitle position\ndown\".

So now I can dynamically adjust the position of subtitles by moving them up or down while watching a video.  \n\n*There are more customization options in the \"Subtitles/OSD \"\nsection in Preferences, like changing Font, Font size etc, so\nyou can fine tune the subtitles settings according to your needs.\n\n\n\nUPDATE (May 2015)\nAs user akcasoy noted in his comment in the latest (as of May 2015) version 2.2.1 of VLC, the name of the required filter was changed from \"Video scaling filter\" to \"Video cropping filter\" (which is actually much more intuitive and relevant).\nSo here a screenshot for the step 4 if you use the currently latest VLC version 2.2.1:\n\n", "Q: How do I remove this annoyingly pixelated popup? How do I remove this annoyingly pixelated popup? It looks like the gnome3 popup for volume, however it only pops up when i use my laptops multimedia keys, not the volume or brightness keys. I can't figure out if it's a certain package (Which would be difficult considering unity also runs on gnome elements) anyone got an idea? Here is an image\n\n\nA: I've solved my own problem, I don't know how it worked, but I reinstalled ubuntu-desktop (This really isn't recommended because some extra packages were left missing for me to redownload myself) with\nsudo apt-get --purge remove ubuntu-desktop*\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop unity-webapps-common\n\nand rebooted.\n(As noted in the comments this is NOT recommended)\n", "Q: Rhythmbox keeps repeating same song after play queue is empty I'm not sure if this is a bug, but whenever Rhythmbox is finished playing all the songs in my play queue it immediately jumps to first song in my music library and keeps playing it over and over.\nI don't have shuffle or repeat enabled.\nIts just plain weird.  Any idea how to make it stop?\nI'm using ubuntu 12.10\n\nA: I've been getting the same problem since I ticked the \"View Queue as Side Pane\" option.\nBasically, if I start playing music when the Music Library screen is visible then the first song in the music library will be played when the queue is finished.\nTry unticking the \"View Queue as Side Pane\" option (if it's ticked), add music to the queue, then switch to the Play Queue screen and hit play from there.\nIt's a bit annoying to keep flicking between the Music and Play Queue screens but that works for me.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu, on a Windows 8 laptop, without a CD. Can it be done? And what is the normal time for download? I have a Aspire laptop, Windows 8 pre-installed with 8 GB of ram. I have tried to download via thumb drive but it won't download. So I wanted to know there were any other ways to download it without a CD. Is it normal for a download to be longer than 4 hours?(That's with bios) \n\nA: Update:\nIt is possible that windows 8 will not allow you to install Ubuntu by LiveCD/USB or Wubi. This is because Windows 8 introduced several new features, of which 2 are:\nUEFI which substitutes what we have known as the BIOS (Is an alternative to)\nSecure Boot which prevents anything but the installed operating system, in this case Windows 8 from booting.\nSee this article for installing Ubuntu on Windows 8.\nGenerally Speaking, there are two major ways of installing Ubuntu, without a CD.\nOne:\nYou can create an ubuntu liveusb and install ubuntu on a dedicated partition (or inside a windows partition, this works as well). If you want to do this, see this article on how to create an Ubuntu live usb. \nTwo:\nYou can install Ubuntu via Wubi. Wubi is an windows installer for Ubuntu. Wubi creates a big file, let's say on your Windows where it install Ubuntu. The downside of using Wubi is that you cannot recreate a dedicated Ubuntu partition by using the wubi method.\n\nA: I have another solution that may be safer than what you are trying to do. I have Windows 2000 installed on Kubuntu 12.04 via the Virtual Box software. One can download the VirtualBox software from Oracle for Windows. The Virtual Box sets up the installation for you. \nI think this is a safer idea if you want to try Linux on your ASUS Windows 8 Laptop. Some on these threads are talking about horror stories trying to do a dual boot with Windows 8 etc. This method is very safe! \n\nA: It can be done, yes. Use 12.10 64-bit or 12.04.2 LTS 64-bit. Make a USB-Stick, boot it and choose \"try Ubuntu\". Then install.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server installer says it can't find CD drive, but the server doesn't have a CD drive The server I just built does not have a CD drive. I want to install Ubuntu Server 12.10.\nThe motherboard in the server is a Gigabyte GA-H61M-USB3. I burned the image to a thumb drive and set up the BIOS to boot from USB (USB-CDROM setting). The installer launches and I am able to do the initial setup (language, keyboard, etc.), but then I get an error saying that it can't find the CD drive.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: I faced a similar problem twice; the OS was booting just fine from USB but for some reason it was trying to load files from the CD-ROM.\nThe fiest time I re-downloaded the image and burned into USB again and the second I followed the procedure mentioned in USB drive install of Ubuntu 12.04 Server fails - can't find components from CD-ROM\n", "Q: color calibration and 3d acceleration I am a photographer and I am looking at moving to Ubuntu in the near future. I also enjoy playing games. I am planning on building a new computer specifically for Ubuntu.\nI've been doing some testing with a laptop that has an nvidia graphics chip in it and I've discovered that I can use the gnome color calibration tool to calibrate my display using my ColorMunki. However, if I install the nvidia driver so I can play a video game, I am unable to calibrate my display.\nMy question is, does either the AMD driver or Intel driver have this same issue?\n\nA: I've never heard of nvidia drivers affecting the color managment portion of the OS. All i can say is, make sure to have a .icm prepared already for the linux system, rather than try and make one after you install. \nWhat your problem might be also, stems from OpenGL. In many cases, games with OpenGL will cause the color profile to be disabled, meaning you have to re-load the color profiles.\nThat's all I got, good luck.\n", "Q: image can not be seen in htdocs?

I've done that and trust me it is not a piece of cake to revert to the initial configuration after that. So I've had this problem for a while now and I finally figured out a solution to it although it's only to be used as a last resort:\nsudo chmod -R 777 /opt/lampp/htdocs/path/to/image/folder\n\nthis basically gives you all permissions pertaining to all the images stored in that folder. Cheers!\n", "Q: Make sure server can always boot and a hard drive is mounted before sharing with Samba I have two 2-TB hard drives (not the boot/system drives) with a single partition in each, that I share with Samba. Mountpoints are in /mnt/drive01 and /mnt/drive02.\nThese are also the path of two samba shares, named backup1 and backup2. As soon as these shares are up, they start getting filled with (lots of) data from other machines in the network (some machines write to backup1, others to backup2, but none writes on both).\nEverything works as planned, no problem with Samba. This server (on remote location) is configured to auto-reboot in case of power loss etc. Also, I have two drives in RAID1 as system/boot drives, to make sure the server can (almost!) always at least boot.\nThe problem is in case the system boots fine, but for some reason cannot mount one (or both) of the 2 TB hard drives: samba would start sharing /mnt/drive01 and /mnt/drive02, the large capacity drive (s) is not mounted so all the data in fact ends up on the system drive, filling it up and making the system unusable or unable to be accessed remotely via ssh.\nSo I don't think is a good idea entering the partitions of the two 2 TB drives in /etc/fstab, since I noticed some problems in boot in case one of the data drives is for example disconnected. Again this is important as the server is in remote location and cannot rely on an operator intervention to fix on-screen messages such as \"drive not ready, keep waiting, press S to skip mounting, M for manual...\"\nSo I have a small script which tries mounting the data drives a minute after boot, and this fixes the fstab part. Now on to Samba.\nWhat I would like is to have Samba start after some time (no problem) but also \"dynamically\" enable or disable the two shares. So, for example, if the 2nd data drive fails, my script will only be able to mount the 1st data disk and samba would only advertise the backup1 share (with data being written to the 2-TB disk drive); the other share (backup2, mapped to /mnt/drive02) would be not advertised/disabled, but at least I have one share running (and some of my machines can pour data into it).\nOf course, the easy way is to have samba start only if both data drives are mounted, but this is an all-or-nothing solution\nAny ideas?\n\nA: There are two options. If you don't have another shares with Samba, you can just start Samba when both are mounted and stop when both are unmounted, using upstart or systemd. With systemd you should need Requires= stanza and with upstart start on mounted /dev/something. The other way is removing samba from the startup scripts and starting up using your script. Those options depends on what you have done already.\n", "Q: New to Ubuntu and got stuck on managing internet conection Just installed Ubuntu 12.0.4 LTS and got stuck on the part connecting to the internet.\nI can't even find a guide that can help me find the problem.\nMaybe it's because I'm new and I just can't find the right way to do it, or Ubuntu didn't install eth-drivers.\nI have a router that gives away automatically IP addresses.\n\nA: Actually you don't need to have problems like this.

This worked fine in 11.10, but today I upgraded to 12.10 and I can't remember what I had to do to get this to work correctly.

What I see now are all application icons regardless of the workspace they are running in.\nI am using Gnome Classic since I have a VPN client that only shows it's status in the system tray from Gnome Classic.\n\nA: As it turns out, the solution to a different problem I was having (workspace names in the taskbar) ended up solving this as well. The solution is to use metacity instead of compiz. When I do that I only see the applications for each workspace in their respective workspaces (or viewports...).\n", "Q: Some Ubuntu 13.04 applications cannot access files on MTP-mounted systems. Why? Ubuntu 13.04 comes with MTP support to access files on newer Android devices. My Nexus 10 works OK: after plugging in, I can access the N10 files with Nautilus, and I can copy from and to the device. Evince will open PDF files right from the device, but some applications fail to open files directly from the device like gedit or libreoffice. Gedit says something like:\nCannot open file mtp://[usb:001,009]/65537/5823/5824\n\nI guess MTP is integrated at the gvfs level, so should not all gvfs-enabled applications be able to access the MTP device? Why evince but not gedit?\nI know that MTP could be mounted with fuse, but it would be nice if it worked with regular applications from Nautilus just like sftp:// or smb://.\n\nA: The MTP specification doesn't support the basic open/read/write/close operations that are required to implement normal file access on Linux - it only provides upload/download for files, and that's what the MTP backend implements.   \nNautilus will copy files just fine, but as soon as you try to use an application that doesn't explicitly account for the restricted set of operations, you'll get an error. evince is an example of an app that does support it (it copies the file to /tmp then opens it).\nSo, that's what's going on in 13.04.\nNow, it happens to be the case that Google implemented a set of MTP extensions in Android that offer open/read/write/close, and it's possible to provide normal file access with these. I've done this work in the gvfs development branch but it missed the 1.16 release window, so it's not going to show up in Ubuntu until 13.10 at the earliest. 14.04 and still not there\nIn the meantime, you can use my ppa to install builds where I have backported this work.\nhttps://launchpad.net/~langdalepl/+archive/gvfs-mtp\nFinally, it's important to note that these extensions only exist in Google's MTP stack. You have a Nexus 10, so it will work as it's running stock Android - but someone using a Samsung device, or devices from other manufacturers, will not have these extensions and might not have support for normal file I/O.\n\nA: I had trouble getting photos off my Fujifilm FinePix S1500.

When you restart your computer and you think the booting process is done, press Ctrl+Alt+F1. You will be prompted a command line. \nLog in with your username and password and make sure you have internet connection (e.g. ping google.com). If your WiFi isn't working, connect your computer to the router using an ethernet cable.\nYou can then simply type sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and your machine will download and install the missing packages. Restart your computer with sudo shutdown -r now and after rebooting, Gnome 3.8 should be working just fine.\n\nA: I notice you mention you have installed the gnome3 PPA. Did you ensure that while installing this PPA you performed an update with: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade as opposed to just using the upgrade option? This is mentioned in the release notes of the PPA and if it is not done it will cause symptoms similar to what you describe.\n", "Q: After installing ubuntu 12.04.2, I can't load windows 8 I have a laptop with in-built windows 8. I installed Ubuntu 64 bit via the method shown on this Ubuntu page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI \nAfter use boot-repair, in GRUB menu it shows Windows 8 as well. But on clicking it, it shows errors.\n\nA: I also got this problem when I installed Ubuntu 64 bit (12.10) and you also like me messed up the Windows 8 boot partition. So now your only options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-install winidows 8\n\n*Fix the windows 8 boot \n\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.techspot.com/guides/630-windows-8-boot-fix/\n\n*http://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-fix-windows-8-mbr-master-boot-record/\n\nA: Reporting the precise errors you're seeing might be a helpful diagnostic. Chances are, though, that you haven't broken your Windows; it's probably just a GRUB problem. Some ideas for getting it working:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install rEFInd. Installing the Debian package should set it up properly; however, you might need to do the next thing, too.\n\n*Disable Secure Boot. Details of how to do this vary from one system to another, but as a general rule, you'll need to enter your firmware's setup utility and look for an option labeled \"Secure Boot\" to disable it.\n\n*Create a custom boot entry for Windows, via an entry in /etc/grub.d/40_custom, as shown below. Details will vary depending on where your EFI System Partition (ESP) is, though. After you create this entry, you'll need to type sudo update-grub to update GRUB's runtime configuration file.\n\n\nThe sample /etc/grub.d/40_custom entry is:\nmenuentry \"Windows 8\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt1)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nNote that (hd0,gpt1) must point to your ESP, so it may need to be changed to match your partitioning layout.\n", "Q: How to Disable KDE Wallet and have \"remember password\" working When I log into my system I have a KDE Wallet password dialog. When I disable it, some passwords as wifi or FTP accounts don't work any more, and the main problem - I dont have \"remember password\" any more.\nFor example I disable KDE Wallet, reboot, and I have no KDE Wallet dialog, but my WiFi can't connect, it doesn't ask for password, just \"connecting\", I give it 10 minutes, then delete (remove) the connection, after recreating it everything is fine.\nPlease help.\nKubuntu 12.04\n\nA: KDE Wallet is the component that does the actual remembering of passwords in a KDE environment.\nYou could set an empty password, but here’s a suggestion for something to set first: Open KWalletManager and use Settings → Configure Wallet… then untick the checkbox “Close when last application stops using it”. That way, you only need to open it once at system start, then it keeps running and provides you with passwords, while still storing them on disc only in an encrypted form (which it cannot do without a wallet password, obviously).\n\nA: I solved this issue by going into the network manager settings by clicking the wifi/network icon in the taskbar > Settings icon, and then from the networks screen that appears, I right-clicked my connection, clicked edit, and then under the \"General configuration\" tab, ticked the \"All users may connect to this network\" check box. When I restarted my computer, I wasn't asked to enter the kwallet password and connected to my network automatically. \nPerhaps this solution may also solve the problem you are having with kwallet.\n\nA: Verax gave the best solution in comment:\nIn addition to setting the \"All users may connect to this network\" as user311982 described (Which I find is only disabled by default for Wifi networks, not Ethernet), which by itself didn't do the trick for me I found the KDE Connection Settings Module, after selecting a Wi-Fi network and navigating to the \"Wi-Fi Security\" tab:  It makes sense that you'd need to choose \"Store password for all users\" instead of the default \"Store password for this user only\" so that the password may be accessed before you unlock the wallet.\n\nA: I have Kubuntu 20.04.1 installed and I was facing the same issue; neither the WiFi password nor my Chrome passwords were being saved.\nI had enabled the automatic login during the installation, and what worked for me was disabling automatic login in System Settings > Account Details > User Manager.\n\nA: None of this worked for me but here is how I disabled it (Kwallet) in Plasma 5.\nThis solved the Wifi issue and Chrome's annoyance - both always requesting a password .... read on - it's kinda simple,\nKwallet Annoyance (Wifi and Chrome)\n• You can edit file \n              ~/.kde/share/config/kwalletrc\n     - adding to [Wallet] section just one line\n              Enabled=false\n\nsave quit reboot problem gone - I hope it helps\nMark\n\nA: If In doubt, use arch wiki! (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/KDE_Wallet)\n1) Install kwallet-pam\n2) Edit your display manager to execute pam_kwallet5.so and pam_kwallet5.so auto_start, as a optional auth and a optional session respectively.\n3) Profit $$$\n", "Q: g++ Installation I tried installing gpp in my Ubuntu 12.04, but I can't install it.\nIt reports,\nsudo apt-get install gpp\n[sudo] password for akash:\nReading package lists...

You cannot use it effectively with Windows 8, as it just generally does not work.  That was one of the reasons that Wubi was dropped and removed from 13.04.\nWhat I would suggest is that you use VirtualBox or some other virtual machine software to load Ubuntu onto, so that you can run it while running windows, as Wubi and Windows 8 don't work together.\n", "Q: Installing Crossover 11.3.1 .deb Fails I keep getting the same messege every time i install a deb file:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/defer/__init__.py\", line 489, in _inline_callbacks\n    result = gen.send(result)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sessioninstaller/core.py\", line 669, in _install_package_files\n    interaction, sender)\nTypeError: install_package_files() takes exactly 4 arguments (5 given)\n\n\nA: Open up the terminal.\nGiven that you told me this deb is in your downloads folder, type in this command: cd Downloads\nThen, since you know the file name, do sudo dpkg --install [filename]\nReplace [filename] with the filename for the deb file as it is in your Downloads folder.\nThat should install the .deb file, unless there are missing dependencies.\n", "Q: Gillson font is displaying as Times new roman In my application I am applying gill san font it is working in windows,but in Ubuntu it is displaying as Times new roman.I have Libre Office in my Ubuntu System.But Why it is not supporting Gill san Font?\n\nA: The font in question doesn't come installed with libreoffice.

I would like to migrate the OEM windows installation to a virtual machine within Ubuntu.\nThat is the long-term goal. For the moment I would like to install and use VMWare converter on Ubuntu 12.04 x64. Here is the most relevant google hit on this topic:\nhttp://linhost.info/2009/04/vmware-converter-installation-on-ubuntu-linux/\nYou need to follow this link and register with VMware to download the converter. I did this. Note that v4.0.1 is the most recent version available for Ubuntu.\nhttp://www.vmware.com/products/converter/overview.html\nI installed VMWare converter and the installer reported success.

Can I \"unmount\" the W7 partition and then resize it without breaking it? \n\nA: DO NOT try resizing Windows 7 drive from GParted. It creates huge issues with boot sector and flags, and you might as well just reinstall Windows. Just shrink the Windows volume from Windows Disk Management in Adminstrative Tools. That will give you free space. After that downoad GParted Live, here http://sourceforge.net/projects/gparted/files/gparted-live-stable/0.14.1-6/gparted-live-0.14.1-6-i486.iso/download burn it to a CD and boot from it, then use the freed disk space after shrinking Windows drive to resize Ubuntu drive. Make sure you're resizing the / and not /home or /usr if you have flags for them.\n", "Q: Let popup appear when logging in to guest account When logging out from the guest account, all the files of the guest are deleted.\nI like this behavior, but is there a way to show a popup like \"Warning, all your files will be removed when turning off the computer or logging out, better move them on an USB-stick first\" when a guest logs in and/or out?\nAlso, are a guest's files really deleted or are they moved to a hidden place on the computer?\n\nA: Create a script using zenity, then autostart that script by putting a .desktop file for the script in /etc/skel/.config/autostart/.The script will run for all new users (copied to the user's $HOME). Because of this, you'll want to do a check on the username. It might look like this (warning, I haven't tested):\n#1/bin/bash\nif [ \"$(whoami|awk -F- '{print $1}')\" = \"guest\" ]; then \nzenity –error –title=”Guest warning” –text=”Warning, all your files will be removed when turning off the computer or logging out, better move them on an USB-stick first.”; \nfi\nexit 0\n\nYou'll put that file somewhere accessible and set it to executable. You'll then create a simple .desktop file by looking at an example one and setting it to run the script you've just made, and place that in /etc/skel/.config/autostart/.\nThis is a great idea and should be standard.\n", "Q: copying files and inherit permissions of target folder When I copy files to a USB disk or another account on the same disk the permissions are not changed to the target. For example, when I copy files from account X to a folder of account Y, than the permission on the files are still of account X.\nI like to copy files and change the permissions to that of account Y.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: You can use ACL and the command setfacl for that.\n\nACL Entries\nACL entries consist of a user (u), group (g), other (o) and an effective rights mask (m). An effective rights mask defines the most restrictive level of permissions. setfacl sets the permissions for a given file or directory. getfacl shows the permissions for a given file or directory.\nDefaults for a given object can be defined.\nACLs can be applied to users or groups but it is easier to manage groups. Groups scale better than continuously adding or subtracting users.\n\nThis is the part you are after:\n\nCopying an ACL into the Default ACL\nOnce the ACLs are the way they need to be, they can be set as the default. Defaults are inherited, so a new directory will inherit the defaults of the parent directory.\n\ngetfacl -a /path/to/dir | setfacl -d -M- /path/to/dir\n\n\nYou do need to add the acl option when mounting. In /etc/fstab add acl to the options for your disc. Make sure to use a LABEL and not a UUID.\nLABEL=\"ExternalUsbDisc\"   /media/usb-disc     ext4   defaults,acl   0   2\n\n\nA: First, I think we talk about to change the owner and not the permissions.\nWhen you copy a file it will be recreated in the target folder. Thats why the files will have your account as owner. You can't create files with account X and the owner Y.\nBut you can of course change the owner of the files after you copied them.\nAs your user X type:\nchown <accountY>:<accountY> /path/to/file.test\nOr recoursive for changing the owner of a folder and all files within:\nchown -R <accountY>:<accountY> /path/to/folder\nThis will the change the owner and group of the files/folder.\n", "Q: juju doesn't bootstrap due to \"ERROR command failed: no tools available\" error I've seen other posts (e.g. this link), but I'm still struggling to install juju on my openstack cluster.\nI have swift working, but juju doesn't seem to want to bootstrap.

How can I copy Juju tools for use in my deployment?\nnutshell use $ juju sync-tools to copy from a globally available release to your private cloud.\n\nA: If your juju version is 1.10.0 then I think you just ran in to what I did; which in turn I believe is explained by the following:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/juju-core/+bug/1172973\nBasically, when juju attempts to access the public bucket (where the charms are downloaded for local storage) it uses credentials stored within code. These hard-coded credentials do not include an access-key or secret-key. But before a connection is made, there is an assertion which requires these credentials - thus the sync-tools attempt is failing (and I'm guessing this is what is causing the ERROR after it falls back to the public bucket on bootstrap).\n", "Q: Can I have the I-beam (mouse) cursor more visible in gtk3 apps? When the mouse cursor hovers over text (other than hypertext?) that can be edited or copied , the cursor appears as an I-Beam insertion bar.\nIn gtk2, it's possible to alter the width and color of the I-beam by merely editing a couple of lines in my theme's gtkrc file like this:  \nGtkWidget::cursor-color = \"red\"  \nGtkWidget::cursor_aspect_ratio = 0.2  \n\nIs there something similar available for gtk3 themes?

If you have another adapter, switch them out and try again.\n", "Q: apt authentication failure on self-signed package I did create a gpg key using \"gpg --gen-key\", here is the listing:\n> gpg --list-keys\n/home/<user>/.gnupg/pubring.gpg\n--------------------------------\npub   2048R/99EDE0B7 2013-02-05\nuid                  Some Company\nsub   2048R/97337D10 2013-02-05\n\nI exported the public key using:\n> gpg --output key.pub --armor --export 99EDE0B7\n\nI signed a deb package using:\n> dpkg-sig --sign builder -k 99EDE0B7 mypackage.deb\n\nI can verify the signing on the same controller:\n> dpkg-sig --verify mypackage.deb \nProcessing mypackage.deb...\nGOODSIG _gpgbuilder 31C631682D8C1DC833576A283C9A9AA799EDE0B7 1366790488\n\nI import the public key on a different controller:\n> apt-key add key.pub\nOK\n> apt-key list\n/etc/apt/trusted.gpg\n--------------------\npub   2048R/99EDE0B7 2013-02-05\nuid                  My Company\nsub   2048R/97337D10 2013-02-05\n\nBut when I verify the package on this new controller the signing is unknown:\n> dpkg-sig --verify mypackage.deb \nProcessing mypackage.deb...\nUNKNOWNSIG _gpgbuilder 99EDE0B7\n\nI must use \"gpg --import\" to actually verify the package:\n> gpg --import key.pub\n\nThen the verification works:\n> dpkg-sig --verify mypackage.deb \nProcessing mypackage.deb...\nGOODSIG _gpgbuilder 980CDF084EC87D4C003E020C4B324EFB85743C26 1366872932\n\nBut when using apt to install the package I get an authentication error:\n> apt-get install mypackage\nReading package lists...

If one wants the latest version of a package, usually you have to visit the project site or google for the official page and download and compile the source or, if available, the binaries.\n\n\n*\n\n*If I install from source, will I get automatic updates?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n*\n\n*If I install the binaries, will I get automatic updates? \n\n\nIt depends.

Again open up the Terminal (Applications > Accessories >\n  Terminal). Step 2. Copy/Paste the following line into Terminal and\n  press enter:\nsudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5\n\nStep 3. In order for PHP to work and be compatible with Apache we must\n  restart it. Type the following code in Terminal to do this:\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nTest PHP\n  -- To ensure there are no issues with PHP let's give it a quick test run.\nStep 1. In the terminal copy/paste the following line: updated\nsudo gedit /var/www/html/testphp.php\n\nThis will open up a file called phptest.php.\nStep 2. Copy/Paste this line into the phptest file:\n<?php phpinfo(); ?>\n\nStep 3. Save and close the file.\nStep 4. Now open you're web browser and type the following into the\n  web address:\nhttp://localhost/testphp.php\n\nThe page should look like this:\n\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Thunderbird: keep Inbox clean I tried to find a thunderbird plugin which can do this:\nDisplay a button on the top of the message (while reading, not composing) \"move message to folder '...'\".\nThe plugin checks the \"from\" header of the mail and remembers (or searches) where the last mails of this sender were moved to. In about 95% of my cases the plugin could guess the correct folder. The algorithm is quite easy: move the mail to the folder, which was used the last time for this from-address.\nThis could help to keep the inbox clean.\nI know a lot of people which have a huge inbox folder because they are to lazy (or busy) to move mails into subfolders. \nI don't like the manual way: right click, move message to folder \"...\". And the archive feature of thunderbird does not help me. I want to keep mails separated. \nAny idea how to keep the mail inbox clean by moving mails to subfolders in a way that is easy and fast?\nUpdate\nFilters don't solve my problem: I want to see all mails in my Inbox. After reading and handling the mail I want to move it to an other folder.\n\nA: Try my addon quickFilters. You switch it to learning mode, then move the email manually once. It will bring up a wizard so you can teach a filter to do this automatically from then on. It also integrates well with my other addon, QuickFolders. I also highly recommend using the \"Copy Sent to Current\" Addon to keep filtered conversations together and the [N] shortcut for jumping to the next unread mail.\nAs regards the Update, maybe you can define your filters not to run when \"Checking mail\" but only run manually; you still have the problem that they will be applied to all mails in the folder, so one would have to add a mechanism to avoid filtering unread emails.\n\nA: You can try addon called archive-this\nIt works like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a message filter (e.g. is from contact abc)\n\n*define the action (move to specific folder)\n\n*create preset keyboard shortcuts for triggering the action\n\n\nI hope it helps :) \n\nA: I get you. I use Gmail and have filters in Gmail that tag certain mails with specific tags. So the usual thing I do is jut click archive and it's out of my inbox.\nCurrently, using Thunderbird works fine.Those emails that are already tagged are present in other folder and clicking archive removes it from my the inbox.\nIn case that's not your case, you can just click & drag the mail to folder (I have \"Unread\" folders turned on).

I know. I've been there. If there is even the smallest chance that your data will change, you want a proper XML parser.\nMy choice would be to use BeautifulSoup but it makes handling it directly from Bash fairly hard. If you want to write an intermediary Python script, that's still an option... Otherwise xpath is a fairly classic option. It's a wrapper around Perl's libxml library and it does some fairly powerful things.\nsudo apt-get install libxml-xpath-perl\n\nAnd for your example, here's how I'd do this in the xpath query language:\nxpath -e '*/serverName/*' big_xml_file.xml\n\nAgain, if you need to do anything useful with this XML, consider something even stronger like BeautifulSoup and Python.\n\nA: sed -n '/<serverName/,/<\\/serverName/p' big_xml_file.xml\n\nDid the trick (adapted from this post at linuxquestions.org).\nOn Ubuntu 14.04:\n$ sed -n '/<serverName/,/<\\/serverName/p' big.xml\n<serverName someKey=\"false\" anotherKey=\"0.05\" thirdKey=\"0.04\">\n  <default>blah.blah.blah</default>\n  <region name=\"US\">us.blah.net</region>\n  <region name=\"EU\">eu.blah.net</region>\n  <region name=\"IL\">il.blah.net</region>\n</serverName>\n\n\nA: I can also imagine that you need to find a particular server from a longer list along with particular settings or regions based on some given conditional paths. \nIn that case, I would recommend wrapping your XPATH statements and conditions in an XSLT stylesheet. There are a number of XSLT parsers available in the repositories to work with the command line, PHP, Perl, Python, Java, etc.\nXSLT is very powerful and can output text, xml, and html.\n", "Q: How to turn off airplane mode?(12.10) I have a problem get the WiFi to work in Ubuntu 12.10.\nWhen I use gnome network manager it indicates that wireless is disabled by hardware switch while it is not.\nIn the Network Settings Panel in the wireless section, it only shows the hardware address and the switch is off and it's disabled so that I can't change the status to On.\nAt the bottom there is an airplane mode switch which is On, and turning it off has no effect and it immediately turns back on.\nI use a sony vaio CA series Laptop\n\nA: This worked for me:  \nEnter rfkill unblock all in Terminal and then try to enable wireless, it should work now.\n\nA: My Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition (project Sputnik) has Ubuntu 15.04.

Perhaps it was a bug. \n", "Q: Run both at the same time, Windows and Ubuntu I had read in some sites that it is possible to run two OS'es in the same machine at the same time through a Virtual Machine software, so you can switch Virtual Terminals with keyboard hotkeys and be on Ubuntu browsing the web and switch to Windows to write a document, no need to restart and choose the other OS, both running simultaneously.\nSo first thing: Is it true?\nIf it is indeed possible how can I do that?\nAnd what are the drawbacks?\nSorry if I misunderstood something about Virtual Terminals, although I don't know a lot about them and how they work or even for what purpose they exist.\nOBS.: I noticed that my motherboard offers Intel Virtualization Technology, that says that this feature makes use of a hardware design that makes better virtualization (or helps, don't know) than software virtualization.\n\nA: The short answer is, yes you can run both Windows and Ubuntu at the same time.\nThe long answer of \"how can I do it?\" depends on what you want your host OS and what you want your \"guest OS\" to be. I can think of three possibilities:\nFirst, use Windows as the host. This means Windows will be your primary OS running directly on the hardware (the computer). This is how most people run Windows. Then you will install a program in Windows, such as Virtualbox, or VMPlayer (call it VM). When you launch this program you will be able to install another OS, say Ubuntu, inside the VM as a guest. Before you install Ubuntu in the VM, you will need to assign some resources to the VM such as the amount of RAM and hard-disk space. The VM program will act like a virtual computer with the RAM and hard-disk space you have allocated. Once installed, you will be able to run Ubuntu within the VM, either in a window or in full screen mode.\nSecond, You can also do the reverse. That is, install Ubuntu as the host on a real machine and install Windows as a guest in a VM inside Ubuntu. \nThird, If you have a Mac as a host, you can use a similar VM program called Parallel for Mac and create two VMs, one for Windows, and another for Ubuntu.\nSee the VM Wiki for additional details.\nAlso see the Ubuntu Help on Virtual Box, VMWare/Player and Parallel VM for Mac.\nDrawbacks\nThe main drawback of running an OS in a VM is access to resources, say RAM. First, the host will need some RAM to run itself and any native programs like a word processor you want to run. The guest can then only use what is left behind. So if you have only 4GB of RAM and Windows (the host) needs 3GB to work well. The Ubuntu as guest can only use 1GB of physical RAM. You may assign more RAM to Ubuntu, but things will slow down as the hard drive will be used as virtual RAM and things will be moved between real RAM and the virtual RAM. \nThe second drawback is also related to resources. Say you have a very fancy graphics card in your machine. However, in the VM all the hardware is virtual. The default virtual graphics card may have more limited capabilities, but may be chosen as default as it is compatible to a variety of OSs. So the OS in the VM won't be able to take advantage of the fancy graphics card. The difference between the first and the second drawback is the following. You can get more RAM or a bigger hard-drive in the real machine, and then allocate them to the VM. There may not be an easy way to change the default configurations of other aspects of the virtual hardware in the VM. Thus, a faster graphics card in the real machine may not translate to one in the VM.\nOn virtual terminal:\nI don't know what you mean by it. To me, a virtual terminal is a command line interface that can work without the graphical user interfaces (GUI) in Ubuntu and other Linux and similar systems. The concept of a virtual terminal does not apply to Windows. See What is a virtual terminal for? for more details on virtual terminals.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Most all operating systems expect to have full uninterrupted access to the computer's hardware/resources, and do not like sharing with another OS, it won't work.  So the answer to that is virtualization.\nVirtual Machines that use technologies like Intel's VT-x and AMD's AMD-V aloow you to do just that.\nVirtual Box, and VMWare allow you to install multiple operating systems on the same host machine.  Such as Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.  Both allow you to: \n\n\n*\n\n*Run more than one OS at a time\n\n*Switch between the OS's as you like\n\n*Start, stop, and pause the OS's at the same time or independent of\neach other\n\n*Sharing between the OS's\n\n*The ability to allocate the desired resources\n\n*Backup and restore using a snapshot\n\n\nUsing this way requires you to have great hardware, a lot of RAM, and disk space, otherwise you will feel a lag.  Depending on how many operating systems you're planning on running.  Just to give you an example, I have a 3.0 GHz i7 CPU with 16GB RAM, and 2 TB Hard Disk.  I run Ubuntu 12.04 as the host OS, and I have the following Virtual Machines running at the same time:  Ubuntu 12.10, Ubuntu Server 12.10, Redhat 6, Window 7, and Windows 8 ( windows 7 & 8 for work, and testing purposes).  \nVirtual Box does not require CPU-based virtualization support (VT-x or AMD-V), and you can download it free, while VMWare Workstations a paid application.  I personally prefer VMWare Workstation.\nFor more information click here for VMWare, and VirtualBox\nThe image below is from my laptop running Windows 7 as the host with 4 VM's.  Laptop is Dell w/ AMD A8, 8GB RAM.\n\n\nA: As the other said you can use virtual machines. there is a fantastic option that would inspire you and is very useful \nYou can use \"seemless\" option by pressing ctrl+L in virtualbox to to have a mixed ubuntu + windows environment that make you able to use windows and ubuntu without switching between two of them\n", "Q: How to run Windows executable Files Having shifted from Windows a while ago, there are still some applications that I wish were also designed to run on Linux platform.

For Gnome 3 (Ubuntu 11.10 onwards) the ~/.local/share/thumbnailers (or /usr/share/thumbnailers) is the correct one.\nAnd your problem is that you mixed the 2 approaches. This line:\nMimeType=application@vnd.ms-htmlhelp;\n\nShould actually be:\nMimeType=application/vnd.ms-htmlhelp;\n\nBasically, replace @ for / and it should work. And I also recommend adding application/x-chm to the list, just in case.\nYou see, @ was just an (ugly) workaround gconf required since / was not a valid char for key names (it is used to indicate key hierarchy).\nBut apart from the now obsolete gconf, mime types are always defined with /.\n", "Q: access with vino without ask me permissions i have ubuntu 12.10. how I can access my computer remotely with vino, without ask me permissions on the server?

I'm running FC18 + virtualbox and trying to install Ub.Studio 12.10 64bit. It works \"fine\" as live CD (except jackd, the main audio server, isn't working.. supposedly there is a fix for this) but when trying to install it I have problems..\nThe installer demands 8.5GB of disk space. I gave it 12GB thru VirtualBox (allocating as needed; not all up front). Yet without custom partitioning (ie clicking 'Something else') it halts shortly into the installation, saying there is not enough space.\nWhen the partition dialogue comes up, if I select the device (here, /dev/sda) and click 'New partition table...' I'm not allowed to modify it b/c it is 'In use by LVM volume group ubuntu-studio.' I cannot change the sizes of, or delete/add partitions, as the plus/minus keys are grayed out. All I can change are partition formats, whether partition is formatted, and its mount point. \nSo, in order to get the installer to work, I had to switch the home, root, and swap volumes, as that was the only thing the installer would let me do. \nNow I have an ~8gb root volume, ~4gb home volume, and a ~255mb swap space. It's actually not bad for my purposes, but it sure would be nice if I could, myself, change the sizes of each partition at install time.. \nAny way to do this?\nThanks!\n\nA: Why bother to make separate partitions if you are running Virtualbox?

But the rest of the people won't be able to reach certain files that won't meet the requirements for worldwide access.\nAdditionally, you may need to assign anonymous read permissions to the folder where the files resides by running sudo chmod 775 /opt/lampp/htdocs/madeTemplet/basicTemplet/_images -R\n-R = Recursively: All the files/folders inside will also be affected.\nPlease give this a try and let us know if this is doing the work for you, if you need further assistance don't hesitate to let us know by dropping a message and the contents of this answer may be changed or deleted depending on your results.\nGood luck!\n\nA: You should not assign execute permissions to files.\nYou should not recursively assign 775.\nIf you are going to do the above, instead do this:\nfind /opt/lampp/htdocs/madeTemplet/basicTemplet/_images -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\n\nor \nfind /opt/lampp/htdocs/madeTemplet/basicTemplet/_images -type f -exec chmod ugo+r {} \\;\n\nI once worked with someone who had a habit of telling people to cd to a directory and recursively chmod 777 things, but one day the person he was telling to do it forgot to say the cd command had returned the message \"directory not found\" and so he borked the whole server.\n", "Q: Why does my Xubuntu LibreOffice look ugly?

I'm just wondering what happened to Ubuntu Desktop's global menu and Linux Kernel 3.8.5?  3.8.5 is supposed to land in raring, but my ISO (just a day old before release) doesn't have it (3.8.0-19 generic). Same thing goes with some of the applications with the global menu.  Ubuntu Desktop doesn't have it, Files, Appearance, and other application's menu has problems (repeats the name twice). Do they plan on not fixing/releasing it?\nSorry for the weird question, but the \"defective\" panel menu is driving me nuts. The \"cannot set freq 16000 to ep 0x86\" is also pretty frustrating (I don't want to keep unplugging my webcam every single boot).\n\nA: The kernel is based on linux v3.8.5. And wait for the final release, I guess you are using one of the latest daily builds. The appearance has changed, also its more snappier than 12.10. \n", "Q: Is there a user friendly way of mounting an external drive that was ejected? I have a very noisy external 500 GB drive which I use mostly for synchronizing local files.\nIn OS X I used to eject the drive, and mount it later when I need it with the Disk Utility.\nIs there a GUI for doing so in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Try gparted:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\n\nA: The other question is about \"auto mount\" features. My question was specifically about the ability to mount a drive that I ejected myself in the same session, via GUI.\nThis can be done in the Disks program, as Mitch pointed out in the comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the drive, and look for the little square icon below the graph with the partitions.\n\n*When the device is mounted, clicking this icon will unmount the drive (\"stop\").\n\n*When the device is not mounted, the icon will show a \"play\" arrow instead (similar to a music player). Clicking the \"play\" button will mount the drive.\n\n\nI feel this question is relevant, because in Windows 7 I never found a way to do this. If I ejected my (very noisy) Seagate USB hardrive, I would be unable to mount it again short of restarting Windows or pulling and plugging the cable again.\n", "Q: How do I get Glibc >= 2.16.0? I know there are already built packages for Pidgin. I need to build Pidgin so I can build plug-ins.\nI need Glibc >= 2.16.0. Unfortunately, I get stuck in an endless dependency loop. I need libgtk2.0-dev and libglibc-devel which apparently needs libpango1.0-dev. libpango1.0-dev needs libcairo2-dev. libcairo2-dev needs libcairo2, libcairo-gobject2, and libpixman-1-dev.\nThen it says \"Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\" How can this be true if I ran sudo apt-get install -f and it spat out the following:\nReading package lists...

However, that is beyond the scope of my question.\nSo again, how do I get these dependencies without using dpkg and possibly introducing foreign sources which will inevitably break my system?\n\nA: As far as I know, glibc is not something you can just upgrade.\nHowever, you can just use \"pbuilder\" and PPAs to have your stuff built.\nOr even VirtualBox with a simple Ubuntu server.  \nFor more information on Pbuilder and PPAs, check the Packaging Guide.  \n", "Q: Keeping the same /home partition after a clean install I currently have 2 partitions for my ubuntu installation:  A / partition and a /home partition.\nWhen Ubuntu 13.04 is released I plan to reinstall ubuntu while keeping the same home partition.  Is it safe to just mount the /home partition directly in the partitioning process of the installation? Because there are files present in my home partition already will the installer wipe the partition or will it just mount the partition?\n\nA: It is  safe for the most part as long as you don't click the format check box. I've installed Ubuntu myself in this way for three releases now, and have not lost any data. However most would encourage you to backup before attempting this.\nWhen the partitioning window shows up while installing Ubuntu click the format box on the /\n\nBut do not format  /home\n\n", "Q: Updated PPA for Gparted I am looking for a PPA that has an updated version of GPARTED.

The last one was the 0.16 that came out yesterday.\nIs there a PPA that offers the latest GPARTED, specially because of the fixes it hovers and new file systems it supports.\n\nA: GetDeb has the latest packages.\nTo use the repository, follow the instructions on their website.\nAfter you added the repository, run sudo apt-get update from terminal to make sure you can install packages from there. Now you can install the newest version of GParted.\nPlease note that GetDeb is an unofficial source. Although they test the packages before release, their testing is not nearly as strict as the official repositorys.

I've been running an Ubuntu desktop for a couple of years. I regularly update the security and recommended updates via Upgrade Manager. However it seems I didn't have Upgrade Manager set up to tell me of Ubuntu updates. Having realised this post the April-2013 loss of support for 10.04, and changed the settings, it now offers me an upgrade to 10.10. However when clicking on it and following the upgrade instructions, I consistently get the following error message: \n\"Failed to fetch. Fetching the upgrade failed. There may be a network problem.\"\nNow I don't necessarily want 10.10, and would prefer to skip to the latest one with the longest duration of support available, which appears to be 12.04 LTS. \nBearing in mind I have very few IT skills (Ubuntu was set up for me by an IT expert to temporarily replace a very slow running Windows Vista, but I loved it so stuck with it ever since):\n\n\n*\n\n*Can someone tell me how I can upgrade directly to 12.04 LTS?     \n\n*Is there any danger of losing existing files etc that I should be aware of in doing so? \n\n*And - less importantly, but if anyone has time to explain - what exactly is the difference between supported and unsupported (ie. what would happen longer term if I just carried on using 10.04)?\n\n\nMany thanks,\nTim.\n\nA: *\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PreciseUpgrades  \n\n*No. Always have a backup of course, but it should upgrade without problems.  \n\n*Support means you get security and other updates for your system. LTS (Long Term Supported) is supported for a longer period.  \n\n\nRecently Canonical reduced the support period for non-LTS to 9 months. But don't be afraid, it's perfectly stable, and you have plenty of time to roll with the next release when it comes out. And to be honest, your PC won't stop if you slip out of the support period. You can just catch up whenever you want.  \nWhich one to use? It all depends on you. LTS is a bit \"older\", but it provides a long-term, stable environment for enterprise, and servers. The non-LTS version is stable too, but you may not want the upgrade hassle on a whole bunch of company servers every half a year.  \nFor desktop, I go for the latest release.\nFor our company servers, I choose the LTS versions.\nAnd for my own servers, I just run the latest release too.\n", "Q: avoid reinstall virtualbox and update to the latest release Installing virtualbox-extension-pack-4.2.12 to enable USB2.0 controller prompted only to work with the latest release. \nBut my current version is 4.0.18 on debian wheezy.

I am messing around trying to find the best graphics solution for my Laptop with Optimus Nvidia.

It's a trade-off, input lag vs. screen tearing.\nI think optirun sets vblank_mode=0 by default, so it doesn't change whether you specify it or not. primusrun doesn't and it too caps at 60 fps without vblank_mode=0.\n", "Q: Guest account files My houseguest just wrote a 20 page paper using the guest account on my computer.

CLI option for shutting down the system is\nsudo shutdown -h now\n\nThis requires the user to give the administrator password, whereas shutting down via GUI doesn't require any password. Why does GUI method not require any password? Does it remember that we used the password to login? In that case why does it ask for a password in the terminal?\nThis is not a duplicate because I think there is no question regarding the password while shutting down the system.\n\nA: The two situations are not really the same. \nWhen you use shutdown from the command line you will restart or power off whatever computer you are logged into from that terminal. It could be your laptop or it could be a remote server. All logged in users will be affected so superuser privileges are required.\nWhen you use the shutdown menu from the menubar, the computer will shutdown only if no other users are logged in. If other users are logged in, the shutdown option will in fact just log you out. Superuser privileges are not required since you can't affect other users.\n\nA: I think the reason for this difference is mainly historical; command line tools assume a multi-user server environment with remote sessions, whereas graphical tools tend to cater more to local single-user desktop systems. If you are sharing a system with dozens of other users, for example in a corporate or collegiate environment in the 1980s, it makes sense to limit who can run shutdown, to avoid disruptions. But if you are sitting in front of your PC and you're the only one using it, it's kind of silly to prompt you for a password to shut down, since you could disconnect the power cable to achieve nearly the same thing.\n", "Q: Intel processor can use the 64-bit AMD version?

And if so, how?\nThe only way I found was by a new install, and I'd like to know if there is an alternative like in previous versions.\n\nA: There are two ways to upgrade to 13.04 without loosing your data:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can upgrade your current install\n\n\nYou will get a promt asking you to upgrade in a couple of days (2 weeks after release I think), or you can upgrade now by typing sudo do-release-upgrade in a terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*You can install over your current installation without formating the drive\n\n\n*\n\n*Download ubuntu 13.04 and create a startup USB disk or burn it to a CD/DVD. \n\n*Install as you normally would. \n\n*When asked select \"Upgrade Ubuntu 12.10 to 13.04\"\n\n\n\nYour data should not be overwritten, but it is good practice to back up your data anyway. \nIf you have a more complicated set up (such as separate /home partition) you can select \"something else\" and assing your partitions as you did before. But make sure not to put the checkmark to format you \"/home\" partition\n\nA: An upgrade should preserve your data.\nHowever you should make a backup of any important data.\nMaking a backup should not be considered optional, a best practice or recommended, I would say it is an absolute.  If you need to buy an external drive, a bunch of USB sticks or whatever, this is something you just really really should do.  \nRegardless of version control systems or whatever, I always backup files before upgrades, running sed scripts, reorganizing files, etc.  \nAny task that might, conceivably mess up the files, will eventually do that.

Everything worked fine and the install process went thru without any errors UNTIL it got the the reboot process. After it finishes install and it then tells you that you need to reboot in order to use the new installation, I click Reboot and it runs thru the process of ending everything so it can reboot and all of the sections shown during this process all come up as \"OK\" result but it still \"hangs\" and the system never fully reboots and it just sits there.\nAny idea as to why it hangs on the reboot?\n\nA: Make sure you chose the 64 bit version if your computer is 64 and 32 if your computer is 32.

I have previously installed ubuntu 12.10 with wubi.exe if i upgrade to 13.04 will everything work normally?\n\nA: Yes you can upgrade a Wubi install to 13.04, but Wubi support has been officially pulled by Ubuntu, therefore it's not recommended to do this.\nConfusingly though, the 13.04 wubi.exe (signed by Canonical UK Ltd.) has been published on http://releases.ubuntu.com/13.04 (for undisclosed reasons). \nAnd no, the 13.04 wubi.exe doesn't only create a guest account.

Which operating system shall I upgrade my PC to the 32 bit or 64bit, my laptop came with 32 bit but what confuses me is that it is on the download page If you have a PC with the Windows 8 logo or UEFI firmware, choose the 64-bit download. The thing is that my PC is 64 bit capable. Which operating system should I choose. Please list your answer with reasons why. my laptop came with 32-bit and has 32 bit windows 8. luckily, my laptop processor is 64bit based.\n\nA: UEFI firmware is a more modern alternative to the BIOS used in older computers. Windows 8 computers require UEFI because it uses something called secure boot. This means that only programs signed by Microsoft can run during boot up.\nThis adds special requirements needed to install another OS on the machine. Ubuntu streamlines this in the x64 iso of Ubuntu since every UEFI computer happens to have a 64-bit processor in it.\nIf your processor supports 64 bit, your computer will run more efficiently using 64bit code. You should choose Ubuntu64\n\nA: It is written on the Ubuntu download page, because either windows 8 logo or the UEFI capability indicates, that the certain computer is a 64-bit hardware architecture (amd64). Every newer system, built in the last few years are 64-bit, and gaining advantages of the 64-bit hardware (over a 32-bit hardware) is only possible with a 64-bit operating system. You can still use the 32-bit version of Ubuntu, but it doesn't have any advantages on 64-bit hardware, it's maintained for older, 32-bit (x86) computers and special cases. Use the 64-bit release, unless you have any particular reason to do otherwise.\n\nA: Currently, the Ubuntu download page proposes the 32bit image by default.\nHowever, the 32bit image is not compatible with UEFI computers. The 64bit image is.\nWindows8 computers are all UEFI computers.\nIf your computer (indeed processor) is 64bit, then you should use the 64bit image of Ubuntu.\nMore information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n", "Q: How to make the brightness keys work on an HP Folio 13? In my HP Folio 13 laptop with Ubuntu 13.04 the brightness control works with the slider in the system Brightness & Lock settings, but the brightness function keys don't. Also, the brightness level is set to maximum on every boot.\nIs there a way to make them work and make the system keep the brightness level set in the previous session?\nSome information about my laptop concering this issue:\nls /sys/class/backlight\nintel_backlight\n\nls /sys/class/backlight/*/brightness\n/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nlspci | grep -i vga\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n\nuname -a\nLinux folio13 3.8.0-19-generic #29-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 17 18:16:28 UTC 2013 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n\nA: I wanted to add a fix that worked for me, because I couldn't find this solution anywhere.\nIf you have an Intel video card (HD 4000, for example) you can fix it by adding acpi_backlight=intel_backlight to your grub options (in the same way as above).\nBEFORE YOU DO THIS:\nTest that you actually have an Intel video card with the following command:\necho 200 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nIf your brightness changes, then this solution should work for you.\nPlease note that I haven't tested this solution for laptops with multiple video cards (like NVidia Optimus or the like).\n\nA: Guys it worked for me with this setting in /etc/default/grub :\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"acpi_osi=\"\n\nYep, this is empty value for acpi_osi...\nDon't forget to do sudo update-grub and restart after you edit the /etc/default/grub file.\n\nA: To make the brightness function keys work on my laptop I have tried the following configurations (one by one) in /etc/default/grub, but none of them worked:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash pcie_aspm=force acpi_backlight=vendor\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nSame thing for the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX variable.\nI read about a solution which suggested editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf, but there was no such file in my system.\nSo far the best workaround I have found is to use xbacklight to bind the keys to appropriate commands.

Very little experience outside the Windows OS environment so I picked Ubuntu which I thought would be a good starting point. I created the ISO disk and deleted windows. I began running Ubuntu and encountered some things during installation which I was unsure about. First off I got a message stating I hadn't created /boot. So I went back and fumbled my way through that. Then I got a message saying I hadn't created /swap. I went back to try and do that, but I got an entirely new prompt and when I clicked it it completed the installation. \nAll was fine but then I tried to install Solaris. When my machine restarted I got an error saying that there was no bootable media and that I needed to enter a bootable disk etc... \nI removed the Solaris disk and tried several times to restart. Each time getting the same message about no bootable media. I tried using the Ubuntu ISO and KD bootdisk and still got the same error message. There was no command prompt and no way to format. I went into BIOS and changed the boot order and it still would not boot from CD. This morning I opened my computer and when I brought it out of hibernation it went straight to the Ubuntu desktop. \nI am guessing that I did not properly configure something during the install but I do not understand why, when even with a bootdisk entered it would not boot from the disk. Now when I try and access my HDD from Ubuntu desktop I get the error message Unable to mount location. Can't mount file.\nI see when I open the file system folder there is a boot folder. So long story short is there some way to check my installation or to get detailed install instructions and I will just reinstall. \n\nA: *\n\n*I'd advise you to read about MBR/GPT(bios and uefi too), bootloaders(grub,etc.),\n\n*I don't think your problem has anything to do with Ubuntu\n\n*The installation of Ubuntu is straightforward, you either choose manual partitioning or you let it format your drive. Basically you need a root partition and one for swap. You can create additional for /home,/tmp,etc. if you want.\n\n*When installing Ubuntu it will show you your HDD as for example /dev/sda, and you can select to which disk to record the bootloader(the software which lets your computer start the OS)\n\n*Basically in a MBR booting scheme, you have partitions which are made bootable, and a bootloader - probably Grub, which lets you select what to boot. \n\n*So to sum it all up: You choose the bootable media from bios: cd(dvd)/usb/hdd,etc.\n\n*After that the system boots from it, if there's no bootloader it will tell some error along the lines of that. Also most modern PC's have a boot priority lists, so if no boot sector is found in the first media, it will try the second,etc.\n\n*If you choose to boot from media other than your hdd, and it won't boot, then something is wrong with the media or your bios. You can try using another dvd/usb flash and/or flashing the bios. Also you can try unplugging your HDD prior to booting from the media. And of course try booting from it on another pc, so you're sure it's bootable. Also double check your settings to be sure it's trying to boot from the right source.\n\n*By bootable I mean there's this thing called boot sector which allows the computer to start it. It's not a file, and thus not shown as such in file managers.\nGood luck.\n\n", "Q: How to change the color of the window outline in spread and switcher? Staring with Ubuntu 13.04, the outline around windows when scale/spread (Super+W) and the switcher (when viewing different windows of an application using Alt+`) are invoked is red. See the pictures below. The outline stays red even when I change themes. Using the CompizConfig Settings Manager I can change the color of the outlines that appear when expo is invoked, windows are set into a grid, and windows are resized, but I can't find an option for scale/spread or the switcher.\nHow can I change the outline's color?\n\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04 you can change the window spread highlight color by editing your theme unity.css (if it has one) For example using the default ambience theme.\n\n\n*\n\n*Browse to the directory /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/, and edit unity.css as root.\nsudo gedit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/unity.css\n\nFind:\n-UnityDecoration-glow-color: rgb (221, 72, 20);\n\n\n*Change the rgb (red, green, blue) values to your desired color!

Almost every print-job looks like this:\nexample of faulty print job\nAs you can see, the printer is possessed :). Despite that, everything works fine on 12.04 and older versions. The drivers (Brother HL-5350 DN Br-Script3) are the same for 12.04 and 12.10/13.04.\nTest-pages are printed correctly. Sometimes we also get an extra page that looks like this:\nERROR:\nundefined\nOFFENDING COMMAND:\n....Undefined\nSTACK:\n(numbers)\n\nHow can I fix this behavior?\n\nA: I was hitting this exact same issue today when trying to print PDFs. I was also using the Br-Script3 driver but switched to the Brother MFC9840CDW Foomatic/Postscript driver.\nI would rather use the (correct) former driver, but it appears to be an issue that has not been resolved and this is an adequate workaround for my purposes.\n\nA: For us on Ubuntu 12.10 it wouldn't print anything (not even the test page) and would blink red/orange the bottom 4 lights when we tried to print. We resolved it by switching drivers to a generic driver (the Linux ones listed on Brother's website didn't appear to work, maybe I messed up the install) and even double-side printing works now! Ubuntu seems to recognize the printer and automatically add using the Br-Script3 driver. \nTo change it, since I have Cinnamon, I went into cinnamon-settings (gnome-control-center does NOT appear to let you change the driver associated with an automatically recognized printer), Printers > HL-5340D right click, Printer Properties > Settings, Make and Model, Change > Select Printer from Database, Generic, Forward > PCL 6/PCL SL > Generic PCL 6/PCL XL Printer -CUPS+Gutenprint v5.2.9. \nI have included a screenshot of the appropriate settings.

I have a working dual-boot setup (Ubuntu 12.10 and Win7) on my laptop.\nI got a 320GB HDD with partitions for /, /home, swap, winsys and a big windata partition. There's more than 250GB space occupied overall.  \nNow I bought a 250GB SSD which I will put in my Ultrabay, and I want to migrate all the partitions except the big data partition onto the SSD, enlarge them in a controlled manner according to SSD space, leave windata on the HDD, and expand it to the whole size. I want to avoid a fresh installation of both Ubuntu and Windows.\nI read quite much already, but I'm unsure what the best way to accomplish this is?  \n\n\n*\n\n*Clonezilla disk-to-disk clone is out, because the target disk is smaller.\n\n*Clonezilla partitions-to-partitions (omitting the data partition) seems to be a way, but I can only enlarge the partitions proportionally (even if I can), and I don't know if this will create proper SSD partition alignment. Also, what about the boot sector/boot loader, especially w.r.t. dualboot?\n\n*The sanest way seems to be to use GParted from a live cd, create the partitions on the SSD as desired, then copy the HDD partitions into the new ones, and expand the data partition on the HDD. This seems to me the most uncomplicated way -  GParted can do proper alignment, but I don't know if the boot loader can be copied, too? Also, if this works, why does everybody seem to recommend Clonezilla?\n\n*my boot partition is the first partition (sda1), where the windows system resides on.\n\n\nWill doing this purely in GParted work?

Probably you will want to make the ssd into one extended partition and put all of the other partitions inside that one extended one.\nOf course doing operations like this can always fail, even if the cause is something arbitrary like the power going out of the live cd failing, so definitely take a backup of your data before copying it. And I would also recommend that you don't make any changes to the HHD until you have successfully booted into the SSD with both windows and linux.\nProbably the steps you would want to take are:\nBoot into live CD and run GParted.\nMake an extended partition on the SSD covering the whole drive.\nCopy linux / partition and winsys partition to SSD, leaving the original still unchanged on the HHD.\nIf you wanted /home on the SSD, then make a new ext4 partition inside the extended partition, and use rsync to copy all data from the original to the copy.\nAn example rsync command could be like this:\nsudo rsync -rhtvlpEog --progress /media/PATH_TO_HOME_PARTITION_ON_HHD/ /media/PATH_TO_HOME_PARTITION_ON_SSD/\n\nexplaination of that command: -r copies recursivly, -h gives human readable output, -t preserves modification times, -v gives more output, -l copies symlinks as symlinks, -p keeps file permissions, -E keeps executablility, -o keeps owner, and -g keeps group.\nMark winsys and / as bootable on the SSD.\nUnmount and possibly disconnect your HHD from the computer, then run boot-repair, install grub to the SSD and making the / bootable.\nstill from the live CD, edit the fstab on the SSD / partition to have the new /home partition UUID.\nTest that grub/linux works by booting your computer with only SSD mounted. (Also test that you have all the data in your /home partition)\nThen if it does, use a windows repair disk to get the windows partition on the SSD bootable.\nAfter using windows repair disk on the SSD, try booting into both windows and linux, without connecting the HHD.\nNote: Be sure to not delete or move anything on the HHD, until you have confirmed that both windows and linux work on the SSD.\nIf all works on the SSD, then erase the /, /home, and winsys partitions from the HHD, and expand the windata partition to use the whole thing.\nI have outlined the steps that I would take. I can't vouch for the windows repair disk working, but according to that article it should. I can vouch for Boot Repair working when moving the / partition though. I know that that works because I have moved my partitions around quite a lot using GParted.\nAlso if any of these steps fail and the SSD isn't bootable, you still have all of your data and everything still working on the HHD.\nAdditional experiences from the OP:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's good to have 3 live CDs/USB sticks - GParted Live, boot-repair, windows system repair, I needed all three of them\n\n*I ended up not converting the home partition, so I didn't use the rsync step\n\n*Be aware that on partition copying, the UUIDs (unique partition identifiers) stay the same. This is great because you don't have to edit the Ubuntu fstab, and Windows won't want to be activated again, but after the initial copying stage, for testing you should remove/unplug the HDD from the system, otherwise there exist multiple partitions with the same UUID. This would have unexpected results.\n\n*Useful tools for making bootable USB sticks (if you don't have a CD drive anymore) from live CD images are tuxboot, unetbootin, TotalMounter. Especially for the Windows system repair disk, this can be tricky - use TotalMounter to create it directly into an .iso, and e.g. this guide.\n\n", "Q: How to get Nautilus \"real\" compact mode in Ubuntu 13.04? Ubuntu 13.04 have fully absent compact mode. Nautilus allows only icon view and list view. \nList view isn't the same as compact mode - well, it's easy to switch off unneeded columns, but what about multicolumn files display? \nIs it possible to return habitual compact mode back?\n\nA: Unfortunately, there were a bunch of features removed by the developers of Nautilus with version 3.6, which is included by default in Ubuntu 13.04. Among those was the \"compact view\". Now only the regular icon view and the list view are available. To my knowledge there is no way to re-enable it, short of changing the code and compiling Nautilus yourself (well beyond my own ability).\nThe \"bug\" showing where compact mode was removed\nDiscussion on the GNOME mailing list\nEdit:\nOne way to get the feature back is to downgrade Nautilus. The easiest way to do so is to add a PPA managed by webupd8.org, which will install a patched version of the older Nautilus 3.4.\nRun these commands in a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/experiments\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nkillall nautilus\n\nFor a full description of the patched version (and how to remove it), see here:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2013/04/get-nautilus-34-features-back-in-ubuntu.html\nN.B.: The instructions contain a warning, namely that if the dist-upgrade command attempts to remove packages, there is a problem and you should not continue. Otherwise things should be fine.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 13.10 the PPA webupd8team/experiments does not work any more, however it is possible to install nemo from webupd8team/nemo, which works even better. The full description may be found at http://www.webupd8.org/2013/10/install-nemo-with-unity-patches-and.html. The installation commands in terminal are:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/nemo\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nemo nemo-fileroller\n\n\nA: Doesnt really answer your question but at least that made it a but more bearable for me:\nYou can go to View => Icons, then hold your CTRL key and mousewheel down.

DRM stands for \"Direct Rendering Manager\", which is the kernelspace portion of the \"Direct Rendering Infrastructure\" (DRI). The DRI is currently used on Linux to provide hardware-accelerated OpenGL drivers.\n\nSo I would assume... no, unless you want to research if they are used somewhere.

How do I open the dash when a fullscreen window has the focus?\nI have seen this problem in 12.10 and 13.04 with Unity3D.\n\nA: Actually, when you press the \"super\" key when a full screen application is in focus, the dash opens, but it can't gain \"paint\" focus, as the application is still at the top of the stack. But strangely, the dash has the keyboard focus.\nAs far as I know, there is no way to see the dash when a full screen application is working.

I have been using the development version of 13.04 since early March. In development release, the general behavior of running the sudo apt-get update command is to download the list files completely if they have been changed. Whereas, if one uses the Stable version of Ubuntu, the command just downloads the diff of the list files if they have been changed (rsync style).\nBasically, in development versions sudo apt-get update downloads about 17-18 MB of data; whereas in stable versions only about 1 MB of data gets downloaded (except for the initial run).\nNow since 13.04 has been released as Stable, I would like to change the behavior of sudo apt-get update to mimic its normal behavior in a Stable release. How do I make this happen?\n\nA similar question but for the Stable Release was earlier asked on Ask Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*the size of apt-get update lists is too big\nHowever, it was a bug in 12.04 which got fixed later on. But the answers given there are not feasible in my case. For Ubuntu+1 its not a bug, its a general behavior of Development releases. Anyways, I would go through the answers provided there:\n\n\n*\n\n*The answer by John S Gruber asks to touch the relevant files before I run the command (sudo apt-get update) everytime. It's definitely not feasible in my case. That answer was okay for that question since it was a bug in 12.04 and it provided a temporary fix in that situation.\n\n*The answer by Chan-Ho Suh asks to change the update mirrors. This wouldn't solve the problem in a Development Release.\n\n*The answer by Anwar was also a temporary fix for that situation. It assumes I would run sudo apt-get update command only after adding a PPA and so asks to disable the other repositories. This is not feasible in my case since I obviously want to update all the repositories. I don't necessarily run this command only after adding a PPA. I run this command on a daily basis to install any updates released by Canonical. I use sudo apt-get update as a subsitute for Software Center.\n\nSo here it is. How do I restore the normal behavior of sudo apt-get update command to download only the diff of the changed files? Hopefully, the same solution would work for Software Center as well, since Software Center also consumes similar amount of bandwidth if I update using it.\nI definitely do not want to re-install 13.04 just to restore this behavior.\n\nOutput of sudo apt-get update in case it matters:\n$ sudo apt-get update\nHit http://dl.google.com stable Release.gpg                                    \nHit

Updates now get uploaded as new packages entering the raring-updates and raring-security pockets.\nFrom apt's point of view, the raring package list was downloaded in full every time apt-get update was run during development (unless it was called two times or more within the half hour window in between upstream updates). This is a large list, so it took some time.\nNow that Raring is released, the raring package list no longer changes. The raring-updates and raring-security package lists do change, but these are much smaller, since they only contain packages that have \"changed\" in Raring since Raring's release.\nI can see this behaviour in your apt output in your question. It looks just as expected: the raring pocket is just getting Hit with no download; the Get against raring-updates and raring-security corresponds to actual downloads. Edit: looking again, it looks like some files are being unnecessarily re-downloaded; see my other answer.\nIf this is too slow for you, consider using a faster mirror, or dropping the rather large list of PPAs you have there. You could also drop the deb-src lines from sources.list if you don't need the source available to apt-get.\nI don't believe that you'd see behaviour any different if you had installed this release directly.\n\nA: Another possibility is that you are using a mirror that does not preserve timestamps, or a corrupt local apt cache, causing apt to re-download files every time that have not actually changed in the mirror. Try this answer to clear your local cache, and switch to a mirror that does preserve timestamps.\n", "Q: Will conventional programs run on Ubuntu Touch? I'm verry happy about the massage, that we will get a tablet version for Ubuntu!\nNow I ask myself if the conventional programs like LibreOffice, OpenOffice, VLC Player, Thunderbird or other run on Ubuntu tablet? Or will be there the same Problems like Windows has with Windows RT, that it is required to have a version of the program that is programmed only for tablets. \n\nA: The answer of that question may decide the Ubuntu role in tablets market. So far, only the windows 8 tablet has an office software on tablet market. If Ubuntu comes with a whole LibreOffice suite on their tablets, it could be a hit, a big hit!\nEverybody wants to use their tables as notebooks, the big problem is the keyboard and, mainly, the office suit.\n\nA: It all boils down to the CPU architecture used in the tablet. Most likely it will be ARM .  \nIn this case software will need to be recompiled/ported. With open-source software this is easy (most of the software will compile with no problems in ARM architecture), but with closed-source software you will need to wait for the developer to build it on ARM.  \nIf the tablet runs on a x86 CPU, existing software should work (though it might not be tablet-ready).\n", "Q: How to show full date and time in Nautilus/Files 3.6+ list view?

For those inclined to try - if any issue found contact me thru launchpad email.\nThe \"Modified (full)\" column can be added thru nautilus in listview > View > Visible Columns..  or thru nautilus > Edit > Preferences > List Columns\nhttps://launchpad.net/~mc3man/+archive/nauty-mods\nRead ppa page for info & how to easily revert if need be.\n\nA: Nemo is a fork of Nautilus that includes Creation date and a button for Ctrl+L.\nsudo apt install nemo\n\nTo replace Nautilus for Documents links etc.:\nxdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory application/x-gnome-saved-search\n\nThat updates your mime settings:\n$ cat ~/.config/mimeapps.list |grep inode\ninode/directory=nemo.desktop\ninode/directory=exo-file-manager.desktop;\n$ cat /etc/gnome/defaults.list |grep inode\ninode/directory=org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop\n\n\nA: You can get back the full date by recompiling nautilus:\nsudo apt-get build-dep nautilus\nsudo apt-get install quilt\nexport QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches\napt-get source nautilus\ncd nautilus*\nquilt new 999_full_dates.patch\nquilt edit libnautilus-private/nautilus-column-utilities.c\n\nChange line 77 from\n\"attribute\", \"date_modified\",\n\nto\n\"attribute\", \"date_modified_full\",\n\nRebuild and install modified package:\nquilt refresh\nfakeroot dpkg-buildpackage\ncd ..\nkillall nautilus\nsudo dpkg -i nautilus_*.deb\nnautilus &\n\nAs always, you have to perform these steps every time there is an update for nautilus in Ubuntu.\nNow, a full analysis of the problem:\nThe actual patch which caused this change is this one.\nThe function nautilus_file_get_date_as_string gains an extra gboolean parameter \"compact\" - when true the abbreviated date is returned.\nThis function is never called directly - it is accessed through the wrapper function nautilus_file_get_string_attribute_q. This function takes attribute parameters like \"date_modified\". To accommodate the new signature of nautilus_file_get_date_as_string a new attribute is added \"date_modified_full\". After this change, any code in nautilus which uses the file date string will get the abbreviated date.\nFinally, the file properties dialog is updated to use \"date_modified_full\" attribute.\nSo in order to have nautilus display the full date in list view, it is only necessary to change one line of code: in libnautilus-private/nautilus-column-utilities.c, line 77 from \"date_modified\" to \"date_modified_full\".\nA slightly more useful patch could add a new column type which would show the full date, making this an optional feature, and only add 10 lines of code.\n\nA: This blog post shows a much easier solution. It is based on creating an extension which can be selected as an alternative \"modified column\". Tested under 16.04.\n\n*\n\n*gedit ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/longdate.py\n\n\n*Use this code (always copy code you trust):\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport os\nimport urllib\nimport datetime\nfrom gi.repository import Nautilus, GObject\n\nclass ColumnExtension(GObject.GObject, Nautilus.ColumnProvider, Nautilus.InfoProvider):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def get_columns(self):\n        return (Nautilus.Column(\n            name=\"NautilusPython::Longdate\", \n            attribute=\"longdate\", \n            label=\"Longdate\", \n            description=\"Get long date\"),)\n\n    def update_file_info(self, file):\n        if file.get_uri_scheme() != 'file':\n            return\n\n        filename = urllib.unquote(file.get_uri()[7:])\n        statbuf = os.stat(filename)\n        formatteddate = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(statbuf.st_mtime).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\n        file.add_string_attribute('longdate', str(formatteddate))\n\n\n\n*chmod +x ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/longdate.py\n\n\n*sudo apt install python-nautilus\n\n\n*nautilus -q and nautilus . to restart Nautilus and see if it properly loads the extension.\n\n\n*Select the new \"Longdate\" column in the list column preferences.\nThe result will look like this:\n\n", "Q: What version do I download for my Mac? I am trying to get it on my mac, so do I download the windows version onto a USB and then upload it from there because I can't find a mac version. \n\nA: Actually, the version of Ubuntu you download does matter, though there are not specific builds for Mac hardware vs. PC hardware.  Not all the versions are compatible with all the models of MacBook.  Fortunately, there is an awesome guide that breaks it down by model and tells you which versions will work.\nThis guide will also give you great instructions about improving compatibility with Mac hardware.  \nIf you have an Intel based Mac, you may want to install the Mactel Support Team PPA.  Follow the instructions for your specific model and you'll do fine.\n\nA: There are no differences for Mac or PC as far as the downloaded installer file goes. There are different directions for creating a bootable USB stick or DVD for each platform, so if you are using this on a Mac, follow the directions for either the USB stick or DVD. And you can always try Ubunutu before installing by following the directions here.\n\nA: Since Ubuntu is a separate operating system, you do not have to download a specific version for the operating system you are using prior to Ubuntu.\nYou just need to install a version that works on your hardware.  In most cases on recent hardware, this will be the 64-bit desktop version.\n", "Q: Why can't I connect to my wireless network at work? I can connect at home, but not at work.

If it does, you'll have to type those in a terminal each time you reboot.  I made it into a bash script that I just run when I first log in.  You may wish to do the same.\nEDIT:\nSince you're using a Broadcom card, you may try adding pof's PPA and installing his fixed driver.

As I don't use them very often, I want the F-keys to behave like the \"real\" F-keys (F1-F12). How can I do that?\nI know there is an option in the BIOS settings, but this only toggles the built-in keyboard of the notebook, not on my wireless keyboard.\nI know there is a way to change this for the Apple wireless keyboard (AppleKeyboard#Change_Function_Key_behavior), but there is no \"parameters\" directory in /sys/module/hid_logitech_dj/.\nAny ideas?

When making this slider go on odd numbers (e.g. 41, 43, 39), go can note a notable difference in the quality of the icons. This is because the launcher is saving resources on the quality when having smaller icons on the unity-bar, but why is unity doing this on all the odd-numbered sizes?\nQuestion\nHow can i make the icons remain big-resolouted when making odd-numbered icon-size? I have attached 2 screenshots to describe my problem where i used 40 and 39 as setting on the slider. and \nYou might want to zoom in on the pictures to watch the difference. And i am probably considering this as a bug; in 13.04.\n\nA: This isn't really a bug that can be fixed. The problem is that the icons are being scaled, because they are not drawn in every enumeration of pixel sizes that could be used. When you choose an odd pixel size, the scaling results in a blurrier icon than you would otherwise normally get when scaling to an even pixel size.\nIf anything, the bug is that the choice of icon size is a scale which selects absolute pixel sizes, rather than having a few sizes listed in the code, and described as 'Small', 'Medium', 'Large', etc… in the UI.\n", "Q: I'm installing ubuntu but stuck I've partitioned by hard drive, does that mean I have to put the program on my usb or cd whichever I choose.

My / and /home partitions work fine, but my other partitions are just not detected. I wouldn't mind, except the same problem goes with USB sticks.\nWhen I plug in a USB stick, the light goes on, but the computer detects nothing. Just to be clear, my mouse and keyboard are connected via USB and work fine.\nAny idea how to solve this issue? None of the suggestions I found on the internet have any effect.\n\nA: sudo lsusb will tell you what USB devices Linux detects. Whether a USB storage device mounts, or is detected, are separate issues. sudo lsusb -v will give verbose output, possibly more information than you want if the OS truly doesn't recognize the device.\nAlternatively, you could compare the lists of devices in /dev before and after plugging in the USB device. There are many ways to do it; I would probably just use:\nls -l /dev/* | wc -l\n\nThis will give you a number of recognized devices. Doing it before and after plugging in a device will tell you if the OS assigned the device in /dev/.\nAnother option would be to look at what is happening in dmesg when you plug in the USB device. dmesg may tell you things like how a device failed.\nIf the USB device you are having trouble mounting, is on the lsusb list, then you can try mounting the device. At this point it would be good to know the filesystem type. sudo fdisk -l will tell you the filesystem type, in the form of an ID. You may have to look up the ID number. There are lots of references online for that. Once you know the device listing, that is, /dev/hda1 and the filesystem type you can try to mount the device manualy with the mount command.\nsudo mount /dev/hda1 /home/user/Desktop/whereEver\n\nYou may have to make sure the location you want to mount the device on exists. If the OS recognizes the file system, then mount might just work if the file system is not a native file system type; you may have to specify flags for mounting.\nPost back your output from dmesg (not all of it, only from around when the USB device is plugged in), and sudo lsusb.\nYou may find Linux / UNIX: Device files helpful if trying to determine device type.\nI am writing this assuming all your unrecognized devices are block type devices.\nThere are many ways to approach this type of problem and many possible solutions. More specific information is needed to provide a solution.\nThere are also many GUI applications that can do the same thing. You might try looking for the plugged-in hardware in the \"Disk Utility\".\n\nA: You only mention one storage device type - usb stick. Whenever usb devices don't mount correctly check that you don't have package called usbmount installed. If it is, remove it and life should be back to normal after that (you might need to restart).\n\nA: Solution 1: Try the Disks program (if you run Ubuntu with a GUI).\n(check that the gnome-disk-utility package is installed)\n(make sure that udisks2 package is installed)\nHit SUPERA to open the Application Lens and type Disks in the Search Applications field.\n(SUPER is probably the key with the Windows icon.)\nIn Disks you can play with the automount options.     ......\nFor example:\n\nYou have to click on the little icon with the two gears and choose 'Edit Mount Options'.\n\nSolution 2: Using the CLI (for a headless installation)\nStep 1. Check the blockdevices and the file systems that are assigned to those block devices.\nlsblk\n\n\nHere you see the blokdevice sdb with partition /sdb1. But it's not mounted. There's no file assigned to it.\nStep 2. What kind of device is sdb?\nsudo lshw \n\nor\nsudo lshw | less\n\n\nSo the USB stick - the block device /sdb - has the logical name /dev/sdb. And the FAT32 filesystem on that stick has the logical name /dev/sdb1.\nStep 3. Mounting the USB-stick\nWe will mount /dev/sdb1 to /media/usbstick\nsudo mkdir /media/usbstick\n\nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/usbstick \n\nRead the manpage of mount for other options.\nStep 4. Did it work?\nlsblk\n\n\nYes, we can see that the filesystem on the USB stick is mounted to /media/usbstick\nAddendum : if there are no logical names like /dev/sdb, you should first create them.  See this information about setting up and controling loop devices with the losetup command\n\nA: Manually Mount a USB Drive\nA USB storage device plugged into the system usually mounts automatically, but if for some reasons it doesn't automount, it's possible to manually mount it with these steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T to run Terminal.\n\n*Enter sudo mkdir /media/usb to create a mount point called usb.\n\n*Enter sudo fdisk -l to look for the USB drive already plugged in, let's say the drive you want to mount is /dev/sdb1.\n\n*To mount a USB drive formatted with FAT16 or FAT32 system, enter:\nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/usb -o uid=1000,gid=100,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137\n\nOR, To mount a USB drive formatted with NTFS system, enter:\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/usb\n\nTo unmount it, just enter sudo umount /media/usb in the Terminal.\nsource\n\nA: I too had similar situation where my pen drive became invisible.\nI solved it by  using the Ubuntu utility program named Disks. Inside the disk tool, the pen drive was visible.

I had to \"cd /home/server/Desktop/minecraft/craftbukkit.sh\" to get to the location (Within the terminal) and then do \"/home/server/Desktop/minecraft/craftbukkit.sh\" to run the files.

I've recently upgraded from Precise to Raring and noticed that Nautilus 3.6, when displaying files and folders in list mode, no longer has alternating grey lines (there's probably a better name for these, but I don't know it; see pictures below). This used to be the default, and helped me to easily distinguish between particular files and their attributes. \nIs there a way to reenable this? Is it maybe theme dependent?\nThe old list view with clearly demarcated lines:\n\nThe new, unclear list view:\n\n\nA: The alternate row styling is simply commented out in the Ubuntu default themes.\nEditing the theme file\nLook for the /gtk-3.0/gtk-widgets.css file within your favorite theme.\n\n\n*\n\n*Custom themes that you installed should be located in ~/.themes (the home folder)\n\n*The default Ubuntu themes are located in /usr/share/themes/.\n\n\nUbuntu 14.04 (Nautilus, Nemo)\nEdit the gtk-widgets.css file in your theme folder. So with the Ubuntu default theme for example, that would be /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk-widgets.css. Find the following css rule around line  ~2224, and add your chosen background color:\nview row:nth-child(even){\n  /*background-color: @base_color;*/\n  background-color: #ECF2FD;  /* <-- add this  */\n}   \n\nUbuntu 13.04\nFor example, if you are using Ambiance then the file to edit is located at /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk-widgets.css.\nUncomment the rules at approx. line 2181, from:\nGtkTreeView row:nth-child(odd) {\n  /*background-color: shade (@base_color, 0.965);*/\n}\n\nTo:\nGtkTreeView row:nth-child(odd) {\n  background-color: shade (@base_color, 0.965);\n}\n\nOr use a #RRGGBB colour, the classic OS X light blue colour for example:\nGtkTreeView row:nth-child(odd) {\n  background-color: #ECF2FD;\n}\n\nEditing those rules will work for Nautilus 3.6, as well as Nemo. Nemo, by default, will not show alternating row styles as it will be using the Ubuntu themes.\nNote that after editing the file you may have to close and reopen the file browser. If it doesn't work, try relogging. The themes appear to be cached so even if you switch themes with Ubuntu-tweak, it may not display the change immediately.\nUsing an alternative theme\nIf you prefer to avoid editing the files you can use an alternative theme.

Because your monitor and laptop are unable to find a common HDMI resolution you are getting over scan. The only solution is to add an HDMI/VGA adapter to  your set up. Audio output will still be through HDMI, however, the HDMI video output will be converted to VGA. Set your monitor to receive VGA input and you should end up with your monitors maximum native resolution, with everything fitting the way it should.\n", "Q: Can't modify Intel wireless settings due to \"FATAL: Module iwlagn not found.\" error I upgraded my machine to 13.04 this morning, and now it won't connect to my Wifi.

For instructions for installing the proprietary drivers, please see Ubuntu Quantal Installation Guide. If you go to main page, you will also see instructions for 12.04 and 13.04.\nThe instructions link to a workaround for hybrid graphics. \nBe sure to follow the sections titled Before you start and Removing the driver before installing a new driver.\nYou may have to try both the workaround and installing the driver from the Catalyst website to see which one works for your computer.

My problem I can not create new database  using both sql command and phpmyadmin. In phpmyadmin database creation input box is not shown and sql command is not works. Here I use sql command as \n CREATE DATABASE my_db\n\nBut I can easily create table and run other sql command as like windows. How can I solve this problem.\n\nA: If you are running the standard MySQL installation (I'm not sure what XAMPP installs) I've found it rather easy to use the MySQL GUI Tools to handle some of the administration tasks for MySQL. MySQL Server Administrator allows for the creation of databases, tables, users, setting privileges and much more. It can be run from another computer on your network and only requires that you have either root or admin user privileges for MySQL.\n\nA: To create a database, your user needs the appropriate privileges. A lot of shared hosting providers only give you one database.\nWhen your user does not have the correct permissions, PHPMyAdmin will detect this and hide the buttons/commands to do this.\nWhen not on shared hosting, your username needs the global privilege 'create' to create a database.\nA user with the 'grant' privilege needs to give you this privilege.\n", "Q: How do I enable the user dynamic wallpaper in the login screen of Ubuntu 13.04?

I am using Ubuntu 13.04 since today and I am missing the split screen function in Nautilus. Is there any way to patch Nautilus so that this amazing function is usable again?\n\nA: Among other features that were unfortunately removed in Nautilus 3.6 (used by Ubuntu 13.04 by default) was the extra pane/split screen, invoked using F3. It was removed because the GNOME developers thought it didn't work well on touch screens and that placing one Nautilus to one side of the screen with another to the opposite side fulfilled the same purpose. It doesn't, but I'm not a developer! Links to the bug and the commit. \nOne way to get the feature back is to install a patched version of the older Nautilus 3.4. The easiest way to do so is to add a PPA managed by the good people at webupd8.org. Unfortunately this patch version is only available for Ubuntu 12.04 and the now-unsupported 12.10 and 13.04 releases.\nRun these commands in a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/experiments\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nkillall nautilus\n\nN.B.: The instructions contain a warning, namely that if the dist-upgrade command attempts to remove packages, there is a problem and you should not continue. Otherwise things should be fine.\n\nFor Ubuntu 14.04 you'll need to patch Nautilus manually. This answer can get you started, but unfortunately I can't find what to patch exactly.\nThe simplest option is to change file managers. Nemo is quite similar to what Nautilus used to be. Yet Another User mentions below that it is in the repositories, but this webupd8.org PPA will install the newest version:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/nemo\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nemo nemo-fileroller\n\n\nA: The version of Nautilus that came with Ubuntu 12.10 had the split screen. So you can consider to downgrade Nautilus to that older version.\nYou will need Synaptic Package Manager. If you don't have it, because normally it comes not with a default Ubuntu installation, you can download it from the Ubuntu Software Center.\nBut there's a little problem. If you've only one version of a package, you can't force another version. So, if you're in Ubuntu 13.04 (raring) you need to add the software repository from Ubunt 12.10 (quantal).\nThe easiest way to add that repository is with the Software & Upgrades Programs. In that program you choose the tab 'Other Software' and 'Add'.\nIn the popup screen you add on the APT line:\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu quantal main\n\nand save. Now you have to open Synaptic Package Manager and hit the Reload button.\nSelect the Nautilus Package, and hit Ctrl-E or in the menu select Package - Force version. Then select the version of Nautilus that came with Ubuntu 12.10\nYou will see other packages that have to be downgraded.\nTo keep that downgraded version, so it's not updated anymore, you have to lock it. So in the menu choose Package - Lock Version.\nTo start Nautilus in its downgraded version, you have to logout, and to login.\nThat's all!\nI used information that I found originally on this page.\n\nA: I think that The Gnome Developers are not in correct path. I use Nautilus in PC, no in a tablet!\nMy workaround: I installed \"SunFlower File Manager\" : \n\nA: Googling around I found a couple of interesting links:\na patch to bring back some nautilus features. (This this patch is only intended for use with Ubuntu 12.04 and Nautilus 3.4.2)\nSome discussion about it at Ubuntu\na fork from mint guys\na list of missing features (and a poll)\nSo it seems that the nautilus affaire has been discussed in lenght, I wonder what decision the Ubuntu dev team finnally made...\n\nA: There are two workarounds I've found to approximate this feature.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the tiling features in Unity:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus.\n\n*Hit Super-Ctrl-Left Arrow to tile the window to the left edge of the screen.\n\n*Hit Ctrl-N to open a new window and navigate to the target directory.\n\n*Hit Super-Ctrl-Right Arrow to tile the window to the right edge of the screen.\n\n*Drag and drop your files back and forth. \n\n\n*You can also select the folder you want to \"split\" into and do a Ctrl-T to open a new tab. Then either drop files into the tab or tear off the tab into a new window. \n\nA: To restore all of the features that they \"rem(impr)oved\" in nautilus 3.6, the simplest way is to install Nemo, which was forked by the Mint developers because of the removed features. Because it's included in ubuntu 13.04, you don't need to add any extra apt repository. Just sudo apt-get install nemo is enough. It uses the same icon we used to see for nautilus 3.4.\n\nA: There's been a nice article at webupd8 with a tutorial how.\nLong story short: Install the (SolusOS) patched Nautilus 3.4\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/experiments\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nkillall nautilus\n\n\nA: The quickest workaround approximation I have found in 13.04 is a two step process:\n1) drag title bar of open nautilus window to an edge of the screen (left or right)\n2) hit Ctrl + N\nThe default behaviour of the New window is to open in the remaining space.\nStill twice as many steps as F3 but tolerable if you don't want to go through a downgrade or patch.\n", "Q: How can I alter the next/previous tab shortcut in Terminal?

This can be accomplished with sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.\n\nA: Uninstalling the meta package will not uninstall kubuntu from your computer. It will just remove the meta package itself and all other KDE stuff will remain in your computer. So, speaking from experience, a fresh install seems to be the least painful option.\n\nA: Just backup your data and do fresh installation.

correct. Now another issue: I restarted connection, lost it, when I plugged wire of and on again TP-Link listed my Ubuntu with correct IP 192.168.0.200 under DHCP Clients List and in ARP List there is my Ubuntu Mac mapped into this IP so it seems likr TP-Link sees and recognizes my host correctly but host itself says no connection, again: kill dhcpcd eth0 and start it again gives me info that on host IP is configured correctly. However this time I did kill instead of -9 and I have info:\n\ninterface eth0 has been configured with new IP=192.168.0.202\n\ninstead of 192.168.0.200\nLog info from syslog:\nApr 26 13:40:53 myhost

Second, your description is hard to parse, but it sounds like you have two routers, one plugged into the other.  You shouldn't do that.  My guess is that you have the second router connected to the first on a regular port, rather than the second router's WAN/UPLINK port.  If you do that, you have to disable the routing/NAT/DHCP functions in the second router.  Otherwise, you need to use the WAN/UPLINK port to connect it to the upstream router.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 not detect the HDMI sound output So, I have maded the upgrade to ubuntu v.13.04, but, when I have maded this, my HDMI sound otuput sttoped to work... and, the HDMI sound device not appers any more on sound preferences :(\nWhen I run lspci:\n    00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor DRAM Controller (rev 09)\n    00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n    00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB xHCI Host Controller (rev 04)\n    00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family MEI Controller #1 (rev 04)\n    00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #2 (rev 04)\n    00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 04)\n    00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 1 (rev c4)\n    00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 2 (rev c4)\n    00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #1 (rev 04)\n    00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation HM77 Express Chipset LPC Controller (rev 04)\n    00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series Chipset Family 6-port SATA Controller [AHCI mode] (rev 04)\n    00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family SMBus Controller (rev 04)\n    01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

If anyone answers now, I'll also add a bounty when it's available (in 2 days, I think).\n\nA: My Vaio VPCSA had a similar problem.\nI replaced a line in /etc/defalut/grub (1):\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"video.allow_duplicates=1 radeon.modeset=1\"\n\nIt fixed the problem for Ubuntu 12.10. However, that's not enough for Debian/unstable.\nIn addition, I had to add a line to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf (2):\nblacklist radeon\n\nAnd to /etc/rc.local BEFORE exit 0; (3):\nmodprobe radeon modeset=1\nmount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug/\necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nIf you have issues, start with (2). It has reliably resulted in a bootable system, than proceed with (3).\n\nA: Well. lets see if we can fix this.\nFirst of all I would definitely see if there is a BIOS update for the laptop, and install it, so you can disable the Intel 4000 built-in graphics, and be able to use the AMD 7750M.\n(On an unrelated issue, unfortunately, you can't use both cards at the same time.  Referring to Nvidia SLI And AMD CrossfireX).\nI'm just supplying an answer so maybe this can help you use you laptop.\nNow, AMD has release new drivers for your card as of 4/24/2013.  I don't know if these are the drivers that you've tried. To download these drivers if you haven't tried them click here. \nAlso Intel has a new driver dated 5/3/2013, to download click here \nNow having worked with HP a while back, I have to say that they are slow when it comes to having fixes done to there systems.  A request has been made by many to have this issue ( the ability to switch between cards), and nothing has been done so far. \nI know this may not be the answer that you're looking for, but I hope that it can help you at least in being able to use your laptop.\n", "Q: problems with slow pocessor laptop There is something that bothers me a lot a it-s that: I have an Compaq Presario CQ43 172LA, this PC works with an 1.5GHZ AMD E/240 and AMD HD 6310 APU and 1.6 DDR3 ram memory.

I recently got IPv6 connectivity at home and now I would like to allow connections to my home server via IPv6 from the LAN only. The trick is that the IPv6 address/prefix assigned to the server is dynamic. Is there some way to write a UFW rule that allows only from directly connected subnets?\n\nA: Old question, but Google got me here so I think it's worth noting that you could add the IPv6 link-local range with:\nufw allow from fe80::/64\n\nIf you're connecting across the LAN then the link-local address should get used instead of your global IPv6 address.\n\nA: Keep in mind there are no IPv6 \"local ranges\" - each IPv6 \"local range\" is its own (at least) /64 segment of v6 addresses in a specifically defined prefix.  As such, any 'private range' address you receive is going to be specific to the subnet your router sets you up on rather than the external v6 address you have (there's logic inside routers to set up the subnets automatically, but when you get into Enterprise-grade routing with advanced firewalls, routers, switches, etc., IPv6 has to be manually configured by hand and set up.\nWhen you add into the equation that you will quite possibly (and frequently) have a changing subnet all the time, there is no way to accept them all dynamically without accepting all IPv6 inbound connections - at least on a consumer-grade network setup (with a much-more-complicated and much-more-expensive firewall appliance, you can explicitly do VLAN separation to prevent things from communicating with the outside and accept only internal v6, but you can't do this on consumer-grade router technologies).\nAs well, firewall rules are designed in ufw (and the underlying iptables and netfilter technologies which ufw works with) to have specific rules (such as ALLOW aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd::dead:beef INBOUND TO dddd:eeee:ffff:0000::dead:beef PORT 22/tcp (obviously not a rule, but just an example)) and if you are always having different addresses on different v6 subnets, (either internally or externally, but especially internally), it breaks the requirements that firewalls have for those kinds of rules.\nYou would therefore need to know all the subnets you'll get, and add a ufw rule that would be for each individual subnet.  If that subnet is always changing and you do not know which subnet you will get, then you can't reliably create a firewall rule in any setup that can do what you're looking to accomplish on a dynamic ever-changing basis.  \nThis also applies to port-forwarding at home - you can't reliably set up a port forward UNLESS the internal IP address (v4 or v6) isn't going to change.  (The router transparently handles INBOUND from the internet, on its own, so long as you set up the internal v6 in a static setup, but you can't guarantee this will happen without much more time-consuming network configuration and setups, and possibly more enterprise-grade level equipment which can get expensive)\n", "Q: Is Vim-gnome FuzzyFinder plugin broken since Ubuntu 13.04? After Ubuntu 13.04 installation I simply unzip an archive with all my gvim setup, ie.\n.vim/\n.vim-fuf\n.viminfo\n.vimrc\n\nAfter doing a clean install of Ubuntu 13.04, I unzipped my Vim config as usual.

I'm on 7.3.547.\nThe .vim folder is extremely portable, I've used it accross Windows, LinuxMint, Mac OS, and never came across this error, which is why I am wondering if this could be an error in the Vim build itself.\nUpdate I also deleted .vim-fuf and .viminfo just in case, and the error stills appears.\n\nA: I fixed the issue by downloading the latest version of FuzzyFinder (v4.2.2) as well as the dependency L9 Vim script library (v1.1).\nI honestly have no idea why it would stop working after updating to Ubuntu 13.04 (from 12.10). As said in question, I unzip the same .vim/ archive I use between various OS and never had this issue. It was working in 12.10 this morning. I checked the archive for errors, there were none.\nSo I guess something must have changed in the Vim build or the environment in 13.04.\n", "Q: Increase mouse wheel scroll speed As the title says, I want to increase the number of rows that are passed when I use the mouse wheel for scrolling. I know that there exists ways to do that for Firefox and Chromium, although I want something for the entire system, mainly because of the PDF reader.\nI am on a Desktop and use a Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000.\n\nA: Note that using the ~/.imwheelrc recommended in the accepted answer does not actually increase the scroll wheel speed. Rather, it replaces scrolling  with multiple arrow key strokes.  This has the disadvantage of not being able to scroll a window until you change focus to it, not the default behavior.  This answer aims to provide an alternative that behaves more closely to the native behavior.\nTo provide a concise answer for Ubuntu >14.04 (combining the answers from @tvm and @redanimalwar with the comment from @aroll605), it seems the best option to actually increase the scroll wheel speed is to install imwheel and configure it by following these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Install imwheel by running:\nsudo apt install imwheel\n\n(replace apt with apt-get depending on your system)\n\n\n*Edit ~/.imwheelrc:\ngedit ~/.imwheelrc\n\nand paste:\n \".*\"\n None,      Up,   Button4, 3\n None,      Down, Button5, 3\n Control_L, Up,   Control_L|Button4\n Control_L, Down, Control_L|Button5\n Shift_L,   Up,   Shift_L|Button4\n Shift_L,   Down, Shift_L|Button5\n\nYou should try different values for # in the lines:\n None,      Up,   Button4, #\n None,      Down, Button5, #\n\n\n\n*To test the settings use the command:\nkillall imwheel && imwheel -b \"4 5\"\n\n\n\n*Open Startup Applications and add:\nimwheel -b \"4 5\"\n\nNote that using the option -b \"4 5\" restricts imwheel to only affect the scroll wheel, discussed here.\n\nA: imwheel will emit double scroll events in chrome, which is annoying\nFor i3wm and libinput users, I suggest libinput_patch, which gives an entry to change scroll delta in real time, and is much better in my use case\n\nA: I also wanted to increase the mouse scroll wheel acceleration, and not just the absolute speed. This is a feature in MacOSX but not builtin for Xorg (also Wayland) yet.\nI implemented such a feature in user space here (mouse-scroll-wheel-acceleration-userspace).\nThis will increase the scroll speed, or accelerate the scroll speed.\nYou would just run this in the background, with your preferred options.\nThe code is quite simple Python code, and should be easy to modify as well.\nInstallation:\n# get the tool\ngit clone https://github.com/albertz/mouse-scroll-wheel-acceleration-userspace.git\ncd mouse-scroll-wheel-acceleration-userspace\n\n# install Python dependencies\npip3 install --user -r requirements.txt  # (basically pynput)\n\n# run the tool\n./main.py -v --exp 1  # example flags. see --help\n# (leave this running in background)\n\n\nA: // Edit\nAs this gets some upvotes from time to time:\nI not use this anymore (out of laziness after reinstalls) and I now think this script the slider and stuff is too much overhead. Also people have pointed out issues with this over time. So as a minimalistic guy I now created the config myself. Its probably a one time thing for most people.\nI have edited this to be a 4 step guide with everything you need.\nAnd another update: Since I switched to KDE, that actually has a setting for this and a million others things Gnome does not (Not even realized how much i missed KDE). The issue is that KDE mouse settings have actually have no effect on Firefox (and other GTK apps I assume) but since my main purpose for this was actually web browsing I now found out that you can actually tweak how much the mouse scrolls in Firefox itself.\nabout:config\nmousewheel.default.delta_multiplier_y\n\nI set it to 600 and its perfect for me\n// End Edit\nThe accepted answer has a config that for whatever reason maps the scrolling to UP and DOWN on the keyboard.

I just unplugged it and plugged it in again and it worked like before.\nSo if the speed changed between restarts without you doing anything, this might be worth trying.\n\nA: My two cents: my Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic mouse was scrolling about half a page at a time on Ubuntu 15.04 (Lenovo ThinkPad x220), which was really annoying me. I tried various solutions, but ended up having the idea of disconnecting the mouse from the USB port (the wireless dongle thing) and reconnecting it. Voila!...\"normal\" scrolling speeds ensued :). Hope that helps somebody.\n\nA: Beforehand\nWith the currently used input driver system it is not possible to change the scroll speed of your mouse, at least not without drawbacks. You are able to adjust the scroll speed for Qt-Applications using a KDE Settings but the only current way to change the scrolling in a generic fashion is by using imwheel which seems to be problematic in many ways (see comments). In the future this will be fixed with libinput and the systemd hardware database.\nCurrent Way\nInstall imwheel with the following command or from the Software Center:\n$ sudo apt-get install imwheel\n\nCreate (if necessary) and edit the configfile ~/.imwheelrc with an editor of your choice (e.g. gedit). Fill in the following for increasing the scroll speed for every Command. NB: This configuration file will apply these new scroll settings to all programs, (including the terminal, which may not be what you want).\n\".*\"\nNone,       Up,     Up,     3\nNone,       Down,   Down,   3\n\nIf you want to only apply these settings to Chrome, for instance, use these settings instead:\n\".*-chrome*\"\nNone,       Up,     Up,     3\nNone,       Down,   Down,   3\n\nThe 3 is a scroll multiplier to increase the effectiveness of the scroll wheel. In the README of the project it is called \"REPS\". The readme states: \n\n[ REPS ]\nReps (Repetitions) lets you say a number for how many times you want the output keysyms to be pressed.  See the chart on the default bindings for the default number of reps for each modifier-combo (The chart is near the end of this document).\n\nIn other words, it is a scroll multiplier. If REPS is set to 3, that means that when your mouse wheel commands one scroll command, the software intercepts this command and sends 3 commands to the PC instead of 1, thereby making it scroll 3 times farther, or \"faster\".\nFor more information also take a look at the manpage:\n$ man imwheel\n\nor refer to the README of the project.\nYou can start imwheel by typing:\n$ imwheel\n\nBe sure that you don't start the imwheel twice! That's a known bug, but you can stop imwheel with the command:\n$ killall imwheel\n\nTo get imwheel to automatically start every time your computer boots, you must add it to the startup menu AFTER an x-window is loaded. IMPORTANT: since imwheel relies on an x-window to already be running, it will NOT work if you add it to crontab, /etc/init.d, or /etc/rc.local. That means you must do it this way instead:\nUbuntu:\nUse the \"Startup Applications\" GUI editor to Add imwheel as a Startup Program: https://askubuntu.com/a/48327/327339\nXubuntu:\nUse the \"Session and Startup\" GUI editor --> Application Autostart --> Add to add imwheel as a startup program. \n\nMore screenshots here: https://askubuntu.com/a/369443/327339.\nFuture\nThis tutorial is currently under development.\nlibinput seems to be included with Wily Werewolf (15.10) where you need to install the package xserver-xorg-input-libinput. After you installed libinput with\n$ sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-libinput\n\nit should be used for every input after you restarted the Xorg (logout would be sufficient). Now that you are using libinput you are able to adjust the settings of your mouse. You can find a full tutorial in the file /lib/udev/hwdb.d/70-mouse.hwdb. Let me cover here only the basics.\nThe following steps are need to be done as root. Because of that I am friendliy reminding you that everything you do you need to take responibility.\nFirst get the vendor id <vid> and the product id <pid> using lsusb.

G3 (MX518) Optical Mouse\n\nThe <vid> is 046d and the <pid> is c051.\nThen create a File that looks like the following with gksudo gedit /etc/udev/hwdb.d/71-mouse-local.hwdb\nmouse:usb:v<vid>p<pid>:name:*:\n    MOUSE_WHEEL_CLICK_ANGLE=??\n\nFor example this file for the Logitech MX 518 example above:\nmouse:usb:v046dpc051:name:*:\n    MOUSE_WHEEL_CLICK_ANGLE=30\n\nThis file sets the mouse wheel click angle to 30° (default is usually 15). To use this setting, update the hwdb with the following commands:\nudevadm hwdb --update\nudevadm trigger /dev/input/event${id}\n\nOne can figure out the ${id} using xinput (look out for the id of your mouse) and then run xinput list-props ${xinput_id}.\n\nA: While the above imwheel suggestions helped a bit, I found that removing the mechanical scroll-clicking mechanism made my mouse wheel much more pleasant to use -- not only removing the click, but making it faster and more precise to control!\nAnd it only took 3 minutes - check out these instructions:\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/Making-a-mouse-wheel-not-click./\nIn a nutshell, you're removing this left spring (be careful to get the right spring back in place exactly):\n\nNote: I have a standard, cheap mouse - a Logitech B100, others report success on similar models.

Then, when you try to run google-chrome it \"thinks\" that there is another active instance running and doesn't run the program (I'm assuming that you had verified in the list of processes that are no running instances of google-chrome).\nSOLUTION\nIn this case, the basic solution is rename or delete these files, \"SingletonLock\", \"SingletonCookie\" and \"SingletonSocket\", and run google-chrome again. It will create these three files again and will run normally.\n\nA: If you don't find the Singleton* files discussed in other answers, another source of this error is exhaustion of disk space.\nTry df -h to see how much space you have left on your partitions; if any are full, free up some space and try again.\n\nA: Another solution that has worked is to remove  \ninclude \"/usr/share/themes/oxygen-gtk/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\"\n\nif the line is in your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file\n\nA: There is another reason for this issue:\nMaking a backup of all your files in your user folder, and keep that backup locally at say /local_backups/... (for later transfer, etc.) might cause chromium to behave the same way.\nIn this scenario there are not Singleton* files in folder, but it interferes with some files in the backup. (Don't ask me how...)\nI resolved this issue by removing the backup.\nThen it worked again.\nHope this helps anybody...\n\nA: In my case, the system disk (which has a journaling file system, etx4, so I'm a little surprised at that) was corrupted at shutdown, and fsck -a did not recover that.  That's actually a hard problem to find, so try touch /test.txt and if the file system is write locked, touch will tell you.  Running fsck to repair corruption in a file system is beyond the scope of this answer but the literature on fsck is vast and I recommend you read it either before you need it or else on another computer that is working.\nTL,DR:\nFor you newbies, here is how to figure out some of the other questions that were posed in this thread, for future reference:\nTo get the operating system name and version number:\n$ uname -a\nTo get the release or the version of the distribution:\n$ cat /etc/lsb-release\nSomebody suggested changing a directory to give everybody read/write/lookup access to a directory.  That should not be necessary, but if it is, it is.  First, see what the protection actually is and then change it.\n$ ls -ld ~/.config/google-chrome/\ndrwx------. 30 jeffs jeffs 12288 Jan 11 16:09 google-chrome/\n$ chmod 777 google-chrome/\n\nAt this point, test if that fixes the problem.  If not, then use chmod to set it back to the original value:\n$ chmod 700 google-chrome/\n\nI'm annoyed that the error message is so misleading, and I would consider that to be a bug in Google Chrome.\n\nA: Reason you got this error is, \nyou don't have permission to /home/$USER/.config/google-chrome/SingletonLock this path.\nFollow below steps it worked for me,\n\n\n*\n\n*go inside /home/$USER/.config folder (cd /home/$USER/.config)\n\n*Give all the permission to google-chrome (sudo chmod 777 google-chrome)\n\n*Run google chrome(google-chrome)\n\n\nHope this would help.\n", "Q: New kernel does not work properly I installed kernel version 3.8.8 from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/. but after the installation when I booted using the new kernel nothing seemed to work.

You may also want to remove and replace your notebook's CPU if you have the technical expertise to do so. The thermal paste Dell used on inspiron notebooks gets old after some time.  Removing the CPU, cleaning the past off of it and the heatsink and applying a better thermal paste (like Artic Silver) then reinstalling the CPU and heatsink could really bring your temps down.

While using Ubuntu, my approach is to gather just enough knowledge to enable me to use Ubuntu in all ways that I can use Windows. Therefore I focus on approaches to problem rather than the technical aspects involved in its implementation. Fortunately there are many users who provide help on technical aspects. Accordingly I am attempting to suggest an approach and also offer some justifications.\nI use Ubuntu 12.10 along with default LO 3.6. version as updated by Ubuntu. I will stick with 12.10 till LTS 14.04 around April/May 2014..A conservative approach which will also reflect in the solution below.\n\nFrom your post and its replies, I understand that LO installed with 13.04 did not work. Your solutions was to install it from LO website. This process was not successful. To fix this, the solutions given in the posts involve:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cleaning up the earlier LO related files (using purge)\n\n*Then attempt re-installation using either the dep package downloaded from LO website OR use of PPA.\n\n\nMy solution involves cleaning up the OS of LO related files (including Binaries) and then use Ubuntu Software centre to Re-Download LO and install it.\nFurther I am assuming that the OS upgrade process is not contributing to this problem. Although auto upgrading option is available, I did come across suggestions to avoid this and instead do a clean install--i.e. delete earlier version and install the new version a fresh.\nAlso note that if you have upgraded from earlier version of Ubuntu, then you may need to purge the previous version of LO (version 3). I am assuming that there was no such need or that you purged the earlier LO version (or the purge libreoffice4.0 command that you have used, also cleans earlier LO version).\n(As this effect involve technical understanding about usage of purge option, Kindly confirm it from your end. I believe that the usage of \"libreoffice*\" in answer 2 ,should remove any and all versions of LO)\n*Some background material to enable understanding *\nThree sources for LO:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu software centre (officially supported version for a given distribution version). More stable..\n\n*LO website with the appropriate program (say deb file)..advantages are we get latest version and from a trusted source.\n\n*PPA (Ubuntu does not support this,One gets updated versions and often tweaked for Ubuntu)\n\n\nRight now the version from Ubuntu is current enough.So going for latest update is not an adequate incentive (at least for me).Therefore I prefer the Software Centre Approach.\nHow to prevent Ubuntu from using potentially corrupted LO binaries while we re-install LO using Software centre\nUbuntu stores the binaries of LO so that any re-installation can be done using it, thus avoiding re-downloads from Ubuntu servers.(the stored Binary can be from the installation DVD or from Ubuntu server)\nAssuming that the original LO binaries were corrupt (hence LO installed is not working), We need to un-install LO as well as remove the stored Binaries. Using purge option, does this two tasks.\nSo after purge, the OS has no LO installed and no Binaries of LO.\n\nNow that the system has no traces of LO or its binary, we can download it afresh from the Ubuntu Software Centre.(this is simple enough so I an not elaborating the steps)\nNote on packages Selection from Software Centre:\n\n\n*\n\n*Out of the LO packages \"Base\" (database) needs Java. By default \"Base\" and \"Java\" are not installed. To avoid Base (and Java) it seems that we have to download individual packages separately say Libreoffice Writer/Calc/impress etc.\n\n*There is a package named \"libreoffice\" which will install all packages including base and related programs.\n\n\nEnd of my Reply\n\nA: My Ub Software Center LibreOffice install to 13.04 runs and works seemingly well, but even after repeated cleans and reinstalls the Ub Software Center app throws an error for the disorganized state of the LO browser add-in, where these errors appear Each time Ub Software System is used to install Any software.  And several apps that work well for me on a 12.04 partition will Not install at all on 13.04, where fifty others install and run like on 12.04.

The upgrade itself went okay, no errors. But when I rebooted the computer afterwards and logged in to my Unity session, all I could see was the Desktop background (together with Desktop icons), and no Unity interface. The Super button shortcut wasn't showing the Dash, there was no top panel etc. Please see the screenshot.\n\nAs a hint, I'm suspecting it's got something to do with my switchable graphics. I'm running Ubuntu on Acer Aspire AS5830TG with nVidia GT540M and an Intel integrated card. In 12.10 I was using Bumblebee to manage the graphic card switching. During the upgrade I saw something related to nvidia had to be uninstalled, but didn't pay much attention to it. I can't be sure if it has anything to do with my problem though.\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nA: I fixed this issue by opening a terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T, resetting compiz with dconf reset -f /org/compiz/ and logging out with gnome-session-quit.\nWhen I logged back in the interface was there again.\n\nA: Resetting Compiz as indicated by arkx worked for me. However, I had to update the Nvidia drivers first, as detailed here:\nhttp://falkvinge.net/2013/02/15/how-to-install-nvidia-drivers-in-ubuntu-12-10-quantal/\nUnity seems to be working OK now. Thanks!\n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal window.\n\n*At the terminal prompt, type ccsm. If the CompizConfig Settings Manager window appears, skip to step 5. If not, continue with step 3.\n\n*Type sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager. Type your password when prompted.\n\n*At the next terminal prompt, type ccsm.\n\n*In CompizConfig Settings Manager, select the check box for the OpenGL plugin if it isn't already selected.\n\n*Click the Ubuntu Unity Plugin item.\n\n*Select the Enable Ubuntu Unity Plugin check box, if it isn't already selected. If it is already selected then uncheck this and again select it.\n\n*Exit from the CompizConfig Settings Manager.\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete. When asked, confirm that you want to log out.\n\n*I did a cold reboot at this point. I'm not sure it's necessary, but I'm a bit paranoid.\n\n\nAfter this, Unity came up as it's supposed to for me.\nI have a 64-bit AMD Phenom CPU and an nVidia GPU; I'm running 64-bit Ubuntu with the nvidia-current driver set, and I've just upgraded to 13.04 (at which point Unity disappeared).\n\nA: I ended up installing gnome-panel just to get an interface so I could launch applications.\nIf you launch the Compiz settings manager and reset the configuration to defaults, it should launch your interface again after you log out / in.\nYou can safely remove gnome-panel after doing this; I launched it from a command line to get to the compiz settings icon.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I had this problem running an Ubuntu virtual machine on VirtualBox after upgrading from VirtualBox 4.1 to 4.3. I had to reinstall Guest Additions from a terminal. After that, everything worked as expected.\n\nA: This also happened to me and  switching to gnome fixed my problem.  To get gnome open the terminal (CtrlAltt)and run  the following command:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\n\nAfter it installs just logout and hit the icon next to your name, then select gnome fallback.\n\nA: I tried several of previous options, and it worked for me installing: compizconfig-settings-manager, enabling unity plugin and after that i did ./compiz --replace and it started to work.\nBefore doing this step, I created another user, and when I logged in as that new user, unity was working. So, I understand that the problem was that while doing upgrade some config file had some obsolete settings that got updated after changing settings in compizconfig-settings-menager. \n\nA: I just uninstalled the ATI driver and reinstalled it and everything is fine.\nMy system features hybrid graphics and I installed driver 13.1 from AMD website for discrete card and everything was fine until I update my system and rebooted it. After I logged on the screen goes black and the Unity wont start. I do a lots of googling, and do the Unity reset but that does not fix it. Reinstalling the ATI driver fixed it in the end.\n\nA: Dang I hate when this happens. Somehow everything's back to normal. I've been fiddling around with my system, installing some drivers, uninstlaling some kernels, I actually have no idea what exactly was it that I did that fixed it. I remember deleting /etc/X11/xorg.conf and renaming /etc/X11/xorg.conf.failsafe to /etc/X11/xorg.conf which fixed a few things, but not all. Now I wouldn't try to explain the rest because I'm simply not able to explain in a non-confusing way.

Does the change to Mir affect other Ubuntu derivatives like Xubuntu or Kubuntu?\nFor example: Will Gnome 3, Xfce or KDE be ported to Mir?\n\nA: It's complicated :)\nNo it won't is the short answer. Canonical wants to move to Mir. Their effort to continue supporting X will be minimal once Mir starts working well. X will then have to be developed and supported by the community (that's us). The story is that the Kubuntu developers are not inclined to move to Mir. So Kubuntu will either stay with X or continue to move to Wayland.\nHowever, no one believes that the dust has settled on this. On the one hand, KDE/Kubuntu will have to start supporting both X and Wayland so that will be a heap of extra work. On the other, we will all have to see how well Mir actually works. If it isn't up to scratch to replace X in the coming months, Canonical may have to extend support for X longer. \nSo let's just wait and see.\n\nA: No, at least not in the short run. In fact, both Lubuntu's and Kubuntu's developers have announced that they won't be using Mir in their 13.10 releases. Lubuntu will not switch to Mir in 14.04 either. However, Mir's developers have been able to run Ubuntu and its derivatives on Mir using the XMir compatibility layer.\nEdubuntu, Xubuntu & Ubuntu Kylin have not yet announced whether they will switch to Mir. \n\nA: It looks performance is not good enough, so xubuntu is not implementing it yet.\n", "Q: MAC address changing in Ubuntu 12.04 I am trying to change the MAC address of my device.

If you have fastboot enabled disable it as it hibernates every time you shut down. In my opinion it is better to disable hibernation completely so that you never encounter this issue.\nForewarning: Disabling fastboot will cause your windows to boot significantly slower. Disabling Hibernation will cause it to boot a little bit slower than disabling fastboot. Your boot time will change from ~3-10 sec to ~10-60 sec.\nTo check this boot windows and choose \"Restart\" instead of shutdown -> load ubuntu -> then try to access the partition.\nDisabling Hibernate Completely\nDisabling Fastboot Only\n\nA: Just changed out my power supply. Believe it or not, there wasn't enough juice to the HD and it caused Ubuntu not to recognize the Windows XP partition. Changed power supply, problem solved. Weird, but  it worked. Do you have strange unexplainable intermittent issues? Crashes at no particular time and for no reason other than putting in a CD Rom?

Map digitizing is quite different than sketching - I need to position the cursor exactly then to click, preferably with the other hand, avoiding accidental moving during the \"click\". That is why I would like to disable the left mouse click when the pen touches the tablet and use some \"ExpressKeys\" on the left instead.\nUnder Windows I can configure everything as I like - s. the screenshots:\n, \nUnder Ubuntu Linux there are much less options in the GUI configuration applet - it is not possible to map a pad button to a mouse button - only to a keystroke. \nNext option I've tried is xsetwacom. Disabling a click was easy - just setting the Threshold for the pen to the highest 2048 value. Continuing with the button mapping...\nxsetwacom is thoroughly documented and seems to offer my desired function. Wiki http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/linuxwacom/index.php?title=Tablet_Configuration#Pad contains a suitable example\nxsetwacom set \"Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger pad\" Button 1 1\nxsetwacom set \"Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger pad\" Button 2 2\nxsetwacom set \"Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger pad\" Button 3 3\nxsetwacom set \"Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger pad\" Button 4 4\n\nTried to adapt it for my intuos - did not work:\nxsetwacom set 'Wacom Intuos5 touch L Pen pad' Button 2 2\nxsetwacom set 'Wacom Intuos5 touch L Pen pad' Button 3 3\n\nSo my questions:\nDoes mapping ExpressKeys to \"mouse\" buttons work for anybody under Linux? With Intuos5? With other Intuos models? With a newer Bamboo? Could somebody just try the above xsetwacom commands on his tablet and tell if he can now click with ExpressKeys?\n\nA: Great information in both posts. I had to do a lot of research myself to get this working and I wanted to post some things that I found that was either buried in other pages or discovered through trial and error.\nFirst off to find your device name enter \"xsetwacom list devices\"\nThis will list off the inputs for the tablet in whole. As an example I have a Wacom Intuos Pen and Touch Small, so my device list is:\n\nWacom Intuos PT S Pen stylus       id: 9   type: STYLUS\nWacom Intuos PT S Finger touch     id: 10  type: TOUCH\nWacom Intuos PT S Pen eraser       id: 13  type: ERASER\nWacom Intuos PT S Finger pad       id: 14  type: PAD\n\nThe id numbers didn't matter to me for mapping the express keys, but it does help to know which \"device\" is which. When I started this I was treating the whole bundle as one device.\nNext to set the express keys enter 'xsetwacom --set \"Your Device Name\" Button +X \"key x\"'\nThis is where I had to experiment a little. My keys were different than Clover's. For instance my +1 is bottom left, +3 top left, +8 bottom right, and +9 top right.\nSince I'm using the tablet to draw I set my keys to functions I want to do quickly. So I have them set to the keyboard shortcuts for zooming in and out, undo, and new layer.\nAnother trick I had to work out was how to enter multiple key combinations (e.g. Undo is ctrl+z). To achieve this just put another modifier at the end. The function then becomes:\nxsetwacom --set \"Your Device Name\" Button +X \"key x\" \"key y\" \"key z\" \"key etc.\"\nThese are the values for my device so you can see what it should look like without unnamed variables:\n\nxsetwacom --set \"Wacom Intuos PT S Finger pad\" Button +1 \"key ctrl\" \"key z\"\nxsetwacom --set \"Wacom Intuos PT S Finger pad\" Button +3 \"key ctrl\" \"key shift\" \"key n\"\nxsetwacom --set \"Wacom Intuos PT S Finger pad\" Button +8 \"Key -\"\nxsetwacom --set \"Wacom Intuos PT S Finger pad\" Button +9 \"key shift\" \"key +\"\n\nWhile testing the buttons and values I set them to keys a-d just so I could click them to see if they were working and identify keys.\nFinally once you get your keys mapped and you like the configuration save the command lines into a file an name it .xsetwacom.sh and put it into a bin folder in your home folder so you can keep it seperate from your normal directory. Add an executable command at the beginning\n\nchmod +x $HOME/bin/.xsetwacom.sh\n\nThen add the file to your startup programs and you now have expresskeys that will work even if you log out of your session.\nCommands gathered from xsetwacom help and http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/linuxwacom/index.php?title=Tablet_Configuration#Pad\nThis is a little off topic of binding the buttons to click, but seeing as how this post is the first that comes up when doing a search for express keys  I thought this answer would help those just beginning their search.\n\nA: It turns out this is due to an issue with the way the Gnome / Unity event system has been designed. Because the developers feel that mouse buttons are not events with real meaning, Gnome ignores these events when they come from the pad driver. You'll see that with xev and a mapping from pad button to mouse button, nothing whatsoever is reported.\nTo fix this, open dconf-editor, go to org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/gsdwacom and uncheck the \"active\" key. You have to log out and log in again.\nAfter doing this, you'll see that the relevant pad buttons now generate the configured mouse button events. I've tested and confirmed this on Ubuntu 14.04.1 with Unity.\nRead more about this issue here: http://sourceforge.net/p/linuxwacom/mailman/message/32093263/\n\nA: I use Wacom Intuis Pen & Touch under Ubuntu 13.10. It's working only with input-wacom-0.20.0 and xf86-input-wacom-0.23.0, so I manually compiled and installed it. Key mappings works great for both mouse and keyboad. On my finger pad, my keys is +1 (left up), +3 (left down), +8 (right up), +9 (right down). It does not work without plus sign.\nSo, this is my commands:\nxsetwacom --set \"${FINGER_PAD}\" Button +1 \"key d\"\nxsetwacom --set \"${FINGER_PAD}\" Button +3 \"key f\"\nxsetwacom --set \"${FINGER_PAD}\" Button +8 \"3\"\nxsetwacom --set \"${FINGER_PAD}\" Button +9 \"2\"\n\nHere's the documentation for the button settings (and the rest of xsetwacom) right now - http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/xsetwacom.1.html\n\nA: Solution to tablet button settings not working after updating to Ubuntu 15.04\nI use a script to set up my tablet to suit different programs, but these failed to work after updating to Ubuntu 15.04\nIn terminal I executed:\nxsetwacom list\n\nThis revealed that my pad name had changed from:\n\"Wacom BambooFun 4x5 pad\"\nto:\n\"Wacom BambooFun 4x5 Pad pad\"\nI then updated my scripts by replacing \"pad\" with \"Pad pad\"\nThis resolved the issue.\n", "Q: Disabled Secure Boot and Enabled UEFI for dual-boot on Acer? I have an Acer Aspire M laptop, which comes preinstalled with Windows 8, so it has this new UEFI stuff. \nTo get the Ubuntu LiveDVD running, I had to disable the UEFI completely and switch to legacy BIOS mode. But after that I couldn't boot Win8 anymore.\nIn many questions here I read that ubuntu 12.04.2 works with EFI but not with Secure Boot. But since I can't disable just one, I'm pretty much in a dead end.\nAlso it seems that UEFI boots faster than legacy BIOS, so it would be nice if I could keep all this for both Windows and Ubuntu :\\\n\nA: Yes I found one answer  that worked for me on my ACER. You have to set a bios password in you  bios menus then you can disable the secure boot and keep uefi... Then you have to run boot repair and follow the instructions....\n\nA: Set the \"Supervisor Password\" in the BIOS to remove the greying out (there is a total of five different kinds of password in some of the BIOSes):\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down F2 during startup of the laptop to enter the BIOS.\n\n*Select menu \"Security\" using the arrow keys.\n\n*Select \"Supervisor Password\" using the arrow keys.\n\n*Press Enter to get the dialog for setting the password.\n\n*Type in a password and Enter. \n\n*Retype in a password and Enter.\n\n*Remember the password somehow! You will be prompted for it the next time you try to enter the BIOS.\n\n*Press Enter to dismiss the dialog.\n\n*Select \"Boot\" using the right arrow key.\n\n*\"Enabled\" for \"Secure Boot\" is no longer greyed out (and can be changed to \"Disabled\")!\n\n*Optional: Set the \"Supervisor Password\" back to empty.\n\n*Select menu \"Exit\" and menu item \"Exit Saving Changes\" using the arrow keys. Press Enter for \"Yes\" in the prompt.\n\n\nA: It's usually possible to disable Secure Boot without disabling EFI support; however, the user interfaces in EFIs vary greatly from one system to another, so I can't provide step-by-step instructions for doing this. I recommend you peruse your firmware settings to find the relevant options and play with them.\nAlso, it was my understanding that 12.04.2 did support Secure Boot. 12.10 definitely does, and I assume that the new 13.04 does. Thus, you should be able to get Ubuntu installed with Secure Boot active. Even if 12.04.2 doesn't actually include Secure Boot support, trying 13.04 might be worthwhile. Admittedly it's not an LTS version, but given how new Secure Boot is and how quickly things are changing in this arena, giving up LTS may be the price you have to pay -- at least, to do it relatively easily.\nIf all else fails, you should be able to get it to work by creating your own Secure Boot medium. This is not an easy task, though. My Web page on Secure Boot covers the topic in moderate detail. In brief, you'd need to prepare a medium (a modified Ubuntu installer or a separate boot medium) that includes a pre-signed version of shim.efi or PreBootloader.efi and that launches a boot loader (ELILO, GRUB, or rEFInd) that in turn launches the Ubuntu installer's kernel and initrd file. You'd probably need to enroll keys or hashes for the boot loader and perhaps the kernel and initrd file to get this all working, too. This is not a task for a newbie, though; to get this to work, you'll need to be comfortable with boot loader/manager configuration files, kernel options, and so on.\n\nA: *\n\n*UEFI boot is not faster than Legacy (BIOS) boot.\n\n*12.04.2 is compatible with UEFI and SecureBoot.\n\n*for more information, see the Community Doc: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n\nA: Dual Boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.04 on Acer TravelMate\nI was at the same dead end: I could not disable secure boot in the UEFI-mode in the BIOS of an Acer Travelmate P253-E with pre-installed Windows 8.

I did the \"Clean drive fully\" option, it took a whole night to run! After that I could change the Security Boot to \"Disable\" in the Boot Section of the UEFI-BIOS.\nI installed Ubuntu 13.04 64bit with a LiveCD and chose the windows boot partition \"fat32 EFI system partition boot\" as \"device for boot loader installation\".\nAfter installation, the Notebook booted directly to Windows 8. No chance to boot Ubuntu...\nI booted Ubuntu 13.04 via my Ubuntu13.04 LiveCD and installed and run the Boot-Repair (\"recommended repair\") as described here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nAnd this it is: Now booting the Notebook, gives me a screen on which I can choose to boot Ubuntu 13.04 or Win 8. With Ubuntu as default system, of course! :)\nHope I could help someone...\nCheers!!\n\nA: it says on a few websites to delete efi folder and then the cms mode will work but you need to re-install from either flash drive or windows disk\nwhile windows is booting up press 0 key to go into recovery manager\ntype these commands\ndiskpart\nlist disk\nselect disk 0\nclean\nexit\nexit\n\nThis will wipe your hard drive clean no go back into the bios and you should see uefi and secure boot enabled, disable secure boot. now select cms and it will ask you to boot from disk, follow the on screen instructions to install windows.\n\nA: Setting the password in BIOS/uefi worked for me also.   After I could disable secure boot.   The instructions are here:\nhttp://acer--uk.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/27071/~/how-to-enable-or-disable-secure-boot\nAlso I noticed that afterwards it would skip straight to windows.   I didn't need to use boot repair though.  Just go back into bios/uefi and reorder the boot sequence.  Mine was set to windows first and then 'Ubuntu' next, right below it.  I just reversed this order.   Finally on my Acer netbook I could not get to BIOS/uefi at all when starting up if I had shut down windows properly.

I wanted to see if anyone knew when raring will make it to http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral/releases/ to be downloaded and deployed by MAAS? I know the daily builds are available there, but have some issues deploying from daily builds as it is.\nThanks!\n\nA: The raring image for MAAS should be released next week. However note that by default, this is only used for enlistment/commissioning. If you would like to install raring, you don't really need this image. What you need to do is to add raring to the least of releases in:\n/etc/maas/import_pxe_files\n\nAnd then you need to run:\nsudo maas-import-pxe-files\n\n\nA: Andres' answer is not sufficient (as in it does not work). Perhaps in a week it will. But as of today, it does not.\nI added raring to the list and the import (sudo maas-import-pxe-files) failed because it couldn't find http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/query/raring/ephemeral/released-dl.txt.\n", "Q: Mouse acceleration 13.04 A new release of Ubuntu brought a new mouse settings window.\nHowever, it only lists a sensitivity setting, no acceleration.\nWhere is the setting for acceleration?\nHow do I disable it?\nIf I disable acceleration using xinput (e.g. xinput --set-prop 15 270 1, which sets the acceleration multiplier to 1) it returns if I disconnect and reconnect my mouse, and also if I reboot. Any way around this?\n\nA: Have you tried using xinput? Such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*xinput --list\n\n*xinput --list-props #deviceid\n\n*xinput --set-prop #deviceid #propid value\n\nA: to survive reboot, first, create script:\necho -e '#!/bin/bash\\nxinput --set-prop 15 270 1' > mouse_acceleration_1.sh\n\nmake it executable:\nchmod +x mouse_acceleration_1.sh\n\nthen run\ngnome-session-properties\n\nand add this script to the list.\n(I've found this answer here: Reduce the Mouse Sensitivity)\nIt probably won't work if you reconnect your mouse.\n\nA: If your mouse moves too slow after disabling mouse acceleration you can use the following script. It (ab)uses the 'simple' acceleration profile since the xinput constant deceleration setting cannot be used for values between 0 and 1. \n#!/bin/bash\n\ndevice=\"Dell Dell USB Optical Mouse\"\nresolution_percent=\"241\" # Greater than 100, use constant deceleration otherwise with profile -1. \n\nxinput set-prop \"$device\" \"Device Accel Profile\" 4 # Simple profile with threshold 0 allows constant scaling up\nxinput set-ptr-feedback \"$device\" 0 \"$resolution_percent\" 100 # Set threshold to 0 and acceleration to $resolution_percent/100\n\nYou'll have to modify the script by using your particular device name. You can look that up by running xinput without arguments. Also the script has to be run each time the mouse is connected or when you start the system. \n", "Q: Download ZIP file with curl command How can I download ZIP file with curl command?

A rogue server could send you the name of a DLL or other file\n  that could possibly be loaded automatically by Windows or some third\n  party software.\n\n\nA: \"curl -LOk\" makes it using insecure protocols (-k), disabling SSL certificate checks (which fail because of the incorrect path not matching the certificate), and create the output file using the filename (-O) proposed from the remote server (also insecure).\nIn my opinion, the server should better be configured create local redirecting aliases where needed, to avoid having to pass this non conforming part of the URL. But the redirection is made using an HTTP redirect only (HTTP error 30x), which causes problems to curl that does not follow (by default) this (unsecure) redirection, and option (-k) disables this security check.\nSo instead of using HTTP redirects (moved permanently), please add some internal link on the filesystem of the server. If this is needed because the URL is in fact hosted on another physical server with no direct access between their filesystems, you should use another DNS name for this host, so that clients will query the correct one directly, without any redirect.\nThen fix your web pages (you may use your webserver logs to see where HTTP 30x redirects are returned and which webpages may need to be checked and updated).\nForcing clients to use unsecure/unchecked protocols is not a good option.\nSo this is definitely a problem of very bad configuration on the web server: try contacting their admin to fix that.\n\nA: well, you can use Axel as well. axel is a light command line download accelerator. it supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS protocols. its nice and faster alternative.\ninstall axel using :\napt-get install axel\n\nthen download your file by:\naxel http://github.com/ziyaddin/xampp/archive/master.zip\n\n\nA: Use the option -L to follow redirects, you can use also the --output option to give a path and a name to the zip file.

Ok, so when mysql updated a while back, it broke.  It was simply not starting.  So I tried fixing it, but hadn't been successful. \nI finally gave up, copied all the directories & files under /var/lib/mysql out to a safe location, apt-get purge mysql, then apt-get install mysql.\nSo the server is running, but I can not, for the life of me, seem to get the old databases back in, and in a useable form.\nI did get my gallery3 database in by just copying the gallery3 dir from my mysql/backup location in.  But my actually gallery3 installation wouldn't talk to it.  :/\nPossibly there are permission issues, but I'm really clueless about sql.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: You won't get your databases back that way. If your old MySQL version was exactly(!) the same as the one you are using now, it would possibly work out but only if you would move the current /var/lib/mysql to something like /var/lib/mysql.old and move all content of the old backuped /var/lib/mysql including all subdirectories to /var/lib/mysql now.\nYour problem is that you made only a raw data copy of the files containing the data but you didn't really backed-up the logic. See, if a database is created like gallery3, it inserts certain rows and data into the data dictionary of the MySQL DB itself and into the 'mysql' master schema. So only copying over a directory including datafiles won't work, as - let's call them links - to those datafiles inside the new MySQL setup are missing.\nAlso, if you ran the old MySQL installation with default DB type \"innodb\" and didn't backup the ibdata1 and ib_logfiles0/1 files in /var/lib/mysql your data is most certainly lost as InnoDB tables are completely stored inside the InnoDB tablespace file (ibdata1) and only a bit of metadata is stored in the files in the subdirectory.\nBest way for a simple backup before such big hiccups is to make a mysqldump of your database (aka schema) into an .sql file and re-insert it. That is called a \"logical\" backup (instead of physical), as it dumps every information logically necessary to rebuild your db schema as it was before. A physical backup isn't recommended (only if you know exactly what you are doing and what risks are involved).\nHope that helps a bit\n", "Q: The new Ubuntu upgrade (13.04) wont let me connect to wi-fi Ever since I upgraded Ubuntu to 13.04 I haven't been able to connect to any wi-fi.

Can I run Ubuntu 12.04 LTS off my 4GB USB drive as its own native operating system with persistence enabled to save changes to the USB the same way that I do with Slax or other fully portable Linux distros?\nHow can I remove the \"install this\" icon in my current live Ubuntu USB installation? Can I run it fully portably without the icon wanting me to install it to the host computer?\nI'm a Windows XP user, but I would like to switch to Ubuntu on an 8GB USB if it's possible.\n\nA: There are basically two ways to run Ubuntu from a USB drive. \nThe first is to do a regular install and select the USB drive as the target for installation. Be sure to select the right drive for writing GRUB to the Master Boot Record (MBR). If you select your internal drive by mistake then your computer will not boot if your USB drive is not connected, even though your intention is to boot into Windows.\nThe second is to use the program Startup Disk Creator on Ubuntu to create a Live USB install. To add persistence select the option \"Stored in reserved extra space\" under the question \"When starting up from this disk, documents and settings will be:\" and then use the slider to reserve as much space as you need to store your documents and extra applications.\nIf you want to remove the \"install this\" icon from your desktop all you have to do is uninstall the package called \"ubiquity\". Do this with:\n$ sudo apt-get remove ubiquity\n\nNote that this only works if you've enabled persistence when creating the live USB. If you use the first method then ubiquity will be uninstalled as part of the installation process.\n\nA: Assuming you are referring to the icon of the USB devive in Windows XP, you should be able to change/remove it by editing the autorun.inf file on the flash drive in the topmost directory of the drive\nIf you are trying to change the name of the drive on Linux you need to alter the partition label of the partition on the usb device, you can do this with gparted or the gnome disk utility\nas for switching the drive to a larger usb you can copy the partition using gparted to the other usb then run sudo grub-install /dev/sdX replace X as needed for the correct usb device (you can get the letter using gparted in the drop down menu that changed the displayed disk)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 won't boot after security updates Ubuntu 12.10 64bit on a Dell studio 1558 laptop (i7 with 4 G of RAM).

Given the way this identification has been done, I trust the MBR data on this one. Chances are you or the installer mistakenly set the \"boot flag\" on the partition. Using libparted-based programs, setting the \"boot flag\" on a GPT partition actually sets the ESP type code, which should never be set on a Linux partition. (The ESP is required to hold a FAT filesystem and should hold EFI boot loaders and related files, not a Linux installation.) This error isn't likely to be causing your problem, but it's conceivable it's a contributing factor. Thus, I recommend booting a Linux emergency system and using GParted, parted, gdisk, or some other tool to adjust the type code appropriately. Using GParted or parted, remove the \"boot flag\" from the Linux partition; or using gdisk, change the type code from EF00 to 8300. Note that these tools will probably show another ESP, this one with a FAT filesystem. You should leave it configured as an ESP (with its \"boot flag\" or EF00 type code, depending on the tool you use).\nSecond, I recommend you switch from a BIOS-mode boot of Linux to an EFI-mode boot. This will obviate the need to use a hybrid MBR, which you're using now. Hybrid MBRs are ugly and dangerous hacks. You can install a suitable EFI-mode boot loader without too much difficulty. The easiest to set up is likely to be my rEFInd, which is a fork of the (now-discontinued) rEFIt; however, the procedure I'm about to describe works only with 3.3.0 and later kernels. Ubuntu 12.10 and later, including Ubuntu 12.04.2 (but not the original 12.04) come with suitable kernels. The procedure is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the rEFInd binary .zip file from its downloads page.\n\n*Install rEFInd under OS X. This is easily done by using the install.sh script.\n\n*Install the rEFInd driver for ext4fs. You can do this by copying the ext4_x64.efi file from the rEFInd package to the /EFI/refind/drivers_x64/ directory (which you'll have to create). (This assumes you install to the default location; if you install rEFInd to your ESP or install manually elsewhere, you'll need to adjust the path appropriately.)\n\n*Reboot. rEFInd should appear.\n\n*In rEFInd, use the arrow keys to select one of the Linux penguin icons, which rEFInd should identify as launching a Linux kernel with a filename that begins with vmlinuz.\n\n*With one of the Linux kernels selected, hit F2 or Insert twice. A text-mode text editor should appear.\n\n*Add ro root=/dev/sda2 to the boot options and press Enter. Linux should launch.\n\n*In Linux, run the mkrlconf.sh script that came with rEFInd. This will create a configuration file that should obviate the need to add ro root=/dev/sda2 to your Linux options the next time you boot; instead, Linux should launch directly when you select its option and hit the Enter key.\n\n\nAt this point, your system will be basically functional. You can remove the hybrid MBR by using the gdisk program (specifically, by typing x followed by n followed by w) or by making any minor change to your partitions with parted or GParted. You may also want to tweak the rEFInd configuration by editing the /EFI/refind/refind.conf file under OS X; see the rEFInd documentation for details.\n\nA: Did you try an option boot? For this you hold option while booting and may fix it. Secondly you may have installed it incorrectly. I did so 2 times before realizing I was making a mistake. \n\nA: I was in similar situation, but when I installed rEFit.dmg and after that installed refind-bin. When I typed sudo [PATH of refined-bin] and entered my password, the system prompted me (roughly):\n\nSystem should delete bless file because it cause rEFit not work properly and you should delete it by typing y.\n\nI do that and problem solved.\n", "Q: How do I install on an encrypted disk now that there is no alternate CD? How do I install Raring in an encrypted disk?\nThere's no alternate CD and on regular raring CD there is no option to mount the existing encrypted partitions!\n\nA: I've just done it with the old command line installer mini CD at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\nIn searching for a fix, I notice a bunch of bugs in encrypted installs. Maybe they disabled it rather than take chances. But, they should have mentioned it in the release notes.\nBTW, I also tried creating the LVM crypt disk setup before starting the installer. It did see it, but when I tried to boot, I just got the intrmfs prompt. So don't waste your time on it.\n", "Q: Why is my Broadband Dongle not detected after upgrade to 13.04?

I removed every MacOS partition on install and created GPT-swap-EXT4(/)-EXT4(/local).\n\n*lspci | grep VGA only shows an AMD 6600 Series card, so I guess I'm need to configure EFI-booting to be able switch to the low power Intel card.\n\n*I found a package called grub-efi-amd64 as well as this tutorial, the latter seems outdated as it suggest compiling grub 1.99 by hand which is also contained in the package I found.\n\n\nI would kindly ask for clearification on the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I just apt-get install grub-efi-amd64 or is there more to be done (Only Kubuntu on the machine, so grub will do fine - Does it still need to be \"blessed\" as per the tutorial).\n\n*Does the package work through it all or do I still have to go through steps 3-7 of the tutorial?\n\n*The GPT partition only has 4 MiB. Do I have to enlarge it?\n\n\nA: The tutorial you refer to in your question seems quite outdated. \nGrub has had native EFI support since at least 2-3 official standard releases of Ubuntu.\nTo run your Mac in EFI mode i simply installed refind then boot the mac on a usb key with the standard ubuntu64, selecting the EFI boot option in refind for the Ubuntu installer.\na more detailed tutorial can be found here that also deals with some potential issues.\nI use Ubuntu with my Macbook 8,2 15\" and successfully switch between the two cards.\nI wrote a howto for the actual switching here \n\nA: Kubuntu Raring ISO now offers UEFI installs.\nBoot the UEFI installer, GRUB comes up, hit e to edit the entry, insert nomodeset right after quiet splash so your screen doesn't go black, then hit F10 to boot and your good to go.\n", "Q: How do I turn off avahi-daemon on boot?

Whats the problem? How can i fix it?and whats more, Boot-Repair can only bring my Win7 loader back in the Grub list but the formal efi loader of Win7 has been overwrited into Grub by Ubuntu. How can i restore it?\n\nA: First, it was Boot Repair, not Ubuntu's installer, that replaced the Windows boot loader with another copy of GRUB. Boot Repair does this because it's the only available workaround for some buggy BIOSes that will launch the Windows boot loader but not a Linux boot loader; but IMHO, Boot Repair is far too quick to resort to this solution, which is an inelegant (albeit occasionally necessary) hack. IIRC, there's an option in Boot Repair to undo this change. If you can't find it, you can do the same thing manually by renaming files. The Microsoft boot loader should be EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi on the ESP (which is mounted at /boot/efi in Linux; see below). In your case, that file will hold a copy of GRUB, and the real Microsoft boot loader will be renamed with another extension or with a few new leading characters -- the Boot Repair developers seem to have changed the names they use at least once. Note that if you rename your boot programs correctly, it's conceivable that your computer will begin booting Windows directly when you power it on, giving you no option to boot Linux. If this happens, you may be able to find Linux in your firmware's own boot manager (usually launched by hitting a function key at boot time); and you can probably restore GRUB to be the default by using the efibootmgr program in Linux. See my Web page on EFI boot loader installation for details.\nThe /boot/efi directory is empty because it's a mount point for the ESP, and as you've reported, the system has been unable to mount it. This is most likely because of filesystem damage, although it could be that your /etc/fstab entry for /boot/efi has an error. Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type sudo parted /dev/sda print. This should produce a list of partitions on your disk. The ESP is normally a FAT partition with the \"boot flag\" set, in parted's nomenclature. Identify this partition and note its number. If you can't find a FAT partition, that could be because of very serious damage to the ESP -- but this seems unlikely, given that you can boot.\n\n*Type sudo mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi, changing 1 to whatever number you identified in the first step. If there's an error message, take note of it; it may be a clue about what's wrong.\n\n*If you were unable to mount the ESP, type sudo dosfsck /dev/sda1, again changing 1 to the correct partition number. This will run Linux's FAT filesystem check utility on the partition, which with any luck will fix the problem. You can then try manually mounting the partition again.\n\n*If you were able to mount the ESP without running dosfsck, look for its entry in /etc/fstab and fix any problems with it. I know this description is vague, but it's hard to know what might be wrong without seeing the entry. Post it here if you need further advice.\n\n\nYou mentioned Windows 7, but be aware that Windows 8 doesn't use a normal shutdown by default. Instead, it uses a \"fast startup\" feature that's more like a suspend-to-disk operation. One consequence of this is that filesystems are left in an inconsistent state. I've heard of this feature causing problems with the ESP on some computers, which is why I mention it. When dual-booting with Windows 8, you should disable the \"fast startup\" feature, as described here. Even in Windows 7, you might see something similar if you used a suspend-to-disk feature or otherwise did not shut down cleanly.\n", "Q: How do I get the brightness keys working on a Samsung NC110?

I use tlp (see first answer: info about tlp), and in powertop I saw that all USB devices' powersaving options are enabled.

This solution does not depend on the hardware, hence I dare to recommend it to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*As root, open the /etc/default/grub file in your favourite text editor.\n\n*Change the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux\"\n\n*Save the file\n\n*As root, run update-grub\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Enjoy! :-)\nSource: http://en.kioskea.net/faq/12062-adjust-the-brightness-in-ubuntu-10-10\nHope, this helps!\n\nA: I have the same thing on one of my Toshiba-Satellite Laptops (the other one works fine). Brightness is always set to minimum after reboot.\nI couldn't find a real solution, so I installed a little brightness-indicator, which shows a button in the panel. After startup I can change brightness without the need to open system settings.\n\"Installing the applet in Ubuntu 11.10 through 13.04 is as easy as running the following commands in a Terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:indicator-brightness/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install indicator-brightness\nIf a PPA is a bit too much for you, you can grab a .Deb installer from the project launchpad page\"\nhttps://launchpad.net/~indicator-brightness/+archive/ppa/+packages\nYou can find the details of the indicator at:\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/04/brightness-control-ubuntu\n", "Q: Upgrade from 12.10 to 13.04 affecting other systems I'm quite new to using Ubuntu. I have a dual-booted computer, running Windows 7 & Ubuntu 12.10. I'm planning to get an upgrade to 13.04. In terminal, I know the command is \"do-release-upgrade\". But, when I install it, will it leave my other systems alone? I'm expecting it will just add the option to boot into Ubuntu 13.04 when I turn on my computer?\nSo I would have the options:\nWindows 7,\nUbuntu 12.10 &\nUbuntu 13.04\nCorrect? All in my GRUB menu.\nHelp is greatly appreciated, I just really want to make sure nothing will be harmed. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Although the upgrade should go without any problem you should back up your data first just in case. Upgrades can fail for any number of reasons. You should also read the release notes first.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseNotes\nEspecially the \"known issues\" section\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseNotes#Known_issues\nThere is no reason to believe the upgrade would affect windows.\nOnce you upgrade, you will no longer be able to boot 12.10 and there should not be an option to do so.\n\nA: Since you already have a working dual boot (windows 7 and ubuntu 12.10) go ahead and upgrade. \n12.10 will be upgraded to 13.04 thereby eliminating any previous version in GRUB. Think of 13.04 as a new 12.10 \nAlso since GRUB is handling the master bootloader, nothing will happen to your current setup as your new setup after the upgrade will be:\n-Ubuntu 13.04\n-Windows 7\nSo go ahead and upgrade. GRUB really handles Windows 7 very well. \nHope this helps. \n", "Q: Iburst 13.04 not working Has anyone has managed to install the iBurst USB drivers?

So, I went back and noticed on that edit page for the region controller it said:\n\nIf you enable DHCP management, you will need to install the\n  'maas-dhcp' package on this cluster controller. Similarly, you will\n  need to install the 'maas-dns' package on this region controller to be\n  able to enable DNS management.\n\nSo I did:\nsudo apt-get install maas-dhcp maas-dns\n\nAnd I finally got a node to get an address from it.\n", "Q: How do I get the touchpad working on a Toshiba P850?

I have a Toshiba satellite A-200 laptop with a Vista OS on it with 4 NTFS partitions\n(C:) Vista \n(D:) Entertainment \n(E:) Work \n(F:) Sources\n\nand I wanted to start using Ubuntu instead. So I tried it first from the live CD and everything was OK and all the partitions were shown and working and so I decided to install Ubuntu to replace Vista on the (C:) drive. After I did that I can no longer find my folders and files on the (D:), (E:), (F:) partitions and the only file system that is shown is one 198 GB although my HDD is 320 GB.\nI can't access the lost data on the remaining 120 GB which I hope is still there and not totally lost\nI am now working from the live CD but I am unable to install testdisk. Can I recover the Vista partitions by the product recovery CD to get my laptop back to the factory settings? Can I recover the NTFS partitions using a recovery program for Windows or will that make the problem worse? \nI need these data badly as I don't have a backup for them.\n\nA: Unfortunately it seems you accidentally partitioned your whole drive replacing your Windows partitions with a single Ubuntu partition.\n\nYou will not be able to recover these partitions by restoring Vista with the recovery CD. In fact every write attempt to your hard drive will make things worse as remnants of your data may get more and more overwritten.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Encrypted partitions can not be recovered\n  \n*Drives that were part of a Windows \"Storage Space/Pool\" can not be recovered\n  \n\nYou may however be able to recover your partitions with testdisk  but you may not be able to recover all of your data. You can temporarily install testdisk on a live session too (however this will then not be a permanent installation).\n\n\n*\n\n*Please have an external drive ready to save your recovered data before you proceed. You can't recover the data on the same drive.\n\n*Boot your Ubuntu LiveCD (\"Try Ubuntu\") and then install testdisk by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding the \"Universe\" repository to your software sources (from Ubuntu system settings > Software & updates)\n\n\n*Updating your apt cache in a terminal by first pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and then typing: \nsudo apt update\n\n\n*then install testdisk with:\nsudo apt install testdisk\n\n\n\n*Mount your external backup drive in the live session (e.g. with Nautilus) to be able to store recovered data later.\n\n*Follow the concise step by step guide on the Testdisk Wiki which will help you to recover lost partitions.\n\n*If you are not able to recover from an image of your overwritten drive (this will need an external drive with more than double the free space than your laptop's hard drive) you need to save all your data on an external drive soon after recovery.\n\n*You will not be able to recover your Windows installation, as this was overwritten by Ubuntu.\n\n*Only if you fail to recover partitions you may be able to recover single data file using PhotoRec from the TestDisk suite but this will not recover filenames, folder structures or time stamps of your files.\n\n*Do not use the drive before you were able to recover your lost data.\n\nCopy data from the live system to an external drive\nTo be able to save our data to an external drive we need to mount both the recovered partitions and the external USB drive in the live environment. The below picture shows how the USB drive will be mounted on insertion (the internal partitions will be mounted on selecting them):\n\nWe can then copy & paste (or drag & drop) our rescued files from the internal drive to the external drive (e.g. by opening a separate Nautilus window, or in releases < 13.04 by adding an extra pane with  F3 ). From the terminal we can issue:\ncp -a /<mountpoint_source>/* /media/ubuntu/<name_destination>\n\nAfter sucessful copy we need to unmount the drives to avoid data loss. This will be done in Nautilus from a right click context menu or in the terminal:\nsudo umount /media/ubuntu/<name>\n\n\nCopy single files using testdisk\nIn case we were unable or did not want to recover the partition table we may try to copy selected files or directories with testdisk from the <Advanced> Filesystem Utils menu:\n\nIn above example I had selected examples.desktop and rsynctest folder by pressing  : . To copy these files we press  C  for the next menu giving the file hierarchy of our running system. We have to browse to the mountpoint of our external drive (here /media/23GB_USB but this will probably be /media/ubuntu/<name_of_device in your case). The content of our USB is now listed, and can be browsed for deeper directories:\n\nWhen we press  C  in the example above our above selected example.desktop, and the folder rsynctest will be copied to the external USB drive.\nTo verify we had succeeded we can now open Nautilus in our live system and see the content of the rescued files. After we are done, do not forget to unmount the USB drive.\n\nA: Since no one provided a GUI alternatives for the terminal impaired Ubuntu users, here is a GUI for Testdisk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert your Ubuntu CD/DVD/USB and boot from it\n\n\n*\n\n*At boot-up, select try Ubuntu out.\n\n\n*Download qphotorec. \n\n\n*\n\n*Install like so: sudo dpkg -i qphotorec_1.0_all.deb\n\n*If there are any dependencies issues, run: sudo apt-get -f install \n\n\n*After qphotorec installation, execute it, like so: qphotorec or search via the dash, for qphotorec \n\n\n*\n\n*Select the drive you want to recover, and where you want to recover all the data too. \n\n\n*Pray to our Human Deity, and hope you get everything back. \nAlso, let this be a lesson: ALWAYS BACKUP. Always.\n\nQPhotorec is a 32bit application, if you have a 64bit Operating System, you need to install the 32bit libraries, to run QPhotorec:\nsudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386\n\nSince most IT personnel are lazy - myself included -, I provide you with a one liner, without the 32bit libraries:\ncd /tmp/; wget \"http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/crunchyiconthem/QPhotoRec/qphotorec_1.0_all.deb?r=&ts=1443542155&use_mirror=netix\" -O qphotorec_1.0_all.deb; sudo dpkg -i qphotorec_1.0_all.deb; sudo apt-get -f install; qphotorec\n\n\n\nA: DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING  ON YOUR HARDDRIVE!\nDon't install any software, updates or anything else, if possible don't even use Ubuntu until you recovered your data. Else, you will render yor data unrecoverable!\nDownload SystemRescueCd and burn it. Use it to recover your old partition table. After recovering it, copy all data to an external drive. You will probably be able to recover most of your data, although some will likely be lost forever.\nAfter copying your data you can safely install Ubuntu over the entire disk. After that, you can create more partitions if you want and copy the data back to your PC.\nKeep in mind, that regular backups are always a good thing to have. (Ubuntu has a tool for that, just hit the Windows key and type \"backup\".\n", "Q: How to get hibernate button in unity shutdown dialog in Ubuntu Raring 13.04?

It has a sync function so it will sync everything in the photos app on your iPhone (which is in an iPhoto db format) by date. If you install the sync client on your machine then you will have access to all of your photos because they will be downloaded from your cloud account. From there you can import them into Ubuntu easily. \n\nA: I don't use either iphoto or shotwell, so the following may not be relevant. I assume that you are wanting to reorganise your photos by date and time taken? Shotwell is what you propose to use to achieve that?\nI use jhead (http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/usage.html). It is command line only, but very fast. It will operate on a whole directory full of images with one command. It uses the exif metadata embedded in the pictures, and can rename them by date and time (ie date and time taken), in accordance with the pattern you specify on the command line. Renaming can include creating a directory structure based on date. The web page I have linked to gives examples.\nIf this works for you, you could create a shell script with your chosen renaming pattern, so that you can reproduce the same pattern for every directory-full of photos. There are also plenty of examples on the internet of how to get a script to walk a directory tree, and run the desired command on every directory it finds.

I know you run a .sh file by:\n./file.sh\n\nAfter you compile it, I also know all the command are stored in /bin/bash. But I can't seem to figure out how I can create a command that I can call when I am in any directory in the terminal, something like:\nabc\n\nwould run abc.h, etc. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Although Radu's answer is absolutely correct, I feel like it's a bit incomplete for the beginner that does not know the location of certain files, so here's a step-by-step on the second method (using ~/bin). If you would like to store the files somewhere else than ~/bin, follow step 1, otherwise, ignore it and keep in mind you'll be using ~/bin as your scripts folders.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and run the following:\nnano .profile\n\nYou should see, at the end of the file:\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nIf you don't see it, try using nano .bash_profile instead. Keep in mind you should be at ~/, that is, /home/YOUR_USERNAME\nThis tells bash where user's scripts are. The default is /home/YOUR_USERNAME/bin which is \"abbreviated\" as $HOME/bin or ~/bin. You can then change it to any folder you'd like to store your scripts in. Mine is ~/.bin -- the same as the original, but hidden.\n\n*If you already issued chmod +x script.sh just move your scripts to the folder in which you're going to store them - create it if it doesn't exist. Inside that folder, if you store your scripts as file.sh you'll have to run file.sh everytime, so store them as file -- no extensions.\n\nA: The shell maintains a list of directories where executable files (programs) are kept, and just searches the directories in that list. If it does not find the program after searching each directory in the list, it will issue the famous command not found error message. This list of directories is called your path. You can view the list of directories with the following command:\necho $PATH\n\nYou can add directories to your path with the following command, where *directory* is the name of the directory you want to add:\nexport PATH=$PATH:*directory*\n\nA better way would be to edit your .bash_profile file to include the above command. That way, it would be done automatically every time you log in.\nMost modern Linux distributions encourage a practice in which each user has a specific directory for the programs he personally uses. This directory is called bin and is a subdirectory of your home directory. If you do not already have one, create it with the following command:\nmkdir bin\n\nMove your script into your new bin directory and you're all set. Now you just have to type:\nmy_script\n\nand your script will run.\n\nA: I would recommend alias function instead.  The other approaches does work, but they do not get rid of the \".sh\" extension as you wanted.\nIt can also mess with path system if you forgot to add ${PATH}: into the export PATH.\nyou can type:\n\nalias test=\"/your/path/to/file/test.sh\"\n\nIf it is working properly, you need to add it into your .bashrc file:\n\nsudo gedit ~/.bashrc\n  copy your alias command at the end of the file.\n\nor a faster way (needs attention):\n\necho \"alias test=/path/to/folder/text.sh\" >> .bashrc \n\nJust please don't forget to use >>, if only > was employed it will replate the entire file with only the echo command.\nand finally \n\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nto update the .bashrc commands.\nAlias may be even more powerful since you can add some input options as e.g. below:\n\nalias gaussview='XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 $GV_DIR/gview \"$@\"'\n\nI hope you find it useful.\n", "Q: Terminal aborts installation of a package no matter what I type When I'm trying to install a package, say chromium I type this in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install chromium\n\nThen it says:\nAfter this operation, 3.1415926 MB of additional disk space will be used.\nDo you want to continue [Y/n]?\n\nThen when I type in yes or y or Y or whatever I tried everything but no matter what I type it shows up like this:\nAbort.\n\nI just did a clean installation of 13.04 yesterday and didn't have this problem before when I was using 12.04 ( y always works ).

This time I got the prompt for the passphrase!  But don't get too excited, because it didn't work.  I entered the right password about 7 times and it rejected them all.

When I went to watch some only episodes of star trek on Amazon Prime, the player would get stuck on updating. I followed the instructions here and doing so actually worked for 3 seconds. It was the oddest thing. Clearly the video was playing and I saw 3 seconds of the episode, but a message came up saying I needed to update my flash player. I tried loading videos over and over again, but no success, not even the 3 seconds. Here is the error message:\nSorry we were unable to stream this video. This is likely because your Flash Player needs to be updated.\n\nI am running Ubuntu 13.04 Raring Ringtail, Firefox 20, and adobe flash-player 11,2,202,280. Apparently Adobe isn't going to make newer versions of flash available for Linux, only security updates. \nSo has anyone been able to play prime instant videos, and if so, under what circumstances? Is there perhaps an alternative implementation of the flash plugin I can use? Or is the cause of my problem something different altogether?\n\nProblem probably has to do with the version of flash being used. If anyone has gotten Prime to work with an my current version of flash or an open-source/free implementation of it, please do tell. Or if anyone can get videos on amazon to play with any other parameters aside from changing my browser to chrome, please tell me.\nThis also affects protected content in Hulu and other services that employ DRM through Flash.\n\nWhat hasn't worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Chrome which has the newest version of flash via ppapi. Amazon Prime strictly prohibits it.\n\n*Using Chromium has the same issue as using firefox\n\n*Trying to install Adobe Flash 11,2,202,275.

The version of Wine I used was 1.4.1. I have noticed no bugs when doing so.\n\n*Download the Windows installer for latest version of Adobe Flash Player and run it using Wine. I noticed no bugs when doing so.\n\n\nWhen playing videos on Amazon Prime, I notice no artifacts or anything that would detract from the viewing experience. Even with the extra layer of compatibility, it runs just as if it were native. If another solution appears in the future that doesn't require Wine, I will update that as the correct answer.\n", "Q: Unable to locate package when running apt-get I installed rvm and it tells me I'm missing some packages:\nviggy@viggy:~$ rvm requirements\nInstalling requirements for ubuntu, might require sudo password.\nSkipping `apt-get update` make sure your system is up to date.\nRVM autolibs is now configured with mode '2' => 'check and stop if missing',\nplease run `rvm autolibs enable` to let RVM do its job or run and read `rvm autolibs [help]`\nor visit https://rvm.io/rvm/autolibs for more information.\nMissing required packages: libreadline6-dev, zlib1g-dev, libssl-dev, libyaml-dev, libsqlite3-dev, sqlite3, libxml2-dev, libxslt1-dev, autoconf, libgdbm-dev, libncurses5-dev, automake, libtool, bison, libffi-dev.\n\nSo I try to install them but get a ton of unable to locate package errors:\nviggy@viggy:~$ sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install libreadline6-dev, zlib1g-dev, libssl-dev, libyaml-dev, libsqlite3-dev, sqlite3, libxml2-dev, libxslt1-dev, autoconf, libgdbm-dev, libncurses5-dev, automake, libtool, bison, libffi-dev\nReading package lists...

From personal experience this can lead to the dongle being mounted as a hard drive instead of a network connection \n\nA: 1)first eject the windows driver CD of your modem from \"terminal\" or from \"DISKS\" (default,not automatic), then you can connect modem through network manager (takes 12 sec ).\n2)or use the software or .deb file provided with the modem (automatic, not default, not through network manager(nw) & you cannot use software center).\nI advice to use the first one as it provides extra options like SMS, USSD, contacts, info, scan for networks through modem manager gui .\nyou can add your device id to usb mode switch for automatic eject as soon as you plugin your modem. click here to add your device to usb mode switc \nHope this will help U\nit is not real CD, just a popup memory within the modem..\nproblem is that ubuntu defaultly allows you to use the nw not the .deb file provided by the manufacturer(so your driver CD is not allowed mounted on unity defaultly), for they use usb mode switch to eject the unmounted CD, which does not have id of your modem which is newer one to market. click here to add your device to usb mode switch.\nusing default method is benefit only to users but newer modem gets unidentified and they have to manually add their device id to usb mode switch.\nubuntu 14.04 have updated list & it will automatically eject & you will your see your connection at nw.\nHope this helps U & please leave a comment\n", "Q: How to do a clean reinstall of ubuntu?

It gets to the point it asks me where to install and the ONLY option in the drop down is my WD Passport external drive.    I have not created a partition on my internal drive.   Either way, Ubuntu completes the install, and reboots.   Immediately Windows 7 loads, no option to boot to Ubuntu to try it out.\nIf I go into the boot options by using F8, I can change boot device and my external drive shows twice.    If I select the one, I get a GRUB prompt that says it can not boot.   If I select the other (SES) then it starts into Windows 7 right away (Windows is not installed on that drive, although there is a partition there for backup files).\nIs Ubuntu unable to boot from an external device?   Would seem odd since a flash drive or CD both work.   Or do I need to create a partition on my internal main drive to allow Ubuntu to dual boot?\n\nA: This is probably a /etc/fstab problem.\nYou have to reboot with the live CD, mount the external disk (where you installed Ubuntu), and check the /etc/fstab file that resides on that external disk.\nYou have to edit /etc/fstab to make  sure that when you boot from the external disk,  the root of your filesystem is mounted on that bootable disk (probably /dev/sdb1). \nSee: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fstab \nThen you have probably another problem.\nGRUB sets root on (hd0,0), the first disk, first partition. (but that is the sda-disk, first partition).\nSo GRUB must set root on the second disk,first partition, that is (hd1,0)\nStill running the live CD, you have to run grub-installer.\nSee: http://www.tuxradar.com/answers/677\nAfterwards, check your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file.\n", "Q: Command prompt stopped listening I'm SSHing into my headless Ubuntu 11.04 Server using PuTTY, and I'm in a byobu session.\nI started a mysql_safe daemon because I was trying to fix a password problem I was having with mysql.

I have windows 8 installed on my primary ssd (C). I have an iso file of the 64 bit ubuntu installation on a usb. My question is can I install this directly onto the F drive or do I need to have the USB boot from restart. Also, my C drive is booting UEFI not SATA, I think this is the problem I had when trying the first time. Eventually I am trying to have my initial load screen ask me which OS I would like to boot into.\nWhen I run the iso while in windows it takes me to the ubuntu installer screen where I specify language, password etc.\nThis is not through wubi, I have tried that and got nothing but problems. I wanted a proper opinion before I make another drive useless and have to format.\n\nA: Install Ubuntu while running Windows 8\nNo you can't install Ubuntu while running Windows, you will have to boot from the USB.\nInstall Ubuntu on UEFI enabled hardware\nIn most cases it is just necessary to boot Ubuntu and install it that Ubuntu will handle the UEFI settings for you. Learn more about UEFI here.\nTroubleshooting\nBefore following the instructions given here, see this page.\nAlthough if after installation you don't be able to choose which OS to use and your system simply start Windows 8, you will need to boot from the USB again, enable network connection and use the Ubuntu Boot-Repair Tool.\nIf your problem continues it means that your USB is not being booted in UEFI mode, so you will need to configure the BIOS to use only UEFI/EFI/Non-CSM Mode and if your system support the following features you will need to disable them: Secure Boot and Intel Rapid Response Technology/Intel VT-d/Intel Short Time Response. Some BIOS has an easy option: boot USB in UEFI mode, if you have this option enable it.\nThen just install Ubuntu again, it is better not to choose the option Reinstall Ubuntu, but instead choose the Advanced Options, select the Ubuntu partition and mark it to be formatted and use \"ext4 with journaling\", then install it.\nThen if you still don't get to the \"choose OS screen\" at boot time, run Boot-Repair once more time and everything would get fine.\n", "Q: How to get Ubuntu to use as much Resources as Lubuntu Well.. I love Ubuntu, but it causes my laptop to use resources up, and I don't even know why. it even cause my laptop's fan to run louder and heat up (not overheat, but it does get hot). As soon as I switch to the Lubuntu desktop environment, and do the exact same thing, which is browse the internet using Google Chrome (Uses on tab most of the time) , the laptop's fan is not only quieter, but the computer cool down. I like using Ubuntu for the features but I like Lubuntu for the use of less resources. Is there anyway to apply the use of less resources to Ubuntu to make the laptop just as cool and tranquil as on Ubuntu?\n\nA: If you disable the 3D effects and a bunch of other parameters you might get close. But that is the reason why Lubuntu exists, those optimizations have been done for you so you don't need to do it yourself. Lubuntu might not have all the bells and whistles but that's why its less resource hungry\nBasically its all Ubuntu, they just use a different Desktop environment. The Desktop environment manages the windows, integration of applications, services, indicators, task-bars and all that. The bigger the code foot print the more resources, the more CPU, the more heat...memory and such.\nI use the Gnome Classic interface personally as it is more \"Windows XP\" ish which is desktop focused. The new Unity interface is not usable in my opinion unless you have a tablet. Everyone likes a different way of operating and Ubuntu has all these desktop environments so you have the choice. Sometimes that decision is because of power restrictions, sometimes its a personal taste like in my case.\nIn the end its a compromise between features/taste and what your Computer can cope with.\n", "Q: Screen brightness very dim on a Dell XPS 13 (2013) I just installed Xubuntu 13.04 on a new Dell XPS 13 Ultrabook.

It may even have formatted the /home drive (but DEFINITELY was not told to) anyway my question - how do you get Ubuntu to create new user files or better, use the existing /home/user as most distros do? I have installed it twice now to no avail.\n\nA: You can use the adduser command from the recovery mode to add a new user.\nFor example, if you were to create a user with administrator privileges named john, the command would look like this:\nadduser john --group sudo\n\nIf the old home directory is intact and properly mounted, you could try specifying its path:\nadduser john --group sudo --home /full_path_here\n\n", "Q: Microphone does not work on Asus VivoBook X202E I have recently bought an Asus Vivobook X202E, with touch screen and Windows 8.

I have three options: Digital Output (S/PDIF) Built-In Audio; Analog Output Built-In Audio; and Analog Headphone Output Built-In Audio. When I choose Digital I have no audio at all, in any situation. Although it doesn't matter if I choose Analog or Analog Headphone the audio will be headed to the headphone.\nThen I noticed that it was a problem: I am not able to use the speakers while my headphones are connected, the main point here is not to separate audio from skype, from the other things, I guess (and hope) that it can be easily set in skype settings once the main problem is fixed: set the speakers as primary reproduction devices even when my headphones are plugged in.\n\nA: edit /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output-headphones.conf\nAnd in section [element speakers], try to change switch=on into switch=off\n", "Q: Creating a startup disk on a partition of a USB drive I have a 32 GB USB pendrive which I'd like to use as both a startup/installation disk for Ubuntu, and for regular file storage/transfer purposes. Since the Ubuntu installation stuff only needs a little under 3 GB, I thought this would be no problem, but it has turned out to be harder than I thought.\nMy plan was to create two partitions on the drive - one 4GB that I can wipe at any time and use for installation media, and one with the rest of the space that I can use for data (and won't have to wipe when I create a new installation disk). Creating the partitions posed no problems - gparted did that without complaining - but installing the Ubuntu installation stuff has turned out to be harder than I thought.\nIn the \"Startup Disc Creator\" program, I can't select the USB drive's partiions individually - just the entire drive. And if I don't press \"Erase disk\", I'm not allowed to start the installation. I've tried setting the \"boot\" flag on the partition I want to use, but it didn't matter. It seems the startup disc creator program isn't \"partition aware\" - is it? Or do I need to do this with another program?\nIs there a way that I can create a bootable USB drive where just one partition is used for the installation media? How?\n\n\nA: Use Ubuntu's Disks program. Startup Disk Creator freezes from time to time.\nCreate your partitions using Disks/Gparted, then click on the partition and click on the 'two gears' icon to the right of the '-' then click 'Restore Partition Image'\nRestoring Partition Image is what you want.\nRestoring Disk Image from the main menu formats the whole drive.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I had a USB Hard drive that had some data on it but was about 80% free that I wanted to use to test out Live CDs on. But the “Startup Disk Creator” would only recognise the disk as a whole and wanted me to erase it, despite it having three partitions (two of which were empty and Ext file systems). \nI found a way around this however. I used GParted to delete and recreate the two empty partitions but this time making them FAT32 partitions (the same as the first partition) and also making them both Primary partitions. Once this was done the Startup Disk Creator recognised all three partitions and I was able to use one of them to create a Startup Disk, whilst keeping my content on the first partition. I am not sure why this worked, but it did. \nI hope this is of help to people. \n\nA: Once upon a time, I was experimenting with ArchLinux and read about this issue.\nThe information is on https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_Installation_Media\nThere is a section 'without overwriting the USB device'.\nBut it's talking about the Syslinux-bootloader, not GRUB2-bootloader. So maybe this information is not relevant.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I don't know how to choose the partition before installing, but what I normally do is to install Ubuntu onto the whole pendrive, and then resize it and add the other partitions.\nThis will remove the data already on your drive, though - you'll have to back it up somewhere and copy it back when your done.\n\nA: I use MultiSystem for my LiveUSB drive to try out several Linux distros without installing them, but I think this software might fit your use case.\nYou can keep the live ISOs and your data on the same partition when using MultiSystem, because they do not affect each other and live alongside without concern. That is because MultiSystem install GRUB2 on your drive, managing the ISOs and a couple of tools but not caring about whatever else is on the drive.\nTherefore, instead of managing two partitions, you could create a folder in the root directory of your only partition called \"Data\" (or whatever suits you) and use that folder just like you would have used your data partition.\nAlternatively, you could just drop your data directly into the root directory of your drive, though that would require you to be careful about not touching the files MultiSystem requires to boot your live ISO.\nI never used the Startup Disk Creator, so maybe you can actually just use that tool and create a Data folder on your drive.\n\nA: I was able to make it work with Ubuntu.\nSteps:\ni. Create two primary partitions on your usb drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition#1 Fat32\n\n*Partition#2 ext4\n\n\nii. Use Unetbootin to create startup disk on first partition\niii. Boot from pendrive, select 'Try Ubuntu without installing'\niv. Now start Installation Wizard from desktop\nv. Select language and other options\nvi. Select second partition on Pen Drive as root (/) partition\nvii. Select /dev/sdb (not /dev/sdb2) to install boot loader \nviii. Before hitting Install Now, open a terminal and type: sudo umount -l -r -f /cdrom \nix. Hit 'Install Now', installation should complete successfully\n\nA: I used NetBootin to install to the partition I wanted. My Data partition was NTFS and my Ubuntu partition was ext2, but you could probably use ext4. UnetBootin didn't even acknowkledge the NTFS partition, and instead automatically selected the ext2 partition, and install went well. The Boot Disc Creator didnt work for me either.\n", "Q: Cannot turn off bluetooth in Kubuntu 13.04 I have installed a fresh copy of Kubuntu 13.04. In it I could access bluetooth, wireless without any trouble. But I could not turn this off by just pressing the network button on the keyboard. It is always on. Since I am new to Kubuntu I don't know how to figure this out. \n\nA: Disable Bluetooth on startup\nSource : Is there a power saving application similar to Jupiter?\n sudo nano /etc/rc.local \n\nAnd add the following line before exit 0 \n rfkill block bluetooth\n\nSave & Exit & Reboot\nYour bluetooth is off on startup but you can enable it from bluetooth icon.\nNote: Some time my bluetooth icon is showing its on, but actually its turn off, I have check it many time \nI can verify that its off by\n sudo tlp-stat\n\nWireless Section\n +++ Wireless\n bluetooth = off (software)\n wifi      = on\n\n\nA: Disable Bluetooth (and some other services) from starting up\nSolution involves use of inbuilt Graphical tool \"Startup Applications\". The process involves merely \"un-ticking\" the relevant services. Thus its a simple and intuitive solution.\nThis works under Ubuntu 12.10 and should work in 13.04 too, provided the \"Startup Application\" tool is present in 13.04.\nStep 1- Open the tool by typing \"Startup Application\" in the Dash and clicking on the tool icon. (I hope this tool exists in 13.04 version)\n-- Accessing Dash-(there may be other ways too)\n 1) Press Winkey once\n 2) OR In the quick launch bar, click the first icon. \nStep 2- From amongst the listed services, un-tick the Bluetooth service.\n(Other services can be turned off too, but you should be aware of the consequences)\nNow close the tool..that all. The settings would apply next time you restart the OS.\nNote: One advantage of disabling services is to free up the RAM and processor load but the downside is that if you require these services, you need to enable them manually.\n", "Q: Can't install gcc 4.8, dependency issues I tried downoading 4.8 for 12.04 from https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-toolchain-r/+archive/test/+packages (I did not find for 13.04 as is mentioned here: How to install gcc-4.8) and I think I messed up trying to install it.\napt-get install gcc-4.8 gives : \nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n\nfollowed by a long list of packages and the recommendation: \nE: Unmet dependencies.

If you want to do it manually,\nsudo apt-get update\nand then\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nPlease read about the different options we can use with apt-get regarding update and upgrade\n   update\n       update is used to resynchronize the package index files from their sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched from the location(s) specified in\n       /etc/apt/sources.list. For example, when using a Debian archive, this command retrieves and scans the Packages.gz files, so that information about new and\n       updated packages is available. An update should always be performed before an upgrade or dist-upgrade. Please be aware that the overall progress meter will be\n       incorrect as the size of the package files cannot be known in advance.\n\n   upgrade\n       upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages\n       currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not\n       already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another\n       package will be left at their current version. An update must be performed first so that apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.\n\n   dist-upgrade\n       dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; apt-get has a\n       \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. The\n       dist-upgrade command may therefore remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package\n       files.

See the \"HWaddr\" entries?  Each of those is a different MAC address.  The system stores and remembers each and every hardware you have, so that each of them gets a different label and can be identified as different devices.\nI don't believe you can set it up so that everything can be \"eth0\", if you use multiple hardware.  But, you can change the labels on each interface (do so CAREFULLY).\n", "Q: Nautilus 3.6 doesn't have a status bar?

The status bar acts as a transient overlay, now, so it doesn't take up as much space. It appears when it thinks it has something useful to tell you. If you select some files, you will see a bubble at the bottom of the window with some information about those files.\n\nNaturally, this will not tell you the amount of free space.

Or it will upgrade and install Unity and mix up my whole installation.\nI've read that its not very good to have both gnome and unity or to \"upgrade\" from one to another. It's always better to just clean install the one you like.\nSo my question is: If I upgrade my Ubuntu 12.10-gnome will it keep it (the gnome) or it will install unity and its going to be a big mess...?\nThanks\n\nA: Updates generally are a big mess. \nTry pressing upgrade, it SHOULD just upgrade all your current packages to the 13.04 versions (including GNOME), it shouldn't install Unity unless if something depends on it.\nIf that doesn't work, downgrade to Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (clean install) and add the GNOME 3 PPA (not recommended but will get you the most up-to-date GNOME 3 experience on Ubuntu LTS).\nIf you think a PPA is too risky, just use the command sudo apt-get install gnome-shell to get the repository version of GNOME 3.\n", "Q: Compiling HHVM - how to add libpthread to linker?

The unity sidebar was flickering and I had had this problem before, and installing the AMD Catalyst drivers fixed it (under 12.04.2). Under 13.04, when I try installing Catalyst 13.4 (what a coincidence) it says it is not an executable when I run the .run file using sudo sh or by making it executable under Properties. It is to the point of unusable as I am planning to play a few games on it. Can anyone point me in the direction of good open source drivers or how I can install the proprietary drivers?

Did anyone else manage to get 13.04 to boot up with uefi?\nPS: this pretty much shows what commands I used if thats helpful. and this seems to indicate the problem existed in the beta release.\n\nA: I have heard of bugs in some versions of efibootmgr that can cause this problem. You might try using efibootmgr in an older version of Ubuntu or in a rescue system like System Rescue CD to bypass this bug, if it's the cause.\nIf that doesn't work, you can try copying the EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi file on the ESP to EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. If no other OS is installed, that should get it working. The Boot Repair tool will do this, and more, automatically; it should work even if Windows is installed.\nIf you've got a Windows installation, another option is to use bcdedit in Windows: Launch an Administrator Command Prompt and then type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi. (If you've got Secure Boot active, you'll need to activate shim.efi or shimx64.efi [I'm not sure which it's called in Ubuntu, offhand] instead of grubx64.efi.)\n\nA: A bug in 3.8 series kernels prevents creation of EFI variables (at least on many Asus and Gigabyte motherboards) and thus efibootmgr is unable to create any boot options (the utility itself simply quits quietly without displaying any messages but you can find this error in dmesg or by strace efibootmgr).\nUnfortunately Canonical didn't fix this issue before release even though it was known, and it still doesn't seem to ship a kernel that works or efibootmgr that would print a proper error message. I hope that this gets fixed promptly. Otherwise my suggestion is to use an older version, e.g. 3.5 series kernels work on 13.04, or you could use 12.10 LiveUSB.\nThe upstream kernel patch that broke it:\nhttp://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1303.0/00887.html\nI am not sure if upstream has also fixed the issue yet but there has certainly been discussion about it.\nUbuntu is still broken, related bug report:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1167622\n", "Q: multiarch and Architecture: all packages I have a problem with multiarch: I installed Ubuntu 13.04 amd64 and it works well.

They need to be there, because my principal daily activity is compiling phone Roms, and that takes forever if I do that on SATA2 drives. The problem is, compiling takes up a lot of space; I can build 2 Roms comfortably, but then have to do a make clobber (delete the compiling output) in order to start the subsequent builds. Of course, sometimes I forget to do this, get the warning that I'm running out of space, but by then it's too late - the third build had already aborted because the compiler couldn't write the output. The only thing to do in that case is to delete the previous builds and start over from scratch.\nIs there any way to make the system warn me about low space when there's, say, 5GBs left, instead of just 1Gb?

The root of all that mess was in this message :\n\"invoke-rc.d: initscript mysql, action \"start\" failed.\"\nHere are the steps :\nsudo apt-get purge mysql* mariadb*\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nSome install packages were \"stuck\" :\nsudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/mariadb*\n\nThese symbolic links were pointing to missing files\nsudo rm /etc/systemd/system/mysqld.service\nsudo rm /etc/systemd/system/mysql.service\n\nFinally, this worked :\nsudo apt-get install mariadb-server\n\n\nA: While my current distro is 14.04, My fix should be relevant for similar issues.\nI ran into this dependency/can't configure mariadb problem trying to clone my mysql/ onto a new install - didn't work.\nMy fix:\n - cd /var/lib\n - sudo service mysql stop\n - sudo cp -R mysql _mysql\n - sudo apt-get purge mysql* mariadb*\n - sudo rm -R mysql\n - sudo apt-get install mariadb-client mariadb-server\n - sudo cp -Ruv _mysql/. mysql/.\n - sudo mysql -u root -p ididityay! show databases\n - :D\n - sudo rm -R _mysql\n\n\nA: I posted my answer here but here it is again because I wasted a couple of hours to find a solution (it is obvious now but...).\nYou need to specify version for mysql (dependencies) packets.\napt-get install mariadb-server mysql-common=10.1.19+maria-1~trusty libmysqlclient18=10.1.19+maria-1~trusty\n\nYou can get versions with\napt-cache policy mysql-common\n\nYou can always rollback with\napt-get remove --purge mysql* mariadb*\n\nIf you don't have any data or special config do also\nrm -R /etc/mysql\nrm -R /varl/lib/mysql\n\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 13.04 after installing Windows 8 I have made a BOOTABLE USB installation of Ubuntu 13.04 using pendrive linux.\nI also have Windows 8 on separate partition.

It reportedly has \"up to 8.2 hours of battery life\".\nI installed 13.04 Raring Ringtail (x64) on it a day after it was released, and then gnome-shell.\nNow, with wireless, mobile internet and bluetooth all turned off, and screen brightness reduced, it reported 3 hours of batter life at 100%, and given how quickly it's decreasing that seems to be accurate.\nResults I got from googling:\n\n\n*\n\n*No-one on this forum question mentioned issues with battery life...\n\n*someone suggested that Ubuntu might not manage the fan properly (although I haven't noticed excessive noise) so I installed thinkfan including running sensors-detect as suggested under \"troubleshooting\".\n\n*some else recommended some special grub boot options, but I didn't understand them and in the comments someone suggested they might no longer be necessary\n\n\nI'm going to try rebooting into Windows now to see if it performs better. If it doesn't I'll contact Lenovo support and call it a hardware issue - and of course update this question.\n\nA: I have a Lenovo X1 and battery life is MUCH longer than 3 hours with Raring.  I also make sure I reduce my screen brightness when on battery, and have the following entries in /etc/modprobe.d/powersaving.conf:\n    options i915 i915_enable_rc6=7\n    options i915 i915_enable_fbc=1\n    options i915 lvds_downclock=1\n\nI had these with 12.10 and they seemed to help.  I would also recommend installing powertop, and then running it occasionally to see if you have any rogue processes sucking up power.\n\nA: You could install the package laptop-mode-tools It helps quite a bit for me to save power, althought it can sometimes try to save power a bit too aggressively like powering down the usb port when your usb mouse is being used.\nYou can also try ubuntu 12.04LTS on a livecd, see what sort of estimate you get on there.\n12.04 is quite good on battery on my laptop.\n12.10 was terrible in terms of battery live for me. Sometimes its release specific.\nTry 12.04 out, maybe its just 13.04 specifically although I doubt thats the case. Could be thought.\nYou can also use powertop and powertop-1.13 from the terminal to see what devices are active and which are in powersaving mode. \nI highly doubt that the fans are running for no reason. You can check their temperature using acpi -t (if your hardware supports it) in a terminal or psensor temperature indicator. \nFor some reason or other some powersave features had been disabled in 12.10, those in grub kernel parameters in the article you linked to enable them. Personally I use them.\nAlthought ubuntu 13.04 probably has them enabled by default already.\nSee: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/PowerManagement/PowerSavingTweaks\nSo in the end, theres probably not much you can do other than try a different release or try track down what it is that is eating power and fix it.\n", "Q: How to install a program ending in \".run\" using terminal I am following How to Install AMD ATI Radeon Graphics HD 6770M\nbut at step no 5. i don't know how to do it \n5 - Install Catalyst driver, type the following commands on terminal:\ncd ~/Downloads \nchmod +x amd-catalyst-13.4-linux-x86.x86_64.run\nsudo sh amd-catalyst-13.4-linux-x86.x86_64.run\n\nthis file in the downloads spot how can i use this command to install it\nbecause i can't run it as execute as program\n\nA: Press the super key and search for terminal...\n\nand activate it ...\nNow type or copy/paste these lines one by one (so pressing enter after each line):\ncd ~/Downloads \nchmod +x amd-catalyst-13.4-linux-x86.x86_64.run\nsudo sh amd-catalyst-13.4-linux-x86.x86_64.run\n\nthe 1st 2 commands will show nothing when executed.

Use the Files program to put the downloaded file in your Downloads folder. \n", "Q: How to setup high contrast theme in Lubuntu? I can't find a high contrast theme via \"Customise look and feel\".\nThis is something similar to the high contrast theme in MS Windows.\n\nA: Lubuntu does not include a high contrast theme by default. But you can install one yourself by running sudo apt-get install gnome-accessibility-themes from your terminal. Once the software is installed, you can open Customize Look and Feel to switch to that theme.   \nThere are three aspects: widget, icon, and window border. Unfortunately, the window border aspect isn't covered by the gnome-accessibility-themes package. However, the default window manager in Lubuntu, Openbox, is highly customizable and most of the visual aspects can be altered by editing a plain text file, .themerc located here: /usr/share/themes/openbox_theme_name/openbox-3/. If you need specific help with that you could always ask :)  \nAlternatively, you could look at various sites that offer window border themes. Box-look.org is one such site. And High Contrast BlackandWhite maybe of interest to you.\nThis Lubuntu page has a bit about accessibility concerns.\n\nWidget:  \n\n\n\nIcon:  \n\n\n\nWindow border -- High Contrast BlackandWhite:  \n\n\n", "Q: How do I get the brightness control working on a Lenovo Yoga 13?

Is there another way to do it in Kubuntu (without installing another software).\nMy Kubuntu version is 13.04 and my keyboard a Logitech k350 (I also tried with the virtual keyboard Kvkbd without any luck).\n\nA: The only possible explanation is that it conflicts some other keys.\nEither application-specific, or global ones.  \nYou need to look up the hotkey list if there is anything that grabs your hotkey from the function you want to call. (This happened to me many times in Konsole where Kopete grabbed my shortcuts.)\n\nA: I have similar issue after upgrading to KDE 4.10.2. I'm not sure what's the cause, try this workaround:\n  setxkbmap us\n\nWhere \"us\" would be the short name of layout. In case your're using more variants you can specify it as an extra argument:\n   setxkbmap cz -variant \"qwerty\"\n\nTo check possible options see:\n   man xkeyboard-config\n\nEDIT:\nCreating a fresh new user account solved that issue for me. I've tried before that \n   mv ~/.kde ~/.kde-tmp\n   rm -rf /var/tmp/kdecache-{username}\n   rm ~/.ICEauthority\n   sudo cp /home/new_account/.Xauthority /home/user/.Xauthority\n   chown user .Xauthority\n\nnone of that helps. In my case the problem was also that I wasn't able to display System Settings > Startup and Shutdown > Service manager. Obviously some crucial part of KDE crashed and many dependent services stopped working.\n\nA: Actually it was my mistake. The shortcut names start by \"Quick Tile Window to...\"!\nNow there is another problem. I cannot register the numpad keys as shortchuts (numpad1 is interpreted as 1). But it seems to be a bug running on KDE since a while. I will survive until it is natively supported.\n", "Q: What are the real benefits of upgrading to ubuntu 13.04?

(downloading just at a specified period of a day) I want to limit transmission to work at 02:00 AM untill 08:00.

Perhaps even start it a little (5 minutes?) earlier/later?\nThe only problem I see from this though, is that the service won't be running during the day, when you want to add new torrents. \nSo you'd have to start/stop manually whenever you are adding torrents (per \"session\")\nDepending on your habits, this may/may not be convenient...\n\nA: The Speed Limit in Transmission throttles the upload/download speeds during the time set.

I've been having some issues with battery life, perhaps due in part to the age of the battery, but I'd like to squeeze out every last minute I can. I've heard that 13.04 is developed with mobile devices in mind and has some emphasis on battery life. Can any laptop users report on how it has positively (or negatively) affected their battery life, in relation to 12.04/12.10?\n\nA: Due to the fact that it uses less resources and is therefore faster, and the kernel has better power management, Ubuntu 13.04 has better battery life than Ubuntu 12.04.\nApparently, Ubuntu 13.10 is doing so well on resource consumption that it even works on really ancient and slow PCs.\n", "Q: Nonresponsive while copying files I just switched from Win8 to Ubuntu 13.04 as my sole OS and it's pretty nice overall.  But as the last time I tried using Linux I see I still have problems simply moving large files around and searches around the web say to try the deadline i/o scheduler which seems to be the default in 13.04 anyways and I've confirmed all my drives are set to deadline. \nI have 1 32GB SSD which has my / folder on it, my /home folder is on a ext4 formatted 1TB HDD.  I have 2 more 1TB HDD's of which 1 is formatted in NTFS still.

Often my Firefox browser will dim and not let me do anything as if it's crashed, but will come back after a few seconds. \nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Running 12.04 here. hdparm -tT was giving normal speeds, but cp, dd, rsync were slow, 10MB/s max. Caching kept small data transfers from gumming things up, but anything over 100MB would cripple the machine. If it took less than a minute to get to the console or launch a terminal window while it was working, I'd be lucky. An old copy Puppy Linux had no problems, though.\nThen, I unplugged the USB flash drive that I've almost always got in and booted Ubuntu, no problems. I plugged in and mounted the flash drive, no problems.\nI got the same results from the 10.04 live CD.

(I don't know how / if that works over bluetooth.)\nStep by step:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in the wired internet connection.\n\n*Click on the network-manager icon and select \"edit connections\"\n\n*Create a new connection in the wireless tab\n\n*\n\n*choose name and security as you like\n\n*make sure to select \"mode: ad-hoc\"\n\n*in the \"IP4 Properties\" tab, select \"shared connection\" from the drop down menu\n\n\n*Now click on the network-manager icon again, \"create new network\" and select the network you just configured\n\n*Now your Android device should find the new wireless network, connect and you're ready to go. \n\n\nA: I gave up on Ad-hoc and switched to full Wireless AP which is even better (more then one device can connect), got it working using the script found here http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/how-to-set-up-wireless-hotspot-access.html\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ap-hotspot\n\nsudo ap-hotspot start\n\nap-hotspot\n\n", "Q: Bad WiFi range with BCM4313 Card I have an HP-Envy-4 laptop(dual boot Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows 8) with a BCM4313 Wireless card.

The problem is in the filesystem, not in grub. That's why grub can't see the filesystem. Thank you!\n\nA: This is a possible solution, but it should not be used likely lest your root partition become further corrupted. Running the command: fsck -t ext4 /dev/sda1 This program attempts to search and repair errors on a corrupted filesystem. Replace ext4 with the actual filesystem, you have to know the file system or else the partition will be more corrupted. See this thread for more information.\n\nEven though this question has an answer, there is an alternative way to fix the problem that worked for me. The steps are explained in this painful video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcbTgMKpVHQ . In short, it will reinstall Grub2 altogether instead of repairing it.\nBecause this video is so painful to watch, I'll list the steps below (as I should regardless of how painful it is to watch the video)\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch a live session of Ubuntu. The video uses a live CD where as I used a live-usb. I made sure that the live-usb has the same version of Ubuntu that I had on my harddrive.\n\n*Find where your root partition was mounted. In the video, the user uses nautilus to navigate through each drive that was mounted. It was mounted with a long string of numbers and characters. If this is the case, follow the following steps to remount the partition. Else, procede to step 5.\n\n*Bring up the terminal with ctrl+alt+T and use the mount command to find the name of the partition.\n\n*Mount the partition. Create a new folder in your media folder. sudo mkdir /media/ubuntu. Then simple mount your partition to that folder. sudo mount /dev/sdxx /media/ubuntu where xx of sdxx is determined in step 3.\n\n*Bind the following directories from the root directory of your live cd/usb to that of your root directory on your version of Ubuntu. The directories are the dev proc and sys. Do so with the following commands:\nsudo mount --bind /dev /media/ubuntu/dev\nsudo mount --bind /sys /media/ubuntu/sys\nsudo mount --bind /proc /media/ubuntu/proc\n\n\n*Change the root directory to the one on your ubuntu partition. sudo chroot /media/ubuntu/\n\n*Having done the above, installing Grub2 again will install it to the root directory of your distribution of ubuntu and not that of the live cd/usb's. So go ahead and run sudo grub-install /dev/sdx\nAnd that's how to fix grub using a live-cd/usb. This method was developed by youtube user crazytechzone.\n\nA: Your parted -l output clearly says that your boot partition is /dev/sda1. This might not be recognized by some nice GUI application to fix grub.\nSimplest solution is to reinstall grub via command line. Follow the commands given on this page, and you should be up and running in no time. Remember using /dev/sda1 wherever the page uses /dev/sdax. \n", "Q: Authentication required for every 1 hour for Internet but NO proxy. How do I get out from this problem? OS: Ubuntu 12.04 and/or above\nMy system connected to University campus Internet which has no proxy. But needs authentication (username and password) for every 1 hour. If the web-browser is running with authentication, then no problem for updating/installing packages. But if the web-browser is off or timed out for authentication, then Update/installation can't be done.\nHow do I set it right?\nHere is a screenshot of the authentication:\n\nA: I assume they are using a transparent proxy, that is one you don't normally see at all. \nYou can get to the authentication page again by opening a new tab/window in your browser and try to connect to any web server from there. After reauthenticating you can proceed as usual.\n\nA: You basically need to submit that form (the one mentioned in the screenshot in the comment section of question) again and again every hour to the proxy server.\nSo basically you are looking at hitting a particular URL automatically. This is same as \"generating load\" on the server at the rate of 1 link per hour.\nBasic load generation softwares like jmeter should do the trick.\nYou should use the 'Jmeter proxy' to create the jmeter profile required for auto-hitting the link. This manual will help with that. Once you have that, keep the jmeter running so that it hits the server once every 55 minutes, and you should have good a non-interrupted connection !!\nI am assuming that you have the experience and expertise to use jmeter.\n", "Q: Upgrade release - with fallback options, or do it virtually So then the 13.04 release came along. Unfortunately I have only had trouble with earlier\nupgrades and always ended up in a FUBAR and consequently reinstalling entire system. Would like to avoid that this time.\nI have a box with Ubuntu 12.10 32bit running Gnome 3 classic + various services like BIND9, MySQL, Postfix, Apache, ++.\nAfter some back and forth I've decided to create a clone of current system. If\nsystem breaks I can do a revert.\nQuestion is how to best do this. I can do a clone of the partition with dd, but guess\nthe upgrade would also mean some changes to GRUB and MBR.\nThe current layout is approximately:\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0   7.6G  0 part [SWAP]\n├─sda2   8:2    0  93.5G  0 part /mnt/old_ubu_11.04\n├─sda3   8:3    0  93.5G  0 part /\n├─sda4   8:4    0     1K  0 part \n└─sda5   8:5    0   737G  0 part /mnt/storage\nsdb      8:16   0   1.8T  0 disk \n└─sdb1   8:17   0   1.8T  0 part /mnt/develop\nsdc      8:32   0   1.8T  0 disk \n...\n\nSystem and home reside at sda3.\nFirst thought would be something like:\ndd if=/dev/sda3 of=/mnt/storage/ubuntu_12.10.img\ndd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 of=/mnt/storage/MBR.img\ndd if=/dev/sda bs=512 skip=1 count=3 of=/mnt/storage/POST_MBR.img\n\nProblem with this approach, (I guess), is pseudo file systems like /sys and /proc (so I should probably do it from a live CD/USB).\nWould it be an issue writing such images back?\nWould clonezilla or something similar be better? (Never used it).\n\nAlso; what I would really like to do is use a virtual system. Guess it would be an\n80% or so likeness (due to HW layers etc.). And then run do-release-upgrade  in\nthat by e.g. VirtualBox. Could this be a viable option?\nNotes on changes\nI add this as it was what my question in part started out as – and could probably be helpful to others. I also wonder if it gives an accurate picture of what is going to be updated. Any confirmation on this would be great as well.\n\nNo!\napt-get --simulate dist-upgrade, does not simulate upgrade from one release to another. E.g. as explained here:\n\napt-get dist-upgrade\nThe same as the above (apt-get upgrade sic.), except add the \"smart upgrade\" checkbox. It tells APT to use \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary.\n\"apt-get dist-upgrade\" does not perform distribution upgrade.\n\n(See a lot of notes and \"answers\" around the web that states this as an option.)\n\nAfter some fooling around I tied the following:\ncd /etc/apt/\nsudo cp sources.list sources.list_bak\nsudo vi sources.list\n\n# in vim:\n:%s/quantal/raring/gc \n# Yes, I can do sed -i 's/...' but like to have bit more control.\n:wq\n\n# make log\nsudo apt-get update\ncd /tmp\napt-get --simulate dist-upgrade > quantal-2-raring.log 2>&1\n\n# and better to be safe then sorry so at once:\nsu -c 'cp sources.list sources.raring && mv sources.list_bak sources.list && apt-get update'\n\nGiving me this list of changes.\n\nAs a side note:\nThe /etc/apt/sources.list states:\n# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to\n# newer versions of the distribution.\n\nThat document is outdated and should probably (also) link to this.\n\nA: /sys /dev etc. temp and memdisk fs will not be on your backup as dd will make the dump from the disk only as of the raw read. What will change is the temporary files made to /var/run etc that will remain on your dump. Yes a disk or usb boot could help to override this.\n", "Q: Postgres - could not create shared memory segment: Invalid argument Shmmax, Shmall, I just can't win ;)\nI've tried changing around my /etc/sysctl.d/30-postgresql-shm.conf file a fair bit uncommenting and changing the kernel.shmmax and kernel.shmall a bit but it didn't seem to help.\n#/etc/sysctl.d/30-postgresql-shm.conf \n# Shared memory settings for PostgreSQL\n\n# Note that if another program uses shared memory as well, you will have to\n# coordinate the size settings between the two.\n\n# Maximum size of shared memory segment in bytes\n#kernel.shmmax = 33554432  # Original\n#kernel.shmmax = 41943040  # Tried this (bigger)\nkernel.shmmax = 943040  # and this (smaller)\n\n# Maximum total size of shared memory in pages (normally 4096 bytes)\n#kernel.shmall = 2097152  # Tried with and without this commented out\n\nThen (the error):\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start\n* Starting PostgreSQL 9.2 database server    \n* The PostgreSQL server failed to start.

It seems that the backlight is set to 0 during boot. \n\nA: Thanks to this cool answer, I found another way to automatically set the screen brightness to a decent level at startup:\nIn /etc/rc.local, before \"exit 0\", write the following line:\necho 50 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\n50 was my personal preference, you can set it to any value from 0 (blank) to 100 (highest)\n", "Q: How to remove ubuntu So I originally installed ubuntu to a flash drive with wubi.

After upgrading to 13.04 my Nagios monitoring started to notify me of a problem with my raid setup (mdadm raid). After some investigation it seems the check_linux_raid plugin is not included anymore in any of the nagios plugins packages. At least as far as I could see.\nIs this intentional? If yes, which plugin am I supposed to use for checking a linux software raid?\n\nA: Yes this is intentional.

And thereby possible new bugs? \nIs daily build as stable as the point release?\nPlease suggest.\n\nA: Daily builds provide new features, but are bleeding edge, and might not be suitable for production environment. For day-to-day mission-critical tasks or other tasks which demand certain amount of stability, the stable release 12.04.2 should be used.\nYou can use daily build on virtualbox / as a separate install to test the new features, or develop new features.

How would I set up deja dup to work with that share? I can switch to an AFP or NFS share, if need be.\n\nA: I also have a FreeNAS system on my network, and I used the built-in Ubuntu backup (deja-dup) to back up to the FreeNAS via SSH. (I tried using SMB too, but I couldn't get it to work. This workaround may work for you.)\nFirst, I added a new user to FreeNAS just for backing up Ubuntu. You can add this user via the FreeNAS administration GUI. Since I just need this user to do the one thing, I just named the new FreeNAS user the name of my test machine. If you need a step-by-step on how to do this, please check here: http://doc.freenas.org/index.php/Users\nSecond, I created a ZFS Dataset where the backup will happen. Again, I just named it after the machine. Here is more info on how to create a ZFS Dataset: http://doc.freenas.org/index.php/Volumes#Creating_ZFS_Datasets - I set a cap on the space available to that dataset (twice the size of the hard drive should be more than I'll ever need, but your mileage may vary). After that, I changed permissions so that the new user is the owner of this ZFS Dataset.\nThen, I generated an SSH key on my Ubuntu machine. This Ask Ubuntu thread shows how in great detail: How can I set up password-less SSH login? - I didn't set a password for my key, because I don't think deja dup can handle that.\nNext, I copied the SSH public key into the appropriate box in the FreeNAS User control panel for that user. Make sure your public and private keys are in your /home/(username)/.ssh/ directory on your Ubuntu machine. At the same time, I also set the ZFS Dataset I created as this user's home directory.\nFinally, I set up the backup settings. Here's how my settings look:\n\nBackup location: SSH (available in the dropdown menu)\nServer: 192.168.x.x (type in the IP address of your FreeNAS device)\nFolder: /mnt/(Pool)/(ZFS Dataset) (Use the full path of the ZFS Dataset you created.)\nUsername: (use the username you set up in FreeNAS)\n\nTest it by trying to \"Back Up Now\". If you want it to back up automatically, don't set a password for the back-up. Finally, to schedule the backup to repeat, set the frequency on the \"Schedule\" tab in DejaDup and turn Automatic Backups to \"On\" in the Overview tab.\nIf for some reason it doesn't work, double-check your:\n\n*\n\n*SSH private key is in the correct location on Ubuntu\n\n*SSH public key is in the correct location on FreeNAS\n\n*FreeNAS user has the correct permissions for the ZFS dataset\n\nI took screenshots, and I have more links to stuff, but it seems like this I'm not allowed to add more with limited reputation.

Orphaned packages are automatic dependencies whose \"dependants\" have all been uninstalled. And apt-get autoremove only considers orphaned packages that were installed by apt to resolve dependencies.\nObsolete packages\nAs you probably know, apt keeps a list of repositories it can fetch packages from. But sometimes, packages are removed from a repository. Maybe nobody takes care of (maintains) the package any more, and the (very) old last version available has become a security risk. Or maybe the program has changed its name, the package names were changed accordingly and the old packages under the old name are removed. There are other possible reasons why a package is removed from a repository, as well.\nIf a package is installed on your system, but can no longer be found in any of the repositories your apt has on its lists, that package is considered \"obsolete\".\nOrphaned packages\nAs you probably know as well, apt can manage dependencies between packages. Say for example, a program called \"greatprogram\" needs a library called \"greatlibrary\" to work. So, the package containing greatlibrary can be marked as a automatic dependency of the package containing greatprogram. You won't be able to install the greatprogram package, unless greatlibrary is already installed (or will be installed with the same command).\nBut what if you uninstall greatprogram on a later day and leave greatlibrary behind? In that case, once at least one other package needed greatlibrary as a dependency, but now no other package does any longer. Those \"left behind\" packages are called \"orphaned packages\".\napt-get autoremove\nStill another fact you probably know, is that apt can resolve dependencies automatically for you. Say you want to install the before mentioned greatprogram, but don't have greatlibrary installed yet. apt-get \"notices\" that there is an unsatisfied dependency and offers you to install greatlibrary as well. \napt-get autoremove offers you to remove any orphaned packages that have been installed this way to resolve a dependency. Orphaned packages that have been installed in other ways are not in autoremove's list. If, say, you installed greatlibrary yourself before installing greatprogram, and on a later day uninstall greatprogram, greatlibrary would still be orphaned. But autoremove would not take care of it, because it has not been installed automatically as a result of an resolved dependency.\n", "Q: Problems upgrading dual-boot Win7/12.10 to 13.04 I have a home setup running dual boot Win7 and Ubuntu 12.10. The way I have it set up is using the Windows boot manager to allow choosing OS at boot (Win7 is the first option so the kids can get to it by default), if I choose the ubutu option I get to Grub and boot into Ubuntu. Not sure if it makes any difference but the system has dual HDDs running in RAID-1.\nSo, Thursday evening I allowed the Software updater to update me to 13.04. The app warned it would take 35 minutes to download and possibly a few hours to install. I watched for a while and the download of 1400 odd packages was progressing well, up to about 800-900. I walked away and came back probably 15 minutes later, my xscreensaver had kicked in but was frozen so I don't know where things got to on the download/upgrade. The mouse pointer would move on the screen, but nothing else responded. I decided to leave the computer to see if maybe it was actually working in the background - I left it for about 4 hours and nothing at all changed so I finally powered down.\nWhen I powered up I can still get into Win7 (good news) and hitting the Ubuntu option in the OS selector takes me to Grub2.00-7Ubuntu11, but selecting Ubuntu on this Grub menu gives first a black screen with a blinking cursor then a message:\nGeneral error mounting filesystems.\nA maintenance shell will now be started.\nCONTROL-D will terminate this shell and reboot the system.\nroot@kibi-blah-blah:~#\n\nFrom there I am a bit clueless.

I selected the Linux partition (ext4 with 22 out of 120 Gig in use) and clicked on \"Check\". It's been \"checking\" for 4 hours now - how long is this supposed to take? Or does \"1 operation pending\" mean it didn't even start checking yet?\nAnother Update Oh FFS! It sits there pending till you press the check mark? Grrrr...\n\nA: OK, panic over. After I did the GParted check (and clicked on the check button) it took a couple of minutes to check and found no problems. Rebooting gave me the same errors as before. So using the installation USB stick I went into \"Try Ubuntu\" and then clicked on the Install Ubuntu icon.\nI followed the installation (it's simple as you know) until the point where it asked whether I wanted to erase, install alongside or do something else. I clicked \"Something else\". I found my Ubuntu partition (which was actually discovered as being 13.04, so I guess the upgrade must have been mostly done) and adjusted it so that it had the mount point \"/\" - but DID NOT check the format box, prayed for a moment and pressed \"continue\".\nThe installation I think goes much faster from a USB stick than a DVD, and the longest step was about 10 minutes at the end when it said something like \"updating previously installed packages\".\nSure enough my Ubuntu is back with my customizations and installed apps all here. Hooray! The day is saved.\nNow all I need to do is get into Win7 and run EasyBCD to set up the boot so my kids stay in Win7...\nHope this helps someone - you CAN reinstall Ubuntu without wiping your stuff, even if you don't have a separate /home partition.\n", "Q: Deja Dup (Backup) Not Ignoring Folders The built in backup application on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 13.04 works great.

In Windows my hard disk makes a very audible high-pitch noise (no vibrations), but in Ubuntu it just works perfectly, absolutely no noise.\nIt's all the same whether I'm running Windows 7 or Windows 8, or Ubuntu 12.04 to 13.04!\n\nA: It is probably set to spin-down when the system is idle\n\n", "Q: Unable to shutdown, restart or log out I have been unable to restart, shutdown, or log out of ubuntu since the release of 12.04. I have upgrade at the time of release for 12.10 and now for 13.04 and have had no change in the situation. On logout or restart i get a solid black screen where it just sits.\nI have let it sit for long periods and I get a message every 2 minutes or so stating something about Xorg blocked for 120seconds. I have search extensively and can't find anything that actually fixes it. Using the shutdown now command works from terminal with -P -r. Updating grub had no effect. Any clues or help would be great.\n\nA: Ok, this is usually a hardware issue but could be drivers. Normally if you see it related it X it's a stale video driver. Try updating your video drivers. Finally you can always \necho 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\nThis will effectively quite is symptom but the problem will remain. This is certainly related to either failing hardware or bad drivers. The fact that you can actaully reboot via command line leads me to believe that it's a bad video driver. Make sure your running the latest video driver and that when you upgraded to 12.04 you kept using the same driver you were using when it was working (open v.s. propitiatory).\nAnother thing to look at is making sure you don't have any network shares mounted. When you log out of X network manager terminates a wireless connection. This will cause the system to hang for several minuets per file system read.  During shutdown this can be quite a lengthy process.  The quick test/fix is make sure all remote shares are unmounted before logging out. If that is the case then you should try adjusting your mount commands to show that they are network mounts and should be unmounted before you turn off the wifi connection. This varies by file system and mount type.\n\nA: Try the link listed below.  I looked it up online and the author has an interesting article about shutdown troubleshooting at the top of the web page. He mentions about looking into your log files for any errors messages related to your shutdown and restart issues and other stuff that i wouldn't think of when trying to troubleshoot an issue like this.\nhttp://www.brighthub.com/computing/linux/articles/39504.aspx\n\nA: Found this. It may help!\nOriginally Posted on Ubuntu forums. The problem hasn't happened to me again since disabling visual effects (Compiz Fusion). I have no steps to reliability reproduce the problem; so, I am not sure if it is solved or not.\nTry to disable visual effects by:  \n\n\n*\n\n*right click on the desktop and select \"change desktop background\".  \n\n*Click the \"Visual Effects\" tab.  \n\n*Change it to none.  \n\n\nThis is a per user setting and (as far as I know) has to be changed for each user using the machine.\n\nA: Did you make a clean install of 13.04 or just upgraded over 12.04 ? It's recommended to make clean installs as many things change between versions. In fact 13.04 comes with lot of changes, you should try to install make a clean install (in case you haven't). \nI see you are using \"shutdown\" command with no luck ... Have you tried with \"sudo halt\" still you have to use the terminal, but AFAIK \"halt\" should do the trick. \n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu 13.04 if I don't know how to rezise my partitions? I am trying to install Ubuntu 13.04 (or whatever the latest version is but I'm pretty sure that's it). When I get to the sliders for partition size it goes to the advanced partition-viewer and there's a lot of different things starting with /dev/ when I try to just continue without touching anything it says\n\"Some of the partitions you created are to small. Please make the following partitions at least this large:\n      /2.9 GB\n\nIf you do not go back to the partitioner and increase the size of these partitions the installation may fail.\"\nHow do I fix this? Is there an auto-partitioner where the installer takes care of it automatically? Do I/ how do I fix it myself?\n\nA: if you need to do advanced partitioning I suggest using gparted to handle that then just use the something else option in the installer and just tell it what to use each partition for\nless than 2.9GB is too small to install ubuntu in it entirety to, it is fine for a part of it,\nthis video covers advanced partitioning:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sPGEwqoXA0 \nIf you are trying to dualboot with windows you need to resize windows to make room (defrag windows 1st, unless you are using a ssd)\n", "Q: How to remove Ubuntu installed alongside another version of Ubuntu? I successfully installed desktop 13.04 beside 12.04. Now that I have confirmed that 13.04 works and have retrieved old data files, how do I remove 12.04 to regain file space?\n\nA: GParted should do the trick (sudo apt-get install gparted). Delete the partition that has 12.04 on it, along with 12.04's swap partition (if applicable), resize 13.04's partition to fill the whole disk.\n", "Q: Dual monitor connected to hdmi port not detecting on Dell Vostro 3750 I am using Dell Vostro 3750 laptop with 2 monitors.

Is there a way I can fix this? Or can I remove this Facebook app completely? If so, how?\n\nA: To completely obliterate the facebook app from your system:\nNote: your account must be administrator to do these steps Open up a terminal, enter sudo apt-get purge unity-webapps-facebookmessenger. Type in your password (it will not show up, this is normal), then press enter, then when it prompts you, press yes to tell it that no, you really want to remove the app, wait for it to give you something like username@computer:~$, then close the window.\nSince removing the package misses the .desktop files that create the shortcut, you need to go into the dash, find the app, and drag it to the trash. Alternatively, for people that prefer the command line, find /usr/share/applications, and delete the facebook .desktop file.\n", "Q: Any way I can upgrade straight from 12.10 to 13.04? I am running 12.10 and would like to get to that new 13.04 ringtail, any way I could go about doing this without losing all my programs, images, other data and having to re-sync Google Chrome again and so on? In a way that is more like an update process rather than just replacing 12 with 13?\nAlso I suppose I might ask this while I'm at it, is it even worth it right now to get 13.04 anyway? Is it really stable and cool?\nIn general I'm pretty new to Ubuntu but I was just wondering more or less. Thanks for any help here.\n\nA: To upgrade without breaking things\nYou must be administrator on the computer that you're doing this on\nI recommend going into settings and changing brightness & lock>turn screen off to never, and go into settings>power>suspend when inactive for... to Do Not Suspend, just so your system doesn't break itself automatically.\nI personally find using the command line easier, because I know what my system is doing. To go that path, open up a terminal and enter sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo do-release-upgrade, type in your password (it will not show up, THIS IS NORMAL), followed by enter. Whenever it says something along the lines of \"Do you really want to upgrade [y/N]\" type y, followed by enter. When it says \"config file path/to/file is different from the package maintainer's version\", press enter. Once your system goes through the upgrade process, you should be prompted to reboot, type y, then your system reboots into 13.04.\nIf you want to use the GUI:\nStart up the update manager, then see if it wants to upgrade. If it doesn't mention upgrading to a new version of Ubuntu, you can force it to check for new ubuntu versions by going into a terminal and typing update-manager -c, then selecting to upgrade to a new version. This process will be simpler than using the terminal, as there are much better onscreen instructions, but it usually doesn't tell you anything useful if it breaks.\nUbuntu 13.04 has much better performance, and it's just at the start of its support cycle, so you won't need to upgrade again for a while, and due to release management, the software on it will be newer versions than are ever available on 12.10.\n", "Q: System-V-like utilities won't install The following pacages won't update in my ubuntu 12.04,I just upgraded it to 12.10 and all the updates installed,but these won't:\n\n\n*\n\n*System-v-like utilities \n\n*The elementary widget set library\n\n*runtime datafiles for libelementary\n\n\nThe error log I get is:\n    installArchives() failed: perl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\n    LANGUAGE = (unset),\n    LC_ALL = (unset),\n    LANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\n    are supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nperl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\n    LANGUAGE = (unset),\n    LC_ALL = (unset),\n    LANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\n    are supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nperl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\n    LANGUAGE = (unset),\n    LC_ALL = (unset),\n    LANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\n    are supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nperl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\n    LANGUAGE = (unset),\n    LC_ALL = (unset),\n    LANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\n    are supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nSelecting previously unselected package sysvutils.\n(Reading database ... \n(Reading database ... 5%%\n(Reading database ... 10%%\n(Reading database ... 15%%\n(Reading database ... 20%%\n(Reading database ... 25%%\n(Reading database ... 30%%\n(Reading database ... 35%%\n(Reading database ... 40%%\n(Reading database ... 45%%\n(Reading database ... 50%%\n(Reading database ... 55%%\n(Reading database ... 60%%\n(Reading database ... 65%%\n(Reading database ... 70%%\n(Reading database ... 75%%\n(Reading database ... 80%%\n(Reading database ... 85%%\n(Reading database ... 90%%\n(Reading database ... 95%%\n(Reading database ... 100%%\n(Reading database ... 245770 files and directories currently installed.)\nUnpacking sysvutils (from .../sysvutils_2.86.ds1-14.1ubuntu45.1_i386.deb) ...\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/sysvutils_2.86.ds1-14.1ubuntu45.1_i386.deb (--unpack):\n trying to overwrite '/usr/share/man/man1/mesg.1.gz', which is also in package sysvinit-utils 2.88dsf-13.10ubuntu13\nNo apport report written because MaxReports is reached already\nProcessing triggers for man-db ...\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /var/cache/apt/archives/sysvutils_2.86.ds1-14.1ubuntu45.1_i386.deb\nError in function: \n\n\nA: Best resource I found on this issue is at this URL.

The fs-specific-options part alludes to this:\n\nSYNOPSIS\nfsck [-lsAVRTMNP]\n     [-r [fd]]\n     [-C [fd]]\n     [-t fstype]\n     [filesystem...]\n     [--]\n     [fs-specific-options]\n\n\nFrom man fsck.ext4 (a.k.a. e2fsck):\n\n-f — Force checking even if the file system seems clean.\n-n — Open the file system read-only, and assume an answer of no to all questions.

This option may not be specified at the same time as the -p or -y options.\n\nFurther comments to option -n from this Unix & Linux stackexchange answer:\n\nIf you meant fsck -n, then the filesystem-specific programs are called and passed the -n option, which for most of them means “look but don't touch”. If the filesystem is mounted, fsck will usually find spurious errors, because a mounted filesystem tends to be in an inconsistent state as write operations are happening. It won't lock up your system, but it won't report anything useful either.\n\n\nA: When the system enters a read-only state, it does so to prevent damage to the system.

If you installed Ubuntu on your flash drive, and either the installer or you screwed something up, get a Windows installation disk, and follow this guide: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/windows-bootloader-over-gnu-grub-bootloader/2dd62280-c7e1-43b1-95df-89e86c346ca1 If you just put the installer on a flash drive, then I have no idea how your bootloader got replaced, but follow that guide anyway.\nIt says GRUB rescue, because the thing that loads windows got replaced by the thing that loads linux and can load windows, but the two bootloaders cannot coexist on the same drive, so you need to choose one or the other. GRUB just happens to be setup wrong to load windows, so it's the bootloader that gets deleted.\n", "Q: Ubuntu upgrade from 12.10 to 13.04 failed (interrupted) - cannot access Ubuntu Ubuntu upgrade from 12.10 to 13.04 -> failed (interrupted) and now I want to get my data back.

It warned me that it'll take around 1 hour for upgrade and my laptop was at 80% (2 hrs battery)\nI decided to take a nap, and forgot to put the laptop on the AC power \nI woke up in the morning to find out the battery had died and the laptop was off.\nWhen I reboot, thankfully it showed me both option of the dual boot.

I wait for 5-7 mins to see there is no activity (hard disk light is not even blinking), just the blank purple screen and then I manually switched off the laptop and restarted in ubuntu and again the same issue.\nI want to get my data now, since it's not accessible from Win 7. Is there any way to get it back, also if the wubildr is corrupted, then can I just re-install it without affecting the installed files?\n\nA: Run chkdsk /f from Windows first. Then access your data in the file \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk from Windows through ext2read.\nDon't hard power off a Wubi install. Do a safe reboot instead.\nOnce you have your data you can probably recover the install. If you try to reinstall you will lose all your data because Wubi deletes the old install completely before reinstalling. e.g. by booting in recovery mode and trying to repair packages. \nTo boot in recovery mode, hold down the Shift key after selecting Ubuntu, and then select Advanced options, then the second entry Recovery mode.\nThis should boot to the recovery menu from which you can try: dpkg Repair broken packages\nIf you need more information on any of these steps, comment and I'll add more.\n\nA: You should always make a live session first of the new version and then if everything works do a clean install.The UPGRADE option it's not working well for everyone.And if you dualboot with windows make sure Windows is installed first on HDD or SSD.\n", "Q: Login fails after crash I have been using ubuntu for years, but I am ICT challenged. 12.04LTS recently crashed while I was on the interweb.

So if someone can guide me, it'll be great!\n\nA: When you have your computer running off the usb drive you should be able to see your disk in the file manager. From there you should be able to copy paste the files to say a usb harddrive.\nWhen a disk supports SMART you can see how many hours it has been used in its life, how many powercycles it has had, the current temperature and how many bad sectors there are (if any) and more. If your disk doesn't support it, thats ok. If it supports it but its not working because the disk is failing.. that wouldn't be good.\nYou could manually mount the partition:\nDo sudo fdisk -l to list partitions.\nIdentify which partition is the one you need to access.\nYou will need a folder to mount it to.\nLets make one: sudo mkdir /media/mountfolder Then mount your partition to the folder you just made: sudo mount /dev/sdXX /media/mountfolder\nwhere /dev/sdXX is the partition you wish to mount.\nIf all went well you should be able to access it.

With no monitor connected, xrandr has no information to draw on for setting a display resolution and most likely draws from the resolution set in your Display preferences for the VNC connection.

So I have a Minecraft server and a website and I want two things to startup when the computer boots: Minecraft Server and the Minecraft Overviewer. I want the server to startup in tty1 and the overviewer to startup in tty2. (The apache thing starts up fine and runs in the background.) By the way, the overviewer is just a bash script to repeat overviewer --config ~/overviewer/config every hour.\nHow would I do this?\n\nA: To startup processes in a particular tty on startup, you have to edit this file: /etc/init/tty*.conf. Replace * with the tty number. Add your server's startup script to this file. An example may be:\nexec /sbin/getty -n -l /path/to/minecraft-server/startup.sh -8 38400 tty1\n\n\n(This might not let you log in if your script does not explicitly call /sbin/login!)\nOn retrospect, openvt might be more suitable for your needs. Edit your /etc/rc.local file and add the openvt command.\nopenvt -c 1 sh /path/to/minecraft-server/startup.sh\n\nThe script will be run on startup automatically @ tty1 this way :)\n\nYou'll  want to set up a cron job for the overviewer. cron is a program that schedules tasks (that you define/configure) to run at particular intervals. Read more about cron here. \nA sample cron job entry for the overviewer might look like:\n0 * * * * root /path/to/overviewer/overviewer --config ~/overviewer/config\n\nThis entry will go into the crontab file located at /etc/crontab.\nThe format of a crontab entry is:\nminute hour day-of-month month day-of-week user command\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Primusrun doesn't seem to use my NVidia card I have been installing bumblebee and primus in order to play a few game on my laptop.

I have a 13.04 live USB. How can I upgrade the 12.10 install from the live USB?\nI read previous questions here that answer this question - they all say that the upgrade option comes up when you hit install. In my case, the options that come up are \"Install Ubuntu alongside other OSes\", fresh install, and \"something else\". I tried the first and last of those options, and neither of them showed any option for upgrades.\n\nA: Ensure that your network connection is up and you reach ubuntu repos.\nAccording to How do I upgrade from 12.10 to 13.04?:\n\nInsert the live CD or boot from the live CD to start installing it will give a option of upgrading to 13.04 if we have a functional Internet connection only. It will automatically detect installed applications and install the updated version of your applications also.\n\nWithout network you can't upgrade since Offline upgrade has been deprecated (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseNotes): \n\nOffline upgrade options via alternate CDs are no longer offered for Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server.\n\n", "Q: How to hit Ctrl + C on a terminal so that child terminals do not be closed? This script opens three terminals, but if I hit Ctrl + C where I run this script, all three child terminals will close too!\nFile testChildDetach.sh\n#!/bin/bash\necho $$\nwhile true; do\n    nohup xterm -e \"echo nohup;bash\"&\n    \n    xterm -e \"echo disown;bash\"&\n    disown\n    \n    xterm -e \"echo normal;bash\"&\n    \n    while true; do\n        ps -A -o pid,ppid,command |grep xterm |grep -v grep\n        echo sleep 5\n        sleep 5\n    done\ndone\n\nI need to find a way to keep a child terminal open!\nI can't fork the script like testChildDetach.sh& as it will give back the command line. The real script is much more complex and must not do that.\nHere is Ubuntu 12.10 64 bits (I couldn't make it work on Ubuntu 12.04 too as I remember).\nSee at the output that the parent of these terminals remain the same. I wonder, if the parent terminal/proccess is killed, what happens to the parent of the child processes/terminals? I would expect them to become \"1\".\nBased on the tip given by @amrith92, I managed to improve the script to this:\ntestChildDetach.sh\n#!/bin/bash\necho $$\n\nfunction FUNCdetach() {\n    nohup xterm -e \"echo nohup_detach;bash\"&\n    \n    xterm -e \"echo disown_detach;bash\"&\n    disown\n    \n    xterm -e \"echo normal_detach;bash\"&\n}\nexport -f FUNCdetach\n\nwhile true; do\n    nohup xterm -e \"echo nohup;bash\"&\n    \n    xterm -e \"echo disown;bash\"&\n    disown\n    \n    xterm -e \"echo normal;bash\"&\n    \n    xterm -e \"echo FUNCdetach; FUNCdetach; bash;\"&\n    \n    while true; do\n        ps -A -o pid,ppid,command |grep xterm |grep -v grep\n        echo sleep 5\n        sleep 5\n    done\ndone\n\nNow, when you hit Ctrl + C, 3+1 child terminals will die, but 3 will stay alive!\nAlso, in this case, there seems to be no difference in using nohup, disown or nothing...\nIn short, xterm -e \"xterm -e \\\"bash\\\"\" allows me to hit Ctrl + C and the child terminal stays open! But... I feel like I found a flaw that may be fixed in the future... So I don't feel confortable coding my scripts this way.\n\nA: Run the script itself with a fork &, i.e. if your script name is test.sh, run it like:\n:$ ./test.sh &\n\nEven if the parent process is killed, your spawned terminals should still be running :)\nOf course, if you do it this way, the Ctrl+C will have no effect [i.e, the process will still be running in the background. I killed it with a kill -9. You could also close the shell.]\nAnd to answer your second question, if the parent terminal/proccess is killed, then the parent id does indeed become 1. See the screenshot I've attached :)\n\n\nA: this is a temporary solution IMHO, as I feel to be using a flaw to make it work... anyway if there is a better solution I would still like to know:\ntestChildDetach002.sh\n#!/bin/bash \n\nfunction FUNCdoSomething() {\n    while true; do \n        echo \"CHILD: doing something\"\n        sleep 1; \n    done\n}\nexport -f FUNCdoSomething\n\nxterm -e \"echo \\\"TEMP xterm...\\\"; xterm -e \\\"FUNCdoSomething\\\"\"&\n# wait for the child to open\nwhile ! ps --ppid $! 2>&1 >/dev/null; do\n    sleep 1\ndone\nkill -SIGINT $!\n\nwhile true; do \n    echo \"MAIN: doing something, you can hit ctrl+c here and child will keep running!\";\n    sleep 1; \ndone;\n\nthx again on the tip by @amrith92!\n", "Q: Xubuntu XFCE switcher icons Is it possible to somehow modify the XFCE alt+tab switcher?\nWhat I'd like:\n\n\n*\n\n*use theme icons (for some apps it uses some lowres-non-theme ones, for others it works nice)\n\n*don't make tiny previews for gimp, ristretto, etc.\n\n\nI'm at 13.04 Xubuntu.\nSome apps, that have \"ugly\" icons in switcher: Terminator, Clementine, Skype, Synaptic\nSome apps, that have the nice theme's icons: Chromium, Firefox, Thunderbird \n\nA: I don't think there is a straightforward way to deal with low-resolution icons, other than manually tweaking the icon theme and replacing the offending icons. And I don't think that you can get rid of the previews. \nBut instead of modifying the default xfwm4 task-switcher, you could easily replace it with a different task-switcher like Skippy-XD. So instead of being presented with icons, you would have actual previews of your windows.\nSee Something like 'KDE Present Windows' / 'Compiz Scale' / 'Mac OS X exposé' in Openbox / LXDE / Xfce? for some usage and installation details (and screenshots). But in short you can install latest development packages from Skippy-XD PPA (daily). Then you can bind skippy-xd command to Alt + Tab or Alt + Esc or whatever. \n", "Q: Files 3.6.3 overwrites existing files when merging two folders I've upgraded from Ubuntu 12.10 that I installed with Wubi, to Ubuntu 13.04. \nWhen copying a folder from my secondary hard drive to a folder located in \"/host/\" with the same name, \"Files\" asks me if I want to merge these two folders. After clicking \"Merge\", it overwrites existing files that have the same name instead of asking me if I want to skip replacing them.\nIn 12.10, Nautilus 3.4.2 asked me if I want to skip overwriting existing files. Now, in Ubuntu 13.04 with Files 3.6.3, it overwrites files without asking me, but only when I merge a folder with one located in \"/host\". Maybe it's a bug in this new file manager.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Nautilus was given an over haul so it conforms to \"Tablet\" mentality. They also removed the split screen feature as well (F3). \nSo in short, you can't unless you install another filemanager\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 cannot connect via WiFi but can connect to HotSpot created with Android I've just bought a new computer (Lenovo G580) and installed Ubuntu 13.04.

How do I install ubuntu server system from a usb stick?\n\nA: First you need to download the Server ISO that you require.  Go Here to get either the 32bit or 64bit 12.04 LTS or the 64bit 13.04 version.  Once you get that done, I recommend that you download Yumi to create you bootable USB stick.  Once created, make sure that you switch you BIOS to boot fro the USB stick, and just follow the steps.\nNote: With Yumi you can also add other distros to either install or try, as well as other utilities.\n\n", "Q: PC wont boot either Ubuntu or Windows 7 I installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 7. After I installed Ubuntu ran the first time. After I restarted I couldn't get it to boot. \nI went on Windows and looked for a fix. I tried it in the terminal, not sure what it was, was like sudo (something something). The command that I used I believe moved something (can't remember). \nI then restarted and it took me to the GNU GRUB. I can't reinstall Ubuntu because it won't find a device for boot-loader \ninstallation.\ni think that i had ubuntu working fine when i did the sudo command and that i should have just waited longer for it to start up (could be wrong)\nif i can just boot windows i will be happy so if there is a way from the grub menu i will take that\nfound the command i used not sure if it could have done much harm ---- sudo e2fsck -n -v /dev/sdXY \n\nA: If you only want to get into Windows with the Windows bootmgr, do this:\nWay 1\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the installation disc in the CD drive and boot from it.\n\n*When it shows Install dialog, go to the lower left corner and click Computer repair options.\n\n*Then select Command Prompt and type bootsect /nt60 ALL /force, bootrec /fixboot and then bootrec /fixmbr.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nWay 2\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the installation disc in the CD drive and boot from it.\n\n*After it has loaded and you see the first dialog, press [Shift]+[F12].\n\n*Type bootsect /nt60 ALL /force, bootrec /fixboot and then bootrec /fixmbr.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nIf nothing works\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the Ubuntu Live CD or a similar Linux disc in the CD drive and boot from it.\n\n*Use a partitioning program like GParted to format (delete) your Ubuntu partition. You can also format your entire drive to start it all over with a fresh system.\n\n\nA: e2fsck command is for checking an ext2, 3 or 4 filesystem. It shouldn't do any harm.\nOnce I wanted to restore Windows XP bootloader, but had trouble doing that with Windows installation CD. I've found something called Rescatux. It's a small Linux liveCD for repairing GRUB, MBR and similar things. It has a beta option to restore Windows bootloader. It worked for me, but may not work for you.\nAlternatively you can try to install Ubuntu again (create ext4 partition on unallocated part of hard disk and install it there). If during Ubuntu's installation you are using the advanced partitioning method (not the one with one big slider) then make sure to set your main disk as device for bootloader installation. (Probably it's /dev/sda . Don't choose /dev/sda4 or something else ending with number, because it means \"partition with this number\". And it won't work.)\nAlso it would help, if you could run sudo fdisk -l and paste output here. It shows info about all disks and partitions.\n", "Q: How to use multiple mobile Broadband, one for browsing and one for downloading, at the same time I have two mobile broadband to connect to the internet. When they connected to the computer both are accessible from the network manager, but only one can be connected at the same time. Currently I use the first one using nm one my host OS, for browsing the internet and second one using a guest OS.  \nHow can I use multiple mobile broad band at the same time without using a virtual machine so that I can save the resources used for the virtual machine.  \nI know this is a difficult task and requires command line play. \nThere are several possible ways to answer.\n 1. Like normal broadband (eth0, eth1) using some IP stuff but mobile broadbands can't be accessible using ppp0,ppp1 (unless they are connected using nm)\n2. 1'st network for all application and 2'nd for a single application that downloads say wget. So 1'st device is connected using nm and the other using a special program or something like that (or the downloader th self is capable of that).  \n\nA: You'll have to set up multiple IP addresses (there are several questions on Server Fault for this). Let's say they are 1.2.3.4 and 9.8.7.6; that is, your computer has the address 1.2.3.4 on one mobile broadband network interface, and 9.8.7.6 on the other. You can then control which network interface each program sends requests on by controlling which local IP address it binds to.\nIn the Network Manager, use 1.2.3.4 as your default local address. Your browser and other programs will have their requests routed through there.\nFor your download, specify an option to tell it to bind to the other address. For instance, for wget use\nwget --bind-address=9.8.7.6 http://host.tld/path\n\nor for curl, I think it's\ncurl --interface interfacename http://host.tld/path\n\nwhere interfacename is something like wlan5:1. (You might not even need to set up multiple IPs if you're using curl, since you specify the network interface directly. I haven't tried this since I only have 1 Internet connection here.)\n\nA: It can't be done.\nYou could create route entries to use one connection for certain IP addresses and another for other IP addresses, but on a website, pages and download are on the same IP address so you couldn't distinguish them using this way.\nThis support should be implemented within the browser, but it's not, and I suppose they wouldn't even accept patches to do that.\n", "Q: Facebook icon not visible in envelope menu On a clean 13.04 install, I have registered facebook in the online accounts, authorized facebook to allow ubuntu access, and installed the app.\nBut still I am not getting the facebook shortcut icon in the envelope menu (that I used to get in 12.10) at the top right.

Fortunately 13.04 was released and I did a clean install.\nNow in 13.04, I need some way that is stable enough to get my GPU benefits without spending all-nighters every time I update my system.\nIn that line, I downloaded the NVIDIA Linux drivers from NVIDIA site (310.44 version) shown for my GeForce GT635M graphic card. (BTW is this the latest version? I saw 310.88 somewhere on internet), but now am stuck with the below questions:\n\n*\n\n*How to install this .run file in Ubuntu 13.04 without breaking anything now, or in the future updates.\n\n\n*Is installation of proprietary drivers stable enough?\n\n\n*I am sort of mixed up about the various terms I have read about - primus, nouveau, bumblebee, optirun, etc. Can anyone help me with some accurate and decent reading material/websites where I can read and understand what is what?\n\n\n*Is there a GUI I can use for config and stuff post installation.\n\n\n*Why I am not getting the available drivers listed in the additional drivers section of the settings GUI? For me that proprietary drivers page is all greyed (disabled). There are no device driver options listed. Is there a way to get my Nvidia drivers to show up here?\nAs suggested by Tuxest, the below commands give the provided output:\nResults of sudo lshw -c video :\n*-display                 \n     description: VGA compatible controller  \n     product: 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller  \n     vendor: Intel Corporation  \n     physical id: 2  \n     bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0  \n     version: 09  \n     width: 64 bits  \n     clock: 33MHz  \n     capabilities: msi pm vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom  \n     configuration: driver=i915 latency=0  \n     resources: irq:46 memory:f7400000-f77fffff memory:d0000000-dfffffff   ioport:f000(size=64) \n\nRsults of lspci -nnk | grep -iA3 vga :\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller [8086:0166] (rev 09)  \n    Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc.

Why is Nvidia not displayed in the first command output?\n\nUpdate: I installed the 319 drivers along with bumblebee and the system is running just fine, but have a follow-up question here. I need to update the system kernel, and I am afraid to proceed.\n\nA: I have no experience with these drivers and I don't own such hardware but I will try to give some preliminary information and hopefully it helps a bit.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no special way that would provide higher reliability for something that was installed from .run file. If you want stability then always prefer installing software from Ubuntu repositories – not getting bleeding edge also means less bleeding. I have one tip though. With some run files there is an option to create deb-file from the installer. If you install that deb-file it is much easier to remove/replace it later. I have done it previously with ATI drivers but based on this answer it seems to be much more difficult with Nvidia drivers.\nThere is a good guide about installing run files here.\n\n*Depends on so many things that it is best to try what works best on your system.\n\n*Proprietary drivers are called after nvidia and open source drivers are called nouveau. The rest that you have named are special extras for special hardware. Namely for Nvidia Optimus technology that you have in your laptop. Basically it means you have two graphics adapters – one lighter that is used on regular tasks and other much more powerful that is used when needed. For handling all that complexity extra software is needed and this is exactly what Bumbelbee is for. In theory one could use Bumbelbee both either with proprietary driver or nouveau driver.\nFor Bumbelbee setup on Ubuntu see this.\nAs I read from here you could check   /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf file to see which driver Bumblebee is using. \nPrimus and optirun/VirtualGL are pieces of software that help in 3D rendering (process of generating an graphical images) and Bumbelbee uses them to get its job done. Apparently as they claim Primus is newer and better alternative to VirtualGL. To read more about Primus and how to install it see this.\n\n*With proprietary driver you get GUI rather similar to Nvidia settings in Windows. With open source drivers you can use GUI settings managers that come with Ubuntu. In my experience both options work fine.\n\n*As I understand it from your comments then there is either a bug in your system or in Ubuntu in general or you either have too new hardware (its a sweet machine). The point is that if there are proprietary drivers allowed in your system but Ubuntu doesn't offer driver under Additional drivers then either hardware doesn't get detected or the driver in the repository doesn't support your hardware or something is broken. So it might also be a bug that you should report. In any case, looking at the current situation my advice would be to try set up nouveau with Bumbelbee and preferably start with fresh install as after “trying several things” tends to mess up things. All you need should be in the ppa:bumblebee/stable and Ubuntu repositories. Make sure you follow the Bumblebee guide in Ubuntu wiki. It is always good to try some already tried options again in a clean system when you know better what you are doing and what is what.\nOther tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use synaptic as advised by meteorainer as it is especially good\ntool for such troubleshooting situations. It is as surgical as you\ncan get in package management without being command line guru.\n\n*When you try one driver see before that other driver is removed (in synaptic select to remove completely particular package or on command line use apt-get --purge remove package-name-goes-here).  Having\nopen source driver and proprietary driver installed at the same time\nis very likely to cause problems.\n\n*Keep track of what driver is being loaded. Especially when things are broken. The most important part of solving complex problems is having the data and in this case it means making good notes. There are various options for doing this. For an example you could use:\n\n\n~$ sudo lshw -c video\nor:\n~$ lspci -nnk | grep -iA3 vga\nIf you still get stuck don't hesitate to expand your original question with new information.\nAlso if you find this answer useful click upper arrow in the upper left corner.\nPS! If there is any incorrect information here let me know and I will edit my text.\n\nA: Per OP comment, creating answer....\nI've had great luck just installing the drivers through synaptic. Have you tried that yet? When installing from there, yes there is a GUI for config.\nOn the technical end I'm not really sure if they are any different.  Sorry, I'm still learning Linux.\nWhat I did was load up synaptic and search on nvidia.  You will get several options, just select nvidia-<version>-updates-dev and nvidia-settings-<version>-updates for installation.  The most current version right now is 313, but I had good luck with 310 as well.\nLet those install.  Shouldn't take long.  While you can technically do a sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm restart (or whatever windows manager you are using) I prefer to just restart.  No issues along that road for me.\nnvidia-settings gui for reference: \n\n", "Q: Only root sees all icons in gnome-control-center after upgrade to Lubuntu 13.04 Symptoms:\nroot@ThinkPad:/# gnome-control-center\n\n=> gnome-control-center opens correctly showing all modules\nroot@ThinkPad:/# gnome-control-center sound\n\n=> gnome-control-center opens the sound panel \nanynormaluser@ThinkPad:~$ gnome-control-center \n\n=> gnome-control-center opens showing only 3 modules: languages, printers, software\nanynormaluser@ThinkPad:~$ gnome-control-center sound\n\n** (gnome-control-center:12466): WARNING **: Could not find settings panel \"sound\"\n\nAll files/dirs in \n/usr/share/gnome-control-center and /usr/lib/control-center-1/panels\nare readable/executable for all users.\nTries:\nRe-installed gnome-control-center with synaptic.\nResult: problem is still the same!\nMade an strace as non-root user:\n...\nopen(\"/usr/share/applications/gnome-sound-panel.desktop\", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 15\nfstat64(15, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=634, ...}) = 0\nread(15, \"[Desktop Entry]\\nName=Sound\\nComme\"..., 4096) = 634\n...\nopen(\"/usr/share/applications/gnome-sound-nua-panel.desktop\", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 15\nfstat64(15, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=636, ...}) = 0\nread(15, \"[Desktop Entry]\\nName=Sound\\nComme\"..., 4096) = 636\n...\n\nAny user can read the sound panel desktop files, but the icons are not shown either!\nHow to get rid of this problem ?\nHow does gnome-control-center \"find\" its modules ?\n\nA: If you are running other environments than Gnome, the icons are invisible due to a directive in Gnome's desktop files.\nSee /usr/share/applications/gnome*panel.desktop\nand search in the files for the line\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;\n\nYou could remove this line or append your environment to the list.\nThe possible values are listed here:\n\nhttp://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apb.html\n\nFor Unity you can simply install unity-control-center which resolves that situation for you automatically:\nsudo apt-get install unity-control-center\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 can only work in recovery mode I have just updated my 12.10 to 13.04.

In Iran internet speed isn't very good to upgrade from Ubuntu 12.10 to 13.04. My partition scheme is / , swap and /home. Is it necessary to format the /home partiton? What about the / partition? \n\nA: It all depends on what you want to achieve and/or how you want to achieve it. Generally speaking, you can either upgrade your existing Ubuntu installation, or make a clean installation of the newer version. Your internet connection speed (or quality) doesn't actually matter, you can upgrade from an old version to a new one even offline. If you'll do it offline, here's my advice:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu 13.04 installation, and create a bootable USB installation on a flash memory stick. Instruction here. Note: It can be done on a CD or DVD instead of a memory stick, it won't make any difference. You choose your preference.\n\n*With your newly created USB Ubuntu installation inserted in your computer, restart your computer and boot from that USB. You will be asked whether you want to run a test environment or install Ubuntu on your computer. Select the second option.\n\n*During the installation, you will have several options (upgrade, or make a clean install etc.) You should select the \"specify partitions manually\" option, it's the third one.\n\n*Now it becomes extremely important that you act very carefully, because if you don't, you will very likely lose your important data. You will see a list of your existing hard disk partitions.\n\n*\n\n*If you already have separate partitions for File system (or \"/\", as you say) and \"/home\", that's great. In that case select your existing File system partition and click \"Change\". Mark the \"Format\" checkbox, put \"/\" in the Mount Point field, and leave everything else unchanged. Next, select your existing Home partition and click \"Change\". Be sure the Format checkbox is NOT checked, but set the Mount Point to /home.This will install a fresh copy of Ubuntu on your computer, while at the same time keeping all your data and program settings, which is great.\n\n*If your \"/home\" partition isn't separated, then you shouldn't format your File system. So don't check the \"Format\" checkbox, in order to keep your data and settings.\n\n\n*After that, all that's left is to just follow the Installation wizard's steps (select time zone, Keyboard layout, User profile) and restart the computer once everything's finiished.\n\n\nSo to summarize, if you have a \"/home\" partition, it is very important that you don't format it. As for the \"/\" partition, you can format it freely, however you'll have to re-install some programmes afterwards. But even that's not a problem that much, because all your settings will be restored.\nCaveat: It is good practice to ensure your vital data is backed up BEFORE modifying partitions (whether during an install or otherwise). An unexpected interruption of the process could cause irrevocable data loss.\n", "Q: Guake terminal has space left at the top When starting the Guake terminal in 13.04, there is a space of 1-2 cms left at the top. i.e THe guake terminal top border is 1-2 cms below the screen top edge.\nHow can I fix this as it was working perfectly in 12.10.\nPer the selected answer, its now moved to the top okay, but does anyone have any ideas on the two minor lines at the sides?

It all went pretty well, I can boot both without any problems, but i noticed something strange. I divided the 1 TB hard drive into partitions the following way: 10 GBs for the Ubuntu itself, 8 GB for home, 8 GB for swap, and 25 GB for the windows partition. I partitioned the rest as one FAT32 partition-using Ubuntu's disk utility, which said it is around 930 GBs. However, when I boot into windows, it sees it alright, though it sees it as a 875 GBs partition. My concern is not about the space loss, I just don't know what causes the difference, and I don't know if it'll cause any problems in the future. \n\nA: 930 * (10^9) / (2^30) ~= 866. It is possible that Ubuntu disk utility reports 930 GB (gigabytes = 10^9 bytes), while Windows reports GiB (gibibytes = 2^30 bytes).\nHowever, this doesn't explain why Windows reports 875 rather than 866.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 remove email icon I use GNOME Classic desktop environment on my netbook.

I have tried the live CD for 12.04 Precise Pangolin I bought off eBay seller on my PowerBook.  The OS looks really nice on my 17\" G4 1.33 w/1gb ram and I believe it will suit your needs very well also. It is best to try the live CD first and see how the hardware runs, but you probably know the CD file system is slow.  I have run Ubuntu on Intel PC with similar configuration and it was very snappy.  I recommend backing up your machine and be sure you can restore it from cold, hard metal before you do.  \n{I am hesitant to monkey around with my OSX 10.5.8 partition (no original Apple CDs) and made a small boot partition on a 32GB USB stick, but the installer puts all the files on the Linux partition of 25GB on the USB and then crashes because I made a 3gb boot partition on the USB to keep from modifying my hard disk. I will hopefully get that sorted later - I think I just need to prepare the boot partition with the Mac OS first. This seems the best way to go to run on the hardware before committing to re-partition my drive.} \nJust my opinion, of course.  I am trying to keep my OS intact because I like all the Mac OSX programs, but want a more secure web experience (since no modern browser seems to support the PPC anymore on OSX) so I just want to run the web from the USB, and I intend to strip a lot out of the Ubuntu I won't need.

More or less by accident, I noticed that whenever I had GMail open in a browser, a rattling hard drive would be the result.

I have ubuntu 12.10 on HP notebook. \nI don't see 'enable wireless' option on the control panel.\nCould someone guide me through this.\nThanks\n\nA: 1. First thing to check is you didn't disable wireless with your keyboard (more common than you might think). If you have a networking key on your keyboard see if that fixes it.\n2. If not, do you see the network monitor applet in the top bar, where the battery icon etc. are? There should be a dropdown menu with an \"enable wireless\" setting or something similar. Eg in Gnome Shell:\n\n3. In the System Settings, you should see \"Network\" in the \"Hardware\" section. From there you should be able to select Wireless settings and turn on networking. Again, this is how mine looks in Gnome Shell (yours might be slightly different if you're using Unity):\n\n4. You can also use the terminal, if you're comfortable with that. First you need the name of your connection, probably 'wlan0' but sometimes 'eth1'. Run ifconfig and you should see a number of entries listed. Then to turn the wireless on, run sudo ifconfig wlan0 up, or sudo ifconfig eth1 up.\n5. If none of those work, it may be that you don't have the correct drivers installed. Afaik, HP notebooks are very well supported, so I doubt it is a driver issue. Nevertheless, you can check your wireless card is activated and such using the command sudo lshw -C network as described here. Look for the one with description: Wireless interface and make see if the line configuration: has a driver listed. If you need a driver, check \"Additional Drivers\" under \"Hardware\" in System Settings.\n", "Q: What happens if a HDD of my RAID1 setup fails?

What I'm writing below does not apply to the Adwaita theme which is somewhat \"locked down\" because part of the code was in a binary the last time I looked.  \nAnyway, the following relates to other gtk2 and gtk3 themes. There's a tool available that will allow a certain extent of customization. It has been described by its developer in Customize GTK themes with GTK theme preferences.  \nTo quote from there:  \n\nCustomizing a GTK theme can be frustrating, especially with both GTK2\n  and GTK3 themes lying there. And why go through all the hassle when\n  you want to change just few things. You no more have to! I've made a\n  GTK theme configuration tool that allows anyone to change some basic\n  elements of a GTK theme easily (both GTK2 and GTK3) with a simple\n  interface.\n\nIt requires you to install a ppa:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:shimmerproject/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gtk-theme-config\n\nInstalling this software will allow you to customize quite a few things.  \nIf you really want to fine-tune your theme, you may need to edit components of the theme yourself. These files will be found in the folder named after your relevant theme. Depending on how you've set things up, you may have to look in /usr/share/themes or in ~/.themes.  \nI prefer to have my themes in ~/.themes because the changes will be user-specific and not system-wide (and you won't need sudo). Putting your themes in ~/.themes is a simple matter of creating the hidden folder .themes and then copying over the entire theme folder from /usr/share/themes. You may wish to rename the copied theme folder name to distinguish it from the other. Relevant files could include:  \n\n\n*\n\n*gtkrc in the gtk-2.0 folder\n\n*gtk.css in the gtk-3.0 folder and\n\n*gtk-widgets.css also in the gtk-3.0 folder\n\n\n(To edit these files you'll need a basic knowledge of CSS and how colors are described. Ideally, you'd would use a text editor that allows syntax highlighting. Gedit works fine for this purpose. And to notice the effect caused by any changes you make, you may have to switch to another theme and back or even log out and back in.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu's MIR, and Gnome-Shell's on Wayland = Ubuntu problems since 13.10? If Ubuntu is going to use MIR with Ubuntu 13.10, and Gnome is going to use Wayland with Gnome Shell 3.10, will there be any problems to have gnome-shell up to date in Ubuntu 13.10?\nBecause some dependencies are going to be installed when I will install Gnome Shell right? Or is that what the Ubuntu GNOME flavor was made for? To avoid that problem?\nBut what about people who would like to have Unity and Gnome Shell Desktop Environments?\n\nA: In GNOME 3.10 Xorg will still be the default display server as stated in https://live.gnome.org/Wayland, however in the future version of GNOME (3.12), Xorg is going to be fully replaced with Wayland, yet maintaining some degree of Xorg compatibility. \n\nA: I believe that GNOME will still support X in 3.12. According to https://live.gnome.org/Wayland#Proposed_roadmap, most parts of GNOME will still work under X.\nIf you do not need Unity and Mir/X then Ubuntu GNOME flavor will probably be using Wayland when Gnome switches compatibility. Ubuntu GNOME is a Ubuntu flavor that uses Gnome shell as the default Desktop Environment. It still has mostly all features of Ubuntu but includes Gnome Shell instead of Unity.\n", "Q: XUbuntu 13.04 can't delete icons from desktop Today I installed Xubuntu session in Ubuntu 13.04, but I noticed I can't delete any icons from desktop, when I try to delete one of them I get this error (translated from my language): This feature requires the presence service file manager (as provided by Thunar).\nHow to solve this?\n\nA: Run this command, press [Alt]+[F2] then enter this:\nthunar --daemon\nthat should have been running once you logged in, check your startup-applications\n", "Q: Background lag in ubuntu 13.04 I have some lag when i turn off icons from desktop.

If you do not have access to an external drive, then you could always make a small partition, back up your data to that partition, and install Windows on the leftover chunk of your hard drive. There is no way to install Windows over Ubuntu without formatting, because Ubuntu natively uses an EXT4 filesystem.

This will copy everything including partitions and MBR from your old laptop harddrive to your new (including overwriting Windows). You may have to resize partitions manually though if your new drive is bigger.\nAn alternative and probably faster way, which will also preserve Windows if you want to, would be simply to install a new clean Ubuntu install on the new laptop alongside Windows (How do I set up a dual boot Windows and Ubuntu?), copy all your old files over, and, if you want, re-install the old packages on your new system.\nFor example, on your old laptop, gzip your home directory (eg /home/tamim):\ncd /home/tamim\ntar cvpzf oldhome.tgz ./\nTransfer this to your new laptop using your favourite removable medium and inflate it using:\ntar xvpfz oldhome.tgz -C /home/tamim\nTo keep hold of your old packages/programs, on your old machine run sudo dpkg --get-selections > oldpackages.txt.

To ensure you have the lightest weight possible (and therefore Lubuntu instead of Ubuntu + LXDE), you need to install Openbox.  It may be installed automatically when you installed lubuntu-desktop.  If not, you can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install openbox obconfig \nIf it's already installed then running that command will tell you it is already installed.\nIf you want it to be even more lightweight at the expense of beauty and features, you can run Openbox by itself (without LXDE):\nFrom https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Openbox:\n\nEdit your ~/.xinitrc file and add this line to trigger Openbox when X starts.\nexec openbox-session\n\nThis page will help you with installing/configuring/using Openbox.\n\nA: Yes, if you install the lubuntu-desktop package, you have lubuntu with the apps of unity ubuntu installed, as well.\n\nA: once you install the lubuntu-desktop if you don't want ubuntu unity look here:http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purelubuntu\nit was written for 12.10, it may have some issues with 13.04\n", "Q: Can I update a burned disk content from 12.04 to a newer version like 13.04?

I have tried to edit the grub (nomodeset), but it still doesn't work.\nI have a HP Pavilion dv6-2153eo PC and a ATI Radeon graphics card.\n\nA: I can't help with a boot because I do believe that there are a few problems with the upgrade! There is a note to this affect in the docs. Also the graphics change again back to the stock solution.  So if you don't get an answer, you will have to do what I myself did in this situation. Admittedly I do have another Ubuntu 12.04 partition, but a Win7 partition might also work.\nGet into the other partition and save all your /home/myname files somewhere safe on the other partition. Ensure that they have the correct ownership, i.e. \"myname\", or group me \"myname\". Now download the ISO for 13.04 and burn it to CD or DVD because the USB support is no longer [another note for that].\nInstall 13.04 all new onto the correct partition, with or without swap.

Once installed I rebooted to the external hard drive, I waited several minutes only to see no progress and only a blank screen. Please help.\n\nA: When you install on the external drive, the simplest way to install it would be to make two partitions. First: Make a swap partition. This needs to be >= the amount of physical RAM you have installed to your computer. Second: Make the remaining memory an ext4 linux partition, and set it's mount point to /. Choose the ext4 linux partition and install. Then, set your bios settings accordingly and boot into your new bootable linux drive.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 unable to change background images in user mode I just upgraded to 13.04 this morning. When I signed in for the first time the original background I had used from 12.10 was there but was tiled. So I went to settings appearance and changed the way it was (stretched / tiled / fit etc.) Normally, at least in 12.10 and prior, as you changed your settings, it would actively preview it behind the appearance screen. \nMy issue is simple. In root user everything works fine. When I click on a default image it applies it to the background. It previews all settings before exiting. And overall is less buggy. \nIn my user login, the new logout / lock screen (after pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del) is clear and hard to see. It also has one part of it that is not opaque and just looks bad. I can't change the background.

Windows does not recognize ext4 file system, therefore it will show them as empty and as Primary ones.\nIf you want to read data from those partitions then install \"Linux Reader\" on Windows.\nhttp://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/\n\nA: It is unclear whether you are saying windows recognizes the raid array, or the individual drives that make it up.  If it is a Linux software raid, then Windows won't recognize the array, only the individual drives.  In this case, there's nothing you can do.  If it is a fakeraid, then Windows will recognize the array, but not the filesystem in it, as Curious Apprentice said.\n", "Q: Make a bootable USB for Ubuntu I want to run Ubuntu from a USB stick.

I have a Mac and a Sandisk 16 GB drive. I really want to do this.

Once in the live desktop environment open Disks and check  the path of the drive you want Ubuntu on (/dev/sdb for example). \nLaunch the installation and then make sure you select the something else option.\nChoose the correct drive where to install and create the partition table you wish.

The 0xEE partition is often called the \"protective partition.\" This has nothing to do with an \"EFI partition,\" \"BIOS boot partition,\" or any other GPT partition, except to the extent that the protective MBR is a necessary component of a complete GPT configuration. The protective partition isn't really a partition, either; it exists just to keep GPT-unaware utilities from messing with the disk.\n\n*On a computer that boots in EFI mode, an EFI System Partition (ESP) is required. This partition uses a FAT32 filesystem (FAT16 can usually work in practice, but the spec requires FAT32) and holds EFI boot loaders and related files. When the computer boots, the EFI reads boot loaders from the ESP. Its size is not defined by the spec, but in practice it's usually around 100-200MiB. I recommend creating a bigger ESP, in the range of 550MiB, because some EFIs seem to have buggy FAT drivers that cause problems with smaller ESPs.\n\n*If you install GRUB in BIOS mode to a GPT disk, it will be happiest if the disk contains a BIOS Boot Partition. This partition is typically 1MiB or 2MiB in size, and it holds the second stage of GRUB's boot code (the first stage goes in the MBR's code area). This partition is not required when booting a computer in EFI mode.\n\n\nThe ESP and BIOS Boot Partition can both go just about anywhere, at least in theory, although on an over-2GiB disk, it's best to keep the BIOS Boot Partition under the 2GiB mark.\n\nA: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table\n\"On a disk having 512-byte sectors, a partition entry array size of 16,384 bytes and the minimum size of 128 bytes for each partition entry, LBA 34 is the first usable sector on the disk.\"\n", "Q: How to clean the clipboard?

In the default file manager in Ubuntu 13.04, typing produces different behavior: It used to try to match what you type as a prefix to some file in the current directory; now, it initiates what looks like a recursive substring/subsequence search for files. Is there any way to restore the previous behavior? \n\nA: No, there's no way to restore that behaviour without installing nemo, or compiling your own copy of nautilus 3.4. This \"feature\" (I find it useful, too), was replaced in favour of the new behaviour. To install nemo: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install nemo nemo-fileroller\nNote: AskUbuntu does not provide support for Nemo, and the only people who do are Linux Mint.\n", "Q: no sound in the new upgrade! why did this happen? hello I like the new look of your up grade to 13.04\nI am trying to get my sound to work\nthe sounds says that it is a dummy sound\nhow come the sound card is not working\n\nA: You can try re-installing pulseaudio (more likely if you are using analog audio)\nYou can also try the mainline kernel (more likely if you are using HDMI audio)\n", "Q: Keep losing WiFi connection: Realtek RTL8188CE My wifi connection keeps dropping.

With 13.04 here, I'm planning on wiping my computer and reinstalling. I have two hard drives, and I've heard that LVM allows the two drives to work together, as if they are a single drive.\nI've also heard that it's useful to have a separate /home partition, so it's easier to reinstall and not have to worry about your files being overwritten; however, apparently you can't resize the /home partition, which could potentially be annoying.\nI believe LVM makes partition management easier, so if I use LVM and have /home on a separate partition in the LVM setup, will I be able to resize my /home partition post-installation?\n(Also, feel free to correct me if any of my above assumptions about LVM or anything are unclear/incorrect)\n\nA: LVM itself doesn't enable resizing /home, you can do this even if you don't use LVM. LVM does make it considerably easier to resize the partition, as you can do this with a simple lvresize command (followed by resizing the filesystem if you're enlarging, preceded by resizing the filesystem if you're shrinking). Resizing PC partitions is fiddly and error-prone.\nLVM also lets you transparently spread a filesystem over two drives, if you wish. However I do not recommend this: if either of the drives fails, you would lose the whole partition.\nLVM decouples hardware devices (i.e. disks) from filesystems. With LVM, you have one or more physical volumes (typically hard disks, or PC/EFI partitions on hard disks). You can assemble one or more physical volume into a volume group. You can create one or more logical volumes in a volume group, and each logical volume contains a filesystem (or something else such as swap). Logical volumes don't have to be a consecutive chunk of disk, they can even be spread over multiple physical volumes that belong to the same volume group. All these arrangements are dynamic: you can move logical volumes around and resize them, you can add or remove physical devices from volume groups, etc.\n", "Q: Electricsheep Not Working in Raring 13.04 I just downloaded Electricsheep four days before I updated my Ubuntu software and I fell in love with it. \nAfter I upgraded to 13.04, I'm kind of upset in saying that Electricsheep no longer works. I have no idea how to fix it and I feel helpless with Linux.\nAs I said, it was working completely fine in 12.10, but now with the Raring Ringtail update:\n\n\n*\n\n*I use Xscreensaver to launch Electricsheep.\n\n*When I open Xscreensaver, \"Electricsheep\" is one of the options to choose.\n\n*When I \"preview\" ES or even launch the \"xscreensaver-demo\" in the terminal, it doesn't work anymore; I get an error message.\n\n\nThe error message says:\n\n\"detected another electric sheep process. rendering of sheep is\n  disabled using read only access.\"\n\nDamnit, can someone please help me? I want my trippy screensaver back, it shouldn't be this hard!\nEDIT: I contacted the creator of Electricsheep (Scott Draves) via the link to his email address on his personal website and asked for his assistance. Hopefully the Askubuntu community will be able to fix this problem, I'm sure I am not the only one who is having this problem as I have searched and searched.\n\nA: Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get rid of xscreensaver: apt-get purge xscreensaver\n\n*Get rid of old electricsheep: apt-get purge electricsheep\n\n*Reinstall by following these directions precisely: http://electricsheep.org/node/51\nWarning: This install process is why the software center was invented! ;-) It works but it takes quite a few steps. No need for xscreensaver, unless you want to use other modules. Electricsheep installs as a default screen saver with this installation method.\nGood luck!\n\nA: No, your not the only one having this problem. I upgraded to 13.04 this morning and the same thing happened on my machine but I did notice something interesting as I watched the install. The Ringtail upgrade appears to come with its own XScreenSaver, so you have two instances of it running now. \nHowever, removing both instances of XScreenSaver, then reinstalling only one, does not fix the problem, it introduces a second problem...Electricsheep will run, but it will not generate the fractal patterns, as it seems to lose its connection to the server these patterns are pulled from. \nI am tinkering with Electricsheep now and will update this post if I find anything interesting.\n\nA: I was also unable to get electricsheep to work on 13.04 and 13.10. I tried building the latest version from source using instructions at http://electricsheep.org/node/51 but this also failed to build due to some wxWidget problems.\nHowever, I found a solution which works, but isn't ideal: the windows version works fine under wine. Probably no good for setting it as your screensaver, but if you want to start it manually e.g. along with music in the background, it works fine for me.\n\nA: What fixed it for me was making sure the graphics card was specified in electricsheep-preferences.  For instance, I have an AMD Radeon card which uses openGL.  Typing \"gl\" into the video driver field and restarting Xscreensaver fixed the problem.  So, in a terminal run:\nelectricsheep-preferences\n\nIn the GUI you should see a field \"video driver\".  Depending on your type of driver the options are \"\"gl\", \"x11\" and \"xv\", or leave it blank for the default.\"\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: How to increase the screen brightness control sensitivity? In Ubuntu 13.04, when I use the keyboard hotkeys to control my screen brightness, I only get 5 steps to go from the darkest to the brightest level, for a total of 6 levels.\nHowever, I noticed a really strange behavior. If I click in any indicator, for example, in the clock so the calendar is displayed, while the menu (in this example, the calendar) is being displayed, I get 15 steps to go from the darkest to the brightest level, for a total of 16 levels, but I don't get the on-screen brightness notification though. This also occurs when the screen is locked. Maybe you, dear reader, haven't noticed this behavior so please try it.\nThis shows that somehow Ubuntu knows how to make use of the full brightness sensitivity, but it fails to do so under \"normal\" conditions (e.g. while a indicator menu is not being displayed, or the screen is not locked).\nIt also seems that the thing responsible for the on-screen brightness notification is doubling or tripling the brightness change on every step.\nHaving only 6 levels of brightness is very problematic because you can't adjust correctly the brightness according to the changing lighting conditions of your environment. In Windows in the same laptop, I get 16 levels of brightness as well.\nHow can I improve/increase the screen brightness sensitivity permanently?\nPerhaps disabling the on-screen brightness notification? I could live without it if I get the brightness sensitivity back.\n\nA: I have also noticed this issue on my Hp dv6t-7000 laptop with Intel HD 3000 graphics and a Nvidia GT 630m Optimus card.  I eventually found a fix that worked from the Arch Linux wiki.\nBasically my situation was that acpi_video0 was controlling the back-light, acpi_video0 is for ATI graphics. So, I added the following to the grub command line in /etc/default/grub acpi_osi=\"!Windows2012\"  acpi_backlight=vendor, so now it looks like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash i915.semaphores=1 acpi_osi=\"!Windows2012\"  acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nThen ran:\nsudo update-grub2 \n\nA reboot and the sensitivity is fixed.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Diskspace status bar missing after ubuntu 13.04 update After updating Ubuntu 12.10 to 13.04 the disk space remaining on the bottom of the Nautilus status bar is now missing.\nThe updated filemanager Files, does not seem to have any settings that I can display this with.\nHow do I get it to display the current diskspace remaining on the current drive, at the bottom of the screen.\n\nA: Unfortunately you cannot, because makers of Nautilus (now called \"Files\") removed it along with many other usefull features.

So I tried sudo apt-get install lmms, and it listed wine1.4 as a package to be installed.\nWhy does LMMS need wine to run?

But, it didn't work and the brightness hotkeys stopped working. \nNote that Ubuntu 12.04 works perfectly without a single issue. What can I do to solve the problem in Ubuntu 13.04?\n\nA: I had the same issue but have solved this by doing the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, check your brightness operator by using the following command:\nls /sys/class/backlight/*/brightness this will output like:\n/sys/class/backlight/dell_backlight/brightness\n/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness(in my case).\n\n*Next, check your current brightness by using the following command:\ncat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n(replace intel_backlight to your backlight operator that was output in above command).this will output like455.\n\n*Now, check for maximum brightness:\ncat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness\nthis will output like 4882\n\n*Now, your brightness could be from 0 to 4882 and  you can adjust it by using the following command:\necho 450 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness.\n(I have done it for saving my brightness 450).\n\nA: I had the exact same issue on a Dell Pavilion dv7 when upgrading from a Wonderful installation of 12.10 to 13.04 (so far \"upgrade\" is not really the description I'd use...)\nAnyway, I had to edit /etc/rc.local and add: \necho 8 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nbefore the exit 0, then sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local to make sure it gets run.\n", "Q: Unable to change the brightness on my Dell XPS 15 (L502X) I am using ubuntu 13.04 and I am unable to change the brightness on my laptop and need a bit a help.\n\nA: On my XPS 15, I got it working like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /etc/default/grub with sudo permissions in your favourite text editor, e.g. sudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*Go to the line that starts with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, and add  acpi_backlight=vendor dell_laptop.backlight=0  to whatever is between the quote marks, e.g. my line now looks like GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor dell_laptop.backlight=0\"\n\n*Run sudo update-grub\n\n*Reboot.

I follow the MOTU's guide about packaging, there is a note that advice to do the packaging work in the current development version ( I'm running 13.04 ) and to use a VM. I don't know exactly which is the current development version. Should I use 13.04?\nThanks\n\nA: From the Ubuntu NewPackages wiki:\n\nSubmitting new packages through Debian is the preferred path. But, if your package is Ubuntu-specific or can't go into Debian for some other reason, you can submit it directly to MOTU. There are a limited number of available reviewers, so you may encounter delays here.\n\nSo, you should consider packaging your software for Debian Sid (the Debian continuous \"development\" version) and then, once this is accepted, ask for your package to be copied into Ubuntu repositories (this is called syncing, see the Ubuntu for Debian developers page).\nPractically speaking, and from my own experience, you will have huge difficulties to find a sponsor to review and include your package in Ubuntu directly unless you are really working on some Ubuntu-specific software. It also makes more sense to include your software in Debian as your package will be synced to all other Debian-derived distributions besides Ubuntu. Finding a sponsor in this context will be much easier.\nIf you want to go through MOTU (upload into Ubuntu directly), use the current Ubuntu development version here. At the time this post is written (Tue Apr 30), it is Ubuntu 13.10.\nOn the opposite, if your goal is not to have a package officially included in the distribution, you may consider using an already released Ubuntu distribution. Usually, in this case, building a Debian package is mainly to avoid configuring and recompiling the same software on a set of computers your own. In this case, just choose the distribution these computers are running as an Ubuntu package for 13.04 will not probably be installable on an older release.\n\nA: The current development version should, yes, be 13.04, unless there's some daily build of 13.10.\n", "Q: fontconfig-infinality causes 13.04 boot failure I upgraded my travel notebook (Asus VivoBook X202E 11.6\" Touch Screen, but minimal video,  1366x768 as I recall) from ubuntu 12.10 to ubuntu 13.04.

This should completely remove fontconfig-infinality from your system, along with its PPA.\n\nA: There is a way to solve this, just update the init script for System V for Display Manager in Ubuntu:\nsudo update-rc.d -f lightdm remove\nsudo update-rc.d lightdm defaults\n\nOriginal answer is for mdm.\n\nA: I got help from this in Mint17 MATE: just changed \"-r \" with \"-rm\" to remove repository.

This would also prevent what you are trying to do from working.\nBasically, this means that the form sets a unique cookie along with a token in a hidden form element, ensuring that the person submitting the form is the same person that requested the page.\nOn the off-chance that they don't do this, you could write a script to login via curl, and then place that script into /etc/network/if-up.d/ (as described here).\n", "Q: SSH to the Ubuntu host machine from a Ubuntu VirtualBox guest? I would like to SSH into my host (Kubuntu 12.04 64 bit) machine from a VirtualBox guest running Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit. The host has the latest VirtualBox from the Ubuntu repos (4.1.12). The guest was a preconfigured VM I downloaded from VirtualBoxImages.com.\nThe problem is that my sshd_config does not allow login except with PubkeyAuthentication and I need to be able to use PasswordAuthentication from this VirtualBox guest (for reasons that are probably outside the scope of this question).\nmy /etc/ssh/sshd_config file probably needs to look like this:\nPasswordAuthentication no\n\nMatch Address 192.168.56.0/24\n    PasswordAuthentication yes\n\nWhen I add the match block to sshd_config, ssh terminates with a message like this:\ninit: ssh main process (7352) terminated with status 255\nWhy? What am I doing wrong? I have used match blocks almost identical to that in the past, so I'm baffled.\nThis question is relevant but it didn't help me:\nHow can I allow SSH password authentication from only certain IP addresses?\nI can guess my issue might be related to the VirtualBox network interface...\nIn VirtualBox I'm using \"Host Only\" for Adapter 1 (with the default vboxnet0). With this, the host has an interface vboxnet0 with IP 192.168.56.1. That's the reason for my match block IP address above.\n(I also set up Adapter 2 as \"NAT\" so my guest can have outside Internet access). For testing I set Promiscuous mode to \"Allow All.\" I can ping both ways. And I can SSH from the host to the guest (the opposite way of the connection I want).\nThe host runs denyhosts, but while testing I stopped that service.\n\nA: I found the solution at Unix & Linux StackExchange in this question: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/67334/openssh-how-to-end-a-match-block\nThe answer says:\n\nSo Match blocks need to be at the end of the sshd_config file.\n\nSure enough, that solved everything for me. \nIn fact, it solved my related problems beyond the scope of this question too. My related issue was getting an androVM running and fully function within VirtualBox. I was just using the Ubuntu server for testing to narrow down the issue. In androVM I wanted to use ES File Manager in Android to access files on the host Ubuntu machine via SFTP. Now that works.\n\nA: Put the net adapter in bridged mode on the virtual box, that will let your router assign it a network address, then you can use ssh with any system on the network\njust use ifconfig to get the address for the serverYou don't need a nat adapter\nthen just use ssh user@192.168.100.X\n", "Q: How to find a new HDD I have only shell access to a machine (I'm remote and I ssh in) but I can sudo.

Can someone please clarify? Help is appreciated, thanks.\n\nA: AMD64 is affixed to the end of the name of the file, because AMD was the first to adopt a realistic 64-bit architecture that was backwards-compatible, therefore, Intel has to license the x86-64 instruction set from AMD.\nIn other words, there is no Intel version, and there is no AMD version.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: First make sure that you are connecting to a quality AC source. I had my machine plugged into a long extension cord, and that was part of the problem.\nNext, assuming the Bios is getting in the way, try this:\nEdit /etc/default/grub \nAdd processor.ignore_ppc=1 to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line. \nrun sudo update-grub\nreboot the computer.\nThis is from http://www.woolie.co.uk/article/dell-laptop-stuck-800mhz-linux-fix/\n", "Q: Upgrade to 13.04 from 12.10 I am trying to upgrade from version 12.10 to 13.04 and when i open my software updater it tells me to Failed to download repository information.

The error you're getting has actually nothing to do with your internet connnection (I know, I know, it's very mis-leading). That error actually will not even stop you from updating at all. To get rid of it, open your 'Software & Updates' application, select the 'Other Software' tab and un-check 'CD-ROM with Ubuntu 12.04 'Precise Pangolin''. Try running the update now and let us know if you're still seeing any errors.\nNext, in order to upgrade your Ubuntu to the newest version, you should also check in the 'Software & Updates' app the 'Updates' tab and make sure that under 'Notify me of a new Ubuntu version', it says 'For any new version'. If it does, switch over to terminal (press ctrl+alt+t), and type this:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nAfterwards just follow the on-screen instructions.\nAnd, of course, be extra cautious when you're upgrading your system.

I have a Zotac ZBOX ID84 with Intel D2550 proc and Nvidia GT520M GPU, 2GB memory and 320GB hard disk.\nI tried XBMCbuntu first and it ran perfectly for a few months until I started to mess around with the Terminal. After a re-install I could get the HDMI sound to work again so I installed the latest version of Ubuntu (13.04) instead.\nThat worked fine. The sound and everything worked right away, but the interface of Ubuntu is sluggish and XBMC doesn't run as good as it did in XBMCbuntu. The video playback is slow and it stutters. It speeds up and slows down with the complexity of the video.\nSo, the PC is more than capable to run XBMC and play the videos, but something in Ubuntu (GUI?) slows it down to an unusable pace.\nCan anybody tell me what I can do to speed things up? Since I'm new to Ubuntu I have no clue where to start looking.\n\nA: What helped for me (only for the unresponsive GUI, not the video playback) is in System->Settings->Video Output setting Vertical blank sync to Disabled.\n\nA: IF you want to keep 13.04 or not re-install:\nTry logging out of unity and select XBMC on the login menu.  You can exit from XBMC to get back to the login screen.\nThis requires some extra work to get to XBMC, but it seems to have worked for me in 12.10 and 13.04.\n\nA: Here is the link to the \"how to\" I have used with a similar setup.

A Wubi version would be fine. \n\nA: Wubi doesn't work on UEFI systems that use GPT disks. Every new computer with Windows 8 has a UEFI boot, because that's the only thing that supports secure boot. It works fine with Windows 8 if you boot with BIOS.\nThere's no practical workaround at this time, other than waiting for a fix from Canonical's Ubuntu installer team. The amount of effort required to switch to a legacy BIOS boot and replacing the GPT disk with a MBR partition table setup would negate the whole point of Wubi: to easily install and remove Ubuntu from Windows (for trial purposes).\nAnyway, Wubi support was officially dropped since 13.04 and is no longer an supported install option for Ubuntu: Intention to drop Wubi from 13.04 release.\n", "Q: How to change menu entries in AppIndicator, when it is running?

I am trying out Ubuntu 13.04 and the only thing that prevents me from completely switching is XBMC. I am running XBMC from the wsnipex PPA which is compiled with XVBA support.\nXBMC doesn't like Unity that much and if started normally, it is very unresponsive (see also this question) and will not be able to use hardware decoding. A solution in Ubuntu 12.04 is to use the following script to start XBMC:\n#!/bin/bash\nmetacity --replace &\nsleep 2s\nxbmc\nunity --replace &\nexit;\n\nIt replaces unity by metacity and this solves all my problems, however in Ubuntu 13.04 metacity is ditched, so I would like to know how I can replace/quit Unity there. (Starting XBMC standalone from the login screen lets me use hardware decoding but it is still a bit unresponsive, much slower than the above script for Ubuntu 12.04)\n\nA: As it turns out, it is as easy as installing metacity  from the software center.\nThe unresponsiveness was caused by System->Settings->Video Output where in my case Vertical blank sync should be set to Disabled (I have a slow machine).\n", "Q: Running Ubuntu off USB 3.0 flash drive What is the minimal size USB 3.0 flash drive that I would need to run Ubuntu. \nWould it be as fast as running it of the hard drive? \nWould it have access to all of my laptops facilities? \nI am thinking of investing in a 64 GB USB 3.0 flash drive to run Ubuntu off rather than bothering with a separate partition> DOES THIS MAKE SENSE?  \n\nA: For a Full install of Ubuntu 12.04, and above, minimum disk space recommended is 5GB.\nUltimate speed depends on the make and model of the flash drive.\nSome USB3 flash drives are faster than others.\nYour solution makes sense to me.\nYour laptop should see it as just another drive.\nProbably a good idea to encrypt the drive and home folder as flash drives can be easily misplaced.\n\nA: Really there is no minimum or maximum size, it depends what your plans are.  A large enough flash drive can be used to save any files or downloads that you might need or do.  Keep in mind that the flash drive has to be persistent.  \nNote: Keep in mind that because of the write cycles that happen, the life of the flash drive may be reduced. \nNow as far as the speed issue USB is designed for external and portable use, and is also a high-latency, high-throughput interface.  HDD drive is definitely faster than USB pen drive except for access time.\n", "Q: Radeon HD6450 doesn't work under ubuntu 12.04 server Hardware: HP proliant microserver N40L\nOS: Ubuntu server 12.04 (lsb_release gives Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS, to be precise)\nGraphics card: XFX radeon HD 6450 (http://www.ebuyer.com/272721-xfx-hd-6450-1gb-ddr3-dvi-hdmi-low-profile-graphics-card-hd-645x-znh2)\nSo this microserver has been running ubuntu fine for about six months.

Be aware that sometimes, these ppa contains unstable version but most of the time it is stated in the tutorials or even in the names of the ppa or their description.\nAlso, if you prefer a graphical interface instead of the command line, you can use the Ubuntu Software Center instead of apt-get.\nI would say that the version in the Ubuntu Software Center is preferred but if it is not yet available and if it is stable, add the ppa. Or if you need a feature from a newer release, use the ppa too.\nThe ppa are very confortable, their upgrade also appear in the Software Update.\nHowever, you sometimes only need a few days before Ubuntu release the new version or the software, that's always the case with. Most of the times, if the tutorials are up to date, you can follow their recommendation IMHO.\n\nA: The first command you listed here is used to install packages, whereas the second one is a script which allows you to add external software repositories to your system really easily.\nAn example:\nTyping in sudo apt-get install geary will install Geary, a lightweight email client.\nHowever if you'd like to test a daily build of geary (daily might be unstable) you could add a repository (ppa)\nby doing this: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:yorba/daily-builds\n", "Q: problem when upgrading from 12.10 to 13.04 When upgrading to 13.04 from 12.10 during 'Setting new software channels' the following error message comes. \nW:Failed to fetch http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/dists/raring-backports/partner/source/Sources  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.150 80]\nW:Failed to fetch http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/dists/raring-backports/partner/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.150 80]\nE:Some index files failed to download.

After that you can run the install and select which partition you want to use for Ubuntu by selected \"Other\" instead of \"Replace Windows\" or \"Install alongside windows\".\n\n\nYou can always resize or move a partition but be aware that moving a parition is very slow.\nAlso I don't think you can move a partition if it is the partition that is being booted (I would advise you not to move Windows 8 partition).\nWhat you could do is making 3 paritions\n\n\n*\n\n*A /home partition of 60 GB, that's where your Movies, Documents, Pictures, emails are stored, that's the partition you will want to resize in the future.\n\n*A / partition of 32 GB, that's where you programs are installed (Steam games are in /home, don't worry :P)\n\n*A swap partition of 8 GB, that's where the RAM puts data when it's full. The amount of swap really depends on your need (see this post for more information).\n\n\nPut these partitions in that order just after the partition of Windows you would like re resize in the future.\nThat way, in the future, you would scale down that Windows partition and that would leave you more space for the /home partition.\nAlso, don't listen to people on the internet saying that you can only have 4 partition, with Windows 8, you surely have GPT and not MBR (more (advanced) info here).\n\nA: Yes, you can resize partitions after the fact, using tools like GParted in Linux. In addition to being slow, though, as Benoît Legat says, partition resizing and moving operations are dangerous. They work fine most of the time, but occasionally they go wrong. When that happens, you can lose all the data on one or more partitions. Thus, you should do a complete backup of all important data before doing such things.\n", "Q: Can't load some domain I can't load some domain on my ubuntu 13.04:\n\n\n*\n\n*youtube.com\n\n*translate.google.com\n\n*drive.google.com\n\n*vk.com\n\n\nWhen I ping them they are responding:\nPING youtube.com (217.119.79.59) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from non-registered.plix.pl (217.119.79.59): icmp_req=1 ttl=59 time=21.9 ms\n64 bytes from non-registered.plix.pl (217.119.79.59): icmp_req=2 ttl=59 time=20.5 ms\n64 bytes from non-registered.plix.pl (217.119.79.59): icmp_req=3 ttl=59 time=21.3 ms\n--- youtube.com ping statistics ---\n3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2002ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 20.544/21.255/21.914/0.560 ms\n\nBut they don't load in any browser like firefox, chrome, lynx.

How to install PostgreSQL in Ubuntu 13.04? \nI followed by this tutorial, How to install postgreSQL 9-2 - UbuntuGeek.com\nBut in logs it says:\n\nthe package is deprecated and no longer will be used\n\nSo, what is the package name for the latest postgres? keyring? it doesn't work if it is \"keyring\".\n\nA: I tried to install postgresql-9.2 by following tutorial on postgresql wiki. Unfortunately there are no packages for raring distribution yet.\nWhen I tried to install package for older distribution (precise) I got conflicts with other packages that I couldn't resolve.\nThe only solution I found is to install older version (postgresql-9.1) by:\nsudo apt-get install postgresql\n\n\nA: You don't have to do anything special if you just want the latest Ubuntu-packaged PostgreSQL:  apt-get install postgresql does the trick.\nIf you need the features of the very latest release (9.2 instead of 9.1), however, you need to add the apt.postgresql.org repository.\n\nA: try this:\nwget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ precise-pgdg main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/postgresql.list'\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install postgresql-9.3 pgadmin3\n\nIt worked well for me.\nSource: How to: Install PostgreSQL 9.3 on Ubuntu – Complete Guide\n\nA: You need to run something to resolve the postgresql-common conflict in short with the following (read only the bottom if you just want it to work and don't care why)\nThe long winded reason. Basically the 3rd party postgresql-common (build 141+) says it Breaks: logrotate (>= 3.8). The included ubuntu postgresql-common package (build 140) does not have this problem. postgresql-9.2 only requires a build of 135 or greater of postgresql-common. By running the following commands. This will specify a repository to get postgresql-common from, which in this case the ubuntu provided package of build 140 of postgresql-common while using the 3rd party apt repo to install Postgresql-9.2\nFollow these instructions installing the precise sources repo:\n\nCreate /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list. The distributions are called codename-pgdg. In the example, replace squeeze with the actual distribution you are using:\ndeb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ precise-pgdg main\n(You may determine the codename of your distribution by running lsb_release -c.)\n  Import the repository key from http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc, update the package lists, and start installing packages:\nwget --quiet -O - http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -\n\nCommands to run if you once you have the apt\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install postgresql-common -t raring\nsudo apt-get install postgresql-9.2\n\n\nA: Sometimes it pays off being half asleep... :-)\nI created /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list as described in the wiki link (http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt) in the previous post. But... being half asleep... I did type the this:\ndeb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ wheezy-pgdg main 9.3\nAnd it works like a charm. I now have 9.3beta, 9.2.4 and 9.1.9 running. \n:-)\n\nA: As your log describes the package is deprecated. But more specifically it has moved. From the PPA owner's page:\n\nIn about a year (during Ubuntu 12.04 LTS's life time, but after 12.10 is end-of-life) this PPA is going to be deprecated. Please consider moving to apt.postgresql.org soon.\n\nI had issues upgrading to 13.04 with PostgreSQL 9.2 installed on my 12.10 (as described here). This resulted in me unistalling PostgreSQL 9.2 and upgrading. If you also have this issue, back-up your database or it will be lost when uninstalled.\nAfter the upgrade, I uncommented the PostgreSQL repo in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list and ran:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nIf you don't already have the PostgreSQL repo added, you should follow these instructions, with the exception that there is not a package for Raring (13.04) yet. Just use Precise.\nFor reference, my pgdg.list file looks like:\ndeb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ precise-pgdg main \n\nAnd running the update, I can see it getting PostgreSQL 9.2 from the precise package (Whereas, other updates are raring):\nGet:5 http://apt.postgresql.org precise-pgdg Release.gpg [836 B]\nGet:7 http://apt.postgresql.org precise-pgdg Release [25.6 kB]\nGet:10 http://apt.postgresql.org precise-pgdg/main amd64 Packages [27.6 kB]\nGet:14 http://apt.postgresql.org precise-pgdg/main i386 Packages [27.6 kB]\nIgn http://apt.postgresql.org precise-pgdg/main Translation-en_US\nIgn http://apt.postgresql.org precise-pgdg/main Translation-en\n\nRunning psql --version to confirm this, the terminal outputs:\npsql (PostgreSQL) 9.2.4\n\n\nA: wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ precise-pgdg main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/postgresql.list'\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install postgresql-9.3 pgadmin3\n\nEs justo lo que necesitaba para instalar postgresql-9.1 en ubuntu 14 gracias\n\nA: You can also install postgresql on ubuntu like this:\n# curl -s https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-postgresql/postgresql-common.git/plain/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.sh | bash\n# apt install postgresql-9.2 -y\n\n", "Q: Rebooting caused theme to look like Windows 95 or Gnome Classic My PC has recently received a fresh Ubuntu 13.04 install.

I'm setting up my environments with debootstrap. I'm not using --second-stage option of debootstrap.\nWhen and how do I need to use this option. What does debootstrap do in the second stage?\n\nA: Example of how to use debootstrap --second-stage\nIf you want to debootstrap an arm64 Ubuntu 18.04 image from an Ubuntu 18.04 amd64 host, you would do:\nsudo apt-get install \\\n  debootstrap \\\n  qemu-user-static \\\n;\ndebootstrap_dir=debootstrap\nsudo debootstrap \\\n  --arch arm64 \\\n  --foreign \\\n  bionic \\\n  \"$debootstrap_dir\" \\\n  http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports \\\n;\nsudo mkdir -p \"${debootstrap_dir}/usr/bin\"\nsudo cp \"$(which qemu-aarch64-static)\" \"${debootstrap_dir}/usr/bin\"\nsudo chroot \"$debootstrap_dir\" /debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage\nsudo rm -f \"$root_filesystem\"\n\nThe qemu-user-static package in Ubuntu 18.04 also comes with a qemu-debootstrap script that does basically the same thing as we did, but generalized to all archs. It is not in the QEMU main source tree however.\nHere is my full setup to run the generated system on QEMU full system emulation: Is there any prebuilt QEMU Ubuntu image(32bit) online?\nTested on Ubuntu 18.04.\n\nA: Separating the two stages is only needed if you are bootstrapping a distribution for a foreign architecture (CrossDebootstrap). Ssee the description of the --foreign option on the man page. For example, using a x86 machine to create a Debian/Ubuntu installation for an embedded ARM or PowerPC system.\nThe first stage downloads the needed .deb files and unpacks them into the directory you specify. The second stage runs all of the package configuration scripts, which must be done using the target architecture (or by using qemu-user-static to emulate the target architecture).\nIf you're not building an install for a foreign architecture, the stages are combined and you can ignore the --second-stage option.\n", "Q: Not been able to Shut Down 13.04 After installing Ubuntu 13.04 (not upgrading to it, I did a \"clean install\" removing the older one), I'm not been able to shutdown the system.\nAfter clicking the Shut Down button the desktop environment is terminated and the Ubuntu splash screen blink on the screen and a error in a black sceen (without the DE) just says the following:\nacpid: exiting\nspeech-dispatcher disabled; edit /etc/default/speech-dispatcher\n\n\nA: I've solved the problem through those steps:\nI opened the terminal and with nano opened the file below:\nsudo nano /etc/default/speech-dispatcher\n\nInside the file I changed the RUN property to yes, so the file started looking like this:\n# Defaults for the speech-dispatcher initscript, from speech-dispatcher\n\n# Set to yes to start system wide Speech Dispatcher\nRUN=yes\n\n", "Q: How to reenable networking (wireless still not working)?

It was my lifetime's collection of music. the other 50 gb had windows installed in it and also had Ubuntu 12.10 on it. Now, I uninstalled Ubuntu using wubi and now tried to install ubuntu 13.04.\nI selected 7 gb of partition during the installation for ubuntu and 1 gb for swap data. I remember vividly when I was doing the partition, i selected the new partition table option and it showed me 250 gb. I re-partitioned it to 7 gb and added one more gb for swap data.\nAfter installing, i have lost the entire 250 gb of data. all my music and windows 7 also is gone. When i go to disks and check, there is a 242 gb of unallocated space shown. I really really want my data as it contains a lot of music and im a musician. \nI tried testdisk and it didnt recover anything. Can you guys help? I'm desperate here. \n\nA: Lost Partition\nIf you made a mistake while partitioning and the partition no longer appears in the partition table, so long as you have not written data in that space, all your data is still there.\nGNU Parted\nRun Parted from the command line to recover your partition.\nWhen changing the partition table on your hard drive, you must ensure that no partition on the disk is mounted. This includes swap space. The easiest way to accomplish this is to run the live cd. Parted is installed on the base Ubuntu system. Once at the desktop, open a terminal and run_:\nsudo swapoff -a\n\nNext run parted and tell it to use the device in question. For example, if your /dev/sda drive is the drive from which you want to recover, run:\nsudo parted /dev/sda\n\nThen, use the rescue option:\nrescue START END\n\nwhere Start is the area of the disk where you believe the partition began and END is its end. If parted finds a potential partition, it will ask you if you want to add it to the partition table.\n", "Q: How can I install ubuntu 12.10 with a UEFI boot (win8, without DVD driver)? Dual boot. I tried with a bootable USB, but my computer still went straight to Windows 8. Then I followed the instruction on its website, tried with a windows-installer http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-with-windows \nBut still unable to load Ubuntu, \\Ubuntu\\winboot\\wubildr.mbr\nIs there any way I could load Ubuntu correctly? I think something is wrong with my windows boot manager or something like this.\n\nA: WUBI is incompatible with UEFI, so don't bother trying it on an EFI/UEFI-based system.\nCheck your manual to learn how to enter the firmware setup utility or to get the firmware's built-in boot manager. Using the former, you should be able to adjust the boot order to boot from a USB device before booting from the hard disk; or using the latter, you should be able to boot from a USB device first on a one-time basis. Unfortunately, the details of how to enter the firmware setup utility and the firmware boot manager vary from one implementation to another, so I can't say precisely how to do this. On most computers, it's a matter of pressing Del or a function key at a critical point during the boot process. Some systems eliminate or hide this option in favor of a Windows-based interface, though. I don't recall exactly where the option to adjust EFI settings within Windows is, but perhaps a Web search would turn up the answer.\n", "Q: Lost/Deleted dpkg (package manager for Debian). How do I get it back? OS: Ubuntu 12.04\nAccidentally deleted dpkg. Now, packages can't be installed. So, needs an dpkg installer which installs packages. \n\nA: Depending exactly what you removed, you may be able to rescue the situation by extracting the necessary parts from a manually downloaded .deb file. The trick, of course, is finding a way to unpack the .deb file without a working dpkg - fortunately there's a solution here\nHow to extract and install .deb without the command dpkg?\n\nFirst go to packages.ubuntu.com and download the appropriate .deb file for your OS version and architecture e.g. \nmkdir debroot && cd debroot\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/d/dpkg/dpkg_1.18.4ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n\nNow unpack the deb file using ar in place of the usual dpkg -x\nar -x dpkg_1.18.4ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n\n(replace dpkg_1.18.4ubuntu1_amd64.deb with name of the actual deb that you downloaded). You should now have the following contents\ncontrol.tar.gz  data.tar.gz  debian-binary  dpkg_1.18.4ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n\nThe package's files should be located in the data.tar.gz so to extract the dpkg binary file locally\ntar xf data.tar.gz ./usr/bin/dpkg\n\nIf that worked, you should have a file at ./usr/bin/dpkg\nwhich you can copy to your /usr/bin directory\nsudo cp ./usr/bin/dpkg /usr/bin/\n\n[Note that you could untar the file directly relative to / using sudo tar -C ... but doing it in two steps just feels a little safer.]\n\nIf that works, I'd recommend re-installing the whole thing from the repository for consistency i.e.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall dpkg\n\n(on newer systems, you can replace apt-get by apt).\n\nA: Download the dpkg package for your release from\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dpkg/.\nExtract the file.\ncd to the root of the dpkg source directory.\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nYou may need to download some packages if ./configure fails\n", "Q: How do I install HP DeskJet Ink Advantage 2510 All-in-One Series?

I am running Ubuntu on VirtualBox. İt is extremely slow than other Linux versions such as Edubuntu 13.04 and its previous versions before 12.10. The 12.10 was also very slow. \n\nA: It's because if Ubuntu can't use graphics card for acceleration (probably that's what happens in Virtualbox), it uses CPU for rendering graphics trough LLVMpipe. It makes it appear really slow.\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 and earlier Unity2D was used if hardware graphics acceleration couldn't be used, but in 12.10 and 13.04 Unity2D is dropped in favor of LLVMpipe.\nSome desktop environments that don't need compositing (like XFCE) are still fast even without graphics acceleration.

I urgently need to make a backup before my hard-disk crashes.  I realize this is an unusual request but I actually would be unhappy if my disk crashed.\nHow can I burn a \"data files\" type of DVD from the Windows virtual drive inside of VirtualBox?\nCDBurnerXP cannot see the DVD drive offered by VirtualBox.  In detail, within CDBurnerXP the drop down box for the destination device does not list the DVD drive even though the VirtualBox Device menu has the DVD drive \"checked\" or selected for passing through to Windows, although this might to be the same as the Passthrough setting in Machine, Settings, Storage.  The error given by CDBurnerXP is \"no burner selected\" and the drop down lists \"no compatible drives\" and there are no alternatives given.  (Aside: I used CDBurnerXP because Windows 7 is incapable of deep tree disk burning because backups are an unusual an unimportant matter.  I am on Windows 8 but I am presuming that it continues to have the same problem.)\nUsing Windows File Explorer which used to be called Windows Explorer there does not seem to be a DVD burning operation on offer.\nOpening D drive, which is a blank DVD, fails since it's not a Windows file system, so there seems to be no way to drag a file into it (nor copy-and-paste) as a means of burning the disk.\nIs there a way to use Ubuntu to burn the Windows virtual disk as \"data files\"?  I realize I could probably burn it as one big ext4 file but then I don't know if I would be able to do a restore that would be compatible with the state of the virtual machine.  Furthermore, I would guess that a partial restore of selected Windows data is out of the question.  If I burn a big ext4 file that is the entire Windows virtual machine folder, would that be compatible with meta-data elsewhere in the ubuntu file system?\nEdit: Without anyway to backup individual Windows files, I presume it is harmless to backup the whole virtual machine folder, nuke it, then restore the ext4 file into ubuntu but I would have to make an alternative backup before I would risk testing this.

I just need Windows untouched as its not my laptop.\n\nA: Summary of the comments as solution\nYou have a WUBI installation that was initially 12.04. It was upgraded from within WUBI to 12.10. However, while upgrade to 13.04 the upgrade failed. Now Ubuntu is unbootable. Windows is bootable. There is no valuable data in the Ubuntu.\nNote: The way WUBI works is cumbersome and prone to breakage. It was meant for short term use to try out Ubuntu. It does not work with newer computers. So it was taken out of 13.04. That is, one cannot do a fresh WUBI install with 13.04. I am not sure if that is the reason your upgrade failed or not. In any case, upgrading WUBI install fails sometimes.\nFirst, backup all the important (and not so important) files in Windows. To be safe, make a recovery disk for Windows as well. Even though, nothing should happen, mistakes do happen, power goes off, a cat walks over the keyboard...\nSecond, Uninstall the WUBI version of Ubuntu. Boot Windows and delete the WUBI installation using Add-Remove in the Control Panel. This will remove almost all of Ubuntu except the boot menu choices. The space that you allocated to Ubuntu during WUBI install should be returned to Windows. If after the uninstall disk space is not freed, remove the contents of C:\\Ubuntu. See How do I uninstall Ubuntu Wubi? for full description.\nThird, Install Ubuntu in its own partition as dual-boot with Windows. See the official documentation on how to install. Make sure in Step 4, you choose \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows.\" This will keep your Windows installation and all the data in  it. This will also make next step (partitioning the hard disk) easy. Also see How do I install Ubuntu? \nFinally, Some of the things may not work in a new install of 13.04 (chrome, Skype). See 7 things to do after installing Ubuntu 13.4. for some help with those.\nBest of luck.\n\nA: I don't know what failed, but easiest way is to boot using LiveDVD or LiveUSB, copy your important files from Ubuntu partition to a safe place and make a clean install (overwriting the current Ubuntu).\nBut better wait a bit, maybe someone with better ideas will come here and help you. \n", "Q: how to resolve these problems to install synaptic package manger in Ubuntu 12.04?

It is rather a module containing the libraries and modules for php5-mysql to work with. It shouldn't be a problem for you to install php5 or php5-mysql with that dependency as it won't interfere with your manual installed version of mysql-5.6 (if you did it as recommended in /opt or /usr/local/...). PHP5 will connect against the DB just OK.

It doesn't really work well with Wine, so I'm looking for an alternative.\nCan you tell me if there is a similar program for Linux?\n\nA: R is probably the most famous and most powerful open source statistics application on Ubuntu. It's free but you will need to learn how to use it. If you're doing this stuff all the time, that probably won't be too hard. If programming doesn't come naturally to you, you might struggle with it.\nMatlab has a Linux version and is very popular for statistical analysis. Again, this is a language driven application so there is lots of syntax to learn.\nGNU Octave is free and open source. Less popular than Matlab or R. Language-driven \nagain.\nSPSS is probably the most commercially used application and is probably the best fit for exactly what you're doing (the others will do what you're asking - but you'll need to program them to do it). SPSS is another HUGE application though so there's going to be a certain amount of learning. They have a Linux version (Debian 6 is the latest they support but this should work on Ubuntu too).\nMatlab and SPSS have various purchasing options (depending on your organisation) and they vary in different countries anyway, so I'll let you look them up. If you can put the work in, R is every bit as good as them though, and free.\n\nA: If there are no alternatives to Redatam, you can try running Windows in Virtualbox and installing Redatam there.\nBut better wait, maybe someone else will find an alternative.\n", "Q: Two home folder. Ubuntu 12.10 Hi to all,\nRecently I installed Ubuntu 12.10. It's very nice and I like it very much. I have a few doubts about folders, as I was previously using Windows. In Windows, I have 3 local disks C,D,E. Now I did a partition in Ubuntu following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*partition with system data mounted is / 25 GB \n\n*swap partition is 4GB\n\n*partition dedicated to personal data mounted on /home that is 46 GB,\nbecause I only had an 80GB HDD.\n\n\nMy Doubt is if it is possible to create two home folders, like Windows' local disks D & E, to Store Data in different folders. Does anyone know how to create two folders to store data?\n\nA: If only the folders you use in ubuntu, I recommend ext4 partition with the partition that you can use at any time as an external drive.\n\nA: No you can not create two home folders.\nThere is no need at all to creat /home if you have other drives to keep your data.\nWe use mount flags to seperate certain files for the purposes of preventing loss of data like packages if an upgrade is due.\nYou might want to create a seperate mount point /usr as this is where all your apps and packages will go, and if you upgrade later on there's a very good chance you'll lose these if they're in the same block under /\nIf you're using a seperate mount point /home just to make sure you get enough space for your personal files, then there is no need to, /home is a folder in / if not created seperately, and thus has the same space.\nHowever, if you have no place to keep your data when you upgrade then you will want /home flag to be defined. But most definitely creat a /usr flag.\n\nA: You can mount a partition at any time. If you want it to appear under the folder /home, add it to /etc/fstab.\n/dev/sdaX /home/myuser/myfolder auto defaults 0 0\n/home is where your configuration files are saved.

When I do ldd it tells me that \n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found\n\nI know what causes this problem and reading the solutions on Internet everyone suggesting to upgrade to 12.04 (or 13.04 now!). The problem is that this is shared computer and has several users and in practice I can not upgrade to 12.04. My question is, if there is a way to upgrade only this library? Can I simply copy the so file from my own 12.04 here? If yes, which files should I copy?\n\nA: You will need to upgrade very soon if you want to continue to have support. Ubuntu 11.10 will be End of Life on May 9th. As you say it is a shared computer with several users, it would probably be best to stick to LTS releases, as starting with Ubuntu 12.04, they are supported for 5 years across the board.\nAs for simply installing a newer glibc, it is not so simple. Simply forcing the newr version from a newer Ubuntu release to be installed could result in a completely unusable system. The newer release has a newer tool chain, which the library was compiled against, which may have different optimizations than the older versions, and could result in possible crashes or other errors, even if the system were to appear usable, due to differences in the tool chain. So you should not simply install the new version.\nYour best option here would be to upgrade to 12.04, and stick to LTS releases on that system. \n", "Q: Cannot install guest additions in Ubuntu 13.04 on VBox 4.2.12 I've had the same issue with the previous version but I was able to fix it.

I've seen ways to do this in 12.04 and some earlier but these didn't seem to work on 12.10. Any help with doing this on Ubuntu 13.04 would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: In 12.10 I used thunderbird initially, but then moved to evolution as I found the GUI much more productively designed, esp as I use OUtlook at work.\nThere is the evolution-ews package which allows you using the Exchange web services (EWS) directly to help you better integrate the client with the server. BUt I was unable to set it up correctly with Exchange 365 server I use. It may be possible to do so as I didn't have much time to research back then.

Printer was working fine on Ubuntu 12.10.  Searched for HPLIP on the hp.com website.  Ubuntu 12.10 is the highest OS release listed on the hp driver site.  Ubuntu software center indicates that HPLIP 3.13.3-1 is already installed.  Did an uninstall/reinstall -- same problem.  How to get this printer working in U13.04? \nUpdate 5/1/13 -- The repository for HPLIP (HP Linux Imaging and Printing) is found at http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/index.html .  Highest Ubuntu release listed at that site is 12.10.  Ubuntu 13.04 may be too new for HPLIP compatibility to be worked out.

First I made a live usb with no persistence, and it runs fine on every machine I have tested. But changing options like keyboard style, wireless passwords and so on every boot is no good. So I re-write a live usb with persistence, and it runs ok. It boots slower than the stick with no persistence, but every thing seems to be ok. I decided to make a software update, and it gaves me an error (witch I not remember exactly) on the end of process. In the same boot I try to remove the english translation pack, due I'm speak portuguese. Everything seems to be ok, I rebooted the machine, and the lubuntu screen (after choose to try without changes on computer) go to an weird text mode, the boot take more time to complete, and when the system is ready, the screen resolution is wrong, with less definition and feels like streched, and so my wi-fi connection doesn't work. I'm able to choose enable network, but nothing happens. I believe that if I re-write my usb stick the problem can be solved, but I'm looking for a less invasive intervention. Oh, I forget to mention that I tried to change the screen resolution when booted, but no options fits my screen.\nSorry for my bad english, thanks for help.\n\nA: A persistent Live USB is not a full install. Software updates may fail because there may not be enough space in the USB. Doing extensive modification to the OS in a persistent USB may give you unintended results. I recommend a full install in USB as described in How do I Install Lubuntu 12.04 on a USB drive (the full installation)?\nTo do a full install on a USB, you will need a media to install from. This can be a (persistent) Live USB or a Live DVD. \nA few things to remember:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use a Live USB to install from, you will need a second USB\nto install to. In other words, you cannot use just one USB.\n\n*The USB for full install needs to be at least 8GB, preferably more. A\nfull install takes more space than a persistent live USB. Then\nupdates and personal data will take even more space.\n\n*If you use 2 USBs and the computer has a working hard disk(s). It is\nvery important not to get confused between these things while\ninstallation. A full installation in the target USB will erase\neverything in that USB. If you target a hard drive instead of the\nright USB, you will lose all the data in that hard drive!\n\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: resize non-adjacent partitions? I have a dual boot with three main partitions, one each for Ubuntu, Windows, and my files. I want to make the one with Windows (\"OS\") a bit larger, which would have to be at the expense of the one with my files (\"BSpace\"), but when looking in GParted I find they are not adjacent to each other. Even if I shrink \"BSpace\" I couldn't extend \"OS\" into the gap... \n...or can I? \nI'm a bit uncertain and don't want to mess up the whole system (even if I have a backup)\nAll suggestions welcome\nThanks!\n\nA: Open \"File system support\" from the Gparted menu, and ensure that the intersection of \"Resize\" and \"ntfs\" is checked. If not, then install the ntfs-3g package:\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-3g\n\nIn some cases, there are very small gaps which cannot be filled. For example, logical partitions are preceded by an Extended Boot Record, which describes the following partition. However, you should be able to fill all of the remaining empty space.\n", "Q: How can I install git-annex assistant I install recently git annex in ubuntu 12.10 using APT.

I have an IBM thinkpad T42 with a 1.7 GHz processor and 1 gig of Ram.\n\nA: The main reason for this is that \"Unity 2d\" is removed in 12.10, and if you don't have proper graphics support (or a really good processor) Unity3D will run slow.\nThis is because Unity3D will be running through LLVMpipe, which basically runs all the graphics on the main processor.\nThe website mentioned on the error box states:\n\nIf you choose to continue anyway, Ubuntu will try to run using\n  software rendering (via LLVMpipe). While llvmpipe is pretty good on\n  modern CPUs, if your video card is old your CPU is likely old too, and\n  it may result in unusable performance.\nAlternatives may include sticking with an old ubuntu release or\n  switching to one of the lighter weight derivatives or Debian. For\n  12.04 and 12.10, ubuntu-classic (no effects) is also a feasible option.

Or even how to just uninstall Ubuntu altogether? I tried the os-uninstaller, but that doesn't seem to work [exist] with a 13.04 usb stick. I guess I can try putting an older version of ubuntu on the stick and see if I can install to the os-uninstaller.\n[edit] I successfully uninstalled 13.04 by booting linux-secure-12.10-64bit.iso from USB and running os-uninstall.\nI also tried the boot-repair tool, but all that did was add another Win7 entry into the grub menu (one for dev/sda1 and another for dev/sda2, and both work and boot to Win7... http://paste.ubuntu.com/5616403).\nFrom what I can tell, I don't have UEFI, just normal BIOS.\n\nA: By the sound of things, you did well to uninstall the (broken) install.\nIf your computer is back to normal, ie. you have the Win 7 boot entry (which boots you into win 7 error-free) on boot and no spurious linux/ubuntu problems coming up then I suggest BEFORE installing ubuntu of ANY kind again, or any O/S for that matter, to PARTITION your harddrive.\nYou say you have 1TB, which is more than enough to divide into a decent set of neat partitions, so windows is allowed, say 200Gig, Ubuntu is allowed 200Gig, maybe another 100Gig partition for data (music / videos etc.) ,a temp partition for incoming (downloading) files, 200Gig for installed Windows programs and another 100 installation files - which would leave 100 GIg for a recycler partition - These O/S' / data partitions  would also need backup partitions if possible - the amounts are really up to you.\nFor  advice on partitioning your hard drive, there  will be many people who do things different ways, Then you'll need space for backups etc. and also you need to think ahead about what happens if a part of you harddrive fails or if you need to only partially delete a broken install but keep the installation files so try to keep the partitions not overly large and roughly the same kind of sizes yet also keep them more than large enough to accommodate any updates (it's a balancing trick). A couple of 500Meg (1/2 Gig) Linux-Swap partitions are nice as well.\nGive your O/S es the amount of room they need corresponding to how much you expect to be using them and how big and what programs you will be running, but you can always change the size of them relatively easily as long as the partitions are kept defragmented regularly!\nEx. my Pc has only 80 Gigs so I have 37Gig for Win7 64-bit (I'm already running low on room), 30Gig for Ubuntu 32bit 12.04 (also a tight squeeze), 12 Gig for playing with (I'm currently using it for Android Virualbox project work but might stick ubuntu 64 bit 13.04 server on there) and two 500Meg swap partitions. Like I say, 80Gig is really too small these days, so with 1TB I would definitely look at giving at least 100Gigs to each of my partitions and then if needing to, merging them together at a later stage.\nBear in mind that mindows formats it's partitions as NTFS and ubuntu formats its ones as  ext4 filesystems which are not mutually compatible... ubuntu can \"read\" wndows, but not vice-versa. So - like I say - draw a plan up dividing up your 1TB (on paper) then take it from there, using \"gparted\" during a live CD boot of ubuntu. This will make sure your 1TB is just how you need it!\nThe reason I say all this is because I suspect this is why you are having problems with your dual-boot... Two operating systems can sit side-by-side but having everything on a single 1TB partition is a bit drastic.. what if something goes wrong with windows? Keeping everything \"protected\" keeps buffers in  your data so you can manipulate it and install / uninstall / backup a whole lot more easily. \nSo, boot your Ubuntu Live CD, run \"gparted\" and shrink your main 1TB partition to whatever you want for your main win 7 partition. Then \"slice\" up (still using gparted) the rest of your drive for your Ubuntu / data / backup / temp / swap etc. etc. files... make sure you have the main win 7 partition as master boot, and make sure you don't leave any \"unallocated\" (wasted) space knocking about! Read up on how others utilize their space for different O/S first!\nPractice makes perfect, chances are you will have to play about with gparted a bit before you are happy with your setup.\nThen to try installing Ubuntu - boot the Live CD and install it to one of your ext4-formatted partitions as the place to put it. You WILL most likely lose Grub, but this isn't a major problem. As long as you have a working Live CD of Ubuntu to boot into and an internet connection, just burn a CD of \"Super Grub\" beforehand (or Boot-repair CD). This is a boot-CD which will basically detect all the operating systems on your 1TB Drive and let you boot into any one of them (as long as they are working!).\nOnce you are into your Ubuntu O/S, then you can repair your grub(2) onto to your main Ubuntu partition (ie. put the menu list back to normal with win7 Ubuntu debug memtest options etc. etc.) via the Live CD by downloading grub2 - sudo apt-get install grub2 in terminal - \nThen to put it back on to your main Ubuntu partition, mount your main Ubuntu partition and use \"grub-install\" to put grub there in your /root/boot folder. Once this is done, use \"upgrade-grub\" to make grub (or grub2) include an option for EVERY O/S residing on your PC - then you will be able to boot up without the LiveCD, the menu will have all your options back. Sounds hard but there's plenty of info online about how to go about this. \nSo Windows has it's own boot loader (the MBR on the windows partition) AND you will have ONE (up-to-date) grub2 - this will be containing details of every O/S on your 1TB, placed in your main Ubuntu partition at the /root/boot/grub folder. Sometimes it's confusing if you have lots of partitions / operating systems, but it goes like this...\nwin7 -- boots using it's own MBR (Master Boot Record)\nUbuntu -- boots using Grub2 -- \nSo your main (first) boot will call up the Ubuntu partition's grub(2)\nThis grub2 will contain the boot information for your win7 MBR and any other O/S's - giving you EVERY option for booting off your hard-drive.\nSorry to ramble but that would help your computing life big-time, just getting used to playing around with these concepts until they work for you...\n", "Q: I need help resolving dual display issues with 13.04 running the ATI Radeon Open Source driver I did a fresh install of 13.04 on my Dell Precision M6500. I was previously running 12.04 LTS. My laptop has an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5870 adapter and I'm using the open source driver.\nPlugging in an external display on boot enables mirroring which is nice by default. Since I want to run this off to extend my display, I use the display adapter utility to uncheck mirror and apply. about 50% of the time, I get a crash of Unity and/or Compiz. \nI lose the launcher and the title bars on my window and the ability to change windows. Pretty scary stuff since 12.04 LTD didn't have this problem. To recover my apps, I do a Ctrl-Alt-F1 to get to a terminal, log in, cross my fingers, and run:\nunity --replace\nor\nDISPLAY=:0 unity --replace\n\nI then do a Ctrl-Alt-F7 and pray that my apps respond again so that I can close them and restart. If I don't get my apps to respond, I'll try this from a console terminal:\nDISPLAY=:0 compiz --replace\n\nThis will sometimes get my apps back, albeit without Unity. At least I can close them gently. If I can't get my apps back, I have to close the apps I can and restart via Ctrl-Alt-Del and home that my hidden applications panic.\nI will also get Unity / Compiz crashes when using Shutter and sometimes when accessing the Stormcloud weather application.\nI tried the proprietary ATI drivers, and they were worse, with Mirroring on by default and attempting to unmirror via the ATI utility or the Ubuntu display manager not working either.

You can update me if your computer is still having problems, but often these issues are certainly to do with the connection between the router and the target website.\nTo eliminate the browser, use wget on the command line to download the github or deviantart website. If that fails... then you need to run some diagnostics to find where the error is happening with http requests.\n\nA: You should re-install your browser first. Then if the problem persists it maybe an issue with your firewall configuration.\n\n\n*\n\n*In case firewall occurs the problem then disable your firewall or if you can configure then configure it with choice. It will solve your problem.\n\n*If you have any proxy software installed then uninstall it immediately.\n\n*If you have a router which is broadcasting your internet then check your router's firewall settings. There maybe some options to: Filter ActiveX, Filter Java Aplets, Filter Proxy etc. Disable these things. Or command the firewall not to filter these things. Then you will be able to access the web pages you want.\n\n*You can also check your router if these websites are blocked or not from your router. If blocked then unblock these websites to access them.\n\n*It might be a temporary issue with your ISP. In many rear cases ISP does some website blocking. Hope the problem isn't related with your ISP. If so then contact your ISP to unblock these websites.\nHope this will help.

It's  conventional to name action files in a \"vendor hierarchical\" way, such as com.ubuntu.pkexec.gparted.policy or org.debian.apt.policy\nThen paste the following content:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE policyconfig PUBLIC\n \"-//freedesktop//DTD PolicyKit Policy Configuration 1.0//EN\"\n \"http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/PolicyKit/1/policyconfig.dtd\">\n\n<policyconfig>\n\n  <action id=\"org.freedesktop.policykit.pkexec.run-[Short Program Name]\">\n    <description>Run [Full Program Name]</description>\n    <message>Authentication is required to run [Full Program Name]</message>\n    <defaults>\n      <allow_any>no</allow_any>\n      <allow_inactive>no</allow_inactive>\n      <allow_active>auth_admin_keep</allow_active>\n    </defaults>\n    <annotate key=\"org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.path\">[Full Program Path]</annotate>\n    <annotate key=\"org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.allow_gui\">TRUE</annotate>\n  </action>\n\n</policyconfig>\n\nReplace [Short/Full Program Name/Path] with appropriate values, for example gedit, gedit Text Editor and /usr/bin/gedit.  <action id> value does not need to match the chosen filename (and a single file can contain multiple actions), but conventionally filename is the prefix for all its actions.\nAfter saving the file the specific program would run with X and GUI and such.\nAnother fix seems to be:\nAdd the following line in /etc/pam.d/polkit-1:\n\nsession optional pam_xauth.so\n\n\nA: Yet another fix for user scripts: Determine the appropriate environment variables inside your script.\nYou could use a snippet like the following one to do this:\ngetXuser() {\n        user=`pinky -fw | awk '{ if ($2 == \":'$displaynum'\" || $(NF) == \":'$displaynum'\" ) { print $1; exit; } }'`\n        if [ x\"$user\" = x\"\" ]; then\n                startx=`pgrep -n startx`\n                if [ x\"$startx\" != x\"\" ]; then\n                        user=`ps -o user --no-headers $startx`\n                fi\n        fi\n        if [ x\"$user\" = x\"\" ]; then\n               user=$(pinky -fw | awk '{ print $1; exit; }')\n        fi\n        if [ x\"$user\" != x\"\" ]; then\n                userhome=`getent passwd $user | cut -d: -f6`\n                export XAUTHORITY=$userhome/.Xauthority\n        else\n                export XAUTHORITY=\"\"\n        fi\n        export XUSER=$user\n}\n\n\nfor x in /tmp/.X11-unix/*; do\n   displaynum=`echo $x | sed s#/tmp/.X11-unix/X##`\n   getXuser;\n      if [ x\"$XAUTHORITY\" != x\"\" ]; then\n        export DISPLAY=\":$displaynum\"\n      fi\ndone\n\n(based on the ACPI getXuser function)\nIf you find your .desktop file still not working you could try wrapping your pkexec commandline in a sh snippet, e.g.:\nExec=sh -c \"pkexec --user root script_that_needs_root.sh\"\n\nThe last problem is a known bug, apparently:\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=690339\nhttps://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9373\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=650038\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=686059\n"]
