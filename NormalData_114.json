But since the panel is shrunken, there is no longer a place where I can click (with Super+Alt+rightclick), I'm always in one or another application which lies in the panel.\nSo, is there another way than clicking on an empty space in the panel to open the settings?\n\nA: One possible alternative is to enable (tick) the expand property for the panel: \n\nTo do this, install dconf-tools either from Software Center or via\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nThen run dconf-editor and navigate to org.gnome.gnome-panel.layout.toplevels\n", "Q: Installation stops about 3/4 of the way through, nothing happens after I click \"Skip\" Okay, at the beginning of the installation, it went well. My laptop is connected to power source, the internet, I have also checked the boxes \"install updates while installation\", \"install third party plugin\". After inputting location, keyboard layout info and user's details and password, the installation took place.\nBut after 3/4 of the installation, it stopped, right above the progress bar, it displayed \"installing system\", I clicked on the arrow below it, the terminal-like screen also stopped carrying out the process. I then clicked on the \"Skip\" button, nothing happens. \nI thought it was the problem of my laptop, then I did another fresh installation, same thing happened. The terminal-like screen was showing some different words. But it's not an error message, just some installation info.\nDoes anyone have valuable solution to this problem?\n\nA: The time that \"skip\" option occurs is usually when  the following happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloading updates\n\n*Downloading language packages\n\n*Downloading third-party plugins\n\n\nThe time to complete this tasks depends on your network speed. Usually the packages may be a total of several MB (>=100) so you have to be patient.\nIf you want a straight foreword simple installation Do Not enable \"*install updates while installatio*n\" and  \"install third party plugin\". You can install them after you have finished the installation\n\nA: Try again and just let it run until the install completes or you see an actual error message. I've noticed that the servers are much slower than usual right now, undoubtedly due to all the new 12.04 users. And, as Salih mentioned, the language packages are quite large and are retrieved near the end of the install process.\nBe prepared for the updates you will likely need to pull down when you first launch your new system to arrive slowly, as well. \n", "Q: Windows moving after losing focus when I enable the 'Place Windows' in the compizconfig settings editor in 12.04 (gnome-classic), windows which are placed over the border of the windows are moved back to the window as soon as the window loses focus. I often like to have windows being only half-way visible.\nOn the other hand, disabling the 'Place Windows' option will put newly created windows in position 0x0, which unfortunately is behind the panel.\nHow can I have smart placing of new windows, but not over existing windows?\n\nA: 'Place Windows' seems to be pretty buggy--when I had it on, it would make my windows jump to a screen-edge whenever they lost focus (or, with terminal windows, sometimes when I just hit return to the command line, which seems completely bizarre to me).\nBut with 'Place Windows' off, the start-at-0,0 issue is made worse when you have dual-monitors, with the one on the left below the one on the right; in that case, the 0,0 point is not actually on any monitor, so depending on the window size it might not appear at all.\nIf the window is visible, you can do a ALT-leftmousebutton on the window and drag it to where you want it.  If you have dual monitors, you probably want to ensure that the left one is positioned at least as high as the right one.\nThat was my solution--turn off 'Place Windows', redefine my left monitor position to be as high as my right, and just manually place all my windows.  I don't need to use the ALT-left thing because my panels are on my right monitor so I just grab the title bar.\n", "Q: LTS to LTS Upgrade Another question with this URL:\nHow do I upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu?\nHas this:\n\nIf you choose to upgrade before then, you can pass the -d option to\n  the upgrade tool, running do-release-upgrade -d or update-manager -d,\n  to upgrade from vanilla 10.04 to 12.04.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that if I am actually running 10.04.4 (not vanilla?) that the above command line instructions would NOT work? I really do not mind waiting for the GUI Update Manager to show me the availability at 12.04.1 in July. I am just curious.\n\nA: LTS usually has multiple point releases and 10.04.4 is just one of the point releases. In other words, 10.04.4 is indeed Vanilla 10.04.\nSo, your assumption that the commands won't work is wrong. They will work if you enter them correctly. \nYou can read about why the LTS to LTS upgrade is delayed until 12.04.1 in this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrading LTS to LTS (server) -- why wait for the first point release?\n\nA: based on my experience: Before starting a release upgrade you are asked to upgrade all your existing packages to their latest versions using the update manager. So if you were to do that step on 10.04, it would become 10.04.4 and also include the even newer updates.\nSo if you try to upgrade now, the upgrade should go through.\nI suppose that the point behind waiting for the first point release is to ensure that teething issues get solved.\nreference: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PreciseUpgrades\n", "Q: Can I modify unity keyboard shortcut overlay?

I am trying to install Windows 7 side by side with Ubuntu. The computer is already running Ubuntu and I have partitioned the hard drive formatted it for NTFS and have a USB copy of the .iso of Windows 7. The usb is also formatted for NTFS and contains the .iso of Windows. People are telling me that I need to boot my computer from the USB via Grub.But I have no idea how to use Grub. So I need to know what commands to enter into Grub once I have it to boot the computer from the USB? How to install Windows 7 once I have booted off the USB into the blank partition? My computer is also fairly old so a lot of the recent keyboard commands don't work.\nThere has to be an easier way to do this. What is that?\nWhat commands to enter into Grub to boot my computer off a USB?\nHow to install Windows 7 via USB to a separate partition of my hard drive?\n\nA: You don't need grub to enter windows 7 installation ,assuming your computer support USB boot. Open BIOS and change the boot order so that the USB comes first before your hard disk.\nOpening of BIOS is done generally pressing F2 or Del at startup.Look at screen corners while startup.For more info how to change boot order. consult your manual/help of motherboard (in case its a PC) OR user guide (for notebooks)). Once done, save and exit. The windows 7 installation will start.\nOnce windows 7 installation is done, it will overwrite the MBR, so grub (and ubuntu) won't be accessible. You need to boot again with live cd/ usb of ubuntu and use a tool called boot-repair to restore ubuntu with option to boot in Win 7. Using this tool is fairly simple, look at here \n\nA: First theres a tool in Ubuntu called start up disk, this one will install the boot aswell, next you have 2 options that depends on each motherboard:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Menu, generaly F12, it will ask where you want to boot from and you only have to click USB and your good to go\n\n*go into bios and search for boot order, there you should put have something like 1-Hard Drive, 2-CD-Rom 3-USB, put 1-USB 2 Hard Drive. if you leave it this way after installation remenber to remove the USB or he will boot into USB again.\n\n\na good thing you should check is if the legacy USB is on in case he doesnt pick up\n", "Q: Shared folder access from ubuntu is too slow I've a NAS.

In my work I need ssh sometimes. I bought a G4 card, but it has transfer limit so I would like to use G4 only for ssh, and in browser use proxy only. How to configure it properly on ubuntu?\n\nA: You should aim for a customized routing table. The way you describe your problem, you want the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*A route to the proxy which uses the WiFi interface\n\n*A route to your ssh server which uses the G4 card\n\n*A default route on either device, or none at all, as you are not expecting any\nconnections to hosts other than these two, right?\n\n\nI must confess I'm not much of a GUI user in things like these. I know you could set up the routing table like this using the rourte command line tool. You'd basically add a route to the specific target through the default gateway of the device in question. You could even write a script to automate the process, once you've worked out the commands to use.\nI guess there are ways to achieve similar effects using the Ubuntu graphical user interface tools. Someone else might know that detail. Answers to questions bearing the routing tag might also provide useful information on that, although I haven't found a GUI tutorial on custom routes at my first glance.\n", "Q: Can my aborted 10.04 to 12.04 upgrade be rescued?

Thanks for the assistance.\n\nA: Sorry to hear about that, I'm no expert, but I can maybe give some advice.\nIf you go to the terminal and type:\ngedit /etc/apt/sources.list\nand look at the entries. This file tells Ubuntu what version to use for system packages (files). If almost all of them of them contain the name \"precise\", then you still have the updated repositories.

But it doesn't work for me: I had to resort to TwinView mode in order to take advantage of seamless multi-monitor experience but TwinView mode doesn't work with my situation where one of the monitor is in portrait mode!\nEven worse, when I go back to my original configuration, i.e. separate X screens instead of TwinView, my portrait monitor shows only white screen with default X cursor without any of unity goodness.\nAnyone familiar with situation similar to mine?\n\nA: EDIT the post above:\nI managed to solve the problem, but not for 3D because compiz crashes. \nhere is the new xorg.conf: \n    # nvidia-settings: X configuration file generated by nvidia-settings\n    # nvidia-settings:  version 295.33  (buildd@zirconium)  Fri Mar 30 13:43:34 UTC 2012\n\n    Section \"ServerLayout\"\n        Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n        Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 0 0\n        Screen      1  \"Screen1\" RightOf \"Screen0\"\n        InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n        InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n        Option         \"Xinerama\" \"1\"\n    EndSection\n\n    Section \"Files\"\n    EndSection\n  Section \"InputDevice\"\n        # generated from default\n        Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n        Driver         \"mouse\"\n        Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n        Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n        Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n        Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\n    EndSection\n\n    Section \"InputDevice\"\n        # generated from default\n        Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n        Driver         \"kbd\"\n    EndSection\n\n    Section \"Monitor\"\n        # HorizSync source: edid, VertRefresh source: edid\n        Identifier     \"Monitor1\"\n        VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n        ModelName      \"DELL P2311H\"\n        HorizSync       30.0 - 83.0\n        VertRefresh     56.0 - 76.0\n        Option         \"DPMS\"\n    EndSection\n\n    Section \"Monitor\"\n        # HorizSync source: edid, VertRefresh source: edid\n        Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n        VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n        ModelName      \"DELL P2311H\"\n        HorizSync       30.0 - 83.0\n        VertRefresh     56.0 - 76.0\n        Option         \"DPMS\"\n    EndSection\n\n    Section \"Device\"\n        Identifier     \"Device1\"\n        Driver         \"nvidia\"\n        VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n        BoardName      \"GeForce 8500 GT\"\n        BusID          \"PCI:1:0:0\"\n        Screen          1\n    EndSection\n\n    Section \"Device\"\n        Identifier     \"Device0\"\n        Driver         \"nvidia\"\n        VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n        BoardName      \"GeForce 8500 GT\"\n        BusID          \"PCI:1:0:0\"\n        Screen          0\n    EndSection\n\n    Section \"Screen\"\n        Identifier     \"Screen1\"\n        Device         \"Device1\"\n        Monitor        \"Monitor1\"\n        DefaultDepth    24\n        Option         \"TwinView\" \"0\"\n        Option         \"metamodes\" \"DFP: nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n        Option     \"Rotate\" \"left\"\n        SubSection     \"Display\"\n            Depth       24\n        EndSubSection\n    EndSection\n\n    Section \"Screen\"\n        Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n        Device         \"Device0\"\n        Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n        DefaultDepth    24\n        Option         \"TwinView\" \"0\"\n        Option         \"TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder\" \"CRT-1\"\n        Option         \"metamodes\" \"CRT: nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n        Option     \"Rotate\" \"left\"\n        SubSection     \"Display\"\n            Depth       24\n        EndSubSection\n    EndSection\n\n    Section \"Extensions\"\n        Option         \"Composite\" \"Disable\"\n    EndSection\n\nI generated it using nvidia settings, not with twin view but with seperated X screens, screen 1 is absolute and screen 2 is Right Of.

Now it works flawlessly. Can configure either monitor in whatever configuration I want in Display settings.\n\nA: I have a similar problem: \nI have been using until today ubuntu 10.4, I did not bother upgrading it since it worked and I need a working station in my office. It work under strange configuration: I used xinerama in the xorg.conf file (find it in /etc/X11/) and rotated the screens with the options given by the nvidia driver \n\nOption         \"Rotate\" \"left\"\n\nIt worked, I wrote it long time ago. Now, I wanted to try ubuntu 3D or Gnome 3D, but it dones not work, maybe because xinerama does not work with thi nvidia driver and the 12.04 release. It DOES work with ubuntu 12.04 if you choose 'gnome classic', but not otherwise. \nI tried to tweek with nvidia-settings program, but did not find any option to rotate the screens there. \nhere is the xorg.conf:\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Main\"\n    Device         \"nvidia A\"\n    Monitor        \"Dell-VGA\"\n    Option         \"RenderAccel\" \"true\"\n    Option         \"AllowGLXWithComposite\" \"true\"\n    Option         \"AddARGBGLXVisuals\" \"true\"\n    Option         \"Rotate\" \"left\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n        Modes      \"2160x1900@60\" \"2100x1600@60\" \"1536x1280@60\" \"1200x800@60\" \"1800x1440@60\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Second\"\n    Device         \"nvidia B\"\n    Monitor        \"Dell-DVI\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"RenderAccel\" \"true\"\n    Option         \"AllowGLXWithComposite\" \"true\"\n    Option         \"AddARGBGLXVisuals\" \"true\"\n    Option         \"Rotate\" \"left\"\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n        Modes      \"2160x1900@60\" \"2100x1600@60\" \"1536x1280@60\" \"1200x800@60\" \"1800x1440@60\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Module\"\n    Load           \"dbe\"\n    Load           \"extmod\"\n    Load           \"type1\"\n    Load           \"freetype\"\n    Load           \"glx\"\nEndSection\n\n# commented out by update-manager, HAL is now used\n#Section \"InputDevice\"\n#   Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n#   Driver         \"keyboard\"\n#EndSection\n\n# commented out by update-manager, HAL is now used\n#Section \"InputDevice\"\n#   Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n#   Driver         \"mouse\"\n#   Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n#   Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n#   Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n#   Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\n#EndSection\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Default Layout\"\n    Screen      0  \"Main\" 0 0\n    Screen      1  \"Second\" RightOf \"Main\"\n# commented out by update-manager, HAL is now used\n#   InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n# commented out by update-manager, HAL is now used\n#   InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"true\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"nvidia A\"\n    BoardName      \"nv\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:01:00:0\"\n    Screen          0\n    Driver  \"nvidia\"\n    Option  \"NoLogo\"    \"True\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"nvidia B\"\n    BoardName      \"nv\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:01:00:0\"\n    Screen          1\n    Driver  \"nvidia\"\n    Option  \"NoLogo\"    \"True\"\nEndSection\n\nAgain, I get dual screens, rotated properly with this conf file, but only on gnome classic login, not unity or 3D. \n\nA: LAST EDIT:::\nI finally got it... an ugly hack, but working perfectly!!!\nForgen xinerama! choose Twin View. Choose the left screen to be primary (absolute). the other one ABOVE the primary. then save the xorg file. edit it \nsudo nano \\etc\\X11\\xorg.conf\n\nand add the rotation option to the screen Section. (Rotate left in my case).\nThen I got a perfect dual screen with two monitors, rotated, beside each other..... :-)\n Works only in unity, but not 3D. compiz is broken for now. \nN\n\nA: I vote to post about Nouveau open source driver. I had the problem with 2 monitors in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with NVidia proprietary driver. The answer really helped. I installed synaptic, launched synaptic, found all that concerned nouveau and added those packages. After that two monitors started to work properly.

They have the default theme.\nFor KDE applications the icon theme can be changed with the systemsettings package. This, however, does not work for some non-KDE QT applications.\nIs there a setting I can change to make all QT applications follow suit?\n\nA: Gconf and Dconf settings\nA lot of QT applications will query GNOME's configuration databases for the icon theme settings. Under some circumstances there might be a discrepancy between the icon theme in use and the corresponding GNOME setting. \nSo to change the icons you might have to set the corresponding Gconf and Dconf keys first. You can do so with the following commands (replace Faenza-Dark with your icon theme of choice):\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme Faenza-Dark\n\nand\ngconftool-2 --type=string --set \"/desktop/gnome/interface/icon_theme\" \"Faenza-Dark\"\n\nIt might take a relog to see the changes.\nThe theme names correspond with their basename in the filesystem. It doesn't matter where the theme is located. Be it /usr/share/icons/AskUbuntu, ~/.icons/AskUbuntu or ~/.local/share/icons/AskUbuntu, in each case the Gconf/Dconf name will be AskUbuntu.\nNote\nThis fix will not work for all QT applications out there. Some, e.g. Clementine, have turned out to be very resilient and - as much as you might try - just won't change their icon theme. That's likely due to issues with how these applications detect the system theme. In other cases (e.g. Skype) the icons might be hard-coded into the binary and impossible to change.\nReferences\nhttps://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/1793\nhttp://forums.fedoraforum.org/showpost.php?p=1453006&postcount=19\nhttp://slackbuilds.org/repository/11.0/desktop/tango-icon-theme/\nHow to change desktop theme periodically\n", "Q: How to make Tamil fonts work in a chat client?

You can have it set up at at that resolution (i have mine at 1920 x 1080 - and it's great.\nTo do that you need to install the proprietary drivers from Nvidia. Simply open the terminal and enter the following commands, one line at a time:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nThe reason being that the latest drivers has not yet made it to Ubuntu's repositories.\nNote 1: I think the resolution you were going for is 1360x768.\nNote 2: Make sure your tv is setup to unscaled (Menu > TV Settings > Picture > Unscaled).\n", "Q: Key short cut `Super+L` (i.e. `Win+L`) not working for `LockScreen` in 12.04 LTS I want to change Key short cut  to  Super+L for LockScreen but it is not working.

So hopefully this will help you, and also be an easy way for me to look this up next time I do a fresh Ubuntu install.\nThere is duplication & conflict between the Gnome Keyboard Shortcut settings (as depicted in your screen shot) and the same settings in the new Unity desktop. Ubuntu (well, Gnome) provides a UI for editing the Gnome Keyboard Shortcut settings but as you've learned, they don't work if they conflict with Unity. And there is no UI installed by default for managing Unity.\nNote that to get 'Super-X' style shortcuts to work, you will have to change the 'key to show the launcher' setting, which means that the Super/Windows key will no longer open the launcher. If that's OK with you, continue...\nHere is what I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install compizconfig-settings-manager (some will warn you not to, because it gives you enough power to really mess things up). There may be a way to change these without using CCSM but if so, I don't know it. Install it via the Ubuntu Software Center, or:\n$ sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n*Run CompizConfig Settings Manager; acknowledge the warning message.\n\n*Locate and click the Ubuntu Unity Plugin icon in the Desktop section\n\n*Change the Key to show the launcher (on the Behaviour tab).\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the button which says <Super>\n\n*Click Grab key combination\n\n*Press a new key or key combination (this will, from now on, open the Unity launcher); I use <Alt>-<Super>\n\nThe <Super>-L 'Lock Screen' combination that you already set up should now just work!\nBonus\nNote that CCSM also provides its own facility for setting keyboard shortcuts. For things not included in the gnome-control-center, you may have more luck defining custom shortcuts in CCSM. If you select Commands from the General section in CCSM, you can define custom commands, like I've done here:\n\n...and then, you can associate those commands with specific key combinations, like this:\n\nAs you can see, I've configured Super-E to launch the Gnome text editor, and Super-C to launch the calculator.

You can also do this from a live CD. \nOr you need to reboot and do issue a sudo bash with the 1st command (it looks like this bug only shows up after the 2nd time you use sudo).\nsudo gedit /etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive\n\nlook for line 16(ish) and change \n[default=1] \n\nto \n[default=0]\n\nTry a command with sudo and it should work as normal.\nSource from launchpad\n\nA: This misbehavior is caused by a bug in \"sudo\" package. The above mentioned fix is unfortunately just a workaround that causes pam_denied to run so all authorizations fail and Cron jobs are no longer executed. \nSyslog for instance states:\n'CRON[process id]: Permission denied'.\n\nA patched \"sudo\" package is available on the following PPA: https://launchpad.net/~intuitivenipple/+archive/ppa?field.series_filter=precise\nHowever please note that despite TJ's reputation \"sudo\" is quite a sensitive package on our Ubuntu system and I advise against installing versions provided by non official Ubuntu or Debian parties. \nIn any case this bug is referenced by launchpad bug #927828 and triaged as \"High importance\".

I feel stupid asking, but I can't seem to find the answer to this anywhere.

Is there a better, more recent set of instructions for modifying the bash prompt? \n\nA: It is hidden because of the '.' it starts with.\nlist it with\nls -al\nor enable \"show hidden files\" under the view menu in nautilus (Ctrl-H will also do the trick).\nYou can edit it with your favorite text editor from your home directory e.g.\ncd \nto go to your home directory then:\nemacs .bashrc\n\nA: User specific, hidden by default.\n~/.bashrc\n\nIf not there simply create one.\nSystem wide:\n/etc/bash.bashrc\n\n\nA: If .bashrc is not in your home folder, even after you list the hidden files, you can copy it from: \n/etc/skel/.bashrc\n\n\nA: Use nano ~/.bashrc to open and edit the .bashrc file. (This will create the file if it does not yet exist)\n\nA: if not in home directory, you can just copy from /etc/bash.bashrc, and make it source for your terminal, by typing in your terminal source .bashrc from your home directory after copying. \n\nA: Don't forget it is a hidden file inside your home directory (you would not be the first to do a ls -l and thinking it is not there).\nDo a:\nls -la ~/ | more\n\nThere should be a .bashrc on the first page.\nIf not just create it with: \nvi ~/.bashrc\n\nand add in the lines you need to add into it.\nPermissions of my .bashrc are:\n-rw-r--r--  1 discworld discworld  3330 Mar 10 16:03 .bashrc\n\n(chmod 644 .bashrc to make it rw r r).      \n\nA: There is a .bashrc in every user's home folder (99.99% of the time) as well as one system-wide (which I don't know the location of in Ubuntu).\nThe quickest way to access it is nano ~/.bashrc from a terminal (replace nano with whatever you like to use).\nIf this is not present in a user's home folder the system-wide .bashrc is used as a fallback as it is loaded before the user's file. You could simply copy and paste it (with root permissions of course), but a .bashrc is not entirely essential (it may be required to make things work. I haven't found out) at a user level as it mostly overrides the system-wide one with user-specific tweaks. You could write your own though.\nThe main components for that users may tweak are PS1 (the Bash prompt defaults to display user@localhost:pwd $) and aliases as well as setting a color prompt and maybe PS2 (busy state message).\n\nA: Use gedit ~/.bashrc, it will allow you to modify ~/.bashrc using gedit.\n\nA: If you use encryption and work from the command line you might not see it as one need to mount the real home-dir first (in contrast to in the graphical UI where this is done automaticallu) by the command:\necryptfs-mount-private\n\n(I had the same question and stumbled upon this question; but found my answer in the readme instead) \n\nA: Bashrc file  is a hidden file inside the home directory. It is actually, give the path directions.\nAnd those are wanted to edit .bashrc file, try this command gedit ~/.bashrc instead of this ~/.bashrc .\nThis command gedit ~/.bashrc directly take you to the text editor, where you can edit it easily, as you know.\n\nA: Just one note: after you made your alias in bashrc, you need in your terminal to write following command in order that your aliases work:\nsource .bashrc\n\nPersonally, whenever I install Linux anew, I add some aliases finding an appropriate place in .bashrc\nE.g.\n#My aliases\nalias shut='shutdown now'\nalias x='exit'\nalias update='sudo apt-get update'\n\nEtc.

However i did find a workaround. If you haven't already, install the synaptic package manager from the software center. From synaptic you can search for the driver you are trying to install and install through there.\nThe only downside is you have to know the name of the driver you are looking for, but some googling should be able to answer that for you.\n", "Q: Gparted can't create partition table Here's what the problem is.\nAbout a day or so ago I used Gparted live cd to create 3 NTFS primary partitions on my external 500 gig Goflex and one extended with 2 logical partitiones. \nI had planned to install windows 8 on the first partition, then ubuntu and kubuntu on the other 2.\nAfter I finished partitioning my drive with gparted, I booted into windows vista to make my bootable windows 8 usb to install it with, I also decided to check to make sure all my partitions were working properly.\nThen I found they were, and they weren't.\nMy 50 gig first partition I had planned to install windows on showed up normal and the 300 gigs of space left in the extended partition did as well, the rest showed up as raw.\nSo I figured alright, something went awal while making the partitions, so I booted up gparted once again.\nThen to my surprise gparted showed the entire drive as unallocated, and when I refreshed the list, it showed as all the partitions I had made earlier, buy with a exclamation mark by them all.\nSo I figured ok, might be a problem with the partition table as I'd seen a similar problem in past on a drive that was not partitioned at all, so I decided to create a new partition table and take the time out again to sit and wait.\nThen I got a message saying gparted could not create the partition table, followed by it showing the entire drive as formatted into ntfs.\nAfter that I figured ok I'll take a break, come back in a hour, maybe it's something I did.\nSo a hour later I came back after having booted up windows, plugged the drive in to see if by some miracle windows could access the drive.\nIn disk management when I plugged the drive in, it would freeze attempting to read the drive, as I'd seen in the past with raw disks, yet when I unplugged it I got a glimpse of disk management showing it as a perfectly fine ntfs file system on the drive followed by a \"you must format disk K in order to use it\".\nSo I then was assured the disk was raw as that is what had happened in the past, followed by a new partition table through gparted to fix the problem and a 10 hour format in windows.\nSo I once again booted up gparted, to get the message \"error fsyncing/closing/dev/sdg:input/output error\" followed by \"error opening dev/sdg No such file in directory\" after I refreshed and somehow saw the disk show up as perfectly fine ntfs and then tried to create a new partition table to try to wipe out all my problems and start over again.\nAnd not gparted only shows the drive there about 1/10 refreshes the rest I get the directory error.\nIf anybody can assist me in any way shape or form I will be thankful.\n\nA: Why do you create so many NTFS partitions in the first place? As for your info, Ubuntu/Kubuntu can't be installed on one of those, they require a Linux file system like ext4.\nI'd suggest the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete all partition.\n\n*Use Vista to create a primary NTFS partition for Windows8, and then proceed installing it.\n\n*Install Ubuntu and Kubuntu. You can create partitions for them inside the installer.\n\nA: My suggestion is to try:\nPlug your external hdd.\nOpen a terminal,Press Ctrl+Alt+T\nRun it:\nsudo -i\nfdisk -l\n\nSuppose your disk is /dev/sdg, continue running:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdg bs=1M\ngparted\n\nBy gparted create a GPT partition table.\nIf your PC is (U)EFI aware via the BIOS, create a first partition EFI bootloader (ef00 EFI System) 500 Mg\nIf your PC is not (U)EFI aware via the BIOS, create a first partition  BIOS boot partition, (ef02 BIOS boot) 500 Mg\nA continuation of this partition, leave 80 Gb free, to install Windows 8.\nThen create partitions for swap (8200 linux swap) and shared /home \n(8300 Linux filesystem) ext4, (using same username and password) to Ubuntu and Kubuntu.\nAnd then finally create partitions for each /,(8300 Linux filesystem) ext4, to  Ubuntu and Kubuntu.\nThe installation of these systems requires that you install  first Windows 8 on free space before the other systems.\n\nA: Maybe zeroing out the MBR could help? dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=1. I don't know how to do it for a GPT disk. After that, you could try the command line way: create the partition table in parted and then create the partitions with mkfs -t type /dev/sdXn.\n\nA: Windows 8 comes with a protected partition for security reasons. I believe it's called EUFI. You need to disable the protection in the BIOS (usually something like F2 or F11 at bootup.) This is the only thing you need to do in order to remove Windows 8 completely and install Ubuntu...\nHowever, if you wish to dual boot, you need to be ready to work - because it's hard work. Take a look at this tutorial at intructables.com which I used to dual boot my newly bought laptop. I later on downgraded to Windows 7 by the way.\nGood luck...\n\nA: I suggest that you install a [persistent] live system with mkusb according to these links\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb\nCompressed image file with a persistent live system with mkusb\nand\n\n\n*\n\n*first wipe the first megabyte on the problematic drive with mkusb.\n\n*then run gparted and create the partitions you want, or let the installer of the operating system do it, if you are not sure how to do it with gparted.\nIf you want to dual boot with Windows, install Windows first, and install Ubuntu afterwards. Otherwise Windows will 'hi-jack' the bootloader location at the drive head end and you have to re-install the grub bootloader.\n", "Q: Can I use GParted to repartition my drive in order that I can install Windows 7 on a portion of the drive and have a dual-boot system? I have used Ubuntu 11.10 successfully for several months.  Today, I am installing the 12.04 LTS upgrade.  It's been a while since I set up an old Lenovo Thinkpad T60 with Ubuntu.  Windows XP was formerly only the machine, but it crashed beyond repair.  Therefore, as I recollect, I formatted the disk to serve only as an Ubuntu machine.\nRecently, I have had the opportunity to test drive Windows 7 Professional, and I like it.  My question is \"Can I use GParted to repartition my drive in order that I can install Windows 7 on a portion of the drive and have a dual-boot system?\"  If GParted is not the preferred utility for accomplishing this task, what partition management software would you recommend?\nThanks very much for your suggestions.\n\nA: Gparted is fine, just remember not to shrink your partition to much or you will lose your data.\n\nA: GParted is a fine tool, but as always, remember to keep a backup of important data. One other thing: you can't change (shrink/expand/format) a partition already in use. So it is best if you do it from an Ubuntu Live CD. It already has GParted on it.\nAnd if you are up for separating your Home folder and other files, which is generally considered good practice, you might want to read the Ubuntu Partitioning Scheme from the Ubuntu docs.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: After upgrading to 12.04, installing Rhythmbox and uninstalling Banshee music lens doesn't open any audio I can search in music, but when i click at any icon in music lens or in music scope for home lens, it does nothing and don't disappears.

So be sure to give the black screen enough time to start.\n\n*Upgrading with sudo aptitude upgrade (or the same with apt-get) helped to get rid of some other error messages.\n\n\nA: In normal situation,option of splash screen enabling is placed within boot parameters of your operating system..it means you can interrupt boot process and manually enter params or change your boot params in boot configuration file.\nif you are using grub/burg run this command to edit:\nsudo gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nor\nsudo gedit /boot/grub/burg.cfg\n\nand add splash to rest of line begins with linux /boot/vmlinuz ..blah blah\nand finally it looks like: \nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-23-lowlatency root=UUID=d0433a6a-d031-4a59-bbb4-d77557235afa ro quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor $vt_handoff\n\nas you see theres splash within that line.\nsome other reason is your graphic mode cant be enable during boot process\nand its not much important at all\n\nA: I got an splashscreen  after a Ubuntu server 12.04 installation, and it seems nothing happens, but I think the newest kernels have moved the video mode setting into the kernel.\nHow I fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*after system-reboot press F6 to get the grub-boot-screen.\n\n*edit the first entry in the grub-list to start the system.\n\n*edit the /etc/default/grub file\n3.1. in my case i have to set the GRUB_GFXMODE\n3.2. others change these values to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\n\n*run 'sudo update-grub' and reboot\n\n\nIf these won't help, you can find help in the Ubuntu wikis\n", "Q: Graphical slow response issues? I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 but my Ubuntu is not running smoothly. It is becoming stuck. Is there a problem with my graphic driver? I say this because 1 out of the 2 ATI graphic drivers failed installing.\nATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics driver (post-release updates) - FAILED\nATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics driver - FAILED\n\nA: It could be your graphics or it could be unity itself. Log out and click the small ubuntu icon at the login screen, once there select unity 2D and login as normal. I find unity 3D slows my system down a lot so stick with 2D\nIf the problem persists then try to reinstall the graphics drivers. I have an NVIDIA chip so am not 100% with ATI drivers.\n\nA: The reason might be that Catalyst has not been updated to work with recent 3.2 kernels.\nTo solve this problem, see and follow instructions on this forum post.\nThe instructions provided in the link above help to fix installations.

In 11.10, the Unity alt-tab switcher brought all the windows belonging to an application to the front when switching to the application like on Mac (unless you waited for long enough that the app's switcher entry expanded to a window selection in which case you got to select which window to switch to).\nIn 12.04, switching to an app with multiple window open (in the same workspace) brings to the from one of the windows. (I see no logic in which one is brought to the front.)\nHow do I, under 12.04, revert to the alt-tab behavior of 11.10 so that switching to an app brings to the front all the windows of that app?\n\nA: Unfortunately this is not configurable, but you can easily get this back manually compiling the unity source (please, file a bug to ask to add an option, btw).\nAs I was saying, you can get this back editing the file BamfLauncherIcon.cpp changing the line: bool only_top_win = !any_urgent; to bool only_top_win = true;\nI know this is not the best solution, but since this has been a late change we had not the time to introduce a new ccsm option.\n\nA: I don't know if this configurable, but it is by design: https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/959339.\nThe window that is brought to the front is the most recently focused one.\n\nA: As Yann indicated, this was changed by design. I HIGHLY recommend that you voice your support for making the behavior configurable here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1055478\n", "Q: Unable to switch users in Ubuntu 12.04 Whenever I try to switch users in Ubuntu 12.04 it goes to a black screen with a cursor and hangs.

Is this a bug in Ubuntu or does something need reconfigured?\n\nA: How was the user's creation performed?\nIf the home folder of new user was not created, you can create like this:\nsudo adduser <username>\n\nCaution: This is not the same as the useradd command.

Even the user authentication works fine.\n\nA: (forget it, I saw later in your bug report that it also fails with x86 architecture)\nAssuming that your Ubuntu 10.04 install was 32 bits flavor, your driver probably need some 32 bits library dependancy. The various Brother printers (HL-4070, HL-3040 and HL-4150) I used with Ubuntu had such a problem, CUPS would instantly report printed successfuly but the printer would'nt do anything.\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\n", "Q: 12.04 upgrade from 11.10 stuck at restoring previously installed packages I am trying to upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04.\nThe machine is acer aspire core i3, 2.1ghz, ram 6gb, hard disk 500 gigabyte.\nI am using a usb stick with a downloaded 12.04 live install.\nThe install progressed with an overwrite of 11.10 system files to 12.04 and then got stuck.\nThe install is stuck at 'restoring previously installed packages'\nHow can i recover from this situation ?\nplease help.\nragv\n\nA: Firstly, if you are upgrading, you should have used the update manager instead of a livecd to upgrade.\nIf your system is being overwritten, then your home folder may get overwritten unless it is in a separate drive. \nHow long has it been since it got stuck? Sometimes, during upgrade, things can appear to get stuck but in the background the upgrade may be running.\nCheck using top command in an open terminal which process is using the most cpu/ram. Generally the process which gets stuck eats the most CPU.\n\nA: I just ran into this problem on my desktop and solved it by switching network adapters. So perhaps try the ethernet port if you are using the wireless or vis-versa if using the eithernet port already. \nIt may also help to simply disable and enable the networking. Hope this helps! \n", "Q: How long is 11.10 supported?  Im kinda noob here, but question until when is the support for ubuntu 11.10, I just update my PC to 12.04 but, when I install the video driver, nothing show on the desktop even cannot open terminal, just the screen properties so i want to down grade, and i need to know when will be the last support for this 11.10\nDo that makes sense?\n\nA: Support\nNormal Ubuntu releases are supported for 18 months. So Ubuntu 11.10 will be supported until April 2013.\nPrevious Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support) releases are supported for 3 years on the desktop and 5 years on the server. Starting with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, LTS releases will be supported for 5 years on both the desktop and the server. \nSUPPORT RELEASES \n\nA: Support for 11.10 ends in april 2013.\nIf your video driver works well than there may be issues with you user profile. The quick-and-dirty solution is to remove ~/.config and ~/.gconf directories:\nmv ~/.config ~/.config.bak\nmv ~/.gconf ~/.gconf.bak\n\nTo repair you video driver you can try to reinstall it with Ctrl-Alt-F1 and sudo apt-get --reinstall nvidia-current. If it will not help you can try to remove that driver and fallback to default video driver: sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current.\n", "Q: Will Photoshop work on Ubuntu? I was using Windows XP, I like Ubuntu, but I'm wondering,because as  I'm a professional photographer & photo editor.\nI do my work with Photoshop, so will photoshop work in ubuntu?\n\nA: You can use Wine (available from the Software Center) to run Photoshop. According to the WineHQ AppDB's entry for Photoshop, Photoshop is working relatively well under wine. Don't expect perfection, though, and if you run into problems, consult the entry. Not the different Wine versions mentioned; you may have to use the Wine PPA.\nBefore you make a purchase, try Gimp, the relatively bitmap-based image manipulation software available from the Software Center. For something more akin to Illustrator that is vector-based, try Inkscape.\nYou can install Windows in a virtual machine, if your system is powerful enough - Photoshop is a very big program.\n\nA: The short answer is no, although there are so many people begging Adobe to bring the suite to Linux systems they refuse - no financial intensive for them. \nI do believe running it under Wine works although not well and not the latest version.\nThere are alternatives; I would recommend The Gimp, it's open source and comprehensive. \n\nA: Have a look at this question for Photoshop alternatives: Here\nIt is possible to run Windows in a Virtual Box to run Photoshop on; have a look here for information on that too.\nIn addition take a look here for more information on running Photoshop in Wine or a Virtual Box. \nPersonally I would suggest that you should find and learn how to use an alternative application as this will ensure less problems in the future. Try Gimp from the Ubuntu Software Centre.\n\nA: The GIMP is as close as you can get.\nAs to running Photoshop and its variants under Wine, please consult the Wine Applications Database and check for your version, as you have not specified which version and edition you have.  Wine alone would not work; you should install Wine, winetricks, Wine Windows Program Loaded, Q4Wine, and Play on Linux. For security purposes, also suggest you delete the Z: drive mapping in Wine's configuration.\n\nA: If you want to use photoshop but also want to use linux such as Ubuntu There are 2 ways of doing it.\n\n\n*\n\n*I advise you to make your PC dual boot. There are many tutorials available on How to dual boot. With this you can do both the work of windows and linux.\n\n*Install a virtual machine such as VMware in the ubuntu and then install the windows image on it and run windows application on it such as photoshop. But this will slow down your computer speed as two OS will simultaneously operate.\n\n", "Q: How do I enable Scroll Lock?

I just upgraded to 12.04. When I press the super key to open the dash, there's a lag of 1-3 seconds before it displays, with no other programs running. (This is similar, but not identical, to the issue described in Dash application search unresponsive at startup about 11.10.) At login time, this lag is up to 10 seconds, and sometimes the dash doesn't respond at all to the super key. \nIn contrast, the launcher Kupfer immediately responds to its hotkey, in milliseconds, and responds to my typing an application name also in fractions of a second. \nIs there a way to load the dash in memory or a RAM disk of some sort to make it more responsive? \n\nA: The always present problems with Dash performance are ridiculous. If they can't make it snappy, why they use effects at all?!\nAs for the original question - unfortunatelly you may experience this\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/990002\nor a simillar bug.\nNo bugs but still not snappy?\nAfter using Unity for months in a relatively bug-free environment on a dedicated graphics I can say this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Even on best software/hardware configurations Unity will feel slow. Smooth but slow. This is due to long animations, the most important of which can't be tweaked or disabled How to disable all Unity animations?\n\n*The simplest tweaks to improve Dash responsiveness is to disable blur and use Dash at its desktop size i.e. not maximized. Maximized Dash takes twice as long to open even on strong hardware. Disabling online search results may also help.\n\n\nA: Use Compiz config setting manager and go to:\nUbuntu Unity Plugin -> Experimental -> Dash Blur\nSetting it to No blur improved thing massively for me.\n\nA: Similar to iain's answer, you can also use Ubuntu Tweak to modify those settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Ubuntu Tweak (which can be launched either from the dash, or in the System Settings)\n\n*Open the tab Tweaks and click Unity\n\n*Set the Blur type to no blur\n\nA: You can also use MyUnity to change the settings for the Dash.\nOpen up MyUnity, click on the \"dash\" tab and select \"Off\" on the \"Blur\" settings drop down box.\nAdditionally also experimenting with settings under \"launcher\" might help.\n\nA: I had similar troubles.

I have a beloved high performance 10.04 LTS 64 bit workstation, where I do serious work.  I am considering doing a release upgrade to 12.04 LTS early. It seems that 10.04 LTS is not fully supported as I have to manually install a Nvidia driver, the nvidia-current not supporting my year old video adaptor.\nI make heavy use of multiple displays, Gnome panel applets and the Desktop Cube, Rotate Cube and 3D Windows in the way I work.  I find Unity obstructive to my style of working, are these features available after upgrading to 12.04 LTS?\n\nA: The features you list are all available, though not necessarily enabled by default. As for GNOME panel applets though, there are much fewer available for the 3.x version of gnome-panel, than existed on gnome-panel 2.x, so you may lose some, as the new version of GNOME broke API (which is why it was versioned 3.x and not 2.x), and all the applets have not been ported upstream.\n\nA: These features are not available.  \nThere is a known bug, [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/973559][1] which renders Gnome Classic (3d) unusable.\nApparently this is a known bug since 4/4/12.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/973559\nIf this is happening to you, go to the bug and mark it as affecting you.\n\nI fixed this problem (by stumbling around) for an upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04.    Upgrades from 10.04 LTS are not recommended until the release of 12.04.1 (July).\nSince I have other, older distributions working with Compiz, I opened ccsm from one of them and compared them to the 12.04 upgrade.\nStrangely, after enabling Windows decorations, move, and re·size the problems stated is this question were solved.\nBy setting others from the older ccsm, I got a rotating cube.\nAlas, there are no more 3D windows\nUPDATE: 3D windows are available for Gnome Classic. The Compiz PluginsExtra is required.  Synaptic is required to install Compiz PluginsExtra, it is not available in Ubuntu Software Center.

Most of the issues I've seen with regards to 3TB hard drives stem from outdated hardware, dual-booting issues, etc.\nMy server is brand-new, using an ASRock H67M-ITX with onboard Intel RAID.  I have two Seagate 3TB set up in a RAID 1 array. Everything I can see in the raid controller indicates that the motherboard is having no problems with this arrangement: both disks show up as 3TB devices, and the RAID array does as well.  The only point at which anything goes amiss is upon loading 12.04-desktop-amd64 from a flash drive, and attempting to partition.  At this stage, I create a new partition table on the disk, and the resulting size is 801567 MB.\nI was under the impression that the motherboard had no problems with RAID arrays this large, and also that the latest long-term stable release of 64-bit Ubuntu shipped with in-kernel GPT support and would have no difficulties as well.  Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: I have no simple and sure-fire answer, but for a first diagnostic step, I recommend you check your boot mode and disk information using lower-level tools than the installer provides:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the \"try before installing\" mode.\n\n*Open a terminal window.\n\n*Type ls /sys/firmware/efi. If you see any files (normally one file and one directory), you've booted in EFI mode. If you get a \"no such file or directory\" error, you've probably booted in BIOS mode. This may have implications for the partition table type used and perhaps for the way the motherboard's RAID features get detected by Linux. (This last is very speculative on my part, though.)\n\n*Type sudo apt-get install gdisk to install the gdisk package. (If this doesn't work, you may need to enable networking and futz around with package options.)\n\n*Type gdisk -l /dev/sda (change the device identifier, if necessary, to see your disk or RAID array). Pay attention to the disk's reported size (in sectors and GiB or TiB) and to the table type (\"MBR: protective and GPT: present\" for GPT; or \"MBR: MBR only and GPT: not present\" for MBR). If your disk is set up with MBR, that could be throwing things off. I'd expect it to let you use up to 2 TiB in this case, but there could be a bug in libparted that's cutting you off too early. If the disk uses MBR, switching to GPT with the help of gdisk, GParted, or some other tool is in order.\n\n\nOne more comment: If this is to be a Linux-only installation, the motherboard-based RAID is probably not the best way to go. Linux supports it, but my impression is that it's flakier than is Linux's own software-based RAID. (Both are actually software-based; it's just that the motherboard variety includes \"hooks\" in the firmware, can be used across OSes, and is tied to a particular type of disk controller, whereas the Linux variety has no hooks, is Linux-only, and can be used on any disk controller.) Thus, if this is a Linux-only system, I recommend you disable the RAID option in the firmware and then use Linux's software RAID. Not all Ubuntu installers support software RAID, though. The desktop installers definitely don't, but I think the server and alternate installers both do.\n", "Q: How to setup wired network connection in Ubuntu?

I've got a dual screen set up on my ubuntu machine and I'd quite like to set it up to do a random slideshow, with different images on each screen.  Is it possible to do this with one or more programs?\n\nA: I haven't found a single program that can do this but I have achieved the effect I wanted using a combination of two programs which I maximised in the two separate monitors.  The programs I used for this purpose were gwenview and geeqie.  To avoid the top unity bar being visible on one or both screens I did it in this order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the two monitors displays are aligned side by side such that the mouse point leaves monitor 1 on the right and enters monitor 2 on the left.\n\n*Put the Gwenview window in the display of monitor 1\n\n*Put the Geeqie window in the display of monitor 2\n\n*Maximise Gwenview and start its slideshow\n\n*Maximise Geeqie and if the unity top bar still shows, turn off its slideshow (other wise you're done).\n\n*Minimise and maximise Geeqie with the slideshow off.  If the unity top bar is now gone, right click in the Geeqie window and start the slide show from the context menu.  \n\n\nYou should now have two different slideshows happening, one in each monitor.\n", "Q: Will the aptitude/multiarch bug allow a successful upgrade from 10.04 LTS to 12.04LTS on a 64bit workstation?

(831768)\"\nIs this going to fail my i386 stuff in my amd64 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS release upgrade?\n\nA: No, because we don't use aptitude to upgrade between releases.

Today I upgraded from 10.04 to 12.04 (via 11.10 first).\nI performed both of these upgrades using the CDs as this was on a system with a very bad internet connection (and in fact the network connection was non-existent when I did the upgrades).\nEverything seemingly went fine, except for one quite important aspect: my original (10.04) users have not been preserved.  However the files are still there in /home/xxx, so at least there's no concern about any data loss.\nI had two users in my original setup: an admin user that used Unity, and my main user (non-admin) that used Gnome Classic. (I realise this may well be irrelevant.)\nDuring both of the upgrades I performed today I was asked \"Who are you?\" and prompted to enter my name, username, new password, etc.  This is where I first got suspicious, so on both of these occasions I created an entirely new user.\nOn the initial upgrade (10.04 to 11.10) there was no mention of the possibility of importing old users at all.  Then on the second upgrade (11.10 to 12.04) an \"Import User\" (or similar) screen appeared after the \"Who are you?\" screen, but it was accompanied by a message saying there were no suitable users found that could be imported.\nSo... my question at last: What is the best way to resurrect my old users?\nIs there an import tool I can use?\nShould I just create a new user with the same name and see what happens?\nShould I create a new user with a different name and copy the old user over it in its entirety?\nOr should I create a new user and just copy across the old data piece-by-piece as-and-when it's needed?\nOne last note: I do have a Deja Dup backup of the users on my NAS, and I'm currently creating a tar archive of them too (although the tar will obviously be from post-upgrades).\nAny help or advice would be much appreciated!\nThanks,\nthoughton.\n\nA: When performing an \"upgrade\" skipping releases (as you did when upgrading from 10.04 to 11.10) we will create a new installation with files in HOME untouched. Unlike an upgrade from 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS or from 11.10 to 12.04 users and groups from the previous installation are not preserved.\nThere is no other way than creating these users again with their home pointing to the former user home in /home/<username>. This will at least restore configuration settings and the private files for each user. \nCommand line\nWhen creating our new user from the command line we can also assign a path to the HOME (which would be the existing path):\nsudo adduser --home /home/myuser myuser\n\nGUI\nTo do so from a GUI you may have to install gnome-system-tools  to have access to advanced user settings from users-admin (search for Users & Groups in the Dash). Choose Advanced Settings to configure the users's home:\n\nTake care to give the users the same permissions they had before. In case there were any groups other that the default groups relevant to the user you need to assign them to these groups as well.\n", "Q: Will 12.04's network manager work on my Lenovo S12, it doesn't in 11.10?

I have found 1.6u20 to be the most stable java version for ToS so far.  Please if anyone else knows how to resolve these issues please let us know, I know many are suffering...\n\nA: I am running Ubuntu 12.04 and had the same problem with its version of openJDK and thinkorswim.  I modified the script \"thinkTDA\" (which I installed on my desktop) to direct thinkorswim to use a particular JVM, avoiding the need to remove openJDK or your \"normal\" JVM that may not be working with the program.  To do this, I installed Sun JRE 1.6u31 in a folder in my home directory (outside my search path), then modified line 4 of thinkTDA from\n# INSTALL4J_JAVA_HOME_OVERRIDE=\n\nto\nINSTALL4J_JAVA_HOME_OVERRIDE=/home/[myusername]/myjava/jre1.6.0_31\n\nSo far it has been stable, and I can use the latest version of Java for other applications as before.  I have not tried this with other JVM's other than Sun 1.7u4, which as reported elsewhere also gave me problems.  I expect that when thinkorswim catches up to the latest JVM's I will be able simply to revert the script to its original form.\n", "Q: Odd red pixels appear all over screen When attempting to boot Ubuntu/Xubuntu/etc from a LiveCD, my screen displays \"color scrambled\" random pixels for a few seconds after the loading screen with the 5 dots, and then turns completely black with a few scattered red pixels.

Regressions are usually caused by a hardware or software change that didn't agree with Ubuntu. In your case, if you have not tried it already, uninstall the Nvidia driver. If it is so broken that you can't do that, you may have to boot from the Live CD to do it. Also, by \"With no unity. Or icons\", do you mean it boots into GNOME, or you just see the desktop background and nothing else?

And how do I fix it?\n\nA: Since this is one of the first pages that appears when searching for this problem, and there is no actual solution to it, I thought of posting one that worked for me.\n-- This should only work if you tinkered with fonts by using Ubuntu Tweak --\nSo, if you did do that, go to MyUnity, go to the fonts tab, and select Default Settings.

(You won't see the crash message if you start it from the dash.) I recommend enabling Apport crash reporting and then reporting a bug. To report the bug, read this page first, then try to run gnome-terminal, then let Apport submit information to Launchpad automatically and fill out the bug report in your web browser when it comes up.\nThe information sent to Launchpad when Apport automatically reports the crash is necessary for your bug report (for a crash, like this) to be useful. It's possible to manually generate this information, but there is very little reason to do so, since Apport does the job quite well.\n", "Q: Missing launcher after 12.04 upgrade I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04 and after doing some updates and such my application launcher and title bars (for window dialogues) are missing. Basically the entire Unity GUI is missing!\nNot sure what happened so I installed GNOME 3 and it was missing a launcher too, but did have title bars. In addition the bar found at the top that lets you know what's open and allows GNOME extensions to be displayed is not interactive. I can't click, right click, alt + click (right or left), alt + super click (right or left) anywhere! I even installed an application menu from the GNOME site and it is not interactive either. However, since there is no way to launch applications I have to use terminal and if I minimize an app it will disappear completely.\nThen I decided to try Unity 2D and it is incredibly messed up. Black background, launcher is there but icons and top bar while on desktop are completely distorted. They're not just pixelated; they're all sorts of funky colors and when I open something from Unity 2D launcher it will show it's opened in the launcher but nothing appears on my screen.\nWhen trying to view videos on YouTube the video is distorted and looks just as Unity 2D does. Strange enough: the audio works fine, just not videos. Pictures loads, but not ads that stream video.\nAny suggestions to get my launcher and the Unity GUI back? I tried reinstalling GNOME, Unity 3D, and Unity 2D from terminal. No change. Also reinstalled Unity desktop and tried resetting it: nothing happened.\n\nA: I had the same problem.

Try them if you don't want to lose all your compiz customizations.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears\n\n*How do I reset my Unity configuration?\nIn my case just resetting Unity wasn't enough, so I decided to get rid of all compiz settings.\n\nA: Simon's method works if you are not able to open terminal you can work in login shells(virtual consoles).\n@erik you could have done it in any virtual consoles\nctrl+alt+F1-6\n\nI think it would have worked.\n\nA: If you have a blank screen and nothing else apart from the mouse, you should still be able to call up terminal.\nIf so, install CCSM if you haven't already done so:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager \n\nThen once it's installed, in the same terminal just do:\nccsm\n\nWhen the manager GUI pops up, go to desktop/ubuntu unity plugin and make sure it's enabled.\nIf it's already enabled, disable and then re-enable, log out and log back in and all should be back to normal.\nIf you have the issue where Compiz continues to crash at boot, simply create a shell script:\nsleep 3\ncompiz --replace\nend\n\nYou can then simply add this to your start up applications and it will reset Compiz on boot, obviously making sure you have made the file executable first though.\n\nA: In my case I had an old .gnomerc file that seemed to be the culprit. Probably from some very old compiz install (circa 2008). Removing the file solved the problem for me, may help someone else. \nFile was: \ncat .gnomerc\nexport LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1\n\nrm ~/.gnomerc and reboot or log out/in.\n\nA: Removing the Compiz directories worked for me, but since I could not get a terminal, I had to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Ubuntu Live from a CD\n\n*Open a terminal window and issue 'sudo -s' to get root privileges (no password required)\n\n*do a df command to see the drives on the system (it will be a long name....)\n\n*cd /media/[drive name]\n\n*cd [your normal home directory]\n\n\nNow you can rename the compiz directories as per above.\nShut down the live session, remove the CD and boot from the hard disk.\nIt worked for me.  YMMV.\n\n\n*\n\n*if you have no live cd by hand just press CTRL+ALT+T \n\n*for hack more: \n\n*\n\n*create launch.sh with right mouse button on the desktop with text \"gnome-terminal\" in it (without quotes).\n\n*Set executable bit for this script in properties with RMB. \n\n*Execute it. \n\n\n\nA: Thank you! After upgrading to Precise, Unity was disabled (although not at first).\nInstalling compizconfig-settings-manager , running it via ccsm and applying the necessary changes to start Unity again did the trick!\n\nA: I have the same issue after doing an upgrade on my machine i lose the desktop backgroun and it remain totally black, but when i open my terminal it shows that there is a background. I tried other steps mention here on this thread. It turn out that the cinamon is the culprit. \nWhat i did is\n$ sudo apt-get remove cinamon*\nThen rebooted\nLogin to Gnome Classic - No effects \nIt Worked!\n\nA: I had pretty much the same problem under 12.04. Unity was slow with my aged GPU, so I was using Unity 2d as my desktop for months. For no apparent reason, it suddenly refused to display launchpad and title bar (for all users). Reenabling Unity in CCSM as suggested above was part of the solution, but none of the other measures suggested here, or in several other related threads, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalling unity\n\n*Reinstalling ubuntu desktop\n\n*Removing all relevant (e.g. compiz, gconf, etc.) configuration\ninformation\nhelped me to completely resolve these symptoms under 12.04 (64 bit).\nunity --reset\n\nwould not work for me. After delivering a variety of error and information messages, it would always hang at:\nSetting Update \"run_key\"\n\nas shown in the log posted in the thread titled \"unity has vanished\" for unity run with no arguments.\nI noticed that the error message delivered by:\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\nwas similar to some of the errors reported by unity --reset:\nerror while loading shared libraries: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.\n\nas reported by user139869 here.  Unfortunately, his solution did not work for me.\nAfter extensive searching, I found the following solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the path of libGL.so.1 by using the command locate libGL.so.1.\n\n*Add a link to the library in /usr/lib/ as shown in the following\nexample:\n\n*sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386/mesa/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib\n(courtesy of J.D. Bartlett)\n\n*Restart the computer.\nThis not only allowed both unity_support_test-p and unity --reset to run, it also allowed Unity 2d to start. I have no idea what caused my problems, but since creating the links above (several weeks now) I have had no further problems.\n\nA: All you have to do is;\nStart Ubuntu tweak, go to Tweaks menu, select Desktop Icons, and change Show Desktop Icons to On.\nand that's it!\n", "Q: Touchpad not working on VAIO VGN-TZ170N I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my VAIO VGN-TZ170N and the touchpad isn't working. \nTried an external USB mouse and that isn't working either.\nAny ideas?\nThanks!\n\nA: Just tried the following solution, it seems OK now, hopefully for you too (I have a VAIO VGN also):\n\n\n*\n\n* Keyboard and touch pad is not working on a Dell XPS 15z\n", "Q: Can't stay connected to Wi-Fi Just upgraded to 12.04 this morning and all of a sudden it won't stay connected to my home wi-fi.

I have two phones, a BlackBerry Bold and a Galaxy Nexus and when i set either one of them to hotspot, my computer will connect and it stays connected, but it will not stay connected to my home wifi.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I had the same problem, wireless network would ask for a password to authenticate, then connect and after a couple of seconds it would disconnect again. This process would repeat itself over and over.

Wait 45 seconds, plug back in). If that doesn't help, I'd reboot my computer. If there's still no joy, I'd look into the settings of your wifi modem/router.\n\nA: I was having the exact same problem.  I just upgraded to 12.04 LTS, and then the wireless router asked for the key as soon as I powered up.  I put in the correct key, it accepted the key and said connection established, then I had from 15 to 30 seconds of normal connectivity until the network disconnected and asked for the key again.\nI restarted everything with no change in its behavior.\nI think I have the solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go up to the top right corner and click on the settings icon.\n\n*Select network.\n\n*Select wireless.\n\n*Pull down the network name box and select your network SSID.\n\n*Click on options.\n\n*Click on the wireless security tab.\n\n*Enter your network key, then click save.\nAfter doing this, I have stayed connected for the last half hour with no problems.

I am using a 500 GB External Hard-drive (\"Elements\").  I get through the first part of using the start-up disk creator. I select Ubuntu 12.04 \"Precise Pangolin\" as the ISO, and my external hard-drive, which has 150 GB free, as the disc to use.  I hit \"Make Startup Disc\".   It asks me for authentication before I can copy files, and that part works.  Then after copying files, it asks for authentication again to install the boot loader.  At this point, it immediately says \"Failed to install the bootloader.\"   Any idea why I am having a problem?\n\nA: As of July 2015 this bug was not yet fixed in Kubuntu 14.04 LTS. \nSo, just use the dd command:\nsudo dd if=sourceFileName.iso of=/dev/sd*\n\nWhere sd* is the name of the USB stick (E.g. sdb).\n\nA: Same message.\nYou can do it with UNetbootin\nInstall UNetbootin in Ubuntu\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gezakovacs/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unetbootin\n\nRun UNetbootin\nunetbootin\n\n\nA: I know with Ubuntu Quantal (12.10) usb-creator-gtk is currently plagued with Bug 915626. But your using 12.04\nMy recommendation would be to start fresh. Open the 'Disks' manager and format your usb drive and delete the current partition.  Then recreate a New FAT32 partition and format.\nAfter that is complete try the usb-creator again, see if you make any headway. If it still fails might I suggest a workaround.\nIn the Software Center look for a program called, \"UnetBootin\" \nInstall it and simply select the \"Diskimage\" bullet. Make sure the 2nd dropdown says \"ISO\" and press the button to select the ISO you wish to burn onto your disk.\nMake sure that your USB Drive is selected under \"Type\" and the Drive is properly set to /dev/sdb1/  (Assuming your usb disk is /dev/sdb)\nLet me know how that turns out!\n\nA: Check your partition format . If it was NTFS ,then try to reformat to FAT32 and make your startup live usb again using Startup Disc Creator.\n\nA: I had a very similar problem and solved it by using another usb-maker.\nFirst I was using the KDE default usb-maker on Kubuntu 14.04 and flashed my stick a few times with different live images. Then \"something\" went not correctly somehow and my pc could not write the bootloader. So I tried \n\n\n*\n\n*another image that worked before\n\n*compared the sd5 checksum, to see if the image was damaged\n\n*tried to copy data on the stick an read it from there to check the stick\n\n*tried to format it and place the partition few GB to the \"right\" (maybe the chips at the beginning were damaged, I have no idea)...\n\n\n...same problem everytime at about 54% \"couldn't install bootloader\".\nAt the end I was booting from linux-mint 17 and used the default usb-maker from there. Everything worked fine.\nSo maybe you try unetbootin or also from another distro.\n\nA: I got the same message.\nApparently it has something to do with permissions.  Without even taking the USB out I\nopened a command prompt and did \nsudo -i\n\nthen did\nusb-creator-kde\n\nIt installed without complaint.\n\nA: This error message results from a couple different bugs including one mentioned earlier in this thread. \nIt happens to me on 14.04 even with a new FAT partition. \nUnfortunately the fixes haven't been backported to 12.04 or even 14.04 for that matter. \nSo, I'd recommend using UnetBootin as mentioned. \n\nA: I have had a similar problem using ubuntu 14.04.\nEverything seems to work fine until the end where it says \"Failed to install bootloader\"\nAlthough this certainly seems to be an issue, the bootable media still seems to work fine, even after receiving this message. \nDid you still try booting into the usb stick after receiving the message?\nIn your bios you should have it set to boot into usb if connected, or go to your temporary boot menu (usually esc or f12 while booting)\nIf it still does work it could simply be the specific distro you are installing.

I am not sure which version of KDE I was running in 11.10, but I didn't really do anything except install recommended upgrades on my machine since I installed 11.10.\nMy question is about the Alt-Tab behavior in the (new?) version of KDE that came with 12.04.  Previously when I pressed Alt-Tab, a grid of small icons corresponding to the windows I had open on the desktop I was currently on was displayed, with the window in focus highlighted.  Now I get just one row of large icons on a fat \"tape\" with about 5 and a half of them fitting on the screen at a time (and I've got a 1920x1080 pixel screen!), the rest being invisible off the screen.  I usually have more than 5 windows open, and I would like to be able to see the icons for the whole set of them.  However, I have not been able to do this.\nI've been to System Settings->Window Behavior->Task Switcher->Main tab and played around with that to no avail.  Is there another place I can look?  Thank you for any help!\n\nA: You can choose from several different styles for task switching in KDE 4.8. Refer to the first screenshot.

Comment them out with #.\n(Info derived from : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-options-slave.html)\nThe options affected are shown in this list:\n --master-host\n --master-user\n --master-password\n --master-port\n --master-connect-retry\n --master-ssl\n --master-ssl-ca\n --master-ssl-capath\n --master-ssl-cert\n --master-ssl-cipher\n --master-ssl-key\n\n\nA: It seems to boil down to errors in the MySQL configuration, located in /etc/mysql/my.cnf and files in /etc/mysql/conf.d/.\nIn my case it was a wrong bind-address value, because the IP address of my machine had changed and MySQL couldn't bind anymore. Feel free to rea more on this in this blog article.\n\nA: I finally figured out the issue. Basically, the definition of some parameters has been removed from the previous version of mysql and has been replaced with different names. To fix, in /etc/mysql/my.cnf, replace:\n# Tom Added to ensure the server character set is set to utf8\ndefault-character-set = utf8\ndefault-collation     = utf8_general_ci\n\nwith:\n# Tom Added to ensure the server character set is set to utf8\ncharacter_set_server  = utf8\ncollation_server      = utf8_general_ci\n\nThis is the associated launchpad bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mysql-5.5/+bug/958120.\nOr easily run:\n# Miraz added dpkg-reconfigure\ndpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.5\n\nBut make sure there's no old mysql version installation installed, if there was please remove:\n# Miraz quick mysql package check\ndpkg -l *mysql*\n\n\nA: A good way to debug the failures in the post-start process (/etc/init/mysql.conf) is to check the upstart logs:\nsudo tail -f /var/log/upstart/mysql.log \n\nThat gave me a socket error:\n\nerror: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket \n\nIn my case it was caused by a missing user setting under the [mysqld] group in my.cnf\n\nA: Innodb has a default setting (innodb_buffer_pool_size) which is set to 128M - this may be too large for your server (especially if you're using a small Amazon EC2 AMI - which I was)  The fix that worked for me was to add the following line to /etc/mysql/my.cnf\ninnodb_buffer_pool_size = 16M\n\nI wrote about this fix over here http://www.mlynn.org/2012/07/mysql-5-5-on-ubuntu-12-04-job-failed-to-start\n\nA: I had a similar problem. It was frustrating because I couldn't see any error logs indicating what the problem was.\nIn my case, the value I had set for innodb_buffer_pool_size was too large for the memory of the server.\nI found this out by running mysqld directly as the mysql user.\n# su mysql\n# mysqld\n\nThis way you actually see the error output.\n\nA: I had the same issue. It turned out to be the mysql my.cnf master slave replications.\nCheck your /var/log/mysql/error.log.\nI hope that's a little help. Check the mysql settings first before you waste two hours with apparmor which just works fine.\n\nA: When I had a similar MySQL error (\"Job failed to start\") after upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04, comment #27 on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mysql-dfsg-5.1/+bug/573318?comments=all worked perfectly for me. Quote:\n\nThe problem for me was that the file /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.mysqld did not exist after the upgrade. I manually copied one from one of the empty ones (i.e. only had header comment) and then everything was good to go.\n\n\nA: For me the solution was to remove the line ...\nset-variable = max_connections=200\n\n... which is MySQL 3.x syntax and needs to be changed to \nmax_connections=200\n\n\nA: I had the same issues, for me the bind-address was set improperly in my /etc/mysql/my.cnf file.  So it seems anything that isn't right in the my.cnf can cause this issue. I haven't found anything in the logs that indicated this as the issue.\n\nA: My problem was 0% of free space! Double check :-)\n\nA: Check the /tmp permissions. I had this problem, after many time googleing and restarts, i found out that /tmp permissions was 755.\nI change it to 777 and mysql start well.\n\nA: After an automatic update to mysqld-5.5.53 ubuntu 14.04.1, mysql would not start. These lines showed up in my syslog:\nOct 27 06:05:51 hostname kernel: [  593.168925] init: mysql post-start process (4997) terminated with status 1\nOct 27 06:05:51 hostname kernel: [  593.178241] type=1400 audit(1477562751.231:31): apparmor=\"STATUS\" operation=\"profile_replace\" profile=\"unconfined\" name\nOct 27 06:05:51 hostname kernel: [  593.204392] init: mysql main process (5032) terminated with status 1\nOct 27 06:05:51 hostname kernel: [  593.204404] init: mysql respawning too fast, stopped\n\nThe problem was solved by creating this directory:\nsudo mkdir /var/lib/mysql-files\nsudo chmod 700 /var/lib/mysql-files\nsudo chown mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql-files\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql start\n\n\nA: Just updated MySQL and AppArmor version as suggested here to fix this problem on Ubuntu 12.04 running on Amazon ec2 instance. I still get the error a few time but MySQL restarts itself automatically.\n\nA: I had the same error messages, but the cause was different. My InnoDB tables were corrupt, because the whole file system went into read-only mode. I fixed the corruption by adding the following line to /etc/mysql/my.cf\ninnodb_force_recovery = 1\n\nI started MySQL:\nsudo service mysql start\n\nMySQL did start and I dumped/exported all tables. I changed the innodb_force_recovery to 0 (=default) and restarted MySQL:\nsudo service mysql restart\n\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04 with MySQL 5.5. It took a long time before I found the problem and I hope I can help someone with this answer. See also http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/forcing-innodb-recovery.html\n\nA: In my case the problem was the /etc/mysql/my.cnf file permission.\nI changed it for cenvenience but it caused erros like\nkernel: [604528.290448] type=1400 audit(1424350956.727:193): apparmor=\"STATUS\" operation=\"profile_replace\" profile=\"unconfined\" name=\"/usr/sbin/mysqld\" pid=15008 comm=\"apparmor_parser\"\n\nThe my.cnf permission was 766 and I changed it to 744 and two of three errors went away.\nThere is still one similar error message but it did not prevent mysql from starting.\nHope this helps...\n\nA: In my case, I had a wrong bind-address declaration. I ran ifconfig to discover the EC2's private IP address and updated it in the /etc/mysql/my.cnf file.\n\nA: In my case i found a permission problem on /tmp. I just setted the tmp's directory permission to 766 and restart mysql service. Fixed out. \n", "Q: Is it possible that dual booting could destroy my hard drive? I noticed that any time I install Ubuntu 11.10 or 12.04 alongside my Windows 7 OS, the Windows partition runs very slowly and the hard drive always seems busy in Windows 7. I have had a hard drive completely fail in the past -- could the dual booting be the problem?\n\nA: Hard drives fragment over time so you could try running you defragger (in Windows).This will only defrag your c drive.\nedit\nI don't see how a dual boot could ruin a hd seeing how you would have to partition the hd to dual boot, but i'm not sure.\n\nA: No, dual booting can not cause any harm to your harddisk. It only stores the beginning and end of partitions which each contains one filesystem. The partitions simply says at which byte of the disk the filesystem starts and ends. The operating system will then only work within that area. So if your partition table gets messed up, you can get some very interesting results. It could seriously damage your data, but your harddisk wouldn't care at all. To the harddisk, each byte is as good as another. \nParticularly in Windows, it is quite common for harddisks to seem slower over time. It's not because the disk becomes slower, but because the data gets scattered around, meaning the harddisk has to do more work to get the same job done. You can defragment your disk in Windows using its built-in tools or third-party tools, like Perfect Disk. \nOne thing you should be aware of, is that this happens more quickly if your filesystem is very full. If it's an option, you should always try to have at least 20% free space. So if, while installing Ubuntu, you resized your Windows partition that left very little free space, this can explain why it slows down.\nOther than that, two filesystems do not affect one another, and the disk doesn't care about filesystems at all. \n", "Q: Am I using all the power of my PC in Ubuntu? How can I find this out? My computer has a CPU with 4 cores and 4GB RAM.\nWhat I want is to find out, if I am using all the available power that my PC offers to me?

That's ok, you're correctly using all the available RAM.\n\n*You have 4 cores.

When you move seekbar, you can hear sound for half a second though, but then it stops. \nPlays music just fine from mounted drives. Also tested with Banshee and VLC player: both played files with no problems.\nSystem: clean-installed 12.04\n\nA: I had the same problem; now fixed. As Dries says, the solution was to mount the share... but then I also had to use the dconf-editor and set org.gnome.rhythmbox.rhythmdb/locations to the mount directory. Simply using the Rhythmbox Music->Import Folder menu item only resulted in import errors being generated regardless of whether I directed it to a Nautilus 'bookmark' of the share or to a manually mounted share.\n\nSetting up the share mount\nFirst, install samba and cifs:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install samba cifs-utils\n\nThen determine the IP address for your server. In this case, mine is called myserver:\nnmblookup myserver\n\nWhich will output something like this:\nquerying myserver on 192.168.1.255\n192.168.1.10 myserver<00>\n\nYou're looking at the second line of the output for the IP address of the server. Then edit your fstab file to automatically mount the share on that server each time your computer starts up. In this case, my share is called databox:\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nAnd insert this line at the bottom of the fstab file:\n//192.168.1.10/databox /mnt/databox cifs noauto,guest 0 0\n\nNow mount the share for this session:\nsudo mount /mnt/databox\n\n...and check that there are no errors. Your share should be listed when you type:\ndf -h\n\nand you should be able to navigate to the share and view its contents:\ncd /mnt/databox\nls\n\nIf you've had errors at this point, you need to review the contents of your fstab file.\nNote that this method assumed that your server doesn't have a DHCP IP address assigned to it by your router. You might need to 'fix' the IP address in your router configuration before proceeding. Also, if your network share requires a userid and password, you may need to change the guest option to something similar this.\n\nMounting automatically on each boot\nUnless you want to have to manually mount the share after every boot with sudo mount /mnt/databox, you also need to make a script to automatically mount your share:\ncd /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d\nsudo gedit mountnfs\n\n...and put the following into your script:\nmount /mnt/databox\n\nSave the script and exit from the text editor. Finally, make the script executable:\nsudo chmod 755 mountnfs\n\nReboot your system, and then check that the share has been mounted successfully with:\ndf -h\n\nNote that Network Manager is the Ubuntu default. If you're using a different network tool, you could try placing this script into /etc/network/if-up.d/ instead. You can't just set the fstab share option to auto, because Linux tries to mount drives before it sets up networks. Other potential approaches for this stage might be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*include the _netdev option in fstab. However, this apparently doesn't work until you run systemctl enable NetworkManager-wait-online.service, which requires systemd, which isn't fully compatable with Ubuntu.\n\n*use autofs and automount, which apparently can hang the system on shutdown.\n\n\n\nGetting Rhythmbox to recognise the music on your share\nNow install and run the dconf-editor:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\nsudo dconf-editor\n\nNavigate through the tree to org.gnome.rhythmbox.rhythmdb and find the locations setting. Then change this setting to something like:\n['file:///mnt/databox/Music']\n\n...check the monitor-library tickbox... and you're done!   (fingers crossed)\n\nNB: I'm using Rhythmbox 2.97 on Ubuntu 12.10 with Network Manager 0.9.6.0-0ubuntu7\n\nA: I had the same issue (music was skipping a lot) even after I mounted the CIFS share. The solution I found is to add cache=loose in the mount options. Note that using this option can have drawbacks if the files are accessed by multiple users at the same time. Read man mount.cifs for more information on CIFS caching.\nI'm using Rhythmbox 2.99.1.\n\nA: This has been reported as a rhythmbox bug\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rhythmbox/+bug/977866\nIf you mount the share to the local file system it works fine.\n(make sure to remove the database and re-import all songs from the new location)\n\nA: I created a symbolic link from my share in ~/.gvfs and then navigated via the symbolic link and was able to play the .mp3 files.

When I try to install Ubuntu 12.04 64-Bits on my desktop computer, I don't get any video output from the installation since I click \"Install Ubuntu\" (or something like that). It stays with a black screen just like in a console.\nI googled about my problem and I found that maybe Ubuntu isn't capable of showing image when running on a Nvidia Geforce GTX 550 TI, but I couldn't find any solution. How can I install Ubuntu on my dear computer? :P\nPS: The problem isn't with the USB I use, I installed already Ubuntu 12.04 64 into my netbook Asus 1215P, and is working fine.\n\nA: \nI figured it out. When the installation pops up, I clicked F6, then ESC. In the text that appeared on the screen, I changed quiet to noquiet, splash to nosplash, and added nomodeset right after nosplash.\n\nThis was very helpful and worked for me too\n\nThe install finally opened. When installed I checked \"install updates during install\" and \"install third party software\" (or something like that) after connected to my wireless network, and when the setup finished and I rebooted my computer, everything was working just fine, with NVidia drivers installed and Unity 3D working.\n\nI didn't see those options, so after it installed it went back to the test drive.\n\nFor Alternate install: After base packages are installed (before grub install), open a prompt (ALT+F2) and \"chroot /target\", then \"apt-get install nvidia-current\", \"CTRL+D\" to exit chroot, \"ALT+F1\" to resume install. Complete the installation and you should be good to go.\n\nDon't know, mine installed then I was back at the test drive and couldn't make permanent changes.  Rebooting went to blank screen.\nSo at that point I rebooted and selected recovery mode and then chose fail safe graphics option.  This allowed me to boot.  Then I was able to go to Ubuntu Software Center and get nvidia current (wow, a lot of bad reviews).  I also was able to run the updates (387 of them).  I was able to reboot to 12.04 ok.  Then I opened system settings, additional drivers, and searched.  Current NVIDIA accelerated driver was activated.  I activated post-release updates.  Rebooted and all is good so far.\n\nA: I figured it out. When the installation pops up, I clicked F6, then ESC.

I would like to modify the images that are included in MAAS so that I can install laptops and desktops with it instead of the normal cloud images.\n\nA: Edit /var/lib/cobbler/snippets/mass_client_packages\nAdd whatever package you need in a the same format as a debian preseed file, here is the default:\nd-i pkgsel/include string cloud-init openssh-server python-software-properties vim avahi-daemon server^\n\nYou can add packages you want in there, or you can then customise this to do something like the desktop instead:\nd-i pkgsel/include string ubuntu-desktop\n\nThis will install your packages on all subsequent installations (previously provisioned machines will be unaffected).\n\nA: I'm by no means an expert on this but it appears that you can configure the preseed to add late_commands. For example, you can configure the preseed to install a package based on the hostname, and after the installation has been completed:\nlate_commands:\n{{if node.hostname == 'node01'}}\n    package_install: [\"curtin\", \"in-target\", \"--\", \"apt-get\", \"-y\", \"install\", \"mysql\"]\n{{endif}}\n\nNote the following:\nWarning\nDo not try to alter the preseed files if you don’t have a good understanding of what you are doing.

Enter it and press enter to continue)\n\n*echo \"/dev/sda6 none swap sw 0 0\" >> /etc/fstab\nAfter that, reboot your system and check again.\n\nFor people who are wondering why I'm using sudo su, in stead of just su; su doesn't appear to work for me anymore in Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: When you resize your swap it changes the UUID name in /etc/fstab. If you don't have a label (/dev/sda5 for example) in your /etc/fstab file it will not recognize the new swap. As it explains in the fstab file, using UUID is more robust in some cases (obviously not in this one).\nUnmount the swap drive and copy it's UUID:\n>sudo swapoff -av\nswapoff on /dev/sda5\n\n>sudo mkswap /dev/sda5\nSetting up swapspace version 1, size = 16604156 KiB\nno label, UUID=f0ac7203-dac5-479b-a33a-be7a3dca6aae\n\nUpdate the UUID of your swap in /etc/fstab to the new value from the step above:\n>sudo vim /etc/fstab\n\nNow remount, note the identical swapsize and devsize:\n>sudo swapon -a --verbose\nswapon on /dev/sda5\nswapon: /dev/sda5: found swap signature: version 1, page-size 4, same byte order\nswapon: /dev/sda5: pagesize=4096, swapsize=17002659840, devsize=17002659840\n\nAlthough looking at the accepted answer above I see now what I needed to know, I wanted to make it more explicit here after finding the answer in Pollox's post\nMost responses to my problem suggested changing the `/etc/fstab' line to use the label rather than the UUID. I was hesitant to do so and therefore was unable to resolve the issue until I came across the fact that the UUID changes as well.\n", "Q: 1080p Screen resolution problem after 10.04 to 12.04 update I have a Samsung LCD 40\" with a NVidia GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 Card.\nI recently upgraded from 10.04 to 12.04 and the best resolution I can get is 1360x768.\nI've tried the propietary drivers available on the repository\nkmod:nvidia_current\nkmod:nvidia_173_updates\nkmod:nvidia_current_updates\nkmod:nvidia_96\nkmod:nvidia_96_updates\nkmod:nvidia_173\n\nI've also downloaded latest from NVidia's Web, version: 295.40.\nBut still no luck.\nWith Nouveau driver, I can only get 1024x768.\nI know there is no problem with my hardware (video card, cable and monitor),  I was using it perfectly on 10.04.\nCan anybody suggest something else I could try, to get my 1920x1080 resolution back?\nHere are some more information, that I got reading other similar posts on askubuntu.\nlspci | grep VGA:\n00:0d.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation C61 [GeForce 6150SE nForce 430] (rev a2)\n\nxrandr:\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 240, current 1360 x 768, maximum 1360 x 768\ndefault connected 1360x768 0 0 0mm x 0mm\n   1360x768       50.0     52.0* \n   1024x768       51.0  \n   800x600        53.0     54.0     55.0  \n   680x384        56.0     57.0  \n   640x480        58.0  \n   576x432        59.0  \n   512x384        60.0  \n   400x300        61.0     62.0     63.0  \n   320x240        64.0  \n\n\nA: I activated the Nvidia experimental drivers in Ubuntu 12.04 while in Unity 2D, then restarted and logged into Unity 3D and everything worked fine.

I would like to know, is it possible for a friend to upload a file into my folder? For example, I would like to invite a client to upload a video file to a folder I have shared with her, so that I may work on that file.\nThanks, \nMercedes\n\nA: Yes. When sharing a folder to someone, you have the option of granting them permission to write to that folder. If you've already shared the folder without write access to that person, you may need to re-share it to them again, and select to allow write access.\nAlso note, any files the other person puts in your folder, will count toward your storage quota. If the file you want her to upload to you through Ubuntu One is larger than you're remaining available space, she won't be able to upload it until you either make space by deleting files you may no longer need, or purchase more storage space.\n", "Q: 12.04 Installation Not Completing Here's the problem I've been having, installing from a CD I burned, in the 'Try Ubuntu' mode: I get to the point where I'm asked to fill in my name, the computer name, etc.; after I press 'Continue', the installation window closes and the installation doesn't go any further - i.e., the system doesn't seem to start actually installing, and I'm never asked to restart the computer or do anything else. All that happens is I get the desktop and a busy cursor...for seven and a half hours. Restarting the computer after waiting that seven and a half hours resulted in nothing but a '_' blinking on and off at the point where I'd expect Ubuntu to boot if it'd installed properly.\nWhat am I doing wrong, or, failing my being at fault somehow, what can I do to fully install Ubuntu?

It often occurs if you sleep your client computer and resume later.\n\nA: Client configuration\nTry creating the file:\n~/.ssh/config\n\nAdd the contents:\nHost *\n  ServerAliveInterval 30\n  ServerAliveCountMax 5\n\nNow ssh to your server and see if your problem is fixed. ClientAliveInterval option is only useful when configuring the ssh server (aka sshd), it does not change a thing on the ssh client side, so don't use it in the above configuration file.\nThis will send a hello-are-you-there signal to the server if no packets have been received in the preceding 30 seconds (as specified above). However, if the number of consecutive hello-are-you-there signals reach ServerAliveCountMax then ssh will disconnect from the server.  This value is defaulting to 3 (so 3*30 = 90 seconds without server activity), increase it if it suits your needs.  There are alot more config options to the .ssh/config file and you could read:\nUsing an SSH Config File\nFor more information on other options.  You may not want to apply this to every server you connect to which this example will. Or restrain it to only a particular server by replacing the line Host * with Host <IP> (replace  by an IP address, see ssh_config man page).\nServer configuration\nSimilarly you can tell the server to be gentle with your clients. The configuration file is /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\nClientAliveInterval 20\nClientAliveCountMax 5\n\nYou can either deactivate it by setting ClientAliveInterval to 0 or tweak ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax to set a maximum ssh client inactivity without responding to the probes. One advantage of this settings over TCPKeepAlive is that the signals are sent through the encrypted channels, so it is less likely to be spoofable.\n\nA: For me, I was getting Write failed: Broken pipe even when I was actively typing in vim or at the shell prompt. I couldn't browse the internet locally either for awhile either. (I was connecting remotely to Ubuntu using Terminal.)\nOthers in my network stream a lot of video from Netflix and other places.

If that doesn't work then train a monkey to press enter every two minutes while you work.\nYou could set either ServerAliveInterval in /etc/ssh/ssh_config of the client machine or ClientAliveInterval in /etc/ssh/sshd_config of the server machine. Try reducing the interval if you are still getting the error.\nConfiguration for a single user can be set in file ~/.ssh/config both on the server and client side.

It will keep printing the current time stamp on the server and keeps your connection alive as long as the connection is not dropped by any other reason.

If they are sent, death of the connection\n  or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.  However,\n  this means that connections will die if the route is down temporarily,\n  and some people find it annoying (The default is 'yes').\nServerAliveInterval - Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which\n  if no data has been received from the server, ssh(1) will send a\n  message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the\n  server.  The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be\n  sent to the server.\n\n\nFor the server, edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config as:\nClientAliveInterval 600\nClientAliveCountMax 0\n\nIf you want ssh client to exit (timeout) automatically after 10 minutes (600 seconds).\n\nClientAliveCountMax – This indicates the total number of checkalive\n  message sent by the ssh server without getting any response from the\n  ssh client. Default is 3.\nClientAliveInterval – This indicates the timeout in seconds. After x\n  number of seconds, ssh server will send a message to the client asking\n  for response.

Screen is a powerful utility that allows you to control multiple terminals which will stay alive independently of the ssh session. For example, if you run screen in an ssh session you will see a new terminal open and you can use that to run jobs. Lets say your ssh session dies in the process. Running screen -d then screen -r will reopen the last session and you will be able to continue from there.

I use reFit to be able to choose which one to boot but I've never had a problem with reFit in the past.  I was running Ubuntu 11.10, but just upgraded today to 12.04.  I'm quite excited to try it out, after hearing about some of the improvements and additions.\nI installed and rebooted, and no errors were displayed during this process.  After restarting, I edited my grub the way I normally do (I have an option that I enabled on grub that hasn't been working and I keep forgetting to change it, so I have to do it each time on boot).  Anyway, the keyboard worked just fine at that point (it had to, because I typed with it), but after hitting ctrl+X and initializing the boot, it seems to stop working.  No messages pop up, but then it gets to the login screen and the icons in the top show the \"image not found\" icon ( http://www.aerotaskforce.com/thumb/Capturar.JPG/w/150 ) and no input devices work.  The built-in trackpad does not allow me to move the mouse and doesn't seem to register anything (the mouse is stuck in the middle of the screen), and the keyboard doesn't allow me to type in my password.\nSo, I had to manually restart by hitting the power button, and this time I chose recovery mode.  However, even then, I didn't see any problems.  The only error I got was that \"pty\" failed.\nIs there any way I can fix this without having to reinstall the entire OS from scratch?\n*EDIT :: * \nI determined that this is Unity and not the keyboard drivers, because they work on grub and in command line, when I managed to boot into that.  Booted into command line and ran \"sudo apt-get -f install\" and it ran for about ten minutes, during which I noticed that my fans don't work an Ubuntu anymore either. So, in trying to install the ability to manually control my fans, I determined that my network card is not recognized anymore, either, and I can't apt-get install anything. So, whatever it was, I broke everything.\nDuring the apt-get -f install process, I got this message:\n\"temperature above threshold cpu clock throttled\"\n\nA: The solution to the temperature issue on the Macbook Pro (6,2) was to create a script to self monitor it.  That's the best I could come up with.  First, install lm-sensors via apt-get, and then run sudo sensors-detect and answer yes to all the questions and everything.  Then sensors should return your hardware settings.  The script is something along the lines of:\nsensors | grep --color=\"none\" \"Core\"\nsensors | grep --color=\"none\" \"side\"\nif [[ $1 < 6001 && $1 > 1999 ]]\n    then\n    sudo echo $1 > /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/fan1_min\n    sudo echo $1 > /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/fan2_min\nfi\n\nThe first command will return both your CPU temperatures, and the second will return your current fan speed.  Then we do a sanity check to make sure that you don't accidentally add a 0 and try to run your fans at 60,000 RPM (the fans might have something built-in to prevent this, but I didn't want to take a chance on blowing them up, because that would be very awkward to explain.\nName that script something like spoolFTL or whatever you like.  Then, you can set the fan speed to a number, x, by running sudo bash spoolFTL 4500.  The directory is relative, though, so you might consider putting it in the root directory so you can run sudo bash /spoolFTL 4500.\napt-get -f install fixed the networking and keyboard and such.  Unity doesn't freeze at login, but it does crash after awhile (usually 10 minutes), and I have to do a hard reset.  Console still works fine, though.\nEdit: In my experience, I've been keeping the CPU at around 45°C to keep it happy.  In command line, 2000 RPM has been enough to keep it at this temperature quite easily (as in OSX), but when I start Unity, I have to generally run it about 4000-4500 RPM (probably about the same in 11.10, as well).  I imagine this is due to the high CPU requirements of the Unity desktop.  When I first started Unity, I kept it at 3000 and thought it would be enough.  A few minutes of Firefox browsing later, I checked it and my CPUs were at 75°.\n", "Q: Can't login (through GUI) after upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 After upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04 I can't login with my account through the GUI.

I ask since in 11.04 and 11.10 I tried and I had problems with this. Will try on 12.04 when I buy a new pen drive.\n\nA: The easiest way is to mount the filesystem.squashfs, copy everything out into a temp directory, chroot into that directory, add all of your new entries/download all new packages, and recreate the squashfs. The commands to do so would be as follows:\nmkdir /mnt/temp; mount -o loop /path/to/ISO /mnt/temp\nmkdir /mnt/temp2; mount -o loop /mnt/temp/casper/filesystem.squashfs /mnt/temp2\nmkdir /tmp/toEdit; rsync -avhP /mnt/temp2/* /tmp/toEdit\nmount --bind /dev /tmp/toEdit/dev\nmount --bind /dev/pts /tmp/toEdit/dev/pts\nmount --bind /sys /tmp/toEdit/sys\nmount --bind /proc /tmp/toEdit/proc\ncp /etc/resolv.conf /tmp/toEdit/etc/\nchroot /tmp/toEdit\n\nFrom here just edit like you would a normal system, then when you exit make a new squashfs and proceed like normal.\nI WOULD NOT RECOMMEND a full install on the usb, if you plan on using the usb for longer than a year or two. That will eat your read/write cycles up in no time and bring the lifetime of the usb to about 1/10 of what it should be. Aside from that, don't forget to make your secondary casper-rw partition and put persistent as a kernel argument. Good Luck!\n\nA: You you can.  \nI would approach this as a full install to USB as opposed to a USB liveCD respin.  It simplifies a lot of problems.  \nThe problem with using a liveCD with persistence is that the paths on which you achieve persistence are limited.  \nIt is much simpler to:\n - do a full install to USB - preferred\n - remaster the CD/DVD to include the updates and PPAs  \nIf you do a full install to USB, it behaves exactly like a real install as long as you tweak grub to use disk labels instead of UUIDs.\n", "Q: Upgrading to Ubuntu 12.04 loses keyboard and mouse I just upgraded my Ubuntu to 12.04, and somehow its lost keyboard and mouse support, Logitech EX110 Cordless, preventing me from logging in, both the main and recovery mode won't respond to any keys at all, the previous kernal recovery mode does see the keyboard. Can I reverse this fatal upgrade somehow? Using the 12.04 live CD does work, but upon trying a reinstall, it hangs on \"reinstalling previously installed packaged\", which don't seem to install because \"You have held broken packages\".\n\nA: Upon upgrade I was unable to use my Logitech MX550 wireless keyboard and mouse.\nUsing information from this site, I was able to gain full use of my mouse and keyboard as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*I booted into Ubuntu 12.04 on my desktop.\n\n*Booted into Ubuntu on my laptop.\n\n*Used ssh on my laptop to log into my desktop.\n\n*\n\n*After logging in via ssh but before performing step 4, you may need to use lsusb to determine your receiver's product ID.

Here's what I did -- hopefully it'll work for you.  I solved these problems, but right now my monitor isn't playing nice with it, so I still have to fix that.\nFirst of all, on boot, press \"e\" when selecting your partition to edit the boot parameters.  Look for something that says \"quiet splash\" and confirm that \"text\" is not appended to the end of that.  Shouldn't be by default, but I had added it at one point.\nSecond, boot.  When the Ubuntu logo splash screen pops up, press Ctrl+Alt+F1 (you might also need the Function key pressed if you're on a laptop).  In the terminal, login and run\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nThis will probably run for awhile, so let it go.  Hopefully your computer's fans will be working (at this point, I noticed mine didn't, and I received a warning during the update that my CPU temperature was above the threshold and that the clock would be throttled.  If that happens, try this -- it should work for your computer.  If you're on a Mac, you'll have to do something slightly different.\nYour networking probably won't be working, either, but after the apt-get command runs, reboot and it should work again.\nAfter that process, my computer is running it fine, though I have to manually watch the temperature and set the fans accordingly.  My only problem was one time that my monitor went blank, as though it had set the display to sleep mode.\n\nA: I had a similar problem but couldn't get a usable console like previosly described.\nInstead I made a 12.04 USB boot image. Due to the fact that this image did actually work on my laptop Asus EEE 1215B I continued opening a terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T) from where I was able to mount my harddisk (see /etc/fstab for details) Om my PC it was /dev/sda1.\nSo I did:\nsudo mkdir /tmp/xx\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /tmp/xx\n\nAfwards I made a\nsudo - root\nchroot /tmp/xx\n\nI then made an\nsu - 'mynormalusername'\n\nfollowed by \nexport PATH=/sbin:$PATH\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nThis one halted at some point due to 'too many errors'. I tryed a couple of times but didn't seem to come any further so I tryed rebooting. And guess what, I can use my PC again.\n\nA: I had the same issue. It is likely that the upgrade was interrupted and hence did not complete (which was what had happened in my case as my system crashed during upgrade). At the command prompt, please type:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nIt will install the rest of the upgrades and once you reboot, the issues are resolved.\n", "Q: How to stop SSH filesystem from discarding root permissions after every command? i have a small bash script that mounts my sshfs...\nproblem is it ask for the server/host password for every mount...\ni have four mounts and i have to enter it every time for 4 times and its tiresome, also i want to make it mount at boot/login...\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsudo fusermount -u /mnt/ctb\nsudo fusermount -u /mnt/dtb\nsudo fusermount -u /mnt/etb\n\nsudo sshfs -o allow_other 192.168.1.10:/media/ctb /mnt/ctb\nsudo sshfs -o allow_other 192.168.1.10:/media/dtb /mnt/dtb\nsudo sshfs -o allow_other 192.168.1.10:/media/etb /mnt/etb\n\nafter every mount comman it ask me for the password of a user on the machine 192.168.1.10...\n\nA: You can try generating a ssh key with ssh-keygen on your client system, and place the .ssh/id_rsa.pub public key in .ssh/authorized_keys on the 192.168.1.10 system. \nSee How to harden an SSH server? for more info on this. \nAdd yourself to the fuse user group, if you haven't.

First go to the directory in which the script resides.  Do an ls -Ll <script> and confirm that script grants you execute permissions.  The Ll is upper and lower case \"el\", which give you permissions and traces a symlink in case the script is a link.  This guarantees you get the permission on the script and no accidentally the link.\nIf the permissions look right, then try running each script as a command by invoking it as ./<script>.\nIf that works, then it is not a problem with Ubuntu, the script executes correctly.  If it does not execute correct, please provide the permissions listing and the results of the id command so we can see what you are too.\nIf the script work from the command line, then it is your start.sh script that has a problem.  Have it echo the paths so you can see what is really being used.  Another approach to narrow down to the setting of paths is to hard code the explicit path in start.sh for each of the other scripts.  If that works, you are guaranteed the problem is in your start.sh scrip and how you determine the path.\nLast, I strongly recommend you adopt the following stype for variables in scripts, use ${variable} instead of $variable because adding the curly braces guarantees that other characters are not accidentally added to the variable name creating a new variable with no value.\n\nA: Perhaps your executable is 32-bit, and you don't have the 32-bit libraries installed.\nInstall them with:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n", "Q: ATI Driver not working after system update?

All I have are Facebook and Gmail setup in Empathy and neither of them work with this option.  Perhaps a standard Jabber server will work.  As for IRC not so much.\nFor IRC click Edit -> Account -> the + button to add a new account -> Jabber and change it to IRC, you can do freenode or you can click it and change to another IRC network, put anything you want in the IRC nickname box and click login.  One issue though, there's no way (that I know of) to list all channels (rooms) of a IRC network in Empathy.  You can join channels but you have to all ready know their names to enter them manually.\nOne option, if you want to chat with random people on IRC networks, is to use something like Xchat which you can find in the repo.  Depending on what you want to talk about will depend on the nature of the IRC network and the nature of the channels in that network.  Chatting on IRC is the only way I know of if you want to find random people to talk to and Empathy isn't something I would use for that.\n", "Q: Won't detect Seagate 2 TB USB 3.0 external drive So first I googled this question and I came up with this Ubuntu Forums thread.\nI did the things that the thread said to do like typing:\n\n\n*\n\n*lsusb\n\n*sudo fdisk -l\nThen I unplugged my device and plugged it back in and typed in:\ndmesg | tail\n\nlike the thread said to do.

I installed it as a combined frontend and backend. I ran through the configurations, accepting all defaults except for two items:\n\n\n*\n\n*I set the hostname to the server's IP\n\n*I checked the checkbox to enable network remote controls\n\n\nI then rebooted. When I try to connect via mythmote, I get \"connection refused\" and \"connection timed out\" errors. What I have done to diagnose the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Re-run configuration without changing any settings\n\n*Disable IPv6 (ala /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6)\n\n*Disable ufw\n\n*Run Wireshark, which reports that a TCP SYN arrives at the server, and the server sends a TCP RST in response. Prior to disabling ufw the server would not even send the TCP RST\n\n\nThe settings I have for mythmote are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Name: Gamma (this is my third server)\n\n*Address: 10.0.0.14\n\n*Port 6546\n\n*MAC: (Not filled in, I don't need WOL)\nIf I switch to a TTY on the server, I can telnet 127.0.0.1 6546 and get to the network remote control interface. If I try the same via telnet 10.0.0.14 6546 I get a connection refused.\n\nA: I just now found out (thanks to your sleuthing) that a temporary solution is to port forward with ConnectBot.\nPort Forwarding is a bit tricky, there's a menu entry, \"Port Forwards\", that shows up once you're connected. You should also be able to get to it by \"long pressing\" a host before you connect.\nThis Port Forward screen is empty. To add entries to it, press the menu button and click \"Add port forward\"\nOnce you have port forwarding setup, you'll need to modify the mythmote to connect to '127.0.0.1' now that you're actually connecting to the port on your android (that is a \"tunnel\" to the external host).\n\nEdit: since this post has gained some traction, let me consolidate:\n1) a simplier solution is to run sudo mythtv-setup as the user that runs mythtv. Then configure the backend address to be the external one.\nAlso note the following bugs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Proxy: http://code.mythtv.org/trac/ticket/10633 \n\n*IPv6: http://code.mythtv.org/trac/ticket/11030\n\nA: Can't say I have the same problem, however it seems similar:\nOn atom box running latest 12.04.1 ubuntu kernel.\nWhen boot up I exit frontend. and then go to control-centre. Open it and select Infrared control and remotes; I select Android and then apply - it says nothing to do (this is OK).\nI then leave control-centre in this state (it seems there is a bug as the code to wroite out the selection does not work).\nGoto menu and select front-end and wait for start. Select watch and away you go. Mythmote now connects!!!\n\nA: The other answer talked about port forwarding, but if that is tedious (it is for me), then you can actually fix the issue by reconfiguring mythtv.\nClose the mythtv interface, and open a terminal.\nRun sudo mythtv-setup as the user that normally runs the frontend.\nEnter General Configurations, and change the IP address to match the external, network IP address. In my case I set the ipv4 address, and left ipv6 blank.\nSince I have droidwall installed, I also had to make sure that mythmote was unblocked.\n\nA: Try setting the parameter NetworkControlEnabled to 1 for your FE node in mythweb and then restart mythfrontend. I just installed a fresh copy of mythbuntu 12.04 and this was set to 0 by default. \n\nA: Edit the /etc/mythtv/config.xml file...\nAfter the entry \"<\"Frontend\">\" add  (lose the quotes, I had to add them to have the brackets)\n\"<\"LocalHostName\">\"enter your local ip here\"<\"/LocalHostName\">\"\nI also added these commands as root:\niptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 6546 -i [+] -j ACCEPT\niptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 6546 -i use your ip here -j ACCEPT\nThen go to your frontend, and if you have the check mark for remote connections, uncheck, exit the frontend, restart the frontend, go back in, recheck the box, then exit the frontend, and restart, it should work.\nThe answer was on the MythTV website, they are using the config.xml file, which does not list a hostname on a frontend install, so you need to go in and ADD it otherwise the box only listens on the loopback address.  I have done this on 2 frontends so far, and worked both times, I have one more to attend to, but it uses a USB IR receiver, so I actually only need it to play blu-ray discs because the Vista remote won't hit the play button.\nBest of luck!!\n", "Q: How do I slow down the mouse cursor? I've been using Linux for over 10 years and just downloaded 12.04 to my wife's laptop. It looks good but I can't find a way to slow the cursor down (yes, I have gone to System Settings and they are as slow as possible). This is on a System 76 Pangolin laptop with the pad.\n\nA: If you're using a separate wireless mouse try unplugging the usb dongle and plugging it back in.  That has worked for me.\n", "Q: How can I change the icon for Jupiter? I installed Jupiter to try to improve my laptop's performance, and it's doing rather well :D\nHowever, I use the Radiance theme (white windows, white topbar, black indicator applets etc.) and Jupiter only has a white icon, so I can't really see it... Is there any way for me to change it?\n\nA: Jupiter uses icons from /usr/share/pixmaps/ directory. I've looked through the source code of \"Jupiter\" and I've found that icon names are hard-coded in application:\ndef update_icon(self):\n    m = self.jupiter.get_current_cpu_mode()\n\n    if m == 'high':\n        if loaded_indicator:\n            self.ind.set_icon('bolt1')\n        else:\n            self.tray.set_from_icon_name('bolt1')\n    elif m == 'powersave':\n        if loaded_indicator:\n            self.ind.set_icon('bolt4')\n        else:\n            self.tray.set_from_icon_name('bolt4')\n    else:\n        if loaded_indicator:\n            self.ind.set_icon('bolt2')\n        else:\n            self.tray.set_from_icon_name('bolt2')\n\nSo you can replace the following icons with what you like:\n/usr/share/pixmaps/bolt1.png \n/usr/share/pixmaps/bolt2.png \n/usr/share/pixmaps/bolt3.png  \n/usr/share/pixmaps/bolt4.png\n\nSurely you can change source code of \"jupiter\" :)\n\nA: I just created 3 icons by inverting the colors. Just extract the files in the archive to: \n/usr/share/pixmaps/\n\nYou need Superuser access to do this and you can download the files here.\n\nA: I've created some new icons here because I didn't like the bold design.\n", "Q: Cannot Upgrade to Kubuntu 12.04 As you know, Kubuntu 12.04 came out recently.

Thanks!\n\nA: Open sofware sources. click on Updates tab and then in release upgrade select Normal release release  \n \nThrn enter this into terminal and see what you get\nsudo do-release-upgrade -m desktop -f kde -d\n\nA: At this point, you don't need the -d on do-release-upgrade, because Precise is no longer a development version. \nFrom the terminal, sudo do-release-upgrade should be sufficient. \n", "Q: Why do my display settings say laptop when I'm using a desktop? I just upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04 today. I noticed that in display settings it recognizes my system as laptop and I am actually running a desktop with a viewsonic monitor. How can I fix this?\n\nA: This is a bug. You can confirm that your computer is not really being identified as a laptop by running:\nsudo laptop-detect -v\n\nTo help get this fixed, I suggest you update the bug report with further details, or log into Launchpad and register the fact that the bug also affects you:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-desktop3/+bug/970560\n", "Q: 12.04 runs my CPU up to 99% 12.04 runs my CPU up to 99% and then lags to the point of having to shut down the laptop to restart it manually.Why is my CPU running so high and what can I do to fix it?\n\nA: You should probably select the \"system monitor\" app, and go to the \"processes\" tab. There you can find what program is consuming your CPU. (My bet is on Compiz)\nNOTE: This does not mean select the program, then click \"end process\". That can be very dangerous, I know firsthand. \n\nA: Same thing here! What worked for me was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the culprit. Either from the system monitor as the previous post suggested or running \"top\" from the command line. In the system monitor you can order by CPU consumption. You may need to show all processes, in the \"View\" menu.\n\n*Kill/restart the process. In my case it was \"ubuntu-launcher\", and I only needed to kill it, as ubuntu-one was already running: from the system monitor, you can right-click in the process, and select \"End Process\".

When I updated to 11.04 I changed the desktop to Gnome, now with the new 12.04 I'd like to switch back to Unity.  How do I do this?\nThanks!\n\nA: I think it depends on how you switched it... Have you tried clicking the Ubuntu icon by the login name at the login screen, then switch it to \"Ubuntu\"? If you could explain how you \"changed the desktop to Gnome\" in the first place, maybe we could see about reversing that change.\n\nA: Well... I guess this is a problem a lot of people is experiencing.\nIn my own case, I had customized compiz settings previous to the upgrade. And after upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04 compiz started to fail... hence no Unity, no launcher, no menu, no window frames... etc.\nI assumed it was because of some personal compiz settings (although not sure which exact settings cause this), since I could login to the Guest account without problems, and there everything worked as expected.\nSo, I thought the only way to solve this was to reset compiz settings to defaults.\n\nA: I believe this has already been asked.\nHow can I switch between gnome-shell and unity without logging off?\nOpen a terminal and type:\nunity --replace\n\nA: just logout and select ubuntu on clicking setting icon and then login and you will have your unity environment set.

But when I restarted the system with static set, resolv.conf was empty. When I restart the system with DHCP set, resolv.conf has nameserver 192.168.1.1. So, it appears that the issue is that resolve.conf is not getting written to correctly? Which package/code is responsible for writing to resolv.conf?

Those are just my values from DHCP. I didn't bother to save the static config since I was just trying to illustrate what I was thinking.\nBy the way, I used 192.168.1.1 because that's what you were using. But you could also use the IPs for any valid DNS servers. For example, 8.8.8.8 and/or 208.67.222.222 should also work.\n\nA: If you don't want to (or can't) use the Network Manager applet to setup your network settings, I find the proper way to setup a \"static\" IP configuration, for when you don't have a DHCP server available, is to have a static lease on the dhclient.conf. There you should specify the nameserver that will be written to the resolv.conf file when dhclient falls-back to static.\nHowever, if you don't wan't to get your hands dirty, I still recommend to use the GUI to specify a DNS server address at your connection's IP settings, as in https://askubuntu.com/a/127537/33305.\n\nA: The OP is using the server ed. NetworkManager doesn't apply.. though who knows maybe it'll get added just to add complexity to the server. \nFor that matter why in the world did resolvconf get added to the server ed... WHY!!??!?\nAnyway to answer your question add in:\n/etc/network/interfaces \nsomething like this:\nauto eth0 inet static\n     dns-nameservers ns1.mydnsservers.com ns2.mydnsservers.com\n\nThe important option is \"dns-nameservers\".\n", "Q: Keyboard and mouse not working after upgrade \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat should I do when Ubuntu freezes? \n\nI just upgraded to 12.04.  Now, I can get into the desktop but after that point nothing works including keyboard and mouse. Therefore I am unable to use terminal.  What do I do to get it working again?\n\nA: If previous to the upgrade you had messed with compiz settings, I guess I (and many other people) have been into the same issue. Solve it by resetting compiz settings to defaults.\nI have an ATI Radeon HD5750, but I guess people with nVidia cards have also experienced the issue.\n\nA: You should try using another USB keyboard, as your existing keyboard may be the cause of problem. if even that does not work for you, re-install a fresh copy of 12.04 rather than upgrading.\nKindly describe specific problem you are facing. The more details you provide the more help you will get.\n", "Q: How to include locally build Python package system-wide? For example: I build numpy with Intel MKL libraries and it's available in Python shell, but if I want to install some package from repository that depends on numpy, my build is not considered.\nWhat would be easiest way to include my Python build package in Ubuntu, so that packages from repository can find it, preferably without building again?\n\nA: Use checkinstall to build a deb file and install it.\nCheckinstall will replace de 'make install' part of the standard compilation. Instead of just copying the files to their target directories it will build and install a deb file.\nIf you can't use checkinstall, you could create a dummy package using equivs. Note that this can create problems when updating or uninstalling and it's only recommended for expert users. It has a known tendency to grow out of control, so use it with care.\nInstall equivs:\nsudo apt-get install equivs\n\nCreate the control file:\nequivs-control python-numpy\n\nThis will create a template control file called python-numpy (the name doesn't matter)edit it python-numpy so it looks like this:\n### Commented entries have reasonable defaults.\n### Uncomment to edit them.\n# Source: <source package name; defaults to package name>\nSection: misc\nPriority: optional\n# Homepage: <enter URL here; no default>\nStandards-Version: 3.9.2\n\nPackage: python-numpy\nVersion: 9.9\n# Maintainer: Your Name <yourname@example.com>\n# Pre-Depends: <comma-separated list of packages>\n# Depends: <comma-separated list of packages>\n# Recommends: <comma-separated list of packages>\n# Suggests: <comma-separated list of packages>\n# Provides: <comma-separated list of packages>\n# Replaces: <comma-separated list of packages>\n# Architecture: all\n# Copyright: <copyright file; defaults to GPL2>\n# Changelog: <changelog file; defaults to a generic changelog>\n# Readme: <README.Debian file; defaults to a generic one>\n# Extra-Files: <comma-separated list of additional files for the doc directory>\n# Files: <pair of space-separated paths; First is file to include, second is destination>\n#  <more pairs, if there's more than one file to include.

I have only modified 2 fields:\n\n\n*\n\n*Package: The name of the package that you want to build. For a dirty solution use python-pynum\n\n*Version: Use a number high enough to keep apt-get from updating it.\n\n\nA better (but untested by me) solution could be to create a different package name, something link python-pynum-dummy, and use in the Provides line put python-numpy. This should be cleaner.\nFinally build the deb.\nequivs-build python-numpy \n\nAnd install it.\n", "Q: Is it normal for compiz to consume 40% of my CPU with no other programs running? When I have no other programs running, compiz takes up at least 40% of my CPU.\nIs this normal? If it is normal, is there anyway I could make this program take a smaller percentage?\n\nA: Edit: As of Ubuntu 12.10 this is no longer an option, as Unity-2D was dropped with quantal.\nI have the same issues with cpu usage because of compiz. My workaround was to switch session from Ubuntu to Ubuntu 2D. \n\n\nA: Had the same problem. Compiz constantly at around 40% (AMD CPU, ATI 58xx, 12.04). Then i followed this post https://askubuntu.com/a/127310/26508 and CPU utilization dropped below 10%. Hope it helps.\nEDIT with instuctions:\nJust backup (rename) ~/.compiz-1 and ~/.config/compiz-1 directories and let them to be created again with the default settings (you'll need to logout and login back again).\nmv ~/.compiz-1 ~/.compiz-1.BACKUP\nmv ~/.config/compiz-1 ~/config/.compiz-1.BACKUP\n\nAfter having restarted and confirmed that everything works as expected, you can simply remove these backups (unless you have a use for them).\nrm -Rfv ~/.compiz-1.BACKUP\nrm -Rfv ~/config/.compiz-1.BACKUP\n\nIt helps to do a unity --reset also\n\nA: *\n\n*Install compizconfig-settings-manager. Run it by typing ccsm in the dash.\n\n*In the application's main window, click on the bottom link with Preference label.\n\n*In the Profile tab, click on Reset to default button. \n\n*Logout and Login again.\nHope this will help\n\n\nA: apparently there is a bug with ATI card base on this site: http://followthegeeks.com/compiz-is-consuming-too-much-cpu-heres-the-solution/\nbased on that site there is a few step :\n\n\n*\n\n*install compizconfig-settings-manager  (CCSM)\n\n*navigate to opengl then change Texture Filter to Fast and uncheck sync to VBlank\n\n*close CCSM then restart ubuntu\n\n\ncheck in system monitor, hopefully compiz will not need a lot of CPU anymore.\n\nA: The new version of Compiz and the Unity plugin have major changes that make it behave differently. In my own case, I had to reset compiz settings to defaults in order to get it working appropriately after the upgrade to 12.04.\nI have an ATI Radeon HD5750 card, and I really noted a great performance improvement (after fixing compiz) compared to 11.10.\n\nA: I had the same problem that the CPU load went up to 70%~80% and that upset me for a long time after upgrading to 12.04 from 10.04. \nAnd reset compiz settings to default or remove the ~/.compiz-1 & ~/.config/compiz-1 folders didn't work. \nBut after I uncheck the \"Sync to VBlank\" box under OpenGL in ccsm (CompizConfig Settings Manager), the CPU load drop to 1% immediately.\nHope this will help you and other guys...\nSorry for my poor expression (I'm a student from china).\n\nA: I figured the same issue on ubuntu 15.04. My laptop was having lot of lag, and I saw that compiz was always up to 25% CPU load.\nI first searched around drivers but I finally found that compiz fall to 3% as soon as no webapp is opened.\nI used to use twitter and facebook with the native webapps (embeded in oxide).\nSince I just use firefox, compiz does not climb upper than 5% CPU.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: I figured out that on my laptop with NVIDIA 8600M GS graphics and proprietary nvidia-340 driver package, compiz was always using all the CPU it could get from a single core. With no other activity on my computer, this means a value close to 100% on one core, while the other takes care of all the other loads. Top also reports nearly 100% for compiz itself.\nOf course, it seems a single thread stays active, so on a quad core PC, you would get 25% load, and 16% on a 6 core i7.\nThe whole computer was sluggish to the point of lagging for text input.\nI ran \"pilotes additionnels\" (french language setting), the built-in ubuntu interface which installs proprietary driver, and I was offered a choice of NVIDIA driver versions, plus nouveau, the open source driver.\nAt the very end of the list, I noticed \"nvidia-340-update\", which is the same 340.96 proprietary NVIDIA driver, and I decided to give it a try. The 8600M GS is not supported in later driver releases. I let the installer compile everything, rebooted when asked to, and the high cpu usage from compiz was gone!\nIf it works for you, this solution fits the linux-restricted-modules infrastructure better than managing an NVIDIA driver manually. It replaces nvidia-340 by nvidia-340-update.\n", "Q: How to solve a split display using a Radeon HD Graphic card?

If errors are found, run apt-get clean as root and try again using apt-get directly.\n\n(fast in the first line is because I'm using apt-fast instead of apt-get)\n\nA: I disabled apt.conf's deb-src lines per mikewhatever's answer. This brought it down, as with you, to ~6MB.\nThen I noticed that when apt was getting the package info, it was going through 192.168.1.3—my squid-deb-proxy server (which runs 11.10; I haven't gotten around to upgrading it yet). Uninstalling squid-deb-proxy-client from the client brought the information download size back to normal.\nEDIT: Aaand it went back to its old behaviour. I also checked the virtual machine on my Mac (fresh install of stable release the day it came out) which I boot up every now and again; package update information is a big download on it as well. I'll leave this answer up simply to document that this solution doesn't work. Beyond that, I'm stuck.\n\nA: Perhaps the difference is the source packages. Try disabling them in the Software Sources window, or else, edit /etc/apt/sources.list, and comment out lines that start with deb-src, ...that is, if you don't need the source code.\n", "Q: Not able to see '/home' drive I have installed \"Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\" with 3 partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*/ drive for 100 GB\n\n*/home for 200 GB and\n\n*/swap drive for 8 GB\n\n\nBut after successful installation I'm not able to see /home drive . \nI can see only / drive. I want to keep my data's in /home drive [as like D: drive in windows] .\n\nA: If you've not started to really use it the simplest way to do this would be reinstall using the Something Else option at partition stage, editing partitions and choosing the correct mount points. \nOtherwise you'll need to copy data from the existing /home into the new partition.\nIf you want to just add the partition to /etc/fstab and have it mount that can be done.\n\nA: Ok first you need to make one thing clear: what utility/tool did you use to see what partitions you have?\nIf you are referring to Nautilus(the default file manager which opens your home folder/documents etc), then it would not show you the drives explicitly.\nJust to be sure, open your dash and search for system monitor\n\nand select the filesystems tab.\n\nif you see home here, that means your home partition is in use.so whatever files you put in your home folder[Desktop, pictures,videos and all other folders inside Home will go into your home drive]\n\nA: The windows concept of a \"drive\" does not exist on Linux systems. As you wrote, you mounted the 200GB partition you created under /home, and that is where it is located. There is no separate \"drive\" for that partition; instead, access to partitions happens transparently, i.e. every time you access something below /home, like /home/user/Desktop, you'll be accessing your 200GB partition. \nSo, if you really set it up like you said you did (you can use Sagar_R's answer to check that), everything is already as it should be.\n", "Q: Not getting boot loader screen to choose between Ubuntu and Windows 7 I was using 12.04 beta. I was asked by update manager to make required updates, which I did. I shut down my PC that night and the next day I was not able to boot into the graphical interface. After some attempts to fix it, I decided to remove beta and do a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04. \nI went into Windows 7, and in the disk management tool I deleted the Linux volume and swap volume. Then when I rebooted I was stuck with a grub rescue screen. I was not able to boot into Windows 7. I used boot-repair. I clicked on recommended repair and voila!! I got my Windows 7 back. So I decided to install Ubuntu 12.04 again. I did and when I rebooted I was not asked for OS options and was directly taken to Windows 7. I tried using this help wiki page to reinstall GRUB, but I am still not able to go into Ubuntu or get a boot loader screen. I guess my GRUB was messed up pretty badly when I deleted the Linux partition in the first place. \nWhat should I do now?\n\nA: Looking at bootinfo grab\n => Grub2 (v1.99) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sdc and looks at sector 1 of \n    the same hard drive for core.img. core.img is at t his location and looks \n    for (,msdos5)/boot/grub on this drive.\nso now you are having a windows loader in MBR of your primary hdd(sda) ;perhaps u can try making sdc as your primary disk and try a boot (settings to be done in BIOS).If your ubuntu install is proper u will get in to this only.But for dual boot u need to chainload one or other\noption1: u can use the windows loader to chainload grub using 3rd party softwares http://www.supergrubdisk.org/wiki/Howto_Boot_Grub_from_windows (Windows Vista (with easybcd help)\noption2:re-install grub to MBR of sda and do an os-probe to chainload windows7 \nHave your rescue-disks handy!!\n\nA: Moving comments to an answer:  \nGrub2 is installed to sdc not sda. if you want it to magically find, it needs to be on the drive your motherboard defaults to. This in most cases is sda.  \nUnder typical circumstances when installing grub2 it should be on /dev/sda.  \nYou can do this from a liveCD or using the boot repair disks you found.

This one adds some elaboration.\nWhen an instance of LibreOffice is running a hidden file is set.  This hidden file is called \".lock\", the \".\" indicates it is normally hidden from view.\nWhen you open a terminal window it will normally start in your home directory and will only show you files that have not been set to be hidden.  The home directory is the directory you \"own\" and normally operate within unless, of course, you assume the persona of the administrator or another user.  So if you type cd .config/libreoffice/3 it will take you to a directory folder, described by \"~/.config/libreoffice/3\"; the \"~\" indicating to the operating system you are referencing this command from the point of your home directory.\nWhen you arrive in the folder \"3\" you will not be able to see the \".lock\" file by typing a simple \"ls\" because, just like the \".config\" folder, the \".lock\" file is hidden from view.  To see it, type \"ls -al\".  This will reveal any hidden files in the listing.\nTo remove this file, once in the \"3\" folder, you type \"rm .lock\".  After that you might like to type ls -al just to be sure the \".lock\" file is no longer present.\n\nA: I had the same problem on Fedora 24 with LibreOffice 5.1.\nI had the same post, asking me to end the process on host such and such.\nI clicked yes on the prompt, this led me to the document recovery.\nI dicarded the recovery and LibreOffice worked again.\nI hope that solves the problem for good.\n\nA: this paragraph below help me much (I quoted from  ):\n\nWhen you open a terminal window it will normally start in your home directory and will only show you files that have not been set to be hidden.

Hope this helps!\n\nTo make the above process easier, the latest Ubuntu Tweak (0.7.1) can now enable and tweak metacity compositor settings.\nSee this article for more information.  http://www.webupd8.org/2012/05/ubuntu-tweak-071-available-for-download.html\n", "Q: how to remove tooltip message feature from all of Ubuntu 12.04 desktop and user applications?

I upgraded Ubuntu from 11.10 to 12.04, until which wireless was working just fine. After the upgrade and reboot, wireless is not even being detected (When I click the network manager icon in the top panel, it does not show the wireless networks. Neither the Enable wireless option is there). But my laptop's LED indicator shows wireless is on.\nThis is a Dell Vostro 3450 laptop with:\n\nBroadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01)** (from lspci). Is any other info needed?\n\nHow do I get Wifi working?\n\nA: I have a vostro myself. But a BCM43224. Maybe the solution does not fit for you. However this helped me out. \nSomehow the \"sta\" driver stopped working correctly. You need to install another driver. Before installing remove the following packages\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source broadcom-sta-common broadcom-sta-source\n\n(removing these was essential for me. Without I had massive connection problems with the b43 driver)\nAfterwards install the following packages\nsudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer\nsudo echo b43 >> /etc/modules\n\nthen reboot and check if your card is found.\n(You can try by hand without rebooting. If you currently use the wl driver execute\nsudo modprobe -r wl\nsudo modprobe b43\n\n)\nMore info, what helped me can be found here:\nhttp://www.linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43\nhttp://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/WLAN/Broadcom_bcm43xx\nAlternatively try the driver described here:\nhttp://www.linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/brcm80211\nthis one should support your chip.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I tried the \"b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer\" package solution given above. The wireless started working but its behaviour was very erratic. Wireless network wasn't turned on at startup and if I tried to turn on the interface without first manually turning on the device (ifconfig wlan0 up) the whole system used to freeze up.\nHence, I tried an alternate approach. I went into ubuntu's \"additional driver\" application. There I saw that the \"Broadcom STA proprietary driver\" was disabled. I unloaded the b43 module (Removed it from /etc/modules too). Connected to the net using a wired interface and enabled this driver. Its been running smoothly since. Hope this reply helps. \n\nA: My WiFi problem (explained here) is solved by installing broadcom-sta-common (on 12.04.2 LTS), then restart (not purging the package, as written in the first answer):\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y install broadcom-sta-common\nsudo reboot\n\nMy device is:\n$ lspci | grep BCM\n03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01)\n\n\nA: My Lenovo S10-3 Ideapad netbook also uses Broadcom BCM4313 wireless chip. When I did a 12.04 clean install, it identified the chip correctly even without activating the Broadcom STA driver. So I think the upgrading you did broke something along the way.\nOpen up the Additional Drivers (jockey-gtk) and see if the Broadcom STA driver is activated. Click the Activate button if it is not, be sure that you have an wired Internet connection on your system.\n\nA: Checking the links above, you need to check first which Broadcom firmware you are using. The drivers are very specific. In particular, noting the posts above, the BCM4313 chipset is NOT supported by the b43 drivers, and these require the STA driver.\n(I have a Dell Studio with BCM4313 wireless, that's how I know...).\n", "Q: Screen: Keep programs running after shutdown Is it possible to run screen on my linux box, and resume activites after shutting down?\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04 with all updates installed and Screen version 4.00.03jw4 installed from the Ubuntu repositories.\nIdeas are welcome.\n\nA: GNU screen looks like magic, but it cannot keep programs running when you shut down the machine. If you want a program like irssi (an IRC client) running even when the machine is shut down, you'll need a different machine that is powered on and to which you can connect using ssh.

I have added a PPA repository to my fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.04 with the Software sources menu item in the Ubuntu Software Center (USC). The problem is that the new repository is not immediately available. I can't find an option to refresh the software sources in the USC. I have tried to close the USC and reopen it, but no success.\nI don't know if this is a question of time (USC needs some time to refresh?), or if I'm doing something wrong.\nIn the meantime I had to install another software, so I have installed this one. At the end of the installation I have checked out again the software sources, and this time the new PPA repository was there. So, there is some kind of software sources refresh, but I don't know how to force it.\nThere is somebody else that had this issue?\n\nA: The software sources needs to be updated.

In Lubuntu 12.04 I have created a customised colour scheme (using LXAppearance) which uses orange for selected items instead of blue.  Many applications don't appear to use the custom colour scheme however.\nFor example, in the system tray, xfce4-power-manager uses blue to highlight its menu selections while Network Manager uses orange.  PCManFM uses orange to highlight selected files in the main window but blue in its menus.\nIs there any way to apply custom colour themes consistently?\n\nA: Short answer, no\nBecause, as you noticed, not all apps respect/use the system theme. This is not only about colors: other aspect of themes, like window decorators, are not used by all apps.\nFor example, take Chromium Browser, the free version of Chome. Notice how it's window borders and title bar are completely different from other apps. Chromium uses its own, custom widgets for its UI, and it's completely unaware of system theme.\nSo perhaps you're experiencing a similar issue with your apps. And unfortunately you cannot avoid id.

When installing/using Ubuntu, you are using Unity with the Gnome desktop. When you install Xubuntu, Xfce does not function the same as gnome. The Xfce developers have not written a function to show those partitions mounted in /etc/fstab on the desktop.

It would seem that GRUB is simply installed incorrectly.\nYou could first try opening a terminal and running sudo update-grub \nIf that doesn't solve the problem, run sudo grub-install /dev/sda (if you get an error, replace sda with hda), and then run sudo update-grub\n\nA: Looks like you installed grub record of the ubuntu 12.04 onto boot sector of that separate partition.\nIf I am correct, then you need to chainload the boot sector of that partition (with 12.04) from MBR of the disk.\nAdd to the end of /etc/grub.d/40_custom the following lines and run update-grub:\nfor ubuntu 12.04 on sda5\ntitle ubuntu 12.04\nroot (hd0,4)\nchainloader +1\nYou can also go without editing the grub files, by booting into grub menu and typing the chainloading instructions over there.\n", "Q: Instal Ubuntu to w2k machine I have a dilapidated PC at home i want to turn turn into a server (probably with debian on it in the end).

Look at this post internet access problem in 12.04 for the solution to that problem.\n\nA: Your IP address information appears to be correct, but I would verify that the router's address is actually \"192.168.1.1,\" as you have it listed (this is the Gateway address).  Some routers use 192.168.2.1, or some other 192.168.x.x address.  Also, if you have other machines on your network, and you have DHCP enabled on your router, you might already have another machine with the same address (192.168.1.2). This will prevent your connection from working properly.\nUnless you MUST have a static IP address, I recommend using DHCP, as this is the easiest way to set up your network properly.\n\nA: Check your configuration on router.your router to laptop connection is perfect, but due to wrong configuration it may not able to share internet to your laptop or pc.\n\nA: I had this exact problem. I edited the wired connection using the default GUI. Under IPv6 Settings, I set the Method to \"Ignore.\" This solved the problem.\n\nA: I had the same problem.

I have a \"multi-monitor\" system on my desktop. My main screen is connected via DVI (a Samsung Sync Master, 1680x1050) and the other screen is a LG Samsung (full hd 1920x1080) that is connected via HDMI. Both are in the same graphics card, a Asus Geforce GTX 550 TOP.\nThe problem is that I can't use them both as I use on Windows or on my netbook. My netbook (an Asus 1215P) automatic detects all kind of screens under the settings that come with Ubuntu 12.04 (I think in english is called Screens, not sure). On my desktop, those settings only show one screen and call it as a \"laptop screen\".\nI went to x server settings and my TV appeared there. I activated it, and set \"separate x screen\" (or something like that). I saved the settings and then I rebooted.\nMy TV screen was all grey and my mouse was a big \"X\". I couldn't move any window between screens.\nI went back to x server settings and activated Xinerama.

I've got a problem :) I'm living in Poland, so I want to write texts in polish with polish chars such as ąćęłńóśźż, too. Unfortunately, it's impossible. We write polish chars by pressing AltGr and chosen key (e.g.: AltGr + A = ą, AltGr + X = ź, AltGr + C = ć, etc.), but when I press AltGr, it isn't like pressing AltGr, it's like pressing Alt - I can open menus with their mnemonics, and I can't enter polish chars. I've got, of course keyboard layout set to Polish.\nAnd btw. - in Oneiric there was everything OK...\nSo my question is: how to fix it?\n\nA: Open \"System Settings\" and then \"Keyboard Layout\". Check that there is a Polish layout in the list of keyboard layouts on the left of the window. If there isn't, click the \"+\" button at the bottom left and add it.\nIf you have more than one keyboard layout added, you also need to check that you're currently using the right one. When more than one keyboard layout is added, a keyboard symbol with a two letter country code should appear in the bar at the top of the screen. Click this icon and select the polish layout. The icon in the bar should then show the letters \"pl\" next to the keyboard symbol.\nBy adding a polish layout to my settings, I can type ą, ź and ć without a problem.\nFrom the \"Keyboard Layout\" settings page, you can also check that the selected layout is as you expect. With the polish keyboard layout selected, click the small keyboard icon at the bottom left of the window. This should show you a diagram of your keyboard showing which letter can be typed with which key.\nCheck that the Polish characters are where you expect them to be and that the AltGr key is labelled something like \"Level3 ...\"\n\nA: If you are just interested in writing Polish letters on websites, use this Firefox extension tool:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polski-domek-toolbar/\n\nA: If you already have installed Polish language pack, try Super+Shift+Space or Super+Space. \nThis would switch current keyboard layout if there's more than one installed. \n", "Q: Need to repair or reinstall Ubuntu 12.04 without losing programs or data I was trying to change the ownership on an external drive, and mistakenly used \nsudo chown -RL myuser:myuser /media/\"New Volume\"\n\nUnfortunately, it changed the ownership on the entire drive to myuser.

It wiped out most of my third party programs (read as Google Chrome and a few others), but kept some of them (Skype, XBMC, etc).  \nI agree about the complete reinstallation in most (almost all) circumstances. In my specific case, my problem was that I took ownership of / and all of it's subdirectories. So, I didn't need a complete reinstallation--only a repair of the permissions and ownerships. The only \"easy\" way I saw was to try the 'Something Else' option.\nIn my specific case, it wasn't a fear of losing data--only having to reinstall all of my programs and settings.  Knowing the steps that you suggested from dpkg makes that a lot easier.\nI'm joining the call to make a \"Repair Installation\" option (or disc) for Ubuntu (and linux in general).

As long as \nI am using the proprietary drivers, I get stuck at the \"black screen\" during boot. \nTo \"solve\" this: \n1) Ctrl + Alt + F1 to open the terminal and loggin.\n2) Navigate to the configuration file's directory (in my case \"cd /etc/X11\")\n3) delete the ACTIVE configuration file \"sudo rm xorg.conf\" \n4) \"sudo reboot\" \nThis will solve your black screen problem for sure.

It was working great with the ubuntu 10.04 netbook edition, really fast boot very eficient but I have updated to 12.04 (the netbook edition doesn't exist anymore) and now the system is so slow: slow boot, sometimes it doesn't even boot properly, strange screen light on and off behaviour, when you click on an icon takes for ever to open the app even the terminal it takes like more than 10s! It seems that this new distro was made for a far more powerful systems than this netbook.\nI am considering to revert back to 10.04 or choose another linux distro but is there anythhing i can do to fix these problems? Any body else had similar problems. Thanks in advance\n\nA: I would suggest that you try installing the \"Gnome\" package from the Ubuntu software centre, this means that you will be able to to choose to boot into \"Gnome Classic\" at login where you will be presented with the traditional Gnome 2.x UI found in Ubuntu 10.04. This seems to make my netbook run faster than with Unity (I even wrote an article about it on my blog here, when it was still in beta)\nAlthough I still use Unity 3d with my netbook as I LOVE unity.\nIf you still want to experience Unity but can't live with the speed that your getting try logging in to \"Unity 2d\" as this will put less strain on your processor. Or another option would be to upgrade your RAM as this will also improve Unity's performance.\n\nA: An option could be to install Lubuntu, which is a recent variation of Ubuntu, using the lightweight window manager LXDE and a selection of lightweight software.\n\n\n*\n\n*Official website\nBut if you want to enjoy Unity with all its new capacities, you can also upgrade your RAM. I own a Samsung N310, and had difficulties with Unity in 12.04 until today, as I upgraded my RAM from 1 GB to 2 GB. It is extremely easy to replace your RAM card with a new one, which should cost you between 20 and 40 AU$, depending on where you buy it (online or your local IT shop).\n\n\n*\n\n*A video showing you how to upgrade the RAM for N150\n\n*An example of new RAM you can get for this Netbook\nI can tell you that I really notice the difference. Before, it was struggling with LibreOffice, Nautilus and Firefox together, but at the moment for example it can handle 6 apps at the same time without slowing down.\nFinally, Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal (supposed to be released in October 2012) will get rid of Unity 2D and have a lone version of Unity that won't need 3D acceleration to work flawlessly, so hopefully this next version of Ubuntu will be easier to run on old computer and low specs devices like netbooks!\n\nA: You will find that by default composite is on so unless you have one the newer dual core Intel netbooks you are kinda stuck.\nIf looking for alternatives and still want to go with the 12.04 LTS releases then try Xubuntu or Ubuntu Studio. I tried the beta 2 of Ubuntu studio and it uses the XFCE desktop and this will run even on the older i830 Intels.\nFrom my experience Unity 2D is not quite up to scratch, but if you'd like to experiment with if you can select that from the login screen (to switch between different desktops).\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but as I have the exact same netbook and the exact same problem, I feel like I should answer anyway.\nI really loved the ubuntu netbook remix, and I was very sad when I had to upgrade. The new Unity just didn't feel right, as you said it felt slow, and also big and clumsy. I really liked the layout and workflow of the netbook remix.\nI was already familiar with lubuntu, but I don't quite think it's ready for everyday use. Yes it's amazingly small and fast, but it still seems to lag behind the more performance hungry competitors in terms of usability. I often have to use the command line in order to do stuff that should be really simple.\nEnough bad things said about other desktop managers. What I ended up choosing, was xfce (xubuntu). I know someone else mentioned it, but I think it deserves more credit. I was really skeptical at first, because last i tried it, it had the same issues as lxde (fast but not very user friendly), but having read a really positive review on deoimedo, I felt like I should give it a new try.\nIt was everything I could have hoped for, and more. The customization tools are just awesome. I was able to mold it into something extremely similar to the netbook remix. That is, the panels are shrinkable, movable and custimizable in every way. Text on the taskbar buttons can be disabled to save space like in the netbook remix.\nI also got a lot of stuff that I missed on the netbook remix, like several work spaces. The only thing that's missing, is the menu that used to be where the desktop is, and the window border doesn't integrate with the taskbar like on the old unity.\nThe performance and snappiness also felt better than on the netbook remix. And in terms of usability, everything is just great, I still haven't had to use the command line for anything that should be simple.\nSo in my opinion, xubuntu is both faster, and has better usability than the netbook remix.\n\nA: Unity 3D seems to be the culprit.  I am running 12.04 in VM Ware and it was slow as heck until I signed in to Unity 2D.  Save 3D for real hardware.\n", "Q: How do I fix a \"E: impossible to read the sources list.\" error?

(Following this guide: http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/11/vsftpd-setup/)\n\nA: The problem is because you have two conflicting pieces of software installed; 'vsftp' and 'vsftp-ext'.\nFirst you need to remove the version installed by apt-get. Open a terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get remove vsftpd\n\nThis will remove the version of vsftpd installed by apt-get.

Install then start \"CompizConfig Settings Manager\"\nb. Navigate to \"Desktop\" -> \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\" -> \"Experimental\" tab\nc. Find the string \"Launcher Reveal Pressure\"\nd. The default is 20, change it to 8 (or whatever you prefer)\ne. You don't have to close CCSM to apply the changes. Keep changing the value till you are satisfied with the result, then close CCSM.\n\nA: There appear to be several changes in the autohide feature in 12.04, at least as it works on my desktop system which uses a 1920x1080 monitor in portrait mode.  I am using the 3D Unity implementation, with a low end ATI graphics card.\n1) In a fresh install, autohide is turned off.  New Ubuntu users will probably not even realise that the autohide function exists, unless they are shown by someone, or stumble across the setting in the Appearance panel.  \n2) With autohide on, when no programs are running, the launcher is hidden.  This is a change from previous versions, which showed the launcher when nothing was running.\n3) My experience about how autohide works seems to be different than that of a couple of other posters.  On my system, autohide is responsive not to how far you move the cursor, but to how fast the cursor is moving when it is beyond the left edge of the screen.   A slow long movement a long way past the screen edge creates a gray flicker at the screen edge as if the launcher is just on the verge of showing itself.  It takes rapid movement to make the launcher show.  In practice, I need to jerk or snap the cursor past the left edge of the screen to reveal the launcher. \n4) The range of sensitivity available for autohide isn't big enough.  Even turned up to high, I have trouble generating enough cursor velocity to get the launcher to activate.  \n\nA: For me it work very well. You have to \"push\" the mouse arrow to the left side of the screen to show the launcher. And you can set up the sensitivity how hard you have to push. That's a really nice solution, because it was always annoying that the launcher shows up when you just scratch the left border of the screen. Especially when I try to hit the Back button of Firefox.\nYou should spin the mouse over the left side (like to go over left border of screen)... and the launcher magically will appear...\n\nA: Is your Launcher configured to auto-hide? Because in Ubuntu 12.04LTS, that behaviour has changed slightly. You now have to press the pointer \"out of the screen\" in order to display it. That is; if you move your pointer against the Launcher, you'll see a shadow appear along its edge. If you continue pressing it, then the shadow grows and the launcher appears. \nIt is designed this way in order to minimize the number of times it appears when you really wanted to use the back-button in Firefox, or something like that. The behaviour is configurable, and you can choose how sensitive the launcher should be in System Settings > Appearance > Behaviour. \n\nA: Can you try:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I change the Unity launcher delay?\n\nA: It's working fine. In 11.x, the launcher revealed on touching the left display border for a length of time. In 12.04 this behavior is changed; the launcher reveals when you \"push\" the mouse against the left-most edge for a certain mouse distance. Unity designers changed this because the old method lead to annoying accidental launcher reveals, for example when reaching for the browser back button. The \"shadow\" your seeing indicates how far you've pushed against the display border.\nThe launcher's sensitivity (that is, how far you need to push) can be configured at System Settings > Appearance > Behavior > Reveal sensitivity. At its highest level of sensitivity, the Unity launcher acts functionally identical to its predecessors in 11.x.\n\nA: The likely issue here can be corrected in ccsm. Go to the Desktop section and select Ubuntu Unity Plugin. Make sure Enable Ubuntu Unity Plugin is checked. If you still have trouble with autohide showing up, check out the experimental tab. I fixed this on my system by some of the settings there to the default, although I am uncertain which one fixed it. Reveal pressure seems to be a likely candidate.\n\nA: I had a little trouble with this using various sensitivity levels but it seems to be related to the speed at which you try to move the cursor out of the screen.\nIf I casually move over the edge then nothing happens. But if I move out quickly and with purpose then I can get to the panel. Once I realized that it just took 60 seconds of practice to get the knack.\n\nA: I have a similiar issue with dash auto-hide but a bit different from those presented here. \nI have autohide enabled, and dash autohide works well most of the times, but now and then, the autohide stops working, and the dash is always present.\nI go to system settings, and confirm that autohide is enabled.\nI then disable the autohide, enable it again, and still autohide doesn't work.\nDoes anyone have the same problem? Is this a known bug?\n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Auto-hide launcher \"ON\"\n\n*Sensitivity \"High\"\n\n*After the launcher has hidden, hit the left side of the screen with the pointer, and drag it down against the edge.  The launcher will pop up.\n\n\nHopefully this will be fixed by the good folks at Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Mount NFS share as a shortcut I recently purchased a Netgear ReadyNas and have a question about mounting an NFS volume. Firstly I know how to mount the share in fstab. There is a lot of information around that describes how to do that. I really don't want to do that. \nWhat I want to do is have a shortcut or launcher that I can execute which will mount the nfs share for me (for example mounting it to ~/music). When I plug in a usb drive xubuntu automatically puts a drive icon shortcut on my desktop and allows me to 'eject'. Is this possible? Does it make sense? \nI am using xubuntu 11.10.\nI have been doing research to solve this problem and I have come up with two possibilities: \n1) Create a shell script or \n2) AutoFS. \nI am not sure which is better. I am more comfortable with shell scripting than AutoFS. The problem with the shell scripting is that I'll need sudo permissions. What I have read about AutoFS it might be the best solution. Is there a way to setup AutoFS so that I can keep the configuration files within the users home folder? \n\nA: I'm using Autofs for my NFS network, see this answer.\n\nNote that :\nautofs is a program for automatically mounting directories on an as-needed basis. Auto-mounts are mounted only as they are accessed, and are unmounted after a period of inactivity. Because of this, automounting NFS/Samba shares conserves bandwidth and offers better overall performance compared to static mounts via fstab.\n\nI've used an admin account to configure it, and I use it every day with a normal account.\n1st you need to setup your Netgear ReadyNas to act like a server. ( I can not describe this part).\nThen I suppose you can setup Autofs like this: \n\n\n*\n\n*install Autofs\n$ sudo apt-get install autofs\n\n\n*create the folder used to mount the connection with your Netgear ReadyNas\n$ sudo mkdir /media/shareFolder\n\n\n*set autofs to automatically mount this folder, \nin /etc/auto.master add this line:\n/media/shareFolder /etc/auto.nfs --ghost, --timeout=60\n\nin /etc/auto.nfs  add this line\nNetgear -fstype=nfs,rw,intr,uid=1001,guid=1001   192.168.1.?:/home/something\n\nwith:\n192.168.1.? is the address of your Netgear ReadyNas \n/home/something is the folder shared on  your Netgear ReadyNas\n1001 is the normal user (without admin privilege) and group ID. To find it $ id {your normal logon}\n\nResult should be that your /home/something from your Netgear ReadyNas is mounted in /media/shareFolder/Netgear\n\nA: Just create your own script nfsmount.sh and then create a shortcut to it.\nTip: Mount it to /media/something not to /mnt if mount to /media it will be displayed in nautilus and launcher. And then create a link from /media/nfsmusic to /home/hhlp/music.\n", "Q: error: invalid arch independent ELF magic. dual boot with SSD \nPossible Duplicate:\nGRUB: “invalid arch independent ELF magic” after install on SSD \n\nI am currently trying at get a dual boot computer to work, where the Ubuntu 12.04 operating system is spread over two drives.\nThe setup of the two drives are:\nHDD:\n/dev/sda1 /boot/efi\n/dev/sda2 some unknown msftres at 128MB (don't bother about this as long as the rest works)\n/dev/sda3 Windows 7\n/dev/sda4 /home\n/dev/sda5 swap\n/dev/sda6 /tmp\n/dev/sda7 /var \nSSD:\n/dev/sdb1 / \nIn an attempt to combine speed with SSD durability.

Is there an application for Ubuntu 12.04 to direcly convert an ogv video exceeding 200 MB into an wmv video possibly with a simple GUI (no terminal, no scripts). Is there such an application for multiple conversions? I tried to employ DivX but I was not able to make a check because the lower part of the DivX window was out of the screen of my netbook. Many thanks in advance and best regards. \n\nA: If you are happy to use FFmpeg, and yes this is command line not gui, one suggested command line to produce a wmv files that should play on a lot of devices and platforms is:\nffmpeg -i input.ogv \\\n       -c:v wmv2 -q:v 4  \\\n       -c:a wmav2 -b:a 128k \\\n       output.wmv\n\nYou can experiment a little with the quality settings for the wmv2 video, decreasing to 2 will get better quality and increasing above this will get progressively lower quality. With the bitrate settings for the wmav2 sound increasing the bitrate may get you better quality sound. All of this depends a lot on the quality of the input audio and video streams. \nTo run this command on multiple streams you would need to construct a for loop and this would be easy enough to demonstrate if you are happy with the suggested encoding syntax.\n\nA: WinFF \n is a GUI for the command line video converter, FFMPEG. It will convert most any video file that FFmpeg will convert. WinFF does multiple files in multiple formats at one time. You can for example convert mpeg's, flv's, and mov's, all into avi's all at once.\n\nA: Try the  Mobile Media Converter. It will also convert almost any video that FFMPEG supports, plus it can convert almost any video MENCODER supports. It has a really simple GUI.\n\n", "Q: How to remove/delete Podcast feed in Rhythmbox? What can I tell you, I don't really know how to expand on the title.

Touchpad left click, right click is working well, but tap... Did u guys experience the same problem? Is there something related to sensitivity? how to fix it?\nThanks\nEDIT: Need help !!! It is really annoying \n\nA: It seem to be just a synaptics driver configuration, I solved by adjusting the FingerLow and FingerHigh values with sinclient. See your current configuration with synclient, here is my console output\n$ synclient | grep FingerHigh\n    FingerHigh               = 30\n$ synclient | grep FingerLow\n    FingerLow               = 25\n\nI change the FingerLow value to 35, and FingerHigh value tu 40 and it works better! Try:\n$ synclient FingerHigh=40\n$ synclient FingerLow=35\n\nThe values were determined experimentally. To make the configuration permanent I created the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf with the following content\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"touchpad\"\n    Driver \"synaptics\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n    Option \"FingerHigh\" \"40\"\n    Option \"FingerLow\" \"35\"\nEndSection\n\nRegards!\n\nA: Same problem here with my Tecra R840 with Alps touchpad. It's definitely a regression in 12.04. It can slightly be diminished by changing the values of HorizHysteresis and VertHysteresis via synclient (see synaptics manpage). But the problem still exists.\nAnd yes, it really is very annoying and the reason why I don't use this machine with Ubuntu.\n\nA: You may want to try entering \"synclient\" in the terminal to see what your FingerHigh & FingerLow values are. In my case, the movement was occurring with taps being recognized as released too early. You can see explanations of the different synclient values here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man4/synaptics.4.html\nNote that FingerLow can't be set higher than FingerHigh, so both will have to be changed as you adjust FingerLow. I used FingerLow=55 & FingerHigh=60, which eliminated the issue for me. If this fixes the malfunction, you will need to create an executable script to run at startup and resume, because the changed settings do not persist due to a bug (which supposedly has been reported on Launchpad). I'm still working on making scripts to run at the right time, if anyone has input. Hope this helps!\n\nA: I had a similar problem on my Toshiba Satellite and followed the above instructions. However, 35-40 didn't help and 55-60 was too much and the touch pad wasn't responsive at all.

Open a terminal and paste this: \nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub \nHit Enter. It will open grub preferences in Gedit.\n\n*Locate the line # GRUB_GFXMODE=800x600 (resolution may be different). \n\nYou have to change the resolution to actual resolution of your screen,\n  for example mine is 1240x1024. Next step is to uncomment this line\n  (remove the # and and the empty space if is, so the letter G of the\n  word GRUB will be the first letter in this line). After u r done, save\n  the file and close.\n\n3 . Now paste this line in terminal: \nsudo gedit /etc/grub.d/00_header .\nHit Enter. It will open a text file with a lot of stuff. Use the search option at the top of the window to locate this line: \nset gfxmode=${GRUB_GFXMODE} \nAfter you successfully find it, you will have to add this line: set gfxpayload=keep just under the . Make it look like this:\nset gfxmode=${GRUB_GFXMODE}\nset gfxpayload=keep\n\nNow, save the file and close.\n4 .

When the launch bar is hidden, I have trouble getting it to slide out when I move the mouse pointer to the left side.  After adjusting the settings under Settings--Appearance--Behavior, the bar no longer hides when a browser is open.  Is there a fix for this.  This all happened when I was looking for a way to change the icon sizes in the launch bar. Documentation from Linux.com told me to do it under Settings--Appearance, but there was no way to do it.  Any help is appreciated!  Thanks.\n\nA: If you just want to reveal the Unity launcher with less trouble: increase the sensitivity under the Behavior tab of the Appearance window. You can find this, by clicking the cogwheel button from the top panel, click on System Settings... → Appearance → Behavior tab. From there adjust the reveal sensitivity.\n\nSuper is the keyboard shortcut to reveal the launcher and allows you to hit a number key to start an application.\nThe Superkey (Windows key, next to the left Alt) will reveal the launcher and you can get to the Dash from there where you can type in Appearance and start the app.\n\nA: Possibly a bug.\nTo customize ubuntu dash and other things install MyUnity \nSee the screen shot, from my system\n\n\nA: Even the highest sensitivity won't help.\nWhen you put your cursor at extreme left of the screen you also need to move your cursor vertically up or down. That makes it slide out quickly.\nCheers!\n\nA: Try this.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\ngconftool-2 --type int --set /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/launcher_hide_mode 2\n\n\nA: Maybe I need to start another question, as I am experiencing exactly the same problematic behaviour, but all I did is turned Auto-hide option to On position.\nDuring and after install Auto-hide was off. So after upgrade installation I went to System Settings -> Appearance -> Behavior -> Auto-hide the Launcher turned to On, it disappeared, as it should, but it became really hard to get back!\nSometimes it goes up instantly, sometimes you just need to hold your mouse for several (10-20) seconds at the very left position, sometimes it does not appear no matter how long you hold, sometimes you need to click some new location (like browser's location bar) after which it would become to function normal until you would click somewhere else.\nBut now it seemed to be totally chaotic and the only guaranteed way to fire it up is by pressing the \"Windows\" button which also initiates Search and is not an instant as I would like it to be.\nI am searching the solution for each day already, wanted to start a new topic, but seems like this is the appropriate one, correct me if it's no.\nPS. I have also tried this command from the last answer\ngconftool-2 --type int --set /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/launcher_hide_mode 2\n\nBut it made absolutely no effect.\nI have also tried to move up/down while keeping the pointer at the very left, increasing the sensitivity to the max in settings - all still does not allow me to pass though the moments, when I can't get it out at all and this moments happen very often!\nAfter playing some more with it, I have found a workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to rapidly move your mouse to the left and back for the several times, until the bar would appear! This solves the situation when otherwise without knowing this \"trick\" I would have given up and pressed the \"Windows\" button.\nThis method seem to work always, not totally confirmed of course and still buggy enough!\n\n", "Q: Live CD 12:04 keeps running - No Welcome Screen I downloaded the 32 bit iso file for the new Ubuntu 12.04 and burned a cd.

Upgrating from 11 to\n12 does work without any problems but I want to install from scratch.\nWith best regards,\nEdwin\n\nA: Do you see anything at all when booting to the cd? Did you try hitting ESC right when it starts up? Also, maybe you could try the alternate non-graphical installer. Other than that, maybe it's an acpi issue, or something that's plugged into your computer? If it's an acpi issue, you can temporarily get around that by either setting the f6 option to acpi=off, or if the option exists in the BIOS, you can turn it off there.\n\nA: This happened to me as well, and if you see a purple screen (seemingly blank) try hitting F6 and it will direct you to a menu. I don't know why that works, but that's what works for me. \n", "Q: Launcher shows up on the wrong monitor I have nvidia drivers and dual monitors. \n\nIt worked fine in 11.10 but since todays updates, my unity \"launcher\" is only on right monitor.\n\nOn vanila ubuntu display settings it recognizes only one monitor. And it looks like this:\n\nSo, the questions might be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why Ubuntu's \"Displays\" shows only one monitor where nvidia drivers shows two? I assume nvidia overwrites?\n\n*After Lot of playing between these two settings, I can't manage to move menu launcher to left screen. Any suggestions?\n\n\nA: Maybe it's a bug. Have you tried the Ubuntu2d setting on the Ubuntu button at login?\n\nA: As a workaround, you could try physically plugging the monitors into the opposite ports on your video card.\n\nA: I had the same issue and what solved it for me was first selecting the left screen in the 'X Server Display Configuration' and setting the position to 'Right of'.\nThis resulted in the launcher at the correct position on the virtual desktop but with my displays physically swapped, so I simply physically plugged the monitors in the opposite ports of my video card.\nI guess the bug is that the launcher is always displayed on the monitor that is physically plugged in in the first port of the video card, ignoring the position you configured in the Nvidia tool.\nI hope this works for you.\n\nA: I'm facing the same bug (I think it is).\nOS: Ubuntu 12.04\nGraphic Card: GeForce 310M\nOn dual monitor configuration the unity launcher is on right (wrong) screen.\nI tentatively solve this by setting the primary monitor's position to Right of and then setting it back to Absolute.\nI do this on every reboot (!).\nFurthermore I set this via gconf-editor:\n/apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/num_launchers=1\n\nThis forces the launcher to appear in only one monitor (otherwise for me it appears on both)\nNaver had problems with Ubuntu 11.04\nHope this helps.\nEdit: \nActually I use to set both monitor to Absolute with the right one positioned from the pixel width of the left one.\nSo, in my case:\n1366x768  Absolute +0+0 Primary\n1280x1024 Absolute +1366+0\n\n\nA: I think it's because of your configuration. If you select \"twinView\" in nvidia-settings, for gnome displays tool it's like there's just one gigantic display. \nTry the \"separate x screens\" option in nvidia-settings.\n\nA: It appears this was a bug in Unity. \nI've update last week and tried again, problem is fixed. \nThanks for all answers!\n\nEdit:\nAfter reading few comments, It seems I just got lucky, people still have same problem that I had.\nInteresting thing is that I've changed computer and graphic card since I asked the question and it's still fixed for me :(\n", "Q: Is this temperature normal for i5 cpu?

I was trying to avoid putting the entire file on my computer.  \nHow do you burn from internet Ubuntu page onto the disc.

But you can boot into the LiveCD, then use gparted to shrink your windows 7 partition, and then reboot into windows 7 to make sure it's clean. Then you can reboot to the LiveCD and install Ubuntu. If windows 7 craps out on you from changing the partition size. You can fix the boot repair process with the free CD downloads from: http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/ .

Then I just added there :\nacpi=noirq\n\nBut take care, maybe you have qwerty keyboard instead  of azerty one (like me) so press [q] instead of [a]...\nThen, press [ctrl]+[x] to execute this command line.\n2/ Now you should be able to log in.\n3/ To keep this modification once for all, you should edit the grub command. Execute this in a terminal :\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nAnd modify the line :\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nIt to obtain this line :\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"acpi=noirq quiet splash\"\n\nThen, save, close, and back in the terminal, execute :\nsudo update-grub\n\nNow restart your computer, and all should be great...

But if I try to play them, I get error saying so and so file (song) doesn't exist. This happens everytime. Why is this happening? Is it because this is over windows installation? What might be the exact reason? And how to avoid this?\n\nA: This happens to me all the time with Rhythmbox and Banshee. It seems the problem is caused because music is stored in windows partitions. Installing ubuntu on a separate partition and storing all your music there would be the solution. \nHope this helps :)\n\nA: Try downloading PySDM. It's a graphical storage device manager. You can set it up so ubuntu  auto-mounts the windows partitions you select. Select the partition, open the assistant (it's right there, on the right when you select a partition) and on the Mounting tab, check \"The file system is mounted at boot time\" and uncheck \"Mount file system in read only mode\".

On my new PC something is wrong with ACPI support under Linux. I have to boot it with acpi=off and nolapic. Also it detects only one CPU core (this annoys me the most) and won't shut down completely, I have to hold power button for few seconds to power PC off.\nThe question is: what can I do? Edit some config files? Report bugs? Send mails to motherboard manufacturer? Run some utility to help reverse-engineer drivers? (Currently I just turn AMD C1E off in BIOS. It's a nice workaround.)\nMy configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 (upgraded from 11.10)\n\n*Processor AMD FX(tm)-4100 Quad-Core\n\n*RAM 8,00 GB\n\n*Graphic Gigabyte GV-N56GOC-1GI (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560)\n\n*Mainboard Gigabyte GA-870A-USB3\n\n*Disk ATA OCZ-AGILITY3 (SSD)\n\n\nA: I suggest you start by trying to follow the steps in this guide: DebuggingACPI. \nThe description at the top of that page says it is part of Debugging Central, \"pages with debugging details for a variety of Ubuntu packages\" on the Ubuntu Community Wiki.\nYou should also try looking at the entries in /var/log/syslog to see if anything there  will help isolate the problem. \nMake sure the portion of the log you look at is from a failed boot. That is, the log entries should be from a boot where neither acpi=off nor nolapic were used. The log timestamps should allow you to determine which boot a log file entry is from.\nIf you find it easier to use a GUI application, Ubuntu has a Log File Viewer which you can use. It can be found by searching for it using Dash. \nThe steps below are (pretty much) copied from the DebuggingACPI page and are what I suggest you do to try to isolate the problem before filing a bug report. (I believe the procedures for reporting a bug are also on the DebuggingACPI page)\n\nIf acpi=off allows the system to boot, try to isolate the ACPI issue with the following boot parameters. Remove acpi=off and boot with only one of the options below.\nIf you are lucky, you might find a combination of kernel parameters which allows you to boot and use all the cores of your CPU.\nNote: If you need an explanation of to how to do a \"one time\" change of the kernel boot parameters/options, try this answer to the question \"How do I add a kernel boot parameter?\".\n\n\n*\n\n*Try booting with acpi=ht\nThis disables all of ACPI except just enough to enable Hyper Threading.\nIf acpi=off works and acpi=ht fails, then the issue is in the ACPI\ntable parsing code itself, or perhaps the SMP code.\n\n*Try booting with pci=noacpi\nThis disables ACPI for IRQ routing and PCI scanning.\n\n*Try booting with acpi=noirq\nThis disables ACPI for IRQ routing.\n\n*Try booting with pnpacpi=off\nThis disables the ACPI component of the Linux Plug and Play code.\n\n*Try booting with noapic\nDisables the IO-APIC for IRQ routing or PCI scanning.\n\n*Try booting with nolapic\nDisables the local APIC.\n\n\n\n\nA: There is a better workaround than disabling ACPI (by using acpi=off and nolapic). You can just turn AMD C1E off in BIOS!\nIt still is an issue though...\n", "Q: How do you get permission to save rcS after setting UTC=no? I am a first time user of Ubuntu.

It used to remain connected for as long as there was signal, but now I get periodic disconnects which appear very random and without a defined cause.\nI have attached an image (below) of a signal graph (graphed by iwScanner) which shows how signal is relatively stable but it is somehow lost momentarily and quickly regained.\n\nYou can see how there are short interruptions in the signal that cut the connection, which I assure you, are not caused by my router.\nMy network card is a Broadcom Corporation BCM4312 802.11b/g LP-PHY (rev 01), in case it is relevant.\nADDENDUM I\nTest information\nI had thought that the cause of this problem was either my network management application or the wireless card driver, so I decided to find out and tried the following configurations:\n\n*\n\n*wicd with my same wl driver. This does not fix the problem, the behavior stays the same.\n\n*wicd with the b43 driver. With this configuration, I can't even connect to internet - wicd reads no networks in range.\n\n*nm-applet with b43 driver. This does not fix the problem either.\n\n(My original configuration was nm-applet with the wl driver)\nAlso, I think the wl driver is also called sta.\nBecause of the outcome of this tests, I would conclude that the problem is not in the network management application nor in the driver. Where else could it be?\n\nA: Disable IPv6\nPossible answer\nBy the question's author, credit for user Captine.\nI noticed this question on the Related sidebar, and one of its answers seems to solve my problem: Disabling IPv6 connectivity.\nI have set the Network Manager applet to ignore by all means IPv6, but perhaps what was causing the problem was that my connection was changed by the upgrade so that it required IPv6 addressing before it was considered completed.\n\nOf course this does not seem like a perfect solution (or even permanent), now that even though in my country IPv6 is still not a standard, it will someday be and I would like to have a continuous connection by then. For those whose ISPs provide only IPv6 connectivity, this is not a solution.\nI have had a continuous connection for a long time now:\n\nIf I have no interruptions for the whole day, I will make this an answer and consider this question closed. Of course, this question might be a duplicate of the one I linked -  the opinion of a moderator is pending.\n\nA: My laptop has a Broadcom 4313 chipset which uses the same driver as yours. One thing I observed is that, when there's sustained and relatively high network traffic, the link will go down for about 10 seconds every 2 minutes. This is because the driver scans for access points every 2 minutes, but can't do this if the link is up; it thus brings the link down, scans, and brings link back up.\nI'm not sure why this happens but a workaround I found is\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the hardware address for your access point. One way to do it is to use the iwconfig command and look where it says \"Access Point:\". It will have an address looking like AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF.\n\n*Open the Networks indicator, then go to Edit Connections\n\n*Select your wireless connection , press Edit, and on the BSSID field (NOT SSID), put the hardware address from your access point. Then save the connection.\n\n\nI think what happens is, if the BSSID is configured, the driver knows the router's MAC address and doesn't need to go trying to find it every 2 minutes. If it's not configured, all it knows is the SSID and needs to check the MAC address, and for some reason wants to do it constantly.\n\nA: I once had similar problems with a Intel ipw2100 chip. The problem was solved by choosing a different IRQ in the BIOS.\nI don't know whether this might help you, but perhaps if no other idea is comming, you could give it a try. \n", "Q: Is there a Spotify repository that works for 12.04?

In the partition definition I choosed that my home partition to remain as my home, but I assumed wrongly that if I choose ext4 instead ext3, a reformat would happen without losing my data.\nThe installation completed 'successfully', except that I lost 100 GB of my precious music collection, documents and so on.\nIs there a way to recover my life (my music), considering that I have not done anything over disk after installation?\n\nA: If the drive shows as corrupt or raw, maybe, if it shows as blank, good luck.\nAnyways if it's the first of those 2 options, get gparted live disc, another drive big enough to hold all the files and go at it, it's pretty straight forward.\n\nA: Get a live CD. Mount the HDD readonly. Make a deep, bitwise copy to another drive with dd. \nOnly try to recover from that copy! \nI once made the experience, that I formated an ext2 drive to VFAT, didn't write anything to it, reformatted to ext2 and was very surprised to find anything again. But I wouldn't bet a cent, that this is reproducible.\nIf the data is so much worth - why don't you have a backup? harddrives are lost daily everywhere!

I ran the 12.04 upgrade last night without much thought. Following the upgrade and mandatory reboot, the wireless card no longer shows up in the network manager, the first time I've had any kind of issues with wireless under Ubuntu.\nI've done much Googling on the issue but so far I haven't found a permanent solution. Mucking around with some packages though (I've installed five different ones or so), I've managed to devise a workaround that I must run every time I boot the laptop. I have to remove the Broadcom STA driver and reinstall it.  Inspiration taken from here: WiFi does not work, Broadcom STA Wireless driver does not work on a BCM4313  After the second modprobe command, the wireless reappears in the network manager and ten seconds after that I'm back on the wifi.\nIf anyone can provide some advice on how to fix this permanently I will be extremely grateful.  I'd rather not roll back to 11.10 or reinstall, but I will if I need to.  Just let me know if you need the output from any terminal commands.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Looks like there's a bug filed. You might want to add yourself as affected and subscribe.\nAlso, this workaround shows how to blacklist the offending module and put the right one in place instead.\n\nA: The open source bcma driver works fine.\nsudo rmmod wl\nsudo modprobe bcma\n\nsudo reboot\n\nThis did the trick for me.\n\nA: First, try the STA driver.  Connect the Ethernet cable to get to the Internet, and go to System Settings, Additional Hardware and enable the STA driver and reboot.\nIf that doesn't work then disable the STA driver, reboot, connect the Ethernet cable to get to the Internet, and run this command:\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\n\nA: The problem with Broadcom 4313 on Ubuntu 12.04 is due to wireless channel of your router. Set the channel under 12 and the wireless card will connect to the LAN. I've tried every possible alternative solution before doing this. Nothing else is needed, unless the driver suggested by Ubuntu and this setting of the wireless channel. It has worked for me.\n", "Q: Upgrade with Nvidia graphics card causes continued issues. Should I remove the card for good? I've been a follower of Ubuntu for several years now and I've continually had issues upgrading (mostly major upgrades) due to the reboot issues that arise when an nVidia card/driver has been installed (EVGA GeForce 9500 GT). I usually have to resort to a complete re-install to get everything working. My last upgrade was an accidental upgrade (Doh!), as I didn't pay attention to what I was upgrading (110+ packages).\nMy typical solution has been to remove the graphics card (switching to my motherboard's graphics) and change the Boot type to some mode that will allow me to get to the command line. Then I move the /etc/X11/xorg.conf to reset things.\nmv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak\n\nThis will usually allow me to boot and login with decent graphics, but not with all the fancy graphics perks (Unity). I really don't care about all of the fancy visual effects with Ubuntu 11/12 provides. I just want something that works, which is why I moved to Ubuntu in the first place. I prefer simplicity and things that just work.\nShould I remove the nVidia graphics card for good this time?\nIs there a better alternative graphics card that I should get?\n\nA: Switching to the nouveau driver in jockey before upgrades is something I have long recommended.  \nI also always either...\n\n\n*\n\n*... accept that the proprietary binary driver is going to be buggy for a while after upgrades\n\n*... stick with the nouveau open source driver for quite some time after a new release  \n\n\nFor more information see Nvidia over ATI: Choosing a video card and At Present Which is the best choice for a Ubuntu graphics card, AMD or nVidia?\n", "Q: UbuntuOne syncing really slow I had my Documents folder synced in 11.10.

I've looked everywhere and I'm desperate. Thank you for your attention.\n\nA: The Debian release notes include some good instructions on disabling holds.\n", "Q: Long passphrase for login and short password for screensaver The situation is that: For the encrypted home directory, any passphrase less than 10 characters is useless at all. If someone physically get the harddisk, the data and the other sensitive password stored in keyring can be leaked as a cracking machine can attempt trillion passwords per second. So I prefer a long passphrase, which typed only once a day.\nFor the use of a laptop, however, the screensaver can be triggered very often and it sleeps sometimes in which entering long password just waste time. In this situation, fast password attempts is not possible. I just dont want random guy touch it, so I prefer a short password. Also, a laptop is more likely to loss, so a stronger encrypted passphrase is even deserved.\nOn the other hand, forgetting passphrase for login will loss all data so it changes rarely. In contrast, forgetting screensaver password makes no harm as it should be able to reset by relogin, so it encourages to change often.\nThis is a typical usage pattern, so I want to set a different password for screensaver? Is there any programs to do that? Any script? Thanks\nEdit\nI have tested the xscreensaver, and in the manual, it says:\n\nIf you change your password after xscreensaver has been launched, it\n  will continue using your old password to unlock the screen until\n  xscreensaver is restarted. On some systems, it may accept both your\n  old and new passwords. \n\nSo I would think there is a way to use a different password.\n\nA: Personally I believe this is a bad idea.  You are risking exposing your high-access account and all that it accesses.\nIf you did have this setup at all you might well want it the other way around, so that the 'login' one is less secure... because it also needs the username, whereas the screensaver one, the one that, wuithout even typing a username will immediately get you back into the (probably prvileged) account should be longer.  \nYeah it's a pain but you can also pick a password that is long, hard to crack and easy to remember.\nFor instacnce hjk34&*hkj567FGH might be good but something like Boston56@fishy@#### would be much easier to remember and type and would soon become 'ingrained' in the fingers.  I'd still write it down somewhere at home.\nAnother good option you can use is to set your screen-save for longer, say 30 or 45 minutes instead of 10... but know that you have the option to just lock it at will (ctrl-alt-del) at any time.\n", "Q: Hiding Files From Dash Search \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I keep recent files from appearing in Unity? \n\nI have images and videos that I want to have hidden from the Files and videos lens searches in my dash. (Nothing dirty, just ponies :P)\nAnyway....Is there a way to have a file or even a folder not show up? Would hiding the files or folders do the trick, or is there more that I need to do?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04, there is 'Privacy', a software that comes pre-installed that lets you customize what will and what will not be stored by Zeitgeist that the dash uses to search for content.\nSo go ahead and search your system for Privacy, and look at its functions.\nIt is pretty straight forward from there.

On another disk, there is Windows 8 Consumer Preview. I've been able to dual-boot with my BIOS's HDD selector. When I updated my Ubuntu 11.10 to 12.04, it included the new version of GRUB, which had an entry for Windows 8, as expected.\nHowever, whenever I try to boot into Windows 8, I can see the fish for a second or two and then a few lines of error code as follows:\nYour computer needs to restart.

However, if you can see the beta fish, after grub, it sounds like the problem may lie in the windows MBR. \nYou may want to try to restore the MBR by booting from a pendrive with Windows 8 installer on it (as you would with a Ubuntu live cd). Instead of installing, select the repair option in the bottom left corner. From there, you can attempt an automatic repair or reset your Windows install. Just make sure not to erase your data.

BTW I had this same issue when updating to 12.04.\n\nA: I faced the same problem for quite some time and it certainly tested my patience until I resolved it by pure luck.\nJust install grub on the hard disk where your Windows 8 partition lies and change your BIOS settings so that this disk boots first.\nI hope this saves some people the trouble I went through to get this sorted out.\n", "Q: How to change a dconf setting for customized Live CD? I am creating a live CD for use in a kiosk/installation.

So far, all is working well, except for one thing: the screens turn off after 5 minutes. As I understand it, the system settings for all this are set by the default dconf profile. I can't just change the settings for the root user in the uck terminal; user \"ubuntu\" is created from scratch on every boot. I need to change the default profile.\nI did some digging and found the dconf key that I want to provide a new default for is idle-delay. \nI tried to follow the instructions on the dconf wiki page, but it's pretty confusing to me. I also tried to follow the instructions here for setting the idle-delay, without success.\nMy question is: what are the correct files to create, and/or commands to run, to specify in the dconf db that every new user should start out with a profile that leaves the monitor on all day? /org/gnome/desktop/session/idle-delay appears to be the key I want to set.\nThank you kindly!\n\nA: To change the default for any DConf key setting, create a file in /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/. The filename should end in .gschema.override, but you are free to choose what to call it. You will need administrative privileges, of course.\nThe override file has the following syntax.

To check, it might be a good idea to switch the monitors over and see if the problem is still on the same monitor or if it has moved to the other one. You should also try just swapping the cables to see if that's the problem.\nIf the problem sticks with the same monitor even when connected to a different output and changing the cable makes no difference then I would say there is something wrong with the monitor. Otherwise I would say it was the graphics card. But make sure you test the cable.\nI get this same problem myself with a snowy effect and flickering if my cable comes slightly loose at the back. It may be something as simple as a bent pin in the cable head which isn't quite connecting properly and can be bent back (had that problem in the past too).\nThe software crashing is probably due to the PC thinking you've disconnected the monitor and just not handling that very well.\n\nA: Think this is probably a problem with hardware more than likely GPU.

You'll want the top four of these checked under Software Sources in your system configuration.\n\nA: In my experience, Firefox sometimes have episodes of.. well, extereme memory consumption - which quite possibly are not caused by some problem in Firefox itself but maybe some rogue javascript or flash movie on some page which you currently have opened.\nRestarting Firefox helps in such cases.\nYou can check memory consumption of individual applications using System Monitor application.\n\nA: I have the same problem and has solved it by switching from ubuntu to lubuntu. \nYou can find how to switch from Is there an easy way to change Ubuntu flavor during upgrade?\nI think the problem is unity player causing the lag.\n\nA: AND there is one more possibility, which I must mention as I've experienced it to many times.

Replace it for the username you want.\nsudo chmod a-w /home/john - Removes permission for all users to delete or modify a file.\nsudo mkdir /home/john/ftp - Creates a folder named 'ftp' in the home dir of user 'john'\nsudo chown -Rv john.john /home/john/ftp - Changes ownership of the dir to group 'john' and user 'john'.\n\nA: Why?\nTaken and adapted from my own answer in bug 1065714.\nIn order to keep stable releases stable, updates after release are only considered under specific circumstances. Details of the process and of the criteria required are listed here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#When\nThis does make it difficult for users of the LTS release to have writeable chroots, since the upstream vsftpd project decided to release without this feature at the time that 12.04 was released. Now that 12.04 is released and the fix doesn't meet the above criteria, I don't think this will change for 12.04. But note that the Stable Release Updates Team makes the final decision on this, and an update hasn't been proposed to them.\nIf you'd like a newer version of vsftpd to be made generally available for users who do want to use the \"allow_writeable_chroot\" option, then the backports repository is an appropriate venue for this. With a backport, users who want the feature could just add the backports repository and install vsftpd from there. You can find out more about backports and how to request one here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports\nIn the meantime, The Frontier Group has kindly provided a PPA, as described in lumbric's answer.

I also have 11.10 and Im planning to upgrade after 3 months.\nPeoples are having lots of issues related to new 12.04. There is still less help available on net for newer problems and moreover you might lead to improper upgrade\nRule says a LTS version should upgrade to higher LTS verson. 11.10 is not the LTS version so upgrading it might lead to problems.\nIm gonna wait for 12.10 or atleast 3 months. If you thinking of upgrading then It might be better to go for a complete reinstall.\n\nA: The upgrades are generally fairly safe, but if you're concerned about data loss - a reasonable concern - you should first do a backup.  That's true whether you upgrade now or whether you wait several months or a year.  Don't risk that which you can't afford to lose.  \nSo whenever you do the upgrade, you should also realize that although nothing can be guaranteed to be problem-free, you should know that the process has been tested a lot.  A LOT!  Do what you can to be safe, read the directions (follow the link posted above by Jorge Castro) and comments, and then go ahead.  (In my case, I upgraded two computers from 11.10 to 12.04, one over the Internet and the other from the CD I downloaded and burned; I did it both ways just to learn the differences.)\n", "Q: Failed Attempt to Upgrade to 12.04 Need to Get Old Files Hey so I tried upgrading to the new 12.04 version. When I tried to reboot it up though, it went to the purple screen and hung there. I wanted to get my important documents off of my old Ubuntu, so I switched over to Windows and redownloaded the jump drive boot up. Once in the trial version I cannot find my files, only files that are on my Windows section. Is there any way to recover the files that were on my old Ubuntu, its finals week and I really need a couple of them, and starting to freak out a bit that I will have to start all over on two semester long projects. Any help I would appreciate, and so would my sleeping schedule. Thanks so much.\n\nA: Trying running ubuntu off a disk or USB in its Live Session. You can go into your hard drive and fetch files that way. Windows won't be able to understand some hard drive formats, especially from linux.\n\nA: Use a live / recovery disk and use it to copy the data to your Windows accessible disk (Ubuntu's LiveCD should be able to read/write NTFS easily).   If you want to get it off the machine entirely, use the Cloud or USB disk. \nIt is possible that your disks are in lvm - and in the liveCD you'll need to install install lvm2.  If your /home partition is on a separate physical partition from the / (root) partition, you may be able to do a fresh re-install. \nEdit:  Noting from OP's comment;  if this is installed via Wubi, you can get to them via 3rd party software. \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#How_can_I_access_the_Wubi_files_from_Windows.3F\n", "Q: Cant log in as user after upgrade Everything worked fine in 11.10.  Upgraded today, got the low system resource error for my graphics card.  Completely uninstalled fglrx and reinstalled it.  Will now boot to login screen but wont let me log in as my user.  Guest logs in fine. I completely uninstalled FGLRX again, but still had the same problem.  Since my video card is old I think FGLRX is not supported for me.  How do I get a generic driver installed?  In the terminal when i type startx i says it already is started on display 0.  Any help would be great.\n\nA: Which display manager did you use previously? AFAIK, 12.04 uses lightdm as default. If you were using another display manager (gdm, lxdm), you might need to re-configure your system to use that display manager instead of lightdm. This is very easy. If you were using lxdm previously, for example, you could \"re-activate\" lxdm with this command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lxdm\n\nA menu should appear that allows you to select the display manager to use. It should even work with any of the installed display managers - so you could even enter sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm and select lxdm or gdm. After choosing my \"previous\" dm, everything worked fine for me.\n", "Q: Install 12.04 alongside 11.04, having a share /home, but I cannot login into 12.04 I have 11.04 installed in my computer, and I decided to install 12.04 from CD in a new partition, but having only one /home partition shared by both systems. \nInstallation went ok, but when I enter my password the screen turns black and returns to the login screen half a second later.\nI can log in as guest.

I changed owner of .Xauthority to my username and it works now.\n\nWhile I wrote this I saw other similar posts on this website, it's not a 12.04 problem, but the bad guy is always this .Xauthority. Deleting it or changing owner seems working\n@see Can't login after installing 11.10\n\nA: Boot up a rescue cd, which could be Ubuntu or not, then mount both roots, edit /etc/passed of the new version so that the UID of the user equals that of the old version. Do the same with /etc/group. Now you boot into 12.04 you should have no /home directory issue, assuming your passwd is correct. If you are not sure, you can copy the old passwd from /etc/shadow and put in the new version file, while you fixed UID and GID.\n", "Q: 12.04 Boot-up loop Whenever most Linux OS tries to boot up, they loop on modprobe and/or when finding my USB Keyboard and Mouse(both Logitech).\nUbuntu 10.04 works perfectly(and Mandriva), but any higher than 10.04, or any other Linux OS won't even go into Live mode, or install.

All went well. I can boot into GNOME Shell. Get Activities overview, except that there are no recent files!\nIn 11.10, I used to get Recent files. What is missing? How do I get the recent files back?\n\nA: You can integrate file search into Gnome shell by installing this extension:\nhttps://extensions.gnome.org/extension/62/journal/ \nIf you also want your recently opened files in the jump list of the appropriate program (very handy) install this extension:\nhttps://extensions.gnome.org/extension/33/jump-lists/\nMake sure you have installed gir1.2-gnomedesktop-3.0 before installing the extension:\nsudo apt-get install gir1.2-gnomedesktop-3.0\n\n\nA: This functionality was removed by GNOME developers in bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=670150. To get recent files back in search results you have to build and install gnome-shell from source with the two commits reverted or stick with gnome-shell 3.2.2.1 and Ubuntu 11.10 for foreseeable future, until replacement applications like gnome-documents gain some shape.\n\nA: You can install the extension Tracker Search. Make sure you install before the packages tracker and gir1.2-tracker-0.14.\nSince Tracker will index every files in the folders you've configured, it's less efficient and accurate than searching among the recent files.

It is not a total area calculation either, as I can arrange the monitors in such a way as to use more total screen area than the normal arrangement would, and that is allowed.\nSeems to be something that limits it to 4000.\nAnother things that worked for me, is to rotate my second monitor so that it is vertical, this reduced the width enough to make the resolution acceptable.  This doesn't work very well for me, as my second monitor looks very bad vertical due to the viewing angle design of the monitor.\nI found that you can forcibly set the resolution via the xorg.conf however, this doesn't work.  The section of the screen area beyond 4000 becomes corrupted.\n\nA: There are two solutions I've found to the same problem.\nSolution 1.  Disable proprietary driver.  Reboot.  Now go to Settings > Displays and uncheck the \"mirror displays\" box.  You may also wish to alter the \"launcher placement\" setting so that you have one launcher on one monitor, not an additional one on the 2nd monitor.  You may also wish to disable \"sticky edges\" so that your mouse won't catch when moving between the two monitors.\nSolution 2. This is a clarification of Boris's answer who recommends using the AMD/ATI control panel, but his image was in French and there are more details needed. If you're really set on running the proprietary driver, open AMD Catalyst Control Center (I use the Administrative version, not sure if that's required or not).  Then you'll need to set the two monitors to have nothing to do with each other... not mirroring, and not multi-desktop.  Just single.  Then reboot.  THEN in the next page down in Catalyst Control Center's option pages, enable Xinerama, and reboot again.\nIn some cases the latter solution doesn't work.  For example in my current situation, something wasn't allowing me to dissociate the two monitors... they kept getting forced into cloning.

Given our users are all living in LDAP with uids well above 1000, this means it is now impossible to login via the GUI.\nTo workaround we've had to set the greeter-hide-users option to true in lightdm.conf.

I started using Ubuntu two years ago by installing the Xubuntu 9.04 and then \nproceeded to install Gnome and a selection of extra packages I needed.\nI am forced to migrate to a new version since 9.04 is no longer supported.\nI was planning on installing Xubuntu 12.04 mainly for the LTS feature thinking \nthat it would be supported for 5 years much like the standard version. \nHowever Xubuntu is only supported for 3 years.\nMy Questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*With standard Ubuntu 12.04, could one resort to a simpler / more traditional look\nthan Gnome Unity? \nIf so will the rest of the installed packages and functionality remain usable and\nfunctional?\n\n*Could one resort to installing Xubuntu 12.04 instead and add extra packages\nfrom the repository as needed?\n\n*Am I right in assuming that Xubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu 12.04 share the same\nrepository? In which case: \n\n\n*\n\n*Why/how is it said that Xubuntu 12.04 has support for 3 years versus \n  the 5 years support offered for Ubuntu 12.04?\n\n*Could an Xubuntu 12.04 installation continue upgrading from the 12.04 \n  (Precise Pangolin) repositories with given that they ought to be \n  around for 5 years to honour the commitment to standard Ubuntu 12.04?\n\n\n\nA: Since this is a new way of providing LTS, by allowing each flavor to decidee the length of support, all the details may have to wait three years. However, under the 3/5 year support plan, anything Xfce specific will no longer be updated or fixed after three years. Also, bug reports will no longer be accepted after three years. \nI do not know if the developers will attempt to determine the desktop package, and only allow certain systems to have updates, or if some updates will be allowed for everyone for five years. \n\nA: Well seeing that LTS releases come out every 2 years (ex:10.04/12.04), three years is not really that bad. You can upgrade in three years and get another three years support. Sticking with an operating system after three years, is really not that beneficial. Allot of LTS users usually upgrade when next LTS comes out.

I have installed Ubuntu server 12.4 in Oracle Virtual box, after completing installation, i cant use the Ubuntu server in full screen,guest additions present in virtual box will work  in ubuntu server.\n\nA: The VirtualBox guest additions display driver only works on graphical mode, not text mode. You will need to install Xorg to use it full-screen. \n\nA: You can have the ubuntu server console in VirtualBox start at a resolution that your graphic card supports via the virtualbox environment.\nQuick Steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the resolutions your graphic card supports via the VirtualBox Environment (VBE).You should be able to find that out by issuing the command 'vbeinfo' in the GRUB console (hit the C key when the GRUB boot menu shows up).\n\n*Pick one resolution, then open '/etc/default/grub' (e.g. sudo vim /etc/default/grub) and change the line #GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 to something like this GRUB_GFXMODE=1152x864 (where 1152x864 should be your custom resolution which is also supported by your graphic card).\n\n*Now run these two commands one-by-one:\nsudo update-grub\nsudo reboot\n\nYou should now see your VM's console in the custom resolution that you just set.\n(PS: As Javier Rivera said, full screen resolution may not be possible.)\n\nA: As mentioned in Proper way to change terminal resolution in Ubuntu Server 13.04?\nyou also need to set\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep\n\nin the /etc/default/grub file otherwise the resolution is only briefly used during boot\n\nA: Other answers didn't work properly for me on Ubuntu 16.10 - e.g. resolution would be applied, but then reverted at various points later during boot. What did eventually work was the combination of the following three settings in /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1280x1024  # width x height required - see below\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nomodeset\"\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep\n\nFollowed by running:\nsudo update-grub\nsudo reboot\n\nNOTE 1: Supported resolutions can be identified from within grub. Hit C at the grub prompt, then type:\nset pager=1    (To enable paging of long vbeinfo output)\nvbeinfo\nreboot         (When done)\n\nWhen selecting a resolution, width x height is sufficient (unless you specifically care about setting colour depth too).\nNote 2: If you don't see the GRUB menu, hold Shift while booting.\n\nA: What I always do is install ssh on the server and then use putty to access the server. Not only does this allow me to view the server in full screen, it also allows me to connect to it from other machines.\nto install ssh metapackage (client and server) just run:  \nsudo apt-get install ssh\n\nYou could install only openssh-server if you don't need the ssh client on the VM.\n", "Q: Sound sometimes disappears, definitely when skype is installed After I upgraded to Xubuntu 12.04 from 11.10, I noticed skype was uninstalled, so I reinstalled it with aptitude.

A slight increment was proposed at the end of March but was not pushed into the main repositories when the support date completed.\nThe change was relatively small - thus, unless you are looking for those specific fixes, I would stay with the stable and most widely tested kernel in the main repository.\nNow that the support arrangements for maverick has been removed, the April 2012 archives is a good reference for the last remaining changes to maverick.\nThere can be a small number of proposed updates that miss the push to main - that is to be expected.  If you look at the lp number [i.e. the launchpad reference] for the bug fix in question (look at the change log in update-manager), it usually gives a good indication how far it moved through the testing process before being pushed.\nIn summary - proposed repository was for testing.  These updates did not complete their testing process before the support arrangements completed.  You only need to update to specific packages if you were looking for a specific bug-fix that a proposed package may have contained.\n\nA: You can always go back\nWhen using the \"proposed updates\" repository, it's a bit like using a beta application. It often works but it could crash too.\nUsing your package manager, you can always deactivate the \"proposed updates\" repository and downgrade back your application to the one in the stable repositories. Furthermore regarding the kernel, unless it is the exact same version, it will be installed in parallel of the current one. So in case you found that the proposed kernel update crashes, you can still go back to the previous one by selecting it upon boot. Or you can just downgrade it, just like other application.\nTo downgrade an application using Synaptic, click the application and select \"Force Version\" (Ctrl+E) in the Package menu. From the dropdown box, select the version you want to use.\nFinal thoughts\nIf you want to try this update because you need a correction or new feature that is listed in the change log, then try the proposed update. If not, then I would recommend not to update.\nRecommandation: I would strinlgy advise you to migrate to a supported release of Ubuntu. It means you get security updates.\n\nA: You are correct that 10.10 support has ended.  If you want security updates and bug fixes that are \"official\" or have undergone the usual testing and vetting processes you simply have to upgrade or change to a different version of Ubuntu.\nThis is pretty much the only advice I (or anybody else) can advise here.\nProposed-updates are never intended to be installed in a big group just like you would with normal updates.  You only cherry-pick a specific update from proposed-updates when you are suffering a specific problem that the update is supposed to fix, and you want to help with the testing of that fix before the fix becomes \"official\" (and deal with the consequences if it introduces new bugs).  Otherwise, you leave them well alone and just wait for official fixes through \"updates\".\nSince your Ubuntu is not supported, I'm even more confused about why you think you want to install these proposed-updates, since these updates have also long-since become abandoned, having never made it into any official updates.  They may have never made it because they introduced too many new bugs, or maybe they were just the victims of bad timing.  They may or may not make your system even more broken than it already is, especially if you install them indiscriminately.  Or one of them might, by pure chance, fix some issue you were experiencing.  But they will not be a substitute for using a version of Ubuntu that is not abandoned.\n", "Q: Wireless not working anymore on Acer Aspire 6930G when I upgraded to 12.04 I have been using Ubuntu for a long time and I have never encountered any driver related issues.

A year or two ago, I installed mint4win on a Windows 7 netbook, and have used it frequently since, with no issues (even once when I had to cold reboot!). I enjoy using Linux Mint, but after trying Ubuntu 12.04 from a USB stick, I'd like to be able to install that, too. The problem is that I share the Windows 7 netbook with my family, and I have to be careful not to mess up Windows, which is why I went the mint4win route in the first place. \nSo, here's the question: is it possible to install Precise using wubi while still keeping Mint, using mint4win?\n\nA: If mint4win uses wubildr.mbr and wubildr to boot (which I believe it does), then it's not possible to install and use both (without some manual linking i.e. through a custom grub entry). The wubildr file is hardcoded to look for \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk with Wubi, and for mint4win I assume it's \\linuxmint\\disks\\root.disk. So you'd have to switch wubildr to boot different versions (even if you had two entries in the windows boot manager it would always boot one of either Mint or Ubuntu - the one you installed last).\nThere may also be conflicts in the registry entries (but this seems more likely to be separate due to the different installer name, so not a problem).\nSo to explain how Wubi/Mint4win boots:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows boot manager calls wubildr.mbr. This can be within \\linuxmint\\winboot or \\ubuntu\\winboot for Win7/Vista (or in C:\\ for XP).\n\n*wubildr.mbr searches all partitions for the first wubildr it finds. This is always in the root of the partition (so can be only one).\n\n*wubildr is hardcoded to look for either \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk (for Ubuntu) or \\linuxmint\\disks\\root.disk (for Mint).\n\n\nIn theory, assuming there are no other conflicts, you could install both Wubi and Mint4Win, but it will always boot the most recently installed. You could then add a custom grub boot entry to boot the other install. But this sort of thing isn't usual for the typical Wubi/Mint4Win user.\n", "Q: Logitech M515 does not work after upgrade to 12.04 After upgrading to 12.04, my Logitech M515 does not work here is some output from the terminal:\nlsusb\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 0411:002a BUFFALO INC.

Use same methodng if you plug in the dongle after the system is booted.\nWorks 100% for me! Annoying but works great, just put a 10 sec delay befor the drive looks for HID device should do the trick.\n\nA: I have the same problem with a m505 Logitech wireless mouse where the mouse will not be recognized.

I had to uninstall phpmyadmin from the production server and googled for it and used this:\nsudo dpkg -P phpmyadmin\n\nWell, this worked fine, but it seems everyone else on Ubuntu is using a purge instead\nsudo apt-get purge phpmyadmin \n\nHave I done anything wrong? Any consequences I should be aware of (it is my production server after all) Are all bits of the phpmyadmin really uninstalled through dpkg -P?\n\nA: dpkg and apt-get are 2 different ways of installing software. Basically apt-get, aptitude, and synaptic are built on top of debian's dpkg package management program. They all perform the same basic function - package management, but have some extra features. 1 of the extra features of apt-get is that it will install dependencies and dpkg does not.\nRegarding the -p/purge  ...\nThe -P in dpkg means --purge and will remove everything, including setttings and configuration files. From the manual:\n-r, --remove, -P, --purge package...|-a|--pending\n\n          Remove  an  installed  package. -r or --remove remove everything\n          except conffiles. This may avoid having to reconfigure the pack‐\n          age  if  it  is  reinstalled later. (Conffiles are configuration\n          files that are listed in the DEBIAN/conffiles control file).  -P\n          or  --purge  removes  everything,  including conffiles. If -a or\n          --pending is given instead of a package name, then all  packages\n          unpacked,   but   marked   to  be  removed  or  purged  in  file\n          /var/lib/dpkg/status, are removed or purged, respectively. Note:\n          some  configuration  files might be unknown to dpkg because they\n          are created and handled  separately  through  the  configuration\n          scripts. In that case, dpkg won't remove them by itself, but the\n          package's postrm script (which is called by dpkg), has  to  take\n          care of their removal during purge. Of course, this only applies\n          to files in system directories, not configuration files  written\n          to individual users' home directories.\n\n          Removing of a package consists of the following steps:\n\n          1. Run prerm script\n\n          2. Remove the installed files\n\n          3. Run postrm script\n\nThe same goes for purge in apt-get.\n remove\n       remove is identical to install except that packages are removed\n       instead of installed. Note the removing a package leaves its\n       configuration files in system. If a plus sign is appended to the\n       package name (with no intervening space), the identified package\n       will be installed instead of removed.\n\n\n purge\n       purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and\n       purged (any configuration files are deleted too).\n\nBasically it is the same option. Mind you: removal of dependencies does not happen with dpkg. apt-get does remove dependencies\nDocumentation from comment by Lekensteyn: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkgtools.en.html\n", "Q: Low graphics mode after upgrade to 12.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to fix “The system is running in low-graphics mode” error? \n\nI have an ATI Radeon 3200 graphics card. \nI just upgraded to 12.04 and I get the System running low graphics... error code. \nYour screen, graphics card, and input device settings could not be detected correctly.\n\nIt is exactly the same problem as one or two previous questions.

I've taken a look at for example Setting TeX Live path for root, but this does not seem to make sense to me, perhaps as I'm from a Windows background. Is there any way to set the truly system-wide path, such that the entries are inherited by absolutely every process running on the system?\n\nA: Update:\nSetting global environment variables should still be performed in /etc/environment, but as you pointed out, using sudo -s has the effect of these variables are \"vanished\".\nThe reason for that is sudo has a policy of resetting the Environment and setting a secure path. It is enabled by default:\n/etc/sudoers:\n\nDefaults  env_reset\nDefaults  secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\"\n\nThus whatever is set in the /etc/environment for the path is overridden by sudo.\nThe manual page for sudoers states:\n   env_reset       If set, sudo will reset the environment to only contain\n                   the LOGNAME, MAIL, SHELL, USER, USERNAME and the SUDO_*\n                   variables.

If the secure_path option is set,\n                   its value will be used for the PATH environment\n                   variable.  This flag is on by default.\n\nAs a workaround, you can use sudo su that will provide a shell with root privileges but containing the right PATH.\n\nOriginal Answer\nYou should set it in /etc/environment.\nTry sudo YOUR_TEXT_EDITOR /etc/environment (make sure to create a backup first).\nFor more information: EnvironmentVariables\n\nSystem-wide environment variables\nEnvironment variable settings that affect the system as a whole\n  (rather then just a particular user) should not be placed in any of\n  the many system-level scripts that get executed when the system or the\n  desktop session are loaded, but into\n/etc/environment - This file is specifically meant for system-wide environment variable settings.

After that, run sudo update-initramfs -u.\nDo note that this change applies only on the next boot. To unload the module in the current session, run sudo rmmod nvidia.\nBy the way, when you install Bumblebee, it'll automatically blacklist nvidia and nouveau.

I've just installed xscreensaver instead of gnome-screensaver in Ubuntu 12.04 in gnome-session-fallback (Gnome Classic) mode. It works fine, but I have a problem:\nI put \"xscreensaver -no-splash\" command to the startup applications list.\nBut it doesn't start automatically, I have to run this command manually. I think that the problem is that it tries to start before I log in. So how can I start it automatically after login?\nUpdate Jan 2021\nI moved to a different DE a long time ago, so this issue no longer affects me. New answers are still coming, however I cannot mark any of them as accepted as I can't test them any more.\n\nA: One possible way is to introduce a short delay of (for example) 10 seconds before running the command.  This should allow all the logon processes to complete before running the xscreensaver command.\nUse a startup application command line of:\nsh -c \"sleep 10 && xscreensaver -no-splash &\"\n\n\nA: I had it working then I updated to 14.04 and it stopped working.\nThe solution is to go into Synaptic and completely remove the Gnome screen saver. Ubuntu sneakily reinstalls it on \"upgrade\".\nWhen you reboot it should work now with the original xscreensaver -nosplash startup.\n\nA: Tested and used in Ubuntu 13.04\nAs no answer has been marked as correct yet; this could be this issue with running xscreensaver on startup\nas @peterx14 says here, many of the tutorials for setting up xscreensaver provide incorrect information.\nThey tell you to set up a screensaver.desktop file with the following command:\nsudo gedit /etc/xdg/autostart/screensaver.desktop\n\nand then place inside it the following information:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Screensaver\nType=Applicaton\nExec=xscreensaver -nosplash\n\nHowever, for some reason, in many of these tutorials, the above command is incorrect. 'Application' has been misspelt as 'Applicaton'. This causes the startup command to not work.\nTherefore, if you have already entered the command \n\"xscreensaver -no-splash\" \n\ninto your startup list, it would not work as xscreensaver is not set up with the type application.\nTo find out if this is the issue: first run locate screensaver.desktop. This should, somewhere in the list, tell you where screensaver.desktop is. On my computer it's in /etc/xdg/autostart/screensaver.desktop, then open it in an editor (terminal 'nano' may be best as you will need sudo commands to open it) and change 'Applicaton' to 'Application'.\nAlso, different tutorials (such as liberiangeek and Radu's response)  suggest using:\n\"xscreensaver -nosplash\"\n\nas the fix above uses. This depends which value you have within your screensaver.desktop file on line 4: Exec=xscreensaver -nosplash.\n\nA: I spent several hours with the same problem but then I finally found the answer that I was looking for.\nGo to forums.debian.net follow the directions changing only two things. \nThe first is the line that reads:\ngedit ~/.config/autostart/xcreensaver.desktop\n\nNeeds to be entered as:\nsudo gedit ~/.config/autostart/xcreensaver.desktop\n\nAnd the second is that to perform this it must be done from the user account it is be applied to, and to do this the user must be an Administrator.\nSo if the user is a standard user their account type must be change to Administrator it done for them from their account and then the account changed back to a Standard user. \nHope it corrects your problem as well.\n\nA: I think, it has something to do with output redirection.\nThe following line worked for me in Lubuntu 13.10:\nxscreensaver -nosplash -log /dev/null\n\n\nA: I'm new to Ubuntu, was running Mandrake/Mandriva for over 10yrs.

Thanks so much.\nI ran a few tests in the terminal that might help someone smarter than me:\n1. sudo lshw -class network\n  *-network               \n   description: Wireless interface \n   product: AR9285 Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express) \n   vendor: Atheros Communications Inc. \n   physical id: 0 \n   bus info: pci@0000:01:00.0 \n   logical name: wlan0 \n   version: 01 \n   serial: e4:d5:3d:94:f8:05 \n   width: 64 bits \n   clock: 33MHz \n   capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless \n   configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ath9k driverversion=3.2.0-24-generic      \n   firmware=N/A latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bgn \n   resources: irq:17 memory:90000000-9000ffff \n   *-network \n   description: Ethernet interface \n   physical id: 1 \n   logical name: eth0 \n   serial: e8:40:f2:31:c3:33 \n   size: 10Mbit/s \n   capacity: 100Mbit/s \n   capabilities: ethernet physical tp mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd   \n   autonegotiation \n   configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=asix driverversion=08- \n   Nov-2011 duplex=half firmware=ASIX AX88772 USB 2.0 Ethernet link=no  \n   multicast=yes port=MII speed=10Mbit/s \n\n2. lspci\n    00:00.0 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] Family 14h Processor Root Complex \n    00:01.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Wrestler [Radeon HD 6290] \n    00:01.1 Audio device: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Wrestler HDMI Audio [Radeon HD 6250/6310] \n    00:05.0 PCI bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] Family 14h Processor Root Port \n    00:11.0 SATA controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI SB7x0/SB8x0/SB9x0 SATA Controller [AHCI mode] \n    00:12.0 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI SB7x0/SB8x0/SB9x0 USB OHCI0 Controller \n    00:12.2 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI SB7x0/SB8x0/SB9x0 USB EHCI Controller \n    00:13.0 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI SB7x0/SB8x0/SB9x0 USB OHCI0 Controller \n    00:13.2 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI SB7x0/SB8x0/SB9x0 USB EHCI Controller \n    00:14.0 SMBus: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI SBx00 SMBus Controller (rev 42) \n    00:14.2 Audio device: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI SBx00 Azalia (Intel HDA) (rev 40) \n    00:14.3 ISA bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI SB7x0/SB8x0/SB9x0 LPC host controller (rev 40) \n    00:14.4 PCI bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI SBx00 PCI to PCI Bridge (rev 40) \n    00:16.0 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI SB7x0/SB8x0/SB9x0 USB OHCI0 Controller \n    00:16.2 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI SB7x0/SB8x0/SB9x0 USB EHCI Controller \n    00:18.0 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] Family 12h/14h Processor Function 0 (rev 43) \n    00:18.1 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] Family 12h/14h Processor Function 1 \n    00:18.2 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] Family 12h/14h Processor Function 2 \n    00:18.3 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] Family 12h/14h Processor Function 3 \n    00:18.4 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] Family 12h/14h Processor Function 4 \n    00:18.5 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] Family 12h/14h Processor Function 6 \n    00:18.6 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] Family 12h/14h Processor Function 5 \n    00:18.7 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] Family 12h/14h Processor Function 7 \n    01:00.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc.

After the upgrade one of the users cannot see applications in the dash:\n\nTyping a search query doesn't help:\n\nThis system was previously upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04 and from 11.04 to 11.10 but no problem happened those times.\nI can provide more information like logs, if someone tells me where I can get it.\n\nA: I had similar problem, moved zeitgeist directory to zeitgeist.bak and re-login:\nmv ~/.local/share/zeitgeist  ~/.local/share/zeitgeist.bak \n\nThe problem is that the zeitgeist directory has the wrong permissions. You can also select the folder in Nautilus, and select properties, and make the directory read/writeable for yourself. Then you don't need to log out and in again.\n\nA: Are the file/directory permissions ok, especially of the ~/.config folder? I've encountered issues myself when updating a ubuntu box and using same username as in the old system. After the update, all files and directories of my user folder had 1001 as owner and group.\n", "Q: What is the difference between `VAR=...` and `export VAR=...`?

It is probably followed by an export MAVEN_OPTS command to make this variable available as environment variable to child programs, or a shell command that uses it like java $MAVEN_OPTS ...\nexport MAVEN_OPTS=\"-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=384m\"\n\nSets a environment variable named MAVEN_OPTS. This environment variable is also available to child programs.\nThere are no side-effects except for that some java memory limits are adjusted for maven (a build system iirc).\n\nA: The 1st one sets the value to the variable. For instance you can do\necho $MAVEN_OPTS\n\nand have it return the value but if you would issue that outside your shell you will have an empty string returned.\nIn comes export.\nExport is an instruction to the shell. It tells the shell to make this environment variable available to other programs executed from the same shell. Without the export, they are only available within the shell itself.\nIf you want the variable to be permanently available ssh reads ~/.ssh/environment,ssh2 reads /etc/environment and ~/.ssh2/environment, and adds lines of the format VARNAME=value to the environment.

After that, I am confronted with a error message:\n\nPlease eject the disk from \"Slimtype DVD A DS8A5S\" manually.\n  The disk could not be ejected though it needs to be removed for the current operation to continue.\n\nWhen I eject the disk, it shows the burning is complete, but the next time I insert the disk, it cannot be read. It is neither read by Ubuntu or by Windows OS. If I try to create bootable DVDs, the computer cannot boot from the DVD.\n\nA: I to have run into this problem.  After MUCH searching I've found this.\nUbuntu bug tracker\nAfter reading this, I was able to burn a disk without the 'on the fly' option.  burned a cd of pictures (which was when I noticed the problem) at 36x and it worked fine when done. \nIts high priority and someone is working on it.  It seems to effect cds, dvds, and bluray.\n\nA: Have you tried reducing the \"Burning speed\" in Brasero using the drop down menu when you initiate the burn process?  I have experienced problems when burning disks at maximum speed and these issues have been resolved when I set Brasero to burn at the lowest available speed (which is still fairly quick).\n", "Q: Does 12.04 have 24 bit 96000 sound? If not I will stick with the early version as it is more stable and I am very happy with it.\n\nA: Your hardware will determine what quality of sound you have.  Linux has supported 24-bit 9600 sound for quite a while now and there is no reason support would be dropped.\n", "Q: How to list dependent packages (reverse dependencies)? In order to research what caused the installation of a given package, I'd like to get a list of packages which depend on that package. I couldn't find anything obvious in man dpkg.\n\nA: aptitude has a fairly nice way of handling this:\n$ aptitude why bash\ni   foomatic-filters PreDepends bash (>= 2.05)\n\nBy default, it only lists the \"most installed, strongest, tightest, shortest\" reason, but you can use aptitude -v why to make it output everything it finds.\n\nA: apt-cache rdepends packagename should do what you want\n\nA: apt-cache showpkg <pkgname> \n\nExample: \napt-cache showpkg lightdm\n\n\nA: The simplest option is still:\napt rdepends package-name\n\nwhich does not require you to install any package.\n\nA: There is more than one way, with each method showing a different output.\nFor a detailed view of the full reverse dependency tree; \naptitude install apt-rdepends\napt-rdepends -r bash\n\nAlternatively;\napt-cache showpkg bash\n\nOr a concise list: \napt-cache rdepends bash\n\n\nA: In addition to other good answers, an apt/apt-get -s does a \"simulated\" removal (or install).\nsudo apt -s remove <pkgname>\n\nUsing -s or --simulate to remove (or install) packages, will normally list any dependencies affected. It will show orphaned packages when removing, or needed dependencies when installing, without actually executing the install or remove. Informational only.\n\nA: With the reverse-depends command from the package: ubuntu-dev-tools\nreverse-depends libjs-openlayers\n# For build depends search\nreverse-depends -b libjs-openlayers\n\nReverse-Recommends\n* gis-osm\n\nReverse-Depends\n* cyclograph\n* phpmyadmin\n* sumo-tools\n\nPackages without architectures listed are reverse-dependencies in: amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, ppc64el, s390x\n\n\nA: Since the --installed option of apt-cache was mentioned in comments of RobotHumans's answer and does not make much sense as the matching is done against all versions, including uninstalled ones (see Debian bug 1029586), here's the solution proposed by Julian Andres Klode to get the reverse dependencies among the installed packages:\napt list '?any-version(?installed?depends(?exact-name(packagename)))'\n\nNote that packagename is just the package name, without architecture information. For instance, libpcre3 works, but not libpcre3:amd64.\n", "Q: What do I do when dist upgrade to 12.04 was interrupted in install-stage by  the system being  powered off? How do I check system state when dist upgrade was interrupted during install stage by power-off? I just run dpkg -l | grep -v \"^ii\" to ensure that I have no broken packages installed. At the first glance everything works but I doubt that as the upgrade dialog was just before crash at 70% of estimated install-work (cleaning and removing wasn't even done too). What should I do next?

I have successfully set up netbeans IDE. I want to be able to use the Sun Wireless Toolkit (WTK 2.5.2) emulator to test my applications. However, when I test run my apps, the emulator isn't started.  \nA thorough search on the internet indicated that the WTK I am using is targeted for JRE 32 while the one I have in my system is the 64 bit version. The only remedy suggested was to install the jdk 32 bit version and point WTK to that version. \nHow do I install the 32 bit version of jdk while at the same time keeping the 64 bit one?\nBelow are my specs:\n1. Intel Core i3\n2. Ubuntu 11.10 desktop operation system.\n3. my jdk installation path (64 bit version) /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk\n\n\nA: It turns out that, all I need to do is download the self extracting 32 bit jdk version package for ubuntu and install it in any location of choice which should be different from the one current 64 bit version is sitting (In my case I put it in /opt/jvm/). Below is a step by step explanation of what I did to make it work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download relevant 32 bit version of jdk (I used java jdk-6u32-linux-i586.bin) found here\n\n*make it executable by running the following command\nchmod +x jdk-6u32-linux-i586.bin\n\n\n*extract this file by simply executing it (Remember it is self extracting). That is run the following command on terminal. (Make sure you are in the directory in which the file is stored).\n./jdk-6u32-linux-i586.bin \n\nNote: the contents will be extracted into directory(its name will be jdk1.6.0_32 in this case) which will be created in the current directory.\n\n*Copy the directory created in step 3 above into whatever location you want to install the jdk (in my case /opt/jvm). Note that you have to create jvm in opt if it is not yet created. See commands to use below.\nsudo mkdir /opt/jvm\nsudo cp -r jdk1.6.0_32\n\n\n*Edit /path-to-where-netbeans-is-installed/netbeans7.1/mobility/WTK2.5.2/bin/emulator and change the variable javapathtowtk  to point to newly installed jdk bin directory (that is in my case  it is as shown below).\n nano /home/willa/netbeans7.1/mobility/WTK2.5.2/bin/emulator\n\n #!/bin/sh\n javapathtowtk=/opt/jvm/jdk1.6.0_32/bin/\n\nSave and exit.

If possible, I wish to see them as answers. \nIt could even become a wiki for many users!\n\nA: Ofcourse that you can switch graphic cards but you need to log out at least, maybe have to reboot system. It's in catalyst(that means you need closed source driver from AMD) and it have not been working between catalysts 11.8(or 11.6?) and 12.1. However it works nowadays. If you have AMD + AMD cards, then I can confirm that it works(HP Probook 4535s). I've heard that there was some problem with AMD + Intel cards, but possibly problem is solved at the moment, so you don't have to worry about and give it a try.\n\nA: Linux drivers are not the same as Windows drivers, let alone that they work the same.

Few days back I have installed ecryptfs, created a private directory using it. Now my Ubuntu login became super slow. I have tried removing ecryptfs from Synaptic. I found It, it can not be deleted that way. Somewhere I have read about this command\necryptfs-setup-private --undo\n\nBut this command displays a rather confusing list of commands on terminal. I don't want to mess up my installation, neither want to loose my administrator account.\nNow my question is, how can I safely remove /home/user/Private (.Private) and remove ecryptfs encryption ?\n\nA: The removal procedure is documented in the ecryptfs-setup-private(1) utility, with the --undo option:\n$ ecryptfs-setup-private --undo\n\nIn the event that you want to remove your eCryptfs Private Directory setup,\nyou will need to very carefully perform the following actions manually:\n\n 1. Obtain your Private directory mountpoint\n   $ PRIVATE=`cat ~/.ecryptfs/Private.mnt 2>/dev/null || echo $HOME/Private`\n 2. Ensure that you have moved all relevant data out of your $PRIVATE directory\n 3. Unmount your encrypted private directory\n   $ ecryptfs-umount-private\n 4. Make your Private directory writable again\n   $ chmod 700 $PRIVATE\n 5. Remove $PRIVATE, ~/.Private, ~/.ecryptfs\n    Note: THIS IS VERY PERMANENT, BE VERY CAREFUL\n   $ rm -rf $PRIVATE ~/.Private ~/.ecryptfs\n 6. Uninstall the utilities (this is specific to your Linux distribution)\n   $ sudo apt-get remove ecryptfs-utils libecryptfs0\n\nFull disclosure: I am one of the authors and maintainers of eCryptfs.\n\nA: Actually ecryptfs tells you very specifically what to do when you run ecryptfs-setup-private --undo, just follow its instructions.\n\nObtain your Private directory mountpoint\n$ PRIVATE=`cat ~/.ecryptfs/Private.mnt 2>/dev/null || echo $HOME/Private`\n\n\nThis command populates the $PRIVATE variable with the path to your private directory. Either the path is stored in ~/.ecryptfs/Private.mnt file (where ~ is your home directory) or if the file doesn't exist, it will fall back to ~/Private path.\nYou can then run echo $PRIVATE command to verify content of the PRIVATE variable.\nWhen you see $PRIVATE in the following commands, it will be substituted with the contents of the variable, ~/Private in your case.\n\nEnsure that you have moved all relevant data out of your $PRIVATE directory\n\nThis is important.\n\nUnmount your encrypted private directory\n$ ecryptfs-umount-private\n\n\neCryptFS is kind of a filesystem which is mounted in user space (Wikipedia explains what's mounting about. That's also the reason why the Private folder cannot be removed so easily. Think of it as kind of proxy which transparently encrypts and decrypts your files. This command un-mounts the folder which effectively disables the encryption. \n\nMake your Private directory writable again\n$ chmod 700 $PRIVATE\n\n\nchmod sets file permissions. In this case, you say: \"make file/directory stored in $PRIVATE readable, writable and executable for me (700)\" – you can't otherwise delete the directory since you don't have write access. \n\nRemove $PRIVATE, ~/.Private, ~/.ecryptfs\nNote: THIS IS VERY PERMANENT, BE VERY CAREFUL\n$ rm -rf $PRIVATE ~/.Private ~/.ecryptfs\n\n\nThis does exactly what it says. rm command means ReMove, -r means recursive (to recursively remove directories), and f means Force (\"stop nagging me, just delete it\"). This will remove all these three directories: $PRIVATE, ~/.Private, ~/.ecryptfs\nIf you want to, you can remove these directories manually from Nautilus (just check \"View > Show hidden files\" to see .Private and .ecryptfs directories in your home dir).\n\nUninstall the utilities (this is specific to your Linux distribution)\n$ sudo apt-get remove ecryptfs-utils libecryptfs0\n\n\nThis will remove ecryptfs-utils and libecryptfs0. You can do this from Synaptic instead or just ignore it if you want to keep eCryptFS around (e.g. for other users).\nIf you follow these instructions, there's no risk of wrecking your system or losing your files – unless, of course, you don't backup your files from ~/Private directory.\n\nA: I followed the instructions given in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory#Using%20in%20conjunction%20with%20Auto-login in the section \"How to Remove an Encrypted Private Directory Setup\".\nNotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*You must be logged in the correct user session, I mean the one you don`t want to be encrypted.\n\n*BACKUP all the data in your Private folder (/home/your-user-name/Private normally.\n\n*Delete ecryptfs (step 5) is optional, with the previous steps it`s ok.\n\n\nIf you don`t have access to the data in your Private folder, or the file names are encrypted, then follow this steps:\nNote: This procedure is an alternative I found by myself (with a friend help) because all I read in forums doesn`t work for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*$ sudo ecryptfs-recover-private\n\n*$ [sudo] password for \"user-name\"\n\n*$ INFO: Searching for encrypted private directories (this might take a while)...\n\n*INFO: Found [/home/.ecryptfs/\"user-name\"/.Private].\n\n*Try to recover this directory?

Private data mounted read-only at [/tmp/ecryptfs.yyyyyyyy].\n\n*$ sudo nautilus /tmp/ecryptfs.yyyyyyyy/\n\n\nThe last command will open the folder /tmp/ecryptfs.yyyyyyyy were you can acess your decrypted data in order to make the backup. Then you close the folder and close the terminal.\n", "Q: Upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 failed I upgraded from Ubuntu 11.10 to 12.04 using the update manager. At the end of the upgrade the console said the upgrade had failed and it forced me to restart. \nAfter a restart I am not able to do anything other than logging in. I just see a blue screen with the Ubuntu one icon. I can open applications, but nothing beyond that. I opened the terminal but after that I cannot enter anything - no keyboard input works.\nBasically the laptop has been rendered useless. Any pointers on how to recover?\nThis is on a Dell Inspiron 1501 laptop with a 64 bit AMD Sempron Processor.\n\nA: You need to download the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS  .ISO file, burn it to a CD, boot it, and the installer will take it from there. \nIt should recognize that Ubuntu is already installed and thus let you perform an upgrade from the CD.\nIf this is not the case and it wants you to to a fresh install, you will need to backup your files in your home partition.  You can also do this from the CD, I suggest you \"Try without installing\" to boot into Ubuntu so you can back up your files [located at /home/USER].\nAlso if you don't want to burn a CD and have a spare flash drive [with nothing you don't mind losing], you can use the program UNetbootin to copy the .ISO to the flash drive and make it bootable.\n\nA: Use imageburn to burn, best download from torrent, unless the image downloaded comes with a md5 file.\nSome details that many omit, but can decide whether it will install or not.\n", "Q: Flattening PDF transparency I have a PDF, made with Inkscape, that uses transparent colors. This image shall be used in a LaTeX document.\nWhile preserving the transparency is nice for editing, it can be a problem for printing. Printing usually involves PDF to PS conversion. Since Postscript does not support transparency, this requires either\n\n\n*\n\n*flatting, i.e. creating a vector graphic that works without transparency\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*rastering, i.e. rendering a bitmap image.\n\n\nWhen a PDF document containing such a figure is printed (or converted to PS) using Evince (or Cairo or Ghostscript), the whole page gets rendered as a bitmap, rendering fonts ugly (different from other pages). (Adobe Acrobat handles such PDFs well.)\nUnfortunately, converting the PDF figures to EPS (before including them with LaTeX) doesn't help much, because both pdftops and pdf2ps (again, Cairo or Ghostscript) rasterize the image, i.e. render a bitmap (saved as EPS). (This is slightly better, because it doesn't affect the whole page, but I'd still prefer a vector graphics.)\nHow can I flatten transparency with Inkscape or other software on Linux?\n\nA: One way around bad rasterization is to manually convert your PDF document to postscript because when you invoke CUPS through evince or whatever gui, it will be converted anyways.\nYou can try pdftops -r 1200 document.pdf to increase the resolution from the low default of 300, and then print the resulting postscript. However, with the printers at work this did not yield a significant improvement. Regular text on pages with and without transparent images still looked different -- blurry vs. clear.\nSo I ended up using Acrobat Professional (on a windows machine) to flatten the transparent images used in my latex document, which gave optimal results. Check that Transparency Flattener Preset is at [High Resolution] in the advanced print setup.\nMy colleague mentioned that one could perhaps FTP a pdf file directly to a modern laserjet network printer, bypassing the postscript conversion. I have not tried this.\nWould be great to have linux-only solution to this issue.\n\nA: I had the same problem and this is my solution (for future reference):\nI tried a lot of things, and so far the best working solution that I found on the internet was rendering the PDF completely as an image with pdf2ps and ps2pdf13, but the result wasn't satisfactory for me, because all vector shapes were lost. I wanted to render only the critical parts, but retain the vector graphics.\nWhat did the trick for me was to isolate all critical parts in inkscape and putting them on a separate layer (in my images this was all the shadows). I made only this layer (and the background layer) visible and exported it to PNG, effectively rendering all transparency effects, but only them. I imported it back and used it in a new layer. After flipping all layer visibilities (transparency layer: off, all others: on), the exported PDF worked perfectly with LaTeX and was printable without rendering the whole page as image.\nTL;DR:\n\n\n*\n\n*Isolate all problematic transparencies to one layer (transparency masks, shadows, etc.)\n\n*Make only the problematic layer & background visible\n\n*Export to PNG\n\n*Import the just created PNG and use as background\n\n*Make all layers visible except the problematic layer\n\n*Export to PDF\n\n*Smile :)\n\n\nA: I opened the pdf file using Ubuntu/ Gimp and printed one page at a time checking the print preview each time.  \n\nA: One way is to make a white box in Inkscape the same size as your page and send it to the bottom layer. This will export your image with a white background instead of a transparent one.\n\nA: pdftops -origpagesizes input.pdf output.ps\n\nthen\nps2pdf -r600x600 output.ps input-new.pdf\n\n", "Q: No suspend on lid closing on a Samsung Series 5 14\" NP530U4BI Ok, i realize I am not the only one, but I will try to provide all info possible to make it exemplary as possible and narrow down the error sources.\nI have a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 and the suspend worked fine upon having it freshly installed but now it does not anymore.\nThe suspend option from the system power button on the top right works fine.\nThings I did do which I don't know if they are related:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install and remove againthe FGLRX drivers (Radeon graphic card)\n\n*Install Jupiter power managment (shutting it down is not changin anything)\n\n*Plug in and out an external display\n\n\nThe configuration I know of is well set:\n\n\n*\n\n*In System Settings/Power all is set to suspend when closing lid\n\n*Double checked with dconf-editor, everything set to suspend\n\n\nSo, from here on I don't know how to proceed.. what are common problems that cause this error?\nEDIT:\nMy computer model is: Samsung Series 5 14\" NP530U4BI\n$ sudo lspci -nn\n00:00.0 Host bridge [0600]: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family DRAM Controller\n00:01.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200/2nd Generation Core Processor Family PCI Express Root Port \n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller \n00:16.0 Communication controller [0780]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family MEI Controller #1 \n00:1a.0 USB controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #2 \n00:1b.0 Audio device [0403]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 1 \n00:1c.3 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 4 \n00:1c.4 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 5 \n00:1d.0 USB controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #1 \n00:1f.0 ISA bridge [0601]: Intel Corporation HM65 Express Chipset Family LPC Controller [8086:1c49] (rev 04)\n00:1f.2 SATA controller [0106]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family 6 port SATA AHCI Controller \n00:1f.3 SMBus [0c05]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family SMBus Controller [8086:1c22] (rev 04)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Thames [Radeon 7500M/7600M Series]\n02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6230\n03:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

But most of these parameters such as /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy keep getting reset. I have inspected some of my log files and it seems that pm-powersave false is executed on each boot (from /var/log/pm-powersave.log)\nHow can I prevent this from executing on each boot?\n\nA: pm-powersave is a utility to manage the power-saving configuration of the computer when it is connected to the AC and when it works on battery. You should make the changes you desire to the pm-powersave config files (for AC/Battery respectively). You can find more information about the issue here.\nIn my case, as I want to save as much energy as possible in both cases (AC/Battery), I copied the files from /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d to /etc/pm/power.d and edited them to always work like in battery mode. At the end of each file, functions are called in depending of the received value (true for battery and false for AC). So, I replaced all AC function with the ones for battery. Then I added the script in the link above, with some modifications (not so aggresive) and replaced again the AC function calling with the Battery one.\n", "Q: Bash runs executable fine in 10.04 but not in 11.10 or 12.04 First post, but I come here often and this is the first time I haven't found the answer already posted, so I registered.\nI have a simple binary executable that runs fine in 10.04.\n./buds\nOpening serial device '/dev/ttyS0' (19200,8N1)...OK\nCreating PTY device...OK\nSetting PTY device '/dev/pts/1' (115200,8N1)...OK\nStartup complete, waiting for commands...\n\nBut does not in 11.10 Live CD or 12.04 under VirtualBox:\ncd Test\nls\nbuds\n./buds\nbash: ./buds: No such file or directory\n\nI've made sure that buds is executable and that I have permissions:\nchris@chris-VirtualBox:~$ ls -l buds\n\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 chris chris 26240 Jun 22  2010 buds\nfile buds \nbuds: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, BuildID[sha1]=0xf8f0b93813114695c72203bdc1bcf47163553eab, stripped \n\nldd buds\nnot a dynamic executable \n\nYikes!\n\nA: Looks like that your binary was built for 32-bit systems.

When I get back to my computer and the screen is turned on again, it's silent again.\nObviously I can't see what's happening when the screen is off, but leaving top open in a terminal window, I see that compiz is taking 50+% of cpu right after the screen is turned on again. This seems quite an excessive load for compiz, given that the screen is off :).\nIt quickly goes down to about 5% after that. There are spikes up to about 25% during normal use, but no excessive fan whirring noise.\nAdditional info: I have a Sony Vaio laptop with an i5 processor and an ATI Radeon video card.

Most firmwares let you do this by pressing F2, F10, F12, or some other key at boot time. (Look for a prompt about this or consult your manual.) With any luck, you'll see two options for how to boot your CD, one in BIOS mode and one in EFI/UEFI mode. They aren't likely to be labelled this logically, though; you might see something like \"Boot CD\" and \"Boot CD (UEFI shell)\". Try both of those options.

If you right click on the network manager icon and then select 'Edit Connections...' the window will open and you can select which connection you would like to edit. Once you get into that window go to 'IPv4 Settings' or IPv6 Settings' (depending on your network). Then you can change from Automatic(DHCP) to 'Manual', then you can put your settings in for a static IP address. That might get you up and running. Also it would be wise to look at how it is set up in Windows. If it is set to use a static IP in Windows then you may need to set it up like that in Ubuntu. That is what I would do.

Why does this happen, and how can I fix it? \n\n\nA: it is indeed a different font. the fonts you are using do not include that character, so Ubuntu switched to one that contain that font. to fix this ~ switch to font that include all the character you need.\n\nA: To get the nice fonts, install the Language Support for Chinese Simplified/Traditional, like what is described in this guide: http://pinyinjoe.com/linux/ubuntu-12-chinese-setup.htm\nAs an aside, iirc several versions back the Chinese text will just show up as ???, so in a way whatever fallback font that is being used now (some said it was Dejavu) can be considered an improvement since that time.\n", "Q: Can't block touchpad on a Toshiba c660 I recently updated to ubuntu 12.04 and I can't enable/disable my laptop touchpad. \nIt's a bug ? \nI have a Toshiba c660 .

Right now with windows 7 i have 102gb free space (total 119gb) I am going to create a partition for ubuntu. But i dont know how much space do i have to allocate to it. Also i have an externall hdd which i keep my large files in it. Is there a possibility to create a /home partition in that hdd? /home partition keeps user data (downloads etc) i think and i dont want to waster my ssd's space for it. Also i have 16gb ram equipped. Do i have to create a partition for swap area? Finally, is it also necessary to create /boot partition? Thank you.\nAhhh forgot to tell. How much do i have to allocate for \"/\" also?\n\nA: I would advise you to leave sufficient space for Windows 7 - it grows larger and larger as you use it. It seems to me that 30 gigabytes is ideal. (larger if you intend to install some other softwares) Ubuntu doesn't really need a dedicated partition to mount /boot; if you want to make everything as simple as possible, I would suggest: \n\n\n*\n\n*/: A fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.04 takes approximately 5 gigabytes on /, so if you are not planning to get a lot of softwares then you don't need too much space allocated for it. \n\n*/swap: The common size of this partition = 0.5 * size of the memory, but I see you have some 16 gigabytes of RAM ... Ubuntu itself doesn't produce that much stuff, so just for fun, 2~4 gigabytes.\n\n*/home: theoritically this is where you should allocate the most space (But as gajdipajti says, you do not need a seperate partition. If you do not specify this during installation then these stuff would be put onto /) . However as you're saying, you prefer to put this on your external hdd. I advise otherwise. You may allocate some 4~8 gigabytes for /home on ssd, and create symlinks to link whatever you put on your external hdd. \n\nA: You will need 12-14 GB for /, and 1 GB for swap (swap is always needed) You won't need a separate /home partition (it would be a waste of space, just keep everything together.\nYou could always mount the windows and the external partition for your files.\nAnd after install you will need to lower the reserved space: sudo tune2fs -m 1 /dev/sda2 If your ubuntu partition is /dev/sda2 you could check it with the df -T command.\nUpdate: First you shrink from windows, it will be safer. Then boot to ubuntu install, and from there you can create the rest. Root and swap.\nA fresh ubuntu install will use 3,5 GB. But after some updates and more software it will go up to 5-6 GB. but you will need space for the files in /home.\n", "Q: Hardlink or Symlink a portable HDD as Webroot?

Tell me how Ubuntu One handles security. Is my data encrypted when stored on Ubuntu servers? Who holds the key? Do Ubuntu One employees have access to my data?  \n\nA: From the Ubuntu One FAQ :\n\nWhat security and privacy policies does Ubuntu One have?\nData transmission - We use both SSL and secure certificates to deliver Ubuntu One services in a secure manner. Secure certificates ensure that you are communicating with Ubuntu One and SSL encrypts the transmission of all subscriber data. This data include files, notes, and all other data backed-up and synchronized through your personal cloud. SSL is good enough for banks so it should be good enough for us.\nTo authenticate the desktop software, we use oauth. This means that the desktop has a token that passes to the server to validate it. This enables subscribers to authenticate many computers independently and remove access from any one machine just by going to the Ubuntu One website.\nWe do not store your files encrypted in our data storage since we need them unencrypted in order to send them to the people you choose to share with. If you are concerned about storing your files unencrypted in the Ubuntu One cloud, you could always store the files already encrypted so Ubuntu One never sees the plain text files. Doing so may prevent the proper functionality of some Ubuntu One features such as multiple computer synchronization, web browser access, and sharing with others.\nAdditional details can be found in the Ubuntu One Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\nPersonal data - Ubuntu One uses the Ubuntu Single Sign On service for user authentication.

I'm very grateful for any assistance in this matter.\n\nA: A live usb is like carrying a portable operating system. You can plug in , do your task. All your changes are saved (but not in live cd as cd is read only memory).But following this will damage the usb very quickly as running an OS uses large number of read and write.\nYou can setup your computer to duel boot with windows. In this way you can choose either operating system when your computer boots up. Once you are in one OS, you have to reboot to go to other OS. You can't change OS without rebooting.\nThere are two way to install ubuntu with windows xp.\nSafest Way \nInstall using wubi installer. In this way ubuntu will be installed as a program in windows and you can easily remove it if require. (But remember you have to Reboot when changing OS)\nThe other way\nDefragment your C: drive.\nBoot using usb or cd. Choose to install ubuntu alongside windows. Ubuntu will shrink windows partition and install ubuntu.

Now vpn works and I can make modifications.\n", "Q: How to Boot with no splash screen Ubuntu 11.10 desktop up to date (Gnome 3)\nTo prevent answers in haste, please notice that\n\n\n*\n\n*GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\" is set in /etc/default/grub\n\n*Tried also GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"acpi=off\"\nThis removes most of the Ubuntu splash screen and shows most of the messages.\nHowever, just after the BIOS launches the Operating system, Ubuntu starts by \"preparing\" the splash: the screen is ubuntu-colored for about 1 second (plain color, looks somewhat like the default color after a login). During this 1 second some messages are displayed that cannot be seen.\nI wouldn't care much, but unfortunately during 50% of the boots, and during this very second, Ubuntu asks something... don't know what since I cannot see the messages. So I do Control-D (tried ^D once and it worked, so I keep doing it again) and the messages page is back and immediately cleared (the messages before the ^D can be seen for a split second - i.e. can't see them) and Ubuntu resumes the boot normally.\nUnfortunately dmesg doesn't show what was asked during that second. Nothing in the logs. But I'd like to know what happens. So the question:\nIs there a way to prevent that pre-splash colored page that hides the messages for 1 second to appear? \n\nA: Try adding noplymouth to that line, then updating grub with sudo update-grub.\nOn the second thought, if you just want to see what it says, try the recovery option from Grub.\n", "Q: Inconsistent GTK theming since upgrade I've upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04.  I was using Gnome-Shell in 11.10 and still am on the current install.\nI've noticed an inconsistency between the themes of applications - some appear black whilst others appear white, like this:\n\nNautilus is appearing in the white theme, whilst Movie Player is in black.\nAdwaita is the theme that's selected for the GTK+ and Window themes.\n\nA: If you look at the Ambiance theme, the theme-ing of nautilus requires a separate .css file or specific theming.  Look at /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/nautilus.css to see it.  \nYou would need to copy that and correct the values for Adwaita.  \nNot all themes being completely converted for all the special cases with Gtk3 is probably why they are disabled by default.  \nEdit: I took a look at Adwaita and it's movie player that's not conforming.  I had it backwards, but the point remains the same.  You can add a totem.css to correct it.\n", "Q: Midi files not working on Rhythmbox  nor VLC \n*\n\n*Rhythmbox 2.96 doesn't run any midi file on Ubuntu 12.04, even after installing GStreamer and Ubuntu Restricted Extras.\n\n*Rhythmbox-Message: Missing plugin: gstreamer|0.10|rhythmbox-metadata|audio/midi decoder|decoder-audio/midi\n\n*[0xb5504e40] main decoder error: no suitable decoder module for fourcc `MIDI'. VLC probably does not support this sound or video format.\n\nA: Usually audio-players do not support playing midi file, that strictly speaking are not audio files.\nYou can play midi file through a MIDI software synthesizer, like Timidity or Fluidsynth.\nIn the Rhythmbox FAQ you find the following question:\n\nCan I use MIDI files with Rhythmbox?\nRhythmbox uses the GStreamer media framework for actual playback and a\nlot of other functionality, so in general Rhythmbox plays exactly\nthose formats that are supported by GStreamer. GStreamer, on the other\nhand, uses a plugin system where each format is supported by a plugin.\nThus, the formats supported by GStreamer (and Rhythmbox) depends on\nwhich plugins you have installed. Different distributions may ship\nwith a different set of plugins by default.\nTo look for plug-ins, go to\nhttp://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/ . The Wildmidi plugin\nworks fine with rhythmbox.\n\nso if you still want to use Rhythmbox for midi files, take a look at the mentioned Wildmidi project.\n\nA: You can play midi with VLC.

They simply don't open, no error dialogue whatsoever. \nI then try opening Ubuntu with an old Kernel (3.0.0-17), this time the games work as usual. I wonder if there was a problem during the Kernel installation. Is there a way to create a \"log\" to know what is going on when I launch a game in the new Kernel? If there is no solution for this, how can I make the old Kernel the default option in the bootloader so I don't have to look for it everytime? Thank you.\nNote: Both Kernels are generic-pae\n\nA: There is a problem with ptrace and WINE in Ubuntu 12.04 which affects some games, I think Steam is one of them.  If this is your problem there is a workaround.\nTo test this you can run the following command in a terminal to reset your ptrace value to 0\necho 0|sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope\n\nThen try running the games again and see if it will launch.  This fix will be reset the next time you start your computer so you will have to enter it everytime.\nI use Codeweavers Crossover version of WINE so I will give you the link that I have saved and can find easily but I did see the same answer in a WINE forum while researching this problem. \nWINE WORKAROUND\nI have to include a caveat here;  the link above will also give you a way to set ptrace permanently  but what I have read trying to understand this \"bug\" it may make your system less secure.  ptrace handles interactions between programs: ptrace=0 is more permissive than ptrace=1.

When I donload a torrent file in chromium, it starts with transmission. But I want it to save on downloads folder. Where can I configure it?

I recently re-installed my Mac OS X partition. This somehow messed up my entire partition scheme it seems.\nFirst I got dropped to the Grub rescue> prompt when trying to boot Ubuntu. I had never having seen it before and help command was not recognized, so I started googling. I ended up reading most of the grub recovery documentation. \nI made it boot by using the set command to set root and prefix variable, then loaded normal mode plugin and ran it. It Presented me with the normal grub boot menu, and I booted Ubuntu just fine.\nAs the documentation also states these changes are not permanent and I have to edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg - more specifically it states that I have to ensure variables search, linux and intrd variables.\nMy problem is with trying to edit this file, my Ubuntu installation fails to reboot. After some wait time, I shut it down the hard way. When I then try to boot again, i'm back at the grub rescue> prompt again...\nSo to make ubuntu boot I use these commands:\nset prefix=(hd0,gpt6)/boot/grub\nset root=(hd0,gpt6)\ninsmod normal\nnormal -> select ubuntu\n\nWhen editing /boot/grub/grub.cfg the section I'm supposed to edit I edit like this (I think it's the search line making the screw up, but i cannot figure out what i may delete):\nEDIT: REMOVED LINES TO MAKE THE EDITED LINES MORE READABLE!\nUnedited entry : \nset root='(hd0,gpt6)'\nsearch --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root ebba50e2-d298-4764-afb5-463c47532158\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-23-generic root=UUID=ebba50e2-d298-4764-afb5-463c47532158 ro acpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi=Linux  quiet splash pcie_aspm=force $vt_handoff\n    initrd  /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-23-generic\n\nEDITED entry:\nset root='(hd0,gpt6)'\nsearch --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root ebba50e2-d298-4764-afb5-463c47532158\necho    'Loading Linux 3.0.0-14-generic ...'\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-14-generic root=/dev/sda6 ro acpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi=Linux\necho    'Loading initial ramdisk ...'\ninitrd  /boot/initrd.img-3.0.0-14-generic\n\nI think that I edited the last section in (the Ubuntu recovery menu entry) correctly.

I finished installing and started my computer up, and BOOM, I no longer had a menu to choose my OS, only the rescue prompt. I started playing around, and I found out that the fix for me was simple:\nI just needed to set a different hard drive to boot from. This probably won't apply if you're using only one hard drive. Somehow, when I installed Ubuntu, the bootloader either got moved or the BIOS got changed, but I had to set the boot order differently to see my menu again. After that, I can now see my grub menu.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu go faster with Ubuntu 2D instead of Ubuntu 3D? I tried both Ubuntu 3D and 2D, and it looks as if it goes fast in both, except when I open the dash menu (in 3D), it goes too slow. If I resize the Dash, it goes a little slowly, but not too much.\nIs it normal? Will Ubuntu run faster with Ubuntu 2D (I don't like 2D, I like much more Ubuntu 3D)?\n\nA: I agree Unity 2d is faster. But essencially depends on how much memory do you have. I have solved an issue with my keyboard by switching to unity 2d. I had my keyboard taking up to four seconds before it showed what I typed, at first use - subsequently everything was fine. \n\nA: Theoretically, Ubuntu 2D could also be slower (no hardware acceleration, all the work is made by the CPU via software).\nPratically, if you're not running your Ubuntu on this www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm0POwEtiqE (that's fun, take a look at it) it will be faster.\n\nA: On my laptop, the 2D goes faster. It also consumes less power, so I prefer 2D more.\n\nA: Essential yes, your graphics card won't have to work as hard in 2d compared to 3d, which should quicken responsiveness.\n\nA: Graphically, it will go much quicker.   Computationally?  There's no real difference, if your CPU is being used as a fallback then you WILL notice the difference.

Co\n\nA: Most probably the sources.list has disabled the extension.\nThat is usual for upgrades as some of the apps may not be supported yet on the new release.\nBut from what i remember Chromium and Eclipse should not require there packages as they come added in ubuntu repos.\nCheck out here : vi /etc/apt/sources.list\nif you have the packages that you require.\nThe best option would be to find the package for 12.04 and use those.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Software Center 12.04 does not install software I am new to Ubuntu, and I have just installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a computer. I am using an automatic proxy server. When I select a software package to install and input my password, the progress icon displays for a few seconds, and then it stops. I tried to install different programs, and I always had the same problem. I can browse the web with Firefox, so I know I have a network connection. I do not see any errors or anything. What should I do? \n\nA: Here is a work around. Once you find a game you want to install, you can search for it in the terminal with (for example ** Super Tux):\napt-cache search Super Tux\n\nThen you can install one of the names it displays by for example:\nsudo apt-get install supertux\n\nIf you want to install a game from dotdeb.com for instance, you can open the terminal and type:\nsudo dpkg -i \n\nMake sure to leave a Space after the -i and then drag-and-drop the deb file you downloaded onto the terminal and press Enter.\n\nA: Just use synaptic package manager, even though it's not as fancy as the software center. To install it type: sudo apt-get install synaptic in the terminal.\n\nA: I had the same problem with software. It's probably a permission thing. \nOn my menu the command to open uses software-center with pkexec, which command without parameters defaults to superuser.

I'm guessing simply holding down the power button until it turns off is a bad idea, but I don't know what else to do that would get things moving again. \n(I couldn't find this question, but if it has already been asked and answered then a link would be helpful.)\nThanks!\n\nA: Update: I rebooted using the trick Robert mentioned. The system kept freezing while booting, so I rebooted again and immediately held down the left shift key to get kernel options, and chose recovery mode. From recovery mode I ran dpkg which finished the installation; I can now boot normally and it seems to work. \n\nA: This looks like a software failure, and you can try to power it down with the power button(hard reboot). If you are concerned about general FS, corruption, you can try the REISUB trick. Just hold down [ALT]+[SYSRQ]+[[KEY]], replacing [[KEY]] with R, then E, then I, then S, then U, then B, waiting a few seconds between each. If at the end it does not hard reset, use the power button. If you have issues after the reboot, try using dpkg -a or apt-get to remove any offending packages.\n", "Q: amd64 virtual machine in virtualbox I have ubuntu 12.04\n$ lsb_release -rc\nRelease:        12.04\nCodename:       precise\n$ uname -a \nLinux pablo-desktop 3.2.0-20-generic #33-Ubuntu SMP Tue Mar 27 16:42:26 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nI have installed virtualbox 4.2, I try make a virtual machine with debian amd64\nhttp://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/6.0.4/amd64/iso-cd/debian-6.0.4-amd64-netinst.iso\n\nbut only work with a debian i386\nhttp://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/6.0.4/i386/iso-cd/debian-6.0.4-i386-netinst.iso\n\nwhy?\n\nA: From your details I assume you run a 64-bit Ubuntu host, likely Ubuntu 12.04 beta.

And what can I do with this?\n\nA: I am just guessing here since Flash Player is a buggy binary blob – but high CPU load could mean that Flash Player is not using hardware acceleration. So, go to any YouTube video, open it in fullscreen (this is important due to weird bug in Flash Player in case you're using Unity 3D / Compiz), right click on video, select Settings… and make sure that Enable hardware acceleration is checked.\nYou could also try to delete Flash player's settings, you may however lose some \"important\" data like checkpoints in Flash games (data exclusively stored by Flash Player). Quit browser and delete/move away ~/.macromedia/Flash_Player directory with Nautilus or using this command:\nrm -r ~/.macromedia/Flash_Player\n\nAlso take a look if you have libvdpau1 package installed, this allows video players to use hardware video decoding. Flash Player uses this to some extent too, but it's buggy (under some conditions, videos on YouTube may have swapped blue and red colour channels).

So Identify the HD and then run this command to load grub to your mbr, I will use sda in this command make sure you use the letter for your HD,\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nThen run this to update grub and reboot and grub should show if the HD is first in the boot order in the bios.\nsudo update-grub\n\n----end of wilee-nilee's quote----\n(for clarity) last step = first give the command 'sudo update-grub', and after that reboot!\n(don't copy the numbers behind sda, sdb etc. : HD's 'identification' is just the three letters, without the number.\n\nA: I have the same problem.

It showed up but it doesn't let me choose which partition. I have 2 partition, C: which I have Windows 7 on with 58 GB of space and have E: with +900 GB. I want to setup Ubuntu on C not E. How to choose that, because it keep saying \"resizing\" and so on, and do not use this partition and I still don't understand how to pick C\n\nA: I think you don't quite get the concept of installing a new OS :)\nNormally, an operating system is not installed on the same partition as some other operating system - you need to create a \"partition\" on your disk; to make some space for a new partition you need to either delete an existing partition or resize/move existing partitions to free up some space. What you see as C and E drives in Windows are two partitions formatted as NTFS - they're fine for Windows but you (generally) can not install Ubuntu on them. That's why the installer wants to resize the partitions.\nNow, there's one \"if\": Ubuntu, being an incredibly flexible system, has an additional mode, called \"wubi\", which via some trickery installs Ubuntu into a file which is located on one of the existing Windows partitions. This mode has some advantages (no need to create partitions) and possibly disadvantages. If that's what you want to do, you need to boot into Windows, insert Ubuntu USB and start the install process from there. See Wubi Guide for details.\nIf you boot from that USB into live Ubuntu environment, however, it will assume you want to install Ubuntu onto a separate partition. Be careful not to force it to install on your current C: drive in this mode as this will remove your current Windows installation.\nAs always - make sure you have a backup of all your important data.\n\nA: You cannot install two OS's onto the same partition. It is a universal computing law.\nWubi, as suggested as Sergey, is not a way to install on the same partition, rather just trickery that puts ubuntu in a file. However, many users do not like wubi (as it is slower than normal ubuntu). You will ENTIRELY REMOVE YOUR WINDOWS if you install on C (unless you use wubi).\nWhat you should do instead is resize E. Make a 100GB partition (lets call it U, for ubuntu). Install Ubuntu on U. This should work.\nA detailed guide can be found here.\n", "Q: How do I report a bug if I have no internet or USB or mouse on my machine?

After getting the required dependencies using sudo apt-get build-dep gcc-4.7-base, I checked out the 4.7.0 tag of gcc in Subversion and started building it.\nOn my 64-bit laptop, the build (configured with --disable-multilib --enable-libstdcxx-time=rt --enable-languages=c,c++) failed to find files related to libc6-dev despite that package being installed. I was only able to fix the issues by soft linking /usr/lib64 to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu at the suggestion of a StackOverflow post. After that, gcc built successfully and seems to work fine after install.\nMy 32-bit desktop system was another story. I had the same initial problem where libc6-dev files couldn't be found by the gcc build chain. In the end I had to export the following environment variables in order for it to build correctly (the idea was taken from here):\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/\nexport C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu\nexport CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu\n\nHoping that had solved my issues, I went to try the newly installed gcc build out, at which point it instantly failed on the first project I tried it on (building the latest version of vim from source). It failed to find the same files the gcc build failed to find, and issued the following message before failing in a flurry of errors:\n\nHmm, sed is very pessimistic about your system header files.   But\n  it did not dump core -- strange! Let's continue carefully...   If this\n  fails, you may want to remove offending lines from osdef.h   or try\n  with an empty osdef.h file, if your compiler can do without   function\n  declarations.\n\nWhen I took this sob story to the gcc IRC channel, several people there expressed frustration at Ubuntu and told me these errors were caused by Ubuntu 12 changing long-standing paths to files.\nCould anyone shed some light on this?\n\nA: As I said in my comment, the problem is not a bug in either GCC or Ubuntu, but rather an incompatible feature: multiarch. The point of multiarch is to allow binaries for multiple architectures to be installed in the same file system at the same time without collisions. This will replace the old 32-bit vs. 64-bit libraries system that used to exist, but is really more important where we want to have both Intel and ARM installed at once, for example. Presumably this isn't terribly interesting for desktop computers, but Ubuntu exists in many embedded devices (or will do) that might do this sort of thing.\nMaking changes like this naturally results in files being moved around, so we can expect some disruptions during the switch-over period. GCC currently does not support the new locations yet, but it will do, eventually.\nStarting from a standard desktop install, these set-up steps allowed the build to work for me:\namd64 (I tested this one):\nsudo -i\n# apt-get install libppl0.11-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev libc6-dev-i386\n# cd /usr/include\n# ln -s x86_64-linux-gnu/* .\n# cd /usr/lib\n# ln -s x86_64-linux-gnu/crt* .\n\nI see you're using 32-bit Ubuntu. I've not tested this, but I've made the obvious changes.\nix86:\nsudo -i\n# apt-get install libppl0.11-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev libc6-dev\n# cd /usr/include\n# ln -s i386-linux-gnu/* .\n# cd /usr/lib\n# ln -s i386-linux-gnu/crt* .\n\nWARNING: inserting the soft links are usually harmless, for most people, but could well cause you problems further down the line.

I didn't know it was not for Intel system until I checked the file name this morning.  The file name is ubuntu-12.04-server-amd64.iso, so it is for AMD system.  The web site does not say anything about system architecture, why doesn't it?\nWhere could I download one for Intel system?\n\nA: AMD64 is AMD's name for its x86-64 instruction set extension. Intel uses this too. The amd64.iso is also sutable for 64bit x86 processors built by Intel.\nDetails here\n", "Q: How can I restore the activity monitor?  \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat can replace system monitoring in the top Gnome Panel in Unity? \n\nI was wondering if its still possible to get the Activity Monitor for things like load and ram usage like you used to be able to on 10.04 LTS. \nI noticed that all them disappeared after the upgrade to 12.04, now all I get is the File, Edit menu buttons on that bar is there a way to add to this section of the menu bar?\n\n\nA: Install Indicator Multiload:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:indicator-multiload/stable-daily\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-multiload\n\nNetwork, memory and cpu usage indicator; this is a port of the original System Monitor GNOME Panel applet (gnome-system-monitor applet).\n\nIn Preferences you can customize the output to fit it to your desktop theme:\n", "Q: Upgraded to 12.04 LTS now computer is unusable I used the \"Upgrade\" option to install 12.04 LTS on a laptop from 11.10.\nThe installation completed and after rebooting I have these issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*login screen displays but all icons are missing\n\n*mouse/trackpad does not work at all\n\n*I can log in \n\n*after logging in the desktop is black\n\n*no icons appear in the left sidebar\n\n*all icons are missing in the desktop\n\n*pressing the \"Windows\" key brings up the dash home\n\n*search is working\n\n*can search for 'terminal' which brings up a terminal window\n\n*terminal window is unresponsive and I can't type any commands there\n\n*CTRL-ALT-F2 causes a black screen to be shown\n\n*an external mouse or keyboard, or an external monitor does not connect\n\n*restarting with no external devices connected makes no difference\n\n\nThe computer has a switchable intel graphics card.

When I instaltitleled 12.04 it will start up but on sign in,  the screen either goes black or shows the background with no Unity / Dash controls.  To resolve this I restarted and then selected 2D mode.  Now it works fine.  I would prefer the 3D mode but it will not work. I think it is an issue with COMPIZ because If I Right Click on the screen and get the Change Desktop Background to bring up system settings,  NONE of the windows have a title bar or control box.  This has been a COMPIZ issue in the past.  Anyway,  try 2D mode and I believe it may work for you too. \n", "Q: How to remove the reflection in Docky?

For some applications its fairly easy enough to locate where the application was installed to using the \"which\" command.  However, some applications such as Tomcat are a little out of my league to locate.\nI'm asking for particular methodology that can be applied to any apt-get install  to locate where the binary, library, and support files are installed to.\nThe cause of this question is that I installed Tomcat7 and I can's seem to locate it and I have a list of customizations to perform.\n\nA: What I usually do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Synaptic (you will need to install it first)\n\n*find the package I'm interested in\n\n*right click, select Properties\n\n*view the list of installed files\n\nA: You can list the contents of an installed package with the dpkg command, which is the low-level package manipulation command that the APT tools call internally:\ndpkg -L tomcat7\n\nYou may want to search in the output; use the grep command. For example, to see the configuration files (which live under /etc):\ndpkg -L tomcat7 | grep /etc\n\nThe files you want to modify may be in dependencies of the main tomcat7 package. Searching inside a package and its dependencies is more complicated. It's likely that the files you're looking for are in some package called tomcat7-something. The easiest way to display them is with the apt-file command, which is not installed by default (install it with apt-get install apt-file).\napt-file list tomcat7\n\napt-file lists file names in all packages in Ubuntu (according to the package sources you have enabled), whether they are installed or not. You can also use it to search for a file:\n$ apt-file search RequestInfoExample.java\ntomcat7-examples: /usr/share/tomcat7-examples/examples/WEB-INF/classes/RequestInfoExample.java\n\n\nA: You can run the command dpkg -L package to list all the files in the package. For example dpkg -L ubuntu-minimal will only list a couple of small files related to packaging, as it is only an empty meta-package that depends on other packages.\ndpkg -L tomcat7\n\nis probably what you want.\n\nA: I see many responses rightly saying \"dpkg -L \" is the command for listing content of an installed package. But, none of them have answered the other question, why does \"which\" command list empty for some of the packages? The answer is; \"which\" displays the location of an executable alone, not all the content of the package. In case, a package does not contains any executable, then \"which\" display empty. For example, openssl package provides an executable with the same name for various cryptographic operations. Whereas, libssl-dev package contains development lib, not any executable.\n", "Q: 11.10 is not Upgrading My Ubuntu 11.10 is not getting upgraded through Update Manager.

Because these drivers cannot be found, you are going to have a tough time getting a GUI on the computer, and even when you do it's gong to be glitchy and unreliable. Your best bet in this case is to boot to the Ubuntu Live CD and transfer any files you want to keep to an external hard drive or flash drive, then reinstall Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How do I switch between Ubuntu and Vista and how do I delete Ubuntu? So I was wondering how do I switch between Windows Vista and Ubuntu? And also, if need to, how do I go about deleting Ubuntu?\n\nA: Once you install Ubuntu alongside Windows, when you restart you'll see a screen that offers you a choice to boot into Ubuntu or Windows.  That screen is the interface for the Linux bootloader known as Grub, which will be installed by default when you install Ubuntu.\nRemoval of Ubuntu, as czifro mentioned above, would be a simple matter of deleting or formatting the partition which contains it.\n\nA: to switch between winV and ubuntu you use the grub2 bootloader. and to delete ubuntu, simply (in winV) use disk utility (click start menu -> R click computer -> click manage) to either format the ubuntu partition, or delete it, both remove ubuntu.\n\nA: To delete Ubuntu from windows is easy, Click Start, click Run, type compmgmt.msc, and then click OK.In the console tree, click Disk Management. The Disk Management window appears. Now select the drive in which you have installed Ubuntu and format it. Thats it. But grub will still be there at the time of booting and it will show Ubuntu in it. Don't worry its just like a broken link!\n", "Q: How do I install Anything-sync-daemon? From the Arch Linux wiki:\n\nAnything-sync-daemon (asd) is a tiny shell script designed to manage target directories in tmpfs and to periodically sync them back to your physical disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished via a symlinking step and an innovative use of rsync to maintain back-up and synchronization between the two. One of the major design goals of asd is a completely transparent user experience.\n\nWhat would it take to use this in Ubuntu?\n\nA: It would take an upstart /etc/init conf script. The upstream repository now includes an Upstart init script designed specifically for Ubuntu.\ngoanysync is a program with similar\nfunctionality to asd and includes upstart init script and a pre-build deb \npackage for testing. Packaging it properly for Ubuntu should be quite easy.\nAlso just taking goanysyncs upstart conf file and using it with slight modification for asd should work.\n", "Q: How to partition external USB without losing data? I'm running Ubuntu 12.4 on a 8GB thumb drive. Every time I restart I lose my settings because I don't have enough room. So I want to install it on my 160GB external USB drive (FAT32). My issue is, I have over 100GB stored on it and have no where to back it up. So I want to partition only 40gig for the system install without losing any of the data already on USB. \nIs this possible?\n\nA: Use the gparted utility on the ubuntu live-cd to resize (shrink) your FAT32 partition. Resizing is possible without the loss of data. After you finish, you'll be having some free space for a partition for ubuntu installation.\n", "Q: Realtek High Definition Audio Codecs I've a Lenovo Y550 laptop with dual boot Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows &. I've installed Realtek High Definition Audio Codecs in windows installation. When I hear audio in Ubuntu it has less effect than Windows. In Ubuntu I am using the default installation settings. Is there anything I can do to make it better?\n\nA: go to http://www.realtek.com/downloads/ and download the driver for UNIX/Linux\nThen go to the downloaded location and extract the file. \nInside that folder, there's a file named INSTALL, double click it and when prompted click run in terminal.\nFinally Reboot. \n\nA: go to http://152.104.125.41/downloads/ and select High Definition Audio Codecs (Software) you find the driver for Linux which is about to 4.5 MB in size. you can find complete installation guide on in the compressed folder.\n\nA: Open Sound settings and check Allow louder than 100% .\nYou will get the issue fixed.\n\nA: This particular thread need a lot of updating.\nIn the instructions for the codec we are making the codec to install it, there is no simple \"install\" there.\nAnd when we make the codec we have to use some command \"./configure\" which my 21.04 Ubuntu doesn't even recognize at all.\nHope someone with a lot more knowledge of Linux than myself updates this thread because I could really use this driver since my system is making weird noises when I turn up the audio to certain levels. To me PulseAudio is the problem and is trash.

Video hangs and gets interrupted frequently and it is impossible to watch movies. I have installed Nvidia accelerated graphics driver(version current) which is the recommended one from Ubuntu. \nWhat should I do to make things same as that of Windows ?\n\nA: I'm not sure what video player you are using, but I'd recommend using VLC as it includes it's own codecs, and therefore handles just about any video format.  \nYou can install VLC by going into Ubuntu Software Center, searching for VLC, then click Install.\nAlternatively you can make sure you've installed all the correct codecs by going into a terminal window and typing:\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-ffmpeg\n\n", "Q: Desktop distorted after installing Nvidia drivers I just started using Ubuntu for the first time about an hour ago so please bear with me.

I was forced to remove Windows 7 from my HP dv6 because of the max four partitions already being there. I didn't lose anything, all backed up. However, now I am looking to create another partition and install Windows 7 on it. \nDo I also need some sort of boot loader that lets me choose which to boot?\n\nA: NOTE: Have a Linux distribution (Ubuntu) on a live CD handy before following the steps below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create partitions for Windows 7 using GParted in Ubuntu.\n\n*Boot the Windows 7 disk and install it on the partition created in the previous step. (Windows will not provide you with the option of choosing Ubuntu). So Ubuntu would seem unusable.\n\n*Recover Ubuntu by using a live CD (or live USB) and following the steps mentioned in Ask Ubuntu question Recovering GRUB after installing Windows 7 (at the end, you should have the option of choosing the operating system from the GRUB menu.)\n\n\nA: *\n\n*use gParted to reduce Ubuntu partitions in order to create an empty NTFS partition (30Go~50Go at the start of the disk should be enough) that will receive Windows. \n\n*via gParted add a boot flag on this partition\n\n*Install Windows in this partition\n\n*Reinstall GRUB in the MBR (eg via Boot-Repair's Recommended Repair)\n\n\nA: It's easy to install dual OS, but if you install Windows after Ubuntu, Grub will be affected. Grub is a boot-loader for Linux base systems. You can follow the above steps or you can do just the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make space for your Windows from Ubuntu. (Use Disk Utility tools from ubuntu)\n\n*Install Windows on freed space.\n\n*After installing, login to windows \n\n\nTo fix this you can install 'EasyBCD' in Windows.\nDownload it here\n\nFollow these steps to restore GRUB when after installing EasyBCD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the program and select ADD NEW ENTRY from the EasyBCD Toolbox\n\n*Select the 'Linux/BSD' from the operating systems column\n\n*Choose GRUB (Legacy) under type and click on the ADD ENTRY icon\n\n*Choose YES to the restart prompt\n\n\nGRUB will be displayed after the restart and will detect the Ubuntu partition for you to be able to boot into Ubuntu.\n\nA: GRUB will let you boot into both OS's but installing Windows 7 after Ubuntu will remove GRUB from MBR, so you'll have to reinstall GRUB. Install Windows 7 on any partition of your choice and than follow this link to repair the GRUB. Unable to load Ubuntu after installing Windows\n\nA: Delete a partition from your current setup that refers to swap area, or linux swap. You'll be able to re-create and tune it later. Create a logical partition in place of the removed one. From now on, you'll be able to create more logical partitions. Fill the created partition with you Win-7 backup (if you don't have enough space for it, resize other partitions to free some space beforehand). Then boot Linux and do update-grub, that will detect your Win-7 partition and will put a line for booting to it in the boot menu. Then reboot into your system of choice - you're dual-booter now!\n\nA: Alternatively you could install virtual box and then loadup windows 7 as a VM:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\n", "Q: Will btrfs automatically compress existing files when compression is enabled? I chose btrfs as the format of my / filesystem in the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installer. After the installation completed, I added compress=lzo to the mount options in /etc/fstab and rebooted.\nWill the existing files be automatically compressed now, or must I explicitly do something to cause that to happen?\n\nA: I've made what Norbert Fabritius said, but I didn't notice any compression in the existing files - df -h / before btrfs fi defragment = 658MB | df -h / after btrfs fi defragment = 658MB. New files are ok. Searching a little bring me this quote:\n\nRunning this:\n# btrfs filesystem defragment ~/stuff\ndoes not defragment the contents of the directory.\nThis is by design. btrfs fi defrag operates on the single filesystem object passed to >it. This means that the command defragments just the metadata held by the directory >object, and not the contents of the directory. If you want to defragment the contents >of the directory, something like this would be more useful:\n# find -xdev -type f -exec btrfs fi defrag '{}' \\;\n\nAfter this, my / it's occupping 656MB - nothing huge, but certainly there is compression.\nSource: https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Problem_FAQ#Defragmenting_a_directory_doesn.27t_work\n\nA: According to Oracle's documentation, you can compress existing files on an existing, online filesystem by defragmenting each file in it with the -c, -clzo, or -czlib options. LZO is recommended for speed.\nfind / -xdev \\( -type f -o -type d \\) -exec btrfs filesystem defragment -v -clzo -- {} +\n\nThis uses the find command to run the btrfs defragmenter on every file in the root filesystem (given by the slash right after the \"find\" command at the beginning). If you have other subvolumes, you can use it again with the path of a subvolume (I have one at /home, for example) instead of the single slash.\nYou'll need root privileges for this, so add sudo to the front if you need to.\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E37355/html/ol_use_case1_btrfs.html\n\n*https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/UseCases#How_do_I_defragment_many_files.3F\n\nA: You will have to run btrfs fi defragment to force recompression of existing data. Otherwise, only new data will be compressed.\nFrom the FAQ:\n\n...consider remounting with -o compress, and either rewrite particular files in-place, or run btrfs fi defragment to recompress everything. This may take a while.\n\n\nA: According to https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Mount_options#List_of_options\nfollowing compression algorithms are available:\n\ncompress,compress-force\nEnable compression. Starting with kernel 2.6.38 you can choose the algorithm for compression:\n\n - compress=zlib - Better compression ratio. It's the default and safe for olders kernels.\n - compress=lzo - Faster compression.\n - compress=no - Disables compression (starting with kernel 3.6). \n\ncompress-force= - Enable compression even for files that don't compress well, like videos and dd images of disks. The options compress-force=zlib and compress-force=lzo works for kernels >2.6.38.\n\nNote that old (before 2012) btrfs-progs versions will probably fail some operations (e.g. fsck) on filesystems with LZO compression. \n\nNote: This post is answer for the additional question what type of compression algorithms are available which was asked below...so please don't blame me.\n\nA: According to ArchWiki:\n\nTip: Compression can also be enabled per-file without using the\n  compress mount option; simply apply chattr +c to the file. When\n  applied to directories, it will cause new files to be automatically\n  compressed as they come.\n\nVery nice! God bless BTRFS!\nAlso, from the BTRFS wiki:\n\nCan I force compression on a file without using the compress mount option?\nYes. The utility chattr supports setting file attribute c that\n  marks the inode to compress newly written data.\n\n", "Q: How to share files between Windows7(Guest) and Ubuntu 12.04(Host)?

I was wondering is it possible to choose what language or software to install with ubuntu 12.04 DVD, when we're installing it ?\n\nA: The default Setup CDs use the language you select in the setup dialog. After installation you can add or remove whatever you need (including language packs).\nIf you use an alternative Setup CD you should be able to customize the installation much more during setup but i don't remember if you can go down to individual package selection with these as well. At least you can select groups of packages like LAMP and so on.\n", "Q: DNS server address no longer stored in resolv.conf; where is it now? I sometimes switch DNS servers, using the NetworkManager indicator in the taskbar; this worked fine with previous versions, and actually works fine with 12.04, too, except for one thing:  I use Conky to display some system information, including the DNS address, and I noticed that it is now always displaying 127.0.0.1.\nI looked in resolv.conf, which is where it gets this address, and sure enough, that's what it always says.  I has a single line, with the admonishment not to edit the file by hand:\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\n\nThe only way I know to check the DNS server address now is to open the network manager GUI to check the info page.  So, where is this information stored now?\n\nA: Be aware that using nmcli may not always give you the full answer.\ne.g. if you use openconnect (or vpnc, presumably) to start a VPN, and if you have the resolvconf package installed (to take care of automatically managing /etc/resolv.conf), you'll find that it can still automatically insert the VPN's DNS settings into /etc/resolv.conf ahead of 127.0.0.1.\nIn this circumstance, just checking (e.g.) \"nmcli -f IP4 dev list\" won't give you the true current DNS list.\nNot sure if this scenario affects you, but figured it worth mentioning.\n\nA: The information is managed internally by Network Manager.  You can get this information on the command line using the included nmcli tool.\nYou can retrieve Network Manager's information for a particular network interface with the following command:\nnmcli dev list iface eth0\n\n(replace eth0 with the interface you are connecting with).  The output will include information about the interface and the currently active connection on that interface:\nGENERAL.DEVICE:                         eth0\nGENERAL.TYPE:                           802-3-ethernet\n...\nIP4.DNS[1]:                             192.168.0.1\n...\n\nIt shouldn't be too difficult to extract the information you are after from this output.\nIf you need a programmatic method of accessing this data that doesn't rely on the output of nmcli, this information should also be available from Network Manager's D-Bus interface.\n\nA: Ubuntu developers should document these changes in /etc/resolv.conf, but have not.\nHere is a list of quick commands to get you going.\n\n\n*\n\n*Show the current DNS servers\nnm-tool | grep DNS\n\n\n*Define a static DNS server in /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf. Add the following line, and restart local resolver:\nsupersede domain-search \"sub.mydomain.com\", \"domain.com\";\nprepend domain-name-servers 192.168.0.1;\n\nFrom the command prompt:\ninvoke-rc.d network-manager restart\n\n", "Q: Hang When Loading off USB, at command sysenter_do_call+0x12/0x28 I am trying to boot Ubuntu 12.04 from the live USB.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and I have a iPhone 4 with iOS 5.1 that I just recently jailbroke. I was wondering if there was anyway that I can sync my music to my iPhone?\n\nA: Ubuntu has never been iPhone friendly. Your best bet is to install VirtualBox with Windows XP and install iTunes.\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and syncing music to my iPhone through Google Play Music.  It's working very well.  Google Play has an Ubuntu music manager you can download at https://play.google.com/music/listen#manager_pl.  Using this application, I uploaded my entire iTunes library (up to 20,000 songs are free).  Then I installed the \"Melodies\" app on my iPhone to stream my music.  I like this app because it lets you save songs to your iPhone for offline listening.  Tip: Newer iTunes songs (.m4a files) are DRM-free, so they can be easily uploaded to Google Play.  Older iTunes songs (.m4p files) have DRM encoding and have to be converted first.  To make the conversion, I burned these songs to a CD using iTunes (be sure to check \"Include CD Text\") and then imported them back into iTunes.  There are other options to convert songs, but this was the easiest since I didn't have very many.       \n\nA: There is a library called libimobiledevice meant for this but it is supported upto 11.04\nBut you can try installing the older packages to try if it works(these are packages for 32 bit)  \nsudo apt-get install libgpod-common libgpod4 libimobiledevice1 libplist1 libusbmuxd1 usbmuxd\n\n", "Q: Do I need to install a desktop to run a nomachineNX server?

To display it you have to trigger it by pressing any key when the small logo  appears at the bottom of the screen. The Live CD/USB should stop booting and display the Advanced Boot Options menu shown below.\n\n\n\nThe main thing this page appears to provide is an easy way to allow you to boot with  common kernel options applied. You press the F6 key and use the space bar to select/unselect the option(s) you want to apply and then resume the boot.\n\n \n(By the way, have you already tried booting with the nomodeset kernel option? It seems to be a popular recommendation whenever video may be the problem.)\nThe F1 Help key displays a (nested) list of function keys showing the Live CD/USB version, boot methods, special boot parameters, and (dated?) hardware help information. I think it is mostly useful as a way to verify the release number and build date of the Live CD/USB you are booting. (It would be nice if it also mentioned whether it was 32-bit or 64-bit. Oh, well.)\nSince I am not that familiar with the various options, I'll stop here and just suggest you read the Ubuntu online help to learn more about them. (I would only be parroting what it says there.)\n\nReply to Comment @ 2012-05-03 05:21:43Z\nSo what I think you are saying is that when you used the example kernel options above, noapic, nolapic, and nomodeset then you were able to boot and successfully install Ubuntu. But when you try to boot the new install it proceeds to the \"the dotted boot loading screen\" but then \"the screen stays purple. and sits there\". Correct?\nIf so you probably just need to boot with (some of) the same kernel options used when you installed. \nThis is a two step process. First you test the various combinations of the kernel options to find out the minimum required. Second, you update your default GRUB configuration so that the needed kernel options are used in the future.\nI'm sure there are lots of questions that cover this, such as this one:\nHow do I add a kernel boot parameter?\nIt looks like a good answer, but I think there is a small error in it. So I am going to copy and \"enhance\" the first half here. You can get the second part, how to add the kernel options permanently by changing /etc/default/grub, from the original.\nHow To Temporarily Add a Kernel Boot Option to GRUB (based on this answer)\n\n\n*\n\n*Assume we want to add the kernel option nomodeset. (I use this as an example because it  may be the only kernel option you need.)\n\n*Start your system and wait for the GRUB menu.\n\nNote: If you don't see a GRUB menu, press and hold the Shift key right after starting the system.\n\n\n*Select the kernel you intend to boot and press the e key to edit its GRUB boot commands. You should see a list of commands like those in the example below.\n\nsetparams 'Ubuntu, with Linux 3.2.0-24-generic'\n\nrecordfail\ngfxmode $linux_gfx_mode\ninsmod gzio\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ext2\nset root='(hd0,msdos1)'\nsearch --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root bc6f8146-1523-46a6-8b6a-64b8\\\n19ccf2b7\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-24-generic root=UUID=bc6f8146-1523-46a6-8b\\\n6a-64b819ccf2b7 ro  quiet splash\ninitrd /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-24-generic\n\n\n\n*Change the second line from the bottom which ends with ro quiet splash.\nAdditional kernel option(s) are added at the end of this line.\nTo add nomodeset change   \n6a-64b819ccf2b7 ro  quiet splash to    \n6a-64b819ccf2b7 ro  quiet splash nomodeset\n\n*Now press either Ctrl+x or F10 to boot. The change will be used, but only for this boot. It is not permanent.\n\n\n\nI think that's it. Hope it helps!\n\nIf you're still following this, could you please post a status update of some kind. (I'm curious.)\nIf you find you must use the kernel boot parameter/option acpi=off, then you might also want to take a look at this answer for some suggestions on how to attempt to isolate the problem area and possibly file a bug report.\n\nA: If you can't boot without acpi = off and nolapic, that means that the ACPI on your computer is not supported by Ubuntu.\nA bonus if 10.04 worked!  Before Ubuntu 10.04 it had the driver to support the ACPI.  They removed the driver from 10.10 and beyond.\nSince you said that there are no other operating systems, you can disable the new card (BIOS) or disable ACPI (also from the BIOS). Use the second option if you can't find the New Card Interface.\nDon't try this on a Windows computer, though.  This might wreck Windows but it won't do any harm to Ubuntu.\nGood Luck!\nEdit: By the way, you don't have to reinstall Ubuntu after disabling the ACPI (If you didn't remove it.)\n\nA: ok I tested it on another machine and it seems like my machine was too old. it was a Pentium 2/ 450mhz.   Desktop requirements are min 700mhz.

So, I choose the Ignore option.\n\n*Issued: diskutil eject /dev/disk1 and restart with Option held down. \nNo USB drive shows up to boot from. Eventually I get an \"Unrecognized Disk\" error. I'm not surprised because my memory is that to get a bootable drive for a Mac requires some version of the correct OS X to be on the disk. \nYet, the folks who wrote these instructions would certainly know this fact -- yet their instructions don't work.\n\nA: Spent half the day on this but finally have a solution: The application unetbootin will quite happily open up the iso file, extract everything and create a bootable USB stick.\n\n\nA: I'm actually not surprised Ubuntu's instructions don't work for creating a bootbale USB for Mac. I thought about it some more and eventually figured out that these instructions were to create the bootable drive if you're using a Mac computer, and I know this because in Disk Utility, my 4 gigabyte Verbatim USB flash drive is formatted as MS DOS (FAT) with a partitioning map scheme of Master Boot Record which is not recognized as boot media under OS X.  So in short, the instructions are severely misleading, because any Mac user would likely assume these instructions would be for creating the bootable media to work with OS X, but it'd only work with Windows. What gives it away even more is Ubuntu's lack of regards for making the USB bootable through your operating system's native partitioning program, ergo, Disk Utility or Computer Management for Windows users.  At first I thought it was because they made the assumption you would know how to make the drive bootable (I didn't) but then I figured out why the guide was sorely lacking... Terminal does all the work for you. So I've since given up in making my USB bootable, it's clear that Mac computers are very closed sourced as far as software and hardware goes, Linux was always meant for PC computers, not Macs. \n", "Q: Logging in after sleep shows desktop prior to authentication screen On my laptop, if I close the lid (and perhaps at other times when I'm inactive or set the laptop to sleep manually), upon opening the lid, it'll display whatever was on the screen prior to sleeping, and then after a second or so, overlay this with the authentication screen to log back in.\nThis is on 12.04 (64-bit), but it also happened on 11.10 for me (Dell Studio 1558, 6gb ram, core i7 q720, 1gb radeon 5400 series).\nIs this a bug, or by design?

Right now, I would like to install the software that I have installed on my 10.04 in my 12.04 too. I was hoping there would be a workaround for this using aptonCD. But I figured out 'restoring' using apt on cd only copies the .debs into the cache file and that might mess things up for me considerably.\nThe rough idea that I have is :\n\n\n*\n\n*Run an 'apt' command on 10.04 that will give me all the package names that I have currently installed on my 10.04.\n\n*Bring those names to 12.04 and tell apt to fetch the same softwares, but the versions of them that belong to 12.04.\n\n*Install them.\n\n\nIs there anyway to do the above steps or is there a totally different way in which I can achieve this? \n\nA: this is one common way to duplicate a package set.

The password is correct- when I type in a wrong one, I am told it's incorrect, while the correct one is seemingly accepted, but then just takes me back to the login page.\nI can login as guest, but I can't do anything with the shell as it, too, doesn't accept my password.\n\nA: Answer from anonymous user: \n\nI have exactly the same problem and I fixed it by the following\n  solution (found here):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Press CTRL+ALT+F1\n  \n*Log in with you user name and password\n  \n*Run the following command: sudo chown -R $USER:$USER $HOME\n  \n*Press CTRL+ALT+F7\n  \n*Try to log in\n  \n\n\nA: Check if the user has the same userid (and groupid) as the files in the user's home directory. If the user has id 1000 and the files in the user's home directory have 1001, correct the user in the /etc/passwd file to userid 1001.\n\nA: Well, follow the instructions indicated here startx doesn't work \nI can't gurantee though that it will work for you as well.\nThat means:\n\n\n*\n\n*try to get a recovery console by using the shortcut Ctrl-Alt-F1.

My understanding of the problem is as follows.  It occurs if you encrypt you file system during the upgrade and you change the password.\nSolution.  login as guest.  go to user account control.  change the password of your normal user to the original password. log-off and log on with you normal user.  you should be able to log n now as the file are now decrypted.\nAt least i worked form me. \n\nA: What worked for me was to install byobu, that was enabled in 10.04 and unnistalled during upgrade, so that broke the graphical login (only errored in console).\n", "Q: Need USB drive to boot aspire one into Ubuntu I just installed 12.04 LTS onto my Acer Aspire One from a USB thumbdrive, and I cannot reboot unless I boot from the USB drive.

Steps to re-produce: \n\n\n*\n\n*From Ubuntu Unity desktop (I've experienced this is 11.10 and 12.04), start an NX session with a remote server\n\n*[do something in remote session (full screen)]\n\n*In remote session, minimise the window (I do this by clicking in top-right corner/hotspot)\n\n*[do something in local desktop for a bit], note grey '?' window icon for NX session in Unity task panel\n\n*Try to go back to remote session (goto 2). If you can't click remote session's icon in task panel, try ALT+TAB\n\n\nNow, on some occasions it will be no problem (seems that it always works first time, but not subsequently), and the window of the remote session will spring back into life. On other occasions there is only a tiny grey rectangle about 5 x 20 pixels that appears but doesn't allow me to re-activate the NX window. If this happens I need to go back to the menu and go through the steps to start a new session (thankfully however once it connects I am returned to the existing session).\nHere is a screenshot showing the grey rectangle, and you can also see the grey '?' icon in the task panel, with a pop-up title of 'HUD'.\n\nUpdate: I've now installed gnome-shell, and I get the same problem with that. First switch works well, but second one fails and I get the little grey rectangle. \n\nA: After the NX session has minimised you can get it back by exiting it. Find it's icon and quit. This causes the NX session to become full screen again but brings up the terminate / suspend / canel dialog inside the session.\nThis is a work around, not a fix, but it does allow you to continue with the same NX session.\n", "Q: nVidia 9800 GTX+ X11 fails to initialize. no unity or lightdm I have just upgraded my work pc to 12.04 (not upgrade, fresh install), installing updates during the install, and after everything has loaded (with no errors) and I restart I get brought to console 1 tty login.\nConsole 7 looks like this:\n\nIIRC I did not have to finagle with my drivers on 11.10 to get this card working. If this is in fact a driver bug I will remove this post and submit the bug but i'm not 100% confident that it is.\nI attempted to run unity --reset and got this:\n\nLastly I tried $ sudo apt-get install nvidia-current which tells me nvidia-current is already the newest version. so I ran $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure nvidia-current which says\n/usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure: nvidia-current is broken or not fully installed.

In the past, on another machine I had issues with my NIC driver being funky... downgraded to the previous driver and bam everything was merry and well.\n\nA: Disable the onboard video and go back to using the Nvidia card and boot to a command line.\nThen:\nMove your nvidia settings:\nmv ~/.nvidia-settings-rc ~/.nvidia-settings-rc.bak\n\nMove your xorg.conf:\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak\n\nRemove the driver completely:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-current\n\nReboot, then reinstall the driver:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nReboot again and have the driver generate a default config:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nReboot a final time and you should have a working X session.

When I was configuring my mobile broadband connection, the system found my usb dongle as \"huaway e173\", but with this setting was restarting. So I tried selecting \"any GSM device\" and now my 3g is working. All other setting are default as found by the manager.\n\nA: Did you enter the username and password when you created the connection? In the option to edit VODAFONE CONNECT you will find a tab called MOBILE BROADBAND where you have to put the username and password.\nYou can get the details of it by googling for it or from Vodafone Customer Care.  Or if that dongle uses an application in windows,in that application too, in settings you will find those details entered.\n\nA: I had the same issue and here is what worked for me:\nVodafone 3g pen k3805-z requires sudo ifconfig usb0 -arp prior to connecting to achieve connectivity.

Is there any way to manually set the shortcut key?\nThanks\n\nA: The reason it doesn't work when trying to set '+q' is because that combination is set for closing System Settings window. I would advise on not changing the keybinding for closing windows to '+q' as it should work for almost every application you open (I tried it on a few applications myself and it worked without me binding the keys to it).\nIf you still want to change it, I found this command to work the best:\ngconftool-2 -s /apps/metacity/window_keybindings/close -t string \"<keybinding here>\"\nFor example, if you wish to change the close binding to control+q, then you would do the following:\ngconftool-2 -s /apps/metacity/window_keybindings/close -t string \"<Control>q\"\nGo into System Settings >> Keyboard >> Shortcuts and look for the 'Window Close' binding which should now read Ctrl+Q\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: unity,  seeing all instances of same open application windows on all virtual desktop I noticed this strange issue with unity.

(.img) I'm a Windows/Mac/Ubuntu and Android user, so I know what I'm talking about, when I say: How do I open binary image files? (.img) They just won't open, on any OS…\nI'm an Android dev… I'm currently working on a ROM, (I also program, using Windows) but I need to extract files, from .img files. I've converted them to .ext4.img but they just aren't recognized by Linux (Definitly not by Android), by Mac OS or Windows. In other words, I can't open, extract or mount them.\nCan anyone help me? I'm kinda confused…\n\nA: Update: See stackoverflow.com - Mount Android emulator images\n\nShort Answer is, there are 3 types:\n\n\n*\n\n*Regular filesystem images, that can be mounted with -o loop option\n\n*YAFFS2 filesystem images, which currently cannot be mounted in Ubuntu and have to be unpacked\n\n*EXT4 filesystem images that have been further processed by the Android toolchain and need to be converted to regular images with simg2img from the Android toolchain.\n\n\n\nSo, you have a binary image extracted from an Android device, is that correct?\nWhat does the file command say about the file? Something like this?\n$ file system.img \nsystem.img: VMS Alpha executable\n\nThat system image is extracted via nandroid from a Samsung Galaxy i7500. Most of those old Android devices used yaffs as a file system. Knowing what you are dealing with greatly helps. (i.e. Which device are we talking about? Where is that image from?)\nConverting images into other file systems will only produce garbage at best if you do not have installed support for the file system in question. Unfortunately there is no package for Ubuntu. But that question has already been asked and answered: Create yaffs2 file system on Ubuntu Server 11.10\nThere is also the possibility that this image is encrypted. But why would someone give you an encrypted image?\nSince this is mostly about Android and you call yourself an Android Developer, please read the Android documentation, again. It's supposed to be all in there. If not ask your question at android.stackexchange.com, XDA-Developers, RootzWiki and the like. And please do not put a ROM on the net for hundreds of people to use unless you REALLY know what you are doing and you read the documentation. Doing it for fame is dangerous and bad for the users!\n\nA: for windows just mount the image through any virtual device program( like daemon tools) and for linux, mount the .img file like you mount other iso files:\n# mkdir -p /mnt/disk\n# mount -o loop disk.img /mnt/disk\n# cd /mnt/disk\n# ls -l\n\ndoes that help you?\n\nA: MTK Extractor can extract boot.img, system.img, system.new.dat, recovery.img files and perhaps other *.img.\nIt can also repack them back again.\nFor me it extracted a boot.img file that 7-zip couldn't read well but not broken or incomplete firmware images.\n\nA: You could you either use the Furius ISO Mount or the AcetoneISO to mount .img files, just search them on the ubuntu software centre and install them.\nFurius ISO Mount\nAcetoneISO\n\nA: It's a linux image file.

If I choose another image from my pictures, LightDM shows the default wallpaper. \nWhy is this happening, and how can I make LightDM show my wallpaper if it is not one of the defaults?\nAs @doug said in his answer, it works if you click on the little + symbol in the appearance settings: after you do that, LightDM changes wallpapers.\n\nA: I bet you use an encrypted home folder - which is readable not before you log in. What you can do is to copy your background image for instance to /usr/share/backgrounds (as root, i.e.: sudo cp ~/Pictures/backgroundimage.png /usr/share/backgrounds/) and set it as background image out of this un-encrypted folder.\n\nA: Not sure what the problem in LightDM really is but i solved this by scaling my wallpaper to my screens resolution. \nI moved them to /usr/share/backgrounds (location of the default wallpapers) as well. Not sure what did the trick but it works for me.\n\nA: Still works fine here, either from ~/Pictures, added from the dropdown or any other location, added from the little + under the wallpapers in Appearance window\nThe directory holding your chosen Background image must allow Others execute permission so maybe check the permissions of the folder holding your image\nEx. of the min necessary permissions\n$ ls -ld Pictures\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 doug doug 4096 Apr 30 00:02 Pictures\n\n\nA: I can confirm that it's not a matter of \"+\" button.

I've tested that and working.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to This answer to get help on changing lightdm wallpaper.\n\n*Follow all the commands begining from sudo -i to disable user background\n\n*Before the last command which sets the background image, Do this command\nexport $(dbus-launch)\n\nIt will say, no protocol specified but ignore those warning.\n\n*In the last command where you are going to change the wallpaper, use  full path. For example, I used this command to set a picture in my home directory\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter background '/home/anwar/Below_Clouds_by_kobinho.jpg' \n\nPlease note: Make sure to use ' mark in the start and end of location. \nThat's it. Logout to see your image.\n\nA: If your desktop wallpaper is in some other partition than the root, then it won't show up. The reason being that other partitions don't automatically get mounted, you mount them after you log in.\nI think copying the wallpaper in Pictures or Home directory should help.\n", "Q: How to install a driver for an NVIDIA card not detected by Additional Drivers?

Every time you update the kernel you will need to run the installer again. What happens is, every time Ubuntu auto updates the kernel and reboots, it complains and gets stuck. Don't panic. Simply drop to a console and run the installer again (Steps 6, 7, 8, and 9) when this happens.\n2) Open module blacklist as root:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\n3) Add these lines to the bottom of the file and save:\nblacklist vga16fb\nblacklist nouveau\nblacklist rivafb\nblacklist nvidiafb\nblacklist rivatv\n\n4) Uninstall any previously installed Nvidia drivers:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia-*\n\n5) Reboot your computer\n6) When an error message pops up saying that Ubuntu cannot load Nvidia drivers, choose Exit to terminal (Exit to console)\n6b) If it boots without error, try Ctrl+Alt+F1, login as yourself, sudo service gdm stop\n7) Install drivers (change REPLACE_ME accordingly):\ncd __REPLACE_ME__\nsudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-__REPLACE_ME__.run\n\n8) Answer the questions in the installer, follow-through, exit.\n9) Restart:\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nSource: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1467074\nPS: To uninstall, if ever, it's sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-__REPLACE_ME__.run --uninstall\n\nA: The output of sudo apt-get install mesa-utils && glxinfo | grep direct is direct rendering: Yes\nIt's working now ; I'm not sure why.

The typing gets reversed.\nI saw an earlier post for something similar, but it is closed and I think it was for the earlier Wine 1.3.  Supposedly Wine 1.4 has added RTL -- is there a way to get it working?\n\nA: If I recall correctly, you can use usp10.dll to make RTL fonts to display properly. This dll can be downloaded via winetricks. Also, if you install office using PlayOnLinux, this dll will be included by default.\nIf you want to make the RTL and LTR icons appear in office programs, you should first install Arabic, Herbew, ... language pack in Ubuntu, then you can run wine with proper LANG environment. For instance:\nLANG=en_us.utf-8 wine /path/to/office/executable\n\nreplace en_us.utf-8 with your desired language.\n\nA: Open up winetricks, \"select the default wine prefix\", \"Install a Windows DLL...\", usp10 and OK.\nAfter it finishes installation, open up \"configure wine\" (wineconfig), \"Libraries\" tab, \"New overrride for library\" (the drop-down menu), usp10, Add, now you should see it in the list below (Existing_overrides), select it and click \"Edit\", set it to \"Native\" and OK. \nThat's it.

There is ubuntu system installed.\nI am looking for solution that user will be force to click and confirm (once a hour) that someone uses computer. If he doesn't it computer automatically should do shutdown.\nIs there any solution for this problem ?\n\nA: One way to do this is to emulate a press of the power button. Then the following dialog will pop up, and shut down the computer after 60 seconds.\n\nTo do this, use acpi_fakekey 116 which will \"press\" the shutdown button (number 116). (At least 116 is my shutdown button. If it fails on your machine,try installing evtest and run it while you press the button)\nTo automate this every hour, add it to roots crontab like this:\nsudo crontab -e and add the following line:\n0 *  *   *   *   /usr/bin/acpi_fakekey 116\nThis will press the button at the 0th minute of every hour of every day of every week of every month.\n\nA: That's a working script of what you want to do:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n   sleep 59m\n   zenity --question --text \"Are you using the pc (click anything)?\"&\n   zenity_id=$!\n   #the user has 1 minute to answer, otherwise PC will shut down\n   sleep 1m\n   if kill $zenity_id 2> /dev/null; then \n      #zenity was still running, shutdown the pc\n      dbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.gnome.SessionManager /org/gnome/SessionManager org.gnome.SessionManager.RequestShutdown\n   fi\ndone\n\nEvery once an hour it displays a pop-up asking 'Are you still here?', if the user clicks on something, then it doesn't shutdown for another one hour (in one hour the pop-up is shown again), but if more than 1 minute passes without interaction with the dialog, then the PC automatically shuts down.\nIn order to start this on startup, create a file with the above code and make it executable (right click->properties->permissions->allow executing file as program) and click on the power button to the top right of your screen, select startup applications and add this script.\n\nA: You could write a simple script using the command shutdown 0 after a prompt.\nI should add you can use the sleep command in a loop to realize the waiting.\n\nA: It seems tedious to make someone click a button every specified interval.\nYou could let gnome-screensaver work for you and check how long it's been running.\nIn a script, you could do something like the following:\n#!/bin/bash\n\npidof X || exit #not running X!\n\nexport DISPLAY=\":0\" # use current display\nDURATION=\"`gnome-screensaver-command -t | awk '{print $7}'`\"\n\nif [ $DURATION -gt 3600 ]; then #idle for an hour\n  shutdown -h now\nfi\n\nThis is a VERY basic example that anyone could expand on.  Place it in a cron job or run it in a daemon mode with while/sleep calls.\nI would not use it exactly as-is, but just to illustrate a method.  This makes the assumption we're using gnome-screensaver.  xscreensaver has similar calls.\n", "Q: how can I set the threshold cursor velocity for passing through the Ubuntu menu bar? I am running with dual monitors (left and right) via ATI Catalyst Display Manager, not Xinerama.  Both monitors have a vertical Ubuntu menu bar on the left.

It will pass through only if the cursor is traveling at a high velocity.  Can I lower the threshold velocity and how?\n\nA: If you set the value of /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/stop_velocity to 1 in gconf, using gconf-editor or gconftool-2, it will give you the desired result. You would have to be moving the mouse extremely slowly to have it stop, with this setting.

It is perfect for testing new OS releases before you wipe out the old one, either through separate LV's or through snapshots.\nI use:\n- /         2GB - more than enough, 1GB should do just as well.\n- /var     10GB - you want some extra space here to accomodate updates/installation filess\n- /var/log  5GB - you don't want applications to crash because of logfiles growing harder than you expected.\n- /usr     10GB - this is where all your applications install\n- /home     8GB - I have this on a different disk *and* I have extra filesystems for special directories eg. mail, music, iso-files, ...\n- /tmp     50GB - I regulary do some fiddling with large temporary data files...\n\nThere is not really a good or a bad, it all depends on what you do and how much money you can spend. \n=> Keep in mind that extending a file system is easy, whereas shrinking it is difficult.\n\nA: I personally use one large partition.  Back in the day, as a UNIX admin, we would painstakingly assign custom partition sizes for /home /usr/ /var /tmp , etc., but with the size of disks today, I don't think it's necessary at all.    (And we used striping and disk redundancy through RAID, but I've seen enough problems with it that I now typically just run my own backups on data I care about.)\nTo me, LVM is unnecessary overhead, and I don't want to use it with volume encryption. \nHere's a good serverfault question om the topic: \nLVM Dangers and Caveats\nIf you've got more than one disk, you can certainly start to look at optimizing reads and writes there. \n(If any of these are no longer valid, I'd love for anyone to chime in.)\nAlso see:\nAdvanced Partitioning Question (asked Mar 29 at 14:00)\nAdvice on partitioning (\nasked Jul 1 '11 at 18:17 )\nWhat's your recommendation on drive partitioning schemes for a desktop and home server?

I tried with the live cd to ubuntu 12.04 and sadly, the touch-screen don't work. I would like to install 12.04, but don't want to lose the touch-screen.\n\nA: I have the same device on which I installed ub 12.04 (64 bits), I also asked a question about it a while ago. For me also the touchscreen does not work from the live CD. You need to install, then update the system, and then remove a certain section from a Xorg configuration file to make things \"work\". \nSee here my question and the solution: Mouse selects everything on its own\n(I do not guarantee that it will work for you. Also I do not multitouch, just singletouch. The device should however be able to do multitouch.)\n\nA: Looks like it was affected by this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/913164\nMust be fixed in linux 3.2.0-24.37. Search the page for \"3008\" to get an additional info.\n\nA: Same thing with 12.04 and LXDE, eeepc 701 with eGalaxy touchscreen, seems solved with the update in this ppa via Ubuntu Tweak: \"xorg-edgers fresh X crack\", which installed the package xserver-xorg-core 2:1.12.3+git20120709.\n", "Q: can't enter in ubuntu 12.04 After I have upgrade to ubuntu 12.04, two days ago, I can't enter.

Left-clicking on the space does not launch transmission.  Why don't I have a launchable icon of Transmission in my launcher?  \n\nA: I think that you can open a terminal  and use this command:\nunity --replace &\nto restart unity without reboot or  logout from the session.

Because I am developing for Android, however, I have to install the ADT Plugin within Eclipse by going to Help > Install new software (or something to that effect).  Now, I do understand that I can update Eclipse through the actual Ubuntu software center/system, but in order to update plugins and extensions within Eclipse, I have to go to Help > Check for Updates (which then scans all plugins for updates).  The only issue, is that when I installed through the software center, the owner became root, and whenever I run it without root, I'm not able to update - I get the error message \"Insufficient access privileges to apply this update.\"  When I run it as root, all of my plugins disappear, because I guess I installed them as myself, not as root.  I tried to install the plugins as root, but the Install New Software choice would not work.\nUbuntu 12.04 and Eclipse 3.7.2-1\n\nA: The best solution is to become root using su or by logging in as the root user from the start, if you have that ability (Ubuntu users don't, unless they fixed that defect).  Anyhow, once you are root, do a chown -R user:group to the path for your eclipse installation.\nThen your regular user should be able to install plugins.  In the future, do not install eclipse as the root user.  Root can still use eclipse when another user installs it and owns it.\n\nA: Finally fixed the issue by completely uninstalling Eclipse using Synaptic, and then reinstalling.  Once reinstalled, I opened it up as root to update the platform and other upgrade-able software.  I then closed it and opened it up as a normal user to install the ADT Plugin.  This way, the plugin shows during normal sessions, and can be updated in normal sessions, and if I want to update another component of the Eclipse system, I can launch it as root.\n\nA: To add up on @Garry's answer, what I did is create a \"dev\" group, add my user to it, and chgrp -R dev <eclipse dir>. You might want to chmod -R g+w <eclipse dir> as well to make sure you can write to it.\n", "Q: Compiz ( or even compositing in general) is not starting up when I login. Solution?

How can I install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS exaclty where I have Ubuntu 10.04 LTS now without changing/affecting anything else?\n\nA: Install 12.04 on the partition that you have 10.04 on. However, you will lose all your installed softwares in 10.04. If you don't want that, you will have to go for a distro upgrade. But that might result in a lot of problems which you can find on this site itself.

Perhaps you could just install a fresh longside copy and then copy what you need from the home folder in the old installation.\n\nA: Not a GRUB problem, since it starts to boot.  I've had this problem in the past due to video driver changes, usually when trying to install or, more likely, uninstall a proprietary driver and having some problem.  The fix was very easy once I discovered the problem.  I replaced the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf with the default.  Last time it happened, there were several backups, named xorg.conf.xxxxx  with xxxxx being backup names like original-1, fglrx-0, etc.\nIf you have backups dated before your upgrade, you could try renaming the current file, then copying one of the backups to the original name.  You'll need to use sudo, of course, to do this.\nThe default with no proprietary driver is under 10 lines.  I have one for AMD/ATI video, which you could use if you have that.  If you have nVidia, I might be able to find one of them in my other computer.\nI think you can generate this file by entering the command dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, but I haven't used that in a long time, so I'm not sure if it still works.  Actually, I'm not 100% sure if it ever worked. :)\nYou can do this from a virtual terminal.  Can't hurt anything if you're careful, and it beats reinstalling - something I rarely have done.\n\nA: The posts I think you're mentioning about Grub are likely trying to get you to disable the splash screen so you can see what the system is doing (or try to) when it stops booting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold left-Shift after BIOS (tapping is required on some laptops)\n\n*With the first entry selected, press E to edit the boot settings.\n\n*Remove the words splash and quiet from the linux line.\n\n*ControlX to boot with those settings.\n\n\nThese settings will only run this boot so if you need to see the boot log in the future, you'll have to run through that again.\nIf you can get to a login prompt, that suggests the issue is graphical.

If so, disable them and try again.\nIf it is none of the above, Firefox uses the current desktop theme for its colors (including the scroll bar). Try switching your current desktop theme to the default--or at least to something different--to see if the problem is corrected.\n\nA: Firefox 73.0\nThe appearance of the Firefox scrollbars can be changed by creating a new gtk.css in the Firefox profile folder. For me this is located at ~snap/firefox/323/.config/gtk-3.0 , but it may have a different location if you don't have a snap version.\nThe gtk.css file should contain the following code to allow you to adjust the appearance of both the vertical and horizontal sliders:\nscrollbar.vertical slider {\n/* Slider dimensions */\n\nmin-width: 12px;\nmin-height: 70px;\n\n/* Curvature top and bottom of the slider */\n\nborder-radius: 12px;\n\n/* Padding around the slider */\n\nborder: 4px solid transparent;\n\n/* Colour of the slider */\n\nbackground-color: #666699;\n\n}\nscrollbar.horizontal slider {\n/* Slider dimensions */\n\nmin-width: 70px;    \nmin-height: 12px;\n\n/* Curvature top and bottom of the slider */\n\nborder-radius: 12px;\n\n/* Padding around the slider */\n\nborder: 4px solid transparent;\n\n/* Colour of the slider */\n\nbackground-color: #666699;\n\n}\nJust play around with the values until you find something you like.

Ubuntu version is 10.10 and the laptop is Lenovo W520. A monitor is connected to the laptop through VGA. Display works under Window 7. But under Ubuntu, System->Preferences->Monitors only sees the laptop, not external monitor. How to switch and display on the external monitor? Thanks!\n\nA: I used to use this.. I tried it now on 12.04 with Gnome Shell 3.4 and it worked. Just connect your external monitor, place it wherever you want (top, left, right..) and in terminal run this command:\nxrandr --output VGA1 --primary\n\nI hope it is what you're looking for.\n\nA: Try to look for a hardware switch or function key on your laptop. The icon will usually look like a rectangle with two vertical line on the outside.\n\nA: I had the same problem with a (2007) Dell laptop with an Nvidia card. I already moved from the open source Nouveau drivers to nvidia-current propriety drivers for performance reasons, but Ubuntu (12.10) didn't recognize my external VGA monitor.\nBut after I switched to nvidia-current-updates it instantly displayed Ubuntu on my external monitor after reboot. \nYou can find this in Software Sources, if you have an ATI card you'll likely find something similar:\n[since I have no reputation points I obviously cannot post an image!!]\n\nA: Two options are using the comand line disper tool, and using the graphical jupiter applet.  There is also an indicator applet that has been built for disper.\nThe caveat I'd give for those is that they don't reliably work all the time for me. \nDepending on your graphics card, you may be able to use a tool like nvidia-settings or settings for Catalyst/ATI. \nAlso see : \nHow can I toggle between single and dual monitor setup?\n\nA: If you want a hardware solution, take apart the computer, find the display connector (usually flat with a black cable) and unplug it from the mobo. This will force the primary display to be external\n", "Q: Flash Player not present in Chrome So I recently upgraded to 12.04 (even though I hate Unity), and after the installation froze and my computer would no longer boot, after booting from a USB stick and installing 12.04 fresh, I downloaded Chrome. However, Flash Player (which is supposed to be built in) is not present. \nWhenever I try to watch a video, I get a notification to install flash player, and the most help that Adobe's website gives is this technote\nHowever, when I go to , there is no result for Flash except for this entry under the table for MIME types for the vlc plugin:\nvideo/flv Flash video .flv\nI'd be grateful for any ideas.\n\nA: Google Chrome for 64 bit does not come with Flash (see bug report).  Chrome (64 bit) will try and use the Flash it finds on your system, but if you don't have it, then you need to install it.\n\nA: Using the Ubuntu Software Center, search for Adobe Flash plugin.  The plugin works for Firefox, Chromium, SeaMonkey, etc...\n", "Q: Jabber chat room user list missing? I'm using Empathy to join a Jabber chat room. I have this setup on two Ubuntu machines, both running 12.04. To the right of the chat window should be a list of all the users currently in the chat room, but on one of my machines this list isn't there. How can I get it to appear?\nClosing/reopening the chat room or rebooting don't make any difference. There are no menu or configuration options that I can see to control whether or not this list is shown.\n\nA: It turns out the user list was there, just resized down so much as to make it completely invisible. The fix was to mouseover the side of the window until the drag handle appeared, allowing me to expand it.\n", "Q: How to make Ubuntu not to lock the screen while running VMware in fullscreen? I am running Windows XP inside VMware Player. I have two monitors and I keep VMware in fullscreen on the second monitor.\nThe problem is that if I work long enough in inside Windows XP, Ubuntu locks the screen as if I was idle. Once that happens I need to enter my password in order to return to the desktop on the other monitor.\nIs there a way to fix or workaround this problem without disabling screensaver lock in Ubuntu temporarily or permanently?\n\nA: I think installing Caffeine could help you. It's a nice application which blocks your PC from going to suspend/lock-screen/black-screen when selected applications are running.\nYou can install it like this (available for precise):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install caffeine\n\nAfter that just run the program. You will have a little indicator of a coffee mug in your panel. \n\n\nYou can manually activate Caffeine by clicking on the indicator and selecting \"Deactivate screensaver\" or you go to Preferences and select the applications for which it should activate itself automatically. It's also great for video players or Flash videos.\n\nYou can also read all about it on OMG!ubuntu.\n", "Q: Gnome-Network-Manager Config File Migration I think I have an issue with gnome-network-manager, I used to have a lot of connections configured, Wireless, Wired and VPN.

Double entries will get a UUID attached.\nBut as \"nm-applet\" search for old config via GConf you should make sure that \".gconf/system/networking/connections\" is really listed in it. So verify it with \"gconftool-2 --dump /system/networking/connections\", that should list all your connections.\nIn my case \".gconf/system/networking/connections\" wasn't available via GConf and therefore \"nm-applet\" could not migrate it. Therefore i created a new user on the system and copied my \".gconf/system/networking/connections\" to the new user's home and migrated it from this new login. To correct the wrong permission i used \"sudo sed -i \"s/permissions=user:NEWUSER/permissions=user:REALUSER/g\" /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*\" where REALUSER is obviously your real user and NEWUSER is the temporary migration user.\nAfter all while it's nice to finally have everything migrated to \"/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\", there are quite a few problems with the new storage location, you should be aware of:\n\n\n*\n\n*for reinstallations and backup cases you always need to save/move the new location, where formerly your /home was enough\n\n*your user only connections are no longer secured by your encrypted home directory\n\n*the are some security flaws, where passwords for user only connections are stored in clear text under /etc instead of being stored securely in the encrypted keyring\n\n\nA: It should be possible to recreate the gconf configuration on a new install.\nmkdir -p ~/.gconf/system/networking/connections\n\nRe-instate all the files from the old system. Remember to create empty %gconf.xml files in each directory. Restart gconfd. Then test by dumping the configuration using gconftool-2.\nOnce I'd done this, nm-applet could find and migrate the settings.\n\nA: You need to convert your settings in network-manager gui as a system connection, which is available to all users. In this case you will get your settings in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ . After that just copy the contents of that directory to new system and restart network-manager or reboot your system.\n", "Q: How to see which accounts contain unread e-mails when they are not expanded? In earlier versions of Thunderbird you knew which account folders had incoming e-mails even when they are not expanded. Usually the mailbox icon left beside the e-mail-address account changed and showed a little green arrow.\nNow this is totally stupid, the icons doesn't change when there are any incoming e-mails. You get a notification, but I even want to see which mailbox have incoming e-mails. Otherwise I need to expand all my e-mail accounts and I don't have so much space on view. \nI already tried another theme, but same result. I already tried to disable the default extensions but it didn't help. Any suggestions? \n\nA: Ok, it's really a theme issue. Obviously many themes suck and don't display that, but I found a theme which does.\n", "Q: Ubuntu raid configuration lost after reboot I have a JMicron raid controller on the motherboard, and I have a menu in which I can set RAID arrays when the system boots. I've set it to RAID-1 and added my two identical 2TB disks (the OS disk is separate).\nIn Ubuntu, in the Disk Utility, I could see these 2 hard disks and I could see an additional entry under Peripheral devices which was a 2TB disk. I assumed that this is some sort of a virtual view over my RAID array.\nI used the Format Volume option to format (NTFS) the 2TB disk listed under Peripheral devices. It appeared as a mounted device in the /media/data_raid. I've copied most of the files there and it worked fine.\nI've rebooted the system, and now I suddenly see an additional 3 disks in peripheral devices, which doesn't make sense.

I have just upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04 so I have Rhythmbox installed by default. I don't mind to much, however I miss one thing from Banshee: \"file system queue\". \nIn Banshee, I had the option not to import a file opened via the file browser (or the dash). I can't find that option in Rhythmbox and I'd like to have it, since there are a lot of audio files which I don't want to have in my library. \nIs there any plugin or something like that? Thanks!\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge this is not a current function of Rythmbox.  If it plays a file, it will remember where it is so you can use it again.  Not sure why you'd not want this.\nUnless you are using removable media or a network share that is not always present, then you may wind up with files in your catalog that cannot be played.\nWhy not email the team upstream and request this function?  Be clear why you think it would be beneficial to the community, because you are asking someone to spend time to code this function it is good if you have a compelling reason.\n", "Q: Lower level of wireless signal on an Intel Centrino Wireless-N + Wimax 6150 I am sitting next to my router and I don't see full wireless signal since I upgraded from ubuntu 11.04 64bit to ubuntu 12.04 \nand I noticed more battery usage in my laptop , since I upgraded .

It should basically just provide TeX Live and related tools. I figured now that I have almost 1GB of data under /usr/share/doc. I don't need this documentation in this case, just the LaTeX related man pages, which are not located there.\nIs there a way to uninstall all these documentation files using apt-get?\nAlternatively, is it reasonably save to just delete the content of /usr/share/doc?\nI like to share the Virtual Box machine with others, which shouldn't run in trouble.\n\nA: According to the Ubuntu wiki, you can instruct dpkg not to install any documentation. This should prevent any documentation (except copyright info) from being installed by apt.\n\nCreate a file /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/01_nodoc which specifies the\n  desired filters. Example:\npath-exclude /usr/share/doc/*\n# we need to keep copyright files for legal reasons\npath-include /usr/share/doc/*/copyright\n# if you also want to remove the man pages uncomment the next line\n#path-exclude /usr/share/man/*\npath-exclude /usr/share/groff/*\npath-exclude /usr/share/info/*\n# lintian stuff is small, but really unnecessary\npath-exclude /usr/share/lintian/*\npath-exclude /usr/share/linda/*\n\n\n\nThen you can manually remove any documentation already installed:\nfind /usr/share/doc -depth -type f ! -name copyright|xargs rm || true\nfind /usr/share/doc -empty|xargs rmdir || true\nrm -rf /usr/share/groff/* /usr/share/info/*\nrm -rf /usr/share/lintian/* /usr/share/linda/* /var/cache/man/*\n\nIf you also want to remove the man pages do:\nrm -rf /usr/share/man/*\n\nThe example is written for OEMs, but it worked just as well for me. Took my /usr/share/doc/ directory down from ~150MB to ~20MB.\n\nA: This should remove the documentation for latex-related packages:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove tex.\\*-doc$\n\nIt does save a few hundred MB.\n\nA: Do you know what is taking up all of that space? My /usr/share/doc is only ~50MB. If not, use the Disk Analyzer application or go to the terminal and run cd /usr/share/doc; then run du -h -d 1 to find out what is using all of that space. Once you know which program or program are the problem then you can decide if you should remove the directories in /usr/share/doc or not.\n\nA: Quick-and-dirty way to find the installed texlive packages (I'm 100% sure there are other ways):\ndpkg -l | grep '^ii.*texlive.*doc'\n\nAnd removing them:\napt-get remove --purge \\\n  texlive-fonts-recommended-doc texlive-latex-base-doc texlive-latex-extra-doc \\\n  texlive-latex-recommended-doc texlive-pictures-doc texlive-pstricks-doc\n\n\nA: A small modification to mopagemo's answer. If LaTeX was originally installed via texlive-full, then removing that metapackage will lead to all of its dependencies being added to the autoremove queue. To fix this, we need to flag the packages as manually installed.\nHere's a list of the steps I took to remove the docs and remove the desired packages from the autoremove queue:\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get --purge remove tex.\\*-doc$\n\n*Copy the packages that appear between \"The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required\" and \"Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.\" into a text editor, and remove all the new lines.\n\n*Try to sudo apt-get install all of these packages.\n\n*You will probably get a series of \"Unable to locate package\" messages. Remove these ghost packages from the list in your text editor.\n\n*Try sudo apt-get install again on the smaller list. This should flag all of the packages as manually installed.\n\n*You may get another \"no longer required\" message. If so, repeat steps 2--5.\n\nIt doesn't take long to do this, and the benefit is that you aren't breaking any existing packages or dependencies. You could even reinstall texlive-full over the top. You might want to keep a list of the flagged packages if you intend to uninstall completely at some point.\nThis freed up just over 1000 MB on my system.\n\nA: \nis it reasonably sa[f]e to just delete the content of /usr/share/doc?\n\nIf you do that, the files will get reinstalled when any of the packages get upgraded. You should instead remove the relevant documentation packages, which often (but not always) end in -doc.\n", "Q: Ubuntu slow after upgrade to 12.04 Precise I normally choose Ubuntu over Windows because speed and stability is something that's important to me. \nHowever, recently Ubuntu has been slower than Windows for me. I use two systems -- one netbook (for writing), and one Desktop (for production) -- that I've been using since Karmic Koala, and never formatted ever since; for ever release, I simply upgraded the OS and now I'm on Precise Pangolin. A lot of reviews say that Precise boosts performance of the system, but for me it's gotten slower than ever -- both the interface performance AND The startup. \nI also did a bit of cleanup, removing unwanted software and clearing the start-up menu, but that doesn't seem to help at all. On the netbook, I chose Unity2D, but even that has been buggy and slow for me. Along with slowness, I have also been experiencing other problems, though that is probably wise to keep for another question (the problems include repository errors, wacom pressure breakage, etc.)\nAny way I could speed the system up without the need to format it? \n\nDesktop: AMD Athlon x2, 3GB RAM DDR2, 9600gt GeForce\nNetbook: HP Mini, Intel Atom, 1GB RAM. \nEDIT:\nchu@chu-laptop:~$ top -Sbn1 | head -n20\ntop - 11:57:06 up 51 min,  1 user,  load average: 3.03, 2.00, 2.71\nTasks: 173 total,   1 running, 172 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie\nCpu(s): 44.4%us, 13.5%sy,  5.7%ni, 26.4%id,  9.8%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.2%si,  0.0%st\nMem:    988880k total,   914836k used,    74044k free,    37056k buffers\nSwap:  1951860k total,   160424k used,  1791436k free,   340268k cached\n\n  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND            \n   28 root      20   0     0    0    0 S    3  0.0   0:15.08 kswapd0            \n20577 chu       20   0  2832 1148  864 R    3  0.1   0:00.06 top                \n 4273 chu       20   0  862m 138m  23m S    2 14.3  18:13.77 firefox            \n 5903 chu       20   0  214m  26m  11m S    2  2.7   6:41.92 plugin-containe    \n20321 chu       20   0  227m  16m  11m S    2  1.7   0:02.53 gnome-terminal    \n    1 root      20   0  3644 1280  612 S    0  0.1   6:15.79 init              \n    2 root      20   0     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.00 kthreadd          \n    3 root      20   0     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:10.98 ksoftirqd/0        \n    6 root      RT   0     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.00 migration/0        \n    8 root      RT   0     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.00 migration/1        \n   10 root      20   0     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:13.35 ksoftirqd/1        \n   13 root       0 -20     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.00 cpuset            \n   14 root       0 -20     0    0    0 S    0  0.0   0:00.00 khelper  \n\nchu@chu-laptop:~$ dstat 60 5\nYou did not select any stats, using -cdngy by default.\n----total-cpu-usage---- -dsk/total- -net/total- ---paging-- ---system--\nusr sys idl wai hiq siq| read  writ| recv  send|  in   out | int   csw\n 47  13  29  10   0   0|1072k  238k|   0     0 |  18k   44k|1175  2299\n 16   6  64  14   0   0|1224k   89k| 440B  471B|6622B 2048B| 890  1801\n 37  10  50   3   0   0| 199k   65k|  15k 2660B|  10k    0 |1175  2134\n 35   9  47   9   0   0|1207k   97k| 592B  302B|  28k   95k|1255  2105\n 26  10  14  49   0   0|1985k  645k|1049B  575B|  54k  635k|1295  2133  missed 8\n 49  11  36   4   0   0| 367k   37k|  24k 1910B|  58k    0 |1129  1969\n\n\nA: I see a lot waitio, both in top (9.8%wa) and in dstat (up to 49%). I also see you have swap in use, possibly being the reason for the high iowait numbers. Your machine is slow because it is waiting for the swapping memory to and from disk.\nYou have only 1GB installed RAM, that is a bit low for a full blown Ubuntu install. Adding memory to your system will help, or consider using a lighter distribution (Lubuntu/Xubuntu/... I don't know them all).\nUsing lighter applications (eg. instead of Firefox) will also help.\n\nA: You could add some options to the fstab, such as noatime, which improve hard drive performance. The effect of this, however, is quite small. What does make quite a difference, as I see your desktop computer has a relatively generous amount of RAM, is to install preload. Just type:\nsudo apt-get install preload\nin the Terminal. This wil load often-used data in RAM, so load times improve. I did happen to notice 12.04 is a little slower on my computer as well, but I'm not sure if that's due to the system itself or the fact I switched to btrfs as filesystem.\n\nA: I just upgraded my 11.10, and experienced a big performance drop, especially in games.\nI searched a bit and it struck my mind that I had experienced the same performance drop after upgrading to 11.10 from 11.04, and I solved it by turning off the fancy visual effects. It worked this time too!\n\nA: Doing the CUBE is a huge drain on my system, I say leave ubuntu as is and dont add the visual effects to your system. Go back and change that back to the default and that should speed things up real fast.\n\nA: My eee PC works well with 11.10 but it as 2Gb RAM.

I have to use Advanced Settings (Gnome Tweak tool) to select themes from the home folder to get the theme working correctly.  \nWhen I review the selected Theme in My Unity it places a big red X beside the selected theme name.  Themes installed in ~/.Themes DO NOT work correctly when selected in My Unity\nI resolved this by ignoring GTK3 installation instructions and copying the same theme folders to usr/share/themes using Sudo Nautilus. These themes work perfectly now when selected in My Unity.  Does anyone know why this behavior happens in My Unity (when themes are placed in ~/.Themes, and can it be fixed.  This is not machine specific as it happens on my daughters laptop as well.\n\nA: Firstly, you didn't say which user interface you use in Ubuntu: Gnome Shell with GNOME 3 or Unity. I'd say that MyUnity is supposed to be used with Unity, not the Gnome Shell. On the other hand, the Advanced Settings (Gnome Tweak Tool) is supposed to work with Gnome Shell.\nIn Forums I've read that GTK3 themes should work well both with Unity and Gnome Shell. A theme package can be extracted to ~/.themes directory, which means that it is accessible only by the current user, or to /usr/share/themes (you need admin rights for that), which is accessible by all users, but in both cases a theme should work the same.\nThe red X beside the theme name in MyUnity simply means that you can delete the theme (place the mouse pointer above the X to see a hint). It appears for themes installed in ~/.themes directory.\n", "Q: How can I download archive of ubuntu community documentation so that i can use it offline?

Is there any chance to pair my thinkpad (ubuntu) with my machine (ubuntu) via bluetooth? \n\nA: It is a very easy task and I had no problems with a bluethooth keyboard (Thinkpad).\nA) You can use the \"add new device\" wizard of Ubuntus standard bluetoth wizard (indicator symbol or system settings). It gives you a number. This number you simply enter on your keyboard, an press enter.

Would a clean install work? Anyone have a suggestion? PS. I'm not that computer savvy, please explain like I'm five.\n\nA: I just got a issue similar like you. Like, I, whenever installs ubuntu from \"inside the windows\" using wubi, I could not connect to wireless and had no configuration for it at all. I figured out that my driver could not be found for wireless. Now when I installed ubuntu from outside the windows and made windows partition a secondary one, I got it correct automatically. I just used 'iwconfig` to test out if the configuration is automatically set and yes it was. So i will recommend you to get a fresh install of ubuntu from outside the windows operating system\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Synaptic Package Manager.\n\n*Uninstall bcmwl-kernel-source package.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nThis should cure the problem. :-)\n\nA: Yeah you could try a fresh install. If you pop in a live cd (cd with 12.04 burned on it) try and see if you can connect to wifi on the disk boot before making the decision to installing it. Note fresh install will delete everything, so backup anything you want to keep.\n\nA: I had an issue with my wireless as well - my issue specifically was that it kept dropping and reconnecting frequently. if this is what you're experiencing, just switch your wifi router to channel 1 (or any other channel except 6 or 11). you should be solid then.\n\nA: Dell Upgrade to 13.04 & 13.10 No wifi, graphic card driver and bluetooth Problem?

However, I've never done this before. I've used Ubuntu my whole life and am intending to continue to do so, so I'd like to make sure all the hardware works out of the box with Ubuntu - preferably even with open source drivers (i.e. without having to install proprietary drivers after installation). If that's not possible, then at least from a company making work of their Linux support.\nSo, what are things to watch out for? How best to approach this task? For example, which components are often most problematic -- i.e. which is best to start with? How can I be sure that each component plays nice with the rest?\n\nA: In the scope of this question & answer site I am certainly unable to give you recommendations on one or the other piece of hardware. This is even more so as there is constant development going on. What we said today may not hold true tomorrow. \nFrom my own experience in building my own boxes for several years now I have never had any unsolvable issue when it comes to Ubuntu compatibility. However there are some general thoughts you might want to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*The latest brand-new hardware may not yet be fully supported. It is better to choose  hardware that was around for some months.\n\n*Don't look for hardware that works, look for the rare cases that don't. Check the forums for issues with the one single specific piece of hardware you chose. If there weren't any it's probably safe to use.\n\n*Buy common hardwares rather than exotic ones if you have the choice.\n\n\nA: Among usual desktop hardware graphics cards, sound cards and wifi cards can cause trouble. Takkat put it very well in his answer.\nAs a general rule for assembling computers, I recommend to choose the shops where you order the parts wisely. Nothing creates more anger and causes delay than unfriendly, unhelpful and lazy customer support and refund policies. With quick refund policies and no shipping fees, you can just order the parts needed and iterate until your system is complete.\n\nA: I have built my own computer with Ubuntu, but alas, it has fallen into disrepair as it is very outdated, so I cannot give you my exact specs. However, I would use an ATI radeon video card, but not an ATI APU, like the Vision A4, as Nvidia(and A4) have severe display problems at times, and Intel does not work well in general. The open-source driver will work fine, but you may want to get flgrx if you are having issues with the open-source driver. I would use an AMD CPU, hopefully 64-bit as I have had no issues with them. You need as little as 20GB for Ubuntu, but I would go above and beyond as it is hard to get that small a hard disk. At least 2 GB of RAM would be good, although you could use LDXE or XFCE if you have performance issues.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 had been installed but bootstrapper only loaded Windows 7 I installed Ubuntu 12.04 with DVD, i used \"something else and divided hardisk into 2 partition, linuxwsp and / (root).

But having rebooted, Windows automatically started up and no GRUB was appeared.\nHow should I dot to fix this troubleshooting.\nSorry, my english is not so well. I'm very grateful for your answer.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot using a live cd of ubuntu.\n\n*Open a terminal and run the command\nsudo fdisk -l\nIt lists the complete partition table of the hard disk. In there, identify which partition you have got your linux installed on. You can identify it using the drive size you had allocated for it and looking at the last column of the output which will be ‘extended’ for all of your linux partitions. The partition will most probably be something like /dev/sda5 or something. Remember this partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a temporary folder in your home directory (Note: You can make the temporary folder anywhere you want. I’m using the home folder just for the sake of explanation). I’m calling it ‘temp’ for now. So that ‘temp’ folder’s path will be /home/ubuntu/temp.\n\n*Mount your linux partition there. That is, assuming that you found your linux partition to be /dev/sda5, you mount that at the ‘temp’ folder by doing the following command\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /home/ubuntu/temp\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to check whether you have mounted the correct partition, go to your home folder and open temp. You will be in the ‘/’ directory. In there you will find ‘home’, in which your home folder’s name will be there. Once you’ve confirmed you have mounted the correct partition, do step 6.\n\n*You have to install grub by showing the system where to read the data from the hard disk at the beginning. Don’t worry, just run the following command\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/home/ubuntu/temp /dev/sda\nThe ‘/dev/sda’ corresponds to your hard disk name. Replace it by whatever the command ‘sudo fdisk -l’ command showed you.\n\n\n*\n\n*You’re done.

I have a 1GB swap file which, when multitasking begins to fill up. When I have even a small amount of free swap, I have no issues, but the second the swap fills, the system locks up. Not even the mouse will move, although, I am able to use [Alt]+[SysRq]+[K] to kill xfce, which still necessitates a reboot to get up and running again. I will provide more system details if they are needed. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Yes that is what happens when you run out of memory/swap. On the other hand I would have expected that Ubuntu starts killing random processes, desperately trying not to crash. It is a configuration somewhere in the system, but once out of memory there it is unsafe for your filesystem to keep running. So the most sane thing is to halt the system, trying not to corrupt any (more) data.\nYou have to figure out why you run out of memory, which application causes this to happen. top or htop can help you with that. htop probably needs to be installed with sudo apt-get install htop. The advantage of htop is that you can easily point and click on the column header you want to sort by.\nIf you can't eleminate the program, your best bet is to add extra RAM, but that costs money. Your second best bet is increasing swap space, but that costs performance.\nAs a temporary work around (until next reboot) you can test if this works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a filesystem with a lot of free space. On most default installs /tmp will do df -h /tmp. At least several GB's should be free.\n\n*Create a large file (eg. 1M × 2000 = 2GB) dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/extra.swap bs=1M count=2000\n\n*Initialise the file as swap space mkswap /tmp/extra.swap\n\n*Start using the file as swap space sudo swapon /tmp/extra.swap\nIf this is working for you, you'll have to look into making a more definitive solution out of this.\n", "Q: X server not running on 12.04 I've installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my AMD64 desktop.

How do I install Half-Life 1 and 2 on Ubuntu 12.04 if I already have the game on a Windows installer CD and on Steam. I tried it with Steam, but the game didn't launch. I also tried it on wine with the Windows installer, but it didn't work either.\n\nA: If you came here to play HL, HL2 or any other Steam for Linux released game see How can I install Steam? for the answer which is a lot simpler than this. This one only apply to games outside the Steam environment or not yet on steam. Also know that Half-Life is natively supported in Ubuntu. Most likely HL2 will follow.\nTo play both, HL and HL2 (Not through steam) you first need the Wine PPA (It is much better than the actual version that comes with Ubuntu). So first install the Wine PPA (Does not matter if you already have PlayOnLinux installed). PlayOnLinux can work without the need of having Wine installed since it will eventually download its own version of Wine if it detects you do not have one (Including addons which are similar in use as winetricks). It also downloads specific Wine versions even if you have Wine install for some specific cases (Some games in PoL depend on specific Wine versions). \nIf you use Wine PPA or PlaOnLinux the game should work with no problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Follow this guide to install the latest Wine: http://www.winehq.org/download/ubuntu\n\n*After that go to Software Center and look for Wine with version 1.5.x. Right now it is 1.5.23. Install it. You can also install it via the terminal with sudo apt-get install wine.\n\n*Download PlayOnLinux from their website and install it.\n\n*Execute PlayOnLinux at least once so it can download the needed Fonts and configures itself for use.\n\n*If you try to run the games with Wine, first try to download, any needed libraries and additional packages the game needs. This can be done with winetricks. You can run winetricks from the Dash or from the terminal like winetricks --gui. For HL, HL2 and many other games I have tested, including but not limited to: Trine, Trine2, Portal, Portal2 and many others I recommend the following Winetricks installation:\nOpen Winetricks and select Select the default wineprefix\n\nSelect **Install a windows DLL or component\n\nInstall all that I have marked (and any additional you need for a specific app). This should cover many apps and games. I have not had any additional problems after installing this with many games:\n\n\n\n\nThe Physx component, even if you do not have Nvidia, you still need to install it for games that require it.\nNow simply right click the installer for HL1 or HL2 and select Open with Wine. Tested again with both games. Working perfectly (Not the Steam version, only the older CD/DVD versions).\n\n*If you try to run the game through PlayOnLinux, the app will guide you step by step on how to install the game and will take care of many aspects of it's installation including needed DLL and other components to make it work right.\n\nA: Half-life 1 is now released for native Linux. It is available from Steam (http://steampowered.com)\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I install Steam?\n\nA: Check out this page for install instructions.\nCurrently there is no Steam or Source Engine for Linux, but recently there have been (more substantial than previous) rumors of a Steam Client for Linux, as well as a Source Engine port.\n\nA: Install playonlinux.

Since UIM didn't want to play ball after installing Ubuntu 12.04 from scratch, I tried IBus, since that's the IME framework that's coming with Ubuntu by default.\nHowever, ibus-table-compose is a pain in the butt to use because just to enter one character I need to press the key combination to trigger IBus first, enter the respective compose sequence, then press the IBus key combination again to disable it. Instead of that I'd rather like to keep my compose key functionality as provided by XIM, since that requires fewer keystrokes.\nThe problem is, though, that when the default input method is set to IBus and IBus is deactivated so that (AIUI, since I started it with ibus-daemon --xim) it is bypassed in favor of XIM, the settings in ~/.XCompose seem to be overridden by IBus's own version, so e.g. Compose c a doesn't give ą (a-ogonek) as I defined in the .XCompose file in my home directory, but ǎ (a-hacek), as defined by some other settings.\nI've grown quite accustomed to my own mnemnonics, so is there any way to make my system use my own ~/.XCompose file with the default input method still being set to IBus so that IBus will still work e.g. in OpenOffice and other applications that don't let you choose the input method with a context menu?\nNote: This is not a duplicate of the question How can I get compose back on ibus?\n\nA: As stated by @von, you CANNOT use your .XCompose with IBUS for now.\nYou can use uim as Input Method, which supports Unicode, both GTK+ and Qt immodules with legacy XIM support.\nA good way to handle your .XCompose and keep existing global Compose is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install uim:\nsudo apt-get install uim\n\n*Make it the default Input Method:\nim-config -n uim\n\n*Edit your .XCompose and add the current keyboard locale (in my case, en_US) as first line:\ninclude \"/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose\"\n\n*Done!

(Because of an extremely large mysql database, a fresh install isn't really a good option.)  I do at least have a QA server to test on, and I ran a test upgrade over the weekend on that server.  It appeared to work perfectly until the reboot, despite running the risk of doing the upgrade via ssh (I know it's not \"recommended\" but I didn't have \"proper\" visual access at that time because of where the machine is actually hosted).\nDuring the upgrade, I allowed the system to replace /boot/grub/menu.lst with the new package file.  So I'm pretty sure it's not looking for the old kernel and not finding it.

Still, nothing that showed up during the upgrade appeared to give any clue about what was coming next.\nUpon reboot, however it apparently isn't finding the hard drive anymore.  It drops into the \"BusyBux\" built-in shell for what I assume is emergency recovery work after three \"segmentation fault\" errors and reporting that it \"gave up waiting for root device\".

Using this plugin I was able to make my custom Super-shortcuts working again which did not work with the standard Keyboard -> Shortcuts system settings.\nStill this solution does not seem to work for shortcuts used by Unity. For example it's not possible to override Super-T, which opens the trash even if it has been re-assigned to something else in the commands plugin. And I couldn't find a way to disable the default action as defined by Unity.\n\nA: I don't think it works with Unity but I have a solution which works at least for those who use Gnome.

All suggested fixes on the Frozenbyte forums have yielded no progress.\nOn a somewhat related topic, other games also exhibit problems, like Crayon Physics Deluxe.\n\nA: For Crayon Physics, this worked for 12.04 32-bit.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the installation folder and rename lib32to lib32ORIGINAL.\n\n*In the terminal run the following command: \nsudo apt-get install libqtcore4 libqtgui4\n\nFor 64-bit, try this: \nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs libqtcore4 libqtgui4\n\n\n*In the terminal: \nsudo apt-get install libsdl1.2debian libsdl-image1.2 libsdl-mixer1.2\n\nFor 64-bit: \nsudo apt-get install i32-libs libsdl1.2debian libsdl-image1.2 libsdl-mixer1.2\n\n\n*cd to the installation folder and execute ./launcher.\nI hope this works for you!\n\nA: Unfortunately, as stated above, it appears that so far the only way to run Shadowgrounds under Linux is by using Wine. As far as I can tell the game behaves normally under Wine and is perfectly playable. That said, it would be still nice if someone came up with a way to play it natively as well... Given that htere has been no activity for over a year, I am proposing this to be the best answer we got at this point.

When doing a search, the Grooveshark hits are always presented above Spotify's.\nIs it possible to sort/order/prioritize the presentation of scopes in some way?\n\nA: Lenses will display the results of scopes on a first come, first served basis\nWhen a search term is entered, each scope performs their search gets the results and then sends the results to the lens to be displayed.  The lens displays the results in the order in which they are delivered to it.  So, scopes which finish their searches quicker get their results displayed first.\nA number of factors affect the search speed of a scope. Some websites may be slower at returning results than others, for example.  In this case, Grooveshark's search is presumably finished before Spotify's, and thus, its results are delivered to the lens first.\nIt would be possible for a scope to have a delay built into it in order to de-emphasise the scope's results, but it is difficult to see how a scope could perform searches quicker, especially if it is reliant on a website delivering it results to display.\n", "Q: VirtualBox unresponsive after a forced power down I have trouble in VirtualBox on Ubuntu 12.04 32bit.

Rather you can simply add a swap file as outlined in How do I add more swap?:\n\nSwap is generally associated with a swap partition, perhaps because\n  the user is prompted to create a swap partition at the time of\n  installation. In fact, any file can be used as a swapping device, be\n  it a partition or a conventional file. Swap can be added by increasing\n  the size of the swap partition or by adding a swap file. [...] [emphasis mine]\n\nSection Four-step Process to Add Swap File outlines the required steps, which boils down to e.g. (replace /mnt with an appropriate directory of your choice):\nsudo fallocate -l 512m /mnt/512MiB.swap\nsudo chmod 600 /mnt/512MiB.swap\nsudo mkswap /mnt/512MiB.swap\nsudo swapon /mnt/512MiB.swap\n\nThis won't survive a reboot yet, thus requires you to edit /etc/fstab, e.g.:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nThen add this line at the end of the file:\n/mnt/512MiB.swap  none  swap  sw  0 0\n\nPlease refer to the linked page for more details and an example session, if need be.\n", "Q: Upgrade 12.04 LTS from 11.04, Keyboard Freeze and Monitor cannot light up \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat should I do when Ubuntu freezes? \n\nMy PC is Dell Optiplex 380, the original OS is Ubuntu 11.04, and I upgraded it to 12.04 right now.

All needed tools, elements are now included in standard install (once installed).\n\nA: Did you check your file integrity? Maybe the ISO file is not downloaded correctly.\nYou should test the integrity of the ISO file to make sure the file is downloaded correctly. If you have another Linux machine, use the md5sum your-ubuntu-image.iso command with your ISO file to find out the MD5 hash code. In my case, the command looks like this:\nmd5sum ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso\nAnd the output is:\n128f0c16f4734c420b0185a492d92e52  ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso\nThen you can check if the resulting hash code matches with MD5SUMs provided by Canonical at this link.\nIf you don't have another Linux machine, you can also do this on a Windows machine by downloading a proper tool for file hash checking.\n\nA: I am encountering the same issue, I found a workdaround, stack your CD/USB in the driver. boot, press return then select your language, then press F6, disable all options and press return, you should now be able to boot from CD, then from there do a full install in the graphical interface\n", "Q: my top menu consists of two bluetooth but no battery indicator \nIt looks as figure above.

It is always a few ms \"late\", and often not completely on target either. It is system-wide, not only when scrolling on web pages. The HW I am using is the same I used when running Kubuntu 11.10, which performed light years better compared to Unity - and, with no mouse lag what so ever. I am aware of the bug with the current Nvidia driver (295.40), but it is the same with the Noveau driver as well. It has nothing to do with setting the acceleration and sensitivity levels. It is the actual input that seems weird. \nIt is the same on a single laptop monitor and on my dual monitor setup.\nCan it be kernel thing? Did they change how mousepolling is done? Any compiz tweaks available?\nI plan to test this with Kubuntu 12.04 to see if it happens with KWIN too. \nThanks.\n\nA: I've run into this before, and this fixed it for me.  However, I've just changed this back to the original state, and it doesn't seem to be re-appearing.  Perhaps it has been made moot by an upgrade -- but here's the process I used to fix it.\nIf you are running into the problem now, and just want to test real quick if this fix works, you can do the temporary:\nsudo sh -c 'echo N > /sys/module/drm_kms_helper/parameters/poll'\n\nTo keep this change, do:\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"options drm_kms_helper poll=0\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf'\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\n\nA: I had the same issue (nVidia 9600m GT card), but only with NOUVEAU drivers (strange enough, previous ubuntu/nouveau versions works ok).\nI noticed the issue when mouse cursor is in \"busy state\" (the spinning animation), so i think there is something in cursor hw acceleration.\nAnyway, i solved using nvidia binary driver, \"current-updates\" version.\n\nA: This is perhaps sacrilegious to say, but I've yet to have a good, sustained experience with Compiz, in any version of Ubuntu I've tried since 10.10 (including 12.04).\nI've not experienced the mouse lag you've described, but I've noted other issues, that are laggy, buggy, or crashy.  For instance, with more than 3 applications open (e.g. Inkscape, Thunderbird, Chromium, jEdit, Gnome Terminal), I regularly experienced noticeably varying lag when switching workspaces.  The Unity launcher sidebar fails to hide or unhide.  This doesn't happen immediately, but after 2 or three minutes of heavy use, these issues seemingly randomly appear.  Then Compiz crashes, restarts, and it's okay again for a few minutes.\n\nMy solution: fall back to either the Unity 2D or Gnome (classic) interface.\n\nThings have since stayed right zippy, and metacity does not crash but once in a blue moon.\nIf you need the effects that Compiz provides (which are nice!), then I hope someone else can suggest a more direct solution, rather than my workaround.\nOf note, I'm using the same driver (nVidia) as you, with 256 MB graphics memory, 4GB of RAM, and a dual-core machine.\n\nA: I'm running 14.04 Xubuntu, currently 3.13.0-74-generic, and have the same problem. I've tried the \nsudo sh -c 'echo \"options drm_kms_helper poll=0\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf \n\nsolution suggested previously, and this helps, but only as a temporary fix. I've written a script program to perform it, but I've run it so many times. I examined the local.config file, and it just contains the one line repeated over and over again. I tried just touching the local.conf file instead, and that worked to temporarily fix the problem as well. Strange that a touch would do that. I'm going to see if I can touch a file that I don't need su privileges for, then I'll put it in a chron command to run every few minutes or so. This is all a workaround in lieu of a real solution.\n", "Q: Where is Wine-1.5 installed?

I haven't tried it myself, so I do not know if it will work in 14.04.  You will have to build it from scratch, since pre-built packages for the new version are not available yet.\n\nA: I will try to maintain here an updated answer on the programs that I was able to test, discussing the solutions that have been proposed. \nI will leave aside DVDShrink in Wine. \n\nDVD9to5 (dvd95) - I have tested it by making a backup of two video-dvds as iso files.

In fact DVD95 cannot select and backup more than one track each time (a confirmation of this here). \nWhile it may work ok with dvd movies that have only one such track (have to test that yet) the ones that have multiple tracks will put a big problem. These are dvds with more than a single movie. When backing up a dvd with multiple tracks the original menus will be lost because they relate to the other files that will not be copied. Also, subtitles are not usable in this way, and also scrolling does not work. The separate vob files would be playable separately.\nIn a such case the good part is that you have a better quality of the main video than in the case all the dvd image would have been there (like DVDSrink can do). I noticed in one case that the main video that was selected kept its original size, and all \"shrinking\" of the image was done only by removing the other tracks. It is not the same image in this way. But if that is not a problem for you (you do not need menus and subtitles) you may use a simple command dvdbackup -F (source for this here: How do I make an ISO copy of a DVD movie?) and in this way get only the main feature which might very well be smaller than 4.7GB \n\n\n*\n\n*DVD95 may be an alternative only in the case of dvds with a single track.\n\nHandbrake - can convert dvd video to MKV and to mp4: maybe a good solution to convert (have not tested it yet), but not to 'shrink' dvd images,\n\nso, Handbrake is not a DVDShrink alternative.\n\nxDVDShrink (also .deb) - Does not work on all dvd sources (encrypted etc).

Its called Vamps\nThe downside is, that Vamps is not capable to make DVD backups on its own. qVamps is a GUI, which enables the user to select titles from a DVD, uses Vamps for requantization and create a new DVD. qVamps uses dvdauthor for creation of the new DVD's data structures.\n\nA: On 18.04 Dec 2018 \nAnother way to do all this or rather another permutation of tricks is to:  \n➊ use Vobcopy to rip dvd to a folder \n\nvobcopy -m\n\nin terminal is all that is required  \n➋ THEN if you wish to reduce your 7+GiB folder to a 4.3 / 4.4GiB folder use K9copy assistant [K9] or indeed dvdshrink under Wine [since you have already done the rip no need to horse around adding to fstab]   \nThis way is pretty foolproof. I also raced K9copy and dvdshrink and about same time [2 or 3 minutes to do compression]\n\nA: It is unfortunate that DVDShrink can't be found playable for Linux/Ubuntu. One alternative that I've done is to copy the DVD as an ISO file in my computer and then burn it as it is (without compressing it) onto another (blank) DVD. There are double density blank DVD's out there that you can get. They are more expensive, but for now and until you find another solution, that might work. Back when I had to copy a hard-to-find movie and didn't have DVDShrink, I was using a software called \"InfraRecorder\" that I found on Download.cnet but I don't know where to find it now. \nAfter installing Linux Mint, I discovered that it comes with a software that works exactly as InfraRecorder called \"Brasero\". Give it a try, hope it will give you the utility that you need.\nGood luck on your search.\n\nA: I have been \"backing up\" DVD movie titles since about 2005. My typical procedure is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the most recent version of DVDfab to remove encryption and copy files to hard drive, in .vob form.\n\n*Then process the .vob files through DVD shrink to compress and then write the output to an .iso file. Sometimes I use DVD shrink, without compression, to create a .iso file.\n\n*Use DVD burning software to burn the .iso file to a DVD, single or double layer.\nThis worked flawlessly when I used Windows. The result is an exact copy, except possibly for some compression, of the original DVD title. Then I changed to Debian Linux and it didn't work at all until now. \nI was able to get DVDfab ver 9321 non-XP, by updating my system using:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen opening the package manager and updating all packages. What is most important is updating the wine program to the latest stable version available.\nI had to configure Wine to operate in Windows 8 mode to get DVDfab operating properly.\nThen I reinstalled DvdShrink; it ran properly until it came to the encoding process, it would progress about 3/4 of the way through and then it would display the following message:\ndvd shrink error message: \ndvd shrink encountered an error and can not continue\nOut of memory\n\nThinking about all the other responses to this problem on the internet, I thought by limiting the CPU speed of the DVDshrink process I might be able to slow the rate at which data is encoded so that it matches the speed at which it can be written to the hard drive. \nLinux has a program which does exactly that, it is called CPUlimit you can download it via:\nsudo apt install cpulimit\n\nSo I tried DVDshrink again, using CpuLimit for the DVDShrink process. I had to experiment with the slow-down factor, though finally it worked. If I slow down the DVDshrink process to 10% of maximum it will no longer display the memory message.\n", "Q: How to migrate passwords from Kwallet to the GNOME keyring? I migrated from KDE to Unity desktop. So all my passwords I used with Chromium and Iron-browsers are stucked in Kwallet. \nHow to access passwords from Kwallet inside Unity?

The ubuntu server is installed in a small local network with a dns but no internet connection. When I try installing a package, i.e. lamp or vsftpd it just tries to resolve the name of the update server. After some tries it gives up instead of checking the CD. I've added the CD using sudo apt-cdrom add. I've also tried using tasksel, which opens aptitude, without any luck. \nHow do I install packages (lamp, ssh, ftp, dhcp, samba) off the CD without internet connection?\nEDIT:\nSince this was unclear: We're given a server with ubuntu server installed and we're supposed to install lamp, ssh, ftp, dhcp and samba on it. To ensure we aren't cheating (asking the internet for help during the contest) we are limited to using only the cd.\n\nA: You can try all these methods https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware#Installing_packages_without_an_Internet_connection\nIf you cannot use USB sticks either you are left with packages on CD. So please check that those packages you want to install are on CD! As space of the CD is limited I doubt that lamp is available from CD. Maybe you can get a DVD with more packages on it.\n\nA: Might as well help anyone who might have this problem.\nThe list of sources for apt to use is located in:\n/etc/apt/sources.list\nThe first row is the cd, uncomment it by removing the leading hash. You can use nano to edit it like this:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\nEnter the password if prompted.\nAlso, comment away all internet sources if they aren't available, i.e. you are on a computer without internet connection. Just add hashes in front of all the other rows.\nAfter that you just save the file by pressing ctrl+o, and you're all good to go.\n\nA: I solved this like this:\nIn bios my ISO USB STICK  was detected as \"CD-ROM\" i changed this value to \nInterpret USB STICK AS \"HARDDRIVE\"\nAfter that i booted from this stick and installed Ubuntu 16 LTS.

I have limited internet and was wondering if it uses less bandwidth to upgrade to 12.04 through update manager or if it is the same dowload size as an ISO image downloaded from the website. Which would use the least amount of internet?\n\nA: If you want it to be faster (more speed and less time) , do this \nInstall apt-fast from http://www.webupd8.org/2010/01/new-apt-fast-version-now-with-full-full.html\nand then run the command \nsudo apt-fast dist-upgrade\n\nDownload size will be the same in this case but it will be faster because of multiple internet connections. \nIf you are still getting lesser download speeds, I recommend downloading the 12.04 CD and upgrading from it (backup required data in case something goes wrong)\nThe difference between two installations is \n1)Update manager will update all the packages installed on your system to newer versions if available in 12.04\n2)CD upgrade will try to update only some packages of 11.10 to match default packages of 12.04  and if not possible might update some dependencies as well but tries to be minimal.\nSo obviously, 2nd one is more faster\n\nA: Download size when using Update Manager depends on the number of applications you have installed on your machine - generally, I never saw the number below 700Mb and sometimes it was as high as more than 2Gb, so if all you need is a running Ubuntu 12.04 in any shape or form then a clean install would use less bandwidth.\nHowever, if you're going to make a clean install and then re-install all applications you have currently installed (and it's likely you'll need to install updates to be able to do that too) - then the difference would be much less. Or maybe even the second method would take more bandwidth.\nSo, the final answer is \"it's about the same, plus-minus a few Mb\" :)\nCold hard numbers: I installed Kubuntu 11.10 in VirtualBox then tried to upgrade it to 12.04 - the upgrade tool said it needs to download 614 Mb. The ISO size was 701 Mb. So we may assume that upgrading requires slightly less bandwidth (<100 Mb difference) than downloading the ISO and then re-installing all the software.\n", "Q: Java packaging and uploading to a PPA in Launchpad I have a java application (created as a class) and I want to know how I can (or should I even) convert it to .deb format and then how to upload it to a Launchpad PPA so that everyone could install it?\nNotice that I am still learning Java, so my program does not have any GUI.\n\nA: Packaging is quite a long process and here I am assuming that you are ready to go through the trouble. Since Ubuntu is based on Debian and fetches almost all the packages from the Debian repository, I believe the packaging schemes in both are the same. Please refer to this : http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/\n", "Q: How can I upgrade a package without removing its dependencies? For some reason (having used xorg-edgers in the past might be part of that), I still have a very old X server installed:\nxorg   7.6+7ubuntu7.1\nxserver-xorg-core  1.10.4-1ubuntu4.2\nxserver-xorg-video-intel  2.16.0+git20111011.823a4272-0ubuntu0sarvatt~natty\n\nwhen I try dist-upgrade, aptitude wants to remove 255 packages first (acrobat, bluez-alsa, ..., ia32-libs, ..., xserver-xorg-video-* to name a few)\nIs there a way to update packages forcing Ubuntu to ignore any dependencies it might think that could theoretically be violated?\nOn a RPM-based system, I'd use rpm --force --nodeps\nNote: I already removed the xorg-edgers ppa.\nNote 2: I'm trying to upgrade with aptitude safe-upgrade and aptitude dist-upgrade\n\nA: Only way i know for holding is using aptitude, where you can set packages to hold. The only problem is, that you should further use aptitude for every updating/installing/removing task, because AFAIK other package manager tools does not care about hold-flags. In apt-get docs is also option --ignore-hold, but at least last time i used apt-get with hold-flags set to some packages, it ignored them anyway.\n\nA: It seems that aptitude contains new code to resolve dependencies. This code is ... could be better. :-)\nIn my case, running apt-get upgrade just offered to upgrade the 13 xorg packages and leave the rest of my system alone.\nSo if your aptitude hangs itself in the dependency graph (= when installing/upgrading, it wants to remove hundreds of packages first), give the old tools another try.\n", "Q: ps -ef vs ps aux What is the difference between \nps -ef | grep thin  \n\nand\nps aux | grep thin\n\nAs per the output there is a variation but i'm not clear what are the things being listed.\n\nA: Both list all processes of all users. In that aspect -e and ax are completely equivalent. \nWhere they differ is output format specifier, -f is \"full\", while u is \"user-oriented\". The displayed columns are different:\n\n\n*\n\n*columns for ps -f\nUID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD\n\n\n*\n\n*columns for ps u\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\n\nA: There are no differences in the output because the meanings are the same.\nThe difference between ps -ef and ps aux is due to historical divergences between POSIX  and BSD systems.

I had to break the upgrade at 87% and don't think my system will boot now. Is there any way to resume the upgrade in order to complete it?\n\nA: I know this is not quite the question you asked however here is a short discussion about the dropbox problem:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11891423\nIn fact to update dropbox it must be stopped (killed via sudo gnome-system-monitor)\n\nA: I don't believe resuming will work. You will need to restart the configuration of all the packages.\nDuring the Grub menu, after you start the PC, select (recovery mode). Then a menu will appear, one of them is about \"dpkg\" select it and reconfigure all the packages.\nIf the menu didn't appear, and you went into console mode you can run this command:\ndpkg-reconfigure -a\n\nIf if was broken - as it was in my case -, and neither the menu nor the console worked. Then in the Grub choose a \"Previous Linux Version\" and select any of the Linux Kernel version in (recovery mode). I'd suggest the newest version. And follow the previous two steps.\n(Well to be honest I think you can \"resume\" the upgrade, if you somehow managed to keep track of all the packages that weren't yet configured, by running dpkg-reconfigure package_name)\n\nA: Agree with Yashima, but, if your system monitor does not show Dropbox, don't be fooled, it's still running in the background. Open up a terminal window and kill it.\nType in \"ps -e\", scroll and find the Dropbox process, note it's program ID (the number to the left of the name), then type in \"kill PID\" (replace PID with the program ID of the Dropbox process).

Hence, I'm looking for a more direct fix.  I thought rebooting the .ISO disk and reinstalling would be a good fix but obviously not since this problem is repeatable.\n\nA: Xinerama and xrandr are mutually exclusive.  You get one or the other not both.  \nXinerama is considered depracated.  You should avoid it whenever possible.\n\nA: Although the first answer is entirely correct, i might add that you can resolve the situation by deleting (or moving, if you want to keep your settings) /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\nAfter that, you either reboot or reload the appropriate kernel modules, and then you can use xrandr again.\nKeep in mind that you are not using the ati-drivers anymore, so 3D-Acceleration may not be optimal.\n", "Q: How to make the date appear next to the time indicator in Gnome Classic?

The display stays the same, but I am unable to move the mouse or click on anything.  Any suggestions?  I think it might be the wireless driver, but I'm no expert.\n\nA: The bug is addressed here and is solved by updating the kernel to 3.3.6; the system seems stable, no freezes. Here is the link for the required kernel update.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 had got lot of bugs and issues with non pae devices. So generic pae files are to be downloaded which can solve your problem though. At the startup, on grub loader, just run the ubuntu, run the ubuntu in generic pae mode( recovery mode) and it will be in your very low resolution mode. This is what I am doing to check whether if it is not a graphic issue. Then just enter the command $ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic-pae\nand check wether now it runs successfully.\n", "Q: How do I automatically install repast on Ubuntu 12.04? How can I install Repast on Ubuntu 12.04? I installed Eclipse from the repos, but I couldn't then install repast. According to the site, repast needs Eclipse Helios Classic, while the repo version of eclipse is Indigo.\nWhat is the easiest way to get repast working? That is, I know I could install things myself from the eclipse website. But I don't want to do that: isn't the point of having a package manager that you shouldn't have to do that sort of thing?\nTo be clear, I'd like to install as much as possible through the package manager.\n\nA: You can download any version of Eclipse from eclipse website and install it locally from the tarball. Then you will be able to install any plugin, even the ones which are not available in Ubuntu repositories.\nActually, here's a nice answer detailing how to build your own .deb from an Eclipse tarball - just follow the instructions and then install the resulting file. However, Eclipse runs just fine when installed from a tarball too. You also can have more then one version of Eclipse installed this way.\n\nA: You have to do that in a two step process:\n\n\n*\n\n*First add the greclipse to eclipse's software sources using this link via the \"add\" button in \"Install new software\": http://dist.springsource.org/release/GRECLIPSE/e3.7/\n\n*Then add the repast software sources with the official link and you'll be able to install it with minimal concerns.\nThis happens because repast, apparently, relies on groovy.\n", "Q: How I do set Xcowsay on login without the cow disappearing? I love xcowsay app. And I want that it starts on logon. I added to startup manager this command: xcowsay Hi.\nBut after login, the cow doesn't show, only the speech bubble. Although, when I type it on Terminal runs good. I don't know if it's because command, startup order or user  permission. \nAll startup applications with commands runs well. I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Xcowsay version 1.2.0.\n\nA: The main problem that when we logon, the devices are not mounted except for the root device and home directory. Even sometimes, home directory fails to start. So application run normally which belongs to the path file system/user/bin/ directory as an executable otherwise may cause problems even if it belongs to some other paths.

My Unity Greeter/LightDM is working fine in Precise with one exception. \nWhen the greeter first displays the default system wallpaper /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png is visible for 1 second, before dynamic LightDM kicks in.  Its more of a nuisense than anything, but what options do I have to configure this to make it run seamlessly? \nI have looked at other related AU Q&A  and UF with no success and I have reviewed the configuration at\n\ngksu gedit /etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf\n\n\nA: Change the wallpaper to match your \"dynamic\" backgoroud or, change it to - something like a black, or dark purple background so you don't notice the switch, How do I change the wallpaper of the login screen?  , otherwise you will notice when it changes from the default to your dynamic.\nMaybe its a bug, who knows? If you turn off the dynamic wallpaper it will still show a transition from a purple background to a custom wallpaper.\nNote to benefit others:\nAnswer accepted as it improved LightDM transition, however it did not fully resolve the issue.

Just follow the documentation here.\nAfter it finishes its download, I am assuming it is downloaded into /downloads folder. Then just extract the files to a folder. let's assume it wxpython. Now I just recommend you to use easy_install to install modules for multiple version of python.

I then power-cycled and now it won't boot to a login screen.  I tried hitting <Esc> repeatedly while powering up (to get to the Grub menu) but that has no effect.\nWhat should I do now?\nEDIT:\nI can see the files on the hard disk once I boot from a Live CD.  I saw some stuff online about using chroot and dpkg to continue an aborted upgrade from the command line.  Is there any comprehensive guide on this?\n\nA: The original poster here, SplashHit, indicated in a comment that this question on SuperUser answered the question.\n\n\n*\n\n*In that question, the OP followed this \"guide\" posted on Launchpad (which is actually the original version of this bug report by TJ).\n\n*rumtscho, the OP of that SuperUser question, had attempted to chroot into the installed system from a live CD system and run dpkg --configure -a, but there were lots of Permission denied error messages.\n\n*The accepted answer (by Darth Android) was that the OP needed to mount the /proc and /dev filesystems in the chroot before running dpkg ....\nIt's unclear from SplashHit (the original poster here)'s comment whether the Launchpad \"guide\" was sufficient to solve this problem here, or if the answer to that question was also necessary.\nIn any case, it appears that this question is now effectively answered for the OP (and abandoned).\n@SplashHit, if I am mistaken and you still need help with this problem, please let us know (you can post a comment here, and of course if there is additional information then you can add that to your question).\n\nA: Try holding down Shift to get to the GRUB2 menu. If that works, see if you can boot any of the options. (You can then provide more information in your question.)\nIf that doesn't work, or you do get a GRUB2 menu but you can't boot into Ubuntu, try reinstalling the GRUB2 boot loader to your Master Boot Record (MBR), using any of these methods.\nOnce you've booted into Ubuntu, you can attempt to repair and finish the upgrade by running  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.\n\nA: About using chroot, you can take a look at this Gentoo guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*Chroot from a livecd\nIt says how you can reinstall grub, but you can run dpkg --configure -a instead of grub2-install.\nThe main idea of the chroot approach is to mount your original / partition on the live CD filesystem, probably on /mnt/mysystem, then chroot to /mnt/mysystem. After chrooting, your / will be actually /mnt/mysystem, your original /. It's like you CHanged your ROOT.\n", "Q: LAMP Server not working on Precise I've installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Precise a few days ago. I tried installing LAMP Server as I've been done in last four Ubuntu versions, simply by using these commands:\nsudo apt-get install lamp-server^\nsudo apt-get install phpmyadmin\n\nFirst command seems to install all needed packages for LAMP to work.

I have performed the sequence of apt-get update/upgrade and install of the nvidia-current driver, but got back that it was already in use. The password appears to be recognized, as wrong one results in an error. Have also tried switching to the 2D Unity, without other results.\n\nA: This can be the solution: http://www.icpep.org/solved-ubuntu-wont-login/\n\nA: Initially from my clean install of 12.04 (64bit), the login screen would intermittently repeat, and the second time the login would be stuck with \"Logging in...\" under the user name.\nFound a bug report about the \"Logging in...\" stating that this was caused by using a non-default wallpaper and an issue with lightdm. I have reverted to a plain blue background, and I now no longer get the \"Logging in...\" freeze issue - however, I consistently get two login screens!\nI enter credentials correctly and am immediately presented with a second login screen (no errors).

Pressing the Tab button brings up \"Capture\" screen. Use the left and right arrow keys to select the mic boost slider and reduce it with the down arrow key. Press the Esc key to quit alsamixer.\n\nA: I've only been able to diminish the audio static by doing two things. First, lower the PCM volume level to 80ish. Type \"alsamixer\" into the terminal and arrow over to PCM then arrow down. Also,this. Hope this helps.\n\nA: I had the same issue.  After playing around with the cables and such, I came to realize that if I remove the power cord from my laptop the static noise completely diminishes.  Now, clearly this sucks because it would mean I have to run on battery the whole time, but I'm currently assuming its the actual AC adapter thats causing the problem, since the AC adapter itself tends to make a static noise when the battery is fully charged. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 does not recognize Kingston DT108 16GB USB drive I bought a Kingston DT108 16GB USB pen drive and Ubuntu did not recognize it.

Remember the device name and mount the device using command sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt  //assuming sda2 is NTFS formatted USB device.\nedit: I recommend you to format the USB device as ntfs for it makes easy on a linux system to check the ntfs device and figure out what it is.\n\nA: Does that particular USB port work when other devices are plugged in?  It is possible that that USB hub on your machine isn't working under Ubuntu.   It should always recognize that there is a device being plugged in -- do dmesg |grep /dev and see what the last device comes out to be. \nAs a test, plug a mouse into that USB port and see if it is working as expected (watch \"dmesg | tail\",  CTRL+C to break out)\nAnother possibility is that, the device requires more power than the port can provide, but whatever the case, try another USB port on your machine and see if the behavior continues.\n", "Q: Dependency resolution problem: libgnome-keyring0 I'm trying to install ia32-libs on Precise (it's a dependency of CrossOverPro which is actually what I'm trying to achieve, but I don't think that's relevant).

Guest session works, and allows other languages, but I can't log in on my main account. What to do?\nOn Ubuntu 11.10 I used to have Swedish as default language and Russian as secondary. The first login on 12.04 worked fine, but not any more.\n\nA: After upgrade to 12.04 I had the exact same issue. Prior to upgrade, Greek (Polytonic) and Finnish keyboard layouts were available. After upgrade, LightDM only showed Greek (Polytonic), which prevented logging in.\nI worked around this by changing the password from the virtual terminal (Ctrl-Alt-F1) by logging in and using passwd to change my password to numeric one as suggested by ggis. Then, when logged in to Unity, I reset keyboard layouts to default, re-added Greek and Finnish layouts and ordered them properly. After a few tries, I got Finnish to show up in LightDM.\n", "Q: What IDE for developing basic applications accessing MYSQL database?

Some times (at load or turned on > 1 hour) it shuts down due to heat, in Windows 7 it runs idle at 49 C. I tried an acpi call to shut down the nVidia chip which is cooled together with the Atom chip. That didn't solve the problem. To check up to see if it really turned off I checked how much power the laptop consumed, it only went from using 1400 mW to 860 mW, no changes in heat.\nI also tried reapply the standard heat adhesive, the old heat adhesive made it run at 97 (it couldn't even put up a useful install of Ubuntu). This really annoys me, as Ubuntu is the OS of choice to me.\nShould I try compile the kernel?\nIs it true that compile for a P4 is the better choice to the atom, when compiling the kernel for this processor architecture?\nNow I tried compiling the kernel for atom. Now temperature is 83 C (think the drop has more to do with ambient temp than the customized kernel)\nhelp appreciated \n\nA: Look I had a temperature problem but not that much. My laptop was about 65 C (high performance), and the fan was working too fast. I found out that my graphics card drivers (AMD Catalyst - not the same as you) were not installed and I couldn't, so I installed them manually from terminal and then the temperature is now about 53 C and the fan works perfectly.

I should have been patient and waited a couple of months to upgrade.\nAny help at all will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I also noticed the overscan adjustment setting was gone after upgrading to the new 304.43 driver (it was available in 295.40).  While you want to have none of your image cropped it is likely your TV that is cropping (and scaling) the image and your nvidia overscan compensation is scaling it again -- producing a poor quality image.  If you are sending a digital signal to your TV (eg one over HDMI, DVI-D, etc) and it is a standard resolution supported by your TV (eg 1080/60p, press 'info' on your TV) then there is no reason for the TV to crop or scale the image.  But for some reason many of the TV manufacturers crop 1-2% off of the margins of the digital image (this was good for analog as the image perimeter had a lot of noise).  \nA better solution is to go into the 'Picture' settings in your TV menu and find the setting to not crop the image.  This setting may be called 'dot by dot', '1:1 mapping', 'just scan', etc.  With my LG TV it is called 'just scan' and it is one of the 'aspect ratio' settings.  Now that my TV isn't cropping the picture the image looks perfect.  I don't need to make any changes (like to the overscan compensation) to the Nvidia driver setup and this method will give you a perfect (unscaled) picture.\nOnce you TV is not cropping the image if you still have a cropped image then you are not sending the right resolution image to the TV.  This would involve changing the output resolution to what the TV supports (eg 1920 x 1080, 1280 x 720, etc) in nvidia-settings.   If this doesn't work then you would have to create your own Xorg.conf file with a custom ModeLine supported by your TV (not easy; google it).  \n\nA: I finally managed to eliminate overscan on my Panny 32\" 720P LCD TV using a combination of \"ViewPortIn\" and \"ViewPortOut\" with the beta 302.07 driver.\nI played with nvidia-settings commands until I finaly got something that worked: \nnvidia-settings --assign CurrentMetaMode=\"DFP-0: 1920x1080 { ViewPortIn=1920x1080, ViewPortOut=1820x1020+50+30 }\" \nWith that, I added the following line to the \"Monitor\" section of xorg.conf to make the settings \"stick:\" Option \"MetaModes\" \"DFP-0: 1920x1080 { ViewPortIn=1920x1080, ViewPortOut=1820x1020+50+30 }\"\n\nA: You might want to try this:\nnvidia-settings --assign=\"OverScanCompensation=100\"\n\nValid values are 0-200 i i got it right.  \n", "Q: What does Ubuntu mean by \"support\" for its releases? Whenever Ubuntu releases a new version during six months, they offer support for that version for the coming six months right? What does that support mean? Does it mean that I cannot use apt-get to install any more softwares in it once that six months is over?\nIf that is the case, then is my ubuntu 10.04 of no use to me in installing applications and softwares anymore? If that is not what it means, then what exactly does a 5 year support for an LTS mean?\n\nA: It means that you will only be able to get security updates during that period. One it is over, the repositories are closed and moved to an archive. \nApt-get will stop working unless you change your software-sources, and even then no one will fix bugs or security problems. \nYou can still use an unsupported version, but expect some problems.\nYou can still use 10.04 until April 2013 in desktops or 2015 in servers. That means that Firefox (and similar packages) won't be updated after April 2013, but Apache and MySQL (for example) will get updates until 2015.

I've installed/re-installed the driver with no luck. Eventually, I added manually a new mode line as explained here in the Ubuntu help wiki. \n\nDue to buggy hardware or drivers, your monitor's correct resolutions\n  may not always be detected. For example, the EDID data block queried\n  from your monitor may be incorrect.\nIf the mode already exists, but just isn't associated for the\n  particular output, you can add it like this:\nxrandr --addmode S-video 800x600\n\nIf the mode doesn't yet exist, you'll need to create it first by\n  specifying a modeline:\nxrandr --newmode <Mode``Line>\n\nYou may create a modeline using the gtf or cvt utility. For example,\n  if you want to add a mode with resolution 800x600 at 60 Hz, you can\n  enter the following command: (The output is shown following.)\n$ cvt 800 600 60\n# 800x600 59.86 Hz (CVT 0.48M3) hsync: 37.35 kHz; pclk: 38.25 MHz\nModeline \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\n\nThen copy the information after the word \"Modeline\" into the xrandr\n  command:\nxrandr --newmode \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\n\nAfter the mode is entered, it needs to be added to the output using\n  the --addmode command as explained above.\n\n", "Q: What if I upgrade XUbuntu?

Assume I'm getting a new router. I've never heard of any problems like this, but is there reason to fear some routers might not work well with Ubuntu? If so, which types?\n\nA: Every router in existence should work with Ubuntu. Routers communicate with your computer using plain TCP/IP, the operating-system-agnostic backbone of the internet. Without getting too technical, any operating system that speaks TCP/IP (which Ubuntu does) will work with any router.\nIf you're setting up a network with multiple routers, stick with one vendor (eg Linksys, Belkin). There can be interoperability issues there, but that also applies for Windows and Mac.\n", "Q: Can I rename Liferea feeds imported from Google?

In my Ubuntu 12.04, I have two monitors: left is the laptop and the right one is an external and big monitor. My vision is generally focused on the laptop monitor, but the notifications appears in the right one, therefore, I lose the notifications. \nIs possible to change the location of the notifications? For example, the notifications appear on the top-right corner of the laptop/left monitor.   \n\nA: It is currently not possible to change the location of the notifications. By the design they should appear in top-right corner of your primary screen, but because of this bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/notify-osd/+bug/331369\nthey will always appear on your most right monitor.\nThere used to be a patch to notify-osd by Roman (Leolik) Sukochev that allowed user to change behaviour of notification, but it was not ported to 12.04 yet.\nRight now you can only wait for bug to be fixed or for new version of Leolik's patch or you can set your laptop monitor to be on right side.\nALSO: it does not matter in this case if your monitor is 'laptop' or external, so your question is a duplicate of: notify-osd and dual monitors as stated by user59621.\n\nA: For an imperfect workaround, install dconf-editor (provided by the package dconf-tools), navigate to Apps > notify-osd and change the value of multihead mode to focus-follow.\nThis will draw the volume notifications a little too high up on your left monitor, causing them to overlap the panel - but they will at least be drawn on your left monitor. Email/message/music/other notifications don't overlap and look fine using this method.\n\nA: Instructions for installing the patch mentioned above on 12.04 are available in this thread: How to customize on screen notifications? and there is a setting in it for positioning labeled \"dynamic\" which I found fixed this problem. However, I did not like the way it altered the color and styling of the notifications, so I undid those changes and then used the dconf solution mentioned in a comment in this thread, which I found works pretty well. The slight differences in positioning are a bit annoying though. Hopefully they can fix this soon, as it is quite frustrating.\n", "Q: How to show the Alt-Tab popup on All Monitors?

There are a couple ways to execute the changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*either from the command line\nxmodmap -e \"your commands\"\n\n\n*or write the commands to a file like .xmodmaprc, then execute it in your login items or your .bashrc with\nxmodmap .xmodmaprc\n\nIf you use the file ~/.xmodmap it will be executed automatically on login.\nAlt and Super (the Windows key) are modifiers, and behave specially to the system. The keys will need to be unmapped from their modifier before you can remap anything else. The space bar is considered a regular key.\nUnmapping the modifier\nOpen up a terminal window (Ctrl-Alt-T, if you're unfamiliar with it).\nRun the command xmodmap -pm to get a list of the modifier keys on your system. In the output, the leftmost column is the list of modifiers available to the system. The other columns list the keys bound to these modifiers as pairs by keysym (keycode). For example, one line of my output is\nmod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x6c),  Meta_L (0xcd)\n\nThe keycodes correspond to physical keys, and can (hypothetically) differ between keyboards. The keysym is the 'name' of a key. If the key is a printable character, the name corresponds to the character printed.\nNow you have what you need to unmap a key from its corresponding modifier. I'm going to pretend we're working with Alt_R.\nRun the xmodmap command (by one of the methods up at the top)\nremove mod1 = Alt_R\n\nRemap the space bar\nNext we need to know what the spacebar is. Run xmodmap -pke in your terminal window. This will print out what every key on your keyboard is mapped to. Somewhere in that four or five screens-full is a reference to the space bar. We need its name in order to map a key to it.\nSpoiler alert: the spacebar is named space\nWe still have a key named Alt_R, but it doesn't do anything. We can use its name to remap it to the spacebar. Run this xmodmap command:\nkeysym Alt_R = space\n\nIt might happen while you test these out that you've changed Alt_R's name already. Maybe you accidentally remapped it to the letter 'a'. You don't want to remap 'a' to something else, because you still need one of the keys with that name. If you end up in that situation, you can still refer to Alt_R by its keycode. Remember that on my keyboard this is 0x6c. It might be different for you. You can use this xmodmap command to change it:\nkeycode 0x6c = space\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Nvidia xorg.conf options for better performances in Unity 3d I am on precise, unity works fine but I would like to improve the performances of the system.

Yesterday I upgraded to 12.04 and from that point on I cannot login. My laptop boots normally and I am presented with the log in screen in which I type my password / or scan my fingerprint and it seems that it is accepted because the screen goes black. After that some output is show for a very brief time and I am again directed back to the log in screen. My password is correct because every time I use a wrong one it does not go to the black screen. I tried removing and reinstalling nvidia current drivers but nothing changes. I am able to enter into guest session but that is not helpful. \nI tried the fsck option and the dpkg and failsafe graphics in the recovery mode but nothing helped.

Try selecting the Unity session from the login screen (top right hand corner of the password box).\n\nA: I was able to pass the login screen. All I needed to do was to remove the .Xauthority file in my home directory and after that it logged in fine. Now tha only issue is that I am spammed with ubuntu errors that require me to send a report, but this is good and it will help resolve them.\n\nA: I had the same problem after upgrading to 12.04.  I found that the upgrade reset my user and group ids.  This made the login process unable to read the contents of my existing home directory.  Logging in from console worked.  From there I ran \"sudo bash\" and as root, updated /etc/passwd and /etc/groups with my original ids.  I then had to chown my home directory back to myself.  After that, the regular login worked.

I had Ubuntu 11.10 without Unity installed on my old laptop Thinkpad Z60m. Few days ago, I got notification that 12.04 LTS is outside and that I should upgrade. As it is my old laptop, with nothing important on, I decided to go for it. \nAll fine and well. Except, now, Ubuntu behaves like I am not using a laptop. There is no battery indicator and I cannot enable it via Power settings (setting doesn't get stored). Also, power consumption is enormous, so it is now hardly usable running only on battery. Thing is 11.10 worked fine. Also, my battery held up to 3 hours.\nSo, I guess my question is, is there anything I can do to fix this, or do I need a reinstall?\n\nA: I don't know if this helps (maybe charger, battery problem). Found it on Youtube. Kind of old and it is Dell. Your charger is not recognized by your BIOS. And if your computer does not see an original charger the battery will not charge at all. Can sort this out by removing this idiotic option from the BIOS. They will give you another charger or change your motherboard (useless) and this problem will appear again after your warranty has expired.\nAnother reason why this is happening could be because you broke the prong on your charger, that's why its not charging. You must fix or replace the charger. It has nothing to do with the Laptop or battery. I had the same problem. I just added a new prong and it worked fine. It only took me about 5 minutes to fix. Easy fix if you know what you are doing.\n\nA: I always prefer a \"clean install\"  of the operating system as compared to upgrading an existing one.\nMy reason is this \"that if there’s a hidden problem when you upgrade the hidden problem shows up.\"\nSo perhaps reinstall a fresh copy of Ubuntu.\nDont forget to save your data first.\nHope this is of help but others may have other ideas .\n", "Q: How to install 3ds max 2009 on ubuntu using wine I see on winehq.org website is Gold support for 3ds max 2009 application.\nBut when I install it alert me that the .NET 2008 SP1 is error and I cannot continue to install this program.\n\nA: Try installing .NET 2008 SP1 after install 3ds max 2009\n", "Q: How do I make Thunderbird open links in Chromium?

In 24.6.0, the menu can be accessed on the right hand side of the top menu bar (next to the search bar and is represented by three horizontal lines).                \nClick Edit > then click Preferences >, \na new window will open. You will need to select the  Advanced  tab, at the bottom of that tab Open the Config Editor. \nThen, search for both network.protocol-handler.warn-external.http and\nnetwork.protocol-handler.warn-external.https. \nThese two are most likely to have a current value of false. Change the value to true (do this by simply right clicking on them) and the next time you try to open a link from some e-mail it'll ask you which browser to use. Chromium isn't likely to be shown in the list of choices, so use the navigate button. You can find Chromium at /usr/bin/chromium-browser. \nIf using google chrome as your browser of choice you may want to make it /usr/bin/google-chrome  or /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable\nIf Thunderbird doesn't ask you which browser to use when you click on a link after doing this, you can try deleting mimeTypes.rdf file in your profile folder to reset it.

It is possible to change this behavior by changing the default browser.\nOn Linux, another way (tried with TB1.5 under Suse and Debian) is to insert the following line in Thunderbird's prefs.js or user.js file (of course put in the correct path to your firefox):\nuser_pref(\"network.protocol-handler.app.http\", \"/usr/bin/firefox\");\nYou can find where Chromium is by typing -->\nwhich chromium\n\ninto the terminal.\nSource -->\nhttp://kb.mozillazine.org/Changing_the_web_browser_invoked_by_Thunderbird\n\nA: I tried this solution and it worked:\n1) In Settings Manager switch your favourite browser as default browser.\n2) update-alternatives --config x-www-browser\n3) Follow steps written here\n\nA: Because none of the listed solutions worked for me, here a different, very drastic way of getting the application to open links in Thunderbird changed:\n(E.g. if links currently are opened with Firefox)\nsudo apt-get remove firefox-esr\n\n--> open Thunderbird and click on some link --> you can choose a different browser now. Now we can re-install Firefox\nsudo apt-get install firefox-esr\n\n\nA: None of these solutions worked for me. I ran thunderbird using strace, and discovered, that regardless of what value I chose for network.protocol-handler.app.http, it was always attempting to launch /usr/bin/google-chrome. I searched the preferences, and was unable to find any place where this was defined. In the end, I just did: ln -s chromium-browser /usr/bin/google-chrome , and that seemed to fix it.\n\nA: There is one other Thunderbird setting you need to check. \nPreferences - Attachments - Incoming\nThe http and https settings there override the OS default and telling Chromium to make itself the default browser.\nSee this bug:\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=724461\nAnd this for the gory details about how the default browser is determined in Thunderbird:\nhttp://kevinlocke.name/bits/2012/07/18/thunderbird-default-browser-linux/\n\nA: This may help anyone stumbling across this later who has it stuck to Firefox\nGo to settings control panel, System -> MIME Type Editor, and set each to 'Web Browser':  \napplication/x-extension-html, application/x-extension-shtml, application/x-extension-xhtml, application/xhtml+xml, text/html\n\nThen in settings control panel, Personal -> Preferred Applications, choose chrome\nRun sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser\nand choose Chrome\nThen launch /usr/bin/x-www-browser and it should start chrome\nThen try in Thunderbird.\n\nA: I have never posted to any message board ever for over 10 years, but I thought I should share a solution here.\nI only switched to linux (mint, cinnamon at first and now xfce) 1.5 years ago.\nFor that entire time, I have been on a never-ending quest to somehow force thunderbird to open web links in the browser of my choice and always in a new window, not a new tab.\nMany times I have read about changing the settings of these to true:\nnetwork.protocol-handler.warn-external.http = true\nnetwork.protocol-handler.warn-external.https = true\nThis never did anything for me, until today, when I finally tried something new.  I have tried many, many times to edit my handlers.json file in my thunderbird user dir, and I was able to change the default browser for web links (my choice was chromium-browser), but I could never get it to accept the --new-window switch.\nTWO DISCOVERIES:\n\n*\n\n*If you rename the handlers.json, thunderbird WILL ask you what program to use to open your web link with, as the two above settings tell it to, because thunderbird makes a new handlers.json file and creates its contents from scratch.\n\n\n*If you create a bash script file (that you make sure to make executable) with these two lines as its contents:\n!/bin/bash\nchromium-browser --new-window \"$@\"\nand tell thunderbird to open web links with this script file, this works beautifully.\nSorry for the brute amateur posting and information, but this problem has haunted me for EVER, and I imagine that someone else out there might appreciate knowing about these two discoveries.\n:-)\n\nA: I was attempting to do the same with Chrome and none of the answers worked for me.\nWhat did work was running this single command from a terminal:\nxdg-settings set default-web-browser google-chrome.desktop\n\nNote that it did not work without the .desktop extension. I have no idea why and I do not have a google-chrome.desktop file in my home folder (which was the current directory while running the above command) or anywhere in my path. It probably does exist somewhere.\nThis setting has persisted across reboot.\nNote that Chrome was already my default browser, in that Chrome itself said it was the default browser, and every other application except from thunderbird was opening links in Chrome. However I did find out that xdg-open was opening urls in Firefox, and indeed the output of xdg-settings get default-web-browser was firefox (I had never set that and I had never chosen Firefox as browser for anything; this is a very recent fresh install of OpenSUSE; that either came out of the box or was set by Thunderbird itself).\nSo maybe there are two or more concepts of \"default browser\": the one defined by xdg-utils, which I haven't found a single application depending on except for Thunderbird, and then a more widely recognized one which I have no idea where it is stored, which Chrome itself recognizes as the way to establish itself as the default browser and that every other application I've ever clicked a link in understands.\nI realize I provide no background and I'm asking more questions than I answer, however this does provide an answer that worked for me, and the only one that did.\nActually this is for Chrome, so I cannot guarantee this works for Chromium, but it definitely seems like it's applicable.\n\nA: I was not able to use one of the methods above, but this worked for me (as of 2022-05-20) on Kubuntu linux 22.04:\n\n*\n\n*edit configs, change network.protocol-handler.warn-external.http and network.protocol-handler.warn-external.https to true\n\n*click on an http and then an https link in thunderbird; for each, a dialog will appear\n\n*importantly, in the dialog do not simply change it to \"Firefox\" (this worked once for me, but not thereafter). Instead: browse to /snap/bin/firefox (which is where firefox now lives in *buntu, I take it) and check \"always open\" with this app\n\n(Note: I had to delete (i.e. rename) my handlers.json because once it was set the \"warn\" configs no longer had an effect, and setting it through the GUI also didn't change anything. This may have side effects for other handlers, so be warned.)\nIf instead I used the \"Firefox\" option that was already in the dialog, the handlers.json file would be updated with values that did not work. I would get errors of this sort in the Thunderbird stdout console (I might have the formatting slightly wrong here):\nenv: \"http://blah.com\" No such file or directory\n...which makes sense if you see what it was trying to run (below).\nThe non-functioning handlers.json (just the \"schemes\" section):\n        \"https\": {\n            \"action\": 2,\n            \"handlers\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"Firefox Web Browser\",\n                    \"command\": \"env BAMF_DESKTOP_FILE_HINT=/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications/firefox_firefox.desktop /snap/bin/firefox %u\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        \"http\": {\n            \"action\": 2,\n            \"handlers\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"Firefox Web Browser\",\n                    \"command\": \"env %u\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"ask\": true\n        }\n    }\n\nThe functioning handlers.json, after I did things the way I described above:\n        \"https\": {\n            \"action\": 2,\n            \"handlers\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"firefox\",\n                    \"path\": \"/snap/bin/firefox\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        \"http\": {\n            \"action\": 2,\n            \"handlers\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"firefox\",\n                    \"path\": \"/snap/bin/firefox\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n\n\nA: Serge Stroobandt's answer is the full: https://askubuntu.com/a/172883/646650\nUnder Linux the\n~/.thunderbird/xxxxx.default/ \n\nfolder the json file must to be edited too.\nWith your favorite editor open the handlers.json file.

It's like it does a reboot instead of a shut down.\n\nA: I have had exactly the same problem on my Acer V5-571G: the laptop shuts down, turns off its power LED, and then starts again after a few seconds.\nThe problem seems to arise from incorrect work of pm-utils (which are replacement for laptop-mode-tools).

Installing 12.04 only on this laptop, so I create a /, swap, /boot and /home (all ext4) and then I want to create a ntfs for sharing data between Ubu and my windows VM. But the manual partition tool in the install doesnt have NTFS as a filesystem type in the drop down, only Fat or Fat32.. How come?\n\nA: I figured this out... The install partition tool doesn't let you create a NTFS logical part. However if you simply leave it as 'free space' after install you can use disk utility to format that free space as NTFS. Job done.\nNot sure why the partition tool during install doesnt let you create an NTFS partition though!\n\nA: If the builtin partitioner doesn't meet your needs, then download gparted.  It is available as a live CD so you can boot from it and work on your system disk while it isn't mounted at all.  It will not delete/reuse any existing partitions on your disk (e.g.Windows) unless you explicitly tell it to.  Of course, you'll have to first shrink an existing partition to free up space for the new partitions you want to create.\nhttp://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php/\nWhen I do a new install, I always start with this and get everything just the way I want it before the actual install.  Later, during the install, select manual partitioning and it will let you tell it what goes where.  gparted is easy to use (once you get used to it) and lets you preview and edit what it will do before it does it.  It handles ntfs easily.\nSince moving/resizing existing partitions can take a lot of time (hours), keep editing your gparted tasks until they do exactly what you want the first time, hopefully, resizing/moving each partition just once.\ngparted also allows you to change the labels on your partitions.  It's a good idea to edit these to make them meaningful like \"Windows\", \"root\", \"home\" so when you need to work on them in the future, you know exactly what's what without a lot of head scratching.\nIf you like things to look tidy, then, before you start, pull out your calculator app.  If you want a partition that's 30 GiB, then enter it's size as 30720 (1024*30 Mib). \n", "Q: Two 12.04 versions on one machine.

You can use testdisk (sudo apt-get install testdisk) which I have personally found to be quite effective.\nOr else, if you have just mounted/booted-into the 12.04 that has the home folder that contains no data, you can simply locate the other partition with sudo fdisk -l , mount it and copy/get your data from there\n\nA: # Mount the old partition to /mnt\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n# See if the files are there (assuming the username is the same on both installations)\nls -l /mnt/home/$USER/\n\n# Create dir for back-up and copy all the files from the old /home\nmkdir /home/$USER/recov && cp -R /mnt/home/$USER/* /home/$USER/recov/\n\nIf it gets mounted as Read Only, try; mount -o remount,rw /dev/sda1 /mnt\nEncrypted home\nIf you've encrypted your home directory on the old installation, it'll get tricky.\nIn that case, try the following:\n# After mounting\nchroot /mnt\n\n# Switch user\nsu <username>\necryptfs-mount-private\n\nYou can find a copy of your files at the given location.\nIf that doesnt work, try; ecryptfs-recover-private\nIf that doesnt work either, you're done.. and lost...\n", "Q: Problem video nvidia ubuntu 12.04 I just did a fresh install of ubuntu 12.04 on my PC (Dell precision 370) but the video is not working as it should.\nProblems: \n\n\n*\n\n*When I log in to unity 3D I get a transparent bar (where the firefox, libre office, etc icons are) but I can see the tooltips when I put my mouse over where the icons are, I can see the top toolbar with no problem and I see just white on the rest of the desktop! \n\n*When I log in using unity 2D I see the left bar cut in half (so I can't see the trash icon that is at the botton), the toolbar at the top shows OK and the desktop show OK but with some apps.

What is the rationale for the \"unix system resources\", or /usr directory, as described here, which duplicates many of the directory names under the root directory /?\nMy purpose: I'm installing Oracle JDK for the umpteenth time and decided this time to just put it under /home/user and I'm just reading around a bit to see if it is a bad idea on a single user machine.  \n\nA: There are the short version and the long version of your answer...\nHistory\nShort version:\nAs your link already said, /usr is a place for system-wide, read-only files. So all your installed software goes there. It does not duplicate any names of / except /bin and /lib, but originally with a different purpose: /bin and /lib are only for binaries and libraries required for booting, while /usr/bin and /usr/lib are for all the other executables and libraries. (now please don't ask about /sbin, this is the Short Version after all)\nNowadays, the distinction between required and not required for booting has diminished, since most modern distros, including Ubuntu, cannot properly boot without several files from /usr. And that's why there was a strong movement towards merging /usr/bin and /bin. Starting from Ubuntu 19.04 /bin, /lib (and /sbin) are just symlinks to their /usr counterparts, and since Ubuntu 20.04 they don't even exist anymore.\nBut maybe you are confusing /usr and /usr/local? Because yes, there is (and should be) a lot of duplicated directory names. More on that later...\nLong version:\nBack in the 70's, in Unix (yes, Unix, way before Linux), disks had little space (no hard drives yet!), and at a given point the system binaries grew too much in number and size to a point they would not fit a single disk, and developers had to split them across several media and thus create new mount points for them. /bin filesystem was full, so they installed the new binaries at... /usr/bin. And /usr was, at that time, their... user directory!\nAfter this split happened, which is almost embarrassing and often told as a joke/lore, they started to create artificial justifications and criteria to decide what would go to /bin and what would go to /usr/bin. The informal rule was: \"essential\" stuff go to /bin, \"the rest\" goes to /usr/bin. Same with /lib. It was not long before /usr became crowded with system-related directories mixed with actual users' homes. Thus /home was born, to hold all user-related directories and keep /usr clean for \"system stuff\" only.\nThis was long before the FHS exist. When it was created, it embraced and formalized that current tradition and kept the name /usr, although at that time it already had nothing to do with \"user\" anymore. So yes, fancy names like \"UNIX Source Repository\" or \"UNIX System Resources\" are all made-up names, and it's too late to rename it anyway. But, as we've seen it, not too late to toss /bin, /lib and /sbin into it. So /usr is now the main \"system\" directory.\n\"Ok, what about /usr/sbin?\", you ask. Damn, I was hoping you had forgotten. Ok... /usr/sbin is for commands that can only be (or are only meaningful when) executed by the root user, like mount and fdisk.\n\"But isn't that almost the same as /bin?\". Yes, sure, but...\n\"Wait, then why there is an /sbin too? That doesn't make any sense!\". Well, that's because of... err... humm... hold on...\nLook, a 3-headed monkey behind you!\nOk, hopefully, you got distracted enough. Moving on...\nIf you think I'm cheating, yes, I am indeed. But so is the \"official\" answer: \"Essential commands that can only be executed by root and must be available before you even mount /.\" What? Come on! Truth is: the line is indeed blurry, and there are lots of legacy names and paths that just \"stuck\" and now it is quite hard to get rid of.\nMore on the Case for the /usr merge, from systemd docs:\n\nThe historical justification for a /bin, /sbin and /lib separate from /usr no longer applies today. They were split off to have selected tools on a faster hard disk (which was small, because it was more expensive) and to contain all the tools necessary to mount the slower /usr partition. Today, a separate /usr partition already must be mounted by the initramfs during early boot, thus making the justification for a split-off moot. In addition, a lot of tools in /bin and /sbin in the status quo already lost the ability to run without a pre-mounted /usr. There is no valid reason anymore to have the operating system spread over multiple hierarchies, it lost its purpose.\n\nAnd an amazing reading about the /usr split and its rationale, by Rob Landley:\nUnderstanding the bin, sbin, usr/bin , usr/sbin split\n\nNowadays\nCurrently, regarding install directories, your the best way to understand is to think this way:\n\n*\n\n*/usr - all system-wide, read-only files installed by (or provided by) the OS\n\n\n*/usr/local - system-wide, read-only files installed by the local administrator (usually, you). And that's why most directory names from /usr are duplicated here.\n\n\n*/opt - an atrocity meant for system-wide, read-only and self-contained software. That is, software that does not split their files over bin, lib, share, include like well-behaved software should.\n\n\n*~/.local - the per-user counterpart of /usr/local, that is: software installed by (and for) each user. Like /usr, it has its own ~/.local/share, ~/.local/bin, ~/.local/lib.\n\n\n*~/.local/opt - the per-user counterpart of /opt\nSo where to install software?\nThe above list is already half the answer of you Oracle JDK question, at least it gives several clues. The checklist to \"Where should I install software X?\" goes by:\n\n*\n\n*Is it a completely self-contained, single directory software, like Eclipse IDE and other downloaded java apps, and you want it to be available to all users? Then install in /opt\n\n\n*Same as above, but you don't care about other users and I want to install for your user alone? Then install in ~/.local/opt\n\n\n*Its files split over multiple dirs, like bin and share, like traditional software compiled and installed with ./configure && make && sudo make install, and should be available to all users? Then install in /usr/local\n\n\n*Same as above, but for your user only? Then install in ~/.local\n\n\n*Software installed by the OS, or via package managers (like Software Center), and, most importantly, which any local modification might be overwritten when update manager upgrades it to a new version? It goes to /usr\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*This explains why default install prefix for compiled software is /usr/local, and why you should change it to ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local when installing software for your own user only\n\n\n*You may have noticed that all above directories are read-only (except, of course, when you install/remove software). The writable files (like config files) usually go to /etc (for system-wide software) and ~/.config (for per-user settings). Although many legacy software (and, unfortunately, some modern too) still use ~/.<software-name>, cluttering your home folder root with dozens of hidden dirs and files.\n\n\n*~/.local and ~/.config are not part of the FHS specification. FHS does not deal with user's home folder. They are an attempt of Freedesktop/XDG, another standard organization geared towards Desktop Environments (like Gnome, KDE, and Unity), to try to set some conventions regarding the structure of the user's home. Not all software adheres to it (for example, distros have only recently included ~/.local/bin in user's default  $PATH, and only if it exists), and no user is forced to follow it, but both gain many interoperability benefits if they do.\nI hope this helps to clarify things a bit. Feel free to ask anything so I can improve the answer!\n(and I also hope purists don't kill me for such an extremely informal language and explanation. It was intentional, and it surely has many inaccuracies, but I do believe it's a good way to make a newcomer have a brief overview understanding about install directories rationales)\n", "Q: Should I use 10.04 or 12.04? \n*\n\n*I heard a lot of things about power regression in Linux Kernel. After releasing 12.04 LTS, most of the issues have been cleared but not all.\nThere is an article on Ubuntu which says \"Its a mixed one\"..

Especially in switching hybrid graphics, installing binaries etc..\nUpdate 2\nPowertop results using 12.04 Live CD.\n\n\nA: I would not install 10.04 LTS on your system for a number of reasons.  Most importantly, I don't think 10.04 will install on your machine - your SandyBridge Core i5 was released significantly after April 2010, so Ubuntu 10.04 does not have drivers for it.\nAdditionally, your hybrid graphics system will be entirely unsupported, rather than merely requiring a bit of extra work - see this answer for how to get Ubuntu to turn off your discrete card (which will obviously reduce power consumption significantly).\nIf I switch all the relevant power saving knobs, my hybrid Core i5 laptop idles at around 9W with 12.04, which isn't terrible.\n\nA: There are way too many enhancements, fixes and improvements compared to 10.04 to just take into consideration the power consumption. Nevertheless, if this is a big problem, the latest updates to 12.04 have fixed many problems and they keep on coming.\nSo my recommendation is to move to 12.04 and update it to the latest available fixes you see on the Update Manager. Additionally you happen to have new hardware that is better suited for 12.04 than 10.04. 12.04 can provide better performance in general with that hardware. Not only that but most of the PPAs and up to date work that many developers are doing are for 12.04. For example bumblebee for your dual-video hybrid.\nI could make this answer very long if I start talking about what 12.04 brings to the table. For what is worth, in my PC which is a Core i7 Ubuntu loads and responds better than Windows 7 on the same machine. Boots faster and it feels just fast overall.\n\nA: 10.04 will not have any more security fixes issued as its desktop version's support was for 3 years. So you'd better start using 12.04 and slowly fix the issues with each security and performance fixes.\n", "Q: Elantech multitouch breaks after sleep and unknown events EDIT: I previously thought this was related to mouse, but I have been experiencing these issues without a mouse plugged-in during the past weeks.

But after I restarted Ubuntu the values are gone and rolled back to default.\nA guy told me to edit the xorg.conf file but there is no xorg.conf file in etc/X11.\nThanks and hope someone can give me a good solution.\n\nA: In the terminal, I ran \nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\n\nand the touchpad started working; the touchpad-tab was also visible in settings (mouse).\n", "Q: Where can I find a simple instruction for installing home version of windows office programs in a Ubuntu 12.04 environment Need help in installing Windows Office in Ubuntu environment\n\nA: First off: if possible, I would advise using LibreOffice. If more people use LibreOffice there will be one day a time more people use that than MS Office. Secondly, if you want MS Office use it with a license you bought and did not use on any other machine. Mind the fine print!\n\n\n*\n\n*Install \"play on linux\" from the repositories. You need to accept the EULA for the Microsoft corefonts.\n\n*After installing, go through the initial setup.\n\n*Open Play on Linux if it does not open automatically, and search for Microsoft.\nNow for the easy part, since I can finish this with images:\n\n(note: I have seen office 2010 in the list elsewhere, but it does not show up in my version :( )\n\n\n\n(note: here you need to put the location of your CD/DVD station; before it insert your office CD/DVD into the CD/DVD station). I do not have any MS products at home so the next images are from tuxtrix.com.\nIt should then ask what to install.\n\n\nAnd to top it off, here is a youtube video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaY1a4hxjpc\n\nA: Sorry, but there is no native Windows Office for ubuntu. You can try to run it with \"wine\" bit it will probably fail. But there is hope for you. There is \"LibreOffice\" should be already installed on ubuntu, which is 1:1 to M$Office, maybe even better. Try it\n\nA: Here's a successful guide for Office 2007:\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easily-install-microsoft-office-2007-linux/\nPeter is right though, Office 2010 is a crap shoot though. Unless you need Outlook or Access, I think you will be well served by LibreOffice.\n", "Q: TFTP Server atftpd fails to start I have installed atftpd on Ubuntu 12.04, but it looks like I cannot start the tftp server, and there's a problem also with the tftpd daemon.\nWith Ubuntu 11.10 there was no problem.\nureadahead will be reprofiled on next reboot\natftpd (0.7.dfsg-11) wird eingerichtet ...\nunknown protocol: udp4\n\nWith rlinetd, and also as daemon, it doesn't work.\nwith ps -afe I see no process.\n/var/log/syslog says it cannot bind to ip address.\nwith option --bind-adress  the atftpd server starts but also doesn't work.\n\nA: I've checked out atftpd source code, and find out that working line for /etc/default/atftpd is\nUSE_INETD=false\nOPTIONS=\"--tftpd-timeout 300 --retry-timeout 5 --port=69 --maxthread 100 --verbose=5 /srv/tftp\"\n\nYou need to specify port to fool atftpd.

However, this one doesn't seem to be anywhere, except in one place where someone is talking about not using Apple hardware. So here it goes. I am using Apple hardware. I have a MacBook 1,1 with Intel Core2Duo running Ubuntu Precise Pangolin flawlessly. I never considered starting with Mac OSx and dual-booting because I never liked Mac OS. Now that I'm realizing that the only way I'm going to be able to run my DAW (Reaper) nicely and use a Firewire recording interface is to run Mac OSx, I'm considering it again. I want to go the opposite direction of most people and install Mac OSx next to an existing Ubuntu installation and have a boot menu with refit. I've installed refit in Ubuntu and I've converted the .dmg file for Mac OS Lion to a .iso file. Now, should I mount the .iso in Ubuntu and run it there, or burn a DVD and restart? I'm trying to gauge how to do this without hurting my existing Ubuntu installation. I will of course keep looking for existing answers in the meantime.\n\nA: this is pretty unusual, but might work. There are some problems though. I myself never tried installing this way and i am pretty sure you will run into some problems. Almost certain you will have to reinstall grub and stuff.\nBe sure to make a backup of all your important files. And i would personally consider do install Mac OS X first, then Ubuntu again. You can but the lion installation and create a spare partition for ubuntu before installing os x.\nAbout the Lion DMG: If you have a friend with Mac OS X running, you can easily turn the dmg into a bootable usb drive or dvd. I think i followed this guide: http://lifehacker.com/5823096/how-to-burn-your-own-lion-install-dvd-or-flash-drive. However there a lot of them available, just try google. Mac sure your USB Drive is large enough and correctly formated (Apple HFS... you will lose all data on that drive).\n", "Q: how to restore boot folder? No laughing!\nI just did sudo rm -vr /boot/*.

MTP allows for you to access files on the phone while the phone does too, but with USB Mass Storage only one device can mount the storage at any one time presenting a problem.\nIf you have a newer Android phone then you will want to use one of the Ubuntu programs that can speak MTP.  I've used gMTP with success myself, there are (or were?) some problems with the MTP library but hopefully those will be fixed soon.\nIf you have an older phone that uses USB Mass Storage then we may need more info to help you.\nThe reason it works under Windows 7 (assuming that's what your using) is because Windows 7 has built-in support for MTP while Linux and OSX support isn't quite that well integrated yet.\n\nA: I bumped into the same issue here with a PadFone that can connect as either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mass Storage but restricted to a specific folder (for photos) and shows up in Nautilus\n\n*Multimedia device but doesn't show up in Nautilus\n\n\nTesting with gMTP...

So I have new MediaWiki instance install on a brand new Amazon EC2 instances. All is going swimmingly, until I have to log in via the web browser to configure it. Since I'm running on a hosted server, I can't hit http://localhost/mediawiki/config/index.php like the instructions say to. \nIf I try to hit it via http://<My IP address>/mediawiki/config/index.php, my browser just tries to download the file because anonymous browsing isn't enabled. I seem to be before LocalSettings.php is created, so I don't know how to move forward from here.\n\nA: Actually there is a splendid generic way of accessing remote resources as if they were local.\nssh -L 8080:localhost:80 username@EC2machine\n\nthis will tunnel the port 80 (the http protocol) , on your EC2 instance to your own computers loopback interface on the port 8080 \nSimply typing http://localhost:8080 on your computers web browser will redirect the request to your EC2 instance through the created SSH tunnel\nthe reason i choose 8080 instead of 80 for the loopback interface port, is that ports below 1024 are privileged and require sudo to be used.\n\nA: Note that there is a juju charm for mediawiki, though it is meant for higher scale installations which would have multiple web-heads and dedicated instances for MySQL, memcached, etc. To use it you can install and setup juju (see https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/) and then type\n juju bootstrap\n juju deploy mediawiki mywiki\n juju deploy mysql wiki-db\n juju add-relation wiki-db mywiki\n juju expose mywiki\n\nThis will run three EC2 instances (1 juju server, 1 mediawiki, 1 mysql). You can run it on one as well if you add 'placement: local' to your environments.yaml, but that is an undocumented hack that may be removed.\nThis should result in a running, working mediawiki at the address of the mediawiki server (visible by typing juju status mywiki). If you also add memcached, it will scale out pretty heavily with juju add-unit mywiki.\n", "Q: Update is not working for me ( i am on 11.10 ) it's been one week i am trying everything nothing is working.\nI tryed to upgrade ubuntu from 11.10 to 12.10.\nI tried the update manager but no sucess .\nI also tried update-manager -d Not working\ni tried sudo update-manager -d not working\nI tried sudo release-upgrade not working\nsudo apt-get update not working\nsudo apt-get upgrade not working too so basically i am trying everything.\n\nIN update manager , i did put the option for updating any version .\nANd i am on 11.10 ubuntu.

What could it be?\nIt would be nice if I could get them to rotate after reaching 256 MB or so. Can logrotate do that? How can I set it up to rotate files by size?\nI use Ubuntu 12.04 desktop 32 bit. \n\nA: You should look at the log files (tail -f /var/log/kern.log) to see what's filling them up so quickly. Something may be throwing errors and that causes them to grow. If you do, please update your question with your findings, maybe someone else can help determine what the problem is.\nAlso, there's no need to rotate them manually, they get rotated on a periodic basis (every day, with the 7 prior days kept in a compressed format, anything older gets deleted, except for /var/log/messages which rotates weekly with 4 prior weeks kept), look at /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog for the configuration. \nI agree that if your log files are growing boundlessly the best thing to do is find what's causing it, because it's not normal. As a parameter my kern.log is under 20 MB and it has information for the past 3 days (hasn't been rotated because the rotation task hasn't run).\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on UEFI enabled HP Pavilion HPE h9 tower I just bought a HP pavilion hpe H9 phoenix (i7, 8gb ram, 126 ssd & 2x500gb sata) and wanted to install Ubuntu 12.04 on it.\nBut the computer seemed to be uefi protected. So I turned this feature off in the bios. Then I succeeded to enter the conf menu in the live usb/cd mode (set language with F2, keyboard layout with F3, etc). I then launched the option to try Ubuntu without installing, but nothing happened: just a black screen.\nIs it due to the uefi/efi protection? Is this tower motherboard protected?\nDoes anyone have an idea about how to install any 'buntu on this tower or any uefi protected PC?\nIt is the first time something like this happend to me… I think I went through 100 of 'buntu installations before. I can't \"live\" without it…\n@+\nthanks\n\nA: There are two issues that I suspect you're conflating:\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI/UEFI -- The Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) and its more recent variant the Unified EFI (UEFI) is a successor to the ancient Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware. Linux installs fine on EFI-based systems, although there are still bugs, quirks, and gotchas of various types. Most modern UEFI-based PCs also provide a BIOS compatibility mode so that you can boot in either way. If you're trying to dual-boot with Windows and Windows is already installed and working in EFI mode, you should definitely use EFI mode for booting Linux; switching boot modes is awkward at best on most systems.\n\n*Secure boot -- This is just one optional feature of UEFI. It's a recent addition to the UEFI specification, and as of yet, I don't know of any computers that ship with secure boot support. (I could well be unaware of some new system that uses it, though.) Microsoft will require that secure boot be enabled on computers that ship with Windows 8 in order for those computers to get a Windows 8 certification.\n\n\nMy suspicion is that you ran into a UEFI compatibility issue, disabled UEFI in your firmware, and then ran into some other compatibility issue. If so, this has nothing to do with secure boot, and in fact it might be better for you to try to resolve the issue in EFI mode, particularly if you intend to dual-boot the computer.\nMoving forward, I recommend you answer these questions/perform these tests:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you plan to dual-boot with Windows?\n\n*If you plan to dual-boot, how is Windows booting, in BIOS mode or in EFI mode? You can find out by typing \"bcdedit\" in a Windows Administrator Command Prompt window and looking for the \"path\" line in the \"Windows Boot Loader\" section. If this line refers to winload.efi, then you're booted in EFI mode; if it refers to winload.exe, then you've booted in BIOS mode.\n\n\nIf you're currently booting Windows in EFI mode and you plan to dual-boot Linux and Windows, then your best bet is to get Linux to install in EFI mode. Alternatively, you could install Linux in BIOS mode and switch boot modes after installing.\nThe Ubuntu installer should start up in EFI mode, but precisely how to get this to happen varies from one firmware to another. You can verify that you've booted Ubuntu (including its installer) in EFI mode by checking for the /sys/firmware/efi directory -- if it's present, you've booted in EFI mode.\n", "Q: How to configure the touchpad middle click? In almost all the large modern Linux distributions and in the last releases of Ubuntu-based distributions the touchpad was configured out of the box to have right, left and middle clicks and you could configure them easily. The middle click is usually done with a two or three-finger tap.\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 I haven't seen where to enable the middle click and it is not enabled by default.\n\nA: You can enable it with the command synclient TapButton3=2 in the terminal, but that seems to get overridden on suspend+resume and after a reboot. \nPermanent solution:\nIt's explained for Xfce in this Xfce forum thread\nHowever, unity-2d (and I suppose also Unity) likes to fiddle with these settings on resume, and I have no idea how to disable that. maybe it's utouch, I don't really know.\nThe bottom line is that there is a way to configuring middle click permanently:\n\n\n*\n\n*add a custom startup application (under the 'gear' menu in unity on the top right) with any name you like, e.g. \"touchpad tweak\" and the command sh -c \"/usr/bin/synclient TapButton3=2\", then save it. \n\n\nThis is well and good until you suspend and resume. for that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal, and type gksudo gedit /etc/pm/sleep.d/80-synaptics-three-finger\n\n*Copy and paste the following text into the file:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Restore three finger tapping\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n        resume|thaw)\n                sleep 5;\n                /bin/su YOUR_USER_NAME -c \"/usr/bin/synclient TapButton3=2\"\n                ;;\nesac\n\n\n*Replace YOUR_USER_NAME with your login name - not the long one; e.g. use 'fred' instead of 'fred fuchs'. if you don't remember it, you can always type whoami in a terminal window and it'll tell you.\n\n*Save the file.\n\n*Make it executable; simply type sudo chmod +x /etc/pm/sleep.d/80-synaptics-three-finger in the terminal window. it will ask for your password.\nIf you did all this correctly, your system should retain three finger clicking as middle click after a suspend/resume cycle.\nNow that was fun and user-friendly, wasn't it? I can only wonder why unity silently meddles with synclient settings and wonder even more why there isn't a simple GUI tool to configure all of this. anyway, there you have it.\n\nA: Download synaptiks from the Software Center.\nOpen it, then go to Touchpad Configuration >> Tapping.\nSet your configuration there, as you would like.\n\nA: You can make it work and persist in Ubuntu 12.04, even afer suspending, following these steps.\nFirst, create a file with your script:\necho synclient TapButton3=2 > ~/touchpad_settings.sh\n\n(You could place the script in another directory, e.g. /usr/bin or /etc, if you wanted it to be in a more \"generic\" place, in case you have multiple accounts in your ubuntu installation.)\nThen make it executable:\nchmod +x ~/touchpad_settings.sh\n\nAnd finally, run the following command replacing \"user\" with your user name:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.input-devices hotplug-command \"/home/user/touchpad_settings.sh\"\n\nThen reboot, or logout & login, or restart GNOME.\nThat's all!\nFor more information about this fix, go here.\n\nA: I tried several solutions offered here, but nothing was working on my Toshiba Satellite. The trick seems to be the distinction between a \"touchpad\" which is a mouse pad with buttons adjacent to it, and a \"clickpad\" which is a pad with no adjacent buttons: you click the pad.\nThis Toshiba Satellite has a clickpad, so clicking in the corner didn't work, and I couldn't get three-finger click to work.\nBased on dllud's answer, I found I had to edit (on kubuntu) /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf based on information at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics#Buttonless_touchpads_.28aka_ClickPads.29 and I now have sections like so:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Default clickpad buttons\"\n    MatchDriver \"synaptics\"\n    Option     \"SoftButtonAreas\"  \"60% 0 82% 0 40% 59% 82% 0\"\nEndSection\n\nThis sets the pad to be 40% left button, 20% middle button, 40% right button. It still takes some practice to hit the middle correctly.\n\nA: I was searching for this and I found out that the touchpad has different settings for taps at the corners, and if you tap at the bottom right corner it does Right click. But if you tap at the top right corner it does Middle click. This is the default setting.\n\nA: Another option which might be simpler and avoids startup scripts is the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop the gnome settings daemon from overriding existing settings (font: Touchpad Synaptics - ArchWiki).\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.mouse active false\n\n\n*Edit the X11 configuration file for the touchpad.\nsudo -H gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf\n\nand add your button options under the section with the synaptics driver, like so:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"touchpad catchall\"\n    Driver \"synaptics\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n        Option \"TapButton1\" \"1\"\n        Option \"TapButton2\" \"3\"\n        Option \"TapButton3\" \"2\"\n        Option \"HorizTwoFingerScroll\" \"on\"\n        Option \"VertTwoFingerScroll\" \"on\"\nEndSection\n\n\nA: Touchpad with buttons\nI used to have a laptop with touchpad buttons, and to click both of them simultaneously to cause middle click emulation. \nTouchpad without button\nI now have a buttonless touchpad. Here is what I did:\nUse the following command to learn about your touchpad size values and configuration:\n$ synclient -l | grep 'Area\\|Edge\\|ClickFinger' \nLeftEdge                = 129\nRightEdge               = 3105\nTopEdge                 = 126\nBottomEdge              = 2211\nVertEdgeScroll          = 0\nHorizEdgeScroll         = 0\nClickFinger1            = 1\nClickFinger2            = 3\nClickFinger3            = 0\nAreaLeftEdge            = 0\nAreaRightEdge           = 0\nAreaTopEdge             = 0\nAreaBottomEdge          = 0\nRightButtonAreaLeft     = 1617\nRightButtonAreaRight    = 0\nRightButtonAreaTop      = 1916\nRightButtonAreaBottom   = 0\nMiddleButtonAreaLeft    = 0\nMiddleButtonAreaRight   = 0\nMiddleButtonAreaTop     = 0\nMiddleButtonAreaBottom  = 0\n\nThen use synclient var1=value1 var2=value2 ... syntax to modify those values to suit your needs. See the example command I give belo\nNote that:\n\n\n*\n\n*ClickFinger1, ClickFinger2 and ClickFinger3 options remap clicks when they are done with respectively one, two or three fingers left touching the touchpad.\n\n*Value 1 corresponds to left click.\n\n*Value 2 corresponds to middle click.\n\n*Value 3 corresponds to right click.\n\n\n\nHere is the command I ran and set in the Startup Applications Preferences window to configure my touchpad:\n$ synclient RightButtonAreaTop=0 RightButtonAreaLeft=0   MiddleButtonAreaTop=1916 MiddleButtonAreaLeft=1617  ClickFinger1=0\n\n\n\n*\n\n*RightButtonAreaTop=0 and RightButtonAreaLeft=0 unset the \"right button\" causing right click (I failed to use ivan-volosyuk's settings to have all three buttons set. I only have middle click). I use two-finger tap to produce right click. Not being able to maintain right click is not bothering enough to push me to find a solution.\n\n*MiddleButtonAreaTop=1916 and MiddleButtonAreaLeft=1617 set the \"right button\" to cause middle click.\n\n*ClickFinger1=0 Disables the special interpretation of the click which happen when one finger touches the surface at the moment of the click. Its previous value: ClickFinger1=1 caused my right clicks being interpreted as left click when leaving a non-clicking finger touching the touchpad.\nHack it the way you like. Maybe you'll do better than me.\n\nA: Just updating for Ubuntu 20.04:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Ubuntu Software and install \"Tweak advanced GNOME 3 settings\";\n\n*On \"Tweaks\" go to \"Keyboards & Mouse\";\n\n*On \"Mouse Click Emulation\" select \"Fingers\" option;\n\nThat's it: two fingers for right-click and three fingers for middle-click!\n\nA: synclient ClickFinger3=2\nsynclient TapButton3=2\n\nTo show the list of actual values:\nsynclient -l\n\nhope it helps (it did for me!)\n\nA: Check this.\nhttp://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?p=354960#p354960\nI have put on startup\nxinput set-int-prop 'SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad' \"Synaptics Tap Action\" 8 0 0 0 0 1 3 2\n\n\nA: Touchpad has different settings for taps at the corners, and if you tap at the bottom right corner it does Right click. But if you tap at the top right corner it does Middle click. This is the default setting.\nsimple bro works for me :)\n\nA: Clicking both left and right buttons at the same time works for some systems. \nSee the Xorg documentation and search for the term \"middle\".\nUbuntu 12.04\ntouchpad: Elantech \n\nA: synclient seems not working with me, so I used this command\n xinput set-prop 15 \"Synaptics Tap Action\" 2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3, 2\n\nand add it to .bashrc file, so it will execute on startup.\nLast value 2 sets three-finger tap to execute middle-click.\n\nA: If you look in the XFCE wiki for mouse/trackpad settings it will mention how \"Device Properties\" can be set. Unfortunately it's not complete because direct device settings have to be under Properties/ to take effect. For example, to make two finger touches middle click and three finger touches right click I need to alter \"Synaptics Tap Action\". Here's what it looks like initially:\n$ xinput list-props \"ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad\" | grep \"Tap Action\"\n    Synaptics Tap Action (298): 2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0\n\nTo have XFCE 4.12 set this it is necessary to do the following:\nxfconf-query -c pointers -p /ETPS2_Elantech_Touchpad/Properties/Synaptics_Tap_Action -n -t int -t int -t int -t int -t int -t int -t int -s 2 -s 3 -s 0 -s 0 -s 1 -s 2 -s 3\n\nNow we can see it changed:\n$ xinput list-props \"ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad\" | grep \"Tap Action\"\n    Synaptics Tap Action (298): 2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3\n\n\nA: I would recommend adding synclient TapButton2=2 and synclient TapButton3=3 to your ~/.bashrc configuration. To do this open a terminal and run:\n$ echo synclient TapButton2=2 >> ~/.bashrc\n$ echo synclient TapButton3=3 >> ~/.bashrc\n\nThen reboot your computer.\nThe synclient commands do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*synclient TapButton2=2 will set the two-finger tap to a middle button click.\n\n*synclient TapButton3=3 will set the three-finger tap to a right button click.\n\n", "Q: X doesn't start after Upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 I'm trying to upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04. \nI was making the upgrade over the X session of 11.10 i386.

Follow this link: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1969827\n", "Q: What's a good alternative to NVidia's proprietary drivers for a GF119 I have a Thinkpad T520 with switchable (Optimus) graphics. The integrated card is Intel, which works great, but won't drive a DVI monitor. The computer also have an NVidia GF119 (Quadro NVS 4200M) which I can set the computer to use full-time in the BIOS.\nThe problem is, the driver in nvidia-current is awful. It doesn't support xrandr or compositing extensions; I have to configure my monitors using its awful GUI app, then restart X server and hope for the best. Without the proprietary driver, Linux and X seem to be defaulting to a VGA display.\nIs there an alternative way to use my Nvidia GPU without using its awful drivers?\n\nA: You can use the open source nouveau drivers. Alternatively (a better solution in my opinion), you can use bumblebee and run in the \"nvidia optimus\" BIOS mode. This will run the main X server on your intel card and allow you to run specific graphic-intensive apps on the nvidia card with a command called optirun. With or without bumblebee installed, there is a program called screenclone that will allow you to use the DisplayPort/DVI output from the intel card by copying data from the intel card to the nvidia card.\nMore information on the graphics setup can be found here:\nhttp://zachstechnotes.blogspot.com/2012/01/tri-head-display-on-linux-thinkpad-w520.html\n(the W520 is similar to the T520 except for the VGA output)\nInstructions for screenclone can be found here:\nhttp://zachstechnotes.blogspot.com/2012/04/post-title.html\n\nA: The nouveau drives list your card as supported on their wiki under the code-name NVC0 http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/CodeNames\nYMMV.  Let us know if the nouveu drives work for you.\n\nA: Latest driver is 302.07\nAdded X driver support for RandR 1.2 and RandR 1.3. See \"Support for the X Resize and Rotate Extension\" in the README for details.\n", "Q: \"Recent Files\" entries via command line apps? I process lots of files via the command line, e.g. using my own shell or python scripts.  Is there an easy way to add the files that I manipulate to the Unity \"recent files\" list so I can then easily access them via the Unity dash?\n\nA: Unity uses a system called Zeitgeist for managing that kind of data. There are two proper ways to add things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Python scripts can add Zeitgeist entries using the higher-level Python API.\n\n*Your shell scripts can use dbus-send to work with the lower-level D-Bus API.\n\n\nHowever, I can't give an example because I haven't yet used either. (I use Lubuntu normally and I only know about Zeitgeist because my brother asked me to figure out how to clear out the Recent list in the Unity Dock)\n", "Q: Can I mount a Wubi .disk image in a new Wubi installation? I've bricked my Ubuntu Wubi installation and as a result I can't get to the log-in screen. The computer sits at a blank, off-black (that kinda deep red/brown) screen after I've selected which Kernel to boot.\nIs there any way I can install a fresh copy of Ubuntu via Wubi and then mount the old image?\n\nA: Ideally you'd use a live CD - since you might be able to repair the current Wubi install. If you need data off it you could also try ext2read, which gives read-only access to the root.disk from Windows. \nIf you decide to access via a new Wubi install, it's critical to copy the *.disk files outside the \\ubuntu directory before installing, since the first step of the Wubi install is to remove any existing install - and that deletes everything. Normally (on NTFS) there is only the root.disk that you care about, but if you install on a FAT32 partition or created a separate virtual disk for /home you can have others.\nLet's say you moved (quicker than copy) the root.disk to \\ubuntubackup\\root.disk. Then when you install a fresh Wubi on the same 'drive', you can mount the old one as follows:\nsudo mount -o loop /host/ubuntubackup/root.disk /mnt\n\nThen you can use nautilus (or some other file browser) to view the files e.g. from a command prompt you could enter: nautilus /mnt/home\nAttempting repairs\nWubi problems are often caused by hard reboots, perhaps after an apparent freeze. Forced shutdowns can damage any filesystem, but Wubi is more sensitive since it's whole partition is virtual, the root.disk. The steps to fix are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run chkdsk /f (or /r) from Windows. The corruption can be on NTFS and/or on the ext3/4 filesystem within the root.disk. In your case, you get past the grub menu, so it's probably only the ext3/4 filesystem, but I might run chkdsk anyway.\n\n*After chkdsk check that the root.disk is still there. This may sound strange, but Windows will sometimes move files it repairs to a hidden \\found.000 directory. It may rename the root.disk to chk0000.chk so look for it by size (5-30GB). See this for more info.\n\n*Now run fsck on the root.disk. You'll need to boot an Ubuntu CD or USB for this. Then mount the host NTFS partition. E.g. if your root.disk is on /dev/sda3:\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt\nsudo fsck /mnt/ubuntu/disks/root.disk\nOther possibilities\n\n\n*\n\n*You could try booting an older kernel.\n\n*Boot in recovery mode.\n\n*Check there's enough free space to boot (by mounting the root.disk from the live CD and then freeing up space if required, or resizing on the fly).\n\nA: You could possibly use wubi. Boot into the fresh Ubuntu and click 'Try Ubuntu' then you might be able to mount the old Ubuntu. I'm not sure you could boot into the old image though. but if you mount the old system you could possibly backup some files if you wanted.\n", "Q: Russian phonetic keyboard layout The keyboard layout GUI in 12.04 system settings is not responding on my laptop. In a different post a workaround was found (see: Cannot switch keyboard layouts). \nProblem now: Having manually altered the file /etc/default/keyboard I can now access all the keyboard layouts I want except for one: Russian phonetic. (i.e. the letters are placed where the equivalent Latin letters are - qwerty) This keyboard was in the old Gnome and it is still listed in the \"system settings\" keyboard GUI. But the GUI is not responding. \nI can toggle between the official Russian keyboard and Norwegian with the command: \nsudo setxkbmap -option grp:alt_shift_toggle no,ru\n\nBut ru phonetic is not understood. What is the code for the phonetic Russian keyboard?\n\nA: I use it like that:\nsetxkbmap -option grp:switch,grp:alt_shift_toggle,grp_led:scroll,compose:menu -layout 'us,lt,ru' -variant ',,phonetic_winkeys'\n\nThe main thing is 'us,lt,ru' and ',,phonetic_winkeys'. In your case it will be -variant ',phonetic_winkeys'\n\nA: I do not know what nationality you are. Norwegian?  I am Czech, so I use the standard Czech QWERTZ keyboard. So I prefer Czech Russian phonetic keyboard:\nsetxkbmap -option grp:win_space_toggle -layout 'cz,cz' -variant ',rus'\n\nThe problem is that this layout has switched YZ keys to the standard Czech keyboard. So I had to modify the file:\nsudo nano /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/cz\n\nFirst I found the section:\n// phonetic layout for Russian letters on an CZ (QWERTY) keyboard\nxkb_symbols \"rus\" {\n\nThere I changed these lines:\n//    key <AB01> { [       Cyrillic_ze,       Cyrillic_ZE,            z,        Z ] };\nkey <AD06> { [       Cyrillic_ze,       Cyrillic_ZE,            z,        Z ] };\n//    key <AD06> { [     Cyrillic_yeru,     Cyrillic_YERU,            y,        Y ] };\nkey <AB01> { [     Cyrillic_yeru,     Cyrillic_YERU,            y,        Y ] };\n\nThis way I got Russian phonetic keyboard with Czech QWERTZ layout. So I hope it can help you when you need more detailed setting of Russian phonetic keyboard even in Norway. :-)\nMost settings and options can be found here:\nless /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu in Virtualbox in Dropbox or Cloud? I would like to have a virtual machine of ubuntu , that I can access everywhere , without having to carry my Virtual HD , \ncould I put the VHD on something like dropbox or google drive and use it  there ?\nis this practical ? because as far as I know whenever I update the file , it will be uploaded to Dropbox or Google Drive or other cloud services , and if I run a OS it is gonna keep using updating the VHD file....\nis this idea practical?\n\nA: I don't believe that Dropbox could be used that way efficiently. The VHD file is going to change all the time when the VM is running. Dropbox calculates hashes of files to check them with its online copy (it also helps them to de-duplicate the data), it will take ages just to compute the hash of a 15 Gb file each time that it changes. Performance will be horrible.\nThat said, I know some people that are doing exactly that. The trick is to pause the syncing (using the dropbox indicator) while the VM is running. When they power off the VM, they enable the sync and wait until it is complete (it takes a while).\n\nA: You can also try Amazon Web Services EC2 [http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/][1]. EC2 is cloud computing facility. You can spawn a Virtual machine there and then install Ubuntu (or whatever OS) you want. There are free tiers in AWS.\nEssentially, here is what you should try:-\n1. Create an account on AWS.\n2. Launch a Micro instance\n3. Configure your OS\n\nA: The minimum requirements for an Ubuntu install is 15GB of hard disk space.  To back it up on Dropbox, you would need to go for their 'Pro50' plan which will cost around $10/month.\nFurther, you would need to ensure that the location you want to use the VHD from has a sufficiently speedy broadband connection, which may not always be the case.  \nI wouldn't call that practical, but as an alternative, I'd suggest carrying the VHD around with you on a USB drive and taking backups of the VHD on a regular basis, or creating a Live USB with persistent storage so that you can plug and boot wherever you go.\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu 12.04 on external HDD? I used to install Ubuntu 11.10 on my external HDD, it was working well, but after I installed 12.04 on my external HDD, it can't boot any more!\n\nA: just go through the same process you did for 11.10. You would just choose erase entire disk. you'll loose files though so I would click try Ubuntu and see if you could move any wanted files to a thumb drive or something.\n\nA: I had the same sort of problem.  I have a Windows 7 laptop with an external HDD connected via USB.  When I partitioned the external HDD and installed Ubuntu 12.10, it would not boot even when USB HDD was first in BIOS boot ordering.  I reinstalled with one change to make it work.  I chose to install GRUB on the internal HDD.  I have to choose a boot option everytime now, even if I am booting into Windows 7 with the USB HDD disconnected.  However, this is a small price to pay for this functionality.\n", "Q: How to modify the default position of desktop icons \nIs it possible to modify the default desktop icons position so that icons move a little bit to right. If yes, how? As far as I know, there is no tweak for that in Nautilus.\nWhen I click \"Organize Desktop by Name\", the icons get aligned to the left of Desktop: that's fine, but they're too close to the launcher when it's in AUTO HIDE mode. So when Launcher is revealed, it comes over icons. \nReproduce: Download some files from your browser or copy files/folders from a folder to the desktop, then these latter will be placed just like the screenshot. Their position is fine when the launcher is hidden, but when revealed, it hides a part of the icons.\nThere is no problem when LAUNCHER AUTO-HIDE MODE is disabled.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Perhaps you have the option for \"auto aligning\" activated (sorry I don't know how it's the name in English).  If you turn off this option you can set the icons where you want.\n\nA: You can move the icons with your hands.one left click on the icon and hold the mouse then drag the icon and drop it a little bit to right.then right click on empty space in desktop and mark keep aligned to correct the minimal displacing of the icons due to manual alignment.\n", "Q: Updated 12.04 RC to final, does not boot up I updated my 12.04 RC (64-bit) to kernel 3.2.0-24 and now it does not boot the GUI from grub.

I'm not for certain, but you might have to do a fresh install. at least that's what I would do.\n\nA: Same thing happened to me, however after booting back into the old kernel I just installed the proprietary ATI drivers for my video card from within the driver updater and then it booted using the newest kernels.

I took me several tries to find the sound card model that would detect the headphones correctly.\nThis link gives a list of sound card model: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1043568\nMore information can be found on the Ubuntu Wiki: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto\n\nA: I have something like this going on with my Sony VPCZ114GX, there is a workaround posted for my model at this bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/960124\nBasically involves loading up David Henninsson's hda-jack-retask from his ppa at  https://launchpad.net/~diwic/+archive/hda and then try Wouter van der Graaf's workaround on comment #7.\nAs for getting the model of your sound card, I tried the below. Although the problem may be that your machine doesn't know what model to use for sound in the first place.\n$ aplay -l\n** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices **\ncard 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: ALC889 Analog [ALC889 Analog]\n...  \nThen to get the model to put in alsa-base.conf:\n$ gunzip -c /usr/share/doc/alsa-base/driver/HD-Audio-Models.txt.gz |grep -i \"alc889\"\n  intel-alc889a Intel IbexPeak with ALC889A\n  intel-x58 Intel DX58 with ALC889  \n\nA: I had the same problem after upgraging to 12.04 on my Acer Extensa machine. Changing options of the snd-hda-intel module had no effect. After spending few hours by googling with no success I tried to look at the settings in alsamixer. And found that only one thing I had to do was enabling muting speakers at this Alsa mixer frontend.\nSo my solution was to launch alsamixer in console window and by using keyboard to enable this option. How easy....\nHope that help.\nUpdade: the exact name of the option is \"Auto-Mute Mode\"\n", "Q: How to run Compiz on Unity 2D, Ubuntu 12.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nUsing Compiz by default in Unity 2D \n\nWhen I try to run compiz on Unity 2D I can't use de Dash, and all my workspaces reduces to one single workspace.

Hoping there's a work around that doesn't require a windows 7 DVD. Thank you in advance.\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: You DO NOT need Windows disks and you DO NOT need to uninstall the previous Ubuntu in order to install a new version. You also do not need to boot into Windows to remove partitions. Just boot from Ubuntu 12.04 LiveCD and install on the same partition where your current Ubuntu is installed. During the install the partition will be re-formatted and GRUB re-installed, leaving no trace of your old installation.\n\nA: There are some free (and legal) boot repair disks here:\nhttp://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/\n\nA: I don't think that you need to re-install the MBR, but what you do need to do, is boot into windows (you can still do that right), and then delete your Ubuntu partitions, then from there you will be able to install Ubuntu 12.04. \n\nA: *\n\n*As your Ubuntu 11.10 system is broken, you can repair and upgrade it to 12.04 by booting on a 12.04 CD or USB, then install it above 11.10 via this method: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuReinstallation This will preserve your software configuration (/home).\n\n*If you really want to uninstall Ubuntu (or whatever OS), you can use OS-Uninstaller\n\nA: You can boot up with an Ubuntu live USB or CD and use the following command in a terminal window to fix the MBR.\ndd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr/mbr.bin of=/dev/sda\n\n", "Q: How do I solve emacs launcher icon failures?

Two solutions depending on whether you have a 32 or 64 bit installation, tested using Live CDs:\namd64\nsudo apt-get remove firefox openjdk-6-jdk icedtea-6-plugin\nsudo apt-get install firefox:i386 openjdk-6-jdk:i386 icedtea-6-plugin:i386\n\nRun Firefox, and log into your VPN.\ni386\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk icedtea-6-plugin\n\nRun Firefox, and log into your VPN.\nComplications\nIf you have other versions of Java or the IcedTea plugin installed, you are probably going to have problems. The two key points to note here are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Juniper VPN won't work with 64 bit Java, so whatever JDK you are working with, you need to make sure Firefox is using a 32 bit install of Java.\n\n*Juniper VPN will work with OpenJDK, but see point 1.\n\n\nYou can switch between installed versions of Java using the update-java-alternatives program.\nIf someone would like to update this answer to explain how to run 32 bit Java install for Firefox plugins, but use a different install for everything else, please do!\n\nA: The above solution is similar to another solution I answered here:\nRunning 32-bit Firefox with sun-jre in 64-bit Ubuntu\nI do however still have an issue with Network Connect and Ubuntu's new way of doing DNS queries.

I am trying 12.04 x64. How do I get it to work?\n\nA: I also experienced system hang at the SYSLINUX screen when attempting to boot from a 12.04 live Ubuntu usb key formatted with FAT32.  I reformatted the usb key to NTFS and copied the ISO to the key manually as well as with unetbootin and USB creator.  Nothing worked.  At least not until I read the previous answer.  \nI was using a 2 gb Kodak USB key that I got free with a Kodak photo frame.  I only used this key because it was the smallest one I had and at least 2 gb of space is required to make a bootable key.  After reading this post, I replaced the Kodak USB with a 4 gb Verbatim, formatted it to FAT32 and burned the ISO with USB Creator.  Ubuntu booted fine.  \nMoral of this story: Use a mainstream brand of USB key! \n\nA: *\n\n*Some USB sticks just aren't bootable, regardless of whether the data on them is otherwise bootable.  The stick itself has to support booting.\nIn my experience, I only have one (recent, 1GB or more) stick that simply won't boot.\nI would try another stick from a different brand.  Most Verbatim and all Sandisk ones seem to boot fine for me.\n\n*What hardware do you have?  Try booting with \"nomodeset\" and/or \"noacpi\" added to the command line.  In the Ubuntu live CD images you can do this just by pressing any key while the little CD icon comes up.\n\n*Did you know that you no longer need UnetBootin or the USB installer to put the Live CD onto a USB?  You can now just write it raw to the USB (eg, with Linux's dd command) and it will work just as if it was on a CD.\n", "Q: What is the most \"Ubuntu\" way of preventing certain users from shutting down, suspending etc?

What is it that gives users this ability in modern desktop environments and how would I go about disabling this on a per-user or per-group basis?\nI've seen a great method to prevent anybody from shutting down/suspending, but ideally what I'm looking for is to prevent certain users (such as, by adding/removing them from a certain usergroup) from being able to execute a shutdown, restart, suspend.\n\nA: As mentioned in the other question, you can control these actions via PolicyKit's local authority system.\nIf you create a file /etc/polkit-1/50-local.d/restrict-shutdown.pkla with content like:\n[Disable shutdown/etc for group restricted]\nIdentity=unix-group:restricted\nAction=org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.stop;org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.restart;org.freedesktop.upower.suspend;org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\nResultAny=no\nResultInactive=no\nResultActive=no\n\nThis will prevent any member of the group restricted from performing the matched actions.  Alternatively, if you want to restrict individual users, replace unix-group:restricted with unix-user:user1;unix-user:user2;....

Good luck.. \n\nA: What I did to make it work is edit the /etc/samba/smb.conf.\nChange the workgroup = WORKGROUP to workgroup = YOURDOMAININCAPS.\n\nA: Here you have a solution using the command line:\n\nFirst, you’ll need to install Samba. Make your way to a command prompt\n  and type this command:\nsudo apt-get install samba\n\nEnter your password to authenticate, and apt will download and install\n  Samba and its attendant utilities for you.\nIt’s important to realize about Samba is that it stores its own set of\n  user accounts, separate from the main accounts, in the\n  /etc/samba/smbpasswd file. That means you’ll need to create a separate\n  Samba password for every user you want to access your file shares. You\n  create this password using the smbpasswd command. For example, to\n  create a command for a user named camalas, here’s how the command\n  should look:\nsudo smbpasswd -a camalas\n\nBe sure to give camalas’s Samba account an appropriately strong\n  password...\n\n\n\n...the next step is to create a directory for her to share. Begin by\n  creating a folder named ‘test’ in camalas’s folder, which we’ll use\n  for our first shared folder:\nmkdir /home/camalas/test\n\n(NOTE: DO NOT use sudo to create the folder, because then the owning\n  user and group will be set as ‘root’, which means you won’t be able to\n  access the folder using your Samba username and password.)\nThe next step is to edit the /etc/samba/smb.conf file, the main\n  configuration file for Samba.\nsudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\nThe smb.conf file is long and rather complex, but for the purposes of\n  this demonstration, you can ignore most of it. Key down to the very\n  end of the file and insert this text:\n[test]\npath = /home/camalas/test\navailable = yes\nvalid users = camalas\nread only = no\nbrowsable = yes\npublic = yes\nwritable = yes\n\n(There should be no spaces between the lines, and note also that there\n  should be a single space both before and after each of the equal\n  signs.)\n\nThis solution works great for me!\nSource: http://www.jonathanmoeller.com/screed/?p=3608\n", "Q: How do I import email, settings etc. from 10.10 for Thunderbird in 12.04? I just recently installed 12.04 on my computer, and when I try to import email and settings from another drive, the import wizard asks, \"Import from\" but there's no dialog or browse facility to tell it where to import from.\nAm I missing something? How do I import when there's nowhere to tell it where to import from?  I'm using Thunderbird on both drives, the old OS is 10.10.\n\nA: If you have no useful Thunderbird settings on the new computer, it might be easiest to just copy your Thunderbird profile over directly.\nFirst exit Thunderbird and move its settings out of the way with the following commands in a terminal:\ncd ~\nmv .thunderbird thunderbird.bak\n\nNow copy over your old Thunderbird settings (assuming the other drive is accessible somewhere):\ncp -a /path/to/old/home/dir/.thunderbird .\n\nWhen you start Thunderbird again, it should be using the settings from your old drive.\nIf things do not go as planned, you can recover the settings from your new drive with:\nrm -rf .thunderbird\nmv thunderbird.bak .thunderbird\n\n", "Q: How do I add a new root folder to specific drive? I have /var on a separate drive and now I want to add /backup to that same drive. How would I do that?\nWhen I installed Ubuntu, I put / on an 80 GB drive and had a 250 GB drive use /var. I want my backups to reside on the 250 GB drive since they can take up quite a bit of space.\n\nA: Since you specified you'd like them both to be on the same partition on that drive, I'll give you some pointers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your existing /var mount probably mounts the entire partition, ie the root of that partition.  You can therefore only do that once.\n\n*You could, however, have both a /var and a /backup on that partition, ie have both of them one level down.  So instead of the root of that partition being your /var, the root of your partition will contain a \"var\" and a \"backup\" directory.\nYou would then need to mount that drive to one specific mount point, say /mnt/mydrive.\nThen, set up bind mounts from /var and /backup to directories within your /mnt/mydrive, eg to /mnt/mydrive/var and /mnt/mydrive/backup.\nThe use of bind mounts allows you to have them in your /etc/fstab just like a normal mount, but it allows you to mount only a particular directory, not the whole partition.\n", "Q: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, Error: unable to locate package When I try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop I get the error message: unable to locate package ubuntu-desktop.

Through this training, I solved the suspend problem. But after resume from suspend my USB ports become unavailable.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. And after a week of searching, I discovered what the problem was for me. In the Ubuntu kernel, the USB drivers are built-in. Therefore, upon suspend and resume, the drivers could not be unloaded and then reloaded as modules. So I had to compile the Linux kernel from source and made sure that the USB drivers (xhci_hcd and ehci_hcd) were made to be loadable modules.\nFrom there, I created a file named 20_custom-ehci_hcd in /etc/pm/sleep.d/.\n#!/bin/sh\n# Inspired by http://art.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9744970&postcount=19\n#...and http://thecodecentral.com/2011/01/18/fix-ubuntu-10-10-suspendhibernate-not-working-bug\n# Tidied by tqzzaa :)\nVERSION=1.1\nDEV_LIST=/tmp/usb-dev-list\nDRIVERS_DIR=/sys/bus/pci/drivers\nDRIVERS=\"ehci xhci\" # ehci_hcd, xhci_hcd\nHEX=\"[[:xdigit:]]\"\nMAX_BIND_ATTEMPTS=2\nBIND_WAIT=0.1\nunbindDev() {\n  echo -n > $DEV_LIST 2>/dev/null\n  for driver in $DRIVERS; do\n    DDIR=$DRIVERS_DIR/${driver}_hcd\n    for dev in `ls $DDIR 2>/dev/null | egrep \"^$HEX+:$HEX+:$HEX\"`; do\n      echo -n \"$dev\" > $DDIR/unbind\n      echo \"$driver $dev\" >> $DEV_LIST\n    done\n  done\n}\nbindDev() {\n  if [ -s $DEV_LIST ]; then\n    while read driver dev; do\n      DDIR=$DRIVERS_DIR/${driver}_hcd\n    while [ $((MAX_BIND_ATTEMPTS)) -gt 0 ]; do\n      echo -n \"$dev\" > $DDIR/bind\n      if [ ! -L \"$DDIR/$dev\" ]; then\n        sleep $BIND_WAIT\n      else\n        break\n      fi\n      MAX_BIND_ATTEMPTS=$((MAX_BIND_ATTEMPTS-1))\n    done\n  done fi\n  rm $DEV_LIST 2>/dev/null\n}\ncase \"$1\" in\n  hibernate|suspend) unbindDev;;\n  resume|thaw) bindDev;;\nesac\n\nI hope this works for you.

I just want to share my experience. try stopping some services like network-manager! like:\nsudo service network-manager stop\nI could not change my mac... but after stopping network-manager I could change my mac permanently.\nremember not to restart it, but to change settings during the stopped services!!!\n\nA: In general, your process will be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop network-manager\n\n*bring the interface down\n\n*assign the address and netmask (using ifconfig)\n\n*optionally create a route to a gateway if the interface is the one that will access the internet (using route)\n\n*bring the interface back up\n\n*and either:\n\n\n*\n\n*If DHCP-managed IP address assignment as defined in /etc/network/interfaces: \n\n\n*\n\n*do nothing. \n\n*service network-manager force-reload\n\n\n*If Static IP address assignment as defined in /etc/network/interfaces: \n\n\n*\n\n*change (or define) the IP, netmask, broadcast, gateway as needed \n\n*service network-manager start\nOf course, network-manager is capable of assigning static routes too.  Just define your static route in network-manager GUI and then service network-manager force-reload at terminal.  Done.\nOr switch back to DHCP-assigned dynamically by removing the static route definition from network-manager GUI, then service network-manager force-reload at terminal.  Done.\nOr you can do it...\nThe harder way\nWhich also happens to be the logically flawless, sure-fire way.\nThese instructions assume your interface is \"eth0\".  If it's not, you'll need to change all commands and areas entered to reflect your interface.\nFirst, check if network-manager is running:\nservice network-manager status\n\nIf it is running, right-click on Network-Manager and click \"Edit connections...\".  Select the [interface] you're having trouble with, and click \"Edit...\".  Click on the \"IPv4 Settings\" tab.  If you see any entries under \"Addresses\", delete them.  \"Save\" the settings, and close Network-Manager out.\nThen, at a terminal, these four command strings, replace brackets and inner bounds area with value:\nsudo service network-manager stop;\nsudo ifconfig eth0 down;\nsudo ifconfig eth0 [static IP you want] netmask [netmask; generally 255.255.255.0] up;\nifconfig eth0;\n\nYou should see that your interface now has the address you want, but we're not done.  To make the settings persistent (i.e., across reboots), you'll need to edit (as root) /etc/network/interfaces, and either find the section related to your [interface], or you'll add a new section, separating each section (each \"section\" defines one interface) by a blank line:\nExample (If already exists in file, looks like or similar to):\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nExample (Change to this, or add if doesn't exist):\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n      address [ip address goes here]\n      netmask [netmask goes here]\n      broadcast [for netmask 255.255.255.0, this should be x.x.x.255 where x from IP]\n      (optional here, if this is will be your internet interface, \"gateway [gateway addr]\" goes here)\n\nOf particular note is that you don't want dhcp-assigned IP, you want static-IP.  Note the difference in structure between the above two examples.\nSave it.  \nNow if this interface will be meant for internet or external routing (i.e., communication on the interface needs to be able to access IPs outside of the network of the interface, which is defined by your netmask ultimately), then:\nAt terminal:\nsudo route add default gw [\"inside local\" IP address of your router or other gateway]\n\nVerify your settings are correct with:\nsudo ifconfig eth0|grep addr && route|grep UG|awk '{print \"Gateway:\", $2, \"Interface:\", $8}';\n\nNow:\nsudo service network-manager start\n\n...to restart network-manager.  At this point you should be good to go.\nIn the future:\nIf you need to change your static IP to another static IP after this, it's as simple as sudo service network-manager stop as exampled above, sudo ifconfig eth0 down, edit /etc/network/interfaces as exampled above and changing the IP address to taste, sudo ifconfig eth0 [ip address] netmask [netmask] up as exampled above, and then sudo network-manager start as exampled above, in that order.\nIf instead you want DHCP to assign IP addresses automatically to the interface, it's as simple as sudo service network-manager stop as exampled above, sudo ifconfig eth0 down, edit /etc/network/interfaces as exampled above and remove the lines address, netmask, broadcast, gateway, and change the part that says static to dhcp, sudo ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 up, sudo service network-manager start.  Done.\n\nA: In my case, just disconnecting and reconnecting to the network after changing the static IP worked fine!\nIt might be worth a try.\n", "Q: Graphics corrupt after upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 I'm stuck at the moment with an ubuntu that boots into an unusable white screen after upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04.\nI've tried booting into safe X mode but it just throws me back to the safe menu every time.

I reboot and now in the splash screen I see \"Waiting for network configuration\" then \"Waiting up to 60 seconds for network configuration\" then \"Booting without full network configuration\".\nReading more online, I decide to keep /etc/network/interfaces the same, and edit file /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf:\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=true    # It was originally false\n\nThis changed nothing.\nWhen I run the command ifconfig -a:\neth0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:14:2a:03:f0:77\n    inet6 addr: fe80::214:2aff:fe03:f077/64 Scope:Link\n    UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n    RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n    TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n    collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n    RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n    Interrupt:22 Base address:0xdf00 \n\neth0:avahi Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:14:2a:03:f0:77  \n      inet addr:169.254.7.133  Bcast:169.254.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0\n      UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n      Interrupt:22 Base address:0xdf00 \n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n      inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n      inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n      UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1\n      RX packets:488 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n      TX packets:488 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n      collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n      RX bytes:38880 (38.8 KB)  TX bytes:38880 (38.8 KB)\n\nI find it weird that I have no inet address for first entry for eth0, and why two entries?  Actually, I don't know if that's unusual.  Reading further, I decided to try to force a static ip address, you can tell me if that makes no sense.  I changed /etc/network/interfaces to read:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\naddress 127.0.0.1\nnetmask 255.0.0.0\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.33.137.200\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 99.241.122.1\n\nand reboot.

Time to ask: any help is much appreciated!  I am teachable.\n\nA: Looking around there have been many problems and few solutions with the RTL8139 NIC.  Tried many many things and finally got it working.  I believe only the last step I performed worked, but I don't know for sure so I include all steps below.\nBased on advice at http:[double-forward-slash][triple w].question-defense.com/2010/06/03/ubuntu-10-4-eth0-not-available-rtl-81398139c8139c-rev-10, I ran the following commands:\nsudo mii-tool eth0 -F 10baseT-FD\nsudo rmmod 8139too\nsudo modprobe 8139too\n\nCommands seemed to  do something, but no output to the terminal.  But no luck, so tried things from http://forums.fedoraforum.org/archive/index.php/t-1679.html, and ran commands:\nsudo ifconfig eth0 down\nsudo rmmod 8139too\nsudo insmod 8139too media=0x01\n\nI got a complaint on running the last one, something about \"8139too file not found\", which makes sense -- I guess rmmod means remove module; and having run lsmod | grep 8139 before and after all the above commands, indeed, where I had two entries (including one for 8139too) I was left with only one entry (which starts with 8139cp).\nBut, still no luck.\nFinally, following advice at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1773402, I booted into Windows XP, and did the following\nRight click My Computer > Hardware > Device Manager; \nExpand the network interface card section and double click the Realtek one; \nLook around for \"Wake-on-lan after shutdown\" option, and set to \"enabled\"; \nReboot into Linux\n!!WORKED!! 8)\n\nA: I think your system is loading the wrong driver.

I had some work for FPGA on Windows, but now I want to change the platform to Linux. I am looking for some VHDL IDE instead of Xilinx?\n\nA: There's a big difference between the IDE (development environment) and the simulator.\nThe IDE might come without a built-in simulator, and the simulator might come without a GUI.\nIf you're looking for a simulator, here is a list of free VHDL simulators with download links. Most simulators work on Linux too.\n\nA: 'Altera Quartus 2' . . .thats what you are looking for . . its as powerful \n\nA: Historically, the electro engineers were mostly home in a Windows environment and also used to pay a lot for their working environment. This may constribute to an explanation why we do not see more Open Source IDEs for FPGA development. With the increased capabilities of FPGAs and the trend to run Linux on them, this is of course also affecting the development platforms. So, have many thanks for this question, which help in their very own way to broaden the FPGA Linux user base.\nFor regular-sized projects, when your code can be reasonably edited with regular text editors, I am tempted to say that Debian/Ubuntu Linux as a whole is already a completely Free (as in speech and beer) integrated development environment: the yosys pipeline was packaged so you truly get from the Verilog source code to a flashed Lattice FPGA, see http://www.debian.org/FPGA/Lattice. There is nascent VHDL frontent to yosys at https://github.com/forflo/yodl which I volunteer to package if I get your help testing it.\nOn a sidenote, the yosys pipeline works across all archictures of Linux. Especially to note are ARM and all the small devices like the Raspberry Pi.\n", "Q: How can I dual boot Ubuntu with Windows 7? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I install Ubuntu without removing Windows? \n\nCan you explain, How can I dual boot Ubuntu with Windows 7.

Its gone now though. My recommendation is to make sure you install the latest kernel update (i.e. make sure your system is 100% up-to-date) and try reinstalling your video drivers (if they are proprietary or otherwise self-installed). I've had issues with booting when I don't reinstall my ATI drivers after a kernel update, though I'm pretty sure they wouldn't cause an issue with shutting down.\nIf that doesn't work, you may want to look to see if there's anything in the system logs, though I'm not entirely sure which ones would be applicable.\n\nA: I have made a start up usb drive it has the same shut down issues in Unity. After installing gnome fall-back it would shut down using this. \nPlus I had shut down issues in my Acer netbook the gnome interface helped in the 11.0 version but the 12.0 versions shut down better after installing the newest updates the updates cleared up shut down issues in the older versions as well.

Everything working fine, except the process avahi-daemon is consuming a lot (60-90%) CPU.\nWhat is the avahi-daemon? Does it have something to do with Ubuntu One? I found guides on the internet on how to disable it, but I'm not eager to disable it, as it apparently has use.\nHardware: Dell Studio 1557, intel i5, AMD Radeon HD5470\n\nA: Avahi is a free Zero Configuration Networking (Zeroconf) implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to print to, files to look at and people to talk to. It is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). (Source: Wikipedia: Avahi (software))\nYou could try to restart the daemon by following:\nOpen up a terminal(CtrlAltT) and type: sudo service avahi-daemon restart.\n\nA: I don't understand why, but toggling WiFi off and then back on fixed this for me when the top answer (sudo service avahi-daemon restart) did not.\nUpdate: it's because I connected to a different network. Still not sure why that makes a difference, but if you can, try switching.\nMaybe the answer will come up here?\n(Ubuntu 19.04)\n\nA: In my case, one of my laptops uses a USB to RJ45 device. Once in a while (at least today it happened), when closing the laptop, the RJ45 may go berserk and start sending millions of packets non-stop. So fast and so bad that even Wireshark could not do anything about it and as you mentioned Avahi was going crazy (in my case it used around 33% CPU).\nMy WiFi would show the issue by not being able to keep up with the very high traffic, so as a result: no WiFi. (I have a similar issue when sending UDP packets on my network to handle some video system I'm working on). Note that did not completely kill the LAN network. I guess that's the advantages of having a 1Gbit switch...\nTo find the one connection that caused the problem, I had to disconnect each computer and see whether it \"fixed\" the WiFi. The WiFi itself was fine once that one laptop RJ45 was disconnected. I suspect that the USB device had just enough electricity from the RJ45 to continue to work when it should instead have been turned off.\n\nA: Unless you're networking via wifi to other devices, just remove it totally with: \"sudo apt-get remove avahi-daemon\" - you'll be glad you did, for it can occasionally be a glitchy piece of work...\nI've had problems with Avahi since Ubuntu 17.10 just trashing my wifi and disabling it requiring a reboot to get wifi back online. Just installed Lubuntu 18.04.5LTS on another laptop, and it began messing with my wifi on that computer too...\nI also believe it can be a security risk allowing unauthorized computers to mess with my wifi. Occasionally I'd have two (2) sets of wifi bars in the panel - weird! Other times it would drop wifi, reload, drop again and not be able to reload without rebooting. I have no use for it at all...\nI'm sure it can be valuable to some, but to novice users it can become an ongoing nightmare!!!\n", "Q: ISA Proxy server Have a proxy at work that runs Microsoft ISA. i used to be able to connect using 11.10 with firefox no problem at all. i could either put the settings in firefox or the settings in ubuntu network proxy settings.\nthis would give me a connection no problem ( slow due to the work network being really lame)\nsince i upgraded with 12.10 firefox just crashes if i have any proxy settings (manual added the proxy settings). if i connect to a diffrent network without the proxy settings it works fine and doesn't crash\ni tried chrome to see if that would work... simular problem. chrome doesn't crash but is so slow it just times out all the time and can take 10min for a page to load....\nnot really sure where to go with this? i have tried a clean install of 12.04 on 2 diffrent computers and also both tried just upgrading from 11.10. \nOnly answer i can see at the moment is role back to 11.10 :( \ni have tried all sorts like turning of IPv6 to see if that would make any diffrence but no joy... really am lost now. \nwhats weird is the repositys are also really really slow through 12.04. 50 megs took an hour to download (ISA server has Ubuntu rep servers enables without authenication).\nreally am lost\n\nA: I found the problem(after trying everything there is on the net).  \nAfter my own investigation I noticed (via a packet capture) that there is a continuous lookup for the host name(reverse) of the proxy server.\nAll I did to fix the problem was to add an entry to my host file for my prefered ISA proxy.

I wanted to share the home folder with the \"My Documents\" Folder in Windows, so i created an extra partition for this folder. Sadly, the ext3 partition didn't showed up, so i decided to format it to NTFS.\nNow, everything works just fine, but the audio fails. I can hear sound, but i can't change the volume. Neither on the Unity bar nor in the audio settings. On the bar, the speaker symbol has just three dahses behind it, the settings are greyed out. Also, my soundcard won't show up in the settings...\nAfter some reading i think i found out, that pulseaudio fails to start.

So I came up with adjusting the fstab:\n    # /home was on /dev/sda4 during installation\n    UUID=493A893161C9A186    /home    ntfs-3g    defaults, nls=utf8, umask=077, uid=user, gid=users, usermapping=/home/, dmask=002    0    0\n\nI listed usermapping=path in the options, because i've read that there is a usermapping on each NTFS Partition, located in a hidden folder ( .NTFS-3G ). But this folder doesn't exists too.\nIn order to repair my audio, i created .xinitrx and .xsession for pulseaudio. I don't know if this helps anyone...\nSo for conclusion: All i want is to adjust my audio volume, everything else is working afaik\n\nA: As it is possible to share data such as documents, pictures, video or music files on a NTFS filesystem we can not do so for the whole /home partition.\nUnlike standard Ubuntu file systems (e.g. ext4) NTFS is unable to handle our file permissions. This may lead to issues with applications not being able to read or write their settings located in a /home subdirectory. Pulseaudio is only one example here, you will likely see other similar errors.\nLet me therefore suggest you put the /home directory in a standard Ubuntu file system (e.g. ext4) and put only those data files that need to be shared with windows on a NTFS formatted partition. You will still have access to these data from Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Please assist to recover data after unsuccessfull upgrade to 12.04 Now my ubuntu shows the loading screen and doesn't load any further. I made a live cd and booted from it but I can't explore the needed files. I read that the partition with the installation has to be mounted but I'm not sure. Please help because my information is very important to me. 10x in advance.\n\nA: First of all find out which partition you have your data on. For doing this, you can boot into live, type in \"sudo fdisk -l\" which will show you all your partitions, try mounting them one by one till you find out which partition has your data, and once you have found out that partition, you can copy tour data from there.\n", "Q: Firefox addon that extract's YouTube URLs We have a country-wide ban on YouTube.com, which means that you can't watch or download YouTube content even educational stuff or documentaries. Proxy or VPN are next to unusable for watching or downloading ( the data rates are throttled as soon as the video or download begin ).\nI am after a Mozilla add-on or program which would allow me to retrieve only the direct URL to a video on YouTube.\nI intend to pass this as a command-line argument to 'wget' running on a remote server which can then download the video.I know this method works, since I have indeed managed to extract the link once or twice and use the 'wget' command on the remote server to get it for me. \nI've tried several YouTube downloaders for Firefox and they all want to take over the download themselves which of course will not work. \nAlso any links you get from the add-ons I tried ( some offer 'Copy Link' options ) are also useless for my intended purpose. \nAll I need is the link to pass on to a command-line tool such 'curl' or 'wget'.\nAs usual, thanks in advance for any feedback provided\n\nA: There are many Firefox add-ons that allow a user to download a YouTube video for off-line viewing at a later time.\nBut none seem to allow the user to actually obtain / extract the YouTube URL for the video. This could be  useful if one would like to download the video using a command-line tool such as 'wget' for example ( instead of Firefox's own download facility ).\nIn the above question I was looking for one such Firefox add-on.\nI have found one. It is called 'Bulk YouTube Video Downloader' or BYTubeD in short.\nThis extracts YouTube video URLS and displays a time-stamp together with a validity period ( good for knowing how long you have to access the video via the provided URL ).\nI've used it and it works a treat. The only thing is, on my shell ( ZSH ) the extracted URL, if supplied to 'wget' unquoted causes problems. So quote the URL. \nAlso, I found that you should explicitly provide 'wget' with a valid name under which to save the file ( use the -o flag followed by the filename you whish to give the downloaded video ).\n", "Q: SQLite stopped working after upgrade As many of you did, I upgraded from Lucid to Precise this week and almost everything seems to work find.\neverything except… SQLite, which was working well before but not anymore.\nI checked everything: phpinfo(), php.ini, sqlite3.ini.\nThe sqlite command works fine, but when I try to use PHP... *PLOP*, nothing works.\nI get the message\nFatal error: Class 'SQLiteDatabase' not found in /var/www/test/sqlite/index.php on line 4\n\nLine 4 being\n$db = new SQLiteDatabase('test.sqlite', 0666);\n\nAny hint?\n\nedit\nYou can see my phpinfo() here: http://pastebin.com/jQ7Bz0GN\nThe apache log is\n * Restarting web server apache2\napache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName\n... waiting apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName\n\n\nA: Extensions\nAccording to Vendor Specific Database Extensions page on the PHP site, there are two SQLite extensions:\n\n\n*\n\n*SQLite\n\n*SQLite3\nSQLite3 extension is a newer replacement of SQLite, which soon will become obsolete:\n\nThe SQLite extension is enabled by default as of PHP 5.0.\n  Beginning with PHP 5.4, the SQLite extension is available only via PECL.\n\nUbuntu 10.04 vs 12.04\nNow, some practicalities. Let's have a look at default web server configuration that was installed using:\nsudo apt-get install apache2 php5 php5-sqlite\n\nUbuntu 10.04:\n# php --ri sqlite\n\nSQLite\n\nSQLite support => enabled\nPECL Module version => 2.0-dev\nSQLite Library => 2.8.17\nSQLite Encoding => UTF-8\n\n# php --ri sqlite3\n\nsqlite3\n\nSQLite3 support => enabled\nSQLite3 module version => 0.7-dev\nSQLite Library => 3.6.22\n\nUbuntu 12.04:\n# php --ri sqlite\n\nExtension 'sqlite' not present.\n\n# php --ri sqlite3\n\nsqlite3\n\nSQLite3 support => enabled\nSQLite3 module version => 0.7-dev\nSQLite Library => 3.7.9\n\nSo, Ubuntu 12.04 default PHP installation (as of writing this - version 5.3.10) already does not have sqlite extension as built in. The output above states that only sqlite3 extension is present, which came from php5-sqlite package.\nSolution\nPick your evil:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right approach in long term would be to adapt the code to get it working under SQLite3. The changes would be minor, but this might involve some unwanted copy-paste-style work on a big amount of files. If this is the case, and right is not a right word here, solution 2 is for you.\n\n*Install obsolete extension from PECL.\n\n\nA: Following Andrejs Cainikovs' answer and strongly advising you to upgrade the code, here  some examples of what kind of work should be done, when migrating from SQLiteDatabase class (sqlite library) to SQLite3 class (SQLite3 library).\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*SQLiteDatabase -> SQLite3,\n\n*SQLiteDatabase::unbufferedQuery -> SQLite3::query,\n\n*SQLiteResult::fetchAll(SQLITE_*) -> SQLite3Result::fetchArray(SQLITE3_*) etc.\n\n\nAs for fetching, in old SQLite we had:\n$rowsIMEI = $db->unbufferedQuery($imeiSQL)->fetchAll(SQLITE_ASSOC);\n\nforeach($rowsIMEI as $r)\n{\n    ...\n}\n\nWhile, in new SQLite3 we should:\n$rowsIMEI = $db->query($imeiSQL);\n\nwhile($r = $rowsIMEI->fetchArray(SQLITE3_ASSOC))\n{\n    ...\n}\n\nOther changes requires similar amount of work, so this shouldn't be a life-time process.\nBefore you begin, you have to first use a tool like SQLite Studio to convert your database file from 2.1 to 3.0. Size can be lowered by even a half, so I think it is something worth fighting for.\n\nA: Solution (NOT for production, just for play):\n1. Get \"php5-sqlite\" deb file from ubuntu11.04 or any other\n2. Extract it and find file sqlite.so\n-- You can get sqlite.so in other way, for example from Your old system --\n3. Put sqlite.so to /usr/lib/php5/20090626+lfs/\n4. Add this to php.ini (/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini):\nextension=sqlite.so\n\n", "Q: Linux kernel 3.3.4 Under Ubuntu 12.04 I just installed kernel 3.3.4 using the instructions from: \nhttp://www.upubuntu.com/2012/05/how-to-install-linux-kernel-334-under.html\nAnyway, now when I try to log into this version I just get a black screen that just hangs and nothing happens.\nDoes anyone have any ideas??\nThank you!\n\nA: Piskvor wrote: \n\nDid you try booting into one of the previous kernels?

Grub seem to detect that the computer supports uefi but does not understand why the efi partition is missing.

This was after migrating my Ubuntu 12.04 installation to a new laptop.\nSolution: Uninstall gnome-terminal using Ubuntu software center and re-install it right afterwards.\n\nA: Yeah, it is a bug of some systems. Read it here. Maybe there can be other work around to it. I will post it tomorrow, if that is so.\nMaybe the weather applet is causing the problem. If then, just give a try to cut the weather applet from the conf file under .config/cairo-dock/current_theme everything may work fine.\n\nA: I was having similar problems. I couldn't consistently get the terminal to show up in the dock, and even if it did, it might not show up via Alt+Tab, or clicking the icon might not do anything or might create a new terminal window rather than switching to an existing one. Here's how I finally managed to \"fix\" it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an executable shell script file containing just the following:\n#!/bin/bash\ngnome-terminal\n\n\n*Create a .desktop file linked to that shell script; I did this by running gnome-desktop-item-edit /usr/share/applications/gterm.desktop from inside a terminal window (you need the gnome-panel package; if you need further instructions, you should be able to find them by Googling \"gnome-desktop-item-edit\").\n\n*Open the directory containing the .desktop file, and run it by double-clicking. (You might need to first make sure you don't have any terminal windows open.) You should see an icon for it appear in the dock. Right-click on that icon and select \"Lock to Launcher\".\nYou should now have a properly working dock icon for your terminal. Apparently the fact that it's running a shell script, rather than running the terminal command directly, gets around whatever was causing the problems.\nIf anyone has a cleaner solution, I would love to see it. But unless and until that happens, I hope this method can at least help people get things working properly on the surface.\nEDIT: After going through all this, I did something that required a reboot. After the reboot, there was an icon for the actual Terminal in the dock, in addition to the one for the shell script I had created. Both icons seem to work how I would want them to, so I've deleted the shell script one. So a reboot might be all that's needed. I'll leave the shell script method here in case anyone can't get this working just by rebooting.\n\nA: I had the same problem when I uncommented the three blocks under the /* notebook */\ntag in \n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/gnome-terminal.css\n\nto fix another bug.\nI've fixed this problem restoring such file, clicked over terminal icon (on the dock) when it restarted and clicked on \"Keep on the launcher\".\nI uncommented again the same blocks and it works.\n\nA: I was having similar problems with icons, the launcher and ALT-TABbing.\nThe fix, for me, was to disable the call to conky in my machine startup script.\nNOTE: I just transitioned from v1.9 of conky to v1.10. Before disabling it, conky v1.10 was erroring out (conkyrc translation issue).\n\nA: A similar thing happened to me in gnome-shell after I've upgraded to Ubuntu 19.04.\nI say \"similar thing\", because the Terminal window did show up for me when I press ALT+TAB, but it did not show up in launcher.\nThe way I fixed it was to go into Activities Overview (ALT+F1 or super), search for the Terminal app, right click it, and choose Remove from favourites.\nAfter that it started showing up correctly, even after I added it back to favourites.\n", "Q: How to shift my shared folder from /mnt to Desktop in ubuntu?

Specifically it says:\n\nThis program makes use of the Zend Scripting Language Engine: Zend\n  Engine v2.3.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2012 Zend Technologies\n\nDoes that mean that the base install of a LAMP server includes Zend?  We don't use Zend anywhere in our stack, and I don't love the idea of it being installed on our computers without any specific use.\n\nA: AFAIK zend engine is the core of php and according to wikipedia its vm of php. I think you cannot avoid zend engine if you need to work with php. But if you are talking about Zend-Framework it won't install during LAMP installation.\n\nA: I don't quite understand your question. To run PHP code, you need a program that can understand understand PHP. This is either Zend Engine (the branch by Dmitry called PHPNG has been merged on v7.0), Websphere sMash,  Phalanger, HipHop VM,  HippyVM, Parrot, Quercus, or some other  program.  (Note: Every engine is saying that they are faster than every other engine. Note note: Zend admits \"...it's a fact that HHVM is slightly faster, by 10%\".)\nYou had most likely downloaded a PHP engine from Zend since your phpinfo() is showing \"program makes use of the Zend Scripting Language Engine...\" which is exactly what you would have seen if you had downloaded it from php.net/releases:\nC:\\php-5.6.7-Win32-VC11-x86>php -r\"phpinfo();\"|find/i\"zend\"|find/i\"engine\"\nThis program makes use of the Zend Scripting Language Engine:\nZend Engine v2.6.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2015 Zend Technologies\n\n(Above is Windows' find command.

I killed vino-server, and the non-stop errors to ~/.xsession-errors stopped.\nI am not sure that the vino-server is being \"attacked\", because in my case, the Ubuntu box is inside my VPN, and not accessible from the Internet.\nHowever, I do use VNC from my MacBookAir (MBA) to remote into the Ubuntu box, and thus, there may be some kind of bad interaction between the MBA VNC client and the Ubuntu VNC server (vino-server).\nPerhaps someone else can explore this.\n\nA: I just wrote a post in the forums of what I found to be the root cause of this issue. In my logs it appeared as if what caused the log file to grow so large was a brute-force attack. The log filling up is a result of the failed attempts to authenticate to your system's VNC server. After a certain number of failed attempts it appears as if the VNC server just starts rejecting the attempted connections without giving them a chance to authenticate (which is good). Luckily, if these are still happening then most likely they haven't hacked you yet. Check out my post if you are interested.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=12507381&postcount=9\n\nA: I have no idea how to see what's causing the problem, but I deleted the .xsession-errors file, then touched it by root.

Just installed 12.04 on a laptop; I still have 10.10 on a server so I can compare directly and not just rely on my memory.  Generally 12.10 is ok but the UI has taken a major step downhill.\nI have reverted to gnome classic which goes most of the way to the old look and feel but the icons will not stay where I put them. They either go to the left or the right or the centre but I want them where I put them, so that I get reasonable spacing.\nI have had a look at the settings via dconf-editor: I looked for something like 'snap-to-alignment' or the like but found nothing. I have a bad feeling that this may be some new feature of the underlying UI widget, i.e. in the source, rather than a configurable value. \nThe answer from here: How can I evenly space icons in the panel? is to use Active Window Navigator and stop fighting with the current panel.\nIs that the best I can do?\nThanks,\nJohn\n\nA: Ok, this page and some more googling gave me the answer: How to revert to GNOME Classic Desktop?  That is, the options are a) work with Unity b) use the option for 'classic gnome' in gnome 3, which has some small differences from the gnome 2 panel such as the one I asked about above c) downgrade to, say, 10.10.

I do not want to discuss about C++ or any programming language!I just want to know what am i doing wrong with linux ubuntu about compiling helloworld.cpp! \nI am learning C++ so my steps are:\nopen hello.cpp in vim and write this \n#include <iostream.h>\nint main()\n{\n    cout << \"Hello World!\\n\";`\n    return 0;\n}\n\nSo, after that i tried in the terminal this \ng++ hello.cpp\n\nAND the output is \nhello.cpp:1:22: fatal error: iostream.h: No such file or directory\ncompilation terminated.\n\nWhat do you suggest? Any useful step by step guide for me?Thanks!\n\nA: You should use #include <iostream>, not iostream.h; the .h form is very old and deprecated since years.\nYou can read more than you probably want to know on the .h vs non-.h forms here:\nhttp://members.gamedev.net/sicrane/articles/iostream.html\n(Plus, you should write std::cout or have a line using namespace std; otherwise your next error will be about the compiler not finding a definition for cout.)\n\nA: You should change iostream.h to iostream. I was also getting the same error as you are getting, but when I changed iostream.h to just iostream, it worked properly. Maybe it would work for you as well.\nIn other words, change the line that says:\n#include <iostream.h>\n\nMake it say this instead:\n#include <iostream>\n\nThe C++ standard library header files, as defined in the standard, do not have .h extensions.\nAs mentioned Riccardo Murri's answer, you will also need to call cout by its fully qualified name std::cout, or have one of these two lines (preferably below your #include directives but above your other code):\nusing namespace std;\n\nusing std::cout;\nThe second way is considered preferable, especially for serious programming projects, since it only affects std::cout, rather than bringing in all the names in the std namespace (some of which might potentially interfere with names used in your program).\n", "Q: Can't change Flash settings from Chrome neither Firefox I'm getting a problem since Ubuntu Natty until Ubuntu Precise, and I guess it's Unity-related.\nThis image describes my problem:\n\nI'm on my pc with Ubuntu Precise and I open any Flash content, like Flash animations on the web.

Sometimes I need to use some Flash-based online services that uses Mic and Webcam, like Big Blue Button web conferencing system used in distance education per example. Everytime I run a Flash content that needs to use any external device, like Mic or Webcam, the same dialog shown in step 3 pops up and asks for my confirmation to use external device. Since I'm on Unity 3D, I can't press button that gives permission for using my device on Flash, because that window stays locked. This way I end up stucked.\nAnyone know a solution for this problem?\n\nA: This is known problem which happens when you are using composite manager (Unity 3D, Gnome with Compiz…) and the site with embedded Flash has scrollbars.\nTo make Settings window responsive, you need to use fullscreen. For example go to YouTube video, switch it to fullscreen and then open the Settings (it may take two or more attempts before the window actually opens).\n\nA: This problem has been around for a while and it affects me too.

So how can I do it?\nAlso some files like hosts and hostname cannot be edited.  Any clues on this? I guess they are read only.  How can i make them writable?\n\nA: The files appear as read-only because you don't have enough permissions to modify them. If you want to use the GUI, you run your editor from command prompt like:\nsudo gedit\n\n\nA: I don't think this is necessarily a serverFault topic, more like superuser...but you should be able to change permissions via chmod.\nI'm assuming you're the file owner, in which case\nsudo chmod u=rwx\n\nMIGHT (emphasis on the might) work to give you permission to mess with the file outside of sudo.  the u+rwx specifies that the 'user'(owner) of the file gets the r, w, and x permissions (read write execute).\nI'm by no means a linux expert, but that seems like it should work.

I switched to this type of system indicator when upgrading to 12.04 (I previously used a different one that showed only a single bar graph, but I could not find that one again after I updated)\nHere is a link to the multiload-indicator that seems to be causing the problems:\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/02/easily-monitor-system-resources-in-ubuntu-with-indicator-multiload/\nNote that I use this in the gnome-panel (below) rather than that indicator bar that it at the top.\nSince I have disabled this multiload-indicator, the problem has not happened once.\n\nA: This problem seems to be caused by the open source nouveau driver.

Does anyone know the solution for this problem? I'm not worried about security, so i don't need it locked.\n\nA: I recommend you simply remove xscreensaver by typing sudo apt-get remove xscreensaver This will solve your problem, if you don't need a screensaver,  your screen still turns black by your energy safe settings.\n\nA: On a fresh Lubuntu 18.10 install, I went to Preferences > LXQt settings > Session settings and unchecked Lock screen before suspending/hibernating and that seems to have done the trick.\n\nA: I think you have to disable the \"lock\" in two different places. First, open the power manager. You can click on the power icon in the panel and select \"preferences\" or it should also be in Menu -> Preferences -> Power Manager\n\nDe-select \"Lock screen....\" under the \"Extended\" menu tab.\nSecond, open screensaver preferences. Menu -> Preferences -> Screensaver.\nAgain, de-select \"lock screen...\" at the bottom of the window.\nCREDIT: http://lubuntutips.blogspot.com/2012/06/lubuntu-screensaver-lock.html\n\nA: For default setup of Lubuntu 14.04, the locking can be disabled via Preferences -> Light Locker Settings. In my case, \"Automatically lock the session\" was \"Never\", yet the session was still being locked after around 10 mins of inactivity. So I turned \"OFF\" the \"Enable light-locker\" setting, which did the thing for me. I also disabled all \"locks\" in Power Management as in @algebralives's answer.

Of course, if I don't move between desktops for a while, then it becomes bumpy again.\nCould it be because my Nvidia graphics cards (I have two) are running as \"adaptive\"?\n\nA: If you're running the 295.40 version of the Nvidia driver (apt-cache policy nvidia-current should show you) and you're using older Nvidia hardware - this is a known issue.\n295.40 was released to address a security issue in the .33 version but this also had a major impact on performance. Nvidia have released a beta driver since this which does improve things (for me) but if you can, dropping back to version 295.33 will fix things too (albeit leaving you with the security issue).\nIf you can survive, hold on with 295.40 until 302.07 hits a PPA (likely ubuntu-x-swat will have it first) then install the PPA and upgrade. If you can't wait, you can look for a 295.33 installer (I couldn't find one) or manually install 302.07 from Nvidia's website.\n\nEdit: A new stable version (295.49) has been released and should hopefully start to trickle through to Ubuntu now.\n\nA: I don't know if this would help you or not, but try it and let me know if it makes a difference. I have this on my NVIDIA config to always force the power usage on my card to stay at Performance and not fluctuate between various power levels.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal:\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf`\n\n*Under Device Add:\nOption \"RegistryDwords\" \"PowerMizerEnable=0x1; PerfLevelSrc=0x2222;\nPowerMizerDefault=0x1; PowerMizerDefaultAC=0x1\"\nGood luck.\n", "Q: How can I remove Ubuntu from my system and install the Windows bootloader? I want to completely remove Ubuntu from my system. But if I delete the partition, the Grub files will be deleted and that will leave me \"Bootloader-less\". How can I workaround this?\n\nA: You can either boot into Windows (you seem to have an existing installation) and install EasyBCD (free for non-commercial use) to fix the bootloader, or boot with the Windows install disc, which gives you an option to repair the bootloader as well.\n\nA: Removing Ubuntu and fixing the Windows bootloader\nBoot up a live CD or USB and delete your Ubuntu (ext4 and swap) partitions using GParted. You can expand your Windows partitions at this point as well. Then, open up the terminal and use these commands:\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install lilo\n\n*sudo lilo -M /dev/sda mbr\n\nWhen you reboot, you should boot straight into your Windows install.\n\nA: This is the simpliest method I can think of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Windows;\n\n*Download mbrfix from http://download.cnet.com/MbrFix/3000-2094_4-10485990.html;\n\n*Extract the package and copy mbrfix.exe to your favorite directory;\n\n*Open a command prompt as an administrator, navigate to your favorite directory (cd);\n\n*Enter the command: mbrfix /drive 0 fixmbr and confirm.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nNow the Windows bootloader is back.

However, as soon as my Desktop wallpaper image appears, the mouse and buttons no longer respond to input. The keyboard continues to work normally. Given that it works on the login screen but not the Desktop environment, I'm not sure whether or not this is an issue with X.Org - I've got no idea.\nThe mouse in concern is a built-in synaptic touchpad.

That didn't work, while the above command did. I don't know what those extra arguments do, but they work.\nOh, and it still works when xserver-xorg-input-synaptics is installed, so you can reinstall that if you've taken it out. Also, new versions of the xserver-* packages have just been released, so upgrading is probably a good idea. I have, and everything still works.\nOne restart later and my mouse is working perfectly.\nThanks to the folks on Launchpad.\n", "Q: How can I remove wallpaper and use just one color background in the new Ubuntu 12.04?

I would like to use a terminal based mail client for my e-mail activities. I've been suggested to use alpine for it. But how do I configure it in Ubuntu to read my gmail mails? \n\nA: It's quite straightforward to configure Alpine to access your gmail account via the imap protocol, and there are many tutorials online such as this article.\nAs you probably know, the first thing to do is to go to the settings in your gmail account and make sure imap is enabled for your account.\nThen fetch Alpine with\nsudo apt-get install alpine\n\nAlpine was developed at the University of Washington; it is a successor to the old Pine email program; more details are available here at the official site, although there is further development going on at the re-Alpine project. Indeed, the Alpine version in the repositories is re-Alpine version 2.02-3.1.\n\nThe following tutorial describes a minimal way to setup Alpine so that you can receive and send mail.\nStart up Alpine in terminal by typing alpine, and you come to the main screen.\nFrom that main screen (M) go to setup (S) > add a new collection (L), as in the screenshot below. Add the name of the collection (Gmail) and imap.gmail.com:993/ssl/user=me@gmail.com in the server box (adding your proper gmail address of course). \nSome guides such as this one and many others will recommend the novalidate-cert option to be added in the above imap line (and in the smtp line quoted later), but it is not necessary with the current version of Alpine, as there is no problem with the certificates.\n\nThen go back to the main menu and go to setup > config (C) and place all your details in the appropriate boxes, as in the screenshot below, with this time adding also the smtp server (smtp.gmail.com:587/tls/user=me@gmail.com) and specifying your inbox path and personal name:\n \nNow save and exit back to the menu. Now with this basic setup you should be able to read and send mail. If you want, you can exit the program and the load it up again to check everything has configured correctly, and the main screen should be something like this:\n\nThere are a lot more customisations that can be made and settings experimented with (the users' configuration file is .pinerc in the home folder), and you can even export Thunderbird mail to view in Alpine, as I discuss here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I use Thunderbird local folders in Alpine mail client?\n\nA: From M S C the following entries in config:\nUser Domain                       = <No Value Set>                                                                                   \nSMTP Server (for sending)         = smtp.gmail.com/novalidate-cert/user=hawat.thufir@gmail.com/ssl                                   \nNNTP Server (for news)            = localhost                                                                                        \nInbox Path                        = {imap.gmail.com/novalidate-cert/ssl/user=hawat.thufir@gmail.com}INBOX                            \nIncoming Archive Folders          = <No Value Set>                                                                                   \nPruned Folders                    = <No Value Set>       \n\nplus manually adding the following by opening .pinerc with an editor like vi or nano to add the IMAP folders:    \n# List of directories where saved-message folders may be.

Optical Wheel Mouse\n\nOk, I get Bus 001 Device 007 and an ID of 046d.\nNow I look for the right file\nSince I changed to the righ directory, I just execute the following\nfor i in *\ndo\necho $i\ncat $i/idVendor\necho \"--\"\ncat $i/busnum\ncat $i/devnum \necho \"++\"\ndone | less\n\nAnd look for the ID i retrieved before \"046d\"\n1-3.3\n046d\n--\n1\n7\n+++\n\nthe diretory is 1-3.3 ( in my case )\nso \ncd 1-3.3\n\nAuto-switch off??? sure... just check the right directory\ncd power\n\nand\ncat autosuspend_delay_ms\n\nIn my case the time to auto switch off / turn off of the led indicator ( the red light ) was 2000 ms about 2 seconds.\nThis part may be optimized, originally I proposed:\nNow the trick is to change it, using a plain sudo gave some problems so I created a small script to do so, the content of the script was: ( just create it in the tmp )\necho $2 > $1\n\nuse vi, gedit, kate, gvim, bla bla bla \nnow change the permissions\nchmod 755 your_script\n\nand now launch it with a sudo\nin my case i adjusted auto turn of to 10 minutes--> 60000 ms\nsudo /tmp/your_script 60000 /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-3.3/power/autosuspend_delay_ms\n\nBut it can be done just by\necho 6000 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-3.3/power/autosuspend_delay_ms\n\nIt seems that echo and sudo do not get along.\nThanx John!\nAnd that did the trick for me\n\nA: As explained here: \nTo disable autosuspend your USB device, first use lsusb as root to find out\nthe bus number and device number of your usb device:\nThe command sudo lsusb should give an output like this:  \n\nBus 005 Device 014: ID 04b3:4485 IBM Corp.\nBus 005 Device 001: ID 0000:0000\nBus 004 Device 009: ID 0483:2016 SGS Thomson Microelectronics Fingerprint Reader\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 0000:0000\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000\nBus 001 Device 008: ID 04b3:310c IBM Corp.\nBus 001 Device 007: ID 050d:0121 Belkin Components F5D5050 100Mbps Ethernet\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000\n\nThen find your device's directory in /sys/bus/usb/devices/.  Look in\ndirectories that are named with two numbers separated with a dash:  \nThe command ls /sys/bus/usb/devices should give an output like this:  \n\n1-0:1.0  1-1  1-1:1.0  1-2  1-2:1.0  2-0:1.0  3-0:1.0  4-0:1.0  4-2\n4-2:1.0  5-0:1.0  5-6  5-6:1.0  usb1  usb2  usb3  usb4  usb5  \n\nCommands --> output:  \ncd /sys/bus/usb/devices && cat 1-1/busnum --> 1 \ncd /sys/bus/usb/devices && cat 1-1/devnum --> 8 \ncd /sys/bus/usb/devices && cat 1-2/busnum --> 1 \ncd /sys/bus/usb/devices && cat 1-2/devnum --> 7 \nWe know the USB to ethernet device's directory is 1-2 because the device and\nbus numbers match the lsusb output.  Now we can tell the kernel that it should not\nsuspend this device automatically if it is not being used. \n\ncd /sys/bus/usb/devices && sudo echo -1 > 1-2/power/autosuspend\n", "Q: Bumblebee : Module bbswitch could not be loaded I've upgraded to 12.04 and I had to switch from Ironhide to the latest version of Bumblebee.\nNow, when I try to run bumblebeed, I get this error:\nFATAL: Module bbswitch not found.\n[ERROR]Module bbswitch could not be loaded (timeout?)\n[WARN]No switching method available.

I can't disable it from the BIOS because I use it on Windows. My card is an nvidia 540M.\n\nA: bbswitch is the kernel module that is used for disabling the nvidia GPU. Be sure to install the Bumblebee PPA as described in Is a NVIDIA GeForce with Optimus Technology supported by Ubuntu?. Installing Bumblebee from that PPA also retrieved the bbswitch-dkms package. If you do have this package installed, the likely reason of failure that the kernel headers for the installed kernel are missing.\nIn that case, update your kernel including headers:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nReboot. If the problem still persists, try explicitly installing the headers for the loaded kernel:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\nIf the module is still not loaded, try removing bbswitch completely and reinstall it:\nsudo apt-get purge bbswitch-dkms\nsudo apt-get install bbswitch-dkms\n\n", "Q: Mysqld not starting on boot? After upgrading to Pangolin, mysqld is not starting on boot.  I've looked into various other MySQL issues with the Pangolin release, and I haven't seen the same issue that other people are having (mysqld bouncing, etc).  Once I run it from the command line, it runs just fine.\nWhere do I add the command to start the service on boot?\n\nA: While I was looking for a solution to the same symptom, I found out there are a lot of things that can go wrong and prevent mysql(d) from starting. If you can manage to start it from the command line with the proper user:\nsudo -u mysql mysqld\n\nAnd that conversely it fails as a service:\nroot@my-linode:~# service mysql start\nstart: Job failed to start\n\nThen check the upstart log in /var/log/upstart/mysql.log. If you find the following error message:\n[ERROR] Fatal error: Please read \"Security\" section of the manual to find out how to run mysqld as root!\n\nThen you've found the culprit. To fix it, specify the mysql user in /etc/mysql/my.cnf\nuser=mysql\n\nRestart with start mysql and you should be good.\nAgain, there are many possible cause to this error (apparmor, incorrect privileges on the socket file, insufficient disk space, insufficient memory during the upgrade to mention a few I stumbled upon). This is only one of them. Thanks to this guy.\n\nA: sudo service mysql start should start mysql. It is an upstart job, so the full job can be seen at /etc/init/mysql.conf\nYou probably need to check /var/log/mysql*, as there may be issues with the upgrade table process that are causing problems.\n\nA: This solved it for me during the 11.xx 12.04 upgrade:\nsudo touch /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.mysq\nI could start it in safe mode but not in regular mode.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Well here is the problem, maybe your's is a domain problem. Mysql would have been installed in the other user profile and just could not start due to profile issues.

It was ok in the past but something has broken some months ago and my bank client authentication Java applet stopped working. Now I have to reboot to Windows and use it from there. I have installed (and am using for different purposes) Oracle JDK (manually, from official Oracle distribution files) on XUbuntu but I think Firefox Java plugin still uses OpenJDK. How to set up and make sure Firefox to use a specific Oracle JDK?\n\nA: Thanks to @fossfreedom, I've set up Firefox to use Oracle JDK as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've removed IcedTea plugin. Curiously, apt-get remove said it is not installed but Synaptic helped.\n\n*Then I've made a link with\nln -s /opt/jdk/jre/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so ~/.mozilla/plugins/\n\n*At this point it was looking like Java plug-in is installed (shown in Firefox's plug-ins list and showing no error pop-ups on applet pages) but it didn't work actually: an animated java logo symbol was appearing instead of applets.\n\n*Then I've tried to open my banking applet and was asked if I trust Oracle Java. After confirming this Java applets began to work fine on all the pages.\nUnfortunately this haven't solved my actual problem - banking still doesn't work (fails to log-in with correct key file and password).\n", "Q: How to switch 'default' sound device controlled by hardware keys in Xubuntu? I installed xubuntu-desktop on a 12.04 Ubuntu upgrade after finding Gnome3 lacking. I've mostly been happy, but I've found an odd and frustrating bug. My laptop has two sound 'outputs' - an HDMI-out plug I never use, and the onboard speakers/headphones. For some reason, the hardware keys have been mapped to the HDMI output, even if I set it as 'fallback' in pavucontrol, and notify-osd only displays changes in the HDMI output (though the panel indicator volume control controls onboard sound). I'd ideally like both hardware keys and notify-osd to be looking at the onboard sound, though if I can't get notify-osd it's an acceptable loss. Having to click through a bunch of stuff to change volume is driving me crazy, though. \nGoogling suggested that it /may/ be a Pulseaudio/ALSA conflict, but the hardware keys seem to change at least indicated volume in pavucontrol for HDMI as expected (I don't have an HDMI cable to test actual sound output)\n\nA: For those who do not have /active-card, it is not needed anyway, nor is the xfce4-mixer.\nThe sound is going through PulseAudio and therefore the \"default\" device is selected by the configuration of PulseAudio, and xfce4-volumed will only change the \"default\" outputs volume.\nHowever you can use PulseAudios configuration tool for this, pacmd.\n$ pacmd\nWelcome to PulseAudio! Use \"help\" for usage information.\n>>>\n\n\n\n*\n\n*First list the devices on your machine\n>>> list-sinks\n\nIt will print a lot of information about your devices, and as visible they all have an index\n2 sink(s) available.\n  * index: 0\n    name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_03.0.hdmi-stereo>\n        ...\n    index: 1\n    name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo>\n        ...\n\n\n*You need to set your preferred device as default. As you can see (the little star, i.e. *, before index:0) my HDMI was the default and I wanted the Analog output.\n>>> set-default-sink 1\n\nYou may need to kill xfce4-volumed and restart it, to have the desired effect without full system restart:\n    $pkill volumed\n    $xfce4-volumed\n\nBut basically, that is it.\n\nA: I got a clue somewhere to look in \nSettings / Settings Editor (not the normal Settings Manager)\nThen, under xfce4-mixer, there was the setting /active-card\nwhich had the value:\nPlaybackHighDefinitionAudioControllerDigitalStereoHDMIPulseAudioMixer\nI selected 'active-card', and hit the 'Reset Property' button. That turned the setting into:\nPlaybackBuiltinAudioAnalogStereoPulseAudioMixer\n( These names closely follow the names of the Output Devices in pavucontrol see screenshot )\nAfter a reboot, it worked. My volume buttons now affect the volume in the speakers.\n(Scrub my earlier, now deleted, hint/comment about Play/Pause not working. They (still) work fine in Rhythmbox - that was/is an unrelated problem with gmusicbrowser)\nThis may or may not work for you! :-)\nEDIT: For some reason, my xfce profile got corrupted and I've restarted from scratch by rm -rf ~/.config. Now, only a few days later, resetting it didn't work for me either, but setting /active-card to PlaybackBuiltinAudioAnalogStereoPulseAudioMixer did.\nEDIT: If the above did not work try setting this via terminal and xfconf, e.g.\n    xfconf-query -c xfce4-mixer -p /active-card -s 'PlaybackBuiltinAudioAnalogStereoPulseAudioMixer'\n\n\nA: This fix will also fix the volume control on the Logitech G930 Wireless gaming headsets. (Not sure about the other buttons though) Launch Settings / Settings Editor (not the normal Settings Manager) or open a command prompt and type xfce4-settings-editor\nThen, under xfce4-mixer\nAnd replace the active-card setting marked Value: to\n\nPlaybackLogitechG930HeadsetAnalogStereoPulseAudioMixer\n\nI've included an image to make it easier to understand\nAlso if have problems with the headset volume working here's a link that may help\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/xfce4-volumed/+bug/901338\nBasically do a killall xfce4-volumed and try moving the volume on the headset again\n\n\nA: In KDE without editing config files, I was able to fix this by right-clicking the volume icon in the task bar and selecting Select Master Channel....\nThis brought up a KMix dialog where I selected Built-in Audio Analog Stereo instead of GK110 HDMI Audio. Immediately after clicking OK the volume keys on my keyboard started working.\n\nA: Peters answer also worked for me. However resetting the /active-card deleted the entry. I just added it again:\nname: /active-card\ntype: string\nvalue: PlaybackBuiltinAudioAnalogStereoPulseAudioMixer\n\nRebooted and I did get an crash-report from /usr/bin/xfce4-volumed, but the controls work again.\n\nThanks!\n", "Q: How do I install VMware Player 4.0.3 (and patch the installer to work on my 12.04 system)?

The Ubuntu virtual machine (VirtualBox) is running on a Debian desktop. I did some research and found I had to forward port 22 from the router to the virtual machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*I changed the network setting on the VM to bridge.\n\n*I'm forwarding the port to the VM.\n\n*I checked (http://www.yougetsignal.com/) to show the port as open.\n\n\nBut when I try to connect it is still not working. ssh username@ -- connection refused\nIs there anything I have to do inside the virtual machine to allow incoming connections? Or forward any port?\nIs there anything I'm doing wrong, any help would be greatly appreciated!!\n\nA: By default VirtualBox works in \"NAT\" mode, meaning that it builds a \"virtual\" network and translates network accesses from the VM so that to the outside world, they appear to come from your actual computer. \nVirtualBox makes the VM think it's connected to a network, but in reality VirtualBox is providing network services, including a mini DHCP server. Then, VirtualBox does network accesses \"on behalf\" of the VM, making it appear as just another application running on your PC.\nHowever this means that the outside world doesn't really know about the VM and can't access it directly.\nI think the port redirection you did was from your home router to your PC, not to  the VM. You may be missing some configuration on the VirtualBox side. Apologies if you already did this, but your question was not clear about this.\nBasically you have to change the VM's network configuration and set it to \"Bridged\". What this does is, it creates a virtual interface on your PC and makes the VM use that to access the outside world; anything coming into or going to that interface gets piped to the VM. Thus, the VM will be visible as just another machine in whichever network your PC is connected to (it even has its own MAC address!).\nThen, depending on your network's configuration, the VM may get a DHCP address like any other PC connected to your router, or you may need to configure a static IP address for it. This depends on how your network is set up.\nOnce the VM has a \"real\" address, you can, on your router, follow the instructions you found to route port 22 to the VM's IP address. This should work as you expect it to.\nIf it doesn't:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look at your VM's firewall configuration (iptables -L -n). Is it blocking anything?\n\n*Set up another computer on your local network, and try to SSH to the VM's IP address. If you can, then you need to double-check the forwarding configuration in your router. If you can't, you need to recheck the VM's SSH and firewalling configuration.\n\n\nA: from what I can gather, your problem lies in your server computer network, because once you setup vm network to bridge mode, you are good to go (check with ssh <your.vm.ip.number> on your server command line - not in vm).\nyour server is behind a router, just like a vm using NAT in your machine. \nYou need to contact your server network administrator so that he/she can put forward your vm's local ip address to a port/range of ports (make sure your vm have a static ip address). \nYou can do it yourself if you had the authority on your server gateway to do so.\na bit of visualization:\nInternet\n     '---ROUTER (SERVER1 and SERVER2 use NAT on this router)\n            |   (vm1, vm2, vm3, vm4, vm5 need to be forwarded on this router)\n            | \n            '--- SERVER1 (vm1, vm2, vm3 use Bridge)\n            |       '---vm1\n            |       '---vm2\n            |       '---vm3\n            '--- SERVER1 (vm4, vm5 use Bridge)\n            |       '---vm4\n            |       '---vm5\n\n\nA: Looking at the situation you have, it seems that you need to configure the firewall for your vm with  $ sudo ufw allow ssh\n\nA: Able to do this in \"NAT mode\" as well,\nFound Oracle VM Virtualbox has got a port forwarding feature,\nGo to Virtualbox settings > Network > Adapter (NAT) > Advanced > Port Forwarding\nAdvanced > Port Forwarding\n", "Q: Broken xorg.conf file If I break the xorg.conf file and I can't startup Ubuntu 12.04.

So with that being said, when will Gimp 2.8 come to the software repository?\nAlso, rather than just getting the answer is there a place on the Ubuntu interwebs some where that I can check the status for other packages as well?\nOr is this all done internally at Canonical?\n\nA: In October 2012, as part of the 12.10 release.\n(GIMP 2.8 was released on 3rd May 2012. The 12.10 release is the first after this date. And 12.10 definitely contains version 2.8.)\n\nA: Exceedingly well managed projects have target dates for versions on their project roadmap.  It appears as of this time that GIMP does not.  \nSomething you can see easily is if the version you want has been packaged in the alpha/beta of the next release.  If it is, you may have some luck in features showing up in backports(although not full version updates...versions freeze for stability reasons).

When I type \"nau\" in the search bar of the applications-HUD the result is a \"Home Folder\" folder and a \"Files\" folder installed but the \"Files\" has a Home drawing in it and is recently used, whereas the \"Files\" doesn't and is not recently used. The search result also returns some tools for Nautilus but with different icons and I can't see any nautilus in the HUD. Where is this guy Nautilus and how is its face?. This is puzzling!. I can't find Nautilus!. In addition, When I select the folders \"Files\" and \"Home Folder\" I can see no difference between the windows dispalyed  for \"Home Folder\" (without Home) and the \"Files Folder\" (with a Home), and none of them is the real \"home\" folder where all the users have their files!!.\nI would rather have everything in Chinese, ha ha.\n\nA: Nautilus is your graphical file browser. \"Files\" and \"Home\" in the HUD both launch Nautilus in my Home folder in 12.04. Don't remember this behavior in 11.10, but then I never paid much attention to it in the HUD instead preferring to launch it from the Launcher or a command line.\nNo matter how you launch it, it's still Nautilus the file browser. Much like Windows Explorer (not internet explorer) was the file browser for Windows whether you launched Explorer or clicked Computer in the menu. To verify it's still the same Nautilus no matter how you launch it, just Click HELP and select ABOUT.\nOnce you launch Nautilus which ever way you prefer, you can always revert to the entire File System by clicking File System in the Computer menu along the left.\n\nA: Just about the icons - \nThere are 3 .desktops installed by default concerning nautilus. They have a 'display' name & an actual file name\n'Files' - nautilus.desktop, used by gnome-shell, Classic sessions (will show as recently used when browsing nautilus as root\n'Files' - nautilus-folder-handler.desktop, is included for users upgrading from pre 11.10 or otherwise there would be some issues\n'Home Folder' - nautilus-home.desktop, used by unity sessions, doesn't use the icon with the 'home' in it because it was felt that would confuse users\n", "Q: Unity does not start automatically, have to start it manually After upgrading to 12.04 the system starts up normally, and shows me the login screen.\nAfter I log in, unity does not seem to start up and shows me a small XTerm window.\nI start unity manually from there by typing into the command.

I recently installed the latest version of Ubuntu, and I noticed that when you try to click on an icon in the launcher, unless you wait for one second or drag the icon to the right, you will not be able to rearrange the icon. What would the purpose of that be?\n\n\nA: Dragging vertically is used to scroll the icon list if not all icons fit on your screen.\n\nA: I just found the answer. The reason is because if you have more applications than the launcher can fit, then you can drag the icons vertically to scroll through the launcher.\n\nA: The main reason that a simple drag does not reposition an icon is that the launcher needs to handle having more applications open and/or locked in the launcher than will fit on screen. So the default drag action is to scroll the launcher.  \nWhile it would be possible to have drag default to moving the icon when the launcher doesn't need to scroll, it would make the response to a drag dependent on what else you have open at the time, rather than having consistent behaviour all the time. \n\nA: Why it's designed that way is a matter of speculation, but we can probably think of good reasons for most of those behaviors:\n\n\n*\n\n*It would be important, when moving icons, to avoid moving them unintentionally.  The mouse pointer is often moving when the click is made, yet that click is probably most often just done to open the application.  To have the icon dragged at that moment would be very inconvenient.  A delay of some time - and a one-second delay does not seem unreasonable - to make sure that the click-and-hold is intended would prevent moving the icon when it is not intended.\n\n*The need to drag the icon to the right seems reasonable, too.  Perhaps it would make more sense to you if you thought of it as dragging the icon from the launcher, and then back to it.  It makes the user's intention quite clear, so that Unity is not likely to misinterpret the gesture.  It might work as well just to move the icon up or down, but this way works, too.\nSuggestions to change such behaviors might be welcome, I suppose, to those who develop Unity, but these actions actually appear to me to be pretty well-thought-out.  After having used Unity for about a year now, both of these actions seem very comfortable.  Most important, though, is that they work.  You can move the icons and rearrange the launcher, and the method is not excessively complex or involved.  (Why do we drive on the right in some countries and on the left in others?  There are historical reasons, yes, but I don't think, in the end, one way is better than another.  It's just what one is accustomed to doing.)\n", "Q: DHCP server doesn't assign network dns to other hosts on my network I had a problem with my DHCP but I managed to fix it.

I run Xfce with a traditional bottom panel. I have set title in my .vimrc and can say that the terminal title change is reflected on the 'taskbar', or rather the bottom panel, as the screenshot below shows:\n\nThe gnome-terminal tab is the fourth window on the panel showing Vim open with a script of mine called General_Backup.\nIt is difficult to say why the terminal's title is failing to be reflected on your 'taskbar' (panel), but I should check your ~/.bashrc and/or ~/.bash_aliases and see if there are any problems with your PS1 or PROMPT_COMMAND settings, and see if the prompt is being reset properly.\nAll I can say is that I use a special PROMPT_COMMAND in my .bashrc, which I have adapted somewhat from the commented out one in /etc/bash.bashrc:\ncase \"$TERM\" in\n    xterm*|rxvt*) PROMPT_COMMAND='printf \"%b\" \"\\033]0;${PWD/$HOME/~}\\007\"'\n                  export PROMPT_COMMAND;;\n               *) :;;\nesac\n\nI have found that using this PROMPT_COMMAND also allows you to have individual titles in your terminal tabs (denoting the current working directory), if you use, for example, gnome-terminal, or guake:\n \nUsing this PROMPT_COMMAND setting allows the vim window to revert to the present working directory when vim is exited; without it, Thanks for flying Vim remains all the time until the terminal is exited.\nThese tips should help you sort out the issue, but it may be a problem specific to your setup.

You don't have to use Unity on Ubuntu, so what will you gain?\nThe path I took is to use Gnome classic, with Compiz, but I don't use the Gnome taskbar or menu.  I do have one Gnome panel, with the menu removed.  I have the indicators, and time, and it's transparent.  I mainly use it because it implements the Alt-F2 run dialog that I like.\nFor the task manager, I use either AWN or GLX-Dock, and for the menu I use Cardapio menu.  Both AWN and GLX-Dock are very configurable, similar in style to Unity/Mac in that it shows icons or launchers with dots if they're running.  They can be transparent.\nI had problems with the 12.04 Gnome panel cosmetically, in that the indicators are not transparent for the theme I like (standard ambiance).\nGLX-Dock has a session you can choose without Gnome, but I don't use it.\n\nA: In classic Gnome you would have to make a fake transparecy like he appears to be doing by using a PNG with transparency and throwing the wallpaper behind and saving it as an image.\nBut it seems that he is using GNOME Shell in standard Ubuntu configuration.\nI'm facing a problem to theme the GNOME Shell as the standard configuration for Ubuntu 12.04 comes with no extensions, so the theme isn't being applied at all.\nFollow those instructions:\nhttp://www.noobslab.com/2012/04/install-gnome-shell-34-and-extensions.html\nI followed those instructions and it worked, even this theme you wished...\nYou'll have to logout, select the GNOME session and login.\nYou'll then type tweak (assuming you installed, if you don't you go on Ubuntu Software Center and install Gnome Tweak Tool) and then you'll be able to select your theme.\nIf you extract the contents of this theme correctly it will appear on the Gnome Tweak.\nGood luck,\n\nA: Compiz transparency is not bad at all, In CCSM Check opacity brightness and saturation, to window specific setting New, In windows type (name=gnome-panel) and give value to as per your need for transparency but 60 seems effective without affecting much of icons in systray![Here is the screenshot of gnome panel with compiz transparency in ubuntu 12.04][10]\nhttp://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Glx+dock?content=158834\n", "Q: How can I install Java from the command line only?

Why has Ubuntu stopped it?\n\nA: Ubuntu used to have a \"ShipIt\" service which shipped free CDs.\nThis has now closed.\nThey have put up a notice on the former ShipIt website here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/shipit\n\nAfter delivering millions of Ubuntu CDs to millions of new users, our ShipIt programme has finally run its course. While we can no longer deliver free CDs through the programme, it’s still easy to get Ubuntu. You can download Ubuntu for free from Ubuntu.com or you can buy a CD straight from the Canonical shop.\n\nYou can read their official blog post about their decision, made in April 2011, here:\nhttp://blog.canonical.com/2011/04/05/shipit-comes-to-an-end/\nHere's an excerpt:\n\nTechnology moves on and as we look at ways to spread Ubuntu further, a CD distribution programme, especially one of that size and delivered in that way, makes less sense. We have been slowly easing back the programme over the last two years to limit the number of CDs per person and the number of times a person could apply for a CD. But for Ubuntu 11.04 you will no longer be able to go to our website and apply for a free CD.\n\nThey go on to talk about a few ways that you may still be able to get a free Ubuntu CD.\nTL;DR: They spent huge amounts of money shipping free CDs and decided that no longer makes sense, citing not much more than \"technology moves on\".\n\nA: Looks like administration and cost were cited as the reason for stopping it (along with better internet connection speeds available now). You can still purchase one from the Ubuntu store, and can now try Ubuntu out online at http://ubuntu.com/tour\n", "Q: What are 'nightly' builds? When referring to the Ubuntu releases, I've come across something called 'nightly' builds. What do 'nightly' builds mean?\n\nA: As software is being developed, before it is \"released\", the software in its unreleased or \"unfinished\" state may still be quite usable at any given moment in time, as devs are making changes to it and either adding features or preparing it for a future release.\nA daily build usually means that some machine grabs the unreleased software every night at one particular moment in time, compiles it, and puts it up for developers to test.\nObviously, it may or may not be usable, depending on what stage of development it's at, what the release strategy for that project is, etc.  What you are testing is a snapshot of unfinished software at one moment in time.\nSometimes, the software may well be very nearly ready for release, in which case it'll often work quite well already.  If the developers have declared a \"freeze\" it means that they minimise changes, only fixing existing bugs.  During that stage, a nightly build of a piece of software is more likely to be quite usable since it's getting close to release time.\nIf you are talking about daily builds of the Live CD or a Installer CD, then these are builds made of the installation medium based based on snapshots of the current development process.  All the above applies.  These should usually work pretty well due to their release strategy, though it's not uncommon for some things to be broken.\nThere's no point installing any piece of software from a daily build unless you are testing features that are currently in development and not yet released, and you are willing to put up with it being a bit broken or unfinished.\n\nA: Nightly builds are in-testing versions of Ubuntu, or Ubuntu software. A new one is released every day. Nightly builds are usually much less stable than regular Ubuntu releases.\n", "Q: Why isn't Fluendo software showing up in 12.04 for purchase? I am currently running Ubuntu 12.04 (32 Bit) and I have noticed that none of the previous software available for purchase from Fluendo is available. Does anyone know why?\nWhile trying to find a answer I noticed a similar issue in the Ubuntu Forums. The response they received from Fluendo was that it was a question for Canonical and that they would pass it on to them. \nI have also emailed Fluendo at info@fluendo.com. They responded by saying that this issue is on Canonical's side in the Ubuntu Software Center and that they are working on resolving this as soon as possible.\nI've also posed this question in Launchpad at:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/software-center/+question/196090 .\n\n\nA: I believe this issue is now resolved.  When you launch the Ubuntu Software Center you will need to wait a few minutes as the package information is updated.  If you continue to experience problems please report them into the launchpad URL as I am subscribed there.\nThanks for your patience.\n\nA: This is likely due to Ubuntu's security for an LTS. They're more choosy of what gets put in the USC. You should be able to find a Fluendo PPA, though, whether it be official or someone building for Precise.\nIf it was stated that Ubuntu is working on it, though, it will likely end up in official repositories sooner rather than later.\n", "Q: Where else to go for help if not helped at Ask Ubuntu? What other official places can I go for getting help on Ubuntu if I do not get the help I wanted on Ask Ubuntu?\n\nA: You can go to Ubuntu forums.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/\n\nA: You might also check out the ubuntu IRC channels on freenode. http://www.ubuntu.com/support/community/chat\n\nA: I've used them all, and learned that you really need to be careful at some of them, even ubuntuforums.org; there is a lot of \"the blind leading the blind\" - people trying to be helpful who don't really know what they are doing, or why they did what they did, etc.  \nIt seems like Stack Exchange has a lot of smart people, including a lot of people who work for Ubuntu, plus the voting helps you find good answers, and rewards people who provide good answers.\nBut one other resource that nobody mentioned yet is Reddit.com.  They have a voting mechanism there that helps promote good answers, or helps you find good (or popular) answers and discussions.\n\nA: *\n\n*https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu.\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/\nWhile the first officially supports asking and answering in several languages, the second has some localized versions. You can read about the language issue here (from 2010): Are there any plans for localized Ask Ubuntu instances?. (Thanks to Elijah Kazan for suggesting the edit.)\n\nA: The other answers all have good resources, but I must admit my first port of call is my favourite search engine - there are lots of blog posts and wiki pages out there describing how people have overcome various problems they have found. Nothing except a search engine is going to be able to find them all.\nA basic tip is to put the text of an error message, surrounded by quotes, into the search box. That will return results that match the exact message you got. Has worked wonders for me on many occasions. Though note you should exclude anything specific to your system - time/date stamps, paths etc.\n\nA: \nSome places you can go when looking for help when using the RTFM method ...\nThe Official Ubuntu Documentation page where you can find the official documentation developed and maintained by the Ubuntu Documentation Project.\nThe Ubuntu Documentation Wiki, whose home page I can never seem to find with a search, is a community-driven and open area of the Ubuntu documentation website which anyone can edit.\nThe Ubuntu Wiki. (I'm never really sure what this site is about or where to look for things on it, but there it is all the same. It does have a somewhat pretty page containing Ubuntu Release Information)\nUbuntu Common Questions (aka FAQ) page\nThe Ubuntu Manpage Repository\nThe Ubuntu Index of all available pages (Supposedly a list/index of all community documentation pages.)\n\nA: I feel the question is missing something.  It's phrased in the manner of \"I didn't get help here... where else can I go to find people to help me?\"  But Ask Ubuntu isn't really about helping people one-on-one.  If that were the primary purpose, we wouldn't close questions because they are duplicates or bug reports.  The primary purpose of Ask Ubuntu is to create a useful resource for people to look up their question and find answers.\nSo the proper answer to \"I didn't get help here.  What do I do next?\" is:\n\"Do your research.  Search for similar, related questions.  Then if you still haven't gotten anywhere, edit and improve your question using the knowledge you have garnered.\"\nIdeally you're supposed to have done this first.  But often people do not.  The FAQ actually suggests doing this.  \nFirst, search Ask Ubuntu.  Experiment with different keywords.  Use more restricted searches first, e.g. more specific keywords and also putting phrases in quotes, and then lighten the constraints if you aren't finding what you need.\nNext, you can use Google to search for key terms.  Even if you didn't get an answer from searching Ask Ubuntu, you might have gotten some ideas of what to search for.  Google will find you hits from a variety of forums and is still generally considered the best search engine.  You might also consider using Google's site specific search.  Along with your keywords, just type in site:askubuntu.com, for example, to search only Ask Ubuntu.  Or site:ubuntuforums.org to search Ubuntu forums (forum search can be pretty bad, so this really helps).  \nFinally after all that, if you still haven't found your answer, you're hopefully much better informed, and you should yet again consider posting here or at least updating your question.  \n\nA: sudo apt-get install xchat\n\nThere are plenty of helpful people you can ask in #Ubuntu.

What's the best way to get rid of it Keeping the current system ?\nI want to use hardware raid instead. \nWhat I tried to do:\n-Copied the 1disk of software raid using HDClone. Configured degraded raid array without the second disk. Then copied everything from /dev/md0 onto a spare disk /dev/sdb using dd utility. However the copy wasn't accurate so I was not able to boot. I even tried to reinstall grub but it all didnt work. What's the best way to do this procedure? Thanks\n\nA: I would move the installation to another drive. With the same DD utility, and do a grub install on it so that it boots normally. After that setup your hardware raid, and do DD from the drive you setup back to the new hardware raid drive and do a grub install on that drive, and you should be set.\n\nA: On creating your software RAID you have chosen to combine multiple drives into one logical unit. In your case a RAID1 is just mirroring data. On using mdadm you did that by partitioning and configuring your drives accordingly. Exactly this is why disk-clone utilities obviously fail to move your data to another drive. \nOf course you can still copy (e.g. by using cp -a or any other copy utility) your data from the RAID to any other spare disk.\nIn case we need to resolve our software RAID we can do so by e.g.:\nsudo umount /dev/md0\nsudo mdadm --stop /dev/md0\nsudo mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1\n\nAdapt the setting shown here for RAID /md0 and drives /sda and /sdb to your settings.\nAfter that we need to change the partition type back from RAID to normal, install Grub, and update our fstab.\nSee also this question\n\nA: This might come a little late..\ndd is the best tool to clone raw disks ( or partitions ), and that's exactly what it does.\nit copies raw data regardless ( and unaware ) of what filesystem / structure is on the source ( data + metadata )> so ponder on this for a while, as this actually means it will reconstruct the target exactly the same as the source.\nOr shorter > dd'ing a raid member will create a raid member .... which in your case will create a second degraded array.... \nAnd that's definitely not what you intended to do...\nalso while it's true that a raid1 mirrors data, it doesn't mean the raw data of the raid members is identical ( some metadata will differ )\nproper procedure for reusing a former raid member is to blank it by using \n\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4k ( don't copy pasta this > change output device to your needs. )\n\nthis will properly zero any data / metadata > this is also a good idea on new disks...\nif the raid was used as a system disk > run a live cd ( don't copy from a running system )\nrepartition / format / mount the cleaned disk\nmount the degraded raid array\nand copy the raids contents with \n\nsudo rsync -HAXavx /media/raid1/ /media/newdisk/\n\nfollowing is only when raid was a system disk :\nalter the UUID's in fstab on the target volume ( find out what the new disk UUID is by running blkid )\ncopy the boot sector by running dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=446 count=1 ( and NOT bs=512 like most folks think > using 512 will overwrite your partition table !! )\nI'm now assuming the target disk is mounted as /media/newdisk\n\nsudo mount --bind /dev /media/newdisk/dev\nsudo mount --bind /sys /media/newdisk/sys\nsudo mount --bind /proc /media/newdisk/proc\nsudo chroot /media/newdisk/\n  ( and after you altered the UUID's in fstab )\ngrub-install /dev/sdb ( to make sure you've rewritten a  fresh bootloader )\nupdate-grub \nexit ( this returns to your non chrooted environment )\nsudo reboot \n\n:-)\n", "Q: Hide window title in gnome-shell using mutter, gdk, wnck or gtk I'm after a way to:\n\n\n*\n\n*get list of all application windows currently open, as a Gdk or Gtk window\n\n*remove window decorations for selected windows (maximised in my case).\n\n\nI'd like to do this using mutter, gdk, wnck or gtk (or GdkX11, ...) (i.e. anything with gobject introspection).\nI've seen the following question: Remove titlebar from maximized terminal window but am struggling with converting it to something that works.\n(The language I'm using is javascript, but this is somewhat irrelevant since it's all using gobject introspection).\nI'm currently using GNOME 3.2 (am open to GNOME 3.4 solutions though).\n\nAs to 1., I know I can get all windows with wnck and mutter fairly easily (e.g. Wnck.Screen.get_default().get_windows()), but how do I then convert these into G(t or d?)k windows in order to remove decorations?\nI can convert a mutter window to a Gdk one like so:\nxwin = GdkX11.X11Window.foreign_new_for_display( \n                          Gdk.Display.get_default(), \n                          mutterWindow.get_compositor_private()['x-window'] );\n\nHowever, this xwin object does not respond to commands such as xwin.unmaximize() and xwin.maximize(), so I feel that something went wrong in the conversion!\nThe reason I want to convert the window into Gdk or Gtk is so I can use Gdk's set_decorations or Gtk's set_hide_titlebar_when_maximized.\nI have had a look at Gdk.Screen.get_default().get_toplevel_windows() and Gtk.Window.list_toplevels() but these return lists of more windows than I have open, and I am unsure if my actual application windows are in the list and how to match them up.\n\nAs to 2., if I first get the active window from within Gdk (since I know it's a Gdk window and it responds properly to events such as unmaximize and maximize, unlike when I use foreign_new_for_display) and then try to remove decoration as per the previously linked question, the window (& process) dies! I'm not sure what the error is.\nconst Gdk = imports.gi.Gdk;\n\n// get current window. It's a terminal, not null.\n// For now assume it's maximized.\ncurwin = Gdk.Screen.get_default().get_active_window();\n// decorations don't seem to updated unless I unmaximize & re-maximize\ncurwin.unmaximize();\n// try remove decorations: window + process dies!\ncurwin.set_decorations(0);\ncurwin.maximize();\n\nIf I use curwin.set_decorations(Gdk.WMDecoration.BORDER) (note: GDK window documentation here), the window appears as I wish when the window is unmaximized (title bar gone), but when maximized, space for the title bar is still left, although the text itself is not shown.\n\nWould anyone be able to give me insight into how to achieve either of my goals? (Ultimately, automagic titlebar hiding of maximised windows, like maximus for Ubuntu's Unity netbook remix). I really do wish to use this using Gtk/Gdk/wnck/mutter/anything with gobject introspection, as opposed to an external app like compiz or modifying the metacity window theme's XML (which I know you can do to achieve this).\n\nA: After a bit of discussion with the gnome-shell devs, this was resolved.\nThe conversion I attempted to do in 1. was never an option - that sort of thing doesn't work.\nThe version in 2. was the correct code, but would only work if run from outside a gnome-shell extension (i.e. run the javascript file using the gjs binary as opposed to from the looking glass or an extension). It turned out that mucking around with window decorations like that from within the gnome-shell/mutter process would cause the crash.\nSo the problem could be solved so long as the code was run from outside the extension. Launching an external process to run the script in option 2) worked (although it turned out to be easier to just spawn xprop and set the _GTK_HIDE_TITLEBAR_WHEN_MAXIMIZED atom to true on the window (identified by its X ID, being the child of the window with the window actor's XID).\n(If anyone is interested the end result is the Maximus gnome shell extension)\n", "Q: How to get microphone to work on acer aspire one 722 I have an acer aspire 722, I recently went to use gmail/talk as well as empathy and realized that the microphone does not work.

If you want to move them or make a link you need to press the Alt tab. This behavior is very strange, nobody is used to it, and is prone to errors and duplication of files. How can the default be reverted to the normal thing?\n\nA: The default operation when dragging a file to somewhere on the same drive as the original location is to move it. If dragging between drives, then the default is a copy operation. You could drag the file using the middle mouse button instead of holding Alt to be given the option.\nThese settings are the same as previous Ubuntu releases as well as on Windows.\n", "Q: Why do options sometimes appear grey in the context menu even when they are available? I can't determine when, but often the context menu shows options in gray when they shouldn't because they are activated and you can used them. I have seen this with resize, with paste (after copying files) and with  \"create new folder\" in a mounted partition. The partition wasn't protected by permissions and a few seconds later or in another window I could do the operation.\nCan that be fixed? I find it annoying and confusing.\n\nA: This is a bug in 12.04 that's been around for  quite awhile & probably will be for some time.

When I want to delete files I can't choose in the context menu between deleting them completely or sending them to trash(!). With the key shorcuts I can delete them completely but I if select a set of files/folders I am asked whether to \"delete all\" of them or to simply \"delete\". What is the difference? Whatever I choose it deletes all the selected. So what is the reason for the question if nobody listens. Is it possible to eliminate the useless question?.\n\nA: When we right click on a folder with no content it only shows delete (cause its one file). But when we right click on a folder with many contents such as folders and documents it will show 'Delete All' to remind you that if you delete the file all the contents inside will be deleted.\nIt makes it obvious that when we select many folders (many is more than one) so it shows 'Delete All'.\nBut in the end of the day if you press 'Delete All' OR 'Delete' they will end up in the Trash, so no sweat ;)\nHope it helped.\n", "Q: 12.04 - memory not fully recognized This might look like an easy one \"get yourself different memory chips\", but I'm not convinced:\nI set up 12.04 64bit on a new board with 8 GB of memory plugged in.

It looks almost as if the image is not being smoothed or anti-aliased.\n\nOn the left is gthumb/eog (look the same) - on the right is gimp. Left one is clearly broken. It never used to be like that. Those are at 20% zoom.\nEye of Gnome (EoG) and GThumb both suffer from it when resizing to reduce, and when zooming out to reduce, but oddly Gthumb doesn't suffer when generating thumbnails. Shotwell and Gimp are unaffected. Libre Office is affected.\nGiven this, I wonder if anyone might know which component(s?)/issues are the cause? I'm on a 64-bit precise with NVidia 8800 GTX (nouveau).\nEDIT: Additional information. If i use the tools dropdown button in the top toolbar of Gthumb, it reduces images size and retains full quality. If I instead click the paint palette at the top right to enter Edit Mode, and resize from in there, it loses quality. The \"high quality\" check box makes a difference but not significantly. The zoom also loses quality. I am wondering if perhaps it doesn't have 2 rendering modes and 1 is broken?\nEDIT 05May2012: I have since discovered that\n(a) The image quality for EoG and Gthumb suffered its regression in Oneiric (Maverick, Natty work fine).\n(b) It is not limited to Ubuntu, it also affected Fedora 16.\nSo I'll take as an accepted answer anyone who can either fix that or advise me how to go bug reporting this. I don't really know which packages to apply it to, or whether it needs to go to Ubuntu or GNOME. Thanks!\n\nA: I faced the same problem and I looked for an alternative. I installed an app called Mirage from the repos and set it as the default image viewer.\nMirage offers two big advantadges over the default image viewer: \n\n\n*\n\n*Image scaling is properly done.\n\n*It preloads the next image so viewing a set of images is much more pleasant without having to way on sec. every time you click \"next image\".\n\n\nIMHO the way the default image viewer scales the images is a bug (and should be corrected in following updates).\nThe second is a feature (a trick if you want) that should be implemented in the default image viewer because it's one of those things that make people say \"this is way faster in Windows\".\n\nA: Open gThumb and go to Edit > Preferences and make sure that Smooth images is checked.\n\n\nA: This is bug 665897 in Gnome.\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665897\n\nA: Ok, I had the same problem... Spent a long time trying to fix it. With gthumb doesn't seem to be a problem with system settings or a bug etc but rather that the Ubuntu official repositories do not carry an up to date version of gthumb. The latest versions have much better anti-aliasing. I tried lots of methods of getting a newer version of gthumb including downloading .deb files, building from source, using the PPAs on the gthumb website but none of them worked for me. For any novices like me here's what did.\nFirst uninstall the old gthumb - from the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) run\nsudo apt-get remove gthumb\n\nThen I added the following repositories to the top of my /etc/apt/sources.list. They have to be on top because when you 'apt-get install gthumb' it will download from the first repository listed which contains a package called gthumb. If you put it beneath the official Ubuntu repositories you will just get old gthumb again.\nSo you have to run a text editor as root from the terminal to edit the file for example\ngksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nor because I'm running Xubuntu I did\ngksudo mousepad /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nThen add the following two lines to the top, save and close:\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/dhor/myway/ubuntu saucy main \ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/dhor/myway/ubuntu saucy main \n\nThen run\ngpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E2B7D64D93330B78 && gpg --export --armor | sudo apt-key add - && sudo apt-get update\n\nin the terminal to get the key for the PPA.\nThen you can run\nsudo apt-get install gthumb\n\nand it should install gthumb 3.2.4 with great anti-aliasing \n\nA: Try Edit > Preferences > Viewer > Zoom Quality > High. That does the trick for me, but of course, it then takes several seconds to load most of my pictures, so it's a rather imperfect solution.\nThis option was apparently not available in earlier versions, although I'm not sure when it was added. I have gThumb 3.2.7.\n", "Q: Can you tell which are the canon laser printers that suport in ubuntu 12.04?

My end goal is to reformat my hard drive and install ubuntu.\n\nA: I am new so cannot comment, hence leaving this as an answer.\nYou appear to have done the correct things so I would have to ask: did you burn the ISO as a complete image, or did you just copy the files to the CD?

I don't like to use the pre-made folders. I want  to organize the things the way I want and with the names I want. Moreover I don't want to have to move a picture every time I want to try and see how it looks as a background wallpaper. So, how can I quickly select an image in any folder as a desktop background.\n\nA: Excellent answers given, and also another simpler way that doesn't need the installation of any extra program or opening heavy programs, is the use of nautilus-scripts.\nSpecifically, open Gedit, and paste these:\n#!/bin/bash\npath=$NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS\npath=${path%?}\nquoted=\"file://$path\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"$quoted\"\n\nNext, save the file as 'Set as Background' under ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts.\nTo access the directory ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts you will need to go to your home directory through the save dialog of Gedit and press Ctrl+H so as to show the 'hidden' directories (the ones starting with a dot \".\") and select the .gnome2 folder and next the nautilus-scripts folder.\nNext, you have to make the saved file executable. You will need to open your home folder, press Ctrl+H so as to show the 'hidden' folders, navigate to .gnome2 and next to nautilus-scripts, right click on the saved file 'Set as Background', click on Properties, click on 'Allow executing file as program' and close the dialog.\n\nNow, right-clicking on every file will result on this:\n\n\nA: There are many ways to do so:\na) In Appearence Settings choose an image via the \"+\" button:\n\nb) Open an image you like by doubleclick, rightclick and choose \"Set as Desktop Background\":\n\nc) Shotwell (photo manager) features this, too: Select an image and choose File → Set as Desktop Background or just press Ctrl+B:\n\nd) With the extension nautilus-wallpaper you was able to set an image as background out of the file manager. But this doesn't work since Ubuntu 11.10.\nAs a workaround you can install nautilus-actions. Start it and add a new entry via File → New action or by pressing Ctrl+N. Name it \"Set as Wallpaper\":\n\nIn the \"Command\" tab do following settings:\nLabel: Set as Wallpaper\nPath: gsettings\nParameters: set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri %u\n\nIn the Mimetypes tab edit the entry and change \"*/*\" to \"image/*\" (press ↵ to apply before switching the tab):\n\nIn the Environment tab (press the arrow at the top right side to reach it) under Appears if selection contains change Count: > (strictly greater than) to = (equal to) and change the value to \"1\":\n\nSafe your edits by File → Save or Ctrl+S. Then open Preferences by Edit → Preferences. Uncheck \"Create a root 'Nautilus-Actions' menu\":\n\nClose Nautilus Actions and restart Nautilus (file manager) by pressing Alt+F2 and running killall nautilus or logging out and in again.\nFrom now on you can set your preferred images as desktop background directly out of the file manager via rightclick:\n\n\nA: Click the + sign at the bottom left of the 4x4 wallpaper icon grid.\nYou can also place links in the main pictures folder, that take you elsewhere (drag a folder with middle button, instead of left, to create a link)\n\nA: You can also open picture in Image Viewer and then on the top of the screen select Image>Set As Desktop Background.\n\nA: My settings looks different than the screen shots in here, and I don't want to both making scripts for this.

Know where you saved the amd-driver-installer-XX-XX-x86.x86_64.run file.\n\n*Run the command cd /path/to/amd/driver , replacing /path/to/amd/driver with the location you saved the driver installer to.\n\n*Run the command sh amd-driver-installer-*-x86.x86_64.run .\n\n*Enter your password when the prompt for it pops up.\n\n*Follow the default installation configuration. If the installer refuses to install, it's probably because you have FGLRX already installed.

I was wondering whether I could make my own commands as in if I were to type in 'music' at the command line, my vlc should open up and start playing my playlist. The vlc thing is just an example but the question remains.\nCan I make my own commands? If yes, how?\n\nA: The best way to do this is to modify (or create) a file called .bash_aliases in your home folder.\nThe Syntax is fairly simple:\nalias install='sudo apt-get -y install'\n\nWith this command, if you type install in a terminal, it will instead be interpreted as\nsudo apt-get -y install\nHowever, these commands will not work anywhere outside of a terminal.\n\nA: Yes - create a file named music and put the following inside it:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Hello world\"\n\nNext, type chmod +x music - this makes the file executable. You can now type ./music to run this script.\nIt's a good idea to type echo $PATH and copy the script into one of those directories. I would suggest creating $HOME/bin and adding that to your PATH via ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile. This can be done by adding (to one of those files): export PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\". You will then need to run source .bash_profile (assuming you put that in that file) to reload it.\nAnother alternative would be to add the command you want to run as a bash alias. You can do this by adding the following to a file named .bash_aliases in your home directory:\nalias music='vlc --some-option --foo'\n\nRun source ~/.bash_aliases or logout and login and it should work :-)\n\nA: Any executable file in a directory in your path can be a \"command\".  It can be a script as suggested in other answers, but it could also be a compiled program in any supported language you know.\nAliases will also work, but are limited because they are \"one-liners\" so that doing anything intricate with them quickly generates code that is very difficult to read.  Also, since they execute in the same variable scope as the shell you type them into, they can easily have unintended side effects like leaving you in another directory or leaving variables defined that are only needed by the task the alias performs.  (Of course, sometimes you might want to use an alias precisely because it does have desirable side effects.)\nIf you put your new commands in a directory in your path, they can be found by the shell and executed.  The most common place to put them is in $HOME/bin.  If this directory exists, it will often be automatically added to your path.\nTwo things to keep in mind when setting this up are:\n1) It's usually best to use unique names for your commands that do not match any that are already defined on your system.  There's a lot of debate on this, but the main point is that familiar commands should not have unexpected results if someone else is using your system and that getting used to a common command doing something special can get you in trouble when you work on another system where it isn't defined that way.\n2) You can add $HOME/bin to the beginning or end of your path (or anywhere in between, but that's not usually done).\nAdding it to the front of your path is the most convenient choice because your version of a command will always be the one that executes and it will be found faster.  It is also a security vulnerability because anyone who can get write permission to your $HOME/bin (a lot easier than getting root access) can replace common commands with potentially malicious code very easily.  Also, if you ever need to ask for help from someone who doesn't know your system, then they are likely to be tripped up by the special behavior of your custom commands unless you spend a lot of extra effort explaining everything on top of just asking your question.\nAdding it to the end of your path statement is a little safer because any command with the same name as your command that's already in your path will be found first and run instead - and anything else that relies on that command working as expected will still work.\nTo avoid all of this (at the expense of a little extra typing), you can also put your command in a directory that's not in your path so it will almost never be run unintentionally because you'll have to type it's full path name to run it.\nLike most things in Linux, there are many ways to create and use new commands and they each have their own advantages and limitations.\n", "Q: dnsmasq sometimes resolves things, sometimes it doesn't Trying to resolve:\n\nnslookup testserverinlocaldns\nServer:       127.0.0.1\nAddress:  127.0.0.1#53\n** server can't find testserverinlocaldns: NXDOMAIN\n\nAfter 10 seconds everything is ok:\n\nnslookup testserverinlocaldns\nServer:       127.0.0.1\nAddress:  127.0.0.1#53\nName: testserverinlocaldns.localnet\nAddress: 192.168.3.8\n\nAnd the same thing again and again.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 on a Lenovo X220 notebook with onboard Intel graphics.\nI purchased a so called external PCIe GPU (GeForce GTX 560 Ti) which is connected via the card slot of my laptop.\nNow I want to switch to the Nvidia driver on boot when the eGPU is connected. If it is not, I want to switch back to the intel driver.\nI've written a little script doing the job: It places the nvidia xorg.conf on startup (on egpu) or removes it (on intel).\nThe problem is that the nvidia driver changes some libraries (and maybe more) so I can't use the intel driver. The following error message occurs in xorg.log:\n(EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not found)\n\nMy question is: Does anybody know how to switch back to the intel driver without completely removing the nvidia driver? Do I have to change some symlinks or something like this?\n\nA: Ubuntu provides the Alternatives system which you can use to configure Nvidia or Intel (Mesa libGL) in this case.\nSee my answer to No 3D support on Lenovo W520 with nVidia Optimus.

I just logged out and back in on both DEs.  I have KDE, XFCE, Gnome fallback, and Unity installed for testing purposes.  Aside from occasional cluttered menus and file associations, it works fine for me.\n\nA: There is no one true answer to this question, since it depends on the environments you want to install on one system. I currently have unity, gnome-shell, gnome-session-fallback and awesome installed and they get along fairly well, which makes sense since the first three are pretty much the same (configuration and application-wise) and awesome does not share any settings with the former or bring in any other applications.\nYou just have to know that there might be some caveats to running multiple DE's. For example installing gnome-shell will overwrite unity keyboard shortcuts.\nYou won't run into major (think unusable system) Problems, but installing xfce will pull more than just the DE, like the suite of standard xubuntu applications.

Most of the time just adding a package repository allows you to download and install packages without a repository key. Also some repositories display their key beside their information so they're easy to find. But  \n\n\n*\n\n*Why do we need to add keys if we can install packages without them?\n\n*How do they work under Ubuntu?\n\n\nA: I found a nice explanation from Ubuntu Community Help Wiki. \n\n\n*\n\n*What are Repositories?\n\n\"Authentication keys\" are usually obtained from the maintainer of the\n  software repository. The maintainer will often place a copy of the\n  authentication key on a public key server such as www.keyserver.net.\n  The key can then be retrieved using the command.\n\nApt Authentication\n\nApt-get package management uses public key cryptography to\n  authenticate downloaded packages.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Debian does an excellent job of explaining Secure apt on this wiki\n  page.\n  \n  \n  What follows is a short summary of the key acquisition and\n  verification process gleaned from Debian's wiki page.\nBasic Concepts Public key cryptography is based on pairs of keys, a\n  public key and a private key. The public key is given out to the\n  world; the private key must be kept a secret. Anyone possessing the\n  public key can encrypt a message so that it can only be read by\n  someone possessing the private key. It's also possible to use a\n  private key to sign a file, not encrypt it. If a private key is used\n  to sign a file, then anyone who has the public key can check that the\n  file was signed by that key. No one who doesn't have the private key\n  can forge such a signature.\ngpg (GNU Privacy Guard) is the tool used in secure apt to sign files\n  and check their signatures.\napt-key is a program that is used to manage a keyring of gpg keys for\n  secure apt. The keyring is kept in the file /etc/apt/trusted.gpg\n  (not to be confused with the related but not very interesting\n  /etc/apt/trustdb.gpg). apt-key can be used to show the keys in the\n  keyring, and to add or remove a key. \nEach time you add another apt repository to /etc/apt/sources.list,\n  you'll also have to give apt its key if you want apt to trust it. Once\n  you have obtained the key, you can validate it by checking the key's\n  fingerprint and then signing this public key with your private key.\n  You can then add the key to apt's keyring with apt-key add <key>\n\n\nA: You need repository keys so you can validate you got the package from the person you think you're getting it from.  \nIt's to keep people from injecting bad packages into your updates.  \nYou should add repository keys whenever you can.\n", "Q: Nautilus: open Extra Pane showing specific location?

Is it possible to add an option \"Open in New Pane\" which would open the selected folder in a new pane as it appears when I press F3?\n\nWhat would be the parameters for Nautilus Actions or can I realize this with Nautilus Scripts?\n\nA: First lets remember that Nautilus has the numbers of pane limited to 2.   \nYou can create a script to do that.  \n1) First install xdotool and parcellite: sudo apt-get install xdotool parcellite \n2) Then open a file (gedit /home/desgua/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/Open\\ In\\ A\\ New\\ Pane) and paste this:  \n#!/bin/bash\necho -n $1 | parcellite\nxdotool key F3 \nsleep 0.1\nxdotool key Tab\nsleep 0.3\nxdotool key ctrl+l ctrl+v \nsleep 0.1\nxdotool key Return\n\nexit 0\n\n3) Save.  \n4) Make it executable (chmod +x /home/desgua/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/Open\\ In\\ A\\ New\\ Pane)  \n5) Right click over a folder and select \"Scripts\" > \"Open In A New Pane\".  \n\nResult:  \n\n\n\nIf you are feeling lazy, just paste this into terminal and you're done:  \ncd ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts && wget http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4098082/Open%20In%20A%20New%20Pane && chmod +x ./Open*\n\n\nThis script open the folder in an existing pane:  \n1) First install xdotool and parcellite: sudo apt-get install xdotool parcellite \n2) Then open a file (gedit /home/desgua/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/Open\\ In\\ An\\ Existing\\ Pane) and paste this:  \n#!/bin/bash\necho -n $1 | parcellite\nsleep 0.1\nxdotool key Tab\nsleep 0.2\nxdotool key ctrl+l ctrl+v \nsleep 0.1\nxdotool key Return\n\nexit 0\n\n3) Save.  \n4) Make it executable (chmod +x /home/desgua/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/Open\\ In\\ An\\ Existing\\ Pane)  \n5) Right click over a folder and select \"Scripts\" > \"Open In An Existing Pane\".  \n\nA: I'm sure there are many ways to do this... but here goes...!\nInstall nautilus-actions and xdotool\nCreate a new script in your home folder called newpane and paste:\nsleep 0.3\nxdotool key ctrl+c \nsleep 0.3\nxdotool key F3 \nsleep 0.3\nxdotool key Tab\nsleep 0.3\nxdotool key Right\nsleep 0.3\nxdotool key Return\nsleep 0.3\nxdotool key Down\nsleep 0.3\nxdotool key ctrl+l\nsleep 0.3\nxdotool key ctrl+v\nsleep 0.3\nxdotool key Return\n\nGive the file execute rights:\nchmod +x ~/newpane\n\nRun nautilus-actions-config-tool\nChoose edit - preferences and uncheck the options shown:\n\nCreate a new menu option:\n\nexecute your new script - n.b. give it the full path to your script and save it, before closing the application.\n\nRestart nautilus:\nnautilus -q\n\nYou'll now have a new option:\n\n", "Q: 12.04 gnome classic ambiance font problem I've tried standard ambiance and have tried ambiance oneiric but the color of the windows on the panel has not changed.The color is still white. And the problem with the color of the font gnome menu.Сolor is darker. \nHow do I fix this?\n\n\nA: The bug is reported https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/light-themes/+bug/981289 and a fix is available in a branch on Launchpad, but it hasn't been merged yet, so it's not available in the official Ubuntu 12.04 repositories.\nA solution is to use the fixed \"light-themes\" (Ambiance and Radiance) package available in the WebUpd8 themes PPA. Add the PPA and upgrade to get the package using the commands below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/themes\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nReference\n\nA: The modified ambiance theme is not intended to, nor can,  fix the bug in the Classic session that you are highlighting.\n\nA: There is a temporary workaround for this problem:\nUse GNOME Classic (no effects) session, instead of the regular Gnome Classic session , because this bug occurs when using Compiz.\nOr you can simply change the theme manually as others suggested. \n", "Q: Can I Force Kubuntu Installer To Use Nvidia Driver, Not Nouveau? Is there an alternate install routine for Kubuntu 12.04 that would force the installer to use the Nvidia driver rather than Nouveau?\nI ask because I've installed KDE-Full on Ubuntu 12.04 and like it.  I may decide to install Kubuntu.\nHowever, the kernel currently on the Ubuntu install images will cause a crash almost immediately after installation begins -- before Grub runs -- that appears to be triggered when X attempts to launch Nouveau.  Here, the machine locks up and requires a power toggle.\nTo install Ubuntu 12.04, I had to install 11.10, ensure the Nvidia driver was installed and Nouveau blacklisted, and then dist-upgrade to 12.04.\nI don't want to do that if I decide to install Kubuntu. Hence, I'm looking for a way to get the installer to use the Nvidia driver. Or, an install method that avoids the entire issue until the Nvidia driver can be installed.\n\nA: You can't make it use the nvidia proprietary driver, but you can force it not to use nouveau by selecting the \"nomodeset\" option during boot.\nThe Live CD allows you to press a key at boot-up then press F6 (if I recall correctly) to set boot options, and \"nomodeset\" should be one of them.\nThat should cause the Live CD to use a fallback VESA graphics mode.  It will look dodgy, but it should work, and once you have installed Ubuntu you can then install the nVidia driver.\n\nA: I have met the same problem. Things I have done:\n1) Booted with nomodeset option(pressed F6 and selected it).\n2) Pressed Ctrl-Alt-F1\n3) sudo -i\n4) sudo apt-get --purge remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n5) sudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n6) Reboot.\n7) Now you should not select any options anymore. You may just boot(press enter and go ahead!).\nI have met the same problem with linux mint 13 and with ubuntu 12.04. 1) I was not able to solve it in mint but 2) I have installed ubuntu 12.04 very fast, just followed steps 2-7 described above. Note: after installing the system to your hard drive you will have to follow these steps once more on your fresh system.\nConclusion:\nSo you can force Kubuntu 12.04 / Ubuntu 12.04 installer to use the official NVidia driver.\nUPD: I hope you understand that I boot from a usb-stick.\nUPD: After installing Kubuntu 12.04 I had to press E in grub and add nomodeset boot option near (quiet and splash), then press F10 to boot.\nUPD: I have got it working with Linux Mint 13! You should follow the steps, install nvidia-current and then run nvidia-xconfig. That's it. Suggested by AlbertP and Ben on #linuxmint-help irc channel.\n\nANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION: you can edit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and add blacklist nouveau , but i thought the hadware drivers tools took care of this\n", "Q: Wifi Connectivity problems when using WPA/WPA2 Encryption This just seems like a common problem, however I was not able to find a solution on the net. For some reason Ubuntu doesn't like WPA/WPA2 personal encryption. I can connect to the network fine (others have reported they are not able to connect and the 'Authentication Required Window' keeps on appearing), however I am unable to connect to the internet. \nWhen I change the security settings of the router to 'Open' or to 'WEP' I can connect fine. However 'WEP' slows down the connection by a factor of 2.\nSeveral people have suggested to use 'wicd' instead of 'network-manager' I tried that but I got the same problems.\nPlease note that I have had this problem with Ubuntu 11.10 and now it seems it has carried over to 12.04.\nAlso note that I dont think it is a problem with the wireless router (Medialink) because my Windows 7 machine, iPad and Android phone all connect fine. \nAny ideas? Thanks in advance\n\nA: I don't think this is an Ubuntu problem per se -- it is likely caused by the interaction between your wireless chipset, software driver, and the software and hardware of the wireless access point or router.\nI've seen this with various devices from completely different vendors, running different OS's, and issues with connecting with wireless routers/AP's from different enterprise vendors (Cisco, Meru, Aruba, etc.).  In other words, it is likely not restricted to Ubuntu. \nThe driver situation in Linux is getting better and better, but you may want to track down specifics for your chipset and make sure you have the most recent drivers.  Also, do some searches to see if there are known issues with the brand/model of your wireless router or AP and your hardware.\nOften, the most recent driver can be found on the laptop or adapter vendor's website. \nWhat is your computer model, wireless device model, and router model (i.e., what model of \"Medialink\")?  lspci and/or lshw should help you find your wireless model and perhaps chipset. \nHere's some generic info:\nIf you haven't already, run jockey-gtk to check your driver update status.  You can also use the Super key (sometimes known as the Windows key) to open the dash, then type in \"driver\".  \"Additional drivers\" should appear as an application. \nIf nothing appears there, please check out the \"Help\" option there.  \nIt will open an info page on proprietary drivers.  At the bottom of that page, there's a link for more information, with a link to \"Hardware & Drivers\".  Click through to that, scroll to \"Common Problems\", and finally, check the link which is titled, \"Wireless network troubleshooter\".   If you're lucky, you'll find something helpful there as well.\nAlso see Supported Wireless cards  and Ubuntu Wireless Networking Documentation.\n\nA: run iwconfig to check the ESSID is correct, then run ifconfig to check if you have\na valid IP, then you could try some ping tests to the router then to google.\nnm-tool might provide some details also.\nChecking /var/log/syslog for errors would be a good idea also\n\nA: I managed to overcome this by trying to connect with security disabled and then re-activating WPA2 and re-entering the (same) key.  This may, of course, have been coincidence and I inadvertently altered something else!

I have been using Ubuntu since version 9 and found it very friendly and wonderful to work with. Is there a way to choose Gnome-classic or other desktops on install?\n\nA: Unity allows you to quickly access applications and files and to me, looks very good. Lack of productiveness is not a problem with the keyboard shortcuts it responds to. To display a list of shortcuts press and hold the Super key. The newly implemented HUD is also a goodie! Nevertheless, you can explore many other desktop environments. I also like Gnome Shell. It has a very clean look and is lightweight. Other options are Cinnamon, Enlightenment, etc. It's just a matter of what you feel most comfortable with! \n\nA: It supposed to be a lighter Display Manager than Gnome, and the design is supposed to be better in every scenario. Gnome tends to crowd in a netbook screen, in some cases. Unity is supposed to leave more visible real estate on the screen to work with. Especially if you enable the AUTO-HIDE for the panel as I do.\nI also like LXDE (LUBUNTU) too.

During the installation of the NVIDIA driver, this time i installed 295.49, 1 of the things they tell you to do is disable the NOUVEAU driver by creating a file /etc/modprobe.d/NVIDIA ....conf (can't remember the name), it's on my other PC. \nBeing a real NOOB, i thot this was something important. So when the installation was over, i moved it away & rebooted. lo & behold, 640x480 resolution! I moved the file back to /etc/modprobe.d, rebooted, & voila!!! it worked! \nSo i did some research on what exactly does Nouveau do. Here's watt i found out;\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia\nYou have NVIDIA (proprietary - ubuntu-land ppl call it \"closed source\") or Nouveau - open source driver. In the words of the article;\n\"This driver lacks support for 3D acceleration and may not work with the very latest video cards or technologies from NVIDIA.\"\nHere's an older article describing what the Nouveau project\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/03/nouveau-open-source-3d-graphics-drivers-for-nvidia-in-ubuntu/\nI don't know if this is out of context, but this is what it says;\n\"Whilst they don’t (yet) provide anywhere near the same level of performance as the proprietary drivers most folks use they are a free and capable drop-in.\"\nIn summary, use either proprietary or Nouveau, not both!\n", "Q: download upgrade interrupted downloading most recent upgrade was interrupted when my computer froze.

Setting reserved root space (-m) to 0 didn't have any effect.\nI'm using LVM but I don't think that LVM should have any effect on this. Ubuntu version is 12.04 LTS.\n\n# df -h\nFilesystem             Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n...\n/dev/mapper/abak-home  1.8T   27G  1.8T   2% /home\n\nThen I tried formating partition with ext3 and the result is much better:\n\n# df -h\nFilesystem             Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n...\n/dev/mapper/abak-home  1.8T  196M  1.8T   1% /home\n\nAnyway, why the difference and how can I fix this?\n\nA: There's nothing to fix, and this is perfectly normal.\next4 creates a lot of overhead before any files are created. It does not mean it is \"worse\" than ext3. If you fill that partition with files, you will notice that ext3's (and NTFS's) overhead will grow proportionally with the files, as with ext4 it will basically remain constant forever.\nBy \"pre-allocating\" the overhead, it can manage it much better than a growing one. So ext4 is just doing now what ext3 would do later.\nBesides, 27G may look a lot, but it's still a mere 1.5% overhead. Compare that to the old days of FAT, where slack space could eat anything from 5% to 30% of your partition space, and you'll notice how greatly things have evolved since then.\nAlso, I strongly recommend against using -m 0. Reserved space is there for a reason: it lowers the fragmentation chances and saves some space for fsck. It is reserved only from users, but root (and thus all your software installs) can fully use it. If you think 5% is excessive, leave at least 1% .\nRemember: there's no fragmentation nightmares in ext. But this beauty comes at a price. It needs free space as room for proper management. Give it to him and things will run much smoother. Besides, who ever uses their HDD beyond 90% before buying a larger one? So what's the problem about a 5% reserved space? It may save you the next time you accidentally create a dozen-GB file that fills up the whole partition and end up crashing the OS due to lack of space for other processes.\nFor a more detailed, further technical reading, read here\n\nA: I suspect this is down to overhead : file systems need somewhere to keep the information about files. It may be that ext4, being a newer file system, has defaults that reserve more space for file metadata than ext3, which was developed in a time when storage devices were smaller and liable to hold fewer files.\nYou're right that LVM has no effect on this ; it's just another way of providing block devices.\nI don't think you necessarily need to \"fix\" this - and I would expect you to do better with ext4 using it's default options, than ext3, on such a large drive. If you want to tweak the options when you create the filesystem, you can always review the manual for mkfs.ext4. Such choices are probably best made in the light of the expected load for the volume.\n\nA: Use df -H instead. The difference you see is because of the difference in real GBs/TBs (factor of 1024) and sales men's GBs/TBs (factor of 1000).\n", "Q: Dropbox service not starting automatically after kernel upgrade I upgraded a kernel on my 64bit 12.04 server and now the Dropbox service is not launching after the reboot.

Is it related to graphics stuff that I don't need on a server?

Gnome/Unity? Being a server, you don't need those, so maybe for a text-only boot could could try blacklisting the i915.ko module from loading in the krnel\n", "Q: What is the need for /boot and /tmp partitions in ubuntu What is the reason of /boot and /tmp partitions in Ubuntu ?\n\nA: There isn't any technical problem with not assigning a separate /boot partition. The following link may help you to understand why making an external boot partition is preferable. But as they say, it is only preferred, not NECESSARY to allocate a separate boot partition. I myself have used only the / (root) and swap area to partition my drive and I've installed Ubuntu without any issues.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CreateBootPartitionAfterInstall\n\nA: Please take a terminal and type in \"man hier\". :)\n\nA: I think perhaps there is a misunderstanding as to what partitioning does. \nIf you let the Ubuntu installer do the partitioning there will only be two partitions\n~19 GB for '/'\n~ 1 GB for swap\n\nSo what happened to /boot, /home, and /tmp?? Doesn't Ubuntu need those to function correctly?\nYes, it does. But it does not need them as partitions. It needs folders (aka \"directories\") with those names. And in the standard Ubuntu install, the filesystem in the partition for '/' will have directories with those names. So everything will function correctly.\nIf there is nothing on the hard disk when you install Ubuntu, then a few windows into the install you will get a window like the image below asking what type of an install you want to do. \nMy advice is that unless you have a some specific reason to split your installation into separate partitions, do not do it. Just use the entry which is selected in the example. Having one root ('/') partition which contains all of your data is usually the most efficient way to use the space on a hard drive.\n\n\nA: Mounting /boot on another partition is useful if your root partition uses a file system that grub2 (the bootloader) cannot understand ; you can place enough components in /boot to mount the root file system. This is not the case in a typical Ubuntu installation, as grub2 understands the default recommended file system (ext4), and all the other choices available. Another situation where a separate /boot is useful is where you have particularly stringent security needs - you can avoid mounting the /boot partition unless you need to update the components within, which means that rootkits will find it harder to compromise the bootloader. Again, this is not a typical need and is a rare choice.\n/tmp on a separate partition is useful if you have applications that need to heavily use temporary files and you would like to use a block device that is very fast. Alternately, if you are booting from an SSD, and would like to reduce the amount of wear on your SSD, you can mount /tmp on another drive, or in RAM. Again, this is an uncommon configuration.\n\nA: Yeah, use the entire disk if you don't understand the whole partitioning thing.  Besides, it is silly to separate the disk by limited sizes; when it get fulls then you have to increase size.... \nJust go with the full disk unless you have a special technical need for making separate partitions....\n\nA: The only problem I see is \n/tmp  5 Gb\n/boot 5 Gb\n\nWhy? Both are not needed. /tmp is a temporary directory so it is not likely to hold alot of files. And those files tend to get deleted fairly quickly aswell. So I would discard that one. Same goes for boot. When you have more than 1 OS and want to save space you can share /boot with all those OSes but there is not really a need for it. It can be handy but in this case I would go without and focus on the low disc space. \nMy root at this moment is 5.9 Gb large so I would increase / a bit so you do not run into a disc full notice.  \n/ = 10 GB \nswap = 2 GB  \n/home = 8 GB (my files music, videos etc are saved in my pen drive or cd)\n\nsounds better to me.\nIf you use your pen drive for storage I would even suggest you should focus on the low disc space and even forget about a /home partition: \nswap 2 Gb\nremainder as /\n\n\nA: Well, there are many guides out there for the partitioning in ubuntu, I would prefer to partiton it in this way:\nFirst, Just follow this link and let me know if you are getting stuck to any point out there. Now I also want to know wether or not you are doing the partition in a preinstalled windows hard disk or a fresj installation over entire disk?\nEDIT: Well, I would first recommend you to use gparted to create and manage partition. Just create four 5 gb primary partitions and format it with ext4 file system in it. Then just create a extended file system on one of the four primary partition because they won't allow you to create more than 4 primary partitions on the disk. Now on the extended one, create a 3 gb and a 2 gb logical paritions. Now you just got the partitions in the following way:\npartition 1    size: 5 Gb   type: Primary\nPartition 2    size: 5 Gb   type: Primary\nPartition 3    size: 5 Gb   type: Primary\nPartition 4    size: 5 Gb   type: Extended\n**Partition 4** -->  \n     Partition 5     SIZE: 3 GB    Logical\n     Partition 6     SIZE: 2 Gb    Logical\n\nNow just format and assign each of the partition as their respective choice and use it in either way you want. Linux gives you the better way to do it threw Gparted.\n", "Q: Why is DASH DISPLAYED permanently using screen space in the new V12 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I configure Unity's launcher auto-hide behavior? \n\nI have an Acer Aspire ONE Netbook and now having just upgraded to 12.04 the DASH program - that has always irritated me by keep popping up when I use spreadsheets and other documents that need the pointer to move close to the left edge of the screen causing the wretched Icons from DASH to pop up - is now PERMANENTLY down the side of my left hand side and as a result my internet pages all need scrolling to the right to get see the 1/4 inch pinched by DASH.

I understand I could just search for the video I want, but I'd like to have the functionality to have things organized in sub-directories and click through what I want via Unity.  Is there a way to tell it to recognize the directory structure in Unity?\n\nA: I think the lens is more of a searcher than an organiser and a link to open a folder\nwould do this better, however could always make a feature request at https://launchpad.net/unity-lens-videos\n", "Q: How to shrink a partition without using GParted? Unfortunately all the answers I found involve GParted. I thought I could be using parted, but apparently the \"parted resize\" command has some limitations with respect to GParted when working on a partition which has already a filesystem in it ( gives a warning and also can't work on filesystem with some special features like journal, etc... ) \nI was being able to shrink the filesystem ( ext4 ) by using resize2fs command, but now I don't know how to shrink the partition in order to create a new one. \nI also compiled parted 3.0, but in this new version the resize command has been removed altogether...\nShould I just use fdisk ?  In the man I don't see a resize command there, they say to use parted...\nThanks\n\nA: ...answering as best as possibile to my own question:\nIf for any reason you cannot use GParted, you will have to do it manually using some of these command line tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*parted\n\n*resize2fs\n\n*(c)fdisk\nThe steps can be different according to the filesystem contained in the partition. For example I found that parted cannot resize partitions which contains filesystem like ext4, so I had to destroy and recreate the partition with fdisk, making some calculations about the correct size. Also most of the commands can only used when the partition is not mounted.\nBefore using fdisk you may want to backup the partition table, i used dd for that task.\nAlso if you drive is setup with LVM you may use the tools provided.\nSome useful links I found:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize an ext3/ext4 partition\n\n*How To Resize ext3 Partitions Without Losing Data\nI will try to improve my answer as I gain more experience.\n\nA: If you really want to use the gui, and you have extra space (or perhaps can provision it on demand, or even temporarily purchase a new VPS briefly), then you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot in rescue mode\n\n*unmount /home, and dd (copy) the raw partition to a new partition (another device for convenience); we will refer to it as 'home2'.\n\n*You could now boot into 'full' system with gui if you prefer.\n\n*Verify your copy: fsck, mount, check that home2 is okay, then umount home2.\n\n*You can now run gparted on home2, verify that it is okay, figure out the exact partition size / blocks required\n\n*Boot in rescue mode again\n\n*Do the resize with confidence, or just delete that partition and create it again with required size (back up the partition table first though).\n\n*Use dd to copy the filesystem image back from home2 to the resized home partition.\n\n*Reboot!\n\n\nRealize that any filesystem changes to /home between steps 2 and 6 will be lost.\nDisadvantage:  that's an extra step or two, and requires extra disk space.\nAdvantage: you do have a backup copy of your partition.\nFor anyone not fluent with dd, fsck, fdisk, parted, mount, and partition tables, \nexperiment with a virtual server and a virtual disk; it's free.  Also, try experimenting with LVM, as it allows you to resize dynamically (no reboot or downtime required).\n\nA: Gparted works fine, but, as with any partition manager, you can not resize mounted partitions. And you can not un-mount your root partition while running your OS.\nSo the trick is: Use a Live CD / USB boot!\nThen you can resize any hdd partition, since none will be mounted.\nJust be aware that the system must have been properly shut down, as hibernated partitions should not be resized.\nAlso use fsck prior to resize, just to make sure there are not corrupted structures.\n\nA: I used fdisk to create a small partition before the boot partition then created a new boot partition and deleted small partition, rebooted, then ghosted back the c: drive.\nUsing the desktop version of gparted I was able to see I was close to the recommended 1024 alignment (1025) which gave me a five fold increase in 4kb read speed on crystal bench mark.\nWhen I was able to get the cd boot version of gparted and do a proper alignment by making a 2 mb space before then creating a 1 mb space, as recommended as the way  to get the optimum 1024 figure in gparted, I didn't see any improvement in the crystal bench mark scores.\nSo just going the fdisk way, and using crystal bench sees to me to give just as good results.\n\nA: Download Parted Magic's Live CD and boot using that.

I didn't know Dell had apt-get goodies in our repos but then again something told me to look.\nDell Latitude D620, wn3945ABG wifi card. \nPop out the keyboard and look under it [upper right] if you're in doubt of yours.\nNow if your wifi is a different flavor , Broadcom, Lynksys etc... This still might help, Chipset is important for integer and  DMA addressing of hardware.\n", "Q: 12.04 & 11.10 macbook pro issues. Trackpad and Mouse aren't working. Can't login or boot from cd I just updated my macbook to 12.04 LTS and upon install my wi-fi wasn't working or even showing up for that matter. I then downgraded to 11.10 via booting from an install disc. Upon downgrading to 11.10 I had the wifi problem yet again, along with my mouse not working. ( a USB one helped me ) \nI then restarted the system and wifi and the mouse problems were temporarily fixed. I then installed a few sources & apple drivers via terminal. I rebooted so these could take effect and my computer now won't respond to mouse or even keyboard actions. Even when plugging in a USB mouse or keyboard nothing works. \nI can't boot from CD holding C at startup, and can't get into the boot options with shift either. I also have tried Control Alt F1 with no luck.\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks!\n\nA: I had the same problem when booting from CD. Then I got it solved by holding the \"option/alt\" key and it shows whether to boot from CD. Hope it helps.

I have just reactivated the guest session in Ubuntu, because several people use my laptop on a temporary basis.

I need to work on a music assignment on a program only available for Mac OS X and Ubuntu, and will not be able to get a new hard drive for the Mac before the assignment is due. I only have non-administrator access to Windows XP and 7 computers.\nMy question\nCan I make a USB drive with Ubuntu on it so I can use my MacBook with this? Can I create this from a Windows computer? Please give detailed steps, if possible, for I am a noob when it comes to computers, and especially Linux.\nI have an 8-Gb flash drive available.\n\nA: There seems to be some confusion about EFI booting and Ubuntu ISOs. \nDisclaimer: I don't know much about Macs, because I never happened to own or support one of these machines. But I want to help anyway.\nLinux and Windows UEFI booting and Ubuntu Mac ISOs\nUsing Linux on Windows machines, my understanding is that to boot from external media via EFI you just copy the files from the ISO to a supported filesystem on the USB drive, which is usually FAT. ISOs that support UEFI booting contain a file called /efi/boot/boot{arch}.efi, where {arch} can be x64 for AMD64, ia32 for i386, arm or a64 for ARM and so forth. On (older) Macs this may just be /efi/boot/boot.efi.\nOkay, that's that. The strange thing is that the Mac ISOs don't contain such files and instead boot and install in legacy BIOS mode, which was fine in 2006 – when Apple introduced Boot Camp – but isn't since 2012 when the rest of the industry moved to UEFI.\nThe answers from Chan-Ho Suh and Colin Watson on similar questions don't seem to reflect the current state accurately.\nFixing the problem with UEFI loaders for older Macs\nI found a blog entry from AstroFloyd dealing with a very similar problem while being aware of the above.\nHis solution is to put an EFI loader that allows for loopback loading a UEFI-compatible ISO. Ideally you would just have to put two files on the FAT-formatted USB drive and that's it.\n\nFor clarity, all that is now on your USB drive is (relative to the root directory of that drive):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*/efi/boot/boot.iso\n  \n*/efi/boot/boot.efi\n  \n\nHis instructions are written using Linux tools and dealing with advanced details like setting the partition type, but I guess Windows and off-the-shelf USB drives already provide this configuration by default.\nTo be clear: Do not use the amd64+mac ISO, use the latest standard one.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*Matthew Garrett's post about the multiboot catalog on Fedora 17\n\n*U&L SE: Booting Ubuntu from usb on a Mac\n\n*Mac-Linux-USB-Loader via How do I boot linux from a EFI partition on a USB drive\nMore background information\nRod Smith – who is also around here – has published a very detailed article about EFI-Booting Ubuntu on a Mac on his site. He explains why installing Linux in BIOS mode on a Mac by using a hybrid MBR is at least to say a bad idea and covers a few scenarios of installing Ubuntu on a drive with an existing Mac OS X installation.\nHe is using his tool Refind, but as far as I know systemd-boot is also capable of booting OS X and working with Macs. It's probably a bit more difficult to configure.\n\nA: According to Apple:\n\nIntel-based Macs support starting from an external USB storage device's volume that: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Has been formatted with a GUID partition type \n  \n*Contains an installation\n  of Mac OS X 10.4.5 or later, or Mac OS X 10.5 or later, which is\n  compatible with (or shipped with) the Mac that the USB device is\n  connected to. Note: You should not use a version of Mac OS X that is\n  earlier (\"older\") than the version your Mac shipped with.\n  \n\nSo booting from a Live USB of Ubuntu with a Mac is not officially supported.\nYou may, however, try the steps described here (no guarantees!), or alternatively, just boot from a Live CD.\n\nA: There are many options that can help you to make a bootable USB drive from your Windows machine. My favorite one is Rufus (http://rufus.akeo.ie/). In order to create your bootable USB drive, perform the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download an Ubuntu ISO (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)\n\n*Download Rufus (http://rufus.akeo.ie/downloads/rufus-1.4.12.exe)\n\n*Finally, insert your USB drive, run rufus-1.4.12.exe, select the ISO file and click on the Start button.\n\n\nIf you encounter any issues, you can refer to the FAQ (https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/FAQ)\nGood luck!\n\nA: Not having administrative access on the PC does take some of the more user-friendly programs out of the equation (e.g. Yumi).\nHowever, after poking around Pendrivelinux I stumbled across an option that might work: XBOOT. Pendrivelinux has a guide here, but the major steps are this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the and unzip the application (here)\n\n*Plug in USB Drive\n\n*Drag the Ubuntu ISO into the program\n\n*Select \"Create USB\" and choose your drive\n\n\nedit:\nI just finished testing the program and it successfully created a bootable Ubuntu USB flash drive when I ran it on my Windows box (Windows 8.1), without asking for administrative access.\n", "Q: Multi-Workspace Compatible Taskbar in Unity 3D I'm currently using tint2, which doesn't seem to support workspaces in Unity 3D very well.

Here is the example of it (I was looking for the Diffraction Patterns option):\n\n\n*Use Case: Firefox / Chrome\nWhen browsing you would like to do some stuff quicker, here are some images that will give you an idea:\nIn Firefox I am trying to access a Web Developers Addon option about clearing all styles from web pages when I view them. This is a 3 to 5 click menu option depending on how you get to it. With HUD is faster.\n\nIn Chrome I am trying to clear the history and other stuff. HUD made it easier.\n\n\n*Use Case: Wireless Network Sharing\nTo create a Wireless Network Share you just type Net and the first option is the one.\n\n\n*Use Case: Connecting to Known Wireless Hotspot\nI wanted to connect to the Wireless Router in the house so I...\n\n\n*Use Case: Third Party Apps\nEven works with 3rd party apps like VirtualBox:\n\nAnd this is only the tip of the iceberg. The amount of time that HUD saves is one factor. The other is to quickly find options in a new program that you are learning. So it is very good for learning something.\nTo use it you just press the Left ALT button after selecting the App you want HUD to work with and start typing anything that might appear in the menus or sub-menus of an app.\n\nA: HUD is an alternative to the traditional menu bar of a window. It haves the same options, but you use it writing orders, instead of finding an option. It also remembers the most used options, so you can access quicklier to your menus.\nAnd why is it less useful than the traditional menus? Is the same, but faster and easier (in some cases). Also remember that the traditional menus are still there.\nTo use it, just press the Alt key, type your order, and click it or press Enter. Done!\nA screenshot of HUD:\n\n\nA: I hate when someone posts an URL as an answer, and I usually downvote them, but in this case, the old saying is true: an image is worth a thousand words. And this video is worth a thousand answers:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_WW-DHqR3c\n(and it's an official Canonical video from the Development Team)\nThat said, the default trigger to the HUD is a tap on alt key.\n\nA: I'm not sure the HUD is more or less powerful, but it does have a great advantage: if you're using the keyboard, it can help reduce the times you need to lift your hand from the keyboard and use the mouse.\nIf you're working in something and need to access a menu item, just tap the ALT key and the HUD will pop up (basically just an entry field).  Start typing what you want to do, and the HUD will try to find that menu item for you.  The example I've seen most often is that if you're working in Gimp, where there are LOTS of menu options, and you want to apply some effect or filter, you don't need to go up to the menu and start digging down; you can just tap ALT and start typing and the menu item will be found and then you can just scroll to it with the arrow keys and select it (for example, you can start typing \"blur\" and before you finish typing it the menu item will be found).\nIt's not a cure-all, and as a feature it's not yet finished.  Mark Shuttleworth just said in an interview that it still needs work.  But so far it can be pretty useful.  And remember, it is used for finding menu items within applications; it is not used for finding and launching applications (the Dash is for that).\n", "Q: Wireless was disabled?

I also can't add any files into the var/www/ folder unless I open it through sudo; Nonetheless, when I access localhost itself the default html appears which says it works. What could be causing this to happen? Thanks.\n\nA: Well, for security reasons, /var/www folder is usually only accessed via sudo. If you wish to drop your files, let's say: your index.html, images folder and other stuff inside of it you will be in the need to start nautilus (or your preferred files browser) with elevated privileges by running sudo nautilus in a terminal or gksudo nautilus in the \"Run application\" dialog window, this will cause the /var/www to be accessed with both read and write access.\n\nRelated to your \"403 Forbidden error\" you must be sure that the files inside of /var/www have the right permissions, which can be changed via sudo chmod 755 /var/www -R in a terminal for read/write permission only for the owner and read and execute permissions for users and others.\nHowever, if we wish to use another local folder for testing in our website/HTML/PHP code, we can change the default folder location used by our localhost/php engine to manage these files. This is done using the following procedure:\n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default\n\n*Provide user password\n\nThen, change all occurrences of \"/var/www/\" to the folder that we use to test our site/HTML/PHP. (Example: /home/geppettvs/www/ or where appropriate, change \"geppettvs\" with your local folder.\nAfter that you must restart the computer for the purpose of the changes to take effect. Do not forget also that the files must have the proper file permissions to run properly. (755 is usually sufficient, but some folders [and/or files] may need 777 permissions to read and write them correctly.)\nAnother trick would be to stop/restart the Apache service but I prefer to restart the computer. In addition, you might need to clear your cache/browsing history in order to the changes take effect and stop receiving the It works! from the sample page.\nGood luck!\nParts of this answers comes from: https://askubuntu.com/a/25045/9598\n\nA: Please write to terminal: \"gksu nautuilus\" (without quotes) write your (if you're admin) password to pup up window.Navigate to /var/ on your file system.

Is there a way around this without changing permissions every time I want to modify a file from Ubuntu?\n\nA: It looks like the files are owned by no one. So the command you should use is something like: sudo chown -R bobby:bobby /path/to/the/folder where \"bobby\" is your user name.\n\nA: This blog post helped explain the purpose of the 99:99 permissions.

I'm running 12.04 inside VMWare Workstation.\nWhat is wrong with my installation so that I cannot resize the window at the lower right corner? The lower left does work, albeit it's really hard to get it; upper left/right works OK, see this video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMNItB0BN-8\nJust to make it clear: this is not restricted to terminal, same with Firefox, synaptic, etc.\n\nA: I have found a few methods to solve this.\nFirst, right clicking the title bar gives you a menu with re-size in it. Then whichever corner your pointer is closest to becomes a re-size handle which you then left click to end. This method only lets you be closest to the upper left and right corners however.\nSo... if you instead, use alt and a right click in the window, again you get a menu, but this way you can begin in the lower left or lower right of the window and then whichever you were closest to becomes the re-size handle. Then you re-size until satisfied, and then left click to release and keep the new size.\nAnd lastly, since this menu show that alt-F8 is a shortcut, place the mouse pointer in the window closest to the corner you wish to re-size from and type alt-F8. When you release the keys, the mouse pointer will attach to the corner and you can re-size. Again, left click to end.\n\nA: There is a bug report for the fact that on Unity 2D (which I think is being run in the video, and may be the only option in VMWare) the borders are very thin and difficult to grab, though why you should see this particularly on that corner I don't know.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/metacity/+bug/878198\nThere is a workaround in comment #8.  It may be that will fix the problem here.\n\nA: I have exactly the same issue, also running Ubuntu 12.04 in a VMware virtual machine. It's the same using VMware Fusion and VMware ESXi. It is also extremely difficult to grab any window edge, for example, to stretch the window horizontally or vertically.\nThe only solution I have found so far is to use the shortcut of holding down ALT and using the third button (usually middle) on the mouse if you have one. This will allow the window to be resized while the pointer is within that window's boundary, bypassing the need to grab the lower-right corner.\n\nA: I have the same problem on default setup (just installed gnome-session-fallback) under VMware Player with Windows host OS.\nThe alt+middle click trick works.

But never on a Live USB.\n\nA: You say 'burnt onto a CD'.  It should be on a DVD as it is oversized.  Brasero would tell you that.  If you used a buggy CD burner it might have burned you a buggy CD.  This is why you are not getting the problem with a USB stick.\n", "Q: I'm so confused about full disk encryption. help :( I've been running a live CD of Ubuntu 12.04 for more than a few days now, reading and reading, but I'm not really understanding things when it comes to setting up FDE on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise. I'm sure for the majority of Ubuntu users, it must be quite a simple task. Full disk encryption sounds like a really smart thing to do for security reasons and all.\nI'd eventually like to do something like this: http://www.death-zone.org/luks/lukstool though I am not sure if it is possible with Ubuntu.\nbut my aim is to first get the basics down and then attempt to do the more advanced stuff. \nHave a look at this: http://www.death-zone.org/index.php?option=content&task=category&sectionid=2&id=42&Itemid=76 \nIt's the blog entry that explains the process behind the linked script above.\n\nA: I've been using Ubuntu with full disk encryption for over a year. The Alternate Install CD for Ubuntu 12.04 makes it easy. During the installation, when it asks you how you want to partition your disks, one of the options will say something like \"Guided - set up LVM with encryption.\" Just select that one and it will do all of the advanced work for you. All you need to do is come up with a passphrase and you're set.\n\nA: Basically until you fully understand it, why take the big risk of doing it and risking data loss?  It is only a good idea if you have really sensitive data on a hard drive on a laptop that could go missing.  Otherwise your login password is going to give fair security.\n", "Q: How to remove sub-folders from Ubuntu One or only sync the parent folder? I have been syncing several sub-folders of a single folder one by one so as to be able not to sync all sub-folders on all devices. Now I want to sync only the parent folder.\nIt seems to me that there is no way to do that automatically, right?\nBut, is there a way to remove all the sub-folders from the server, so I can add the parent folder?\n\nA: I had the same problem and was unsuccessful in solving it through the control panel, but I did solve it through the web interface. The control panel only controls how this device syncs with the cloud, so it can't remove folders from the cloud.\nBoth answers offered so far seem to misunderstand the question, so here is a clarification of what I believe was the original problem:\nLet's say that inside ~/Parent/ you synchronize ~/Parent/child1/ and ~/Parent/child2/, but not ~/Parent/child3/ or ~/Parent/child4/. Now you want instead to synchronize ~/Parent/ along with anything I put in there. But when you try to synchronize ~/Parent/, you get an error saying it overlaps with other things you've synchronized. You can stop synchronizing each of these folders through each device's Ubuntu One control panel, but the control panel cannot remove the folders from the cloud.\nThe solution is to forget the control panel and to log into https://one.ubuntu.com/files/, click on \"More\" to the right of each child folder, and select \"X Stop synchronizing this folder.\" Ideally, you should now be able to synchronize the parent. But for me this never works unless I restart the sync daemon (from terminal: killall ubuntuone-syncdaemon then ubuntuone-launch). Then I can right click on the folder I want to sync and select \"Ubuntu One > Synchronize this folder\".\nMaybe the developers will figure out in the future an easier way to synchronize the -parent folder that just includes all the already-synchronized child folders by default.\n\nA: There is no way to synchronize a folder and not its subfolders.\nOne thing you could do is synchronize a folder, move all the subfolders somewhere else, and use symlinks to make them appear to be inside the synchronized folder.\nSince Ubuntu One ignores symlinks, the subfolders would not be synchronized.\n\nA: roberto. you may be right with what you said (actually I don't know) but I do not believe you answered the question.\nI beliebe it's like this:\nYou have in Ubuntu One /Mystorage/ and then there come the folders like\n/Ubuntu One/\n/whateverfolder1/\n/whateverfolder2/\nwhat Martin did is he moved his folders all into /Ubuntu One/ which he probably should not have been done. I am doing the same mistake right now because I do not see a solution right now to stop the file synchronisation without lots of confusion.\nWhat Martin should have done is to right click any folder in his HOME directory in Linux and select Ubuntu One-Synchronize this folder\nthen he could also undo and redo and have his folders synched or not synched individually.\nthe /Ubuntu One/ folder is always in sync and also all its subfolders.\nI just wrote to the ubuntu support team and asked them to move all my folders out of the Ubuntu One folder.\nHow do symlinks work, Roberto? How can I do that?

I must have done this in 11.10 but i'm getting old.\nPlease treat me as a novice.\n\nA: First, open any folder that you choose to. After you have the file manager open, you will want to go to the menu for the program, click Edit and then click Preferences. After this, open the tab labeled Views. Now, look under Icon View Defaults for the box labeled Text beside icons. Click this box, and now all of the text for files and folders will be beside the icon.\n\nA: File names are shown under folders and files in Nautilus.  Something went wrong with your upgrade - probably due to gnome and old stuff in your config files.\nOpen up Terminal.\nYou can try some or all of:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^\nThe caret is important.\nsudo apt-get install -f\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nBut before you do anything, make sure you have the means to restore all data and you also are able to re-install everything on your hard drive including any other operating systems you have.

This went pretty well and the owner is quite happy, but there is still one issue: on Windows, he would use Live Messenger and get instant notifications on new emails. This feature is pretty important since the mails are received from the online shop and needs to be processed immediately. Since the personnel are not looking at the screen all of the time, an audio signal is mandatory.\nWhat software and/ or configuration is recommended to get this kind of notification? The default IM software is Empathy, but it does not seems to have a mail notification feature at all. The mail-notification package can only periodically poll for new mail, but I think that the Hotmail servers restrict the number of logins so this is not a real option either.\nFinally, I saw Pidgin as recommendation (I haven't tried the mail notification feature), but perhaps there are better alternatives? Pidgin is actually an IM client, which is not really needed in this case.\n\nA: Maybe I am not understanding the question properly but Thunderbird is perfectly capable of sound notifications. Assuming it's notification of email only that you want\n\nThen set Thunderbird to check for new mail every 1 min\n\n\nA: I see Ryan mentioned Popper already in a comment and that should work for you.\nAs an alternative you can also try MailNag, which is a non-Ubuntu specific mail notifier. The author describes it this way: \"Mailnag is a fork of the Popper mail notifier. What Popper is to Ubuntu's Unity, Mailnag is to GNOME-Shell.\" \n\nA: Guifications for Pidgin, mentioned here\nPlaced here for your convenience.\n\nInstall Guifications via Synaptic Package Manager,\n\nOnce Installed go to \"Tools/Plugins and choose \"Guifications\",activate\n  it and click on \"Configure Plugin\" in order to set your preferences.\n  You can set the position, stack, and other display options, the same\n  as Mouse behavior.\n\nAdditionally you can set which notifications you want to be notified\n  about and get themes to enhance your GUI notifications.\nNote: You might need to disable current notification popups in order not to receive duplicated notifications.\n\nAs you can see, you can define The Position, Stack, if you wish to show it while away (really useful!), animation, how long must a message last on screen defined by \"Display time\" (in order not to lose any purchase order for your clients) and the mouse behavior, among other useful configurable things which includes but not limits to:\nNotifications, will let you select which events you wish to be notified about.\n\nAdvanced options, including the maximum visible guifications and if you are using dual view monitors, choose where will the guifications be placed.\n\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: Help: Ubuntu installation not working... Kernel Panic I just tried to download and install Ubuntu on my HP Pavilion desktop, I installed it on a separate 72gb partition on my hard drive with the hopes of running it alongside windows xp professional. I used the Ubuntu Windows Installer and now whenever I reboot the machine and choose Ubuntu I get a message saying Kernel Panic, I'm sorry I didn't write down the specifics but I will try to restart, write everything down, and reply with all the pertinent info. Any help will greatly be appreciated.\n\n\n*\n\n*M                                                                                      Hello Barry, thank you for your quick response. Let me try to clarify. My computer has a 250GB Hard Drive with 2 partitions, one of the partitions, the D: drive has 72GB of free space on it.I used the following installer, not the live-dvd, to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-ubuntu-with-windows The installer had a drop down menu that allowed me to select the 72 GB partition. Once the installer went through its motions, it indicated that the system would need to be rebooted in order for the installation to be complete. I rebooted it, chose Ubuntu instead of Windows XP and got the following Kernel Panic message... [ 6.005387] Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount... then there are about a dozen more lines of text after that, I would try to post a picture of the screen but I don't know how to...         \n\n\nSorry for the late reply John, I just saw your comments. To answer your question, yes I tried installing Ubuntu on a hard drive that I also have Windows on, the main partition, the C: drive is the one that Windows is actually installed on, and the secondary partition, the D: drive (the 72gb partition) is the one I tried installing Ubuntu on. The D; drive actually had a few random files like music and pictures on it when I tried installing Ubuntu to it. I am now reformatting that drive so that it is completely empty, once it's been formatted I will try to reinstall Ubuntu. I am not sure what Wubi is... is that something I need to run as well? I apologize for being such a noob to all of this. I'm so excited to finally try Ubuntu:)\nUPDATE @ John: I tried to upload a screenshot of the KERNEL PANIC message but this message system isn't allowing me to post an image because I haven't earned at least 10 reputation points yet. I'm sorry, I just figured out that yes I did indeed use WUBI in another partition that Windows is not in. Is that my problem? Do I need to reinstall UBUNTU via WUBI in the main partion of my hard drive where Windows actually lives?\n@JOHN, do you by chance know if I can just create a bootable usb flash drive to install a fresh copy of ubuntu on to my empty 72GB partition? I want to be able to dual boot. \n\nA: @Man\nIf you don't mind reformatting the 72 GB partition which is currently D: in your Windows XP configuration, then you can install 12.04 Ubuntu using either a Live CD or a Live USB.\nOf course, using a Live USB is only possible if your HP Pavilion desktop allows you to boot from a USB flash drive.\nCan you provide any further information about your machine? A model number? What type of CPU (processor) it uses? How much memory is installed?\n\nNo, Ubuntu will not install into an NTFS partition. It will have to be reformatted to one of the Linux file systems. Usually the journaling ext4 filesystem is used.\nTwo possible approaches come to mind.\n\n*\n\n*During the Ubuntu installation you will be presented with a window asking you to choose what type of an install you wish to perform. At that point you can choose the action \"Do Something Else\" and manually format and select the partitions you want to use for your Ubuntu install.\nThis may be more involved than you want to get since you are new to all this.\n\n*If you use the Windows Disk Management tool and Delete Volume (i.e. the partition) and leave the space unused, then during install Ubuntu will suggest installing there and take care of the formating and everything else.\nThe install should offer to install Ubuntu \"alongside\" Windows. This is what I  suggest you do. The image below is an example of what the \"Installation Type\" window looks like. (Though in your case I expect it will be Win XP, not Win 7).\n\n\nWill a Normal Ubuntu Disk Install Be Faster Than Wubi?\nPerformance questions can be tricky. There are two answers.\n\n*\n\n*Yes, of course. There is less \"overhead\" when Ubuntu is directly installed so one would expect it to be faster.\n\n*But you may not notice. It may not be fast enough for you to be able to tell the difference in perfromance.\nDisclaimer: I do not know any details about how Wubi works. I've got a partly-baked picture in my mind, but my assumptions could be completely wrong.\n\nI am also a little bit biased in that I've never really embraced the concept of Wubi. I can see how it could make sense as an attempt to simplify installing Ubuntu for folks who are using Windows.\nBut if you had a more modern computer I'd be recommending using either a VMware Player or VirtualBox virtual machine instead. If your hardware supports virtualization I think that is a much friendlier route to exploring Linux when starting from a Windows (or Mac) background.\nBut if the only choice you have is to do a dual boot between Windows & Linux/Ubuntu, then installing directly to the drive seems to make the most sense to me.\nIf you have the time for it, you should install Ubuntu directly and just see what you think of the performance. You don't want to experiment later when you might have to worry about losing data.\n", "Q: MySQL server stopped working after upgrade \nPossible Duplicate:\nFixing broken myslq-server package after upgrade to 12.04 \n\nI upgraded to 12.04 and my MySQL server just stopped working.

I have a wired mouse \nP.S. I am able to connect my Apple keyboard in liveCD by clicking bluetooth icon and connecting it. However It doesn't work (keyboard) until that. (which means I cannot choose anything at CD start menu until connect it)\n\nA: No. The bluetooth daemon has not been started when you're running the installation, it starts when you enter the desktop environment. That's why you can use it with the Live CD but not in the installation process. You should get a wired keyboard (a cheap USB keyboard will do fine, perhaps some friend has one spare) and keep it around - if your computer crashes and you have to do something related to grub or using the terminal before the desktop environment has been started, you will need it.\nI'm using an Apple Wireless keyboard myself, but I have a wired Apple keyboard in the drawer for this sort of occasion.\n", "Q: How to show Arabic properly in PDF files?

It's pretty simple , when you run it you can select the whole directory and normalize the all the songs\nMP3DIAGS will do it too, however it's interface is much more difficult to understand.\n", "Q: HP LaserJet P1505 doesn't work after update to Ubuntu 12.04 My HP LaserJet P1505 doesn't work after update to Ubuntu 12.04 from 11.10.

interesting thing is that before upgrade and in Windows 7 Tonner light and Ready light were on, but in 12.04 only Ready light is on.\nAny ideas how to make my printer prints in 12.04?\n\nA: Delete your printer in the printer/CUPS panel. Then go to the ubuntu software center and install HPLIP. During that installation it will detect the printer and prompt you to download drivers directly from HP. DO SO.

Is there a special folder where ubuntu stores old files something similar to windows. Old as applied to windows (sorry for mentioning windows here :-P)\n\nA: Sometimes our last resource is to use some recovery tool like photorec or foremost.  \nPhotorec is easier to use: \n1) Install testdisk,  \n2) Open a terminal,  \n3) Run sudo photorec and answer the questions.  \n\nForemost lets you choose which files you want to recover: \n1) Install foremost,  \n2) Open a terminal,  \n3) The command is something like sudo foremost -d -vqT -o /media/sda3/foremost -t jpg,ole,zip -i /dev/sdb1 \nThe output folder comes after the option -o and the input comes after -i.   \nThe recovered files chose here are jpg, ole (= docx odt), zip.  \n", "Q: Couldn't find software sources and uninstalled and got message about future updates 12.04 Software sources wasn't showing up in the unity menu when I searched for it but it said it was installed in the software center.

With this driver in Ubuntu, I barely get speeds of 50 KB/s.\nEven then, it will momentarily disconnect at an estimated interval of 5 to 10 seconds everytime.  \nI have tried this guide to install the RaLink driver:\nhttp://carlivar.tumblr.com/post/10230485625/fixing-rt2870-usb-wireless-in-ubuntu-or-debian \nThe problem with that guide was, with my first install of Ubuntu 12.04 I lost all Internet connectivity.\nI am now on my second install of Ubuntu 12.04. I then tried this guide instead, I did every step:\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-install-rt2870-chipset-based-usb-wireless-adapter.html \nI managed to get through the whole thing without a problem, however upon doing:  \nlsmod | grep -i rt2870  \n\nIt returned blank. I had no internet connectivity and it did not recognize my D'Link adapter.\nI have internet connection now because I removed the previous blacklist of those modules, disconnected and then reconnected the adapter to get it using the old driver.  \nA strange thing that confuses me is that, Ubuntu uses rt2800 while others recommend using rt2870 yet when I do this:  \nlsusb\n\nI get this (truncated to show only relevant information):  \nBus 001 Device 009: ID 07d1:3c0a D-Link System DWA-140 RangeBooster N Adapter(rev.B2) [Ralink RT3072]  \n\nAs you can see, it clearly says RT3072. I seriously have no clue what Ubuntu is or is not using in the background. I assume lsmod is telling me the truth. How can I fix this problem with my Internet connection? Its almost unusable. I wait for more than half an hour for it just to check if there are updates because the connection gets stuck in a state of temporary disconnection. It doesn't help that it cannot reach higher speeds than 50KB/s, and even thats rare.  \nThis is not an issue with my adapter, as in Windows it works to its full potential. I have been having issues with this RaLink driver since 11.04. It's become so bad in 12.04 that I am pleading for help here.\nAddendum\nI have now also tried setting my wireless connection via Edit Connections. Under the Wireless tab, I edit my wireless and set IPv6 Settings to Ignore instead of Automatic as I have read elsewhere this also helps. In my case, this does NOT help.  \nI have also set my Wireless Power Management off via:  \nsudo iwconfig wlan0 power off  \n\nThis does switch off power management, but even this step does NOT help my connection from constantly speeding up one moment and dropping the next. I am getting really frustrated. I hope someone can guide me, or at least give me a tip that helped them previously regardless of hardware differences.\n\nA: I followed the same steps. However, the rt5370sta module does not support all DWA-140 B1 devices, believe it or not.\nMy devices product id is 3c09. Thus when I install the module rt5370 is not loaded.\nI have modified the files:\n\n\n*\n\n*/os/linux/rt5370sta.mod.c\n\n*/common/rtusb_dev_id.c\nIn (1) I searched for 07D1 and after the following:\nMODULE_ALIAS(\"usb:v07D1p3C0F .... \n\nI added the exact same line but with 3C09 instead of 3C0F.\nIn (2) I also searched for 07D1 (you can see where this is going) and copied one of the lines which contained 0x07D1,0x3C0 and changed it to 0x3C09.\nThe same steps were then followed (sudo make & sudo make install).\nNow whenever I plug it in rt5370 is loaded and after a reboot it works wonderfully.\n\nA: I had the same problem and I found the solution on the official French Ubuntu forum: \nGo to Ralinktech and download \"RT8070 /RT3070 /RT3370 /RT5370 /RT5372 USB\". Extract it (twice) and you should have:\n2011_0719_RT3070_RT3370_RT5370_RT5372_Linux_STA_V2.5.0.3_DPO\n\nOpen it, open the \"os\" folder and then the \"linux\" folder. Open \"config.mk\" with a text editor (gedit, nano or vim) and modify the following lines swapping \"=n\" to \"=y\".\n# Support Wpa_Supplicant\nHAS_WPA_SUPPLICANT=y\n\n# Support Native WpaSupplicant for Network Maganger\nHAS_NATIVE_WPA_SUPPLICANT_SUPPORT=y\n\nSave and close.

After this, the compilation was OK.\nI did reboot but the problem still was there. The difference was that now the \ngrep | ^rt showed:\nrt5370sta             450556  0 \nrt2800usb              18235  0 \nrt2800lib              45181  1 rt2800usb\nrt2x00usb              20330  1 rt2800usb\nrt2x00lib              49235  3 rt2800usb,rt2800lib,rt2x00usb\n\nThen used this \nsudo modprobe -rf rt5370sta rt2800usb rt2800lib rt2x00usb rt2x00lib\n\nand this\nsudo modprobe rt5370sta\n\nNOTE: The second method is an adaptation of the answer to another problem with DWA-140 that found before (and didn't worked to me with rt2870sta). To finish the operation, I've \"blacklisted\" the rt28x...'s like says in the other  link.\nAnd now it works fine, the wifi recovered the speed.\n\nSolution 2\nI updated the kernel to 3.2.0-24-generic and got back the same problems. But, I've done the installation of rt5370sta (just following the Galerien's instructions again) and it works fine again. \nNot needed to blacklist the others rt28x, it doesn't load any rt28x..\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 cant install dual boot on raid0, installer cant detect windows7 I just downloaded the .iso and launched it on a live USB.

This laptop will be going with me to school, work, the local coffee shop, etc.  So I wanted a secure way to browse without pesky filters and worrying about the open wifi.\nI setup a simple autossh script to run in cron on startup, but I want to route all my traffic, not just web traffic pointed to the local loop back.  That way I don't need to worry about my chats etc.  I've seen some other posts like this, but they had different requirements to meet, none of which I am limited by; so I'm curious if there is a better option then SSH (which seems to have quiet a bit of overhead).\nSo the question, what is the best option for tunneling all traffic (securely of course) from an Ubuntu desktop to an Ubuntu server?  One preferably with an example ;)\n\nA: ssh tunnels are the wrong tool for this; you want a VPN (or possibly TOR, but probably not if you only care about a single fixed endpoint server).\n\nA: You can use sshuttle.\nWhile doing it over SSH isn't the greatest idea, it works, and I've lost count of how many times I've used it when I can't get into my VPN.\nThis is how to get it set up:\nFirst, make sure git is installed by running:\nsudo apt-get install git\nThen, clone the code from github:\ngit clone git://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle\nYou'll need root or sudo access, and python needs to be installed.\nThen, do this:\n\ncd sshuttle\n./sshuttle -r username@sshserver 0.0.0.0/0 -vv\n\nAlso, to make it easier to access everything via ssh, you'll want to set up DynDNS or something similar.\nBest of luck, and safe browsing!\n", "Q: Logitech USB headset not working on 12.04 I've looked around for answers to this question, But none of them seem to work for my particular problem.
