["Q: How can I reset my GRUB background to default? I installed some sort of software (I think it had to do with Gnome) that changed the splash image behind the GRUB boot interface from the standard purple background to a somewhat tacky Debian splash image.\nIs there any sort of quick set of commands I can enter or file I can delete to change it back to the default background?\n\nA: A quick way to delete the file is done opening a terminal with CTRL + ALT + T and executing these command\nsudo rm /usr/share/images/desktop-base/desktop-grub.png\nsudo update-initramfs -u\nsudo update-grub\n\nInsight on that file\nIt comes from the desktop-base package.

If you want to allow a local file to access a local file in google chrome you go to the terminal and run\n$ google-chrome --allow-file-access-from-files \n\n\nA: The different modes like --allow-file-access-from-files are flags/switches and not meant for general users. So you can't change it permanently with regular builds. The purpose of these switches/argument is to provide choice. These flags are neither supported nor recommended and must be used as temporary.\nSince you don't want to use .desktop file or changing any shortcut. The only thing you can do is to look into code of open source chorimium .\nCustomize the code and build it. Then only it will open with your desired mode.\nList of switches | Source\n\nA: Navigate to the desktop launcher / menu entry, open the launcher properties dialog for google chrome.\nIt should look like this:\n/usr/bin/google-chrome %U\n\nTo make the flags that you want permanent, modify it to something like:\n/usr/bin/google-chrome --allow-file-access-from-files\n\nYou may also need to delete and re-pin your icon launchers after modifying it. Chrome should launch with the specified flags enabled after the modification.\nAlternatively, you can simply create a new launcher with the above and use it to start chrome.\nTo check if the flags that you modified are being loaded:\n$ cat ~/.config/google-chrome/Local\\ State\n\nand scroll up to the block entitled \n\"session_restore\"\nYour flags should be listed in the block, before \n--flag-switches-begin --flag-switches-end.\nOpening chrome and navigating to the URL\nchrome://version/\n\nshould also list enabled flags in the \nCommand Line \n\nblock\nThis is a list of the google-chrome / chromium flags:\nhttp://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/\n\nA: Google-chrome and Chromium should function the same, the differences are pretty minor except for multimedia (especially Flash) and some file/folder locations (chromium instead of google-chrome) see http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/ChromiumBrowserVsGoogleChrome\nYou should check out https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Chromium_Tips_and_Tweaks\nespecially:\nMaking it all persistent\n\nYou can export your flags from ~/.profile:\nexport CHROMIUM_USER_FLAGS=\"--disk-cache-dir=/tmp --disk-cache-size=50000000\"\n\nOr add them to /etc/chromium/default:\n# Default settings for chromium.

I have a Intel Celeron 900 @ 2.20 ghz will it run or does it require a amd 64bit proccesor.\n\nA: The Intel Celeron 900 is actually a single-core version of the Core 2 Duo processors. It supports 64-bit and Ubuntu 12.04 x64 will run just fine on it. \nHowever, if you have less than 1GB of RAM you should consider running the 32-bit version for performance reasons.\nThe 64-bit version of Ubuntu will run on any PC (or Mac) with a 64-bit Intel or AMD processor. The amd in amd64 doesn't mean that this architecture is AMD-specific.

Thank you.\n\nA: A simple way to encrypt a single file is with openssl:\nopenssl des3 < youfile.txt > yourfile.txt.des3\n\nThis will prompt you for a passphrase, which you will need to enter later when decrypting the file.\nopenssl des3 -d < yourfile.txt.des3 > yourfile.txt.decrypted\n\nTo make this \"graphical\" you could put it in a Nautilus script and make it accessible from the context menu. (See the docs of Nautilus for that.)\nUPDATE\ndes3 is just an example. Run openssl enc -ciphers or openssl list -cipher-algorithms to see the full list of ciphers.\n\nA: Try http://www.aescrypt.com/ it works great.\n\nA: Lets assume that a person wants to encrypt a file called 'message.txt':\n1. Encrypting a file using GPG, for personal use\nI. Using a passphrase to encrypt the file (and not the private key)\nI.i. The command:\ngpg -c message.txt\ndoes it; it asks for a password (and a password confirmation) and generates an encrypted 'message.txt.gpg', which is binary.\nI.ii. If you want to generate an ASCII encrypted file, which is base64(i think) of that file, you can use\ngpg -c --armor message.txt \nThis will generate an 'message.txt.asc', which is the same as the generated by the command before, but base64 coded, i.e., the encrypted file in text mode (.asc, not binary as .gpg would be).\nII. Using a private key to  encrypt a file\nII.i. If you want to encrypt a file using your key, instead of only a passphare, use the command gpg -e -r 'yourname' message.txt.\nThe argument 'yourname' should contain a part of the name that you used to create the private key. If you dont give the -r parameter, gpg will ask for it. You can type our name then (the same that you would type on command line).\nII.ii. Point II.i would give you a binary file. If you want to get an ASCII file, use --armor. gpg -e -r 'yourname' --armor message.txt.\n2. Decrypting the file encrypted with GPG\nTo decrypt, the file, use the command gpg -d --output OUTPUTFILE message.txt.gpg. This will ask for the passphrase and then decrypt the file message.txt.gpg to OUTPUTFILE, if the passphrase is correct. This passhrase is that which you used directly (point I., the -c parameter), or through your private key (point II., the -e parameter) This works for both binary (.gpg) or ascii (.asc) files. If you supress the --output FILE, it is outputted to console (stdout), then you can do this also, that is, redirect it to a file: gpg -d message.txt.gpg > OUTPUTFILE.txt Both do the same. 8 )\n\nA: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2811528/can-i-use-my-ssh-public-key-to-decrypt-a-file\nIs a question on a related subject.

Evaluating burning programs is difficult: it takes more time to find how things really are, and meanwhile the errors are very unpleasant. Also, a lot of people, in Linux as well as in Windows, seem to take it very lightly when evaluating burning software. I have read  along the years a lot of good comments on all sort of Windows programs that after a while prove not to worth trying - at the expense of my time, lost data and nerves. Burning software is good until it is proved otherwise, which usually doesn't take to long. They should be discussed against reliable benchmarks set by well confirmed software: Nero, and lately ImgBurn (and maybe also CDBurnerXP) in Windows.\nI have looked at AcetoneISO, Brasero, and K3B (which many recommend) but they seem more limited than the mentioned Windows apps. They are all said to work, but then at a more basic level (create ISO, burn them, etc.). When it comes to something like creating a DVD movie disk from DVD movie files present on the hard drive, it seems to me that I would have to firstly create the ISO and then burn it, which involves using more hard drive space and more time.\nMy own experience with the most recommended Ubuntu burning software (k3b, k9copy) was bad. (Could it be related to their k-related condition and my Xfce DE?) \nOne is not bound to give a second try to one peace of software that crashes or gives an unreadable disk the first time.

What is the equivalent of this command in lubuntu?\n# compiz --replace\n\n\nA: compiz is the window manager used by Unity. Running compiz --replace when Unity is running will start a new instance of the window manager, replacing the old instance.\nLubuntu uses the openbox window manager. So if you want to do is to run a new instance of openbox, replacing the old one, run:\nopenbox --replace\n\nThat's probably what you want.\nOn the other hand, if you want to replace openbox with compiz, just run compiz --replace. (If that doesn't work, try killing openbox manually first with killall openbox.)\nBy the way, you've written compiz --replace with a # character in front of it, as though you're running it from a root shell.

My knowledge dictates that ITunes was meant to do the role and since then other players have offered an easier and better route to do the same.\nI believe RB, banshee and other players only recognise the IPod and do not participate in implanting any imprints into the IPod player. \nIn Manual Control in RhythmBox, you are essentially dragging and dropping. \nThis may not be the exact answer but if not you, will help others who come along seeking information.\nCheers.\n\nA: Under ubuntu 10.04, in rhythmbox you can select your music files, drag them to the ipod icon on the left side panel and thus to copy the files in the ipod.\nWith an another computer running ubuntu 12.10, I try to do the same but it doesn't work no more!! What seems to be possible is to SYNCHRONIZE. I bet that  files in the ipod, but not in the computer will be erazed.\nDoes that mean that rhythmbox behaves like itune, I guess yes! \n", "Q: USB Keyboard works occasionally A few days ago I bought a SL640 Hama USB keyboard to use on my laptop with Ubuntu 12.04.\nBut I'm having problems, as it works one time out of 10!\nOn my girlfriend's laptop, which runs Windows Vista, this keyboard always works. It also always works on my laptop, when I boot into Windows 7 instead of Ubuntu.\nHere are some infos:\n~$ lsusb\nBus 006 Device 003: ID 04d9:1503 Holtek Semiconductor, Inc.

But I'm not interested in it. I just want to use it in Ubuntu.\nHowever, in GRUB it works sometimes.\nSurprisingly, now I have booted my laptop: the usb keyboard hasn't worked in GRUB but it has worked since the ubuntu login!

When I install Ubuntu, do I have to type any codes?\n\nA: By code if you mean product keys like windows then answer is no.\nUbuntu is completely free of charge. You don't need any product code. You can download it, burn a disc or create a live USB (using appropriate software) and install it. Even before installing you can select Try Ubuntu to run it directly from the live CD/DVD/USB.\n\nA: There are no codes or keys required to install Ubuntu.\nInstallation is especially easy with the installer provided for Windows on www.ubuntu.com, known as the Wubi installer. While an installation from Wubi will prevent hibernation (suspend works just as well in my opinion) and has some very minor read/write hindrances, it allows you to easily install and uninstall Ubuntu without all of the complications and possible dangers of partitioning.\n", "Q: How to prevent quickly from replacing Exec=.* in the .desktop file?

I love the Ubuntu guest-account and I think that this is the best possible way to help my guests get free internet-access.\nI found out how to \"design\" their user-accounts with /etc/skel, but unfortunately I have no clue, how to show them a small introduction to the system and a kind of user-agreement \"contract\" when they login. I read of xmessage, but this is too minimalistic. I'd like to implement some pictures.\nDoes anyone have any idea of how to make this possible? Would it be possible that the user is logged out automatically if he rejects the user-agreement?\nThank you so much in advance, Steve.\n\nA: This is just a wild guess, but couldn't you quickly hack up a simple webpage and add an entry to the startup programs that opens a browser displaying that website?\nWith this initial message being a website you could easily add pictures, even videos and links to internet ressources.\n\nA: There is gmessage which is much nicer looking than xmessage, but it won't give you pictures either.\nYou could have libreoffice open with a document file you have designated for them to see, and you could insert pictures into that.

I need to connect via vpnc from university to the work network. Logging in works fine, however I cannot reach any machine behind the VPN. Also, my internet still works w/o me setting up the work proxy. Any help is highly appreciated!\nThis is my /etc/resolv.conf before connecting:\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\nsearch [university-domain]\n\nAnd this is the same file after connection has been set up:\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\nsearch [university-domain] [work-domain]\n\nFrom looking at other resov.conf contents on my colleagues' machines, the nameserver is not updated to the one within the work network. This is how my colleagues' resolv.conf looks:\n# Generated by NetworkManager\ndomain [work-domain]\nsearch [work-domain]\nnameserver 147.243.4.86\nnameserver 147.243.4.70\nnameserver 147.243.1.52\n# NOTE: the libc resolver may not support more than 3 nameservers.\n# The nameservers listed below may not be recognized.\nnameserver 147.243.1.53\nnameserver 147.243.128.216\nnameserver 147.243.128.217\n\nMy colleague runs an older Ubuntu version (11.04 I guess). \nPlease let me know!\n\nA: Your /etc/resolv.conf looks correct both before and after you connect, assuming that you have a local forwarding nameserver running which listens at 127.0.0.1. In Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop such a nameserver is running by default. To see the nameserver process, run\nps -elf|grep dnsmasq\n\nThe reason your colleague's /etc/resolv.conf looks different is that your colleague is not running a local forwarding nameserver. Also, your colleague does not have the resolvconf package installed and so your colleague's NetworkManager process is writing directly to /etc/resolv.conf instead of using resolvconf for that purpose.\nOn your machine, addresses for work LAN nameservers should not appear in /etc/resolv.conf. That should continue to show only \"nameserver 127.0.0.1\" (or \"nameserver 127.0.1.1\" in Ubuntu 12.10.) The work LAN nameserver addresses should be sent by NetworkManager to the local forwarding resolver to use as forwarding addresses. To see what addresses have been sent, do\nnmcli -f IP4 dev list | grep DNS\n\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 the addresses can also be seen in /run/nm-dns-dnsmasq.conf but in Ubuntu 12.10 the addresses are sent from NM to dnsmasq over D-Bus and so can't be inspected that way.\nIn the original question it is not even clear that the problem is DNS-specific. Does the questioner have any network connectivity at all with the work LAN?  Can the questioner ping IP addresses on the work LAN?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.4 not listed while in boot menu I am using Dell Inspiron 17R with Windows7 as the primary OS to boot my system up.\nI am new to Linux and to begin with, I thought of installing Ubuntu 12.4 AMD 64 bit version on my laptop.\nToday I performed a successful installation on my laptop but when I reboot, it doesn't show me the Ubuntu OS in the list (I can only see Windows7). Is there any way to bring up the Ubuntu entry into this list?\nWhile installing I selected the option to have both Windows7 and Ubuntu OS on my laptop. The root drive for both OS is C: drive. Hence I split the drive into two (250 GB for Windows7 and 250 GB for Ubuntu). Now I can only see 250GB in my C:\\ drive for Windows7. Is the remaining 250GB assigned to Ubuntu or did I lose that 250GB space??\nYour answers will be highly appreciated..\n\nA: It sounds like something went wrong with the configuration of your boot loader and that should be fairly easy to fix. I'd suggest you boot from the live CD and install and run boot-repair to try fixing the issue. You can find installation instructions and a guide to using boot repair here.\nIf that doesn't do it, I'd suggest you post the URL boot-repair gives you here, so we can further analyse the problem. Good luck!\n\nA: I am installing Ubuntu 12.04 right now. I guess your problem lies in the \"intall ubuntu along side Windows 7\" step. Here i suggest you 2 solutions that might be helpful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go back to windows 7, and download a software named something like EasyBSD, which enables you to configure the boot menu and the order of OS.\n\n*If Solution 1 fails, then reinstall ubuntu.

In a first try I installed the Nvidia driver, but it didn't work as expected.\nThank you!\n\nA: If you installed bumblebee, you should already be using the Nvidia driver when calling the program with the optirun prefix. There is a difference though between using the GPU for applications that use the Nvidia driver and using it for CUDA.

Using local network broadband, we can use it to buy games and applications from load balance. Is there any possible ways to use it also in Ubuntu software Center?\nadditional:\n I'm using mobile broadband for the internet connection,this broadband has a sim card and account number where you can download money from buying a prepaid card worth 100 pesos,300 pesos or 500 pesos, provided by our local network. We use this mobile broadband when there is no wifi connection. There are two kinds of mobile broadband, one is postpaid account and the other is prepaid account. I use prepaid account, this kind of account can load a money for transaction like data plans, from 10 pesos for 30 minutes internet connection or 200 pesos for 5 days internet connection., and this prepaid account can load 5 pesos up to thousands of pesos. \n Now, if this prepaid mobile broadband can provide money in pesos and has internet connection, I think it can also use it for buying goods or applications or games via internet. \ni think its only need a software that can detect the sim card number and the money balance for transactions. \nSorry for my bad english but I hope you got my point.\n\n\nA: No\nThe money you load in your prepaid mobile phone account can usually only be used for services provided by the phone company, such as data plans, ringtones, phone games, etc. It cannot be used to make purchases over the Internet -- you typically need a credit/debit card or a bank account for that.\nIt cannot be used to make purchases from the Ubuntu Software Centre\nWhile some local phone companies may provide a service allowing you to shop at local Internet sellers with the pesos in your prepaid phone account, this does not apply to all sellers on the Internet and definitely not to sellers based in the US (dollars); unfortunately this includes the Ubuntu Software Centre.\n\nA: If you are looking to convert currencies from the command line, add the following to the bottom of the ~/.bashrc file:\ncurrency-convert() {\n        wget -qO- \"http://www.google.com/finance/converter?a=$1&from=$2&to=$3&hl=es\" | sed '/res/!d;s/<[^>]*>//g';\n}\n\nNow, open a new Terminal session.

The upgrade from 10 to 11 went just fine, but when going from 11 to 12.04, my computer crashed in the middle (I don't remember why).

So here is the question : \nHow would I re-install Ubuntu 12.04? Is there a guide out there for this?\nThanks.\n\nA: I am going to post some Important steps with screenshots , here you go.\nBoot from Live Usb Drive or Live Cd of Ubuntu 12.04.\nSelect the Try Before Install option ( take back up before proceeding if required), then at the desktop select the Install Ubuntu 12.04 option.\n\nSelect the Language from Left Side menu, and Continue\nThen make sure you have Internet Connection ,don't select anything & Continue\n\nThen At this Below image Menu select the Last option ( Other options Might Vary to that of yours) Something Else ,& continue.\n\nYou will be brought to Partition table , Most important step also,\nSelect the Partition Your current Ubuntu installation is On , most probably will be with ext4 ( or ext3 ) type and verify its size if you know it  , if you can't recognize then Open the Dash and search for Disk Utility & maximize it, select your hard drive , and search & select the ext4 or ext3 partition , you will find its appropriate /dev/sdaX number , now Back in Installation menu , Tick mark the Square Box to Format it , & select the Mount Point as /  only ,stating root partition.\nSince you are re-installing, so i am  assuming that you already have swap partition present as from below image.\nDon't click Install now yet , see the Device for boot loader installation option , preferably select /dev/sda without any number adjoining it.\n\nNow you can Cross-check the partition and booting option , and Select Install now to go forward. Further options are pretty simple , they don't need instructions.\nHope your installation successfully finishes.\n\nA: Your're right, reinstalling sounds like a good idea in your case. I'd suggest you checked out the Ubuntu Manual. You can download it here and it covers the installation process in depth starting in chapter 2 (I believe). Good luck!\n\nA: Agreed, reinstalling sounds like the best option, here is a guide as requested :\nFirst boot the live cd and select try ubuntu.  \nWhen it has loaded open disk utility and click on your hard disk,\nthen click on the partition you want to install to (you should recognise it by the size or ext file system),\njust below you should see device followed by something like /dev/sda2\nand so sda2 would be the partition to install to.\nNext click the install ubuntu icon on the desktop,\nselect the bottom option something else.\nYou will then be able to select which partition to install to,\nwhich will be called sda2 (or whatever you saw earlier in disc utility).\nClick on that partition and select change then select format as ext4 and give it a mount point of /. \nFinally click install at the bottom.\n", "Q: Cursor becomes not working after changing to hand I just finished downloading a file using Firefox, and then the cursor changed to a closed hand and stayed like that. \nI could only move the cursor around using my touchpad, but it doesn't work when I tried to click something.\nThe keyboard seems still work.

Using Ubuntu One, you could even keep all your files in sync (or give each user rights to each others folder and use rsync, but Ubuntu One is easier).\nEDIT: darent beat me by seconds.\n", "Q: Making the screen darker than the lowest brightness setting I'd like to make the screen in Ubuntu darker than the lowest brightness setting.

We need to buy a couple of engineering laptops. Our 1st choice would be Dell Latitude. \nUnfortunately, in the past, my colleague had many problems installing the Ubuntu on his E6510. The main issue was that the screen remained blank after boot. The solution was to connect to an external monitor - but this is not an acceptable solution for a mobile configuration.

As I've finished my app for the App Showdown, I ran quickly submitubuntu, but I found that my app is installed inside /usr/bin. What? I need it at /opt! How can I fix this?\n\nA: Right, after running quickly package --verbose --extras (which does essentially the same as quickly submitubuntu except for uploading to a PPA) it looks your package does not even build.\nIt looks to me as if it might be an issue with the source tree layout. You've ported your app to Quickly, but you might need to make it a bit more Quickly-compliant. For one, I spotted that the virtuam folder where Quickly expects to find the app code is missing. You sould create and move your code there, instead of having it in virtuam_lib.\nI've also noticed that in vui.py you've got a hardcoded path: os.chdir('/usr/share/virtuam/ui'). In general, hardcoded paths are considered bad practice, as they make your app less portable. Have a look at how Quickly loads the .ui file by creating an example app with quickly create ubuntu-application foo.\nIn general, if you need more help with this, I'd recommend to use the Ubuntu App Developers mailing list, or the Quickly talk mailing list as yours is a very localized issue that will require more support and might not be useful to other Askubuntu users.\n", "Q: HP Pavilion G Series Wireless Switch On my HP laptop, the wireless switch is the F12 key, which works fine on my windows partition, but not in Ubuntu 12.04.

I'm a big fan of electronic music, and I tend to have my tracks playing in the background while I do things on my laptop, either in YouTube or in Clementine, my default music player. All has worked very well until now.\nA couple of days ago my entire PC started to lag really badly. Almost everything was unusable.

Nothing seemed to happen immediately, but once I opened up YouTube all the audio on videos stuttered a lot, while the videos played smoothly. I restarted Firefox to find that the audio was now not working at all, with both headphones and speakers, and the volume up quite a bit (it's not muted, I've checked that!).\nA little bit of research later and I've discovered that pulseaudio plays an important part in Ubuntu's audio. Even after restarting my PC the audio still ceases to work in any applications or with any output. The pulseaudio process refuses to start up again.\nSo, can you help me out here? What can I do to fix my problem, and why was pulseaudio doing this in the first place?\n\nA: The problem may be associated with pulseaudio settings of your user profile.

If the user decides to simply uninstall, and re-install, to try and solve some problem, this \"solution\" would result in all of those fogapps they had, no longer being accessible.\n\n*You can add TryExec to the desktop files, which the system will check for and hide the launcher from view, if the app is not installed.\nHow are these \"fogapps\" started exactly? If you tell me, I can update the answer to provide an example.\n\nA: It's a very bad idea to have a postremoval modify user homes:\n\n\n*\n\n*A user's home directory may be used with more than one system\n\n*On system with a very large user base it can take quite some time to delete all the files.\n\n*You may not be able to access the users's homes if they are encrypted or you need to authenticate before mounting them from a server.\n\n\nI'd install a small clean up script in the user's home the first time he creates a fogapp .desktop file.  You may even offer an option to only remove those files created on the current system.\n", "Q: What Packages/How Do I Uninstall Propriety AMD Catalyst Driver How do I go back to the open source driver?\nI installed AMD driver following on screen instructions but have a little shaded square in bottom right hand corner that says \"AMD Unsupported hardware\".\nThe Linux PDF says to use native package manager to uninstall driver, but I need to know what it is called to locate it.\nThanks.\n\nA: Here is the correct way to remove the ATI drivers:\nsudo sh /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev*\n\nNote: ignore any errors you may have got form running the first 2 commands.\nRemove your xorg.conf file\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nRe-install xorg\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:amd64 libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 libgl1-mesa-dri:amd64 xserver-xorg-core\n\nConfigure xorg\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\nReboot:\nsudo reboot\n\nSource form Install ATI official drivers in Ubuntu\n", "Q: How to delete Grub Menu from the disk without Linux? How do I remove Grub Menu from the disk without Linux?\nWhen I boot from the disc out the string Grub Rescue.\nPreviously, I installed Ubuntu 10.10 and randomly chose the wrong drive.\n\nA: You need to boot your windows disc, and repair the master boot record from the recovery menu.\n\nA: Your best and fastest option would be to download an rBoot ISO and burn it to a CD.

It is happening, in VLC, mplayer, and anything streaming from the internet.  I followed the procedures in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshootingProcedure but nothing has helped so far.  There is the problem that the driver version is out of date but it does not seem to want to update with the given commands.\n$ bash alsa-info.sh --stdout |grep version\nDriver version:     1.0.24\nLibrary version:    1.0.25\nUtilities version:  1.0.25\n\nHow can I upgrade the driver and fix the stuttering?\n\nA: Once it stutters I always got rid of this problem by killing/restarting pulseaudio.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo killall pulseaudio\n\n*sudo pulseaudio --system=1 --daemonize\n\n*Close and re-open chromium\n\nA: I followed the answer/tutorial in How to solve jitter (or stutter) playback via Chrome flash plugin? and now playback seems to work again:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to chrome://plugins in Chrome.\n\n*Activate the details by clicking on the \"+\"-sign which you find on the top, right side.\n\n*Deactivate the Chrome flash plugin: On my system it is located in /opt/google/chrome/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so.\n\n*Use the one which is installed together with Mozilla Firefox: On my system it is located in /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so\nUnfortunately I would not entitle this as a solution for your problem. It is more a workaround until the problems with the original Chrome flash plugin are solved. But until then you are still able to use your Chrome browser.\n\nA: 12.04 - Ubuntu/Linux Audio Skipping/Stuttering\nI fixed this problem system wide, by changing the audio standard in my BIOS from HD to AC97. Ever since then, I've had zero problems with audio in my computer.\n\nA: I found that it is specific to Google Chrome.  Unfortunately whenever Chrome is running it also interferes with audio in other places as well, but since chrome is almost always running it was difficult to track down.  Solution: switched back to firefox, as audio problems are too large to ignore.  Audio problems are gone now.  I'll check with chrome again after a few updates.\n\nA: For VLC - in the menu go to preferences.  Choose Audio settings, and change the audio output module to Alsa audio ouput.  Close and restart VLC.\n", "Q: How to use inputted text with quickly I just need the code necessary to have my application assign the input from a text box to a variable after 'Enter' is pushed, and then use it to change a label.\nThis is what I have for this problem:\ndef on_action_activated(self):\n    self.next = self.action.get_text()  \n\nAnd then for using it I'm doing:\ninfo.set_text(\"Would you like to start a new game? (no saving yet, working on it...)\")   \n\nAnd it's not working for me. Now I'm doing all of this in several different functions, so would that be causing the problem, or is it just something else? I have created the local variable for both the label and the text box.\n\nA: I dont have access to the code I used to do it now, but if you have created your local variable for the text box, with the self.textbox = builder.get_object('glade texbox id') (or something like that), you should be able to do on_textbox_activated(self): self.variable = self.textbox.get_text(), with the \"textbox\" in \"on_textbox_activated\" being the name of your textbox widget without the self prefix. As for your label, I am pretty sure you can use set_text('text here'), so self.label.set_text(self.variable). \nsee http://www.pygtk.org/docs/pygtk/class-gtklabel.html for the label if the set_text does not work. \n", "Q: Will Ubuntu work if I install it offline? I´m going to install Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop, and I don’t have internet at home. \nI know that I can install it without internet, but , does it work?\n\nA: Yes it will work, however with some restrictions.  For example there are \"Must do\" updates if you want to play MP3s or movie files etc. (Ubuntu Restricted Extras).  \nAlso you need to install medabuntu libraries if you need to play DVDs.  There are others but apart from these restrictions Ubuntu will work.\nI had to to this once and was able to update everything at a later date\n\nA: As everybody say, you can install Ubuntu 12.04 offline but there will be a lots of packages, updates and softwares that you may need. \nTo solve this problem, you have different ways to install software and package in a computer without a Internet connection.\nOne option is Keryx, a portable package manager. Keryx offers to you a nice GUI making easy to use it. And, as if it were not possible to be better, it's open source!\nHow it works?\nYou download the package that you need in another computer with Internet connection and then install it in your computer offline.\nYou can download Keryx from their official website. This software support 32 & 64 bits architectures.\nA screenshot:\n\n\nA: Absolutely, you just wont get the updates at the time of installation.\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu without an Internet connection.\nFrom my experience it is not good idea to install Ubuntu offline, some third-party software needed to install from source or script which will cost you extra trips to get the missing packages.\n\nA: As an alternative to Keryx, you can use apt-offline or apt-offline-gui.\nPre-requistes: A friend's system with Internet connection. apt-offline installed in both your systems.\nThe Offline installation is achieved in 3 simple steps.\nStep 1:\nGenerate a signature file on the Disconnected Debian box at home\napt-offline set /tmp/apt-offline.sig\nThe above command will generate all information required from apt about updating its database.\nStep 2:\nDownload data based on the signature file generated earlier\napt-offline get C:\\apt-offline.sig --threads 5\nThe above command will download data as mentioned in the signature file. To speed up downloads (that can be from multiple apt repositories), in this example we spawn 5 download threads.\nOnce completed, you could just copy the data (an archive file, if you used the --bundle option) back to the removable medium and copy it back onto your offline host.\nStep 3:\nOnce you're back upon the home Debian machine, you feed the data from the removable medium to apt-offline:\napt-offline install /media/USB/apt-offline.zip\nThis will update the APT database on your disconnected machine seamlessly.\nApt-offline can be even used in Windows systems. In my opinion, apt-offline is the best option for Offline installation.\nSource\n\nA: In a single word: Yes.\nIf you have already burned your ubuntu release at a USB or a CD common sense states that all the files and components of your operating system are included. That happens to any operating system.\nTake for instance Windows:\n-Are you in need of an internet connection when you install it at a computer through a CD? \n-No.\nOn the other hand if you are going to install using the windows installer (Wubi) which installs ubuntu at your existing Windows partition, you must have an internet connection in order to download the .iso and proceed to the installation.\nHowever you should notice that if you do not have a working connection you will not be able to download any updates(except if you have an old release which is no longer supported by Canonical)  from the update manager. You can always type sudo apt-get update in order to install any updates and fixes to your system.\n", "Q: What's the difference between Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Cloud live image? I'm not sure what the difference is or which one I should download. I have a server rack I'm putting together and I don't know much about servers. I love ubuntu though. If I want to use this a work server to host things and a personal server for experimenting, which should I use? \nI also might dual boot this with windows server 2008 eventually. I'm using a dell power edge 2500 with 5 scuzzy drive totaling 100gbs and maybe 2gbs of ram.\n\nA: It depends on what you want to do with your server, but probably you want to use Ubuntu server.\nCloud live is an image that you can write in a USB drive and boot to create a cloud computing environment. Please note that this is a live system (i have never used it, so i don't know if you have the option to install it in your system). Also, if you really want to setup a cloud system you can install Ubuntu server and the cloud tools after.\nSo, unless you want to try a cloud computing system, you need Ubuntu server.\n\nA: Cloud live is actually non-persistant (atleast what i used) , that means what you do on it is lost after you reboot.... but it is only a demonstration and use of OpenStack if you dont want to install it (without juju its difficult , rather too difficult (but i did it :) without juju only to find out about juju next day :)). \nSo if you want to see how private cloud is , try for cloud image , or if you want to use trial for EC2 its good , for checking it out. If you are not interested in cloud computing, please avoid it ...\n", "Q: How do I push my app to Launchpad if I have followed the recommendations of the App Review Board for Quickly apps? I developed an app called Discvur with Quickly. I intend to submit it to the App Review Board so that it can be published in the Software Center. Therefore I followed all the recommendations on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviewBoard/Submissions/QuicklyTips and changed my files accordingly.\nNevertheless, when I do quickly share, Quickly overwrites all my debian files. So my app is not installed in /opt/ and I cannot launch it at all.\nAm I having a bug, did I do something wrong while following the instructions ?\n\nA: According to the source package you did not apply the changes to debian/rules.\n\nA: Quoting from the Ubuntu App Showdown page:\n\nRun the following command to package and upload your app:\nquickly submitubuntu\n\nYou should use the submitubuntu command instead of share. submitubuntu will take care of everything for you, so that you don't have to modify any debian files. You may want to learn more about the difference between these commands and what other Quickly packaging commands do, so have a look at the description of Quickly packaging commands.\nAlso, bear in mind that during the contest we detected some bugs in the submitubuntu command, so be sure to install the version of Quickly that fixes the most critical one, as described in the App Developer Blog announcement.\n", "Q: I want files in fat32 partition to be shown in my personal folder I have a 25 gig partition in ext4 for Ubuntu, an NTFS 25 gig partition for Windows 7,a logical swap of 2 gig, and then a logical 60 gig partition in FAT32 which I've read is the correct file system for files as music, pics, videos I want to share with Windows. The problem is that those files are not \"asociated\" or shown in my personal folder, and it would be great to.\n\nA: This should be very easy to do.  You can easily mount the drive wherever you wish.  I would recommend mounting it in the directory /mnt, then possibly creating links to different directories within the drive, to the conventional Music, Pictures, Video, etc directories in you home directory.  Here is my suggestion.\nCreate a directory called /mnt/shared.  You will need to use a terminal commandline to create this: sudo mkdir /mnt/shared.  You can then take ownership of this directory using the command sudo chown yourname:yourname, where \"yourname\" is your login name.\nMount the partition in /mnt/shared.  To make it permanent, you will create an entry in /etc/fstab using a text editor such as \"gedit\".  The first thing you need to do is to find the UUID of the partition (the UUID is a unique ID for the partition that never changes).  To do this, enter sudo blkid and find the correct partition.  It will list logical names, labels, UUIDs, and types.  You will want to copy the UUID to the clipboard for pasting into the file.  This is the part within the double quotes after \"UUID=\".  Also, make note of the \"TYPE\"; I don't have any FAT32, so I'm not sure what it will say.\nAs suggested in the comment by ObsessiveFOSS below, you might want to make a backup copy of the fstab file before editing just in case.  \nEnter the command gksu gedit /etc/fstab and add a line at the end that will look like this (substitute the UUID you copied for the ###### part):\nUUID=######### /mnt/shared vfat user,rw,umask=111,dmask=000 0 0\nSave the file, but don't close it yet, and test using this command: sudo mount -a.  This will mount everything in fstab, and output an error if there is one.  If there is no error, you should be able to access the drive at /mnt/shared.\nIf there are any errors, you can try correcting them right away and repeating the command sudo mount -a if you think you see the error.  If not, and you need more advice, I would advise disabling the command temporarily by adding a pound sign at the beginning, which makes it into a comment.  This way, you won't inadvertently reboot with errors in the file, although this is usually harmless, especially with the new entry at the end of the file.  A disabled entry would look like this:\n# UUID=nnnnnnn /mnt/shared vfat user,rw,umask=111,dmask=000 0 0\nThen, if you have a directory such as \"Pictures\" in this directory, you can create a soft link to it in ~/Pictures if the existing Pictures is empty by deleting the existing directory, and creating a link.  The easiest way to do this is to use Nautilus, and in your home directory, right-click on \"Pictures\" and choose \"Make Link\", delete the existing \"Pictures\", rename the new link to \"Pictures\", then copy and paste the files from /mnt pictures folder into this one.\nAlternatively, you can create links with new names in your Home directory.\nEdit:  Creating links to FAT32 files/folders\nIt seems that Nautilus will not create a link on a FAT32 partition, and there's no way to use Nautilua to create a link on the target drive, so I think the links will have to be made using the terminal (I can't test due to no FAT32 partitions).  \nTo create a link to the entire shared directory, you can enter something like this command:\nln -s /mnt/shared ~/shared-drive   (-s is for symbolic link)\nYou can also create multiple links to directories within the shared drive.  You must specify the entire path to the linked drive - it can't be a relative path.\n", "Q: Why is my package information seemingly not updating?

It doesn't matter.\nI then attempt to wake the computer either by opening the lid (if it was closed) or hitting the power button. Again, doesn't matter.\nThe computer will then immediately shutdown about 50% of the time. It seems to be more likely to shut down the longer it has been on suspend.\nI took a snapshot of /var/log/pm-suspend.log after a successfully resume and a shutdown. The only difference (outside of timestamps of course) was that a successful resume, after reporting the success of various suspend hooks, writes:\nThu Jul  5 21:36:45 PDT 2012: performing suspend\nThu Jul  5 21:37:10 PDT 2012: Awake.\nThu Jul  5 21:37:10 PDT 2012: Running hooks for resume\n\nand then reports successful resume hooks. When it shuts down, the log ends at \"performing suspend\". I diffed the two files so I know this is the only difference.\nThus, it looks like it's not even trying to wake up.\nWould love some ideas on this one. I've scoured the web but can't seem to find anyone else running into the same issue (it seems more common that the computer shuts down upon entering suspend, or only on hitting the power button to wake, and haven't seen any that are random like mine).

I recently had to disassemble and reassemble it (had to install a fan), and so could have messed something up in that process.\nUPDATE:\nI've upgraded to 12.10 and am still having the same problem.\n\nA: For several people, this was an issue with NVIDIA drivers and was solved by installing the latest proprietary drivers. If you, like myself, have an NVIDIA Optimus graphics card, the hardware is unsupported for suspend operations. To update your drivers:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nI hope that this points you in the right direction!\n", "Q: What procedure should I take to update a specific application? I installed nmap from the Software Center and their version is 5.21. After this, I downloaded the latest version that is 6.01 but I haven't installed it yet.\nWhat I should do and why?\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall the currently installed version and then install the new version.  Or..\n\n*Even with an older version installed, install the new one over this.\n\n\n\nIs this applicable to upgrading any software packages on Ubuntu or it doesn't?\n\nA: When you chose install, the Software Center will replace the current version with the newer version, i.e. upgrade to the newer version.\nBy just upgrading, you will be more likely to keep any  custom settings you have.  The only way I would uninstall first is if I thought I might have some bad settings that are stopping the program from running properly and wanted to do the quick and dirty fix instead of tracking down the incorrect setting..  However the only way to reliably wipe all you old settings it to run\napt-get purge {application name}\nand to the final part of your question, this applies to just about any application I can think of.  I have even upgraded my network manager while online and then continued to stay online(the old version continues to be used until the program is restarted, in the NM case that is reboot unless you force it to stop and start manually.\n\nA: Trouble is: if you install the new version from source (instead from a package), the packaging system is not involved. This is no problem if you make sure to install it in a different location (using PREFIX=/usr/local in this case with ./configure). You could chose so if you want to use both versions in parallel.\nA different approach would be replacing the installed version. But for this you need a .deb package. Again not a real big deal: there's a package called checkinstall in the Ubuntu repos. Instead of the triplet ./configure && make && make install you simply use ./configure && make && checkinstall. You will then be asked a couple of questions for the package (make sure to give it the same name as the installed one -- in your case nmap, and specify the correct version info -- everything else is rather optional), then checkinstall creates a .deb and installs it. This way, if there's a new version available via the repos, you will be able to update easily -- as the packaging system was kept involved.\nYou can read more on checkinstall on its Homepage, or find more detailed instructions in the Community Ubuntu Documentation.\n\nA: Uninstall the version 5.21 currently installed and then install the new 6.01 version fresh. If it is a .deb file, double click on it and Software Center will take it from there. Software Center may reject a non-repo source if there is a repo source application already installed. In rare instances, the software may be installed separately, resulting in two versions of the same software installed on the same computer. In any case, removal of the old package and installation of the new package is recommended, not required. \nDoes that answer the question that you implied but wrote incorrectly?\n", "Q: installer can't find partition, but fdisk can find them My computer had two operating systems installed: Windows XP and Ubuntu 10.10.\nNow, I want to update Ubuntu to 12.04.

I want to change the font in the login screen - where is the configuration for that?\n\nA: I will recommend the two best ways to change the default font of lightdm.\nOpen terminal and run the command pkexec lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings \nif it doesn't work for you, you need to install it manually using the command sudo apt install lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings and after installation , run  pkexec lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings.A window will appear where you can configure the lightdm.\n\nAnother method is to change edit the conf using the dconf-editor.\nOpen dconf-editor and search greeterfrom the search box\n.\nClick on the first option that appears and configure all your lightdm settings there.\nIf you don't have dconf-editor installed , install it by sudo apt install dconf-editor\nThis is not the answer for question asked 8 years ago but for the current users who are facing this problem.\n\nA: Start by opening up a terminal, start typing \"terminal\" in your unity dash to see the option or press ctrl+alt+t\nLets go to the correct directory:\ncd /etc/lightdm\n\nNow lets make a backup of the file before we make any changes:\nsudo cp unity-greeter.conf unity-greeter.conf.bak \n\nNow we need to open up this file and see whats changed, type/copy this:\ngksu gedit /etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf\n\nThe file should look like below:\n#\n# background = Background file to use, either an image path or a color (e.g. #772953)\n# logo = Logo file to use\n# theme-name = GTK+ theme to use\n# font-name = Font to use\n# xft-antialias = Whether to antialias Xft fonts (true or false)\n# xft-dpi = Resolution for Xft in dots per inch (e.g. 96)\n# xft-hintstyle = What degree of hinting to use (hintnone, hintslight, hintmedium, or hintfull)\n# xft-rgba = Type of subpixel antialiasing (none, rgb, bgr, vrgb or vbgr)\n#\n[greeter]\nbackground=/usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png\nlogo=/usr/share/unity-greeter/logo.png\ntheme-name=Ambiance\nicon-theme-name=ubuntu-mono-dark\nfont-name=Ubuntu 11\nxft-antialias=true\nxft-dpi=96\nxft-hintstyle=hintslight\nxft-rgba=rgb\n\nThen save and log out.\n\nA: In case you want to customize your Display manager lightdm may not be the ideal choice. \nI would replace it with mdm (themability, graphical configuration tools, etc) , which is a bit more bloated but you won't notice any difference except it's running on a 12 year old notebook. \nInstructions to do so can be found here: \nHow can I replace LightDM with MDM?\n\nA: You can try the method mentioned here: https://askubuntu.com/a/224060.

This model of Samsung has Fn key, when used with F1 - F8, it can control brightness, volume and some other stuff.\nEverything was working perfectly. Few minutes ago, I locked computer by Ctrl + Alt + L and started cleaning up the keyboard. When I logged back in, the F1 - F8 keys are working for controlling laptop features and they won't work for what they actually are.. i.e. Alt + F4 doesn't work anymore. Alt + Ctrl + F1 to switch to tty1 doesn't work. \nIt seems like, the Fn key is recorded as 'pressed' in the system. How do I resolve this?\n\nA: While cleaning the keyboard, you would have pressed Fn Lock button which is next to the F12 button so the function keys are locked, press it again; it will unlock the function keys so that you can use the function key properly.\n", "Q: **Wired** network disconnects when laptop unplugged I am using Xubuntu 12.04 with Network Manager on my HP 5310m Laptop and get a weird problem on wired network.\nWhen googling for answers, I found many people get the problem that wireless disconnects when laptop unplugged. For example, this question: Wireless disconnects when laptop unplugged from power source\nHowever, my problem is that my wired network of my laptop will auto disconnect when unplugged from a power source. Now if I want to use wired network, I must have my laptop plugged. If someone unplugged the power source of my laptop, my network connection will lost at the same time.\nI think this may be some kind of \"power-save\" method but I searched /etc/pm-utils/power.d/ without find anything about wired network.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: Well, I almost forgot that I asked here this question.\nI have already figured out why. There is nothing to do with software, drivers, et cetra. This is indeed a hardware issue. The motherboard of my laptop will automatically turn off the wired NIC when unplugged. There is a switch in the CMOS setting named \"Power save on LAN\". Turning if off solves this issue.\n\nA: Wired or wireless works on the same way in NetworkManager daemon.\nTo avoid using it I had set up my own static eth connection for networking service in \n/etc/network/interfaces<br/>\n\niface eth0 inet static<br/>\naddress 192.168.1.2<br/>\nnetmask 255.255.255.0<br/>\ngateway 192.168.1.1<br/>\n\nThen remove eth dhcp from the NetworkManager gui, otherwise it overrides it.\nYou can also set up dhcp there:\n    auto eth0\n    iface eth0 inet dhcp\nIf your eth is not eth0, you need to change here.\n", "Q: How to find history of shell commands since machine was created? I created an Ubuntu virtualbox machine a couple weeks ago and have been working on projects off and on in it since then. \nNow I would like to find the syntax of some commands I typed in the terminal a week ago, but I have opened and closed the terminal window and restarted the machine numerous times.\nHow can I get the history command to go back to the first command I typed after I created the machine?\nOr is there another place that all the commands are stored in Ubuntu?\n\nA: By default, there is no place where all commands are recorded and kept indefinitely, although ~/.bash_history contains the past few commands (if you use bash, which is the default shell in Ubuntu).\nIf you want every command typed in bash recorded forever, you have to set it up yourself.  For example, you can put the following in your ~/.bashrc file to log all the commands typed in a bash shell to the file ~/.command_log:\n# log every command typed and when\nif [ -n \"${BASH_VERSION}\" ]; then\n    trap \"caller >/dev/null || \\\nprintf '%s\\\\n' \\\"\\$(date '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z')\\\n \\$(tty) \\${BASH_COMMAND}\\\" 2>/dev/null >>~/.command_log\" DEBUG\nfi\n\nThe above sets a trap on DEBUG, which is executed just before an ordinary command is executed.  The caller built-in is used to test whether the command is being typed at an interactive shell or run via something like ~/.bashrc.  The value ${BASH_COMMAND} contains the command currently being executed. \n\nA: Something that might also be of interest to you is how to search through your previous command history. You can reverse search your history on the command line by pressing Ctrl+r and then typing letters you wish to match. If you have more than one matching command, press Ctrl+r again. To quit the reverse search, press Ctrl+g.\nhttp://www.ice2o.com/bash_quick_ref.html\n\nA: You can only go back so far as your history limit is set; once it has reached that point the history will start to be overwritten. However, it is possible to have a larger history size for the future.  Put this in your .bashrc and specify a value (mine is set at 1000):\nexport HISTSIZE=1000\n\n\nA: It may or may not be possible to get all commands. It depends on how many commands you executed and how the history limit was set.\nNevertheless, you can see the history list which is stored here:\n/home/$USER/.bash_history\n\nwhere $USER is your username.\nHere is a related question (for handling multiple shells history): Is it possible to make writing to .bash_history immediate?\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 11.10 from USB? I tried 'burning' the .iso onto a USB like I normally would with Ubuntu Desktop or Server 12.04, but it gives me an error during installation and tells me that it can't get files from CD or something.  So, is a USB installation of Server 11.10 not possible?  \nP.S. I need to install 11.10 because 12.04 is giving me a LOT of problems trying to convert to a static IP.\n\nA: I have personally installed various Ubuntu server versions from USB. I use the Ubuntu Startup Disc Creator (installed by default in Ubuntu desktop editions). I do remember something like this happening to me with another distro, and I think it had to do with the way I made the USB stick. This http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1369628 thread suggests that unetbootin could be the source of the issue in at least one instance, which also confirms my experience. If you haven't already, I'd try the Ubuntu Startup Disc Creator.\nI have assumed you have an Ubuntu desktop install, my apologies if not.\nGoodluck!\n\nA: To install the desktop version of Ubuntu via USB drive, I used this tool: http://www.linuxliveusb.com/\nCertainly it won't be much different with the server version.\n", "Q: WUBI installation error- cannot unpack wubi.exe I was trying to download Ubuntu on Windows installer mode. I downloaded the Wubi.exe file and when I ran it, it said cannot unpack c:\\users\\dell\\downloads\\Wubi.exe. What should I do?\n\nA: Try downloading it again. The file might be corrupted.\n\nA: Sometimes this happens with media on which the filed from ISO have not been burnt properly. But sometimes it is possible that media that was running properly starts giving you issues after a failed install attempt.\nI had a properly working Ubuntu install CD. I tried installing it on boot but then had to power down my laptop because the freaking installer hung. The console showed me a kernel panic and I was never able to use that disc again. \nEither way, you have to burn again.\n", "Q: How do I enable the AppArmor profile for Firefox? Recently there an article in about configuring FF with AppArmor.\nWhen I ran the below command\n\ncat /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox | sudo apparmor_parser –a\n\nI get the following error\n\nError: Could not read profile –a: No such file or directory.\n\nHow to get rid of this error?\nAlso, I don’t use the FF which comes with Ubuntu, but I download latest FF and start using it. What changes to the command are required?\n\nA: Simply run this instead of using cat:\nsudo apparmor_parser /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox\n\n-a or add is the default operation apparmor_parser performs. \n\nWhy? the command as you tried it will work if you are logged in as root or you recently used sudo; the sudo password entry is causing the problem you experienced.

In order to keep certain settings in sync, is it a good idea to place app configuration files into ~/Ubuntu One folder, e.g. ~/Ubuntu One/.myapp/myapp.conf?\n\nA: Generally, no, it's not a good idea to store configuration files in Ubuntu One. There was a session at UDS Q about this. I'm not sure where the audio stream is for that at the moment, or the Etherpad URL, but it's worth going through.\nMost applications do not do the right thing with storing settings (configuration/preferences), state, and authentication details, and will often lump them all together. Also, even if all the apps did do this correctly, using Ubuntu One file synchronization is the wrong way to go about syncing such data. The upcoming u1db structured data storage and synchronization support, would be a much better way of doing the job.\n\nA: See Will Ubuntu One support OS Settings sync? for some discussion on this point. In general, as dobey says above, it's not a good idea to sync configuration files for apps, because the apps are not written with the expectation that those files might change.

I have messed around with the template1 database, and would like to reset everything as it was.\nHence I have done a sudo apt-get purge postgresql\nHowever the next time I reinstalled it, the databases are still there. Why? Nothing has been reset.\n\nA: When you create your databases, the datafiles for this databases are created. These are (of course) not being purged by apt purge.\nIf /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf (presumably it is not 8.4 - use your version`) still exists, you can find a line like \n\ndata_directory = '/var/lib/postgresql/8.4/main'         # use data in another directory\n\nThere you can find the datafiles for your created databases. If you created your own data directories, I believe you remember where they were.\nDoes the user postgresql still exist? This is the owner of the database files. Delete this user with searching for all his files (use sth like deluser --remove-all-files, man deluser helps you).

I start the screencast using the Ctrl-Alt-Shift-R shortcut and the red light appears in the bottom right corner. I go about my business then press the key combination again when done. The problem is that the screencast file gets generated maybe 1 out of 10 times.\nIs there a log file I can look at to determine the issue? How about a settings file?\nUPDATE:\nI did some additional testing. What's happening is that the screencast does work but it appends the new video to the existing file. Even if the file is renamed or moved to trash. Emptying trash does not create a new file either. Not sure where the video gets recorded to then.\nThe only reliable way I've found to have a new file created is to log out of the session and log back in.\nIs this expected behaviour? Is there a way to force screencast to create a new file every time Ctrl-Alt-Shift-R is pressed?\n\nA: As a triage for this (until it gets fixed upstream) you can reset gnome shell (which doesn't log you out, close applications etc) do the following:\nAfter stopping your recording press ALT + F2 then type r and press ENTER.\nThis will reset gnome shell (and thus close the file handle).\n\nA: It appears that Gnome 3 is not closing the file after you press Ctrl+Alt+Shirt+R the second time to stop the recording.  \nPressing the same sequence again causes the new video data to be appended to the still open file.  If you delete the file, Gnome 3 still does not close the file and continues writing to the now deleted file. The video data essentially goes nowhere. (I think that it is being written to the disk, but as part of a file that has already been marked as deleted.)\n\nA: If you couldn't figure out, I suggested going around using Ffmpeg command for screencast. One of commands could be \nffmpeg -f x11grab -r 25 -s 1024x768 -i :0.0 -vcodec huffyuv screencast.avi\n\nMore example is at Ubuntu Wiki ffmpeg\n", "Q: Minimal LAMP iptables setup What rules are needed for an Ubuntu LAMP server only having minimum necessary ports open.\n\nA: Minimal?

If so , in what development or contribution terms.\nIs the Ubuntu kernel developed by Two different teams or same team.\nP.S.:  Just noticed that sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade provides me upgrade to .43 kernel , which normally requires sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to upgrade to newer kernel available , unless it normally provides message like \" Following packages were not upgraded...\" , is it an error or an exception to this Canonical Kernel PPA.\n\nHeres the apt-config dump\n\nA: *\n\n*The \"core\" Linux kernel is developed by Linus Torvalds and the \"Linux Team\" (lots and lots of developers, many of whom are employed by different companies).\n\n*\n\n*Canonical Kernel Team consists of those core developers who are employed by Canonical\n\n\n*The Ubuntu kernel team does not work on the core kernel, but instead customizes and builds them for Ubuntu, i.e. they turn Linux kernels into \"Ubuntu kernels\"\n\n*\n\n*They also provide mainline (i.e. \"core\", uncustomized) kernel builds as a courtesy, for debugging purposes only.\n\n\n*If you really want to try advanced kernel builds, the safest is the Ubuntu kernel-team's pre-proposed PPA (ppa:kernel-ppa/pre-proposed), which is not a mainline build and should soon find its way into a regular update.\n\n*\n\n*The Canonical kernel team PPA is semi-private, and shouldn't really be subscribed to by normal users:\nThis ppa is used for building pre-release and test kernels. \nIt IS NOT RECOMMENDED that you subscribe to this PPA.\nTypically the kernels for an LTS release (and otherwise) will contain just bugfixes and minor improvements, no radical new features (e.g. btrfs, etc.).\nP.S.: Based on your screenshot, this appears to be an exception for the Canonical Team ppa. After all it's meant for internal developer use only...\n", "Q: Gnome terminal is not running `source ~/.bashrc` when opened? I have a clean installation of Ubuntu 12 and I installed bashmarks, a utility to have favorites folders on the terminal.\nOne of the steps is to include source ~/.local/bin/bashmarks.sh at the end of ~/.bashrc, so each time you open a terminal it loads bashmarks.\nIf I run source manually it starts working, but when I open a terminal is not sourced automatically.\n\nA: The problem may be that the tilde expansion is not working at the time that .bashrc is being run.  It may work if you either put the full directory, or use $HOME instead of the tilde. \nLooking at my system-supplied .profile, they run .bashrc, if available, by using this command:\n\n\"$HOME/.bashrc\"\nPerhaps you should try a similar statement:\n\"$HOME/.local/bin/bashmarks.sh\"\n\nA: Sounds like a double to this question. It might be that the bash in your terminal is a login shell what means .bashrc is not sourced.\n\nA: Use the -i option when loading bash to ensure it opens in \"interactive\" mode, thereby sourcing from ~/.bashrc upon opening. Like this:\nbash -i\n\nFrom man bash:\n\n-i        If the -i option is present, the shell is interactive.\n\n\nAnd under the \"INVOCATION\" section of the man pages (emphasis added):\n\nWhen  an  interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads and executes commands from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if these files exist.\n\n", "Q: Recover EXT4 Partition from Interrupted Resize world! [that's funny, it automatically takes out leading \"hello\"s]\nI'm installing Ubuntu on a friend's laptop, and I encountered a problem while resizing the Ubuntu partition.  I was expanding it to the left (move and resize), but the process was interrupted while it was performing the actual data copying.  GParted says the partition is corrupted and the filesystem can't be read.  Now, I'm not worried about reinstalling.  The problem is that I had already copied some of the files over from the Windows partition.\nHow can I resume the copying process?  Here's what GParted says about it:\nFilesystem volume name: <none>\nLast mounted on: /\nFilesystem UUID: [tl;dt]\nFilesystem magic number: 0xEF53\nFilesystem revision #: 1 (dynamic)\nFilesystem features: has_journal_ext_attr_resize_inode dir_index filetype extent flex_bg sparse_super large_file\nDefault mount options: user_xattr acl\nFilesystem state: clean\nErrors behavior: Continue\nFilesystem OS type: Linux\nInode count: 1155072\nBlock count: 4619008\nReserved block count: 230950\nFree blocks: 764535\nFree inodes: 968259\nFirst block: 0\nBlock size: 4096\nFragment size: 4069\nReserved GDT blocks: 1022\nBlocks per group: 32768\nFragments per group: 32768\nInodes per group: 8192\nInode blocks per group: 512\nFlex block group size: 16\n...\nFirst inode: 11\nInode size: 256\nRequired extra isize: 28\nDesired extra isize: 28\nJournal inode: 8\n...\n\nJournal superblock magic number invalid!\n\nUnable to read the contents of this filesystem!\n...\n\nOne particular thing that intrigues me is the has_journal_ext_attr_resize_inode attribute under Filesystem features.  It's as though it knows it was in the middle of a resize.  Just a guess.\n\nA: You can't; the filesystem is toast.\nIn order to resume the move, you would have to know exactly where you were in the process when it was interrupted.\nAs for the features, I think you inserted some underscores where there are none.  has_journal, ext_attr, and resize_inode are separate features.  The first is the ext3/4 journal that logs metadata updates to the fs so it can recover quickly after a crash.  The second means that extended attributes are enabled, and the third allows the fs to be grown while it is still mounted.  None of them have anything to do with gparted's moving of the partition.\nYour only hope is photorec, which may be able to recover some files onto another disk, though without their names or other metadata.\n\nA: I'm not exactly sure what you did there. Did you just expand the file system, or were you moving the partition too? Have you been copying file into that partition during resize? This is a very bad idea. Are those files from a windows partition you were trying to delete at the same time? This is really confusing.\nIf you're just trying to recover the file system and it has just a bad superblock, first make a backup of the drive and a dump of the broken file system, to not make things worse. Than try this: Linux: Find Alternative Superblocks\n", "Q: Need to downsample video to a lower resolution I would like to convert a Mp4 file in HD into a Mp4 file of lower resolution. Is there any software that can be used for this?\n\nA: Terminal commands (Which by default are not installed) are:\nMENCODER\nInstall it by sudo apt-get install mencoder\nmencoder \nThe part about mencoder that you want is the parameter -vop scale which tells mencoder to what scale you want the video to go to. This is normal if you want to reduce bandwidth use, lower video size, etc..\nmencoder input.mp4 -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mp4 -vop scale=640:480 -oac copy -o output.mp4\nor\nmencoder input.mp4 -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mp4 -vf scale=640:480 -oac copy -o output.mp4\nor a simple\nmencoder input.mp4 -vop scale=640:480 -o output.mp4 \nAlthough from my experience is better to include additional information for video and audio like the one above.\nFFMPEG (Deprecated)\nInstall it by sudo apt-get install ffmpeg\nffmpeg \nHere is an example of ffmpeg:\nffmpeg -i input -vf scale=iw/2:-1 output\nWhere IW = Video Input Width.\nScale = Parameter to scale to. In this case you are dividing the original size by 2 (iw/2)\nboth of which can provide more information if you either execute them without parameters or variables like just mencoder or ffmpeg or type for example man mencoder or man ffmpeg which will give you a VERY extensive little manual on how to work with them.\nAVCONV <-- I love this guy!\navconv \nTo Install - sudo apt-get install libav-tools\nTo Run - avconv -i input.mp4 -s 640x480 output.mp4\nWhere -i is for the original input file, -s is for the size for each frame and the name of the output final goes in the end.\nGUI tools which I love are:\n\nAVIDEMUX - It can resize and lower the size which helps in cases where the objective is to lower size. avidemux \n\nHANDBRAKE - Excellent tool for converting videos and optimizing size. I use it a lot when going from ogg to mp4 with h.264. Lowers A LOT the size. handbrake \n\nOPENSHOT & PITIVI - Both are good video editors tha can help lower size when rendering the video. openshot  and pitivi \nSo in conclusion, for direct resizing/scaling you can use the terminal ones. For size you can use all.\n\nA: Use avconv. Type in terminal\navconv -i input.mp4 -s 320x240 output.mp4\n\nReplace 320x240 with whatever resolution you want. \nThere a lot of additional options that you can play with. Do man avconv to know more.\nInstead, if you don't have avconv, you could use ffmpeg.\nInstall:\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\nConvert:\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -s 320x240 output.mp4\n\n\nA: Use VLC.\nFrom the Media menu choose \"Convert/Save\". Add your file(s) to the input and click Convert/Save button.\nYou'll then be asked to specify an output file, and you can choose a profile and tinker with it, e.g. here I scale the video by 50%:\n\nClick Save.\n", "Q: Windows 7 not loading from Grub, Ubuntu 12.04 dual boot I have the results of my boot script run here:\n                      Boot Info Script 0.61      [1 April

I have successfully installed some packages using the command line 'sudo apt-get install packagename' when I have known in advance that those packages are available.  But how can I search for or get a list of what is available in the repositories?\n\nA: Using aptitude, apt-cache, and apt all format the output differently. (None of these require the use of sudo when searching for a package.) I prefer using apt for its readability. It highlights the package name and puts a space between the different packages. It also has [installed] listed next to each package that is already installed. Usage:\napt search package-name\n\n\nA: Assuming you want to do all of this from the terminal use the following:\nfirst I recommend you update the package index files so the list of all files in the repository you are about to create is up to date\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthen use \"search regex\" function in apt-cache where \"regex\" stands for Regular Expression and is the pattern given to search. For more info about search patterns you can look up manual regex(7) by command man 7 regex or in English. A regex variable equal to  .  will suffice.\napt-cache search .\n\nThe above will give you ALL the results but it is not in any order that is particularly helpful for browsing.\nSo finally we can sort by dictionary order usingsort -d and show only a page at a time usingless.\napt-cache search . |sort -d |less\n\n\nA: Unfortunately I don't have enough rep to add this a comment on the main answer.\nBut I was trying to find g++- - alike packages with apt-cache search. It's important to know in this case that keyword is a regular expression so apt-cache search g++- will not have helpful results.\napt-cache search \"g[+][+][-]\" would be the way to go\n\nA: apt list <package> is how I recommend searching for packages. If you don't get any matches or if you're not sure what the package is named, try wrapping the argument in asterisks to get more results. For instance apt list *chrome* will yield the following:\nListing...\nchrome-gnome-shell/focal,focal,now 10.1-5 all\nchromium-chromedriver/focal-updates 1:85.0.4183.83-0ubuntu0.20.04.2 amd64\nchromium-lwn4chrome/focal,focal 1.0-3 all\ngoogle-chrome-beta/stable 99.0.4844.17-1 amd64\ngoogle-chrome-stable/stable,now 98.0.4758.80-1 amd64\ngoogle-chrome-unstable/stable 100.0.4867.0-1 amd64\nmkchromecast-alsa/focal,focal 0.3.8.1-1 all\nmkchromecast-gstreamer/focal,focal 0.3.8.1-1 all\nmkchromecast-pulseaudio/focal,focal 0.3.8.1-1 all\nmkchromecast/focal,focal 0.3.8.1-1 all\nnode-chrome-trace-event/focal,focal 1.0.2-1 all\nopenchrome-tool/focal 1:0.6.0-3build1 amd64\npython3-pychromecast/focal,focal 4.1.0-1 all\nruby-chromedriver-helper/focal,focal 2.1.0-7 all\nxserver-xorg-video-openchrome-hwe-18.04/focal 3:14.5 amd64\nxserver-xorg-video-openchrome/focal 1:0.6.0-3build1 amd64\n\nAlternatively, if you'd like a description of each package, run apt search --names-only <package>. Make sure to include --names-only for more accurate results.\n\nA: You can also use aptitude from the command line:\naptitude search xxxxxx\n\n\nA: To search for a particular package by name or description:\nFrom the command-line, use:\napt-cache search keyword\n\nwhere the search keyword can be all or part of a package name or any words used in its description.\nFor example, apt-cache search proxy includes both these packages:\n\ntinyproxy - A lightweight, non-caching, optionally anonymizing HTTP proxy\ntircd - ircd proxy to the twitter API\n\n\nNote: the list may be long, so you can pipe the output to less to make it scrollable one line or one screen at a time, i.e. apt-cache search something | less.\n\nTo get a list of ALL packages\napt-cache search .\n\n\nUse Synaptic if you have X-forwarding enabled or are on a desktop\nSynaptic is often a more convenient way to do this, but requires at least an X server on your end (unless you're running a desktop environment). Install with sudo apt-get install synaptic if necessary.\n\n*\n\n*Synaptic on ssh'd server via X forwarding:\n\n\n\n*Synaptic running locally on Ubuntu Desktop:\n\n\nA: \nThe apt-cache command line tool is used for searching apt software\n  package cache. In simple words, this tool is used to search software\n  packages, collects information of packages and also used to search for\n  what available packages are ready for installation on Debian or Ubuntu\n  based systems.\n\nTo find out the package name and with it description before installing, use the ‘search‘ flag. Using “search” with apt-cache will display a list of matched packages with short description. Let’s say you would like to find out description of package ‘vsftpd‘, then command would be.\n\nSyntax:\napt-cache search SearchTerm\n\n\n$ apt-cache search vsftpd\n\n\nThe possible output would be:\n\nvsftpd - lightweight, efficient FTP server written for security\nccze - A robust, modular log coloriser\nftpd - File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server\nyasat - simple stupid audit tool\n\n\nTo find and list down all the packages starting with ‘vsftpd‘, you\n  could use the following command.\n\n$ apt-cache pkgnames vsftpd\n\n\nYou may also want to run the results through a more, or even a grep.\n  For instance:\n\napt-cache search firefox | grep plugin\n\n\nA: The OP aimed only to apt, which was already answered (apt search). Some people might end up here searching for solutions for other (more modern) alternatives.\nNowadays we have other sources for apps: pip, brew, flatpak and npm, to name a few popular ones. All of them also works with search subcommand.\nYou could handle all of the above and others with meta-package-manager, which solves XKCD #1654 (don't look #927).\n\nA: apt-file search part_of_package_name\n\n\"Extended variant\" is useful in case of excessive number of results:\napt-file search part_of_package_name | grep another_part_of_name\n\nExample of searching for ssh server package if I do not know the name is ssh-server or sshserver or server-ssh etc.:\napt-file search ssh | grep server\n\nSteps to prepare apt-file search for searching.

Then I would like to have a dual boot option so that when I power up the computer, I can choose whether to use Windows XP or Ubuntu. \nIs this possible? If so, how would I do it, that is, arrange it so a dual boot option presents itself on power up.\n\nA: Yes, you can do this easily.\nThe easiest way is to first install Windows on one drive and get it working.  Then, install Ubuntu with that drive present but choose the second hard drive (probably sdb), using the entire drive as one partition (sdb1).  The install will automatically detect the Windows OS on the first drive (sda), and create a dual-boot menu (using GRUB).\n", "Q: Overlay scrollbars disabled on upgrade - how to reenable?

I've purged and reinstalled these packages: overlay-scrollbar, liboverlay-scrollbar-0.2-0, and liboverlay-scrollbar3-0.2-0. That did nothing. I also tried using both Ubuntu Tweak and Unsettings, but both showed that overlay scrollbars were turned on (and turning the settings off and back on again did nothing either). \nAny ideas how to get them back? Thanks!\nEdit: I just read that some people disable them by adding a line in ~/.xprofile or /etc/X11/Xsession.d/99disable-overlay-scrollbars, but those files don't exist.\n\nA: Linuxicle explains how to enable and disable the overlay scrollbar in easy method.\ngsettings reset com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode \n\n\nA: I found a file called 80overlayscrollbars in /etc/X11. Despite the filename, it had the line export LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0, so it was actually disabling them. Since I never changed the defaults, I really wonder why the upgrade process managed to disable them.\n\nA: Try installing dconf Editor from the Ubuntu Software Center. It has an option for enabling/disabling overlay scrollbars.\nThe option is located under the following subfolders(click triangles to open)\norg> gnome> desktop> interface. \nIn the options pane the last item in the list for interface options is\nubuntu-overlay-scrollbars\nwhich has a checkbox.\nClick a checkmark in the box, close dconf, log out/in, and it should work.\nI often switch appearance themes to high contrast and back which seems to lose the scrollbar setting.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu Studio I'm trying to install Ubuntu Studio via USB stick.

For me the problem was that the encoding of the file had changed since it was last opened with Gedit (from WINDOWS-1252 to UTF-8). As I had manually set the encoding when first opening the file, Gedit had saved this information and tried to reuse it the next time I opened the file after the encoding change; this resulted in said error message.\nTo fix the problem, I had to remove the saved encoding information from the gvfs metadata like so:\ngvfs-set-attribute --type unset MY_FILE.txt 'metadata::gedit-encoding'\n\nYou can always find out what Gedit has saved about a particular file:\ngvfs-info MY_FILE.txt | grep 'metadata::gedit'\n\nFor example, before issuing the above command, the output for my file was this:\n  metadata::gedit-encoding: WINDOWS-1252\n  metadata::gedit-position: 0\n  metadata::gedit-spell-language: de_DE\n\nAfter I had removed the encoding attribute, the output was just this:\n  metadata::gedit-position: 0\n  metadata::gedit-spell-language: de_DE\n\n\nA: type this in terminal\ngsettings set org.gnome.gedit.preferences.encodings auto-detected \"['UTF-8', 'CURRENT', 'ISO-8859-15', 'UTF-16']\"\n\n", "Q: What would be a good opensource software for graphing circles, circular regions, and regions bounded by curves and/or arcs? Hullo all. I have just started s job with Chegg, and my 1st assignment has me writign solutions for Stewart's Essential Calculus. I am dealing with the chapter on multiple integration, and need a good open-source software that I can easily use to draw regions (domains) that would require multiple integrals: i.e. circular regions, portions of circles, regions bounded by curves and/or arcs, and at some point 3D pictures. \nIn most of these cases, I am not working with an exact equation or perhaps need to draw the region bounded by r (radius) between 1 and 2, and the angle theta bounded between pi/4 and 3 pi/4. I am not too terribly familiar with programs like Corel Draw, but the documents I have from this company suggest Corel Draw.

I could not  reboot or install form CD ROM or get safe mode.\nNow that I've installed Ubuntu, I am still unable to install my wireless stick USB modem to connect and surf the Internet via provider. I'm using a wireless network from the neighborhood right now.\nI find it difficult to download and install and save programs and applications from the Internet, including Skype and Real Player.\nUbuntu is different form Windows and not that easy to use. I click to download for example and find Real Player but when click on it it opens as a text file only and I cannot use it as it should be used for video and download and record from YouTube.\nHow can I do this? And does Ubuntu have a similar program to those available for Windows, to download/record YouTube videos?\nIs there any trick to recover my Windows operating system? Can I use Linux to recovery the broken Windows system? Can I import my files from the broken Windows 7 system that always bluescreens?\n\nA: To install software in Ubuntu, we prefer to use Ubuntu Software Centre. To open Software Centre, open the dash (press the Windows key or click the Ubuntu logo on the left side of the screen) and search for it.\nSkype is available from the Software Centre. Just search for it, or click here.\nRealPlayer, on the other hand, is not particularly excellent for Ubuntu and it is not available in the Software Centre. Unless you were using some of its more exotic functions you should be fine without it. When you try to open a video or audio file, Ubuntu might offer to install some software to play it. You can get all of that right away if you install Ubuntu restricted extras.\nIf you know you definitely need RealPlayer, this web page has some more information. In essence, RealPlayer is completely unsupported and unmaintained for Ubuntu, but you can download an old version via the Helix Community. You would need to download the 32-bit RPM version of RealPlayer 11, and use a tool called Alien to install that on Ubuntu. Not very pretty, so let's only worry about that if you're sure you need RealPlayer.\nSometimes you can get newer versions of software from other places, such as the Skype website. However, keep in mind that in doing so you will probably not receive automatic security updates. The Software Centre makes this kind of thing much easier. With that said, to download Skype from the Skype website you would need to follow the links to the Skype for Linux page, then choose to download for Ubuntu 32-bit or Ubuntu 64-bit, depending on which version of Ubuntu you have installed. (If you aren't sure, you probably have 32-bit Ubuntu, but you can double check if you open System Settings / Details and look for the \"OS type\" label).\n", "Q: Ubuntu installer asks if I want to install Ubuntu INTO Windows, but that's not what I want! The Ubuntu installer gives 3 options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu INTO Windows.\n\n*Erase everything and install Ubuntu.\n\n*Manually install Ubuntu.\n\n\nWhat happened to the \"resize the Windows partition and setup a dual boot box\" option I remember from the last time I installed Ubuntu?\n\nA: Looks like you're installing from within Windows using Wubi. \nIf you want to dual boot alongside Windows, its always a better idea to create a separate partition and install. Copy the Ubuntu setup on a flash drive/CD and boot using that, follow on-screen instructions and install on separate partition.\n\nA: First, some details –\nAre you installing from within Windows (using Wubi)? If not, which install media are you using (LiveCD, LiveUSB, or text-based)? Wubi is unable to install over the entire hard drive, but it doesn't sound like that's what you're using.\nThere should not be an \"Install into Windows\" option. Can you provide a picture or at least the exact text of that option?\nThe three options that should be available to you are \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows,\" \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu,\" and \"Something else.\" If you want to manually repartition the hard drive, the third option is your way to go. Otherwise, the alongside option ought to do it all for you automatically.\n\nA: Here's what I have learned:\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu installer (at least for option 1) says different stuff depending on what state your HDDs are in.\nI didn't know that. To say the least I was confused. Is this written down anywhere? From the advice people are giving out, I'm thinking this IS NOT common knowledge.\n\n\n*If (I'm guessing) there is no space left on the HDD for a new partition, the Ubuntu installer will only give you the options to install Ubuntu INSIDE the Windows partition using something called WUBI (I think).\nHowever, this might also be because there were already 4 (maximum number) of partitions on the HDD. My guess is that if there were only 3 primary partitions, and they filled the HDD, that the installer would have given me the option I wanted. That is to resize one of the partitions in order to make room for Ubuntu.\nSo what I ended up doing is backing up and deleting one of the existing partitions. This was on a brand new laptop. Before using the Ubuntu Live CD, I used gparted and resized the Windows partition to half it's original size. I'm thinking the Ubuntu installer might have been able to do this as well. Then option 1 of the Ubuntu installer offered to \"install Ubuntu along side of Windows\" instead of \"into Windows\".\nHope this help anyone who stumbles upon my original question.\n", "Q: Clicking links in pdfs opened with Okular opens Abiword (instead of the default browser) I work with Xubuntu 12.04 and use Okular (version 0.14.3) to view pdf files.

I want to install Ubuntu along with Windows 7 64-bit. I ran the Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop installation CD, but the Ubuntu installer doesn't show the \"along with Windows 7 option\" -- it is only showing two options.\nI read some questions and answers posted on this community, then focussed on Ubuntu 12.04 installer does not see Windows already installed on my computer.\nI tried the following things,\n\n*\n\n*I ran the terminal in live CD and tried sudo dmraid -rE command and dmraid remove command, but the terminal says that there are no dmraid partitions.\n\n\n*Then I tried another scenario and checked my partitions with GParted. There are some partitions labelled C, HP tools, Recovery and System. C contains Windows 7 files.\n\n\n*So I shrank the volume of the C Drive.\n\n\n*Now I have 50000MB of unallocated disk space. I tried with GParted to create a partition on that allocated space. It says something like \"you can't create more than four primary partitions\". Of course, all four other partitions created on Windows are actually the type of the  primary partition.\n\n\n*So I went back to Windows 7 and tried to create a new volume on the unallocated space. Unfortunately, it says that if I create a new volume, it will be the type of Dynamic partition. It says we can't boot another OS from that partition, so I cancelled that step.\nNow I have 50000MB of unallocated space, but how can I install Ubuntu on that partition without harming the existing Windows 7? Because I still have only two options:\n\n*\n\n*Erase and install Ubuntu.\n\n*Try something else.\n\n(I can see my unallocated space by going to \"something else\" option.)\n\nA: I have just lived through this!\nConsider what I have done as an unfinished test. I don't really know (and may never need to know) if what I did will work for me in all situations.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*I created the HP/Win7 back up DVDs.  I think you will need 5 DVDs to do this. There were 4 primary partitions on my HP HDD.  I think they were the BOOT(small), MAIN(huge), BACKUP(not big) & HPTOOLS(small) partitions.  I am lead to believe that the software to create the DVDs is in the HPTOOLS partition.  And that the DVDs are a copy of the BACKUP partition.  But I could be wrong about that last point.  Regardless, HP will only let you create (at least they say so when you do the backup) 1 set of DVDs per laptop.  By all means do this.  It only costs you your time and 5 DVD.\n\n*At this point I felt I could do away with either the BACKUP partition or the HPTOOLS partition.  I chose to delete the HPTOOLS partition even though the placement of the undeleted BACKUP partition meant I would not be able to use about 5% of the HDD.  As an added precaution, I did a disk dump of the HPTOOLS partition to an ordinary file in the Win7 partition. The \"dd\" (disk dump) application is an old Unix command.  I was booted up in the Ubuntu Live CD under \"try it\" when doing this backup.\n\n*After the precautionary \"dd\" I deleted the HPTOOLS partition.  I believe this was primary partition number 4 (of 1 to 4).\n\n*While booted up in Win7 you should probably run the de-fragmentation application on your Win7 partition.  Make sure the disk is empty enough to be shrunk to the desired size.\n\n*I used gparted to shrink my Windows 7 partition. The Ubuntu installer might be able to do this as well.\n\n*Now the Ubuntu installer should offer up the option of installing Ubuntu \"alongside\" Win7.  Before, with 4 primary partitions already on the HDD, the Ubuntu installer only offered me to install Ubuntu \"into\" the Win7 partition.\nThat got me to being able to dual boot my new HP laptop.\n\nA: Try to save the HP Tools on a USB Pen (copy the programs to the USB pen and try to run them from the pen, to see if they are still working) and then delete the HP Tools partition. That way you will have more space unallocated and you'll be able to create your Ubuntu partition.\n\nA: So you have 4 partitions. You should have one extended partition and three primary to make this work...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning#PC_partition_types\n\nThe total data storage space of a PC hard disk can be divided into at most four primary partitions, or alternatively three primary partitions and an extended partition. These partitions are described by 16-byte entries that constitute the Partition Table, located in the master boot record.\n\nYou can then have two sub divisions in the extended partitions. One of these can be your 50GB partition, and are called logical partitions in the extended. Now you have have 5 partitions. I have this and it works fine.\nThen you can let ubuntu do it's business.  \n|Partition1|Partition2|Partition3{ExtendedPartition|4|5|} for example.\n", "Q: Is there a way to disable a laptop's internal keyboard?

I try opening WinX DVD Ripper and a couple other programs in Ubuntu 12.04 and once I select/click on the program I get sent to my desktop and nothing happens at all. I replaced Windows 7 with Ubuntu 12.04 and removed any and all Microsoft files I could find on my system. Is that possibly the reason I can not run these programs?\n\nA: WinX DVD Ripper is, as the name implies, Windows software. Ubuntu, as a Linux distribution, does not run Windows software. It is possible to install a Windows compatibility layer, Wine, which may help some of the software to work.\nIn general, it's better to install native Linux software though. Wine does not always provide full compatibility with Windows software, or the best performance.\nFor DVD ripping, I would personally recommend Handbrake, as this has been the easiest program for me. Handbrake is not available in the main Ubuntu repository, so I would refer you to this article on how to install it from a Personal Package Archive, or PPA.\nhttp://www.thepowerbase.com/2012/03/install-handbrake-in-ubuntu-12-04/\n", "Q: How to set application name when creating .deb, using Quickly When I open created .deb package , my application name is UNKNOWN .

I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 (64) which are technically compatible with GPT but for windows only if the firmware is UEFI enabled. My system uses the old BIOS system and does not support UEFI. Therefore, whenever I finish my Ubuntu install and try to install Windows I get a \"cannot install to GPT partition type\" error. \nEven if I use Gparted to format a special NTFS file format for windows it can't handle the GPT partition style because it doesn't have UEFI. But my ubuntu install always forces GPT during installation and never asks if I want to install the old BIOS style MBR instead. \nHow do I resolve this? Both OS's will install fine on their own the problem is when I try to install the second OS it doesn't recognize any of the other's partitions and tries to rewrite it's own on top of the other. I've tried both OS's first and always run into the same problem. Since there is no way to make Windows recognize GPT without upgrading my Motherboard how do I tell Ubuntu to use the old BIOS MBR on install?\nDo I have to download a special Ubuntu with a specific grub version? or should I manaually configure my partition somehow to force it not to use GPT? \nThank you,\n\nA: You are making a mistake somewhere.

There, replace quiet splash with nomodeset and press Enter.\n\nA: The first thing you should do is install Windows: During the installation, use the Windows CD to create a partition for windows and leave some unpartitioned / free space for Linux.\nFor example, on a 500GB HD, you could use 100 GB for a first windows partition and leave 400G of unpartitioned space.\nAccording to what you said about your mother board, using the Windows CD to partition will automatically create an MBR partition.\nAfter Windows is installed and working, boot with the Ubuntu CD and use GParted to create the necessary partition to receive Ubuntu.\nUbuntu (like Debian), can be installed in both kinds of partitioning systems, GPT and MBR. So no problem, just use GParted to add another partition. But pay attention not to touch the already created first partition (the one you created during the Windows install).\nFor example you could create an second partition type ext3 of 100G for your Ubuntu install, (there should remain 300GB of unpartitioned space on the disk). \nAnd go on with the Ubuntu install. If you do everything correctly you will end with a dual boot HD install (Windows/Ubuntu).

Near the end, two conflicting messages appeared: \"too many errors\" and there was also a message telling me that the system was upgraded nonetheless. The only option I was presented at that point was to reboot, which I did, but the reboot just hanged. Then I tried to boot under \"recovery mode\" but the system gets into an infinite loop with the message. So I tried to re install from 10.10, which went OK, including updates.

As far as I know, it has nothing to do with the graphics card. To fix this, you need to have a bootable Ubuntu Live USB or Live CD. Once you have booted into Ubuntu from the Live CD/USB, run the following command in the Terminal: sudo apt-get install gparted. After you have installed Gparted, open it up from the Dash, and select your hard drive from the top right-hand corner of Gparted. \n\nYour screen should look something like the image above. You need to locate the partition that you have installed Ubuntu on. The filesystem of the partition should be ext3. In the image above, the partition Ubuntu is installed on would be /dev/sda3, because the filesystem is ext3. Now the you have found the partition that you have Ubuntu installed on, you need to run the commands below in the Terminal. Make sure to replace /dev/sda1 with the Ubuntu partition you saw in Gparted.\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/myroot\nsudo mount ‐‐bind /dev /mnt/myroot/dev\nsudo mount ‐‐bind /proc /mnt/myroot/proc\nsudo mount ‐‐bind /sys /mnt/myroot/sys\nsudo chroot /mnt/myroot\nNow, run apt-get install -f.

But I need to use it in scenarios where the bug is still there.\nSo the solution is to bundle a custom zenity executable. But how can I override the zenity command with my custom one in the script?\n\nA: To use the custom zenity executable instead of the system default, we can place it in a directory and add the directory to the PATH.\nSay I placed the executable in a directory $bindir.\nThen I can add $bindir to the PATH variable.\nexport PATH=\"$bindir:$PATH\"\n\nNote that we need to add $bindir before $PATH, else it won't override the system executable. Because in PATH, the executable coming before is given more priority.\n\nA: Call it with the full path such as\n/opt/myapp/bin/zenity\n\nif your version of zenity is installed in /opt/myapp/bin/.\nYou may want to use a variable for this, for example\nZENITY=/opt/myapp/bin/zenity\n...\n$ZENITY --question --text 'Reboot universe?'\n\n", "Q: How to use static IP with Wicd wireless?

I used XAMPP for local dev work.

Tip: checkout on github there are more demos with other/no authorization handlers. Performance wise this python based server is not that bad if compared to vsftpd\n\nA: You can use vsftpd to set up a local FTP server. Install it using\nsudo apt install vsftpd\n\nConfiguration\nIn your case, you'll have to update the config to allow users to log in to their home directories, by adding/uncommenting the following lines in /etc/vsftpd.conf:\nchroot_local_user=YES\nallow_writeable_chroot=YES\n\n\n⚠ Warning: This will allow any system user to sign in via FTP and use their username/and password to read and modify files.

You can probably edit /etc/vsftpd.conf to fine-tune these permissions (I don't know it well enough to instruct you).\nHowever, I would suggest disabling the vsftpd server when you are not using. This can be done with the following command:\nsudo systemctl disable vsftpd\n\nThis will prevent vsftpd from starting automatically on boot. You can then manually start it using\nsudo systemctl start vsftpd\n\nand stop it again when you're done using it\nsudo systemctl stop vsftpd\n\nThis will stop the vsftpd server and disable all FTP connections until you start it again.\n", "Q: How do I remove non-functional links from the Dash?

And can I migrate my settings easily? I chose to do the Wubi install because it was short, simple, and easy to reverse (no messing with partitions required). To be honest, I can handle the lack of a hibernate function.\nI haven't really heard many other benefits of installing on a separate partition than hibernation and negligibly faster hard disk read/write. Yet almost everyone I encounter seems to have opted for the disk installation. Are there more benefits I should be aware of, especially as a college student who wants a fast, efficient machine for documents, web browsing, etc. (nothing big like gaming, I can run that on Windows)?\nAlso, I have a fair amount of settings and packages installed that I spent a bit of time on and would rather not have to do again. Is there any way I can migrate all of these settings from the virtual disk on my C:/ drive (Wubi installation) to the disc installation in another partition? (I have a 16GB USB drive if that'll do the trick)\n\nA: Wubi doesn't change or alter your partitions, it installs to a virtual partition (a file) on the Windows file system.  This is good if you just want to try out Ubuntu, and it's easy to uninstall.\nIf you want a normal dual boot then you can use the Ubuntu CD/USB to partition during the installation. If you have Window Vista/7 then I would create the free space first, before attempting to install Ubuntu.\nIf your intention is to test Ubuntu, the you can boot from an Ubuntu CD/USB in live mode, and select Try Ubuntu, just to make sure that it's compatible or to see if you need any special drivers for your hardware.\nAdvantages\n\n\n*\n\n*Wubi is easy for Windows users with basic computer skills\n\n*Its convenience\n\n*No need to burn a CD or create a USB Installer\n\n*It installs like any other windows application\n\n*It can easily be uninstalled from control panel.\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\n\n*\n\n*The system will run slightly slower than it would on a true\npartition\n\n*The difference in speed will be especially noticable if your system is old\n\n*Data accessibility of other partitions when using Ubuntu\n\n*Anything happens to Windows can affect Ubuntu as well\n\n\nA: Wubi isn't virtualized. It's simply an alternative bootloader solution. It works by using a special bootloader that can be chained from NTLDR or BOOTLDR. From there, it loads the Linux kernel and a modified initrd (initial ramdisk) containing FUSE and ntfs-3g into RAM. The initial ramdisk's boot scripts will use ntfs-3g to mount your Windows partition, find the Ubuntu virtual partition and then loop-mount it. It'll then use the 'bind' option to remount the NTFS partition under the newly-mounted virtual partition's /host, perform a chroot to the virtual partition, and then exec() the /sbin/init or whichever therein. \nNone of which requires virtualization, nor is any of it a new technique. Ten years ago ago, DragonLinux (based on Slackware) supported essentially the same virtual partition technique, but instead using LOADLIN through DOS. It also supported simply installing into a subdirectory on a FAT partition, where special hidden files were used to store POSIX attributes (This was called \"umsdos\" filesystem, and was removed from the kernel in 2.6.11)\nAlso, depending on the condition of your NTFS partition (number of files, fragmentation, other factors), your performance hit may be slight, or it might be quite dramatic. In the worse case, a Wubi install may only yield disk performance equal to 5% of an install into a native partition (but your chances of experiencing such horrid performance are next to none.)\n\nA: I'm not sure about migrating your setting, as I have never done that and haven't used WUBI in a long time... However, benefits of a disk install include using more space. From what I remember, you can only use a certain amount of hard drive space, of course- because Windows would be on there, but in addition, I think it is limited even further.\nNot to mention Wubi is still a form of virtualization, and I don't believe you have full access to your hardware (i.e. I think it limits RAM and VRAM, etc). \nWUBI would be good to try out to see the difference... But if you are worried about migrating settings, just don't change the OS that much so you won't have to repeat everything again if you decide to partition and do a disk install.\n", "Q: Where is the directory for your web contents  using LAMP?

'adduser  phil sudo'\nYou should now see a message saying 'adding user' followed by 'done'.\nType shutdown -r now to restart the computer.\nEDIT: If it is telling you that user xxx does not exist, first you can use the following command to list users and make sure that you have the correct username  \nls /home\n\nThe other option is add a new user, from recovery mode using the following commands : \nuseradd username -m -s /bin/bash  \npasswd username\nadduser username sudo\n\nAgain replacing username with your desired username.\n\nA: You can use the recovery console and boot as root this is a extra option on your grub menu and create a new user then add them to the admin group.  I'm not sure if this will fix your issue, but give it a try and let me know.\nuseradd newuser\nadduser newuser admin\n\n\nA: I had the same problem \nSelect recovery mode (if you are using laptop it differents but it's in the same place you get in bios)\nThen select root \nWrite the command(# adduser )\nThen the command(# password root)\nAnd write the new password\nAnd restart by the command( #reboot) \n", "Q: How do I sort Firefox bookmarks alphabetically by manipulating the 'json' or 'places.sqlite' files via the terminal? is there a way possible with terminal pipelining to sort the bookmarks Mozilla Firefoxstores in alphabetical order?\nI tried dabbing a little but to my disappointment ,the bookmarks are stored in JSON format ,how do you extract things from that ?\n\nA: If you simply want to sort the bookmarks in Firefox alphabetically, it's very easy to do and no command-line magic is necessary.\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Shift+O (<--letter O) to open the Bookmarks Library.\n\n\n*Navigate to the folder you want to sort, right-click on it and click on \"Sort by Name\":\n\n\n\n*Those bookmarks will be sorted alphabetically. Notice the before/after difference:\n\n\nA: If you state what your final goal is, you will get better answers. You can get a somewhat clean list of sorted URLs from a JSON file with something like:\nsed 's/,/\\n/g' bookmarks-2012-07-07.json | grep '\"uri\"' | grep http | cut -d '\"' -f 4 | sort\n\nYour most powerful option is to utilize sqlite3 to get the bookmarks from the file places.sqlite from your home directory.\n", "Q: Is there any software to create doodles like doodlinator for windows 8? I need a software to create doodle animations just like the doodleinator in windows 8 which is very easy to use. Please give some suggestions.

It seems a minor problem, because I only have to press the brightening key on may keyboard to cast some light. But every single time I reboot, the dark screen returns. is there a workaround for this?\n\nA: This is a known bug. If you have a Launchpad account, mark it as affecting you to increase its heat, and thereby its likelihood of attracting developer interest.\nIn the meantime, a possible workaround might be to use a display manager other than LightDM, since the bug appears to have appeared at the same time as LightDM became the default.\nTo instead use GNOME Display Manager (which used to be the default), run sudo apt-get install gdm. After the installation completes, a warning about having multiple display managers installed will appear, followed by a dialog asking which you want to use:\n\n\nObviously, you should choose gdm.\nTo restore LightDM, run sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm to trigger the above dialog to reappear. This time, choose lightdm instead.\n", "Q: How do I install make? /usr/bin/perl install-module.pl --all\nERROR: Using install-module.pl requires that you install \"make\".\n\nI need to install make on my ubuntu on AWS EC2. How can I do that ?\nI could finally install build-essential also successfully.\n# make\nmake: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.\n\n\nA: sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y install make\n(-y = answer 'yes' to any prompts)\nCheck the installed version:\nmake -v\n\nA: It definitely looks like make is installed on your box. The reply you are getting is actually an error generated by make, complaining that it can't file the Makefile (which would tell it what needs to be done)\nIs there any Makefile.pl in the module you are trying to install? If so, try:\n$ perl Makefile.pl\n$ make\n\n\nA: Run the command:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nChances are you will need things like gcc to actually do the building so you might as well install those as well. The build-essential package will install other tools used along with make.\n\nA: As tuxpiper says, make is already installed. What reveals this is the \"No targets specified and no makefile found\" message, which is produced by make itself.1\ninstall-module.pl is an installation script that is part of Bugzilla. There isn't enough information in the question to be entirely certain that Bugzilla is what's being installed--perhaps there is other software that ships with a script by that name--but the exact problem described here is one that people have had while installing Bugzilla.\nThe problem in this situation is that, behind the scenes, install-module.pl uses cpan (a Perl package manager) which doesn't find and use make even though it is installed.\n3h4x has given a solution to this. You can help cpan find make by running\ncpan\n\nto enter the cpan shell, and then running the CPAN commands:\no conf make '/usr/bin/make'\no conf commit\n\nSource: This answer, by 3h4x, to Bugzilla install-module.pl can't find “make” but it's installed and in my path\nNote that the module being referred to here in the script name is a Perl module, and not any other kind of module such as a kernel module. So if you did not already have make and the other necessary development tools, installing build-essential should be sufficient to provide them, though it doesn't substitute for configuring cpan if necessary.\nThis question is old and the problem may no longer be common. So I suggest that users installing Bugzilla on newer Ubuntu systems not run those cpan commands until they have actually observed the problem with make not being found even though it's installed.\n1 I've posted about this before, apparently. I had forgotten about that when I wrote this answer. But it turns out this answer is a bit different. For now I'll keep this answer, which addresses the broader issues like what software this applies to, what kind of modules are being referred to, and how readers shouldn't assume they'll have this problem today. But I've made it community-wiki so other people can edit it more easily and so I don't generate reputation from it.\n", "Q: Desktop recording software with keypressing hints I am looking for a desktop recording application like democreator, which can automatically create tool tips of the input key pressed in the video being recorded. For example, when I press Alt+Tab, it will create a tooltip like \"Entered Alt+Tab\" and so on. \nThe Question is: Is there something equivalent to that for Ubuntu? I don't want to use Windows software via Wine.\nUpdate: One answerer mentions keymon. Thanks. But it was not what I was looking for. Keymon runs on the screen blocking some area, and I wanted a tooltip like feature to be displayed in the video only.\n\nA: I use key-mon with recordmydesktop.\nsudo apt install keymon\n\nOr maybe Screenkey, initially based on the key-mon project. You can install Screenkey with\nsudo apt install screenkey\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu boots to terminal on start up For a long time I've been unable to get updates due to a \"repositories not found\" error.

Out of curiosity, I enabled the accessibility options for people who are hard of sight. As you can guess this does the usual stuff of inverting colours, increasing text size and making the cursor larger. \nHaving finished the installation I booted into the new system to find accessibility mode was still installed. From the lightdm login screen I disabled this which switched colours and text size back to default, however it's only the pointer cursor that has gone back to default.\nTo put it another way, the \"hand\" icon that you get when hovering over a link, the cursor which appears when typing and pretty much every other cursor on the system are still large. \nI've looked on the Universal Access menu, but there's no option to disable large cursors.\nI've tried toggling accessibility on and off but to no avail.\n\nA: Try removing the accessibility options.\nOpen software center\nsearch universal access\nclick remove\nThen reboot your PC, if this works you can use the same method to re-install.\n\nA: In the end I had to reinstall :/\n", "Q: Flash plug-in crashes about 50% of the time Like the title says, my Flash plugin keeps crashing.\nIt happens on videos on many sites like YouTube. (I joined the html5 beta at YouTube to sort that out, but that doesn't fix other sites.) The crash seems to occur on any site using Adobe Flash, and is becoming very annoying.\nI'm using 12.04 with Firefox and used the flash-helper plug-in as well but the same result.\n\nA: I do not know the solution, but will attempt to offer suggestions:\nI would mention that I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with various Firefox installs and they are not Crashing, so there is a good possibility that your problem is more specific to your own setup,rather than being a generalized problem.\nYou may find some of the suggestions in a Firefox Knowledge Base article are useful:\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keep-flash-up-to-date-and-troubleshoot-problems#w_the-adobe-flash-plugin-has-crashed\nIs it a crash ?\nNote that if it is a crash, (then unless you are on Aurora/Nightly) Firefox will offer to send crash reports, and allow you to obtain Crash IDs. Those are useful for tracking specific reasons for Crashes.\nThis part of the answer is even more general, but may still help.\nIt has already been mentioned by \"Daniel\" that Adobe is not supporting Flash properly on Ubuntu. One effect of this is that Ubuntu users do not have the Latest FlashPlayer release as is used by and causing problems on Firefox Windows systems\nSo one thing you need NOT worry about are the Firefox issues with Flash 11.3\nThere will be; what is to Ubuntu users; a lot of noise on the internet relating to these issues and I am aware developers from Flash, Firefox & RealPlayer are involved. (RealPlayer have made a new release which Firefox promptly blocklisted again - soft black I presume - confirmation will be here )\nSorry for posting links but your question is at present rather general, so a general troubleshooting link seems best (There should be no link rot problem, mozilla normally archives rather than deletes Firefox KB articles, or if they are renamed or puts in suitable redirects).\nPost back when you have more details and have tried read the linked articles and maybe someone will be able to offer a more specific answer. \n\nA: I found that editing /etc/adobe/mms.cfg solved my problem, just as the some of those in the link above did.\nFirst, open the file for editing, which will create it for your if it didn't exist already:\nsudo gedit /etc/adobe/mms.cfg\n\nThen, enter the following line exactly as you see here:\nOverrideGPUValidation=true\n\nSave the file, close gedit, and restart your browser.

Aborting operation\", return code -115)? I have a machine running Precise (12.04 x64), and I cannot mount my SMB drives.  It used to work (a week or two ago) and I didn't touch fstab!  The machine hosting the shares is a commercial NAS, and I'm not seeing anything that would indicate it's an issue with the NAS.\nI have an older machine which I updated to Precise at the same time (both fresh installed, not dist-upgrade), so should have a very similar configuration.  It is not having any problems.  I am not having problems on windows machines/partitions either, only one of my Precise machines.\nThe two machines are using identical entries in fstab and identical /etc/samba/smb.conf files.  I don't think I've ever changed smb.conf (has never mattered before).\nMy fstab entries all basically look like this:\n//<share_path>       /media/<share_name>        cifs  credentials=/home/downbeat/.credentials,iocharset=utf8,uid=downbeat,gid=downbeat,file_mode=0644,dir_mode=0755 0 0\n\nHere's the dmesg output on boot:\n[   51.162198] CIFS VFS: Error connecting to socket.

Very similarly configured machine works (but some packages are out of date on the working machine).  The NAS has only one interface/IP address, nmblookup works to find it's IP from it's hostname (from the machine with the issue) and it responds to a ping.  Please any help would be great.\n\nA: I found that switching off IPv6 solved a very similar problem for me. My Ubuntu 12.04 box is hooked up to an enterprise network dominated by Windows users and I don't have any authority over the server. Following the tutorial at\n   http://www.noobslab.com/2012/05/disable-ipv6-if-your-internet-is.html\nsolved my problem. (Save a click: Edit /etc/sysctl.conf to insert three lines of the form \"net.ipv6.conf.*.disable_ipv6 = 1\", replacing * with \"all\", \"lo\", and \"default\"; then give the shell command \"sudo sysctl -p\".)\n\nA: My internal IP ended up in my NAS's blocklist.  I removed it; problem solved.  Used smbclient to troubleshoot.\nEDIT: I am much more familiar with GNU/Linux these days, and if I were attempting to debug this today, I would check out hosts.deny and iptables, one of which (or both) is likely used to implement the blocklist/blacklist in my now decommissioned commercial NAS.\n\nA: In my case, the Windows machine I was trying to mount a shared drive from had suddenly decided it was on a public network, and was blocking all access.

Try replacing semicolons in the -cp parameter with colons. Or alternately, since the default Java install in Ubuntu is Java 6, the wildcard form for the -cp parameter will work - pass the folder containing the jar files, with a /* at the end. You'll have to enclose that in single quotes so that the shell doesn't expand it.\n\nA: From this link:  \n3 ways to resolve NoClassDefFoundError in Java\n1\nClass is not available in Java Classpath ( How to Set Classpath for Java on Windows Unix and Linux ).\n2\nYou might be running your program using jar command and class was not defined in manifest file's ClassPath attribute.\n3\nAny startup script is overriding Classpath environment variable.\n", "Q: Chromium input fields lag Every time I have to insert text into a text field in chromium insertion lags, it stops working for a second and I don't see the text I'm typing (the cursor doesn't move).

I can even play 3D games for 5-30 minutes.\nIf I use the Live CD and fglrx isn't installed (it uses Mesa driver then) how can I control the fan?\n\nA: *\n\n*First I advise you to update your kernel, because based on this link, updating the kernel solves the heating problem. A guide to update your kernel maybe found in this question\n\n*Install shell-extension-radeon-power-profile-manager\n\n*If the problem persist we will try to create a profile for low power GPU:\nBased on this XOrg link\nThe Power Management code supports two basic methods:\n\"dynpm\"\n\"profile\" \n\nYou can select the methods via sysfs. Echo \"dynpm\" or \"profile\" to /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method. \nsudo echo profile >  /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method\n\nControlling the fan speed directly is not possible (and would be very dangerous), but it can be lowered by setting lower power profile\nThe \"dynpm\" method dynamically changes the clocks based on the number of pending fences, so performance is ramped up when running GPU intensive apps, and ramped down when the GPU is idle. The reclocking is attemped during vertical blanking periods, but due to the timing of the reclocking functions, doesn't not always complete in the blanking period, which can lead to flicker in the display. Due to this, dynpm only works when a single head is active. \nThe \"profile\" method exposes five profiles that can be selected from:\n\"default\"\n\"auto\"\n\"low\"\n\"mid\"\n\"high\" \n\nSelect the profile by echoing the selected profile to /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile. \n\n\n*\n\n*\"default\" uses the default clocks and does not change the power state. This is the default behavior.\n\n*\"auto\" selects between \"mid\" and \"high\" power states based on the whether the system is on battery power or not. The \"low\" power state are selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.\n\n*\"low\" forces the gpu to be in the low power state all the time. Note that \"low\" can cause display problems on some laptops; this is why auto does not use \"low\" when displays are active.\n\n*\"mid\" forces the gpu to be in the \"mid\" power state all the time. The \"low\" power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.\n\n*\"high\" forces the gpu to be in the \"high\" power state all the time. The \"low\" power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state. \n\n\nThus, to select low profile:\nsudo bash -c \"echo profile > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method\"\nsudo bash -c \"echo low > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile\"\n\n\nA: Try these commands\nsudo -i \necho low >  /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile\nexit\n\nwait few seconds and check again the temperature. \nAbove command will pass the low profile so the temperature will fall down as the fan as well.\nIf you want to use this in an installed system you can pass the command in every boot through rc.local\nsudo sed '/^[^#]*exit 0/i echo low >  /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile' -i /etc/rc.local\n\nThanks\n\nA: Does this problem only occur in Ubuntu? I would first check if there isn't some other cause of the overheating issue. First check if your PC and videocard is free of dust clogging up the fans. If needed, clean with a (static free) brush or a can of compressed air. Also make sure you use the FGLRX drivers. They tend to work a lot better with regulating the temperature.\n\nA: Necro-bumping here, but this issue has seen an important development with kernel 3.11 (used in Saucy/13.10).\nIf the radeon/ATI libre driver is indeed concerned by OP's question (and I believe it is, based on the accepted answer), then it should be mentionned that 3.11 introduces  the dpm (Dynamic Power Management) method, which \"should greatly help power consumption, especially when idle\". (source: RadeonDriver Ubuntu Community Wiki)\nMore specifically, \"dpm\" mode\n\nuses hardware on the GPU to dynamically change the clocks and voltage based on GPU load. It also enables clock and power gating.\n\nNote however that it is only supported on R6xx and newer asics (what includes OP's HD 3650 card). Sources : X.org RadeonFeature/KMS Power Management Options, and RadeonDriver Ubuntu Community Wiki for a matrix of cards commercial/development names.\nHow to use it\nTo enable it, you just have to edit /etc/default/grub and add radeon.dpm=1 to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line, so it would look something like:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash radeon.dpm=1\"\n\nAfter you save/quit the text editor, update grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nModes\nThere are 3 operation modes to choose from:\n\n\n*\n\n*battery: lowest power consumption\n\n*balanced: sane default\n\n*performance: highest performance\n\n\nThey can be changed via sysfs:\necho battery > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_state\n\n(source : Archlinux wiki)\nTips if you use GNOME Shell\nThere is a GNOME Shell extension (forked from the previously mentioned one by StuntsPT) that implements support for dpm modes management : you can find it here. To use it, simply download the master zip file (direct link) and use Tweak Tool to install AND enable it. Alternatively, extract the extension folder and put it in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions. The extension will then show up in Tweak tool which you can use to enable the extension. If it doesn't appear in the top panel, try to restart the shell with Alt+F2 r (enter).\n", "Q: How can I find out the file path for my laptop's dvd drive Normally I insert a DVD in the drive and I get a prompt that leads me to the movie player app and all is well.

As bash_profile runs before bashrc is picked up, if you don't have a source command in bash_profile, bashrc won't run.\nThere are two ways to tackle this, either delete bash_profile or if you use bash_profile, just add the following line anywhere in the file\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: It isn't necessarily run; at the top of the standard .bashrc is this comment:\n# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.\n# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)\n# for examples\n\nI believe there is an option to run bash terminal as a login shell or not.  With Ubuntu, gnome-terminal does not normally run as a login shell, so .bashrc should be run directly.  \nFor login shells (like the virtual terminals), normally the file ~/.profile is run, unless you have either ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login, but they are not there by default.  By default, Ubuntu uses only .profile.\nThe standard ~/.profile has this in it:\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n    # include .bashrc if it exists\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n        . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n    fi\nfi\n\nThis runs .bashrc if it is available - assuming $BASH_VERSION is present in your environment.  You can check for this by entering the command echo $BASH_VERSION, and it should display some information on version number - it should not be blank.\n\nA: .bash_profile holds configuration for the bash shell. When you open a terminal, it first reads and executes commands from ~/.bash_profile. So you can add the following in .bash_profile to setup the shell according to bashrc.\n. ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.x in order for the .bashrc to be read when a terminal is opened, you should copy the template .profile into the user directory (.bashrc is loaded from .profile):\nsudo cp /etc/skel/.profile ~/.profile && sudo chown $(whoami):$(whoami) ~/.profile\n\n", "Q: How do I correct items that are now upstart jobs but still have an entry in /etc/init.d? How do I correct items that are now upstart jobs but still have an entry in /etc/init.d? I have an ubuntu 12.04 machine which complains in the boot.log file like:\n\nSince the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an\n  Upstart job, you may also use the start(8) utility, e.g. start\n  S01dmesg Rather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d, use\n  the service(8) utility, e.g. service S01hostname start\n\nHow do I fix these seemingly broken services?\n\nA: The services are not broken, the reason that they still have an entry in /etc/init.d/ is for backwards compatibility. If you take a look at those scripts in /etc/init.d/ you will see they get symlinked to /lib/init/upstart-job. /lib/init/upstart-job prints that message and then processes the request (starting/stopping the service). The reason you are getting that message is because something else is still trying to call /etc/init.d/ rather than the proper upstart way.\nTo resolve this, you need to track down what is using the old method, and fix it to use the new upstart method.\n", "Q: Path for source files Where should I add source files for my program? I created a folder /data/src and put the files there. In my Python code I tried to point with os.getcwd() to it. This works for quickly run but if I install my application it gives me an IOEroor for home/username/myapp/data/src. How I can ajust the username?\nThanks\n\nA: Even if you were able to get the os.getcwd() approach to work, it would probably break when you run the program installed. If you look in the program_name_lib directory, you'll see that quickly provides some convenience functions for you. The easiest way to do what you want is to put the text file in data/media and use the get_media_file() helper. Like so:\nfrom program_name_lib.helpers import get_media_file\ntext_file = get_media_file(\"my_file.txt\")\n\n\nA: Without knowing details, it appears that it expects the directory data/src to be in you home directory, under your program name, and not in the root.  Did you really put it in /data/src?  Normally, I think it would go somewhere in your home directory, which you own and have full permissions.  You can, of course, change this and put it where you want, but it's usually best not to put things in the root directory.\n", "Q: Is there a Google Drive client available?

This is preferable in my opinion over the google-docs-fs solution, since that doesn't put your files permanently on your drive, and grive does.

It works with a variety of cloud-based storage solutions, and is fairly easy to script with.  Examples below.\nIncrementally backup \"/path/to/local folder 1\" to \"/someremotefolder/folder 1\" on Google Drive.  Additional commands can be added to backup additional folders.\n#!/bin/bash\nrclone sync \"/path/to/local folder 1\" \"drive:/someremotefolder/folder 1\" -v\n\nRestore the remote copy, incrementally overwriting the local copy.\n#!/bin/bash\nrclone sync \"drive:/someremotefolder/folder 1\" \"/path/to/local folder 1\"\n\nYou can also transfer files between different remote folders and cloud storage solutions using the appropriate syntax for those media.  The online documentation and man page are pretty easy to follow.

It's quite similar though: also written in Go, and a comparable feature set, but different command line parameters.\nTo install and use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the binary. Choose the one that fits your architecture, for example gdrive-linux-x64.\n\n*Copy it to your path.\nsudo cp gdrive-linux-x64 /usr/local/bin/gdrive;\nsudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/gdrive;\n\n\n*To use it for downloading a file:\ngdrive download 0B7_OwkDsUIgFWXA1B2FPQfV5S8H\n\nOf course, use your own file ID instead of the 0B7_Ow[…] argument. You find it in the URL when opening your files in the Google Drive web interface, or right-clicking them and clicking \"Get sharable link …\". In the latter case, remember to turn off link-sharing again if you don't want others to access the file when they get the link.\nAt first use, the tool will need to obtain access permissions to the Google Drive API. For that, it will show you a link which you have to visit in a browser, and then you will get a verification code to copy&paste back to the tool. The download then starts automatically. There is no progress indicator, but you can observe the progress in a file manager or second terminal.\n\nA: You can use nice russian service Yandex Disk that have WebDav and free 10 gb and official command-line sync client.

I have the following situation:\nMy current Ubuntu (12.04) installation is running from an external HDD (250 GB) because I was to lazy to buy an new internal hdd. Now i've got a new internal (120GB) and i want to move everything to the internal. Installing Ubuntu new is out of disscussion because its to peronalized.\nLuckily (i hope so) the root partition is partitioned with LVM, so i hope i can move the partition to the smaller internal HDD.\nIs this possible? And where do i find help?\nEDIT: This question already is quite old and could be outdated. I added the Ubuntu version that was used back then.\n\nA: As you suspect, this is extremely elegant to do using LVM. \nShrink the existing installation to fit the smaller disk.\nPhysically install the new harddisk, format and pvcreate it, use vgextend to add it to the same vg as your root partition\nUse pvmove to transparently move all data away from the old partition\nUse vgreduce to remove your external hd from your vg. Unplug the old disk /dev/sdOLD.\nIn the example below:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sdOLD stands for the old partition to replace\n\n*/dev/sdNEW stands for the new partition to take its place.\n\n*vgX        stands for the volume group\n\n\nExample: Of course, you have to be 100% sure that your are using the right devices. Also, having complete and up-to-date backups, removed from the system, is essential.\npvcreate /dev/sdNEW\nvgextend vgX /dev/sdNEW\npvmove /dev/sdOLD\nvgreduce vgX /dev/sdOLD\n\nUse update-grub and grub-install to make your new root disk bootable\nDone.\n\nA: First, if you used the whole 250GB disk for your current installation, you'll need to shrink it to fit the 120GB disk. You can only shrink an ext4 filesystem while it's unmounted, so you'll need to boot off an Ubuntu live system (CD or USB), or a specialized maintenance live system such as GParted live. You can use resize2fs or GParted to resize the existing filesystem.\nOnce you've shrunk the filesystem(s) of your existing installation to fit on the new disk, you can do the rest of the move with the filesystem mounted if you like. If the existing filesystem fits on the new disk, you can do the transfer without unmounting anything or rebooting.\nIn the following description, I'll show how to move from the physical volume /dev/sdb1 to the physical volume /dev/sda1, with an existing volume group called oldvg. Be sure to adjust the disk letters and partition numbers to match your system.\nTo do a live transfer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition the new disk, using the partitioning tool of your choice (cfdisk, fdisk, parted, …). See e.g. How do I add an additional hard drive?\n\n*Create a physical volume on the new disk: pvcreate /dev/sda1\n\n*Add this physical volume to the existing volume group containing the logical volume(s) you want to move: vgextend oldvg /dev/sda1\n\n*Move the logical volumes from one physical volume to another: pvmove /dev/sdb1 /dev/sda1\n\n*Split the existing volume group in two: vgsplit oldvg newvg /dev/sda1\nAnother method is to make the existing logical volume(s) a mirror volume with lvconvert --mirror, set up a mirror on the new disk, then split the mirrors with lvconvert --splitmirrors. This way, you end up with two copies of your data, and after the split each copy leads its own life.\nAfter you've done the copy, you'll need to make the new disk bootable. Mount the filesystem for this. Assuming it's mounted on /mnt, run these commands as root:\nchroot /mnt\n# if the name of the volume group has changed, edit /etc/fstab\nupdate-grub\ngrub-install /dev/sda\n\nAlternatively, you might be able to use Clonezilla. This is a powerful disk manipulation and cloning tool, and I think it covers your situation, but I have no experience with it.\n", "Q: My application quicklist goes missing when using \"quickly submitubuntu\" I'm trying to submit my app for the app showdown, but I've just noticed that when I use the \"submitubuntu\" Quickly command, my dynamic quicklist entries don't work.

It's similar to a combination of dos.library and exec.library on Amigas, but it also contains a lot of things that are in the C runtime library (like, for example, ixemul.library or the .lib files included with SAS/C and other compilers for AmigaOS).\nYou can find its Official GNU page here\n\nA: \nNote: Absinthe is the iOS 5.1 jailbreak tool.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*As tijybba has explained, libc (same as GLIBC) is the core library required by every single program on your system, including the kernel. For these reasons, it isn't really upgraded very often during the lifetime of a non-LTS release, if at all.\n\n*libc 2.15 shipped by default with Ubuntu 12.04, while Oneiric/11.10 stops at 2.14. No updates to 2.15 are available; while you can certainly download and compile 2.15 yourself, it's relatively complicated and can easily break your system (because it's such a core library).\n\n*For most programs, you could solve this problem by building them from source (where the currently available libc 2.14 would be used), but you cannot do this for Absinthe since it looks like they don't make source code available.\n\n*There are ways to make a binary use a specific version or set of libraries (google LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH), but they won't work here -- put simply -- because (again!) of how crucial libc is (I tried on 11.10).\n\n\nYour best option then, is to just create a 12.04 Live-USB, boot from it, install Absinthe, connect your iPhone/iPod/iPad, and jailbreak away.\n", "Q: error with slap.d while installing any new software I am trying to install wireshark (this issue is not specific to wireshark) on my ubuntu box  and I keep getting the following error for slap.d:\nSetting up slapd (2.4.23-6ubuntu6.1) ...\n  Creating initial configuration... mkdir: cannot create directory `/etc/ldap/slapd.d': File exists\ndpkg: error processing slapd (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n slapd\n\nBesides uninstalling or trying to update open LDAP or slap.d, is there any other action that can be taken to resolve this issue?

Here is an example from one of my /etc/sudoers files:\nCmnd_Alias      F2B_CLIENT_PING = /usr/bin/fail2ban-client ping\nnagios          ALL             = NOPASSWD: F2B_CLIENT_PING\n\nWhat the above does is allows the \"nagios\" user to execute \"/usr/bin/fail2ban-client ping\" as root using sudo, without being prompted for a password. I use it in my monitoring.\nYou'd have something like:\nCmnd_Alias RSYNC_BACKUP = /usr/local/sbin/backup_my_stuff_with_rsync.sh\nyouruser   ALL          = NOPASSWD: RSYNC_BACKUP\n\nand then in your cron you'd call sudo /usr/local/sbin/backup_my_stuff_with_rsync.sh\nYou can test it on the command line first to verify that it doesn't ask for password.\nNote that running a script as root is a big deal and so you must ensure that your script is secure and correct. If you can find any way to do this as non-root, that would be better.\n", "Q: Why does my screen blank out for the duration of the Grub boot menu?

Or will I use it fine?\nWhat do you suggest me?\nThanks everybody for your time, and sorry for my english.\n\nA: You can use Ubuntu 10.04 until April 2013. There will always be bugs early on after release, so many will prefer to wait a while before upgrading. When Apport (crash message) appears, that doesn't mean there's a serious error. It simply enables you to easily file bugs so that issues can be fixed. Most of the time, these messages doesn't really cause any problems. \nThere are benefits from using 12.04, such as the new Unity shell which is very nice when you get to know it. But there's nothing wrong with sticking with 10.04 and upgrade when you feel comfortable with it. It will not nag about upgrades. When there are updates for 10.04, you'll get a button that you can click to upgrade to 12.04 instead, but that's entirely optional and it's the same dialog that would appear in any case, so it's not disturbing. \n", "Q: What does \"paths must precede expression\" mean when using find?

However, I'd like to run UFW as this host will be web-accessible and I'd like some access control.\nHow can I configure UFW to allow this sort of traffic?\nI've tried various combinations of: ufw allow allow in|out on vboxnet0|tun0 with no success.\nMy UFW rules are:\nroot@gimli:~# ufw status\nStatus: active\n\nTo                         Action      From\n--                         ------      ----\n22                         ALLOW       Anywhere\nAnywhere                   ALLOW       10.0.0.0/16\nAnywhere on vboxnet0       ALLOW       Anywhere\nAnywhere on tun0           ALLOW       Anywhere\n\nAnywhere                   ALLOW OUT   Anywhere on vboxnet0\nAnywhere                   ALLOW OUT   Anywhere on tun0\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: if you set the DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY to ACCEPT in /etc/default/ufw the firewall will forward all packets regardless of the settings of the user interface.\nI think the user interface is only meant for simple in/out filtering. For forwarding you need to add iptables rules in /etc/ufw/before.rules like here:\n-A ufw-before-forward -i eth1 -p tcp -d 192.168.1.11 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n\nYou probably already have a rule that lets connections from inside out and another that lets packets from related and established tcp sessions back in.\nI'm no iptables specialist, it took me a very long time to figure this out (with ip6tables, but it should be similar). Maybe this is not all it takes in your case.\nBest greetings\n\nA: This ufw command worked for me nicely:\n\nsudo ufw default allow FORWARD\n\nTo be sure the change is applied: sudo service ufw restart\n\nA: It's now possible - from ufw man page:\n\nRules  for  traffic  not  destined for the host itself but instead for traffic that should be routed/forwarded through the\n  firewall should specify the route keyword before the rule (routing\n  rules differ signifi‐\n  cantly from PF syntax and instead take into account netfilter FORWARD chain conventions). For example:\n     ufw route allow in on eth1 out on eth2\n\nThis will allow all traffic routed to eth2 and coming in on eth1 to traverse the firewall.\n     ufw route allow in on eth0 out on eth1 to 12.34.45.67 port 80 proto tcp\n\nThis rule allows any packets coming in on eth0 to traverse the firewall out on eth1 to tcp port 80 on 12.34.45.67.\nIn addition to routing rules and policy, you must also setup IP forwarding.  This may be done by setting the following in\n  /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf:\n     net/ipv4/ip_forward=1\n     net/ipv6/conf/default/forwarding=1\n     net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding=1\n\nthen restarting the firewall:\n     ufw disable\n     ufw enable\n\nBe aware that setting kernel tunables is operating system specific and ufw sysctl settings may be overridden. See the sysctl\n  manual page for details.\n\n\nA: I figured it out.\nEdit /etc/default/ufw and set DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY to ACCEPT:\nDEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=\"ACCEPT\"\n\n", "Q: How to backup an Android phone on Ubuntu? Is it possible to backup an Android mobile phone when connected to Ubuntu?\nI have looked trough and searched here, but couldn't find any answers to this question. I have just bought an Android phone with Android 4. Any hints and tips on what I can sync with Ubuntu would be great. If you have any suggestions to apps I can use on Ubuntu to make it easier, please add the name of the app and how I can install it.\n\nA: Have you tried Airdoid?\nI too have an Android v4 Smartphone and this is what I use to back up all the important files on my phone.  Please note this is not an Ubuntu solution but it works perfectly with Firefox when used with Ubuntu.  It allows me to backup both my system files and of course my all important docs, photos and other media files.  Its a great interim solution while waiting for an FLOSS project to come up with perfect solution for Android users.\n\nWhat is AirDroid? \nAirDroid is a fast, free app that lets you wirelessly manage & control\n  your Android devices (phone & tablet) from a web browser. It’s\n  designed with the vision to bridge the gap between your Android device\n  and web browser, on desktop computers or tablet devices, on Windows,\n  Mac/iOS, or Linux. \nWhat can you do with AirDroid? \nYou can use AirDroid to send/receive SMS (text messages, if supported\n  by the device), install/uninstall apps, transfer files between Android\n  device and computer/tablet, and manage contacts, photos, music,\n  videos, and ringtones, etc., all in a web browser. Install AirDroid on\n  your Android device and open your favorite web browser to experience\n  it yourself.\nHow to get started with AirDroid and how to log in to AirDroid web desktop? \nDownload and install AirDroid app on your Android devices, start the\n  app and open your favorite web browser, input the address and Dynamic\n  Passcode to log in to AirDroid Web Desktop.\n\nMore Information here on the Official Airdroid website\n\nA: You can backup and restore devices with ADB. I have done so with a few devices from friends and family, including migrations to newer devices:\n\nSolution Available for 4.0+ Devices:\nFor 4.0+ devices there is a solution called \"adb backup\". This makes use of adb so you have to have the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) installed on your computer (on some Linux distributions: just packages android-tools-adb and android-tools-adbd).\nNOTE: This solution will not back up and restore contact, SMS or calendar information\nThe options for the adb command are:\nadb backup [-f <file>] [-apk|-noapk] [-shared|-noshared] [-all] [-system|nosystem] [<packages...>]\n\n\nRead the full article Full Backup of non-rooted devices and the info page in the tag wiki on our Android community site.\nThere are several apps to backup SMS from a non-rooted device in the Play Store, some of them save the data to the sdcard partition for convenience.\nI have not tried if this works with an Ubuntu phone at the time of writing this and I wouldn't advise doing so. If you still want to experiment be sure that you are connected to the Ubuntu ADB instance, not an ADB instance that might be running in the Android LXC container on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Sync and Backup are not the same thing. As to my knowledge (and I'm quite involved with Android) there's no way to achieve a complete backup on a non-rooted device. However: if your device is rooted, there's a good way to achieve your goal:\nOn the ma... ahem, play-store you find an app called Titanium Backup, which is the ultimate backup tool for Android (you might also want to visit its homepage for more details, FAQ, Howto, etc.). This app will create a backup of all your apps and data, which then is stored to your SD-card. From there you can use apps like FTPSyncX or FolderSync to synchronize the backup directory with your (Ubuntu) PC via SSH, FTP or Samba.\n\nA: I have solved my problem.\nFirst I installed wine. Then I downloaded HiSuite (Huawei's official PC suite) Link to download page and installed it.\nThen I had to connect my phone to a windows PC, so the HiSuite daemon was installed on the phone.\nWhen that is done, just open the HiSuite daemon on the phone and choose connect with wiFi. Enter the code on HiSuite on the PC, and voila. Now the phone is connected to ubuntu :)\nYou can backup the phone, import contacts and calendar (if you have installed MS outlook), manage the installed apps, install new apps (you have to download the apk files to your computer, this cannot be done in this software). You can edit, delete and create new contacts. And you can import the pictures taken.\nIt took a lot of hard work before I found out how to do this. And this article helped out :)\nHope this can be of use to others. I looked at a forum that this can work on other android phones as well. You just have to have the HiSuite daemon installed on the phone.\n\nA: Sync is typically supported by proprietary drivers produced by the phone manufacturer.  Most drivers are released for Win or Mac.  Ubuntu will mount the device and allow access to the installed SDcard.  Using apps from the PlayStore you can manage your content like contacts, pics, etc. on the SDcard and then drag and drop into a backup folder you create in your home holder in Ubuntu.  This can be done similarly with other OS's.\nDoing a quick search, I can't say there is an app that integrates an Android phone with Ubuntu.  I can say that in general, for advanced phone users, Ubuntu offers far easier use when trying to mount devices like phones and tablets.  A little time spent learning the phone will go along way with using Ubuntu to back it up.\nI have a rooted Android device that I prefer to use Ubuntu to tweak and manage my phone.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Fullscreen Video Dual Screen I recently starting getting this issue when making full screen videos.\nSo two things happen pretty consistently. \n\n\n*\n\n*The video tries to fullscreen and fails and snaps back to window\n\n*Or it succeeds and the video is full screen on the entire length of the two monitors. \n\n\nI would like for it to full screen on one of the monitor, preferably my main monitor. Right now what it thinks is that the system is one giant monitor which is useless. \nSo I wasn't clear I am talking about youtube, vimeo, flash based video in the browser. \nI appreciate any help. \nThanks. \n\nA: so the issue  I am having the newest flash plugin is causing the issue which version 11.3\nThat being said what you need to do is go to chrome://plugins in your browser and disable all the flash plugin and re-enable the previous version which is 11.2\n\nA: Right. So what happens is that when you fullscreen a Flash video player, it fills one of your screens, but if you try to interact with the other screen, then it drops out of fullscreen? That's well known and seriously annoying. I don't think there's any available fixes for it. \n\nA: I had this issue after installing a Chrome plugin for full screen Flash. I 'fixed' the problem by removing and reinstalling Chrome. I didn't need to delete the browser profile, just removing and reinstalling Chrome was enough.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade Ubuntu from a Windows burnt disc? I currently have Ubuntu 10 (Or 11) on my laptop but no Internet access so I can't use Update Manager. I want to burn a disc from (this) Windows computer to take home for the upgrade. Will this be exactly the same process as burning and installing straight from Windows? The instructions clearly state that to burn a disc from Windows is to install from Windows, no actual burn disc from Windows and update previous Ubuntu OS instruction.\n\nA: When you create a disk (whether burnt on a DVD or on a USB stick), it's a bootable disk that you can use from start-up whether the computer in question has Windows, Ubuntu, both, another OS entirely, or has been completely screwed up by an interesting experiment and no longer has any OS on it at all (which is just as well for some of us).\nThe lack of an internet connection would of course prevent you from updating what you have, or installing anything that isn't included in the ISO. It might be better to take the laptop to the connection, than the Ubuntu to the laptop.\nStill, a disk burnt from within Windows does not require Windows to be on the target machine.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu really slow down the rest of my home network? I have a Ubuntu desktop and a Windows 7 desktop. The Windows 7 machine is connected via wireless adapter and the Ubuntu desktop is connected via Ethernet. The wireless adapter is capable of 300Mbps link speed. When my Ubuntu is connected to the Internet, the network becomes very very slow. I have a 15 Mbps cable broadband connection. I have had many devices connected at one with no problem, yet this one connection seems to be wreaking havoc.\n\nA: My guess is that there is a specific program that could be eating up your bandwidth and without actual data it is harder to debug.\nThere are a lot of different ways you can see what applications and services are eating bandwidth.\n\n\n*\n\n*nethogs is a per application based solution \n\n*ntop is an overall statistics solution\n\n*netstat is also a good way to see which services are connected\n\n*bmon is a nice real time monitor\n\n\nI would also check your router logs and see if Ubuntu is trying to use some services from your router, but being denied or generating errors.\nOnce you post more information I can try and debug further.\n\nA: I can see that this have been discussed on the forum also. \nAnd the idea is that the closed drivers result in this effect. If you go back to the open drivers  sometimes all is well again. \nFor my network it is very strange that only one machine slows the network down, but the amazing thing for me is that if I use the closed driver for the network nothing bad happens. \nBut listen, now, when I used the catalyst driver (graphics driver), the network slow down completely from 10 Mbit/s to 0.34 Mbit/s  and when I shut down this machine the network gets fast again.\n", "Q: Why don't 12.04 Nvidia drivers work on my GeForce 6150 LE?

I know that it is possible to install Ubuntu on the transformer prime. \nI'm also aware that it is not stable since its something new. I'm wondering if anyone has tried it, how responsive/ fast is it? Does the batter die quickly?\n\nA: Ubuntu can be installed on the Transformer Prime. However, this is not a native installation as it runs on top of Android via VNC. Due to the limitations in VNC (and ultimately the hardware of the TFP), the graphics are pretty choppy. It is more of a proof of concept than it is a usable system.\nDue to everything mentioned above, I ended up not buying a Transformer Prime.

I an not even getting grub for OS selection. \nI have important data in hard disc\nHow to restore & get important data?\n\nA: All you need to do is follow the documentation here. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nBasically there a few methods, but the easiest is just making a CD with the ISO on it listed on the page. https://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/files/\nIt is a simple process and should get you back up and running.\n", "Q: No permission to delete file, no space to have permission My computer is nearly deadlocked. I have dedicated 200gig to Ubuntu (11.10) and lately it has decided to tell me that there is 0bytes of space left. This is causing all sorts of problems. First of all:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is using up this 200gig??!??! I don't download movies or anything and I only recently upgraded from my years of a 40gig HDD (with far more apps) so I can't even begin to imagine what could be taking up this much space. \n\n*I tried to run a backup program (photorec) recently that has left lots of locked files on my computer that I can read, but can't delete. I have tried to \"sudo\" my way into deleting things but get the error:\nError copying '/home/[my usr]/.Xauthority' to '/tmp/libgksu-w9v5iV': No space left on device\n[usr]@[my usr]-System-Product-Name:~$ \n\nSo basically I can't delete things because I don't have the space to have the permission to delete things? Is that right? I'm very confused by all of this. Also if someone has some idea of where to look for that extremely large 150gig+ of space being hogged I'd really appreciate it. My \"home\" directory is 15gig in size.\nEDIT: I just realised one thing. I haven't used up all of my 200gig. The disk analyser thingy shows 100% but it doesn't mean 100% of space used. This does beg the question, what is full and how do I \"unfull\" it...?????\n\nA: If you boot from a live cd you can do a backup because then you don't need to store the permissions on a disk. This is also better because then you don't use the disk you are trying to backup.\nAlso you can find large files on your system using the find command. Look here for details.\nEDIT: or use \ndu -ma / | sort -nr | head -n 20\n\nto quickly find the 20 largest files.\n\nA: 200 GB should definitely be well above sufficient for ubuntu itself.\nIf you share a partition between the system and /home, a few hundred GB size user files (e.g. movies) can easily take that space though.\nThe error seems to indicate that the partition where /tmp resides on, is the one with the issue.\nTry to run from a terminal/shell:\ndf -hl\n\nto see all your partitions and how much of them is in use.\nYou may limit the output to only /tmp, using:\ndf -hl /tmp\n\nThere's a wonderful graphical tool called 'filelight' which you may use to find which directories and files are taking up too much space.  You won't be able to install it if your system partition is full though.

My understanding is that yum, and the rpm system,  is only useful on distributions such as Red Hat, Fedora and CentOS. I thought that Ubuntu, as a Debian based system, had no use for yum.\nSo I was surprised to find yum in the (universe section of) the official Ubuntu repositories.\nWhen would yum be of use to an Ubuntu user?\n\nA: Yum is for RPM packages.   RPM is not the preferred installation method in Ubuntu.   The equivalent to Yum would be APT and dpkg.  Yum is not a preferred way to update an Ubuntu system.\nTo install it, you can do so from USC, or from terminal:\nsudo apt-get install yum\n\nI don't think you would have a use for it, since there are equivalent Commands in Ubuntu.  See the Table of Equivalent Commands\nI would think that it can be used as a backup, if for some reason normal command won't work.\n\nA: The primary use case for yum in Ubuntu is if a third-party application has its own yum repository, and no apt repository. Then it will sometimes work to install yum, enable the vendor/project repository for that software, and install the software.\n\nA: It is needed to create come types of LXC Containers, for example, those based on CentOS.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Windows Installer - Firewall I installed Ubuntu with the Windows installer to use it along side.

I get the following error message:\n\nPTY allocation request failed\n\nWhat does it mean and how to connect to my desktop?\nThis is the output with -v:\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /home/evag/.ssh/config  \ndebug1: /home/evag/.ssh/config line 1: Applying options for *\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config \ndebug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 19: Applying options for *\ndebug1: auto-mux: Trying existing master\ndebug1: mux_client_request_session: master session id: 2\nPTY allocation request failed\n\n\nGiven the output presented above with the verbose option, I think I understand where the problem comes from: I have two computers, A and B. I'm using a controlmaster in A to keep persistent connections to B. A logs into B in a safe way, with command=/bin/false to limit the usage A has on B (it has only forwarding capabilities). \nHowever I would want to connect to ssh from A to B without using this identity (-i), but the problem is that since there is a persistent connection, it uses the existing connection regardless of the option I put in -i, so I end up with not being able to allocate a PTY.\nSo given that there is an existing controlmaster and protected connection from A to B, how can I get another connection from A to B, but this time with full rights?\n\nA: I'm assuming that you have specified the ControlPath and ControlMaster in ~/.ssh/config ? In which case ssh will always check for the ControlPath when attempting to access that server. As I understand it this is the default if a ControlPath exists even if ControlMaster=no is set (because it is automatically set to 'no' if the ControlPath exists so as not to attempt to create a new ControlMaster).\nYou will need to specify a new ControlPath:\nssh -o ControlPath=~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p-newsession server\n\nHowever: I do the same thing but do not need to tell it to run 'false', I simply use the available options in SSH. See the man page for a way to create forwarding connections without starting a shell. When done properly the PTY is only allocated as needed, even over the same control connection.\n-f      Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.\n-N      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just forwarding ports.\n-T      Disable pseudo-tty allocation.\n\nSo in my case (along with other, unrelated options):\nssh -fNT server\n\nwhere ~/.ssh/config already specifies the ControlPath.\n", "Q: Command to delete all files from folders matching name recursivly? I have my base folder (let's call it base).\nI have a bunch of folders inside, scattered at various depths within these folders are cache folders.\nI want to delete all files from within the cache folders, but not the folders themselves.\nI have tried\ncd base\n#then one of...\nsudo rm -rf cache/*\nsudo rm -rf *cache/*\nsudo rm -rf cache*/*\nsudo rm -rf *cache*/*\n\nBut really am just guessing, what would be the right command?\n\nA: This will recursively delete all of the files within folders named cache, starting at the folder base. The cache folders themselves will still be intact, but all of the files within each will be removed.\nfind base -ipath \"*/cache/*\" -type f -delete\n\n\nA: In bash, you can enable globstar and use ** to match directories recursively\nshopt -s globstar\necho rm -rf ./**/*cache*/*\n\nSee Pattern Matching\n\nA: You could use the extremely powerful find command.\nI would use something like this:\nfind . -iname *cache* -ok rm -rf {} \\;\n\nNow let me explain it for you. Find is the name of the application, it has a lot of options but for you, you won't need many of them.\nThe . means look in this current directory. This means you'll have to be in the right directory to start off with. I assume for you that is ~\n-iname means search my case insensitive name.\n*cache* means that the name must contain cache.\nNow the next part is important.\n-ok means perform the commands that follow but as me if I want to do it first. This can be replaced with -exec but I wouldn't advise it. That would delete things without telling you and you don't want that.\nOk, so the next line (which is the stuff that -ok runs) is rm -rf {} \\;\nThe rm -rf I hope is self explanatory. The {} is basically a placeholder for the name of the file it has found. The \\; at the end just means it is the end of that line.\nI hope that makes sense.\nI advise running the find command without everything right of and including -ok. It will pump out a list of all the cache files first and you can review them. Then add the -ok section and get cracking!\n\nA: Just replace basedir by the path of the base directory you want to remove\n$ find basedir -type f -delete\n\nIf you feel more confortable moving previously to your base dir, then:\n$ cd basedir\n$ find . -type f -delete\n\n", "Q: How can I replicate the LiveUSB boot-experience using GRUB2?

I want to install a non-Ubuntu package manager like Portage (Gentoo) or Pacman (Arch) on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nHow do I do that?\n\nA: Due to the different packaging systems, the package managers are not interchangeable without a lot of blood, sweat and tears. Even then, there are a lot of dependency issues, and bugs, and errors, and rabbit holes that you cannot find your way out of. No, it's not it's not impossible, but, it's not recommended. PacApt is your best bet to use Pacman AND Portage commands in Ubuntu without destroying your computer. I believe that it supports commands from all of the major package managers. This is probably your safest bet for installation of Pacman/Portage-likeness in Ubuntu. Check it out. \nIf it isn't what you are looking for, your best bet (and recommended course of action) may be to install the distribution of the package manager that you want to use.\nPacApt Brings Arch Linux’s Amazing Pacman Package Manager to Other Linux Distributions (Well, Sort Of)\nSource:  LifeHacker\n\n\nA: Here people decribe how to install portage on other linux distibutions than gentoo:\nhttps://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-125553-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-300.html\nHere a man describe how to install whole gento on other partition from Ubuntu\nhttp://blog.abhiomkar.in/2008/07/17/install-gentoo-when-other-linux-running/\n\nA: You don't. A package manager is central to a specific distribution. Gentoo, Arch, Redhat -- they all use different packaging systems. Gentoo's portage packages usually compile from source, Arch uses its own binary package format, Redhat uses RPM as packaging system -- and Debian as well as Ubuntu and Linux Mint use Debian Packages (.deb). Managing your local installation takes place using graphical frontends like Synaptic and Adept, or command-line tools like apt-get, aptitude and dpkg.\nThough it is possible to install other package managers on Ubuntu (else they wouldn't be in the repositories), this is not to be recommended for the unexperienced user. One should be quite familiar with packages and package managers, how they work, etc. before even thinking about using them alongside. Otherwise it is very likely to end up with a very broken system -- as one package manager is not aware of the others, they would e.g. overwrite each others files/configurations, uninstalling a package with one package manager could break dependencies with the other, and more.\nSo for now I'd strongly suggest you stay with the package managers native to your system (see above).\n\nA: You cannot should not\nPackage managers are usually very tightly integrated with a particular Linux distribution, and you cannot usually install a native manager for one distro onto another and expect it to just work. (but see note at the end)\nYou can install the resulting packages, however, using tools to convert e.g. RPM to DEB, etc. This may be possible for Pacman packages. Portage, as you may be aware, builds everything from source, and you can do this on any distro, not just Gentoo.\n\nNote: While some like yum are available in the Ubuntu Universe repositories, and even Pacman, Portage etc. could be installed in theory, it's a bad idea in practice because the packages themselves may not be suited (directory structure, etc.) for Ubuntu.\n\n\nA: I can think of a good reason to want to install Portage on a Debian system. Dependency Hell. Not just for quagmires that people encounter when there are conflicts, but to get-RID of applications that are listed as dependencies that some users may not want.\nExample?\nWhat if I am paranoid and do not want \"security enhanced Linux\" or anything NSA produced on my system? I am not claiming that it is inherently a security flaw, though some exploits have been found in it. What if I am just biased and want it OFF of my system, for no other reason than because the idea of it irritates me? Why should it have to remove every other important application on my system to do it?....I am not saying not to include it in your default system if you want it, but why make it such an arbitrary dependency when it clearly is NOT one?\nNetmask? It is not a true dependency for your network manager. I can see how it might be useful on servers, but why do desktop users need it? In fact, it can be a liability to users who want more anonymity by using virtual systems. It also has a bug that lets you do a really easy DDOS-attack, or did back when everyone was mad about it.\nAvahi server? Again, could be useful, but why do I need my desktop advertising all its services and daemons? If I wanted more anonymity I would not want such a program advertising my computers services to any hacker or government stooge that wanted it. The printer should be the one saying \"I am a printer\"....My computer does not need to be the one saying \"I am a computer listening on all these ports, are you a printer...are you a printer...are you a printer..\". When I try to remove it, it takes too much with it.\nNet-bios? Dont need it. Don't want it.\nWhat is the standard reply? Don't remove it. Its an easy answer, but it sucks.\nSomething like Portage, which CAN install binaries, or even Slackwares style of file management, could do some good for a Debian/Ubuntu based operating system....but then users would just have too much control over their own computers, and we can have that in the open source world now can we?\n\nA: Today there is a lot of solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*zpkg: you can install any package from alpine, centos, debian, fedora, gentoo, archlinux, ubuntu.\n\n\nWith zpkg you can install programs from other distributions into your system\n  zpkg will install programs to your home directory. Global installations are also supported (via -g).  \n\nhttps://zpkg.plash.io/\nhttps://github.com/ihucos/zpkg\n\n\n*\n\n*Nix: this have a big repository.\n\n\nNix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes package management reliable and reproducible. \n  Nix runs on Linux, macOS and other systems. Nixpkgs, the Nix Packages collection, contains thousands of packages, many pre-compiled.\n\nhttps://nixos.org/nix/\n\n\n*\n\n*Another one:\n\n\n\nJuNest (Jailed User NEST) is a lightweight Arch Linux based distribution that allows to have an isolated GNU/Linux environment inside any generic host GNU/Linux OS and without the need to have root privileges for installing packages.\n\nhttps://github.com/fsquillace/junest\n\nA: Contrary to the scaremongering by the people above, of course you can install anything anywhere. You’re just not getting support from your OS for the manually installed things. And you will need to decide the way the two package managers get along yourself, and tell both package managers about it.\nGenerally, the idea is that you write a package for the foreign package manager in the format of the native packages, then install that, next, add a hook to the native package manager to tell the foreign one that a package is already installed/provided, and do the same for having the foreign tell the native one.\nThis will work, as long as the package of the foreign’s repository is actually drop-in compatible to the native one. In its binary interface, expected library locations, install locations, config locations, and dependencies.\nLuckily, all those things are configurable in Portage, and if something is not, it could be automated with a few small smart scripts.\n\n(Of course it’s easier if you can just set a directory prefix for everything installed by the foreign package manager, and hardlink things in if necessary. This plus a better chroot equivalent was essentially what vServers were, before paravirtualization and improved security. And the abomination known as “containers” do the same. But those miss the entire point of Linux/Unix, are actively harming its ecosystem, and only popular with people who can’t think in another mode than “Windows” and those with pointy hair and an iPad that used to print out the Internet. ;) So be careful to avoid losing most of the advantages of using Linux if you do this.)\n", "Q: Install Webcam driver (Genius facecam 300) I want to install the genius facecam 300 driver on ubuntu 12.04 64bit.\nI saw this website that seems to be useful: http://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/11269/; But I do not know how should I use it exactly.\nBus 004 Device 002: ID 093a:2627 Pixart Imaging, Inc.\n\nHow can I install that driver?\n\nA: If you want to apply that patch, you will need to recompile the kernel.  Instructions for doing so can be found here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile/\nWith that in mind, the patch in question appears to be adding an additional USB ID to an existing driver.  It is possible to patch additional IDs into a driver at runtime, so you might be able to get get away without going through a recompile.  You may want to try this even if you plan to recompile the kernel, since it should be enough to verify that the hardware works.\nFirst of all, load the driver in question:\nsudo modprobe gspca_pac7302\n\nNow you need to tell the driver about the new device ID:\necho 093a 2627 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/gspca_pac7302/new_id\n\nAt this point, the driver should bind to the new device.  If it doesn't, try unplugging and replugging it.  You should see a new /dev/videoN device file, and maybe some extra log messages in the output of dmesg when this happens.\nThe patch also sets a flag saying that images from this particular device are vertically flipped, so you might notice that in video applications.  I am not sure how you could fix that without the kernel recompile assuming the video application you're using doesn't have some way to correct for this.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installed alongside an infected Windows system My antivirus scan has found something on Windows 7.  No information yet what it is. However I was thinking of installing Ubuntu alongside Windows. Could that be dangerous in terms of Ubuntu catching anything malicious on the Windows system?\n\nA: The safest option would be to install Ubuntu on a different partition, but according to this post it seems safe. Here I quote it:\nWubi will not be affected by Windows viruses. Wubi is almost identical to the standard Ubuntu installation, except for the fact that everything is inside a file on the Windows partition. Therefore it cannot run windows executables (including viruses). The only way you can get a virus from Wubi is if you download something containing a virus, transfer the file to Windows, boot Windows, and then run the virus from Windows.\nAlso see this thread\nEDIT\nAlso if you want to run any programs in wine from your infected Windows installation, especially as root, you may open your system to infection. Also, the safest option is to format everything and then install Ubuntu - ObsessiveFOSS\n\nA: Knowing of malware that are malicious beyond imagination I would just be too afraid to let anything even remotely touch my Ubuntu. Therefore a Wubi installation can not be recommended.\nAs already said Windows malware will not infect your Ubuntu OS or replicate through Ubuntu but there are a lot of trojans that are capable of changing or even encrypting files on your harddisk. If this file was your Ubuntu Wubi container then you will not only have lost Ubuntu but also you will have lost the opportunity to rescue data from the infected system. This could easily be done from Ubuntu installed in a separate partition and using file system that is not accessible from Windows or Windows viruses.\nTherefore I strongly recommend a dual boot setup for running Ubuntu alongside a possibly infected or badly protected Windows.\n\nA: When you install Ubuntu via Wubi (Windows UBuntu Installer), nothing will get into Ubuntu because Wubi uses a virtual hard drive.  That means Ubuntu is installed into a very large file so there is no way for the virus to get into the file.  Unless you use a pen drive.\nWhen you do a full Ubuntu install, Ubuntu is installed on a real partition (obviously!), so there is chance for the Windows Virus to get into Ubuntu.  However, since Ubuntu is immune to viruses, the virus won't infect your Ubuntu install even if it manages to get into it.\nBut if you are still worried that the virus is infecting your Ubuntu install (technically impossible, but very rare), you can install the ClamTK virus scanner.\n\nA: How to do dyaual boot:\n\n\n*backup existing linux( /home/<username> not forgetting dot files ) and any Windows files\n\n*nuke( re-partition the whole disk(s) )\n\n*install Windows( it creates a bunch of partitions, this can be avoided by pre-partitioning the whole disk to a single NTFS partitionstrong text )\n\n*Via a live Ubuntu USB, use gparted to shrink the partition and create a linux partition structure, then check Windows still works\n\n*Install Ubuntu\n\n*update-grub to detect Windows's bootloader\n\nIs it dangerous:\nIf you don't log into your OS, the only evils that can harm you are ones outside it. To mind come rootkits. Nothing is ever perfectly secure.\n", "Q: Are the Linux utilities parts of the kernel/shell? Such as cp, ls, grep, ps... \nAre they stand-alone applications pre-installed on the operating system or the innate part of the operating system?\n\nA: Linux is but a kernel, allowing you to run executables with ELF headers. It contains only the most important files necessary to boot--itself, and calls init, which may just load upstart. However, it is important as it is needed to get at even the most basic utilities.\ninit is responsible for starting a login prompt, which can be considered an \"innate part of the Operating System.\" It will load a shell. While necessary for proper Linux use, it is not part of the kernel, but still very innate. A few commands are part of this shell, and available as executables in /usr/bin, /bin, or /sbin. ps and grep are separate executables that are not necessarily \"innate\". A complete list of what I consider \"innate parts of the Operating System\":\n\n\n*\n\n*The Kernel (Linux)\n\n*Filesystem drivers (only sysfs, mount, and drivers necessary for mounting the root filesystems, /bin, and /sbin,)\n\n*A logon shell, necessary for doing \"anything\", which includes essential commands not included in /bin/, /sbin, or /usr/bin.\n\n*Many commands in /bin and /sbin.\n\n*Effectively, libc, as almost every program uses it.\n\n*Drivers necessary to get any disks, or other critical hardware working\n\n*According to Debian package policy, dpkg(and its dependencies) are essential as they allow one to get additional utilities, although one may introduce important executables from external media\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu you will find Coreutils installed .\n\nThis package contains the basic file, shell and text manipulation\n  utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system.\nSpecifically, this package includes: arch base64 basename cat chcon\n  chgrp chmod chown chroot cksum comm cp csplit cut date dd df dir\n  dircolors dirname du echo env expand expr factor false flock fmt fold\n  groups head hostid id install join link ln logname ls md5sum mkdir\n  mkfifo mknod mktemp mv nice nl nohup nproc od paste pathchk pinky pr\n  printenv printf ptx pwd readlink rm rmdir runcon sha*sum seq shred\n  sleep sort split stat stty sum sync tac tail tee test timeout touch tr\n  true truncate tsort tty uname unexpand uniq unlink users vdir wc who\n  whoami yes\n\nCore GNU utilities .\nYou will find most of the basic commands from Core Utilities description page, said that , Linux is just a Name of Kernel, Whereas Ubuntu is an Entire Advanced Integrated OS of such utilities. As in Question Such as cp, ls, grep, ps...\n Are they stand-alone applications pre-installed on the operating\n system or the innate part of the operating system?\n\nThey together actually forms Ubuntu/Linux Operating System , Either of them existing standalone doesn't help much. \nShell is basically Bridge between kernel and the user, a Command Interpreter where user can type command and the command is conveyed to the kernel and it will be executed.And it is Different from Kernel , refer basic  image below \n\nAnd for more descriptive image \n\nFile Manager mostly forms the Front-End of common Core Utilities.\n\nSo how does that innate thing happens , its because ,\nLinux is Monolithic kernel  where all services (file system, VFS, device drivers, etc) as well as core functionality (scheduling, memory allocation, etc) are a tight knit group sharing the same space. It provides the shortest path to a working, stable kernel  .Whereas Memory, Process and Device managing are the functions of any Kernel.\nThere is also a very good description provided here at How to understand the Ubuntu file system layout?\nAdditions related to Libraries- \nThe GNU C Library and GCC GNU Compiler Collection is most important Library and Core requirement of Ubuntu/Linux Operating system. One of the reasons is Kernel is written Primary in C and hardware specific code using Assembly language.\nTo some extent \"OS is made up of two parts, i.e., Kernel and Shell\" holds true , for example Servers , and Minimal Linux based Distros. But for a fully fledged Ubuntu Desktop you need more then just Kernel and Shell.\nGtk (Gnome) is based on C and C++ , Qt(Kde) uses mostly C++ i guess , they don't have any libraries in common. Which is why they provide different User experience.\nFor utilities ( packages ) , you will find Python pre-installed in Ubuntu & Ubuntu-distros , to provide extended functionalities to python based Applications ( Like Window managers i guess) and Scripts . As i  mentioned early \"They together actually forms Ubuntu/Linux Operating System , Either of them existing standalone doesn't help much.\"\nYou can further refer the question How can I know if my an application on my desktop environment is loading other DE's modules, libraries, etc? .\n\nA: Command line tools such as ls, grep, cat and many others comprise the 'GNU coreutils', which is the standard toolset present on any GNU/Linux system. For a very useful summary of the utilities, and about how to use them, enter this in terminal:\ninfo coreutils\n\nTo output it to file:\ninfo coreutils > coreutils.txt\n\n(In answer to your other question, they are not part of the kernel or integrated within it. They are used in your terminal shell session as tools to achieve what you want to do.)\n", "Q: Why does my server freeze everyday at the same time? My server freezes every day at 00:50 am.

http://www.hskupin.info/2010/06/17/how-to-fix-the-oom-killer-crashe-under-linux/\n\nSo what’s happened? The reason can be explained shortly: The Linux\n  kernel likes to always allocate memory if applications asking for it.\n  Per default it doesn’t really check if there is enough memory\n  available. Given that behavior applications can allocate more memory\n  as really is available. At some point it can definitely cause an out\n  of memory situation. As result the OOM killer will be invoked and will\n  kill that process:\nJun 11 11:35:21 vsrv03 kernel: [378878.356858] php-cgi invoked oom-killer: gfp_mask=0x1280d2, order=0, oomkilladj=0\nJun 11 11:36:11 vsrv03 kernel: [378878.356880] Pid: 8490, comm: php-cgi Not tainted 2.6.26-2-xen-amd64 #1\n\nThe downside of this action is that all other running processes are\n  also affected. As result the complete VM didn’t work and needed a\n  restart.\nTo fix this problem the behavior of the kernel has to be changed, so\n  it will no longer overcommit the memory for application requests.\n  Finally I have included those mentioned values into the\n  /etc/sysctl.conf file, so they get automatically applied on start-up:\nvm.overcommit_memory = 2\nvm.overcommit_ratio = 80\n\n\n(Reboot to apply changes.)\nMore about overcommit: http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/lk/lk-9.html#ss9.6\n\nA: What happens is simple, the why is not (need more information).\nphp5-cgi begins to use a LOT of memory at that time (may be a memory leak or a side effect), so much so that the system will run out of memory. So the kernel kills it (oom-killer is the kernel's out-of-memory killer) to maintain system stability.\nThis looks like a VPS -- is it? What kind? OOM errors are usually rare on physical machines with sufficient (1 GB+) RAM and swap space (2x RAM at least).\n", "Q: Thinkpad T43p Bluetooth won't toggle on Have Ubuntu 12.04 running fine, everything works apart from the bluetooth. this seems to be a common problem to Linux, it has worked previously with a windows install but has never functioned with either Ubuntu 11.10, Mint Maya, or 12.04, but does work with xp.\nOn the top right it appears to recognize the wireless chip currently the option to 'turn bluetooth off' is there, however when I go into bluetooth settings the toggle is set to off and will not switch.\nNo additional drivers are suggested,\nCan you advise on how best to get it running?\n\nA: Try to see whether a radio killswitch is active using rfkill (example output on HP machine):\nrfkill list\n0: hci0: Bluetooth\n        Soft blocked: no\n        Hard blocked: no\n2: hp-wifi: Wireless LAN\n        Soft blocked: yes\n        Hard blocked: no\n3: hp-bluetooth: Bluetooth\n        Soft blocked: no\n        Hard blocked: no\n\nIf it's just 'Soft blocked', then unblock it:\nsudo rfkill unblock bluetooth\n\nIf it's 'Hard blocked' try to find the hardware switch on your laptop or an option in your BIOS may be preventing Bluetooth from being enabled.\n", "Q: How to install OpenJUMP? I'm trying to install OpenJUMP in Ubuntu 12.04.

Does anybody know how to install this?\nI don't think it's in any one of the repos either.\n\nA: To find the Bin directory you have to download the OpenJUMP-Portable-1.5.2-r2930-CORE.zip and then extract it, then you will find the Bin directory inside the extracted directory.\n", "Q: Dual boot with windows xp Now I'm using windows xp,but i just planned for ubuntu.Configeration of my pc is pentium 4 with 1gb of RAM.Is it good for dual boot?\nAnother thing is now I'm not able to play any hd Videos.After installing ubuntu can i able to play all this stuff?\n\nA: Yes, your PC is more than able to dual boot. Perhaps give a thought to Xubuntu, although I don't think that's necessary. \nAs for your second question -- HD is demanding. The fact that all newer PCs are able to effortlessly play it does not make it any less astoundingly resource intensive. Given your hardware, I estimate it's going to be difficult to get HD playing fluently. But -- that's no reason for not trying :)\n", "Q: Is network configuration necessary for ethernet? I am trying to connect my Ubuntu system to the internet using Ethernet cables. Do I need to change any settings from the defaults? Thanks.\n\nA: If your ISP dynamically(DHCP) assign IP address and has no MAC filtering or ISP has your original MAC then you do not need to do anything after install ubuntu. Even ubuntu will detect your internet connection during installation. So don't worry about this.\nIf you have static IP (isp provided) then you just need to add them in network connection which is easy and default installed. \n\nIf your ISP provide a MAC (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX) then add this in cloned MAC address section.\n\n\nA: If your network is using DHCP, then no. However, I recommend setting your DNS servers to 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 to use Google Public DNS.\n", "Q: How to permanently disable touchpad in 12.04? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to disable Touchpad? \n\nI'm looking for a way to permanently disable the touchpad in Ubuntu 12.04 (my computer is a Lenovo Thinkpad Edge on which it isn't possible to disable it in the BIOS).\nI tried the applications GPointingDeviceSettings and synaptiks 0.8.1 as well as the applets touchpad-indicator and Jupiter. None of these does the trick of disabling the touchpad permanently.\nJupiter comes closest - it remembers that I have disabled the touchpad after restart - but when I login after the computer has been in suspend mode, the touchpad is enabled again.\nCan anyone help me in disabling the touchpad possibly at a lower level so it won't in any way be enabled unless I choose to enable it?\nI'm totally new to linux so a detailed explanation would be much appreciated ...\nThe links, so far, doesn't address my question. I have no problem turning the touchpad off and making it stay off after reboot but when I login after the computer has been in an altered power mode it's on again. Isn't there a way to permanently disable a device like touchpad?\n\nA: I installed Pointing Device (package: gpointing-device-settings) from the store and it did disable my touchpad.\n\nA: The command\nsynclient TouchpadOff=1\n\nis what I use (change 1 to 0 to re-enable).\n\nA: Here is what finally solved the problem (posted by myself):\ngpointing-device-settings lost on reboot\nWhat had me (a linux newbie) confused was the difference between gconf and dconf. In this regard this was helpfull:\nWhen to use gconf vs dconf? \n\nA: You can find a tutorial with screenshots on how to disable your touchpad here.\nThere was an ask ubuntu article about this here.\nOne reason you might want to disable your touchpad is because you have a mouse connected to the laptop, so do not need to use the touchpad. The touchpad sometimes accidentally gets used, moving your cursor around the screen to a place you don't want it to be.\n", "Q: Eclipse IDE does not start My computer suddenly shut down due to power failure, while I was working on an Android project using my Eclipse Indigo IDE.\nNow, if I start Eclipse, only an empty message dialog (see screen shot) appears and Eclipse does not start.

Run the following command from terminal\n\neclipse -clean\n\n\nA: You can solve it by reinstall Eclipse :  \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall -f -m -u eclipse\n\nPerhaps first you need backup your projects/configs.\n", "Q: Use second Ubuntu Desktop as external Monitor I have an Ubuntu 12.04 installed on my iMac and would like to use my other old iMac, also running Ubuntu 12.04, as an external Monitor. Functionally if I were to move my cursor to the extreme right, as you would if you had a second monitor, it would switch to the other iMac and would be using it.\nCan't use TwinView as both computers are not NVidia based.\nI used to have this functionality in WinXP and it worked quite nicely because the 'second monitor' could run intensive processes without interfering with my main computer because its running on a separate computer.\n\nA: Because they are separate computers, you cannot use anything like TwinView or Xinerama, as they are not separate monitors on the same computer.\nYou can however, use synergy or x2x to accomplish what you want to do. Using synergy is probably easier, and there is a simple GUI called quicksynergy, which you can install to make using it easier.\n", "Q: Geforce(410m with CUDA) screen resolution on Ubuntu 12.04 issue I made a succesful installation of Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit on my Sony Vaio PCG-71811M. I have a Geforce 410M with CUDA,it seems works fine and i have already installed packages nvidia-current and nvidia-settings at version 302.17 (I think it's the latest in this moment), but my maximum screen resolution is 1366x768(and in the native display settings it's the same thing). How can I switch it to an highest resolution, like 1920x1080?\n\nA: You can't force it to accept any higher resolution. I have the same laptop and the maximum resolution is exactly 1366x768. Everything works properly.\n", "Q: How does the fstab 'defaults' option work? Is relatime recommended? I know the fstab defaults option means this: rw,suid,dev,exec,auto,nouser,async.\nBut what if I want to add one more option, for example relatime, should I still add defaults too or they are applied anyway? Is it needed to add at least one option?\nSome examples:\n1. UUID=bfb42838-d866-4233-9679-96e7536356df /media/data ext3 defaults 0 2\n2. UUID=bfb42838-d866-4233-9679-96e7536356df /media/data ext3 0 2\n3. UUID=bfb42838-d866-4233-9679-96e7536356df /media/data ext3 defaults,relatime 0 2\n4. UUID=bfb42838-d866-4233-9679-96e7536356df /media/data ext3 relatime 0 2\n\nIs the (2) correct(no option at all)? Are the (1) and (2) the same? Are the (3) and (4) the same?\nFurthermore, I read in the Ubuntu Community Documentation that in Ubuntu 8.04 relatime was used as default for linux native file systems. Is it still true for 12.04? If yes, then why do I see this if I use the mount command:\n/dev/sda2 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\nIf no, why not? It isn't recommended to use relatime now? I just wanted to apply it to my non system partitions, it is a good idea?\n\nEDIT:\nI found an other command to list the mounted partitions and their options:\ncat /proc/mounts\nThis is the result of a partition mounted with the defaults option in fstab:\n/dev/sdb2 /media/adat ext3 rw,relatime,errors=continue,barrier=1,data=ordered 0 0\nThis is the output of mount for the same partition:\n/dev/sdb2 on /media/adat type ext3 (rw)\nAnd here is both result if the same partition mounted from Nautilus as a non-root user:\n/dev/sdb2 /media/adat ext3 rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,errors=continue,barrier=1,data=ordered 0 0\n/dev/sdb2 on /media/adat type ext3 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks)\nSo it looks like relatime is used if we mount an ext partition in 12.04. So it is unneeded to add it manually. So my problem is broadly solved. But I still can't see why the options that should be in the defaults are not listed even with the cat /proc/mounts. Maybe there is a third and even better method to list the partition mount options :)\n\nA: I believe you need to have something in the \"options\" column in /etc/fstab, or the mount command will try using the next column and probably won't work. So if you have no specific changes, then \"defaults\" should be put there.\nRelatime is recommended on laptops and desktops with solid-state drives - it avoids a lot of extra hard drive writes, thereby improving battery and SSD life.  'relatime' has been included in the linux kernel defaults since linux version 2.6.30, so there is no reason to specify it unless you are running a very old kernel.  Having it specifically listed as 'defaults,relatime' won't break anything though.\n", "Q: How to start/stop iptables? While learning some new things about iptables I can't through this. While I am trying to start, its saying as \n root@badfox:~# iptables -L -n -v\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         \n\nChain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         \n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         \nroot@badfox:~# service iptables stop\niptables: unrecognized service\nroot@badfox:~# service iptables start\niptables: unrecognized service\n\nSource: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-iptables-examples.html\nWhy I am getting like this?\nEDIT: So my firewall already started but why I am not getting the output as I mentioned in the link at source link in first workout.\nHere is my output\nroot@badfox:~# sudo start ufw\nstart: Job is already running: ufw\nroot@badfox:~# iptables -L -n -v\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 4882 packets, 2486K bytes)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         \n\nChain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         \n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 5500 packets, 873K bytes)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         \nroot@badfox:~# \n\n\nA: The Uncomplicated Firewall or ufw is the configuration tool for iptables that comes by default on Ubuntu. So if you wanted to start or stop the ufw service, you'd have to do something like this\n#To stop\n$ sudo service ufw stop\nufw stop/waiting\n\n#To start\n$ sudo service ufw start\nufw start/running\n\nAbout why you are not receiving the output as shown in the source. It clearly states there that the output you are receiving is for an inactive firewall, that is, no rules have been set. So try setting up some rules in iptables. Here's the Ubuntu Wiki on iptables that shows you how to set, edit them and such.\n\nA: the service command works on RedHat-based systems with iptables very well, even on Centos 7, which has adopted systemd.\nSo if Debian-based systems don't consider iptables a service per se, it still might be thought of as one. And the command \"service iptables restart\" is actually very useful, especially when you want iptables to restore the 'default' rule (meaning, to use the main script; in centos /etc/sysconfig/iptables, etc.)\n", "Q: Using a custom protocol handler in Firefox to run a shell script? What I'd like to do is be able to start external programs from links in a local website.\nI've defined a custom protocol handler in firefox by setting the following variables in about:config\nnetwork.protocol-handler.external.myprotocol;true\nnetwork.protocol-handler.warn-external.myprotocol;true\n\nThis successfully causes firefox to open a 'launch application' dialog box when I click on a link in the form myprotocol:///path_to_program_I_want_to_run, and then I browse to the shell script I want to use and tell firefox to run it. Unfortunately the script doesn't seem to be run at all.\nI've set the file permissions to 777 so firefox shouldn't have any trouble running it\nThe shell script originally only contained the line\n$1\n\nThe idea being that the path of the link would be passed in as the first argument and would immediately be run as a program. This worked fine when I ran the script myself using commands like \n#./run_program.sh gedit \n\nor \n#./run_program.sh /home/ciaran/test_program\n\nThe script now for testing purposes contains only the line\necho \"testing\" > /testing/file.txt\n\nwhere 'testing' is a directory with 777 permissions. Also note that /testing/ actually is located at the root of my filesystem (though i can't remember why i put it there!), so I haven't just gotten mixed up between relative and absolute paths\nAgain, this runs perfectly fine when I run it from the terminal, and file.txt is created in the right location. With firefox though, I am given the option to choose an application to run, I choose that shell script, and it doesn't seem to do anything.\nfile.txt is not created at all, though there are no permission issues that I can see. So firefox just doesn't seem to be running the script.\nI have also tried changing my about:config to contain\nnetwork.protocol-handler.expose.camara;true\n\nand\nnetwork.protocol-handler.app.camara;path/to/shell/script\n\nwith no success\n\nA: Found the problem\nI didn't put #!/bin/bash at the top of the file. I was basically thinking of the shell script in the same way as a binary executable or something, rather than as an interpreted script, because I didn't need that line to run it directly in the terminal. I forgot that to run it from another program it has to be run through bash\nSo once that line is at the top of the script you can choose the shell script from firefox as the program to run your custom links with, and the link will successfully be passed into the script as the first argument.\n", "Q: DRIconf in Ubuntu 64x plus ATI GPU or something more? I've been trying to get Call of Duty 2 to work in Wine in Ubuntu. It gives me a black screen. So I tried the fix suggested by the wine apphq and downloaded DRIconf. Funny thing is that it can't find my direct rendering device.\n\"Could not detect any configurable direct-rendering capable devices. DRIconf will be started in expert mode\"\nWhen I enter into it in Expert Mode is just errors out anyway.\nfglrxinfo gives me:\ndisplay: :0  screen: 0\nOpenGL vendor string: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\nOpenGL renderer string: ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4200 Series\nOpenGL version string: 3.3.11627 Compatibility Profile Context\n\nThat shows me my driver is installed correctl,y right?  World of Goo which is Linux native and requires direct rendering works like a charm.\nSo I'm wondering, is there some other workaround? Is there a bigger issue? Does me running 64-bit affect it at all?\n\nA: First of all, running 64 bit should not affect it. I run 32bit applications on Wine just fine.\nSecondly, I would not suggest using DRIconf with Fglrx, the proprietary AMD/ATI driver, because DRIconf is for Open Source drivers. My suggestion would be to try PlayOnLinux and see if that has an entry for Call Of Duty.\nIf it does, use that to install the game and it will set it up just right, avoiding any issues with current versions of Wine.\nIf the issue still persists, your best option is to file a bug on Wine's bug tracker.\n\nTo Install PlayOnLinux:\nUse the command appropriate for your version of Ubuntu (I've included the command for 12.04). See here for the complete list: http://www.playonlinux.com/en/download.html\nwget -q \"http://deb.playonlinux.com/public.gpg\" -O- | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo wget http://deb.playonlinux.com/playonlinux_precise.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/playonlinux.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\n", "Q: How to delete all source codes and packages I have downloaded I've got a question regarding how to delete all source codes that I've downloaded.\nI think it just consumes a lot of space without any benefit yet!\nThanks in advance :)\n\nA: I suggest you read this Community Documentation article: Recover Lost Disk Space\nFrom link:\nHow to find lost space\nTo check the amount of space being used for package storage, run:\ndu -h /var/cache/apt/\n\nHow to Fix It\nThere are several system commands you can use to reduce or eliminate the number of locally stored packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all expired packages from /var/cache/apt/archives and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial that are no longer available for download:\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\n\"Not available for download\" does not mean the user should save them - normally these files have been replaced or are no longer needed.\n\n*Remove all the packages from /var/cache/apt/archives and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial folders:\nsudo apt-get clean\n\n\n*Remove unneeded dependencies which are no longer needed:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n\nSynaptic custom filter practice can also help for search packages:  \nYou can use this method for searching custom packages, but I DON'T RECOMMEND IT as universal method for cleaning. \n \nYou can choose different Statuses for New Filter : \n \nAnd create different Properties : \n\nGood Luck!\n\nA: I use the Janitor option in Ubuntu Tweak that gets rid of a lot of extra space.

However, you won't be able to move the Windows partition up to the front of the drive after installing it. The best way to go would be to buy an external hard drive and move your files onto it before installing Windows over the whole disk; otherwise, you can use this method but will be limited to those 70 free GB.\nOpen a terminal and\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nYou can, at this point, use gparted (running as root) to shrink your Ubuntu installation to its minimum size. If you really want to maximize the amount of free space, you can uninstall programs and delete files you don't need (again, I would strongly suggest backing up) and then do the shrink.\nAfter you shrink, you can install Windows 7 to that empty space, but I'd advise printing this first so you can recover any more files you might need.

How did you install Ubuntu before? What version did you install--was it this one? Also, please still do \"Check disc for defects\" on the machine you want to install on because (1) that can reveal problems with the machine as well as the installation media, and (2) the media might really be bad, and just working on other machines with hardware not requiring the corrupted files to be used\n@J.Naw Yes, the text-based alternate install CD might work.

The problem is that, when I am trying to launch it gets stuck on Initializing Required Components when it's loading. What can I do? \n\nA: The first thing to do with any Wine trouble is to look up the application on appdb.winehq.org. It is a really good, community-run database of Windows applications and their compatibility with Wine. From the page on Adobe Audition 3, and the trial version, we can see that people have reported it partly working with Ubuntu 10.04, but there is some extra work involved to reach that point. There is a link to an article describing the extra steps to run Audition in Ubuntu 10.04, but it's a little outdated at this point. This should be a little easier now.\nOpen the Terminal application, and try the following…\nMake sure winetricks is installed:\nsudo apt-get install winetricks\n\nNow, run the following command:\nwinetricks corefonts vcrun6 mfc40 gdiplus\n\n(You can also do that by opening Winetricks from the dash and selecting the components under \"Install a windows DLL or component\", but the command is a little quicker to deal with).\nTry to run Adobe Audition, now. If it still doesn't work, open the \"Configure Wine\" application, or type winecfg in the terminal. First, in the Applications tab, select the exe file for Audition. (You will have to walk through the file system).

How to fix this ?\n\nA: You cannot upload a version older or equal to, a version you've already uploaded to a PPA. My advice would be to live with the mistake, and don't make the same mistake in the future.

Here are a few examples:\n#Search Root ( / ) folder for a folder called www\n\nnits@excalibur:~$ sudo find / -name www -type d\n/media/6E5E0E255E0DE6A5/cygwin/srv/www\n/media/6E5E0E255E0DE6A5/cygwin/usr/share/doc/ImageMagick-6.4.0.6/www\n/media/6E5E0E255E0DE6A5/cygwin/usr/share/doc/GraphicsMagick/www\n/media/6E5E0E255E0DE6A5/cygwin/var/www\n/media/6E5E0E255E0DE6A5/wamp/www\n\n#Search current folder for a folder which start either Capital/lower-case M\n\nnits@excalibur:~$ find . -iname m* -type d\n./.local/share/telepathy/mission-control\n./.config/menus\n./.mozilla/firefox/vwfuj46p.default/minidumps\n./.cache/indicators/messages\n./.cache/chromium/Default/Media Cache\n./Music\n./.macromedia/Flash_Player/macromedia.com\n./.jedit/macros\n./.jedit/modes\n./.gconf/apps/metacity\n\nIn the above examples, you would have noticed that only the directories with no subdirectories in them are listed. You can use mindepth/maxdepth to set the depth of the level that needs to be traversed. \n#Search current directory for directories starting with either capital/lower-case M but only are present in the current directory\n\nnits@excalibur:~$ find . -maxdepth 1 -iname m* -type d\n./Music\n\n# Traverse two levels (current level and one level under) in the current directory for directories starting with either capital/lower-case M:\n\nnits@excalibur:~$ find . -maxdepth 2 -iname m* -type d\n./.config/menus\n./Music\n./.jedit/macros\n./.jedit/modes\n\nThere are a whole load of different options to search directories and files as well using  find, you can look through the man-page accessible by man find for all the options and how to use it. Also although find is slower than locate it doesn't require updatedb to update a DB to search through because the search is performed real-time.\n\nA: Use the locate command. It uses a database that gets updated via updatedb. I have a cron job that runs updatedb every hour so the database is up-to-date.\n", "Q: Unsolvable wow problems I have direct rendering enabled on my ati radeon 4200\nI have changed all of my registry and game settings to make it work correctly and well.\nBUT WoW still wont run past 8 fps.

After the install and restart, the external monitor is no longer detected. How can this be fixed? I know the display still works after the install because i can see the bottom corner of my laptop screen, there is just no signal going to the external monitor anymore.\nWhen I revert back to before I installed the driver the external monitor will display again.\n\nA: That is a known bug with proprietary Nvidia drivers in Ubuntu. You have to use the Nvidia-X server settings to do it. Now, since you cannot see your laptop screen to do this I would recommend this:\n1- While in reverted mode (no Nvidia drivers) install Disper.\n2- Once installed Disper lets you manage your output display by assigning shortcut keys to disper comands. An example: Open the keyboard menu in ubuntu, go to shortcuts and there to custom shortcuts. Then create a new one (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+Enter) and assign it to this command\ndisper -S\n\nYou can also create a second shortcut (e.g. Ctrl+Atl+Del) and assign it to:\ndisper -s\n\n3- Install Nvidia drivers in the usual way and restart your laptop. Also make sure that disper is in your startup application list.\n4- When rebooted simply press the first shortcut key combo Ctrl+Alt+Enter and it will send your desktop to the external display. To revert back to default just press the second shortcut Ctrl+Atl+Del.\nThere are many more posibilities with disper...just explore the website and the examples provided.\nHope that is helpful.\n", "Q: Choppy flash video playback, 'settings' disabled for Flash as well I'm using 12.04 classic Gnome.

XTerm font is very small.

Use a truetype font and size.\nxterm*faceName: Monospace\nxterm*faceSize: 14\n\nThen run the following:\nxrdb -merge ~/.Xresources\n\n\nA: You can also Ctrl-Right mouse click for temporary change of font size\n\nA: you can also simply test them with :\n\nxterm  -fn \"--clean--*---*---*---*-*\"\n\nafter sel with xfontsel\n\nA: Creating the .Xresources file with specified lines of code (provided in the answer by noffle) fixed my issue, but on reboot the settings got lost again.\nIf the settings specified in the .Xresource file are not getting reflected automatically, try adding the below line to ~/.bashrc.\n[[ -f ~/.Xresources ]] && xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources\n\n\nA: From messing with /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm file and man page for Xterm I found two methods. \nMethod 1: A simpler method but not permanent: hold Ctrl key and right click button. This should bring up a menu for VT fonts, which stays on only as long as you hold right click key. You should see 7 choices, the largest being huge, which is what I'm using because my vision isn't exactly good.\nSource: xterm(1) man page, part VT Fonts, which states \"The  fontMenu  pops  up  when when the “control” key and\n       pointer button three are pressed in a window.\"\nMethod 2: Permanent. Look through /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm, find what sizes lines such as *VT100.font1: , choose one, and write somewhere xterm*font:  10x20 (10x20 , again this is my choice for reasons I already stated).\nAbout my system: I'm running Ubuntu 13.10\n\nA: If you don't already have one, create a file in your home directory named .Xresources to store your preferences for various X programs. Append a line to the file such as\nxterm*font:     *-fixed-*-*-*-18-*\n\nThis informs xterm to use the 'fixed' font at size 18. From here, to incorporate the changes you've made you can either:\n\n*\n\n*restart X; or\n\n*run xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources in a terminal\n\nAll new xterms should now have the font change.\nIf you run man xterm and go down to the RESOURCES section, you can find a wealth of additional, configurable xterm options.\n", "Q: Installer installed system to USB stick, not main hdd Yesterday I installed ubuntu 12.04 to my computer and when I finished I realized that it had installed onto the USB stick.

On windows all files are placed in Program Files, so I am a bit confused. My main question is: can I change the file location or can I know the location where the file has been installed?\n\nA: It's best not to mess with where the package manager puts files ; it relies on knowing where it put things in order to be able to upgrade.\nLinux distributions typically use some variant of the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, which defines where most files should be put. Most .deb packages in the archives adhere to this standard.\nOn the one hand, this makes installing packaged software easier - it doesn't ask you where you want to install it. On the other hand, it can make it more mysterious. The typical .deb package will place files in multiple folders.\nDespite not controlling where I install packages (for the most part ; I install packages which are manual downloads into /opt), it's not something I concern myself with on a daily basis. I just trust that things are going to be installed in the right place, and so far, I seem to be right :-)\nIf you want to see exactly what files a package has installed and where, Synaptic (the advanced GUI package manager, not installed by default) will show you, after you've installed the package.

I found some guides for GRUB2 and TrueCrypt, but they all assume that the linux root partition is not encrypted, which is the case in my situation ):\n\nA: @stefan.at.wpf's solution is the one recommended all over the Internet.  It would not work for me.  At all.  But I found another solution, which did work for me.\nEssentially, you chain-load GRUB2 to load SYSLINUX, which in turn boots the TrueCrypt Rescue ISO image, which allows you to boot into Windows.\nI have documented the full details here.  The summary version, though, would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install syslinux:\nsudo aptitude install syslinux\n\n\n*Copy files into place:\nsudo cp /usr/lib/syslinux/memdisk /boot/\nsudo cp TrueCrypt\\ Rescue\\ Disk.iso /boot/truecrypt-rescue-disk.iso\n\n\n*Determine the UUID of your boot partition:\nsudo blkid /dev/sda2\n\nOutput should look something like this:\n\n/dev/sda3: UUID=\"12345678-1234-1234-1234567890\"\n\n\n*Configure GRUB2:\nAdd the following to /etc/grub.d/40_custom:\nmenuentry \"TrueCrypt ISO boot\" {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod fat\n    insmod ext2\n    insmod search_fs_uuid\n    search --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=boot [UUID without quotes]\n    linux16 ($boot)/memdisk iso raw\n    initrd16 ($boot)/truecrypt-rescue-disk.iso\n}\n\n\n*Re-load GRUB2 configuration\nsudo update-grub\n\nNote that this will show you the [F8] Repair options every time you boot into Windows, as we're fooling the system booting the TrueCrypt Rescue CD image from the hard drive, rather than the \"normal\" TrueCrypt boot method. But it seems like a small drawback to me (and might even be considered an added feature!)\n\nA: Solution:\nBefore encrypting windows, install GRUB2 to /boot using\ngrub-install /dev/sda2 --force\n\nIgnore the warning. Then install Truecrypt, make Windows partition active (e.g. using diskpart on windows 7 setup cd). ESC in TC bootloader now leads to grub - all fine :-)\nMounting the encrypted root using luks from a live cd and instal grub2 using chroot should also be possible, I forgot this simple solution.\n\nA: Flimzy's answer didn't work for me, and I did not feel like spending hours decrypting and re-encrypting Windows to try stefan.at.wpf's suggestion.\nOut of desperation, I tried fiddling around in the Grub command line, gave up and typed exit to go do something else, and was presented with the TrueCrypt bootloader. \nI was stunned.\nI edited my /etc/grub.d/40_custom file to read\n\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\n              exit\n  }\n\nAnd it totally works.\nObviously YMMV, but here's my set up: TrueCrypt-encrypted-Windows owning the entirety of one disk, and Linux and Grub 2.02~beta2-29ubuntu0.1 owning the entirety of another disk.

I tried to put movies on the flash drive, and it seems to work, but when I plugged it into the PS3, the video files did not show up at all i.e. nonexistent to PS3. When I plugged it into a Windows 7 computer, instead of \"Video Clip,\" like all of the other videos put on there from the PS3, it said \"File,\" and had a different icon.\nIn case the thought occurs to someone, there is nothing wrong with the files themselves.\nI had another SanDisk flash drive, but it was 16 Gigabyte, and not \"Glide.\" That is what I normally use to transfer video files to and fro the PS3, but it is not in my possession at the time, so I have not been able to test it yet.

Someone gave it to me, and it has PNC on it, which is a bank, so I'm not sure if it could just be a SanDisk flash drive with a PNC outfit. \nAnyone can help?\n\nA: Firstly, your files are not named with a suffix. (.avi, .mpg, .mp4, etc)\nThis produces files that work just fine on Linux because it uses magic (not kidding, the pattern match data is literally called magic) to determine file type (use man magic at a terminal for a longer explanation).\nWindows on the other hand trusts the name of the file to decide what to do with it. The default configuration of Windows hides these file extensions ; most advanced users regard this as an unsafe behaviour (because it's too easy to ship a virus program with an icon that makes it look like a video or image).\nI can't say I have experience with a PS3, but it will play these encodings, apparently. I don't know if it needs files named a particular way.\nhttp://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/video/filetypes.html\n\nA: Please check to make sure the format is supported on PS3.\nAlso, you may want to make sure the file transfers have completed. The easiest way, that I know of, is to eject the flash drive and if it says that the drive is busy then it's still copying files.\n", "Q: What is the default shell, and are there any other options? I am new to Ubuntu. Looking for the meaning of shell, I got a list of many different shells.\nSo I'd like to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which shell is used by default in Ubuntu?\n\n*What other shells are available?\n\n*Is there any advantage in switching to another shell?\n\n\nA: Most users don't need to care about different shells. What you'll probably need is to be able to use it to launch some commands the old way; you can open a text-shell using a terminal emulator like gnome-terminal, xterm, etc. which look like this \n\nOr you can go to a virtual terminal pressing CTRL+ALT+F1 or F2, F3, F4, F5, F6. Yes, you have six of them and they look like this\n\nAnd log in with your credentials, username and password.\nAnyway all of these use BASH as default.\nThere are many other shells. You can find some info on wikipedia; look for \"Unix shell\".\nStick with BASH unless you find yourself in a rare corner case, because many how-tos and tutorials out there refer to it.\nWhen using scripts things are a bit different because the default shell, the one linked to /bin/sh is dash\n\nA: I believe Ubuntu uses BaSH which is Bourne-Again Shell and is an upgrade over the original shell (Bourne Shell)\nThat's the only shell I use and you can install others but there's really no need to.\nUpdate: From a terminal, type echo $0 to see what shell you're running. That's $ then a zero.\n\nA: The term \"shell\" often gets misused when referring to Linux. What the above two answers are referring to is the bash shell, which is the syntax used in simple scripts and the terminal. What I think you're looking for is a shell interface, or more formally a \"desktop environment,\" or DE. DEs are basically how your desktop looks and is organized.\nProbably the most famous and widely-used DE was Gnome 2, which was implemented by the majority of popular Linux distributions. The reason there's so much talk about which \"shell\" (DE) is best is probably because of Gnome 3.\nThe Ubuntu team began development of the current DE, Unity, around the same time Gnome 3 entered development. When they change Ubuntu to ship with Unity as the standard, there were a lot of complaints. Even more troubling was the fact that Gnome 3 was released to mixed (and poor) reviews, meaning that the next generation of the most popular DE and the DE used by the most popular distro were 1) different and 2) poorly recieved.\nUnity has been greatly revamped over the past few releases and is now pretty cutting-edge. Gnome 3 has also received significant overhauls, so I'd say they're both viable options, though Unity is probably easiest to stick with, since it's already installed. Other environments Ubuntu supports well include XFCE and LXDE, which are designed for lower-end hardware.\nThere is no \"best\" desktop environment, and if you want to switch it's entirely up to you. However, it's probably best to learn the basics of Ubuntu and Linux in general before moving on to replacing your desktop.\nTo sum up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity is the desktop you're using right now. It comes standard with Ubuntu and is given the most support because it is developed by Ubuntu developers.\n\n*Gnome 3 is said to be a bit confusing overall, but it's also got good support and looks nice.\n\n*XFCE is the most popular lightweight desktop. Feels fairly similar to Windows.\n\n*LXDE is a fairly recent competitor to XFCE.\n\n*Gnome 2 is available in Ubuntu by logging out and browsing the DE menu. Very stable, but no longer updated.\n\nA: 3 questions in one, let's see:\nWhich shell is used by default in Ubuntu?\nThat differs. In some places, it is Dash, in most cases Bash. To see which is set for your user, simply open a terminal window and execute echo $SHELL. To check for all users on your system, you can take a look at the /etc/passwd file, where for each user capable of logging into the system the default shell is specified.\nWhat other shells are available?\nThis very much depends on which you've got installed. Both above mentioned shells come by default, others are available in the repositories. For a list of shells, you can take a look at Wikipedias Category:UNIX shells.\nIs there any advantage in switching to another shell?\nDepends on which you are currently using, and what your goals are. Some shells provide additional (and quite extensive) features, such as e.g. ZShell -- while others are more minimalistic, using less ressources (e.g. Dash compared to Bash). As stated above, you may check with the Wikipedia category to take a look at different shells and what they have to offer.\n", "Q: Java using too much CPU Trying to use either Eclipse or Apache Tomcat pushes all 4 CPU cores to around 60% cpu usage, and trying to run both at the same time maxes them all out.\nTried deleting all the webapps I'd deployed to Tomcat, no effect.\nTried editing eclipse.ini to provide more memory (-Xmx2048m), no effect.\nversions:\n\n\n*\n\n*java: 1.6.0_24\n\n*eclipse: Indigo (3.7.2)\n\n*tomcat: 5.5.35\n\n\nA: Maybe you could try installing openjdk-7-jre .\n", "Q: What is X-Ayatana? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat is the Ayatana Project? \n\nI've heard of the X-Ayatana mailing list or something like that..\nAlso when we create .desktop files adding quicklists needs the one line to be added at the start having X-Ayatana mentioned...\nWhat is this exactly?\nA detailed answer would be gr8..\nFrom community members would be best :)\n\nA: For the .desktop files, non-standard keys are required to start with X-, as per the FreeDesktop Desktop File Spec.\n", "Q: Sound from Ubuntu Server 10.04 I feel like this should be a no brainer, but I just can't seem to figure it out.

This can be done via sudo apt-get install alsa lame mpd. Configure your volume levels using sudo alsamixer, configure mpd with what folder the music is in via the music_directory in /etc/mpd.conf (make sure the mpd user can read that folder, its subfolders, and all the files contained therein as noted in the mpd config file), and configure mpd to listen on on the correct IP address via the bind_to_address in /etc/mpd.conf (or just comment that line which will cause mpd to default to \"any\"). Assuming all of those steps have been completed, you can narrow the issue down to an issue with the VM playing sound through VMware. \"swift\" already provided a link on how to install the VMware tools as a comment on Corey's answer.\nNote: I used VirtualBox for my testing before rolling this out to the physical server as the config and management may be a little limited in VirtualBox, but is easier to set up each new VM.\n\nA: Did you check to make sure sound is enabled in the VM?

Ctrl+MouseWheel to zoom/out. Ctrl+0 to reset.* Thanks for @erdemkeren \n\nA: Depending on the browser used, suitable user-styles might provide a solution. For Firefox, there is the Stylish addon for this issue, which I am familar with (I do not use Chromium). On the other hand it looks like there's a Stylish for Chromium available as well.\nso how does that help you here? You first need to identify the \"over-sized\" element on the page. In many cases, this is a div element with the id \"content\" (<DIV ID=\"content\" ...>), with a corresponding style saying something like div#content { width:1234px ... }. Using Stylish, you can override this setting, in my example this could be done by a user-style containing div#content { width:100% !important; } (the \"important\" meaning: override existing rule). With this relative value, that element now should always exactly fit into the window -- however, there may be more elements you need to adjust.\nBefore starting to play around yourself -- especially if you are not that used to HTML/CSS -- you could check at UserStyles.ORG whether somebody else already did that job. You will find a lot of interesting snippets there.\nAlternatively / Additionally, it's worth taking a look at UserScripts.ORG as well. Instead of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) they use JavaScript, which is \"injected\" into the pages at runtime. For Firefox this is done via Extensions like GreaseMonkey or Scriptish -- as far as I know this functionality is built-in with Opera and Chrome, not sure about Chromium. Due to JavaScript usage, this way it is possible to manipulate the entire DOM-tree: add/delete/move elements, and more.\n", "Q: Using Juju with private Openstack cloud deployment? I'm seeing a number of problems trying to use Juju with our internally deployed Openstack cloud.  Most of this appears to be centered around DNS host resolution as well as the need to deal with our company's internal HTTP proxies.\nOur Openstack deployment relies upon an unroutable 172.16.0.0/12 block of addresses for VLAN allocation to each project (tenant) hosted on our internal cloud.  User's have the option of assigning one or more floating addresses to instances, allocated from a block of routable addresses on our internal companies LAN.\nCurrently, Openstack doesn't register instance names with anything other than the DNSMASQ service running on the cloud controller.  As such, there's no way to resolve this address through our internal DNS hierarchy (this issue has already been reported as Bug #945505).  As such, even though I can bootstrap my Juju server node, I can't connect to it with the Juju client, since it can't resolve the local (private) network name.  I am able to ssh to the node, once I've assigned it an internally routable (i.e. floating) address.  Which leads to the next issue.\nNext, to install software on an instance running in our cloud, it must have our internal proxy address defined - either in the apt.conf file or via environment variables.  Unfortunately, when bootstrapping the server node, there's no provision to pass this info into a instance via JuJu environment.yaml file (if this is even the best way to handle this issue).  As a result, the bootstrap node is unable to install the required packages.\nI'm assuming (dangerous, I know) that the way that I've deployed Openstack in our internal environment is probably not unique.  Has anyone else encountered these issues?  And more importantly, are work arounds available?\n\nA: After deploying/bootstrapping, Juju will attempt to connect to the environment via the public address of the instances.  AFAIK, it gets this address straight from EC2 API's describe_instance(s) call.  In your environment, new instances spawn with an internal/private address and no public (floating) IP associated.  The result is a private address in both the private and public address fields of describe_instances.  After associating a floating IP to the instance, the public address field should now show the newly associated address.  \nOnce its associated, Juju should be able to connect fine via SSH (just like you can).  So, you should be able to 'juju bootstrap', associate IP to bootstrap node, 'juju status'.  You'd need to also associate floating IPs to all other machines deployed.   One option is to add the '--auto_assign_floating_ip' to nova.conf, so that floating IP association happens automatically on instance spawn.\nAs for the proxy-to-apt issue, it would be great if Juju allowed users to customize the cloud-config that gets passed to new nodes for bootstrapping the Juju agents.  If it was possible, you can configure your apt proxies alongside the juju-specific cloud-config.  Since thats not currently supported, one option would be to publish a customized cloud image into Glance that contains a apt.conf for your environment, and set default-image-id in environments.yaml to that AMI ID.  \n", "Q: How do I disable/modify CPU underclocking due to temperature on a laptop with a 2nd generation core cpu? I am running Ubuntu 11.04 on a tablet with a Core i5-2557M processor. When doing processing intensive tasks the CPU is forcibly under-clocked to 800MHz (instead of the normal base of 1.7GHz.) The CPU temperature is around 75 C.\nI have disabled CPU scaling (set governor to performance) but this seems to have no effect. I would like to either modify the behavior so that the throttling happens at 95 C or I would like to disable it altogether. Changing the min/max frequency as root using cpufreq works until the temperature rises and then it ceases to work, ignoring a minimum frequency above the 800MHz.\nOn Windows 7 there is a 3rd party utility that can do this (ThrottleStop).\nThank you.\n\nA: The throttling is defined in the firmware (BIOS) and the kernel is just following the orders to do what is right.  If you ignore throttling and the CPU hits Tjmax your CPU will shutdown automatically.  I suspect the machine is designed this way so you don't see blue smoke appear out of the machine too frequently.\n", "Q: ubuntu box just redisplaying login screen after update My Ubuntu 12.04 box has been working fine.  A recent update may have messed something up.\nI normally run remote windows on it, and I noticed that my windows were failing to start up.  I then tried logging into it directly from the GUI console, and I'm seeing that after I press enter on the (valid) password, the page just redisplays.  It's not a password error, as that would give me an inline error.

Oneiric and blessed with an ATI 256MB card My problem seems to be relatively simple: I would like to be able to watch simple videos on Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric), using an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3450, 256 MB graphics card, presently relying on the fglrx driver (but would readily change to anything that can give me that and a cool fan) installed from the repositories, but video playback is plain UGLY.\nWhat I am experiencing:  On various players, incl. the default Totem, VLC, as well as the MPlayer-based SMPlayer and Gnome Player video playback is either plain ugly, (motions are sloppy, occasionally, at lower res. xvid avi videos even leaving a very slight trail, and at faster motions horizontally \"breaking\" in two in the upper segment of the screen) or just similarly breaking in high resolution H264-encoded 720p, 1080p mkv videos and motion hardly feels continuous, feels like...dragged.\nMoving any window around over the desktop is pretty blurry, too, (text in a gedit window for instance becomes unreadable when moved around).\nWhat I do not need: I will not play any 3D games, need no super fancy desktop effects, or anything, only my videos.\nMy hardware is:\nDell Studio 1535\nIntel® Core™2 Duo CPU T9300 @ 2.50GHz × 2 \n4096MB RAM\nATI Mobility Radeon HD3450, 256MB dedicated memory\nResolution: 1440 x 900\nMy present software situation:\nI have installed fglrx successfully, the output of fglrxinfo seems to indicate what it is supposed to: \ndisplay: :0  screen: 0\nOpenGL vendor string: ATI Technologies Inc.\nOpenGL renderer string: ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3400 Series\nOpenGL version string: 3.3.11005 Compatibility Profile Context\n\nHowever, under \"Graphics\", System Settings >> System Info displays this: \"Driver VESA:M82; Experience Standard\".\nWhat I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 is out of the question: with my hardware it proved to be way too buggy. (My typical experience with LTS distributions.)\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10. clean install, installing Catalyst 12.04. (The version suggested by the ATI website for my graphics card.) The output of fglrxinfo proved the driver didn't install properly. Reinstalled OS.\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10. (from now all my tests happened on Oneiric) clean install, fglrx proprietery driver installed from repositories (I installed Catalyst 11.8., not the post-release update 11.9, as per this post, tried installing 11.9 too, but it didn't install properly, so I performed a clean OS installation again - yes I know I could have removed/purged fglrx, but I am obsessive-compulsive (and now getting pretty tired and desperate, too).)\n\n*Thought that I might need hardware acceleration, so I tried installing the packages\nsudo apt-get install xvba-va-driver libva-glx1 libva-egl1 vainfo\nbut realized that libva-egl1 wasn't in the 11.10. repositories, so I cannot show the output of vainfo.\nMy past: Have been an Ubuntu user (and missionary) for about 5 years, in the past few I have been using Karmic, which has become heavily outdated by now (especially lacking security updates), but for video playback I used the proprietary driver available from the ATI website at the time, and playback as well as fan and power management was just great. In MPlayer I used to use xv overlay. With glxgears I used to get over 3800 FPS.\nIf anybody is willing, let alone able to help, it is highly welcome and greatly appreciated.\n\nA: It seems that at this point the best option for this ATI card is the open source driver, which works with these cards.\nIt provides excellent 2D and 3D acceleration and video playback seems to be flawless so far and even desktop effects are way smoother than with the fglrx driver from the 11.10. repositories.\nTo fully uninstall the already installed proprietary driver I followed this post (suggested by Bruno Pereira), but I checked this site as well.\nAlso, under \"Graphics\", System Settings >> System Info now displays this: \"Gallium 0.4 on AMD RV620\", which is just perfect.\nAnyone having the same card is NOT recommended to install:\n\n\n*\n\n*fglrx (post-release updates) from the 11.10. repositories (simply doesn't install properly)\n\n*fglrx from the 11.10. repositories (comes with the descibed problems)\n\n*fglrx 12.04. from the ATI site following the ATI Linux community wiki (doesn't install properly)\n\n*installing xvba-va-driver, libva-glx1 and vainfo was a waste of time, obviously, since my card (Mobility Radeon HD 3450) does not support UDV2 (its supported UDV version is UDV+). If you would like to check if your card supports UDV2 and is thus subject to 3D acceleration by installing the above mentioned packages (xvba-va-driver, libva-glx1 and vainfo) on top of proprietary fglrx, check here, under \"availability.\"\nI haven't tested 12.6. and unless I have to, I won't for a while: I've had my share of trial and error and reading forums for awhile.\nWhat I'll be curious to see is power management (fan action and noise) of the open source drivers. Once I have substantial experience with that I'll post it here, anyone else is welcome to do the same (if it's allowed by AskUbuntu rules.)\n\nA: Try disabling compositing in the window manager settings or x server config file. If you don't need the fancy effects this should not be an issue.\nIn xfce it's in settings manager -> window manager tweaks -> compositor tab.\nIn xorg.conf:\nSection \"Extensions\"\n    Option \"Composite\" \"Disable\"\nEndSection\n\nI had the exact same problem, every tool reported that hw acceleration was working for video and 3d and still playback was choppy and cpu usage was high for 1080p videos. I have fglrx 15.201 from stock package on Ubuntu Studio 15.10 for my radeon hd 5770. The open source driver handled video playback cleanly, however it does not support opencl currently which I need.\nNot sure yet why but it seems like compositing is done in software when the fglrx driver is used and works in hardware when the open source driver is used. This of course is a huge performance drain for full hd video playback. Mplayer logs a warning about compositing if it is enabled, can be useful for testing other playback issues as well because of the detailed messages it provides when you run it from a terminal window.\nThere should be a way to enable hardware accelerated compositing when using the fglrx driver but I don't know of it yet.\n", "Q: Must I enable the root account to install Matlab? I'm trying to install Matlab R20112a on Ubuntu.\nMy problem is: I get access to the installation gui running ./install from a terminal, but the installer fails when it tries to write on the folder /usr/local/MATLAB/R2012a (even though I created this folder before running the installation). \nI assume the problem is I need root privileges, but \"root\" is disabled in ubuntu.\nI can install the program in my home folder, but this is not a good solution because I want access to the program for all users.\n\nA: As explained here, you do not need to enable root logins to run commands as root. That's what sudo and its graphical frontends (like gksu/gksudo and kdesudo) are for.\nSince install runs a graphical installer, and you can run it (but not as root) like ./install, you can run it as root with:\ngksu ./install\n\n\nA: Try running gksudo ./install from the terminal. This will run the install as root.\n\nA: I tried the gksudo method but nothing happened.\nHere's what worked for me: Download and install furius.iso, then mount the ISO.\nOpen the mounted image, and copy the installer's filename into the terminal. Then, type \"./install\" and when it asks you where to install, change it to /home/your_user, ~/ or so.

This can be done from the command line on the host with:\nVBoxManage sharedfolder add \"VM name\" --name sharename --hostpath \"C:\\test\"\n\nBy adding the option --readonly we can restrict these for read-only access. Use the --transient option if you only want the shares to appear in the present session but not persistent for following sessions. There are some limitations for shared folders (see this question for details). If prerequisites are met we may mount these shared folders manually by running the following commands in the guest:\nmkdir /home/<user>/vboxshare\nsudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 sharename /home/<user>/vboxshare  \n\nOf course, we can also use different mount options to mount as read/only or mount with read access only to root.\nAuto-Mount through Virtual Box Manager\nIn case we enabled auto-mounting on creating a shared folder from the Virtual Box Manager those shared folders will automatically be mounted in the guest with mount point /media/sf_<name_of_folder>.

I installed PowerTOP 1.97 and i got many Bad in Tunables, I know i can press enter to toggle but does it really change anything? and if it does will it still be changed when i reboot? If i get everything to show Good will it make a big difference on the battery life?\n\n\nA: Despite this question is specifically about battery life, I am adding this as an answer because the comment space is to small. Desktop users might just want to reduce power consumption too. That is why I did four 8 hour running power consumption measurements in September 2014 at the wall socket (230VAC 50Hz) with recent Haswell hardware.\nThe measured Average monthly kWh* after 8 hours of running in an idle state are:\n\n*\n\n*None: 11.73\n\n*Minimal: 8.69\n\n*\"Optimal\": 8.36\n\n*Auto-tune: 8.35\nFor recent hard- and software you might want to enable all powertop tunables.\nQuick wins are enabling PCIe ASPM for the network interfaces, and verify that your package goes to state pc6 or lower.\n\nThe different measurements - based on groups of optimizations - are named:\n\n*\n\n*None, autosuspend for USB devices is enabled => pc3\n\n*Minimal, enabled PCIe ASPM and SATA LPM => pc6\n\n*Optimal, containing a set of optimised settings inspired by the suggestions from Colin Ian King, trying to enabled only gains and keep losses disabled:\n\n*\n\n*Turn off NMI watchdog,\n\n*Enable VM writeback timeout,\n\n*Enable runtime PM for E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor PCIe x16 controller\n\n*Enable runtime PM for 4th Gen Core Processor DRAM controller\n\n*Enable runtime PM for Realtek RTL8111/8168/8411 PCIe gigabit controller\n\n*Enable wake-on-lan status for device p5p1\n\n\n\n*Powertop --auto_tune, most optimal tunings according to powertop tuning.\n\n* higher numbers mean more energy consumption and shorter battery life; Average monthly kWh = watt hours/elapsed time/30 days; watt hours equal watts multiplied by time. For instance, a 25 watt bulb plugged in for 1 hour will consume 25 watt hours. In two hours, it will have consumed 50 watt hours.\nIn this case an ASRock H81 Pro BTC P1.80, a Celeron G1840, two G.skill DDR3L modules, an OCZ Vertex SSD, no USB devices attached, 100mbps ethernet connected and a platinum-80plus-rated Supermicro PSU PWS-341H-1H powering it. The measurement device is a \"Watts up?\" meter. The room temperature as around 25-28ºC. The mainboard temperature is around 33-34ºC. The kernel is Ubuntu amd64 version 3.13.0-35-generic. Powertop is release version 2.5. Idle state means that the powertop screen \"Idle stats\" was shown in a remote SSH session. Between measuring each different group of settings the system was powered down and disconnected from the power source for at least 5 minutes. \n\nA: The Good/Bad settings may or may not help, it really depends on the hardware. Some settings are marginal, others save a fraction of a Watt, others may actually not help at all.  Here is some analysis I did late 2011. I used a high precision digital multi-meter and an Atom 450 \"HPMini 210-1000\" and a Sandy Bridge \"Lenovo ThinkPad 220i\" machine to sanity check all the powertop settings for the candidate machines.\nPowertop tunables that resulted in gains\n\n*\n\n*Autosuspend for USB device HP Webcam-50: 2.6%\n\n*Wireless power saving for interface wlan0: 8.5%\n\n*Wireless power saving for interface wlan0: 0.5%\n\n*Autosuspend for USB device Broadcom Bluetooth device: 6.4%\n\n*Enable SATA link power management for /dev/sda: 0.4%\n\n*Enable Audio codec power management: 0.5%\n\n*Runtime PM for PCI device Intel 2nd gen Core proc.

Some batteries are not that accurate since they sometimes re-calibrate their capacity settings. So one can get some wild fluctuations in battery readings.

Some parts of wikipedia appear differently when you're logged in.  I would like to wget user pages so they would appear as if I was logged in.\nIs there a way I can wget user pages like this\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:A\n\nthis is the login page:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Login&campaign=ACP3\n\n\nA: ###The easy way: login with your browser,and give the cookies to wget\nEasiest method: in general, you need to provide wget or curl with the (logged-in) cookies from a particular website for them to fetch pages as if you were logged in.\nIf you are using Firefox, it's easy to do via the cookie.txt add-on. Install the add-on, and:\n\n*\n\n*Click on the plugin and save the cookies.txt file (you can change the filename/destination).\n\n\n*Open up a terminal, and use wget with the --load-cookies=FILENAME option, e.g.\n wget --load-cookies=cookies.txt http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:A\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*For curl, it's curl --cookie cookies.txt ...\n(I will try to update this answer for Chrome/Chromium users)\n###The hard way: use curl (preferably) or wget to manage the entire session\n\n*\n\n*A detailed how-to is beyond the scope of this answer, but you use curl with the --cookie-jar or wget with the --save-cookies --keep-session-cookiesoptions, along with the HTTP/S PUT method to log in to a site, save the login cookies, and then use them to simulate a browser.\n\n*Needless to say, this requires going through the HTML source for the login page (get input field names, etc.), and is often difficult to get to work for sites using anything beyond simple login/password authentication.\n\n*Tip: if you go this route, it is often much simpler to deal with the mobile version of a website (if available), at least for the authentication step.\n\n\nA: With cURL is really easy to handle cookies in both ways.\ncurl www.target-url.com -c cookie.txt then will save a file named cookie.txt. But you need to log in, so need to use --data with arguments like: curl -X --data \"var1=1&var2=2\" www.target-url.com/login.php -c cookie.txt.\nOnce you get loggued cookie you can send it with: \ncurl www.target-url.com/?user-page.php -b cookie.txt\nJust use -c (--cookie) or -b (--cookie-jar) to save and send.\nNote1: Using cURL CLI is a lot of easier than PHP and maybe faster ;)\nFor save the final content you can easily add > filename.html to your cURL command then save full html code.\nNote2 about \"full\": Yo cannot render javascript with cURL, just get the source code.\n\nA: For those still interested in this questions, there's a very useful Chrome extension called CurlWGet that allows you to generate a wget / curl request with authentication measures, etc. with one click. To install this extension, follow the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the extension from the Chrome Webstore.\n\n*Go the web page that would you like to download.\n\n*Start the download.\n\n*The extension will generate a link for you.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nA: have a look at cliget for Firefox.\nWhen you're about to download, on the final download dialog you get the option to copy the download as curl command line to the clipboard.\n\nA: Another easy solution that worked for me without installing anything extra:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Network\" tab of \"Web Developer\" tool: Ctrl-Shift-E\n\n*Visit the page you want to save (e.g. a photo behind a login)\n\n*Right click the request and choose 'Copy'->'Copy as cURL'\nThis will give you a command that you can paste directly into your shell, that has all your cookie credentials e.g.\ncurl 'https://mysite.test/my-secure-dir/picture1.jpg' \\ \n-H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 ...' \\\n-H 'Cookie: SESSIONID=abcdef1234567890'\n\nYou can then modify the URL in the command to fetch whatever you want.\n\nA: The blog post Wget with Firefox Cookies shows how to access the sqlite data file in which Firefox stores its cookies. That way one doesn't need to manually export the cookies for use with wget. A comment suggests that it doesn't work with session cookies, but it worked fine for the sites I tried it with.\n\nA: Have you tried this?\nwget --user=username --password=password http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:A\n\n\nA: Try something like:\nwget --keep-session-cookies --save-cookies cookies.txt --post-data 'user=goyamy&passwrd=mypassword' http://forum.ubuntu-it.org/\n\nSee also this link:\nHow to download this webpage with wget?\n\nA: For more complicated website based logins you should also consider to use a Python script and some module which imitates a browser, like http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/ instead of curl or wget.\nThis way session cookies are handled automatically, you can follow links and fill login forms, and so \"script\" yourself through the login process as if using your web browser.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server installation freezes during installation I have an old Gateway Tower that was running Windows XP, but after XP stopped working on me, I decided to make it into a server, and install Ubuntu Server.\nBUT, it keeps freezing on me.\nDuring this setup, this happened once to me while I was Selecting the keyboard layout, but now, it happened after I partioned the disk.

I have an Acer which has an Intel i5 sandy bridge and an AMD HD 6650m. I want to install AMD graphics drivers. Will this cause conflict between the Intel HD3000 and AMD hd 6650m? If so, how do I resolve it? (Using Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit)\n\nA: What is switchable graphics?\nYour laptop has switchable graphics, i.e. an Intel graphics card built into the i5 CPU, and a discrete AMD graphics card. Using Windows drivers on Windows, this is supposed to let the OS intelligently switch between the two depending on whether games, 3D graphics, etc. are being run or whether the system is just being used for normal tasks like browsing, office apps, etc.\nNot officially supported by Linux\nUnfortunately, this automatic switching is not officially supported on Linux or Ubuntu, because the AMD drivers are proprietary (not open source).\nNo conflict, but AMD card will be \"always on\"; you can try vgaswitcheroo\nYou can install the AMD drivers, and especially should if you will be gaming. They will not conflict with the internal Intel HD graphics, but you should be aware of the following:\n\n*\n\n*No automatic switching\n\n*AMD card will always be \"on\", resulting in no or very little power saving\n\n*\n\n*You can only turn it off and use Intel only if this option is supported in your laptop's BIOS (and many don't)\n\n\n\n*You can try using the vgaswitcheroo option to manually enable/disable the AMD card from within Ubuntu. See this Ubuntu wiki for details.\n\n\nA: I have the same hardware setup in a Lenovo G770 (core i5, RadeonHD 6650m, Intel HD3000), and have been very successful enabling switchable graphics with the proprietary ATI/AMD Catalyst driver. I have not noticed any conflicts, and it's only very slightly buggy every now and then (i.e. scrambled color and/or tearing for a few seconds while logging in) - other than that, it works very nicely. I have had occasional issues with resume/suspend while using it, but I suspect that issue has to do with Compiz as opposed to the Catalyst driver, as suspend/resume still works fine in Gnome-Shell.

I just restarted my server and now when I boot up one of my Ubuntu 11.04 Server instances I am greeted with errors. It doesn't boot up. \nI am pretty sure this is not a hardware error as I have other servers that are successfully booting up. In case it is relevant, all of these machines are running on a Proxmox server.\nI tried running the recovery tool but I am not having any luck solving anything. When I try to mount /dev/sda1 in recovery it looks like there is nothing but the kernel on the disk. What can I try?? Needless to say I really don't want to reinstall Ubuntu and wipe my disk clean.\nThanks!\nEdit: When I try to mount the root partition and go in the target folder I only get:\n\nIt looks like I am supposed to mount the /dev/WEBAPPS-LOCAL/root drive to the /target folder, but when I do I get a \"Segmentation fault\" error.\n\nA: OK, first of all this appears to be a KVM running on Proxmox, right?\n/dev/sda1 appears to be a separate boot partition (/boot). You are probably looking to set /dev/sda2 as the target in recovery mode, which should contain /, /sbin, /proc etc. where the problem lies (can't find init).\nBased on the segfaults you get, it looks like the root ilesystem on /dev/sda2 may be corrupted. Please run sudo fsck on it; you may have to attach an Ubuntu LiveCD ISO to your KVM and boot from that to be able to do so.\nA screenshot of the full text preceding the segmentation fault on boot up (see cutoff portion in first screenshot) might also be helpful.\n\nA: It looks like my disk was corrupted. The root disk in the Proxmox environment looks like it is: /dev/WEBAPPS-LOCAL/root.\nWhen I ran the Live CD I could not mount this target as I got a seg fault. I couldn't run fsck after I tried this: it said I couldn't fsck something that was mounted. It must have been in some intermittent state.\nI reran the LiveCD again, went into Recovery mode and this time attempted to run no disks as root. Then in the shell I ran fsck against /dev/WEBAPPS-LOCAL/root and it made some fixes.

I have used ubuntu for almost 6 months full time at home while using windows for almost 6 years,so I previously used ubuntu on separate hard drive while I have one attached hard drive with partitions having NTFS file system so I used data from those partitions also. Now I want to again shift to ubuntu as I am a web developer and want to use ubuntu and I have a hp probook. So I just want to know few things:\nShould I use wubi? But I have heard it is on windows installtion mercy still that is not good. \nShould I use dual boot and configure it separately without any wubi e.t.c.?\nOr should I install separate ubuntu on whole hard disk?\nIt seems like 3rd option is good but main concern in that case is that how will my data be safe? Like if my ubuntu is corrupted or need to install again or uninstall in any case, then I will need to format whole disk and all my data will be deleted as it is on unpartitioned space. So this seems to be unsafe. Actually I am not sure, but another option I have is to have some partitions and some unpartitioned space and install ubuntu on unpartitioned space and if I will remove ubuntu at some time or it will be removed some how then I will have my data safe in partitioned space. The way I am thinking really make sense? I have been actually windows user so may be thinking in that way, and want to know that how mostly people use ubuntu while feeling safe about their data. What is best way to use ubuntu?\nPlease tell whatever you know so that I can understand the way better.\nthanks\n\nA: I would definitely recommend the third choice.\nLike you said, the first choice is bad since you're basically running within Windows. The second choice is alright, but if you can run Ubuntu on a separate HDD that would be best in my opinion.\nIf Ubuntu gets corrupted, there's no need for you to format the drive or partitions before recovering your data. If you're going to be running Windows as well, you can access the Linux partitions, granted that you don't encrypt them (if you do I'm sure you still can I just don't know how)\nWIndows 7 can natively read Ext2, 3 and 4. If you're using an earlier version of Windows you can download and use ext2fsd to view the linux partitions.\n", "Q: How do I select a field/column from the output of `ls -l`? My goal is deceptively simple (at least to me). I wish to take the output of ls -l or ls -lh and select just one field.\nI am looking for this to be as bulletproof as possible, by which I mean, assume that filenames can have a variable number of spaces, not everything in the field has the same length, etc.\nBonus points for having a script that will take the name of the the field (or even just a field number), and then return the contents of the field.\nI want to turn\n\ninto:\n\n\nA: Try ls -l | awk '{print $7}'.\nawk selects columns so it's perfect for this task.\n\nA: Never parse ls. Use GNU find. Or if portability isn't important, stat(1).\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -printf '%Td\\n'\n\nFor reading data other than lists of filenames line-by-line and splitting into fields, see: BashFAQ/001\nThere are no methods to reliably read a newline-delimited list of filenames that make sense under most circumstances.\n\nA: You may fetch the specific column in shell like:\nls -al | while read perm bsize user group size month day time file; do echo $day; done\n\nor awk as shown in @Corey answer, cut -c44-45 would also work  after adjustment (since ls has fixed columns) , or whatever else, however the main problem is that it won't be reliable and bulletproof (e.g. on Unix it may be $6, not $7, and it changes depending on arguments) making it not machine-friendly therefore it is not recommended to parse ls command at all.\nThe best is to use different available commands such as find or stat, which can provide relevant options to format the output as you need. For example:\n$ stat -c \"%x %n\" *\n2016-04-10 04:53:07.000000000 +0100 001.txt\n2016-04-10 05:08:42.000000000 +0100 7c1c.txt\n\nTo return column of only days of modifications, try this example:\nstat -c \"%x\" * | while read ymd; do date --date=\"$ymd\" \"+%d\"; done\n\nIt's worth to note that GNU stat could have different options to BSD stat, so it still won't be bulletproof across different operating systems.\n", "Q: How safe is upgrading to 12.04 Being new to Ubuntu I try to avoid any install without looking for problems others have experienced. The upgrade to 12.04 seems to have had quite a few users experience problems.  Do these generally get resolved or are they sometimes bugs? Is there an approach that can be used to determine the impact on particular applications, or a list of known problem apps?\nUpdate: Desktop, new with on board graphics. I guess I am just trying to get a handle on how smoothly upgrades are in general with Ubuntu. I am on 11 and shortly after got advised of the upgrade to 12 being available.\nI do not think I have any special apps yet, but did install kubuntu too. Although switched back to Ubuntu most of the time. But seeing lots of the problems relate to basics like ethernet connections got a little nervous as I have no idea of the size of userbase and whether the experienced problems are a rarity or common issues. Do such issues feed back to devs and result in a maintenance release if a bug is uncovered for example.\n\nA: At this point, as long as you are upgrading from 11.X you shouldn't experience any issues. I upgraded from 11.10 and had no issues initially, but after a few reboots I ran into a weird DNS issue. I don't know the exact cause to this date. But I suspect it had something to do with the resolvconf configuration. This was a known bug which has been addressed and is no longer an issue.\nI would go for the upgrade to 12.04 LTS, but as always, make sure you have a backup. If your disk isn't too large you can use Partimage. It is extremely easy to use, supports compression, and will only backup the used portion of your partition. In addition to the partimage backup, I would also backup your config files in the /etc/ directory.\n\nA: I also upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04; uptil now things are working pretty good for me. So, would not be an issue at for you too.\n", "Q: virutalbox always get back the same ip I exported a virtual machine from my work station, and I am trying to renew the ip-address at home.

Basically I am trying to get 12.04 installed on my MBP 8,2 with graphics card switching working in some way or another. My basic understanding is that I need to do an EFI boot install of ubuntu so that graphics card switching will work (due to the hardware design). From there I may be able to use one of the kernel modules for graphics switching:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics\nThat article isn't clear on whether I need to do an EFI install. I have also seen comments in posts here that say and EFI install works by default as long as you have refit installed. Overall, I'm quite lost as to the simplest way to proceed to get an install up and running with graphics switching. I don't mind using open source GFX drivers as long as the basics work. \nAny help towards a solution is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I can't help on the graphics card switching, but I've got a Web page that details one way of installing Ubuntu in EFI mode on Macs:\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/ubuntu-efi/index.html\nThe procedure is much too long to describe fully here, but in brief, it involves doing a BIOS-mode install and then booting and ripping out the BIOS-mode stuff and replacing it with EFI-mode stuff. There may well be other ways to do this, and the optimal methods may well vary from one model to another, so this is very much a \"use at your own risk\" sort of proposition, no matter how you do it.\n\nA: You need to run your mac in EFI mode for the switching to work properly. And there is no need to be ripping the bios stuff.\nI'm successfully using hybrid graphics on my Macbook Pro 8.2. \nThis howto should be enough to allow you to switch between gfx cards\nHow to switch between Gfx cards on Macbook Pro 15\" 8.2\n", "Q: unexpected EOF and end of document I have been fiddling with this code for a few days.

Where do we have a call to 'bash' with a -c (command) option?\nA: inside the as_user() function, we have a call:\nbash -c \"$1\"\n\nNow, $1 here is the first argument passed to the as_user() function, so we look again at the script and find where as_user() is being called, and with which argument.\nSome of these arguments are complex with 3 levels of escaping/quoting so they are suspect.\nYou may add a simple debugging statement inside 'as_user' as the first line before anything else gets executed:\necho '$1 is:' $1\n\nWhich would print the command just before the failure, and make it obvious what the bad argument is.\nMore generally: you can conveniently debug shell scripts by adding tracing (aka 'echo').\nSimply change the 1st line of the script to:\n #!/bin/bash -x\n\nand every command would be printed just before it is executed, making the connection between the call and the error obvious.  There's also -v (verbose) which will print every line as it is parsed, before all history/command/param/file expansions, but I find -v much less useful when debugging than -x.  In rare cases I just use both: -vx to track the expansions that happen before execution in detail.\nHTH\n\nA: After counting the characters in your script (a SMOP), I noticed that you had \nan ODD number (49) of \"'\" characters.

I have installed 12.04 on a separate partition, and can mount the drive containing my old Evolution files.\nWhat I want to do is:\nImport all the data from my Old (11.10) evolution location (~/.local/john/share/evolution is the location I've seen in other posts, but I'm not sure which sub-folders I need) into evolution on the new (12.04) partition.  Since the old OS is totally hosed, I can't boot to it in order to use Evolution's functionality to export and move folders around, etc, like I've seen in other posts.\nAny suggestions on how I can rescue all the emails and contains from the old location would be greatly appreciated!\nPS.  I have a POP account and a Gmail account at the old install. The Gmail I'm not too worried about, but the pop mail is no longer on my ISP server, so I need a way to save it from the old location.\nedit:  I don't care whether I end up with evolution or Thunderbird as a result - whichever will work to import or migrate the old emails.\n\nA: The following is an excerpt from the Ubuntu Community Documentation for Migrating Evolution to a New Computer with a slight modification according to your installation:\n\nProcedure\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Run these two commands on both the source and the target computer (these stop the programs that might interfere with your\n  copy):\ngconftool-2 --shutdown\n\nevolution --force-shutdown\n\n  \n*Copy the directories ~/.local/share/evolution, ~/.gconf/apps/evolution and ~/.gnome2_private/Evolution from the\n  source computer to the same place on the target computer.\n  \n*Start Evolution on the target computer (this will automatically start the programs that you stopped in step 1).\nNote: Take care not to start any Gnome applications between steps 1 and 2, as these will automatically restart the programs that you want\n  to have stopped.\n\n", "Q: Problems while  installing Ubuntu 12.04 64 & 32 bits from LiveCd I am trying to install Ubuntu on my new pc but I am encountering problems. When I boot from the installation CD, everything runs fine until the \"window\" when the user has to decide to Try Ubuntu or Install it in the machine.\nWell that \"window\" appears in blank, and  my mouse and keyboard behaves really slow. I can't do anything , so i have to shut it down by pressing power button.\nThe specification of my pc are this\n\n\n*\n\n*Motherboard: Gigabyte ex58 ud7\n\n*CPU: i7 950\n\n*HD: Western digital caviar black\n\n*Int. memory: 6gb memory corsair\n\n*Graphics: evga gtx580\n\n\nI really need to install Ubuntu or another Linux distribution, i am using de seismic Unix program {Edit :  Guess it is this} on my laptop. I hope someone can help me.\n\nA: The problem is occurring at the graphical window where you are asked if you want to Try Ubuntu or Install Ubuntu. Assuming you've made sure the installation media is good, the next thing you might want to try doing is just skipping that window altogether.\nIf you hold down the Shift key when you see the keyboard and person icons at the bottom of the purple boot screen, you'll get a menu. (This is the same menu where you may have selected \"Check disc for defects.\")\nSelect Try Ubuntu without installing from that menu. This should give you a desktop, without ever giving you the ubiquity-dm window where you are asked graphically to choose.\n\n\n*\n\n*There are two ways to choose between Try Ubuntu and Install Ubuntu. One is graphically--the GUI loads, and gives you the choice in a window. That functionality is provided by a program called ubiquity-dm. It looks like the problem might be with that. The other way is to prevent ubiquity-dm from ever showing that window, by choosing which you want before the GUI loads. That's what you're doing when you press Shift and select Try Ubuntu without installing (or Install Ubuntu) from the non-graphical boot menu.\n\n\nIf that works, you can use Ubuntu from the live CD, and you can install it by double-clicking on the Install Ubuntu icon on the desktop or in the Unity launcher (the vertical bar on the left side of the screen).\n\nA: when your installation start, on main menu, pres F6 and then select first two options(from above), press Esc and continue with your installation.\n\nA: \nMost often this happens because you have a bad disc. This is\n  especially likely if you've already installed the same version of\n  Ubuntu on this machine before, and didn't have that problem.\nThe disc could have been damaged, or it could have started out bad\n  (for example, due to a bad ISO image).\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Check it for defects on the machine you want to install it on. (That way, the disc gets checked, and so does the computer/drive's\n  ability to read it.)\n  \n*If that fails, make sure to MD5 test your ISO image before using it to make a new disc. If that fails, you'll have to download a\n  new ISO image.\nIf all else fails, please consider using the text-based Alternate\n  CD which contains a text-only installer to sidestep any graphics\n  issues.\n\nOriginally posted by Eliah Kagan and izx (see revision history).\n", "Q: Desktop can't delete file because thunar was replaced by nautilus (Xubuntu 12.04) My problem is really simple:\nI've replaced Thunar with Nautilus in my Xubuntu 12.04 installation (64 Bit); I removed Thunar completely. Everything works fine in the computer except for the desktop: If I try to delete a file that is in the desktop for example, The attempt fails complaining of Thunar not being installed on the system. If I reinstall thunar everything works as expected, but I don't want to keep thunar on the system. How to Fix This?\nThanks!\n\nA: Research indicates that there are issues between Thunar and Nautilus.\nReplacing Thunar with Nautilus?:\n\nThe desktop component doesn't play well yet with the filemanager because it is using the dbus interface of thunar directly.\n\nThunar File Manager:\n\nIt does not play nice (at all) when copying out of it's own Thunar window and into the Nautilus window.\n\nMy own experience is that I cannot cut/copy/drag files directly from the desktop to a Nautilus window.  I get the following 2 errors:\nError while moving \"New Folder \".\nThere was an error moving the file into /home/****/From Desktop.\nError moving file: No such file or directory\n\nError while moving.\nThere was an error getting information about \"\".\nOperation not supported\n\nI get exactly the same errors when attempting to copy/cut/drag from a Thunar window to a Nautilus window.\nWorkarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Thunar file manager when working directly with the desktop (cut/copy/drag)\n\n*Do all of your file operations from within Nautilus itself\n\n\nSo even if Thunar has been completely removed from the system, you should still be able use workaround #2.\nApplies to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xubuntu 12.04\n\n*Nautilus 3.4.2\n\n*Thunar 1.2.3\n\n\nA: Try uninstalling the xubuntu-default-settings package.

Just recently my laptop has started behaving weird. It often hangs after a short while of using it (perhaps half an hour), and memory usage is very high. I have 4 GB of memory, and after startup it often uses around 3.8 GB of memory.\nThis screenshot shows what processes are running and how much memory is used:\nhttp://postimage.org/image/nk4muoxel/\n\nI don't think I have installed any new software before this started happening, and I can't think of anything else causing it. My laptop is a few years old now and perhaps it isn't of the best quality, but I don't know if it's possible that some hardware problem could be causing this.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: \"top\" shows how much memory is used including the file caches. This is mostly useless if you try to trouble-shoot memory usage.\nTry following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use \"free\" command to see how much memory is actually used, excluding the caches.\n\n*Use \"top\" and press Shift+M to sort processes by memory used.\n\n\nNormally linux uses all available memory to cache file data - this is exactly what you want it to do as it improves performance. This memory is available anytime to applications if they need it.\nFrom your screen-shot, it is visible that no swap is used so this is a very good indication that you have no memory usage problem.\n", "Q: Shows \"unable to locate package unzip\" error I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 server , shows  \nE:unable to locate the package unzip\n\nthe above error is also shown, if I try to install packages also.

Posting the answer here in case anybody else experiences this issue.\nDownloads a windows boot CD from here (Boot_CD.iso):\nhttp://www.gskill.us/forum/showthread.php?t=7171\nDownloaded the latest NEC firmware (version 4.0.2.0) from here:\nhttp://www.station-drivers.com/index.php?option=com_remository&Itemid=352&func=select&id=196&lang=en\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn iso file to CD.\n\n*Copy firmware .exe file to a USB key.\n\n*Reboot computer/laptop with Boot CD in drive.\n\n*Once booted you should be presented with a DOS prompt.\n\n*Insert USB key containing firmware .exe.\n\n*Navigate to C: and run firmware executable to extract the firmware files.\n\n*Change to 'firmware' sub directory, and run 'uPD720200_uPD720200A_FW_Updater.exe'\n\n*Reboot laptop/computer and check is USB3.0 ports work under Ubuntu.\n\n\nA: Because the other answers might have some in-accuracies, here is the pairing between devices, revisions and firmware revisions:\nuPD720200a -> rev.4 -> firmware 4.x.x.x and maybe 3.x.x.x\nuPD720200 -> rev.3 -> firmware 3.x.x.x only\nThe question might have been about revision 3 but some answers seem to talk about revision 4. Please take care for not beeing misled.\n\nA: Worked for me after updating the firmware to version 4.0.2.0 for a uPD720200a controller card and applying power to the 4-pin Molex connector on the card.\n\nA: This fixed very quirky USB 3 port in Lenovo T420s in linux.\nI installed the manufacturer firmware update in Windows 10 instead of following Jagged's procedure.\nNote: Unlike as stated in Alexander Stohr post, I was able to update the newest 4.0.2.0 / rev.4 firmware to uPD720200(non-a). I think the firmware manufacturer just forgot to add both models to all file names in that uPD720200/720200a folder hence the confusion.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 does not Shut Down at all and gets Stuck on 3 or 4 dots Ubuntu 12.04 does not Shut Down at all and gets Stuck on 3 or 4 dots.\nI am using a PC with Pentium 4 processor, 1.9GHz, 1GB RAM.\nI tried using the command sudo shutdown now, but it gets stuck again at the Logo screen with dots.\nAnd none of the answers seem to help me here. Please help with a gentler solution to shut down.\nBut restart works fine, the problem is only with shutting down.\n\nA: To shut down and power off from the command-line with shutdown, the correct command is actually:\nsudo shutdown -P now\n\nHowever, if that doesn't work, press Escape when you first see the splash screen with the dots. That should show the messages \"behind\" the splash screen. Then update your question (by editing it) with the full and exact text of the messages you see.\n\nA: The correct command is sudo shutdown -h now. Try this.

I am using the command mac in terminal to compress and decompress Monkey's Audio files. However, I want to find a way to do it to more than one file at a time. Is there a trick for the mac program that I don't know, or is there another program that can help?\nI'm stuck using the Window's GUI under WINE. Help free me from this :)\n\nA: No, mac does one file at a time, so you have to work around it.\nAssuming the files you want to encode/decode are in specific folders, or sub-folders, and not arbitrary paths, you can do it with a combination of find, sed and xargs.\nFor example, to encode all WAV files in a specific folder and all its subfolders, with the output files simply having the APE extension, using the fast -c1000 preset, you would type:\nfind ~/path/to/folder -name *.wav | sed 's/....$//g' \\\n   | xargs -I MACFILE mac \"MACFILE.wav\" \"MACFILE.ape\" -c1000\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*find finds all files with the wav extension in and under the given path, and outputs them.\n\n*\n\n*You can use `pwd` (with the backticks) as shorthand for the current folder.\n\n*Add the argument -maxdepth 0 to stick to the current folder only and not go into subfolders.\n\n\n*The sed expression deletes (i.e. replaces with \"blank\") the last four characters of each filename returned by find, which is the extension .wav or .ape\n\n*xargs feeds each filename piped in to the mac command.\n\n*\n\n*The -I MACFILE tells xargs to replace each occurrence of MACFILE with the input (filename); this way we get files with proper extensions and not .wav.ape, etc.\n\n\n\n\nTo decode within the current folder only, and output to a custom folder, for example:\nfind `pwd` -name *.ape -maxdepth 0 | sed 's/....$//g' \\\n   | xargs -I MACFILE mac \"MACFILE.ape\" \"/home/ryan/decodes/MACFILE.wav\" -d\n\n\n\nNote: find is one of those utilities that are almost limitless (see man find). With the right -exec and -printf options (and maybe more), find may alone be sufficient without needing the sed and xargs, and I'm sure someone will point that out :) . But I find this easier to explain and understand.\n\n", "Q: How to grant standard users access to disk partitions and flash storage?

FreeSans looks a little different from Arial, but it too is rendered squashed/stretched like Arial on both FF & Chrome. Opera renders the Wikipedia page differently from FF & Chrome, but the fonts looks squashed/stretched on it as well.\n\nI used to run Kubuntu prior to switching to Ubuntu and at some point I managed to get the fonts on Chrome (only Chrome) look exactly like in the image on the left. I have no idea how I did it though. Firefox and Rekonq retained the squashed/stretched look.\nI had been using Rekonq for a while, then switched to FF. While using both browsers I had done various things to get the fonts to look better on them with no success - like installing MS fonts & configuring both browsers to use them. I then, after some time, installed Chrome and the fonts magically looked perfect on them - just like on right-hand side of the image. In fact, the font smoothing looked better (to my eye) compared to Windows and OSX. All 3 OSes use subtly different font smoothing strategies and the differences stand out.\nLater, I formatted & installed Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe first thing I did was install msttcorefonts & then install Chrome. To my dismay, the fonts on Chrome looked just as squashed/stretched as it did in Firefox. There's no browser (except Wine Internet Explorer) that renders fonts properly on my Ubuntu setup right now.\nFixing this is definitely possible, since I was able to do it on Kubuntu, but apparently it requires some mysterious tweaking. Would anyone be willing to help me out?\n\nA: Wine doesn’t use the same FreeType rendering configuration that the rest of the system, and thus fonts look different.\nIf you want all applications to render fonts like Wine does, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Gnome Tweak Tool (click here if you don’t have it installed).\n\n*Go to the “Fonts” section.\n\n*In the “Hinting” dropdown, select “Full” or “Medium”, according to your preference.\n\n\nA: This problem never really was solved for me. I still don't have a perfect of working solution to this. Also, I should note: I got Arial to render properly (and beautifully) on Kubuntu (back in 2012).\nBut I unfortunately don't know how my Kubuntu installation managed to get the MS fonts rendered beautifully. I actually still have the very same ancient Kubuntu installation (it's on 14.04 Trusty Tahr, which hit its end-of-life in May 2019), but it's on an old desktop computer that I don't use anymore. I recall it kind of magically happened after I installed the proprietary Nvidia driver, but later it worked even without an Nvidia chip (on an Intel driver). One day, I'll need to look into and analyze exactly how Kubuntu on that computer manages to render fonts well.\nI switched to Arch on my laptops, which I actively/primarily use.\nFor Arch, I found this somewhat viable round-about solution to the ugly font rendering: https://aswinmohan.me/posts/better-fonts-on-linux/\n", "Q: How to install skype 4 without internet? I was already download skype 4 from official website(.deb) \nWhen i double click and trying to install it with Software Center it trying to download it from the internet. (and i guess the older version)\nBecause im new in ubuntu - that behavior totally strange for me. So... why it acting like that and how to install that version from official website?\nThx\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Go to the folder where you downloaded the .deb file, most probably in Downloads, with cd Downloads\n\n*Type sudo dpkg -i skype-ubuntu and press Tab to automatically fill in the full filename.\n\n*Press Enter, and your password when asked, and Skype should be installed.\n\n\nIf you are missing the status icon in the panel, please see this question for a solution.\nHow do I get the Skype status icon back? (on panel/tray)\n\nA: I think the reason is because there are missing dependencies that need to be installed first, before Skype can be installed.\nThe way package management works (on Ubuntu & other distros), is that when you install something (like Skype) it first installs everything that Skype needs to run. This could be something like a audio library that Skype depends. The .deb file contains a list of dependencies for that package. The package manager (Ubuntu Software Center, Synaptic or the command-line apt-get) will read the .deb file; make sure all dependencies are present, if not, install them first before installing the package.\nIf you run dpkg --info bla.deb where you replace blah.deb with the package of your choice, you should among other things find out what packages it depends on. The dependencies would be listed next to \"Depends: ...\" Making sure all of those dependencies are present on the system should ensure a smooth internet-less installation. I understand this could be hard, especially since those dependencies themselves might have other dependencies. In fact installing a package with a deep dependency tree without an Internet connection will be difficult and challenging.\nYou would have to enumerate all dependencies for the package (e.g. Skype) you are installing; obtain .deb files for all their dependencies; see what dependencies those dependencies have; and repeat recursively till you have .deb files for the entire tree of dependencies on your computer. This is something best done programatically. Unless there's a program that does this already (I don't know of any), you would have to write one of your own.\n\nA: When you go through the Software Center, it downloads the packages and installs. Since you already have the .deb package, all you need to do is open it, and it will install. If you are more comfortable with the terminal, you can do\nsudo dpkg -i skype-v4.deb\n\nOf course, replace skype-v4.deb with the actual name of your file.\n", "Q: xubuntu 12.04 totally refuses to boot after install with wubi on old computer. any tips or suggestions on things i can do to fix this problem? I downloaded Xubuntu 12.04 32-bit (the desktop CD ISO, not the alternate CD) from xubuntu.org and placed the .zip into a folder named XUBUNTU on my desktop.\nThen I extracted the files to that folder and ran Wubi. I selected Xubuntu from the drop down menu and clicked Install. I let it do it's thing and then chose the option to reboot when prompted. This is when i went to my girlfriend's house for the day and left my laptop (dell latitude 120L) to finish the install. i came back home (about 8 hours later) to find my computer on the windows 7 log in screen when i rebooted my computer once more. I booted Xubuntu just fine and things seemed to work perfectly. I turned off the pc and went to bed. Next morning I booted Xubuntu again without problems.\nI rebooted and went to Windows, then next time I tried booting Xubuntu in the middle of the splash screen it went black and the cpu light stopped blinking. I force shut down the computer and tried booting again when the same thing happened (instead of going black the splash just froze). I went back to windows and uninstalled and reinstalled the OS and havent been able to boot it since. I even tried booting Kubuntu with the same problem.\n\nA: This almost sounds like a hardware problem.  You might try putting burning a disc or putting it on a flash drive so you can run the memory test that's available as a boot time option.\nIn the past, I had a computer that ran Windows fine, but could not install linux.

Also, when I select it, while still holding the alt-key, I see the top menu bar switch to 'Update Manager', but when I release alt, it changes back to Ubuntu Desktop.\nIt's almost like the app is off the screen somewhere, perhaps with just a single pixel showing or something like that.\ndisclaimer: One thing that might be affecting things is that I have 'focus follows mouse' configured, which makes things a bit funky with the menu not being on the window, where it should be (perhaps there's a way to put it back with the window?) - I like to be able to type into background windows, and manually control which window is in the foreground.\n\nA: I am having the same issue with not being able to open / view the window using the Update Manager icon in the right side launcher.\nWorkaround: right-click the icon and Quit Update Manager from the quick list, then go to the top right Settings (gear) menu and click on Updates Available... \nThis would show the Update manager window.\n\nA: Workaround: right-click the Update Manager icon on the quick list and select Quit (as noted earlier), and then use middle button on the same Update Manager icon.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.04 windows XP dual boot problem I have installed Ubuntu 11.04 direct from installation disk in a separate partition alongside an existing Windows XP installation.

What is the core of Ubuntu and what is the policy on how many releases API and ABI are kept stable?\nHere is example documentation from Red Hat, I didn't find yet equivalent documentation for Ubuntu.\n\nA: Ubuntu is a distribution based on Debian. By being a distro (distribution), it stands as a re-packaged version of the linux-kernel with lots of stuff on top (such as gnome). Since Ubuntu is branched from the last stable version of Debian, most of the core-utils that you want are actually same as those used in Debian.\nI took a look at ubuntu packages and a search for libc reveals the versions used in each ubuntu version.\nThe core of ubuntu is the Linux Kernel, and the Ubuntu Policy on keeping releases stable is available here.\nWhen you develop for ubuntu, you can link your package against any version of the standard libraries using the deb packaging system that Ubuntu inherits from Debian. This allows you to specify a minimum version of the library that your package needs, for instance. You do not have to worry about compatibility issues across releases, rather check for the last version of the library that supported the features you are using.

It was always my impression that Ubuntu was a binary package distro and that developer sources for various packages were supplied in separate sources repos, if required.\nIt seems that my sources.list file is littered with source repos. Indeed, if adding a package repository via update manager preferences, it automatically includes the sources repo into my sources.list.\nThis is killing my update times and leads me to believe that my apt sources.list is very wrong indeed.\nMy question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*are the source repositories required for anybody who just wants to run software and not compile it themselves?\n\n\nA: \nNote: Source repositories are different from source packages. The repositories, if selected or present in your software sources, are updated whenever you check for updates. Source packages, on the other hand, are never automatically installed -- regardless of whether you use apt-get install or the Software Center. You must explicitly install them with apt-get source, etc.\n\nNo, the source repositories are not required for a normal user; you also do not have to download or install any source packages for the proper functioning of your software.\nTo remove them, open Software Center, and go to the Edit menu...Software Properties.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the box to the left of Source Code as shown below. If you are asked for your password enter it. The box should then be unchecked (white box). Click on close.\n\n\nA: They are not required for binary-only usage, no. They are required for certain features of apt-get to work, particularly the source and build-dep commands.\nYou can comment them out, or disable them in the software-properties-gtk application, which can be opened via update-manager or software-center.\n\nA: There are 3 cases that are related to packages, 2 of which are related to the source packages.\nBinary Only - This is where you installed a Deb package without the need for the source code. This is the typical one and normal users do not need to worry about the source code or working with it. Most packages that you find in the Software center for example are this type.\nBinary + Source - There are some cases, where a Binary package might ask to compile something additional from the source as a step for a proper install. In most cases it will do it automatically but it will still need to download the source code to compile it and have a proper installation. Some proprietary drivers and some scanning tools are in this part.\nSource - This is for developers, end users that want to compile their own packages or test out some changes in already existing code. Some cases, the source code is the only thing that comes for a particular package. About 50% of EVERYTHING is in here. Almost everything is in here... Almost (Proprietary drivers are not ^^).\nSo are source packages required: If you are the common normal user then you won´t need to worry about this packages. Even if you download something that needs to compile something additional to work correctly, you won´t need to worry. In almost all cases this is done automatically. You will in fact need the source if you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Want to contribute to the development of a particular program  \n\n*Want to learn the source Luke... Feel the source Luke!  \n\n*Want to test out your version of Empathy, or Nautilus or some Unity or any other package you want to get your dirty hands on.  \n\n*Want to create your own awesome version of Ubuntu (Awebuntu!)\n\n\nA: The source packages are not required. \nHowever they are available for those who want to study/alter the source code of a specific application.\nFrom Chapter 6 of Debian APT Howto:\n\nIt's common in the world of free software to study source code or even\n  make corrections to buggy code. To do this, you would need to download\n  the source of the program. The APT system provides an easy way to\n  obtain source code to the many programs contained in the distribution,\n  including all the files needed to create a .deb for the program.\nAnother common use of Debian sources is to adapt a more recent version\n  of a program, from the unstable distribution, for example, for use\n  with the stable distribution. Compiling a package against stable will\n  generate .debs with dependencies adjusted to match the packages\n  available in this distribution.\n\n[Full Chapter]\n\nA: Part of the GNU public license (GPL) and other open source licenses is that you have access to the source code.  For example the copyleft statements in the GPLv3 document, especially the preamble:\n     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\nStrictly speaking though, you do not need the source code and you should turn source code off in software sources if you want to.\nOpen Software center then click \"edit\" in the universal menu, click \"software sources\", then untick \"source code\".\n\nA: No, a standard user does not needs those packages.\nAlso these kind of packages are for a really targeted family of developers, more often a developer just need headers to compile and develop for a generic linux platform, or just for the kernel.\nSometimes sources are also needed not to really compile them but to study them in order to provide a better support for the developer or a particular feature, for example Eclipse parses the sources of your jdk in order to provide a complete set of methods and classes in its auto generated documentation and it also uses this informations to provide an auto-completion feature.\n\nA: In addition to the great answers already given, be aware that when you add a repository, it automatically adds the source code repository. You can delete it.\nThese are also in the Software Sources application, but in the Other Software tab. Find those items that read \"(Source Code)\" and either disable (uncheck) or remove them.\n", "Q: Is the Intel Thunderbolt interface supported in Ubuntu Linux? I was searching the web around one hour now, but still could not find a definite answer: Is Intel Thunderbolt already working with Linux? \nI am especially interested in networking, so that I can transfer files from a Mac OSX Machine to an Ubuntu (Intel DZ77RE-75K or Gigabyte Z77X-UP5) Machine.\nAny news/information on Ubuntu and Linux Kernel support for Thunderbolt?\n\nA: As of May 2012, support in the Linux kernel was still buggy and being worked on.

I recently installed tuxonice on a Toshiba z830. I have ubuntu 12.04 (kernel was: 3.2.0-26) I wanted to be able to hibernate, which I consider to be a basic thing a OS should allow you to do. Well, it didn't work...but they already tell you it may not so I removed it. For doing all these I followed:\nProblem with Hibernation\nAfter uninstalling I switched off the laptop and after this I started to have several problems.

I found very strange that after removing tuxonice I still had this:\n/lib/modules/3.2.0-26-generic-tuxonice/\nThe VPN problem could be solved by just copying from my previous kernel: 3.2.0-26-generic/CiscoVPN/ into the tuxonice one. Not very elegant but works.\nNow, for the suspend problem (and the previous too) I can hold Shift when starting and select my old kernel and then suspend works again.\nIn my opinion tuxonice was not correctly uninstalled as it left that kernel behind and worse: ubuntu uses it if I do not take action.

I want to backup the encrypted home of a user who might be logged in at backup time. Which directories should I backup if I want to ensure that absolutely no plaintext data can be leaked? Are the following folders always encrypted?\n/home/user/.Private\n/home/user/.ecryptfs\n\nJust want to make sure that no data leaks, as the backup destination is untrustworthy.\nEdit: Yes, as Lord of Time has suggested, I'd like to know which folders and/or files I need to backup if I need to store only encrypted content in a way that allows me to recover it later with the right passphrase.\n\nA: From reading this by the author of ecryptfs, it sounds like you want to backup $HOME/.Private for each user.\n\nA: They would only be encrypted if they were not mounted. As you soon as you mount them they are in a decrypted state and therefore plaintext is exposed. So the answer would be yes if your ecryptfs volumes are not mounted and no if they are. \n", "Q: Suspend & Hibernate not working on a Toshiba Satellite L300 I am using Toshiba Satellite L300.

I was unable to remove it so instead I removed catalyst completely.\nTo fix the resolution problem I simply edited my xorg.conf file and added the right resolution for my monitors. Have not had it freeze since doing this.\n\nA: I experienced a very similar problem. You may be having a problem where Compiz is incompatible with your graphics driver. Compiz is not needed to get to the login screen so you get to that point OK. Then when you login, Compiz loads (or tries to) and blows up. There are lots of tips on this site regarding how to fix broken Compiz, none of which worked for me and several of which bricked the PC completely. A possible workaround (not the solution) is to try and load the legacy Unity 2D desktop rather than the newer Unity 3D desktop (which is a Compiz plugin and hence rides on top of Compiz. To do this, boot the computer so you see the login display. If you configured auto-login, you need to figure out how to disable this. I ended up completely repeating the install process from scratch and when prompted whether to auto-login or not I selected no.  At the login screen, there is a Ubuntu icon immediately to the right of your login ID.  Click this and you'll see an option for desktop options: Unity (the new Compiz-based version) and Unity 2D (the old Compiz-free version). Select Unity 2D and then click Back and then finish logging in. When you log into your desktop, lightDM will not try to load Compiz at all. If your desktop then loads fine, you at least have a functioning system and know where the problem is, even if you are missing a bit of bling. \nRunning the command echo $DESKTOP_SESSION in a shell will tell you whether you are currently running Unity (3D/Compiz) or Unity 2D (no Compiz).  \nTo make permanent your decision to use Unity 2D, run gksu gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and change user-session=ubuntu to user-session=ubuntu-2d.

How to use shortcuts to switch between displays in LXDE?\nI mean to switch between the laptop monitor and an external display. \nI edited /home/user/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml file to set shortcuts but how to do it for this specific purpose?\n\nA: If you want dual monitor functionality in Lubuntu, you have limited options. The following will show you how to enable and disable dual monitors \"on the fly\" using ARandR as help. These directions are a bit complicated, but trust me: they are not dangerous. This is a SAFE operation. \nFirst, get ARandR from Synaptic or by opening the terminal and pasting:\nsudo apt-get install arandr\nYou can find your new application under Menu -> Preferences\n\nWhat you see is a virtual setup of your monitor arrangement. You will almost certainly have different names for your monitor, but here is what mine looks like. \n\nAlthough you haven't really done anything at this point, save this configuration. \n\nIt will automatically create a new hidden folder called .screenlayout in your home directory. I would encourage you to not change the file location to help with later steps. I would also encourage you to use my file names as well. This one should be called single.\n\nNow add your second monitor. It should be hooked up to your computer at this point, of course. I added mine by scrolling through the only other monitors that allowed activation and selected it.\n\nPosition the monitors however you like. I prefer side-by-side, but you may also put one above the other. It doesn't matter which one is on the left (or the top). It's all up to you! Here's what I like: \n\nOnce you have your desired configuration, save it again. This time, name the file dual.\nThe last step in this whole process is creating hotkeys to switch monitor on the fly. In the terminal type in the following:\nsudo leafpad ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml\nScroll down to a place where you begin to see a lot of words that say <keybind>. You don't need to know what's happening here. Simply find a place after a </keybind>, but before the next <keybind> and paste the following:\n<keybind key=\"W-2\">\n<action name=\"Execute\">\n<command>sh ~/.screenlayout/dual.sh</command>\n</action>\n</keybind>\n\n<keybind key=\"W-1\">\n<action name=\"Execute\">\n<command>sh ~/.screenlayout/single.sh</command>\n</action>\n</keybind>\n\nYour code should look a little like this: \n\nSave. Close. Logout.\nIf you did everything right, you should be able to press Super+2 to activate dual monitor mode. To go back to one monitor, such as your laptop, press Super+1.\nOne final note about the lxde panel. When I switched into dual mode, my panel looked a little funny. If you experience this problem, open up your files you created with ARandR in the .screenlayout directory. Add the following lines to the bottom of the files:\nlxpanelctl restart\nCheck out this page I wrote up a few months back.\nGood luck.\n\nA: The idea is to use xrandr commands. But how to find the proper commands?\nI have found a simple solution as a result of this answer.\nSimpler, because involves using the LXDE default display manager, LXRandr, without the need of scripts.\nIt can save configurations (which are xrandr configurations). \n\nWhen it saves the present configuration the older one is overwritten. But finding them and using them as shortcuts is a nice way to achieve what we want here. \nThe save is in ~/.config/autostart/lxrandr-autostart.desktop.\nThe file looks like \n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=LXRandR autostart\nComment=Start xrandr with settings done in LXRandR\nExec=xrandr --output LVDS --mode 1680x1050 --rate 60.1 --output VGA-0 --off\nOnlyShowIn=LXDE\n\nSo, to save a certain configuration, open that file in a text editor like gedit\n\ngedit ~/.config/autostart/lxrandr-autostart.desktop\n\nand save the line after Exec=, which is a command to be run with a shortkey.\nCreating shortcuts in LXDE is presented in the other answer, that is by editing the file ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml.\nFor example, in order to run the command above with the shortkey Ctrl-M , the edit should be like so:\n<!-- Internal monitor only -->\n    <keybind key=\"C-m\">\n      <action name=\"Execute\">\n        <command>xrandr --output LVDS --mode 1680x1050 --rate 60.1 --output VGA-0 --off</command>\n      </action>\n    </keybind>\n\nFor each computer and its specific internal+external display there should be three basic configurations (internal display only, external only, and both on); and others more only in case of various resolution settings for each of these three.\n\nI found here that in order to have extended monitor (which is outside the capabilities of LXRandr) the command should be something like\nxrandr --output VGA-0 --auto --left-of LVDS\n\n(VGA-0 and LDTS are variables, look in ~/.config/autostart/lxrandr-autostart.desktop to see what you have, or run xrandr -q.)\n\nA: Disable the Super_L entry in your Global Actions Manager (search for \"Shortcut Keys\" in your Application Menu)\n\"Super_L\" row option deselected in the Global Actions Manager\nRun sudo featherpad ~/.config/openbox/lxqt-rc.xml or sudo nano ~/.config/openbox/lxqt-rc.xml.\nSearch for the <keyboard> tag using the shortcut CTRL + F if you're using featherpad or CTRL + W if you're using nano editor. Insert this after the keyboard tag:\n<!-- Move the window to the first monitor -->\n<keybind key=\"W-S-Left\">\n    <action name=\"MoveResizeTo\">\n    <monitor>1</monitor>\n    </action>\n</keybind>\n<!-- Move the window to the second monitor -->\n<keybind key=\"W-S-Right\">\n    <action name=\"MoveResizeTo\">\n    <monitor>2</monitor>\n    </action>\n</keybind>\n\n\n\n*Change the keybinding from W-S-Right to W-S-Left depending on your window order configuration. These keybindings are the equivalent to Windows + Shift + Left arrow key and Windows + Shift + Right arrow key on your keyboard.\n\nSave it and run openbox --reconfigure in your terminal.\nWorking on Lubuntu 21.10\n", "Q: Can I use Gwibber to access LinkedIn? I installed Ubuntu for the first time a couple of days ago so I'm just getting set up. I'm not a big social media user but I do use FB and Linked in a bit. Gwibber seems to work for FB but not for LinkedIn. Is there a way I can configure something to make it work or is there an alternate client I should be looking at?\nThanks\nMartin\n\nA: Not with the official client\n\nDanger! This is a delicate procedure and the code is not finalized. Make a backup before doing this.\n\nThere is not \"official\" LinkedIn support for Gwibber, but there is a third party solution. However, it requires removing the old Gwibber files, which can be dangerous.

I use Rhythmbox's podcast feature, to automatically download new podcast episodes from feeds which I've subscribed to. I also happen to use Ubuntu on several computers, all synced to the same Ubuntu One account.\nWhat I want to do, is to synchronize downloaded podcasts as well as Rhythmbox's list of podcast subscriptions between my computers, so that the podcast view in Rhythmbox appear the same on all computers. How can I do that?\n\nA: Locate the files you wish to  sync\nThen, via ln -s you can link them into your Ubuntu One Folder.\nFor example: I want to link 123.txt in my home folder to my Ubuntu One:\nln -s /home/name/123.txt /home/name/\"Ubuntu One\"\n\nIt is \"Ubuntu One\" and not just without \" because there is an space in the folder name.\nIn your case it is the opposite way, as you want the files to be stored in your Ubuntu One:\nln -s /home/name/\"Ubuntu One\"/Podcasts /home/name/Podcasts\n\nDo this on every computer you want to sync with\n\nA: You can mark your Podcasts folder as a synced folder to sync the podcast files themselves; you do not have to put those files inside your Ubuntu One folder if you don't want to. That way, you can choose whether you want your podcasts synced to other devices or not (your Ubuntu One folder is always kept in sync). To mark any folder as synced with Ubuntu One, just right-click it and say Ubuntu One > Synchronise this folder, or say Add a folder from this computer in the Ubuntu One control panel.\nThe list of subscribed podcasts in Rhythmbox is a little more difficult to synchronise, I'm afraid, because (as you note in a comment) it's not stored separately. It would be possible to write a Rhythmbox plugin to keep this data in sync as well, though; if you're a hacker and interested in doing that (or know someone who is) I'd be happy to give some tips on how best to do it.\n", "Q: How do I remove an existing built package from a PPA?

I typically have two needs:\nScenario A. Change a single PDF page.\nIn this case I have a PDF but not the original source file used to create the PDF. I don't want to try to recreate the document from scratch. I'd like to open the PDF and change a few things. A good example of this scenario: I was responsible for planning a big event at a campground site, I had a PDF of the site. I wanted to start with that document, highlight some parts, add some labels, remove some parts that weren't relevant. \nor \nScenario B. Combine PDFs or extract page(s) from a PDF\nThis scenario usually arises because I want a single PDF deliverable that is made up of parts that are best created in different programs. In this case I have the source files for all the documents but they don't play well enough together to easily create a single PDF deliverable. For part of it, I may want to use Libre Office Writer. For another page I may want to use Gimp. Still another page I may use Libre Office Calc. I could use Writer as the master document and embed images or the Calc object into that, but for ultimate control, you can't beat separate PDF documents that are then combined.\nWhat are the best tools / processes for editing PDFs in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Foxit PDF Editor (non-free) works well via WINE.\nNewer versions of Foxit might work as well -- haven't tested 'em, though.\n~.~.~\nps: This answer applies to your \"Scenario A\": you can basically edit everything in a pdf with Foxit: i.e., you can not only add things, but actually edit them as if it were, say, a Word file.\n\nA: You can use the latest version of Master PDF Editor, which lets you edit all elements on the page.\nHint: Try the newest version first. But, as the last version 1.9.24 that I tried, had a bug that wouldnt open all images of a pdf file, the version 1.9.00 worked very fine, but the only way to get it is a direct link:\nhttp://code-industry.net/public/MasterPDFEditor-1.9.00.x86_64.tar.gz\nhttp://code-industry.net/public/MasterPDFEditor-1.9.00.i386.tar.gz\nAs mentioned in the comments, Master PDF Editor version 4, which was the last free version that did not put a watermark in the PDF, is taken down from its website, but is available at\nhttp://code-industry.net/public/master-pdf-editor-4.3.89_qt5.amd64.deb\n\nA: I'm a little late in the game here, but recently stumbled across this question while googling it for myself. For what it's worth, I would like to recommend Xournal for the first scenario.\nIt should be in the software center, or you can simply run the following from a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install xournal\n\nBesides that, I'm going to second everyone else's recommendation for pdfshuffler and pdftk for the second scenario.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: There was magic thing called pdfedit in repository. Anyway, you can get it from here http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfedit/. I've used it to make some text changes directly to file, omitting any conversions, so that file structure remains untouched. Just choose text selection mode at toolbox and click the text you want to edit. You are allowed to do it through the text-box that appeares at upper-left corner of window. Of course, there are a lot more features.\n\nA: PDF Buddy is an online PDF editor that's a great solution for quick and easy cross-platform PDF editing, whether you're on Ubuntu or anything else. (It would come in handy for what you describe in Scenario A)\n(Disclosure: I'm a co-founder of PDF Buddy)\n\nA: PDF-Shuffler, which was mentioned here, is very old and has some issues since it wasn't updated in a very long time (since 2012). To fix those issues and add new functionality, a fork was created, called PDF Arranger. \n\nPDF Arranger is a free and open source application for manipulating PDF documents, that can be used to merge, split, rotate and crop PDF documents and reorder their pages, using an interactive user interface.\nPDF Arranger is available in Ubuntu 19.04 and newer, and can be installed using:\nsudo apt install pdfarranger\n\nFor older Ubuntu versions there's a PPA to install it (provided by Linux Uprising):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/apps\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install pdfarranger\n\n\nA: I am surprised that PDF Studio is not mentioned here.\nIt's an all-in-one PDF solution that can annotate, markup text, form fill, edit content, sign, OCR and manipulate PDF documents.\nhttp://www.qoppa.com/pdfstudio\n\nA: Scenario A\nAfter what seemed like an eternal quest to find a good solution for annotations, I found the superior alternative to be PDF-XChange Editor via wine. Everything I have tested so far works, just make sure you install it via the 32-bit .msi installer wine msiexec /i path/to/msi_file. Annotations are saved with the document and not separate (as in okular by default) and you can even edit document text with the free version (images with the paid one). Their forums are also linux friendly and they seem to try to keep it wine compatible. Running through wine is buttersmooth for me, but If you want a native app, I think master-pdf-editor is the most promising alternative.\nScenario B\nTwo command line tools that are shipped with Ubuntu by default, pdfseparate and pdfunite is a fast and simple solution to split and merge pdf pages. If you want a GUI I recommend pdf-sam\n\nA: LibreOffice Draw\nThis impressed me:\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice\nlibreoffice my.pdf\n\nJust open the PDF, edit, and export as PDF.\nThe editing tools appear in a toolbar at the bottom of the window (took me some time to find it...)\nRelevant feature set I have found so far (Ubuntu 13.04, LibreOffice 4.0.2.2):\n\n*\n\n*Remove pages: Right click on the page on the left page list > Delete page. See also: How can I extract a page range / a part of a PDF?\n\n*Change page order: Drag drop pages on the page list\n\n*Edit existing text fields (edit text, formatting and position). Just click twice with the select tool to enter edit mode.\n\n*Add new text fields. Choose the text tool at the bottom (T), select the desired text area, and write.\n\n*Edit non text fields objects like lines or bullets.\n\n*Create fillable PDF forms (Enable the Form* toolbars and be sure to select \"Create a PDF Form\")\n\nI could not find an extremely convenient highlight method, but you could get away with editing text attributes like setting the colour red and boldface. I could not change the background colour tough.\nIf I missed good features, please edit and add them!\nHere is a screenshot of me editing a PDF exported from this ODT: https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/blob/f3497274fffcb043b9751c903c9fe715a5b023ce/test.odt on 6.4.6.\n\nOf course, as you can see in the screenshot above, PDFs don't have as much information as the original ODT, and e.g. I can only edit one visible line at a time of a paragraph, and the following paragraphs won't \"wrap back\" to the correct size, since PDFs simply aren't designed to be editable.\nNote: I know that it fails for a few type of PDFs, it has already happened to me.\nIf that is the case for you, please open a minimal, super detailed and reproducible bug report on their bug tracker https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/ so that devs may solve it, and post the link as a comment. When it happened to me I was lazy/inexperienced and didn't do that :-)\nDespite this, it was still the best open solution when I last checked, and it works most of the time.\n\nA: I think that PDF-Shuffler is small but quite good app. \nInfo: PDF-Shuffler is a small python-gtk application, which helps the user to merge or split pdf documents and rotate, crop and rearrange their pages using an interactive and intuitive graphical interface. It is a frontend for python-pyPdf.\nPDF-Shuffler Web Site\n\nA: LibreOffice Draw does not work for me as the fonts get completely messed up which then throws the formatting of the document off.\nHere are three solutions that for me have worked consistently over the years. \nPDF-shuffler\nI do a lot of combining of PDF documents (as in the Scenario B) and I find PDF-shuffler simple and convenient. I have also used it to extract pages out of a larger pdf document and it works well there too. The PDF-shuffler GUI is simple and it works consistently.\nGimp\nSometimes for Scenario A you just want to convert the PDF into an image and then manipulate the image. If you don't know the difference between a vector graphic and an image, you probably want to convert to an image and GIMP does a good job of that. When you open a PDF with GIMP it will give you some choices about how you want to convert it. Pay attention to the resolution option. Choose a higher number for a larger file size and a more detailed image. \nInkscape\nThe truth is, there isn't a super easy way to edit PDF files following scenario A above. That is because PDF is a universal format and some of the structure of the document is lost when it is converted to PDF. A simple example: if you take a 3 page report and convert it to a PDF you have broken the links between the text on each page. If you edit the PDF version of it and delete a paragraph on the first page the text from pages 2 and 3 won't automatically flow onto the first page. It would be much easier to edit that document in the original program used to create it. \nBut for whatever reason, you don't have the original document so you are stuck working off of a PDF. So set your expectations appropriately  when editing a PDF document following scenario A. \nOnce you set your expectations accordingly, you'll see that inkscape is the best tool for most jobs here. It will allow you to import a single page of the PDF document as an inkscape vector graphic. There will be a few things grouped together that don't really make sense, and you may have to change some fonts (assuming you don't have the original fonts installed), but really it is slick. \nThere is a learning curve to Inkscape but the truth is that you can't manipulate PDF without using some program with a learning curve. For my time, I'd prefer to invest that in learning Inkscape--a great application for creating vector graphics that can come in handy for lots of different scenarios--than I would in trying to figure out how to use a special tool just for editing PDFs.\nGood luck\n\nA: Ubuntu 20.04 how to edit PDF\nI kindly suggest Foxit PDF Reader for Linux\nwhich is free and beloved, nice to see it is available for Linux too\nDownload, install\nDouble click on a PDF and when asked, optionally set Foxit as default PDF viewer or just select Foxit for this type on PDF test\nWhen the PDF is opened\nEnable the Comment bar (there is a button for this between View and Connect buttons)\nThe comment bar will appear, don't be tricked by those new buttons, and instead\nclick on the three dots menu\nThere you have the nice Typewrite option\nand there you are\n\nA: 'PDF-Shuffler' along with 'LibreOffice'\nYou can download PDF-Shuffler from Ubuntu Software. With PDF-Shuffler you can Rotate, Crop, Delete or Export page/s. LibreOffice is already there as default. \nUsing these two Apps I could edit PDF in my Ubuntu 16.04LTS. \nFirst, I opened the PDF file using PDF-Shuffler, right-clicked and exported the page that is to be edited (and named the new file). Then I opened that file using LibreOffice. Without doing anything I could edit that file.  Then I saved the file. As a result I got an odg file. Just double-clicked the file to open it. LibreOffice (LibreOffice Draw) opened that file. I got the new PDF file just by clicking on the red button for converting into PDF. \nThis was very easy. No need to pay money for Editing PDF as in Windows.\n\nA: Considering a typical use case of editing a pdf document scanned using a scanner to delete some pages and to rotate pages libreoffice draw seems to be good enough. This is especially relevant if one is scanning a few pages of a bounded book.\nTo rotate a page by 180 degrees, right click on the document and press flip horizontally then right click again and press flip vertically.\nFlipping once creates a mirror image and flipping twice rotates the page as desired.\n\nA: Scenario B - \"Combine PDFs or extract page(s) from a PDF\"\nI'm surprised that PDFsam (\"split-and-merge\") is not already noted in this Q&A.

I've only used it for regular RS232 serial ports myself, but at least for that it's easy to use and it's even been ported to python3 if you're using that.\nYou won't use the bus path like you said in your text, but rather use /dev/ttyUSBx where x is the number of your USB port. It's rather common to just iterate through ports 0-255 with PySerial and then catch the exceptions for ports that don't exist. Not sure if you would get the text identifier though.

I am hoping to take my desktop computer, which is currently running the desktop version of Ubuntu, and instead run Ubuntu server. Once the server is setup and running properly, I should be able to follow this tutorial http://madisonlinux.org/InstallingOpenVPNOnUbuntu10.04, which I believe allows me to connect securely with my windows-based laptop. So if anyone can tell me, which server I should install, and how to install it that would be awesome. \nI am assuming there is already a tutorial on these forums already saying how to do this, but unfortunately, after trying 3 different searches, I was unable to find it. So feel free to add a link to this thread, which tells me how to take my Ubuntu desktop and make it a Ubuntu server.\n\nA: OpenVPN and all packages found in the server version of Ubuntu are also found in the Desktop one. Not only that but you can even find more info here: What is the difference between 12.04 Desktop & 12.04 Server images and here: What's the difference between the server version and the desktop version?\nWith this knowledge you can save valuable time setting up your server.\nWhen you have all the prerequisites you need you can then install OpenVPN in your desktop PC since... it ALSO comes in Ubuntu Desktop ^^.\nThe 3 points mentioned in the file in the link you provided are already met with the Desktop version:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need to be able to install and configure software on your server.  \n\n*You will need to be able to copy files from your server (i.e. scp, mounting a USB drive, etc)  \n\n*You will need to be able to set up a port forward on your router.  \n\n\nThe rest of the VPN configuration is easier since you have a GUI environment but you can also work on it via the terminal.\nSo in general you are better off working with the desktop in your case.\nJust in case you are wondering, the performance will be the same but the configuration will be faster.\n\nA: The guide you referred to may be a little old and today you should use ubuntu server 12.04 and not 10.04 but it should work the same.\nYou can download Ubuntu Server from Ubuntu site. Choose 64 or 32 bits version depending on your machine, Burn the ISO on a CD, boot the machine with it and follow the instructions. Here you can find a nice tutorial on how to install Ubuntu Server. It will guide you to install a full server but you can stop at the end of the base install and configuration (end of page 3).\nAnyways, as other answers are saying, you don't need to use Ubuntu server, Ubuntu desktop will work the same for the installation of OpenVPN. They are the same with small kernel optimization differences and a different stack of default software. The main difference is that Server has no graphic environnement.\nThe result for your day to day use is that Ubuntu Server will have a LOT less updates to do and will use a LOT less memory while running. I consider it won't need a monitor or a mouse too, at least most of the time and is easier to manage using SSH connections from a GUI machine (at least because you can use many terminal on the same screen and look at other files or Internet at the same time... and you can't do that while in front of the Ubuntu Server machine...).\nPS: That's another topic but the guide shows how to install OpenVPN client on Ubuntu machines and not Windows. There is a GUI client on OpenVPN site that works very well and is very simple to install on Windows.\n", "Q: Save inkscape figure in 400dpi (png or jpeg) I'm a difficulty in Ubuntu.

I saved the jpeg using output pro inkscape plugin, but I can not insert the image into LibreOffice Writter (I think the reason is that the image was very extensive, but I am obliged to do so, because my university has the using standard figures 400dpi).\n\nA: I'm actually surprised they're asking you to take a vector drawing such as those produced by Inkscape and convert it to a raster image because vector images are resolution-independent and therefore produce excellent print output anyway, so you may want to start by double-checking they really want you to do that. The rest of my answer will assume that you have checked and the university really do want an image.\nYour problem here is probably more one of trying to force LibreOffice to do something it isn't designed for - namely prepare output for a high-quality printing press rather than a standard home or office printer. I prepare output for press regularly and, if your university guidelines permit, you should really do this on desktop publishing (DTP) software (your university probably should allow this if they're asking for 400 dpi images). I suspect, however, that your university might not be asking you to do so much. It would be more normal for someone in their position (as a publisher) to ask you (as a content producer) to provide the text and images separately for them to prepare in the DTP package of their choice.\nIf they are set on asking for a complete, press-ready document from you then I recommend downloading scribus from the software centre and working through the scribus tutorial. Once you've done that you'll know how to import your text and your image in a way that will ensure high-quality press output. You can then export a press-ready PDF to submit to your university.\n\nA: I recommend you save your figures as EPS instead - you can do this from the Save As... menu in Inkscape. Academic publishers like TIFF for bitmaps and EPS for vector art, in my experience.\nThis means the publisher can scale the image to any size they like, without jaggies.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation accuses false RAID I'm trying to install a Ubuntu 12.04/Win7 dual boot on my machine (with 2 750GB HDs).\nProblem is, during the partitioning, the installation says I'm using RAID, and shows only one HD, with 1.5TB.\nI have, however, disabled raid on the setup, and installed Windows 7 only on HD 1, and want to keep Ubuntu to HD 2.\nI'm afraid to \"resize\" the partitions using the installer since that could mess my win7 installation.\nI did try to use the alternate installer, but had the same results.\n\nA: You have a fake raid controller.  Simply disabling the bios support does not get rid of the metadata on the disks that identifies them as members of a raid, so Linux still recognizes it.  When you wanted to stop using the drives in a raid, you should have used the bios raid utility to delete the raid set, instead of just disabling the raid bios.  To erase the old metadata now, (assuming the disks in question are sda and sdb ) run:\nsudo dmraid -Er /dev/sda\nsudo dmraid -Er /dev/sdb\n\n", "Q: Blu-ray player?

I know I can do things like \ngcc -v\n\nto get version of an application but is there a similar thing available for libraries? I am using ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: ldconfig -v requires sudo. \nAll you really need is to query it, so this will do.\nldconfig -p | grep [name]\n\nA: You can quickly find what version or where a library is, even if you do not quite know the title, with dpkg, and, in your case, using boost as the query term:\ndpkg -l '*boost*'\n\nand then query dpkg again with this option for a full list of file locations now you know the name of the file:\ndpkg -L <'name of lib'>\n\nThe name of the library may, for example, be libboost1.46-dev.\n\nA: Use ldconfig -v to print libraries and current version number and grep to filter your results ldconfig -v | grep [name].\n\nA: It is better to find the packadge of the lib with dpkg -S libXYZ.so.N.\nThan do apt-cache showpkg libXYZ and the version numbers is shown.\n", "Q: /boot partition is NTFS on dual-boot Win7/Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop I recently purchased an Acer Aspire laptop.

I would like to tri-boot it with another Environment if possible, but this is presenting a problem. \n\nA: You can't.

I would like to map the Ctrl and Alt modifier keys to the left and right thumb buttons of my mouse, respectively, so I can Ctrl + click and Alt-click without touching the keyboard.\nMy thumb buttons are buttons 8 and 9.\nI tried the solution in How do I configure a mouse thumb button?\nwhich explained how to map a double click to a thumb button - this worked for the double-click but I couldn't figure out how to modify the solution for Ctrl and Alt\nI also tried How to map Ctrl/Shift to thumb buttons of Mouse?\nwhich used xdotools and xbindkeys. I modified the script to this:\n~/.xbindkeysrc:\n\"xdotool keydown alt\"\n        b:9\n\"xdotool keyup alt\"\n        release + alt + b:9\n\"xdotool keydown ctrl\"\n        b:8\n\"xdotool keyup ctrl\"\n        release + control + b:8\n\nWhich ALMOST works. It simulates a Ctrl-key press when I click the left thumb button, but I can't actually hold the button and click at the same time - holding the thumb button seems to prevent it from listening to other input until it is released.\nDoes anyone know how I can make my mouse thumb button actually work as a modifier key, so I can use thumb button + click instead of Ctrl + click?\n\nA: i found a working solution here. it uses Easystroke (sudo apt install easystroke). kudos to @stuartr from ubuntuforums!\nthough there was one issue - re-mapped mouse click sporadically fired an original ('back' in my case) event. to avoid this, mouse button can be remapped to some unused number with xinput set-button-map (sudo apt install xinput).\nto re-map on every login i've created (exacutable) $HOME/.config/autostart/mouse-buttons.sh with this content:\n$ cat .config/autostart/mouse-buttons.sh\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nmi_mouse_id=$(xinput | grep 'GTech MI wireless mouse.*pointer' | sed 's/.*\\tid=\\([0-9]*\\)\\t.*/\\1/')\nxinput set-button-map $mi_mouse_id 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 20 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n$\n\nthis maps mouse button 8 to button 20. hopefully button 20 has no meaning. at least it has absolutely no effect for me.\nnow it's time to re-map button 20 to Ctrl:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preferences tab: additional buttons -> add -> radio button 'Instant Gestures' -> click the mouse button of choice in the grey area (for me a 'back, thumb button' became '(Instantly) Button 20')\n\n*Preferences tab: Select 'Autostart Easystroke'\n\n*Actions tab: Add Action\n Name: anything you like (e.g. 'Mouse 20 -> Ctrl')\n Type: 'Ignore'\n Details: click it once to change 'Ignore' to 'Key combination...'. then press Ctrl + a. 'a' doesn't matter and is ignored. 'Key Combination' will be replaced with 'Ctr'\n\n*With the new action selected/highlighted -> click 'Record Stroke' -> press the mouse button you're wanting to use again (this came up with '20 -> 20' in the Stroke column for me)\n\n*Now pressing and holding my mouse button brings up a dinky 'Ctr' on the screen and acts like the button is being held for as long as the mouse button is\n\n\nA: Instead of using xdotool, if you prefer a functional GUI-based solution, you can download the Easystrokes app from the Ubuntu software center.  You can easily map keyboard keys and shortcuts to mouse buttons and even mouse gestures.  \n", "Q: Inserted DVD disc not recognized I was trying to watch a DVD on my Ubuntu laptop, however, whenever I insert the disc, the CD/DVD drive icon on the Computer pane disappears, seems that it cannot detect what type of disc was inserted.\nI am running on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and new to these things as I used to be comfortable with Windows doing the things for me. \nIMMEDIATE HELP WILL BE APPRECIATED as I just borrowed this DVD from a mate who allowed me to watch it until I finish the episodes inside the CD.\n\nA: You may need to add the correct codecs for DVD Playback, They do not come with the Live Ubuntu CD\nFirst Install the Medibuntu Repositories\nMedibuntu repository provides all the playback and encoding capabilities that most Windows and Mac systems contain, but which Ubuntu’s creators decline to include by default in their systems, due to licensing restrictions and a lack of open-source code for those features.

Now when I navigate to https:// myip:10000 I get a message saying the connection attempt is rejected. The last thing I did was set up a cron job to start utorrent webUI. \nI tried reinstalling but no change. When I check with netstat I see a webmin entrance on port 10000. I've also reset the iptables and allowed everything. I'm at a loss as to what to do now.\n\nA: I've just experienced the same thing.\nIt looks like uTorrent was preventing webmin from starting up successfully. I tried various things to get uTorrent to start up on reboot alongside webmin but to no avail.\nEventually I got webmin working by removing the utorrent.conf file like so: sudo rm /etc/init/utorrent.conf and installed Transmission torrent client instead (which worked perfectly with no conflicts with webmin).\n\nA: Webmin uses port 10000 as we can see in netstat -nap, but if you are running utserver first of running webmin service it will also bind the port 10000 to it, because of a service of device pairing of utserver.\nTo avoid this bind another port in webmin at Webmin > Webmin Configuration > Ports and Addresses\nOr in other hand you can disable the service of pairing in utserver\nSettings > Advanced > Search for net.discoverable and turn it to false > Save Settings > Restart utserver service (service utserver restart)\nCheck with netstat -nap if there is a bind of 127.0.0.1:10000 to utserver, doing that it will not be there.\n\nA: Although I don't use Ubuntu, the same thing appears to happen in other OS's like OpenSuse for example.  I found that stopping the instance of utserver and then starting Webmin, then restarting utserver resolved my issue.  Problem is that when you restart, you have the same issue again.  It appears that utserver takes control of port 10000 for some reason.  I guess another option would be to run webmin on a different port?

Update-alternatives keeps track of what your preferred options are when you have several software packages providing similar functionality, such as different JDKs. The rest is just telling update-alternatives what you'd like to configure. Never enter commands in a terminal if you don't know roughly what they'll do.

I am trying to create a VPN connection for my Ubuntu Server machine to use. I only have access via ssh terminal session.\nI have seen many articles detailing how to connect to an existing connection, but none about creating a new connection.\nI am using Ubuntu Server 12.x\n\nA: As I didn't understand what you need to do exactly, let me explain how VPN works:\nTo have a VPN you need a VPN Server (where you connect to) and a VPN Client (the machine you use to connect to the Server). You can't create a connection without a VPN server.\nWe have 3 possibilities here:\n\n\n*\n\n*You want your server to connect to another one (a VPN Server). In this case you need a client and as there are different VPN types, you need to follow instructions from the VPN Server administrator.\n\n*You want to connect to your server from another machine (your local machine probably) and in this case you need to install a VPN server on your server and a client on your machine. For that I use OpenVPN since many years and it works very well with Windows and Ubuntu clients\n\n*You want to connect both machines to a hosted VPN server from a 3rd party and in this case as there are many different VPN types, you need to follow the instructions of the 3rd party administrator.\nIf you only want a \"private / encrypted\" connection to your server, you already have SSH and you won't have much more with a VPN. A VPN is useful to connect to a network as if you were a local machine in the network and not so useful to connect to a single machine where you can use SSH connections for terminals (and redirect graphic output to your screen if the server has graphic desktop) and SSH tunnels to access other ports. For example tunneling with SSH a local port on your machine to port 3306 on the remote server to administer MySQL with a 100% encrypted connection instead of using phpmyadmin sending your DB root password over http.\nPPTP Update:\nFor PPTP client via command line, you can use pptp-linux client:\nsudo apt-get install pptp-linux\nThere are many tutorials on how to configure it:\nEdited after comments from OP:\nUbuntu community help site worked.\nOthers are available like PPTP Linux client.

I can see a status bar item, percents increasing.\nI wouldn't mind much; the problem is that until it's done, I can't see the mail in the Sent folder and can't work with it.\nThis behavior started without any reconfiguration.\nOther users of the same mail server do not experience this trouble.\nHow can I fix this?\nVersions:\nUbuntu 11.04\nEvolution 2.32.2\nUpdate: \nI found out that the messages are actually staying in Outbox and not outgoing at all if one particular SMTP server is used. \nWhen I tried to \"Flush\" the Outbox, it shown \"Sending...\", but nothing changed nor was sent.\nWhen I try to \"expunge\" outbox, Evolution says: \nMBOX file corrupted, expected From: but didn't find.\n\nand later\nSummary and folder mismatch, even after a sync\n\nAny idea how to fix this? Preferably without need to drop & set up everything anew.\nAnd where does Evolution store it's .mbox files? ~/.evolution does not exist.\n~/.gconf/apps/evolution/ only contains configuration.\n\nA: Answering the first part of the question (where can I see my message while it's being sent):\nWhile being sent, the message can be found in the \"Outbox\", which is located in the \"local tree\" of the mail accounts. Only when sent successfully (i.e. delivered to the configured SMTP server -- which does not necessarily mean it already reached the recipient), it gets stored within the \"Sent\" folder.\n\nA: Ondra, it would have been better you'd opened a new question instead of completely changing the topic :)\nAnd where does Evolution store it's .mbox files?\nNot sure about the .mbox files as I don't use local storage. But usually, all of Evolutions data files are located in ~/.local/share/evolution, while configuration stuff went to ~/.config/evolution. The third place involved you already discovered (~/.gconf/apps/evolution). Gone the days where things have been easy with everything located in ~/.evolution -- that folder is not used anymore at all with current versions.\nHow to fix this (trouble with certain SMTP server)?\nLogs are helpful. Try contacting the servers admin, maybe it's not at all the fault of Evolution -- or the server's logs provide useful information to isolate the problem). Until solved, try using a different SMTP server: either the admin has a secondary you could use, or some other admin permits you to \"relay\" via his server.\n\nA: Ok so I have figured out few things.\n1) The files are in MBOX format, but not named *.mbox.\n2) They are stored in .local/share/evolution/mail/local, at least in my case.\n3) Non-redundant data are stored in the files without suffix. The rest is generated and can be deleted manually and re-generated (.ibex, .index etc.)\n4) Exporting backup and restoring from it did not help. Seems that evolution just gzips the files as is.\nSo what fixed it for me was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Evolution\n\n*Delete /home/ondra/.local/share/evolution/mail/local/Outbox.*  (NOT that without suffix)\n\n*Launch Evolution\n\n*Fix your SMTP if necessary to make all mails go.\n\n*Flush Outbox to send pending messages and get them moved to IMAP server (deleted locally)\n\n*Close Evolution\n\n*Delete Oubox* - this time all Outbox files. All mails shown in Evolution at this time are probably broken and unrecoverable (easily). Outbox will be recreated.\n\n*Delete folders.db - it will get recreated from the MBOX files\n\n*Launch Evolution\n\n\nTadaa!\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://library.gnome.org/users/evolution/3.2/data-storage.html.en\n\n*https://live.gnome.org/Evolution/FAQ#Where_does_Evolution_store_my_data.3F\n\n*http://library.gnome.org/users/evolution/3.2/backup-restore.html.en (didn't help)\n\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu to another partition from Ubuntu with Unetbootin? Basically what I want to do is install a fresh copy of Ubuntu from Ubuntu. It is an older machine so usb boot doesn't work and I don't see why I need to waste a CD to do it. Currently running Ubuntu 11.10.\nI have a 1TB drive and a second 500GB drive for backup.\nThe 1TB drive is partitioned as:\n20GB   sda1 Windows XP\n20GB   sda3 Free for new OS \n~800GB sda4 Data (ext3)\n60GB   sda7 /home (ext4)\n20GB   sda6 / (ubuntu 11.10 ext4)\n2GB    sda5 swap\n\nAfter researching I decided that using unetbootin was the best option. I chose Hard Disk (frugal install) and the only option for which disk is \"/\". That worked and I quickly rebooted into Ubuntu 12.04 live. \nChose to install and picked custom options, set sda3 for / and sda7 for /home. The installer started but hit a wall at detecting other operating systems. It was trying to mount sda6 to find out about the existing os's on the machine, for the purpose of installing grub. And it couldn't umount sda6 because that was currently mounted as cd drive for live cd. I couldn't find an option to make the installer skip this step (I could later fix the grub in 11.10).\nI have another drive with 4GB free partition and if I could get unetbootin to install to there it would all work.\nSo my question is - how do I get unetbootin to install to a different disk for hard-disk install?

Although, I would like to keep the code possible to run on any system (or at least both Ubuntu and Windows).\nSo to learn how Ubuntu packaging works, I've looked at the quickly application used in the App Developer Showdown recently. But the folder structure and the files it creates makes no sense at all to me. So I read the Ubuntu Packaging Guide and the Applicaton Review Process with all the links there, as well as the Debian Python Policy. But all that text just worked to make me more confused about the way quickly creates files and folders.\nThe quickly way?\nSo, this is what I understand from quickly (assuming my project name is proj):\nproj/bin = one single file that will be copied to /usr/share/bin/proj.py to enable running the app from a global path? But that would be in violation of the \"Application Review Process\" rules, right?\nproj/data/* = files that should go under /usr/share/proj/*, right? But that would also be in violation of the \"Application Review Process\" rules?\nproj/help/C/* = some HTML documentation, I think, which should go under /usr/share/doc/proj/ and that works well with \"Application Review Process\", but why is the folder name \"C\" and not just \"proj\"?\nproj/tests/ = some sort of files for a \"test\" package within Python. I guess this is great, looking forward to learn what it is.\nproj/proj/ = some files that just seem to link to new files in the proj_lib folder? Seems unnecessary, and I don't understand why these are here at all.\nproj/proj_lib/ = the actual source code, I guess?\nThen quickly also creates proj/apport and proj/etc/apport* which I have no idea what they do or why they are added.\nNow, the really confusing part is the file structure. It looks like nothing I have seen before. And to be honest, it looks very complicated in an unnecessary way. Below this section I will describe the way I would make my own project file structure, which may help describe why this is so confusing to me. But first, my understanding of the quickly way (note that my understanding may be wrong at this point). \nFirst of all, the setup.py. This file contains a function called update_config() which just loads another file called proj/proj_lib/projconfig.py. But that config.py-file doesn't seem to contain anything that would be useful to keep separate from the setup.py? Actually, there are a lot of things that I've never seen anyone suggest to put in a setup.py-file before. The setup.py also contains a hard coded file name pointing to the SVG icon, and otherwise just copies the desktop.in-file on itself so why not just have the changes made directly in the desktop.in-file without this function in setup.py? Then there is another function to create a subdirectory proj/data/share/proj and copy the desktop.in-file there, which I don't understand the purpose of? Why have a function that does that when you can just have the file there originally? Then after all of this nonsensical code comes something that actually looks like a regular setup.py.\nNow the proj/bin/proj.py, which I assume is supposed to be used to start the application? This just seems to remap /usr/ to /opt/extras.ubuntu.com/ in a previously undeclared syspath variable. So I guess this is to accomodate the rules in the \"Application Review Process\" for apps that are using folder names standard for all other Linux flavors? Fair enough, I don't understand it but I can live with that. After this remapping of directories, this file goes on to call on proj/proj/init.py.\nproj/proj/__init__.py is the standard way to define how to start a module, I guess? But instead of having some code which actually does something, this file just goes on to in turn run the main window class, which  is located in yet another file.\nproj/proj_lib/ also has an init.py-file which I don't understand the purpose of. Then there is a Window.py which seems to contain the actually functionality of the application, and calls other window py-files like about dialog etc.\nThe way I did my app\nMy folder structure looks like this:\nproj/\nproj/ui\nproj/imageformats # necessary for imports to work\nproj/sqldrivers   # necessary for imports to work\n\nIn the proj/ folder I have my setup.py and my proj.py which starts my app. In my proj.py file I have all the main window functionality, calling some other windows and functions with imports, and at the end of this file is the main() function which starts the app.\nThe proj/ui/ folder contains all my .ui files made with Qt Designer.\nThe other folders are just there to provide some files which will make the application work when packaged with py2exe for Windows. Basically, they are the files that would be provided through dependencies in Ubuntu.\nNote that this setup I have works great for Windows development. I use py2exe to build an executable that ends up in a proj/dist/ folder, and I can just copy the files in this folder and it will work on any Windows machine.\nHow do I combine this?\nI have spent a few days trying to read documentation. There is hardly anything I can find on quickly, except the basic tutorial and the stuff on App Developer Showdown Workshops. I can't find anything there that helps me make sense of the folder structure suggested by quickly. \nFrom what I have read, I could use os.environ['HOME'] to create a path to ~/.config/proj.conf on Ubuntu or C:/Users/username/.config/proj.conf on Windows. That far I can keep to cross platform code. But then with the division into /bin and /etc and /opt I will start to run into some problems. Of course, I could as a last resort keep two copies of the code - one set up for Ubuntu and one set up for Windows. But then I would still want a similar folder structure to make the transfer of code changes easy.\nThere should be someone who already has a good solution for this. And perhaps that person could also (besides giving an example of how to make it cross-platform) describe why there is such a long chain of files calling other files calling other files in the default quickly setup? Of course, I am now assuming that quickly uses some sort of recommended model for Ubuntu. If that is not the case, I would like to get suggestions on what would be a recommended folder structure to distribute an application through Ubuntu repositories?\n\nA: After a lot of googling outside of Ubuntu-specific or Debian-specific pages, I found this one that was actually rather helpful. Basically, the suggestion is to keep it something like this:\nproj/\nproj/bin/proj.py                 # this will just \"import proj\" and \"main()\"\nproj/proj/__init__.py            # this will just \"import window.py\" and run that\nproj/proj/window.py              # main functionality\nproj/proj/submodule/__init__.py  # import in window.py\nproj/proj/test/                  # for that test package that quickly also uses\nproj/README                      # basic readme file\nproj/setup.py                    # standard distutils setup.py\n\nThis sounds more sensible to me than the quickly way, and closer to my original way of doing it. And it shouldn't be impossible to make it into a Debian package that follows the Ubuntu guidelines? So I think I will just erase the quickly stuff and do this. Unless anyone has a better suggestion?\nWhat remains here then is \"how do I set this up to install well on Ubuntu, as well as Windows?\", i.e. should I code setup.py in a special way or make other considerations in the code...\n", "Q: Why is Seahorse messing up my Samba sharing?

I one drive in my computer.  it is encrypted with LUKS, and I almost successfully installed Ubuntu 12.04 onto it.  the only issue is the bootloader - GRUB2 would not install anywhere.  tried an external USB drive and the internal drive.\nI also tried to make my own grub, which worked better, but still didn't actually boot the drive.  that fell back into busybox or initramfs or something.\nso is there any way to boot into an LUKS-encrypted drive?\n\nA: The alternate install has support for Luks-Encrypted LVM roots. It even has a \"Guided\" partition mode for encrypted LVM\nYou will need your /boot partition mounted on non-encrypted media. This means either a separate /boot partition (the \"Guided\" default), or a USB drive holding your boot partition (if using the latter, you can also store your encryption key on it). This is because your computer cannot execute encrypted code. You need some unencrypted code to unlock the encrypted drive. If you use the USB drive option, make sure you have it inserted and mounted at /boot any time you update. (You could probably make a script to remind you, too...)\nA special note: Using a separate boot partition on the same drive to store your bootloader code opens you up to the possibility of an \"evil maid\" attack, whereby someone with persistent access to your computer can modify your bootloader to record your password, then come back and retrieve it after next time you type your password. If you're just using encryption to protect your files in case of theft, then you don't have to worry about this. If this is a concern for you, keep your /boot on a thumb drive, and keep the thumb drive safe.\nP.S: I'm writing this from a LUKS-Encrypted Archlinux system, with a drive that looks something like this:\n/dev/sda:\n    sda1: /boot - ext2 128M\n    sda2: LUKS encrypted partition ~300GB\n        LVM Physical Volume ~300GB\n            logical volume: /root ext4 296GB\n            logical volume: swap 4GB\n\nI highly recommend this setup.\nHibernate is working fine, even though swap is on an encrypted partition (but it might not on Ubuntu). If you want a separate /home partition, that's easily done by adding another volume to the LVM. All of this should be achievable from the Ubuntu alternate install.\n", "Q: Why does apache keep running out of memory?

Most of the time when I do a cd command I also do a ls to see what other files or folder are in that directory. So I want to execute ls everytime I change the directory. I know I can do cd foo && ls but is it really necessary to do && ls everytime?\n\nA: There are 2 ways to do this. You can create an alias as LnxSlck posted or another one is creating a function in .bash_aliases\nmycd(){ cd \"$1\" && ls; }\n\n\nA: I use the following, which doesn't involve adding any new commands: \ncd() {\n  builtin cd \"$@\"\n  local status=$?\n  [ $status -eq 0 ] && ls\n  return $status\n}\n\nThis makes cd work the same as before, except that there's also an ls.\nNote the following implications: The other examples don't permit arguments to cd. While admittedly those arguments are uncommon, this is a 100% compatible drop-in replacement. And because it returns cd's exit status, it won't break scripts.\nThere's one caveat here. If you ever don't want this functionality, you have to call builtin cd. But my experience in using this function for many years is that such occurrances are rare, occurring primarily in scripts, and the convenience of not having to type something long like mycd every time you want to change directories greatly outweighs the minor drawback of typing builtin cd once in a blue moon.\n\nA: You can make an alias for cd, and add it to your *bash_profile* or bashrc, something like:\nalias 'mycd'='cd $1 && ls'\n\nput that in your .bashrc . It is however recommended that you store all your aliases in ~/bash_aliases file, so create the file using touch ~/.bash_aliases if it's not already present and use it to store all your aliases.\n", "Q: How do I increase the open files limit for a non-root user?

Save it. \nRead the file using bind ~/.inputrc command or restart a new terminal. Things should work.. \n\nA: I figured out that skipping words to the left by triggering Ctrl+Left\ndidn't work (even not when I added some code into ~/.inputrc or ~/.zshrc)\nbecause by default this shortcut is already used in Ubuntu (it resizes the current window horizontally). You can change the default shortcut in the \nSystem -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcut menu.\nI just replaced Ctrl+Left by Ctrl+Down to liberate it. After this replacement, skipping words to the left using Ctrl+Left works fine!

Something like this:-\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Foo\nExec=/usr/bin/foo %u\nType=Application\nNoDisplay=true\nCategories=System;\nMimeType=x-scheme-handler/foo;\n\nThis allows a user to click a foo:// link in the browser to launch my app. However firefox pops up a \"Launch Application\" dialog box to ask the user which application to launch, with mine being the default. \nHow can I suppress this dialog box so that firefox just launches the application without requiring the popup confirmation. \n\nA: You should consider adding a RDF schema in your ~/.mozilla/firefox/PROFILE/mimeTypes.rdf file, such as:\n<RDF:Description RDF:about=\"urn:scheme:foo\"\n               NC:value=\"foo\">\n               <NC:handlerProp RDF:resource=\"urn:scheme:handler:foo\"/>\n</RDF:Description>\n\nOr, if this doesn't work:\n<RDF:Description RDF:about=\"urn:mimetype:handler:foo\"\n   NC:alwaysAsk=\"false\"\n   NC:useSystemDefault=\"true\"\n   NC:saveToDisk=\"false\">\n   <NC:externalApplication RDF:resource=\"urn:mimetype:externalApplication:foo\"/>\n</RDF:Description>\n\n\nA: When the Launch Application dialog comes up for the first time, click the box that says \"Remember my choice\", then click OK.\n\n\nA: Firefox has got a system that recognizes the file extension or browser bar extension. \nIn the Firefox Preferences (Menu -> Edit -> Preferences -> Applications) you can specify what to do when opening which file. \nThat what you are looking for is an application protocol. With this, you can open a specific file or launch an application.\nThese scheme-handlers are stored in a the file ~/.mozilla/firefox/YOUR_PROFILE_ID/mimeTypes.rdf. Open the .rdf file with gedit or your favorite text editor.\nNow you should see XML text. You can divide the file into a header, the schemes and the footer.\nA normal entry looks like this:\n<RDF:Description RDF:about=\"urn:scheme:NAME\"\n     NC:value=\"ENTER YOUR VALUE\">\n    <NC:handlerProp RDF:resource=\"urn:scheme:handler:NAME\"/>\n</RDF:Description>\n\nNow you can edit the scheme-handler file and add your own entry.

This can be seen by this line in your /etc/fstab from sda9:\n#UUID=3a7e4da4-1e7c-4c01-9b8b-b2a7248c62f5 /boot           ext4    defaults        0       2\nI don't know why this is commented out, but it appears to be a mistake. This caused your grub.cfg not to contain any entries for Ubuntu because update-grub creates an entry for each kernel found in /boot/, since your /boot/ partition wasn't mounted you didn't have any kernels in /boot/ and thus no Ubuntu entries were made.\nTo fix this from a LiveCD/USB, first mount the partition containing your Ubuntu installation's root filesytem: sudo mount /dev/sda9 /mnt/ then edit your fstab: gksudo gedit /mnt/etc/fstab. That last command should open your fstab in gedit, find the line\n#UUID=3a7e4da4-1e7c-4c01-9b8b-b2a7248c62f5 /boot           ext4    defaults        0       2\nand uncomment it (remove the '#' character from the beginning of the line) then save your changes and exit gedit.\nWith your fstab fixed, you can now re-install grub and you should get options for both Ubuntu and Windows at boot. Using boot repair to re-install grub will probably work, but I would personally recommend following this guide instead:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#ChRoot\n\nA: Run Boot-Repair, update it, click Recommended Repair.

I installed the 3.4 kernel for hardware support reasons, and everything is working swimmingly.. but UpdateManager keeps prompting me to install the 3.2 kernel again. Is there a way to stop it doing that?\n\nA: Update Manager only does one thing, it updates things, it updates your repository list and updates the packages found in those repositories you have in your sources.\nIt does not downgrade anything, you get the update for Kernel 3.2 because you have a 3.2 kernel installed. Now since you installed the 3.4 kernel and don't want to be bothered again for updates for the 3.2 version, simply remove the 3.2 packages.\nOpen Synaptic (if you don't have it install it sudo apt-get install synaptic)then search for  \"linux 3.2\" if you don't get proper results try with \"linux image\" or \"linux headers\" adding the version \"3.2\" and uninstall them.\nVoilá! you won't be bothered again with the upgrade for 3.2.\n\nA: No one is downgrading your 3.4 kernel. Update Manager is simply upgrading your existing 3.2 kernel to the newer release. You will still boot 3.4 by default.\nIt's a good idea to keep stock kernels around, but if you want to stop the above behavior, simply open a terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove linux-image-3.2\\*\n\n\nA: I was in the same situation: Using the kernel 3.4.0 because a hardware issue with the stock kernel, and being afraid to install the propossed kernel updates in the update manager. \nBut like the people is saying here, that update just updates the old kernel, and that's all. That means that your grub will continue booting with your 3.4 kernel like always.\nYou can update witouth fear.\n\nA: You could pin the new kernel package. But that would mean you'd get no updates on that either. Assuming the new (3.4) kernel comes form a different repository than the old (3.2), you could try to play with the apt repository priorities -- favoring the 3.4 over the 3.2. Obviously the current setup is the other way round, or it would not ask you to downgrade (normally, the higher version wins).\nYou might further look at this question at superuser, which describes a similar topic.\nEdit: If you didn't install the kernel using a package file, but rather compiled (and installed) it manually -- the packaging system will never know about. So there will be no automatic updates to your new kernel however (unless you apply them manually again). So in this case, you can simply pin the currently installed 3.2 kernel packages, until one of the repositories provides 3.4+ packages you want to use. Remember to update your 3.4 kernel manually in this case.\n\nA: Update Manager , proposes all sorts of Update , including distribution upgrades too. \nThe best way in your scenario to avoid the 3.2 Kernel Downgrade would be to use alternate and back-end method of using Gnome-terminal or Command Line Interface[CLI]  for Updating.\nEnter these commands, \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThis will search for Updated packages and install them similar to the function of Update Manager ,but if Kernel upgrades are found , it will not download and install them , but will provide a message like \n\nFollowing packages were not Upgraded.\n\nWhereas upgrading to newer available kernel requires use of \nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThis is actually like a workaround  , since you are using Both the official repositories provided Kernel and Mainline Kernel. If you specifically want only this kernel to be present in your system , then refer the Uri Herrera suggestion. But having a official Stable kernel  present is always recommended .\n", "Q: Cannot activate num pad at all I have two accounts on the same machine.

I have a number of LVM partitions, each containing an Ubuntu installation. Occasionally, I want to do an apt-get dist-upgrade, to update an installation to the most recent packages. I do this with chroot - the process is usually something like:\n$ sudo mount /dev/local/chroot-0 /mnt/chroot-0\n$ sudo chroot /mnt/chroot-0 sh -c 'apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade'\n$ sudo umount /mnt/chroot-0\n\n[ not shown: I also mount and unmount /mnt/chroot-0/{dev,sys,proc} as bind-mounts to the real /dev, /sys and /proc, as the dist-upgrade seems to expect these to be present ]\nHowever, after upgrading to precise, this process no longer works - the final umount will fail because there are still open files on the /mnt/chroot-0 filesystem. lsof confirms that there are processes with open files in the chroot. These processes have been started during the dist-upgrade, I'm assuming this is because certain services in the chroot need to be restarted (eg, through service postgresql restart) after the package is upgraded.\nSo, I figure I need to tell upstart to stop all the services that are running within this chroot. Is there a way to reliably do this?\nI've tried:\ncat <<EOF | sudo chroot /mnt/chroot-0 /bin/sh\n# stop 'initctl' services \ninitctl list | awk '/start\\/running/ {print \\$1}' | xargs -n1 -r initctl stop\nEOF\n\nWhere initctl list  seems to do the right thing and only list processes that have been started in this particular root. I've tried adding this too, as suggested by Tuminoid:\ncat <<EOF | sudo chroot /mnt/chroot-0 /bin/sh\n# stop 'service' services\nservice --status-all 2>/dev/null |\n    awk '/^ \\[ \\+ \\]/ { print \\$4}' |\n    while read s; do service \\$s stop; done\nEOF\n\nHowever, these doesn't seem to catch everything; processes that have daemonised and been reparented to PID 1 don't get stopped. I've also tried:\nsudo chroot /mnt/chroot-0 telinit 0\n\nBut in this case, init doesn't distinguish between the separate roots and shuts down the entire machine.\nSo, is there any way to tell init to stop all processes in a particular chroot, so that I can safely unmount the filesystem? Does upstart have any facility to SIGTERM/SIGKILL all child processes (as would be done during regular shutdown) within a chroot?\n\nA: I don't trust anything but the kernel to keep a sane state here, so I don't (ab)use init to get this job done, nor do I count on myself actually knowing what is or isn't mounted (some packages can mount extra filesystems, like binfmt_misc).  So, for process slaughter, I use:\nPREFIX=/mnt/chroot-0\nFOUND=0\n\nfor ROOT in /proc/*/root; do\n    LINK=$(readlink $ROOT)\n    if [ \"x$LINK\" != \"x\" ]; then\n        if [ \"x${LINK:0:${#PREFIX}}\" = \"x$PREFIX\" ]; then\n            # this process is in the chroot...\n            PID=$(basename $(dirname \"$ROOT\"))\n            kill -9 \"$PID\"\n            FOUND=1\n        fi\n    fi\ndone\n\nif [ \"x$FOUND\" = \"x1\" ]; then\n    # repeat the above, the script I'm cargo-culting this from just re-execs itself\nfi\n\nAnd for umounting chroots, I use:\nPREFIX=/mnt/chroot-0\nCOUNT=0\n\nwhile grep -q \"$PREFIX\" /proc/mounts; do\n    COUNT=$(($COUNT+1))\n    if [ $COUNT -ge 20 ]; then\n        echo \"failed to umount $PREFIX\"\n        if [ -x /usr/bin/lsof ]; then\n            /usr/bin/lsof \"$PREFIX\"\n        fi\n        exit 1\n    fi\n    grep \"$PREFIX\" /proc/mounts | \\\n        cut -d\\  -f2 | LANG=C sort -r | xargs -r -n 1 umount || sleep 1\ndone\n\nAs an addendum, I'd point out that approaching this as an init problem is probably the wrong way to look at it, unless you actually have an init in the chroot and a separate process space (ie: in the case of LXC containers).  With a single init (outside the chroot), and a shared process space, this is no longer \"init's problem\", but rather just up to you to find the processes that happen to have the offending path, hence the above proc walk.\nIt's not clear from your initial post if these are fully-bootable systems that you're just upgrading externally (which is how I read it), or if they're chroots that you use for things like package builds.  If it's the latter, you might also want a policy-rc.d in place (like the one dropped in by mk-sbuild) that just forbids init jobs starting in the first place.  Obviously, that's not a sane solution if these are meant to be bootable systems as well.\n\nA: You already identified the problem yourself: Some things run service ... during dist-upgrade and service isn't part of Upstart, but part of sysvinit. Add similar awk magic around service --status-all to stop sysvinit services as you used for Upstart services.\n\nA: I know this question is pretty old, but I think it is as relevant today as it was in 2012, and hopefully someone finds this code useful. I wrote the code for something I was doing, but thought I'd share it.\nMy code is different, but the ideas are very similar to @infinity (in fact - the only reason I now know about /proc/*/root is because of his answer - thanks @infinity!). I also added some cool additional functionality\n#Kills any PID passed to it\n#At first it tries nicely with SIGTERM\n#After a timeout, it uses SIGKILL\nKILL_PID()\n{\n        PROC_TO_KILL=$1\n\n        #Make sure we have an arg to work with\n        if [[ \"$PROC_TO_KILL\" == \"\" ]]\n        then\n                echo \"KILL_PID: \\$1 cannot be empty\"\n                return 1\n        fi\n\n        #Try to kill it nicely\n        kill -0 $PROC_TO_KILL &>/dev/null && kill -15 $PROC_TO_KILL\n\n        #Check every second for 5 seconds to see if $PROC_TO_KILL is dead\n        WAIT_TIME=5\n\n        #Do a quick check to see if it's still running\n        #It usually takes a second, so this often doesn't help\n        kill -0 $PROC_TO_KILL &>/dev/null &&\n        for SEC in $(seq 1 $WAIT_TIME)\n        do\n                sleep 1\n\n                if [[ \"$SEC\" != $WAIT_TIME ]]\n                then\n                        #If it's dead, exit\n                        kill -0 $PROC_TO_KILL &>/dev/null || break\n                else\n                        #If time's up, kill it\n                        kill -0 $PROC_TO_KILL &>/dev/null && kill -9 $PROC_TO_KILL\n                fi\n        done\n}\n\nNow you would do 2 things to make sure chroot can be unmounted:\nKill all processes that may be running in the chroot:\nCHROOT=/mnt/chroot/\n\n#Find processes who's root folder is actually the chroot\nfor ROOT in $(find /proc/*/root)\ndo\n        #Check where the symlink is pointing to\n        LINK=$(readlink -f $ROOT)\n\n        #If it's pointing to the $CHROOT you set above, kill the process\n        if echo $LINK | grep -q ${CHROOT%/}\n        then\n                PID=$(basename $(dirname \"$ROOT\"))\n                KILL_PID $PID\n        fi\ndone\n\nKill all processes that may be running outside of the chroot, but interfering with it (ex: if your chroot is /mnt/chroot and dd is writing to /mnt/chroot/testfile, /mnt/chroot will fail to unmount)\nCHROOT=/mnt/chroot/\n\n#Get a list of PIDs that are using $CHROOT for anything\nPID_LIST=$(sudo lsof +D $CHROOT 2>/dev/null | tail -n+2 | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | sort -nu)\n\n#Kill all PIDs holding up unmounting $CHROOT\nfor PID in $PID_LIST\ndo\n        KILL_PID $PID\ndone\n\nNote: Run all code as root\nAlso, for a less complex version, replace KILL_PID with either kill -SIGTERM or kill -SIGKILL\n\nA: jchroot: a chroot with more isolation. \nAfter your command has been executed, any process started by the execution of this command will be killed, any IPC will be freed, any mount point will be unmounted.

As you said it: X is low level, Gnome/KDE (very roughly speaking) does the actual interface drawing.\n\nA: Actually, it technically doesn't require /usr/bin/X, if you leave out the display manager.\nDesktop environments, and the graphical programs that comprise them, depend on the package x11-common in Ubuntu.

It still appears that hdfs's open file limits have not been increased beyond the 1024 default:\n[bash]$ sudo lsof | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr\n   2145 root\n   1495 hdfs\n    610 mapred\n    359 www-data\n    305 rdm\n    116 mysql\n     83 rabbitmq\n     32 messagebus\n     30 snmp\n     25 ntp\n     23 syslog\n     16 daemon\n      1 USER\n\nAs I've done more research its becoming clear that increasing the file size limits is highly system dependent (even within Ubuntu; here, here, and here), so I wanted to see what the Ubuntu method is. Does anyone know how to increase these limits in Ubuntu 10.04?\nI definitely prefer solutions that do not increase the limits for all users, but at this point I would be willing to try anything. Thanks for your help! \n\nA: In order to set these limits, I did a combination of things found here and here. Since I want to restrict these file limits to the hdfs and mapred users, I added each of these users to the hadoop group on my system and edited /etc/security/limits.conf to include the line:\n@hadoop hard nofile 16384\n\nwhich allows both users to open as many as 16384 files at once, which is apparently important in pseudo-distributed mode. I also had to add the following line to /etc/pam.d/common-session:\nsession required pam_limits.so\n\nwhich makes these file limits persist across daemon processes like hdfs and mapred. After restarting the server, everything appears to be working perfectly as hdfs currently has more than the default number (1024) files open:\n[dsftar01 ~]$ sudo lsof | awk '{if(NR>1) print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr\n   1972 root\n   1530 hdfs\n    608 mapred\n    360 www-data\n    166 rdm\n     97 mysql\n     83 rabbitmq\n     41 nobody\n     35 syslog\n     31 messagebus\n     30 snmp\n     25 ntp\n     16 daemon\n\n\nA: add ulimit -n 16384 to hdfs users .bashrc (or /etc/profile this will set the value for all users]\nIf the user does not have a home directory append ulimit -n 16384 to /etc/profile\nThen you have to restart the computer.\n", "Q: Unsolved Mystery: \"mountall: Disconnected from Plymouth\" When I boot, it goes straight into tty1.

If I get those logs I can parse them and find out bandwidth usages\nEdit:\nI actually want to implement a bandwidth tracking system which can track how much data, a user is downloaded form my site. or uploaded to my site. I searched in stackoverflow and found an answer which suggests parsing log file. I need to automate this so that website itself will parse the log and show the details.any idea?\n\nA: I would be careful with trying to access the Apache log from anywhere other than local or SSH.  Accessing the log files for Apache via PHP or a nonsecure method is not safe, as those logs can contain connection related information in them which if leaked puts users at risk.\nI would, if I were you, just download the log file via SFTP or rsync or scp via SSH to your system, and then analyze the logs, rather than try and have PHP serve the log file to you.\n\nA: I would agree with the other answer and recommend against serving log files via php for apache. Just as a tiny aside, if you are used to php, it can also be run as a scripting language without needing apache. So you can copy your logs and run your php script over them as well.\nSince you mentioned bandwidth usage, I would suggest trying out awstats and webalizer for such usage.\n\nA: I have made very simple php script at\nhttp://malton.duckdns.org/log.php\nall you have to do is copy access log to your server root \nand run php script like the one I made above 1 link\n ! or track visitors\nwith php which is like this.

I want to know why the named daemon is running, do I need it running for my VPS to work properly ?\nCan I stop or remove it ?\n\n\nA: /usr/sbin/named is provided by the bind9 package. bind9 is a DNS server. If this is a VPS, it's quite possible you need that package. But you can probably remove it and see what happens, and then put it back if you need it.\nsudo apt-get remove bind9\n\nThe removal might want to remove other packages, including quite important ones for you. So make sure to pay attention to that before proceeding with the removal. This may also reveal why bind9 is installed--it may be a dependency of other packages that you are using.\nPlease note that I'm not saying you should be doing this--only that you probably can, if you want. If you do this, then even if the server stops working properly, you'll probably still be able to access the Internet to download and reinstall the package. However, it's possible that you will not be able to, or that you will not be able to re-SSH to the server if your connection gets broken. (Thanks to tgm4883 for pointing this out.)\nYou can substantially mitigate the risk of problems by making sure you have the necessary .deb files cached to reinstall bind9 and its dependencies:\nsudo apt-get --download-only --reinstall install bind9\n\nIf you've run that recently, and not run sudo apt-get clean since, then you should be able to reinstall bind9 even if you cannot connect to the Ubuntu download servers after removing it:\nsudo apt-get install bind9\n\nYou may need to run sudo apt-get update before either of the above two commands.\nIf you don't want to remove bind9 at all, but just see what would be removed if you did (which may reveal why it's installed), you can simulate its removal:\napt-get -s remove bind9\n\n", "Q: What is the advantage of using symbolic link? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat is different symbolic link with hard link after unlik?\nSymbolic links vs Hard links \n\nI'm a new user to Ubuntu.

Or it is the way it should be done?\n\nA: \nA symbolic link is a special file type whose data contains a filename.\n  This filename is essentially a \"soft link\" to another file. Whenever\n  the kernel encounters a symbolic link file type, it reads the filename\n  in the data part of the file and goes to that filename.

I've already used Compiz-Config Settings Manager to set the bottom right corner to invoke expo, but is there an application or something similar that I can use to replicate that lovely ripple?\n\nA: Unfortunately, no you cannot.\nUnity uses Compiz to do its effects, whereas Cinnamon uses a Window Manager known as Muffin, which is a itself a fork of Mutter.

I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on a HP Pavilion dv6. About a week after setting up my dual-boot Win7/Ubuntu, my laptop speakers began a soft popping sound on roughly 5 second intervals. It's the damnedest thing; the popping will occur at the same volume regardless of the system volume (even when muted).

Any help you can give me would be great, even if you just point me in the right direction, I truly am stuck here.\n\nA: After reading your comments, I have found that, unfortunately, it means your hard disk is malfunctioning at a very low level. If you could find another hard disk(bigger than the damaged one), and a Ubuntu live CD, you can try to get files from the disk(this assumes the failed disk is /dev/sda and the good disk is dev/sdb, and the main partition is /dev/sdb1, which is EXT4.:\nsudo apt-get install ddrecue\nmkdir /mnt/sdb1\nmount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdb1\nddrescue /dev/sda /mnt/sdb1/sdaimage.dd /mnt/sdb1/sdaimage.dd.log\n\nYou may interrupt the last command fir any reason, and due to the logfile, it will resume at the same location. Feel free to run it a few times so that it can try to re-read bad areas.\nNow, let's try to mount:\nGet the info associated with the analysis in testdisk.\nNow, we need to mount. Find the offset of the partition with all of your data(If you post the testdisk output, I can give you that), and use it as <offset> is the following command: \nmkdir /mnt/recover\nmount -o loop,ro,offset=<offset> hda.img /mnt/recover\n\nHopefully, your data is in /mnt/recover. \nIf it fails, there is another method I can add if you need it.\n", "Q: How do I find out USB Speed from a terminal? I am using Ubuntu 12.04 . I am here to know is there any way to observe Writing & Reading Speed of the USB through the terminal . \n\nA: You can use rsync to give an approximation of your transfer speed, although it will vary depending on whether small or large files are being transferred and whether the destination is a slow flash drive or a fast external hard disk. For example:\nrsync -avviu ~/Videos /media/Mik2\n\nsent 874419803 bytes  received 149 bytes  4427442.79 bytes/sec\ntotal size is 874312527  speedup is 1.00\n\n(Also, if you open tail -f /var/log/kern.log and then connect your device you can see whether it is being set up for ehci (enhanced host controller interface), which supports USB 2 speeds. For example, the kernel log should state 'new high-speed USB device...using ehci_hcd'.)  \n\nA: This answer is a little bit off the exact question since I am using ubuntu 20.04, I haven't tested it on other versions, but I think this may also be helpful.\nThis way is much easier for me:\n\n*\n\n*Run gnome-disks in terminal, open the GUI interface. (You can also just search it in application list.)\n\n\n*Click the disk you want to test -> Device Options -> Benchmark Disk -> Start Benchmark\n\n\nThis shows speed of the USB drive, not that of the USB port.\n\nA: I was curious about this as I had a SATA 3 SSD I wanted to use for  processing some video files (to keep i/o waits at a minimum) but I had only SATA 2 (3Gbps) ports available on the system, but also a USB3 port available. \nYou can determine the theoretical maximum speed of the port for each USB port with the command sudo lsusb -vvv |grep -i -B5 -A5 bcdUSB\nThe bcdUSB line returns the USB version of the port.\nAn example from one of my systems:\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp.

At the moment when I want to do this, I first dump the original version of a file with bzr cat -r123 file > file.r123 and run gvimdiff in a separate step, which is tedious.\n\nA: You want\nbzr diff --using gvimdiff [file]\nOr open the \"User Configuration\" menu of bzr explorer, and set gvimdiff as an external diff application ; this will be offered at the top of the built in diff.\nMy qbzr.conf reads :\n\n[DEFAULT]\nconfig_window_size = 651x422\ndiff_window_size = 780x580\ndefault_diff = gvimdiff\n[EXTDIFF]\ngvimdiff = gvimdiff\n\nI think the difficulty with the config is that the first column is the name of the diff option ; the second is the command (and accepts certain keyword expansion sequences as well).\n", "Q: Paper gets out HL-2250DN to slow I've got a printer 'Brother HL-2250DN'.\nMy problem: it sometimes prints extremely slow...!\nMy Ubuntu: Precise Pangolin\n\nA: In the printer dialog you can select under Print -> Order -> Priority.

(is it running another instance of samba behind the scenes? If so, where is the smb.conf file for it?\n\n*Why the redundancy? \n\n*Are there any other mechanisms to share folders?\nFor reference, this is all on Ubuntu 12.04, from a virtual machine (Virtual Box) from within Windows 7 64.\n\nA: Both mechanisms are based on Samba. The first time you share a folder from Nautilus, it prompts you to install Samba. The configuration is managed by Nautilus ; you don't need root access (except to install Samba).\nOther ways of sharing files...\n\n\n*\n\n*SFTP : install openssh and you get secure FTP which will work with clients like Filezilla (GUI) or plain old scp\n\n*VirtualBox : The guest extensions include a mechanism for mounting folders from your host - create shared folders and mount them as instructed in the manual\n\n*NFS : The Linux network file system\n\n*RDP sharing : The rdesktop utility can provide access to client folders on the server using the -disk option\n\n*FTP : the bog standard\n\n*And more...\n\n\nOf these? I use RDP shares, VirtualBox shares, SFTP, and I mount CIFS / SMB shares on Linux.\n", "Q: Are gcc versions tied to kernel versions? Is there any link between gcc versions and the version of a kernel ? Specifically, would I be able to install a very old version of gcc onto the latest kernel. Alternatively would I be able to build the latest version of gcc on a very old kernel? Are there any compatibility problems between the two for any version ??\n\nA: I would be wary of using older GCC versions on newer systems, especially if the older version's executables arent named gcc-1.3 (for example, if in this instance the version is 1.3), because otherwise it may conflict with the current version used for everything on your Ubuntu system, and break things.\nTo answer your question though, the kernel and GCC aren't directly related, but its likely the kernel was built with the GCC version you're using (or slightly older).\n\nA: You might have trouble compiling new kernels with very old versions of GCC.\nBesides that, no, GCC versions are not tied to the Linux kernel's version:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can run an ancient GCC version on a system with a new kernel.\n\n*You can run a new GCC version on a system with a very old kernel. The only thing that would stop you from doing this would be if your new GCC version requires a version of libc that will not run on that kernel. But this is not a particularly likely scenario.\n\n\nWith that said, you should be careful about installing an older GCC over a newer GCC, since the newer GCC may be needed. If you're building GCC yourself from source, you can configure the build to install in its own prefix (rather than /usr). If this still breaks builds, make sure the newer GCC (which was there before) is in a directory earlier in the PATH environment variable than the older GCC (which you more recently installed).\n\nA: Yes. Some new kernel features need the last version of gcc and glibc to work fine. But it's not a restricted constraint like kernel 3.0.2 work only with gcc 4.2.1. It's more like kernel 3.x work only with gcc 4.2.x\n", "Q: Grub2 Screen Navigation Once I select a submenu from the main menu in grub (I.E.) \"Previous Linux Versions\" it seems I'm forced to only choose an item in the submenu without no option to navigate up to the main menu again. Is there a keystroke I'm missing to 'abort' a submenu and go back to the main screen?\n\nA: Did you try to use the 'Esc' key? With this key you can abort the submenu selection.\n\nA: Press Esc to navigate to a previous menu. You can do this if you've entered the editor for a commend list, also.\n", "Q: How can I install a NC375i network card on Ubuntu 12.04?

When using the apt-get install method to install a package onto ubuntu, is there any fundamental difference between obtaining the source code for that package and building it from scratch? Does the apt-get install functionality simply download source and build it on your machine to a specified directory or is there more going on behind the scenes ? \nFinally (maybe this has no answer) is one method better than the other? What I am angling at here is does the build it yourself from source code have any advantages or is it better to let apt-get do its thing?\n\nA: If you build from source, you have more options in what's included. Installing from apt-get just installs a pre-built package.\nAs for which is better, it depends on what you need it for. I've never needed to compile from source but I don't do anything very extensive on my ubuntu laptop.\n\nA: The advantages of a package management system such as apt, yum, pacman, emerge, etc include:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's easy to query what version of a package is installed or available. \n\n*It's easy to remove a package entirely, making sure all its files are gone. \n\n*It's easy to verify the integrity of the packages files, so you can see if it's been corrupted or tampered with. \n\n*It's easy to upgrade a package by installing the new version and removing all the old versions files. This will make sure not to leave any lingering files from the old package around to confuse or break things. \n\n*It's easy to see what packages require or provide things that other packages provide or require, so you can be sure to have the needed items for the package to function correctly. \n\n*It's easy to install or remove groups of packages. \n\n*In many cases it's possible to downgrade back to a previous version of a package, for example when a new version has a bug. \n\n\nAlthough it is for Fedora, see also: \nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_management_system\nInstalling from source may have advantages \n\n\n*\n\n*You can customize the binaries (enable / disable options)\n\n*More up to date package then is available in the repositories\n\n*Sometimes necessary for bug fixes\n\n\nBut the disadvantages are that you will have to then manually update the package when a new version is available and you will often loose support.\nIMO if you wish to compile all or most of your packages, I would advise Gentoo.\n\nA: Apt-get is APT package handling utility (CLI), back-end to Synaptic and Aptitude.\nThe apt-get method on triggering  from your system checks the official sources or repositories listed in  the file \netc/apt/sources.list\nFor eg. on running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade (which i use) , runs something like \n\nwhere the Ign (Ignore) in-front of the Link states that no change is made since last visit to that repositories , and the Get states the retrieval of Sources file stating the changes of newly available package in that Repository .\nNo , apt-get utility doesn't downloads the Source File , it rather downloads the .deb package packed and released by the Official Ubuntu Packagers which has been tested for Stability and Integration with your system.\nThe apt-get downloaded packages can be found in \n/var/cache/apt \nwhere you can see all the Updates as .deb packages , and you can even compare to cross-check their version by visiting this Precise-updates packages.\nAs far as Compiling from source packages is concerned , it is not advisable and not even recommended for Ubuntu 12.04 as it a LTS Release ,you can view the reasons here\nIs it better to compile from source or to install from a .deb package? \nWould compiling programs from source speed up my operating system?\nAdvantages/Disadvantages of installing from source code\nFor further References : apt-get, sources.list.\n\nA: I think you can use apt-get to install sources of packages. \n\n\n*\n\n*You need to activate source code repositories\nOpen /etc/apt/sources.list file, you will see commented out lines (starts with #) which have \"source\" on them.\nUncomment them\n\n*Install dependencies of the program you want: \nsudo apt-get build-dep \"program\" \n\n*Download and compile your program:\nsudo apt-get -b source \"program\"\nAfter that you get a .deb package on your home directory.\n", "Q: Annoying file system check, when starting the computer with WOL Sometimes I need to get some files from my desktop computer, so I send a wake on LAN package (using my laptop) to the computer and it turns on. But every 30 times I have to wait ~30 minutes for the file system check (and I can't cancel it through SSH or so).\nMany people would like to move the file system check to shutdown, but these projects and ideas seem to be quite abandoned:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutoFsck\nhttps://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/prompt-for-fsck-on-shutdown\nhttp://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/11021/\nI tried to use AutoFsck, but I did not succeed to get it work with LightDM - see: Run a script with user interaction on log out / shutdown?\nMaybe somebody has a different idea for an work a round?\nDisabling the file system check is not an option for me.\n\nA: I changed mine to run once every month with this command:\ntune2fs -i 1m /dev/sda1\nYou can find your device name with the mount command.\n\nA: I added a little more detail for the ' Run a script with user interaction on log out / shutdown?' \nideas on how to make it work through lightdm and posted those ideas here: Run a script with user interaction on log out / shutdown?\nBasically, you can prompt the user (or just go ahead and do AutoFsck without prompting) on lightdm shutdown.  The bottom line is block shutdown with a small init.d script that checks for a flag (i.e. file or contents of a file, like number of reboots) that is set and removed by your AutoFsck calling script. This way AutoFsck will definitely start and finish and the system will only shutdown once AutoFsck finishes.  With this script tandem, you can disable automatic file system checks in tune2fs because you implemented 'automatic' AutoFsck via lightdm or any other process you choose.\n", "Q: Console-only alternative for fslint?

(Ubuntu 12.04) I tried gparted, but it doesn't like seeing an ext4 file system without the partition type being specified (I suspect).  So it won't let me resize or anything since there is no partition.  It is occurring to me that having a non partitioned drive with data on it is playing with fire.  Worse yet, it is my /home mount point.  Obviously I can do a full backup of my data and start from the ground up but I was hoping someone would have an idea of how I can do it without spending time on the backup/restore.\nI realize this is a slim to none.  Here's to hoping for someone more creative than myself providing a slim.\nHere's a screenshot of the disk utility, showing what I mean by no partition:\n\nHere is my fdisk -l output:\nDisk /dev/sdb: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders, total 976773168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDisk /dev/sdb doesn't contain a valid partition table\n\nA: You cannot mount a drive for read/write that has no partitions on it.  If the drive has no partitions on it, then it is simply raw and means basically nothing.  Even in Windows, when you have one 'drive' - your C:\\ drive is literally just a partition.  You need a partition to utilize the drive, the partition needs to exist (and the MBR must know about it) if it is to be mounted, then a file system driver must exist in order to access it.\nIt sounds as though you have a drive with one partition, since you mentioned it has data on it.  That is very different from an non-partitioned drive.  There is nothing dangerous about having a non-partitioned drive, in my opinion, especially if it's a 'data only' drive.\nIf the drive in question only has 1 partition, and that 1 partition is the mount point of /home, then you can re-install Ubuntu on whatever drive you use for your root partition (/) and simply mount the drive you're speaking of as /home, just like you must be doing now.\nYou have a partition on that drive or you don't have data on that drive.  I think your terminology is getting confused, I suggest you open a terminal in recovery mode and type:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nI feel that will greatly benefit people trying to help you here.\nPS:\nI have a feeling what you mean is you have one partition, the shared libs are corrupted, and your home directory is mounted on this partition as well.  If this is the case, then you can simply copy your home partition off via:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/old_home_folder\nsudo mkdir /mnt/backup_drive\nsudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 /mnt/old_home_folder\nsudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/backup_drive\ncp -r /mnt/old_home_folder/<username> /mnt/backup_drive\n\nWhere \"username\" is your username, sda1 is your HDD where your home directory exists, and sdb is some HDD you plugged in.  This obviously varies a bit with setup so check what's going on with fdisk before doing anything.\nThen you can re-install and copy it back to your new home directory.\nHope that helps you some, sorry I can't help more, it's a bit unclear what your setup is.\n", "Q: Switching window manager/desktop environments? In general what is the approach to switch the desktop environment or window manager on Ubuntu? The main difference between stock Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Lubuntu is supposedly the use of Unity vs. KDE vs. LXDE.\nHowever, in order to try various desktop environments and window managers I don't want to have to reinstall the respective flavor from scratch just to get a particular desktop environments or window manager. There probably is an easier method than that.\nThe question: How can I easily test different desktop environments and respective compatible window managers (say KDE, LXDE, Unity, GNOME, XFCE and StumpWM)?\n\nA: Just install the one that you want.  For example to install LXDE, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo apt-get install lxde\n\nfor XFCE\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nfor Gnome\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell\n\nOnce you install the one you want, log out, choose the one you want, and log back in.\n\n\nA: This confused me too. Once a new new desktop environment is installed using apt as described by @Mitch, then it can be difficult to see where the option is at login in the Gnome Display Manager (GDM) to select your desktop. As @DanFromGermany said, the icon is next to your login.\nIn this picture on 13.10, you'll see that there is an icon to the right of my login name on the GDM screen - marked with a red arrow. This icon shows the desktop that will be active when you log in.\n\nIf you click this icon, you will get a list of the desktops available on this system.\n\nPick the one you want and log in - that desktop should then be available.\n\nA: I'd have answered the question \"Switching window manager [...] ?\" different:\nA WM (window manager) is something different than a desktop environment!  It's like shoes and feet ....\nJust try to switch the WM (window managers) back and forth.\nRight, it is not about installing the whole environment and stuff. \nThe WM can stand alone mostly. \nNo, it does not immediately kill your GUI - this is just about login and WM and  I use it with   Lunbuntu, XFCE4, Wayland, Gnome, Unity, Ubuntu-X, Ubuntu-Wayland, ....\nSo do not hesitate to run the config command just to try a different one.   It is fun and it does not break anything (my personal experience).\nI use it with Ubuntu 22.04 in the moment and it is still fun!\nWhat I really like are these: \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure sddm    (lovely! unknown WM login...)\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm     (really light; avoids f***-up due to \"energy saver\" problems!) \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm3    (well known, convenient!! until it crashes your machine due to the \"energy saver\" bulls***; typical Gnome, looks good until you find out all the problems and shortcomings and design issues and pitfalls and unresolved issues and and and ...) ignorance is bliss!   \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure slim \n(you need to type your name and pwd - it is so slim it does not even offer drop down - very interesting experience, nice!)\nIf one is not available just install it. Mostly there will be hints.  sudo apt-get install sddm  would be one solution in the arena under a debian circus tent.\nDo not miss this:   \nin the top left corner sddm and slim show the different available GUI flavours like Gnome, Unity, Ubuntu, w/o Wayland, XFCE etc.\nChoose before swaying at the display manager. No, it does not show you a screwed up desktop after successful user login. Actually it shows the same options like gdm3 (Gnome) in a different way of display. So you retain the choice of desktop surface when you chose your display manager.  \nCool, isn't it?\nAnd then? \nWell, you can just switch them again and again! There is no issue in just using a different one if you do not like the current one any longer.\n FF!\n\nA: There is a bug in awesome-ws, preventing it from showing up in the lightdm/gdm/kdm list.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/awesome/+bug/1094811\nDelete `NoDisplay=true' in /usr/share/xsessions/awesome.desktop solves the problem.\nIf this is solved, you have an icon next to your login where you can switch the window managers.\n", "Q: Close the notifications that hover over the current window Is it possible to dismiss the notifications that hover over the current window? I've noticed that they become translucent on mouseover (but they still tend to cover part of the current window!). Is it possible to actually close these notifications so that they will be slightly less irritating?\n\nA: As Lord of Time said, this is not possible at this time....well..sort of.\nThere is a patched NotifyOSD that will allow you to close them on click and various other customizations.\nSelected out-takes from http://www.webupd8.org\n\nThe patched NotifyOSD supports the following customizations:\n\n*\n\n*close the notifications on click\n\nThere are other options listed but that one pertains specifically to your question.\nThere is a lot of information on the page I linked to so I will not just copy it all here, but refer you to the page so you can read more about it and decide if it's something you want to do.\nYou will need to enable a custom PPA repository to install this fix. This fix actually upgrades the libnotify-bin so to uninstall it you will actually have to downgrade by purging the PPA to make the lower version available again.  This is easiest to do by installing Ubuntu Tweak.  Purging the PPA thru Ubuntu Tweak will automatically reinstall the most current official version of libnotify again.\n\nA: In a  terminal window, ctrl+alt+T, enter the command \nkillall notify-osd; exit\n\nwill do it and any pending notifications get purged too\nsee:  \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I use 'notify-send' to immediately replace an existing notification?\n\n*How to empty the queue of pending notifications?\n\n*How can I temporarily filter-out certain notification-bubbles coming from specific sources?\n\n*How to empty the queue of pending notifications?\n", "Q: Miro Guide or Ubuntu music store wouldnt open in Banshee I am using ubuntu 12.04, I recently updated from the 11.10 version.\nThe Miro guide or the Ubuntu music store wouldnt open in Banshee or Rhythmbox music player.\nit always leaves the following message:\nUnable to load page\nProblem occurred while loading the URL http://integrated-services.banshee.fm/miro/audio/home/\nCannot resolve proxy hostname ()\n\n\nA: There is no Ubuntu One music store for Banshee in Ubuntu 12.04.\nAs for the proxy hostname error, your proxy configuration is broken. You need to fix it by opening System Settings, going to Network, selecting the Network proxy item in the list, and either disabling or fixing the proxy.\nIf it is set to none, you can open the Terminal application, and run gsettings reset-recursively org.gnome.system.proxy to reset the configuration back to the default of having no proxy.\n", "Q: Wireless card power management I have noticed that when my computer in plugged in, the wireless strength increases. I'm assuming this is to do with power management.\nIs there a way to disable Wireless Power Management?\nI have found a few blog posts that show hacks to disable this but what is best practice here? Should there not be an option via the power menu that lets you toggle this?\nEDIT -- FILES AND LOGS AS REQUESTED\n/var/log/kern.log\nJul 11 11:45:27 CoolBreeze kernel: [    6.528052] postgres (1308):

what programs are available in Ubuntu to teach this Kids. This kids range from ages 4 to 13. Programs that help in math, science, drawing and chemistry would be very good.\n\nA: Go to the Ubuntu Software Center, Click on Education on the left side, and browse a list of educational programs.  I have most of which installed ( specially the ones listed below)on my kids machine, and they love it.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Educational suite GCompris\n\n*Childsplay\n\n*Primary Bundle\n\n\nA: Edubuntu is the educational distribution of Ubuntu.\n\nA: I would recommend using Edubuntu. You may do this by either downloading and installing the full distro, or getting any or all of the following packages(and recommends/dependencies thereof) and installing upon existing, well-customized (for stability, security, drivers, etc) Ubuntu installations, and removing previous desktop environment choices:\nedubuntu-desktop\nubuntu-edu-preschool\nubuntu-edu-primary\nubuntu-edu-secondary\nubuntu-edu-tertiary\n\nOr any other packages listed here.\n\nA: You should Try Tux4Kids\nThis is a big hit with my children and it has 3 main elements.

I finally did an 'apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded' in terminal (the old fashioned way!) and had no problem.\nJust a little editorial comment - from the wacky new nameserver system to this little glitch, Ubuntu isn't really showing the quality it did in the past, FWIW.  \n\nA: I found the solution to my problem here: ubuntugeek.com/how-to-fix-the-ubuntu-gpg-error-badsig.html\nsudo apt-get update\n\ngave me errors with BADSIG XXXXXX\nThe linked fix appears to replace the updaters keylist.\n", "Q: Why Can't I Download Certain Software?

Windows installation packages will not work (without installing the Windows compatibility layer, Wine) ; but it's usually best to find a native Linux program for a given task.\nInstalling software in Ubuntu is usually done through the software centre, or the Synaptic package manager, or using the command line apt-get utility. You can download .deb packages, or even download sources and compile them, but it's usually best to use a package manager if you can.\n\n\n*\n\n*For media playback, try the default Movie Player (Totem) or VLC\n\n*If you want to download YouTube content, check out this thread, especially the complete comments section.\n\n", "Q: install ubuntu (11.10 or above) on dell xps 17 - dual booting Some time ago I briefly looked into installing Ubuntu 11.10 (or above) on my dell xps17. I remember there were quite a few issues (sorry can't remember which ones, it was long time ago) and I was wondering if anybody could let me know if I can install it without having any problems at all (I would like to keep windows 7 there anyway).\nMy processor is Intel(r) Core(tm) i7-2720QM 2.2ghz.\n\nA: I have a Dell with a i5 2320 (Sandy Bridge) and have had no problems with 12.04.  Before that I had both 11.04 and 11.10 installed on my old Dell 2.8Ghz Dual core built in about 2004 and had no problems with either of those so I'm not sure what problems you saw.\nIn 12.04 I would suggest:\nInstalling mesa-utils will improve the display(mine was slightly too large for the screen without it)\nInstalling libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0 will provide the texture compression library needed for mesa to display some of the better games(Note: some games that need the s3tc compression will not load as they think that the card does not support it(Psyconauts is one) and must be forced in the terminal with force_s3tc_enable=true (program) (even with that my GPU will not run Psyconauts but will force enable others)\nThose are the only things I can think of so you should be fine installing 12.04 on your computer.\nNote: if you have a non-integrated GPU(AMD,Nvidia, ATI) you will need to install the proprietary drivers for those and there are plenty of answers here on askubuntu.  I will defer to those as I don't have any and have never had to install them.  From what I have seen in passing, hybrid graphic cards require some work to get working if they work at all, but again I cannot verify any of those problems myself. \n\nA: \n...I was wondering if anybody could let me know if I can install it\n  without having any problems at all...\n\nHi, if you want to know how to install Ubuntu in a dual boot configuration and you have never done it before, let me tell you it is a very simple and straightforward process. I found this graphical tutorial very easy to understand and hope it can answer your question in the best possible way.\nIn regards to the \"... without having any problems at all\", I don't see why you should have any, however, as with any other major system modification, you should always backup before installation, it's a best practice and won't leave you without your precious information in case anything goes wrong.\nAnd last but not least, if you actually find any issues in your way Ask Ubuntu, there is always an answer...\n\nA: I have a dell Studio xps 17 as well,\nOn 10.04 i had issues qith the video card, on 12.04 it seems to be fixed.\nThe only thing i had to 'tweak' was my headphone jacks. Both works now.\nIf you need to patch your headphone jacks, this worked for me:\nOpen alsa-base.conf:\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\nadd this line at the end of the file (last line)\noptions snd-hda-intel model=dell-m6\n\nBeside that's everything is smooth on 12.04.\n", "Q: Why does switching to the tty give me a blank screen? After booting to the GUI in 12.04, I attempt to move to the virtual terminal (or shell, or tty) via Ctrl-Alt-F1 (F1 through F6), and the screen remains blank. I have tried all 6 tty instances and the results are the same. Ctrl-alt-F7 brings me back to the GUI without a problem. Any thoughts?\n\nA: This is for newer version of Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the GRUB configuration file:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\n\n*Locate the line \n#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\nchange it to\nGRUB_GFXMODE=auto\n\nand save the file.\n\n*Then update grub\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: This is usually caused because the graphical text-mode resolution set at boot up is not compatible with your video card. The solution is to switch to true text-mode by configuring Grub appropriately:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Paste the below, and enter your password when asked:\nsudo sed -i -e 's/#GRUB_TERMINAL/GRUB_TERMINAL/g' /etc/default/grub\n\n\n*Then type sudo update-grub\n\n*Reboot and the virtual terminals should now work.\n\n\nA: What fixed this for me was adding nomodeset to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line in the /etc/default/grub file. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type in terminal: gksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*Search for this line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT\nSo for example if you have:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash usbcore.autosuspend=-1\"\n\nchange it to:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash usbcore.autosuspend=-1 nomodeset\"\n\n\n*After you finish, update grub (sudo update-grub) and reboot (sudo reboot) for the changes to take effect.\nOptional: You could add nomodeset vga=xxx (not just nomodeset), the xxx is a VESA screen code that best matches your screen resolution. Take a look at this.\n\nA: Please take a look at my question at https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/643882, with regards to virtual terminal not functioning on Ubuntu 16.04 on Lenovo Thinkpad T400. \nThe solution i presented is geared towards user with Hybrid Graphics Card, in particular, AMD/ATI graphics card and Intel integrated graphics card. For me, disabling the intel graphics card and enabling the opensource ATI/AMD radeon module helps in my case. \nIf you are using a old Radeon graphics card like mine (Radeon HD 3450/3470), now you can switch between virtual terminal and graphical desktop with ease to troubleshoot potential issues.\nIf adding blacklist intel_graphics_card in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and running \nsudo depmod -a \n\nstill doesn't work due to linux kernel or other dependencies, you are advised to add modprobe.blacklist=<module_name> to /etc/default/grub like the following example:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash crashkernel=384M-:128M radeon.dpm=1  modprobe.blacklist=i915\"\n\n\nA: You need to shut down the graphics driver after you Ctrl+Alt+F1 before you try to install the Nvidia driver\nAs in sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm stop\n\nA: Here is what worked for me on Ubuntu 18.04 with 2560x1440 screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*open grub configuration file in editor: sudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*uncomment GFXMODE and set your exact resolution -> change#GRUB_GFXMODE toGRUB_GFXMODE=2560x1440\n\n*add line GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep\n\n*Add remove splash and add nosplash noplymouth nomodeset to your GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. After cahnges mine looks like GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet nosplash noplymouth intel_idle.max_cstate=1 nomodeset\"\n\n*save the file\n\n*update grub sudo update-grub\n\n*reboot\n\n*use Ctlr+Alt+F2 to switch immediately after boot\n", "Q: How can I configure which filetypes can be opened by dragging to an application's launcher? When we drag some file from some web page or Nautilus towards the launcher, the application that in which it can be coppied remains highlighted and others fade out.\nSo where is this configuration file that decides which file can be dragged to which application in the launcher?\nFor example, right now, only a file of some document type can be dragged to Gwoffice and some binary file or deb file cant be drag and dropped. So how do I allow suppose a deb file to be draged and droped to Gwoffice.\nThat was just an example... I want to know how its done in general too.\n\nA: There is no general configuration file for that behavior. The launchers for the programs themselves, define which MIME types they can open, as per the FreeDesktop Desktop Entry Spec.\nThe reason you can't drag a .deb file to gwoffice for example, is because the program has no idea how to handle it, and if you did drag it to the launcher, it wouldn't work, even if you edited the launcher such that you could successfully drag it there.\n", "Q: opengl drivers broken, glxgears won't run When I try to run glxgears or ssh to a machine and use OpenGL with the -X flag, I get this error message:\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\nError: couldn't get an RGB, Double-buffered visual\n\nThe output of lspci is:\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family DRAM Controller (rev 09)\n00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200/2nd Generation Core Processor Family PCI Express Root Port (rev 09)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family MEI Controller #1 (rev 04)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 04)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 1 (rev b4)\n00:1c.2 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 3 (rev b4)\n00:1c.3 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 4 (rev b4)\n00:1c.5 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 6 (rev b4)\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #1 (rev 04)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation HM67 Express Chipset Family LPC Controller (rev 04)\n00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family 6 port SATA AHCI Controller (rev 04)\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family SMBus Controller (rev 04)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GF119 [GeForce GT 520M] (rev a1)\n07:00.0 Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications Inc.

How do I figure out the svn url? I think that right now it can't map to a domain so it's using the localhost. \nTo make it simple, what I want to do is write the svn url on another machine to access the data of the ubuntu server.\n\nA: First, Make sure everything's working locally:\n - Open a web browser on the system where you set up subversion\n - According to the tutorial provided, your svn-repository should be available under \"/svn\", so goto http://localhost/svn and check, if you can see the repository contents or the popup asking to provide username and password\n - If you get some error you probably have done something wrong in your svn installation. In this case, please check again your tutorial (BTW, there's also an ubuntu help page for subversion: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Subversion)\n\nSecond, if your can see your svn contents, you need to figure out the IP address that is given to your system:\n - Open up a terminal an run\nifconfig\n\n- Search for an entry beginning with \"eth\", e.g. eth0. If your computer has more than one network card, you might find more entries here. I'll come back to that later\n - Look for an entry called \"inet addr\" and take the numbers that are directly displayed after, e.g. something like 192.168.1.15. That's the IP address of your computer in your school's network.\n - That's already enough for a first try, so open a web browser on another computer and point it to http://[the ip address you just figured out]/svn\nFor the sample IP address I used above, this would be http://192.168.1.15/svn\n\nRemarks:\n - IP address may change, depending how your schools network is configured. So try to get the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your svn server. This should not change. (It's just the same as on the internet, e.g. instead of typing one of google's IP addresses, it's easier to type google.com). To find out your FQDN, type  \nnslookup the ip address you just figured out\non any computer of your schools network\n - Look for the entry \"name =\" at the bottom. That's your FQDN! Now enter that name instead of the IP address in your browser\n - If you have more than one network card in your computer, you may find more than one eth entry (e.g. eth0 and eth1). If you can find IP addresses behind the \"inet addr\" both entries, the easiest way would probably be to try all of them the way I described!\n - If you experiencing difficulties or problems when trying to get the IP address or the FQDN, or if you got your IP but you're not able to connect to the subversion server from another machine, it's also a good idea to talk to a system administrator at your school. I'm sure, they'll be able to help you with that!\n\nA: http://www.james-bennet.com/svn.htm\nI did this myself and documented it.\n", "Q: How can I enable international keyboards on 12.04?

I installed Komodo Edit from a download (wasn't available in Software Center.) I want to be able to open .php files in Komodo, but when I right-click and choose Open With Other Application, Komodo doesn't display anywhere in the list. How can I add it to the list?\n\n\nA: Only applications available in the Launcher/Dash show in the Other Applications list.\nKomodo Edit 7 creates an icon on your desktop by default:\n\nTo put Komodo Edit in the Launcher list and thus make it available in Other Applications, you must do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal with Ctrl-Alt-T\n\n*Type or paste:\nsudo cp ~/Desktop/komodo-edit-7.desktop /usr/share/applications/\n\nor for the newer version (Komodo Edit 8):\nsudo cp ~/Desktop/komodo-edit-8.desktop /usr/share/applications/\n\nNote that before this step, in order to run Komodo Edit 8 (whose file was named komodo-edit-8.desktop) by simply clicking on the Desktop icon, I was getting an \"Untrusted Application Launcher.\" I fixed this by making it executable by doing\nchmod +x ~/Desktop/komodo-edit-8.desktop\n\n\n*Exit the terminal.\n\n*Check that Komodo Edit shows up in the Dash (it may take a few moments):\n\n\n*Now, it should also show in the Other Applications list for php (and other) files:\n\n\nA: If you have /usr/share/applications/$application.desktop, change\nExec=$command\n\nto\nExec=$command %F\n\nin the file, where $application is the name of application, and $command is the command to execute for desired action.\nThen, you will be able to add the application to the list.\nIt may be necessary to change MimeType=applications/php etc., if it is not still displayed. (Run sudo update-desktop-database after changing that.) Although it may be needlessness for Komodo, it could be necessary for other applications.\n\nYou may use the sed program to do the replacement. Please arrange the portion of Exec=command according to your application.desktop file.\nsudo sed -i 's/Exec=command/Exec=command %F/' application.desktop\n\n\nA: Based on vine_user's method, but with a different approach. \nI normally download Blender from the official website, then use Alcarte / Main Menu software to create the menu link. After that, you will find the menu at \"/.local/share/applications\". \nNow, see which one of the .desktop files is yours (and make sure it's executable). Right Click on it, hit Properties. Then, in the Command field, right after the command stated there, add %U.\nThat's it! It should now show in your menu. \n\nA: In 14.04 you can directly set a program to appear in open with list.\nopen nautilus in root mode,\ngo to /usr/share/applications/ and select the application that you want to make appear on the list.\nright click and open properties\nat the command you will see like /usr/bin/appName at the end of that just add %U\nnow the whole thing must look like this /usr/bin/appName %U.\nnow you are done!\n\nA: One cool option to do this is  Alacart. It's fairly simple and easy to use. Heres the link\nBelow is the command to install it \n  sudo apt install alacarte\n\n\nA: You could simply append a blank space and %F to the Exec parameter in the application.desktop file of your installed application.  \nYou mentioned you didn't install from the software center so add a \"komodo.desktop\" file in /usr/share/applications/1 or ~/.local/share/applications/2, which would be very similar to the one I'm showing, just change the Name, Exec, Icon (etc) values to reflect your custom installation of komodo on your PC \nLike so:\n(using sublime as example because I don't use komodo)\n\nExplanation: the %F option activates the ability of passing arguments to your application, so if ubuntu can pass an argument it will activate the \"opening file with\" option on the context menus, and will pass the file as an argument3. Boom, that's all there is too it, not complicated at all.\n\nNotes:\n1: You will need root privileges to modify anything on this directory. (you could use sudo nano app.desktop from the \"terminal\" or open gedit with root privileges entering gksu gedit & , it will ask for your password of course)\n2: ~ stands for your user home directory (which really resides in /home/username/blabla...), and that the /.local/ directory is usually hidden, if you are using nautilus to \"explore\" your file system you can hit ctrl+h to show hidden files.\n3: If your application doesn't support passing arguments it wont work. \n\nA: Open Nautilus by the terminal with\nsudo nautilus\n\nthen, using Nautilus go to /usr/share/applications/ and look for the application you want to add to the \"Open With\" list. Copy the link on the desktop by copy-paste. Launch a text editor like Gedit ant drag the file you copied on the desktop in the text editor.\nOne of the last lines should be \nNoDisplay=false\n\nSo just replace \"false\" with \"true\" and save the file. Then drag the file you modified in /usr/share/applications/ and overwrite the old one.\nThen open again the \"Open with\" menu and you will see that application.\n\nA: In my case, when trying to add Sublime Text 3 to the list, the file ~/.local/share/applications/sublime_text.desktop had the property Hidden=True.\nErased that line, and problem solved!\n\nA: If you Don't find any flatpak apps in the open with listing, you can enable by modifying their desktop entries.

I am trying to uninstall Ubuntu by following these directions, but I have a question. Which partitions do I delete? I am assuming it is the three blank ones, but why would Ubuntu have three partitions? So I just wanted to make sure.\n\n\nA: Unless you have installed a third operating system, these are your Ubuntu partitions:\n\nRight-click to remove these partitions one-by-one, and then right-click the first (C:) to extend it across the unallocated space OR create a new partition in there.\nUse Windows' diskpart tool to get more info without booting a LiveCD\nYou can get some more information on the two 8 GB partitions from within Windows by using the diskpart command:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a command-prompt as administrator.\n\n*Type diskpart, you will get a prompt.\n\n*Type select disk 0, and then select part 3\n\n*Type detail part, and you should get something like this:\n\nPartition 3\nType  : 82\nHidden: Yes\nActive: No\nOffset in Bytes: 442499072000\n\nType 82 is swap, while type 83 is regular Linux (ext4, etc.). Do the same for the fourth partition, with select part 4. If either of those are NOT type 82/83, you should boot a LiveCD and investigate further with gParted as Eliah Kagan's answer recommends.\n\nA: You can boot into the Ubuntu system to see the contents of those partitions more clearly, to make sure they really belong to the Ubuntu system.\nThe 234.33 GB partition is likely your Ubuntu system's / partition that stores all the files therein.\nOne of the 7.99 GB partitions is likely your Ubuntu system's swap partition, used to swap pages of memory from RAM to disk to improve performance (and also used to facilitate hibernation).\nWhat's unclear is what the other 7.99 GB partition is for. Unless a second swap partition was created (to increase the amount of available swap), there's no particular reason to have two partitions of this exact size.\nSome Ubuntu systems have a separate /home partition, but it's likely you would remember configuring this (just as you'd probably remember reconfiguring your swap), and 8 gigabytes is rather small for a /home partition. (It's big enough, most of the time, but 8 gigabytes is also big enough for the / partition, yet that appears to be over 200 GB.)\nSo while you're probably safe deleting these partitions, it would be better for you to check just to be sure.\nWhether you boot into the installed Ubuntu system or from an Ubuntu live CD/DVD or live USB flash drive, open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run this command:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThat will usually reveal enough information to know what your partitions are being used for. If you edit your question to include the text from the Terminal (paste it in, select it, and use the <$> tool in the Ask Ubuntu editing toolbar to format it properly), then it should be possible to give a more definitive answer.\nDepending on what kinds of partitions these are, you may also be able to examine them yourself in Nautilus (Ubuntu's file manager). They may be visible under Devices, and you can mount them and look at what's in them. (You won't be able to do this with a swap partition, though, so you should not expect to see both of them under Devices.)\n\nA: Since this is a Windows partitioning tool, it doesn't really show enough information to be sure. (Linux partition editors know about many more types of partitions.) But I'd guess that the ones with a blank file system type are unknown to Windows and thus Linux partitions. So you could delete them. But I'd boot from the install CD and run GParted first, just to be sure.\n\nA: Ubuntu only uses one extended partition - do you know how much space you allocated to your Ubuntu partiton when you first dual-booted?\n", "Q: Should I upgrade to the \"mainline\" kernels? Newer \"mainline\" versions of the kernel are available from the Ubuntu kernel team, e.g. 3.4 and 3.5, while Ubuntu 12.04 is on 3.2.\n\n\n*\n\n*What are the mainline kernels?\n\n*Are they better than my existing kernel?\n\n*What are the pros and cons of upgrading to a mainline kernel?\n\n*Will I easily be able to go back?\n\n\nA: Upgrading to a mainline kernel is usually not a good idea\n\nMost of the basic information in this answer is from the Mainline Builds wiki\n\n1. They are provided only for testing and are unsupported\n\n*\n\n*The mainline kernels are built from the latest unmodified \"mainline\" Linux kernel sources.\n\n*The Ubuntu kernel team provides these only for testing and debugging purposes, to see whether issues have been fixed \"upstream\", i.e. by the Linux kernel developers.\n\n*They are therefore not supported and must be used at your own risk; you can report possible bugs to kernel.org via kernel-oops, or if you want a faster solution, try posting to the Linux Kernel Mailing List\n2. They will often break drivers, especially Nvidia/AMD and wireless (Broadcom)\n\n*\n\n*The mainline kernels do not include any Ubuntu-provided drivers or patches\n\n*This means no binary drivers for graphics, wireless, etc. are provided\n\n*If you try installing binary drivers downloaded directly from the manufacturers, there is a very good chance they will not work because the mainline headers may be incompatible.\n\n*\n\n*This will be especially true for non-LTS versions after 12.04 (12.10, 13.04, ...), because the mainline kernels are built using the last LTS toolchain (compilers, etc.), which is generally older than the toolchain on the latest non-LTS release.\n\n\n\n3. You should only install these if you believe they may fix a critical problem you are having with the current kernel\n\n*\n\n*Newer kernels sometimes contain fixes for a hardware or filesystem problem you may have. For example, the internal HD4000 graphics on the latest Intel Ivy Bridge CPUs occasionally froze, a bug which was fixed in kernels 3.3.6 and newer.\n\n*You can try installing a mainline kernel in these circumstances, and see if it helps your problem.\n\n*If it does, you should consider upgrading to the latest Ubuntu+1 kernel instead, which does have binary drivers available for it.\n\n4. If you install a mainline or other newer kernel, you can still choose to use your old (stable) kernel by selecting it at boot-time:\n\n*\n\n*Keep Shift pressed after turning on your computer.\n\n\n*You will see the Grub menu as shown below. User the down arrow to go to \"Previous Linux Versions\" and press Enter\n\n\n\n*Select the option which has a version of x.x.x-generic, NOT one that has x.x.x-yyyyyy-generic and press Enter. This is usually the first option unless you have installed multiple mainline/custom kernels.\n\n\nA: If you know of a specific fix or improvement in how the newer kernel handles your hardware, I say go for it.\nI would not have upgraded to a mainline kernel due to lack of support, except that I was having some trouble with N64 game emulation running very sluggishly with lots of bugs. After trying every configuration I could find for the emulator as well as xorg, I read Here's Why Radeon Graphics Are Faster On Linux 3.12. This was enough to motivate me to test it and the results in appearance and performance were amazing with no new problems arising as of yet.\nOne thing to note is whether you have external modules (aka out-of-tree) installed (see Indentify out of tree modules to get an idea where these are). If you need these modules, consider whether they will build against the new kernel version. Do some research and test them yourself on the new kernel version. Worse case scenario, you can boot into the previous kernel version and uninstall the new one.\nIt is recommended to remove external or proprietary modules before attempting to upgrade to the mainline kernel. I did have to remove virtualbox to avoid the \"Error! Bad return status for module build\" during the kernel install. \n\nA: Instead of mainline, you should consider LTS enablement stack\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack\nWhere, a newer kernel / graphics stack is backported officially, only for LTS Ubuntu releases.\nIn this case, Precise 12.04.5 has Trusty's kernel (3.13)\n\nA: Absolutely not, except for testing purposes. Just yesterday (2021-09-15) I have installed the 5.14.4 kernel (system: Ubuntu 20.04) and I have encountered the following really strange behaviour: in my PHP codes the set_time_limit(0) call resulted in max_execution_time set to 0 seconds!\nThis is just one bug I have meet, but I am sure that there are much more.\nSumma summarum, I do not recommend installing mainline kernels.\n", "Q: I get an authentication failed message when I try to remove or install software Whenever I try to install or remove software I end up getting an authentication failed message.

I am trying to install a dual-boot system with 12.04. However, when I run the LiveCD I only get as far as the \"Install\" window where you can select the partitions for your drives. On the bottom where it says \"device for boot loader installation\" I have \"/dev/sda\" and cannot select any other devices.\nAll the options to change the drives are greyed out, most likely because there are no drives in the window. I partitioned my largest drive using the tools within Windows, then booted into the CD, but nothing shows up. I then used Gparted to change the new space from unallocated to an /ext2, and still nothing shows up.\nThe installer does not recognize anything, but when I go into an Ubuntu session and use the disk utility manager I can see the partitions I made. Anything I do has to be done outside of the installer.\nI have no files on this new computer, so this is the perfect time to install a parallel OS. I would like avoid completely reinstalling Windows, however. I've been over the forums many times, but all the answers I've found have not worked for me. I also tried flagging the new, empty partition as boot, but that screwed Windows up.\nAlso, the WUBI installer hits the same point and quits. I know that the disk itself is fine because I just made another dual boot system on a Gateway PC. This makes me think something within this computer is preventing the installer from \"seeing\" the drives. Any help would be much appreciated!\nEdit in response: The main part of the partitioning window shows no partitions, everything is blank. There is no way to add partitions, and all the buttons are useless. I've tried defragging my drive multiple times, and I also used the same disk to dual-boot another PC with no problems, so it's not the disk, it's definitely the computer. \n\nA: When the installer gives you the selection to install grub to /dev/sda only, that's normal. You see, in Linux, partitions and disks are represented this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disks are represented as an entry in /dev with no number at the end. sdas are SATA disks, hdas are PATA disks (CD drives are usually cdrom, cd, cdrw. Same for DVDs). \n\n*Partitions, however, are represented as the device they are on (the above point) followed by a number. So, while /dev/sda is your disk, /dev/sda1 is a partition on that disk.\n\n\nThe boot loader doesn't install to a partition -- it installs to a disk. That's why the install is asking whether you want to install on /dev/sda, which is a disk.\n\nA: I was having an identical problem also on an HP Pavilion machine. I booted Ubuntu from CD and wanted to move to a permanent installation (not trying to create a dual boot machine, actually, a pure Linux box). I created all of the partitions with GParted but the installation tool didn't see them. Interesting bit is that fdisk -l did not see the partitions either. \nThe fix was to run sudo dmraid -rE . Once that was done, the installation tool saw the hard disk.\nIn my case (Arthur Borsboom) this fix removes something related to Nvidia RAID (nvraid), which I have been using in the past for Windows.\n\nA: Go through this link Ubuntu 12.10 installer does not detect drive partitions\nHope it may help...\n\nA: I went into Rescue mode and dropped to a shell inside the installer.\nThen ran the sudo dmraid -rE command as mentioned above because the system I'm using also has the nVidia Raid card.\nOnce that was done, the installer saw the drive just fine.\nThanks.\n", "Q: Empathy fails to reconnect after awake from suspend Problem: Whenever I suspend in 12.04 and awake my laptop, Empathy doesn't automatically reconnect and I always have to manually log off and log back in again.

What coule be the problem here?\n\nA: gedit is a graphical program, so just as you would not run it as root with straight sudo, you shouldn't run it as another user with straight sudo or straight su.\nInstead, if you (i.e., foo) have the power to run programs as another user with sudo, this is probably the easiest way for footo run gedit as bar:\nxhost +local:bar\ngksu -u bar gedit\n\nIf you don't have the power to run programs as another user with sudo but you can su to bar, then this is the easiest way:\ngksu -w -u bar gedit\n\nThe -w flag (equivalent to --su-mode) makes gksu (which is a frontend for both sudo and su) use su instead of sudo.\n\n\n*\n\n*You shouldn't need to run any corresponding xhost command to make gksu -w ... work.\n\n\nIf you want a graphical terminal instance (gnome-terminal) from which you can run anything as bar including graphical applications, you should consider just running a new instance of gnome-terminal as bar (which you can do the same way as running gedit, detailed above).\n\nA: you ca do this by\nssh -l Other-User -X localhost gedit\nthere is an new window run on your desktop, but with environment of \"Other-User\"!\nI have tested this with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS on my box!\n\nA: The syntax you provide doesn't look right.  If you want to switch to user 'bar', then I believe you should use \"su bar\".  But if that's not right, I would think you would get an error at the time you try to switch users.  Maybe it's a typo in your question or su takes it anyway.\nI think it's more likely that the problem is gedit is a gui-based editor and so is trying to launch in that user's x session, which wouldn't exist if you change changed users via the terminal.  What happens if you use \"vi file_to_edit\"?  Vi is a terminal-based editor and shouldn't be affected by gui difficulties.\n\nedit:\nI need to get some computer glasses, I thought the command you put was \"su -bar\".

I'm using Kdenlive to edit some video I recorded. I have some \"uh\"s, \"um\"s, and dead air I want to delete quickly. For every little bit I need to remove, I'm having to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select track\n\n*Set end cutting point\n\n*Cut clip (Shift+R)\n\n*Set start cutting point\n\n*Cut clip (shift+R)\n\n*Select portion to delete\n\n*Press delete\n\n*Right-click in empty area\n\n*Click \"remove space\"\n\n\nThis is a real pain. :-( I'm used to Cinelerra, where you just click-drag a selection, then press delete. Unfortunately, the codecs in Cinelerra are sorely out of date. How can I speed this process up in Kdenlive?\n\nA: In the new Kdenlive you can set a zone region with i and o keys and then press Shift+x to delete the region on all tracks. Unfortunately at the moment Kdenlive Version 18.04.1 you can not exclude tracks from this operation.\n\nA: Despite requests of many users, there is no such function for just selecting a part and removing it out of the audio/video track. \nBut I think that you just could look where to cut, then cut two times, click on the middle part and then click Del. And that is everything. \nI think that this cutting process shouldn't take too long.\n\nA: You could use a custom shortcut for \"Extract clip\" which deletes and removes the gap. If you don't want to use the mouse at all you can use the following shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*SHIFT+C to cut the section you want to delete (I added a custom shortcut \"c\" for this)\n\n*ALT+LEFT/RIGHT to go to the beginning of the clip you want to delete\n\n*Press \"+\" to select the clip to delete\n\n*Use a custom shortcut for \"Extract clip\". I use the custom shortcut CTRL+Del for this. This combines deletion of the clip and removing the space.\n\n\nA: 1. How to quickly mark a segment to delete:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the video track is selected.\n\n*Press X to switch to the Cut (Razor) Tool\n\n*Click once in the timeline at the start point\n\n*Click once at the end point\n\n*Press S again to switch back to selection mode\n\n2. Use xdotool to automate delete/remove space with a single keyboard shortcut\n\n\n*\n\n*xdotool allows automation of keyboard and mouse clicks/movements; install it with sudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n*Copy and paste the below to an sh file, say kdenlive_cut.sh in your home directory:\n\n#!/bin/bash\nDELAY=0.5  # delay in seconds between each action\nxdotool search --limit 1 -name Kdenlive > nul  # activate only if kdenlive running\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]\nthen xdotool click 1 && sleep $DELAY \\       # left-click\n   && xdotool key Delete && sleep $DELAY \\  # DEL\n   && xdotool click 3 && sleep $DELAY \\     # right-click\n   && xdotool key r;                        # 'R' to remove space\nfi\n\nMake it executable with chmod +x ~/kdenlive_cut.sh\n\n*Open Settings...Keyboard, and go to the Shortcuts tab. Create a custom shortcut, naming it whatever you want, and setting the \"Command\" path to /home/username/kdenlive_cut.sh. Click Apply. The right-column will say \"Disable\", click on it and you'll see \"New Accelerator\": press your shortcut key combo. I chose Ctrl+Del since it doesn't conflict with the existing shortcuts in Kdenlive.\n\n\n*Now go to Kdenlive, and mark a segment you want to cut (as explained in Section 1). Click on that segment to outline it in red, and without moving the cursor, press Ctrl+Del; you will see the segment deleted, an empty space appear, the right-click menu show and the space removed -- all in the space of about 2 seconds.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes the shortcut fails the very first time it's invoked, giving you the longer right-click menu or the \"Insert Space\" option. Just cancel, and try it again...it works.\n\n*Here's a Youtube Demo of the shortcut in action. \n", "Q: How can one disable shortcuts of chrome? Have you observed that google-chrome has approximately 29 shortcuts. ( Ctrl+A...Z ) I really hate these things. Anyway, my questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I disable some of the shortcuts ?\n\n*Are there any files where all settings are stored? If there are, where are those files in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\n\nA: Manhandle shortcuts in Chrome browser, a guide for the perplexed:\nTLDR: your solution is in phase 3 of 4 below, install that Chrome plugin.\nIt's infuriating to have to deal with Chrome's constantly changing keystroke ideologies that continue to randomize every 3 to 9 months.  So understanding the four different areas you can put middle-men in the keyboard-to-browser command chain helps you find a solution that works for you, and never changes, for all time, even as you change operating systems, keyboards, and programs.\nIf you're here, you're having trouble making Chrome behave the way you want. Take a minute and understand the four remapping areas between your computer keyboard's emitted keys, and the client side webpage rendered by the Chrome browser, with 3rd party corporations fighting to change your keys to what they want them to be.\nMac, Windows and Linux are different in their own ways, but they share a common ancestor, and are all the same in way I describe.  If you mess around with this process, you have to be careful and take ownership of this assembly line, or else it's easy to leave keys orphaned, cause duplicated actions, even causing multiple actions from one keystroke, key-feedback loops are a pain.  \nKey remapping area 1 of 4, ( Keyboard KeyCode --> Operating System )\nOnly Mac and Linux can experiment here.  There are programs such as .inputrc and other config files that intercept keys from the keyboard even before the operating system has a chance to hear them.  I generally leave this alone since for the most part my keyboard is a faithful transmitter of keys and my operating system is a faithful hearer of keys.  You can remap keys here, and change what your operating system hears, thus leaving the Chrome browser powerless to countermand you.\nKey remapping area 2 of 4, (Operating System --> Chromium Application )\nThe Chrome Browser is just a computer program running on your operating system. \n The OS quarantines the browser window and Chrome only receives those KeyCodes transmitted to it by the operating system.  Mac, Windows and Linux all have their own Key-remapping programs, For example Mac's Spectacle and Karabener, or Windows StickyKeys, or Linux's low level internals like .inputrc and config files. \nMessing around here involves installing the program for your OS and intercepts the OS keycodes and changes what keys are heard by which application.  This remapping area also leaves the meddlesome Chrome developers powerless to countermand you, because they are quarantined to the application space.  Install your program and tell it to Remap Ctrl-K to Ctrl-Shift-carpal-tunnel-p and you're off to the races.  If you do this, you also need to take heed that remapping area 3-of-4 and 4-of-4 also propagate the key correctly.  \nKey remapping area 3 of 4, ( Chrome application --> All Rendered Webpages)\nThis is where your problem is.  Those plucky Google-Chrome developers sitting in their crystal fortress constantly change up these keys every 3 to 9 months, because of users yelling at them.  This is where everyone can use the Chrome Plugin, regardless of OS: Mac, Windows, Linux.  Install the Chrome plugin: Shortkeys (Custom Keyboard Shortcuts) by: Mike Crittenden. This plugin has two areas that let you remap keys in areas 3-of-4 and areas 4-of-4.  Read the manual and you can unmap and remap all commands here.\nKey remapping area 4 of 4, ( Chrome's V8 Interpreter engine < -- > javascript/jquery/Flash/etc)\nThis area is where even more problems happen.  Those plucky individual and corporate developers all over the world program serverside and client side javascript to instruct Chrome to re-remap your key to what they want it to be.  So assuming you correctly transmit your key from areas 1 through 3, Area 4 here countermands you at the last mile. \nThe ShortKeys plugin has an area for this space as well but you have to make sure area 3 is right.  For me just the one chrome plugin does everything I need to counter-mand both the Chrome developers and webpage developers, but it's not perfect.  You'll load up a flash app, and suddenly Flash is painting Unicode piles-of-poo and unicorns on the screen rather than scrolling down, as you instructed.\nExtra notes:\nIf you set a remap a key in one area, but not the others, you're left with either a non-remapped key, because one area overrides another, or left with just the existing one, or a mysterious no-operation, or worse, a duplicated operation and feedback loop resulting in a stuck or spamming key.  \nAsserting your instructions through this entire stack is a challenge.  But taking ownership has long term rewards because as you can see, all computer manufacturers, especially Mac, are taking away your keys one by one, and replacing them with \"Apple-buy it now!\" buttons, and fart buttons on laugh tracks when you press escape, which self-remaps to \"Apple-buy-it-now\".\n\nA: This is an awful kludge:\nWebsites' Javascript can intercept most browser shortcuts. This is normally used to implement keyboard shortcuts in web apps (so e.g. Ctrl-S saves the document open in a web app instead of opening the browser's save page dialog). However, if you handle the event by ignoring it, it effectively disables the browser's shortcut.\nTo do this, create a script that traps all browser shortcuts and discards them. Save it as a Greasemonkey user script (name it something.user.js) and set it to execute on all pages. You can use Chromium's built-in Greasemonkey support, or use any of various extensions if you prefer a different interface. The end result is that whenever you're on any web page (i.e. always), the script will have executed, causing most browser shortcuts to be trapped and discarded before the browser processes them.\nOf course, you can write your script to not trap a particular shortcut that you actually use.\nNote that there are a few shortcuts (generally related to navigating between tabs) that by design web pages are not allowed to trap. Those will therefore not be disabled.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to chrome://extensions\n\n*In the very bottom right, click keyboard shortcuts\n\n\n*Rebind Ctrl + Shift + Q to something less annoying. In my case I bound it to open lastpass extension.\n\n\nA: Apparently in chrome , google has not addressed the Disabling Keyboard Shortcuts Feature yet . \nSuch applications specific shortcuts are stored by the application, i guess such Shortcut config File doesn't exist in Ubuntu.\nThere are extensions like Hotkey and shortcut manager which provides User Defined shortcuts though. \nEven HUD seems to have limited features in Chrome.\nThrough shortcut manager , you can disable all the Ctrl shortcuts individually  as here. \n\nFor further reference visit\nChange/Disable Chrome Keyboard shortcuts\nDisable shortcuts in Google Chrome \n\nA: I had this issue too.\nI fixed it by going into the Keyboard Shortcuts menu (Tools -> Extensions -> Keyboard Shortcuts (scroll to bottom)), selecting each Shortcut box, and trying to press (on Mac) Command + Shift + Alt + 5 + 6 + 7 + H + F5 .....

This should work on any other OS too.\nTry using a bunch of modifier keys and smacking the keyboard with your hand (or head!) until it says \"Not set\".\n\nA: The most annoying shortcut for me is Ctrl+Alt+O, which is IntelliJ's optimize imports shortcut. Chrome hijacks that to open its stk window.\nTo disable that, open the configuration menu and uncheck Hot Keys:\n\n", "Q: Vmware installation on ubuntu 10.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nVMware Player 4.0.3. on Ubuntu 12.04 32 Bit \n\nI installed VMware 8.04 on Ubuntu 10.04.

I've gone through a few hours of dealing with boot managers that wouldn't install properly and accidentally temporarily \"breaking\" my machine, I can live with negligible performance decrease and the lack of a hibernate function.\nAnyways, I'm debating whether or not I should opt for the Wubi installation or the VMWare installation. Specifically, here's the factors that should influence my decision\n1) I'll be using it for lightweight computing, word processing, graphs, logs, data collection, maybe some programming, etc. (I'm a college student). So while I don't need my full graphics potential or anything, I'd like to have an installation that works as fast and efficient as possible, without hangups/stutters/etc.\n2) I have a laptop with NVIDIA Optimus (switchable graphics). These graphics work properly through Windows, and semi-properly through Wubi Ubuntu with the Bumblebee utility. If Optimus works a-ok in Windows, will it work just as well in a Virtual Machine hosted by Windows? Or will I have to find a way to get Bumblebee working with the VM installation?\n3) I have 6GB of RAM, which is a good quantity and can nullify the memory deficiency that having Windows 7 and Ubuntu running at once could cause. However, I want to use absolutely no swap space if possible. In addition, will having Windows 7 running in the background affect my CPU's processing power vs. Wubi?\n4) I heard somewhere that 3D graphics can be iffy with VMware. I'd like to have a 3D desktop environment with effects included. Will this be as possible with VMware as it is with Wubi?\n5) Is running Ubuntu in a VM going to make my computer more vulnerable as opposed to a dual-boot through Wubi? I like Ubuntu's tight security, and I'm not sure if running it within Windows' less tight environment would affect it.\nIn general, I want something that works without a hitch, and runs and looks sleek. While I'd love the ability to switch between 7 and Ubuntu with the press of a button so I could do more Windows-specific things such as MS Office and gaming, the whole idea of running a whole operating system inside of another operating system seems questionable. If the security and performance cost of running it in a VM is too high, then I'll stick with Wubi, but I really do like the idea.\naddition - Can't believe I forgot this. I'm running a laptop in a university setting, so battery life is going to be a huge deal for me. I imagine that the virtual machine will require more power to run, but will this be a noticeable and significant difference?\n\nA: I suggest VMWare, especially given your dual-graphics system.\n1) With 6GB RAM, give 1-1.5 to the Ubuntu VM and it will be sufficient - no swap necessary.\n2) The VM uses Windows graphics drivers and doesn't care about the actual graphics card. No Bumblebee needed. If you want full dual-graphics advantage go with the VM.\n3) Install Ubuntu 32-bit, and 1-1.5GB of memory should be enough to do most things without swap. The total CPU power is shared between Windows and the VM, obviously; just having Windows 7 in the background will not affect your VMWAre experience, but if you are doing something heavy in Windows 7 the proportion of CPU power available to the VM will decrease correspondingly.\n4) Enable 3D-acceleration in that VM's settings in VMWare and you should be good to go.\n5) A virtual machine is separated from the host, so Windows vulnerabilities won't affect Ubuntu. However if you enable shared folders you should make sure you have a good updated antivirus running on Windows.\n\nA: Sorry to have to say that but you need to refine your need's preferences as\n\n\n*\n\n*there is no way to switch between 2 OS running in parallel other than trough a virtual machine.\n\n*there is no way to get a half decent 3D desktop with effects working smoothly in a virtual machine.\n\n*there is no way to keep Windows malware 100% out of your system as long as you run Windows. In a Wubi or VM installation this malware may also affect (but not infect) your Ubuntu installation.\nFrom what we can guess from applications you like to run you may well be happy with Ubuntu running in a virtual machine, but don't expect that Compiz with a lot of effects or other heavily 3D GPU demanding applications will perform well.\nYour idea to make use of your Optimus graphics from Window is a good one. The virtual machine will offer its own graphical adapter emulation using the GPU provided from Windows drivers. In addition power management features will also be controlled by Windows drivers.\nOnce you hopefully feel comfortable with Ubuntu you may find ot that you use Ubuntu more than Windows. This will then also be the time to decide whether we want to set a dual boot system up, or we may want to install Windows in a VM running on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Quickly creates wrong debian/copyright file \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I upload an updated package to my PPA without having Quickly mess it up? \n\nI have some problem with quickly submitubuntu command.\nThe reviewer of my application send me a feedback asking to change the copyright file because it was in a wrong format and with errors... it is \"protoborsa\" application https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/1152/feedback/\nI edited the file debian/copyright and I did \"quickly submitubuntu\" again.. but I thinks, quickly trashed my changes and create a new wrong copyright file.\nThis is the file http://paste.ubuntu.com/1087559/\n\n(the duplicate line, for example that property close tag comes from .UI glade files... from an aboutdialog)\nis it possible to force quickly to don't touch the copyright file?\nOr..

I'm running a fairly clean install of 12.04. I haven't really installed much software, only VMware tools as I'm running it on a Windows host using VMware workstation.\nI am trying to enable automatic login just to save some time more than anything else.\nIf I go to System Settings > User Accounts I can see my user account in the list but no option to enable automatic login. Even if I unlock it still does not show it.\n\nIf I create a new user account the auto login option is displayed for that user account only. If I assign a password then I can enable the auto login option. As well as a 'Standard' user I also tried creating an 'Administrator' account to see if it would work and it does.\n\nAny thoughts anyone?\nedit:\nAs a quick test I decided to see if creating a new Administrator account and logging into it would make the auto-login available for my admin account. It does, so I tried unlocking and switching auto-login on.\nHowever when I rebooted it did not auto-login, and just went to the login screen as normal.\nIs it a security feature of Ubuntu or something to not allow auto-login for Administrator accounts because of the security risks?\nedit2:\nIf I create a new Administrator account, assign a password and enable auto-login it works as intended. Something else I noticed is that when it carried out the auto-login for the new account it automatically executed /usr/bin/vmware-user which enables VMware tools features like auto-resizing of desktop etc.\nThis does not get executed automatically when I log in to my original account (I have just always worked around that seemingly separate issue by adding it as a Startup Application). I would guess this means that the real issue is something to do with my user account rather than a problem with lightdm.\nedit3:\nI have now fixed this. Apparently I have to wait for another 4 hours before I'm allowed to answer my own question because I'm a new user....answer will be posted then.\n\nA: Found the cause of this one. I fired up a new blank VM with a view to installing Ubuntu on it and seeing if the issue persisted in a fresh installation.\nDuring the installation process, on the \"Who are you?\" screen you get the option to \"Log in automatically\". You also get the option to \"Encrypt my home folder\".\nI have encryption enabled on the original VM. It appears that you cannot use automatic login if you are using home folder encryption. (The installer will not let you select them both together, it automatically deselects the auto login if you select encryption and vice versa).\nI found this post about deactivating home folder encryption. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1134121\nFrom my original account, I did the following:\n\n*\n\n*I opened a terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T).\n\n\n*I issued sudo su to become root.\n\n\n*I issued cp -rp /home/user /home/user.backup to take an unencrypted copy of the home directory (replacing user with my actual username).\nwhile doing the copy i received the error message:\n cp: cannot stat /home/tom/.gvfs': Permission denied\n\nI just ignored it.

You can try: telnet portquiz.positon.org 22 to test that.\nWhat error do you get? ssh timeout? If it is a timeout this is probably a firewall issue.\nYou can also check /var/log/auth.log on your ssh server.\nTest a telnet yourserverpublicip 22 from outside, and check the output of netstat -anp or tcpdump -ni any port 22\nOne more idea: some local NAT firewalls do not support NAT loopback so that the connection from outside on your public ip will work, but not from inside your NATed network.\n", "Q: Are libc versions tied to kernel versions? After reading the answers to my previous question  I have come to the conclusion that an answer to the following question is what I was actually looking for:\nDoes a particular version of the kernel require a particular version of libc to run properly? \nBasically my problem stems from building an application on my 12.04 ubuntu and trying to run it on 8.04. I have since learned from this and other stackexchange forums that it is backward compatibility of libc that causes these problems. Therefore what I am perhaps naively trying to do is build the same version of libc that exists on my target and then link against that on my host when I build the application. Then in an ideal world when I copy this to the host, having been linked to the \"correct\" libc it should work (in my head at least). I have been totally unable to find a way to install an older libc on my system, and wondered if each version is tightly bound to a kernel version, hence the above question. \n\nA: They are tied to each other, in a way.\n\n\n*\n\n*The kernel you're running on was compiled with a specific libc.\n\n*The libc you have was compiled to only support kernels above a specific version.\n\n\nSo if you are installing the kernel packages and libc packages from the Ubuntu repos, as opposed to compiling them yourself, you're stuck with the above dilemma.\nAs far as libc goes, one way to do what you propose is to compile the 12.04 kernel from source on 8.04, thus linking it against the 8.04 libc. Then you use that custom kernel to boot 12.04, upon which you compile the libc version that's on 8.04, also from source. You install that, and your applications should share the same old 8.04 libc.\nI assume you are also aware that any other 12.04 libraries your application is linked against may not be available in 8.04, so you will have to compile them from source too...\nTo sum up, it's best to just compile on 8.04.\n\nA: \nDoes a particular version of the kernel require a particular version of libc to run properly?\n\nYes, unless you build the kernel yourself from source with your preferred libc version. The Ubuntu kernels are built on the LTS release prior to the target release, so the \"latest\" Ubuntu kernels compatible with 8.04 libc were those for Ubuntu 9.10.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 boots up into terminal (Lightdm & Ati Video card) I just returned from a two-week vacation and started up my laptop, everything went fine and it installed a lot of updates (including a kernel update. sorry for few details, I didn't really pay attention to what it did update).\nThe next time I tried to start up the machine, it wouldn't. Among the last messages there was e4rat, and when the automatic package repair (in ubuntu-repair-mode or whatever it's called in English - fortunately, that works) wanted to replace it with ureadahead, I figured there'd be some kind of incompatibility with the newest kernel.\nSo I removed it myself (as the automatic repair wasn't able to. Did it using sudo apt-get install ureadahead ubuntu-minimal , which worked fine), and manually removed the e4rat-preload-line in grub.\nProblem is: It won't show the login-screen but instead it switches to tty1, prompting me to log in.

only when I switch back to \"Digital Output\" or if I use alsamixer and dim \"PCM\".\nWhen I choose \"Digital Output\" in Audio Settings and start alsamixer, changing the \"Master\" volume doesn't have any impact. \"S/PDIF\" and \"S/PDIF D\" are shown there, too, but both are set to \"00\" and I can't modify them ...\nWhen I adjust the volume to a normal level (i.e. 40%) and run sudo alsactl store and reboot, the volume icon in the panel doesn't show 100%, but the sound comes with 100% - until I scroll down above the icon: Then it jumps immediately to 39%.\n\nA: I've got the same problem. Analog is saved/restored but SPDIF is always the full blow after startup. I'm not particularly fond of a workaround of setting the volume to zero or low at login as I'm mostly annoyed by the startup sound at the login screen, blowing out my windows. I haven't really found the solution, but things got better. This is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I thought maybe the problem originates from the fact the analog output is device 0 of card 0, while digital is device 1 (of card 0). (XiFi chip or something) and store/restore procedure only stores the first. However alsactl store/restore (re)stores the 'complete' state with all the volume levels.\n\n*I concluded its alsa not saving/restoring the state of the spdif output (card:0, device:1) as 'alsactl store' / '... restore' has no effect on the spdif channel. It remains where its at.\n\n*running 'alsactl store' after selecting SPDIF in the sound control panel gives me a different /var/lib/alsa/asouns.state file. Not sure what this leads to but maybe alsa sees different volume controls depending on which output is selected in the control panel?\n\n*alsactl -f /var/lib/alsa/asound.state store seems to work (gives me a new asouns.state)\n\n*alsactl -f /var/lib/alsa/asound.state restore gives me: \"alsactl: set_control:1464: Cannot write control '2:0:0:IEC958 Playback Default:0' : Operation not permitted\"\n\n*I figured out IEC958 is the is indeed the digital output.\n\n*Stopped my music player: Error dissapeared\n\n*installed pavucontrol, selected default output\n\n*removed /var/lib/alsa/asound.state\n\n*reboot\n\n*volume slider is now restored on a restart, actual volume is not it seems\n\n\nMaybe it helps someone.. at least remove your asound.state and see if it helps.\n\nA: I don't know of any way to do this \"properly\", but you might be able to add a startup script to do the job. Using the program \"amixer\", I can produce output that lists the settings of the sound outputs between 0 and 64, including the \"Master\" channel. Right before shutting down, this could be parsed (using regex perhaps?) to store the volume in a file. When the system is booted again, the command \"amixer set CHANNEL VALUE\" could be issued to set the volume to the stored value.\nBy adding this to a shell script (typically a startup job in /etc/init.d) you could have it done automatically, which should make it appear seamless. I've used these startup scripts before to do other things, and I see no reason at all why it couldn't solve your problem as well.\nDetails:\nThe first step would be to create a shell script that is capable of changing the volume. At present I do not have the time nor all the detailed knowledge to write it for you, but if you know a bit about scripting, or if you can find a good tutorial, it shouldn't be that hard. I will be glad to help out if you have problems. Below is a template that you can use.\n#! /bin/sh\n\nstart(){\n    # This function is called on startup\n    # This is where you will need to read the volume from a file and call amixer\n}\n\nstop(){\n    # This function is called on shutdown\n    # This is where amixer is called and the volume is saved to file\n}\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    start)\n        start\n        ;;\n    stop)\n        stop\n        ;;\n    *)\n        echo \"Usage: avolumesaver {start|stop}\"\n        exit 1\nesac\n\nexit 0\n\nBasically the start function is called whenever the system is started, and the stop function is called before shutting down. You can do whatever you need inside those functions. You should open an editor as root (\"sudo gedit\" at the terminal) and then save the file as \"/etc/init.d/avolumesaver\". After doing so, you will need to issue the following commands:\nchmod a+x /etc/init.d/avolumesaver\nupdate-rc.d avolumesaver defaults\n\nThe first line will make the script executable. The second line converts it into an upstart job. Technically, this simply means that some symbolic links are created, but it is a good idea to use update-rc.d and not try to add the links yourself.\nAfter doing this, you can edit /etc/init.d/avolumesaver until you have achieved what you want. You can test the functionality without actually rebooting by issuing the following command (after making it an upstart job):\nservice avolumesaver start\nservice avolumesaver stop\n\n\nA: I've asked similiar question here. Maybe it could help.\nIt sets volume level to a particular value after every login. It works with PulseAudio and digital output.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy default pulse config file to your home location: \ncp /etc/pulse/default.pa ~/.pulse\n\n*In your config file locate the following line: \nload-module module-always-sink\nImmediately after the above line, add the following line: \nset-sink-volume 0 {your-volume-level-here} \nVolume level is a number in a range 0..65535. For example: \nset-sink-volume 0 32768\n\nA: I'm hoping this will help someone out.. I've always had this issue and i just fixed it on ubuntu 13:10 (Pear Os 8). inside the /etc/pulse/default.pa file there is a line to select alsa sink..that is the key for me.This is what i had to change mine to to make it save volumes... \n### Load audio drivers statically\n### (it's probably better to not load these drivers manually, but instead\n### use module-udev-detect -- see below -- for doing this automatically)\nload-module module-alsa-sink\nload-module module-alsa-sink device=hw:0,1\n#load-module module-oss device=\"/dev/dsp\" sink_name=output source_name=input\n#load-module module-oss-mmap device=\"/dev/dsp\" sink_name=output source_name=input\n#load-module module-null-sink\n#load-module module-pipe-sink\n\nNow on the line load-module module-alsa-sink device=hw:0,1\nyou may have to change your PCM location using aplay -l examples here https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Examples\nyour numbers will be hw:X(card number),X(Device Number)\nI hope others read this and get their sound working as this has been a huge pain for me for years.\n", "Q: How to make Nautilus remember the windows position? I can't see any tweak about this in dconf or compiz. Can someone explain is there any way to make Nautilus remember its position before the closing?\nUbuntu 12.04\n\nA: One solution to this problem is using the software gnome-tweak-tool. Here is how step by step: (WARNING! read at the bottom of this message first: there will be some bugs if you follow the steps but it is fully and easily reversible)\n1) if you do not have installed gnome-tweak-tool you can find it in Ubuntu Software Center. In the search area type \"advanced settings\" and install the first matching result.\nClose Ubuntu Software Center.\n2) This app will appear in Unity with the name \"Advanced Settings\", if not, search it with dash with this name.\n3) Launch this app and go to \"Desktop\" and change \"Have file manager handle the desktop\" from OFF to ON. That's it! Close the app and now Nautilus will remember the last size and position.\nWARNING! There are some side effects to this action, but it is fully reversibile if you put \"Have file manager handle the desktop\" from ON to OFF. Some bugs that I have noticed after the modification: slow unity, slow firefox and others.\n\nA: My solution might not help with remembering the last position exactly, depending on where the shortcut is on your desktop (if you are opening a shortcut from the desktop, that is)...\nIn Compiz, choose Window Management and then Place Windows (making sure it is enabled first). \nUnder the General tab in Placement Mode, choose Pointer. This will ensure it opens the window wherever the shortcut resides on your desktop, so this is the best solution.\n\nA: I cannot give you a \"perfect\" answer to this issue but I've been trying to solve and I've made some progress that you may try as partial workaround.\nsudo gconf-editor\n\nAdd a new \"String\" key inside /apps/nautilus/preferences called navigation_window_saved_geometry and specify a size and position e.g. 879x620+483+352\nClose the configuration editor and launch Nautilus. If it doesn't appear with the size and position you specified try to launch it from a terminal window it should work.\nThe problem is that if you change the position and size and close Nautilus it will not keep this properties. It will keep on open in whatever position and size you specified with the Configuration editor. \nSo, it doesn't fully work (at least not for me); it is just a partial workaround.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall ffmpeg?

The touchpad is recognized as a PS/2 mouse, which means that I can't use scrolling and that there is no \"Touchpad\" tab in the mouse settings.\nHow can I fix this? I've searched for the answer, but there's very little information about 12.04, and people keep mentioning this .deb package that I am supposed to download from http://people.canonical.com/~sforshee/alps-touchpad/psmouse-alps-0.10/psmouse-alps-dkms_0.10_all.deb, which is a dead link.\n\nA: I was able to find a workaround that's almost good enough to be called a solution. It is possible to emulate a scroll wheel while holding down both the left and the right mouse button. They have to pressed simultaneously, but this should be easy enough on a laptop that allows you to press both of them with a single finger. Follow these steps to make it work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T) and type \nsudo apt-get install gpointing-device-settings\n\n\n*There should be a new utility called \"Pointing devices\". Since I use Gnome Classic, it's located under Applications -> System Tools -> Preferences, but you should be able to search for it in Unity.\n\n*Select \"Use middle button emulation\" and select a short timeout, unless your laptop already has three buttons. This will trigger the \"middle button\" whenever you press both buttons at once.\n\n*Select \"Use wheel emulation\" as well as vertical/horizontal scrolling to your liking.\n\n*Select button 3. This tells the system to use the \"middle button\" you just created for scrolling.\n\n*Adjust the timeout and inertia sliders for wheel emulation to the settings you find optimal.\n\n\nIf it takes to long for the \"scrolling mode\" to activate, you need to reduce the timeout. On the other hand, if scrolling is activated instead of middle clicking, you need to increase it. Select a value that suits you. I keep this one slightly to the left of the middle.\nThe inertia slider adjusts the scrolling speed. The more inertia, the slower your scrolling will be. For me, this slider is very close to the left end, and has to be adjusted very carefully.\nThat's it. Whenever you hold down both buttons, you should be able to scroll using the touchpad. As an added bonus you will get the middle button, which is good for a lot of things such as pasting text in the terminal and opening websites in new tabs.\n\nA: I have the same problem, unfortunately there is still no support for that touchpad in Linux.I've found this bug-report thread interesting to read. \nOtherwise the bug for Ubuntu is reported here.\nAlthough this bug involves a lot of different devices some of them are supported in recent kernels.\nEDIT: Support for this touchpad is now already done.

Currently, on our OpenSuSE servers, I use the System V init system to achieve this, but on our Ubuntu servers I'd rather use Upstart. But I have two questions...\nI have an Upstart job (a task) that configures the server, called, say, myconfig.\nAnd in the job that starts my java processes I ostensibly have:\nstart on stopped myconfig\nexec /path/to/myjavastartscript.sh\n\nmyjavastartscript.sh runs 'java -classpath blah MyClass'. In System V init, starting the service runs 'nohup /path/to/myjavastartscript.sh &'. \nSo my first question is whether I still need to do the nohup or run-in-background with the exec command?\nWhen running, MyClass starts other Java processes. In System V init, the service stop just looks for java processes owned by a certain user and kills them. My second question is how could I control the termination of these processes with Upstart?\n\nA: You do not need to use nohup since when Upstart runs a program, that process will not be associated with a terminal (by default).\nFor Upstart, I'd suggest either just having the job call:\nexec java -classpath blah MyClass\n\n... or ensuring that /path/to/myjavastartscript.sh calls:\nexec java -classpath blah MyClass\n\nNote that the first exec above is an Upstart stanza whereas the 2nd is a shell keyword.\nIf your shell script does not call the shell version of exec, you'll need to be careful to ensure you set the Upstart expect stanza correctly - see http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#expect.\nRegarding stopping the service, Upstart will automatically kill the process it is tracking (the main JVM process associated with MyClass) and any children of that process (technically any process in the same process group (see http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#stopping-a-job)).\nWithout more details, I'm not sure your start on condition is suitable - presumably, you want the MyClass job start if and only if a configuration file has been setup? If so, the standard idiom is for the jobs pre-start stanza to read in /etc/default/MyClass.conf. If it decides that either the file doesn't exist, or the config file somehow indicates that the service is disabled / not setup correctly, the pre-start can simply call stop to stop the job from (fully) starting (see http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#pre-start). The advantage of this approach being that your start on condition can then be reliably set to whatever set of conditions should cause the job to start. When those conditions are met, Upstart will run the job; the pre-start will run, determine the configuration is not yet valid and simply exit. The day the admin does decide to configure the service, the job will fully start.\nSee http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#determining-the-start-on-condition-ubuntu-specific and http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#ubuntu-well-known-events-ubuntu-specific for determining the start on condition.\nNote finally that you should really always specify a stop on condition too.

The processor is a brand new Intel Atom D525 (computer is brand new). It is a regular full install (so I am not trying to create a live USB) using the regular desktop installer run from another USB pendrive (to be called the live USB) which runs the Desktop 12.04 ISO. I want to use this install USB as a default for booting, no other drives are connected.\nI followed all steps from: How can I run Ubuntu without a hard drive? and from Method 1 of: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent/. So basically I created a new MBR on the USB pendrive with two partitions (EXT2 mounted on / and 2GB swap). I have installed the bootloader (GRUB) on the /dev/sda (I actually also tried /dev/sda1 just to see whether that would work...) which is the install USB (the live USB is /dev/sdb). Everything seemed to work perfectly fine (live USB boots/works perfectly).\nHowever, when booting from the install USB I am confronted with the GRUB prompt instead of a menu or Ubuntu booting. No message whatsoever, just the prompt. This happens everytime I try to install. Entering commands in the GRUB prompt such as \"ls\" all end in an error: \"hd0 read error\" or \"no such partition\".\nI have already tried these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install on /dev/sda1 instead of /dev/sda (obviously does not work, had to try)\n\n*Install using EXT4 instead of EXT2 (same result, as expected)\n\n*Reinstall GRUB using Boot-repair (same result)\n\n*Reinstall GRUB from commandline (same result)\n\n*Two complete reinstalls using a brand new Ubuntu Desktop ISO and different tools to create the live USB pendrive (hash checked) (takes ~2 hours per install including updates...)\n\n\nMy guts tell me that somehow GRUB2 is incompatible with reading from the pendrive (again, live USB boots fine, but I think that uses a different bootloader).\nI would like to use the install USB as a default boot drive (as the computer is going to be online 24/7 so a slow boot is not a problem and it should work...).

Quickly has the tendency of messing with some of the source code files (e.g. the files in debian/, licence stuff and so...), so at time it is necessary to manually save/share/release/submitubuntu (if not even run!). I think I'd be nice if this issue might be solved in future releases of quickly, for I believe that this is a problem for many Ubuntu Developers.\nMeanwhile my question is: how can one manually reproduce the steps performed by \"quickly submitubuntu\" via the command line? In particular, I'm referring to the creation of a new milestone, turning it into a release, and uploading download files into it.\nI tried looking at quickly source code, but I found it hard to follow all those methods from different modules in the first place.\n\nA: Quickly would be using the Launchpad API to perform those actions.\nTo manually do them, you can go to the project page on Launchpad, go to the series you wish to create the milestone/release on (likely trunk if you don't have multiple series to manage), and choose the \"Create Milestone\" or \"Create Release\" links on the page. Creating a release requires the creation of a new milestone if one doesn't exist, and you can do that from the create release UI. If a milestone already exists, you can go to the page for that specific milestone, and click \"Release now\" on it, or from the list of milestones. Once you create a release, the release page itself will have an \"Upload file\" link.\nTo do this from a terminal, you can grab lptools from bzr, with bzr branch lp:lptools and use the lp-project-upload contained within, to upload a file to a project release. It can upload a file to a project, and create a new milestone and release for the upload. I'm not sure if it allows uploading to an existing milestone, or  uploading additional files to an existing milestone, though.\n", "Q: Lenovo Z560 volume mute/unmute button always blinks while on battery. How do I stop that? The Lenovo Z560 Ideapad has a row of 4 led buttons in the top right corner of the keyboard.  The button on the left end of this group is the speaker mute/unmute button.  Usually, this light is either on or off to indicate the sound being muted or unmuted.  This is how it works while the laptop is plugged in to an electrical outlet.\nHowever, when running on battery, the light remains off when the sound is muted, but it constantly blinks when the sound is unmuted.  The blinking is somewhat distracting.  Is there any way I can make the led behave the same way when running on battery as it does when plugged in?  Any system file I can edit?  All I want is for the light to always remain in either a constant on or constant off state.  Blinking on and off gets distracting.  \n\nA: I think I found the solution to the problem.  See this thread:\nhttp://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/TU74PFU9NNQ\nIt looks like the issue has nothing to do with Ubuntu or the kernel and is related to the Pepper-based Adobe Flash built in to Google Chrome.

Who become the owner then?\n\nA: Each user has a unique number, called a uid. Each group has a unique number, called a gid. It's the uid and gid that gets stored as owners of files, not the username or groupname.\nThe mapping between username and uid is in /etc/passwd, and the mapping between groupname and gid is in /etc/group (unless you've set up some other form of database for this).\nWhen you use ls -l to list files, ls will query /etc/passwd and /etc/group to find the corresponding username and groupname for the file ownership. \nWhen you remove a group, you just remove the mapping between groupname and gid in /etc/group, nothing happens to the files this group owned, they'll still be owned by the same gid, but since that group doesn't exist anymore, ls -l will print the gid instead of a groupname, and no one will have access to the file via its group ownership anymore.\nIf you create a new group and it gets assigned the same gid as the one you deleted, the files will then be owned by that group.\nSee also http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Permissions\n\nA: The permissions are stored on the filesystem if that filesystem supports them.\nThere is no direct connection between the available users or groups on a particular machine with the permissions of a file/folder.\nIf you delete a group or a user the permissions simply remain the same, you have 2 commands that you can use to change user and group permission, they both require sudo:\n\n\n*\n\n*chgrp to change the group for a file/folder\n\n*chown to change the owner for a file/folder\n\n\nfor example\nsudo chgrp myfellas file.txt\n\nor\nsudo chown -R jon music/\n\n", "Q: Record and display Kinect audio and video via avconv I'm trying to record audio and video from a Kinect using avconv but I seem to have trouble specifying the right options.\navconv -f video4linux2 -video_size 640x480 -c:v h264 -c:a ac3 -i /dev/video1 test.mp4\n\nresults in:\navconv: /build/buildd/libav-extra-0.8.3ubuntu0.12.04.1/libav/libavutil/mathematics.c:79: av_rescale_rnd: Assertion `c > 0' failed.\nAborted (core dumped)\n\nCheese is perfectly happy recording the audio and video from the Kinect, so it's not a setup issue. For added fun, I also need to display the video at the same time.\n\nA: Correct avconv usage is:\navconv [global options] [input options] -i input [output options] output\n\nYou're putting all your options before your input, and so avconv is treating them all as input options. This would be better:\navconv -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video1 -s 640x480 -c:v libx264 -c:a ac3 test.mp4\n\nThe default settings may not be ideal for you; for libx264 you might want to set a -crf value (between 0 and 51, 23 is default, 18-28 is a sane range to use, lower=better quality, but bigger file) and a -preset (I normally use veryfast). For more information look here. Normally I'd recommend using VBR encoding for audio, but I don't really know about encoding AC3, so you may need to use a fixed bitrate (-b:a 192k will probably be OK for stereo sound).\nAlso, resizing the video may not be necessary, only use -s 640x480 if you need to shrink a larger input to that size.\nAs for viewing it as you're recording it, I can think of two solutions. The first is to simply open the file you are creating with your preferred video player software. This will mean a slight delay in viewing. \nThe second solution is to send a second output from avconv to stdout, and then use I/O redirection to input the information to a video player. This will be faster, but it will take about twice the processing power, since as it stands avconv can only do this by encoding a second time (this may change in the future).\navconv -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video1 -s 640x480 -c:v libx264 -c:a ac3 test.mp4 \\\n-s 640x480 -c:v libx264 -c:a ac3 -f mp4 - | vlc -\n\nI'm using VLC as an example, but all the linux video players I know can do this.

Is it similar to a simultaneous dual boot? It has been suggested to me that the use of a chroot might solve my problem of building an application that must run on an embedded device. I have inferred from this description that it is somehow similar to creating the embedded environment locally on my machine which I can then use to develop on from my desktop development machine. Is this the right way to look at the functionality or have I totally misunderstood?\nIn order to get some idea of how it works I read this https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot which I will attempt to make a chroot for an old Ubuntu version on my machine. However, as I am a total linux novice, I am a bit concerned that as I do not entirely know what I am doing is there anyway that I could end up with an unusable system?? Is this something that a novice should even attempt???\n\nA: I feel like nobody gave a full technical explanation, so here goes.\nTo understand a chroot you first have to understand the split between kernel (The Linux in GNU/Linux) and userspace (the GNU in GNU/Linux, or possibly something else, like busybox.)\nThe kernel controls all the hardware in your computer. It also provides the APIs for file access, networking, and so on, and controls which software programs are running. This all forms an abstraction of the computer, which is presented through an application programming interface (API). It doesn't do anything at all on it's own though, except maybe boot up to a black screen. Not even a shell prompt.\nThe userspace is everything else. All the software that you run on your computer. Actually the kernel only runs one userspace program directly, init, which is then responsible for starting everything else, like shells and desktop environments. Userspace also includes libraries, which generally start with libc, upon which all the other libraries build.\nSo, with that in mind, the concept of a chroot is simple. It just changes the root directory of the unix filesystem to a different one, just for whatever command you choose to run in this context. This is usually a shell which you can launch other software, much as the kernel only launches a single command directly. This new context can have a different set of userspace programs and libraries. The same kernel is running both sets of software, so both systems can use all the hardware resources, but (barring security bugs) the nested chroot cannot access anything from the primary filesystem. It has it's own version of /etc for configuration, it's own /lib for libraries, and it's own /bin, /usr/bin for programs.\nYou should be aware that the hardware devices are shared. So, unlike a virtual machine, if you format /dev/sda from inside the chroot, you will format your real harddisk. This is because the device nodes in /dev are a direct kernel interface, therefore they mean the same thing inside and outside the chroot.\nOne other thing: it is possible to give the chroot access to the outer filesystem with bind mounts. If you use a chroot building tool it is possible that it \"helpfully\" mounts /home from the main system inside the chroot. This is not a copy, it's the same filesystem, and in this case any changes you make inside the chroot will be performed on the original. So I recommend you build chroots manually until you are comfortable with how they work.\nOther than these two potential problems there isn't much that can go wrong with a chroot, as it is mostly a self-contained system that will only be started when you ask for it.\n\nA: A Non-Technical Explanation\nLet me try to explain chroot in terms of Windows. In windows the \"root\" of the boot partition is called \"C:\\\" In Linux it is called \"/\". choort (temporarily) allows you to make some other folder/partition/device the root partition. If Windows had a choot command it might have worked as follows.\nImagine you have a computer with two partitions or drives with two versions (or copies) of Windows installed. Lets Call them WinA and WinB. When you boot WinA, its root becomes C:\\ and WinB may appear to be in D:. When you boot WinB, C:\\ refers to the partition where WinB is installed and D:\\ is where WinA is. Now let's say you want to make some changes to both WinA and WinB by running a program z. When you run z it does all the changes you want to the system that has the root C:. In the Windows world you have to boot WinA run z and then boot WinB and run z. chroot allows you to make the D:\\ into C:\\ without rebooting. So you can boot WinA run chroot to make the D: the new C: and run program z so that changes are made to the WinB which resides in D:\\ instead of WinA, which is in the original C:.\nNow let me give an example of how I have used chroot. Once my Ubuntu became unbootable. It turned out that the grub needed to be reinstalled. This is easy if I could boot Ubuntu and run the command that installs grub. But I needed to do this from an USB. So I booted Ubuntu from a USB drive. If I issued the command to install grub I would install grub to the USB. So I needed to mount the partion in the hard drive where the Ubuntu with broken grub is installed and use chroot to point to that mounted partition. Then I reinstalled grub and grub got installed in the hard drive where it should be.\n\nA: chroot has nothing to do with dual booting. The idea behind chroot is the ability to switch one program, or one shell, etc., to a new root directory, allowing you to have multiple \"systems\" at the same time. \"systems\" is in quotes because there is still only one Linux kernel running. This other \"system\" is an additional set of the code tools, home directories, etc. So, if you are on an x86 machine, and are trying to build some software for ARM on your machine, you could create a chrooted environment whose /proc tells the software that it's on ARM, an ARM GCC toolchain, etc. (There are many programs that do that). The other thing chroot can do is some very limited sandboxing, that combined with something like SELinux and basic Linux permissions, could create a relatively secure sandbox, in which this application thinks it's on a different system. Another use of chroot would be testing. If you have an application that does different things based on some system directory, you can create a chroot to test it in. \n\nA: Chroot allows you to run a command or shell from another root directory. If it was suggested to you because of an embedded device, it means that you will be running a shell from that device's root directory.\n\nA: Not really, no.\nBooting an OS involves loading a kernel that controls the hardware and then runs a number of other programs.  chroot runs a program ( typically a shell, from where you can run other programs ) under your current kernel, only the kernel lies to the program and pretends that the root directory is some other directory than the one it is really using as the root.  Hence, the name of the command, because it changes the root directory.\nIn your case, debootstrap sets up a directory tree that is suitable to use as a root directory.  You could boot a kernel and tell it to use that directory as the root instead of your normal root fs, and you would be booting that system.  By using chroot you can run programs as if they were being run under a kernel that booted using that directory as its root, without actually having to do so.\n\nA: When you are booting from another system, for example a Live CD, you can enter into a file system (linux) by using chroot. \nWith this, you could for example repair GRUB (in case of errors).

In other words, how can I trigger Nautilus, if possible, to display a tool tip or notification box of some sort on mouse over a folder or directory?\n\nA: Neither Thunar, PCManFM, nor Nautilus have this feature, I don't know about Dolphin as I don't have it Installed, while I think is possible they could have it they don't currently use it.\nAs @Tom mentioned in the comments, Gnome Sushi is the closest to have that but you need to press the Space bar  for the window to show and I don't know if if it's a bug only affecting me but the Sushi window uses a Black background with black text making it useless but you can still try it.\n\nA: No, as I know, there is no such a method.

I am running lubuntu on netbook and it has a few bugs with brightness and touchpad but I don't mind too much because it was cheap.\nI need something a bit higher spec now so I have been looking into dell laptops for more support but I am not sure if there are others? Or even how good dell are with this?\n\nA: Well, I for one think that the best Ubuntu laptops are System76. The customer service is outstanding, everything works out of the box and you have 3 different models to choose from and configure the specs at your personal taste. Quality/price is the best out there. Try to find the same specs for same price with other major vendors (dell, HP, etc...).\nI am a proud owner of a System76 system and can truly tell you that you won't be disappointed. I am actually thinking in buying my second device (a 14' laptop for travelling).\nHope this is what you are looking for. They have a support forum if you have doubts and their support staff is very active there.\nEnjoy!\n\nA: Dell's Ubuntu offerings are fairly paltry, http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/laptops.aspx?ref=us-eb-lt#!facets=80770~0~1791343&p=1. I would recommend purchasing from a company that fully supports Linux/Ubuntu, such as System76, Zareason, Think Penguin, or LinPC. Personally, I can only vouch for System76, but I have been very pleased with their desktop offerings. So much so, that I made them our standard desktops where I work. They also have great, knowledgeable staff.\n", "Q: IPV6 modules whats really needed? I've added blacklist ipv6 to my blacklist.conf file to keep the ipv6 module from loading, but there's a lot of other modules related to ipv6 as well that I'd like to know if I can add to the list as well. For example: ip6t_LOG ip6t_rt ip6table_filter ip6_tables Is it safe to unload these modules as well or are they needed for proper and safe functionality of iptables and ipv4? \n\nA: (One wonders why you want to blacklist IPv6. Isn't IPv6 what we're all supposed to be migrating to?)\nThose other modules aren't necessary for IPv4 functionality, so you can safely blacklist them. On the other hand, you shouldn't need to bother blacklist them because nothing should be causing them to load anyway unless you're trying to configure some ip6tables rules... and even if they load, they won't have any effect anyway if there is no IPv6 packet processing going on.\n", "Q: check hdd for errors and repair My boot in windows is damaged, i've tried several things and every time (even when i'm trying to format with a clean installation of windows 7, repair disc win7 doesn't work either) i try it gets to a black screen only with the mouse arrow. i installed ubuntu 12.04 via usb stick and everything is working fine, apart some bad sectors 22 that ubuntu states - probably the errors are from there.

I tried both and none work, what am I doing wrong? Also I am logged as root.\n\nA: It's actually \"owner:group\", meaning that you have to provide a username for the first and a groupname for the second argument. Giving a username as the second argument should lead to an error if there is no group of the same name.\n\nA: Mrokii is correct; in addition,if you are trying to change ownership on a single file you don't need the -R (recursive option) as one has to be very careful when recursively changing ownership of files. Also, logging in as root is not usually done in Ubuntu desktop unless you do it via the ctrl-alt-fn virtual terminals just for the duration of that session then return to the graphical desktop.\n\nA: chown -R me:users **\n\nWorked, I was capitalizing on the first letter, apparently that is a no no. \n", "Q: How do I prevent race conditions in Upstart 'starting on' scripts? I am working on a package that needs two Upstart jobs: one that launches a daemon, and another that launches a supporting daemon if the configuration file requires it. The logic to determine if the supporting daemon should be launched involves processing the configuration file with sed and friends, which causes problems with Upstart's daemonization detection (Upstart has no way to distinguish PIDs), so expect fork and expect daemon aren't useful. Unfortunately, this means Upstart detects the first invocation of sed as the first PID, and immediately starts the main job, before the supporting daemon is fully initialized. This frequently leads to the premature termination of the main job, due to an improperly configured environment.\nIs there any way to prevent Upstart from starting the main job too soon in this scenario?\nexpect stop looks like it's close to what I need, but I don't see a way to raise that signal without terminating one of the daemons, neither of which generate the SIGSTOP signal on their own.\n\nA: Simple - use a pre-start stanza to perform all your sed checking. If the pre-start determines that the supporting daemon should not be started, have it call simply stop (which forces Upstart to not continue starting the job). There is an example of this in the Upstart Cookbook here:\nhttp://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#pre-start\nNote that Upstart only performs PID tracking for the exec and script stanzas (in other words the \"main\" part of the job) - PIDs for pre-start, post-stop et al are not tracked. See http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#expect\n\nA: The solution to this ended up being in the Upstart documentation: \n\nCreate a post-start section that performs some check and only returns once the service is \"ready\".\n\n", "Q: Why does checking locally cause cloud files to overwrite newer files on my pc I used Ubuntu One to upload my Documents folder and some other folders to one.ubuntu.com.

I tried clicking it yesterday, and it overwrote my more recent pc files with older version in the cloud. Fortunately, I had backed them up.\n\nA: You need to have the \"Sync locally? []\" check box checked in the control panel, in order to keep the folder in sync, yes. If it is unchecked, then Ubuntu One is not keeping those files in sync locally.\nHowever, if it overwrites newer files with the old ones, that is a bug and you should open a bug report on Launchpad against ubuntuone-client about it:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I report a bug?\n", "Q: Start-up Application I often get an error window after I booted my computer to the desktop.

Just enter start into the Unity Shell, select Startup Programs and look in the list for possible apps.\n\nA: What kind of error window do you get?

How to disable the keyring for SSH and GPG ?\nI would like to keep the keyring for the wifi and other stuff. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: In a terminal session (using Ctrl-Alt-T) you can stop the gnome-keyring process from working with ssh by using:\nunset SSH_AUTH_SOCK \n\nThe --no-use-agent option is available to gpg to avoid using the gnome-keyring process with gpg, however that is the default.\nYou can stop the nautilus seahorse-tool from using the gpg-agent by using:\nrm `echo $GPG_AGENT_INFO | sed s/:0:1//`\n\nYou can stop the gnome-keyring process completely with the command:\nkill $GNOME_KEYRING_PID\n\nEach of the above actions is restored by logging in again.\n\nWifi passwords available to all userids are stored in the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ directory rather than being stored in your gnome keyring, so they can remain available if you kill the gnome-keyring process.\nThe ssh-add command can be used to delete (or add) specific keys from/to the current gnome-keyring while the keyring process is running.\nIndividual key passwords can be deleted from the login or other keyring using the Passwords tab of the Passwords and Keys program (seahorse).\nIf the gnome-keyring isn't present, ssh-agent will still be running, but it doesn't store gpg keys. \n\nThere are two lines in /etc/pam.d/lightdm involved with saving the login password and starting the gnome-keyring-daemon with the login keyring unlocked with the login password. The second starts the daemon: \nsession optional        pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start\n\nCommenting out just this line would stop it from starting for all sessions of all users of your system using the login password to unlock the login keyring. \n/etc/xdg/autostart/ contains start entries for various categories of secrets gnome-keyring can handle. To stop the daemon from starting these components these files can be moved out of this directory. You can move all the gnome-keyring-* files to stop the daemon from starting or can simply refuse to supply the login password again to disable the login keyring while leaving the daemon running.\n\nA: To stop gnome-keyring from starting its (broken) SSH agent on Ubuntu 16.04:\nmkdir ~/.config/upstart || true\necho manual > ~/.config/upstart/gnome-keyring-ssh.override\n\n# This step can be done with the gnome-session-properties tool\nmkdir ~/.config/autostart || true\ncp /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop ~/.config/autostart\necho 'X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false' >> ~/.config/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop\n\n\nA: First duplicate the file /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop into ~/.config/autostart/.\nThen edit ~/.config/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop in order to remove the following line:\nNoDisplay=true\n\nand to add the following line at the end:\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false\n\nThis should disable SSH management when you restart your session.\nTo disable GPG, do the same with the file /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop.\n\nA: With current version of Ubuntu, changing the .desktop file mentioned in other answers is not sufficient anymore. An additional upstart job was added that also starts gnome-keyring-daemon.

Chrome gives “Aw Snap!” on every site and Firefox exits giving an error. Then I restart Ubuntu and everything is normal. Why does it fail to start when I start ubuntu for the first time?\n\n*Sometimes I get “System Program Problem Detected”. I even performed sudo rm /var/crash/*. It disappers on restart but it then comes back again.\nShould I check if my all packages are properly installed? How?\n\nA: Run a memory test. At the boot menu, instead of picking Ubuntu or Windows, pick “Memory test”. See Faulty hardware in the Ubuntu community documentation for more details. If you don't get a boot menu, see configuring Grub2 for how to enable it.\nSeriously. Linux is pretty demanding on the RAM. RAM tends to fail in subtle ways: if you write a value to a location and read it later, it comes out right — except when you've done a very particular sequence of writes and you happen to read at exactly the wrong time. I've seen computers that seemed to run Windows just fine, and even ran some applications under Linux — but start using Firefox (which uses a lot of RAM), and the crashes would come. I ran a memory test, which showed a single failure; I replaced the RAM sticks, and that machine ran without rebooting for the next year or so.\nThe crash reports in /var/crash are just that: crash reports. They are a consequence of the crashes, not a cause. They might help in diagnosing what is wrong; but if it's failing RAM, the crashes tend to look pretty random.\n", "Q: Use UbunuOne Share instead of YouSendit as Thunderbird filelink I think the title says it all. \nI have a 25GB U1 account and I like the option provided in Thunderbird to upload large e-mail attachments to YouSendit. \nIs there a way to use U1 instead of YouSendit? \nI could obviously publish the file via U1 and copy the weblink into the mail body. But I'd like to be able to have the step happen automatically when files exceed a certain size.

So I need to transfer several times from / to my SD card. The problem is that, when I insert my SD-card in the reader, it gets automatically mounted and Nautilus opens. So I transfer my files and then remove the card. After removing it, I just can't get it to mount again.\nI insert it and nothing opens. Tried to mount via terminal, but just can't open it in Nautilus again. After restart, it automatically opens like before but again just only one time. What can I do? I have restarted my laptop about 15 times today.\n\nA: On my system (does not have a built-in card reader), I have a multi-card reader which shows several \"drives\", such as SD, SM, CF, etc with no devices plugged in.  When I plug in an SD card, the SD card mounts and its name shows up after the \"drive\".\nIf I eject the SD card, or simply remove it, then next time I insert it, it will auto-mount.  But if I select the SD card, and choose \"Safely remove Drive\" from the right-click context menu, then the entire reader unmounts, and I can't simply insert the SD card to read it - I need to unplug the reader, and plug it back in.\nI realize this may not be a normal answer, depending on whether you have an internal or external reader, and whether you choose the \"Safely remove drive\" option or not, but if you do choose this method, you might try simply \"eject\" or just removing the card.\nIf you already simply remove the card, you might try using \"eject\" to see if that makes a difference in your case.\n\nA: Looks like this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/udisks/+bug/743303\nReloading these kernel modules helped:\nsudo rmmod mmc_block rtsx_usb_ms rtsx_usb_sdmmc rtsx_usb\nsudo modprobe rtsx_usb_sdmmc\n\nFTYI, I found the relevant modules with lsmod|grep mmc\n", "Q: Matlab R2010b under Ubuntu 12.04 - installation issue So, I am trying to install matlab (R2010b) and I can't get the installer to appear.

This is an unusual place to mount a DVD image. More importantly, it is the same directory where MATLAB should be installed (see the -root argument at the end of the command to run). I can’t verify it right know, but it could be that the installer doesn't do anything because of that reason.\nIf mounting the DVD image at some other location does not help, some ideas for further analysis of the problem: It is quite obvious from the source of the installation script that the only thing which can fail without showing a real error is the command stated as “command to run”. Therefore, you could try to run that command manually and adding the -verbose argument. However, the installation script creates some temporary files you will need beforehand. The easiest way to get these is probably commenting line 567 of the script:\nrm -rf $TEMP_DIR\n\nThen you execute it once and can afterwards execute the actual installation command with the -verbose flag.\n\nA: I know this may not sound very useful seeing as it doesn't answer your question, however I've found that on Ubuntu GNU Octave combined with the QtOctave UI (both downloadable from Ubuntu Software Centre) work well to give you an alternative (slightly different UI but identical syntax) if you don't manage to get Matlab working and you really need to get some things done it's quite nice, my laptop crashed a while back and I was really glad I'd had this as a quick option. \nEdit: Forgot to mention, creates identical files to Matlab, so any compatibility issues are pretty much non-existent.\n", "Q: What is the difference between a \"/\" (root) and a /home partition at installation? I am making a 10G partition \"/\" (root) partition that will contain my Ubuntu OS and the rest of the drive will be the \"/home\" with the music, home, download, etc...folders. (that come originally.....)\nDo those general folders go directly on the /home partition?\nI mean if I make a / and a /home partition....that means that one day when I wanna reinstall Ubuntu, I'll just need to do it on the / partition and all the data that is on /home (in the download, home, music...etc folders) will stay there after the installation. Am I right?\n\nA: Root (/) is the root of the entire filesystem to which other directories can be mounted in various branches of the filesystem.  One of these branches is /home/, and in this directory, individual users have a \"home directory\" using their username.  In your home directory are all your personal directories such as music, documents, etc.\nIn theory, you can keep your home directory, but a lot of preferences, etc, are stored there, and will remain even if not used.  When you install a new version, you would specify your /home partition to be mounted in the new installation and it will use it just as if it were not separate.\n", "Q: Recommend place for google appengine launcher files to reside? There is no launcher for google appengine like you have on the windows environs. However there is a workaround.\nProblem is I copied everything to my ~/Downloads/google-appengine-launcher folder. It worked okay. In the shell I just cd to the above path and do ./GoogleAppengineLauncher.py; it works!! \nBut since that being a user specific folder I moved it to another generic location: /usr/share/apps, and I added a symbolic link to the above script as follows:\nln -s /usr/share/apps/google-appengine-launcher/GoogleAppengineLauncher.py /usr/bin/google-appengine-launcher\n\nNow I do Alt+F2 to bring the Run dialog, and type in google-appengine-launcher, appengine application windows loads, but there is an error message saying it can't load icons...why is this so? How to fix this?\n\nA: There is no official way, but here is how I do it and it works out well...\nThis dir may already be created for you if you have Google Chrome installed. If not, lets create it then move the folder inside:\nsudo mkdir -p /opt/google/\nmv /usr/share/apps/google-appengine-launcher /opt/google\n\nNow edit your ~/.bashrc file and at the very bottom add:\nexport PATH=/opt/google/google-appengine-launcher:$PATH\n\nThen run:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nYou may need to log out and back in for Alt+F2 to work (I'm not certain). But that should be all you need to do.\nOne last note, make sure and remove your symlink from before.\nTo have a simpler name as a start-up command:\nCreate an alias, shell function, a script, or a desktop shortcut.\nFor example, to create an alias, add this to .bashrc:\nalias start_gae='GoogleAppEngineLauncher.py'\n\nThen it's only necessary to enter start_gae at the shell prompt.\n", "Q: Corel Painter on Wine I have a copy of Corel Painter left over from my Windows/Mac days and wonder if anyone can attest to using Painter under Wine?

According to the AppDB, all three versions tested are \"garbage\", which means that they barely work or not at all. Please refer to thetest results linked at http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=9119 for more details.\n", "Q: Usefullness of multi-threading for Ubuntu \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs Ubuntu optimized for multicore CPUs? \n\nI'm looking for a new laptop, one on which I am able to install (and multi-boot) Ubuntu. Some laptops offer processors with multi-threading, but I'm wondering whether it makes any sense to have such a core: Does Ubuntu OS support it, and are there (m)any apps that support it?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: All laptops allow multi-threading to work. Even the Intel laptops without HyperThreading generally all have at least 2 CPU cores, so you will still get SMP support. A lot of apps don't use threads though, so those apps may not generally see any benefit, or it may not be obvious. Even without it though, the kernel can place processes on other cores when started, which allows things to run faster.\n\nA: I recently bought an Intel i7 2670QM laptop recently. It sports 4 cores, plus 4 virtual cores (8cores). I have to admit that I am not very impressed with this processor. Firefox generally supports multi-threading, but most programs do not, so I'm usually Maxing out at about 15-25% of this cpu's potential performance. If I had it to do over again, I probably would have went with a CPU with less cores, and more power per core. Fortunately, as multi-core systems become more popular, more software will become multi-threaded, but we just aren't quite yet there today.\n\nA: Although the kernel does handle assigning cores to processes, CPU affinity can be viewed and manually set for a process using taskset- see man taskset. However, it should be said that this is only used in very particular circumstances, and in an instance when, perhaps for a benchmarking or troubleshooting task, one wants to run one process in one particular core. One can find the pid of a process with ps -oe pid,args then query taskset for that affinity: taskset -p <pid>, which will return something like pid 2027's current affinity mask: 1. \nTo find the number of processing units available, use nproc- see man nproc. If you need to run an old app or game on a single core you can launch it with taskset -c <core> <app>. (Cores begin at 0). Other programs such as xargs can be made to run with parallel execution units using the P switch followed by n (number required)- see man xargs.\n", "Q: First time install: Ubuntu is incredibly slow. I just installed Ubuntu, and I must admit, I have no idea what I'm doing in linux. I installed it on my old Lenovo T60, and I was surprised at how slow it runs.

Just to illustrate how fresh I am, I don't even know how to get root in the terminal.\n\nA: Trying logging out, then click the gear on the login box to change to an \"Ubuntu 2D\" session.  This requires less in terms of video and CPU resources (it tends to work better on many older or slower machines).  \n", "Q: Ubuntu starts only when I boot from my flash drive I have installed the Ubuntu 12.04 using a bootable USB. The installation went fine but after the installation there was just a blank screen with the cursor blinking and Ubuntu wasn't starting. Maybe that was an installation error but when I booted again from my USB surprisingly Ubuntu started working. Even if I remove the USB after the initial boot, Ubuntu keeps working fine. Do I have to boot from my USB each time I restart my computer?\n\nA: The problem\nGrub, Ubuntu's bootloader, was installed on the flash drive, and not on your internal hard drive, as it should have been.\nSolution\nBoot with the flash drive plugged in. Remove it once Ubuntu is booted up.\nRun the following commands from a Terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\nboot-repair\n\nClick on the \"Recommended repair\" button, and reboot.\nExplanation\nBoot-Repair installed Grub to your internal hard drive. This allows your computer to boot without depending on the bootloader that was installed on the flash drive.\n\nGlossary\n\nBootloader: a piece of code that runs before any operating system is running. A bootloader is used to boot other operating\n  systems. Each operating system usually has its own bootloader.\nGRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader): a bootloader package developed to support multiple operating systems and allow the user to select among them during boot-up. It is Ubuntu's default bootloader.\nCommand, command line: the traditional Unix environment , where you type commands to tell the computer what to do.\nTerminal: an application that allows you to access the command line. Open it by hitting its keyboard shortcut, Ctrl Alt T\n\n\nA: As SirCarlo says on his answer, this is caused for not installing mbr on the internel drive.\nI prefer this solution myself.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to the Ubuntu using USB drive.\n\n*Open a terminal and use this command\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n\n*Then this command\nsudo update-grub\n\nNote: If you have more than one hard drive, including USB drive, the system assigns letter a, b, c ... to them.

Is there a way to have an installation of Ubuntu with all the usual programs or pre-defined ones?\nEg: Blender, Gimp, VLC, Firezila\nI'm having to install Ubuntu a few times and Id like a preset install.\n\nA: If you don't want to create and maintain an installation that may change as you add or remove favorite programs, another option is to save the installed progrms using either synaptic, the command-line, or a feature in the Software Center + Ubuntu one called \"Sync between computers.\"\nIf you use the software center, it has a feature in the \"File\" menu called \"Sync between computers\" where you can use your Ubuntu One account to keep apps synched between multiple computers.  AskUbuntu has instructions for it.\nIf you use synaptic, there's an option in the File menu to \"Save Markings\" and \"Read Markings\".  This will save all the installed programs to a file.\nFrom the command line, there's a way to do it, also.  There's an AskUbuntu article that explains this process.\nUnfortunately, none of these methods will install anything that was installed manually rather than using the repository.  But there are drawbacks to any method.\n\nA: Try Remastersys (No longer being maintained or updated) Relinux, which is a fork of Remastersys.

I have copied downloaded deb package when installing software from software center or terminal. Is it possible to make a single package instead of multiple package. Exp: Thunder bird have 3 package when i download it. Now i want to make standalone package.\n\nA: Not without re-packaging everything with dpkg-deb at the least (and that's not easy as tar).\nI recommend you tar or zip up all the debs, extract them to a single directory, then cd into it and simply run sudo dpkg -i *.deb to install them all (dpkg will resolve the dependencies automatically as long as they are all present).\n\nA: It's difficult to define precisely what the dependencies are. If there are three packages for Thunderbird on one machine, there might be a different number of dependencies to install on a different machine, unless you're considering adding together all of several thousand possible packages.\nThe thing is, each package has lots of dependencies. Some are already installed, and some aren't. So the package manager determines which ones aren't already installed and installs them--and those are the only ones it bothers mentioning to you, even though there are actually many more. Naturally, the list will vary from machine to machine depending on the other software installed.\nYou can reduce the possible number of dependencies to be separately installed by bundling some things together (at the cost of wasted space on machines that already have some of the bundled software), but you can't eliminate it.\nAnother issue is that sometimes a single source package is split up into several binary packages. Again, this is for greater efficiency. Perhaps you might not want to install all of a program. Or there might be some parts that are platform-independent and don't need to be built separately for different types of machines.\n", "Q: Logitech G700 mouse scrollwheel is way too sensitive, how can I configure it? I am trying to migrate my brother to use Ubuntu.\nHowever, his Logitech G700 mouse's scroll wheel is extremely sensitive. \nBy sensitive, I mean that, due to the fact that it uses high-resolution scrolling, every minor nudge is interpreted as a scroll attempt. \nI have no way to configure this in Ubuntu - I want the OS to ignore every few events from the mouse scroll wheel to make it work properly. xev in a terminal is going crazy whenever I even lay a finger on the scroll wheel.\nHow can I fix this issue?\n\nA: I don't know about the Logitech G700, but here's what I did for my Perixx MX-2000, maybe it's something like that for you too : \n\n\n*\n\n*Perixx delivered my mouse with a CD-ROM containing the software to configure it's buttons, sensibility, LED and Macro's\n\n*I installed this software on a Windows Operating System and plugged my mouse in.\n\n*I configured everything through the Perixx Software\n\n*Once I was sure that my mouse did exactly what I wanted it to do, I unplugged it. \n\n\nNow, everything is configured inside the mouse, so I don't need the software anymore.

I used Wubi to download 12.04 on a new partition. When restarting, the computer (Levono windows 7 -64) froze with no signal on my screen. Turning the computer on and off I received the option to sign in on windows or ubuntu. Windows worked well, but Ubuntu seems to bomb again as before. I can look at the new partition where some Ubuntu files exist via Windows explorer. What am I to do?  Is 12.04 compatible with windows 7?\n\nA: By default, Wubi does not install on a different partition. It creates a virtual \"hard disk\" file within your primary storage drive (typically C:), from which it runs Ubuntu.\nIf you intentionally instructed it to create this disk on a separate partition of your drive, it could be that Windows is having issues interacting with it. Can you access that partition's letter from Windows (specifically, the Wubi directory, which is X:/ubuntu, where X is the respective drive letter)?\nIf you simply mistook the function of the Wubi installer, then I'm not quite certain. It could be a corrupted .iso file, or perhaps an incompatible one (I'm not sure if a 64-bit Ubuntu .iso can be installed over a 32-bit Windows system, for example). It could also be that, for whatever reason, Wubi didn't install the grub2 bootloader (the bootloader which appears after you select Ubuntu after boot) correctly.\nIf I were you, I'd just uninstall Ubuntu through the Control Panel or by running Wubi again (it should prompt you to uninstall), and reinstall it, making sure it is on the same partition as your Windows installation.\nedit - It could also be that your hard drive is overly fragmented (though this is unlikely). If none of the above solutions work, running the Windows defrag tool after installation might help.\n\nA: This is the standard \"black-screen-on-boot\" that regular Ubuntu users with Nvidia/AMD graphics often have.\nYou need to do the following from within Windows:\nEdit file C:\\ubuntu\\install\\wubildr-disk.cfg\nIt should look like:\n\nloopback loop0 /ubuntu/disks/root.disk\nset root=(loop0)\nsearch --set=diskroot -f -n /ubuntu/disks/root.disk\nprobe --set=diskuuid -u $diskroot\nlinux /vmlinuz root=UUID=$diskuuid loop=/ubuntu/disks/root.disk preseed/file=/ubuntu/install/preseed.cfg wubi-diskimage ro quiet splash\ninitrd /initrd.img\nboot\n\nEdit the long boldedlinux /vmlinuz ... line to add nomodeset at the end. I would also recommend removing quiet splash until your WUBI is working just right. So the end-should look like .... wubi-diskimage ro nomodeset.\nSave, reboot into Wubi-buntu.\nThen go to Settings...Additional Drivers, and install the appropriate Nvidia/AMD driver. Once that's done, you can go back to Windows and edit the file again, removing nomodeset.\n", "Q: Is virtualization in Windows less battery intensive than Wubi? Than a disk install? I read that running Ubuntu through a virtual machine such as VMware Player or VirtualBox is actually less costly on a laptop's battery than Wubi because it utilizes Windows' drivers, which are optimized for Windows by the hardware manufacturers, as opposed to the Linux drivers, which are less optimized and thus more costly for your system. Is this true for Wubi? If so, is it also true for a \"normal\" Live CD/USB installation?\n\nA: This is not universally true. Some manufacturers/brands of laptops, such as Lenovo Thinkpads, give about equal battery life in Windows or Ubuntu (from personal experience).\n\n\n*\n\n*The two big culprits for why Ubuntu/Linux has somewhat poorer battery life than Windows are (a) Nvidia/AMD hybrid/switchable graphics and (b) auxiliary power management (ACPI) such as fans, screen backlight, etc.-\n\n*Most laptop manufacturers will choose to use the cheapest components possible. Since the laptop is bundled with Windows, and the overwhelming majority of its user base will use Windows, the manufacturer often does not bother to check whether these components have adequate Linux support or not. As long as the components come with Windows drivers, that's all that matters.\n\n*For graphics, the Nvidia/AMD refuse to enable the switching capability in their Linux drivers. Consequently, unless you take the extra steps of installing a third-party solution like Bumblebee or vgaswitcheroo -- which may or may not work and aren't automatic -- your discrete graphics are running all the time in Linux/Ubuntu and sucking up power, even if you are doing no \"3D gaming\" or other heavy stuff.\n\n*Similarly, the stock Linux drivers for things like fan control, screen brightness/dimming, etc. are often inadequately configured and you will have things like the fan running 100% full time, screen not auto-dimming, etc. which also use up power.\n\n\nNote that everything which applies to a regular/dual-boot install also applies to Wubi. Wubi is only slightly slower/more CPU intensive than a regular install because it stores its filesystem on the Windows partition (NTFS), and therefore I/O has slightly more overhead associated with it.\nWhile a virtual machine may at best be only 90-95% as efficient as a real machine, if your laptop has problems like the above, then yes, virtualization in Windows with the \"working\" drivers/power management will most probably use less battery than running Wubi/Ubuntu.\nSadly, there's no way to tell how compatible your laptop is until you try it -- spending time tweaking it, use it for a while, ask a few AU questions, etc. to see if you can get great battery life (or not). The laptops that do work well with Linux (Thinkpads, etc.) are usually sold as \"business/corporate\" machines, and have a price premium associated with them. It's fair though, because I suppose this premium partly enables the use of higher-quality/better-supported internal components.\n", "Q: Telnet output file DOES NOT WORK Correctly UNDER Crontab I'm using the Ubuntu 10.04.4LTS, and have Ganglia installed in my computer.\nI used to get the Gmetad data by typing:\ntelnet localhost 8651 > /test/test.txt\n\nor made a .sh file to run it.

Hoping someone could help me solve this problem or give me some direction for studying.\nThanks.\n\nA: Use nc:\n The nc (or netcat) utility is used for just about anything under the sun\n involving TCP or UDP.  It can open TCP connections, send UDP packets,\n listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, do port scanning, and deal with\n both IPv4 and IPv6.  Unlike telnet(1), nc scripts nicely, and separates\n error messages onto standard error instead of sending them to standard\n output, as telnet(1) does with some.\n\nTo install it, type sudo apt-get install netcat-openbsd.\nSomething like this should be a good replacement for your telnet line (this assumes you don't have to send or type anything to get the data; sorry, I'm unfamiliar with ganglia):\nnc localhost 8651 > /test/test.txt\n\nAnd on your /etc/crontab:\n* * * * * root nc localhost 8651 > /test/test.txt\n\nNote that if you're running this as root, then you don't need sudo. Indeed, even as a normal user, you should not need to use sudo to run nc.

So can i Start ubuntu without affecting any files from the CD and then install ubuntu fully on harddrive when I have backed up the files ?\n\nA: As indicated in step 2 of these instructions, you can try Ubuntu from the CD without affecting your installed files or existing operating system, but you should expect running Ubuntu from this Live CD to be slower than it would when installed on the hard drive.\n\nA: Yes, you can try Ubuntu without affecting anything. Once booted into the \"live\" desktop, you can even use Ubuntu to back up files/data from your Windows drive on to a USB, etc.\nOnce you are satisfied everything is backed up, you can click the Install Ubuntu icon in the live desktop, or boot with the \"Install Ubuntu\" option to finally install Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How do I delete a random line in a text file from a given range? I have a text file and I want to delete random lines from a range.

It would be great if there is a solution in vim, so one can apply it on different ranges.\n\nA: Here's a solution using sed:\nsed -i $((start + RANDOM % range))d filename.txt\nwhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*start is the beginning line number of your range\n\n*range (or end-start is the number of lines to include from start)\n\n*sed -i -Nd tells sed to delete line N in the input file\n\n*RANDOM is bash's random number generator; a special shell variable that holds a random integer between 0 and 32767 when you use it.\n\n\nSo, for example, to delete a random line between lines 90 and 120 in file test.txt, you'd use:\nsed -i $((90 + RANDOM % 30))d test.txt\n\nA: In order to delete multiple random lines form a specific range in the text file, here is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file in vim \n\n*Go to the top of the range from where you want to remove multiple random lines. The range should have an empty line at the bottom  \n\n*Enter the following command:\n.,/^\\s*$/-1 !sed -e $((9 * $RANDOM / 32267))d\n\n. - From here\n,/^\\s*$/-1 - Till the last non-blank line\n!sed -e $((9 * $RANDOM / 32267))d - the sed command to delete a random line\nThat will delete one line at random.\nNow, if you want to delete 5 more random lines, just do 5@: and vim does the rest.\nThis can be further improved if I can replace that 9 (number of lines from which to delete) with some expression that will be universal\n\nA: Use the following command \n:nd\n\nwhere n is the line number. \n\nA: It is possible with python as well:\nbash-4.3$ python -c 'import sys,random;lines=sys.stdin.readlines();lines.pop(random.randint(0,len(lines)-1));print \"\".join(lines)' < input.txt\nLine 1: abcd\nLine 2: efgh\nLine 3: ijkl\nLine 5: qrst\nLine 6: uvwxyz\n\nThe process here is simple, we redirect input file into python's stdin and read all lines into a list. Then we select random line index via random.randint() function within the range of all indexes in the list, from index 0 to last index ( that's what len(lines)-1 does). That index is removed from list via lines.pop(), and we then print reassembled text.

If you directly plug into a cable modem/DSL router, or somehow your college hands out unfiltered public IPs (very rare), you should just use the built-in ufw (Ubuntu's firewall), and set a default policy blocking all inbound connections.\n\n\n\nAlso, if I should have the misfortune of getting my Linux install completely messed up (say, I install a malicious software package), is there any way I can prevent this digital fire from spreading to my Windows partition?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Well, malicious packages for Linux are rare; your Windows partition (and data in general) is much more susceptible to plain human error ;)\n\n*If you want to be very cautious, and you dual-boot, you can create a 5-10GB FAT32 partition or so for sharing between Win and Lin, and mount your Windows partition read-only in Linux.\n\n*\n\n*Wubi is riskier than dual-boot because it must, by definition, have read/write access to your Windows partition\n\n\n*If you are using a virtual machine, well, you're completely isolated -- just make sure you choose the shared folders carefully, and make any that contain important data read-only to prevent any errors in the Ubuntu VM from affecting them.\n\n", "Q: Openvpn client web traffic setting problems I have setup an openvpn access server in my vps.

It is caused by the Chinese National Firewall.\nThe DNS servers in China are all polluted, so that the website such as \"twitter\" and \"facebook\" has been redirects to the non-exsits targets. Through this way, the websites cannot be access in China. See the link for DNS cache poisoning.\nSo using VPN server to do dns lookup can solve this problem, just adding two lines to the openvpn configuration file(client.ovpn):\nup /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf\ndown /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf\n\nAlso ensure the resolvconf package is installed on the client, as this script depends on it.\nNow the OpenVPN access server works fine for me to break through the Chinese National Firewall.\n", "Q: Cheese is not working with Ubuntu 11.10 in HPG62 laptop When I run cheese in terminal, it gives following message and cheese comes up with black screen, and nothing works in it.\nAny help will be highly appreciated.\n(cheese:2966): Gtk-WARNING **: Attempting to add a widget with type GtkImage to a GtkButton, but as a GtkBin subclass a GtkButton can only contain one widget at a time; it already contains a widget of type GtkLabel\n\n** (cheese:2966): WARNING **: Could not get buffers from device '/dev/video0'.\n\n** (cheese:2966): WARNING **: Could not map buffers from device '/dev/video0'\n\n** (cheese:2966): WARNING **: Could not negotiate format\n\n\nA: Problem solved: I just updated my Ubuntu 11.10 and then installed guvcview .\nNow everything is working fine.

Make sure that your username is member of www-data group, if not, you can add  sudo adduser matt www-data\nsudo chown matt:www-data -R /var/www\n\nThe second thing, we should set permission\nsudo chmod 0755 -R /var/www\nsudo chmod g+s /var/www\n\n\nA: As far as I remember, it was enough to set the read flag on the files you want your web server to be able to display and open.\n", "Q: How to Install Lexmark x6650 Driver  (.sh.tar) file  in Ubuntu 11.10 When I connected my printer to my pc, he found drivers & installed them.\nI thought everything would work, but when I did a testpage, the pc acts likes he's doing the job great, but the printer didn't do anything.\nSo I searched on www.lexmark.be & I found (I think) an additional download: \nlexmark-08z-series-driver-1.0-1.i386.deb.sh.tar-1.\nNow it have to be extract, but I don't know where I have to do that.\n(I'm new in Linux!) \n\nA: It is enclosed script (.sh.tar) File , so extract it , by Right-click and Extract option ,\nThen simply double click  the lexmark-08z-series-driver-1.0-1.i386.deb.sh file ,which will provide Options window where you should \nclick the \"Run in Terminal\" button or run the script file via command-line.\nFurther Follow the Instructions if any , asked by installer.\nThey have provided the Official instructions here.

What is the proper way to upgrade Ubuntu chroot environment to a newer Ubuntu release? The chroot environment has been originally set up using debootstrap.\nThe proper way to upgrade a Ubuntu server is to use do-release-upgrade command.\nUbuntu is based on Debian. Debian can be upgraded by replacing the release name in /etc/apt/sources.list with the new release name and running apt-get update, apt-get upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade.\nWhich one is the proper way to upgrade a Ubuntu chroot environment? What does do-release-upgrade do differently from the Debian way?\n\nA: For the most part, do-release-upgrade is a wrapper around dist-upgrade with some additional functionality. As noted, it is the recommended official way to upgrade Ubuntu minimal/server installations. Unofficially, dist-upgrade after changing your sources.list often works just as well. \nThe difference is: using do-release-upgrade is recommended because it has the ability to handle system configuration changes sometimes needed between releases.\nFor an Ubuntu chroot, I suggest you stick with do-release-upgrade unless it keeps failing for some reason. \n\nA: Well do-release-upgrade -d works also. Just download in a terminal: \nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core \n\nand then:  \ndo-release-upgrade.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS graphics problem, booting to  tty Since I upgraded my computer to 12.04 from 11.04 nothing works anymore.\nMy Hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel® Core™2 Duo\n\n*NVIDIA graphics card\nFirst I had Problems running the my old user (I guessed it had something to do wie ID and GID), so I just saved everything and deleted that account.\nBut still everything was running unstable and I figured out it must be because I had Win Vista also running on this computer, so giving Ubuntu another chance I reinstalled EVERYTHING, including deleting all partitions so Ubuntu would be the only OS.\nAnd still everything was running horrible, like the system was very slow, the screen was having little blackouts like (I think all relating to the Graphics card?).

The gnome log should be the best one for you really, as it can be used to quickly filter the logs and find what you want; you can go straight to syslog, for example, and find the Ubuntu system messages and monitor how the system is working in the background with cron, etc. I recommend log viewing (and then researching things) as a great way of learning how the system works.\nTerminal wise, you can watch any open logs in real-time with tail -f <log file> and grep can be very useful to search for words such as 'Machine' 'Hardware' and 'error', which often pop up in faults: for example grep -i 'machine' /var/log/kern.log. With grep it is important to use the i switch to ignore capitalisation, as you can miss important bits of the log without it. To look through a whole folder of logs, you can use grep -ir <folder>. \n\nA: You may want to take a look at LogZilla.

Each USB device type gives a unique ID to the computer so the computer can load the correct driver. If you use a different ID for USB3 then you end up confusing a driver which has a list of ids which this new id isn't in.\nTo fix the issue permanently, the driver must be modified to include the new IDs. This is a problem with Linux (kernel) and should be reported as a bug.\nTo get it working for yourself, you can follow this guide for adding an id to your driver: http://www.ha19.no/usb/ Attempt this only if you're comfortable running the commands.\n", "Q: 12.04 LTS won't boot.

On a remote Linux Mint env, i simply run:\n    mintmenu&\n\nIf you really need it, you can even start the remote graphical environment locally at your Mac's X11, simply running:\n    ubuntu-session\n    xubuntu-session\n    etc... (depends of your remote environment)\n\nBetter than any VNC, even better than an X11VNC connection! Secured and compressed connection FTW.\n\nA: You have the right idea but the wrong syntax :)\nstartx will not start over an ssh like that because it needs a screen (aka X server to talk to)\ntry this command to start the desktop gui\nsudo service gdm start\n\nthis will start the desktop environment.\ndisconnect.\nand try \nssh -X nautilus username@host \n\nnote did not test above line\nIf everything works fine you should see the ubuntu file manager popup.

I have a very low end PC, 512MB, and I'm thinking of switching to ubuntu. But I want the lightest one possible, I did a few searches and came across Lubuntu. Are softwares installable on ubuntu also installable on Lubuntu?\n\nA: Both distributions use the same repositories. So, software that can be installed on ubuntu can also be installed on Lubuntu. At most some extra gnome packages will be installed (this will mostly be taken care of by synaptic or software centre). But with low ram, Lubuntu would give a better peformance. Also be aware of the fact that Lubuntu 12.04 is not an LTS as opposed to ubuntu.\n\nA: Lubuntu and Ubuntu use the same software repositories.\nTake chromium-browser.  You can install it on Ubuntu.  Since Lubuntu shares those repositories, you can install chromium-browser onto Lubuntu.\nNote though that some programs require GNOME runtime libraries, or KDE runtime libraries, and those runtime libraries will also take up space on your drive, as will the program.  These programs may also not work 100% with your hardware, but there's no way to truly tell.\nOne way to find out what other packages would be installed with a package is to simulate its installation first:\napt-get -s install PACKAGE\n\nA: Yes, they both use the same repositories.\n", "Q: How to change shortcuts for moving windows to the screen edges? I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 under gnome-shell. When I press Ctrl-Alt-KP_Left, the active window moves to the left edge of the screen, likewise for right, up, and down. KP_5 maximises/restores the window. (Fascinatingly, moving the window to the left or right at the same time moves it down a bit each time.)\nI don't like that, as it interferes with certain Eclipse shortcuts, but I can't find a place to change these settings. In gconf-editor, I navigated to /apps/metacity/window_keybindings and found that move_to_side_e was set to SuperKP_Left, and so on. I changed all these to disabled, to no avail (I tried logging out an in again.)\nHow can I change these shortcuts?\n\nA: I just came here looking for this in GNOME 3.14, and you can simply change it in Settings (click in the top right-hand corner, and then the tools icon) by going to Keyboard, then the tab \"Shortcuts\", on the left-hand side click \"Windows\" (since we're talking keyboard shortcuts to manage windows) and set them for \"View split on left\" and \"View split on right\". Same for \"Maximize window\".\n\nA: Have a look at Put plugin in CompizConfigSettingsManager, \"Bindings\" tab, \"Put within viewport\" section.\n", "Q: Boss GT-100 on Ubuntu 12.04 I wish to use BOSS GT-100 for recording some sound in Ubuntu 12.04.

I followed these instructions: Boss GT-100 on Linux, but it is still not recognized. What should I do?\n\nA: Support for the Boss GT-100 has been added to the ALSA kernel source two weeks ago (although it contains the very same code as on the page you mentioned), so you may either compile the sources from git or keep on waiting til your distribution adds the new code. It works like a charm for me in Ubuntu 12.04 and Mint Maya.\nErik (from delta-xi.net)\n", "Q: wireshark installation using source code i downloaded wireshark-1.8.0rc2.tar.bz2 and copied it to /opt/wireshark directory and uncompressed it by \nsudo tar -xjvf wireshark-1.8.0rc2.tar.bz2 \nthen by doing ls in the extracted folder, i found the configure file.\nThen i did ./configure then i got this problem:\n  configure: error: I couldn't find yacc (or bison or ...); \n    make sure it's installed and in your path.\n\nhow to fix it?\n\nA: Wireshark is available in the software repositories. Try running sudo apt-get install wireshark in the terminal (ctrl+alt+t) to install it with the dependencies you were missing. Although, you might need to enable the universe repositories.\nQuestion for you though...\nIs there a specific reason you're trying to build from source ?\n\nA: The correct answer is you seeking is \nsudo apt-get install bison\n\nwhich already alfonso.ss mentioned. But reason for adding another answer is because although you fulfill this dependencies you will face another dependency errors. Such as qt errors etc. To avoid all the dependencies, I suggest you to run below command.\n\nsudo apt-get install bison flex libpcap-dev qt5-default qttools5-dev\n  libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev\n\nAfter this you will get no other dependency error.\nrefer below link for further details\nhttps://menukablog.wordpress.com/2016/02/29/install-wireshark-using-source-code-in-ubuntu/\n\nA: In 2020, I had to install the following on Ubuntu 18.04 to build Wireshark 3.2.4\napt install libgcrypt20-dev \napt install lex\napt install bison\napt install flex libpcap-dev \napt install libpcap-dev\napt install pcaputils \napt install libssh-gcrypt-dev   # Or libssh-dev ? (not both)\napt install bison flex \napt install libpcap-dev\napt install qt5-default qttools5-dev libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev\napt install libqt5opengl5-dev \napt install qtmultimedia5-dev \napt install libqt5svg5-dev \n\nbased on various research...\n\nA: In case someone runs into this in the future: you can just sudo apt-get install bison\nBison will provide yacc to Wireshark via update-alternatives: using /usr/bin/bison.yacc to provide /usr/bin/yacc (yacc) in auto mode\nAlso, if you install Bison, you'll also need sudo apt-get install flex since it will ask for it afterwards. And while you're at it, you should sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev too, since it will probably need pcap.h, and it comes in the -dev package, not the regular one.\nAfter this, it should be the usual make, wait... and then make install and you're done. Depending on your specs, the wait part might be 5 minutes, just to build the parlay package.\n\nA: For anyone looking at this now, qt is no longer in apt/apt-get sources by default, so you'll need to build it yourself.\nhttps://wiki.qt.io/Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu says:\n\n. . . due to policy change, distributing Open Source Qt linux package is discontinue from 5.15.0. You need to build your own package starting from 5.15.0.\n\nYou can find the build instructions for Qt5 here: https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_5_from_Git\n", "Q: What's the preferred workaround until /etc/rc.local bug is fixed? I have some commands that I need to run at startup. I wanted to put them in /etc/rc.local but this doesn't work (bug report).\nI've seen a number of different workarounds and I'm sure they all work, but I'm wondering if there is a preferred or even best way to do it? I mean one that might avoid potential complications, or one that may be considered to be best practice in such a situation?\nI'm using Linux for business purposes (since Windows died on me yesterday). I'm keen to avoid causing more issues than I am fixing. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You should still use /etc/rc.local unless you yourself can confirm that rc.local isnt working.\nAfter consulting with micahg (IRC user) who is on bugsquad and bugcontrol, we've confirmed that /etc/rc.local runs as expected behavior is on 12.04.  As the bug you mentioned is \"Incomplete\", it is likely an edge-case bug and not a bug that is confirmable.\n\nWhat I would have put on a comment on that bug (but did not after talking with micahg) is this (note that a bunch of it is context-specific for the bug)\n\nrc.local does indeed boot on a clean 12.04 installation.  I have\n  confirmed that rc.local does correctly work, after numerous changes to\n  the file and numerous reboots.\nI have 30 different commands which activate or deactivate certain\n  services, and run specific services that are not in /etc/init.d/ or\n  upstart.  Each and every one of those commands has correctly run (just\n  tested) on a clean 12.04 installation.  \nSince /etc/rc.local requires superuser to edit, i do not think its\n  getting overwritten or overridden by the desktop, except in certain\n  circumstances where a graphics driver is taking over settings (or a\n  GUI taking over settings for instance for backlight or screen\n  brightness on laptops, which I tend to see happen when a proprietary\n  graphics card's drivers and software are used), in which case\n  /etc/rc.local is most likely being run, but the GUI and relevant software starting\n  afterwards is running additional commands and directives post-rc.local runtime.\nThis needs additional testing with numerous different command\n  combinations, but expected behaviour of rc.local is indeed occurring\n  on standard 12.04 and 11.04 tests I have run.\n\n\nA: I realize this an old post....But this is what helped be with automatically mounting windows shares in a ubuntu vitualbox.

And how we can define to firefox only start after the network is up?\n\nA: Although I'm unsure if all these existed in the 10.04 version of Ubuntu, I'm putting this answer here in case it does and also so it can be used for newer releases. You can use upstart to start a GUI application when a user logs in and have it require that networking is up first.\nRun a GUI application\nenv DISPLAY=:0.0\nexec /usr/bin/firefox\n\nRun when a user logs in\n\n\n*\n\n*This makes use of D-Bus Service Activation.\n\n*Add \"UpstartJob=true\" to file \"/usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.service\".\n\n*Create a job configuration file corresponding to the D-Bus service, say /etc/init/user-login.conf [12]:\nstart on dbus-activation org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit\nexec /usr/sbin/console-kit-daemon --no-daemon\n\n\n*Ensure that the D-Bus daemon (\"dbus-daemon\") is started with the --activation=upstart option (see /etc/init/dbus.conf).\nNow, when a user logs in, D-Bus will emit the dbus-activation event, specifying the D-Bus service started. You can now create other jobs that start on user-login.\nDepend on another service\nstart on (started networking and user-login)\n\nBy combining these three things in an upstart job, you can start Firefox when a user logs in and the network is started (although you may want to specify which interface is up)\n", "Q: How to re-enable a disabled standard user account? Disabled a standard user account but did not opt to delete files. Later, tried to enable the account. At that time, a password had to be selected so entered a different one from the earlier one. Now, at the log-in screen the user account appears but cannot log in using the new password or the old password. Tried many tricks but still could not let the user log into the account.\n\nThe tricks: \n\n\n*\n\n*Tried to find some command in 'lightdm' package to modify the user account. Couldn't solve the problem. {Ex. /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf}\n\n*Removed the package 'apparmor' suspecting it is causing the problem. It didn't solve the problem.\n\n*Installed some packages from Synaptic, relevant to user accounts. No luck.\n\n*Browsed in system folders such as 'var', 'etc', 'bin', 'root' and many others, to find a clue so that the user account can be re-enabled. No way!\n\n*From System Settings, selected auto log-in without password. Even then the user still can't log in. \nRunnng sudo passwd USERNAME in terminal takes me to the log in screen. Hope these details would be of help. Still trying to solve the issue.\nWell, finally I decided to delete that user and recreate a new user account with a slightly different name. Most files which had been backed up could be restored, although some were lost. All users should be asked to back up whatever files which are important using a tool such as Deja Dup. So in case of an issue like this, even if the user account gets deleted one can still recover the files. \n\nA: You said you \"tried many tricks.\" What did you try, exactly?\nDid you try changing the user's password with sudo passwd USERNAME?

While this controller fully supports the USB 3.0 standard in theory and should work well with the default xhci USB 3.0 driver in Linux, it does not. In fact, there is a well-documented history of the VL800 not working, [working at low speeds](, crashing your kernel, etc.\nThis is not Ubuntu/Linux's fault, but the manufacturer's (VIA) for making a poorly-supported non-compliant product.\nSolution: try a newer kernel, or use a different Logilink USB 3.0 card with the NEC chipset\nYou have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can try a newer (beta) Ubuntu kernel, hoping the that workarounds for the VL800 have been added, thus improving support.\n\n\n*\n\n*But this may cause problems with your other hardware, notably Nvidia/AMD graphics and wireless -- see warnings/general information here\n\n*If you want to do this, look at this answer for hints, or Google/search AskUbuntu.com on how to install the newer kernels.\n\n\n*Simply get another card with better Linux support\n\n\n*\n\n*Logilink also makes a 2-port PCI-Express USB 3.0 card which uses the NEC USB 3.0 chipset that has excellent support in Linux/Ubuntu (it was the first USB 3.0 chipset to come out and the company played an important role in drafting the USB 3.0 standard).\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I would certainly consider replacing your card with this one instead of messing about with mainline/beta kernels.\n\n\n\nA: You can use NEC chipset, the 3rd generation D720201, and this PCIe to USB 3.0 card with 20pin connector.\n\nA: I had the same problem and more...\nI had a \"xHCI Root Hub\" not recognized in my Device Manager and it caused problems even on my USB 2.0 ports.\nMy specific problematic card was the \"TECKNET \"Eu308d\" USB 3.0, 5 ports PCI-E Expansion Card\".\nAfter hours of researches, tens of attempts of different kinds:  updates of my Intel DZ77GA-70K motherboard, USB drivers, Windows ans system diagnosis tools and much more, \"ORICO \"PVU3-5O2I-V1\" USB 3.0, 5 ports PCI-E Expansion Card\" saved my life !\nMarvell USB drivers didn't worked.

Preferable using GUI interface. Thanks!\n\nA: My suggestion would be rsync. Something like:\nrsync -avu --delete /source /backup \n\nshould take care of the local backup. This can be easily automated using cron, for instance, you could put a file in /etc/cron.daily containing this to run a daily backup:\nrsync -avu --delete /source /backup | mail -s \"backup report\" you@somewhere.com\n\nYou can get a lot of information on rsync in the man page (man rsync).\nAs for ftp, I'm afraid the protocol doesn't lend itself too well to what you want; for instance, determining if a remote file is the same as a local one is not too reliable, so you may have to resync everything every time you back up. That said, you could look at wget, with which you can mirror an ftp site like this:\nwget -m ftp://user:password@host.com\n\nI realize these are not GUI utilities; sorry, I'm a command-line guy.

I downloaded the Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop iso and I'm trying to burn it to a disc to install onto a Windows Vista Laptop but it keeps giving me an error saying that It couldn't be burned properly because there are \"no mountable file systems\"\nAnybody know what to do to fix this issue?\n\nA: Please note: This is for OS X Lion users only\nThe easiest way to burn an ISO, the file you need to install Ubuntu from a CD, is by using Disk Utility. If you’re using an older version of Mac OS X, you might not have the Disk Utility application. In this case, use Disk Copy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch 'Disk Utility' (Applications → Utilities → Disk Utility).\n\n*Insert your blank CD/DVD.\n\n*Drag and drop your .iso file to the left pane in Disk Utility. Now both the blank disc and the .iso should be listed.\n\n*Select the .iso file, and click on the 'Burn' button in the toolbar.\n\n*Ensure that the 'Verify burned data' checkbox is ticked (you may need to click on the disclosure triangle to see the checkbox).\n\n*Click 'Burn'. The data will be burned and verified.\n\n\nInfo collected from here\nPlease note: This is for OS X Lion users only, this no longer works the same way on OS X El Capitan. (This note is in case you've updated from Lion. I'll update this when I find the solution if someone else doesn't chime in sooner)\n\nA: As masterninja points out, the hybrid iso from Ubuntu is the issue for OSX Lion.  You can create a readable version with the following steps:\nOpen the problem ISO in disk utility.  This will mount a device, whose name is listed below the iso name on the left sidebar.  It will probably be disk3s0.  \nRun this command in terminal, replacing /dev/disk3s0 with /dev/YOURISONAME if it does not match the mounted name from disk utility:\ndd if=/dev/disk3s0 of=./ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64-extracted.iso bs=1m\n\nNow you have a Lion compatible iso file to use as you expected to be able to do in the first place.  \nThanks to this guy from youtube, I've just transcribed what he related in his video, which walks you through it if you need additional help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld7UVefOvHo\n\nA: Due to the hybrid iso Ubuntu is putting out lately, here is a better solution for burning an iso from a Mac - \"burn dvd from iso\" article\nI was getting an error saying there was no mountable filesystem from the iso, but the hint helped eith my problem and others havign the same one.

Running Xubuntu 12.04 on a netbook (Lenovo S10), the lightdm process which runs in the background takes up constantly a precious 12% of the CPU. Besides, this consumes a considerable amount of energy, and the battery life already isn't that good.\nThe process I am referring to is shown in htop as this command:\n    /usr/bin/X :0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -nolisten tcp vt7 -novtswitch -background none\n\nWhy is this process necessary? Is there a way to reduce its processor usage?\n\nA: \n/usr/bin/X :0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0...\n\nThat isn't lightdm, but the X server which is essential to having a GUI on any Linux.\nIt shouldn't constantly use 12% of CPU, but CPU use should go up and down depending on the amount of \"activity\" that you are performing on your desktop.\nTo try the options suggested by @drake01's eHow Link, you must create a new file in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-mycputweaks.conf\n\n*Insert:\n\nSection \"Screen\"\nOption \"RenderAccel\" \"True\"\nOption \"DisableGLXRootClipping\" \"True\"\nOption \"DamageEvents\" \"True\"\nOption \"UseEvents\" \"True\"\nEndSection\n\n\n*Save, exit and reboot (or restart X from a virtual terminal).\n\n\nYou may also want to try Jupiter, a power-management applet designed specially for netbooks to try to improve your battery life. (available from PPA).\n\nA: Old thread, I know, but I got a serious issue with high cpu usage coming from /usr/bin/X :0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -nolisten tcp vt7 -novtswitch -background none that led to an unbearable desktop performance (on a desktop computer).\nNo attempt to solve this was successful (new video driver, new kernel, xorg.conf edit,... even a fresh install)!\nBUT: The reason for high cpu usage was that the PCI-network card and the video card used the same IRQ. There was a line in /var/log/syslog that said \"Disabling IRQ #16\". After checking /proc/interrupts I saw that both nvidia (video card) and eth0 (NIC) were on the same interrupt (in my case IRQ #16).\nSo, what I did was just to put my network card into another PCI-slot. Done.\nThis thread http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/disabling-irq-16-a-879964/page3.html brought the solution.\nI hope this helps someone!\n\nA: X server has to run over the linux kernel to provide support for GUI i.e. for xfce in xubuntu, gnome in ubuntu, kde in kubuntu etc. So it has to run all the time while you have a gui running.\nI personally never faced the high X-server cpu usage on working machines, but a web search returns the link: http://www.ehow.com/how_7609862_reduce-cpu-usage-xorg.html See if it helps.\n", "Q: Move all files in several folders So I unzipped a file with 1000+ folders, is there a way to \"flatten\" these folders? As in, grab all the contents from every folder and dump them into another directory. \n\nA: The easiest way is when you unzip them. If you uncheck the \"preserve paths\" option (it may have a different name in your zip tool), the folder structure will be ignored during the unzip process, and everything will get put into one folder.\nFor unzip this would be the option -j to junk paths:\nunzip -j archive.zip\n\nEdit: I must share credit for the correct answer with Takkat. The first paragraph was my answer, but the next two lines were Takkat's. \n\nA: If you already unzipped the files (and folders) try this:\nFirst open a terminal, and change directory to the folder where you wish the files to be dropped. \ncd path_to_folder\n\nThen drop this in the same terminal:\nfind PATHtoWHEREtheFILESare -type f -exec mv -iv \\{} . \\;\n\nThis will recursively move everything in the PATHtoWHEREtheFILESare (you must provide a full path folder's name) into the current folder.\nGood luck!\n\nA: If you know the file type of the folder its easy. File type means file extension. \n\nFile extension: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, mp3, ogg, avi, mkv, exe, bin, deb, sh and many more. Its usually last few letter of a file after .yyy.\n\nLet assume you have One folder..... \nNamed A which have 1000+ folder and all are full of .jpg file. \nYou can grub all jpg at once...for that open folder A and click on search (It's up side of the window). Type your file type .jpg in the search box and press Enter . It will find all jpg from all sub folder. Then you can simply select all file by pressing Ctrl+a and cut/copy.

Can it be done?\n\nA: Executive summary: Yes, you can do this, but it will not work very well, because the drive probably doesn't support Unix-style permissions.\nYou can make your home directory exist on a remote filesystem rather than the local computer. (If you do that, you might want to have another user account, to use for troubleshooting if a problem develops with the remote share.)\nHowever, to work properly, home directories should be on volumes that support Unix-style file permissions. Your router probably uses SMB/CIFS to share the drive. Such permissions can be exposed well enough through Samba, so if you're using SMB/CIFS (Windows file sharing) to share a drive that is formatted with a Unix-style filesystem, this can work (though your router would likely be incapable of that).\nThe drive probably does not have a Unix-style filesystem. It probably has NTFS, FAT32, exFAT, or (if it's quite small), FAT16. The FAT filesystems don't support any system of permissions at all. NTFS supports permissions, but it's a different system from Unix-style permissions.\nSo yes, you can do this. You can edit /etc/fstab and put either /home or the specific home directory in /home as a mount point to the networks share. But since the volume being shared probably does not support the permissions needed for files inside an Ubuntu home directory, you probably should not do this.\nA better approach may be to make certain folders inside your home directory (like Videos, Pictures, Documents, Downloads, and even Desktop) symbolic links to folders in the network share. (Any folder that contains programs or scripts you want to execute should not be, though, as it wouldn't be able to have execute permissions.)\n", "Q: How do I set the framebuffer resolution for NVIDIA on 12.04?

I'm interested in compiling a new kernel under Ubuntu 12.04 x86 64 bit.\nI found this wiki page which is basically a mirror for this blog and there are a lot of steps (git, etc.) that appear useless to me.\nWith earlier releases/distros, I used to create a .config file and modify a Makefile if I needed to, then just run make and it's done.\nIs there is a simple way to do this under Ubuntu?\n\nA: 1. Use apt-get source to download the Ubuntu version of the kernel\napt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\ngives a folder that contains, for example:\n\nlinux-3.2.0                linux_3.2.0-26.41.dsc\nlinux_3.2.0-26.41.diff.gz  linux_3.2.0.orig.tar.gz\n\nThe bolded diff includes all the Ubuntu/Debian customizations.\n2. To build a stock kernel with your own .config, use the \"old-fashioned\" Debian make-kpkg method\nThis is the alternate old-fashioned way described in the wiki:\nsudo apt-get install kernel-package\n\nIf you are compiling a kernel for the first time:\nsudo apt-get build-dep linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\nThen cd into the source directory (here, linux-3.2.0), and either run make oldconfig to create .config file with your running kernel's configuration, or copy a third-part .config to this directory.\nDepending on whether you want a text or graphical config, install:\n(Text)\nsudo apt-get install libncurses5 libncurses5-dev\n\n(Graphical)\nsudo apt-get install qt3-dev-tools libqt3-mt-dev\n\nAnd then run:\n(Text)\nmake menuconfig\n\n(Graphical)\nmake xconfig\n\nWhen done, just run:\nfakeroot make-kpkg -j N --initrd --append-to-version=my-very-own-kernel kernel-image kernel-headers\n\nwhere N is how many jobs to run in parallel (usually the number of CPUs you have), and my-very-own-kernel is a custom string to identify this build.\nWhen done, the kernel image and header files will be ready as debs in the parent directory; you can install them with sudo dpkg -i, which will also take care of adding GRUB entries, etc.\n\nA: The quick instructions for building an Ubuntu kernel (as opposed to vanilla) can be found here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel.\nI won't copy the whole wiki, but I'll list the minimal steps to compile the version of the Ubuntu kernel that you currently have installed. (To get the most recent version, clone the kernel git repository of the upcoming Ubuntu release.) Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.\n# Get source code\napt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\n# Install dependencies\nsudo apt-get build-dep linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\n# Compile\ncd linux-4.4.0\nfakeroot debian/rules clean\nfakeroot debian/rules binary\n\n# Install (obviously the versions will be different)\ncd ..\nsudo dpkg -i linux-image-4.4.0-38-generic_4.4.0-38.57_amd64.deb linux-headers-4.4.0-38_4.4.0-38.57_all.deb linux-headers-4.4.0-38-generic_4.4.0-38.57_amd64.deb\n\n\nA: Here are the steps. This procedure is based on nixCraft's How to: Compile Linux kernel 2.6--but modernized considerably.\nDownload and extract the source code of the kernel you wish to build.\nYou can get upstream kernel source code at kernel.org. Version 3.16.1 (the latest stable kernel as of this writing) will be used here. So you may need to modify these commands if you're using a different version.\nKernel source code is currently provided in .tar.xz archives, so click the \"tar.xz\" link by whatever version you want:\n\nAfter cding to the directory where you downloaded the archive, you can extract it with tar:\ntar xf linux-3.16.1.tar.xz\n\nInstall the necessary build tools and perform kernel configuration.\nTo get Ubuntu's toolchain (gcc, make, and so forth) install the build-essential  metapackage:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nTwo reasonably user-friendly ways to configure what goes into your kernel are provided by the make targets xconfig and menuconfig.\nxconfig runs a graphical configuration utility, while menuconfig is text-based (i.e., its interface appears fully within your terminal). Each requires some additional software not provided by build-essential .\nTo configure graphically, install libqt4-dev  and pkg-config  and run make xconfig:\nsudo apt-get install libqt4-dev pkg-config\nmake xconfig\n\nTo configure in the terminal, install libncurses5-dev (thanks to Hannu for this info) and run make menuconfig:\nsudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev\nmake menuconfig\n\nBuild the configured kernel.\nFirst run this to compile the kernel and create vmlinuz:\nmake\n\nvmlinuz is \"the kernel.\" Specifically, it is the kernel image that will be uncompressed and loaded into memory by GRUB or whatever other boot loader you use.\nThen build the loadable kernel modules:\nmake modules\n\nInstall your newly built kernel.\nAssuming those make commands completed successfully, it's time to install the new kernel. First install the modules:\nsudo make modules_install\n\nThen install the kernel itself:\nsudo make install\n\nThat puts vmlinuz-3.16.1 (a copy of vmlinuz), config-3.16.1 (a text file storing kernel configuration parameters), and System.map-3.16.1 (the kernel symbol lookup table) in /boot. For more details, see this comp.os.linux.misc post by Hadron and man installkernel.\nFinal setup, so the kernel can be started and boot the system:\nThis section is partly based on information in Kernel/Compile.\nWith the kernel now where it needs to be, it needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*an entry in the boot loader's configuration, so you can select and boot from it.\n\n*an initial RAM filesystem, the environment from which the kernel loads drivers and mounts the / filesystem.\n(If you're installing an old kernel or have configured your kernel to use devfs instead of the newer udev, you may need or wish to set up an initial ramdisk instead. If you know you need that instead, see man initrd.)\nGenerate your initramfs with mkinitramfs:\ncd /boot\nsudo mkinitramfs -ko initrd.img-3.16.1 3.16.1\n\nWhen you update the configuration of the GRUB2 boot loader--which has been the default in Ubuntu since 9.10--should automatically detect the new kernel and add an option to boot from it.\nsudo update-grub\n\nTry your kernel.\nNow you can reboot to test out your new kernel. You may need to hold down Shift or press Esc during boot to see the GRUB boot menu where you can select between the different kernels that are installed.\nTo make your kernel (or another one) the default, see How do I change the GRUB boot order?\n\nA: Ubuntu git kernel repository\nFollowing ideas from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile and with greater clarification of why I think that config look correct at Where can I get the 11.04 kernel .config file?:\ngit clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-bionic.git linux\ncd linux\ngit checkout Ubuntu-4.15.0-36.39\nfakeroot debian/rules clean\ndebian/rules updateconfigs\nfakeroot debian/rules build-generic\ncp debian/build/build-generic/.config .\nmake -j `nproc`\n\nTested in Ubuntu 18.04.\n", "Q: Installation from USB stick on UEFI-based system How can I install Ubuntu from USB stick on a UEFI-based x86-64 system? \nDocumentation for this topic doesn't look very friendly.\n\nA: Did you take a look at the threads at ubuntuforum.org?\nFor example: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2015019\nThere is also answers here on Ask Ubuntu for previous versions of Ubuntu: How to boot Ubuntu from EFI/UEFI?\nNot that I know anything about this topic, I just did a google search for you.\n", "Q: Which device drivers are built into the kernel? I recently installed a vendor supplied embedded linux onto a hardware device. When I ran lsmod on the device command line the response was empty. I was lead to believe that this means that the drivers for the hardware running on the device had been built into the kernel rather than as .ko files. My question is this: how does this process happen? \nIs support for popular hardware gradually integrated into the kernel in subsequent versions thus replacing the .ko files? Is the .ko file simply used to support new hardware that doesn't have kernel integrated driver support at the time of release? In my limited knowledge I thought that all hardware drivers were of the form of .ko files but clearly this is wrong. \nI am slightly confused by the whole process and would be grateful for clarification as I have a feeling that I may be looking at the situation the wrong way.\n\nA: When compiling a kernel, you get to configure which components are installed.  Not only that, but you get to chose whether or not they are built into the kernel or if they are a module.\nFor example, many people use the ext2 filesystem on their /boot partition.  Because of this, the kernel must be able to read ext2 filesystems at boot time.  In order to accomplish this, the ext2 module is built into the kernel itself.\nNow, imagine the quantity of modules available.  It wouldn't make sense to have them all built into your kernel, would it?  This is why you can build these as separate .ko modules and load them at will.\n\nA: Core drivers that are considered critical to the loading of the kernel are usually built into the kernel, while other hardware drivers, etc. are built as modules or .ko files.\nThe .ko modules are usually stored under the /lib directory on your root partition. To use any of these, the kernel must first be able to detect and access the underlying storage device and then access its filesystem. So it's safe to assume that a kernel without SATA/SCSI and ext2/3/4 support built-into it won't really boot ;)\nYou can choose to switch most built-in kernel drivers into module form. The Ubuntu kernel team decides whether to modify the Linux kernel team's default configuration and include/exclude additional built-in drivers for the stock kernel images you download.\nIf you build your own kernel, you can do the same:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In the above screenshot, the * indicates a built-in driver, while M indicates a module.\n\n*Loopback device support, which is often essential to booting a system, is built-in by default.\n\n*The low-speed USB driver (USB 1.0) is also built-in by default to allow you to boot off a USB stick, but here I have changed it into a module.\n\n\nA: These depends on how you have configured your build of the linux kernel.\nWithin a compilation process you usually can:\n\n\n*\n\n*compile the kernel with or without module support ( often it comes with module support )\n\n*compile a driver as module or as a built-in piece of software right into the kernel\n\n\nto understand what a .ko file is for https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10476990/difference-between-o-and-ko-file\nThe reason why you have an empty output on lsmod is because you have a monolithic kernel.\nA quick way for listing all your modules ( if they are present ) is by running this command\nfind /lib/modules/*/ -type f -iname '*.ko' | less\n\nnotice the use of less, you can use every pager that you want or redirect the output where you want to.\n\nA: See the contents of file /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.builtin\ne.g. to search for a specific module\ngrep <module> /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.builtin\n\nDocumentation/kbuild/kbuild.txt\nmodules.builtin\n--------------------------------------------------\nThis file lists all modules that are built into the kernel.

I upgraded from Ubuntu 11.10 to 12.04 today and on restart I got a different black Grub screen instead of the usual purple one. (GNU GRUB version 1.99-21ubuntu3.1) Each boot option only returns error messages. \n\nerror: no such partition.\n\nI read on some other posts that I should make a live CD and boot there to use the boot repair tool but my laptop wont boot from the disk.\nI have changed the BIOS setting so that boot from disk is first and also tried telling it to boot from CD in the Startup Menu. Each time I restart however the CD drive starts to run and then the Grub menu appears.\nThe CD runs fine on another laptop and is the correct 64bit version.\n\nA: The fact that the grub menu appears means that your notebook can't boot from this CD. \nThere are some reasons to be taken into account.\n1.) Clean the Lens of your CD/DVD-Reader.\n2.) Try to boot from other bootable CD's/DVD's. Do they all fail?\n3.)

Everything the function outputs gets taken literally. I suggest going about it a different way.\nFirst off, what the prompt tries to do, is check if you're in a git tree, and if so, add a colored (branch) to the prompt. Instead of checking everytime the prompt is printed, you really only need to do that check whenever you change directory, so we can override the only three commands that can change directory to set the variable git_branch to the name of the current branch, if any.\ncd() {\n    builtin cd \"$@\" || return\n    git_branch=$(git branch 2>/dev/null|sed -n '/^[*] /s///p') || true\n}\npushd() {\n    builtin pushd \"$@\" || return\n    git_branch=$(git branch 2>/dev/null|sed -n '/^[*] /s///p') || true\n}\npopd() {\n    builtin popd \"$@\" || return\n    git_branch=$(git branch 2>/dev/null|sed -n '/^[*] /s///p') || true\n}\n\nNext up, check if stderr is a terminal, and set colors with tput\nuser_color= dir_color= git_color= reset=\nif [[ -t 2 ]]; then\n    user_color=$(tput setaf 2; tput bold)\n    dir_color=$(tput setaf 4; tput bold)\n    reset=$(tput sgr0)\nfi\n\nAnd a function that outputs one of two colors based on whether there are changes or not\n_git_color() {\n    [[ $git_branch && -t 2 ]] || return\n    if git diff --quiet >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n        tput setaf 1\n    else\n        tput setaf 3\n    fi\n}\n\nNow, putting the prompt together. This is a bit cumbersome as some variables should be expanded at assignment (now), while some should be expanded when the prompt is printed, so we need to alternate quotes, plus it gets rather long. Using an array for this should help keep the overview\nprompt=(\n    \"\\[$user_color\\]\" '\\u@\\h' \"\\[$reset\\]\"\n    : \"\\[$dir_color\\]\" '\\w' \"\\[$reset\\]\"\n\n    '${git_branch:+ (}'\n    '\\[$(_git_color)\\]' '$git_branch' \"\\[$reset\\]\"  \n    '${git_branch:+)}'\n\n    '\\$ '\n)\n\nI ommited the debian_chroot stuff here, I've never needed it myself, you can of course add that if you want. Finally, join the prompt array and clean up the variables we no longer need.\nprintf -v PS1 %s \"${prompt[@]}\"\nunset user_color dir_color reset prompt\n\n", "Q: Why can't I install from PPAs? just new in using ubuntu, just installed it last night.

While I can view our 2 Terabyte, shared hard-drive in the lounge (and copy files back and forth) I can't see my PC (when I boot up in Ubuntu 12.04) nor the Lubuntu computer connected to the TV (for movies, Youtube etc).\nPrinting to the HP office jet on the PC doesnt work over the network either.\nHave had one dubious flirtation with Samba, which seems to be the only thing I've found that will 'work', however halfway through that \"installation\" everything just ground to a halt, the directions began to stop making sense...\nI was working from this page.\nOur Network consists of the following:\nOur Internet service is wirelessly sent to us from our provider to our dish on a pole.\nIt comes into the house via an ethernet cable.\nWe split it there to a phone, and to 6 other destinations (bedrooms, computers, and to another splitter in the lounge which has a wifi antennae and 4 ethernet ports).\n\n\n*\n\n*one port goes to the Lubuntu OS PC which is connected to the TV\n\n*the second port goes to the 2 Terabyte harddrive (MS powered 'Mybooklive')\n\n*(the other two are empty)\n\n\nMy Ubuntu 12.04 laptop connects wirelessly to this splitter in the lounge.\nI know just enough about computers to get myself into an awful mess without too much trouble\nWe usually can view friends' laptops when they get on our network (as they are invariably MS OS's) Our flatmate, who introduced us to Linux's computer is also invisible\nHow can we make our Linux OS based computers visible on the network and share files and printing?\n\nA: Your are right for using samba if you have multiple os on your network. So that Ubuntu can share files create a share folder, right click it and hit the sharing option. Tick all the boxes you desire for the share and you should be prompted to install samba unless it's installed already. When all is complete the folder will have a left and right arrow on it. This folder is now shared. In your file manager on the left menu you will see the word network click this and then you should see windows share folder. Inside that folder you should see your computer and the shared folder inside. Samba is working at this point. \nPrinting is best controlled by Ubuntu.

You can of course just access the camera and drag and drop material to your home folder, but some photos need to be rotated after import and gthumb can do that; however, I uncheck the setting 'rotate photos physically' on import, as I find it works properly only if I import them and then select the ones to be transformed. (You do this from the menu: tools: rotate physically.) This seems to be the way to get the EXIF orientation correct. The 'physical' transformation is important because it is lossless, and if jpgs are modified they can lose quality.\nAlso, you can't add things back onto the card with gthumb; depending on how your camera is recognised (as a digital camera or usb mass storage device), you may need to take the card out and put it in a card reader to do this. However, on the menu of some cameras you can select whether it will be seen as a usb device or camera when connected to a PC.\nYou mention drivers- actually gphoto2 is the service that helps digital cameras be recognised and mounted in Unix; it will be running as default as it is used by other photo apps as well. There is a list of supported cameras at gphoto.org.\nHowever, even if yours is not listed it should still work. \nIf you don't like gthumb, try Digikam for KDE, even though it means you'll need to install some of the KDE desktop files.\n", "Q: How can I remove linux from a laptop Recently, I installed linux on my dad's computer, but now he wants it removed.

I installed all of the most recent updates, installed some software as well as the latest amd graphics driver 12.6. Everything worked perfectly, I had rebooted the system several times switching back and forth between windows 7. The issue began when I installed Cube 2: Sauerbraten. The game played nicely until I changed to fullscreen, then the resolution changed to 640x480, even though I set it to 1920X1080.

I finally reboot the computer but now immediately after the bios I see the grub menu where I have the option of booting kernel 3.2 the 3.2 recovery mode and windows 7. Chosing to boot kernel 3.2 sends me back to the blue screen, but the recovery does work and shows the usual options.

Another problem I have is that even though I updated my Flash, some videos say that my Flash isn't updated.\nI know Flash is pretty rubbish in Linux and OSX. Is there any alternative for Flash? Is Gnash any good? Is it still supported and developed? Please help.\n\nA: For alternatives as you said, there's Gnash and Lightspark.\nTo install open Terminal (Press Ctrl+Alt+T) and copy the following commands in the Terminal:\nFor \"Official PPA of the Lightspark project\":\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:sparkers/ppa\n\nor for \"Automated daily builds from ustream git master\":\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:sparkers/daily\n\nInstallation:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lightspark browser-plugin-lightspark\n\nClick here for instructions on using PPAs.\nNOTE - Update for Ubuntu 15.04, using Lightspark Version 0.7.2-6 (The above PPA repository does not appear to be working in Ubuntu 15.04)\nLightspark 0.7.2-6 deb package can be installed directly via the software centre, which is invoked by clicking the \"Install Using Apt\" button on the following web page: \nhttp://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/core/vivid/universe/base/browser-plugin-lightspark\n\nA: Depending on what you use Flash for. If you only need it for Youtube and a few well known sites you can use the addon FlashVideoReplacer for Firefox, or the Greasemonkey script Linterna Mágica. LM works on many sites and also on Chrome and Opera in additional to Firefox, though I notice that if Flash is installed it doesn't work on Firefox (Flash player will load while LM is loading, so you have two instances of the video). Also LM doesn't work on Youtube if you use Chrome (it used to, it just stopped working a few days ago)\nFor Youtube you also have other options like Minitube or SMPlayer (install from rvm's PPA, the new versions have a Youtube viewer)\nI have played with Gnash and Lightspark on different distros and different machines. My conclusion is that they are complete waste of time. They never work except for a few demos. I see people recommending them on many Linux sites, either they have better experience somehow or these guys have never tried it themselves.\n\nA: Although Gnash is preffered, you also have Lightspark.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:sssup/sssup-ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install lightspark\n\nNote: Lightspark requires Adobe Flash removed before installation.\nBetter still, use Google Chrome.

The scenario: At work I have to shred data on old PCs (not my main responsibility). What I do is I boot from the Live-CD, choose Try Ubuntu, open the terminal and sudo shred -v -n10 /dev/sda. This way the whole thing takes about five minutes and then I let it run until my shift ends.\nSometimes I have over 20 PC's a day so I would like to skip the CD burning/changing. Also some of the DVD drives don't work. USB's aren't really a solution, I cannot request 25 USB sticks.\nIs there a way to boot (not install, same thing like TRY UBUNTU WITHOUT INSTALLING) from network a.k.a. PXE? My vision is to setup a PXE server, connect it to a 24 port switch and attach the clients to the switch.\nI managed to setup a PXE server to install Windows or Ubuntu, but what I really need is to be able to just boot the try-ubuntu-method over the network. Full install takes too long and is unnecessary.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Do you just need to shred the data and then dispose of the computers or are the hard drives needed after shredding? \nIf so, you could take the HDDs out of the case and buy some USB to SCSI/SATA connectors, a USB hub and then delete the data on the HDDs. After this, you can dispose of the HDDs the normal way (junkyard) or build them into the case again.\nAs far as I know it would be very time-consuming to boot Ubuntu via Network. So I would try to take a normal PC, install Ubuntu on it, connect all HDDs to the PC (via above mentioned method), erase the data and then do whatever you want with the HDDs. \nHope this was a helpful answer for you.\nPS: Here, here and there you can find some other guides.\n\nA: I'm sure you've figured out by now how to install a PXE system.  I want to suggest you use DamnSmallLinux instead of Ubuntu, because it is a really tiny distro, and should take less time to set up on your server.\nAlso, why not use a command-line only linux distro on the server?  That should take even less time to boot, and you could probably set it up so that it boots, then performs the shred automatically.\n\nA: So, I just tried my yesterdays setup with the PLOPLINUX guide to PXE boot. Everything is working how I wanted to. I just PXE-booted a PC into the CLI of PLOTLINUX, hit sudo shred -vf\" and the shreding started wohooo... \nThe guide on their page is pretty good, it's clear, no unnecessery info and I think if I just change the ISO(but leave the name) from whitch it is booting, it might also boot other linux dists.\n\nA: Have a look at DBAN (www.dban.org). It's a bootable iso, and trivial to adapt for PXE. Just don't mess up the dhcp hostlist or you end up shredding the whole LAN :D\n", "Q: Fixing 800x600 resolution in Toshiba NB510 (GMA 3650) with vesa driver After installing Ubuntu 12.04 on a Toshiba NB510 the screen resolution is 800x600 instead of the native 1024x600. This is a netbook that contains the infamous GMA3650 (aka PowerVR SGX5450) which is poorly supported by the Linux kernel. I've looked around and tried several different solutions. Namely:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried installing a newer kernel (3.3+), since some people have reported success with it. That didn't seem to fix the resolution problem.\n\n*I've tried installing an older version of Ubuntu (10.04), since someone suggested there's an older driver that should provide basic support for the card, but the liveCD image wouldn't boot.\n\n*I've tried using this ppa. On first reboot, the screen resolution was correct. Subsequent reboots lead to a blank screen immediately after grub.\n\n*I've tried passing the kernel option video=1024x600 with the above PPA, to no avail.\n\n*I've tried installing a daily build of Quantal. The live image boots with the correct resolution. The installed system boots to a blank screen. The video=1024x600 option doesn't work here either.\n\n*On Quantal I've blacklisted the gma500_gfx driver to force the use of vesa. This causes Ubuntu to boot into a 800x600 resolution.\n\n*After this, I've tried using the following xorg.conf:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"card\"\n    Driver      \"vesa\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier  \"panel\"\n    Modeline    \"1024x600_DDC\" 54.03 1024 1048 1184 1344 600 603 609 670 -hsync -vsync\n    Option      \"PreferredMode\" \"1024x600_DDC\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier  \"screen\"\n    Device      \"card\"\n    Monitor     \"panel\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Depth   24\n        Modes   \"1024x600_DDC\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nwhere the modeline comes from DDC, as reported in /var/log/Xorg.0.log. This seems to have no effect, with the resolution stuck at 800x600.\n\n*Additionally, adding nomodeset to the kernel command line does not help with either the resolution problem or the blank-screen problem.\n\n\nIdeally, since I don't think I can trust the gma500_gfx driver or that from Meego (the one in Sarvatt's PPA), I would like to use the vesa driver (probably reverting to 12.04), and specify the resolution in a xorg.conf file, but I can't seem to get this to work. Any ideas?\nBTW, this is a problem I'm helping a friend with, I don't have direct access to the machine.\n\nA: The black-screen problem is in fact a backlight brightness issue. If you look closely you can see the screen actually displays what it should, but the backlight is off.\nHere are the steps I followed with the help of @pablomme to fix the issue using daily build of Quantal on new generation Atom Netbook.

Once it's finished you can close the terminal.\nWith the above the brightness should no longer be reset to zero at boot-time, so you'll be able to see the screen. If you would like to change the brightness, open a terminal and enter:\nsudo setpci -s \"00:02.0\" F4.B=BB\n\nwhere CC is the value of the brightness (hexadecimal, going from 00 to FF; e.g. 00=minimum, 33=dark, 77=medium, BB=light, FF=maximum).\n\nA: The support for your GMA3600 can be provided directly by the kernel if you compile it with the option\nCONFIG_DRM_GMA3600=y\n\nmany users on the internet report this option working well with the kernel 3.3 or higher.\nThis option is usually disabled and not adopted by many kernels that comes by default in many distros, Ubuntu isn't an exception.\njust run this command\ncat /boot/config-$(uname -r) | grep -i gma\n\nand you will get what i'm saying.\nI suggest to re-compile the kernel https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile or to compile the driver that you need as module and load it if it's possible with your actual kernel configuration, remember to use a kernel >= 3.3 .\nI also have found a topic in french that marked this issue as solved http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?id=852521 .\nthe solution in that french thread is basically about installing this PPA https://launchpad.net/~sarvatt/+archive/cedarview and all the 3 packages in it http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?pid=10015261#p10015261 .\nThere is also this blog with a slightly different solution using the same PPA as before  http://daily.siebler.eu/2012/06/ubuntu-12-04-driver-for-intel-cedarview-atom-n2000-und-d2000-serie/\n\nA: Firstly, Open terminal and type: \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\n\n*Followed by sudo apt-get update\n\n*And sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel\nThis will install INTEL latest drivers.

Is there a way to boot my computer in the morning and play music without turning it on? It's not that easy to find anything on Google because I don't have problems with booting. I'd rather like to improve the way my computer boots. \n\nA: You have basically two options to get a timer-controlled auto-boot with \n\n\n*\n\n*In your BIOS, search for the timer-controlled Auto-Bootup-Option and select it. Some BIOSes have this function, BUT NOT all! This depends on the BIOS manufacturer and version.

Now you want to configure your Router so that the router wakes the PC everyday at the time you want via Wake-on-LAN. It could be that your Router doesn't support this function, but it should.\nNow, you can configure your Ubuntu so that you have an auto-login and a startup-script that plays the music.\nI hope you understand my answer and that it is helpful for you.\n\nA: If you're not afraid to auto-boot to some user without a password, try Wake on Plan app to switch on your computer at a desired time. Currently it's available from PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~xintx-ua/+archive/wakeonplan\nIn a week, it should be available from Ubuntu's extras repository:\nhttps://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/1188/\nYou only need to select which player to autostart with:\nHow to edit autostart applications?\nFor example:\nvlc /path/to/music \n(don't forget to escape spaces like this: vlc /home/user/folder\\ name\\ with\\ spaces )\n\nA: There's this software in the Ubuntu Software Center called 'gWakeOnLan'. Install it.\nThen add a startup script on your machine to play music when the computer is switched on.\nNote: The machine needs to be turned off with Wake On LAN magic packet enabled.\n\nA: You can use any software to wake on host by LAN (e.g., from your phone or any other PC). \nWhatever you use, you will also need to set up appropriate script to play music after start up.\nThis article on my own blog describes how to automatically wake up Ubuntu and shut it down when you don't need to use the server. So for you, Ubuntu starts to play music and will turn off after that.

One of the packages required is libsdl1.2debian:i386. Trying to naively install this caused apt-get to try and uninstall most of the OS. Eventually I figured out, with some careful aptitude work, that the problem can be solved by downgrading a point-release on the 64-bit libasound2 and libgcrypt11 packages. For example, the version of libasound2 installed was 1.0.25-1ubuntu10.1, whereas the latest :i386 version was 1.0.25-1ubuntu10. Now, when trying to update my system, it claims everything is up-to-date, and there is no sign of the newer packages... what's going on? This should be handled better in some way...\n\nA: Turns out that the issue originated from installing various PPAs, such as tikhonov-misc-precise. This installs slightly-more-updated packages for AMD64, which breaks :i386 packages which require an identical version.\nFixing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the PPAs\n\n*Install aptitude\n\n*Using aptitude, try to install the ia32-libs package - many packages will break.\n\n*Use the b key to find broken packages. At the bottom of the package details page in aptitude, available packages will be shown. If an older one is available - install it (using i).\n\n*When you're all done, only ubuntu-official packages should be installed, and you should be good to go.\n\n\nI wish it weren't this complicated... recovering from a bad PPA seems to be quite a pain.\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu within Windows? I'm new to Ubuntu. I want to install and try learning it. Do I need to format my PC and create another partition on my hard disk? I only have one partition C: and I don't want to format the PC and lose any data. Can I install Ubuntu on the same drive or partition that Windows is installed on (without uninstalling windows)?\n\nA: Yes, you can install Ubuntu on the same hard drive as windows.\nYou do not need to format your PC and create a separate partition.\nHow much space do you have left on C drive?\nUbuntu needs 10gb minimum, but 20 or 30gb would be better.\nFrom the Ubuntu installation menu you need to select 'install alongside windows'.\nThis option will automatically repartition your drive & install Ubuntu alongside windows.\n (you can change the partition size using a slider)  \nI recommend defragmenting your C drive first, although it is not necessary. \nEDIT : \nUsing the downloaded Ubuntu.iso you can create a bootable installation CD using these instructions or a bootable installation USB using Unetbootin.  \nThen have a look at this guide on my personal website for details on using your BIOS to boot your installation CD / USB.\n\nA: In that case best option for your is try Ubuntu in a virtual environment. It's not possible to install Ubuntu in the same where windows is present. You need to have different partition to get Ubuntu installed. \nI will suggest to check out Virtual Box and give Ubuntu a spin.\n\nA: As others have pointed out, there are many ways to install Ubuntu. The first step is to download the ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso file, as you have done. Next you have to burn that file into a CD. The instructions are at:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/try-ubuntu-before-you-install\nAs it says in this page you can try using Ubuntu without installing by booting from the CD you created. This CD can also be used to install Ubuntu INSIDE windows. This method is often called Wubi installation. Ubuntu will reside in a big file in your C: drive. No new partition will be created. Neither will the C: drive be formatted. Once Ubuntu is installed you will have the choice of booting Windows or Ubuntu when you start the computer. To do this kind of install insert the CD while windows is running and follow the instructions. You can read about Wubi here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide/\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to get default xorg.conf back? I accidentally modified my /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.

How can I get my default xorg.conf back? and if possible how can I remove the twitchy/shaky touchpad? I saw a lot of threads regarding this issue but I could not get the solution to it. Thanks\n\nA: The default on Ubuntu is to not have an xorg.conf. Just removing it should be fine. If you're using the proprietary Nvidia drivers, you may need to just re-run the nvidia-settings tool, and have it write out a new xorg.conf.

See man mount for details.\nHowever, you usually do not need to specify -t or the filesystem type. mount should be able to infer the filesystem type, and when it cannot, usually that means you are mounting it incorrectly or there's something wrong with the partition.\nFurthermore, you generally must run mount as root.\nSo you could just use:\nsudo mount /dev/sda12\n\nBut that, too, will be insufficient unless /dev/sda12 is listed in /etc/fstab. Otherwise, you must mount it, specifying the mount point.\nSo, if you wanted a mount point of /media/Foo, first you would have to create it (if it's not already there):\nsudo mkdir /media/Foo\n\nThen you'd mount the drive there, specifying that as the mount point:\nsudo mount /dev/sda12 /media/Foo\n\nYou can see what's mounted by running mount with no arguments:\nmount\n\nOnce mounted, you can unmount it with the umount command, passing the device node name or the mount point name:\nsudo umount /dev/sda12\n\nsudo umount /media/Foo\nYou may prefer to mount this volume without running any commands as root, and without having to create or specify a mount point. You can accomplish that with a dynamic mount. The mount point is created on-the-fly and is named the same as the volume name (unless there is no volume name, then usually it's the partition's UUID).\nDynamic mounting in Ubuntu is done with udisks. You can invoke it explicitly:\nudisks --mount /dev/sda12\n\nOr you can click on the volume in a file manager like Nautilus, and the appropriate udisks command will be invoked automatically. (This is especially helpful if you don't know the device name but could identify the partition's volume name in a list.)\nTo unmount a partition that is mounted with udisks:\nudisks --unmount /dev/sda12\n\nOr you can still unmount it directly as root, if you wish:\nsudo umount /dev/sda12\n\n\nA: -t flag in mount command expects the type of the filesystem after it. Assuming that the partition you are trying to mount is ntfs you should run sudo mkdir /media/mydrive123; mount -t ntfs /dev/sda12 /media/mydrive123 It should mount the sda12 on mydrive123 in /media directory. Now you should be able to access the contents of sda12.\n", "Q: No sound or sound card not detected in Dell Precision WorkStation T7400 I have got Ubuntu 10.04 Server Edition running on a Dell Precision T7400 Workstation with an Intel Sound card \nIntel [HDA Intel], device 0: AD198x Analog [AD198x Analog]\nand I am trying to get the sound working on the system, but the sound is not working.\nOn typing lspci at the prompt, all I get is this\n\nA: In Ubuntu, there is a preferences dialog for audio settings.

I kind of new to linux and don't know much about window and desktop managers and that's why I am getting confused.\nSince Ubuntu 12.04 relies on Unity, why are there so much Gnome Lib file and settings present when viewed through synaptic package manager (I'm viewing currently installed ones)\nAlso while browsing the software center I saw compiz and metacity there, why are they there and can I uninstall them? (What is unity by the way?).\n\nA: Unity is a shell interface (think GUI for the OS) for Gnome. You have lots of Gnome libraries because Ubuntu is still Gnome-based behind-the-scenes, it just doesn't use Gnome's shell. Don't uninstall the Gnome libraries because Ubuntu relies on them.\n\nA: You can uninstall whatever you like, but you cannot remove things and expect them to still work. You can save a few megabytes of disk space by removing software that isn't in use, but you're also likely to cause serious issues if you don't know what you're doing. \nIf the goal is to explore a Linux system, then I'd rather recommend that you start with a basic system and try to build yourself something nice by adding bits and pieces to the base. That way, you'll see the effect the components have in your system. If instead you explore by taking things away, you won't really know what effect they have, because you'll break other components that depend on them. \nUbuntu is still based on Gnome, which is a fairly huge platform consisting of much more than you see. The file manager, Nautilus, for instance, is part of it. And libraries are shared between applications. So, for instance, if you replaced Nautilus with some other application, you wouldn't be able to remove all libraries that Nautilus uses, because you still have Totem. \n", "Q: Ubuntu from USB stick won't work I'm relatively new to linux and am trying to put linux my HP netbook. Since I'm trying to install it on a netbook I have to use the USB method of partitioning my hard drive. \nSo I have downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 and put it on to my USB drive with various different live USB creators, LinuxLive USB creator, and unetbootin for example and all arrive at the same issue. After the live USB has been created I power down and then start up my computer and go to BIOS and tell it to load from the USB instead of the hard drive and it displays about two lines that seem like copyright information, but it's hard to tell they are on screen for about 2 seconds and then the screen goes blank and a flashing cursor (_) is in the upper left corner. I've left it here for about an hour thinking it might be slow but nothing has changed.\nI thought it might be the USB that was the issue so I put it in another computer (laptop but not netbook) and that booted up and loaded the Ubuntu menu just fine, so my thought is that the problem stems from it being a netbook.\nI don't get to any ubuntu menu at all so I can't change any settings, so I am at a loss for what to do.

So in Glade you have to write\n../media/icon.png\n\nWith the two dots (.) you go back into the /data folder. Then you say to go into /media and open icon.png. You have to do so because the Glade .ui files are stored in /projectname/data/ui/ - from here you have to go back by 1 and then into the /media folder.\nWhen writing the .desktop.in file (the desktop/application entry) for example for including the icon, you have to write it like this:\n./data/media/icon.png\n\nTake care to write only one point.\nOh, what I forgot: The application does not need root access to write into files and quickly does all important packaging (the thing with /opt/) automatically. You do not have to take care of /opt/.\nI hope I could help you with your questions.\nPS: Note that the Ubuntu App Developer Showdown is over!\n\nA: I was wondering the best way to do this in the past, and looking at the example on http://developer.ubuntu.com for the media player (link seems to be dead these days), they use the helpers module that is there by default when using quickly.\nfrom <appname>_lib import helpers\n\ndef get_path(self):\n    file_path = helpers.get_media_file(\"filename.ext\")\n    file_path = file_path.replace(\"file:///\", \"\")\n    return file_path\n\nIf you take a look at the actual helpers code, this just looks in the media folder, from within the data folder.\nThis returns the file path prefixed with \"file:///\" which is not always accepted, hence the removal above.\n\nA: I think the function get_data_path() in [appname]_lib/[appname]config.py is set up to do exactly this. So in Python, import that function at the beginning of your file:\nfrom [appname]_lib.[appname]config.py import get_data_path\n\nThen when you want to use a file in your data directory you can get its path like this:\ndata_path = get_data_path()\nfilepath = os.path.join(data_path, 'mydatafile.css')\n\n", "Q: Reset GDM to default Display  Manager I'm currently running Xubuntu 10.04 LTS and wanted to try out the SLiM display manager on my system.\nWell I installed it (from the synaptic package manager) and something really bad happened; I can't even get to the display manage anymore to log in.\nWhen I boot up normally, it shows the Xubuntu logo, then shows this one underscore in the top-left corner of my screen.

Thanks for the help though.\n\nA: You can use a text-based virtual console to perform configuration changes. Press Ctrl+Alt+F1, then log in. You won't see any *s or anything at all while entering your password. That is by design.\nYou can then remove slim via the command line, which will reconfigure your other display manager to work again (since you didn't actually remove it). This command will do that:\nsudo apt-get remove slim\n\nOr you can reconfigure your other display manager (in this case, gdm) to be the default, while keeping slim installed:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\n\n(Thanks to Anwar Shah for pointing this out.)\nAs another alternative, which does not require rebooting, you can manually stop slim and start your other display manager (presumably gdm on this system). slim may well be stopped already, but issuing the stop command will then simply fail, and will not be harmful.\nsudo stop slim\nsudo start gdm\n\nOn later systems, you may have lightdm instead of gdm as the default display manager. Then you'd use sudo start lightdm instead. Similarly, on KDE, you may have kdm, so you'd use sudo start kdm instead.\nYou've asked how to revert to gdm.

Some users of my client are frequently changing root(administrative) password of ubuntu.\nMy client is administrative user of that system. How to prevent other users to change administrative password?\n\nA: I know that you can change the root password easily by dropping to the root shell prompt from the recovery menu, if you select the recovery option on boot. So these other users may just be restarting the system and choosing the recovery option on boot, dropping to that prompt and changing it from there without needing root access.\nYou could disable this by removing the recovery entry from the grub list using a program such as grub-customizer, which requires root access to run. Once this option is disabled, it will remove the recovery mode option from grub and prevent at least one way by which any user can change the password. Just keep in mind that should the Ubuntu installation stop working properly and require the recovery options, you'll have to find a way to undo this change without access to the terminal (probably through a live CD).\nOf course, it could also be that your client simply chooses easy to guess root passwords that the other users can find through trial-and-error. That's worth looking into.\n\nA: As the multiple commenters have explained, your client needs to make all the other users Standard users, who no longer have \"root\" privileges.\nHe/she can do this by going to System Settings...User Accounts.\n", "Q: How does a Python DBus session service know the user is logging out? Say you have a DBus service on the session bus (the per-user bus). Your service might get started via an /etc/xdg/autostart/* file, or it might get started the first time some app tries to use your well-known service name. Either way, let's say that the DBus session bus is the process that starts your service.\nAnd then the user logs out. So what happens? Does DBus send any actionable SIG<foo> signals to your service, or is it strait to SIGKILL? Is there any other way to know the user is logging out? Basically, I have some cleanup actions I need to run, which includes killing sub-processes started with subprocess.Popen and multiprocessing.\nNow you before you say, \"Popen and multiprocessing are evil, don't use them\", in my current experiment, I'm not using them. I'm just trying to figure out how a Python DBus service can hook into something that allows it to run cleanup actions, whatever the overall architecture might be.\nAny advice? Any examples? Note that my example will be running in a GObject.MainLoop and is using Python3 on Ubuntu Precise (or Quantal).\n\nA: You can either do something like this:\nbus = dbus.SessionBus()\nbus.call_on_disconnection(your_method_to_do_stuff)\n\nOr you can connect to the NameLost signal on the org.FreeDesktop.DBus interface. The former doesn't let you pass additional arguments, and your method can only take the bus connection object itself as an argument. The latter is a bit more complicated, but doesn't seem to allow passing in other arguments of your own accord either, and you are limited to taking the arguments which the signal itself sends, which in this case is a string of the message bus name your process formerly owned.\nOn the other hand, if your process does stay around after that, you should theoretically get a SIGKILL at some point as well.\n\nA: If you only care about running under GNOME & Unity you should be able to hook into the session manager DBus interface. That not only gives you a “about to log out” message via the QueryEndSession and EndSession signals, but also allows you to block logout/shutdown until you're done cleaning up if you want, via EndSessionResponse.\nI'm not sure to what extent KDE implements a compatible interface.\n", "Q: How to run a script on each login or once a day if not run that day already?

Be sure that Enable PAE/NX is checked.\n\nFor commandline\nVBoxManage modifyvm <VM_name> --pae on\n\n", "Q: Is it possible reduce swap memory size? The matter is that my computer has 3Gb of memory ram. Therefore i think that i don't need too much swap memory size, and i really need free space in the hard disk. \nsorry by my English\n\nA: Yes.  You can change the size of the swap partition, by using GParted.  You can install it from the Ubuntu Software Center.  \nRemember that gparted won't work on a mounted partition. When you are working on the swap partition, you have to unmount it first with swapoff.  When you are done, to active the new swap space you do it with swapon.\nNOTE: You might want to consider doing this from a live/bootable CD or USB, to be safe.  Also keep in mind that anytime you deal with partitions, there is risk involved in doing so.\nNOTE: When dealing with partitions, always make sure that a backup is available in case something goes wrong.  You may consider Clonezilla\n\n\nA: I think that your best option is to lower the \"swappiness\" value, dealing with the partition table of your HDD can be tricky and dangerous.\nrun this command\ngksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nadd this line\nvm.swappiness=0\n\nrestart the computer, the kernel will not use the swap, the swap will be mounted but unused.\nyou can set this between 0 and 100, the meaning of this option is about the percentage of use of the swap space, 0 = never use the swap.\n", "Q: Sharing IPv6 from SixXS to local KVM guests I have a couple of tunnels and a subnet from SixXS. One tunnel is for my laptop, the other is for my desktop. On my desktop, I run kvm and have a few guests that I really would like to have IPv6 access.\nWhat is the easiest way to do this? \n\nA: The simplest way is to setup radvd to announce your subnet on the local interface.  IPv6 capable clients should auto-configure.  \nBe sure you setup a firewall otherwise your devices will be exposed to the Internet.  My article on Implementing IPv6 6to4 should help.\nClients which should not be reachable from the Internet will be slightly more secure if you enable IPv6 privacy which will add new addresses periodically, and remove the old address when it is safe to do so.\nFor local services IPv6 works well with zero configuration services like Bonjor, avahi, and the like.  \n\nA: *\n\n*Set up a network bridge. (While these docs don't mention it, you may also have to disable NetworkManager if you're using it.)\n\n*Change your KVM virtual machines to use bridged networking. You can do this from the command line or from the GUI, but the virtual machine must be shut down and then booted for the change to take effect.\n\n*Assign a static IPv6 address for your bridge br0 from within the subnet you received from SixXS. Add the following to /etc/network/interfaces (after customizing it):\ninterface br0 inet6 static\n     address 2001:db8:deca:fbad::1\n     netmask 64\n\n\n*Configure your Ubuntu box as an IPv6 router.\n\n*Reboot.\n\nA: What I ended up doing, was to setup one VM in the virtual network to use as a router. I asked SixXS for a new tunnel for that. \nIt's really quite simple. \nOn the VM you use as router\n\n\n*\n\n*Install aiccu from the repositories. \n\n*Install radvd from the repos. It does not include a configuration file, so I used the one below. TUNNEL_PREFIX_FROM_SIXXS.NET can be found in the \"Home\" page on Sixxs.net next to Tunnel Endpoint which is the address you get on the sixxs-00 interface after running aiccu. \n\n\n\ninterface eth0 {\n    AdvSendAdvert on;\n    MaxRtrAdvInterval 30;\n    AdvOtherConfigFlag on;\n\n    prefix TUNNEL_PREFIX_FROM_SIXXS.NET {\n        AdvOnLink on;\n        AdvAutonomous on; \n    };\n};\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/sysctl.conf and uncomment the line \"#net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1\" by removing the #. It seems necessary to reboot after this change, though I don't know exactly why. \n\n*Then edit your /etc/network/interfaces to setup an IP for your eth0. \n\n\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\niface eth0 inet6 static\n    address AN_IP_IN_YOUR_SUBNET\n    netmask 64\n\nOn other clients in the virtual network\nNow that the router is up and running, you just need to setup /etc/network/interfaces for the other clients. Give it an IP in the subnet and use the gateway directive to point to the routers eth0 IPv6 address:\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\niface eth0 inet6 static\n    address AN_IP_IN_YOUR_SUBNET\n    netmask 64\n    gateway ROUTERS_IPV6_ADDRESS\n\nOther things to do\nI didn't use DHCPv6 or reverse DNS. You can install and use wide-dhcpv6-server if you want that. It's also likely that you'll want to setup your /etc/hosts to use the IP given to the VMs. There's nothing special about that and the file does include examples. \n", "Q: Close terminal and avoid closing running program \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to clean launch a GUI app via the Terminal (so it doesn't wait for termination)? \n\nI start a program from terminal with the following command:\n<program name> &\n\nBut when I close the terminal the program will close too. How to escape the program closing?\n\nA: One solution is to use screen and detach from it:\nsudo apt-get install screen    \nscreen\n<program name> &\nctrl-a ctrl-d (this detaches the screen session)\n\nThis is useful especially when starting programs on remote servers. You can then run screen -R to reattach.  See this howto.\n\nA: You can close the terminal by pressing Ctrl-D at the prompt instead of using the window controls. This will do what you want.\n", "Q: Run shell script on every new shell I want to run a shell script (define some environment variables) at the start of every new shell (globally, not for several users).\nSo I placed my script into the directory /etc/profile.d/, but that works only for login shells. Is there a better place for my script?\n\nA: For interactive login shells, as you've found, you can put commands in scripts located inside:\n/etc/profile.d/\n\nYou can also accomplish that, in a somewhat less desirable way, by editing the global configuration file:\n/etc/profile\n\nFor bash (which is the default interactive shell), there is a corresponding file where you can put commands to be run by all interactive non-login shells:\n/etc/bash.bashrc\n\nJust as /etc/profile.d and /etc/profile correspond to ~/.profile, /etc/bash.bashrc corresponds to ~/.bashrc.\nThis does not apply to non-interactive shells. But it's rather unlikely that you have commands you want run by non-interactive shells. (Then they would run every time any script was run.)\n\nA: Have a look at\n/etc/bash.bashrc\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 64bit Black Screen on Minecraft \nPossible Duplicate:\nMinecraft in jdk 1.7.0_u2 x64 \n\nI have tried posting on the forums, but I really need help (I'm a server admin and really don't want to have to switch to Windows just to run Minecraft). Anyhow, I originally was running openjdk6 as I was told that 7 was unstable and was getting periodical lag spikes while walking (at least once every 3 seconds the screen would freeze for a tenth of a second). \nAfter that, I attempted to install Sun's Java JDK7 (I couldn't get ahold of 6 without signing up for Oracle's newsletters). Upon attempting to run Minecraft, I got a black screen after logging in with this error message:\n27 achievements\n182 recipes\nSetting user: Thunder7102, -1618112820878091307\nException in thread \"Minecraft main thread\" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /home/noiro/.minecraft/bin/natives/liblwjgl.so: /home/noiro/.minecraft/bin/natives/liblwjgl.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32 (Possible cause: architecture word width mismatch)\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader$NativeLibrary.load(Native Method)\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary1(ClassLoader.java:1939)\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary0(ClassLoader.java:1864)\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1825)\n        at java.lang.Runtime.load0(Runtime.java:792)\n        at java.lang.System.load(System.java:1059)\n        at org.lwjgl.Sys$1.run(Sys.java:69)\n        at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n        at org.lwjgl.Sys.doLoadLibrary(Sys.java:65)\n        at org.lwjgl.Sys.loadLibrary(Sys.java:81)\n        at org.lwjgl.Sys.<clinit>(Sys.java:98)\n        at org.lwjgl.opengl.Display.<clinit>(Display.java:132)\n        at net.minecraft.client.Minecraft.a(SourceFile:184)\n        at net.minecraft.client.Minecraft.run(SourceFile:657)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:722)\n\nNow, this got me fed up, so I tried to install a Windows 7 virtual machine through virtualbox, I gave it 256mb of graphics memory with 2D and 3D acceleration and 3GB of RAM. I installed Java JDK7 for Windows (which does work from experience on my other Windows 7 partition). Once again, a black screen after login.

It contains a 32bit library that Java cannot load.\nHonestly, have you obtained Minecraft in a legal manner? I do not believe an official copy would have such a bug.\n\nA: Have you installed the proprietary drivers for your Nvidia GTS 450?\nTry the following:\nsudo jockey-gtk\n\nIn the Additional Drivers window that appears, highlight 'NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (version current) [recommended]' and click the Activate button on the bottom right.  Lather, rinse, and see if Minecraft behaves any better.\n\nA: I don't really like using things from the ubuntu PPA, because they are often outdated (examples: playonlinux, flightgear).\nHere's what i did to solve it (works also for the web version of minecraft):  \ncd /etc/ld.so.conf.d\nsudo su\necho [path to java]/lib/amd64 > java.conf\nldconfig -v\n\nnow just run java by opening it with java in the file manager\nP.D. you have to replace [path to java] with your java path, in the case you use openjdk7 (64 bit), it is /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre\nBTW: this is a duplicate of: this thread\n", "Q: Cannot create file/directory in home directory I have a headless Ubuntu 12.10 server.

I don't believe I requested encryption of my home directory, but perhaps that is causing things to go awry? Can anyone explain what's gone wrong here and/or provide a solution?\n\nA: Looks like ownership on your home directory is messed up.  At the very least, you should have write permission to your own home, and it looks like that is not the case.  Here is the top few lines of output when I look at my own home directory:\nmike@cobbler:~$ ls -al\ntotal 474700\ndrwxr-xr-x 45 mike mike      4096 Jul 14 12:55 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root      4096 May 28 15:39 ..\n\nSince it seems that root is able to do what it should, try the following:\nsudo chmod 755 ~/\n\nNote that this is not recursive, so it will only affect the home folder.  After you've done this, try another ls -la and see what permissions on . are.  If they seem to be changed, try mkdir again without using sudo or root, or simply 'touch afile'\nLet me know how it goes!\n\nA: Try a \nsudo chown administrator:administrator -R /home/administrator\nsudo chmod u+w .\n\n\nA: The current directory (your home) is missing the \"w\" (write) permission.\nTry these commands\ncd ~\nchmod u+w .\n\nDon't forget the dot at the end. It represents the current directory.\nOr you can do the same with just one command:\nchmod u+w ~\n\nYou don't even need sudo according to my tests.\n", "Q: Not getting wireless icon , not even wifi

You can follow above steps or you can do just the following....\nTo fix booting problem you can install a program 'EasyBCD' in Windows.\nDownload it here\nFollow these steps to restore GRUB when after installing EasyBCD:\n- Launch the program and select ADD NEW ENTRY from the EasyBCD Toolbox\n\n- Select the 'Linux/BSD' from the operating systems column\n\n- Choose GRUB (Legacy) under type and Click on the ADD ENTRY icon\n\n- Choose YES to the restart prompt\n\nGRUB will be displayed after the restart which will detect the Ubuntu partition for you to be able to boot into Ubuntu\n\nA: You could only try to get the .iso image onto a USB Stick. For this, you can use every operating system. (For more information about this click here, look below to see the steps for copying Ubuntu onto a USB stick)\nThe USB stick is like a normal CD, but it is much faster.\n", "Q: How can I stop KDE apps from being shown in the Software Centre? Their size is so big, that's why I will never download any of them so they're just been in my way to find the native software that am willing to download from Ubuntu software center, so is there is anyway to delete their PPA or whatever?\n\nA: You cannot, but try Synaptic instead\nMost KDE apps are in the official repositories and not in a PPA, so there's no way to prevent them being shown when you browse/search in the Software Centre.\nAs an alternative, try installing the Synaptic Package Manager instead, and look at the listings under the \"Gnome Desktop Environment\" sections for a selection of \"native\" apps:\n\n", "Q: How can I control the volume of the line-in input + normal output at the same time? I have a sound source connected via line-in to my computer. But when I change the master volume, only the volume of sounds being played on the computer (e.g. media, alerts, etc.) changes; the output volume of the line-in source does not change. How do I control that?\nUPDATE:\nTo clarify, I don't just want to control the line-in output volume, I want to control the normal \"output volume\" from one control only, and I want that to affect also the line in output volume. Something like a \"master volume\" that would affect everything that comes out of the sound card output.\nThe \"master volume\" I see when running the command \"alsamixer\" only affects the sound that comes from the main pc, not from the line in.\n\nA: I came up with a solution to be able to control the volume of both your \"Master\" and \"Line\" using only your keyboard's \"Media Keys\".\nFirst step is to disable your default volume controls by going into System → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts, clicking the \"Shortcuts\" tab and setting Volume Up & Volume Down to \"Disabled\" on the \"Sound and Media\" page.\nSecondly, you will need to assign your \"Volume Keys\" to custom commands on the \"Custom Shortcuts\" page. To do that, click on the \"+\" at the bottom to add a shortcut. Name the first command Volume Up and have it execute a scripts: ./path-to-scripts/VolumeUp.sh. Repeat this process for a second command and have it execute your VolumeDown.sh script instead. Next, click on the command where it says \"Disabled\" and assign your key to it (repeat for both).\nFinally, create your 2 scripts referred by the custom shortcuts and copy paste the following into them:\nVolumeUp.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\namixer -c0 -sq <<-EOF\nset Master 10%+\nset Line 10%+\nEOF\n\nVolumeDown.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\namixer -c0 -sq <<-EOF\nset Master 10%-\nset Line 10%-\nEOF\n\nDon't forget to set your scripts as \"Allow executing file as program\" in the file properties or chmod it to allow execution. You might also need to read up on amixer to know how much to modify the volume by (10% is just used as default).\nIf you open gnome-alsamixer, you should now see both \"Master\" and \"Line\" go up and down as you press your \"Volume Keys\". Only downside is the key, must be pressed and can't be held down to change the volume.\n\nA: I've followed the Jason B's answer and it worked. But i also added code for it to show the volume notification, as it's the default behaviour in ubuntu 14.04.\nHere's what's to add at the end of the files:\ntmp1=$(amixer get Master | grep dB | sed 's/\\(^[a-z0-9 :]\\+\\[\\|\\[\\|\\]\\)//gi')\ntmp2=(${tmp1//\\ / })\ntmp3=(${tmp2//\\%/ })\nnotify-send hi -i notification-audio-volume-high -h int:value:$tmp3 -h string:synchronous:volume\n\n\nA: have you tried the line-in-control already ? Press Alt+F2 and type 'gnome-alsamixer'. You should get a window with a lot of controls, called mixer, in which you can adjust every single sound source.\nP.S.: In notebooks, but also in PCs with sound-on-board the line-in is realized using a second sound device quite often, so it is possible you will have to choose another tab in the mixer (if there are more displayed) first.\n", "Q: problem forwarding USB device to virtual box I want to connect a CAN to USB interface for programming an engine control unit to a WinXP virtual machine.\nonly this device is not listed in under the small USB Icon at the lower left of the vm window.\nrunning usb-devices I get the following info:\nT:  Bus=06 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#=  3 Spd=12  MxCh= 0\nD:  Ver= 1.10 Cls=ff(vend.)

(so I can bring my main window to the foreground)\nEDIT:\nI just found this method in the api: GtkWindow - set_startup_id().\nThis says: Normally, startup identifier is managed automatically and you should only use this function in special cases like transferring focus from other processes.\nSo this means it should be possible to bring focus to a window from another process. But how would I get this id? And how would I use this id to bring it to the foreground?\n\nA: Lets start by saying that there are lots and lots of ways. \nYou normally setup a token/identifier when the program starts, so later instances can look for the existence of that token. \nI will describe one way which uses dbus.\nOverview: \nWhen starting a program, it can register itself on the session dbus under a unique name (e.g. \"org.nicklemaire.myprogram\"). Further instances of the program can check if such an accesspoint is already registered, and if so, tell the program what to do via this dbus access point (e.g. get focus, open a website, play a song). The last part is probably necessary when you want behaviour similar to \"firefox askubuntu.com\", which opens this page in a new tab in an already running instance.\nCode:\n#!/usr/bin/env python                                                                                                                           \nimport sys                                                                                                                                      \nimport gtk                                                                                                                                      \nimport dbus                                                                                                                                     \nimport dbus.service                                                                                                                             \nfrom dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop                                                                                                    \nfrom multiprocessing import Process                                                                                                             \n\nclass MyDBUSService(dbus.service.Object):                                                                                                       \n    def __init__(self):                                                                                                                         \n        bus_name = dbus.service.BusName('org.nicklemaire.myprogram', bus=dbus.SessionBus())                                                     \n        dbus.service.Object.__init__(self, bus_name, '/org/nicklemaire/myprogram')                                                              \n\n    @dbus.service.method('org.nicklemaire.myprogram', in_signature='s')                                                                         \n    def startup(self, arg):                                                                                                                     \n        print \"got the following parameter from another instance:\", arg                                                                         \n\ndef call_instance():                                                                                                                            \n    try:                                                                                                                                        \n        bus = dbus.SessionBus()                                                                                                                 \n        programinstance = bus.get_object('org.nicklemaire.myprogram',  '/org/nicklemaire/myprogram')                                            \n        bus = dbus.SessionBus()                                                                                                                 \n        programinstance = bus.get_object('org.nicklemaire.myprogram',  '/org/nicklemaire/myprogram')                                            \n        startup = programinstance.get_dbus_method('startup', 'org.nicklemaire.myprogram')                                                       \n        try:                                                                                                                                    \n            arg = sys.argv[1]                                                                                                                   \n        except IndexError:                                                                                                                      \n            arg = \"\"                                                                                                                            \n        startup(arg)                                                                                                                            \n        print \"Another instance was running and notified.\"                                                                                      \n    except dbus.exceptions.DBusException:                                                                                                       \n        exit(-1) #

Alternately, just install kubuntu (which is just Ubuntu with KDE, a really great desktop environment that's been in development since the '90s, rather than Unity.) This done, you will need to install the 3D card drivers.\nAt this time, the process of massaging the drivers to do what you want is not intuitive and can be exceedingly difficult.

Google Chrome is available for Ubuntu on the Google website but why is it not present in Ubuntu Software Centre?\n\nA: In short, licensing issues.  You can install Google Chrome by visiting www.google.com or following this direct link to Google Chrome.\n\nA: Is only because of google. Being restrictive and having non-free parts are not the reasons. Ubuntu software center accepts free software and non-free software, like flash, Acrobat reader, skype, etc. \nAnd btw, google does not have a ppa, they indeed have an apt repository which is not necesarilly a ppa.\n\nA: Because Google Chrome contains non-free parts (internal PDF, Flash and media support)\nAs you may know, the Chromium browser is available in Ubuntu Software Center. Google Chrome is built from the same source code as Chromium, but includes some additional features which make it impossible to distribute via Software Center/the official repositories.\nSpecifically, it includes proprietary PDF/Flash plugins as well as support for AAC/MP3/etc. formats. These components are non-free (no source-code available), so Ubuntu's policy forbids distributing Chrome via the Software Center/repositories.\nChrome also requires agreement to a restrictive EULA (license)\nAdditionally, while Chromium/the source has a free license (BSD), Google requires you to agree to a much more restrictive \"End User License Agreement\" (EULA) to download and use Chrome.\nGoogle forbids third-parties from distributing Chrome\nI believe Google also prohibits anyone (or any site) from redistributing the full Chrome; that's why the \"portable Chrome\" packages you find will download Chrome from Google when you install them, instead of including it. Even Download.com only gives you the tiny installer which downloads Chrome from the Google servers.\nSolution: download it, or use Google's PPA\nThe solution if you must have Chrome, as the other answers have explained, is to download Chrome or install it via Google's own PPA\n\nA: The repository has always had Chromium instead.  According to the information on this:\n\"Chromium serves as a base for Google Chrome, which is Chromium rebranded (name and logo) with very few additions such as usage tracking and an auto-updater system.\"\nIt looks the same, just a slightly different name.\n\nA: If you're set on using Google Chrome instead of Chromium, then you can use the PPA that Google provides.\n", "Q: Why does my laptop only show a cursor after closing and then opening the screen?

Please tell me what more info should I provide.\nThanks!\n\nA: A bug seems to have made its way into 3.2.0-27.\nThe only practical solution I found was to downgrade back to 3.2.0-26.\nAssuming you previously had that kernel on this box and recently upgraded, you can boot this kernel temporarily via the grub2 menu:\n* Reboot, and depress and hold the left-shift key until the boot menu appears.\n* Select the previous versions menu.\n* Choose 3.2.0-26 if available, or the latest (but pre- 3.2.0-27, of course.)\nIn the meantime if you're 'stuck in the dark,' I posted a kludge on the bug report that should let you temporarily restore max brightness.\n\nA: Couldn't change graphics with Fn keys on my Acer laptop.\nThis helped me (notice a little bit different parameter), added to /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash pcie_aspm=force acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nThen runupdate-grub and reboot.\nSource:\nhttp://www.refreshit.info/2012/08/solved-brightness-increase-and-decrease.html\n", "Q: Why can't I get a wired connection to my new router? I have only had ubuntu for about a month, when i got it i had no problem connecting to our netgear router using an ethernet cable. We have just replaced our router with an identical one (due to lightning blowing our last one up). I was unable to set up the new router on my computer as the disc wouldnt load, so we set it up on my brother win 7 machine. it seems to work fine and i can connect to it wirelessly on my dads ubuntu 10.04 machine. \nmy computer just doesnt connect, when i go onto network connections in settings it just says cable unplugged, which it isnt. There is no light on for the port my computer is plugged into on the router, although this makes sense as usually the computer has to tell the router it has set up.\ni have tried manually setting it up through the network manager using the addresses i got from this machine connected wirelessly, i have tried many restarts under different settings. is there anything i can do to make ubuntu see my connection?\nThankyou\n\nA: I'd suspect the following statement\n\nThere is no light on for the port my computer is plugged into on the router, although this makes sense as usually the computer has to tell the router it has set up.\n\nThe port light on your router is typically lit due to, not software or TCP/IP settings, but electrical connectivity. If you plug into the router, and the router's light doesn't go on for that port, you may have a bad port at the router, bad cable, or bad ethernet port on the computer.\nPossible that you were connected to that router during the lightning strike and took some electrical damage ?\nI'd get systematic and get my hands on a different cable, try different ports on the router, and also try the same cable and same port with a different computer. Please let me know how your troubleshooting proceeds.\n\nA: When there's a lightning strike, anything physically connected to a device that was directly affected is likely to have damage done to it as well. \nOne of the indicators of a bad ethernet port is if it switches from 100M/Full Duplex to 10M Full or half. I've found that anything displaying these characteristics should soon be, if not already, dead.\nAs Oyrm mentioned, I would definitely go through every possible configuration you can think of with swapping wires and equipment. Make sure you have a definite cause pinned down if at all possible, that way you can pick the most effective course of action and not spend a small fortune monkey patching something.\n", "Q: Disable GRUB and use Apple's EFI-bootloader on MacBook Pro How do I remove GRUB?

After I log in, the menu bar disappears.  Why?  I really want it back.\n\nA: Yes, it appears to be a bug in VirtualBox; it only occurs when you're using Unity hardware accelerated. If on the login screen you choose \"Ubuntu 2D\", the menu will be visible again.\nThe menu appears to be drawn under the 3D accelerated window - if you have multimonitor on a Windows host, you'll see that the Windows Taskbar also doesn't show if you change focus to another window while leaving VirtualBox in fullscreen mode on the main monitor.\nI'm not sure if the bug is in VirtualBox or the host's display drivers.\n\nA: Is it in scale mode?\nHost + C is the toggle for scale mode (where Host is Right Control by default)\n\nA: You might have accepted to not get notified again about scaled view before installing guest addition which will allow you later to change window size whilst OS append scale to it.\nReset the machine or press HOST or STRG (right side) + C\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 does not detect monitor at boot I have been using Ubuntu 12.04 for a couple of months now with no problems.

I have 1 mic attached to the system and another one in my headphone (Beats by Dr. Dre).\nI followed these steps: \nTurn PulseAudio autospawn off, normally: $ echo \"autospawn = no\" > ~/.pulse/client.conf\nkillall pulseaudio\n\nBut this did not help me and it disabled my sound after my system restarted. I then tried\necho \"autospawn = yes\" > ~/.pulse/client.conf\n\nthen \npulseaudio -D\n\nIt fixed my system sound but still no sound on Skype microphone.\nAfter that, I tried this command \necho \"options snd-hda-intel model=acer\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf > /dev/null\n\nI've also upgraded alsa sound drivers by running:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-alsa-driver-modules-$(uname -r)\n\nhowever on the last command:\nsudo apt-get install linux-alsa-driver-modules-$(uname -r)\n[sudo] password for gaurav: \nReading package lists...

Internal Speakers and headphone or 5.1 speakers both works at same time but still the microphone is not working. I even hear a noise when I don't play anything. It's freaking me out and my microphone problem is after 12.04 . Can I use my headphone microphone? I am having beats headphones.\nDetails of my system alsamixer\n\n\nEven Now My system sound  OUTPUT connector option is gone  here is the screen shot \n \n\n\nA: I have head a similar problem on a realtek HD audio system (eeePC R101). After upgrading from Ubuntu (Xubuntu) 10.04 to 12.04, the microphone turned out to be unusable, the sound it recorded was at such a low volume that it could not be used. Using skype was not possible. After looking through a couple of forum entries I summarized people had found pulseaudio not working on this type of sound card. In contrast to older skype versions that required pulseaudio, the current skype (4.1) also uses ALSA. This, however, requires pulseaudio to be uninstalled. If you don't really need pulseaudio for other reasons, give this a try:\nsudo apt-get remove pulseaudio\n\nThen reboot the system and try using skype. Make sure to turn off \"allow skype to adjust mixer levels\" in the audio settings and make sure in Alsamiser or XFCE4-mixer that the microphone is turned on.\nHopefully someone finds out why pulseaudio capture does not work on Realtek HD anymore.\n\nA: In case when this problem is not connected with the volume level, your system is probably using the wrong input device. I'm using Mint 18 and to solve my problem I installed \"pavucontrol\" from software center. \n\nYou will find it is you sound applications - \"PulseAudio Volume Control\".\n\nGo to \"Input Devices\". There you will see all your mics (real and virtual). You should choose the real one. In my case it's a webcam's mic. Make it default by pressing the green button like on the picture.\n\nThat's all. Try log out if not working at once. \n\nA: I had similar problem. My problem was not that the microphone was not working, but rather the microphone volume was much too low and they could hardly hear me on the other side. I fixed it by installing PulseAudio Volume Control (available from Ubuntu Software Center). Run the application, go to Input Devices and try increasing the volume of your microphone with the slider (it goes up to 153% in my case).\nIt helped me fix my problem. Keep in mind that at some point the volume is again reset to 100% and you have to start the PulseAudio Volume Control application again and repeat the volume increase.\nBtw, if you hear noise when not speaking, it is very likely that the system is using your built-in microphone. Go to System Settings -> Sound -> Input tab and select the appropriate Input device from there.\n\nA: My solution\nI think that the problem lies within a non-intuitive way of adjusting the recording settings.\nWithin skype, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open options dialog.\n\n*Go to Sound Devices.\n\n*Click on 'Open PulseAudio Volume Control'.\n\n\nHere comes the non-intuitive part!!!\nUnder the 'Recording' tab...\nIf no program is recording anything (being in idle mode) it shows nothing\nat all. One might think that there is nothing to this tab of interest, but\none would be mistaken!!! Keep this tab open and visible. Make sure the 'Show'\noption at the bottom is set to either 'All Streams' or 'Applications'.\nStart a test call from the options dialog.\nThe pulseaudio dialog will now show what program is recording sound from where.\nSkype: Input from...\nTo the right of this text, select your input device and it should finally work.\nIt took me a while to figure this one out.\n\nA: I had a no sound on my Microphone problem, also. I feel real silly about this one. I hadn't used the Microphone for a LONG time. When it came time for me to need it, it wouldn't work.\nI spent hours looking for solutions online. Turns out though that it was just a physical connection issue. I use a headset that has a little arm thingy that hangs down by my mouth. The arm contains the Microphone. Well, silly me... the arm wasn't pushed all the way into the headset.\nOne thing I will suggest for people is that they try to verify functionality in Windows if they don't have luck in Linux. Perhaps you'll find that your Microphone has a problem, if it also doesn't work in Windows.\nCheers!\n\nA: I found a solution about  volume , opened one terminal and will type:\nalsamixer\n\nand turn up the value in the mic boost column, with this changes, my skype capture sounds  really good.\n\nA: I would also recommend to uncheck \"Allow Skype to automatically adjust my mixer levels\" in the \"Sound devices\" Skype settings.\nIn my case Skype was muting my microphone all the time automatically.\n\nA: Changing Device Input values under gstreamer-properties fixed it for me.\nSource\n\n\nA: I did everything mentioned here. Also, Installed skype from software centre, installed ia32-libs\nbut nothing worked.\nBut what worked is:>>\nopen gstreamer-properties, and set in Audio tab> Default Input > Plugin = PulseAudio Sound Server\nI cudnt add the image as I don't have enough 'reputation' here on this forum. LOL!!!\nAnd now , mic is working , in USB Headphone. In default mic , its not working with this setting but thats ok for the moment. Leaving that part for later on or someone here on the forum!!\nI guessed this fix when I saw everyone was commenting that Skype is using PulseAudio.\nI am happy now !!\n\nA: If you already have installed by default PulseAudio, \nthe only thing you should do is to :\n\n\n*\n\n*open Synaptic Package Manager and install pavucontrol.\n\n\nAfter that, you will have in Skype > Options > Sound Devices :\n\n\n*\n\n*new button called Open PulseAudio VolumeControl\nClick on it and do some additional setting, while (during the Skype - Make a test call) is running!!!\nIf you are using WebCam Microphone, in already opened PulseAudio Volume Control, \nin Input Devices (tab), \n\n\n*\n\n*set Front Microphone to MuteAudio - because you are using webcam mic.\n\n*set Webcam Microphone to Set as fallback\n\n\nMake a test call to Skype, couple of times to set everything as you like,\nand that's it. :)\nHope it's ok now and working fine !!! :) \nP.S. \nI left selected Skype option \"Allow Skype to automatically adjuce my mixer levels\" , 'cos mic on my web-cam working excellent! \nIt is up to you.\n\nA: Quickly sharing my experience there :\nOnce on Ubuntu 12.04, sound input (onboard mic-in) drove me mad for some time.\nTL;DR first: I could avoid the microphone problem switching desktop environment to gnome-shell (or gnome-session-fallback).\nIt sounds weird but it's obvious on my rig.\nI've read a lot, tried a lot, without success.\nOn Unity desktop, the (default) sound control panel will show a wrong audio device :\n\"Stereo analog output + Digital Stereo (IEC958) input\"\n(my hardware isn't even capable of digital stereo input)\nWhile the right one should be \"Analog Stereo duplex\" .\nAny tweak through \"pavucontrol\" wouldn't have any effect.\nLater,  I've tried the latest gnome desktop (gnome-shell). \nWhile on gnome-shell, \"Analog Stereo duplex\" was available to pick and all was working as it should.\nBack on Unity, the problem was back again.\nI have no clue how this can possibly be related to Unity, but somehow it is.\n\nA: I got the same problem on a 12.10 64-bit, and I saw skype crashing while searching for some pulse audio lib under a 32-bit path.\nBy installing ia32-libs  I solved the problem.\n\nA: I had audio and video problem for at list a month! Visited several forums and tried many different troubleshooting. At last uninstall Skype and re-install from Ubuntu software Center it works perfectly now. (At first I downloaded from Skype website).         \n\nA: My answer might come a bit late but maybe it'll help somebody one day.\nIt seemed that all of sudden my microphone stopped working in skype although it still worked with all other programs. I tried all the solutions mentioned in this post (and more) but none of them worked...\nWhat worked for me was deleting the pulseaudio config and profile files so that pulseaudio is forced to generate new ones:\nrm -r ~/.pulse/\nrestart pulseaudio or your computer afterwards\n(ubuntu 12.04 64bit, skype 4.2.0.11, pulseaudio 1.1, 5.1 usb sound card)\n\nA: After having this problem linger for quite a few weeks using Ubuntu 12.04 and trying literally dozens of suggestions,  I can confirm pulseaudio as the culprit. The suggestion by jhench in my case at least, finally solved the problem:\nsudo apt-get remove pulseaudio\n\nAfter running the above on a terminal and restarting my system, Skype and all other applications that used the built in microphone on my Asus Zenbook began to work reliably. \nThere are far too many suggestions out posted throughout various sites which simply do not work, and many do more harm than good. One even suggested installing pulseaudio. I hope my confirming that this particular solution helps others in a similar set of circumstances. \n\nA: I have a Lenovo x201 with Conexant CX20585 (learned it from cat /proc/asound/card0/codec#* | grep Codec\nI have struggled for days to have my internal mic working, everything else worked (external mic, audio, HDMI audio) though.\nHere is what I did, which finally solved my problem (Ubuntu 14.10, alsa driver)\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed the nightly alsa drivers for my distribution following this guide\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/UpgradingAlsa/DKMS\n\n*ran \"alsamixer\" command from terminal to make sure my mic is not muted (press \"m\" to mute/onmute on the device; also I disabled \"automute\" here (up/down arrow)\n\n*After I looked up all entries matching my hardware Connexant by scrolling over alsa docu file on my laptop,\nzless /usr/share/doc/alsa-base/driver/HD-Audio-Models.txt.gz\nI've tried adding different entries to alsa-base.conf file with command \nvi /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf \nFinally this one was what I needed (but only turned out after step 4...):\noptions snd-hda-intel model=ideapad\n\n\n*!!! important!!!\n\n\nNone of the \"tricks\" worked until I have re-checked whether my internal mic is enabled or disabled in BIOS.\nIt was ENABLED of course, but I've changed it to disable, then enabled again, and saved with F10. \nThen not only rebooted, but SHUT DOWN completely the laptop (the BIOS help says to shutdown with AC power removed (!) to enable internal mic.\nThen after power on again: mic worked! \n(Tested and confimed in Skype as well, by calling Echo / Sound Test service.)\n\nA: I haven't found the solution that worked for me here. There are many technical solutions and other suggestions that depend on luck. Since the one I used was simple, I'll just add it. \nIn Skype sound devices option disable 'Allow Skype to automatically adjust my mixer levels'. Click on 'Open pulseaudio volume control'. In the Input Devices tab unlock the channels by clicking on the lock button. Reduce either left or right completely to 0% while keeping the other at 50%. You can then check your Skype. Lock the channels again. You will notice that the graph will start responding if it has worked. You could also do a reboot, if necessary.\nI will quote the explanation from one of the comments in http://itsfoss.com/how-to-solve-microphone-not-working-in-skype-quick-tip/ \n\n\"It seems pulseaudio looks at the mic as a stereo device but in fact it is  mono. Since right and left are 180 degrees out of phase the mic signal is eliminated (sound cancelling).\"\n\n  Hope this helps.\n\n\nA: I have translated \"My solution\" in French on my blog: http://tuxnotes.blogspot.com/2017/01/skype-dans-ubuntu-le-micro-ne.html\nWorks great in my Ubuntu Mate 16.04\n\nA: In ubuntu 16.04 just goto system settings->Sound->input, then increase the input valume in it.\n\n\nA: I could not get the Skype working, instead of talk I could hear just periods of noise.\nIn my case the problem was in a stereo microphone - disabling one of the microphones by decreasing its volume to silence helped. You need to run Volume Control (pavucontrol), click on the Input Devices tab, click on the small lock icon \"lock channels together\" which shows sliders to control volume of left and right microphone. Just slide one of them to the most left.\n\nA: I observed the same problem using Skype version 8.58 on Ubuntu 18.04. Weird thing was that my microphone worked in audacity but did not work in skype. \nMy workaround was to use Skype web with the Chrome browser. Unfortunately Firefox is not supported and on Chromium you can only chat but can't make calls. Hope this helps!\n\nA: You can try deleting the pulseaudio configuration files:\nrm -rf ~/.config/pulse/\n\nThen log out and log back in, or reboot\nThe source for this solution is this article which states that it worked on Ubuntu Cinnamon 20.04.\n\nA: Скачай и установи gnome alsa mixer и тогда микрофон заработает нормально\nTranslation:\n\nDownload and install gnome alsa mixer and then the microphone will function normally\n\n", "Q: Lost console when EC2 ssh is logged out I run a java application as a server on a EC2. But as I loose my ssh connection all console messages are also lost. When I redirect all messages to > my.log and then use tail -f my.log I dont get the e.printstacktrace messages. I wonder what I can do. \nIs there something simple that I can do, to relogin to ssh, find out which console the java application is throwing out all the messages.\nSo instead of doing a java myapp.jar &, I now do a java myapp.jar, so that I dont loose any console messages.\nThe other question is, Is there a better command than > my.log that does not miss any message from my application, so that I can log, and do a tail -f my.log ?\n\nA: I would use a terminal multiplexer - screen being the best known, and tmux being a more recent implementation of the idea. I use tmux, and would recommend you do to.\nBasically tmux will run a terminal (or set of terminals) on a computer. If you run it on a remote server, you can disconnect from it without the terminal dying. Then when you login in again later you can reconnect, and see all the output you missed.\nTo start it the first time, just type\ntmux\n\nThen, when you want to disconnect, you do Ctrl-B d (ie press Ctrl-B, then release both keys, and then press d.\nWhen you login again, you can run\ntmux attach\n\nand you will reconnect to tmux and see all the output that happened. Note that if you accidentally lose the ssh connection (say your network goes down), tmux will still be running, though it may think it is still attached to a connection. You can tell tmux to detach from the last connection and attach to your new connection by running\ntmux attach -d\n\nIn fact, you can use the -d option all the time. On servers, I have this in my .bashrc\nalias tt='tmux attach -d'\n\nSo when I login I can just type tt and reattach. You can go one step further if you want and integrate the command into an alias for ssh. I run a mail client inside tmux on a server, and I have a local alias:\nalias maileo='ssh -t mail.example.org tmux attach -d'\n\nThis does ssh to the server and runs the command at the end - tmux attach -d The -t option ensures that a terminal is started - if a command is supplied then it is not run in a terminal by default. So now I can run maileo on a local command line and connect to the server, and the tmux session. When I disconnect from tmux, the ssh connection is also killed.\nThis shows how to use tmux for your specific use case, but tmux can do much more than this. This tmux tutorial will teach you a bit more, and there is plenty more out there.\n\nA: You have a few problems if you want to leave the process running when you disconnect and see all the output later.\nCapturing Error Messages\nOne problem with your approach is that you are only redirecting stdout, but not stderr, so error messages will not go into the file. The standard idiom to redirect all output is:\njava myapp.jar 2>&1 > myapp.log\n\nThis explains what 2>&1 means and this gives chapter and verse on bash i/o redirection.\nIf you want to see the difference, you could do\njava myapp.jar > myapp.log 2> myapp.err\n\nLeave process running when you disconnect\nEven running in the background (by appending & to the command), a process is still attached to a terminal. When the terminal dies, all subprocesses will be killed, including those in the background.\nTo keep them alive you can \n\n\n*\n\n*keep the terminal alive despite losing your connection by using a terminal multiplexer (see my other answer or,\n\n*use nohup which will keep the command running (by ignoring SIGHUP).\n\n\nTo use nohup, redirecting all output to a log and putting it into the background, you can just do:\nnohup java myapp.jar 2>&1 > myapp.log &\n\nMore about nohup.\n", "Q: How do I create deb package for Oracle JDK?

I need to pause and resume the uploading when I want. Sorry for my English but I'm italian!\n\nA: Use the web uploader inside Chrome or Firefox - it has auto-resuming capability so that you can disconnect your Internet connection to pause the upload and then reconnect when you wish to continue the upload.\nIf you want to avoid losing Internet access from other programs, just change temporarily the browser's network settings to e.g. some non-existent proxy. This will kill connectivity just in the browser.\nIf you need browser access, either start the uploading in a separate/dedicated browser, or use some browser extension that let's you set proxy settings on a per-tab basis.\n\nA: I pause my uploads all the time. With the browser still open, put your computer to sleep. All of your other devices will have full connection speed. Then just wake your computer back up and the upload will resume.\n\nA: Unfortunately, no, you can't pause your upload. If the server is not receiving data within a specific time then the upload will be aborted.  \nHowever, I've been using YouTube for a long time, and there's no third party program that can pause and resume uploading videos, you may want to convert your videos to a smaller file size.\nTo convert videos you can use Transmageddon.

I can't believe I'm actually asking this, but what are some good, cheap tablets that can run Ubuntu? I'm considering getting a tablet, but I don't really want an expensive one like an iPad. And I love Ubuntu. So what tablets are out there that are cheap, but can also run Ubuntu 12.04 without much lag if it's installed after purchase? Personal anecdotes would be appreciated! Note: I'm not asking you to help me shop, just to formulate a list of tablets (+personal preference) that can use Ubuntu. \n\nA: I am now using Ubuntu 12.04 on my Samsung Slate 7 tablet. This is quite expensive, but it's because it's a notebook. i5 quad core, 4GB ram etc. The result is super-nice. Luckily, I had chances to install Linux on quite many tablets since 2003. Until now, Slate7 + Ubuntu 12.04 is the best.  \n\nA: SmartQ T20 can dualboot Ubuntu 12.04 and Android 4.0.4. Hardware acceleration is not working but it is still useable.\n\nA: Tablets so far do not come with Ubuntu natively installed on them.  However, there are many out there that have workarounds.  \nFor instance, my tablet is the discontinued HP Touchpad.  Using moboot, I have Ubuntu 11.10 booting natively.  Though there are some glitches when you go this route since the tablet was never designed to run a full featured Operating System (for instance, Ubuntu on the HP Touchpad has wireless driver issues if you are connecting to a secured wireless router.  Open networks are fine, just not secured).  \nIf you find a tablet you like search on Google for \"tablet name\" Ubuntu install and see if anything comes up.

Set up openssh-server on your computer to proceed. Next, have a look at this page to find the appropriate command to invoke the suspend.

I have a canon PowerShot A3100 IS camera, and, as written in the title, I want to know where does the automount mount it when I connect it.\nDoes anyone know?\n\nA: Assuming your camera connects over PTP, GPhoto will be responsible for the data transfers. I guess the ~/.gvfs directory will contain a virtual folder pointing to your camera. \n\nA: Mount it using gphotofs\nInstall gphotofs package:\nsudo apt-get install gphotofs\n\nThen create a directory wherever you prefer (i'm using  /home/<user>/camera)\nmkdir /home/<user>/camera\n\nAnd use the following to mount it\nsudo gphotofs /home/<user>/camera\n\nnotes\n\n\n*\n\n*replace <user> with your username  \n\n\nA: You can open the gphoto2:// address directly in your file manager.  Nautilus handles it and gives you a device.  Other browsers such as thunar you may have to enter the address manually.\n~/.gvfs is the default mountpoint produced by the gvfs-fuse-daemon (package gvfs-fuse).  This is a but temperamental so even if you have the package installed it may fail at startup.  Check the permissions on .gvfs.\nDepending on your environment (varies between versions), you may have an XDG_RUNTIME_DIR set and then .gvfs will be mounted there instead of your home dir.  Typically this will be something like /run/user/...\n\nA: With Ubuntu 12.10 I didn't have any luck with ~/.gvfs... However, I'm able to access my camera on the command line using \n/run/user/<username>/gvfs/gphoto2:host=%5Busb%3A002%2C008%5D/\n\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, it gets mounted at gphoto2://[usb:001.006]/\n\nNot all cameras are mountable. The gphoto2 command should allow you to download pictures from supported cameras.\nIf your camera is like that, you can avoid this problem by using a USB card reader. The USB card reader makes any card mountable, just like a hard drive.\n\nA: While this is true [about gphoto2 mounting cameras], there is a setting on some cameras that allow you to connect them actually as a USB mass storage device (see screenshot), then you do not have to rely on gphoto2 and can treat your camera (or the card within it) as a normal usb flash disk. The setting to change how your camera connects to the PC is not present in all camera menus, but is usually in DSLRs. It often makes transferring your pictures and videos easier to have this setting on USB mass storage- at least it works for me\n\nA: On Ubuntu 19.04, Nautilus (Ubuntu's file manager) mounts cameras at \n/run/home/$UID/gvfs/gphoto2:host=Name_of_Company_Model_Name_SomeNumbers\n\nWhere $UID is your User Identifier (it's probably 1000).\nThe last folder in the file path is probably different for your camera. You can find the string by doing\ngio mount --list --detail\n\nAnd looking for a line like\nactivation_root=gphoto2://Name_of_Company_Model_Name_SomeNumbers\n\nFor me, the camera would not get mounted unless I opened Nautilus and clicked on the camera. To mount it manually from the command line I did\ngio mount gphoto2://Name_of_Company_Model_Name_SomeNumbers\n\nAnd to unmount it I did\ngio mount -u gphoto2://Name_of_Company_Model_Name_SomeNumbers\n\n\nA: If it's mounted somewhere, you can go to the terminal and execute mount without parameters to see a list of mounted devices and their locations.\nRegards\n", "Q: Backspace, Tab, Del and arrow keys not working in terminal (using ssh) When I ssh into another Ubuntu machine with my account (with sudo permissions), my backspace key generates some awkward symbols on pressing. Also Tab, Del and Arrow keys don't work.\nOn the other hand, I also have another account on the same machine & when I ssh through this account, its terminal works perfectly fine. I couldn't figure out why is this happening.\n\nA: One of the easiest ways to fix this problem is to type /bin/bash at the command line interface prompt:\n$ /bin/bash\nThe afore mentioned command will execute the Bourne Again Shell on top of the existing shell as a subprocess.  This presents the disadvantage of utilising more resources, but nothing has to be edited and no special permissions are required.  For example, in recent Kubuntu versions it will start a /bin/bash session atop the default /bin/dash command line shell interface.\nTo persist the changes, however, one possibility is to edit the /etc/passwd file and add/edit/replace the default shell to /bin/bash after the last ':' character in the line corresponding to the user.  In order to edit this file, though, administrator privileges would be required.\n\nA: EDIT: Reference: Mateng's answer\nMateng is close in that I think you're probably running Bourne Shell.  But you shouldn't be editing your /etc/passwd file directly.  Try using the chsh command instead:\nchsh -s /bin/bash\n\nThe -s flag will make the new shell (Bash in this case) your login shell, going forward.\n\nA: when you first ssh in, try these two commands\nstty sane\nexport TERM=linux\n\nI have to do this on some machines that I go into to fix exactly this problem\n\nA: The following changes solved the problem for me. \nFirst, I checked which shell was running:\n$ echo $0\n\nwhich returned: \n/bin/sh\n\nAs I read in this post in Ubuntuforums, changing the shell to /bin/bash brings the solution. So I edited my user settings in /etc/passwd to:\njohndoe:x:1001:104:John Doe:/home/johndoe:/bin/bash\n\nI logged out, then logged in again. Strangely, I had to switch the shell manually (maybe some cache was active) by entering this:\n/bin/bash\n\nVoila!\n[The problem arose due to a distribution update.]\n\nA: 'Gbnome Terminal' does not exactly emulate 'xterm' ..\nfrom: Wikipedia >> GNOME Terminal\nGNOME Terminal emulates the xterm terminal emulator and provides some of the same features.\n\nA treatise on the issue and solution(s) can be found here:\nLinux Backspace/Delete mini-HOWTO\n\nEvery Linux user has been sooner or later trapped in a situation in which having working Backspace and Delete keys on the console and on X\n  seemed impossible. This paper explains why this happens and suggests\n  solutions. The notions given here are essentially\n  distribution-independent: due to the widely different content of\n  system configuration files in each distribution, I will try to give\n  the reader enough knowledge to think up his/her own fixes, if\n  necessary.\nI assume that the Backspace key should go back one character and then\n  erase the character under the cursor. On the other hand, the Delete\n  key should delete the character under the cursor, without moving it.\n  If you think that the function of the two keys should be exchanged, in\n  spite of the fact that most keyboards feature an arrow pointing to the\n  left (←) on the Backspace key, then this paper will not give you\n  immediate solutions, but certainly you may find the explanations given\n  here useful.\n\nSimplest solution given (which may work here) is to use: bash$ export TERM=gnome\n\nA: As a root user edit /etc/passwd file for your user and change from /bin/sh to /bin/bash\nhdfs:x:1020:1001::/home/hdfs:/bin/sh to hdfs:x:1020:1001::/home/hdfs:/bin/bash\nThis worked for me.\n\nA: I tried all the above plus notes from (this link) with no success. You may want to check vim is installed.\nI usually use vi not vim. So I installed vim. \n$ sudo apt-get install vim\n\nAfter that, the keyboard strokes started working properly when I executed vi. Looking at the output of the following, it looks like vi was made an alias to vim after the install:\n$ ls -al /etc/alternatives | grep vi \nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    18 Jan 13 09:38 vi -> /usr/bin/vim.basic\n\n\nA: None of the answers above fixed my identical problem, i.e. cannot use backspace or similar keys after sshing to a remote from an Ubuntu (here ubuntu-17.10 with ncurses-6.0).\nIt ends up being a problem with terminfo. Basically, my gnome-terminal says it's an xterm-256color terminal (via the TERM variable, which is exported by ssh to the remote) but the remote didn't have a terminfo configuration for xterm-256color.\nDoing the following fixed the issue:\n\n$host: echo $TERM\nxterm-256color\n$host: infocmp >terminfo.src\n$host: tic terminfo.src\n$host: scp .terminfo/x/xterm-256color $remote:/usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm-256color\n\ninfocmp, without any option, produces a source listing for the terminal in the environment variable $TERM. So it is equivalent to infocmp -I $TERM.\nThen the resulting source is compiled via tic.\nFinally, install the corresponding terminfo configuration to the remote location. So, the next time I connect to $remote via $host, it will know about my terminal.\n\nA: This is a compatibility issue with the keyboard, i.e., how it is interpreted in the host system.  You might have to use j or h to move in the vi editor in the command mode. Arrows will not work.\nCheck the profile preferences->compatibility in the host system for that specific user.\n\nA: If you are added as an other new user then use the following command which add you to the sudo group.

If you want to keep track then refer the Ubuntu Quantal Blueprints and Launchpad page.\nBut currently in Alpha releases Thunderbird is Default Client.\n\nA: Judging by this blueprint currently targeted for the Quantal cycle, Mozilla's dropping of Thunderbird has caught people working on Ubuntu by surprise.\nDefault applications are usually discussed at Ubuntu Desktop Summits, and the next one is after Quantal is released. My guess is that Quantal may either ship with Thunderbird or switch back to Evolution (which was the previous default email client). This issue also affects the current 12.04 LTS, so this is likely to be brought up at the next UDS to offer a 12.04.x revision with a supported email client.\nAll of the above is speculative, of course.\n\nA: Mozilla has NOT dropped support for Thunderbird, they simply won't be adding any new features to it except security updates\nMozilla has only said that their developers will not be working on Thunderbird further, i.e. adding new features, etc after 20 Nov 2012. They will continue making security updates available for Thunderbird until 30 December 2013.\nAt the same time, outside developers (\"the community\") can continue working on a parallel version of Thunderbird (still released by Mozilla) which will include new features, etc.\n\nConsidering that Mozilla.org involvement in developing Thunderbird will stop only after Quantal is released, it's a little early to begin looking about for alternatives. Even if the community doesn't pick up the slack and Thunderbird begins to go obsolete, I'm sure that Canonical will have an alternative in place by the R-series (April 2013).\n", "Q: How do I get Clear Wireless to work on Ubuntu?

They are not meant to be used in scripts, though if you needed to do that, you could add shopt -s expand_aliases to scripts to enable alias expansion.\nFunctions can be used in scripts or in the console, but are more often used in scripts.\nContrary to aliases, which are just replaced by their value, a function will be interpreted by the bash shell.\nFunctions are much more powerful than aliases. They can be used to build very complex programs.\n\nA: Think of aliases as nicknames.  You might have a command that you perform a lot but want to shorten.\nAs an example, you often want to go straight to desktop in commandline, so you can do this\nalias desktop=\"cd ~/Desktop\"\n\nFrom then on you just type\ndesktop\n\nin terminal and it will perform the cd ~/Desktop for you.\nFunctions contains logic.  In a function, you might make calls to several different programs.  Here's a simple echo function\nfunction e {\n                echo $1 \n                echo $1 $1\n                echo $1 $1 $1                 \n           }  \n\nWhile it may appear similar to an alias when you call it\ne Hello\n\nYour e() can have a lot of different things happen.  The above is a simplistic example.\nAliases should be reserved for simple use cases.  Personal example - I have replaced my rm command like this\nalias rm='trash-put'\n\nWhenever I do an rm, it will send it to trash instead of deleting it from disk.  This caters to my clumsiness in the terminal where I may (sometimes) accidentally delete an important file. \nFunctions, you need to remember, are pieces of logic.  You wouldn't use a function standalone, usually.  It would be part of a larger script.  Imagine a script which takes all of your files and renames them to their pig latin versions.  Ignore that there are different ways of doing it.  \nBut what you could do is loop through every file in the directory and pass the filepath to your RenameAsPigLatin function.  The RenameAsPigLatin function might have extra logic in there involving numbers, where you decide that files ending with numbers shouldn't be renamed. \nImmediately you can see the benefit of having it as a function.  The function can focus on the renaming by your strange rules while the rest of the script can traverse various directories as necessary.  \n\nA: As an addition to what’s already been said functions also pipe better than aliases where using an alias your locked into what’s defined by the alias (unless quoted). I have several stand-alone aliases that I call within  task specific piped commands that would be much harder to call if they were aliases. Also functions allow you to set variables either globally or locally for the task at hand.\n", "Q: Cannot properly boot into Ubuntu after installation of Nvidia driver I'm on Ubuntu 12.04.\nEverything was fine until I did a fresh install of a proprietary driver for NVIDIA, using the \"Additional drivers\" utility.

There's no S20anacron on my system, eg. The run levels associated with particular upstart jobs are defined in the upstart job conf file where runlevels apply.\nWhile the service command may look first for upstart jobs and run those in preference to /etc/init.d/ jobs, I understand upstart works directly rather than using the service command.\nIt's unclear to me why any of the above jobs, except dbus-daemon, should remain running. It appears that anacron is run by upstart at boot time, and then run regularly by cron (see /etc/crontab). It's man page says it is a cron supplement, rather than a replacement for cron.\nSince I don't know the details of your changes to your system, here's the contents of my /etc/init/anacron.conf:\n # anacron - anac(h)ronistic cron\n #\n # anacron executes commands at specific periods, but does not assume that\n # the machine is running continuously\n\n description    \"anac(h)ronistic cron\"\n\n start on runlevel [2345]\n stop on runlevel [!2345]\n\n expect fork\n normal exit 0\n\n exec anacron -s\n\n", "Q: Xfce - Docky & Thunar - Missing icon Im using xfce in combination with docky.

Optirun works fine after that. \nI also installed the current CUDA toolkit and sdk without any special tricks and everything works fine (including building pcl-trunk). \nAnother problem I had with that setup: the Kinect (you probably want to use with pcl) doesn't support USB 3.0 with the current kernel of Ubuntu 12.04. Updating to the current kernel of Ubuntu 12.10 solved that issue. \n", "Q: Gaming performance difference between Windows and Ubuntu What are the pros/cons switching from Windows 7/8 to Ubuntu?\nI mainly develop software and play games.\nI obviously don't play games on my laptop that's why I give Ubuntu a try. But the whole OS looks great and I recently discovered PlayOnLinux.\nHow big is the performance hit from Windows games? \nWhat if the game supports DX11 and has tessellation, does PlayOnLinux translate DX11 to OpenGL?\n\nA: From a 17+ year experience I can say the following:\nI have tried Wine since around 2005-2006. Also tried Cedega (Dead for me after Wine 1.2 came out) and PlayOnLinux (PoL for short). I have also seen how the developing process in Wine under Ubuntu has been quickly catching up to the latest games. For Wine installation and configuration please see How to install and configure Wine?\nAround 10 years ago if somebody came to me and wanted to change to Ubuntu, one of the questions they would ask would be: Can I play X game on Ubuntu?. If the answer was positive for that game the next question would be something along the lines of: Will it have the same performance?\n10 years ago my normal answer was no in most cases. After Wine 1.2 and when this post was created 1.4 came out, I had changed my answer for several games and for the first time I was more on the positive side about telling a new user that they could actually play the game.\nCases like Deep Space 2 which is/was one of the latest games I could play. Alice in Wonderland (The new one I mean), The Sims 3, World of Warcraft, Amnesia and others. Even Skyrim could be played. This are games that demand powerful graphics and you can play them with little to no additional setups other than the normal install and play steps.\nA quick way to know what games can or can not be played on Wine (In Ubuntu) can be found in the Wine App Database: http://appdb.winehq.org/ which holds more than 11000 games (Litte over 5000 about two years ago). This also includes information for most games about the performance, which is not the same for each game that can be playable on Linux. This helps in knowing if a game is playable and has the same confirmed performance over the same game on Windows.\nWine also offers something called Ranking which helps in determining what games can be played with less configuration and a bigger chance of them working out of the box. If you see a game with a Platinum ranking it means you have a 99% chance it will work out of the box with no problems at all, from start to finish. If you see one with the Gold ranking you might find yourself doing a little bit of configuring but at the end it will work out good. In most cases, Gold status will work out of the box. They show as Gold because they have not being updated with the latest Wine version. Of course if you have a game with the Garbage rank it means it will never work or will only work if Superman starts eating kryptonian cereal in the morning.\nA couple of years ago the amount of Platinum games was less than 50. In August 2012 (First time I wrote this answer) you could find More than 1500 games out of which almost 200 were in the Latest Titles. Today there are more than 5800 Games of which more than 1800+ are Platinum. And this is only in the Development phase of the 1.5.x. I can only imagine the amount that will reach Platinum rating once 1.6 is released. The only need here is for more people to participate and test the games on Wine (If applicable) or Steam (Which is new right now).\nWith this in mind I will always recommend using the PPA from Wine found here . This is because the official ones like the 1.4.x series, after several months, are outdated when compared to the 1.5.x development series, which to me is very stable, has many improvements and solves many issues.\nSimply run the following in the terminal: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nThen run sudo apt-get update. Afterwards install the latest version (As of this writing it is the 1.5.23). To verify the version you have installed type wine --version in the terminal.\nHOW BIG IS THE PERFORMANCE HIT?\nSeeing as the Wine development is taking huge leaps (Specially in the DX10 and DX11 departments) and can say the following from experience:\n\n*\n\n*Games like world of warcraft run much smoother in older PCs. They somehow use LESS MEMORY than in their Windows scenario and achieve better FPS in older PCs. This I tested in 8 PCs for friends that wanted to test out Ubuntu but also played WoW. All cases mentioned the same positive result. In the DX11 gxApi setup I actually could play WoW with very awesome graphics. But for best results OpenGL is better. This is not the same for high spec PCs where you can actually enjoy better graphics with the high end ones until Wine catches up to this graphic technologies.\n\n\n*Will games with DX10 or DX11 work out of the box. Right now the answer is NO, they will not. Will they work in the future, Yes. The speed at which Wine has shown to be inn development suggest it so. Specially for the latest games and DirectX 10/11 support.\n\n\n*The amount of games that are working out of the box (Great graphic games in this case) have exponentially grown in the last year alone. This gives you an idea on how things will look at the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013 for Wine. To give you a background idea, I played in Wine Deep Space 2, 3 days after it officially launched. I was not even thinking that it would work and here I was amazed how everything work great from the first time. I also managed to play Dishonored a day after release without any problems. Others like Portal 2, Skyrim and Trine 1 & 2 are playable with no problems.\n\n\n*Wine does not only focus on one app at a time but also on libraries or DLL. This means that if 100 games use X type of library, they will all benefit from a simple improvement made to it. This is why, when each update of wine comes out, it can change many things regarding one single fix. As an example we can still remember the famous small fix about Mouse and Audio that ended up fixing more than 100+ games.\nPLAYONLINUX - PoL for short, works with Wine side by side. They try (in a very efficient way) to make it so that when you install a program/game it will work out of the box. they might use an old wine version that works perfect for a particular game or they might add some scripts, additional dlls or files to make the game work. PoL does not need Wine installed but it would be wise to have it install just the same. You can find the latest version in here.\nFor example installing a game with Wine might make you do several additional steps to make it work. With PoL is just one click away, PoL will take care that the game installs and works as it should by adding a layer that reads what program or game you are installing and running a script to make sure that all DLLs and additional components that application needs are installed (For example DirectX or .NET). That is what PoL is aiming at, for you to \"Play On Linux\". Note that it is based on the technology that Wine offers.  It actually updates itself rather fast in comparison to add new installer scripts.\nMany of this apps can be found in the long list of supported apps.\nWith that said, PoL does not do anything out of this world that Wine does not have, for example translating DX11 to OpenGL. This would be more in the area of Wine.\nWhat I would recommend as I normally do it, is to do some Testing with several games and help the Wine community with your feedback. By doing this you would be speeding up the process for that particular game to work correctly.\nCODEWEAVERS CROSSOVER\nThis is similar to PoL but it is paid. You actually get a lot of support and there is even a neat Top List of most voted apps\nSTEAM\nThe move by Valve to offer steam on Linux (Specially in Ubuntu) just goes to show the potential Linux is having over gaming. I should also mention that Valve is not the only one looking into developing games for Ubuntu. Many other are also looking this way as an alternative to Windows (Specially Windows 8).\nI have even created a youtube channel at https://youtube.com/@xtremelinux showcasing the power of Steam (Proton, DXVX, Vulkan Support, Hardware Support) and sites like https://www.protondb.com/ promoting a community understanding of a particular game, along with companies like Feral working on native Linux game migrations.\nNVIDIA / INTEL / ATI\nEven graphics card companies are focusing more and more on enhancing their performance on Linux. With the huge jumps we have had so far gaining after every update a significant performance boost.\nUBUNTU\nTo top it off. The performance that Ubuntu has received over every version since Unity came out has been positive. For each new release, Unity has consumed less resources, has had less bugs and has improved performance to the point of becoming excellent for playing any games, based on Wine or native like Steam.\nThe performance many users have noticed in 12.04, then again in 12.10 and even more in 13.04 is just a small example of where Unity is heading and what kind of enhancements we can expect to receive, not only for Graphics performance but for a more general one. I for one have taken many evaluations over the resource usage and video performance since 11.10 and for each new version, specially since 12.04, the resource usage has started to drop significantly and the FPS count has gone up.\nTested a couple of days ago was Dead Space 3 & Dishonored with both DLC contents. I was amazed at the fact that both worked flawlessly and they detected my video card, CPU and memory correctly. I could select the highest possible video configurations and play perfectly.\nUBUNTU PERFORMANCE\nI have to tell you, when it came out, Unity was possibly the worst DE for gaming. It was bloated, heavy and crashed a lot. But it had an objective set forth and a way of working that was great for many productive tasks. The improvements over each new version brought many changes to the Unity DE to a point that for each new version, the end user could actually see many enhancements and performance fixes.\n12.04 marked such an improved point where many end users that criticized Unity were overwhelmed by the functionality and the speed of Unity. It is from this version on that I will show some benchmarks that I feel should be pointed out to give an idea of how Unity stands in gaming. So Here are several links (Chronologically Ordered) about Unity's performance:\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 - Unity 5.2\n\n\n*Ubuntu 12.10 (Before Compiz Upgrade) - Unity 6.4\n\n\n*Windows 7 Vs Ubuntu 12.10\n\n\n*Ubuntu 13.04 Beta - Unity 6.6\n\n\n*OS X vs 13.04\n\n\n*Windows 7, 8 vs Ubuntu 12.10, Ubuntu 13.04\n\n\n*Ubuntu Performance from 8.04 to 13.04\nI added the 2 Windows Performance links to prove a point. If you look at the benchmarks you will see that there are jumps between the performance in 12.10 and 13.04. Many fixes and enhancements done to Unity/Compiz have given Unity the edge when it comes to 3D.\nAnd Note that all of this benchmarks are using Unity from the 6.x Series. The one in 13.04 right now is the 7.x Series. There are also some very awesome patches that will be arriving to 13.04 in the coming weeks that will further lower the memory usage, cpu usage\nand boost the graphics performance. Additionally, here are some answer that will help you when Performance or Compatibility is an issue:\n\n*\n\n*Any way to check the clock speed of my processor?\n\n\n*How do I install the Nvidia drivers?\n\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu alongside a pre-installed Windows with UEFI?\nUBUNTU STATS\nBut why so much focus from Steam and other companies. Well, many surveys have been conducted and in most (If not all) have shown that most Linux users, use Ubuntu or a derivative from it. As the latest G+ Poll shows, with a total of 14000+ votes so far, most users us Ubuntu (More than 50%) and most use the Unity desktop (More than 50%). This gives an idea to gaming companies where to focus, in what DE to work on and how to adapt their game to this emerging gaming platform.\nTIPS - There are several tips I can leave for anybody that reads this related to Wine, Wine usage, configuration and hints in general for anybody new or old, this are:\nHow do I install Half-Life 1 and 2? - Covers Winetricks\nAdjusting resolution for individual Wine programs - Handle several apps (Different Windows/Resolutions).\nFor some of the ones I can vouch that are working after testing them in at least 3 computers with the correct hardware requirements (Including updates and DLC) are:\n\n*\n\n*Far Cry & Far Cry 2\n\n*Dead Island & Dead Island: Riptide\n\n*Dishonored\n\n*Hitman 1...4 (Blood Money)\n\n*Trine & Trine 2\n\n*GTA3, VC & SA\n\n*Dead Space 1...3\n\n*World of Warcraft\n\n*Elder Scrolls 3...5\n\n*Penumbra Collection\n\n*And many more...\nHope this helps and gives you an idea of how things are moving.\n\nA: I am the maintainer of two games on Wine HQ.

You can log into the web interface at the following address, substitute the hostname for your machine of course:\n\"http://hostname/MAAS\"\nthis step.. I installed ubuntu 12.04 via vmware on my windows 7 . Can anyone help how to access this step . and where to write this ? in my browser it says but when i write to my browser it doesnt opens .\n\nA: The hostname is the IP address of the machine MAAS is installed on. In the terminal on the MAAS machine run ifconfig and find the IP address for that device. Then replace hostname above with the IP address.\n\nA: I got mine to work by opening the port for the MAAS webpage in my firewall. MAAS seems to automatically set to the webpage at localhost:5240/MAAS using port 5240 which may not be open on your firewall if your firewall is enabled. At the time I was using the ufw firewall so I used the following command on the server to open the port: \nsudo ufw allow 5240\n\nIf you are running at different firewall you will have to open up the port for that firewall. \nHowever if you are still using the ufw firewall enter the following command\nsudo ufw verbose\n\nIf your firewall is active you should see something like this \nStatus: active\n\nTo                         Action      From\n--                         ------      ----\n\n5240                       ALLOW       Anywhere  \n5240                       ALLOW       Anywhere  \n\nAt this point you can see that the ports are open to your LAN. (If you want to reach your MAAS web page outside of your LAN you will have to do some port forwarding with your router. This may also however come at the cost of security).\nAt this point try to connect to the web page with your client using your localhost IP. (you can find the ip of your server using the command ifconfig and searching for the IP next to inet addr)\nIf you want to see if it works on a text browser first you can install the lynx browser for Ubuntu and type in the g command to insert the server URL\nsudo apt-get install lynx\n\nEither way insert this into the browser you choose and you should be able to login \nhttp://localhostIP:5240/MAAS\n\nIf none of this works check out the page below and search for \"Can’t find MAAS webpage\"\nhttps://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/troubleshooting.html\n", "Q: Couldn't update Ubuntu 8.04, apt-get update fails \nPossible Duplicate:\nInstalling packages to end-of-lifed Ubuntu editions? \n\nI am using Ubuntu 8.04 and I want to update it ,but it failed \nroot@ubuntu:~# apt-get update\nIgn cdrom://Ubuntu 8.04.4 _Hardy Heron_ - Release i386 (20100121.1) hardy/main Translation-en_US\nIgn cdrom://Ubuntu 8.04.4 _Hardy Heron_ - Release i386 (20100121.1) hardy/restricted Translation-en_US\n37% [Connecting to archive.ubuntu.com (91.189.91.25)] [Connecting to security.u^37% [Connecting to archive.ubuntu.com (91.189.91.25)] [Connecting to security.u^37% [Connecting to archive.ubuntu.com (91.189.91.25)] [Connecting to security.ubuntu.com (91.189^Err http://security.ubuntu.com hardy-security Release.gpg                                       \n  Could not connect to security.ubuntu.com:80 (91.189.92.166), connection timed out [IP: 91.189.92.166 80]\nErr http://security.ubuntu.com hardy-security/main Translation-en_US                            \n  Unable to connect to security.ubuntu.com http: [IP: 91.189.92.166 80]\nErr http://security.ubuntu.com hardy-security/restricted Translation-en_US                      \n  Unable to connect to security.ubuntu.com http: [IP: 91.189.92.166 80]\nErr http://archive.ubuntu.com hardy Release.gpg       ^[[15~                            \n  Could not connect to archive.ubuntu.com:80 (91.189.91.13), connection timed out [IP: 91.189.91.13 80]\nErr http://archive.ubuntu.com hardy/main Translation-en_US\n  Unable to connect to archive.ubuntu.com http: [IP: 91.189.91.13 80]\nErr http://archive.ubuntu.com hardy/restricted Translation-en_US\n  Unable to connect to archive.ubuntu.com http: [IP: 91.189.91.13 80]\nErr http://archive.ubuntu.com hardy-updates Release.gpg\n  Unable to connect to archive.ubuntu.com http: [IP: 91.189.91.13 80]\nErr http://archive.ubuntu.com hardy-updates/main Translation-en_US\n  Unable to connect to archive.ubuntu.com http: [IP: 91.189.91.13 80]\nErr http://archive.ubuntu.com hardy-updates/restricted Translation-en_US\n  Unable to connect to archive.ubuntu.com http: [IP: 91.189.91.13 80]\nReading package lists...

Configuring authentication for mail relay is difficult (well, not so much with a good doc) and you probably don't need it. Just remove the following line (or similar) from your main.cf:\nrelayhost = [smtp.strato.de]:587\n\nRestart postfix and it should work\n\nA: To properly send and receive email for your domain you will need to have a DNS MX Record. This record verifies a domains email server.\nWithout that record, sending email won't work most of the time, because most servers check the MX record from incoming servers and refuse to accept email without a valid record (they check the ip address of the incoming server with the DNS entry).\nOf course your domain needs to be properly setup in your postfix config too and you should make sure only to accept email for your domain (otherwise you might be an open relay server).\nThese two facts are utterly important, so that your email server will be accepted by other email servers and is allowed to send your email.\nAlso if you are an open relay and spam ge's send over your server, you might get blacklisted quickly and then your server is dead, no matter what. To get it off the list again will be a hard thing to do. So do be careful.\nOh and BTW....\nYou were trying to use strato as a relay server, which won't work. You can only send emails as(with) a strato user (account) with a valid password.\nAnd still if you have an account with strato and a valid password, emails would be send with/from your strato account, not your own domain account.\n", "Q: how to install rtl8187 driver on Ubuntu 12.04 I tried to install this driver and keeps giving me errors I don't understand!!\nhere is the log on Aircrack's driver

How do I install Ubuntu beside Windows using \"Something Else\"? Whenever I startup from the LinuxLive USB, and try to install Ubuntu 12.04, it only gives me two options instead of the usual 3 or 4. My options are \"Replace Windows 7 with Ubuntu\" and \"Something Else\". Whenever I go into \"Something else\", it looks extremely confusing. How do I install it side-by-side while using the \"Something else\" section? These are my partitions. \n/dev/sda\n/dev/sda1 ntfs (104Mb, System Required Partition)\n/dev/sda2 ntfs (1000097Mb, Windows 7 Partition)\n\nOr should I try reinstalling my installer on a CD rather than USB and maybe then it will have the \"Install alongside\" function?\n\nA: For \"something else\", this link is quite helpful. How to use manual partitioning during installation?\nTo summarize, a few points to remember:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create partition for root, / (the size is the total free space minus size for swap);\n\n*Create partition for SWAP (the size is at least the size of RAM);\n\n*Make sure you have an EFI partition which is usually there if your PC is pre-installed with Windows 8;\n\n\nThis link provide a detailed partition setup. Thanks to the contributors there.\n\nA: Usually, Ubuntu's installer gives you the option to shrink your Windows partition and install alongside it. In your case, that option did not appear. This sometimes happens, and possible causes include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows was hibernated rather then shut down.\n\n*Windows was not properly shut down. (Perhaps there was a power failure, or it bluescreened last time it ran?)\n\n*The Windows partition is damaged, and should be fixed with chkdsk in Windows.\n\n*The Windows partition is too full to be shrunk.\n\n*The Windows partition cannot be shrunk because the files in it are too badly fragmented, preventing them from being constrained to exist only within the new boundaries.\n\n*The Windows partition cannot be shrunk because of immovable files near the boundary.\n\n*The drive has been formatted as a \"Windows Dynamic Disk\" - Ubuntu can not be installed on a Dynamic Disk, you will need to convert the drive to a Basic Disk.\n\n\nSince you're running Windows 7 (this also applies to Windows Vista, and to the corresponding Server versions, and will apply to Windows 8 as well), you can try to shrink the Windows partition using Windows, and then try again to install Ubuntu.\nTo do this, right click My Computer (sometimes just Computer) on the desktop or Start Menu in Windows and click Manage. Go to Disk Management.\n(Alternatively, enter diskmgmt.msc into the text box in the Start Menu and press enter.)\nThen you can use Disk Management to attempt to shrink your Windows partition. It will schedule the operation for when the system is shut down, so that even files that are in use when the system is running can be moved.\nHowever, system files marked immovable still usually will not be moved in this way. So you may need to disable hibernation, and even disable swap (i.e., the page file), in order to make this succeed. (You can re-enable them afterwards.)\nAs Mitch says, it's advisable to ensure all backups of documents and other important files are current, before dynamically resizing a partition (no matter how you do it).\n\nA: You don't have an empty space(partition) to install Ubuntu.  Try to shrink your partition, or use Wubi.  If you decide to resize your partition to create an empty partition for Ubuntu, Take a look at this.  \nI would recommend Wubi, that gives you the ability to play with Ubuntu, since it installs just like any other windows application.\nOnce you have an empty space (partition), and you want to explore the Something Else option, Take a look at my answer here\nNOTE: When dealing with partitions, always make sure that a backup is available in case something goes wrong.\nKeep in mind that anytime you deal with partitions, there is risk involved in doing so.\n\nA: What you have to do is -\nallocate the complete hard drive space to windows. After allocating use Disk Management to free some space (in which you want to install ubuntu) from allocated space . Then reboot the system and when you will try to install ubuntu then it will show you the option \"Install ubuntu alongside Windows boot manager\".\n\nA: Try to read the Ubuntu Install guide. There are steps by step instructions on the \"Something else\" option.\nIn a Nutshell: Because you have Windows installed on the entire hdd, you will need to resize your /dev/sda2 partition to make some free space for Ubuntu.\ncheers, and good luck.\n", "Q: Can claws mail or sylpheed sync gmail contacts? I don't mean importing manually, but true syncing?\nIf not, is there Ubuntu software which syncs gmail contacts separately, and then the above clients sync from that?\n\nA: Claws Mail cannot directly sync gmail contacts.\nThere is the GData plugin which periodically pulls in GMail contacts, and adds them to Claws Mail's address completion list. That means that even though they're still not in the addressbook, they are available in address tab-completion when composing emails, or in filtering based on address book.\nIt's not a real sync, but it's something that happens automatically in the background, so it might be more comfy than a manual import. Personally, I added an action in Claws Mail to open GMail contacts in a browser, and I just use that instead of the built-in addressbook.\n(Full disclosure: I wrote that plugin.)\n", "Q: How can I install boost-devel in Ubuntu 12.04?

I want to take care to not disturb anything on my Windows 7 system drive (\"C\") or any of my four data drives.\n\nA: We have an excellent guide & video on installing ubuntu to an external hard drive or usb device.\nI have copied & pasted the main details below, but it may be clearer & and easier using the link & video as follows.\nHave a look at this link to my personal website for more details & a video. \n**\nHow To Install Ubuntu To A Usb Drive\nWe recommend using a live CD/DVD and unplugging any other USB drives as this makes life easier.\nWe will assume that you are using an unpartitioned Usb drive and CD/DVD for this guide.   \nInsert the Ubuntu live CD/DVD, switch on the computer, and tell it to boot from CD/DVD using your 'Bios'.\nIt will take a couple of minutes to load and you will be presented with two choices.\n'Try Ubuntu' or 'Install Ubuntu', you should select 'Install Ubuntu'\nYou will then be presented with a number of options.\nYou need to select the bottom option 'Something Else'\nThis will bring you to the partitioning menu.  \nYour Primary hard drive will be listed as 'Sda' followed by any partitions that are on it like Sda1 or Sda2.\nBelow this will be your usb drive, it will be listed as 'Sdb'.\nClick on 'Sdb1' which is the only partition on the drive and select 'change'.\nYou need to select 'use this partition as Ext4 File System'\n(some distributions such as Mint reqiure you to manually select 'format' at this point)\nThen you need to set the 'mount point' as '/' which is the root file system and click ok.\nYou will be taken back to the previous menu and that partition will have a tick next to it.\nNow click on 'Sdb' just above that partition, this selects it as the device to install to.\nNow just below is an option for where the bootloader is to be installed.\nIt is VERY IMPORTANT that you CHANGE THIS OPTION.\nTHE BOOTLOADER MUST BE INSTALLED TO YOUR DEVICE listed as '/dev/Sdb'\nIf you do not do this the bootloader will be installed to your internal drive.\nYou are now ready to install to your external device, simply click 'Install' \nYou will need to answer a few simple questions like 'name' and 'create password', then you can sit back and relax.\nAdditional Information\nYou will need to tell your bios to boot from the Usb device each time you want to use it.\nYou can easily set USB as your first boot device in the bios, and your normal system will load if the device is not connected.\nDo not be surprised if your Usb installation takes 3 or 4 minutes to fully boot, especially when using a cheap Usb memory stick.\nIf you choose to install from a usb drive instead of CD/DVD, or you have multiple hard drives and Usb drives connected you need to make sure you are installing to the correct device, as it may not be sdb.\nThe easiest way to ensure that you are installing to the correct device is to use disk utility.\nOpen disk utility before connecting the device and note the devices on the left.\nThen connect your device and it should appear at the bottom of the list.\nClick on that device and look at the top right of the window for 'Device'.\nIt will say something like 'Device :    dev/sdc' and so 'sdc' would be the device you need to install to.**\n", "Q: apt package for 11.04 for Python 2.7.3? I want to upgrade Python on my 11.04 server from Python 2.7.1 to Python 2.7.3.  I assumed that if I did an apt-get install Python2.7 that 2.7.3 would have automatically been available and would have updated.  But instead I get:\n$ sudo apt-get install python2.7 \npython2.7 is already the newest version.\n\nIs there a different repository I need to get it from?  Or is it not ported to 11.04?  I want some education on which packages and versions are available for previous Ubuntu versions.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the latest version of the python2.7 package available in the Natty repositories is 2.7.1-5.\n2.7.3 is only officially available for Precise 12.04.  You would have to compile this yourself for 11.04, or search for a PPA containing it.\nTo find out the latest version of a package available for a specific release, simply go to:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/release-name/package-name\n\nwhere the release-name is natty, oneiric, etc.\nTo find out all available versions of a specific package and the releases they correspond to, look at:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=package-name\n\nor at:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/package-name\n\n", "Q: Removing a directory named after a file I've been looking for a code snippet to place in a .sh that removes a directory named after a file.\nWhat I mean by this is I would like to move to specify a directory and then search it for a list of files of type \".XXX\" and then remove any subdirectories (with contents) with the same name. \nPseudo code of what i want to do:\nfind names all files of type .XXX within a directory\nfind and remove all subdirectories with names that equal the file names found\n\nHow would one best go about this? I have been looking at the find function, which I will be using before this function to unrar archives:\n`find . -name \"*.rar\" -exec unrar x '{}' \\;`\n\n\nA: What's not very clear here is that you can't have a file and a directory with the same name. Also, since you mention uncompressing rar files, one could think that you want to remove the directory named after the rar file. This is strange because, why would you want to delete it after you uncompressed it?\nBased on my poor understanding of the problem (which may improve if you clarify or, better yet, provide an example), this may work:\nfor i in *rar; do\n    (cd uncompressed && rm -rf $i)\ndone\n\nso if you have something like\n./file1.rar\n./file2.rar\n./file3.rar\n./uncompressed/file1.rar/...\n./uncompressed/file2.rar/...\n./uncompressed/file3.rar/...\n\nthe mini-script I posted should delete all the file*.rar/ subdirectories under uncompressed.\n\nA: If you wish to find all directories d, there d contains a file d.xyz. Then this will find the directories for you. \nfind . -type d -print0 |\nxargs -0 --replace={} --max-args=1 bash -c 'find {} -maxdepth 1 -name $(basename {}).xyz -print0' |\nxargs -0 --replace={}  bash -c 'echo $(dirname {})'\n\nexplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*find all files of type directory that are descendants of current working directory\n\n*then for each directory d (and strictly one at a time), that has direct children who's name is d.xyz \n\n*print the directory name\n\n\nA: Create a shell script like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nrm -rf $(dirname $1)/$(basename $1 .$2)\n\nAnd use the following to find files and remove the directories:\nfind . -name \"*.XXX\" -exec /path/to/script {} XXX \\;\n\nReplace XXX with the extension you want to search.  \nWhat the script does:\n\n\n*\n\n*First parameter is the path of a file.  \n\n*Second parameter is the extension you're searching.  \n\n*dirname receives a path and returns the directory where the file is located.  \n\n*basename receives a path and returns the file name and optionally removes a suffix, in this case the extension.  \n\n\nfind passes to the script the path to the compressed file searched and the extension searched, e.g. /path/to/script /home/user/test/file1.rar rar.\ndirname $1 expands to dirname /home/user/test/file1.rar which returns /home/user/test, basename $1 expands to basename /home/user/test/file1.rar rar which returns file1. Putting it all together the script executes rm -rf /home/user/test/file1.\n", "Q: How can I get Unity to show the menu icons in Inkscape? I use Ubuntu 12.04 and I have enabled icons in menus.

How can I make it restart automatically after it crashed?\n\nA: First off, I'm not using docky. But I'm assuming docky is in your $PATH. If not, then specify the full path to the binary.\nHere is the awesome use of Bash:\nStart off with a file, such as (vim instead of gedit if you want):\n\n\n*\n\n*gedit ~/process_monitor.sh\n\n*Type the following:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ -z \"$1\" ]];then\n    echo \"ERROR: must specify program\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nwhile (( 0 == 0 ));do\n    $@ &\n    pid=`jobs -l | awk '{print $2}'`\n    wait $pid\ndone\n\n\n*Save the file.\n\n*Set the permission:\nchmod a+x ~/process_monitor.sh\n\nNow you can run a program like so:\n~/process_monitor.sh docky\n\nand it'll launch the program once, and make sure to restart the program if you ever choose to quit it or it chooses to crash.\nTo add an entry to system startup so it launches the program once you logged in and won't stop until you quit, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Unity Dash, type and look for \"Startup Applications\"\n\n*Click Add\n\n*Name: Docky or whatever you like\n\n*Command: /bin/bash ~/process_monitor.sh docky\n\n*Comment: Whatever you like\n\n\nMake sure the new entry is checked.

(He reported it in this forum in https://askubuntu.com/questions/88365/cenon-will-not-open-or-run about 6 months ago.)\nI imagine that either the dependencies in the package are not complete, or perhaps the code is misinterpreting some signal it has gotten.\nI'd be glad to install some more software to see if that helps (and provides enough information for the package maintainer to fix it).\nThanks in advance for any info!\ndan\nPOSTSCRIPT!\nSo, i already have egg on my face, i guess.\nIn fact, the alert panel does come up, but it turns out that i can just close it and proceed.\nHowever, there still seems to be some problem in running the application.\nThe menus don't show up in the right places, sometimes.\nSo, for example, if i click to open the files submenu, it may line up with the main menu, but sometimes it doesn't.

By default, it does not remove directories.\n\n   If a file is unwritable, the standard input is a tty,  and  the  -f  or\n   --force  option is not given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove\n   the file.

It will take some time to download. I did it a while ago, but it was not easily repeatable for other sites so I'll just give you the link here. (Even though flashgot did NOT work this time, it does often work for downloading flash videos, so that's quite a good firefox add on to use in general.)\nHow I did it in this case (may NOT work for other flash streams):\n You need to have the noscript addon for firefox installed for the following to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*With no script blocking all js and flash (as default for unvisited sites), go to the site- e.g. http://liveweb.arte.tv/fr/video/Gonzalo_Bergara_Quartet_Festival_Django_Reihnardt/\n\n*Now mouse over the blocked flash plugin, which gives away the server they are using, which is download.liveweb.arte.tv in this case\n\n*With this knowledge, go to google and do site:download.liveweb.arte.tv jazz or another search term.\n\n*Then when you find the link you want, go to the google cache page instead of the actual live page.\n\n*Then, make sure arte.tv and googleusercontent are allowed in the drop down noscript menu, but everything else is blocked, and you should be able to mouse hover over the disabled video plugin and copy the link.\n\n\nResults may vary for different videos from the same page (http://www.my-jazzlive.tv for example). But is possible that when reaching the cache page, more usual ways of downloading may become available, like Flashgot: so keep an eye on Flashgot Media button!\n\nWhether this will work for other sites is anyone's guess!\n\nA: The link you gave as an example is not from arte-tv,  nor arte live web but from  http://www.my-jazzlive.tv, which may contain files that are not any more on arte live web despite the logo on the image.

Alternatively you can modify the boot menu via Control Panel > System > Advanced > Startup and Recovery and pressing \"Edit\". For Windows 98 you have to edit C:\\config.sys and remove the Wubi block. For Windows Vista/7, you can use the built-in bcdedit command or install EasyBCD to edit the boot menu. To use bcdedit, run cmd.exe as an administrator, then enter bcdedit to show all boot entries, note the {GUID} specified for the Ubuntu entry, and then remove it: bcdedit /delete {GUID}\nTo remove Wubi from the add/remove list, delete the registry key: HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\Wubi\nAn easy method of removing this registry key is to paste the following text into a plain editor such as Notepad, close and save the file as something like removeWubiKey.reg (you may wish to go to Folder Options > View and disable the \"Hide file extensions for known file types\" option to check that the .reg extension has been applied correctly). Then you can perform the rest automatically by opening the file in the normal Windows manner, or choosing the \"Merge\" option from the right click context menu. Note: The formatting is rather strict, so copy the text exactly for best results. You may need to be logged in as the administrator to delete the key, depending on the version of Windows you are using.

However, they are both recognizing the same swap partition, and when I boot into Lubuntu after hibernating my Ubuntu installation, it tries to load from swap and all HELL breaks loose.\nSo I want to try to make Lubuntu stop recognizing the swap partition. This is a quad core machine, and Swap really isn't needed with LXDE.\n\nA: *\n\n*Press Alt+F2 and type: gksudo gedit /etc/fstab; enter password when prompted\n\n*Find a line like the following:\n\n# swap was on /dev/sda6 during installation\nUUID=adc15cab-1cd4-4278-9a1d-59016cced6dd none      swap  sw    0       0\n\n\n*Comment out the UUID= line by adding a # in front of it. Save and exit.\n\n*Lubuntu will no longer attempt to use that swap partition.\n\n", "Q: Why is downloading repository updates so slow?

You could easily convert your videos with ffmpeg, but if you don't want to do it (why?), you have probably only one alternative: vnc2flv.\nThere are a couple of requirements (they could be easily installed from official repos):\n1) x11vnc\n2) Python (2.4+)\nDownload the package from the developer at http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/vnc2flv/index.html#install, extract the archive and (as the developer explains on his site), use python to install the app as:\npython setup.py install\n\nAnd you're done.

I have read and tried everything that I can find and I am still having issues logging in. I have Ubuntu 11.10 that I have put on my machine a couple of weeks ago and I still cannot log in. It says invalid password.\nSo I have tried to reboot and reset. I have even tried to remount.\nWhat am I doing wrong? I am a beginner trying to learn and I am not sure why I can not sign in.\n\nA: You said you've reset the password and the problem still occurs, so presumably the problem isn't that you're entering it incorrectly. A few possible causes come to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Maybe you are not using the right keyboard layout when entering your password. You can choose your keyboard layout at the graphical login screen by clicking the keyboard icon in the bar at the top. A drop-down menu will come up, showing the available keyboard layouts. (There might just be one, but if you have more than one set up, you can select between them.)\n\n*Maybe your password contains unusual characters that are not being handled properly. If your password contains characters other than upper and lower case letters, numbers, and punctuation present on US-English keyboards (~!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]\\{}|;':\"<>?,./`), try resetting the password again, this time to something limited to those characters. (You don't have to use all those types of characters if you don't want to, though your password should be long or complex enough that it's very hard to guess.)\n\n*Maybe something is going wrong when you reset your password. If you edit your question to include a detailed description of how you're resetting your password, a link to the procedure you are following to do so, or both, then it may be possible to assess this.\nFurthermore, if it turns out you mean something else by \"reset\" than resetting your password, then that is very relevant. In that case, you should reset your password using one of these methods or (as suggested by tijybba), this method.\n\nIf you get Authentication token manipulation error when changing your password in recovery mode and you cannot fix it with mount -o remount,rw /, changing the password by chrooting from a live environment will still almost always work. I strongly recommend trying that.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Ubuntu as speaker while playing music from a bluetooth-linked smartphone?

I have a Asus M4N68T motherboard that does not support AHCI. Bootup takes a lot longer than expected and working in the system is not even close to an option. Is this an AHCI issue or is there something else I can try and do?\n\nA: Unfortunately AHCI is needed.  You need to make sure your SATA controller is set to AHCI mode (you can do so in your BIOS). AHCI is needed for TRIM support, and to get the maximum performance out of an SSD. \nTRIM support does help maintain the highest performance of an SSD.  It’s recommended to run your SSD in AHCI mode to enable TRIM to do its job.\n\nA: Please read up about what AHCI is before claiming that AHCI is not supported by your motherboard:\n\nThe Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) is a technical standard defined by Intel that specifies the operation of Serial ATA (SATA) host bus adapters in a non-implementation-specific manner.\n[...]\nOperating modes - Many SATA controllers offer selectable modes of operation: legacy Parallel ATA emulation, standard AHCI mode, or vendor-specific RAID (which generally enables AHCI in order to take advantage of its capabilities). Intel recommends choosing RAID mode on their motherboards (which also enables AHCI) rather than AHCI/SATA mode for maximum flexibility. Legacy mode is a software backward-compatibility mechanism intended to allow the SATA controller to run in legacy operating systems which are not SATA-aware or where a driver does not exist to make the operating system SATA-aware.\n\nInfact every motherboard that comes with SATA connectors supports AHCI. I looked up the manual for your motherboard, there may not be an option for choosing the AHCI operation mode. Which is perfectly fine, it just means that SATA drives can not be switched into Parallel ATA emulation mode.\nThere are a few BIOS Updates available:\nM4N68T-M BIOS 0501 (2009.12.31  update)\nSupport new flash type\nNote: Users can not flash bios back to former version after update bios version 0501 or later.\n\nM4N68T-M BIOS 1004 (2010.07.08  update)\nUpdate AGESA to V3.7.0.1\n\nI would suggest updating the BIOS to the latest available firmware, if that does not help buy a new motherboard.\n", "Q: Chrome versus Firefox - which is better? Perhaps this is not the best title to use, but I'm running 12.04, which I always update. I'm not sure if it is just my impression, but is Chrome really buggy? I generally use the latest updated version. That's my browser of choice, but it seems to drain my resources and I resorted to Firefox instead.\nAny information/comments?\n\nA: This is the kind of question more applicable to fora - you'll be getting a lot of radical posts :)\nAnyway, I find Chrome slightly buggy, and in general that Firefox works much better than Chrome on Ubuntu, even speed-wise. And it is completely open-source, updates very often (next three versions all coming this year with loads of new features), and has all the add-ons you could possibly need. I myself was a Chrome-fan till a few months back, and, well, I'm not turning back. If you like Chrome's looks (like me), you can get all of them by using the right themes (Chrome-FX) and add-ons. You can even get downloads to open in a new tab, put downloads in the status bar, anything. It is also much more customizable, even if you don't use the about:config page.\nOne more thing I notice is that, on Ubuntu (but not Windows), having many add-ons slows Chrome down, but not Firefox.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 installation issue I have HP Pavilion g6 laptop. I tried installing ubuntu on it. i successfully downloaded the image and copied it to disc. now i do not understand how to run the setup while my laptop do not boot from that disc. Please help me.\n\nA: As said by the posters above, check first you've burned the ISO to the disc, not copied it. Otherwise on HP laptops you may have to choose the boot order (on mine I did it by pressing Escape right at startup) and select your CD/DVD Rom Drive so that it boots from the CD rather than your already existing Hard Drive.\nAlternatively as pointed out by msPeachy:\nI've been installing different versions for the past week and I've found running the installation off a USB worked fine for me, if you want to give it a try just get the ISO which you've already got from what I've read and use: \nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ \nMake sure your USB is free to be reformatted and has enough space (anything on it will be deleted) and leave it plugged in, once you restart your computer you should have an option at some point to access the boot menu (on my HP pavillion it was \"Esc\" and there you choose to Boot from your USB instead of your hard drive) \nAlso I'd suggest you change the Boot Order in the Boot Menu and not the Bios Setup so that once you've restarted your Laptop with Ubuntu, you don't have to change it back (otherwise your laptop will try restart from a USB everytime). This is just my experience on my HP pavillion, suppose it'd be similar for you. \n", "Q: Cups is always asking for password when printing on a certain printer When I send print to a network printer (HP Laserjet 2200d), CUPS asks for username/password.

There is a firefox addon, called:\nSaved Password editor\nAfter filling in password and username, you can simply rightclick in the filed and choose \"save login data\" like shown here:\n\nIt works for most of the websites who have problems with saving passwords.\nAn alternative is:\nRememberPass\n\nA: Not sure if it works for the JavaScript clearing sites mentionned, but it works for me in Firefox: Edit-Preferences-Security-Click to remember passwords for sites and make sure the websites you want to save passwords for aren't on the Exceptions list and if they are remove them (this might be why you don't get asked to save them in the first place, they might have been placed on the Exceptions list at some point). \n", "Q: Can not compile any C code under Xubuntu I am not a seasoned C programmer, but I compile some C code sometimes.\nThe last time I successfully compiled and run some C code I did it on the same system that I have now (the very same OS on the very same machine, no OS deinstallation/reinstallation happened).

Once this is the case shutdown should continue. \nA possible solution could be to replace the action of the window managers (mostly KDE) shutdown/restart/hibernate buttons by a script which first checks if rsync is active and shows a message if this is the case. But I do not know if this is possible in KDE.\n\nA: Try making a script to enable and disable shutdown then move the executable elsewhere then in its place put a script that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disables shutdown\n\n*Runs the program\n\n*Enables shutdown\n\n\nSee How to disable shutdown/reboot/suspend/hibernate?.\n\nA: I recently solved a similar problem, see https://askubuntu.com/a/617395/368069\nadapted to your questions the answer would be: \nCreate a file /etc/pm/sleep.d/00-check-rsnapshot.

Should I reinstall? In the meantime, are any files that I have at risk?\n\nA: From what you seem to have posted such as: \n\n\n*\n\n*computer freezes often for no apparent reason and has to be rebooted\n\n*upon reboot, message appears saying \"errors were found when checking disk drive for '/'\"\n\n*documents will not open in libreoffice \nThese make me think that for some reason or other you hard drive is being unmounted from time to time while you're using Ubuntu, it could be a hardware issue such as a faulty connection to your Hard-Drive, however seeing as you also have a:\n\n\n*\n\n*message appears saying that Ubuntu has experienced an internal error, but 'report a problem' program always crashes before completion\n\n\nI'd assume it's more of a software issue, so if I were you I'd back up all of your files in your Ubuntu partition on an external hard drive and reinstall Ubuntu in the same place. A fresh install does the job 99% of the time unless its a hardware issue with your netbook. \nAlso as a precautionary measure, whenever I mess around with Operating Systems and Booting related things I always make a full back-up of all my partitions, might be over the top and I've only every had a \"losing all my files on a partition\" problem once, but when I did have it, I was pretty glad I'd been backing up my files as all I had to do was recopy them into the freshly installed Ubuntu OS. \nSo bottom line, its good practice to back-up regularly (especially if you have bugs with your OS not being able to read files and more worryingly errors concerning the root \"/\") and even moreso if you're installing an OS. But I'd reinstall if I were in your situation, seeing as those bugs could be so many different things and finding a solution to all of them separately could take you a while.\n", "Q: Why does everything keep changing back to root ownership (NTFS)? I've tried EVERYTHING to get my files back into my name, but all I seem to do is add MORE files to Root ownership every time I try to fix things.  \nIt starts with getting my 2 ntfs partitions to mount at startup.  Pysdm will set the partitions to mount, but then it also makes everything owned by root.  I change the ownership, and it just doesn't \"take\".  There's no error messages, the next time I open the program, everything is right back to being owned by Root.  I tried running it with sudo via terminal, and changing it then, but it still didn't take, and seemed to create more permission problems (that I can't remember right now, sorry).  Then I read that using sudo would change the permissions to root on it's own, and I should use gksudo or gksu, and THAT should work, but it did nothing.  \nI reinstalled Ubuntu, and tried just manually editing the fstab file, but that didn't work either.  I kept getting errors on bootup that the partitions couldn't be mounted.  Plus I had weird extra non-existent drives just sitting there all the time.  I'm sure I did something wrong there, but I checked it a MILLION times and everything looked in perfect order.  Those phantom drives where NOT in my fstab file.  \nSO!  I reinstalled Ubuntu AGAIN, and try NTFS-config instead, as recommended.  It mounts my drives, and AGAIN, changes ownership to Root and I can't unmount them if I want.  I try to change it back with CHOWN -hR myname:myname /media/[the drives], and it changed all the ownership of all my FILES to root too.  These files were already owned by me, and with the command to change everything to my name, it changed everything to root.  now I'm really screwed.  \nPerhaps the weirdest:  I tried accessing Nautilus with sudo AND gksu, and when I try to change the permission with the gui, by right clicking and changing the ownership and group, I select my name from the menu, it shows my name for a second, and then IMMEDIATELY reverts back to root.  It just won't \"take\" either.  \nWHY!?!?!?!   WHY does everything keep changing to root!?   Why do all my attempts function enough to change the ownership, but only to root and not back? Please help!!!  \n\nA: NTFS partitions do not honor linux permissions. So any permission change done using chmod will not be applied permanently.\nYou have to write an fstab line using options defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000 where uid and gid can be found for your user using command id.\nYou may add this under \"Options\" in pysdm if I'm not mistaken.\nSimilar question:\nHow to write an fstab line for full access to an NTFS drive?\nOn the other hand, you could format the partition to ext2 / ext3 / ext4 and use a browser program in windows, like ext2read: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2read/\nOther options are the ext2/3/4 driver for windows, ext2fsd: http://www.ext2fsd.com/\n\nA: This article solved my issues with NTFS permissions:\nMount NTFS partition at startup, with non-root user as owner\nThe trick was to modify my NTFS drive's mount entry in my /etc/fstab file to use \"ntfs-3g\" with the \"permissions\" and \"users\" options.\nUUID=####    /mnt/MOUNTPOINT    ntfs-3g    defaults,permissions,users    0    0\n\n", "Q: Amazon instant videos stopped working in chrome (I did install HAL) and it works in firefox since last week I can watch Amazon Instant videos only works in firefox but not in chrome, I re-installed hal but still doesn't help . the progress bar goes but it shows black screen video with no sound.\nmy chrome version is Version 20.0.1132.57\nmy ubuntu 12.10 is 64 bit\n\nA: Maybe it's Chrome's bug.

Install ubiquity-frontend-gtk too, if you want the GTK frontend (sudo apt-get install ubiquity-frontend-gtk). Ubiquity can be run by calling ubiquity kde_ui or ubiquity gtk_ui from a terminal. \nI will no try to install as I don't want to have to clean up afterwards.

So while this thread is rather old, it's worth noting that it should now work. If you continue to experience problems with the media keys, then please post a message on the community forums.\n\nA: You can use spotify-notify. Not only does it provide notify-osd notifications, but it also has support for media keys.\n\nA: What distro/desktop environment are you using? I am on XFCE, and there is an issue with the keybinds (I believe XFCE interprets them differently than the other DE's).\nI found a GitHub page giving the solution which worked for me on Ubuntu 17.04 with XFCE: https://gist.github.com/jbonney/5743509\nHere is the steps (explained in a little more detail than the GitHub page): \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings Manager\n\n*Go to Keyboard\n\n*Go to the tab labeled Application Shortcuts\n\n*Click Add\n\n*Based on what keybind you need to add, use these commands\n\n*\n\n*Play/Pause: dbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.spotify /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player.PlayPause\n\n*Stop: dbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.spotify /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player.Stop\n\n*Next: dbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.spotify /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player.Next\n\n*Previous: dbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.spotify /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player.Previous\n\n\n*Then press corresponding key. Each key should bring up a certain code for each. They go as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Play/Pause: XF86AudioPlay\n\n*Stop: XF86AudioStop\n\n*Next: XF86AudioNext\n\n*Previous: XF86AudioPrev\nThis should fix it! This worked for me. You may be able to skip the Stop button, and don't confuse it for the Play/Pause button. I almost did.\nLike I said, I think XFCE has some issue with the keys. I think XFCE interprets XF86AudioPlay because of the XF at the beginning, and Spotify doesn't recognize it. That would make sense because it works in other DE's without issue, but XFCE breaks it without being set up. Either way, this works for me, so I hope it worked for you!\n\nA: Try out Spotify Gnome\n\nSpotify-Gnome is a program that provides Gnome media key support for the Spotify Linux client. It supports the play/pause, stop, next, and previous signals, and is compatible with both Gnome 2 and Gnome 3.\n\n\nA: For people still having this problem: my issue was my Chrome caught all incoming media keys and so they did not reach the Spotify app. You can fix this by going to chrome://flags/#hardware-media-key-handling in the Chrome address bar and setting the Hardware Media Key Handling to Disabled\nBased on\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Windows/Play-Pause-keyboard-button-doesn-t-work-on-Spotify/m-p/4730810/highlight/true#M75206\n\nA: The mulitmedia keys have nothing to do with the sound indicator. Reactions to those keys have to be implemented in spotify itself. I don't think there is a workaround. After all the spotify linux client is still beta so there is hope that this feature will be added in a foreseeable time :-)\n\nA: The latest Spotify snap version supports multimedia keys.

I am going to install Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 64-bit.\n\n*\n\n*I have a 1TB hard disk, 8GB RAM.\n\n*I'd like to have a big partition NTFS to share data between the two operating systems.\n\n*I often use a lot of (big) apps. My Windows partition (C:) will need about 150GB.\n\nWhat partition size should I dedicate for root and home?\n\n*\n\n*/ (??? -> 20GB?)\n\n*/home (??? -> 20GB?)\n\n*/swap (16GB)\n\n*Windows (150GB)\n\n*ShareDriver (NTFS Max Left Space)\n\nIf I install and use a lot of apps, will 20GB be too small for root and /home? Might it become filled up over time?\nI've never used Ubuntu, so I have no idea what amounts are reasonable for my usage.\n\nA: It's difficult to know these things in advance, of course, so even with the best planning you may need to make adjustments later.  However, I'd recommend the following:\nYou won't likely need a swap partition larger than 8 GB.  You have room for it and it won't hurt, but it doesn't make much sense, either, so if I were you I'd keep /swap at 8 GB.\nI've had my root partition at 30 GB for about a year, and I'm still using less than 10 GB of it.  You might install larger programs than I do, so give yourself a buffer: I'd recommend 20 - 30 GB.\nAs for the /home partition, that's where you'll store your data and files, including pictures, videos, projects, etc., whatever sorts of things you store and keep.  I don't what sorts of things you keep, but in my case my pictures take up perhaps the largest share.  Even so, having given myself lots of room (about 300 GB for /home), I have used only about 50 GB.  You'll have to decide for yourself, but since you'll use a large NTFS partition to share data with Windows, you can probably get away with 30 - 60 GB for /home, with the knowledge that you might make adjustments later.\nAs far as space for Windows and its apps, etc., if you think you need 150 GB then that sounds fine.  And the rest NTFS to share?  That's fine, too.  (Eventually you might want to revise that, but it's certainly fine at the beginning.)\nYou didn't say whether or not you already have Windows installed on the drive, but I assume you do.  Windows can sometimes get finicky when being resized.  I would recommend resizing your Windows partition first from within Windows itself using the Windows administrative tools, and then you can create the Ubuntu partitions as you install it.\n\nA: the root can be ~50GB and for win 7 100GB is enough. You can always change this after installing the os you need\n\nA: I've never needed more than 10GB for my root. I install a lot of packages too. To be sure you can give it 15-20gb. Windows 7 with a few applications needs 60-70gb. If you want to install a little more give it 150gb. You said you need this much anyway ;-) For games you'll eventually need a lot more. /home will be for all your personal files so it depends on how much you have. It also stores the properties of applications but that really isn't much. Even 1gb should be enough for those. A rule for swap is twice the RAM size so 16gb are good. If you want to use suspend to disk you need at last as much as you have RAM because it is stored in the swap partition. So for that 8gb will be enough too.\n\nA: If you want to make partition of the hard disk... then follow instructions given below....\n\n\n*\n\n*In Windows 8, on your desktop, right click on computer icon.\n\n*Then, click on 'Manage' so it will open your computer management tab.\n\n*Click on 'Disk Management' now you will see two disks available there.\n\n*Right click on (c:) drive and click on 'Shrink Volume' now you will see the new tab 'shrink C:'\n\n*There all the volumes given in MB. If you want to shrink 250GB then put 250000 into 'Enter the amount of space to shrink in MB' box then click on shrink button.\n\n*After that, you will see your new disk with available space inside the black 'unallocated' box. This available disk space is not usable now.\n\n*Right click on that black box and click on 'New Simple Volume' button. now you will see 'New Simple Volume Wizard' tab.\n\n*Click on 'Next' again click next now assign the drive letter as you want (the letters C & D are used already so these letters are not available there) and click on next button\n\n*Now, in the new tab in 'File System' box make it 'NTFS' and in 'Volume Label' box put name of the disk you want to name that disk(eg. hard disk) and click on next\n\n*Now you see your new disk created successfully. Now enjoy new disk with new space.\n\n", "Q: Various ways of executing binaries and scripts and their differences If <script/binary> is either a script or an executable binary file, which of the following commands can be used to execute it? If there are more than one way, how do they differ?\n$ <script/binary>\n$ ./<script/binary>\n$ sh <script/binary>\n$ source <script/binary>\n$ . <script/binary>\n\nAre there further ways?\n\nA: I'll try to answer my own question.\nExecuting:\n$ file          # when 'file' is on the PATH, or is a built-in\n$ ./file        # when 'file' is in the current directory\n$ /home/me/file\n\nfile, a binary or a script, must have execute permissions set.\nExecute commands in script with specified shell\n$ sh script\n$ bash script\n$ zsh script\n\nSourcing\n$ . script\n$ source script\n\n\nA: Here's a quick listing of commands. Note, when I mention PATH, I mean the directories containing programs that the system knows about; you find those with echo $PATH, and it will be something like: /home/mike/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\nScripts\n\n\n*\n\n*To execute a script in current working directory, use ./myscript.sh\n\n*To execute a script on another file, use (if it is in the current working directory),  ./myscript.sh textfile.txt\n\n*Scripts can also be run with arguments; as explained in Rute (p. 68): myfile.sh dogs cats birds will output The first argument is: dogs, second argument is: cats, third argument is: birds because the content of this script after the shebang is: echo \"The first argument is: $1, second argument is: $2, third argument is: $3\"\n\n*To execute a script in another directory, use ~/Scripts/dogs.sh\n\n*To execute a script that the system knows about because it is in your bin folder in your home directory (just create it if it isn't there, as it will automatically be added to your PATH), just use scriptname\n\n*To execute a script you have installed, again just use its name, because it will be known to the system: for example,  get_iplayer\nBinaries\n\n\n*\n\n*To run a binary that the system knows about because it is in $PATH, use the name of the program and any parameters, for example, vlc <stream url to open>\n\n*To test a binary you have compiled before installing to /usr/local/bin, or to keep a standalone program away from the system, use ~/<folder>/app/myprog\n\nA: The following commands are the same, a dot component means \"current directory\". To allow for being executed, the files need to have executable permissions:\npath/to/binary\n./path/to/binary\n\nNote that if a path does not contain a slash, it is treated as a command (either a shell built-in or a program that is looked up in the $PATH environment variable).\nThe following are almost the same, they execute a shell script (not a binary!) in the current shell environment. A small difference between the two lines are described on this Unix.SE question.\n. path/to/script\nsource path/to/script\n\nFinally you mentioned sh script. Again, this only works for shell scripts and not binaries. You are basically executing the sh program with the script name as argument. In the case of sh, it just treats this argument as shell script and executes it.\nFor answers restricted to shellscripts, see Different ways to execute a shell script.\n", "Q: How to measure desktop login time with bootchart I've got an issue whereby after each reboot the first time I log into my session it takes ages.

I started using Lubuntu (12.04) and I like the customizations that I was able to make, especially fitting icons and themes ('Widgets' - as 'Customize Look and Feel'/LXAppearance calls them.) \nBut for some reason about a half of the themes make my menus display a pale font on a whitish background - and look unclear. So, I am stuck with customizations involving themes that are darker or that otherwise don't lead to this.\nI am aware only of some but important menus that are affected by this, like the Main menus, Right-click context menus of File browsers and the Firefox right-click and drop-down menus. The right click menus of the tray items are not affected, nor the password area, nor other important parts in File browsers or applications, as other people experienced and reported in askubuntu.\nI think the problem is more with the colour of the fonts than with the background and that some small tweak might t solve this. I think lubuntu is not concerned by the issue of compatibility between themes and gtk3.\n\n\n\nA: I found my answer when discovering that (without knowing it) I had installed Gtk+ 2 Theme Change, I selected the same theme there as the one in LXAppearance. \n\n\nHow I exactly got the program I do not recall. Maybe it was installed along with a theme that had an installer or a series of instructions that I followed without taking notice.\nThe issue looks similar to a Qt-related problem which received a similar solution (see the askubuntu question).\nThe rule should be:\nThe theme selected in LXAppearance and that selected in 'Gtk+ 2 Theme Change' has to be the same. \n(The quality of the way folders and fonts are displayed seems to have improved too.)\nWhat happens is that I can set correctly a dark-menu theme just through LXAppearance and I can do the same thing for the light-menu themes in Gtk+ 2 Theme Change. But sometimes it happens that setting a darked menu theme just in the later would make the fonts of the menus as dark as the background. So, the rule applies both ways.   \nThe program is available in Software Sources (search Synaptic for 'Gtk+ 2 Theme Change')\nOn Softpedia here.\nAnd the website of the provider.\nIt is in Software Center\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Authentication failed Ubuntu one fails to authenticate from my new Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit installation but I can access my account from a browser.\nI've tried resetting the password several times and I've also tried reinstalling ubuntu one as per the directions given in the ubuntu one website. \nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: The most likely cause of this is error is the root SSL certificate for valicert.com is not completely installed on your computer.\nPlease open the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T);\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ca-certificates\n\nLogout and login (Restart preferred) and Try UbuntuOne account once more.\nYou may read this page Why am I getting an \"authentication failed\" error?\n", "Q: Cut and Copy in Ubuntu Command line How Could i copy or cut a file from a directory to another directory?\nI mean in command line!\n\nA: Hi here we go with a practical example:\n1.

Install ldap-utils on your client so that you have the ldapsearch tool. Then try ldapsearch -x. This uses simple authentication and if you get results then you can be sure that your ldap server can be queried from the client.\nNext, take a look at your slapd.conf file. Take a close look at the fields binddn and bindpw. You can change the bindpw if you don't remember it. The command to generate an encoded bindpw would be to use slappasswd on your simple text password. After that you can use the command mentioned by Terry Gardner above. \nIf that connects then you can be rest assured that the ldap authentication is working fine. If it doesn't work, then post the error messages, describe the issues you faced and also post your slapd.conf and hopefully, we should be able to provide you a solution. :)\n\nA: I used the official documentation and ended up with similar messages although getent passwd did show LDAP entries in the output.

In MS Office Word, I can insert a worksheet directly from the Insert tab. Is it also possible in Libre Office 3 Writer, that is to insert a worksheet within the program, without the need to open a spreadsheet application?\nThe only method that I know is to launch LibreOffice Calc and select the range of cells, then copy and paste it in LibreOffice Writer.\n\nA: Look at this topic: http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=9981\nThe alternative is to do Insert/Ole Object.\n\nA: Adding a spreadsheet or any other LibreOffice file is easy using OLE Objects.\nHere's How:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Insert→Object→OLE Object.\n\n\n*You will be presented with this dialogue:\n\n\n*As you can see at this point, you have two options, to create a new file, or to use an existing file.\n\n\nUsing a new file:\nIf you choose to create a new file, simply click okay, and you will be presented with a new, embedded file. (See below).\n\nYou can edit this as you normally would, without having to open an instance of Calc.\nUsing an existing file:\nIf you choose to use an existing file, click on the \"Create from file\" radio button. This will present you with some slightly different options:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You can search for a file to use by using the \"Search\" button (it brings up a file dialogue where you can choose a file).\n\n\n\n\n\n*You can use a local copy of the file by leaving the option \"Link to file\" unchecked.  \n\n\n*\n\n*This provides more flexibility, but takes up more space in your file.\n\n\n*If you choose to link to the file:\n\n\n*\n\n*It saves space\n\n*If you move the file, the link will be broken, so keep this in mind.\n\n*For best results, keep the files in the same directory.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, everything else is the same as \"Using a new file\".\nExample with an actual file:\nEditing:\n\nViewing:\n\n", "Q: Cron job not executing I was making a cron job to save my Minecraft world from my ram every 5 minutes.\nI tested the script and it seems to be working.\nThis is what the script looks like: \n#!/bin/sh\n\n\nVOLATILE=\"/home/jonathan/Games/Minecraft/Server/world/\"\nPERMANENT=\"/home/jonathan/Games/Minecraft/Server/world_storage/\"\nrsync -r -t -v \"$VOLATILE\" \"$PERMANENT\"\n\nSo then I went to add a cron job to run the script every 5 minutes, and it doesn't seem to be running it.\nThis is the script I used:\n*/5 * * * * bash /home/jonathan/Games/Minecraft/Server/Backup.sh\n\nCan anyone help me please?\n\nA: You did not specify how you added your cronjob. This makes a big difference: if you've used crontab -e within your own account, scripts are run with your user (and thus the crontab entry has one field less -- the user to run it, as that is known). If you simply copied your above snippet to /etc/cron.d, it would fail as you didn't specify a user (or rather as it finds no user named \"bash\"). So you should take the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*update your question with information concerning how you added the cron job\n\n*check the system logs (/var/log/syslog; they could point to possible errors)\n\n*add some debug output to your Backup.sh script to see whether it is started\n\n\nThe third point can be achieved in multiple ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*add a >>/tmp/testlog.log to the end of your crontab entry (to redirect output to a file you can investigate; additionally, a 2>&1 would include output from the error console)\n\n*add some lines to your script itself, like e.g. echo \"Backup.sh started\">/tmp/testlog.log\nMoreover: As you intend your script to be run using bash, you should not tell it to use /bin/sh (which would make it use dash on a default Ubuntu installation), but rather /bin/bash. Then make it executable, and you can even omit the \"bash\" from your crontab entry.\nUpdate:\nAccording to your comment on my answer, you used crontab -e to create the job, and according to your systems logs it is executed, but the definition is rather\n*/5 * * * * bash /home/jonathan/Games/Minecraft/Server/Backup.sh &>/dev/null\n\nThis redirects all output to the biggest storage in your system, the \"black hole\": /dev/null eats everything (but never returns anything). Redirecting STDOUT as well as STDERR this way robs you of any error report -- so you never know that they happened at all, let alone the details. For testing, you should omit the &>/dev/null part completely. Even if it works, you should only suppress unnecessary output -- as otherwise you never know when something goes wrong. So better leave out the ampersand at least, so Cron can report any occurring errors.\nFurthermore: Once the output is redirected (as in your case to /dev/null), appending another redirect to the end will yield no results, as everything is already gone. So I have to adjust the above advice from \"add ... to the end of your crontab entry\" to \"replace that in your crontab entry\" ;)\n", "Q: Changing my VM to static IP So I'm running a ubuntu virtual machine (using vmware), and I noticed every time I restart my vm, my IP changes, is there a way to set it static? I looked over a few links and they all tell me to change it to static and something about changing the DHCP server to return static IP. Any help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: You need to say how you have configured the virtual network.\nEither the host is supplying the address or, more likely in this case, you have a DCHP server supplying it. \nIn the latter case, firstly you need to identify the DHCP server. For home/small networks, the most common configuration is for your router to be the DHCP server.\nIf that is the case, now we need to know what router you are using as the settings are different for each router.\nOn my own Billion, for example, I have to identify the MAC address of the device who's address I want to fix. Then I need to enter this into a \"fixed host\" setting screen.\nThe virtual mac address can be found on the VM with the command nm-tool. Look for the \"HW Address\" (it is a list of 6 Hex double-digits). Or it can be found in the connection information box (click on the network icon in the top menu bar, select \"Connection Information\".\nYou could, as an alternative, simply reconfigure the VM with a fixed IP address. Personally I don't recommend this as it is very easy to loose track of addresses. If you do want to though, assuming this is an Ubuntu desktop, open the network settings from the icon on the top menu bar and change the IPv4 settings from \"Automatic (DHCP)\" to \"Manual\". Then enter the desired IP address, mask (usually 255.255.255.0) and default gateway (usually the IP address of your router).\n", "Q: How to mount an ISO file? I'm running into trouble trying to mount a large iso:\ndev@dev-OptiPlex-745:~$ sudo mount -o loop /home/dev/Hämtningar/matlab2011a_64.iso /cdrom\nmount: warning: /cdrom seems to be mounted read-only.\ndev@dev-OptiPlex-745:~$ \n\nCan you tell me how I should do it?\n\nA: Maybe, instead of installing additional software, you can use what the system has to this end:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory to serve as the mount location:\nsudo mkdir /media/iso\n\n\n*Mount the ISO in the target directory:\nsudo mount -o loop path/to/iso/file/YOUR_ISO_FILE.ISO /media/iso\n\n\n*Unmount the ISO:\nsudo umount /media/iso\n\n\nOn your desktop will appear the mounted ISO.\n\nA: You can use ISO Master, a GUI utility similar to furiusisomount. Simply: \nsudo apt-get install isomaster\n\nAnd then open your *.iso file with ISO Master from your preferred file manager. \nFrom the website: \n\nUse ISO Master to:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Create or customise CD/DVD images\n  \n*Make Bootable CDs/DVDs\n  \n\nBasically, it allows you to add or remove files from the ISO image, then save the changes.\n\nA: If you want to get read write permissions for copying files from the mounted ISO and do not want to install something else.  Just go into terminal shell, navigate to whereever you mounted your ISO, such as:\nsudo mount -o loop /home/username/whatever.iso /mnt/iso\n\nThan copy the entire mounted directory somewhere else:\nsudo cp -rf /mnt/iso /home/username/MyMountedISO\n\nYou could also use\ncd /mnt/iso\n\nNext view the contents\nls\n\nand than:\nsudo cp install.img /home/username/MyMountedISO\n\n\nA: I found the easiest and fastest way to handle the ISO file in Ubuntu 14.04 was to right click on the ISO file, choose Disk Image Mounter and then simply proceed to the newly opened directory:\n\nIn case you don't have installed, you can use this command in terminal to install it:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-disk-utility\n\n\nA: Mounting an iso file is simpler relative to installing it latter. Just to mention that if you want to install latest matlab versions in latest ubuntus, you do not need to mount it the iso, rather extract it there and proceed in installation after making the install and /matlab-extracted-folder/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/bin/java executables. \nTested on ubuntu 14.04 and matlab 2014a.\nCheers,\n\nA: Use udisksctl it is part of the system.

For example, I uploaded  13 files, now I want to put them in a folder for better organization. Right now I cannot see a way to move files around once uploaded. I would hate to have to reupload all my files again just to put them in folders.  \nI am using a Mac.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the web interface does not provide a way to move files.\nIf you need to do this from a Mac, you could try using the u1ftp API demonstration program I wrote, which lets you manage your files through a stub FTP server running locally.\nSimply download the ZIP file from https://launchpad.net/u1ftp and run the following from the terminal:\npython u1ftp-0.1.zip\n\nNow use an FTP client to connect to localhost on port 2121 using your Ubuntu One credentials.  Performing moves or renames should happen fully server side, and avoid re-uploading the files.\nWhile MacOS's Finder has some FTP capabilities, it only supports read-only operations so is not suitable for this job.  Pretty much any of the dedicated FTP clients should do the trick though.\n\nA: You can re-organise the files in to new folders,  using nautilus file manager on your computer.\n(inside your ubuntu one or other synced folders)\nThey will then be re-synced to reflect the location changes on ubuntu one.\nOnly the new folders will be uploaded.   \n", "Q: How do I resume video play from the point it was stopped with VLC?

As should this one\n\n... So the output should be:\nOk, I know how to write programs in Python now.*.*.\n\n*Waits .5 seconds\n\nA: In Python 2, the print statement automatically adds a line feed, so you need to use sys.stdout.write() instead. You will also have to import sys. The code you have written should look like this instead:\nimport time\nimport sys\nsys.stdout.write(\"Ok, I know how to write programs in Python now.\")\ntime.sleep(0.5)\nsys.stdout.write(\".\")\ntime.sleep(0.5)\nsys.stdout.write(\".\")\n\nIn Python 3, print is a function accepting keyword arguments. You can use the end keyword argument to specify what should be placed after your string. By default it's a new line character, but you can change it to an empty string:\nimport time\nprint(\"Ok, I know how to write programs in Python now.\", end='')\ntime.sleep(0.5)\nprint(\".\", end='')\ntime.sleep(0.5)\nprint(\".\", end='')\n\nAlso, remember that streams are buffered, so it's better if you flush them:\nimport time\nimport sys\nprint(\"Ok, I know how to write programs in Python now.\", end='')\nsys.stdout.flush()\ntime.sleep(0.5)\nprint(\".\", end='')\nsys.stdout.flush()\ntime.sleep(0.5)\nprint(\".\", end='')\nsys.stdout.flush()\n\n\nA: You should be able to do it with the end=\"\" syntax also.  \nprint(\"this \",end=\"\")\nprint(\"will continue on the same line\")\nprint(\"but this wont\")\n\nWill return \nthis will continue on the same line\nbut this wont\n\nso the following would work as well.\nimport time\nprint (\"Ok, I know how to write programs in Python now.\",end=\"\")\ntime.sleep(0.5)\nprint (\".\",end=\"\") # This should print on the same line as the previous print statement.\ntime.sleep(0.5)\nprint (\".\") # ...

It doesn't matter if you're going to run the application remotely or not.\nWhile most of the Xorg server packages probably aren't needed, and you can remove them, you will also likely need to have at least one installed.

I prefer Banshee over rhythmbox.\nIn both Rhythmbox and Banshee, whenever I sync my music, the device is getting filled with data, but when I open the Music app, my music doesn't show up.\nIs there a fix for this? I've been looking around, and I've only found fixes for 11.10 and 11.04, and am desperate to try to sync again (last time was about a week or two ago) and reinstall the whole thing again to find it not working and filling up the thing. Syncing works fine on my iMac and my regular desktop.\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 x64 on an Acer Aspire 5740 laptop (i3 with HD graphics) and I too had this problem.  Neither Banshee, Rhythmbox or any other program worked to put songs in my iPod Touch 4g (iOS 5.1.1 jailbroken).  Installing iTunes through Wine didn't work either (i tried all versions 32 and 64 bit).  I also tried to install Windows 7/XP (32 and 64 bit) through VMWare Player and Virtualbox with no success.  I was about to format my laptop and install Windows 7 x64 but I kept looking and googgling for another possibility to put songs in my iPod Touch 4g and I finally found a solution that works for me.  In order for this to work you need to Jailbreak your iPod touch first.\nWhen I plug in my iPod in Ubuntu (I use 12.04 64 bit) it mounts it and it appears as a device (like a hard drive) and you can open it and navigate through the archives.  You can add and delete files just like a hard drive.  Well what I did was copy the mp3s that I wanted to the folder Downloads located at /var/mobile/Media/Downloads.  Then, in my iPod Touch, I downloaded and installed the app MewSeek from Cydia (source:  cydia.xsellize.com).  MewSeek allows you to add mp3s to the iPod library when you put them in /var/mobile/Media/Downloads or by downloading them through MewSeek itself.  When you put the mp3s in /var/mobile/Media/Downloads they appear in the downloads section in MewSeek.  To add an mp3 to the iPod library you have to select the mp3 (or mp3s) by tapping on it/them and then tapping on the Add to iPod button on the top right corner.  Then you can open the iPod app and you'll see that the mp3 (mp3s) is/are there.  Also, before adding them you can edit the tags for artist, song, album, etc. in MewSeek by tapping on the mp3 and tapping on the button Edit tags on the bottom left corner.  I think you can also edit the tags and even add the proper artwork using Banshee and Rhythmbox before moving the mp3s to Downloads.\nWell, for me this has been the only solution to adding mp3s to the iPod app in my jailbroken iPod Touch 4g.  I don't know if it works for other iPods or iPhones, i hope it does since switching back to Windows, with all due respect, would really suck!  Good luck.\n", "Q: How can i install mythtv 0.24 on ubuntu 12.04?

I'm trying to install this for a dependency for yara 1.6 in order to install jsunpack. Thank you for the help. \n\nA: Assuming you are using Ubuntu, you should usually not attempt to install packages with yum. It is provided for very special circumstances only. Usually you should install software with Ubuntu's package manager, APT (using apt-get, or the alternative, aptitude), or with one of its graphical frontends (like the Ubuntu Software Center or the Synaptic Package Manager).\n\n\n*\n\n*yum is primarily used on Red Hat based systems (including Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and derivatives of those). The above commands are what you'd use instead. The lower-level tool on Red Hat based systems, for installing a package from a specific package file, is rpm. dpkg (or its graphical frontend, gdebi) should be used to for this purpose on Ubuntu. dpkg installs .deb packages--if you find you actually need to install an .rpm package, you should use alien to make a .deb package from it and install that.\n\n*See Installing Software for more information.\nIn this particular situation, you may be able to install flex by clicking here:\n\n\n*\n\n*\nOr you can install it by running these commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install flex\n\nThe first command updates information about what packages are available in what versions and from what software sources. It's advisable to run that before installing or upgrading packages from the command line. Whereas yum will always fetch this information before attempting an installation (which is handy, but which also makes it take a lot longer than necessary if you run a number of yum commands in a short time), sudo apt-get install ... does not fetch this information.\nIf you don't run sudo apt-get update first, and you haven't run it in a while, you may be getting an old version of the package, attempting to fetch a version so old it's no longer available, or getting a version that doesn't work right with the other packages you have installed.\n\nA: you should have to type as sudo apt-get install flex to install it . or  If you want graphical approach using Software Center \n\nA: You are(in accordance to my comment which came before iwrng's answer) using commands for the wrong Linux distro. Ubuntu, like Debian uses apt(Advanced Package Tool) to install and manage applications. Please use sudo apt-get update, followed by sudo apt-get install flex, and use sudo apt-get installpackagename for all other installation steps in your guide.\n\nA: You can try installing Aptitude by typing sudo apt-get install aptitude (if you don't already have it) and then type sudo aptitude search flex.\nIf it locates the package do sudo aptitude install flex.\nThis way is a bit drawn out from imwrng's way, but this allows you to browse other available packages for flex.\n", "Q: Problem with Terminal while creating a bootable USB stick on OS X I'm following the instructions to create a bootable USB stick on OS X and everything is fine until step number 8: I have executed sudo, entered my password and now nothing is happening.\nI tried to go to step number 9 and ejected the USB stick and nothing happened.

Or does it start a new line with a flashing cursor, like this:\nMaco@macosx ~$: sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m\n█\n\nIf so, it means it is copying the image and you probrably

doesn't have a CD burner, but I do have an external hard drive.  I can't upgrade to the new Ubuntu. I got the older version off an old CD, have a player  not a burner, so I downloaded the newest version of Ubuntu.  \nIt won't automatically run the program and the websites say I need to burn something to make it run. What do I do?  If anyone knows, please let me know.\n\nA: You can achieve this by creating a \"usb live boot\" hard disk drive, from which you can boot and start the install process with ease.\nThe answers provided on these questions may be helpful for you to create the bootable hard disk drive for both Windows and Linux based OS's:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to create a Windows installation USB in Ubuntu?\n\n*How can I create a bootable USB disk from a CD image?\n\n*How do you create a bootable USB stick using windows 7\nAnyway I suggest you to use the Startup Disk Creator to perform this task in Linux.

I am not a computer buff and have no idea what a terminal is.\n\nA: Normally, it is advised to refrain from manipulating files in system folders by hand. Open Software Center, look for the games you want to get rid of and hit Remove.\n\nA: I do understand you are queasy about the terminal, but if no commands are mistyped, this will be quite easy. Wait for the something@somewhere ~$ prompt before typing the next command. Note that something and somewhere in the prompt may be different words--do not worry.\nThe default games installed are gnome-games. To remove them, open \"Terminal\" by searching it in the launcher, and type sudo apt-get remove gnome-games\nIt will prompt for a password, which will not be shown when typed(Not even *'s), and then will remove the package. If you are short on disk space, and do not use Libreoffice(An Open Source Office Suite), then you can remove all of Libreoffice from software center, or with sudo apt-get remove libreoffice-*.\n\nA: The Terminal provides a text-based command-line interface and is very powerful and useful.\nHowever, as Culumus007 has said, it may not be the best tool for this task. Graphical user interface tools like the Ubuntu Software Center or the Synaptic Package Manager make it easy to search through installed packages, figure out which ones you want to remove, and to remove them.\nYou can do the same thing from the command line, using commands like sudo apt-cache search ..., sudo apt-get remove ... (or sudo apt-get purge ...), and sudo apt-get autoremove (or sudo apt-get --purge autoremove).\nWhat you should not do is to remove the files manually.\n\n\n*\n\n*Even if the right files are removed, the system (specifically, the package manager) will still believe they're there, which can cause problems.\n\n*When a package is installed, its files are distributed throughout different subdirectories of /usr. It would be rather cumbersome and time consuming to find and delete them all manually, even if you worked from the lists of files provided by the packages you want to remove.\n\n*It's possible to remove the files manually, using either the Terminal or the file browser Nautilus. But for the reasons explained above, this is not a very good idea.\n\n*If the files are removed, launchers to them will malfunction instead of being also removed, unless the Unity Launcher entries are also removed manually, causing a difficult process.\n\n\nI've posted this as community-wiki (easier for others to edit, and I get no rep from it) because there are already good answers, and this is more of a guide to them than a separate answer.

If you have three scripts in the current directory:\n\n\n*\n\n*1.py\n\n*2.py\n\n*3.py\n\n\nThe {} will contain each file name and execute the head command on each file.\nThe -exec argument needs a ; at the end so it can recognize the end of the command arguments (sed in this case) but, in order to protect ; from expansion you need to escape it with the \\.\nRemember that you can execute several commands at a time if you use the ;:\n$ ls; pwd;\n\nThis will list directories (ls) and print your working directory (pwd). The -exec argument also needs the ;. But since you don't want to confuse the ; that separates commands with the ; that is part of the -exec argument of find, you need to escape it with the \\.\nAlternatively, you can use quotes around the ;:\n$ find /home/bruno/old-friends -type f -exec sed -i 's/ugly/beautiful/g' {} \";\"\n\nI hope I made myself clear\n\nA: I have been using an about.com Linux page for a while that covers\n\nfind - search for files in a directory hierarchy\n\nas a reference for a while and it covers the part of the command you are asking about.\nfind . -type f -exec file '{}' \\;\n\nRuns `file' on every file in or below the current directory. Notice that the braces are enclosed in single quote marks to protect them from interpretation as shell script punctuation. The semicolon is similarly protected by the use of a backslash, though ';' could have been used in that case also.\nSo I think your command should have semicolons around your braces just to be safe.\nReference Links:\nArticle explaining the find command\n\nA: With exec (and not xargs), the {} has to be included as it gets replaced by name of the file that is targeted by the find command; it is a placeholder that is normally quoted so that if any target files have spaces in them, the command will still run successfully on all the files. The semicolon has to be included as it ends the command, just like when separating multiple commands on the command line. It has to be escaped in this case so that the find command receives it from the shell unexpanded (as a literal).\nThere are many tutorials about this online, see, for example, this useful article.\nAnother excellent, and indeed essential, article is that on the Wooledge site that explains extremely well the find command, exec, and the importance of quoting various elements in your command or script. I have found that article and the site as a whole very useful for learning bash and bash scripting.\n", "Q: Added new partition to system, \"permission denied\" when running programs \nPossible Duplicate:\nUbuntu took away permissions from my Data partition \n\nI reformatted a NTFS partition on my system with ext4 because I want to use it on my current Ubuntu installation, not on Windows. I added an entry to /etc/fstab to mount it at start-up. The mount point is /home/username/bin. I changed the owner of /home/username/bin and all of its sub-directories to my regular account and its user group. Finally, I set all permissions to 755.\nMy /etc/fstab looks as follows:\nproc        /proc               proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid               0       0\nUUID=[uuid] /                   ext4    errors=remount-ro                 0       1       \nUUID=[uuid] /data               vfat    utf8,umask=007,gid=46             0       1\nUUID=[uuid] /home               ext4    defaults                          0       2\nUUID=[uuid] /home/username/bin  ext4    rw,suid,dev,exec,auto,user,async  0       2\nUUID=[uuid] none                swap    sw                                0       0\n\nMy problem is now that while I'm able to read and write files on this new partition, I cannot run applications/programs located there. As a regular user, I always get a \"permission denied\" error. As root (with sudo), just nothing happens, which means it immediately puts me back to the shell prompt. The applications should produce textual output or open windows. Some of these applications are binaries, some are scripts. I try to launch them with ./program. If I copy them back to my home folder, I can run them without problems. \nActually, I kept these applications for months in another sub-directory /home/username/apps of my home folder and ran them from there, without any problems.\nHow can I fix this? What am I doing wrong? :)\n\nA: You can access files on your newly created ext4 partition, but you cannot run programs. When you do, you get a \"Permission denied\" error. This suggests two possibilities, as reverendj1 has suggested:\n\n\n*\n\n*The files might not have execute permissions. To give a file execute permissions from the command line, run:\nchmod +x filename\nIf you just want to give execute permissions to the owner of the file:\nchmod u+x filename\nTo give a file execute permissions in Nautilus (the file browser), right-click on the file and click Properties. Click the Permissions tab. Check the box that says Allow executing file as a program, and click Close.\n\n\n*The partition may be mounted with noexec. To check this, run mount and see if noexec is listed next to the relevant entry. Since you're mounting from /etc/fstab, you can remove noexec there.\nIn addition, please note that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Usually, though not always, executables should be stored in the normal places: /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/sbin, /opt/bin, ~/bin. Are you sure you really want executables on that drive. You may want to edit your question to provide more information about what you want to accomplish.\n\n*To run a program from the command-line that is located in the current directory by specifying its relative path, you must precede it with ./:\n./program\n\n*If you are launching a .desktop file rather than an application then:\n\n\n*\n\n*It does not need the executable bit set.\n\n*You should not attempt to run it as though it is itself a script or program, but instead like this:\nxdg-open application.desktop\n\n\n*If these are Windows executables that you're running with Wine, they don't actually have to have the executable bit set. If they don't, you can right-click them and click open them with Wine Windows Program Loader, or launch them from the command line like this:\nwine program.exe\n(I see this provides very similar advice to a previous answer, so I've decided make this community-wiki.)\n\nA: Ignore this - original post implied NTFS, but this is not the case.\nWhen you mount an NTFS partition, unlike ext3 or ext4, it mounts with permissions set for only the user, where group and other have no permission at all (rwx------).  Setting the permissions with chmod or setting the owner with chown will only change the permissions for the directory, not anything in the directory.\nThe solution is to specify the correct parameters in /etc/fstab/.  The ones I use successfully, to make myself the owner is this (change 0000000000000000 to the correct UUID, and change LOGIN_NAME to your login name):\nUUID=0000000000000000  /home/LOGIN_NAME/bin  ntfs-3g auto,users,uid=LOGIN_NAME,gid=LOGIN_NAME,utf8,dmask=002,fmask=113  0  0\nThis should all be on one single line in fstab.\nThe reason for this is that NTFS permissions are done differently than native Linux permissions, so certain translations must be specified to be used by Linux.\nEnd of Ignore this -------------\nEDIT:\nSorry for the misdirection.\nI believe you can fix this by changing the owner of the ~/bin directory after mounting it the first time.  In a bash shell, enter the command sudo chown LOGIN_NAME:LOGIN_NAME /home/LOGIN_NAME/bin, changing LOGIN_NAME to your name, of course.  \nI tested this out using a USB drive, and it mounted fine in my bin directory.  The only difference was that I used only the option \"auto\" in fstab.\n\nA: I solved it. The problem were the mount options in /etc/fstab. Changing them to defaults (which is equivalent to changing user to nouser) solves the problem, everything works now as expected.\n\nA: You need to set the execute permission. From Nautilus (the file browser), right-click on the program file, then select the Permissions tab. Check the \"Allow executing file as program\" checkbox. From the terminal, you can also do:\nsudo chmod +x /path/to/myfile\n\nAlso, make sure you are not specifying noexec for the partition in fstab, as that will disable execution for the entire partition.\n\nA: I was having similar problems, not being able to execute shell scripts stored on NTFS, even with sudo, even after editing fstab as described above. \nIt turns out I had never made the mount point directory. I unmounted the partition, made the mount point directory for the partition:\nmkdir /media/Windoze7\n\nand then mounted again.\nsudo mount -a\n\n\nA: Have you tried mounting this ext4 partition somewhere outside your home directory?  For example, set up its entry in /etc/fstab something like this:\nUUID=[uuid] /ext4bins  ext4    rw,suid,dev,exec,auto,user,async  0       2\n\nIf you are able to mount it elsewhere and execute files and applications, then you can take a second step to get the behavior you wanted, which is being able to execute applications from ~/bin, by creating a symbolic link like so:\nln -s /ext4bins /home/[username]/bin\n\nReplace [username] with your own username, obviously.  This will make the mounted partition in /ext4bins appear to be mounted in /home/[username]/bin, and as long as files are exectuable in /ext4bins, you will be able to execute them through ~/bin as well.  E.g.\n/ext4bins/myscript.sh\n\nwill run the same as\n~/bin/myscript.sh\n\n", "Q: Problem with wired internet connecting on MTNL Triband I am a Ubuntu user from Mumbai, India and subscribe to MTNL's Triband broadband service.

How do I diagnose and fix it? I am using ubuntu 12.04 in my laptop. This is my first experience in ubuntu. I just installed Ubuntu yesterday.\nI have dual OS in my laptop. The other OS is Windows 7.\nComparing Windows 7 ubuntu performance is very slow for me.\nFor example to open the Dash it takes 10 seconds.\nWhat could cause this to happen?\nMy hardware: \nIntel dual core.  \n2 GB ram.  \n320 GB hard disk\n\nBasically ubuntu is slow or for me only.\nI have a good opinion of Windows comparing Window after using ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 uses more 3D features so if your graphic card is not good enough, it might be seeking memory in your RAM which is also rather low for nowadays usage.\nYou can swith to a 2D Ubuntu. I think this will work better for you and you will see that the speed at this point is very snappy.\n\nA: Right, as suggested by Ndefontenay, a workaround to your problem is to login with a different type of session.\nThe default one is Ubuntu session, using Unity 3D, using many 3D features.\nSolutions using less 3D features are available.\nInstall this  gnome-session-fallback\nAnd them you will be able to open a session with GNOME Classis (No effects).\nI think that GNOME Classis (No effects) is the one using less 3D features.\nTo select it, just click on the little cog icon.\n\n", "Q: Path missing when use as root I'm running jsunpack.py, after installing all dependencies and setting the correct path, I decided to test it. I run it as python jsunpack.py test.htm and it works fine, now when I try to sudo it I get: \nerror: Error: Fatal error in decodeJS: [Errno 2] No such file or directory (probably you are missing \"js\" in your path)\n\nWhich leads me to think I don't have the path set up in root. So I sudo su root and I echo the path only to see that it is indeed there. I'm thoroughly confused, does it have something to do with permissions?\n\nA: Permanent Solution\nIt seems that you need to add a directory to your environmental PATH variable.  It is possible that you've gotten that variable installed using your .bashrc.\nWhat happens if you do this:\nsudo su -\nbash /home/**user**/.bashrc\npython jsunpack.py test.htm\n\nIf this works for you, then you've probably installed the PATH variable to your user's bashrc and not root's bashrc.  To solve this you can open the user's .bashrc file and look though your PATH declarations:\ncat ~/.bashrc | grep PATH\n\nIf you find a line that shows the path that you're looking for, copy and paste that PATH into your /root/.bashrc.\n\nSingle Time Solution\nIf you're really lazy, just:\ncd /dir/with/jsunpack.py\npython jsunpack.py test.htm\n\nI am not familiar with jsunpack, but this may help resolve your issue.\n", "Q: Internet connection not working although it says it is connected I have a Toshiba z830 with ubuntu 12.04. I could use without problems the DSL connection (I have no router, only a modem) at home until a couple of days ago: \nIt stopped to work when while connected with the DSL connection via CiscoVPN (to my workplace), I had to leave the laptop unattended for a while and I guess the laptop tried to go to suspend.

There should be a button you can press during startup to select a boot device. If this doesn't work, you might want to try reinstalling.\nIf grub2 (the bootloader) isn't installed, the system cannot boot. To fix this, you will need to boot from a live cd, that is, booting from the installation disc and selecting \"try ubuntu\". Then open a terminal window (search for \"terminal\") and issue this command:\ndpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\n\nThis will open a sort of wizard with several options. You can leave the text fields at the default value, but make sure to select the correct drive when you are asked. You will need to select the primary virtual hard drive, which most likely would be /dev/sda (not sda1). Look at the size of the drive to make sure that it matches.\nAfter doing this, grub2 will be installed. Please note that this requires a working installation of ubuntu, so if it fails, try reinstalling. Also, there might be several boot options in a menu during boot (the grub2 menu), in which case you will need to find the right one. Once you have booted the virtual machine from the hard disk, you can eject the CD and run the above command again. I'm not completely sure about this last step, and it might not be necessary. Make sure to remove the CD before trying to boot the new installation.\n", "Q: How to send to print (many) selected files in a directory instead of one by one? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and succesfully installed my wi-fi printer, but my question is: How to print many files at a time? I mean, I have many PDF or text files in a folder and I want to send them directly to printer instead of opening one by one in file viewer and then to print and then repeat the whole process so many times /: \nI even see no Print option when right clicking on the file or in the File menu.\nThank you!\n\nA: I have done a script that will send the desired files to the default printer: you may have to modify it to select the folder that your files are in and run it once for .pdf and then for .txt:\nfind /home/mike/KeyGuides/ -type f -iname '*.txt' -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' f; do lpr \"$f\"; done. It does work as I have just tested it; just make sure the desired printer is set up as default. \nIf you have any problems, I'll see if I can modify it as necessary. (You can use other options for lpr if you need -see man lpr) It should work for most printers- it is successful with my Canon IP4700.\nThis version of the script also moves each printed document to a directory (which you must have created previously), so that when the script is run only new documents are printed:\nfind /home/mike/Duck/ -type f -iname '*.txt' -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' f;\n do lpr \"$f\" && mv \"$f\" /home/mike/Duck/printed/ ; done\n\n\nA: Create the file: ~/.local/share/applications/print.desktop\nPut in:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Print Directly\nComment=Print file directly with default printer.\nExec=lp %f\nType=Application\nIcon=/usr/share/pixmaps/gnome-applets.png\nMimeType=text/plain;text/pdf;application/pdf;application/x-pdf\n\nRight click on any pdf file, in the \"Open with...\" view the extended list of available application for pdf files.

Then drag and drop the files you want to print on the terminal.\n\nA: Recent versions of CUPS added the ability to print pdfs directly.  11.10 and newer (and possibly older) releases have this.\nAnother approach (that I use with my duplex (two-sided) printing emulator package) is to use Print To File for all your print jobs and put them in a folder that effectively becomes your personal print queue.  Once they're there, you can print some or all of them when you want to and delete them when they're done.\nThis has the added advantage of allowing you to rerun jobs after a paper jam, etc. without recreating them from scratch.  It also allows you to keep working without stopping to manage your printer.\nIf you want to, you could write a small script that would run in the background and start printing things that appear in your print queue.  If you do any of this, you may want to name your print jobs so that they sort in the queue in the order you want them to print in.  I just use 00 ... 99 for names.\nFor text files, look out for those that may have long lines.  CUPS (at least by default) won't wrap the lines for you or set up nice page margins.\nMy duplex printing system does a lot more than what you're asking for, but might give you some ideas.  Notably it has two small helper scripts dprint and dprintm which take text and tame it a bit before sending it to the printer.\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/duplexpr/\n\n\nA: I know this is old - but the way to do this is now revised as I discovered today:\nyou will need filemanager-actions installed - it was already on my system\nsudo apt-get install filemanager-actions\n\nNext get nautilus-actions \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:dr3mro/nautilus-actions-extra\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-actions\n\nOpen FileManager-Actions and create a new action as per above:\nAction Tab\n    Nautilus Item\n        Display item in selection context menu (tick)\n        Display item in location context menu (tick)\n        Context Label : Print\n        Display item in the toolbar (tick)\n        Use same label for icon in the toolbar (tick)\n\nCommand Tab\n    Profile\n        Label: Default profile\n    Command\n        Path: lp\n        Parameters: %f\n        Working directory: %d\n\nEdit the other tabs information as you would like to your nautilus to behave.\nSave the action, restart nautilus .\nYour context menu will show up \"Print\"...\na few links helped me out:\nLibreOffice Print\nRight Click Print\n\nA: You can use,\nlpr *.pdf\n\nIt will print all pdf files in your current directory with your default printer.\nto check options, run,\nlpr --help\n\nA: Or use Ruby :-)\nsudo apt-get install ruby\nirb\nDir.glob('*.*').each{ |f| `lp '#{ f }'` }\n\n", "Q: How to check data usage of a USB datacard on Ubuntu?

Is there any way to jump back to the previous working directory after doing a cd to a different directory?\nMy use-case is that I'm traversing a directory structure for a Java project, and I'm expecting that the current directory has only one sub-directory. So, I type cd and hit Tab and Enter rather quickly. However, the Tab failed, as I mistakenly expected one sub-directory, when in fact there are more. So now, I just executed cd, and am now in my home directory, instead of the Java project. Is there a way to \"undo\" this cd and jump back to the directory I was in?\n\nA: In addition, cd .. can take you back to the working directory's parent directory and then if necessary the command can be repeated until you get to where you want to be. In fact, each time it is evoked it takes you back through the directory tree, which would ultimately finish at / (the root directory) if you just kept repeating the command.\nIn contrast, cd - actually makes the previous working directory the current working directory, (which is known as .), and which exact location in the filesystem can be found with pwd. \nSo both cd .. and cd -  can be useful in different circumstances when navigating the directory tree, although they do differ in the aforementioned respects. Perhaps the most useful command after having fun experimenting with these two commands is cd, which returns you to the home folder. \n\nA: cd - is great for going back one level, but if you find yourself wanting to go back a few levels, check out this script:\nacd_func.sh\nIt's great. cd -- to see your history, and cd -3 to go back 3 levels, for example.\n\nA: You can also use pushd and popd to utilize the directory stack. Here's some information.\n\nA: You can use cd - to go back to your previous location, no matter where that was. \n\nA: Best way to do this for going back is cd -, however if you want to skip a lot of levels at once, you better use cd .. for one level, cd ../.., for two, cd ../../.. for three and on... a nice way to do it fast is this script:\n#!/bin/bash\nprintf \"Number of folders to move back: \"\nread TIMES\nBACKCHARS=../\nBACK=$(for i in `seq $TIMES`; do printf $BACKCHARS; done)\ncd $BACK\n\n", "Q: Graphics freezes on Acer Aspire 5516 I have a problem with graphics on my aspire 5516.\nI use default drivers for lan(atheros) and video(ati radion 1200) cards.\nSo, graphics freezes when my lan adapter is turn on but the cable isn't connected in Ubuntu 11.04-12.04 with UIs Unity 3D and GNOME(no problem in GNOME classic and Unity 2D).\nAlso mouse doesn't move too and I can't restart compiz from keyboard.\nI can go to text mode and then turn off adapter and restart compiz.\nCould someone help me with that?

That way it won't try to boot from something else and it should work properly with your keyboard plugged in. \n\nA: I also have Dell Vostro 3750 i7 quad core.\nIf there is anything plugged in in USB3 port(s) - Ubuntu would not boot properly and would just show blank screen or a cursor blinking in the top left corner of the screen.\nThe solution is to unplug whatever is plugged in USB3 port(s) - say mouse or USB stick or 4 port hub or whatever, and Ubuntu would boot up normally. It boots normally if peripherals are plugged in USB2 port.\nWorth mentioning is that these problems do not exist when booting Windows 7 (64 bit, preinstalled on this Dell Vostro 3750): this USB3 problem happens only with Ubuntu.\nI faced this problem when installing Ubuntu too. I had the USB plugged into USB3, but when I plugged it into a USB2 port, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installed in a second.\nIt seems USB3 and Ubuntu boot or install process have some problems/bugs.\n", "Q: Does ubuntu have a social client faster than Gwibber?

Now that I have a linux server at home, I have turned journalling off on the harddrive and I mount it with read and write access at boot time on my Ubuntu box (12.04 Desktop version, but I use it as a home print/file/media server). Up to here everything works smoothly.\nThe problems start when some event leads to an unclean unmount, and this happens a lot in a home environment. This can be a power failure, or a cable disconnection, or etc.... Consequently, the HFS+ drive does not mount anymore at boot time and if I try to mount it manually, it gets mounted as read-only. To solve the problem, every single time I have to disconnect the drive, and connect and mount it on my MacBook. After a clean unmount the drive can be mounted with no problem on my linux box.\nIs there anyway to skip this connecting-to-osx-box step, i.e., is there anyway to clean mount an unclean unmounted HFS+ drive with read and write access in Ubuntu? Is there a switch that I can use in my fstab to force the mounting?\nThanks in advance.\nMah\n\nA: I run into this exact same problem often. I haven't had a chance to test out my theory yet, but perhaps try fsck.hfsplus at the command line for your particular device when it gets mounted ro.

You can see the tools at the bottom of the window here:\n\nWhereas usually Shotwell is nondestructive (in the sense that any manipulations you perform on photos are only saved to a photo file if you export it), hitting save from the viewer does indeed write the changes to the file.\nFull disclosure: I work at Yorba, though not on Shotwell.\n\nA: I was just looking for something similar.

(just to clarify, the repairs are permanent but the Boot Repair program itself is not)\nIf for some reason none of this works and you just want to reinstall Ubuntu, I would recommend downloading and burning a CD(or DVD) they don't tend to have these problems.\nIf you have any questions, see this page on the Boot Repair program\nit is also my Source: Ubuntu Community Wiki\n", "Q: Graphics drivers for ATI Radeon 5450 I've been googling everywhere I could think of for the past three days now and I finally just made an account here to ask my question. I'm a total Ubuntu n00b, I'm converting from Windows (which I know pretty much inside and out).\nI tried to install the fglrx Proprietary Catalyst 12.6 drivers on my system (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32 bit) but every time I do I eventually end up with an unfixable boot error and have to reinstall Ubuntu. I've reinstalled 3 times already. The reason I want the drivers is because I have two monitors, and they only work in mirrored mode without the proprietary drivers for me.\nI got them to work once without, but my larger monitor only ran in 1024x768. Is there some way to install the drivers that will make them not be so finicky? I heard there were also open source drivers as well? How do you install those?\nThanks.\n\nA: I am a user of a very similar card, with a fully functioning Ubuntu set up with Catalyst aka fglrx.\nYou want Catalyst 12.9 out of the repositories i.e. what Ubuntu suggests in the Software Sources part of the Software Center. Don't go for earlier versions and don't go for more recent versions. You will also want to install linux-headers-generic.\nIf you look here, you should see a more long winded version in an answer to another question. That is how I did it - after numerous failed attempts - although there may be superfluous steps.\n\nA: I have a 5450 driver, which works well with two monitors using either the standard open drivers or the proprietary drivers - even off the liveCD.  \nWhat happens when you try to uncheck the \"Mirror Displays\" checkbox with the standard driver?  Make sure both monitors are switched on using the sliding switch under the displays in the middle, and the resolution is set correctly for both monitors.\nI've never had to reinstall Ubuntu for many different versions.  One trick I found once when my system wouldn't boot normally was to replace the file xorg.conf with a plain vanilla version.  The full version to this file is:\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf\nIt is a plain text file, and can be edited or replaced either from a virtual terminal, if that is working, or even using a live CD to access the partition.  The one for the plain, open-source driver that comes standard is very simple:\nSection \"Screen\"\n        Identifier      \"Default Screen\"\n        DefaultDepth    24\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Module\"\n        Load    \"glx\"\nEndSection\n\nIf you find this same file on your system, you can copy it to something like xorg.conf.backup in case of future problems.\nLet me know if you have questions.  I used to be like you, a windows expert from version 1, but now I dread having to configure Windows because it's actually harder; I never used to believe people who said that either, but after a certain point (for me, a couple of years), you realize it's true.\n\nA: Just connect your system in Ubuntu with Internet and open \"Additional Drivers\" application. Then it shows available graphics drivers for your system. From there you can install them and there is no problem with this.\n\nA: I would strongly suggest you make sure that you have followed the advice in the askubuntu community wiki for this which is here:\nAsk Ubuntu ATI Community Wiki\n", "Q: mv: cannot stat with * I've tried this before.

This will work if temp1 and temp2 exists in your home directory\nmv /home/$USER/temp1/* /home/$USER/temp2\n\n\nA: I'll try to help out and clear up the confusion a little:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to move a folder and its contents to another one, you enter:\nmv ~/Scripts ~/Podcasts\n\n*If you want to move a folder's contents but not the folder itself to another folder, you must enter, for example, mv ~/Scripts/* ~/Podcasts. You can enter echo ~/Scripts/* to check the folder's content\n\n*(If you also need to know about globstar, which will allow you to recurse through all directory levels, see this article and this one. It can be enabled with shopt -s globstar, but that will need to be put in .bashrc to work permanently.)\n(The tilde ~ in ~/Scripts is expanded to /home/mike/ or your user name automatically by the shell)\n\nA: If you're using bash and the source directory is empty, you can modify the shell's default glob expansion behavior with:\nshopt -s nullglob\n\nto enable the nullglob and cause any succeeding commands like mv to behave properly when the source directory is empty. Beware that this can cause other commands such as ls to behave unexpectedly.\nYou can disable the nullglob again with:\nshopt -u nullglob\n\nFor more information, look here and here.\n", "Q: problems installing ubuntu via cd I am fairly new to the whole Linux system. I used it very little in college and decided to get back into it 4 years later.\nI have been trying to get Ubuntu LTS installed on my old laptop (about 8 yrs old) and once the install gui gets to restart and I let the computer do the whole restart it just sits on a black screen if I remove the CD.\nI have no clue what my hardware specs are anymore, I've been trying to figure that out for a couple weeks now. All I am working from right now is the fact that it is a Sony Vaio PCG-GRT270.\nUPDATE:Sorry I forgot to mention what I do know about the HW, it has 512 MB of RAM, 60 GB HDD and Pentium 4 processor, but not sure of the speed.\n\nA: Your laptop only has 265 MB of RAM. Along with other components in your laptop lacking the power to run an operating system built for modern computers, I am afraid to say Ubuntu 12.04 will not run on your laptop.\nGive Xubuntu and/or Lubuntu a try, these are spin-offs with different desktop environments that do not require as much horsepower.\n\nA: *\n\n*Reboot your system and Keep Shift pressed untill you get the grub menu.\n\n*Highlight the first menu. Press e\n\n*Use arrow keys to go to end. Where it is written like quite splash.\n\n*replace quite splash with nomodeset.\n\n*Press ctrl+X. Now you should be able to boot though screen may be distorted. You need to install drivers.\n\n\nYour graphics card driver  is legacy 173 driver from nvidia. Which has some problem with 12.04 as for newer X Server version. This bug indicates it. Though it is said that the bug is fixed. I was not able to install it. To get correct drivers do the following\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nNext time you should be rock with ubuntu. :)\nHowever based on your spec, it will be wise to opt for xubuntu or lubuntu. \nOR install gnome-shell  and use gnome classic. \nRelated question :\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?\nOffline installation of addtional drivers , how to determine correct pakage\nDoes 12.04 need graphics drivers for NVidia?\n", "Q: How can I automate opening and closing groups of applications? I'd like to click a button that launches my group of applications that I need for graphical design. Then after a few hours be able to close them and open all my social applications (Empathy, Thunderbird, netlog.com, etc...). And sometimes open the group for learning Cantonese.\nMy PC is average, so not powerful to load all this well in different workplaces. With Unity I even found it better to reduce the workspaces from 4 to 1.\nI believe dedicated working like this without distracting applications would help others to become more productive too. I hope somebody can help. Should we make a facilitating program for this?\n\nA: You can make a shell script with something like this :\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmy_pgrm0 &\nmy_pgrm1 &\nmy_pgrm2 &\n...\nmy_pgrmN &\n\nAll your programs (from my_pgrm0 to my_pgrmN) will be launched when you execute the script.\nFor closing the program, same thing with another script :\n#!/bin/bash\n\nMY_PGRM_LIST=my_pgrm0 my_pgrm1 my_pgrm2 ... my_pgrmN\n\nfor PGRM in $MY_PGRM_LIST; do\n    killall $PGRM\n    # Or searching the program with ps aux | grep $PGRM, retrieving the process id and then give this process to kill -9\ndone\n\n\nA: This can be done in a number of ways by yourself.  The easiest and simplest way is to create simple scripts that are simply a list of programs to run.\nIf you don't have a directory named \"bin\" in your home directory, you would want to create one, as this is a default place for such things; from a terminal command, enter from your default home directory: mkdir bin.  Then, enter \"cd bin\" to change to that directory.  Run an editor such as gedit in that directory, with a name such as gedit socialapps.sh.\nIn the editor enter something like this:\n#!/bin/sh\nempathy &\nthunderbird &\nxdg-open http://netlog.com &\n\nWhen done, close the editor, and make the file executable, by entering chmod +x socialapps.sh.\nRun the script by using alt-f2, and entering the full name.  Then, you may be able to pin it to the launcher, or create a keyboard shortcut.\nTo close the apps, you would create another similar script, but call it something like \"closesocial.sh\", and enter commands like this:\npkill empathy &\npkill thunderbird &\n\nFor the URL, you'd need to pkill the browser, and I'm not sure how well it will work, especially if you have other browser windows.\nThere may be more elegant ways to do this, but this should work until you find something better, if you really want it.\n", "Q: Looking for a decent looking, battery-oriented desktop environment, with transparent panel I have Ubuntu running on my laptop, and (especially since my laptop specs are a tad bit higher than budget machines) I need to optimize Ubuntu as much as possible to maximize my battery life.\nI've seen a couple of battery life oriented desktop environments, but they seem to be on the visual scale of Windows 98 or something. I'm not asking for high-quality 3D effects and graphics, but I would strongly prefer transparent panels and launchers (or hideable launchers). I don't mind the Window-and-Start-Menu style of some desktop environments. I actually sort of like Cinnamon's approach, but the lack of transparency and a couple of other quirks turned me away from it. And to be quite honest, if I could change the icon size and enable a transparent panel in Unity2D I would just stick with that.\nIn summation, I want a desktop environment that offers the following\n\n\n*\n\n*panel transparency and launcher hiding\n\n*optimized for battery performance\n\n*minimalistic, non-intrusive icons\n\n\nAny suggestions?\nedit; would also prefer an upper panel option, like in Unity, that can switch between transparency on the desktop and matching Chromium's upper edge when it is maximized. Chromium is pretty much the only window I maximize and the disconnect in some environments like gnome classic isn't pretty.\n\nA: kde has transparency but it is not battery friendly as lot of processes keep running in background,  in unity also zeitgist and compiz keep running. \nso for all this things together,  you only have xfce left to choose, it is lighter (battery friendly),  simplistic, highly configurable (hide/unhide) and you can enable compositor from settings / window manager tweaks  to get transparency of panels and menus.\n", "Q: Hard Resetting alsa Configuration?

Could you please help me to decide whether this bug affects Ubuntu 12.04?\nI found out the information about the indicator-multiload (which turned out to be the thing I have been missing in my installation of Ubuntu 12.04 for Toshiba AC100), but then I saw the comment warning about this memory leak bug (reported at Launchpad).\nI've read the comments there, seen that some fix has been comitted, but I can't understand whether this fix got into the repository for Ubuntu 12.04, so that I can install this indiciator without being afraid of this memory leak. What is the quick way to check this?\n\nA: Between comments 37 and 38 are messages about how the bug's status in unity in Ubuntu went to Fix Released on May 31, 2011.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.04 LTS was released before that, and likely doesn't have the fix. If the bug were to be fixed in 10.04 LTS, it would probably be tracked separately for that release. (That doesn't mean the bug is in 10.04 LTS; another possibility is that the bug simply never affected 10.04 LTS, having been introduced after that. I have not looked into that question, since that specific information is probably not important to your needs.)\n\n*Ubuntu 11.04 was released before that, and does not have the fix. Status of the bug in unity in Ubuntu is tracked separately for that release and has the Triaged status rather than the Fix Released status.\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 was released about 5 months after the bug's status went to Fix Released. So the fix was incorporated into that release.\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 LTS was released about 11 months after the bug's status went to Fix Released. So the fix was incorporated into that release, too.\n\n\nThus, the fix should be incorporated into Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, even if no updates have been installed.\n", "Q: How can I help Ubuntu as a developer?

(More programming information)\n\n*Amazon Prime Instant Video: offers no-additional-cost streaming of TV shows and movies (wider selection than Hulu, narrower than Netflix) with a $79/year subscription to Amazon's free-shipping service, Prime.\n\n*Youtube now also officially offers Movies and TV Shows for streaming/purchase. Some are also available for free.\nThis Wired article from late 2011 compares more services, including pay-per-movie or pay-per-show ones such as iTunes. See also this article.\n\nNote: As dobey helpfully notes in the comments, \"You can also simply rent shows or movies on Amazon as well, without paying the yearly fee, nor are all the shows and movies they have available to stream, available for free with the Prime subscription.\"\n\n\nA: Another good service that is about to come out is Redbox instant streaming.  You can sign up for the early trial here https://www.redbox.com/streaming?cid=ss:12:19:2012\nI know this is an older question, but it is worth mentioning since it appears to be a better competitor to Netflix since it is about the same price, has no commercials, and I don't think you will need to occasionally pay extra which is some of the characteristics of Hulu and Amazon/YouTube.\n", "Q: Couldn't find matching GLX visual (Resource temporarily unavailable) When I execute etracer (ExtremeTuxRacer) from within a terminal all I get is:\n\"etracer error: Couldn't initialize video: Couldn't find matching GLX visual (Resource temporarily unavailable)\"\nI have an Intel graphics adapter that runs compiz and other 3d games just fine.\n\nA: Deleted ~/.etracer and it fixed itself... \n", "Q: Multiple wallpapers in GNOME Shell I know this has been asked to death, but I can't get it to work.

I can stopgap this by adding a spacer after the current time by a certain amount to offset it - but this leaves a ridiculous gap in the tray bar. \n\nA: I've solved this by right-clicking the tray bar and going to panel settings and in there making the width 100% instead of a set width of the first monitor's resolution. This has the downside of extending the tray bar across both desktops instead of one, and as such is only really a stop-gap solution.\n\n\nA: Instead of stretching the panel across both monitors I moved the clock to the left of the panel.

Als always you should frequently backup your important files on an external storage. This can easily be done when you have booted Ubuntu.\nTo share files with Windows however it may be better to have a shared NTFS formatted data directory that can easily be accessed from both operating systems.\nStill it is also possible to mount your Wubi file container from Windows located in C:\\ubuntu\\disks\\ to access data but I would only recommend to do that with read access. To do so you need to install ext2read in Windows.\nNote that for hibernating, and file encryption a dual boot solution may be better.

Is there any workaround for this?\n\nA: AFAIK, there is only one feature of psensor which requires root privilege, the disk monitoring using the atasmart library (--use-libatasmart). You can use the hddtemp instead. Do you have a specific reason to use libatasmart?\nEventually, you can change the permission of the disk that you want to monitor to avoid the need of being root, but it will open a security hole...\npsensor does not use directly dbus, but the appindicator library does...\nIt sounds like the issue is at dbus level: https://bugs.launchpad.net/indicator-appmenu/+bug/592842\n", "Q: How to reset all per-folder view settings in nautilus?

Wubi will detect that there is an existing installation and you will be offered an option to uninstall. You may want to backup the installation files (the ISO) in order to avoid having to download them again. Note that when you reinstall, the system virtual drive (root.disk) is reset. \nRecommendation \nI would highly advise you to use Ubuntu in Dual-Boot setup, and not through Wubi. You can refer this guide to install it.\nHow do I install Ubuntu?\n\nA: The simplest way to uninstall wubi is to go to run C:\\ubuntu\\Uninstall-ubuntu.exe . Otherwise you can remove it through control panel -> Programs and features. \nAnd as tjybba said you should use Ubuntu in DUal-Boot setup. This would ensure that you can use one OS without disturbing the other one.\n", "Q: how to sketch mechanical drawings and pcb of the electronic device?

I am trying to configure a build from source an old version of gcc on my dev machine. The documentation highlight several environment variables that need to be changed in order to do this. I was wondering how to do this and also where linux stores them and if a system restart is required for any changes to be registered??\n\nA: The Global environment variables of your system are stored in /etc/environment.\nAny changes here will get reflected throughout the system and will affect all users of the system. Also, you need a Reboot, for any changes made here to take effect.\nUser level Environment variables are mostly stored in .bashrc and .profile files in your Home folder. Changes here only affect that particular user. Just close and open the terminal for configuration changes to take place.\nEdit : If you don't want to Reboot or restart your terminal, you can make use of the source command.\nEg. source /etc/environment or source .bashrc \n\nA: What you need is local temporal changes. You are not going to need them tomorrow, when you are doing something else, it may break the thing you do tomorrow. However you could save it as a build-script/makefile for use tomorrow.\nexport VARIABLE=value\nexport VARIABLE2=another_value\ngcc …\n\nor\nVARIABLE=value VARIABLE2=another_value gcc …\n\nnote: If using make, the first example wont work.

However I then got confused when I read this article (Networking between host and guest VMs in VirtualBox).\nVirtualBox > File > Preferences > Network > Edit Host-only adapter, shows me an IPv4 address of 192.168.56.1 and Mask of 255.255.255.0.

In other words, that is what is used when you SFTP to the /var/www directory. The host-only adapter in the VM must be on the same subnet as the virtual adapter on the host.

Don't confuse with permission. There are two things, permission and owner. Sometimes permission auto change when we copy some folder or file from pendrive or somewhere.

I've got 8GB of RAM, which is helpful for the build, but is far from enough to cache the whole folder (which is around 12GB).\nI'm wondering. Is there a way to optimize the access to this particular folder? For instance, can the directory structure for this folder be cached in the RAM? Can the most used files be cached into the RAM as well?\nDo you know of such a solution for Ubuntu? I've got UPS so I'm not particularly bothered by power downs.\n\nA: \ncan the directory structure for this folder be cached in the RAM? Can the most used files be cached into the RAM as well?\n\nYes.  That is how the system normally operates; you don't have to do anything special.  The kernel automatically caches recently accessed files in unused ram.\n\nA: The operating system will already have a system cache for the files you access.  However if you are working with lots of small files you'd probably be better off turning of atime with the noatime boot parameter.\nEach time you access a file, it triggers a write to update when a file was last accessed.\nOther than that or buying an SSD drive the linux kernel does its best to provide you with the fastest system it can.

I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 at work, which runs very well. Unfortunately, for work reasons, I need to use mysql version 5.1. I can't find a clean way of installing it. I must install it the usual way because we have scripts that rely on the ubuntu standard installation paths and directories. I would avoid to downgrade my distro (and I have no time to do it). Can you please point out a good way of doing this?\n\nA: MySQL Sandbox seems to be a viable solution in your case.\n\nA: Your best bet is to keep using the release of Ubuntu that your scripts expect. Perhaps you can make use of LXC containers to get this done in a lightweight manner. If your scripts are meant for lucid:\nsudo apt-get install lxc\nlxc-create -t ubuntu -n my-lucid-box -- -r lucid --bindhome myuser\n\nThis will create an empty shell container (like a VM, but using the kernel for isolation instead of true virtualization) and bind it to the lxcbr virtual network. It will have your home dir mounted and your user copied in so you can ssh in w/ any keys from ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.\nYou can start it then with 'sudo lxc-start -n my-lucid-box' and login and install mysql-5.1, which will now be listening on the container's IP (usually in some 10.x.x.x range).\nThe best part about this is the container is isolated from your working system (except /home/youruser, be careful there!), so when you're done, just lxc-destroy -n my-lucid-box and its all gone (don't worry, it won't remove your home dir).\n", "Q: How do I add the \"gnome-shell-extensions\" PPA?

A software channel is simply a location which holds packages of similar types, which can be downloaded and installed using a package manager. A package manager will store an index of all of the packages available from a software channel. Sometimes it will 're-build' this index to make sure that it is up to date and knows which packages have been upgraded or added into the channel since it last checked.\nThere are four Ubuntu software channels for each architecture - Main, Restricted, Universe and Multiverse. Each has a different purpose. In addition to the official Ubuntu repositories, it is possible to use third party repositories.Eg Personal Package Archive (PPA) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware \nIf you wan to know more about a package you could run this command from the terminal \ndpkg -s <package> \neg \ndpkg -s firefox \nThat will return information about the firefox version installed \nor \napt-cache showpkg <package> will show you a list of versions available.  \n\nA: $ egrep Origin /var/lib/apt/lists/*Release\n", "Q: Ubuntu detects that I don't have at least 4.4 GB free space, what should I do?

The HDD is 350GB big.\nI checked the drive with Disk Utility and it showed that the hard drive had a bootable flag. So, in the edit partition, I unchecked this bootablity.\nNow it won't mount in Ubuntu and now my XP can't recognize it at all, whereas I could access the data on the XP machine before.\nIn disk utility, it doesn't give me the option to check the bootable box in again and I can't access the data on XP either.\nAny ideas on how to fix it?\n\nA: First of all, you should install a utility called GParted: # apt-get install -y gparted. After it reads the hard drive, you will have the opportunity to right click on the partition and restore the bootable flag. On a side note, the bootable flag should not interfere with the ability of Ubuntu to mount the partition.\nYou should try mounting the system on a LiveCD environment. (The Live CD has GParted installed by default.)\nIt is a Windows XP partition so I will assume that the drive is formatted as an NTFS drive. For the mount issues, at first you should check the output of # fdisk -cl. It should return some sort of output like this:\nroot@localdomain:/# fdisk -cl\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 80.0 GB, 80026361856 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 9729 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0xbb28bb28\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *           1        4570    36700160    7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda2            4570        9730    41447425    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5            4570        7059    19998720   83  Linux\n/dev/sda6            7060        9232    17447936   83  Linux\n/dev/sda7            9232        9730     3998720   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nWhere the /dev/sd something is the partition's identifier. To mount the partition, you will need to create a folder under the /media path, it will serve as the mount point. Execute the command # mkdir /media/external, then mount the partition with the command # mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/external, where /dev/sda1 is the identifier we retrieved from the above command output, and /media/external is the folder we just created.\n(Note: Commands prefixed with a # in this answer indicate that execution requires elevated, superuser (root) privileges. Under normal circumstances, you will need to prefix all commands with sudo to authorize yourself. So # apt-get install gparted turns $ sudo apt-get install gparted. # indicates a root, $ indicates a normal terminal session.)\n", "Q: Alternative to Compiz-Annotate for Kubuntu I'm looking for a way to freehand draw on my desktop so I can take screenshots like the one used in this answer.

My company is considering the use of Ubuntu as an OS for use on a hardware device.   \nIt would be installed on compact flash drive - apparently this is not standard flash drive but a specific type of memory that is supposed to \"cope\" with immediate power shutdown (I am not sure how this is achieved but they are supposedly a \"high end\" card).  \nThe units that would be run using Ubuntu are the type of units that will not be gracefully shutdown - the power cable would be removed and that is that.   \nCan anybody give me some advice on the potential problems that can occur? Is Ubuntu a good system that can deal with this kind of power outage and reboot successfully on next startup?   \nI realise that nothing is unbreakable, but is it a commonly used OS for an embedded setup? Is it asking for trouble to use Ubuntu in this kind of environment?\n\nA: The Operating System will be fine as long as it is setup for read-only use. LiveCD's have a setup like that, so that you can power them off at anytime, and the OS will not suffer harm.\nOn a read-write drive, ext4 filesystems are very resilient. But no matter the filesystem, any drive that is writable will be subject to corrupt files.\n\nA: \nNote: this answer is from the perspective of a production environment where data loss or downtime can lead to loss of money, customers, industrial equipment malfunctioning, etc. If you are just tinkering with a Raspberry Pi at home, I'd say there's no problem... :)\n\nI would not recommend Ubuntu in its default configuration, and the (default) ext4 filesystem by design, for an embedded environment where there would be repetitive \"ungraceful\" shutdowns like you suggest.\nIf I'm correct, you're using Ubuntu 8.04, which supports ext3 at best. While both ext3/ext4 use journaling as a way to maintain file (write) integrity and to aid in recovery, these should not be relied on when \"pull the power cable\" is the rule rather than the exception.\n\n\n*\n\n*The ideal option, assuming that your system will not need dynamic reconfiguration once set up, is to mount its root filesystem read-only and to entirely use a temporary in-memory partition when operational (like the LiveCD does). In this case, the system would return to its \"initial\" configuration whenever booted up.\n\n*To store (a limited amount of) user data in a non-volatile way, you could create a secondary partition, perhaps using a filesystem optimized for flash media such as JFFS2 depending on the internal structure of the CF card.  To reduce the chances of data corruption by pulling the plug, you could disable hardware write caching for the device, and mount it in synchronous (sync) mode, disabling write caching by the kernel. These options may severely affect throughput and performance, even on a \"high-end\" CF card, so you would have to take the intended use into consideration too.\n\n\nA: You are in emergency mode. After logging in, type \njournalctl -xb\n\nto view the system logs, systemctl reboot to reboot and systemctl default or exit to boot into default mode. \nPress Enter for maintenance  (or press CTRL-D to continue): \nI've seen that message everytime after power failure,  any Windows OS is far more resilient to power failure, than Linux as default configuration.\nI'n my city the power grid shutdown twice a month in summer.\n\nA: I have been using Ubuntu for about 18 months, and I've experimented with all sorts of programs and downloads. My opinion on Ubuntu is that it is far and away the the most stable operateing system available.\nPrograms and downloads that would have demolished windows OS's are just brushed aside by Ubuntu and Kubuntu, Ubuntu is really easy to use, has everything you could ever need, office and work applications are excellent, and it never gets a virus or trojens like Windows.\nKubuntu seems to have a few more toys, it's a bit harder to get to grips with but just as robust as ubuntu.

I have a new laptop which I am setting up as dual boot Windows/Linux.  \nI would like to access files from both Ubuntu and Windows 7.\nShould I create a separate NTFS partition?\n\nA: *\n\n*If you mean a boot partition, neither; Linux cannot boot off NTFS or exFAT. Additionally exFAT is not recommended for most uses because Ubuntu/Linux cannot currently write to exFAT.\n\n*You don't need a special partition to \"share\" files; Linux can read and write NTFS (Windows) just fine. On the other hand, consider the following alternatives if you want to create a \"shared\" partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*FAT32 (vfat): this relatively old-but-simple filesystem has excellent support on Linux (and is native to Windows); it's a good choice for occasional common files like music, small media, documents, etc. It has a 4GB maximum filesize limitation though.\n\n*ext2/ext3: these native Linux filesystems have good read/write support on Windows via third-party drivers such as ext2fsd. A good choice if you will be using this primarily in Ubuntu/Linux but need read/write support on Windows as well.\n\n\n\nA: Yes, it is very convenient to have a NTFS partition to share between Ubuntu and Windows.  In fact, my /home partition is NTFS.\nBut a word of caution, if you use hibernation feature.  Because hibernation does NOT unmount the partition, you really need to make sure to wake up to the right OS after hibernation.  Otherwise, you may face the danger of corrupted partition and losing data.\nIn a default installation, on waking up from hibernation, GRUB always highlight the first option (ubuntu on my GRUB), but that might not be the OS you hibernate from.  You can search about the options in GRUB configuration file so it always highlights the last booted OS option.  This way, you can avoid the trouble of waking up to the wrong OS.\n\nA: If you're using both Ubuntu and Windows, then yes, you should probably store files you want accessible by both in an NTFS partition. exFAT and FAT32 partitions are other options, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*exFAT is patent-encumbered, so support for it is not built in to Ubuntu by default. You can add it without too much trouble, but this is still more trouble than not having to add it at all.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remember, if you have to boot from an Ubuntu live CD for recovery purposes, the live CD won't have exFAT drivers even if your installed system does.\n\n*You may also want to check your local laws before installing exFAT, to determine whether or not you might incur civil liability due to patent problems. (I'm not trying to discourage you, and I'm not a lawyer. I just want you to be aware of potential issues.)\n\n\n*FAT32 doesn't support files larger than 4 GiB. These days, you may well have files that large, depending on what you're using your computer for.\n\n*Neither exFAT nor FAT32 support file ownership and permissions. This is usually quite minor when comparing them to NTFS, since while NTFS does support ownership and permissions, it's somewhat complicated to get them properly respected/used when mounting an NTFS volume in a non-Windows operating system like Ubuntu. You can do it, though.\nUnless you have a specific reason to do otherwise, your partition for sharing files between Ubuntu and Windows should probably be NTFS. Furthermore, it could even just be the Windows partition, as that is of type NTFS. You cannot install Ubuntu to an NTFS partition, though (except with Wubi, which installs it to a rewriteable disk image that resides inside an NTFS partition).\nSince Ubuntu is not as good at repairing damaged NTFS partitions as Windows (though there are Ubuntu utilities for this), you should probably avoid NTFS for machines where Ubuntu is the only operating system. (But for such a machine, you could use use Ubuntu's default partition type, ext4.)\n\nA: I know this is an old thread but it's going to be hit a lot with the new Dropbox partitioning rules. \nI was recently hit with the same issue using DropBox between Linux and Windows. Dropbox REQUIRES you to use NTFS for your dropbox files on Windows, and ext4 on Linux. This means that if you are sharing the Dropbox files between the two operating systems, ONE of them will NOT be able to sync. You have a few options, none of them ideal.\n\n\n*\n\n*Share an NTFS partition (NOT YOUR WINDOWS PARTITION) between your two operating systems. This will allow only the Windows Dropbox installation to sync, which means you may as well not even have DropBox installed on the Linux side. Just use Dropbox files normally in the Linux side, but realize that you will not get the automatic syncing that keeps the files backed up while you are in Linux. You'll have to periodically reboot into Windows to allow the files to sync. \nUnfortunately there's not a good way to do this the other direction (DropBox on Linux ext4, shared with Windows) because there's not a reliable read/write solution for accessing ext4 partitions from Windows. There are read-only solutions which will allow you to read the files from the Windows side, but not write them.\n\n*Have two different copies of your Dropbox files on the machine (One on ext4 for linux and one on NTFS for Windows). This will take up twice the space that is really necessary but I don't see any other option since DropBox rolled out this crappy rule that makes it impossible to effectively share your Dropbox files between multiple Operating systems.\n\nA: NTFS partitions are readable and writable out-of-the-box with Ubuntu. \nSo you could indeed create a separate NTFS partition to store the files you would like to access from both operating systems.\nYou could also simply mount your Windows partition when you need it. It will automatically show up in the file explorer's sidebar in Ubuntu. This would prevent you from creating an additional partition.\nThe choice is yours; either configuration is both plausible and safe.\n\nA: Yes, you should create a separate NTFS partition to share files between Ubuntu and Windows on your computer.   \nUbuntu can safely read and write files on the Windows partition itself.\nSo you do not really need a separate NTFS partition to share files.    \nI would still recommend a separate partition for important data that is for sharing between different OSes on the same computer.\n\nA: Yes,it is the best way to share things between ubuntu and win.\nNTFS is much better than exFAT.\nI have ubuntu and win7 on my PC and using the same way to share all i need in both and it work just great.\n\nA: WARNING:  I have lost data with a shared NTFS partition between my Ubuntu 11.10 and WinXP.  \nSay if I hibernate winXP.  Then boot into Ubuntu and copy some files over to the shared partition.  Then shutdown ubuntu and reboot (from hibernation) WinXP.  Then sometimes it loses the directory or files where I had copied from ubuntu  (they are just not there). Also, I am unable to delete the parent folder.  Doing a complete checkdisk will help to fix the errors (though those files seem lost forever).  \nOver several experiments and several files lost,  I have learned the following:  If you are going to use the shared partition, make sure you are not using hibernate either in windows or in ubuntu when copying over data from one OS session to another. \nThere does not yet seem to be a simple safe solution to data sharing between the two OS's.  :-( \n\nA: Yes, NTFS is the way to go. \nExFAT partitions are prone to corruption due to the lack of journaling or some more advanced alternative, and can currently be only repaired on Windows. ExFAT also doesn't support symbolic links, which are required by some programs. NTFS doesn't have those problems. \nBut there might be some ownership and permission problems with a shared NTFS partitions, causing problems for standard users on non-Windows operating systems. That can be prevented by adding a line in /etc/fstab to mount the NTFS partition during boot with mount options defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=000.\n", "Q: Wired/Wirless Connection not available after Ubuntu 12.04 install on Win7 I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a NTFS partition on my Windows 7 machine. After installation Ubuntu will not connect to a network either Wired or Wireless. Windows 7 Networks work fine.\nUbuntu recognizes Wireless networks, prompt for authorization, yet cannot connect. \nifconfig shows local loopback (lo) and ethernet (wlan0) with no errors, no dropped packets, no overruns.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: First, go to Additional Drivers and install all drivers. Your Wi-Fi network works fine as far as I can tell. Try to connect to Wi-Fi network using:\niwconfig wlan0 essid <Networkname>\ndhcpcd -d -t 10 wlan0\n\nOr maybe your local network is off.

I would like to find a way to not require root authentication after installing the *deb file. I have tried adding a script to the users crontab but it seems that would require the restart of crond. (which needs either root or a reboot) I was wondering if there was a project I should look at to see an example of a daemon in python or how I could go about this? Thank you in advance for any help and feel free to tell me I'm wrong!\n\nA: Daemons are usually run by root (although they sometimes change the user under they run).\nFor a normal notification you don't need to create a daemon, just create a normal program and let it run at the start of a session. This way it will run with user privileges, and you will run a separate instance for each user.\nI have done this program, it's a bit more complex than what you need, as it uses different libraries to run in different systems but it is quite simple and maybe a good example.\n", "Q: Unity 3D and Gnome 3 aren't working When I first got my laptop, Unity 3D worked fine.  Then, suddenly, it stopped.  Then, regardless of which desktop environment I chose, it booted Unity 2D. I tried installing my ATI/AMD graphics drivers, and only the non-post-release on installs.  That doesn't even fix the issue.\nAssuming it was an issue with Unity, I installed Gnome 3.  To my surprise, the same issue occurred again!  When I told it to boot Gnome, it went to Gnome Classic.

Try to turn off the network in network-manager and then restart your laptop, login in Unity 3D.

You must enable them to get full 3D.\nWhat are the results of: \n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\nand \nglxinfo\n\n\nA: It's similar for me. A few minutes ago I've updated some packages of Gnome Classic and after that when I exited from my session Unity 3D and Gnome Classic didn't work anymore. But Unity 2D and Gnome Shell ran fine. \nFirst, I thought that ATI drivers crashed.

I have a Western Digital external hard drive that has plenty of space for more than one OS. I currently have three partitions one 250 GB for backups one 100 GB with Ubuntu and 500 GB or so miscellaneous. When I go to boot off the drive all I see is the title of the drive (My Passport 0730), it does not see the partitions is there any way around this?\nI got it to work\nMount the drive (or part) that u want and know what it is called (this is what i did not know) its not like windows where there is the dirve name (ex. X:\\ or Passport in my case) its the mount location or something ... select it when installing and it works:)\n\nA: What you need to do is boot the LiveCD and chroot into the Ubuntu system on the USB drive, then install grub2\nFirst thing to do is identify what the device name of the Live file system is.  In most cases this will be /dev/sdb, if there is only one other drive in the system, but it could be something else depending the configuration of your hardware.\nA little more complicated is to identify which partition Ubuntu lives on.  This will depend on exactly how you installed Ubuntu so it's best to check and be sure.  Once you've booted the LiveCD use either Disk Manager or Gparted to look at the hard drive and identify the Ubuntu root (/) partition that you set up.  You would be looking for an ext4 partition of the correct size.\nFor the purposes of these instructions I'm going to assume the correct device (drive) is /dev/sdb and that the partition is /dev/sdb3.  You should substitute the correct device names as appropriate.\nFirstly, in a terminal window mount the Ubuntu root partition:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb3 /mnt\n\nNext, export the LiveCD filesystem to the root filesystem on the drive:\nsudo mount ‐‐bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount ‐‐bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount ‐‐bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\nNow change the root filesystem to the hard disk:\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nNow install grub2 to /dev/sdb\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdb\n\nAt this point, while grub2 is installed it might not know about all the filesystems available, such as a windows partition on the hard drive or another Linux partition on either drive.\nTo fix this run update-grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nand it will find all OS's on your system and add them to the grub menu.  You should now be able to boot off the external drive and select the Ubuntu partition or any others to boot from\nI note that there is no mention of a swap partition in your configuration.  This is not likely to be a problem if there is plenty of RAM in your system and you never want to hibernate the computer.  You will still be able to suspend the computer but this does continue to use a small amount of power.\nThe correct way to do this at the time of installation is to specify the correct hard drive to install the grub bootloader to.  This might require selecting the manual configuration instead of the default one, then selecting the correct drive to install grub to.  It's also possible to install grub to the internal hard drive and have it configured to boot Ubuntu off the external USB drive.\n", "Q: Can Kwin be used in Unity? Unity has a nice layout.  I really do like the Ambiance and Radiance themes.  However, I just feel that the window manager itself is lacking.  KWin has an excellent tiling mode that automatically handles all my window needs without having to drag, resize, or keypress.  I can focus on the information and the work.\nMy question to you is:  Is there a way to get Kwin or another similar tiling window manager to work within Unity so that I can have the benefits of both worlds?\n\nA: I've been using Unity-2D with KWin for about two weeks now. In the login screen, choose Unity-2D as your session type. Install the kde-window-manager package to get kwin. Then fire up a terminal and run kwin --replace &!. You'll probably want the systemsettings and kde-config-gtk packages for configuration.\n", "Q: Virtual PC error, Unable to boot - please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU I use Virtual PC with Windows 7 Unlimited version, I have AMD processor, I have installed Windows XP mode, which works fine, I would like to install Ubuntu Linux Operating System, but unable so far, I have searched in Google and still cannot fix.\nThe error message is:\n\nThis kernel requires an x86-64 CPU, but only detected an i686 CPU.\n  Unable to boot - please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU.\n\nI created a new disk in Virtual PC 512M, and download .iso file(s), it gives the same error whether I use 32 bit or 64 bit one.

One of the major selling points for VirtualPC is that you can run WindowsXP apps without running a separate instance of a complete Windows XP virtual machine (like VMWare Fusion on OSX).  That functionality, however, would not be available at all if you try to install a non-Windows operating system in VirtualPC.\nYour best bet, if you are truly interested in running Ubuntu inside Windows 7, is to try one of the other virtualization offerings out there.

Everyone knows that in general, Nvidia has the best supported graphics cards under Linux. But I don't want to buy into Nvidia's proprietary drivers if I don't have to. ATI has open source drivers, but they have almost no support, and their open source drivers are significantly worse than their closed source drivers. Intel has open source drivers, but their graphics are all integrated and built into the motherboard.\nAre there any graphics card manufacturers which have open source drivers and are actually friendly with the open source community? I would gladly like to purchase from them if they exist.\n\nA: The answer is a little complicated, but goes like this:\nNvidia's open-source driver is really bad (thanks to them being stubborn), but their proprietary driver gives pretty much the best performance of any GPU on Linux.\nAMD's open-source driver is better, but still not really good enough to match your investment in a modern video card, so you'll end up resorting to their proprietary driver, which is not as good as Nvidia's.\nSo: if you're serious about wanting to go entirely open-source, AMD is a slightly better option (though still dissatisfying -- honestly, Intel graphics are probably the only ones whose open-source driver compares well to their Windows performance nowadays, and that wasn't true until 2012), but if you're willing to use proprietary drivers, Nvidia is best.\nNote that this assumes that you're using <5 year old hardware, willing to spend north of $100 on your GPU, and have some interest in modern games.\n\nA: There are only three competitors in the GPU market that play a significant role and you just named them all.

I've seen the solutions where people had to change file extensions to .php4 and run them through cgi handler, but I don't have that as an option for either php4 or php5. Too many files and the codebase is shared. \nFirst question, can I install php4 as a module as well? followup, what's best way to do that?\nsecond question, can I have the handler that switches to php4 do so on a directory path instead of just *.php4? So I could tell it a list of directories or use multiple <Directory> blocks to have just php files in those directories run as php4.\nthanks,\n- keith\n\nA: php4 and php5 are incompatible with each other.  You will either need to use the old, unsupported version (which you will ahve to build from source), or use php5 and update your systems.  You cannot run them both simultaneously without breakage.\n\nA: You could set up php4 to run under a different webserver entirely, either apache 1.3 or lighthttpd.  Just set that webserver to listen on a different port (not port 80), and either use that directly or set up some amount of rewriterules in apache2 to direct the php4 requests to the other webserver. \nThat would be a lot of work and setup though, potentially more than just using CGI.\n\nA: For the first question, I don't believe this is wise even if possible - which it may be, I don't know anyone who has tried it.\nFor the second question, you can indeed do this.\nHowever, you need to tell Apache which handler to use for the folders containing your PHP4 application.\nThe normal way to make php4 run as cgi is:\nAdd Handler php-script .php4\nAction php-script /cgi-bin/php4\n\nBut this isn't quite what you want so we need to change to something like this:\nRemoveHandler .php \nAdd Handler php-script .php\nAction php-script /cgi-bin/php4\n\nYou may need to add an ExecCGI option to the applications root folder too.\nI can't test that at the moment so there's a chance it wont work. As an alternative, you could put in a rewrite that changed all .php file requests to .php4\nNote that this is all dependent on having sufficient rights to make these changes either in a .htaccess file or in an apache conf file (which requires rights to restart the apache server).\nUPDATE: the more I think about my answer the less I think it will work. Checking the mod_php5 conf file, I can see that the handler is actually set against a mime type application/x-httpd-php so you'd have to adjust that as well I think. \nSo maybe the rewrite is best.\nThere is another possibility though. If you have access to the apache configuration files, you could empty /etc/apache/mods-available/php5.conf and move the contents into a site specific configuration. Then you could put a php4 specific configuration into another virtual host or even into a folder - though in that case, you'll probably need to include the php5 config in several places (for each application root folder on your web server).\nUPDATE 2: In fact, the answer to quesition 1 is also \"yes\", this is, in fact possible. You can run both by making use of suPHP. Though you should read about the possible limitations of running PHP this way.\n", "Q: Denied access to an ext4 partition after doing a `mount -a` command I have installed a second internal hard drive.

(Of course, any graphical commands should use a graphical frontend like gksu/gksudo, and not sudo directly.)\n\n*anyapplication is the name of the graphical application normaluser wants to run as root. normaluser knows admin's password and has (presumably) been told s/he may use it for this purpose.\n\nThe Problem\nThe cause of your problem, and the reason most of the other answers so far don't work (with the exception of Marty Fried's excellent answer), is:\n\n*\n\n*gksu can be configured to use either sudo or su as its backend. The default behavior of gksu in Ubuntu is to act as a frontend for sudo, not for su. That is to say that, by default, gksu and gksudo behave exactly the same. See the manpage.\n\n*normaluser is not an administrator and thus cannot run commands as root with sudo. sudo prompts for the password of the user running it, not the password of the user they want to become. Not being able to use your password to perform actions as people who aren't you is what it means to not be an administrator.\n\n*normaluser, provided it is not a Guest account,  can run commands as another user with su, putting in the other user's password. But gksu acts as a frontend for sudo, not su.\n\n*normaluser cannot directly run any command as root, because normaluser cannot use sudo, and nobody can become root with su because there is no root password.\n\nThe Solution\nThe solution requires writing a command that performs two authentication steps:\n\n*\n\n*normaluser must become admin to run a graphical command. To do this, normaluser must run gksu with the -w flag to make it run in su-mode instead of the default sudo-mode, and the -u flag to run the command as admin instead of root.\n\n*The command run as admin must invoke gksu without the -w flag to use sudo to become root.\n\nHere's the command (yes, I have tested it ;-)):\ngksu -w -u admin gksu anyapplication\nYou will be prompted for a password twice:\n\n*\n\n*First, you must enter admin's password, to let normaluser run a command as admin with the su backend.\n\n*Second, you must enter admin's password, to let admin run a command as root with the sudo backend.\n\nThat's right. You enter admin's password twice.\nMiscellaneous notes:\n\n*\n\n*If you wish, you can replace the second gksu with gksudo to make it less confusing. In Ubuntu, they are equivalent. (You can also replace the first gksu with gksudo, but that would be extremely counterintuitive and confusing.)\n\n*-w is the short form of --su-mode.\n\n*-S is the short form of --sudo-mode but neither has to be used because sudo-mode is the default.\n\n*You may want to test this with some pretty harmless command first, to make sure it does what you want. (It will, but there's no need for you to trust me on that.) For example:  gksu -w -u admin gksu xclock\nxclock is a nice simple clock-window application.\n\n\nA: For me worked this:\npkexec env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY XAUTHORITY=$XAUTHORITY yourcommand commandoption1 commandoption2\n\nHere you have to replace the yourcommand commandoption1 commandoption2 part with real command and it's args\n\nA: One way that will probably work is to use \"sux\" rather than \"su\" when you first switch to the admin user.  sux fixes the problem of running x applications from the spoofed user.  It is in the standard repo, and can be installed by entering sudo apt-get install sux at a commandline.\nThen, just use \"sux\" instead of \"su\" and it should work the way you expect.\nLets reuse the example of the application xclock:\nsux admin\ngksu xclock\n\n\nA: PAM can take care of it\nThis works for me on Ubuntu 16.04 (edit: it works too on 18.04 LTS):\nput the line: \nsession optional pam_xauth.so\n\nsomewhere in:\n/etc/pam.d/su\n\nand/or\n/etc/pam.d/sudo\n\nand then doing \"su -\" or \"sudo su -\" I can use graphical apps as root.\n\nA: In Lubuntu, there's a tool called lxqt-sudo. It's in the official repositories.\nIt works!\nlxqt-sudo/groovy, now 0.15.0-0ubuntu1 amd64, is a Graphical Qt frontend for plain sudo.\nhttps://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/lxqt-sudo\n\nA: Instead of \nsu admin\ngksu anyapplication ...\nI suggest you to try gksu -u admin anyapplication, where you do everything using the gksu command itself.\nAlso please make note that you have to enter the password of the user mentioned in the command, ie, in this case you have to enter admin's password.\n\nA: I would typically use the following logic in my scripts so that they will always request privilege escalation themselves using the appropriate method:\n\nload_function_library\n\nif [[ ${UID} -eq 0 ]] ; then\n    # Execute only in the case of elevated privileges:\n    if hash dialog ; then\n        if ( dialog --backtitle \"$( basename $0 )\" --title \"${BRAND} tools updater: NOTICE!\" --yesno \"\\nMay I update the ${BRAND} OEM tools on your system now?\" 20 80 ) ; then\n            clear && do_update\n        else\n            clear && exit\n        fi\n    else\n        echo -e $YELLOW\n        echo \"Hello $SUDO_USER ...

You only need to run the above command from a normal user session and the application will be run as root.\n\nA: You should use:\ngksudo AppName\n\nThis brings up a graphical password request first (your user's password), and then starts the GUI-app as root (I just tried, it really does. Funny thing: I tried gksu AppName immediately thereafter, and that worked as well -- as it is probably supposed to, as the \"gk\" prefix suggests. So I'm not completely sure where your problem may be located).\n\nA: There is only one super user and that is root.  \nUser 1 is an admin and has sudo rights.\nUser 2 is not an admin and does not have sudo rights.  \nTry logging in as user 1 then using the command  \ngksudo app-name  \n\n(replacing app-name with the app name)\nHope that helps - let me know. :o)  \nEDIT : More info as requested  \nIf it is just you on the computer,\nthen using user 1 (who has permission to use sudo)\nis no different to using user 2 (who does not have permission to use sudo).\nUser 1 has the same rights as user 2.\nUnless user 1 issues a command prefixed with sudo and / or provides their password to allow applications to run with root privelages.\nThe only difference is that user 2 cannot run apps as root.  \nHope that helps explain it a bit for you. :o)\n", "Q: Default screen magnifier? I'm trying to get an Ubuntu laptop functional for a visually impaired friend. Her impairment is such that a screen magnifier would solve the issue.  I've tried out Kmag (as its the only hit when searching the software center for \"magnifier\"), but it seems odd the Ubuntu lacks a default.  So I'm assuming I'm missing something obvious.\n\nA: With Cinnamon desktop\nI'm visually impaired (I have Cone Dystrophy and thus my central vision is gone and I absolutely have to use full screen zooming to use a computer). \nThis was my solution:\nFirst of all, get rid of Unity and install the Cinnamon desktop;  it's a much better interface anyway IMNSHO:\nOnce you have that installed, you can install Tobias Quinn's excellent gnome-shell-mousewheel-zoom.\nThis will provide Compiz-style mousewheel zooming functionality with Cinnamon.\nAnother alternative is to use Linux Mint which is an Ubuntu-based distro with Cinnamon built in by default.\nIf you choose this option, you simply have to add the Tobias Quinn PPA and install the gnome-shell-mousewheel-zoom package.\nCanonical has abandoned visually impaired users and their actions are, to say the least, reprehensible and shameful.  Every other OS creator provides quality full-screen zooming support for visually impaired users but since the advent of Unity, the actions of the devs of Ubuntu indicate that they no longer care about those users.  I'll continue to use Ubuntu-based distros but Unity is now permanently on my \"no-fly\" list.\n\nA: Gnome Shell / Ubuntu 17.10+\nIn Ubuntu 18.04 you don't need to install anything.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> Keyboard by using the Applications icon  at the\nbottom-left end of your screen.\n\n*From there, scroll down to the Universal Access section.\n\n*Then setup the 3 keyboard shortcuts you wish to use for the magnifer:\n\n\n*\n\n*turn on/off zoom, zoom in, and zoom out.\n\n\n\nVisually: \n\nA: Literally every UNIX X11-enabled system typically has a set of tools, including a magnifier utility in question.

Here it is:\n$ which xmag\n/usr/bin/xmag\n\n$ man xmag | egrep -A1 '(NAME|AUTHOR)'\nNAME\n       xmag - magnify parts of the screen\n--\nAUTHORS\n       Dave Sternlicht and Davor Matic, MIT X Consortium.\n\n\nA: xzoom\nI found a simple solution that is working very well for me. I installed xzoom from the default repositories.\nThe usage is very simple, and exactly what I wanted:\n\n\n*\n\n*start xzoom.\n\n*place the window where it does not disturb you.\n\n*\"drag\" your mouse cursor from within the window to the spot of the screen you want to magnify.\n\n\n\nAdditional note: I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 and before discovering xzoom, I tried the approaches suggested in the accepted solution. My experiences:\n\n\n*\n\n*In ccsm I failed to find the \"Magnifier\". Under \"Accessibility\" I have an \"Enhanced Desktop Zoom\", but it is not really clear to me how it works, and I don't like to enable a global shortcut for this.\n\n*The Virtual Magnifying Glass is not in the repositories, and the downloaded version does not like my libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so.0 (at first it did not find my installed libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so; fixing LD_LIBRARY_PATH turns out that it is not a 64-bit executable...).\n\n\n\nAnother alternative I found is gpick, which is also available natively on Ubunutu. It works by showing a zoomed in window in the left area -- and the zoomed area follows the mouse cursor:\n\nCompared to xzoom it seems to lack the possibility to scale and resize the zoom window, but offers the additional feature of picking pixel colors -- which sometimes is a related use case for me.\n\nA: Unity (until Ubuntu 17.04)\nCompizConfig Settings Manager\nTo use magnifier in Ubuntu, you can do so by using CompizConfig Settings Manager. If you don't have it installed, you can do so from the Ubuntu Software Center.\nOr, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nYou can also use Synaptic Package Manager\nOnce you invoke the program, look under Accessibility for magnifier, and click on it to configure it.\n\n\nOr you can try Virtual Magnifying Glass 3.5\n\nA: I am not aware of any default screen magnifier in Ubuntu.   \nIn many applications you can hold Ctrl then scroll the middle mouse button to zoom the screen, or pressing +/-.\nI have upvoted your question because I would also like to know of a better alternative to Kmag and I'm sure many other users would too, especially those in similar situations to your friend.\n\nA: This might not be the answer you want but so you know there is also the gnome-shell magnifier which would require you to install gnome-shell and remove unity in Ubuntu. \nI wrote a how-to on installing gnome 3.10 on ubuntu on my blog which might be useful if you are interested in trying this out. GNOME Shell 3.10 magnifier has focus and caret tracking as well as mousetracking which I think is not offered by many. \nHowever, the caret and focus tracking settings are still controlled via gsettings in case you want to turn either of them off and cannot find out where to do that. Additionally the magnified view cannot provide a scaled level of magnification at the moment so expect larger magnification levels to lead to a lower quality graphic until that is improved.\nMore information about that is in another post about GNOME Shell's magnifier scaling which may be of use to you. It also explains how to scale the desktop view via gsettings without any magnifier at all.\n\nA: Virtual Magnifying Glass\nTo me, Virtual Magnifying Glass is the best for portable computers.\nYes, as reported in a previous post, there is a specific problem with Ubuntu LTS 14.04 Trusty 64 bit (no problem with older 64 bit versions of Ubuntu, neither with 32 bit versions). If you dont feel like compiling the source of VMG, you may manually install the contents of the i586.rpm of the 3.2.1-1 version. The application executable file was \"magnifier\" instead of \"vmg\", and it works under Trusty 64 bit. Compared with the latest versions of VMG, you will lose direct control of zoom factor by mouse wheel in the magnified window, that's all, and this older version of VMG is still the best inmho.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 16.04\n\nPress Ctrl + Alt + T\nThe terminal opens, type\nsudo apt install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nGo to Ubuntu icon on Top Left corner of desktop\n\nClick on it and type compiz\n\nClick on the compiz icon that appers in the window\nThe following window opens:\n\nClick on OK\nGo to Accebility --> Enhanced Zoom Desktop --> Tick the box\n\nClick on Enhanced Zoom Desktop\n\nClick on Zoom In Key --> Disabled\n\nTick the box Enabled\n\nClick on Grab Key Combination\n\nPress together\nCtrl + F7\n\nClick on OK\n\nClick on Zoom Out Key --> Disabled\n\nTick on the box Enabled\n\nClick on Grab Key Combination\n\nPress  together\nCtrl + F6\n\nClick on OK\n\nClose the window\n\nFrom now on \nto Zoom In press\nCtrl + F7\nand to Zoom Out press\nCtrl + F6\n\nA: There is another answer to press Print Screen and to use your image viewer.

Then I rebooted but the display only showed,\nfor a very long time, the word \"ubuntu\" and orange dots moving over a purple\nbackground. There was no login prompt. I was not able to use key sequences such\nas Ctrl-Alt-F1 to Ctrl-Alt-F7 (or Alt-F1 to Alt-F7) to obtain a text terminal.\nAll of these key sequences were ignored. I rebooted multiple times and this behavior\nalways occurs. What is the easiest way to obtain login access to the system?\n\nA: Reboot the computer and keep the SHIFT key pressed in order to access the boot options. Select \"recovery mode\". This should allow you to login in your system again.\n\nA: Trying to change a 12.04 LTS system from LightDM to xdm by installing the xdm package and then running dpkg-reconfigure lightdm to select xdm apparently does not work. \nThe failure mode is that a normal boot hangs forever on the \"orange dots - purple background\" screen, and it is necessary to use recovery mode to access the system. One or both of these other two steps will apparently fix the problem: \n\n\n*\n\n*delete the /etc/init/lightdm.conf file and/or \n\n*edit the /etc/init/plymouth-stop.conf file, locate the line beginning with gdm|kdm and change this line to begin with xdm|gdm|kdm instead.\n\n\nI most likely will not research this further and most likely will not submit a bug report myself. I do not know whether either of the steps mentioned above is considered a supported or recommended configuration change. Also, I do not know whether use of xdm is considered a supported activity on 12.04 LTS.\n\nA: Same problem happened to me.\nGo to tty1 with Control + Alt + F1.\nThen I ran \nlightdm \n\nfrom there.The login screen appeared this time.Also I will try to apply the fix listed above\nedit the /etc/init/plymouth-stop.conf file, \nlocate the line beginning with gdm|kdm and\nchange this line to begin with xdm|gdm|kdm instead.\n", "Q: How to install Network Adapter Drivers for Atheros AR8161/8165 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (NDIS 6.20) Ubuntu 12.04 How can I install drivers for 64-bit Atheros AR8161/8165 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (NDIS 6.20) for Ubuntu 12.04.

I would like to repurpose the computer using old DOS software. I am having the problem that DOS 5.0 won't recognize hard disk with Ubuntu on it. So I cannot reformat C: and experience joy. Will the Ubuntu disk I installed with help me uninstall the program?\n\nA: Yes, you need to boot the Ubuntu installation disc and use gparted to format the hard disk as Fat so that DOS will recognise it & the filesystem. \n\nA: First of all, there is no way to \"uninstall\" ubuntu. When you want another OS, you simply let the new installer overwrite all the data on the hard drive. Also, DOS not recognizing the hard drive has nothing to do with ubuntu being installed on it.\nIt is important to understand the difference between a hard drive and a partion. A physical hard drive is the device you put inside your computer, and it will usually be identified by ubuntu as something like \"/dev/sda\". A partition, on the other hand, is a logical section of the drive, which ubuntu would show as something similar to \"/dev/sda1\". In this example it indicates that it is the first partition of the drive \"sda\". Partitions can be created, deleted or formatted, and you can have several on a single drive.\nWhen you talk about \"C:\", you actually mean the partition that Windows usually creates to install itself on. This partition is not present in this case and doesn't need to be in order to install any OS.\nNow to solve your problem, is the DOS installer not detecting the physical drive, or does it not recognize the partition? If it can't find the hard drive, you may be out of luck, although I suggest you ask someone who is good with DOS. If the hard drive is recognized, you should try to create a new partition table and a new partition. In case the installer doesn't support this, you should boot from an ubuntu CD, and run GParted. This program will allow you to create the partition that DOS needs.\n\nA: MS DOS 5.0 was released in 1991 and is not maintained by Microsoft any longer. How old is this computer? Since it can run Feisty the hardware can't be that old. MS DOS 5.0 is not appropriate for hardware newer than 2000 and will cause problems like driver issues. If you really want to run DOS on that machine try Free DOS instead, it has the advantage of being still maintained. Another solution would be to install DOSbox or use VirtualBox and set up a virtual machine to install Free DOS in there. You probably want to install a more recent and lightweight Linux distribution first.\n", "Q: Is the 64 bit version of 12.04 the same as the alternate 64 bit? Specifically, is the 64 bit version of the ISO I can download directly from ubuntu.com the same as the \"alternate\" 64 bit version that is available through the Universal USB installer?\n\nA: The two versions are simply different installers, and will both install the same version of ubuntu. The alternate installer is meant to be used if, for some reason, the regular one doesn't work. The end result won't be different though. I would recommend that you use the regular installer whenever possible as it will offer a more user-friendly experience, but you can always use the alternate version if need be.\n", "Q: Can't Compile in NTFS Partition I want to compile  a source code in a NTFS  partiotion but can not as shown in the following picture:\n\nAlthough i can write files into that partition but Compile NOT!\nHow can i solve it?\n\nA: It's not a good idea using a NTFS partition to compile source code because usually the compiling generates executable files, which need the execute file permission, not provided by NTFS. \n\nA: One way is to use permissions options which will let you change permissions of your indiviual file thus making it possible to be executed. If you mount the ntfs partition with the permissions option, then chmod / chown will work\n/dev/sda2   /mnt/excess ntfs-3g    permissions,locale=en_US.utf8    0   0\n\nYou can then\nsudo chown your_user:your_user /mnt/excess\n\n\nA: You can not compile because your file does not has executable permission. And you can not set file permission which is in ntfs partition because you did not mount your partition with write permission(But you can copy, cut, paste file). Easy solution is use ntfs-config\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\nsudo ntfs-config\n\nEnable write permission for Internal and External device\n\nOr you can set your fstab manually(ntfs-config just set your fstab). Your fstab should look like this..\n#Entry for /dev/sda5 :\nUUID=7818C41F18C3DA70   /media/Local    ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.UTF-8 0 0\n#Entry for /dev/sda6 :\nUUID=7ED0CAEED0CAABA9   /media/Office   ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.UTF-8 0 0\n\n\nA: This is very relevant https://askubuntu.com/a/208349/11212\nadding\n someWeirdId  /media/name  ntfs  auto,stuff,stuff,stuff,**uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0000**  0  0\n", "Q: Installing or running ubuntu from USB I made a boot USB and stuck it in before I launched my computer. \nThe Ubuntu screen appeared in black, with options, I chose to install on it on my hard-drive.

When I boot it up, it takes me to the GRUB bootloader, and I select the 12.04 Server option. After that, things are slightly inconsistent. Usually, I will see some of the text fly through on the screen as it's loading it all up, and then the whole machine suddenly reboots without ever fully loading. Sometimes, it will be a black screen for a few seconds, and then restart. And rarely, it will be black, and just hang up indefinitely until I have to force a shutdown.\nIf I boot into recovery mode from GRUB, and then once at the recovery screen select normal and continue on, everything works just fine, and I can get on and use the server as expected.\nAt first, I ended up just reformatting the entire drive and doing a completely fresh install, this time with a CD instead of the USB, but I still get the same issue.\nAlso, to add to the mystery, before I had 12.04 Server, I had 12.04 Desktop doing the exact same thing. 12.04 Desktop is still installed on the second hard drive in the server if that's relevant, but I eventually plan to clear that all off, so I'm only looking to get 12.04 Server running.

The options are nicely explained there.\nThe Debian alternatives system is an interface between command used by an user for a particular function and the command chosen by system administrator for that functionality. This is a way by which admin can change the underlying command for that function without interfering with the command used by the user. Suppose an user use the command editor to edit a file and admin links the command to vi with update-alternatives via /etc/alternatives/editor; then a better editor vim becomes available and admin changes the link to vim, the user will still be able to edit a file with editor command.\nThe syntax is \n\nupdate-alternatives --install link name path priority\n\n\n\n*\n\n*link = master command for user's use (e.g. /usr/bin/java which is accessible with just java because /usr/bin is searched for any commands by default)\n\n*name = name of the intermediate link under /etc/alternatives directory working as the interface between user's command and actual command(e.g. java which creates /etc/alternatives/java; user's command /usr/bin/java points to it. This is why you have to write java)\n\n*path = actual command set by administrator(e.g. /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/java; /etc/alternatives/java links to it)\n\n*priority = the command used by default, this is set by admin(e.g. 1 for highest priority or default, 2 for next highest priority and so on)\n\n\nSo, with this settings if you have more than one java installation, e.g. OpenJDK and Oracle's JDK then you can choose between them while keep using java as the command as an user and by setting the priority with update-alternatives --config java as administrator, which is actually changing the link between /etc/alternatives/java and the actual java program. \nThere is actually no difference between JDK's java and JRE's java. In fact in a JDK installation JDK's java is a symbolic link to JRE's java.\n", "Q: Unknown option -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true I'm trying to speed up NetBeans on Ubuntu.\nI was reading about that on http://performance.netbeans.org/howto/jvmswitches/\nI get this error:\nsh /home/umpirsky/Applications/netbeans-7.2rc1/bin/netbeans -J-Xverify:none -J-Xmx384m -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true\nUnknown option -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true\n\nShould I use some special version of Java?\n\nA: I don't like to resurrect old threads, but the OP forgot to prepend with -J the flag in the file netbeans.conf:\n-J-Dsun.java2d.opengl=True\n\nThese are my configuration flags, and netbeans runs smoothly:\nnetbeans_default_options=\"-J-server -J-Xverify:none -J-XX:+AggressiveOpts -J-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -J-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -J-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=True -J-Dawt.nativeDoubleBuffering=True -J-Dsun.java2d.opengl=True -J-Xss32m -J-Xms64m -J-Xmx256m -J-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=True -J-Dsun.java2d.dpiaware=True -J-Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=True\"\n\nFor more info: See this guide on the Oracle website\n\nA: As the name sun.java2d... indicates, this is (or was)an option for the Sun/Oracle JVM, and is probably not supported by Ubuntu's default OpenJDK JVM.\nYou would have to install the Oracle JDK/JRE to see if that option works.

For how to do that, please see this question:\n\nHow do I make java default to a manually installed JRE/JDK?\n\n\nA: It's a good idea to download Eclipse from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ as the one from the Ubuntu repos is always shockingly out of date. Given Java's recent security scandals, I prefer to get the latest JDKs from the website itself http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html and I don't need to give them root access.\nSo in Eclipse to change the default JVM/JRE:\nWindow-Preferences-Java-Installed JREs\nfrom there you can ADD another JVM e.g version 8 etc by pointing to the JVM's location.

The question is about a mild problem, plus a curiosity.\nWhen I suspend my netbook (leave it suspended for some hours) and bring it back, my youtube videos keep playing for a short while, then stop. My guess is that, while there is a bit of the video in cache, the plugin cant re-establish the connection to youtube.\nWhy does this happen ? Is there a way to fix it ?\nMaybe its some kind of intrinsic limitation of the http protocol, maybe just something poorly done, or maybe a problem in my setup =P\n\nA: I would suspect that it is more that Youtube has canceled the download stream.  If they didn't, I would think that the bandwidth you were using when you suspended would just be waiting indefinitely for you to reconnect and unavailable to another user.  \nJust think of how hard it would be for you to watch a Youtube video if 50% of the servers bandwidth was reserved for a bunch of computers that were not going to connect again for the next 12 hours.\nI could be wrong here but I would be surprised if I am not at least very close to the truth.\nP.S. You would be right about the cache having a bit of the video loaded in the buffer and when that plays out is when the video freezes, but it is not fixable if the video stream that it was loading has ended.\n", "Q: Battery management doesn't recognize removal of power supply I have a Lenovo Y460p running Ubuntu 12.04 (64-bit).  The battery does charge normally, but unplugging the power supply only very briefly shows the correct battery indicator.  After about 1 second, it reverts to the charging indicator.  \nIf the power supply is connected the power statistics show:\n\"Supply Yes\"\n\"Online Yes\"\n\nIf it is not connected it shows:\n\"Supply Yes\"\n\"Online No\"\n\nMy problem is almost exactly like the one in this post:\nUbuntu 11.10 power management does not recognize removal of power supply\nThe only exception is that my system does not dual-boot with Windows.  This is Ubuntu only.  The computer in the other post is a Lenovo as well; not sure if that has anything to do with it.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.\n\nA: I have a Lenovo Z470 notebook and I found the same problem when installing Ubuntu 12.04 in dual boot with Windows 7. I'm not an expert on this field but I'll describe my experience (it might help).\nI have found that some Lenovo laptops, including my own and I'm not sure which other models, include an utility named Lenovo Energy Management in Windows 7 that allows users to select whether to charge to 100% to maximize runtime, or charge only partially to maximize lifespan of the battery.\nHere is what the utility looks like:\n\nPertaining this utility I have noticed two things:\n\n*\n\n*In Ubuntu, in order to be able to charge the battery to 100% the Optimize for Battery Runtime must have been selected previously in Windows 7 (I don't know if this can be controlled from Ubuntu directly, perhaps an expert could help us in that issue).\n\n*Now the bigger problem is that once you have selected the Optimize for Battery Lifespan option, even if it was only one time and you select the Optimize for Battery Runtime option again before booting Ubuntu, the Ubuntu battery indicator will indicate the battery is charging even if the power supply is not connected to the computer. So, in order to prevent this from happening you should avoid using the Lenovo Energy Management utility if you plan to use Ubuntu afterward, either clean install or dual boot.\n\nSince most of us have already used this option at least once, I have found a workaround proposed in a thread in ubuntuforums.org proposed by member achilleas.k (not my credit). I'll cite:\n\nShut down the laptop.\nRemove AC power.\nRemove the battery.\nHold the power button for about 10 seconds.\n\nThis seemed to work for achilleas.k, some other users in that forum, and certainly is working for me. I know it's not a permanent solution, especially for those of us using both Ubuntu and Windows, but it sure helps meanwhile. Perhaps a more expert Linux user can help us out to find a formal solution using this info.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: I'm having the same problem, and as I didn't found the answer in these forums I decided to look somewhere else.\nI found this page with an apparent explanation of the problem (seems to be something kernel related) and a possible workaround: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/power-management/2012-April/000043.html\n\nWhen I plug/unplug ac adapter, upower doesn't report that it's state\n  changed, kde's power manager doesn't switch profiles. If I start with\n  ac adapter plugged in and then unplug it, battery indicator shows that\n  battery is discharging, but ac adapter is plugged in. Battery state is\n  reported correctly. This problem exists in every linux distribution I\n  tried for every kernel version from 2.6 to 3.4. Also it seems that\n  this bug affects many people (open bugs in kde, upower bugtrackers).\nI found a workaround and I think I must share it. I rebuilt kernel\n  with ACPI_PROCFS_POWER=y (\"Deprecated power /proc/acpi directories\")\n  and noticed that if I do \"cat /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/AC/state\" then\n  state of the adapter becomes correct in kde, upower's output, etc.\nI added a file to /etc/acpi/events/ with following contents:\n  event=battery \n  action=cat /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/AC/state > /dev/null\nAfter restarting acpid everything works. The only problem is that\n  ACPI_PROCFS_POWER is deprecated. I hope this bug will be fixed before\n  the option will be removed.\n\nThe problem is that I'm a newbie with Ubuntu, and I don't really understand the concept of \"rebuild kernel\" posted above. So I'll leave this here and wait for some advanced user to enlighten us.\n\nA: alexio's information gave me enough information to figure out what to search for. This appears to be a kernel problem and I've found some similar bugs reported here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upower/+bug/467825\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-power-manager/+bug/733866\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpi/+bug/878776\nThe closest bug I can find upstream is this one:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=611555\nThe only work around I can think of is check your battery statistics directly from the system instead of via the indicator like outlined in this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to check battery status using terminal?\nAnd then subscribe to the bug closest to your problem to follow along:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I subscribe to a bug?\n\nA: First is needed to know if this is a hardware issue or the battery applet icon. I would recommend for you to try Jupiter, and see if the problem remains:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install jupiter\n\n\nA: I installed Jupiter and it still was like this. Then I clicked the battery icon on the top and changed the \"Show battery status in the menu bar\" setting to \"When charging/in use\", and it fixed itself.\n\nA: I have a Lenovo G570 and had the same problem. \nTry this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start your Ubuntu plugged to adapter.\n\n*Remove the adapter\n\n*Turn off your computer\n\n*Remove your battery\n\n*Hold the power key for 30 seconds.\n\n*Put the battery back.\n\n\nThe problem should be resolved.\n", "Q: Unity 3D vs Unity 2D vs Gnome shell for battery life (resource use) I'm currently trying to choose between Gnome shell and Unity 2D/3D for my Ubuntu installation on my laptop (I don't really like the dull look of some environments like xfce). Of the three, which uses the most resources (battery)? The least? I know that Unity will use more than its 2D counterpart, but I'm not sure how the both of them compare to Gnome shell.\n\nA: *\n\n*The 3D requirements of Unity (and Gnome 3, I would think), such as compositing, effects, etc. are minimal and cannot be compared to things like 3D gaming or 3D modeling.\n\n*If you are using a integrated graphics adapter that supports Unity 3D, such are the Intel HD series, there will be negligible effect on your battery life if you use it. This is because the integrated GPU always idles at a minimum clock speed, and that clock speed is only raised (consuming a non-negligible amount of power) if it is loaded beyond a certain degree -- I seriously doubt Unity/Gnome effects would do that.\n\n*If you are using a discrete adapter with hybrid/switchable graphics, then more battery life is going to be used regardless of your DE unless you use something like bumblebee or vgaswitcheroo.\n\n*This reasoning may not be true in Ubuntu 12.10 and later, if the rumored 3D software rendering for old graphics cards is introduced. In that scenario, the 3D DE may actually use more battery life because the CPU is performing everything in software.\n\nA: I've tested unity on 12.10 and compared it to gnome shell on an old asus eeepc 1000h and I was surprised. Unity could run 1 hour longer on the same battery than gnome shell but gnome shell felt much faster.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 on MacBook Air 2011 - problems with drivers I had just installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my MacBook Air, and have a lot of problems. I used this tutorial, after executing script and rebooting some problems were solved, but now I have completely not working touchpad, keyboard & screen backlight works incorrect (screen  brightness is not 100%, but it is 100% in settings, keyboard backlight turns on/off randomly). How to fix it?\nP. S. Script said that it's no such file or directory for some .icc file. Google says, that I should copy it from Mac OS X drive, but I completely replaced it with Ubuntu.\n\nA: It's more robust (and less likely to cause issues in the future) to use the latest stable Ubuntu version, which is 12.04 (11.10 causes so much problems for Macs...).  You should find your trackpad, keyboard, and backlight working properly.  \nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookAir4-2 \n", "Q: How to make docky and gnome shell work together?

I've been USB tethering with my Nexus S for over a year with no problems.  Went on vacation last week, came back, and discovered tethering no longer works.\nThe phone actually thinks its tethered just fine and shows the tethering icon in the top menu bar as normal.  But Ubuntu's connection icon in the top right sys tray just sits there spinning, unable to complete the connection.\nI also tried Wireless Hotspot and Bluetooth, but neither seems to work either (Hotspot has always worked in the past, never tried Bluetooth tethering till today).  Normal wireless routers (home, library, starbucks, etc.) still work fine, it's just connecting to my phone that appears broken.\nNo idea what's the problem, a recent update maybe?\n\nA: Update:  Also fixed in latest kernel upgrade (3.2.0-27-generic).\nThis appears to be a kernel regression from 3.2.0-25-generic to 3.2.0-26-generic.\n  Reverting to the older kernel solved it.

It wouldn't let me save from AwesomeWM so I opened up Unity and saved it from there and when I tried to log back into Awesome it just keeps throwing me back to the lightdm login screen.\nI have tried sudo apt-get remove awesomeand then reinstalling it. I have tried getting a working rc.lua from google and neither of these work.\nI don't really know what to do. It just keeps throwing me back to the login box, unity and 2d are both working fine. Very strange inded.\n\nA: When you tried editing rc.lua, were you trying to edit the system-wide one?  I'm guessing you didn't have proper permission to do so and then in Unity you used some GUI method that got around that.  That might have messed up the permissions on the config file so that you can't use it on login; either that, or there's a serious error in your config, although I've never had such a bad error it won't let me login.\nMake sure you copy the default system-wide rc.lua to ~/.config/awesome/:\ncp /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua ~/.config/awesome/\n\nThen edit the local copy.  By the way, just because you got someone's rc.lua doesn't mean it will work for you.  It depends how much they've customized it.  After modifying your rc.lua, you should always run awesome -k first, before restarting Awesome.  This will check for basic errors in your configuration, although it's not a perfect check.\n\nA: if \nawesome -k \n\nreports no errors, i'd try \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure --force lightdm awesome\n\n", "Q: Why do I get rsync error 20 when trying to customize Ubuntu? when trying to customize my ubuntu desktop live iso i'm coming across an rsync error in the first stages of the tutorial.\nwhen I execute: \nsudo rsync --exclude=/casper/filesystem.squashfs -a mnt/ extract-cd \nThe copy starts with no output.

My understandinf of this command is that it runs a script similar to what I was typing in by hand. This command also stops producing output and I exited it after 10 minutes(No error output was given).\n\nA: The error is simply caused by your pressing Ctrl+C to interrupt rsync.\nThe command should work; since it's not, please try running this and let us know what the output is:\nsudo rsync --exclude=/casper/filesystem.squashfs -a -nPh mnt/ extract-cd\nThe only difference is the additional -nPh option:\n- -n indicates a dry run, or a simulation; rsync will simulate what happens, including any errors, without actually copying any data.\n- -Ph shows the progress file-by-file in \"human\" readable (i.e. kilobytes, megabytes, etc.) form.\n\nPlease note: The Ubuntu customization wiki is terribly outdated.

Please see this answer of mine for a more-hands-on tutorial of using Ubuntu Builder to customize 12.04.\n\nA: I believe I found the problem, There is another problem on my computer causing very low write speeds to ntfs. Therefore When I tried to run rsync the copy simply would not complete in a feasible amount of time. \n\nA: After installed below packages, the problem solved.\nsudo apt-get install libgcrypt11\nsudo

That's the difference between installation and upgrade.

Launchpad lets you subscribe someone else to a bug report. Occasionally I find a bug closely related to one that Person X is already subscribed to. I therefore think X is likely to be interested in following the new bug, so it makes sense to notify him in this way. On the other hand, spamming X with extra e-mail can be considered poor etiquette.\nIs subscribing someone else acceptable? (And if not, then why does Launchpad permit it?) What about subscribing a team to a relevant bug?\n\nA: I think it's acceptable--even encouraged--and part of the Ubuntu/FOSS community spirit; it's allowed because we trust ourselves not to frivolously subscribe people to random bugs which may not interest them. The subscribee can always choose to unsubscribe, if necessary. Note that subscribing is restricted to Launchpad users, most of whom presumably have some tangential interest in the software development aspect of Launchpad.\n", "Q: Elan touchpad sluggish in Ubuntu 12.04I I checked the xorg.conf and it says \"synaptics\" as the device and driver name.

How do you make HDDs and partitions mount at startup on Ubuntu?\nI always keep my media and data files on separate partitions - one 2tb HDD and a 400 odd gig partition.  I have been trying to swap the default folder location for the home directory to my other drives.\nIt works when I change the /home/user_name/.config/user-dirs.dirs file to the directories I want, but only until I reboot the system. I am only assuming that the drives not mounting is the problem with it, but it would be helpful either way.  If any one knows another reason for why the directories change back to default each time that would be good also.\n\nA: use fstab\necho '/dev/[VolumeGroup]/[VolumeName] [custom-directory] ext4 defaults 0 2' >> /etc/fstab\n\nExample:\necho '/dev/hdd/hdd /mnt/hdd ext4 defaults 0 2' >> /etc/fstab\necho '/dev/ssd/ssd /mnt/ssd ext4 defaults 0 2' >> /etc/fstab\n\n\nA: All the answers use a GUI tool, or /etc/fstab. My problem with these is that I run headless servers (no GUI) and, most importantly, that I am usually mounting secondary USB hard-drives, where fstab will prevent your system from booting up if the drive is missing, damaged, etc. This has happened to me in the past, and it has left stranded otherwise perfectly functioning systems.\nMy solution is to use cron. In particular, add this line to your crontab -e with the specific info of your system.\n@reboot mount /dev/sdX /mnt/my-usb/\n\nWith this, cron will try and mount your drive upon every system start.\nWarning: this relies on /dev/sdX to remain unchanged through reboots, which is not guaranteed. In other words, the drive under /dev/sda might become /dev/sdb on the next boot. But in my non-professional setting, it's been working.\nIf you need more reliability, you can create a shell or python script to search for the right /dev/sdX based on the serial number, and then mount it, and execute the script with cron and the @reboot trigger.\n\nA: GUI Method (recommended for newbies) - The Disks program will automatically edit /etc/fstab for you and not break anything.

Please advise the best way to publish a Quickly-generated program to Windows.\n\nA: You will need a Windows pc to build it on. On this Windows pc you will want to install python, gtk, pygobject, pycairo, pygtk, py2exe, and SetupTools. Also you will need any other dependency/module your app might need but SetupTools should make that easier to pull off. Also you will need to remove anything in your application that would not be available to Windows. (i.e. Unity Bindings). Then you would run your app through Py2Exe and install it.

Simple fix:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen try your installations again.\n\n\n*Slightly more likely, Ubuntu has more specific versions of these packages available, but doesn't know to install them given the names you've typed out.  If you're willing to invest a few minutes, I would install Synaptic, a graphical package manager, with the following command:\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nSynaptic will allow you to search for packages by name, and allow you to select which version you'd like to install, if there are multiple available.  Launch Synaptic, allow it a moment to build its search index (the search bar in the program will tell that's what's going on), then try locating your packages one at a time. Once you've found a package you'd like, click on its checkbox, and select Mark for installation.\nSome packages you select will require that you install dependencies; that is fine.  You may even find that some of the packages you were trying to install on the command line get automatically selected for you, because one of the packages you've selected depends on it.\nIf you decide to go the synaptic route, start with the package apache2, because it will have many dependencies.\nOnce you've selected everything you'd like to install, click on the Apply button and let Synaptic do its thing.

The VM has guest additions installed.\nI'd like to be able to reliably use alt-tab to switch windows within the guest, at least when I am in full-screen mode. Instead what I currently get is that sometimes it switches windows in the guest, sometimes it switches windows in the host system, sometimes it activates the HUD in the host and sometimes it does more than one of these three things at the same time. \nWhat can I do so that when I am working on the guest only the guest responds to alt-tab? (I have a similar problem with the super key--though that isn't as much of an issue since 10.04 doesn't make as much use of it.)\n\nA: Using right Ctrl you can move between real OS and Virtual for the shortcuts. So every time you hit that button, you change between VM and the real machine and there is where the shortcut will apply.\nThe default desktop that a shortcut applies when you open a VM in full screen is a little bit random. Sometimes inside the VM, sometimes on the real desktop.\n\nA: You may also want to completely disable the HUD hotkey. I do this because I spent most of my time inside VMs and not on the host desktop.\nHow do I modify or disable the HUD's use of the Alt key?\n\nA: I also have met such problem, but I find that I use Left Alt as the host key, and then I change the host key to Right Alt (using VBox settings), and press Left Alt and Tab, it makes difference.\n\nA: Quick solution, Super + Alt + Tab does the trick if you face the issue.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 on Dell Latitude D610 along with Windows 7 I have a Dell latitude D610 laptop with faulty screen so I use it as a desktop with its original dock.

I would like to create a similar backup routine with Google Cloud Storage. Is it possible to get duplicity to work with GCS? \n\nA: There is now (since 2013-07-19 - version 0.6.22) support to use Google Cloud Storage directly in duplicity.\nYou should use gsutil config -a to create a ~/.boto config file. And then you can use duplicity like this:\nduplicity local_dir gs://yourbucket\n\nAlso of note is that only the old authentication mechanism is supported. You should enable \"Interoperable Access\" from your Google Storage Console.\nDetailed steps on http://www.willdurness.com/back-up-your-vm-to-google-cloud-storage-using-duplicity.\n\nA: *\n\n*As of August 2012, Duplicity does not support Google Cloud Storage (GCS); a search of the duplicity-talk mailing list archives shows that there has been no discussion, even at a wishlist stage, of adding such support.\n\n*\n\n*Google Docs is supported, but that API is totally different from GCS.\n\n*Wishlist bug filed recently\n\n\n*While the Python boto module used as a back-end by Duplicity to provide S3 support also supports GCS, adding GCS support to duplicity would require non-trivial modifications to its code; the S3 and GCS APIs are not identical.\n\n*\n\n*If anyone wants to give adding GCS support a go, it would be simplest to start with and modify the _boto_single.py file which provides the backend for single-threaded S3 transactions.\n\n\n*That GCS isn't widely supported shouldn't come as a surprise. It is nowhere near as universal as S3; for example, you must register as a developer with Google and the service is still considered part of the \"beta\" Google Labs.\n\n*\n\n*The only backup solution I could find supporting GCS is Zmanda (commercial).\n\n*As Google rolls out GCS on a wider basis--beyond just developers--I think we should start seeing support for it in FOSS apps.\n\n\n*For now, to use Duplicity with GCS, you must either backup to S3 and then use Google's gsutil tool to sync S3 with GCS, as Jorge's answer indicates; alternately, you could use Duplicity to backup locally and then sync that with GCS using gsutil.\n\n\nA: This is a partial-answer that might help the next person:\nSo far it seems that copying things to Google Drive/Docs is supported:\nduplicity localdir gdocs://username:password@gmail.com/remotedir/\n\nHowever this is different from Google Cloud Storage. I think this should be doable since duplicity and gsutil both use boto, but I'm not sure if this requires work to be done in duplicity itself though.\nAs a work around until you sort this, you can certainly copy directly from the s3 to the GCS buckets:\ngsutil -m cp -R s3://yourbucket gs://yourbucket\n\n\nA: Version v0.6.22 (2013/08/22) of Duplicity added Google Cloud Storage support.\n\nA: deja-dup 34.1 (duplicity's GUI) now has \"experimental support for Google Cloud Storage\" (https://launchpad.net/deja-dup/+milestone/34.1)\n(I tried enabling interoperability for HMAC authentication on my GCS buckets and specifying an S3 Bucket in earlier versions of Deja-Dup - similar to how duplicity does it - but to no avail)\n", "Q: installing after windows 7 I currently have windows 7 installed on my laptop which is very capable of supporting ubuntu and windows 7 with respect to hardware.

In fact, you can install and use multiple versions of Java, from multiple vendors, at the same time!\n\n*The reasons some don't recommend Java 7 as a replacement for Java 6 yet, for end-users, include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Java 7 is still relatively new and \"maturing\"\n\n*Most of the Java apps/code out there was written for Java 6 and works perfectly with it\n\n*Java 7 should be able to run the above too, but rarely there's a bug and it fails or causes problems.\n\n\n*As this link from May 2012 explains, while Java 7 has been available for developers since mid-2011, Oracle only started upgrading Windows users to Java 7 in May 2012, and it is still offering and recommending Java 6 to Linux and Mac users.\n\n*Bottom-line: if you are a developer, get Java 7.

The solution that I found yesterday is to disable kernel mode setting feature by adding an kernel command line option nomodeset. You can temporarily edit the command line in grub boot menu and if it works, you're going to make it permanent by editing grub configuration.\n\nA: Finally a patch to fix this issue has been committed and the updated package (xserver) is now downloadable through package manager! I myself also confirmed this and it just works without the workaround of \"nomodeset\".\n\nA: if you can login :\nFirstly, Open terminal and type: \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\n\n*Followed by sudo apt-get update\n\n*And sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel\nThis will install INTEL latest drivers.

To see the File Browser go to Tools > Plugins and enable tick/check the File Browser plugin.\nEdit:\nThe Filename field creates the Geany project file (ProjectName.geany). The Base Path is used to run the Build menu commands (for compiling etc).\nIt is recommended to keep all of your files in the same directory created in the Filename field.\n\nA: Check out the plugin \"Project organizer\". It's available together with a bunch of other plugins for Geany, get it by apt-get install geany-plugins.\nWith Project Organizer project creation works intuitive, you get a tree-view and code auto-completion reads every file in the project (not just the currently opened ones like it would otherwise).\n\nA: From the Terminal go to the directory you'd like to open, Type: \nfind . -name '*' -type f -exec geany  '{}' +\n\n", "Q: Headphones don't work on Asus K55V I have an Asus K55V.

I don't know if I really need wine applications to installed. That's why I need some suggestions from the experts whether to download it or not. I have Ubuntu 12.04 alongside of Windows 7.\n\nA: It depends on what applications you want to use. Wine is sort of a 'layer' that enables you to run some Microsoft Windows applications on Ubuntu. For a lot of Windows applications, there are native alternatives available in the Ubuntu Software Center. For example, Rhythmbox and Banshee are great native alternatives for iTunes. Gimp is a good alternative for Photoshop.\nMy advice is to only install Wine if you want to run the Windows applications instead of the native alternatives. The native applications are usually better integrated in Ubuntu.\n\nA: I personally have no need for it and haven't used a Windows app since 2008.\nIf you find that you have a need for a specific app while inside windows - then perhaps it is for you.\nI would say that if you find you're using (or need) a lot of windows apps then you will be better off either finding and working with a linux alternative, a dual-boot and booting that when you need to work in Windows apps.\nThere is always the alternative in using a virtual machine inside of Ubuntu.\nNot all windows apps will work with wine - always good to check at the wine app database - http://appdb.winehq.org/\n\nA: I need to run the Word, e-sword. Some need MS Office and don't want windows. Some Want their games but wants freedom of Linux. Suppose there is no wine....then what? \nAll these precious people will miss freedom and hence become forced to do dual boot.\nIf you do not need it today it doe not mean you won't need it.

YMMV :)\n\nA: Type ls -l in one of the padlocked directories to find out the permissions. You should be able to change them with chmod and chown (using sudo if not owned by your user) if they are wrong.\nFor example, if a file that should be writable says:\n-r--r--r-- 1 user user  4160 Jul 18 15:44 file.ext\n\nYou can give yourself write permissions using chmod ug+w file.ext.\nIf a file that belongs to you says:\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 root user  4160 Jul 18 15:44 file.ext\n\nYou can take control of it using sudo chown user file.ext.\nSimilarly chgrp to change the group (the second 'user' above) if that is wrong.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu work if I remove Windows? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDoes Ubuntu rely on Windows if I install it using the Windows installer? \n\nI am planning to install Ubuntu 12.04 using Wubi in Windows7. If in future I want to remove Windows(and then reinstall) will I be able to keep Ubuntu?\nAssume that I have installed Ubuntu in a separate partition.\n\nA: Assuming that you mean installing ubuntu using wubi and place ubuntu folder in another drive\nIf you simply remove windows partition installed ubuntu will die because it is installed as a windows program ,\nstill you have to possibilities\n1 . Migrate wubi to real installation before removing windows\n2 . Backup ubuntu folder , and then install wubi in freshly installed  windows, replace the ubuntu folder with backuped ubuntu folder\nBut both of the above methods are not fool proof , So you should seriously consider installing ubuntu in separate partion instead of using wubi\n\nA: No point installing Ubuntu using wubi. You get no hibernation, a slower data read/write rate and a multitude of problems. Also, if you install using wubi, you won't be able to acheive what you want (remove Windows). Rather just dual boot.\nAssuming Ubuntu NOT installed using wubi -\nThen if you want to keep Ubuntu, just format the Windows partition, boot into Ubuntu and execute the following command in the terminal - sudo update-grub\nAssuming you want to keep Windows, boot into Windows, install EasyBCD, click on Deployment and select 'Write Windows 7 loader to MBR'. Then format the Ubuntu partition.\n\nA: No because installing through Wubi creates Registry Entry in Windows .\nReinstalling Windows will would not show you Wubi installed Ubuntu any longer , since the registry value is deleted, also the boot menu will be re-constructed showing only windows . Even if you consider keeping wubi as it is after fresh Ws install , still it would lead to more complications, might not detect it.\nBetter option is Reinstalling Ubuntu through Wubi after Fresh windows installation. ( Dual-boot would be recommended anytime)\nAlso refer Wubi guide for more clarification.\n\nA: You will want to migrate the installation and then do whatever (delete) to the Windows installation. Take a look at the this section linked to from the Wubi guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MigrateWubi\n\nA: Yes, if you install Ubuntu to a seperate partitions then you can safely uninstall Windows.  However, you should anticipate the chance of having difficulties with the bootloader.\nWhen you uninstall Windows you may need to boot into rescue mode to reinstall the grub bootloader.  Also, when reinstalling Windows the Windows bootloader will overwrite grub--again requiring you to boot to rescue mode and reinstall grub.\n", "Q: How to change de \"Minimize all windows\" shortcut in Xubuntu? i have xubuntu on my pc, and i want to minimize all the windows when i press Super+D.\nDo yo know how can i do this?

I have Asus Zenbook UX32VD, I separated the SSD and HDD, left Windows 7 on the HDD and Installed Ubuntu (12.04 x86-64) from a Pendrive.\nAfter the installation (and also using the Live USB) screen would hardly ever work (backlight would), so I had to close and open the screen 4 or 5 times until it stayed on.\nTo solve this I followed these instructions, which say that you have to change quiet splash to nomodeset in the grub file. This works, except that the laptop now can't resume from suspend/standby.\nI used  these instructions to change the grub file, these instructions, unlike the previous say that you have to add nomodeset to quiet splash, I tried both and they both give the same results.\nI also tried installing the NVIDIA drivers (x86-64 which should work for GT 620 M) but this didn't help and made the system give all kinds or errors.\nAny suggestions?\nEDIT: Thank you for the answer, by not resuming I mean nothing, no fan, no backlight, no keyboard backlight. I'll look at your suggestions now.\nEDIT2: I found that the problem did not occur when using Ubuntu 12.10 (kernel 3.5)\n\nA: You did not describe closer what \"not resuming\" means (no reaction at all / screen stays blank / ...) -- but the ArchLinux Wiki writes on the ASUS Zenbook UX31E for having the same problems:\n\nThe USB modules must be unloaded or the laptop will not come out of sleep mode.

Please read the original Wiki page for full details. Also refer to this question, which also mentions some SUSPEND_MODULES issue.\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu 12.10 solved the problem for me. I guess this is due to kernel 3.5, so perhaps you could also just update this.\nEDIT: I wrote this above when I was using the Alpha version which ran on 3.5.0-4-generic. As soon as I upgraded to the beta 1 the problem returned.

I have a root account from which I do all of my tasks.  I set up my partitions to mount at startup.  I have also created an account for my younger brother.  I do not want him to access specific partitions, while still having access to others.\nI have:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda5\n\n*sda6\n\n*sda7\n\n\nI want to block access to sda5 but want to give him permission to access the other sda partitions. How can I do that?\n\nA: Thanks for the help guys. Both the answers helped me find out what I need to do. Here's what I have done.\nMy other sda are ntfs file system so I cannot directly change permission. So I have to mount it in a folder to which only I have access.\nI make a folder in /media named secret with terminal\ncd /media\nsudo mkdir -p secret\n\nThen I change ownership of this folder with chown command.\nsudo chown XXXX:XXXX /media/secret\n\nWhere XXXX in my user name. Then I changed permission to that folder so that only I can access.\nsudo chmod 700 /media/secret\n\nThen I had to edit /etc/fstab for appropriate mounting point of sda5.\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nThen add \n/dev/sda5        /media/secret  ntfs defaults           0  0\n\nat the end and saved it. Then reboot.\nViola! It worked.\n\nA: Assuming your friend's name is Alice and she already has an account on your system, you can set up your drives such that they are automatically mounted with your ideal configuration.  This is done by editing /etc/fstab.\nnon-ext4\nThe permissions for the drive may be determined completely within /etc/fstab for most filesystems.\nAdd the following to your /etc/fstab\n/dev/sda5 /mnt/Secret ext3 defaults 0 0\n/dev/sda6 /mnt/Shared ext3 defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0\n\nYou can determine a user or group's ID by looking at /etc/passwd or /etc/group.\next4\next4 does not allow uid/gid options.  You will set the permission by changing the mount directories' rights.\nAdd the following to your /etc/fstab\n/dev/sda5 /mnt/Secret ext4 defaults 0 0\n/dev/sda6 /mnt/Shared ext4 defaults 0 0\n\nAssign the permissions\nchown root:root /mnt/Secret\nchmod 770 /mnt/Secret\nchown alice:alice /mnt/Shared\nchmod 777 /mnt/Shared\n\nYou could also create a group of users, such as shared, and only give that group permissions for the drive.\n\nA: If it has the right filesystem, you can change the permissions of the folder where it is mounted. For example, if it is mounted as /media/sda5, you need to type the following at the terminal (Ctrl+T).\nsudo chown your_username:your_username /media/sda5\nsudo chmod 700 /media/sda5\n\nThis will allow only the user specified by your_username, as well as the root user, to access the files. This will not work for some filesystems, such as NTFS. In that case, you will need to change the permissions of the parent directory. For example, if you have mounted it as /media/private/sda5, you will need to apply the operations to the /media/private directory. This will restrict access.\n\nA: My solution will be simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the /etc/fstab file with root permission.\n\n*Add this line and save and close the file.\n/dev/sda5 /media/secret ntfs defaults 0 0\n\n\n*Then anytime he wants to mount it, it will ask for password, which only you know. So, safe and easy. You can mount it easily with terminal  \nsudo mount /dev/sda5\n\nFor the other partitions, both user can mount them via nautilus easily. or as you said, You have a setting to mount them automatically. That's it.  Only the setting for /dev/sda5 need to be changed.\nIt's easy, isn't it?\n\nAs a comment from Eliah Kagan suggests that, the non-root users can still mount it. IMHO it is actually no. Even admin users can't mount  the partitions without giving explicitly their password in terminal.\nI tested this:\nI have an ntfs partition which is /dev/sda3. I created an entry in /etc/fstab like this one:\n /dev/sda3   /media/works  ntfs   defaults  0   0\n\nThe result is, when I tried to execute it via nautilus, this error message is displayed.\n \nWhen I tried to mount it via terminal with udisks --mount /dev/sda3 , this error message is displayed\nMount failed: Error mounting: mount exited with exit code 1: helper failed with:\nmount: only root can mount /dev/sda3 on /media/works\n\nSo, It actually prevents non-root users, even the root users. They can only mount it via mount command and giving the password as below:\n sudo mount /dev/sda3\n\n"]
