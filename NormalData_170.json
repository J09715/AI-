["Q: Cannot Install Ubuntu - no option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows I want to install Ubuntu 13.10 alongside my Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 operating systems.\nWhen I boot up from the live CD, it doesn't give me an option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows.\nI tried clicking on something else too -- it just showed my whole disk as one unallocated partition.\nI don't think I have 4 primary partitions either. I once converted them to logical partitions too!\nCan someone help me to install Ubuntu?\nI have a 1TB hard disk and I have only used around 200 GB for both of the operating systems! I have lots of space left. What do I do now?\n\n\nA: Your problem is almost certainly caused by leftover GPT data on an MBR disk. You can correct this problem by running FixParts (part of the Ubuntu gdisk package) on the disk. Once you've done that, you should be able to resize partitions to make it all work.\nAlso, be sure to disable the Windows 8 Fast Startup feature. This feature is incompatible with a dual- (much less a triple-)boot configuration.\n", "Q: Unable to locate package conky-manager I want to install conky manager,I use 3 command to install it,\nsudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:teejee2008/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install conky-manager\n\nfor the first command, ouput is:\ngpg: keyring `/tmp/tmpfvhu7b/secring.gpg' created\ngpg: keyring `/tmp/tmpfvhu7b/pubring.gpg' created\ngpg: requesting key 2D0F61F0 from hkp server keyserver.ubuntu.com\ngpg: /tmp/tmpfvhu7b/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created\ngpg: key 2D0F61F0: public key \"Launchpad PPA for Tony George\" imported\ngpg: Total number processed: 1\ngpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)\nOK\n\nand for the second command, output is:\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/teejee2008/ppa/ubuntu/dists/nadia/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/teejee2008/ppa/ubuntu/dists/nadia/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/teejee2008/ppa/ubuntu/dists/nadia/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

I had this multiple times, the thing is you have added a source (ppa) to your system where you withdraw/fetch updates that has packages of the same one as already one in the system and it's trusted (official). For example happened to me linux-headers 3.x.x.9 installed but linux-headers 3.x.x.8 is to be installed, because source you added has newer kernel recommended for your system than your official source. So that's why it happens and the solution is to remove or disable conflicting ppa in /etc/apt/sources.list and you'll get pass through it in no time :-)\nHow to find conflicting ppa you need to list its packages to see what packages it contains, I use y-ppa-manager by webupd8 for this things, you can do it your own way.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install y-ppa-manager\n\nThe other solution happened to be solved to avoid the conflict is to remove (untick) the main ubuntu repo in /etc/apt/sources.list for example us.ubuntu.archive saucy main restricted (or whatever distributive you have) then do aptitude update and aptitude install then move (tick) the main repo back in and disable the software repository in the sources.list repository.\nAlso others who be interested you may follow this thread\n", "Q: Cannot change UI language in firefox I got installed Ubuntu with preinstalled Firefox.

I've got files I need to recover from it. I have the ubuntu64.vdi file on my Windows 7 (host) laptop and I was wondering if there is any way of recovering the files from the vdi file.\nIn parallel, I generated a fresh 12.04.1 machine on virtualbox in the same laptop, and I'll use that one instead of the borked one.\nI can add the borked vdi to the list of disks in the working one. Then I used gnome nautilus to mount the borked disk.\nI can find the files in there, but they are about 2 months old. I think this coincides with the last time that I did a virtualbox snapshot of the machine, but not the last time I got a working machine, which was yesterday. Is there any way of mounting the vdi as of yesterday, just before it crashed?\nEDITED:\nHere is what Virtual Media Manager tells me about my ubuntu64.vdi file:\n\nEDITED2:\nI copied my ubuntu.vdi to an external USB with plenty of disk space. I tried using Windows to clone it, but got an error:\n\nI tried the same from the working VM via a shared folder of the USB drive, and it started the cloning. Took a good while, but finished successfully:\nroot@precise64:/media/sf_E_DRIVE/copy_of_ubuntu64_vm_folder_20140224/ubuntu64# \nVBoxManage clonehd ubuntu64.vdi ubuntu64.raw --format RAW\n0%...\n\n10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...60%...70%...80%...90%...100%\nClone hard disk created in format 'RAW'.

Any ideas?\n\nA: 1) Try to recover the snapshot by the UUID, use following hack: \n\n\n*\n\n*choose UUID of the state you want to recover.\n\n*Open file .xml, preferably in a tool (Internet Explorer works) that allows easy navigation of the XML file.\n\n*At the VERY BOTTOM, in the Storage Controllers section, find the UUID of the Current State and note the StorageController name=, type= and the AttachedDevice type=, port= and device= settings.\n\n*In the middle, find the snapshot you want.\n\n*In the Storage Controller section of the snapshot, find the AttachedDevice with the values (name/type/type/port/device) that matches the values retrieved above.\n\n*That image UUID identifies the Snapshot image for the hard disk. Remove the {} brackets, and\n\n\nenter the command C:> VBoxManage clonehd <UUID> CloneDisk.vdi\nHope it helps, i did found the solution here: (https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=791)\n2) if the steps in 1) does not work, heres another steps you can try. How to clonehd the Current State of a disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Virtual Media Manager (Menu: File>Virtual Media Manager).\n\n*Navigate to the hard disk you want to clone and fully expand the tree (use * key on numeric keypad).\n\n*Find the {hexUUID}.vdi file that is attached to the VM you want to clone the Current State of. It will be (one of) the leaf files at the end of a branch. When you select it, the ‘Attached to:’ text at the bottom of the window will say: 'Attached to: ', without any (snapshot name) in brackets after it.\n\n*Click the filename to the right of the 'Location:' displayed at the bottom of the window.\n\n*Ctrl+C / Copy to copy the text to the clipboard, which will be something like: (path){b6441469-5ccb-418c-8fdd-73c5e1a17314}.vdi\n\n*Ctrl+V / Paste and extract the hexUUID value (removing the {} brackets) and run clonehd to clone it!\n\n\nThi solution is from here: (http://www.i-m-code.com/blog/blog/2012/02/04/virtualbox-clone-snapshots/) Both speaks mostly about the same.\n\nA: Of the command line\nIn case we use Ubuntu as a host we can convert our .vdi disk to a raw disk with the following command:\nVBoxManage clonehd <sourcename> <clone.raw> --format RAW\n\nWe can then open testdisk  with this file to recover files on the virtual drive's image (also see below):\ntestdisk <clone.raw>\n\nOf a virtual machine\nIn case the broken VDI drive image is still registered with Virtual Box we may be able to add this image as a drive to our new virtual machine:\n\nStart your virtual Ubuntu to which we had added the broken .vdi but do not mount the drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory on a mounted partition there to hold the harvested data (e.g. ~/rescued),\n\n*Install testdisk  on the virtual machine.\n\n*Start testdisk from a terminal there:\nsudo testdisk\n\n\n*Choose the appropriate drive to harvest data from (here shown for /sdb) and select [Proceed]\n\n\n*Choose the appropriate partition layout (usually Intel)\n\n*Select [Analyse] - [Quick Search]\n\n*Select the partition which contains the data to harvest (here only a single NTFS partition was present):\n\n\n*Press  P  to list files on that partiton.\n\n*Browse to the directory containing the data. View the filenames to make sure you did choose the right ones.\n\n*Select directories or files to harvest using  : . All selected files/directories will be marked green:\n\n\n*Press upper case  C  to copy all selected directories/files to the rescue directory which will be selected in the next step.\n\n*Choose a directory on your Ubuntu VM's mounted partition(s) to hold rescued data:\n\n\n*Press  c  to start copying the data from the broken .vdi to our rescue directory in your healthy VM.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*In case we can not see our files with the [Quick Search] option in 6. we may have to perform a [Deeper Search]. This will also list previous deleted and overwritten partitions. So we need to make sure we select the appropriate partitions where our data reside.\n\n*If we had taken snapshots of the .vdi we may find these in ~/.VirtualBox/Machines/<Name of Machine>/Snapshots/{###}.vmdkbut whenever we had used the snapshot feature of Virtual Box any changes from a snapshot will be written to a differential file.  \nTo merge the differential file with the hard drive we need to delete all snapshots (which is probably not what we want as then we could just restore to previous snapshot rather than call for data recovery), or we need to clone the machine's drive using:\nVBoxManage clonehd <name_of_source> <clone>\n\nThen we bind the clone to our rescue VM as depicted above.\n\n*Writing to the broken .vdi should only be done after the data was safe as this may further damage the file system.\n\n*In case our rescue Ubuntu is too small to hold the rescued data we may create another new virtual drive to bind to the VM. This drive then has to be mounted in the VM to be able to save data from testdisk there.\n\nA: Found my corrupt vdi file to be recoverable using 7-Zip , hope this simple method too helps someone.\n\nA: I had a Linux system get corrupted at / and fsck could not fix it. I used the following simple approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a new replacement VDI to the machine.\n\n*Download a new linux ISO.\n\n*Boot and install a new linux on the disk you added in (1).\n\n*Mount the disk on your new system and copy the files you need. Usually, this means copying the /home/user/ folder. Remember to copy the hidden files (settings files).\n\n\nWorked well for me. The disk corruption was only hindering boot, there was no data loss in my home folder.\n\nA: Launch the old virtual machine after inserting an Ubuntu ISO. Ubuntu will analyze the machine. Choose \"Try ubuntu\" (obviously don't install anything and don't erase any data). Once it's booted up (and it will because it's using the ubuntu iso not your old broken install), in the browser (Nautilus) choose \"Other locations\" to navigate to your old data and move them to somewhere safe.\nI did not try to fix the machine, but I was only interested in recovering data and move them to the new virtual machine. It's probably possible to do what the top answer is suggesting directly from the live-booted old machine that way.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Installation of 64-bit on 32-bit OS I have confusion of installing Ubuntu 12.04!. Actually my system is 32-bit with 4GB RAM. In the official page of Ubuntu its given as 32-bit(for machine less than than 2GB RAM). Can anyone please help me,\nThank  & Regards\nSuhas\n\nA: Whether you should run 32bit OS or 64bit OS mainly depends on your processor rather than on your RAM!\nIf your processor is capable of running 64bit OS (almost all latest processors are capable of running 64bit OS) Then you should install 64bit OS. If is not the case then you should install 32bit OS.\nTalking about RAM:\nIf you install a 32bit OS then the Maximum RAM supported by your system will be 4GB.\nIf you install a 64bit OS then you can install more than 1TB of RAM!\nhave a look at this\n\nA: No. To start with, you'll lack the ability to boot or execute any of the 64-bit files. For all intents and purposes, it is essentially impossible to execute a 64-bit instruction on 32-bit hardware, and while 64-bit Ubuntu may have some 32-bit files, the main parts are 64-bit, so it won’t even boot.\nEdit:\nWhy does Ubuntu recommend 2/4GB RAM on 32 bit machines:\n32-bit => 2^32 addressable locations = 4 GB\n64-bit => 2^64 addressable location = 17179869184 GB\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: .htaccess Apache Mode Rewrite not Working New to Ubuntu and trying to set-up PHP environment.

Maybe you can recover some of the data from this really old disk that nobody knows who last used?\" (OK, that's not really what he said, but that's just about as much information I have at hand at the moment...)\nI plugged in the disk in my computer, and discovered it was RAID1-configured. I've never worked with RAID-configurations before. After some googling and trying to figure out what to do to be able to read this disk, I've gathered the following information: http://pastebin.com/KZHAj7U9\nWhat might be most interesting is the following excerpt:\ntlycken@hoth ~ $ sudo mdadm -E /dev/sdb2\n... \n      Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\nthis     0       8       18        0      active sync   /dev/sdb2\n \n   0     0       8       18        0      active sync   /dev/sdb2\n   1     1       0        0        1      faulty removed\n\nThere are two other partitions (sdb3 and sdb5) that report similar tables, but they both report \"active sync\" for the state on all three rows. So this partition seems to be the troublesome one.\nIf I open the Disk Utility GUI, I see the following, after trying to start the RAID array:\n\nWhen I pressed the little play button at the top right (which is a stop button in this screenshot) I get the following error message:\n\nError starting RAID array\nError starting RAID array: Command-line `mdadm --assemble  --scan --uuid \"866221ac:fd8d56af:aceaa1c2:25d2b442\"' exited with non-zero exit status 2: mdadm: /dev/md2 has been started with 1 drive (out of 2).\n(udisks-error-quark, 0)\n\nAll I can understand from this is that it seems that part of the RAID array is missing - however, I have no idea if the missing part is some partition on the disk I have in front of me (i.e. something I could probably configure to make it work) or on another physical disk (which I have little or no hope of being able to get my hands on).\nHow do I configure and mount this array so that i can read the data (read-only is fine)?\n\nA: First things first: I would recommend making a bit copy of the disk, e.g. using ddrescue, and then working on the disk image, not on the physical disk. This might save you some headache if the disk suddenly dies on you - if it hasn't been used for a while, I would consider its fitness questionable at best.\nThat said, RAID 1 is a mirroring scheme - in other words, all the disks contain all the data; thus it is possible to recover data even if only a single functional disk is present.\nWhat you see here is mdadm complaining that the array is supposed to contain 2 disks, therefore it marks the array degraded (there's something wrong with it, namely, only 1 disk is present out of 2). However, since the available disk seems to contain good data (it says sync, meaning \"this disk is synced correctly to the current state of the array\") you can still assemble it in degraded mode by adding the --force parameter:\nmdadm --assemble --scan --uuid \"866221ac:fd8d56af:aceaa1c2:25d2b442\" --force\n\nThis should assemble the array even with a single disk; then you can mount the array normally, and access the data as you usually would.\n", "Q: Data extraction from a text file using bash I am looking for a bash script.

What is the difference between sudo, kdesudo and gksudo, and when should I use each?

That means it provide privileges of the root/main user via terminal. Learn more about sudo from its official site.\nFrom Vinicius's comment \n\nIt originally stood for 'superuser do' as the older versions of sudo\n  were designed to run commands only as the superuser. However, the\n  later versions added support for running commands not only as the\n  superuser but also as other (restricted) users, and thus it is also\n  commonly expanded as 'substitute user do'. Although the latter case\n  reflects its current functionality more accurately, sudo is still\n  often called 'superuser do' since it is so often used for\n  administrative tasks.\n\ngksudo and kdesudo both are also sudo thing except that first one is use for graphical sudo operation which works using GUI instead of terminal and second one is gksudo alternative for Kubuntu.\nAnd a short note from wiki\n\nYou should never use normal sudo to start graphical applications as\n  Root.You should use gksudo (kdesudo on Kubuntu) to run such programs.\n  gksudo sets HOME=~root, and copies .Xauthority to a tmp directory.\n  This prevents files in your home directory becoming owned by Root.\n  (AFAICT, this is all that's special about the environment of the\n  started process with gksudo vs. sudo).\n\n", "Q: How do I resolve desktop larger than screen?

Not the Ubuntu settings, the actual built-in settings for the display that you access by pressing the physical buttons on the display.\nFor me I had to change the aspect ratio settings from 16:9 to \"Just Scan\". Not sure what it means, but it did the job.\n\nA: Also had xrandr -q report larger resolution than my display could give:\n# xrandr -q\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1366 x 1024, maximum 8192 x 8192\nLVDS1 connected primary 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 344mm x 194mm\n   1366x768      60.00*+\n...\n\nThis command solved the problem:\nxrandr --size 1366x768\n\n\nA: In my case, it seemed somehow that panning got activated which I could disable with:\nxrandr --output HDMI-0 --panning 0x0+0+0\n\n\nA: well, in my case the settings on the TV did not allow to resolve the issue \nso i have resolved it with manipulation with xrandr \nxrandr --output HDMI-0 --set underscan auto\n\nin your case try with correct display DVI-I-1  instead of HDMI-0\nhope it helps\n\nA: I solved it within the menu accessibility configuration. There is an option to amplify the screen. I just disabled it and it was back to normal.\n\nA: You may have zoomed into the screen. Get to desktop, then ctrl + mouse wheel will zoom in and out to allow you to set desired size.\n\nA: Say your primary display has a resolution of 1920x1080 and the resolution on your external monitor, connected to HDMI-2, is larger:\nxrandr --output HDMI-2 --scale-from 1920x1080 --auto\n\nIf your primary display is eDP-1:\nxrandr --output HDMI-2 --scale-from 1920x1080 --auto --same-as eDP-1\n\n\nI understand this does not directly answer the question. I am putting this here to serve as a general solution to this outdated question.\n", "Q: how to limit resources to a shared ubuntu 10.04 The title might not be explanatory enough but I couldn't find any better way to formulate it. I will be running a server for office use. It will host applications on tomcat. 2 differents people would be deploying the application they are working on (office policy, all developers should be familiar with it). \nI know there is ACL module at HDD level but I think it would be an overkill to do that for this purpose. Beside its usage is not so clear to me as I would want to use it in a a way where I could list allowed actions like listed below , allowed for an user or group as opposed to listing the users/groups who are allowed for a particular resource/script etc.\nI would like to create a group which would be giving a particular set of privileges such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a folder in /opt/tomcat*/webapps * there could be different instances\n\n*start/stop/restart a particular tomcat servive example service tomcat-1 start \n\n*start/stop/reload/restart apache2 for reverse proxy purpose \n\n*edit /etc/apache2/sites-available for reverse    proxy purpose \n\n*activate/deactivate sites using a2ensite or a2dissite\n\n\nHow can I achieve that in Ubuntu? \nThanks in advance\nEDIT: \nThanks to bacon, I got some going. But I looks like there are few kinks. I created the users user1, user2, user3 and added them to the group deployers. All tomcat instances created with tomcat-user are inside /opt/tomcat7/ so I changed the user ownership of the folder to tomcat7 and the group owner ship to deployers and chmod to 775. I have made a copy of /etc/init.d/tomcat7 to suit each of my instances and added them to update-rc.d.\nwith visudo I have created DEPLOYERS Cmnd_Alias and configured it as shown below:\nCmnd_Alias    DEPLOYERS= /etc/init.d/tomcat_instance_1,/etc/init.d/tomcat_instance_2,/sbin/sh,/usr/bin/service\n%deployers    ALL=(ALL) DEPLOYERS\n\nI have logged in with user1 credentials and I still can't run /etc/init.d/tomcat_instance_1 start because it says \"You need root privileges ...\".\nI thought the Command Alias would take care of that. Can anyone shed the light thanks?\n\nA: This is a nice tutorial for adding users to a group If you give that groups rights to the folder than that should solve your first problem and your fourth problem.\nI would solve the rights for stating and stopping Apache and Tomcat by giving limited sudo rights for specific commands. This can be done using sudo visudo to edit the /etc/sudoers file.

There are several greeters available. \nBy default Ubuntu uses the unity-greeter. You can get its source code using\napt-get source unity-greeter\n\nor from https://code.launchpad.net/unity-greeter\nIf you have some web design skills it may worth to have a look at \"webkit-greeter\" (package lightdm-webkit-greeter).

How can I find a USB wireless card that I can be 100% sure will work with Ubuntu 12.04? Is there a list of known supported hardware?\n\nA: Panda makes very Linux  friendly USB dongles. Look them up on Amazon.\n\nA: I have experience with 2 USB wifi adapters.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a strong WiFi signal, Ralink/Mediatek RT5370 (N150) adapters seem to work well but signal strength doesn't indicate very strong. The best speed I've seen indicated is 72.5 mb./sec. Tenda W311Mi is one example.\n\n*If your wifi signal is weaker, I find RealTek RTL8192SU chip based adapters quite good and also plug -n- play in my experience.  I've had good luck with TrendNet TEW-649UB. This chip is supposed to support 300 down, 150 up. \nIf you go with the TEW-649UB adapter, you may have an issue with networking not starting after suspend. A one line file should solve the issue. From an account with SUDO authorization, type the following:\nsudo gedit /etc/pm/config.d/config\n\nA new empty file will be created.  type one line:\nSUSPEND_MODULES=\"R8712U\"\n\nSave and reboot.  That should fix any suspend/resume problem. My Trendnet devices tend to run a bit warm so suspect they use more battery power than the MediaTek/Ralink device is that matters to you.

When using juju to deploy a DB, how can I determine the available amount of disk space when using the DB charm? Suppose that I'm using EC2 (or anywhere else) to deploy a PostgreSQL/MySQL/WhateverDB charm... Where will the actual database data be stored? Will the charm create a EBS volume and attach it to the instance and put the data there? What if my database is very large? Or very small? Where can I determine the size of the available storage?\nThanks!!\n\nA: On ec2, every instance gets an 8G EBS volume by default; if you need more you can specify the root-disk constraint on the service. (Note that this will only apply to new units of the service, though.)\nYou can't generally control where the database you deploy keeps its data -- that's up to the charm author -- but it will generally be on that root disk ;). To determine the size of the disk, you should be able to check the hardware characteristics of the deployed machine in juju status; if that data is missing on any given provider, that's a bug and we would appreciate a report.\nWe will be working on more sophisticated storage management for juju sometime shortly after the release of 14.04.\n", "Q: What is the bootstrap.sh script?

With gpt it may be seen as LDM.\nYou need to undo the dynamic and just have NTFS partitions which will work with Windows and Linux. And with new 4K drives partitions need to be aligned or else you will have issues. But all the newer partition tools will create standard partitions with alignment.\nWindows nor Linux does not have tools to undo the dynamic but some third party Windows partitioning tools may undo it without having to totally erase drive. \nBest to check on a Windows forum for details.\nAnyone with a large drive can use gparted or gdisk (in repository) to correctly create partitions with alignment.\nAlignment 2048 sectors Advanced Format drives\nProper alignment of partitions on an Advanced Format HDD using Parted\n", "Q: Ethernet- Device not managed after changing static ip I have changed the ethernet static ip to the default wi-fi local ip.

To do a patch manually I must type this command \nsudo ./playback_delete_data_patch.sh 09_delete_old_data_p.sql  \n\nThere is a space just before the 09: \nsudo ./playback_delete_data_patch.sh [space] 09_delete_old_data_p.sql\n\nHow can I run this inside a script?\nThere are also several other commands but this one is giving trouble.\n\nA: You could possibly modify the sudoers file.\nRun sudo visudo.\nAdd an entry for your username and the script that you would like to run without being asked for a password.\nusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/script\n\n\nA: There is actually a much simpler way to do this. For portability, this is my implementation but feel free to manipulate it to suit your need.\nEnter your sudo password as a parameter when starting the script, capture it, and echo it with each command which will prompt for the sudo password.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nPW=$1\necho $PW | ./playback_delete_data_patch.sh 09_delete_old_data_p.sql  \n./command_wo_sudo.sh <param>\necho $PW | ./other_command_requires_sudo.sh <param>\n\nYou can add a prompt and capture after the script is kicked off like so:\necho \"enter the sudo password, please\"\nread PW\n\nBut if someone else monitors what's run on the node; has access to logs created by it; or is just looking over your should randomly when you run a test, that could compromise security.\nThis also works with running commands/scripts that require a yes to continue:\necho $PW | yes | ./install.sh\n\nThe echo is in response to a prompt, so you can use anything you need to, there, if you're running other scripts that have prompts for progress, in sequential order. Make sure you know that order, though, or bad things can happen.\n\nA: You could try something like: \necho \"PASSWORD\" | sudo -S ./playback_delete_data_patch.sh 09_delete_old_data_p.sql\n\nThis is not the most secure thing to do since you are writing a sudoer password in plain text. To make it a little more secure you can create a variable and read the sudo password into the variable and then you could execute the command as:\necho $PASSWORD | sudo -S ./playback_delete_data_patch.sh 09_delete_old_data_p.sql\n\nAlso, if you do not mind all your commands being executed as root you can simple execute your script using sudo, as previously suggested.\nsudo ./myscript\n\n\nA: This answer is similar to terdon's answer. I would also suggest running the main script with sudo so the script can run without having to ask for the user's password during its execution. \nHowever, in case you want to drop root privileges to some of the commands and run them as the actual user who invoked the command with sudo, you can check for the $SUDO_USER variable to figure out the original user.\nThis is an example script of how you could achieve that:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# ref: https://askubuntu.com/a/30157/8698\nif ! [ $(id -u) = 0 ]; then\n   echo \"The script need to be run as root.\" >&2\n   exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ $SUDO_USER ]; then\n    real_user=$SUDO_USER\nelse\n    real_user=$(whoami)\nfi\n\n# Commands that you don't want running as root would be invoked\n# with: sudo -u $real_user\n# So they will be run as the user who invoked the sudo command\n# Keep in mind if the user is using a root shell (they're logged in as root),\n# then $real_user is actually root\n# sudo -u $real_user non-root-command\n\n# Commands that need to be ran with root would be invoked without sudo\n# root-command\n\n\nA: #!/bin/bash\n# this declares that current user is a sudoer\nsudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/$USER <<END\nEND\n\n# write the content of your script here\nsudo npm install hexo-cli -g\nmkdir Untitled\nsudo apt-get install python\n\n# then to remove the sudo access from the current user\nsudo /bin/rm /etc/sudoers.d/$USER\nsudo -k\n\n\nA: It is rarely a good idea to have sudo inside scripts. Instead, remove the sudo from the script and run the script itself with sudo:\nsudo myscript.sh\n\nThat way, all commands within the script will be run with root privileges and you only need to give the password once when launching the script. If you need a particular command within the script to be run without sudo privileges, you can run it as a regular user with  (thanks Lie Ryan):\nsudo -u username command \n\nThe space is irrelevant, it should not affect anything, there is always a space between a command and its arguments.\n\nA: You could try to add the user who runs the script to the sudoers file:\n#give permissions to the file\nsudo chmod 700 /etc/sudoers.d/useradm\n\nsudo visudo /etc/sudoers.d/useradm\n\n#add the following text, changing \"user\" but your desired user\nuser ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWD:ALL\n\n#return the right permissions to the file\nsudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/useradm\n\n", "Q: how do I install 12.04 when I am using 13.8? how do I install 12.04 when I am using 13.8?

I'm looking at building a new home server and would like a flexible filesystem.  Both btrfs and zfs are interesting.  I want to be able to do soft raid and have flexible solution allowing me to expand storage easily as I add hard drives.  Not interested in hardware raid due to cost.  Since this is a non-essential server, I'm willing to play around and take some risks.  This media server will be available over the Internet for remote playback.  Most likely will run Plex Media Server software.  I'm thinking of running Ubuntu 12.04 since some of the software I want to use seems only supported on the LTS.\n\nA: Hardware RAID is much revered by some, but I think it's like dreaming of having an US army tank as your only vehicle. Sure it's safe, but it's huge, has prohibitive maintenance and fuel costs and actually becomes a trap when it lets you down in the middle of nowhere, with no standard repair service being able to help you.\nPlus hardware RAID has well-known flaws that full software-RAID solutions like BTRFS and ZFS avoid.\nFor the kind of use you're planning, there's no \"better\" software-RAID solution between ZFS and BTRFS, it's only a matter of choosing the one that suits you best :\n\n\n*\n\n*ZFS and BTRFS are both excellent software-RAID / Volume Manager integrated solutions\n\n*ZFS and BTRFS both feature copy-on-write, snapshots and blocks check-sum control\n\n*ZFS can handle much bigger filesystems, but BTRFS can handle way enough TB for any private storage box\n\n*communities are working on ZFS-ports for Linux, BSD and OS X, based on the last open sources that were available from Sun Microsystems' repository before closing (they don't have the very latest features implemented by Oracle, but it's a mature FS)\n\n*BTRFS is offered as an optional package in most Linux distributions as it's not considered stable yet, but continues to be developed at a fast pace\n\n*ZFS uses more RAM than BTRFS as previous poster mentioned it (4GB minimum, 8GB recommended, but the more the better)\n\n\nHope it helps.\n\nA: I am currently using btrfs, having used zfs in the past. zfs is quite memory hungry and isn't \"linux-native\", so if you're happy with a newer / less proven filesystem I recommend btrfs.\nIf you do go btrfs on Ubuntu LTS I recommend holding out for 14.04 since the recent kernels have a lot of btrfs updates.\nA more traditional system would involve LVM + md software raid, this is a tried and tested solution that can give you the expandable storage, software raid, snapshots, etc etc but is not as \"cool\" as the newer filesystems and misses some features (like checksumming / COW).\n", "Q: How to capture screen in Ubuntu 12.04 I'm new to Linux.

I am having trouble installing GRUB though.\nI first created two partitions on the SSD: main (111GB) and swap (9GB).\nThen, using Kubuntu boot USB (clean formatted with new iso and good md5sum), I tried to install on Manual to reduce the chance I'd screw up my Windows. I really really don't want to screw up my Windows. I set main (sdb1) as / and swap (sdb2) as swap, leaving all of sda as Do Not Use, and set it to install the bootloader to sda, which is where the Win7 MBR should be.\nHowever, after almost completing the install, it gives me a pop-up of:\n\nUnable to install GRUB in /dev/sda\nExecuting 'grub-install /dev/sda' failed.\nThis is a fatal error.\n\nGrub installs fine if my SSD is in sda, but then my windows doesn't work because my motherboard can only boot to \"Internal Notebook Drive\", also known as sda, and sda is always C, which windows needs to be in to work. So my SSD must be sdb.\nWhat reasons might cause this? Is my methodology sound, and how can I improve it? What other info would be helpful in diagnosing the problem?\n\nA: If your 1 TB drive is partitioned using GPT instead of an msdos partition table, then you need to create a 1 MiB bios_grub partition to install grub on that drive.

After al ot of searching, this is what I came across:\n\n\n*\n\n*The folder in which all your wine software are installed is known as your WINEPREFIX. By default this folder resides in your home (~) directory by the name '.wine'. There can be more than one WINEPREFIX.\n\n*There also exists an environment variable known as WINEARCH which represents the mode of your current wine settings, i.e. 64-bit or 32-bit.\n\n*THIS IS IMPORTANT. At the time of the creation of a WINEPREFIX the value of WINEARCH decides the mode in which wine will function when running applications from that WINEPREFIX.\n\n\nBy default the WINEARCH variable is set to the value 'win64' (stands for 64-bit) on a 64-bit Ubuntu installation therefore the automatically created WINEPREFIX has a 64-bit operation mode. In order to change this mode we need to 1) delete the current WINEPREFIX. 2) set WINEARCH to 'win32' 3)Create a new WINEPREFIX. The Steps:\nNOTE: These steps are to be done after installing wine. You can easily do that using the Ubuntu Software Center. search for Wine 1.6 and click install.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T. And type the following commands:\ncd ~\nrm -rf .wine\nrm -f .config/menus/applications-merged/wine*\nrm -rf .local/share/applications/wine\nrm -f .local/share/desktop-directories/wine*\nrm -f .local/share/icons/????_*.xpm \n\n\n*Now to set your environment variable and also to create your new 32-bit WINEPREFIX go ahead and type:\nWINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine winecfg\n\nThat's about it I guess!

Plugged it in, erased current partition using fdisk and created a new extended partition using fdisk. Used all the defaults for start and end blocks:\n\nI then try to format the new partition using the following:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1\n\nHowever, I received the following error:\nmke2fs 1.42 (29-Nov-2011)\n/dev/sdb1: Not enough space to build proposed filesystem while setting up superblock\n\nAny ideas what could be wrong? Should I have created a primary partition? If so, why?\n\nA: Extended partition is 'special partition'. It only should contain logical partitions, there is no filesystem format for extended partition. So, to make filesystem, you should initially create logical disk then run\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb5\n\nNote that logical partitions start from 5.\nWhat is Extended Partition\n\nA: Danatela is correct; however:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's common practice to use a primary partition for a single-partition disk like this. Although a logical partition will work for this purpose, it involves somewhat more complex data structures than a primary partition, those data structures end up reducing the size of the partition (by an admittedly minuscule amount), and there really is no need for a logical partition on a 1-partition disk, so you get no advantages from these small disadvantages.\n\n*Your disk is 3TB in size. fdisk reports that it uses 4096-byte logical sectors, and on such disks, the MBR partition table that fdisk manipulates can handle disks that are up to 16TiB in size; however, most disks today still use 512-byte sectors, and on such disks, MBR isn't really good beyond 2TiB (or 4TiB if you push things and are willing to accept some limitations). As a general rule, on larger disks, you should use the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which you can create and manipulate with GParted, parted, or gdisk. (The very latest versions of fdisk can also handle GPT, but AFAIK no version of Ubuntu yet ships with GPT-enabled versions of fdisk.) Note also that GPT doesn't distinguish between primary, extended, and logical partitions, so if you were to use GPT, the preceding bullet point would become irrelevant.\n\n\nOverall, there's no compelling reason to change what you've got; but I wanted you to be aware of these issues because the path you've taken is becoming obsolete.\n", "Q: In a Cybercafe - how to make the Ubuntu 13.10 to be auto deepfreeze?

On reboot it go back to yesterday always? So that it works like one day use but always goes back to my first installation on each reboot?\n\nA: AuFS can solve this problem for you. Here is an example of people merging the filesystem with a RAM disk so changes go away on reboot. \nIf you don't have much memory, you could do the same using a loopback file or partition to store the changes, and re-format the loopback file/partition once a day.\n\nA: *\n\n*Ensure that each machine has one account, an admin account with a fairly strong password.

Other filesystems are protected by an init script. All protected filesystems become read-only ensuring their immutability even on power-offs.\nTo install fsprotect in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install fsprotect\n\nThe benefits of using fsprotect are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Filesystems are protected and no change is ever written to the disk.\n\n*Protected filesystems are mounted read-only. This means that they aren't damaged when the computer is turned off improperly.\n\n*It is very easy to use. \n\n*In some cases it makes the filesystem access faster.\n\n\nThe drawbacks of using fsprotect are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Filesystem changes cannot be more than a predefined limit in bytes (set by you).\n\n*Since tmpfs is heavily used, you need to have adequate swap space.\n\n", "Q: Does anyone know how to make Unity remember your opened windows on logout?

I have create a HTML5 App from Ubuntu SDK. It contains a index.html and js directory.\nNext I add \"X\" label on the html file like this:\n  <head>\n    ...\n    <style type=\"text/css\">\n       #quit { background-color: gray; color: white; font-weight: bold; display: block; text-align: right; }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n   <a id=\"quit\">X</a>\n   ...\n  </body>\n\nThe wanted effect is when “X” label is clicked, the Qt.quit() will be called and the app window be closed. Unfortunately, it won't. The app is launched by \"ubuntu-html5-app-launcher\" (contained in package \"ubuntu-html5-theme\"). So, how to modify ubuntu-html5-app-launcher to let the html5 app do something as well as native apps, for example, just close the window when we click the item defined in the html file?\nFYI: I found if I choose \"Applications >> HTML5 Application\" template from \"New file or project\" menu in the SDK, Qt.quit() can be called by html file (thru addToJavaScript function):\nvoid Html5ApplicationViewerPrivate::addToJavaScript()\n{\n    m_webView->page()->mainFrame()->addToJavaScriptWindowObject(\"Qt\", this);\n}\n\nHowever \"Applications >> HTML5 Application\" type app cannot transfer some events such as mouse over and mouse move to the built-in WebView, as a result, when user move mouse on and over the elements of the html, nothing will happen unless you click the elements.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to make html5 apps launched by ubuntu-html5-app-launcher to call\nqt functions within html file. Namely how to modify\nubuntu-html5-app-launcher\nOR \n\n*How to make \"Applications >> HTML5 Application\" type apps to transfer\nspecified events, such as mouse move and over, to the built-in html\nfile loaded by C++ class (in my demo is Html5ApplicationViewer\ninherit form QWidget)\n\nA: The Applications templates are not Ubuntu Touch templates, those are actually just Qt Creator templates, you can't use them for Ubuntu Apps. \nWhen you make an Ubuntu HTML5 app you can use standard JavaScript mouse event handlers like onmousemove, onmouseover and onmouseout although right now those don't work very well. Ubuntu Touch is in rapid development though so keep an eye out for updates.\nEDIT: Use touch event handlers as specified in the W3C Specification\nYou can't really quit a HTML5 app from the app itself. It's not really a problem since if you had a chance to play with other apps for Ubuntu Touch you might have noticed that none of them have an exit button. On Ubuntu the idea is that you just slide apps into the background. \nIf you want to make a C++ application with a HTML5 UI you should read the answer to this question. \n\nA: If you create your HTML5 app with the default Qt template, then you're essentially developing a Qml app with a Webview. You have access to all of the Qml APIs but have to bind them with your webview manually.\nWhat the Ubuntu HTML5 App template provides is a container that does it for you. We currently support the following APIs in the ubuntu-html5-container:\n- W3C APIs exposed by the Webview (geolocation for example)\n- Unity APIs\n- Ubuntu Platform APIs: Alarm, Online Accounts and Content Hub currently\n- Cordova APIs: they let you access the Camera, microphone or get the battery status for example.\nOf course, you can also access online APIs as well, as this application type has the 'network' access privilege by default.\nYou can find a very good overview at: http://developer.ubuntu.com/apps/html-5/\nFor details about the Platform APIs available to HTML5 Apps, see: http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/html5/sdk-14.04/\n", "Q: Adding custom keyboard layout to Xubuntu 13.10 I'm trying to add workman-p layout to Xubuntu.

I guess xfce doesn't use this folder in 13.10.\nI had some success with xmodmap but it just changed my layout and turned off the switching to Russian I have set up.\nI need a way to add layout so that it can be switched in a normal way i.e. the settings menu.\n\nA: The Xkb directory is located at /usr/share/X11/xkb\nBesides, it's not XFCE that uses the directory, it's Xkb, a part of Xorg.\nTo create a new layout just create a file in symbols/ (eg asdf). After that you can switch to the newly created layout with setxkbmap asdf\nNext step would be to register the layout, see the files rules/base.xml and rules/evdev.xml.\nAfter registering you can switch to it other than by calling setxkbmap directly: most desktop environments honor those files and all keyboard layouts you see in keyboard settings are actually from those XML files.\n", "Q: How can I use \" inside send command I have used the /usr/bin/expect interpreter to telnet into my other system and execute some commands using send. \nTelnet is successful however the problem is that I have to use the following command\nsend \"unset vpn \"TEST\" \"\n\nwhen I run the script, it shows me the following error due to \" inside send command. \nextra characters after close-quote while executing\n\n\nA: You can use escape sequence, use the following,\nsend \"unset vpn \\\"TEST\\\"\\r\"\n\nor,\nsend {unset vpn \"TEST\"}\n\n\nA: Did you try send \"unset vpn 'TEST' \"?\n", "Q: How to setup Canon iR2520 Network Scanner?

Instead start the script with a hashbang:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nmake it executable\nchmod +x script.py\n\nput it somewhere in your $PATH and then You'll be able to run it from Your shell.\nscript.py\n\nIf You'd also like to call it from other programs, such as krusader or what ever -- You'd need to add it to a login shell $PATH -- that is for example to add it's path to ~/.bash_login or ~/.profile.\n\nBy the way in windows python scripts are started as \npython script.py\n\nbecause windows shell (command) doesn't support hashbangs.\n\nThe reason to use\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\ninstead of\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nis that with the first approach You can control which python to run -- if Your site has multiple pythons installed. env will run the first python in Your $PATH.

Im running 12.04LTS I'm running in 12.04LTS on a Dell Inspiron Mini 910 - with default specks. I really just need to get this fixed. When I use the sudo passwd root command, it still says I can't change it, the account is unlocked, but when I go to account settings, it seems that I don't have the current password right, because I can't seem to remember it.\nI used these in recovery mode:\nsudo passwd\n\nsu password: joe\nPassword joe\n\nEnter new UNIX password:\n\nRetype new UNIX password:\npasswd: password success\nroot@ubuntu:~#\n\nI'm still getting authentication errors, as well as error ID 'password'. I Booted up held shift, and ran in root. But it asks for a password, and I don't know it.\n\nA: Based on your edit, it looks like you have actually managed to log in as root. The sequence of commands you are showing does not make much sense (I understand it's hard to get used to the command line, that's not a complaint :) but since you end up with a prompt like this:\nroot@ubuntu:~#\n\nyou have managed to become root. You can make sure by running the command whoami, it should return root.\nAssuming you are indeed root, you can use the passwd command to change your user's password. I will assume your user is joe, run this command:\npasswd joe\n\nThe whole process should look something like this (the root@ubuntu # just represents your prompt, lines that begin with that represent commands and lines that don't are a command's output):\nroot@ubuntu # passwd joe\nEnter new UNIX password: \nRetype new UNIX password: \npasswd: password updated successfully\nroot@ubuntu # \n\nAt this point, user joe should have whatever password you just set for him. You should now be able to log in as joe with the new password. \nAs an aside, when logged in as root, you can become joe without needing a password:\nroot@ubuntu # su joe\njoe@ubuntu $ \n\n\nA: If you have your normal admin account (first account created when you installed Ubuntu) try this:\nsudo su -\npasswd\n\nThis will change root's password.\nBest if you want to run under root, just run sudo su - and you will be safer.\nThe root account is enabled (can't understand why people think is not), but it has a scrambled password from the installation and recommended to work like I mentioned.

It supports large XML instances and offers a highly interactive front-end (basexgui).\n\nI don't have it installed but it has really high ratings from the software center.\n\nA: If the file is an XML table, you can open it in LibreOffice Calc through the Data > XML Source menu1. Inside it, you just need to open the XML file, point to the table you're importing on the left column and specify a destination in your sheet in the right text field. Example:\n\nThis feature is documented in the Help for LibreOffice Calc and at https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Calc/XMLSource .\n1 Since this is an experimental feature (at least in V 6.1.3.2), it may be unreliable and the menu entry will be greyed out unless experimental features are enabled with Tools – Options – LibreOffice – Advanced – Enable experimental features.\n\nA: The default Gedit text editor is capable of opening the file - I also suggest you try Bluefish, which can do XML as well HTML and other languages. It also does auto-completion, and highlighting.\nHere are examples of the above editors based on this:\n  \n  \nN.B. With Gedit, you have to add some of the above by changing a few settings and activating a few plugins.\n\nA: In case you don't succeed with LibreOffice, try using SoftMaker FreeOffice.

Then create new file /usr/sbin/openvpn with the following:\n#!/bin/sh\n/usr/sbin/openvpnm --max-routes 500 \"$@\"\n\nWhere 500 is number of the routes.\nMake this file executable:\nchmod +x /usr/sbin/openvpn\n\nNow Network manager works with fine.\n\nA: When you open the connection settings, click on Advanced. At the end of the General tab, should be the setting for Specify max routes.\nNetwork Manager 1.2.6 and network-manager-openvpn 1.2.6-2ubuntu1 here.\n", "Q: MacbookPro 10.9.1 Installing linux wirless drivers I've just installed Linux on my Mac 10.9.1 and I have no Internet connection or any Wi-Fi signal.

Is it possible to repair or ignore this amount of bad sectors using Ubuntu 12.04?\nWhat is the maximum number of bad sectors a disk can have and still be repairable?\n\nA: Make a backup of your data NOW and source a replacement disk. 3500 bad blocks is excessive and no block mapping is going to result in a stable working disk for very long. That many bad blocks is a sign of impending hardware failure.\n\nA: You can use recovery tools like ddrescue to dump out an image file of the entire drive, there are options to keep a log of bad blocks and the tool will first recover all readable data, you can also prioritize different parts of the drive.  Other tools like basic file copy, or classic dd will error out on the 1st bad block encountered, or they will repeatedly re-attempt to access those bad blocks that are encountered.  You can then go back using the logfile as input and re-attempt each unreadable sector, often times you will be able to recover more than half of the bad sectors.  \nThis at least gives you the ability to partially reconstruct files on otherwise unreadable file systems or un-bootable operating systems.  You can then use other forensic tools against your disk image file. For example, to search through raw filesystem data for JPEG images.\nBeware of the syntax of input and output devices, I know there used to be one variant of ddrescue out there that had BACKWARDS input and output syntax when compared to classic dd. This caused some users to inadvertently copy their target drive over the source data they were trying to recover!  There are no warnings about overwriting existing data.\n\nA: If bad sectors is located in one or few disk areas - check by sector address, then you can exclude them by creating custom partition layout.\nActually for testing purposes i built such system - sliced hard disk in several parts, and every partition checked for readability. I had several 1Tb disks, so it was worth doing. If damaged disk partitions are joined in RAID, then system is generally safe for non mission critical purposes. System now is up 1,5 years without any further problems.\n\nA: Try remapping damaged sectors using this script:\nhttps://techoverflow.net/blog/2015/01/07/fixing-bad-blocks-on-hdds-using-fixhdd.py/\n", "Q: Double password entry when changing active users in Ubuntu 13.10 There are three primary users of my Ubuntu 13.10 Cinnamon 2.14 install: me, my wife, and our oldest daughter.\nEverything seems to work just fine unless we change users.

I removed light-locker, and now my issue is resolved. The problem is that light-locker apparently doesn't have any settings you can set and just reads the general screensaver/brightness settings.\nThus, when the screensaver time-out hits the allotted time, the system activates what are in essence two screensavers, requiring two password entries, but only one has settings you can manage.\nNaturally, I overlooked light-locker at first because of it's lack of dedicated settings interface and didn't clue in until I was reading about somebody else having gnome-screensaver and cinnamon-screensaver both installed and having the same issue I was when I realised that light-locker is forked from the Gnome 3 gnome-screensaver project. Because light-locker is just a blank screen, I didn't realize there were two screensavers running.\nAs I said though: removed light-locker and solved the problem.\n", "Q: vsftpd login incorrect issue I install vsftpd on my ubuntu server, this follow is my vsftpd.conf file:\nlisten=YES\nanonymous_enable=NO\nlocal_enable=YES\ncheck_shell=NO\nwrite_enable=YES\nlocal_umask=022\ndirmessage_enable=YES\nuse_localtime=YES\nxferlog_enable=YES\nconnect_from_port_20=YES\nchroot_list_enable=YES\nchroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list\nsecure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty\npam_service_name=ftp\nrsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem\n\nThen I try login the ftp server on my mac:\n$ ftp 162.243.78.240\nConnected to 162.243.78.240.\n220 (vsFTPd 2.3.5)\nName (162.243.78.240:tangmonk): demo\n331 Please specify the password.\nPassword:\n530 Login incorrect.\nftp: Login failed\n\nthe demo user's password is absolutely correct, But I don't know why Login incorrect.\n\nA: *\n\n*Look at your /etc/passwd file\n\n*Find your user and look shell (example ttr:x:501:501::/home/ukraine/ttr:/sbin/nologin)\n\n*Add this shell (/bin/false or /sbin/nologin) to your /etc/shell or /etc/shells\nAfter that, check your connection\n\nStatus:  Retrieving directory listing...

The kernel is a fundamental part of a modern computer's operating system.\" (Wikipedia) — i.e. Windows also has a kernel.\n\n\nA: When you say Linux that actually means the Kernel, I think that's what you mean by \"kenral\"\nso this kernel is being developed and a bunch of people or enterprises take it and build something upon it for example :\nA community of people took the Linux kernel add some software and then created an Operating System called Debian. Then a company took that Debian and created something called Ubuntu.\nThen.... you get the idea so this is why there are a lot of  Operating systems based on Linux, but since they all have this Linux software in common they  are called  \"Linux Distributions\".The Kernel is just a piece  software, make the bridge between Hardware and Software.\nUbuntu and Kubuntu are both \"buntu\" because they are based no just on the Linux Kernel but on Ubuntu either (Ubuntu it's based on Ubuntu... you get it) the difference is that Kubuntu uses a different environment called KDE, from there the 'K', Ubuntu uses gnome with unity on top of it.\nThere are a lot of Linux distros out there but there is a way they differ them.One way to distinguish them is by the type of packages they use some use \".rpm \" some use \".deb\"... or by dependency resolver, the software that makes sure that when you install a program you have all the little software needed for that greater software to work. \nFor example Ubuntu uses (.deb) and apt-get , Opensuse uses (.rpm) and zypper\n\nA: Ubuntu is an operating system. Just like Windows, mac OS X and so...\nKubuntu is an Ubuntu variant. It has a different \"desktop environment\" called \"KDE\". There are lots of other Ubuntu variants like \"Lubuntu\", for example, that uses \"LXDE\" desktop environment. The desktop environment is the part of the operating system that mainly controls how it looks and usually it would have various functions.\n...About the kernel.\nUbuntu itself as a whole is based on \"the Linux kernel\". The kernel is the core part of the operating system. There are many operating systems out there based on the Linux kernel. Like \"Debian\", \"Fedora\" and yes; \"openSUSE\" and \"Red Hat\" too! They \"are based\" on the Linux kernel. Windows has its own kernel of course.\n", "Q: Internet Explorer is not being installed, and getting stopped in between?

Quite simply, Internet Explorer is not expected to work well in Wine, unless you are trying to run Internet Explorer 3.01 for Windows 3.11, which actually has a \"Gold\" rating (the next best one).\nI would suggest you install something like VirtualBox and actually run Windows within Ubuntu instead, that way you'll be running Internet Explorer natively which will work a lot better than running it with Wine.\nAlso, see this possible duplicate question: How to install Internet Explorer (multiple versions)?\n\nA: Internet explorer doesn't work well in wine.\nUse VirtualBox and the VMs from IE Virtual tools.\n", "Q: Notify-send won't show notification unless run with sudo I have just tried to use notify-send on my 13.10 machine and can't get it to work without using sudo with it. \nI don't know what details can I provide with this issue. \nMy notify-osd version : \n$ ii  notify-osd      0.9.35+13.10.20130917.1-0ubuntu1-leolik~ppa0  amd64        daemon that displays passive pop-up notifications\n\nOn regular version for 13.10 there was the same issue.\nEDIT \n$ ll /usr/bin/notify-send\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 14720 wrz 10 16:12 /usr/bin/notify-send\n\n\nA: Maybe try to reinstall it with:\nsudo apt-get purge notify-osd && sudo apt-get install notify-osd\n", "Q: Start-up / Reboot scripts for different users I'm still trying to learn a little more about bash scripting and start-up / reboot, I have read about crontab @reboot and also just looking at other options but I just wondered if someone could maybe point me in the right direction before I find out there are limits on the method I am trying so on... \nHere is what I am trying to accomplish:\nI have 2 users that need to run processes on reboot / start-up:\nUser1: 5 Processes all run with standard privileges (No problems here)\nUser2: 2 Escalated commands (sudo) and 5 processes standard privileges to be run but only once mysql and the above processes are active.\nI only have ssh access to the server so this is why I have opted from the info I have been reading to try the bash/cron method.\nI have tested sudo command works with a bash script and seems to be good, all the accounts use keys rather than passwords so I do not get prompted to confirm the password, I've yet to test this on a reboot but will do very soon.\nThe main problem is checking if the 5 processes run by user1 have loaded before letting user2 start its work, with two separate bash scripts is it possible to create a wait or loop to check for running process names before continuing on?\nThanks \n\nA: I'm not completely sure if this is what you are looking for, but I believe .profile is run on boot for the individual user.\nI hope this helps for half your problem, though if you are logging the user simultaneously , I don't believe it will work sequentially. \nUbuntu .profile\nA way I use to check processes is with python scripts.

Screen is black after logging.\nAny suggestion to put gedit back on track?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Correct me if I'm wrong but aren't you saying that gedit will not work when your PYTHONPATH looks like this:\n\n/usr/local/Madagascar_1.5/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/usr/lib/python2.7:/usr/local/lib/python2.7:/usr/local/Madagascar_1.5/lib/python2.7:/usr/local/Madagascar_1.5/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/usr/local/Madagascar_1.5/lib:/usr/lib/python3\n\nBut when you manually change it with export to\n\n/usr/lib/python3\n\nIt works fine?\nIs there any reason why you would want the path to look like in the first example all the time? You could make it to that by adding the export command to ~/bash.rc\nedit: Also, could you experiment and try putting the part that gedit likes, /usr/lib/python3, at the start of the path and then the rest of it afterwards, rather than having python3 right at the end? Maybe it uses \"short circuit logic\" and chooses the first one it finds that works.\n", "Q: apt-build on ubuntu, if I change processor will give problem? I installed apt-build on Ubuntu, it is a program that compiles and installs programs. It compiles optimally for the user processor and this makes programs run quickly.\nBut I thought what if I change my processor in the future, programs compiled for the old processor will present problems? If yes, then I have to compile again?\nPlease someone who use apt-build help me.\n\nA: On installing apt-build, you set the parameters for optimization. You can check what this are currently by running:\ncat /etc/apt/apt-build.conf\n\nWhich in my case gives:\nbuild-dir = /var/cache/apt-build/build\nrepository-dir = /var/cache/apt-build/repository\nOlevel = -O2\nmtune = -mtune=i586\noptions = \" \"\nmake_options = \" -j4\"\n\nSo you can see mine is optimized of i586 architecture, as this computer has a Intel i5 processor (I think i586 is right for this type - seems to work). \nIt also depends on what you set here:\n\nSo if your apt-build settings are set to Strong, they are less likely to work.\nIf you want to change the settings you set, you can do that simply by running:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure apt-build\n\nSo as long as your processor is better than the old one, it might be fine...\n\nA: When you choose the architecture, it means the compilation will generate code for some processor family, and you'll have trouble if you change to a different one. If you change to a compatible processor, it should work fine.\nIf, for example, you compile for an Intel Core i3, switching to an Intel Core i5 will work fine, but might not if you switch to an AMD A10, depending on what you targeted.\nThere are different levels of generality. If you compile for older architectures, it's more likely to get a binary that can run on different processors, at the expense of losing some optimizations.\nWilf is compiling to i586, which is a Pentium 32 instruction set. Any modern processor will run that, but it won't make many optimizations. i586 code will run both on an Intel Core i5 and on an AMD A10, and also on a Celeron, on a Pentium III and on many others (32 and 64 bits). If you have a 64 bit processor, compile to a 64 bit family, or you won't be really optimizing much.\nIf you're changing your processor only, not the whole motherboard, to a newer one, you should be fairly safe, as most differences should be between processors using different sockets, AND you're likely changing to a newer version of roughly the same technology.\n", "Q: decent equalizer for 12.04? I am looking for decent equalizer for ubuntu 12.04. Recently, with 13.04 and 13.10 I have tried pulseaudio eq and other eq's. All of them were rubbish. Mainly because the output volume, because of them, decreased about 70% and equalizer it self (other than decreasing volume output) did nothing.\nI have built in realtek audio chipset.

Am I right in thinking that?\n\nA: Make sure you're not blocking any of the fan outlets.\nIt generally a good idea to open the case from time to time to clean out all the fluff and dust that builds up.\nFans can become noisy if the blades are dirty.\n\nA: This is a common problem with notebooks. Because there isn't a lot of space, it's very important to keep the air moving freely through the cooling fins. \nOften you can cure this by cleaning the fan and the cooling fins. You'll probably find a lot of dust and fluff in there.\nOften there is a shortcut to get to the cooling system, so you don't have to take the whole computer apart.\nAlso check how much CPU is being used when the fan is running. You can use the command\ntop \n\nto see what's going on. Or use the resource monitor from the menu.\n", "Q: grub Refresh or Resolution Too High. How can I adjust it? I installed Ubuntu 12.04 using the Windows installer while in Windows XP. When I reboot and select Ubuntu as my boot option my monitor tells me \"Out of range\" \nI believe at this point I would be looking at the grub bootloader and could choose regular or safe boot for linux and the default option is likely selecting after several seconds. After waiting several minutes (when ubuntu would be fully loaded) the resolution or refresh rate are still too high or low for me to do or see anything.\nMy monitor tells me the W refresh is 40hz (too low) and H is 80hz (too high.) I would like to adjust the resolution for grub and ubuntu to resolution to 1024*768 and refresh rate to 60hz, I believe then I will be able to see things after choosing Ubuntu from the windows bootloader.\nHow can I go about adjusting this, considering I am unable to see anything in the bootloader or ubuntu OS? I am able to work with Windows XP still if that opens up any options.\n\nA: There are already many questions and answers like this.\nIn short:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot in recovery mode  - instruction here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode You will be able to adjust all settings (text mode only).\n\n*Follow directions in this post - Screen Resolution \"Out of Range\"\n\n*For more information use Google search.

I have no local access to the machine and there is no rescue system; every time I try something I have to use their web admin tools to reinstall the image.\nProblem: Every time I try to install and setup UFW I end up being locked out of the server. Here are the commands I've been running:\n locale-gen \"en_US.UTF-8\"\n locale-gen \"en_CA.UTF-8\"\n apt-get update\n apt-get -y upgrade\n apt-get -y install nano ufw git\n ufw allow ssh\n ufw allow sftp\n ufw allow ftp\n ufw allow smtp\n ufw allow \"Apache Full\"\n ufw allow out 53\n ufw enable\n\nI've also tried first running the defaults \n sudo ufw default deny incoming\n sudo ufw default deny outgoing\n\nAs well as making sure that -A ufw-user-input -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT is in /lib/ufw/user.rules\nIn all cases and every combination I've tried I end up losing the connection to the server and being totally locked out.

All of the others are running UFW with no problems.  I also tried all of the above steps on a Debian 7 64bit image with this VPS provider but had the same problem.\nWhat's going on here?\n\nA: I've learned that this is problem with my OpenVZ VPS; you cannot modify kernel files on a non KVM system like OpenVZ.\nYour best bet is to forget about UFW entirely and write the iptable rules directly, or try this work around:\nhttp://blog.kylemanna.com/linux/2013/04/26/ufw-vps/\n", "Q: Computer running on grub console I just restared my computer and the graphic ubuntu grub no longer appears.

I want to keep a change log of things I do in Kubuntu - in other words if I tweak some setting I want to make a written record of it so I can roll back if I screw up.\nWhat's the best way to do this?  I know that in Windows notepad I could add \".LOG\" to the start of a file and it would insert the time and date after each entry.  I see that Kubuntu's Kate editor has a \"Changelog\" mode, but could I use this for what I want to do?\n\nA: I would use a script. Suppose that your log file is $HOME/etc/mylogfile.txt. \nThen save this script with a useful name in your $HOME/bin folder, for example addtolog, and make it executable:  \n#!/bin/bash\n#\nlogfile=$HOME/etc/mylogfile.txt\n{ \n  echo                   #blank line \n  echo -n \"Entry on \"    #echo -n output the text without a new line\n  date                   #current date \n  echo                   #other blank line\n} >> $logfile            #append output of {...} to $logfile\ngvim + \"$logfile\"        #change with your preferred editor. The + tells gvim to \n                         #open the file and put the cursor at the end\nexit\n\nThen you can use the command addtolog and start writing. The nice thing is that you can heavily customize this in the way you want --- change text, date format, whatever.\nThe editor Kate seems to have a -l option to go to a line, but not a \"go to the end of file\" command; but this is solved with (substitute the gvim line with this one) \nkate -l $(wc -l \"$logfile\") \"$logfile\" &> /dev/null\n\nwc -l file returns the number of lines in the file file; we use the $() bash command substitution here. The &> /dev/null here is to shut Kate a bit --- in a non-KDE environment like mine is otherwise incredibly verbose. \nIf you want to launch it from the desktop, simply prepare a .desktop file for it (you can find tens of answers on how to do that here). \n", "Q: Double boot-up alongside Windows 8 and my hard-drives are not showing in windows I've installed Ubuntu along with Windows 8.

When installing Ubuntu, you get a Free software only option.\nDoes that Free software only  option mean Free as in beer  or Free as in freedom?  When I say free as in freedom, I mean FSF type of freedom.\n\nImage source: How do I make Ubuntu use only free software?\n\nA: Ubuntu is a free software. In fact, Ubuntu is \"The world's most popular free OS\". But there are applications for Ubuntu which are not free. These applications are in generally included in restricted and multiverse repositories. \nSo, that option about you asked, Free software only make that these repositories (restricted and multiverse) to be disabled from your sources list. Like this when you will search something in Ubuntu Software Center for example, you will find free software only.\n\nA: This allows to install a system without anything from the restricted repositories.  \nWhen you select this boot option components/software will be removed from the system after the file copy process has taken place. \n\nA: FSF free is not the same as the free software only. There is free as in free beer and free as in freedom; FSF is free as in freedom, and the Ubuntu free only is free as in free beer.\nFSF maintains a list of what they consider free distros.\nSee also Linux Libre. \nAlas, many of those are great distros, but many are poorly maintained. \nOf the distros listed, IMO the most actively maintained are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Trisquel, which is based on Ubuntu, screenshot:\n\n\n*Parabola, based on Arch linux. \nThe others, including Musix and dynbolic, are great distros, but have not had recent releases.\nThere is also an apt repository for the libre kernel.\nKeep in mind, although the beer is free, you should tip the bartender and support projects you use with donations - Ubuntu, Trisquel, or otherwise.\n", "Q: Toshiba Satellite P755-S5269 keyboard backlight doesn't work I'm new to Ubuntu and I have a problem with the keyboard backlight on my laptop.

But when selecting Windows 8 to boot i get following error. error: unknown command ´drivemap'error: invalid EFI filepath\nI ran boot repair. the output can be found here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6995882/\nI hope anyone can help me!\nThank you!\n\nA: The error you report indicates that you're trying to boot with the \"Windows Recovery Environment (loader) (on /dev/sda2)\" or \"Windows 8 (loader) (on /dev/sda3)\" entries. Those entries are both suitable for BIOS-mode Windows installations, but you've clearly got an EFI-mode installation. Thus, you should be using the \"Windows UEFI bootmgfw.efi\", \"Windows Boot UEFI loader\", \"Windows UEFI recovery bootmgfw.efi\", or \"Windows Boot UEFI recovery\" entries. (Probably the first of those.)\nIf none of those entries work, then something is wrong. In this case, I recommend you download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager, prepare a medium with it, and boot to that medium. You should be able to boot to both Windows and Ubuntu with rEFInd. If this works, install the Debian-package version of rEFInd in Ubuntu. The computer should then boot to rEFInd when you reboot, and you can use rEFInd as your default boot manager. rEFInd tends to be much less finicky about booting Windows than is GRUB, so using it instead of GRUB as your primary boot manager often fixes problems like this.\n", "Q: Keyboard backlight I have a Samsung Series 7 NP700Z5AH with keyboard backlight.\nAfter Ubuntu install it doesnt work, is it possible to fix?\nThere was a \"Fucntion\" shortcut for the sharpness of the light FN+F9/F10.\n\nA: I have a similar system; in 13.10 my keyboard backlight works after installing Voria's PPA. \nTo learn more about PPA please check this question and answers (especially useful is the page on PPAs risks).  \nIn my Samsung (which is a 700Z5B) it works automatically but the auto on-off stops working if you try to change the lightness (under the \"power\" control settings). \nUPDATE 14.04.3 it now works automatically --- no PPA needed.

Is there a way to automatically run as gksudo when I click on the Sublime Text icon?\n\nA: Sublime Text should have a .desktop file located in /usr/share/applications/ named sublime-text.desktop.  \nOpen it and change the Exec= line to include gksu (or gksudo they are the same) at the beginning.  \n\nNow unpin and repin the sublime text icon to the launcher.\nNOTE: Your path to the sublime executable will probably be different, that's because I installed the Sublime 3 beta, don't worry about it, just add gksu.\n\nA: gksudo - is graphical sudo. For instance you won`t see Password dialog if you run command \"sudo nautilus\" using Alt+F2\nYou may make a script (sh file)\n#!/bin/bash\ngksudo /usr/bin/<your_app>\n\nThen \nchmod +x <your scrypt.sh>\n\nAnd then run it in Nautilus (check option \"ask what to do when opening executable files\" in settings)\n\nA: Like Seth said, Sublime Text should have a .desktop file located in /usr/share/applications/ named something like sublime-text.desktop.\nYou can then open it up and change the exec= line to include gksudo at the beginning, so it should now look like this: gksudo <command already there for starting Sublime-text>.\nWhile this will automatically launcher Sublime text with the gksudo window, you will still have to enter your password each time, which isn't what you want.\nHowever, what you want is possible to do, but the only way I can think of would introduce a pretty serious security risk. \nYou would have to turn off the sudo timeout, which allows basically anything to run as sudo, without your permission, which basically defeats the entire purpose of the sudo password. Check out this question for some possible help with that.\nAll in all, I know of no way to do what you want entirely safely. If you don't mind risking your system a little, it can be done via turning off the sudo timeout, but I highly recommend against that.\nYou would still have to enter the sudo password each time you log on, but by turning off the sudo timeout you wouldn't have to enter it again until you logged out or rebooted.\n\nA: update 2020-06-27: gksu is deprecated and has been removed for security concerns.\nsee I need an equivalent of gksu in 18.04\nlong story short:\nsudo -H subl\n\nnote that the sudo -H is simple enough but it suffers the same security issues as gksu. better option (for reasons beyond my understanding) would be pkexec. there's also admin:// protocol but it didn't work for me with sublime.\n\nA: I know you asked for every time, people reading this if you want to just launch it once as root try \nsudo subl\n\nDo Not Use.

We consider HA bootstrap to be the final piece that Juju needs to be considered production ready. \nThe ability to add another bootstrap node for HA purposes will be in Juju 2.0 this April. \nCurrently, if the bootstrap node goes away you \"only\" lose the orchestration, your services and machines stay running, you'll just have to manually ssh from then on.

There doesn't seem to be anyway to change their color, changing various themes doesn't seem to help either.\nExample:\n\n\nA: Desktop icon text is handled by .nautilus-desktop.nautilus-canvas-item. It is very simple to customize.\nIn your main GTK theme's gtk.css, underneath the initial @import url line (and not before, in my testing), put:\n.nautilus-desktop.nautilus-canvas-item {\ncolor: #ffffff;\ntext-shadow: 1 1 alpha (@fg_color, 0.8);\n}\n\nTo see changes, do killall nautilus followed by nautilus and take a look at the Desktop.\nCustomize as you like: change color to #000000 for black, or, see if the (optional) text-shadow line (with nice alpha transparency) that I've included helps itself, even with white color!\nFor further ideas, try googling \".nautilus-desktop.nautilus-canvas-item\" to see what others have done with this entry. I'm no expert at CSS or the above text-shadow code.\nThe other neat thing to customize the desktop icon text (and this customization is immediate with no nautilus restart required), is:\nThe dconf value org.gnome.nautilus.desktop font. To make text bold, simply put Bold as its value (default is empty). To change font size, add a number in there also, e.g. Bold 10. Font can be changed too, e.g. Serif Bold 10 - and I wonder what else can too.\nLastly, changing the icon view size in general via Nautilus preferences, View, 'Icon view Defaults' may make any of the above customizations more palatable by how much text width area it gives (for me, 50% zoom works VERY nicely with Bold 10 in dconf and the example css in gtk.css).\nN.b. I'm in Debian Wheezy 7.8 so I hope it's not too different from Ubuntu itself here! I don't think there are any differences at time of writing.\n\nA: After searching here and there to change the themes file, it seems I don't need to change anything in the theme to have this. In fact, It's not even possible without much hacking. Because Gnome Developers (for some reason only known to them) bundled most of the theme files in gresource binary file. The files in /usr/share/themes/Adwaita only for GTK-2 components. Gtk-3 files are in libgtk-3.so file and gnome-shell-theme.gresource file.\nBut finally I observed that the overridden file take effects actually, though it takes time.\nYou would override the theme. The content is same as given by Sillyman. The difference is, you write in gtk.css file in ~/.config/gtk-3.0 folder.\n.nautilus-desktop.nautilus-canvas-item {\n    color: blue;\n    text-shadow: 1px 1px white;\n}\n\nReplace your favorite color in color field. You can even thicken the shadow by increasing the pixels.\nBut you need to wait some time. Try using another theme for a while after overriding it. You can also try killing nautilus using nautilus -q and starting it again.\nHere is a screenshot after changing the font color in Adwaita.\n\n\nHere is some useful links I visited about this problem.

It's included in the Ubuntu live USB. Boot Ubuntu from USB, run sudo gparted in a prompt and you are on your way.\n\nA: Startup Disk Creator is only designed to handle Debian-based ISOs.

So I am in a long-winded attempt to set up an ubuntu/windows8 dual boot. After running boot repair, there are 2 ubuntu entries (one is a recovery), 4 windows recovery entries, and a regular windows entry. the latter gives my an unknown command: drivemap, error: invalid EFI filepath \n Browsing multiple other forums has led me to add \nmenuentry \"Windows 8\" {\ninsmod part_gpt\ninsmod chain\nset root='(hd1,gpt4)'\nchainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nto my /etc/grub.d/40_custom in order to add a working entry.

Any sugestions to fix either entry? \nI got this computer last week and I've been trying to get a dual boot running since then. I can Access both windows 8 and ubuntu by switching the boot priority in my bios settings, but I'd like to access them through GRUB. \n\nA: The blkid output you posted in pastebin indicates that /dev/sdb9 was intended to be the Ubuntu partition, since it's formatted to ext4. /dev/sdb5 has the label \"Windows8_os\" suggesting that this is the Windows 8 partition (its large size and position after an MS Reserved Partition indicates this is true as well).\nIf this is indeed the case, then it appears that your custom grub entry is using the wrong number for the partition pointer gpt4 in the line set root='(hd1,gpt4)'.\nGRUB2 hard drive numbering starts with 0, so the first hard drive on your computer would be hd0, the second hd1, and so forth.\nHowever, GRUB2 partition numbers begin with 1, indicating that your chosen partition gpt4 is the 4th partition on sdb, not the 5th.\nTry changing the line to set root='(hd1,gpt5)', so that GRUB attempts to load the 5th partition rather than the 4th. It may be giving you an 'invalid filesystem' error because your current grub.cfg points to the MS Reserved Partition instead of the actual Windows 8 partition.\n", "Q: Programming Java on Ubuntu 13.10 I have ubuntu 13.10 and I am trying to use a disk that contains a book, How to program Java, 7th edition.

When I installed Ubuntu 13.10 I just ran through the default setup. Since then, I have decided to upgrade my physical memory.\nMy question is, Will Ubuntu auto-adjust the default swap size to match the new memory. \nIf not, how do I adjust it myself?\n\nA: No, it will not change it's size because of upgrading/changing the physical memory.\nThe swap system in linux is a separate partition type \"Linux swap\" (82). To change this it would be the easiest way to boot from a GParted live system. With this you can decrease the size of your root partition and increase the size of the swap partition.

Does the desktop version\nconsume more resources?\n\n*If I use the server version, is it possible download bitorrent with\ncommand lines?\n\n*Is Ubuntu appropriate for this? Or, should I look for a lighter\ndistro?\n\nA: I'm answering this based on my experience using Ubuntu as my home server. I did not use an old PC, though - I built my own custom system in a little box, but it has desktop-class specs (2.8GHz and 8GB RAM). I use it primarily as a Plex Media Server, and it also does some file management, occasional torrents, downloads podcasts, has local time and DNS servers, VPN, and for occasional virtualization experiments. [I built my system with Plex and virtualization in mind, which is why I put all those resources in it. I'm sure I wouldn't need all those resources for the other things I do.]\nQuestion 1: Should I use Ubuntu Desktop or Server? Does the desktop version consume more resources?\nYes, the desktop version will consume more resources, but if you use something like lxde or xfce, it probably will not impact performance in a way that would noticeably affect the kind of use you are describing. If you feel confident in your command line skills, you can use the server version, but like this article suggests, the desktop version contains or can install anything in the server version, is easier to setup, and offers a GUI if you ever need one.\nIf you start from Ubuntu Desktop, lxde or xfce is simple to install from the software center or the repos. If you start from Ubuntu Server, it is always possible to install a GUI after the fact, but I've never tried it.\nQuestion 2: If I use the server version, is it possible download bitorrent with command lines?\nI don't know about the default bittorrent client (Transmission). But Deluge, which I use, features a command line interface and a web-based UI as optional features. I use its web UI, which is excellent, and which I can access from other computers and devices on my network or outside my network via VPN. Deluge is available from the Ubuntu Software Center or from the repos.\nQuestion 3: Is Ubuntu appropriate for this? Or, should I look for a lighter distro?\nUbuntu Server is minimal in terms of system requirements. Ubuntu Desktop might get a little cramped if you use Unity, especially if you're not going to be looking at it a lot. (My home server runs Ubuntu Desktop 12.04, but with a lot more RAM than you're talking about, so your mileage may vary.)\nIf I were trying this, I would probably start by trying Ubuntu Desktop (just because I'm still more comfortable with a GUI to fall back on if needed), and if that doesn't perform well, I'd try again with Server edition.\n", "Q: How to find active users in Ubuntu?

I usually set a very short timeout (2-3 seconds) as you will get a second menu afterwards with GRUB, that actually does detect Windows, so you can get back to the first menu if you wish anyway. Of course, one could argue that it's cleaner to just fix GRUB.

The ssd is a 120gb so if there is any free space I'd like to partition it so I can keep the free space and lock the os side. I don't know how. Thank you\n\nA: \nMy HDD is not showing up in the Ubuntu home finder so I can only save documents to the ssd. I only want the ssd for the software. How can I make the HDD visible and the default drive for Ubuntu.\n\nInstall gparted (sudo apt-get install gparted) and run it with root privileges, sudo gparted. Find your missing disk in the drop down in the top right. If it is not formatted, format it with ext4. In order to help you further you would need to supply some more information (screenshots, perhaps), but after formatting it should show up on your desktop, and upon clicking it Ubuntu should mount it for you.\nYou can also use gparted to partition your SSD in the way you describe.\n", "Q: Can't find what I installed I installed kdiff3qt through the synaptic package manager but now I can't find it. I've looked in the Ubuntu Software Center and it shows that it (and kdiff3-doc) was installed but I can't find it anywhere. Any suggestions on how to find it?\n\nA: Try typing kdiff in a terminal and let it auto-complete by pressing TAB, and press enter. If nothing happens, press TAB twice to see your options. Usually when you install a package like this, the binary for that package has a similar name to the package itself. Not always, but it's a good place to start.\nIf you want to create a shortcut on your desktop, all you really need to know is what command launches the application. Right click, create a shortcut, fill in the name of the shortcut and what command to run. This is roughly how it's done in XFCE anyway.

Our best bet is to get 40MHz channel width (HT40 mode) in 2.4GHz band. The problem is that brcmsmac doesn't properly support 40MHz mode in 2.4GHz band, atleast for BCM4313. There's no DSSS/CCK mode support either. I hope the driver improves in newer kernels. When Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr is released, I'll try this again with its 3.13 kernel.\n", "Q: Mark PDF as Adobe PDF There are several journal websites (typically Taylor and Francis) that require that all PDF files submitted to it for reviewing should be Adobe PDFs. The submission engine will not accept a PDF generated by LaTeX or OpenOffice. \nTo do this conversion, one has to actually boot into Windows, open the PDF file with Adobe Acrobat Reader, save as a new file and then upload the paper to the journal website. This is is kind of a funny procedure and hampers the freedom. \nWhat software can I install, so that I can denote the PDF as an Adobe PDF, so that I can easily submit the paper to the journal website. \n\nA: It's probably also dependent on the PDF version:\n\n\n*\n\n*In my document headers created with LibreOffice, the version 1.4 is having fewer header information.\n\n*Using the print function (f.e. firefox) uses 1.5, which is the same like a PDF I created with the newest M$ Word (2010).\n\n\nCould you try out PDFsam (pdf split and merge) ?

I've tired a number of things to get this to work and I'm missing something. \nI ran out of space on my 8gb bootable flash drive. I'm running 12.04 server. The drive has sda1 (primary 4gb), sda2 (extended 4GB) and sda5 (swap 4gb).\nI tried copying old drive to new drive using ddrescue (whole drive copy) and then resizing on another linux box using gparted.  I made sda1 ~22Gb (75% of the drive) and used the remaining space for sda2 and sda5.  When I tried booting it I get to the GRUB menu and when I select the OS I get a message about not enough room or space.  \nNext try.  \nI dd'd the MBR of the new drive and then created sda1 - primary linux 83 (75% of sectors on drive), sda2 - extended 5 (25% - remaining sectors), sd5 - logical linux 82 swap (same sectors as sda2).  I then wrote the changes and exited fdisk.  I then ran ddrescue with the following command:  ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 \n(old drive copied to new drive).  It competed successfully.  I mounted the new copied partition and ran df to see the free space and it shows the same amount as the old small drive -97% used.  I thought I had to resize or something so I moved drive to other linux box and ran gparted.  Didn't find that the partiion needed resizing.  \nThe new partition has the same UUID as the original but I think i might need to copy the old swap partition UUID to the new one and I don't know how - only how to randmly generate a new one. \nSo, where did I go wrong here. Am I close to getting this right?\n\nA: Ok, this is what i would do:\nAssuming your old disk is /dev/sda and the new one is sdb.\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb\n\nAfter that, check if it is booting.\nIf it does, you can resize the partitions with your tool of choice.\n\nA: Also you can use clonezilla (http://clonezilla.org/). It offer many options, but with dd command is good in your case.\n\nA: Yeah.. I would nuke the swap partition.. comment it out of your /etc/fstab, then after cloning it w/dd (use bs=4096) then boot off the new drive.. grow your root fs (as you commented) and then when working.. jsut create a new partition, type \"swap\".. and after you can see it with \"fdisk -l\", then just set it up as a usable swap system with \"mkswap [-c] [-f] [-p PSZ] [-L label] [-U uuid] device [size]\" and run \"swapon -a\" to test it.\nOr..

The first 10 or so times I actually entered the correct password for the remote machine, after that I just left it blank but it kept re-opening each time I pressed either one of the Ok, Cancel or X (window close) buttons or the Enter key. After many times, a Nautilus window actually opened, but it kept asking me for the password. After even more times, the dialog didn't come up by itself, so I thought I could now browse the remote machine's file system.\nUnfortunately even then, as soon as I clicked a folder or file, I had to click away many of the password requests again.\nInterestingly, I was able to browse or even copy files between machines, even though I didn't enter any password on those useless prompts.\nb\nI also tried the whole process again (after restarting both machines), this time with the Password and Remember this password options set in the Connect to Server dialog. Didn't make any difference.\nThis password prompt is especially annoying because it is system-modal, which means I can't do anything else (not even switch to another window) if it is visible.\nAny idea what might be causing this? Or should I switch to a different remote mouting GUI such as Gigolo?\n\nA: FWIW: I have successfully used the ssh credentials by entering: ssh://username@hostname in the \"connect to host\" field. It will connect using ssh encryption keys instead of password.

Had to unplug eth0 and reboot- then Network manager detected it.\nThe documentaion for this device is close to non-existant, playing around I discovered a more elegant solution (but still not perfect):\nThe software installs a script: 3g_connect.sh \nRun 3g_connect.sh form the terminal:\n3g_connect.sh 003:010 \nie the arguement to 3g_connect.sh is the BUS:DEVICE pair from you post:\n\nmy USB-device is found (\"Bus 003 Device 010: ID 2001:a707 D-Link Corp.\")\n\nNote: The 3g_connect.sh script should be run as root for it to work, but running it as a normal user did force Network manager to detect the dongle- and I could then use Network manager to manage it- which I prefer).\nHope this helps.\n\nA: You seem to have installed the drivers for the device already.

Likely we are faced with a bandwidth issue where listeners have a temporary drop, or the Icecast server is unable to provide streams at the rate demanded.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the likely case that we can not easily increase overall bandwidth we can try to priorize all streaming connections e.g. in the router.\n\n*Alternatively we can try to gently increase the source timeout limits to disconnect clients in our ìcecast.xml configuration file in the section <limits>:\n<limits>\n    ...\n    <source-timeout>10<source-timeout>\n    ...\n<limits>\n\n\n*Another method to avoid disconnecting clients it to define a low bitrate fallback mount in the <mount> section.\n", "Q: Install ffmpeg in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Background :\nI used ffmpeg to merge two videos side by side.

This is increasingly popular on home ISPs to stop spam. They will force you to use their central mailserver.\n\n*You are inadvertently blocking outbound port 25. This would be something you've actively done. Check your ufw/iptables rules for spurious deny rules.\n\n*The remote services are blocking you.\n\n\nBut double check the real log with sudo less /var/log/mail.log and make sure you're not missing any obvious issues your pretty logs above aren't showing.\nYou can also debug more simple network issues with simple tools:\nping mx1.hotmail.com\n\nIf ping fails, there's a serious network-level issue. You managed to look it up in the first place so DNS should be fine but if you can't ping it that might suggest you're being blocked completely.\ntelnet mx1.hotmail.com 25\n\nThat should open up a raw connection to the remote mailserver. If that doesn't work, you know it's not postfix that's tripping over.\n\nA: From your comment:  \n\nIf I telnet mx1.hotmail.com 25 from any pc at my home network and it\n  won't connect, is that mean that ISP blocks outbound port 25?\n\nYes, your ISP is blocking port 25 outbound.\nYou can try contacting your ISP to request unblocking port 25; some will, some won't. And many times when they do unblock it, it will get blocked again at some point as they re-provision network services.\nYour other option is to find an SMTP relay service that will allow the use of alternate ports, like the 465 and 587 submission ports. Most of these services now charge a fee, though there are still a few free ones out there (I use reachmail.net and was able to get a free relay set up with them). Google searching and researching their service offering is your best plan for this option.\nThe one downside of using alternate ports is speed: delivery takes much longer to complete.\nThe upside of using an SMTP relay is that you will avoid the blacklisting problems associated with your ISP - I see that your domain is on the Zen and Spamhaus blacklists because of your ISP's IP for your connection.\n", "Q: Where did I fail with my basic iptables setup?

The change should be informed to kernel without rebooting. \n\nA: You may want to set up your system using LVM to get the flexibility of manipulating partitions on the fly.  You can even pick up and move your system partition from one disk to another using LVM.  For normal partition tables, gparted can add new partitions without rebooting, and delete/move/resize existing partitions as long as they are not currently mounted.  With msdos partition tables, if one logical partition is mounted then the whole extended partition is considered mounted so you can't resize it.  This restriction is lifted in 14.04, as well as gaining the ability to grow mounted partitions ( for most filesystem types ).\n\nA: if you use Ubuntu 12.xx+ search unity with \"Disks\" then click that icon.you will see the partitions.if you use single partition of all entire hard disc,backup your datas and part your hard disk without rebooting or formatting\n\nA: Yes you cannot do it while using .Only way is that: install Remastersys and backup all your data (including home folder) and save that iso image(nearly 2 GB) to external memory.then you can manipulate you hard disc with ubuntu live  cd and reinstall backed up remastersys iso image.thats clear way\n", "Q: Set permissions just for a subfolder I have a folder under the /etc directory.\nThis folder and files contained in it has to be accessed by every user beloning to myGroup group.\nI correctly set permissions: every file in this directory gives me, after\nls -l\n\n\nmy file owner myGroup\n\nthis goes for every subfolder (I manually set this for each file/folder).\nAnyway, if I type\ncat /etc/myFolder/example.txt\n\nIt tells me that I don't have anough permissions.\nI think this is due to the fact that /etc folder belongs to the root.

In order to have some amount of order for this, I have this split into subfolders, in the following structure:\n\n/data/Work/sandbox/mmyy/ddmmyy \n\n(i.e. today's folder is /data/Work/sandbox/0214/260214.)\nIn order to be able to switch to this directory quickly, I set up my .bashrc so as to assign an environment variable, $TODAYSAND, which changes daily and points to the correct folder, using the date command:\nTODAYSAND=\"/data/Work/sandbox/`date +%m%y/%d%m%y`\"\n\nThis works fine in shells, so I've removed this line from .bashrc and added it to my profile.d in a new script, /etc/profile.d/sandbox.sh. It still sources correctly, and in terminals I can still cd $TODAYSAND without any issues at all.\nI would now like to set a bookmark in Nautilus that points to this folder and changes dynamically in the same way, so that I don't have to track down the latest one every time. However, I can't get it to even accept $TODAYSAND as a folder name. If I type it in the top bar (by typing a / to let me input a path rather than searching), it tries to go to a non-existent file literally named /$TODAYSAND and gives me an error saying that this doesn't exist. Similarly, if I make a bookmark pointing to $TODAYSAND, it a) creates it with the same icon as if I had told it to bookmark a network location, and b) crashes out of Nautilus instantly when I click on it.\nHow can I go about making Nautilus accept this variable as a valid filepath?\n\nA: I did not found a way to pass the Environment variables to Nautilus. \n\nHere is the answer \"How to update  a bookmark dynamically?\"\n\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 Nautilus stores bookmarks in ~/.gtk-bookmarks in the following format\nfile:///home/username/Documents\n....\nfile:///path/to/0214/260214\n\nYou can use a small bash function to change the last line to \nfile:///path/to/0214/270214\n\nIt will change the bookmark dynamically.

I am wondering if the dd command is a good choice for that. \ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb\n\nFor example: /dev/sda is my system partition (partition is on a ssd if that information is important) and /dev/sdb is my external usb hdd. \nIs it possible to clone the whole system to a specific directory on my external hdd? Like this:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb/directory\n\nI thought of the possibility to write my own backup-script, which makes a weekly backup of my system using the 'dd' command. Beyond that i want to encrypt my backup directory. What is a good choice for doing that? (I thought of EncFS for example).\n\nA: No, it is a terrible choice for that.  dd is a dumb animal.  It doesn't know anything about the filesystem, so it blindly copies every single sector, whether it is used or free space.  This results in a very large backup image.  You also can not restore it to an even slightly smaller drive, even if it had plenty of free space.\nTools like partimage and ghost4linux ( and the built in e2image gained this ability in 14.04 ) are at least smart enough to skip the unused space.  Conventional backup tools like tar and dump are much better since they offer the flexibility of restoring to slightly smaller disks if need be, or restoring only a subset of files that you accidentally deleted.  They can also do incremental backups of only the files you have changed instead of doing another full image of the entire drive each week.  You also might want to look into rsnapshot which can give you weekly backups that are browsable by each week, without taking up the disk space of full separate copies.\nIf you want to encrypt the backup, you can just use gpg to encrypt the file.  For example: tar cz / --one-file-system | gpg -c > /media/sdb/backup.tar.gz.gpg.\nFor more information see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BackupYourSystem\n\nA: You could do that, there are many ways, depends on what you prefer.  \nIf you make a dd copy of your disk (sda itself is the complete disk, not a single partition) you can copy this to a file (not directory) on a backup disk. The advantage will be that you include your bootsector. Disadvantage, you have to unmount the partition in use, in practice meaning you have to boot from a different device. Also it is a time consuming copy since it will copy everything every time again.\nMore often used are backup tools which do a file copy, they can (must) be used while the partition is mounted and they will only copy the changed files on the next run. Disadvantage, you first have to make your system bootable before you can fully restore.\nMost commonly used for this is rsync, but there are many dedicated backup programs.\nFor encryption is Encfs a possibility, however I would not use that for encrypting a diskimage because corruption somewhere in the file might make your image non-decryptable. In fact, I would prefer to use a encrypted archive instead.\nI just looked at a lot of encryption methods combined with backup in this post, maybe interesting for you. \n\nA: Another Solution:\nTry running crontab -e and add something like the below: (see here for details)\n#\n# some comments are here\n#\n#\n\n# rsync archive every day at midnight change /dev/null to a file name if you want to see the logs\n0 0 * * * rsync –avu /path/to/source ~/rsync/daily > /dev/null\n\n# rsync every sunday at 4am change /dev/null to a file name if you want to see the logs\n0 4 * * 0 rsync –avu ~/rsync/daily ~/rsync/weekly > /dev/null\n\n# rsync every 1st of the month use gzip to use less space change /dev/null to a file name if you want to see the logs\n0 0 1 * * tar -cvzf ~/rsync/monthly/monthly_$(date +%m%d%Y).tar.gz ~/rsync/daily/\n\nAnd to encrypt the folders you could do something like:\ntar -cvz /path/to/directory | openssl des3 -salt > name_of_encrypted.tar.gz\n\nAnd to decrypt:\ncat name_of_encrypted.tar.gz | openssl des3 -d -salt | tar -xvz new_name_of_directory\n\n", "Q: Skype doesn't start on Ubuntu 12.04 x64 I'm working on Ubuntu 12.04 x64 and when I'm trying to run Skype there's following message in terminal: skype: error while loading shared libraries: libgstbase-0.10.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nI've tried reinstalling and purging but it doesn't work.

While this does put unnecessary wear on the ssd, doing it once won't make much of a dent in the overall life of the drive, but you will want to be sure to trim it afterwards to restore its performance.  It also takes a lot more time to backup/restore, and requires more disk space to store the backup image.  You also have to boot from alternate media to make the backup, and can not do periodic incremental backups.\nAlignment issues only come into play if you back up an old drive that already had bad alignment and restore it to a new drive that really requires proper alignment for good performance.\nConventional backup tools like tar or just making a plain copy with rsync don't have these problems.  Restoring just becomes slightly more complex since you have to format the filesystem, restore the files, then reinstall grub, but that's really not hard.\nSee http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BackupYourSystem for more information.\n\nA: *\n\n*dd also fills empty areas with 0s reducing spare area  \n\n\ntrue, it is far from space efficient.\n\n\n*\n\n*dd may mess with alignment\n\n\nMemory chips do not have cylinders and heads, but they do have pages.

However these timings differences are very low and if you copy to the same ssd it will not differ because it are the same chips.\n\n\n*\n\n*I understand that it would be better to only write areas with actual\ndata, but is this really such an issue on a modern SSD?\n\n\nNo. Maybe the other way round, if you place backups on your SSD but reading the chips is not causing any wear and writes are at least close to a million on current SSD's. I hope you don't plan on restoring that often. :)\nSo I would call dd safe if you know how to use it and would not care too much about wear and alignment. Space considerations you can consider yourself. Dd is easy but at a cost of space and time while doing the backup. Clonezilla is a smarter way but an additional program which you also need to install before restoring.\nJust a matter of preference I guess... \n", "Q: How to I install a 64-bit OS on my Ubuntu 64-bit with vm?

If your host system is 64 bit, VirtualBox will always expose that to the guest, no matter what your settings are (see the VirtualBox manual, Chapter 3. Configuring virtual machines).\n\nA: Well, I found the answer myself. Just disable Intel TXT Feature. It works!!\n\nA: First you need to have a computer with 64 bit processor and it supports hardware virtualization.\nThen you should enable hardware vritualization through the BIOS setting. For details about setting BIOS, you can refer to Want to install 64 bit OS on VirtualBox?\n\nA: I'm having this same issue, with a windows 8.1 host. This was not an issue before the latest update to VirtualBox 4.3.8, the previous version 4.3.6 works fine. I recommend you down grade to that till a fix is released. \nOlder builds can be found here.\n\nA: Sometimes Disabled Hardware Virtualizations  may cause the problem. check that option in your BIOS. \n\nA: BIOS Settings -> Advanced BIOS Setting -> Virtualization [Enabled] (was disabled) All 64bit platforms now show up in VirtualBox\n", "Q: How do I reinstall python on my Ubuntu 12.04 server using apt-get?

These are usually major updates such as new kernels or the update from Win 8 to 8.1.\nThe UEFI setup manager (similar to bios settings) should have boot settings that let you select which system should be first in the boot order. You should be able to make Ubuntu first by holding down F2 (your system may use a different key) during startup.\nBy the way, I've read in the past that Windows always puts itself first in the boot order; but this is not true on my Asus laptop.

I installed Ubuntu Server 13.10 on the machine and openssh-server on it. The machine has only ethernet cable plugged in, no monitors or keyboards. My router uses a dhcp server but I have setuped a static ip for Server. I can remotely access it from public easily. I forwarded ssh port from my router. I did some changes to my website files and then I decided for some odd reason to reboot the server. After rebooting it, I cannot access it from public anymore. The server is currently at home and I'm away. But I managed to get physically to the server today. I plugged in a monitor to inspect in which state the server is. The server was on logon state. I checked is router working fine by connecting into wlan with my phone, and went to whatsmyipaddress.com. IP hadn't changed and connection was working. I didn't have keyboard nor my laptop with me to inspect it further. I assumed it was working because it had rebooted and internet connection was fine. When I finally made it to my laptop and tried to connect with putty it said \"Network error: Connection refused\". My lucky guess is that after every reboot I need to login physically on the server before ssh connections will work.\nI googled and found about of autologin. Wouldn't that then be a security issue? I mean you could just make a ssh connection from every single machine with internet connection if you just happen to know the IP address, and then you could just mess everything up, am I right?\nI need some suggestions what to do for this. I get to the server machine again tomorrow morning with laptop and keyboard this time so I can inspect it further. I hope you guys make up some suggestions what I should do about it. I must be able to reboot the server remotely, and then get back on it after reboot.\nThe best regards,\nRoope\n\nA: Okay. First of I want to thank all who tried to help me. I post everything what I did here.\n\"I managed physically to get to the server this morning and noticed that it's still in the same state as yesterday. BUT! I read the log above and noticed it had just logout my user, and got stuck into root (aka single-user mode). Therefore ssh connection was not available. I used 'sudo reboot now' command for rebooting. It said it failed restarting at some point but unfortunately I don't remember which point it was. Although I have ssh connection now working fine. I restarted the machine then correctly and when it had fully rebooted and asked for my user's credentials, I was able to connect via ssh from public, without logging in physically.\nTL;DR - The rebooting of server failed, and only logged my user out. Then server was on root mode (aka single-user mode) and had never actually rebooted. Although, when I pressed the power button and it rebooted, I was able to create a ssh session.\"\nNow, I got again physically to the server and tried to reboot it via ssh first. I noticed it fails when it tries to kill all remaining processes. I said this to my friend and he suggested me to do only \"sudo reboot\", without the now-attribute. Well, this command rebooted server successfully and I was able to make ssh connection when it had rebooted. My friend was thinking that the now-attribute is not a real attribute for reboot command but he was wondering why it's not shown as invalid attribute then. Anyhow, a normal \"sudo reboot\" rebooted the server just fine. I'd like once again thank you all for helping me out.

Here's another link.\n\nA: While jia103 gave links to a couple of pages that are a good starting point to start with installing Postfix, there are a few other important considerations that need to be addressed before you dive into setting up your own email server.\n\n\n*\n\n*Port 25 blocking: most ISP's by default have port 25 blocked. For your Postfix system to communicate with outside mail systems, it has to pass through port 25. You can usually check the help pages of your ISP to determine if they block port 25. You might get lucky and have an ISP that will un-block it for you, but not all ISP's will do this. (There are other work-arounds to port 25 being blocked, like using a Gmail account to relay through, but then all your emails will be routed outgoing from your Gmail address.) The other option, if your ISP provides it, is to upgrade to a \"business-class\" service, on which they do not block ports. You will have to decide if that service is worth the extra cost.\n\n*Domain name: if you want the vanity of having your emails using the address some_user@jochemke.com you'll need to register a domain name with a registrar and use that domain name during the server installation and setup. Really, this isn't a vanity issue - you need a fully qualified domain name for Postfix to communicate to the outside world with.\n\n*DNS Service: regardless of what method you work around Problem #1 (port 25) you will need DNS entries for your domain. Some domain registrars will also provide DNS service with your account - others don't offer it. Frankly, until you're ready to start working with BIND and configuring your own DNS server, let someone else handle it for you. Particularly if you opt to not upgrade your ISP service, you'll need a DNS service that provides dynamic DNS listing (because your public IP address is subject to change on most residential services). I use dyn.com for my DNS - there are others, so search for one that suits you - for a nominal yearly fee.\n\n*Blacklisting: if you do not go with the \"business-class\" service from your ISP, you can almost count on having outgoing email get bounced to most other domains like Gmail, Yahoo and many others, because the IP range you're on is blacklisted. This again is common for residential ISP service - usually due to infected PC's being spam sources. The work-around then is to find an outside SMTP relay service that will act as the intermediary between your server and the outside-world SMTP servers. This takes searching for one that suits your needs, and will also incur another cost for the service.\n\n\nWhile all of this may seem rather daunting and give you second-thoughts about setting up your own email server, it really isn't as difficult as my points may make it seem. Rather, knowing this before you start can save you a lot of grief once you start in and have to figure out what isn't working when you confront one of these issues.\n", "Q: Network problems in Ubuntu 12.04 I have a computer I haven't used in a while running Ubuntu 12.04\nI want to upgrade to fix the problems but I can't get a working connection.  \nDuring start up I get the message waiting for network configuration.Once started I used to be able to get online by running sudo dhclient eth0 to make my wired connection work.\nI've tested the wired connection works on another machine.\nI've tried a load of things from googling to no avail. \nPlease help.

I've got it installed on a desktop PC and I also wanted to install it in a laptop which is not mine and the owner desired to keep pre-installed win 8 along with ubuntu. Keeping that in mind I tried to create a recovery image of windows into an USB drive but, don't ask me why, it wasn't possible even though it had enough free space.\nThen I made a serious mistake. I took my internal HDD which contained a lot of important data and tried to create the image there using a usb-sata interface. It was partitioned like this: 800 gb ext4 with data, then 200 gb NTFS containing nothing. I wrongly assumed that windows would use the NTFS partition and leave the ext4 alone but it didn't, it formatted 32gb into FAT32 for the damned recovery image leaving the rest of the disk space unassigned. \nI've made a real mess, guess I got used to all the warnings that linux gives us before taking bad decisions and crappy windows took me by surprise.\nI've analysed the HDD using Testdisk. The first attempt led me nowhere since it couldn't find the ext4 partition (even through deep search). Then I took another shot this time selecting \"unpartitioned media\" instead of \"Intel\" as partition table type. Here are the results:\nDisk /dev/sdb - 1000 GB / 931 GiB - CHS 121601 255 63\nPartition ---------------- Start ---------------- End ------------------- Size in sectors\nP ext4 ------------------- 0  32 31 -------- 95493 4 61 -------- 1534093312 [Ext4]\nP FAT32 ----------------  0  32 33 ------- 4177 117 36 ------- 67108864 [NO NAME]\nP NTFS --------------- 5453  43 31 ---- 5453 141 30 --------------- 6174 [Boot]\nP FAT12 ------------ 5453 143 19 --- 5454 217 30 --------------- 20739 [NO NAME]\nP NTFS ---------------- 95493   5  1 ----  121601  57 56 ------- 419428352 [Ntfs]\nStructure: Ok.\nKeys T: change type, P: list files,\n     Enter: to continue\nEXT4 Large file Sparse superblock Backup superblock, 785 GB / 731 GiB\nThe good: the partition was found, and it is correctly labeled. The bad: when I access and try to list the files it says \"Can't open filesystem. Filesystem seems damaged\". I'm stucked at this point.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Your ext4 filesystem lost its first 32G with the FAT32partition at the beginning of the disk.  You could try to reset  the partition table to what it was originally, and see if any disk recovery tools can find anything (might work if they can find a duplicate superblock).   If that doesn't work, you can try to make the partition table have a 32G, the rest of the ext4, and the ntfses and see what the recovery tools pick out of the chopped off ext4.  Worst case, you've lost the filesystem, and just have the data, which if it's text, in theory you could use dd to copy the raw data into files, split them up into editable pieces, use the strings program to find interesting pieces, and use an editor to pull out the files you recognize.  Not a pretty scenario, but if you REALLY need something, it's possible.\n\nCertainly use the same program you originally used to set up the ext4 partition.  So your default starts will be the same and when you give it a size of 800G, the G is interpreted the same way so the size will be the same.  Now try the recovery tool on that partition.  It may well be very confused with 32G of FAT32 filesystem sitting at the begining of the ext4 filesystem, but see what it finds -- The hope is the FAT32 format was \"quick\" and you may even recovery some files which were in the first 32G.  If not much of interest is found (like just the Microsoft recovery files), try to help out the recovery tools by eliminating that FAT32 filesystem. Do that by putting it into its own, new partition.  Now the second partition starts when the FAT32 ends, but the filesystem on it has had its beginning chopped off, losing those files, but the rest of the files should be OK, just hard to access, since the filesystem is broken.  Try the recovery tool again, and hopefuylly it will find the remaining files in that broken filesystem.  Good Luck.  Backups are such a nuisance, until you have to go through the effort of recovery without them, then they don't seem so bad after all.\n", "Q: Dual Booting Samsung ATIV 9 I've been trying to install Ubuntu 13.10 on my new Samsung ATIV 9 and I'm running into some problems with the BIOS.

How can I add Boot from USB to this list?\n\nA: I had this problem too. \"USB\" does not have to (and may never) appear on the boot menu. As far as I can remember you should disable the fast boot and secure boot options on the Boot page in BIOS. (I think they are the last two items on the list).

I had previously installed the Ubuntu chromium-browser package, and now I installed the Ubuntu package pepperflashplugin-nonfree, which provides this plugin for Chromium.  Using Chromium browser, I am now able to connect to Connect server.

Its free software that practically emulates an operating system inside windows. There are options to make it emulate an OS from a bootable pen drive, or from a ISO disc image on the local hard drive. Please note that the machine will need to be fast enough.\nIf you aren't able to install software on the machine, there are portable versions available, a quick Google search turned this page: http://www.vbox.me . However I have not used this software so I cannot confirm if it works or not.\nI also though I might mention that you can create bootable pen drives with Live operating systems. This makes the machine boot from the pen drive, without messing with the machines hard drive. I know you stated that  you weren't looking for a bootable pen drive, but I thought you might want to know about live operating systems :)\n\nA: You can install Portable Virtual Box to USB that you can run from Windows.\nYou can locate your virtual machine on the hard drive or on the USB.\nIf you locate the virtual machine on the USB it will be very slow.\nhttp://www.vbox.me/\nAlso note that if Virtual Box is already installed on the computer, this can mess it up.\n", "Q: How do i mount my internal hard disk when in \"Try Ubuntu\" mode?

Well now I have Windows 8 on a USB drive and I can't uninstall Ubuntu.\n\nA: There's no need to “uninstall” Ubuntu. Just let the Windows installer erase your harddisk.\nIf for some reason Windows can't erase the disk, boot a Ubuntu live CD (or USB), start GParted and erase your disk from there (Device → Create Partition Table..., select type msdos), after doing that the Windows installer should work fine.\n\nA: Are you booting from the USB drive? If not, change your boot options in BIOS (usually esc, F10, or F12 while your computer is booting) to boot from the USB and you should be able to install Windows.\n\nA: you can not uninstall something with out a device that you used to install it, need to boot from the device that you have ubuntu installed, if you had a disk or a flash drive you need change it to boot from it, then just format the drive and you will be good for a clean install of Windows 8, hope this helps :)\n", "Q: What are the difference between maxlife and maxrenewlife in kerberos?

Later, while partitioning with \"Gparted\", when Gparted prompts for 1 MB left over space before the first Partition just allow it (This is the most Vital step.)\nBy default \"Align to MiB\" will be selected. Don't Change that. Do the rest of the partitioning normally. After you finish, to check whether the partitions are aligned properly; issue the following command on terminal:\n\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIf the output says /dev/sda1 start = 2048 and DOES NOT says \"Partition X does not start on physical sector boundary.\"  then you are good to go. \nAnother way is to use GPT partitioning scheme instead of MS-DOS. If you use GPT, then there is no special 1 MB free space allotment before the first partition is required. Gparted will make all the partitions 4k aligned by default.\nFor GPT Partitions: \n\nTo verify a partition is aligned, query it using /usr/bin/blockdev as\n  shown below, if a '0' is returned, the partition is aligned:\n\n# blockdev --getalignoff /dev/<partition>\n0\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu VirtualBox VM unable to connect to internet in office environment I have gone through a lot of links available on internet to fix the issue of Ubuntu VM unable to access internet, but I found no solution.

The solution was simple. Since the only issue was internet connectivity, I configured the proxy manually. I went to FireFox -> Edit -> Preferences. Under 'Network' tab, clicked on \"Settings\" button. Under this provided the IP address of the  proxy, which is accessible from the VM. (Ping the IP addresses of the available proxy severs on your network, before giving this IP in the proxy setting).

If you are able to browse internal websites such as intranet.abc.com but not able to browse google.com this seems to be some sort of DNS issue. \nHave you changed the types of VM adapters the hosted OS is using? I forgot which ones are listed but I believe there are three options. \nAnd your company. Is this a large company i.e. handling PHI and whatnot. Some firewalls and IDS/IPS and Nexus devices are terrible about blocking VM's from going outsite the company :( \nFeed us some more information brother. \n\nA: It may be network issue in that time. \nBut in your company they blocked the virtual machine access the internet.

First of all, next time you post here please restrict it to a single question. I'll consider this simply as a request for advice on a first experience with Ubuntu.\nIn your case my recommendation is for a USB flash drive install. It is fairly easy to do and provides you the full Ubuntu experience. I used Ubuntu this way for a while at an office where I could not install Ubuntu on the hard drive. Check out the answers to this previous question for details.\nMostly likely your laptop will be able to boot from the USB drive without issue. If that is not the case you can browse through previous question on the matter or post your own question.\nAnd enjoy Ubuntu.\n\nA: I'll give some insight, or hindsight, rather.\n1) If you're wanting to install Linux OS, but don't know which \"flavor\" or \"choice\" to use, I would recommend getting Ubuntu Desktop 13.10. It's a nice, easy transition to a Linux OS by use of a simple GUI interface (don't bother with other flavors like \"Lubuntu\" or \"Xubuntu\", you'll just get stuck easily).\n2) You can check if your computer can boot from USB by having a blank 4GB+ thumb drive, sticking it in the port, and shutting down your computer. When you turn your computer back on look for a prompt at the bottom of the screen (pay attention, it's fast) (should be a function key), saying \"Boot Options\". Press the appropriate key, and if the option for \"boot from USB\" is an option, then congrats, you can boot from a USB.\n3) Recommendations of a place to look for help: youtube.com , here askubuntu.com, etc.. Just be careful what you read, and make sure you trust something before you try it.\nSide note: When, and if, you choose to boot from USB, 2 options will be given:\na) Try Ubuntu\n -Will basically make your USB your OS\nb) Install Ubuntu\n -Will ask if you want to run ubuntu alongside your current OS (recommended), or replace current OS with Ubuntu (will delete all of your files).\nBe aware, that when you download the .iso file from ubuntu.com, and save it to your USB drive, you can't simply just \"boot from USB\". You have to make the USB drive a.. \"bootable\" USB drive. To do so, download this program from here. It's a small file, and the site should walk you through on how to set everything up.\nFrom there, the Ubuntu website will walk you through how to boot your computer up from a USB drive. Good luck, 'cause I needed this help 2 days ago, and didn't get this kind of information.

(Switching to i3-wm) I might not be understanding the core concept, in which case correct me if I'm wrong.\nUbuntu comes with two different audio rendering servers, pulse and alsa. Is Alsa an intermediary layer to pulse? Essentially I need to know which one I'm using.\nThe reason I need to know is that I am attempting to switch from unity to i3-wm. While setting up i3 I found I had no audio and came upon this thread. It specifies various options for binding my laptop volume up and down keys to their functionality and after I tinkered with a few of the options I got very scratchy audio, which is why (I assume) I need to know which I'm actually using.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses both ALSA, and PulseAudio for controlling sound input and output.\nALSA\nALSA serves as a kernel based system to connect your sound hardware to the operating system. All sound cards in your system will be controlled using drivers and card specific settings. Most of this is done under the hood with no need for users to interfere.\nIn addition ALSA offers libraries and tools to control our sound system. The tool most of us may have come across is alsamixer, a semi-graphical terminal application to control sound volume, and mute state of all cards and profiles in our system.\nWe can give out sound to our sound card simply by using ALSA without the need of PulseAudio or any other sound server.\nPulseAudio\nOn top of the ALSA base, the PulseAudio sound server provides further tools to better control our sound system. This is done with modules to define volume levels, audio card profiles, output sinks, or input sources, and more for easy access from most Ubuntu applications.\nLike ALSA, PulseAudio is also designed to run with as few user interactions as possible. Whenever we need to change volume, balance, or input/output devices, it is a PulseAudio module or application we or our application call.\nA professional alternative to PulseAudio is the JACK audio server, with more options to interact with our sound hardware and a better low latency support. Only few music production applications expect to have JACK running, which can be done in parallel to PulseAudio.\nApplication/Desktop integration\nThe Ubuntu sound system can further be controlled from applications that run from the Unity/GNOME desktop, such as a volume control applet.\nWhether any given application makes use of sound control will be up to the application's developers. Some applications will only use ALSA, some need PulseAudio, some need JACK.\nTherefore, whenever we install another desktop manager on top of Ubuntu, we may lose the desktop-specific applications to control sound, but still, ALSA and PulseAudio will run in the background for sound control.\nWe may have to install additional packages, like e.g. pavucontrol, the pulseaudio GTK-based volume control application.\nIs any of ALSA or PulseAudio running?\nBoth ALSA and PulseAudio come with command line applications to print out the state of our sound system.\n\n*\n\n*PulseAudio:\npactl list\n\n\n\n*ALSA:\naplay -l\n\nBoth will give an error if the sound system is not running. ALSA will be loaded with the kernel, PulseAudio will be started later. If this was not the case, we can start PulseAudio manually from the terminal with:\npulseaudio [options]  ## option -D starts the daemon\n\nIn case we have audio issues, I recommend reading the post written by David Henningsson on things we should not do before we go further to debug our audio issue.\n", "Q: What are the default passwords of these users: nobody, daemon, uucp, etc.?

This option disables an account by changing\n    the password to a value which matches no possible encrypted value,\n    and by setting the account expiry field to 1.\n\nHowever, if you have sudo access you can switch to these accounts with a command like this:\n$ sudo su nobody\n\nThis is because the super-user can change to any account without entering a password\n\nA: \nwhat are default password of these users : root, daemon, bin, sys, sync, games, man, lp, mail, news, uucp, nobody.\n\nYou can check the status by looking in the shadow password file (/etc/shadow) at the second field. By default these accounts are locked (the password is set to *), which disables logins.\n\nCan anyone login through ssh or ftp by these users ??\n\nNot unless you have set a password for them.\n\nA: If you would look at the password file you would see that these have a specific setting (games used as an example):\n$ more /etc/passwd|grep games\ngames:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/bin/sh\n\nThe 1st three (: is the separator):\n\n\n*\n\n*name\n\n*password. An x character indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file.\n\n*user ID (UID): 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts.\n\n\nThe password is hashed (if it starts with a $ it is encrypted).\nRegarding /etc/shadow \n\nIf the password field contains some string that is not a valid result of crypt(3), for instance ! or *, the user will not be able to use a unix password to log in (but the user may log in the system by other means).\n\n\n\nCan anyone login through ssh or ftp by these users ??\n\nNot by default. In theory you can create a user named games as an actual user or change the pwd of the user games.  \n", "Q: How can I install i3 wm on Ubuntu 13.10?

Will it support that?\nKindly reply soon!\nThanks!\n\nA: Well it would work but you won't get the best performance out of Ubuntu. I mean, if you use a 64bit Ubuntu on your 64bit machine it would perform better.\nYou wouldn't notice the difference when you're doing lite operations with your computer (such as internet browsing or media playing or so) but it would be clear when doing heavy load work (such as 3D modelling or playing some recently released game that requires powerful resources). You should notice that the 64bit performs better.\n", "Q: Set default resolution in Lubuntu How does one set the default resolution in Lubuntu 12.04. I set it using both Arandr and the default resolution setter. Both times would reset after a reboot. How do I permanently set the resolution.\nNote: I am doing this as an unprivileged user. Should I do it on my admin account?\n\nA: The solution in this page should work for you. At the bottom it shows you how to make it permanent -> Set Resolution -> \nLet me know if it works for you, I know it is for 11.10 but it should work for your current version as well.\n", "Q: How to create a clone of my OS? Today I ran into a irrecoverable problem by accidentally formatting my ubuntu drive, In future I don't want to face these kinda problems, So how can I have a clone of my OS (I mean with all the software I installed) so that if i run into a problem I can just somehow use the clone to get back my OS ? BTW in another post someone mentioned Remastersys , but their website says that the software will no longer be available.\nany related tips also might help.\n\nA: You can use default Ubuntu backup that comes with Ubuntu.

You can bind your keyboard keys to run scripts that utilize this tool.\nUsing whatever language you prefer to pipe terminal commands, you can find specific process IDs with \nps aux | grep \"process here\"\nUsing xdotool search --pid \"process ID here\" you will get back multiple window IDs for a single application. I don't know how to sort through them to find the correct one, so what you could do is have your script, iterate thought the found IDs into\nxdotool windowactivate \"window ID here\" which will bring up your window.\nFor example, my 1 key will be binded to run a script that find the process ID for \"filezilla\". Then it will find the window IDs with xdotool, take those IDs and then pass them through xdotool to pull up the window. The 2 key, could be \"google-chrome\" \n\nA: I've put together what Mr.Lee suggested and created this script:\n#!/bin/bash                                                                     \n\nAPP=$1                                                                          \nif [ -z \"$APP\" ]; then                                                          \n  echo Usage: $0 EXECUTABLE_NAME                                                \n  exit 1                                                                        \nfi                                                                              \n\nPID=$(pgrep -f $APP | head -n 1)                                                \nif [ -z \"$PID\" ]; then                                                          \n  echo $APP executable not found                                                \n  exit 2                                                                        \nfi                                                                              \n\nfor WINDOW_ID in $(xdotool search --pid $PID); do                               \n  xdotool windowactivate $WINDOW_ID                                             \ndone                                                                            \n\nnotify-send \"Switched to $APP (PID=$PID)\" \n\nIt basically ignores the possibility of any error, but works for me.\n", "Q: How do I use MAAS and Juju with an existing DHCP server? I found some information about installing ubuntu with MaaS and JuJu, and I would like to try it out however I am not finding any information on how to take in to account a DHCP server already in the network. \nI need to be able to configure this to use the existing DHCP as it is on a router that is already working. Is this possible? I did find some information about it and how to configure it but it was for ISC DHCP Server. I am not sure how it will apply in this situation. But it appears that the DHCP and DNS Server work in tandem in order for MaaS and JuJu to work properly. \nDoes anyone know of any documentation or information I can use to work with my current DHCP Server.\n\nA: You may refer to Manual DHCP configuration in the following link \n\n\n*\n\n*https://docs.maas.io/2.1/en/installconfig-network-dhcp#external-dhcp-and-a-reserved-ip-range\nThere is also a nice document by DELL (Deploying workloads with Juju and MAAS) where you can find a section for using an existing DNS/DHCP server and you can find it here \n\n\n*\n\n*http://linux.dell.com/files/whitepapers/Deploying_Workloads_With_Juju_And_MAAS.pdf\n\nA: I don't know about Juju, and I'm just learning MaaS, but I did a stock MaaS install (from the snap) on a machine with a pre-existing DHCP server.\nI just turned off the machine's TFTP server and let MaaS's rackd handle TFTP service for me.

I have a problam with formating my Ubuntu partition. I installed Ubuntu yesterday, after the succesful instalation i noticed that i have lost every data on my disk. Today I try to reinstall windows but i have no partition where i can reinstall it. I cannot format tha partition with Ubuntu and I dont know why... When i was installing ubuntu i choosed to install it on LVM or something like this, I think that this fact have caused my problems.\nPS: Sorry for my bad english \n\nA: You have formatted you partition as ext4 while installing Ubuntu and Windows do not recognize ext4 format . So it is not showing when you try to install Windows.\nAlso you have single partition and your ubuntu is installed on that partition. So you can not resize that partition when Ubuntu is running.\nTry to boot with ubuntu in live mode .

After investigating the symbolic links in Windows, I got their \"real\" paths and mounted those instead.\n\nA: I was using a wrong URL. It should have been: //user.my-backup.com/backup\n\nA: You can add the version information for SMB to solve the issue. What i did is i added vers=1.0. This is SMB version 1 which works with all the smb drivers. For your case it will look something like this\nsudo mount -t cifs //user.my-backup.com /mnt/wal_drive -o iocharset=utf8,rw,vers=1.0,credentials=/etc/backupcredentials.txt,uid=postgres,gid=postgre ,file_mode=0660,dir_mode=0770\n\n\nA: Another possible cause is the presence of sec=ntlm in /etc/fstab and it's incompatibility with newer SMB protocols like SMB3. \nWhile not the OP's case, this can also cause mount error(22): Invalid argument errors, as it did for me after upgrading an old server.\nEven though kern.log includes a suggestion to specify vers=1.0 on mount, it may be safer to remove or change sec=ntlm instead. Perhaps use the defaults to allow automatic negotiation of the SMB version and security, or specify compatible options such as vers=3.0,sec=ntlmssp.\nObviously this depends on your SMB server's features, but I would try and avoid vers=1.0 unless necessary.\n\nA: I had the same issue on Arch Linux, with this message in log:\nkernel: CIFS VFS: cifs_mount failed w/return code = -22\n\nFor me the solution was to specify older version of cifs (by default it was 3.0):\n/etc/fstab:\n//my-router/share /media/share cifs ver=\"2.1\",rw,soft,uid=ele,gid=ele,file_mode=0770,dir_mode=0770,credentials=/etc/router-credentials.conf 0 0\n\n\nA: After upgrading to Jessie Debian the package must have changed.\nI removed guid=0 from the following fstab mount and it all worked correct again.\n//x.x.x.x/General/  /usr/local/share/general cifs uid=0,guid=0,rw,credentials=/etc/gen-cifspasswd 0 0\n\n\nA: I am on CentOS I know this is Ubuntu but bear with me, this still comes top on google.

By means of the BIOS the machine starts by the disk before the hard disk. Then, actually, when starting the computer appears a GRUB and anybody can choose either Ubuntu or Windows 7. Certainly Ubuntu was upgraded into 13.10.\nFrom www.ubuntu.cat I roughly did the same procedure but in Windows 7 I may select Windows or Ubuntu (wubi).\nAt this point I would like to remove the first Ubuntu.\nHow to do this?\n\nA: Don't worry, follow my instructions.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I suggest you to remove Ubuntu (Wubi) and not the real Ubuntu installation, because the real Ubuntu installation will always be faster: Ubuntu (Wubi) is installed as a Windows software and can be removed like any Windows application, from the Control Panel (if you remove Wubi you will lose any data saved in the Wubi virtual partition).\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: To remove permanently the real Ubuntu installation with all its data, enter in the Ubuntu (Wubi) installation and with a partition software like gParted delete the real Ubuntu partition; you can also use a live DVD/CD with any distro installed to do the procedure.\nYou can execute Gparted Partition Editor from System -> Administration in Ubuntu systems or use the apposite gParted live CD (a safer alternative) by following this official guide (CLICK!).\nAfter that reboot and test your in-use systems at least two times.\nSUGGESTION: If you format the deleted partition's space with NTFS you'll be able to re-use it in both Windows & Linux (Linux will need extra support drivers & wrappers).\nClick the up arrow if I'm of any help and feel free to comment down here if you need more help,\nhave a nice day. :-)\n", "Q: Creating executable file with password included in a script How can I execute a sudo command by double clicking an icon ( password should be part of the script). Please help! Excuse if question is a blunder. My gnome-ppp is not detecting my BSNL modem when I run w/o sudo command. I would like to make a executable file for the sudo command sudo gnome-ppp. \n\nA: Instead of hard-coding the password (which is completely insecure, and breaks if you ever change it), you should edit the sudoers file and allow sudo gnome-ppp to be run without a password:\nFirst, check if you're in the adm user group:\ngroups\n\nThis should give you a list of your groups; I chose adm, because that includes users who can administer the system. It may be admin in your case; adjust accordingly.\nNow find where gnome-ppp lives:\nwhich gnome-ppp\n\nThis will give you the full path; in my case, it's /usr/bin/gnome-ppp\nsudo visudo\n\nand add the line at the bottom:\n%adm ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/gnome-ppp\n\nSave the file; now when you call sudo gnome-ppp, you will not be prompted for a password.\n", "Q: Getting MTP-enabled Moto G to work with Ubuntu 12.04 I'm not allowed to comment, so I can't ask why my MotoG phone won't connect with my Ubuntu 12.04 64bit desktop. I've installed Phillip Langdale's ppa & packages for gvfs MTP backend. It didn't pickup my phone when connected by USB. So I followed the advice (given by @Glutanimate) in:\nGetting MTP enabled devices to work with Ubuntu?\ni.e. I downloaded & installed the referred-to mtp packages. Still no success. Ideas please.\n\nA: The way you can automount your gadget is installing gvfs, using Synaptic package manager, or any other. Most of the made-in-china stuff use the MTP protocol, so you can mount it by installing the add-in supporting that. Try this:\n$ sudo apt-get install gvfs [press enter key, enter sysadmin pwd and enter]\n\n\nA: A few days ago I've got a similar situation in Elive Linux and a Garmin Vivoactive 3. This is my solution (not working for newer Sony Xperia phones so far, but I think you could get lucky with a MotoG):\nAndroid moved from USB Mass storage to MTP (Media Transfer Protocol). MTP is a successor of PTP, what is used mostly for picture transfer from digital cameras to pc/laptop.\nWith USB Mass Storage you’ll need to mount the filesystem in your operating system. Since the most filesystems are not very great at concurrent read/write operations, you’d need to umount the filesystem from your digicam, mobile phone or other embedded device. With MTP as protocol (interface) you can access files on the device without the umount/mount orgies.\nTo use MTP on elive, I’ll suggest to install the packages jmtpfs and mtp-tools.\n~>>> sudo apt-get install jmtpfs mtp-tools\n\nConnect your mobile phone via USB and run mtp-detect.\nIn case of a Sony Xperia X, the phone needs to be unlocked (home screen). Else the output is something like:\n~ ❯❯❯ mtp-detect\nlibmtp version: 1.1.3\n\nListing raw device(s)\nDevice 0 (VID=0fce and PID=01e0) is UNKNOWN.\nPlease report this VID/PID and the device model to the libmtp development team\n   Found 1 device(s):\n   0fce:01e0 @ bus 5, dev 4\n[...]\nusb_clear_halt() on INTERRUPT endpoint: No such device\nusb_open(): No such file or directory\nLIBMTP PANIC: Could not init USB on second attempt\nUnable to open raw device 0\nOK.\n\nIf the screen got locked after one connect, it’s no problem. The unlocked screen shows something like:\n~ ❯❯❯ mtp-detect\nlibmtp version: 1.1.3\n\nListing raw device(s)\nDevice 0 (VID=0fce and PID=01e0) is UNKNOWN.\nPlease report this VID/PID and the device model to the libmtp development team\n   Found 1 device(s):\n   0fce:01e0 @ bus 5, dev 5\nAttempting to connect device(s)\nAndroid device detected, assigning default bug flags\n[.. a lot of lines ..]\nMTP-specific device properties:\n   Friendly name: Xperia X\n   Synchronization partner: (NULL)\n   Battery level 58 of 100 (58%)\nlibmtp supported (playable) filetypes:\n   Audio Video Interleave\n   Folder\n   Text file\n   HTML file\n   RIFF WAVE file\n   ISO MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3\n   JPEG file\n   BMP bitmap file\n[...]\n   Abstract Playlist file\n   XML file\n   Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nOK.\n\nNow you’ll need a writable directory. /mnt/tmp doesn’t work, so I’m using a directory in home.\n>>> mkdir -p ~/android/\n>>> jmtpfs ~/android/\n\n[.. now do what you want, using a shell or a filemanager ..]\n>>> fusermount -u ~/android/\n\n(alternative 'sudo umount /home/[user]/android', see 'mount')\nIt is also helpful to use the ‘Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music’, that is using MTP to transfer Music via MTP\n", "Q: How can System Monitor display disk io? I can't imagine this is not possible.... but I can't figure out where to enable it. \ncan't system monitor (gnome-system-monitor) display disk io? \n\nA: You can use system monitor from KDE (ksysguard), open it, go to file and click on \"download new tabs\" then, you can download disc io.\nAnyway, lots of tools let you watch disc IO, for example gnome-shell plugins, Unity indicators, KDE plasmoids or conky.\n\nA: I gave up on gnome-system-monitor for this reason.\nOn my 12.04 machines I installed indicator-multiload.

So please look upon any errors likely to occur in my question.\nSo, I had Ubuntu 12.10 running alongside Windows 7 (which is the default OS). A few months back I tried     do-release-upgrade and before it finished, I aborted it. \n2 days ago I ran sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade since Software Updater kept saying \n\n\"not all updates can be installed\".\n\nSo when upgrading finished, I rebooted my computer and got a total blank screen after logging in. I tried everything I could find on the net (uninstalling and then installing lightdm again seemed somewhat to work, at least the screen wasn't black anymore). But what came wasn't much of an improvement. The dash was gone, along with the top bar. It was a total wallpaper, the whole screen. Hitting ctrl+alt+F1 brought the terminal and that was the only thing that worked correctly. With that I  installed CompizConfig Settings Manager and after a lot of fooling around managed to get the dash back, but no top panel. But it was nothing near right.

After installing TeamViewer x86 on Ubuntu, it will not start automatically on boot, even when telling it to do so via the application settings (\"Start TeamViewer with system\"). How do I make sure TeamViewer starts with the system, before even logging in?\n\nA: TeamViewer provides a script called teamviewerd.sysv available in /opt/teamviewer/tv_bin/script. Here's an excerpt:\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# /etc/init.d/teamviewerd\n#\n# chkconfig: 2345 95 05\n# description: daemon for TeamViewer\n#\n# processname: teamviewerd\n# config: /etc/teamviewer/global.conf\n# pidfile: /var/run/teamviewerd.pid\n\n### BEGIN INIT INFO\n# Provides:          teamviewerd\n# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5\n# Default-Stop:      0 1 6\n# Required-Start:    $all\n# Required-Stop:     $local_fs $network $named\n# Short-Description: TeamViewer remote control daemon\n# Description:       TeamViewer remote control daemon\n### END INIT INFO\n\nAll you need to do is make sure this script runs on startup. Making sure of this is relatively simple, just copy it to /etc/init.d like so:\ncd /opt/teamviewer/tv_bin/script\nsudo cp teamviewerd.sysv /etc/init.d/\n\nDon't forget to make the script non-writable to anyone but the owner!\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/teamviewerd.sysv\n\nThen run\nsudo update-rc.d teamviewerd.sysv defaults\n\nThe service will now start automatically with each boot. If you don't feel like rebooting, you can start the service manually with:\nsudo service teamviewerd.sysv start\n\n2019 EDIT: This answer was written in 2013. Since then, systemd has arrived in force and is normally used for constructing services that start upon boot. For instructions on how to achieve this in systemd instead, please see this question: How do I run a single command at startup using systemd?\n\nA: I was using Teamviewer version 9 and there is option Start TeamViewer with system.

The partitions of that hard drive are all in ntfs format, is there a tool or a way to repair it under Ubuntu?\n\nA: Firstly, before doing anything else, I would check the extent of the damage done to the hard drive since that will in part determine the next step. Check the SMART data through Disk Utility (palimpsest from a terminal). In Disk Utility, select the drive in question and click the \"SMART Data\" button to view information about the number of disk errors that have been reported.\nTake careful note of the \"Reallocated Sector Count\" and especially the \"Uncorrectable Sector Count\". Either any amount of uncorrectable sectors, or an excessive amount of reallocated sectors, is an immediate red flag that you should back up your data and replace the drive.\nIf you see signs of damage at this point but decide to proceed in making alterations to the filesystems anyway, you are doing so at your own risk!\n\nYou have a couple options to try to fix corrupt ntfs volumes: \nIn my experience, using Windows chkdsk is usually the best option, since ntfs is inherently a part of the Windows world, and Linux tools that operate on it are just reverse-engineered solutions. This of course requires that you have a bootable Windows installation on the disk already.\nEquivalently, you can run ntfsfix from Ubuntu which will mark the partition in question as 'dirty' so that Windows will automatically run chkdsk on it the next time it's booted. Take note that ntfsfix is not a Linux replacement for chkdsk, as stated in the ntfsfix manual.\nIf you can't run chkdsk, you may want to try reading up on and running testdisk, a powerful data recovery tool that can fix inaccessible ntfs partitions and make various repairs, but it depends on exactly what kinds of symptoms (if any) you're currently seeing.\nAgain, if you suspect the integrity of your data is in question you shouldn't hesitate to back up your drive before proceeding, since any further writes may make the problem worse, especially if there's physical damage.\n", "Q: Appmenu with QML App I'm developing an Ubuntu SDK meant to be used on both the desktop and touch interfaces.

But when I make a shell script with those commands it only makes a named pipe. Its not making it open for reading and writing.\nAnyone know a solution?\n\nA: I can not completely see what you want to do, like using it in one or in multiple scripts - but I have an idea what went wrong:\nTo me, it looks like you were trying to combine two things, and combibing them got you in trouble:\nSmells like deadlock\nOpening a file on an extra file descriptor of the current shell:\n$ exec 3<>file\n\nAnd using a fifo special file:\n$ mkfifo fifo\n$ exec 3> fifo\n\nAnd then, you tried to use them in a way that created a dead lock, for example waiting to finish writing, while you plan to read the data later - but never will get so far.\nBoth are powerful tools, but they are tricky to use together in a single shell script.\n\nExamples\nHere's the relevant example section from\nBash One-Liners Explained, Part III: All about redirections.  \nNote how thwo independent scripts are used in section 13 when working with the fifo:\n\n\n  \n*Open a file both for writing and reading\n$ exec 3<>file\n\nHere we use bash's diamond operator <>. The diamond operator opens a\n  file descriptor for both reading and writing.\nSo for example, if you do this:\n$ echo \"foo bar\" > file   # write string \"foo bar\" to file \"file\".\n$ exec 5<> file           # open \"file\" for rw and assign it fd 5.\n$ read -n 3 var <&5       # read the first 3 characters from fd 5.\n$ echo $var\n\nThis will output foo as we just read the first 3 chars from the file.\nNow we can write some stuff to the file:\n$ echo -n + >&5           # write \"+\" at 4th position.\n$ exec 5>&-               # close fd 5.\n$ cat file\n\nThis will output foo+bar as we wrote the + char at 4th position in the\n  file.\n\n  \n*Send the output from multiple commands to a file\n$ (command1; command2) >file\n\nThis one-liner uses the (commands) construct that runs the commands a\n  sub-shell. A sub-shell is a child process launched by the current\n  shell.\nSo what happens here is the commands command1 and command2 get\n  executed in the sub-shell, and bash redirects their output to file.\n\n  \n*Execute commands in a shell through a file\n  \n  \n  Open two shells. In shell 1 do this:\nmkfifo fifo\nexec < fifo\n\nIn shell 2 do this:\nexec 3> fifo;\necho 'echo test' >&3\n\n[ ... ]\n\n\nA: If you make the script executable and run it like any other program, it is run in a new shell, so the pipe is opened in that shell, and then it exits, returning to your interactive shell that has not been affected.  To have your shell interpret the script instead of executing a new shell to do it, you need to tell your current shell to open the file and interpret its contents using the source command.  You can also use the shortcut ., as in . myscript.sh.\n", "Q: Can an infected DVD+RW affect a Linux PC? Yesterday I started my laptop (using a sudoer user because I wanted to install one program) with an infected DVD + RW inside my laptop (it was recorded using aother computer that is infected and I guess it might be infected). The DVD was automatically mounted\nAs soon as I realized the DVD was mounted I unmount it and remove it from my laptop (No file in that DVD was opened), and then I reboot the laptop.\nI guess that it is not possible to infect a Linux PC if you don't run any file as root (or using sudo) ,and I did not use that command before unmounting the DVD, but as I said I started my laptop using a sudoer user, and so I entered my sudo password when I logged in.\nThe questions are: Can I infect a Linux PC by accidentally automounting an infected DVD while I am registered as a sudoer user?, in case I wanted to check if the PC was infected,  which changes should I check? (I had a look at /var/logs/apt, /usr/bin and /usr/lib and no files were modified whle the DVD was mounted). When I entered the user password in the log in screen, was the DVD already monted, or the system mounts the DVD after log in?\nThanks.\nPS: I know this question might seem a bit paranoid, but it has never been asked nor answered  so I think it is an interesting question to ask\n\nA: It's not really possible, but to be sure you can boot from a live CD and from there use chkrootkit and clamav to check for infections.\nIn general, never log in as root! Just don't. It's dangerous and completely unnecessary. Whatever you want to do, almost everything can be done via sudo. There's a reason you can't log in as root per default, and there's a reason that sudo exists.\n\nA: *\n\n*Don't worry, for security reasons Linux systems doesn't support the Autorun feature and mounting a partition (like the Joliet\nones) also should not execute any code if you didn't install specific\ndaemons to do so, so you're relatively safe.\nLinux Ubuntu will be safe and secure as long as you keep it updated with the security updates and access the root privileges only with sudo.\n\n*Remember that Windows malware can't be executed in Linux: you can use Ubuntu to detect and destroy any type of Windows malware, specially in mobile drivers.\n\n*If you want to check for infected or not regular software use directly a rootkit scanner and the ClamAV antivirus: the reason is that by checking manually you can be fooled to execute harmful code by a rootkit+trojan horse combination, if you are infected by Unix/Linux malware. Simply use the apposite softwares and let them do their job.\n\nHave a nice experience, please comment down here if you have any doubt and click the UP arrow if I'm of any help.\n\nA: Unlike Windows, which automatically thinks 'I'll run this, it will all be OK', Linux is generally less bad at that sort of thing - only really if you intentionally do something daft will anything bad really happen.\nThis depends also what was on the DVD, but even if it had a program that could quite happily infect the entire system, it would still need to be executed / told to run. Mounting the DVD would probably not be enough. Even then, programs such as SELinux, ClamAV should hopefully notify you of any problems.\nBut, there would be no harm in checking the system for security flaws or problems.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server with btrfs root and confusion with the @ symbol in subvolume path Please note the following commands:\nuser@ubuntu:~$ sudo btrfs subvolume create /srv/audio\nCreate subvolume '/srv/audio'\nuser@ubuntu:~$ sudo btrfs fi show\nLabel: 'BTRFS_STORAGE'  uuid: 0042d7c1-6850-42d2-9de8-3d408642b397\n    Total devices 3 FS bytes used 886.08GB\n    devid    1 size 931.51GB used 478.00GB path /dev/sdd\n    devid    3 size 1.82TB used 955.03GB path /dev/sde\n    devid    2 size 931.51GB used 477.03GB path /dev/sdc\n\nLabel: 'home'  uuid: 5a869b17-5d30-462f-9abb-7095532a1994\n    Total devices 3 FS bytes used 3.70GB\n    devid    1 size 27.33GB used 0.00 path /dev/dm-1\n    devid    2 size 111.79GB used 5.03GB path /dev/sdb\n    devid    3 size 59.63GB used 1.03GB path /dev/sda\nBtrfs v0.20-rc1\nuser@ubuntu:~$ sudo btrfs subvolume list /\nID 256 gen 17101 top level 5 path @\nID 258 gen 17064 top level 5 path @home\nID 261 gen 17079 top level 5 path @apt-snapshot-release-upgrade-saucy-2013-10-20_11:17:04\nID 269 gen 17100 top level 256 path srv/audio\nuser@ubuntu:~$ \n\nSo, this is my first fresh installation with a btrfs root, ive used btrfs in the past with an ext4 root with mounted btrfs disks.\nIts obvious that they are subvolumes of some sort, but I am unfamiliar with the \"@\" symbols in the pathname. What does it signify?\n\nA: When you install Ubuntu on btrfs partition, the system automatically creates the @ and @home subvolumes. If it didn't it would be much more difficult to take advantage of backups of the whole system with snapshots. You can also use them to install more then one system on a single BTRFS partition: see also my answer to Can I have two distros on the same partition using btrfs?\nI have no idea, why the Ubuntu team did chose names @ and @home for these subvolumes. Maybe so they can stand out and will not be confused easily with directories?

Then I try to look for which linked shared libraries the error popped. That was the libdjvulibre library ... Removing the -ldjvulibre from the command line had the conftest.cpp compiled again without errors:\n$ g++ -o conftest -O3 -g3 -pthread -DMAGICKCORE_HDRI_ENABLE=1 -DMAGICKCORE_QUANTUM_DEPTH=16 conftest.cpp -lfpx -lfftw3 -lz -lXext -lXt -lSM -lICE -lX11 -lbz2 -lgomp -lm\n\ngives me an object file conftest.\nI did check on the package implementing this djvulibre shared library : It's the Official Ubuntu package for Raring 13.04: Package name is libdjvulibre21 and version is 3.5.25.3-3 .\nObviouly this is a bug in the ImageMagick configure file.\n", "Q: How to create EFI partition and install grub2 on second disk I have two disks, one Win 8 and one Ubuntu. \nWhen manually partitioning the 2nd disk during the Ubuntu install, I installed the bootloader to the MBR instead of creating an EFI boot partition. So now I can't use my 2nd disk as the primary boot drive - it just goes straight to Windows.\nHow can I create an EFI partition on my Ubuntu drive and get grub on there? Is this something Boot-repair can do? Which options would I use?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You've got a mixed-mode install, with Windows in EFI/UEFI mode and Linux in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. This type of setup is difficult to get (much less keep) running. You have several options for how to proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a Linux EFI boot loader/manager to the existing EFI System Partition (ESP) on the Windows disk. It should then be able to boot your existing Linux installation in EFI mode from the MBR disk. In principle, this is likely to be the easiest solution, but it requires either something easy to install or enough knowledge to not make a mistake when installing it. It also doesn't meet your criterion of not modifying any partition on the Windows disk; although it would not modify Windows itself, it would necessarily modify the ESP. The Boot Repair tool might set this up correctly if it's booted in EFI mode. rEFInd is also relatively easy to set up (I'd do it from Windows, but you'll need to add an EFI filesystem driver for whatever filesystem holds your Linux kernel -- probably ext4fs).\n\n*Free about 550MiB on the MBR disk, create an ESP on it, and install a Linux boot loader to it. The trouble is that some EFIs won't boot from an MBR disk, although many will. Some boot loader installation tools might also bypass an MBR disk (I have no idea if Boot Repair would work, for instance; and the Windows rEFInd installation instructions will probably end up putting rEFInd on the GPT disk.) This could also create problems if/when you upgrade or re-install Ubuntu, since the Ubuntu installer requires GPT for an EFI-mode installation.\n\n*Do as in the previous option, but convert the disk from MBR to GPT format by using GPT fdisk (gdisk, sgdisk, or cgdisk), which is part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu. This makes it more likely to work and be less likely to cause problems in the future, but it's an extra step and it's not 100% risk-free.\n\n*Re-install Ubuntu in EFI mode. Getting the installer to boot in EFI mode can be a challenge, because the boot mode is determined by the firmware and there's little standardization in how it's controlled. In general, though, an option to boot a CD/DVD or USB flash drive that includes the string \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\" will get the job done. Also, some ways of creating USB flash drives from installation images don't copy over the EFI boot files. You're best off just copying the image with dd, in my experience. Note also that you may have to be very careful with the installer to tell it to use the ESP on the Linux disk to hold the Linux boot loader; it might try to use the ESP on the Windows disk.\n\n\nA fair amount more could be written about any of these options, so if you want to pursue one of them and have questions, ask. Please read my page on EFI-mode installations and/or the Ubuntu community wiki on the subject first, though.\n", "Q: Virtualising ubuntu-server on ubuntu using qemu I successfully created an qemu image containing ubuntu-server.

If you are using bash the system-wide per-interactive-shell startup file is /etc/bash.bashrc and user-level per-interactive-shell startup file is ~/.bashrc.\nThe problem you are facing may be due to presence of any bad instruction(s) in any of these two files.\nFrom OP's reply:\n\nsourcing ~/.bashrc initiate the problem. That means there is problem with ~/.bashrc \n\nPossible reasons of disappearing bash prompt:\nThere might be recursive sourcing that can create an infinite loop type situation. For example if there are lines present in your ~/.bashrc like,\nif [ -f ~/.profile ]; then\n   . ~/.profile\nfi\n\nIt will source ~/.profile. But keep in mind that ~/.profile always sources ~/.bashrc (it is correct way). Hence you are in an infinite loop. Do not source ~/.profile from ~/.bashrc\nUnder such situation you can not get the prompt unless you hit Ctrl+C\nTroubleshooting\nYou can put a line in your ~/.bashrc\nset -x\n\nThen you could see that the file descriptor is stopping when you open a terminal.\nHow to recover\nTake backup of ~/.bashrc and get a new one from /etc/skel. Use in terminal,\nmv ~/.bashrc ~/bashrc.bkp\ncp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/\n\nIt will replace your ~/.bashrc with a new one.\nEither the problem is like as I expected (described above) or something else should be solved after replacing ~/.bashrc as it is solely related to your ~/.bashrc.\n\nA: Running this command has solved this problem for me:\nreset\n\n\nA: Likely, the shell prompt has been accidentally customized to be blank.\nIn a terminal window, do:\nsudo cp /etc/bashrc /etc/bashrc.sav\nsudo nano /etc/bashrc\n\nThen change PS1 to become:\nPS1=\"[\\u@\\h:\\w ] $ \"\n\nSave,  and exit.\nThe folowing command will show the bashrc files - what do you have?\nls -al /etc/ba* \n\n\nA: I was having the issue of non-running, locked lxterminal and a mere $ for the xterm prompt.\nI found on my old N600C running Lubuntu 14.04 updated to 16.04, that echo $0 told me I was running /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash.\nAfter that it was just an issue of changing the default shell to /bin/bash in the way that I saw fit for my installation.\nThere are several ways to do that; they're outside the scope of the OP problem, though.\nWhen I changed back to /bin/bash, it fixed xterm as well as lxterminal, now both show user, host, and pwd.\n", "Q: How to combine two enviroment variables into one command?

So to block http://youtube.com/..., you only want to specify youtube.com because that is the host.\nNote that YouTube actually uses www.youtube.com (with the www) and that is considered a different hostname so you'd have to block that too.\nThe final thing to note is that this just blocks your ability for your DNS system to be able to look up YouTube by its hostname.  It is not securely blocking YouTube, as users may be able to look up its IP addresses some other way.

I operate a server that had 10TB of space, and while / is mounted on a partition that has a bulk of the space, /boot is mounted on a smaller partition the installer automatically created that is just 229M for my environment.\n@Anees You can reduce the size of / and then increase the size of /boot , but given the risks and potential need to turn off the machine ( might not be that easy to do if it's a server ) , in all likelyhood, you'll probably find cleaning up some of the older versions of the kernel you have installed to do the trick with significantly less risk. IE in my environment, in which we do regular updates, I had files from July 27, 2012 for 3.2.0-29 and in upwards of a dozen for everything in between up to 3.2.0-61.

The upload is the same across\n  all computers and Operating Systems. In Ubuntu the machine in question\n  gets 80mbps via hardwired connection - the same as Windows. So it is\n  only wireless download speed on Ubuntu.

If not, I have a few suggestions for you.\nFirst - If you haven't already, update Ubuntu.\n\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf that doesn't help, this guy had a problem with Unity, which was fixed by renaming the compiz config folder here: /home/username/.config/compiz-1\n\n\n*\n\n*You will have to restart your PC after you do this. If Unity doesn't start you will have to start it up manually. \n\n*If that doesn't work you can reset Unity.\nTo Reset Unity and Compiz\n\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/  \n\n\n\n*And if that doesn't work you can restart Unity.\nTo Reset Unity and Compiz\n\nsetsid unity\n\nIf Unity is still failing you, you can try your luck with GNOME 3.10\nA full installation guide can be found here.\nIf all else fails, you can format your HDD again and do a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.10. If you used a Live CD the first time I suggest you burn a new copy in case your files were corrupted during the first burn. Good luck.\n", "Q: ppa for GHC 7.6 I was wondering if there is some decently trusted PPA of GHC 7.6? Preferably the newest.\nI want a decently recent Haskell platform without having to build from source. I am not experienced enough with Linux to want to bother with my own installations of important software, which would probably be unstructured and ad-hoc. Isn't that what package managers are for, after all?\n\nA: Here is PPA with different GHC versions. They are intended to be installed side by side with default Ubuntu's ghc package:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~hvr/+archive/ghc\n", "Q: 'file --mime-type' vs 'mimetype' for php files I'm trying to understand the difference between file --mime-type and mimetype.  They are giving me different results on Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS for this simple php file.\n<?php\n  echo 'Hello world!';\n?>\n\nNow when I use mimetype and file to get the type of the file, I get:\n$ mimetype -b test.php\napplication/x-php\n\n$ file -b --mime-type test.php\ntest/x-php\n\nThis question ('file --mime-type' and 'mimetype' Commands Returning Different Results) says that file uses /etc/mime.types however:\n$ grep php /etc/mime.types\napplication/x-httpd-php                         phtml pht php\napplication/x-httpd-php-source                  phps\napplication/x-httpd-php3                        php3\napplication/x-httpd-php3-preprocessed           php3p\napplication/x-httpd-php4                        php4\napplication/x-httpd-php5                        php5\n\nI'm most curious about why file sees it as a text file.  This is causing me problems in Rails as Ruby's MIME type also sees it as type application.\n\nA: According to the manpage file doesn't use /etc/mime.types but the compiled definitions from /usr/share/misc/magic.mgc, the  plain text definitions from /etc/magic and some other files.\nYou can get the source code for /usr/share/misc/magic.mgc from the source code of the file package (have a look into the magic/ subfolder).\nIf you want file to return application/x-php add the following to /etc/magic:\n# PHP scripts\n# Ulf Harnhammar <ulfh@update.uu.se>\n0       search/1/c      =<?php                  PHP script text\n!:mime  application/x-php\n0       search/1        =<?\\n                   PHP script text\n!:mime  application/x-php\n0       search/1        =<?\\r                   PHP script text\n!:mime  application/x-php\n0       search/1/w      #!\\ /usr/local/bin/php  PHP script text executable\n!:mime  application/x-php\n0       search/1/w      #!\\ /usr/bin/php        PHP script text executable\n!:mime  application/x-php\n# Smarty compiled template, http://www.smarty.net/\n# Elan Ruusamäe <glen@delfi.ee>\n0       string  =<?php\\ /*\\ Smarty\\ version     Smarty compiled template\n>24     regex   [0-9.]+                         \\b, version %s\n!:mime  application/x-php\n\n", "Q: Image of Hard Drive for replication to laboratory computers We have a laboratory of 100 systems where the same set of software is to be installed. Some of the systems may have different capacities of HDDs (i.e. 320 GB, 500 GB, 1 TB). \nI have the following question regarding this (command specific answers required): \n\n\n*\n\n*What process is to be taken to create the image of the HDD's? \n\n*Can that image be used to create a network based booting system? If yes, what are the network requirements?\n\n*Do the sizes of the HDD have to be same for creating and cloning the systems?\n\n\nA: Question #1 = You will need to pick a backup/restore tool. Sector based tools like \"Clonezilla\" will create an image that is larger but it will not require any additional steps for deployment because it can have the bootloader information included in the image. Just backup, restore to the new system, and boot it up. However in order to deploy a sector based image most programs will require you to have an equal too or larger disk than what the image was made from. You can get around this by creating partition only backups, but then your mbr or efi loaders may not be imaged depending on what tool you use. Alternatively you can use a file based backup tool like \"squashfs-tools\" the image will be small and faster to make, but you will need to install grub afterwards through the aid of a livecd.\nQuestion #2 = I'll leave that to someone else to answer.\nQuestion #3 = The sizes only need to be the same or greater if you are using a full hard drive sector based image. If you are using a partition sector based image the partition will need to be the same size or greater. If you are using a file based image then you only need enough free space to fit the data.\nThe easiest way would be to setup the machine that has the smallest hard drive, create a sector based hard drive image using clonezilla, and then deploy to the larger machines.\n\nA: Ummm, if I were presented by this particular problem, I would google on how to use a network bootloader to load a boot image off a networked drive, to then have the machines boot over the network.\nAs for the requirements, you will need standard LAN cards, Cat5 or Cat5e cable, a high speed switch at each floor node (assuming you have a server room located somewhere in the building), you will need a set of instructions on BIOS settings as you will likey have a mix of BIOS types and versions, you may need to flash a few with the latest or last BIOS images.\nAll this is available by googling it.\n", "Q: How to deleting files depending on their usage? How can I use a script in order to delete files according to how much I using them?\nThere are a large amount of files under a directory. I would like to preserve such files which I use (open) very often. I would like to delete those, which I did not use in a certain period. \n\nA: You'll want to use the timestamp property on the files in question. I'd recommend writing a simple script in bash something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor i in `ls -1 *.log`\n  do\n    myfile=`ls -l $i | awk '{print $6,$7,$9}'`\n    if [[ ${myfile% *} = 'Jan 1' ]];\n    then\n      echo \"Removing ${myfile##* }\"\n      #rm ${myfile##* }\n    else\n      echo \"Failed to remove file ${myfile##* }\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nGive it a try. If this script gives you what you're looking for, then just remove the \"#\" character in front of the RM command to perform the deletion operation.\n\nA: You can use the following command to delete the files that were last modified 7 or more days back.\nfind <directory path> -ctime +7 -delete\n\n", "Q: SDHC vs SDXC cards for Linux I recently bought a Zenbook prime of 128GB and I bought a microSD to SD adapter for macbook air (because of the low profile). It's working great with my SDHC that I had on the phone. I'm thinking about buying this microSD card. However, is SDXC supported in Linux? and is SDHC fully supported? Now I know it just works, but which one is preferred for Linux?\nThe speed is not that important since it's mainly for music, documents and pictures (programs and videos will be in the main SSD).\nAs we're on it, would higher capacity, like 128GB micro SDXC make any difference? If I buy any of them, I will write about them here, but I wanted to know if anyone had experience on microSDXC or read any review on these cards. I couldn't find anything relevant about Linux/Ubuntu.\nAccording to Sandisk website, the differences are:\n\n\n*\n\n*SDHC capacities range from 4GB to 32GB\nDefault Format: FAT32\n\n*SDXC capacities range from 64GB to 2TB\nDefault Format: exFAT\nThe section about operating systems that support exFAT File System does not even mention Linux. Furthermore, I'm interested about exFAT on SD cards, not about simple exFAT support on Linux, in case they differ.\n\nA: I don't have an SDXC card or a compatible reader, but I would advise caution if you are planning to use exFAT as it doesn't work for me on Lubuntu 13.10. I formatted on Windows 8, a 4gb usb stick in exFAT with 4096 allocation and MBR partition table. I wasn't able to mount it on Lubuntu 13.10. Additionally gparted only lists being able to copy and move exFAT partitions, not create them which could be a problem should you ever need to reformat the card. I have successfully used 32gb SDHC cards in Ubuntu before formatted as NTFS and FAT32 without any problems.\nScreenshot of mount attempt of 4gb usb stick using exFAT:\n\nScreenshot of Gparted filesystem support:\n\n\nA: Install the support for exFAT and you won't have a problem with it:\nsudo apt-get install exfat-utils\n\n", "Q: Why do I have to detect displays for my 2nd display each time I resume from suspend? I am using Ubuntu 12.04 with Saucy HWE and Nvidia 331.20 with GeForce 310.  I have two identical 1440x900 displays.  Nearly each time I resume from suspend, I have to detect displays to get my 2nd display to come back.  Sometimes I have to press the button several times and sometimes I get unknown display for the second display and the resolution is at 640x480 until I press detect displays a few more times.  \nThe primary display is connected with dual link DVI, and the second display is connect with single link DVI adapter to display port on the graphics card.  \nIs this normal, or does anyone have any suggestions?\n\nA: I had a similar problem with an older nvidia card.

The transfer speed on your Ubuntu machine, while a bit low, lies within the USB 2.0 specification. The speed on your Windows machine exceeds the USB 2.0 specification, which is probably because your USB hub in that machine allows higher transfer rates than specified, as is the case for some newer 2.0 hubs.\n", "Q: How to get a Dell XPS DE to recognise the Cypress touchpad under Ubuntu 13.10? I have recently bought a Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition (also known as Sputnik), supplied with Ubuntu 12.04. I've wiped that and installed 13.10 from scratch. I believe all the code improvements made by Dell have now been incorporated into the mainline kernel, so in theory everything should work without additional PPAs.\nHowever, the touchpad works as a mouse-like input device (I have a pointer, I can left-click and can touch to click) but there is no gesture support. I'm particularly looking for two-finger scroll. Also, the typing cursor frequently jumps about, and from what I have read on the web, the sensitivity of the trackpad may be responsible.\nIf a suitable device is available, Ubuntu should show extra trackpad options in System Settings -> Mouse & Touchpad, but I just get the usual ones (Primary Button, Double Click [Speed] and Mouse Speed).\nHere is a snippet from cat /proc/bus/input/devices:\nI: Bus=0018 Vendor=06cb Product=2734 Version=0100\nN: Name=\"DLL060A:00 06CB:2734\"\nP: Phys=\nS: Sysfs=/devices/pci0000:00/INT33C3:00/i2c-8/8-002c/input/input12\nU: Uniq=\nH: Handlers=mouse1 event12 \nB: PROP=0\nB: EV=17\nB: KEY=30000 0 0 0 0\nB: REL=3\nB: MSC=10\n\nAnd from xinput:\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SYNAPTICS Synaptics Large Touch Screen    id=9    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ DLL060A:00 06CB:2734                      id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ PS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                   id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=12   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Dell WMI hotkeys                          id=13   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Integrated_Webcam_HD                      id=14   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nAnd a snippet from X logs (/var/log/Xorg.0.log):\n[    25.877] (II) config/udev: Adding input device DLL060A:00 06CB:2734 (/dev/input/event12)\n[    25.877] (**) DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: Applying InputClass \"evdev pointer catchall\"\n[    25.877] (II) Using input driver 'evdev' for 'DLL060A:00 06CB:2734'\n[    25.877] (**) DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: always reports core events\n[    25.877] (**) evdev: DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: Device: \"/dev/input/event12\"\n[    25.888] (--) evdev: DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: Vendor 0x6cb Product 0x2734\n[    25.888] (--) evdev: DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: Found 3 mouse buttons\n[    25.888] (--) evdev: DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: Found relative axes\n[    25.888] (--) evdev: DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: Found x and y relative axes\n[    25.888] (II) evdev: DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: Configuring as mouse\n[    25.888] (**) evdev: DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: YAxisMapping: buttons 4 and 5\n[    25.888] (**) evdev: DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: EmulateWheelButton: 4, EmulateWheelInertia: 10, EmulateWheelTimeout: 200\n[    25.888] (**) Option \"config_info\" \"udev:/sys/devices/pci0000:00/INT33C3:00/i2c-8/8-002c/input/input12/event12\"\n[    25.888] (II) XINPUT: Adding extended input device \"DLL060A:00 06CB:2734\" (type: MOUSE, id 11)\n[    25.889] (II) evdev: DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: initialized for relative axes.\n[    25.889] (**) DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: (accel) keeping acceleration scheme 1\n[    25.889] (**) DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: (accel) acceleration profile 0\n[    25.889] (**) DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: (accel) acceleration factor: 2.000\n[    25.889] (**) DLL060A:00 06CB:2734: (accel) acceleration threshold: 4\n[    25.889] (II) config/udev: Adding input device DLL060A:00 06CB:2734 (/dev/input/mouse1)\n[    25.889] (II) No input driver specified, ignoring this device.\n\nIt looks like it is doing something but the \"ignoring this device\" waves a red flag for me. Also, the device comes up as a hex string rather than being seen as a \"Cypress\" pad - it seems it should show like this in gpointing-device-settings.\nI've searched for some possible strings in dmesg and found these:\njon@jon-XPS13-9333:~$ dmesg | grep synap\n[ 1412.350563] psmouse serio1: synaptics: device claims to have extended capabilities, but I'm not able to read them.\n[ 1412.550727] psmouse serio1: synaptics: device claims to have extended capability 0x0c, but I'm not able to read it.\n[ 1412.951089] psmouse serio1: synaptics: Unable to initialize device.\n[15884.370843] psmouse serio1: synaptics: Unable to query device.\n[17513.516033] psmouse serio1: synaptics: Unable to query device.\n[41102.794436] psmouse serio1: synaptics: Unable to query device.\njon@jon-XPS13-9333:~$ dmesg | grep trackpad\njon@jon-XPS13-9333:~$ dmesg | grep cypr\n\nFurthermore, I've noticed that I appear to have two touchpad devices erroneously detected. At first I mistook one for the touchscreen being wrongly reported, but in fact that is reported fine. The output of xinput above reveals the issue, as does gpointing-device-settings:\n\nI realised I'd made the assumption that I have a Cypress touchpad just by looking on the web, so I thought I'd try the Synaptiks application as well. This reports an error and will not start:\n\nNo touchpad found\nNo touchpad was found in this system. If the system has a touchpad, please make sure that the synaptics driver is properly installed and configured.\n\nSo for the time being, I'll continue to assume I have a Cypress pad that requires a Cypress driver.\n\nA: This is fixed using these instructions, found via this post. Although the poster in the first link found the fix did not work fully in their case, it has completely resolved it for me.\nThe fix is simply to add this line at the end of /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf:\nblacklist i2c-hid\n\nThis results in only one driver being recognised, which now provides the expected trackpad switches in Ubuntu Settings. Two-finger scroll now works fine.\nInterestingly it looks like I am indeed running a Synaptics touchpad - it is still detected thus:\n\nSynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\n\nand there is no mention of a Cypress device at all.\ng-pointer-settings and Synaptiks now both look like they will work (though I now no longer need them).

I have tried turning off transparency in dconf-editor, but to no avail (it was off all along).\nWhat to do?\n\nA: I think I've ran into the same issue - please check my post with the screenshot as well as provided possible scenario to resolve this.\n", "Q: best ubuntu for my poor PC recently I got an old laptop with 1 GB ram and 1.7 GHz proccessor. also I have found the terrible windows! I will be glad if I can completely destroy the installation of Windows XP and download the beautiful Ubuntu, but I'm confused... would it be okay if I download 12.10 32bit? because I think it will be slow. any idea about that? or should I use Xubuntu?\nthanks advance.\n\nA: I'd recommend Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit since it's a long term support release. You don't need the 64-bit version as you've only got 1 GB of RAM installed. If you are looking for a flavor of Ubuntu that is a little more light weight and will run a little quicker on slower hardware, I'd recommend Xubuntu which uses the XFCE window manager.\n\nA: There is no way in hell I'd install ubuntu with the unity desktop on a windows xp machine with 1Gb memory.  You didn't specify the cpu ... it may be single core ... but even if it was a dual core, no way.  I installed unity on my 4Gb i3 laptop and it was too slow for me.\nOn my netbook, which has a dual core atom and 1Gb, I've never considered installing unity but I've used the other 3 ubuntu desktops plus mint with the Mate desktop.  Mate was actually rather slow and Mint tech support is as bad as ubuntu's is good.  I wouldn't recommend mint for linux novices, period.\nKDE (kubuntu) actually isn't bad in a 1Gb space (especially considering it's considered bloated) if you tweak it for speed.  But it still has a bit lof latency.  Faster than the windows 7 starter that the netbook came with though.  KDE is endlessly configurable, which I like but many wouldn't, and it's usually done through GUI tools rather than editing config files.  Which is nice.\nXFCE (xubuntu) is pretty fast and light, and it works well in 1Gb.  But I didn't find it balzingly fast, and it doesn't have the features of KDE.  Which means I have to do a number of things by running separate apps, which slows me down.\nLXDE is really fast and light.  Really fast.  I'm running Lubuntu 13.10 on my netbook now.  It's the only one I've tried that has such a major speed difference.  But there are a lot of configuration things that you can't do from a GUI, which means editing config files.  Not so easy for a novice.\nBut I'm finding lubuntu a little clunky, the support doesn't seem to be as good as with other ubuntu desktops, the development seems stagnant from what I've read, and I have to wonder why lubuntu installs the XFCE power manager.  \nI may keep using lubuntu ... I'm willing to forgive some rough edges for this kind of speed.  But I  may upgrade the netbook RAM to 2Gb when the 14.04 lts comes out in a couplle of months and reinstall kubuntu. \nDon't install multiple desktops.  That can introduce hard to diagnose problems.  Better to just download and burn the iso's for different desktops and try them in live mode.\nIf you install lubuntu ... which is probably a good idea on an old 1Gb machine, don't install 12.04.  Unlike other versions, it wasn't a long term support version.  Lubuntu 14.04 is going to be their first lts.  I'd wait for that, though you could install 13.10 and upgrade later.\nLXDE (and XFCE to a lesser extent) do not have the eye candy.  I've seen lots of forum entries by people who add things to try to put eye candy into lxde.  They seem to have all kinds of problems, and it won' be a small and light desktop anymore.  The reason the newer flashy looking desktops don't work properly on old hardware is mostly because of the eye candy.  These desktops like unity and cinnamon require 3D hardware accel just by themselves.\n\nA: I tried Xubuntu and Lubuntu, and found that on computers with little resources, Lubuntu performed the best, installing and working successfully on machines in a community center with less than 256 MBs of RAM.

My ultimate goal is that I have a partition of 1.5 TB which is mirrored to both disks, so that I won't lose data if one hard disk crashes. Of course I'd like to be able to use the remaining 500 GB as well, but I don't need it mirrored. This is only about data, the system is on another harddisk.\nI'm not sure which is the best way to achieve that. I have thought of the following things:\n\n*\n\n*Raid 1 (although I'm not sure whether I could still use the remaining 500 GB then). Also I read that the partitions should be exactly the same size..\n\n\n*set up some rsync (not very convenient)\n\n\n*use LVM (although I'm not sure what to with that exactly)\nMy goal is to a) have redundancy so I won't lose data if one hd crashes and b) ideally gaining some performance if possible using e.g. raid\nAny advice is appreciated!\n\nA: I'm not sure what the purpose of this setup is- do you need both hard drives to be functional (and identical), or are you just referring to a full-on backup? \nFor a backup, there are several available tools to make complete backups. There is, of course, the deja dup tool, but you may wish to use something else. (There is also the dd tool from the command line; type man dd at the terminal to understand syntax.)\nBackup tools are discussed here; a common tool is Clonezilla.\nEDIT:\nHere's the cleanest means of using the dd function:\n\"dd if=/dev/hda1 of=./part1.image to backup(repeat for different partitions)\ndd if=./part1.image of=/dev/hda1 to restore\"\nOriginal post is here. Running this command periodically will give you a bit-perfect copy of your partition.\n\nA: I would say soft raid is probably the way to go (so mdadm).\nOn the smaller disk, you create a partition filling it. You check how big it is. You create a partition of the same size on the bigger disk and another partition to fill the rest of it. You set up a raid on the two partitions of equal size.\nYou should be able to look up the rest yourself...\n", "Q: Ubuntu Battery not charging or not detected Here is question/answer just to help the community.\nI just bought a new ASUS N750J . I had some issues installing kubuntu. Problems were the CPU FAN always running at full speed, battery not charging, not even detected... \nI had difficulties to find a solution over the Internet.

TO edit it, select the entry (or keep the default one) and press \"e\".\nI have found various \"solutions\" some hacks like \"pluggin/unplugging your power source 8 times and things like that. Most don't work and some only provide a temporary relief. The problem is at a very low level, some acpi tables get corrupted while dealing with the hardware.

My computer has two HDDs, one has 2T(Disk 1) while the other one has 500G(Disk 2). First I installed Windows 8.1 on disk1 and everything went well. Next I installed Ubuntu 13.10 desktop by a USB stick. I performed disk partition on disk2 manually and this is the partitions on disk2:\n/dev/sdb1 | /boot | primary\n/dev/sdb2 | /     | primary\n/dev/sdb5 | /swap | logical\n/dev/sdb6 | /home | logical\n\nI placed boot loader on /dev/sdb1 and then installation went on.

(Be sure to create a system image and recovery disk in case anything goes wrong.)\nYou should be able to use both storage HDDs as they are.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: first install Windows however you want.\nwhat you can do for the Ubuntu part is that you make a partition on the ssd and make it your / partition. and a partition on the hdd which you make /home. You find those options when you click 'something else' option while the install process. I am not sure whether there is a option to install some programs somewhere else than others. but with this setup you will install all programs and Ubuntu on the ssd but the user data will be on the hdd. \nYou should also make a swap partition. this one is maximum twice as large as your memory and I beleave it is best to place it on a hdd since it are a lot of writes and that might be a problem for a ssd.\nIf you need more help with how this works I can help you further with that.\n", "Q: Rename the extension of many files I would like to rename the extension .tar?h=ocdist105&=%2Fdata1%2F4070d0f0f1d62757%2Frequested_files for just .tar\nI tried the command \nrename 's/\\.tar?h=ocdist105&p=%2Fdata1%2F4070d0f0f1d62757%2Frequested_files$/.tar/' *.tar?h=ocdist105&p=%2Fdata1%2F4070d0f0f1d62757%2Frequested_files\n\nbut it seems not to be working.

If you use a swap file, I'd put that there as well. Then use the 160GB drive as your /home. No current Ubuntu installation is likely to use more than 10GB for system files. It's user files (video, music, etc. that take up most of your space.\nThe best time to do this is when you're installing or re-installing from scratch. There are several tutorials online that explain how to manually partition your file system while installing. Just backup your data first, then copy it all from your backup location back to your new ~/. Don't forget any hidden files.\nIt's possible to do this with an existing install, but it's more work, and there's a chance of a catastrophic failure which would wipe your user data, so backup your data first. \nBetter still, backup your data every week, just in case. \n", "Q: Heredoc Param evaluation in Bash $times=$1\nssh -A vyas@subdom.dom.net <<- EOF\n        for i in {1..$times}\n        do\n                echo 'Iteration' $i\n                url='vyas@app'\n                echo 'Connecting to' $url\n        done\nEOF\n\nBoth echo statements print blanks for the variable name:\n\nIteration \n  Connecting to\n\n$times=$1\nssh -A vyas@subdom.dom.net <<- \\EOF\n        for i in {1..$times}\n        do\n                echo 'Iteration' $i\n                url='vyas@app'\n                echo 'Connecting to' $url\n        done\nEOF\n\nOutput:\n\nIteration {1…}\n  Connecting to vyas@app\n\nI'm executing the above scripts with ./rt.sh  (./rt.sh 5).\nHow do I get the value of $i to read 1..$times?  \n\nA: The shell performs brace expansion before variable substitution, so the construct for i in {1..$x} cannot work as you expect.\nSince you want to pass in a variable, you cannot escape the heredoc terminator, so you have to work to protect all the variables you don't want expanded\ntimes=$1    # no \"$\" on the left-hand side!\nssh -A vyas@subdom.dom.net <<- EOF\n        for i in \\$(seq $times)\n        do\n                echo Iteration \\$i\n                url='vyas@app'\n                echo 'Connecting to' \\$url\n        done\nEOF\n\n", "Q: How Do I Search In Google Earth?

There are no wireless networks in the panel and the system settings only shows the ethernet connection... I have installed the sta drivers and that didn't help either.. any ideas?\nAdditional details: fresh ubuntu 13.10 install and fully updated\n\nA: Your Broadcom 4311 needs firmware and to have the STA driver removed. Please get a temporary wired ethernet connection, open a terminal and do:\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source\nsudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree\n\nDetach the ethernet, reboot and tell us if it is working.\n\nA: I have an Acer Aspire 4752 and I had a similar problem.   I found that I must turn on wireless with the physical switch everytime I turn on the computer.   The physical switch is accessed using the blue Fn key and one of the function keys at the top.  On mine it's F3.   I have to hold it down and push it 1 - 3 times before the wireless will turn on.   I suggest clicking on your wireless icon in the task bar so you can see it's status, then turning on the wireless at the switch.   If you press the switch, release it when you see the wireless icon change.\n", "Q: persist port routing from 80 to 8080 I use amazon EC2 instance which works via ubuntu. By default according security restrictions I can't bin my application to port 80, so I just bind it port 8080 and then set routing redirect from port 80 to 8080 via the following command:\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to 8080\n\nBut I found that when I reboot the server this settings no longer active untill I invoke this command again.\nSo my question is how to enable port's redirect work even if system was rebooted? \n\nA: Here is how the official iptables' documentation teaches us. See here\nAdd these two lines in /etc/network/interfaces:\npre-up iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules\npost-down iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules\n\nThe line post-down iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules will save the rules to be used on the next boot.\n\nA: You can add this command in /etc/rc.local , so it will be executed automatically after reboot .\n\nA: Use the iptables-save command instead.\nFirewall rules should never go into rc.local script. rc.local is the last thing to be executed. If a block rule has been placed into rc.local there is a small time frame where an attacker can exploit a rule not being in place.\nWhile it probably doesn't matter with this situation, it is still best to not get into a bad habit that may bite you later.\n\nA: I discovered a set of directories on Ubuntu 16.04 in /etc/network that will run scripts at various times during network initialization and shutdown:\nif-down.d\nif-post-down.d  \nif-pre-up.d  \nif-up.d\ninterfaces.d\n\nSo I found that I could dump the configuration as usual:\n$ sudo sh -c \"iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules\"\n\nThen I created a file `/etc/network/if-pre-up.d/restore:\n#!/bin/sh\n\niptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules\n\n... and flagged it executable\n$ sudo chmod 755 /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/restore\n\n", "Q: Can I build a Java-based game and move it to Ubuntu for the future tablets and phones? I am on my way to learn Java game programming to make my own Android apps.  My question is if I can built a Java-based game and move it to Ubuntu for the future tablets and phones.\n\nA: Ubuntu for phones won't accept Java apps. However you can run this app via Android SDK.\n", "Q: Subdownloader no longer working I've had this problem for a little while now: subdownloader no longer succeeds to download subtitles. It finds the subtitles fine, but fails to download them (there's no error message, the status just stays forever \"downloading...\" until I tell it to abort).\nI know there's alternatives to this program (I've successfully installed extensions for SMplayer and VLC), but the convenient thing I like about subdownloader is that it can download several subtitles in one go (useful if you have a lot of videos to manage).\nAnyone knows how to fix this?\n\nA: The answer is hear:\nhttp://forum.opensubtitles.org/viewtopic.php?t=1303\n\"100 downloads for 12 hours per IP, there is no limit I think, but out search result is limited to 250 results\"\n", "Q: Problem Opening Programs and Where is what I intall? I download Java to run Minecraft and also other programs that need installation. When I open it, instead of opening it with an installation or something it opens the folders inside of the program with the Archive Manager. I tried to open it with Wine but JAVA for example is .tar.gz.\nThe other problem I got is that when I install a program from terminal I cannot find it (I've tried searching it) and also I can't use it, for example Unrar.\nI am new to this software. I would be very thanks full if you help me.\n\nA: When installing new software you should use either the Ubuntu Software Center or sudo apt-get install <applicationNameHere>.  If you are downloading tars or zips, you are going to have a harder time finding/running them.\nAs for Java and Minecraft, run the following command from the Terminal:\njava -version\n\nDoes it return your current version of Java?  Or does it reply with command not found?  It should return output similar to this:\n$ java -version\njava version \"1.7.0_45\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)\n\nIf it returns command not found then you will need to follow the steps listed in this question to install Java: How do I install Java?\nOnce you have done that and are getting correct output from running a java -version, then you can download Minecraft from here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/launcher/Minecraft.jar\nMinecraft (for Linux) comes delivered in a Java ARchive or JAR file.  You can run this using Java.  First, copy Minecraft.jar from your ~/Downloads directory to another location.  I created a \"minecraft\" directory under my home directory for this purpose:\ncd ~\nmkdir minecraft\ncd minecraft\nmv ../Downloads/Minecraft.jar .\n\nTo run Minecraft, (in the future) just change to that directory and invoke it with Java:\ncd ~/minecraft\njava -jar Minecraft.jar \n\nRemember, Ubuntu (Linux) is case-sensitive, so make sure you don't alter the case of any of these commands.  You can also do other things like give Minecraft (Java) more memory, or create a clickable desktop icon, but this should be enough to get you started.\n", "Q: How to change icons on GNOME favorites bar? I'm new to Ubuntu, and I switched to GNOME and managed to change the icons! But when I open a program that has its own (new) icon on the favorites bar (if that's its name) I still see the original icon!\nThis also happens when I switch windows with Alt+Tab!\nIs there a way I can change that?\nEDIT:\n \n\nA: For changing icon settings etc, gnome-tweak-tool is rather effective.\nYou can also use it for managing Gnome Shell Extensions and other things as well\n", "Q: Scheduled Power On/Off of 2nd HDD im using a ubuntu 13.10 Server.\nI want to switch off the 2nd HDD completely and only power it up once a week to back up the system+data from the 1st HDD.\nI know how to use crontab, but I dont know how to switch off/on a HDD. \nP.s. can you recommend a good incremental backup tool/script?\n\nA: hdparm is probably what you want, it can control basically any aspect of your hard drives that you need. Invoked as hdparm -S [value] /dev/hda can control time until disk is put into standby/idle mode, and you should use the man page to check out other options you may find useful.\nI use rsync to manage all my incremental backups over ssh to a remote server, and can thoroughly recommend it to you for backup purposes.\n", "Q: X will not start while installing Ubuntu 13.10 on an ASUS N550JV I've been trying to install Ubuntu from a live usb on my ASUS N550JV-CN270H, of which the DVD Drive has been replaced by an SSD (Crucial M500 480GB).\nWhen I select Try Ubuntu in GRUB the normal loading screen appears, but the screen gets stuck on the part where all 5 dots are filled in for a while.\nAfter trying to boot with nomodeset I can switch to a TTY and all I have found out so far is that X doesn't start. When trying to manually start it with startx, I see (EE) Screen(s) found, but none have a usable configuration.\nWhat should I try next?\n\nA: It's not a real answer or a solution, but I could install in OEM mode with nomodeset. Afterwards, I used this xorg.conf to force my resolution:\nSection \"Screen\"\nIdentifier \"Default Screen\"\nDefaultDepth 24\nSubSection \"Display\"\nDepth 24\nModes \"1920x1080\"\nEndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Module\"\nLoad \"glx\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\nIdentifier \"Default Device\"\nDriver \"intel\"\nEndSection\n\n", "Q: cp: invalid option -- '/' I am trying to recover my encrypted folder by using ubuntu live cd, I have done all the steps now all I want to do is to copy my /tmp/ecryptfs.bM59alvG to /home/ubuntu/myfolder directory.\nI am using this command:\ncp -Rv/tmp/ecryptfs.bM59alvG/home/ubuntu/myfolder\n\nbut then I am getting this error cp: invalid option -- '/'. \nPlease help me out how to copy data of /tmp/ecryptfs.bM59alvG to my /home/ubuntu/myfolder.\n\nA: The problem is that you have forgot to put a space between your options and your path as well as the source path and the destination path. Your statement should look like this. \ncp -Rv /tmp/ecryptfs.bM59alvG /home/ubuntu/myfolder\n\nDepending on how you decrypted the folder, you might need root permissions to complete the copy. That would make the command look like this.\nsudo cp -Rv /tmp/ecryptfs.bM59alvG /home/ubuntu/myfolder\n\nThat being said, based on your post I would be very cautious about what you are trying to do. The Live CD version of Ubuntu runs in memory and might not have enough space to hold the files stored in your encrypted folder. Even if it does, you could lose all those files as soon as you reboot (the only possible exception being a Live USB with a persistence file). A much better idea would be to copy the files to some sort of external storage for safekeeping.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04, why so laggy?

So you need to have a swap space with atleast the size of 3000 Megabytes\nTo actually increase the size of the swap space, you don't have to reinstall, you should be able to find a few answers here.\nAlso, if you to eventually feel the need to reinstall due to these issues, you might want to use an lighter version of Ubuntu, like Xubuntu, or Lubuntu.\n", "Q: installing from USB I have done all the steps for making a bootable USB, changed the priority of USB to first, but after rebooting it loads Windows. It doesn't see the USB. \nThis is using USB 2.0 media. What could be the problem?\n\nA: If you made the appropriate settings in your computer's bios then you should try the boot options while booting your computer. Usualy its holding the F12 button. You will be presented with all discoverd boot options. You should see your usb device. \n", "Q: How to map my ipv4 address to external address in iptables I want to run a minecraft server (port 25565) and have it send to my external address for others to play, then to my hostname (I am assuming this is automatic - Do I need a rule for this too?).\nBut I need to map my ipv4 address (or port 25565) to my external address. I have opened the ports on my router config, so this is all I need. Thanks!\n\nA: I assume you have the minecraft server behind a router and your Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns a dynamic IP to you. \nIn your router settings you have to enable port forwarding. That is, any data sent to port 25565 will have to be forwarded to your minecraft server's internal IP address.\nAt this point you can find out your external IP by Googling \"Whats my IP\" (no quotes). and tell your friends the IP address to use to login to the server. If the ISP changes the IP address, you will have to tell them again the new one.\nIf you subscribe to a dyndns host name, you can give your friends the host name and have the router update the dyndsn service when your external IP changes. See DynDNS updater?\nNone of this has anything to to with Ubuntu. Therefore this question is off topic here.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Can't log in to Ubuntu 12.04 \"checking battery\" flashes up then goes back to login screen I am unable to log into my desktop even though I am using the correct password.

See http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/forum/unremovable-folder-after-trying-wipe-free-space; you can join the discussion there.\nThe OP of Not able to delete folder from gui or terminal has been able to get rid of it, see the answer; but probably his method is overkill. \nIn effect, doing a rm -r 4F8ZBREShQ and being patient (really really patient; ext4 is not a speed monster for large directories, and this is LARGE) would work. \nRecent ext4 should use a linear time with the size of the directory for the deletion process; even then, deleting millions of files will require a considerable time --- from tens of minutes to several hours. \n\nA: That file you are referring to is probably just a file full of zeros or random data that bleachbit uses to wipe free space.  If bleachbit fails or is turned off before wiping is complete the huge file remains.  It is safe to run the command \"rm -rf\"  A similar thing will happen when you overwrite free space manually using the \"dd\" command.  \"dd if=/dev/zero of=/user/sloshnmosh/Desktop/junkfile bs=4k conv=notrunc\"  after all space is overwritten you would issue the command \"rm /user/sloshnmosh/Desktop/junkfile\"  Bleachbit was simply shut off unexpectedly before being able to issue the \"rm\" command leaving all the zeros or /dev/urandom data that was used to occupy (overwrite) disk free space.  \n\nA: I was dealing with the same problem and the solution was to run in terminal rm -r \"folder_name\" and wait until is done.\n", "Q: Unnecessary packages on my Ubuntu VPS server from host.

I freed up some disk space (5 gb if I remember correctly) and installed Kali Linux. Amazingly, it worked like a charm, and GRUB enabled me to boot into both a UEFI and a legacy sistem from the same menu.\nBut then there was a problem. As I had partitioned such a small hard disk space (5gb) for Kali, naturally I filled up my Kali partition within a week. Disappointed in my stupid decision, I booted into windows and shrunk my Ubuntu partition by 25 gigs, then shifted my ubuntu partition and my swap partition to the right so that my Kali partition could be expanded( My partition setup can be seen in the following image).\nAfter expanding my Kali partition, I rebooted my system and could not boot into ubuntu (grub was still intact). In response, I created a boot-repair disk, and then reinstalled GRUB. Unfortunately, after rebooting my system again, my caps lock blinked and I was confronted with the following error screen.\nAny help would be appreciated. I am also curious as too what caused this issue, as it did not affect (to my knowledge) grub (I could still boot into Kali Linux) or the contents of the partition with Ubuntu on it (I could still open and read my files).\n\nA: First, you wrote:\n\nGRUB enabled me to boot into both a UEFI and a legacy sistem from the same menu.\n\nYou're almost certainly mistaken, because GRUB does not support switching boot modes (BIOS to EFI or EFI to BIOS). You could probably boot your Kali from Ubuntu's EFI-mode GRUB or Ubuntu from Kali's BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode GRUB, but in those cases, the target OS will be running in the boot mode of the boot loader, rather than in the OS's original installation mode. Linux is flexible that way; the kernel and subsequent tools don't really care how they're loaded, and will adapt to the boot environment without further reconfiguration. (There are some exceptions having to do with the initialization of hardware, but that's a matter that doesn't seem to affect you....)\nAs to your boot problem, it looks like GRUB is misconfigured. Either you changed your GRUB configuration (knowingly or not) when repartitioning or the repartitioning has changed the identities of some of your partitions, which has thrown GRUB off. Either way, the Boot Repair utility might fix the problem; however, given your odd configuration with a (presumed) mixture of EFI-mode and BIOS-mode GRUB installations from two distributions, there's a chance that Boot Repair will become confused and do no good, or maybe even make matters worse. If you try Boot Repair and it doesn't work, post back with the URL that it gives you; that will provide us with more detailed information about your configuration, which should help in providing a fix.\nAnother option is to install my rEFInd boot manager. You can do this while minimizing the risks by trying the USB flash drive or CD-R version (available from the downloads page). If you can boot from it, it should present options for booting Windows, Ubuntu, and Kali (although the latter two may not be clearly differentiated in the menu). Trying this is risk-free because you're not modifying your disk or NVRAM options when booting via the rEFInd external medium. If you can get into all three OSes via rEFInd, then you can install the rEFInd Debian package from Ubuntu. This should make rEFInd your default boot manager. You can then clean up the boot menu and assign distinctive icons for both Ubuntu and Kali, as described here.\n", "Q: Two windows - Mono I want to open 2 projects of mono at the same time(working at the same time too), but when i open mono, the first window will always be opened.

I do prefer Ubuntu but it's (unfortunately) just not well optimised for games ;_; Anyway I'm pretty computer illiterate when it comes to partitioning, OSes and BIOSes so if anyone can tell me how to remove Ubuntu easily and leave my PC like it was when it was put together with no OS. Thanks!\n\nA: Hard drives can come formatted, unformatted, or unformatted without a partition table. I'm guessing you don't know which your's came as, but if your goal is to erase Ubuntu and have the drive empty and ready to have something else installed on it then unformatted is a good option. Knowing whether or not you have a BIOS computer or a UEFI based computer would also be helpful in deciding whether to use a gpt or mbr partition table. The steps below will tell you how to get rid of Ubuntu, create a fresh mbr or gpt partition table, and leave the drive unformatted. \nStep #1 = Insert an Ubuntu livecd into your computer's dvd/cd drive.\nStep #2 = Reboot the computer.\nStep #3 = When the computer powers up immediately press the key listed for entering your bios (or uefi) quickboot menu. This key is different for different computers but popular keys are F2, F4, F10, F11, F12, and Esc.\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/db3lQ.png\nStep #4 = In the Bios (or UEFI) quickboot menu you will see a list of boot options. Choose cd/dvd, as this will allow you to boot the Ubuntu livecd. Use the arrow keys and press enter to choose the desired entry.\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/8px17.png\nStep #5 = Once the livecd boots up choose \"Try Ubuntu without installing\".\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/oSVr6.png\nStep #6 = Once the desktop appears, choose the launcher icon, search \"gparted\", and click to launch it. It should be pre-installed on the livecd if you are using 12.04, but if not you can install it by typing in terminal \"sudo apt-get install gparted\".\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/Lchzf.png\nStep #7 = Once gparted opens, you need to select the desired drive using the selector on the top right. If you only have 1 hard drive then it will already be selected so there is no need.\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/nRpcF.png\nStep #8 = Right click on the \"linux-swap\" partition and choose \"swap-off\". You will notice after doing this that there are no more \"lock\" icons on any partitions. If for some reason you have a partition still showing a lock icon, right click on it an choose \"unmount\".\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/sjzoX.png\nStep #9 = Go to the \"devices\" menu, and choose \"create partition table\".\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/mY6t5.png\nStep #10 = Click the advanced tab on the popup that appears. From the list choose \"msdos\" if you want an MBR partition table, or gpt if you want a GUID partition table. If you don't know which then pick MBR as it's standard and is used by both Windows and Linux operating systems. If your computer is a Windows 8 UEFI computer then you would likely want GPT. \nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/Pc2Of.png\nStep #11 = Your drive should now be unallocated. You have a partition table, but no partitions. You can shutdown and eject the livecd.\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/36TDD.png\n[Please note: The drive has only been quick-formatted so there is potential for data recovery. This is fine if you plan to keep the drive, but if you selling this hard drive or giving it away you should consider a \"low level format\" to prevent recovery of your data by the new owner. This may not apply to you, but it might to someone else reading this posting.]\n", "Q: How can I edit the source of HTML in the clipboard? If I cut some HTML from a Pidgin instant messenger window, I can easily paste it verbatim into a new HTML email in Thunderbird. All formatting (fonts, colors, etc) are preserved, so it appears that my Ubuntu 13.10 desktop clipboard must have the HTML source somewhere.\nBut I'd like to tweak the HTML source.\nHow can I actually get at the HTML source when it is in the clipboard? I'd like to just throw it into a text file, work on the markup in Vim or whatever, then use this HTML source in a webpage or feed it to Thunderbird's \"Insert → HTML\".\nHmm, maybe something like PasteImg (mentioned in Getting a graphic on the clipboard to the disk?), but using request_rich_text() instead of request_image()? I wouldn't mind using a small Python script the rare times I want to get HTML source from the clipboard.\nWhat's in the clipboard may actually be \"rich text\".\nThe Python script from this answer outputs\nCurrent clipboard offers formats: ('TIMESTAMP', 'TARGETS', 'MULTIPLE',\n'SAVE_TARGETS', 'COMPOUND_TEXT', 'STRING', 'TEXT', 'UTF8_STRING', 'text/html',\n'text/plain')\n\nTurns out my Pidgin logs are in HTML, so that's one way to get at this HTML source, bypassing the clipboard entirely. I'm still interested in the answer to the original question (how to retrieve HTML from the clipboard).\n\nA: Found it! Here's how to get at the HTML source when there's some on your clipboard:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport gtk\nprint (gtk.Clipboard().wait_for_contents('text/html')).data\n\nThis helped.\nThis didn't work for me. My callback was never entered.\n\nA: I see what you're trying to get at. Try pasting into something that takes wysiwyg, edit it there, then copy paste into Thunderbird?\nMaybe bluegriffon or libreoffice writer will work.\n\nA: Here's a modification of your script, which actually allows editing the html directly. \nIt also handles problems with character encoding: if you reply to an e-mail from someone using Windows, chances are the encoding is stuck in UTF-16, which is no good for \nediting. You may need to install the chardet module in Python.\nReplace 'vi' with your text editor of choice, in subprocess.call(....\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport gtk\nimport chardet\nimport os\nimport getopt\nimport subprocess\n\ndtype = 'text/html'\nhtmlclip = gtk.Clipboard().wait_for_contents(dtype).data\nencoding = chardet.detect(htmlclip)['encoding']\n\n# Shove the clipboard to a temporary file\ntmpfn = '/tmp/htmlclip_%i' % os.getpid()\n\nwith open (tmpfn, 'w') as editfile:\n   editfile.write(htmlclip.decode(encoding))\n\n# Manually edit the temporary file\nsubprocess.call(['vi', tmpfn])\n\nwith open (tmpfn, 'r') as editfile:\n   htmlclip = editfile.read().encode(encoding)\n\n# Put the modified data back to clipboard\ngtk.Clipboard().set_with_data(\n      [(dtype,0,0)],\n      lambda cb, sd, info, data: sd.set(dtype, 8, htmlclip),\n      lambda cb, d: None )\ngtk.Clipboard().set_can_store([(dtype,0,0)])\ngtk.Clipboard().store()\n\nThis does a full edit cycle, modifying the clipboard “in place”. \nI use it to make up for Thunderbird's annoying lack of a html-editor feature:\n\n\n*\n\n*select all with ctrl+a in the message composing window\n\n*ctrl+c\n\n*run the above script, which opens an editor –\n\n*\n\n*make your changes to the html source\n\n*save and quit\n\n\n*ctrl+v in the compose window overwrites the entire content with your html-edited version.\n\n\nA: I don't really use Thunderbird, but you should be able to use an extension to help edit the source in Thnderbird - e.g:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/edit-html-source/ not been updated for ages\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/stationery/\n\nA: There is an answer at which directly uses the xclip utility:\nxclip -selection clipboard -o -t text/html\n\nI find it the easiest and most reliable now, since GTK3/Python3 seems to have introduced some changes that broke the original answer.\n\nA: To get the HTML source code of the \"rich text\":\n# Get the HTML source to stdio\nxclip -selection clipboard -t text/html -o\n\nYou have several TARGETs, like text/plain (default) to get just the rendered text.\nI manipulate the plain/text content of the clipboard using xsel:\nxsel -b | something | something_else | xsel -b\n\nPretty useful to for e.g. change a list to a TOP n cases, with sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20.\nIn your case change the first xsel -b with the above xclip command.\n", "Q: matplotlib Error: No module named matplotlib even though it is installed I have been through the process of installing matplotlib on my Ubuntu 12.04 computer.

That will be Chromium 35 Beta, then. Unfortunately the Chromium projects don't provide any stable builds for Linux, so if you want the current Chromium 34 you will have to compile it yourself.

With 2gb of ram you absolutely can happily run a 64bit operating system though you may find it consumes a little more of your ram than a 32bit install. \n\nA: 64 bit is the recommended system these days ( it's not just about memory ), but I don't think that old CPU is 64 bit capable, so you will need to stick with 32 bit.\n\nA: If your processor really is 64-bit capable (try booting from 64-bit LiveCD), I still think 64-bit system will give you no benefits.\n\n\n*\n\n*64-bit systems may use more than 64GB, 32-bit with PAE (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension) may use up to 64 GB, without PAE -- up to 4GB. Those amounts of memory include not just physical memory, but virtual memory as well, so you cannot enlarge swap file or swap partition to overcome the limits.\n\n*Even a PAE 32-bit system can NOT allocate more than 4GB (memory and address space) to a single app, so apps that deal with huge amounts of data sometimes require 64-bit.\n\n*Generally if you compare the 32- and 64- bit versions of the same OS or of the same app, 64-bit one will use more memory due to larger size of primitive datatypes (mostly pointers). Which one will be faster, depends on application.\nSo, if you do not have much memory, and do not have apps that need more than 4GB of memory or of address space, 32-bit system is quite ok. 64-bit one is usually needed for systems with a lot of memory. However, even in your case it is good to use 64-bit if some of your apps fail due to lack of virtual address space (it is not a very common problem, but sometimes it happens).\n\nA: First your CPU can only support 32 bit operating System (X86 Family)\nWhen 32 bit system support only 4GB memory , that doesn't means , this is only the ram ,\n4 Gb refers to total addressable memory space and not just the RAM installed ( also Graphics memory , etc) .\nSo if you have a 4 Gb ram slot and 2 Gb graphics memory , 32 bit operating system will access 2 Gb of your ram because the limit is 4Gb of total memory.\n64 bit operating system will handle 16EB (exabytes) of total memory \nConclusion , for your resources you have the minimum requirements of using 32 bit operating system , if you want to use 64 just you should buy new hardware.\n", "Q: Problem embedding a pylab Figure in a Gtk application using quickly I am currently trying to build a simple app that includes some pylab figures.

I'll take a look at the sixad package to see if I can find where the permissions were mangled.\nEDIT\nI think this happens when you try sixad --boot-yes. This will disable the newer v4 bluez Bluetooth stack in favor of the sixad driver based on bluez v3. You can only use one or the other, until sixaxis is supported by bluez v4.\nI also needed to manually sudo hciconfig hci0 up after setting sixad to start at boot, as for some reason sudo hciconfig -a showed my bluetooth device as down.

I was trying on sublime Text 3 Beta version which Been two slow after adding remote mount folder, So i just moved on sublime text 2 and now its running fine without any delay in sync.\n\nA: I tried @ashish-tiwari solution, and indeed the problem of slowness goes away in Sublime version 2. It seemed pretty illogical to me that a new version could handle something like that in such a different way, so I tried disabling all packages in version 3 and voila! Worked like a charm, like version 2. \nEventually, I found the culprit: VCS Gutter. I suspect any version control package would do the same, since they need to access the information about the repository on the remote FS. In any case, that worked for me, so hopefully it will help someone else as well.\n", "Q: where/how do i find the file for 'sound' of 'system settings'?

The desktop has two different hard drive; 120GB SSD and 2TB HDD. I have Ubuntu 13.04 already installed in SSD and I partitioned HDD as 500GB, 750GB and 750GB. I used 750GB partitions to store files so that 120 will be left to Ubuntu only and left 500GB as unallocated space just in case. \nNow Windows 8.1 has been installed to 500GB. SSD has the priority from the BIOS and unless it is changed from the boot menu, Windows is not able to boot. \nWhat I want to do is to make/create a Grub menu so that the user of the desktop will have sometime to choose which to boot or if no choice is made, boot Ubuntu. I am not able to do a clean install to any OS.  Is there any possible way to make/create such a Grub menu? \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You can edit the grub boot records manually using this tutorial:\nHow do I set Windows to boot as the default in the boot loader?\nOr use grub customizer which is a gui based grub editor for Ubuntu.\nIn either case you need to have basic disk partition details and their notations. You can\nuse any disk management tools like Disk Utility which is pre-installed on Ubuntu.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Banshee CPU usage > 100% Banshee CPU usage peaks and maintains >= 100% (according to htop) when I do simple,  nontrivial things.

And I can't move PhpStorm icon lower that it is now.\nHere's my NVidia configuration:\n\nWhy is that? How to fix that?\n\nA: Xfce 4.10 has only limited support for multiple monitors. The upcoming 4.12 is better at that (see design/xfce4-settings/display for details). You can try installing the (unreleased) 4.12 from ppa:xubuntu-dev/xfce-4.12 to see if it fixes your problems. \nAdditionally, did you try to set up the monitors properly by using arandr?  Or perhaps you simply need to follow the advice in this question: How do I setup dual monitors in XFCE?. \n", "Q: Unable to set java path Hey I am trying to save my Oracle JDK path by using following command\nsudo gedit /etc/environment\n\nAnd the I am saving path asL\nJAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_51\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_51/bin\"\n\nAnd after saving when I am using echo $PATH I am unable to see my saved path.

I could not find much documentation on /etc/environment, this page explains almost nothing. Here's what I tested:\n\n\n*\n\n*I added SOMETHING=hello in /etc/environment\n\n*I switch to a virtual terminal with Control Alt F1, run echo $SOMETHING and I correctly see hello so it worked\n\n*I start a new terminal, say xterm, run echo $SOMETHING but it doesn't print anything\n\n\nSo it would seem that the file is used when a new login session is started. Starting a new terminal in your existing X session will not start a new login session, that's why you will see no effect.\nWhile testing, you can use the virtual terminals, that's a lot easier than restarting X many times.\n", "Q: How to run scripts without typing the full path? I'd like to know if there is a way to run  program/shell script without typing full path:\n/opt/idea/bin/idea.sh\n\n\nA: You can just create symlink. Create it in /usr/local/bin. All you need is to run command:\nsudo ln -s /full/path/to/your/file /usr/local/bin/name_of_new_command\n\nAfter that you should make your file executable:\nchmod +x /full/path/to/your/file\n\nNow you should be able to run name_of_new_command at any time in your terminal.\nNote that this is good solution only for home usage of Linux.\n\nA: We can also run /opt/idea/bin/idea.sh file directly using bash_aliases\nOpen ~/.bashrc file by running,\ngedit ~/.bashrc\n\nRemove the # before the lines and save it, so that the lines will look like,\nif [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then\n    . ~/.bash_aliases\nfi\n\nNow open ~/.bash_aliases file,\ngedit ~/.bash_aliases\n\nAdd the below lines in that file and save it,\nalias idea='cd /opt/idea/bin && sudo ./idea.sh'\n\nFinally source the ~/.bashrc file,\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nNow you can run /opt/idea/bin/idea.sh file directly by,\nidea\n\n\nA: We can define a function and a add hotkey by using bind command to call that.

Now press your favorite keyboard shortcut. The correct escape code should appear. Just make sure to replace ^[ with \\e before adding the shortcut to, e.g. replace ^[[24~ with \\e[24~.\n\nA: In addition to the other good answers, consider symlinking into ~/.local/bin and adding this directory to your PATH (from within your .bashrc for instance).  This method does not require special permissions (unlike symlinking to /usr/local/bin, for instance).  This way, you may have a standard directory struction without flooding your $HOME.

I expected to have to go through some trial and error to get the USB to work properly as it wasn't listed as a Bluetooth adapter with any official support (it's a Targus 4.0 dual-mode micro USB adapter). To my surprised it worked perfectly fine upon plugging it. Everything seemed to work as intended any way - as the Bluetooth icon was present in the upper right of the screen and it could be controlled normally through System Settings. I even got it to recognize the controller without to much of a hassle and was calibrating it for game use.\nThe problem is I turned off my computer since then, and on re-boot the Bluetooth has been unresponsive. The indicator light on the actual USB device is on so I know it's getting power yet the icon on the top bar is gone and the System Settings are unresponsive. It looks like my computer just stopped recognizing the device but I can't see why.\nI've tried rebooting my PC with the adapter unplugged and putting it back in once the system is up and running and I've tried booting my PC with the adapter in different USB slots in case one was faulty.\nI've also attempted to switch the software running the device from gnome-bluetooth to bluez but there was no change.\nI'm running Ubuntu 13.10 and while I'm not a particularly new user I'm not particularly knowledgeable with code.

Also, as Ubuntu's fdisk doesn't support GPT, your fdisk output is worse than useless -- it's led you to believe that the disk has one partition, whereas it almost certainly has at least two. You should use parted or gdisk to view the partition table, as in:\nsudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\nsudo parted /dev/sda print\n\nMost Mac disks have a FAT32 EFI System Partition (ESP) as the first partition, but this partition is unlikely to hold any data you want. The data you seek is probably on an HFS+ partition numbered 2 or above.\nOnce you've found and mounted your HFS+ partition, you may run into a permissions issue, because Ubuntu and OS X assign different user ID (UID) values to the first user by default.

Apparently, the Emerald window decorator, which runs with the [Compiz window manager] (somehow I get the feeling that \"runs\" is not the correct word to use here), offers many fantastic-looking themes to the desktop. However, its ppa is not included (though the default repositories contain Compiz somewhere) and it must be manually added before it can be sudo apt-get installed. \nCompiz's documentation on it is a bit spotty, but then again, a lot of Compiz's documentation seems a bit incomplete (as in, there are section headers that have no content beneath them).

Is there a non-hacky way to change the color of just the header in an app using the Ubuntu SDK? MainView has a headerColor property, but that is used as the first step of gradient. Currently, I'm just putting a colored rectangle up there:\nRectangle {\n    id: headerBackground\n    height: header.height\n    width: header.width\n    anchors.top: parent.top\n    color: \"#288369\"\n}\n\nBut this causes a number of issues, most notably it is incomparable with a ListView that fills an entire page. A full example can be found in this gist.\n\nA: Try setting anchors.fill: header, that way it always stays within the bounds of the Header component.\nYou can also check out a more detailed implementation from KarmaMachine:\nAt the bottom here the developer creates a new HeaderArea component that is a child of pageStack.header\nhttps://github.com/brianrobles204/Karma-Machine/blob/master/KarmaMachine.qml#L489\nusing the QML Component.createObject() method from:\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-14.04/QtQml.Component/#createObject-method\nThen in the HeaderArea he sets the anchors to fill the parent, which is pageStack.header:\nhttps://github.com/brianrobles204/Karma-Machine/blob/master/HeaderArea.qml#L19\nHe also does a lot more to add functionality to the header, but it should give you an idea of how to do it.\n\nA: Michael's pointer to Karma Machine's implementation did indeed point me in the right direction. The key is injecting the rectangle into the header so that it is a proper child. This can be done with the createObject() method that Michael mentioned if you have the rectangle in a separate qml file, or you can use createQmlObject with a string of QML.\nBelow is a much simplified example (using Tabs but the same thing is possible with a PageStack):\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\n\nMainView {\n    id: mainView\n\n    width: units.gu(40)\n    height: units.gu(60)\n\n    Tabs {\n        id: tabs\n\n        Tab {\n            title: i18n.tr(\"Colored Header\")\n            page: Page {\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    Component.onCompleted: {\n        tabs.tabBar.__styleInstance.headerTextSelectedColor = \"white\";\n        var component = Qt.createQmlObject(\n            'import QtQuick 2.0; Rectangle { anchors.fill: parent; z: -1; color: \"#288369\"; }',\n            tabs.header);\n    }\n}\n\n", "Q: Does each KVM Guest need its own ISO Does each KVM guest require its own copy of the bootable ISO image?

Or am I approaching the problem the wrong way?\nThanks in advance for your time!\n\nA: Of course since isoes are read only, you could do as you suggest, but Ubuntu isoes allow an actual installation to the virtual disk, which does take more space (3-4G), but then the iso is not used at all, and since the filesystem is no longer compressed, should boot/run faster.\n", "Q: How can I install grub4dos to my USB stick? Though I searched for web I could not find a guide to install grub4dos into my USB stick in Ubuntu. \nIs it possible in Ubuntu?

Those problems were resolved once I installed some additional drivers. \nThe problem is, when going to System Settings > Additional Drivers, the only option there is this:\n\nWhile this did fix my earlier problems with the wine applications, I'm now facing new problems - every time I close the lid, when I open it up again I see a black screen and only the mouse (but I can't move it). The computer doesn't respond to anything I do, and I have to forcibly shut it down and start again. \nIf I leave the computer open, and it goes to sleep, then this problem doesn't happen.

In case only part of the experience\napplies to you, and would be helpful for you, here is more detail. \nBefore the install, db2prereqcheck complained:\n   DBT3514W  The db2prereqcheck utility failed to find the following\n   32-bit library file: \"/lib/libpam.so*\".\n\nSure enough, all I had was:\n   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpam.so.0.83.0\n   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpamc.so.0\n   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpam.so.0\n   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpam_misc.so.0.82.0\n   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpamc.so.0.82.1\n   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpam_misc.so.0\n\nAfter looking around the web a bit, I did:\n   apt-get install libpam0g:i386\n\nafter which I also had:\n   /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpam.so.0.83.0\n   /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpamc.so.0\n   /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpam.so.0\n   /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpam_misc.so.0.82.0\n   /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpamc.so.0.82.1\n   /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpam_misc.so.0\n\nBut db2prereqcheck still made the same complaint.\nA number of places on the web recommended:\n   ln -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpam.so.0 /lib/libpam.so.0\n\nbut that seemed to me like a grotesque hack, that would be sure\nto land me in different trouble with different applications\nfarther down the road.\nI tried a number of things with environment variables, including\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH_32, but nothing\nhelped with the db2prereqcheck.\nSomeone I trust said to just go ahead with the install anyway.\nSo I did\n   db2_install\n\n(it was a remote headless system), and although the db2prereqcheck\nthat runs as part of the install complained, the install did work.\nSadly, db2start complained:\n   sqllib/adm/db2start: error while loading shared libraries:\n   libaio.so.1: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32\n\nSomeone I trusted recommended:\n   apt-get install libaio1\n\nwhich installed 64-bit libaio (prior to that my system only included\n32-bit), after which I ended up with:\n   /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libaio.so.1.0.1\n   /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libaio.so.1\n   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libaio.so.1.0.1\n   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libaio.so.1\n\nAfter that, everything went fine.\nAgain, bottom line: I was missing 32-bit libpam and 64-bit libaio. \nBTW, my system image already included packages libstdc++6 and lib32stdc++6\n-- something which a lot of folks seem to be missing in their environments.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: On Ubuntu server 14.04.02 (64 bit) I had to install the following packages before installing DB2 10.5:\n\n\n*\n\n*libx32stdc++6\n\n*libpam0g:i386 \n\n*libaio1\n\n\nA: You may have to run ldconfig after installing the i386 version of the pam library; DB2 searches the linker cache for it's dependencies, so if it's installed and there is an entry in /etc/ld.so.cache.d/, it should find it if ldconfig has been run.\nRunning something like strace db2 connect to sample will give you a lot of information.\n\nA: ln -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpam.so.0 /lib/libpam.so.0\n\nThis did the trick for me, despite the ugly hack.\napt-get install libpam0g said everything was installed and up to date.\n\nA: For the once trying to install DB2 with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS the missing package can be installed with the command:\nsudo apt-get install libpam0g-dev:i386\nNOTE: the libpam0g-dev package is safer to install than the libpam0g package since it can be safely used only for development compilations and setup software to be installed.\nNOTE2: the amd64 is around for more than 20 years now, maybe IBM will update DB2 to amd64 one of these days.\nNOTE3: Thank you for this question, it save me hours of try and error\n", "Q: How many hours the computer is running for upgrade linux ubuntu?

Check your router. You did back up all your user files before you started, right? Because this is why you never trust any upgrade or install procedure that's supposed to leave your data untouched.

Windows installs its boot partition, typically 100MB and hidden in Windows to the drive that is the boot drive in BIOS. And that partition has boot flag (active partition) so Windows knows which partition to boot from.\nBut you do not have to have separate Windows boot partition. But you are missing bootmgr and the BCD. If you run Windows repairs on your Windows NTFS partition that should add those. Be sure to first set Windows drive as BIOS boot drive or Windows repairs may put a new boot partition into sdb, and since it does not see Linux partitions and rewrites partition table will destroy Linux on sdb.\nGrub does not use boot flag, but some BIOS will not let you boot without boot flag on a primary partition. I would suggest moving boot flag from sdb5 to sdb1, but that is not related and may not be required.\nAfter you fix Windows, reset BIOS to boot from sdb.

I need to get work done. I really do. That's my primary concern.

However, it really can't even handle point 1) on my list properly. \nI have to consciously control stuff like this: \n\n\n*\n\n*I can't have a PDF file open while Spyder is running; things would just bog down really fast. \n\n*I can't open more than ~10 tabs. \n\n*I have to force myself to do one thing at one time as much as possible (good for me to a certain extent!)\n\n\nYou get the idea.\nI am hoping that switching to Ubuntu (Lubuntu specifically) will help my computer in terms of performance. Is this reasonable to expect?\nHere are some of the issues I am aware of:\n\n\n*\n\n*UEFI stuff \n\n*various hardware compatibility issues\n\n*time, lots and lots of time to get things working\nHere's how my computer would be ideally set up:\n\n\n*\n\n*main partition would be some lightweight version of Ubuntu\n\n*secondary (~15 GB) partition with Windows for the stuff that just needs Windows\n\n\nI have played around with Ubuntu before (2009 - on a better laptop, in happier days when I didn't need to do much apart from making my desktop setup look cool...). I remember eventually becoming tired of it because of little things that just wouldn't work either because I didn't know how to use a GNU/Linux system properly, and to a smaller extent because Ubuntu just had some rough edges. \nShould I make the switch?\n\nA: It is not possible to give a clear recommendation, but I can comment on your tasks and you can decide based on it:\n@1 This works equally good on Windows and Ubuntu, no real reason to chose one over the other for this task.\n@2 This is also possible on both operation systems. No real reason to chose one over the other.\n@3 I personally really prefer to develop in Linux, but this is also something you can do perfectly fine in both operation systems.\n@4 Works fine on both operation systems, but personally I think this is preferred to do on Linux rather than Windows.\n@5 I have not used Matlab for a long time and never on Linux, but for what I hear this application works way better on Windows than on any Linux distro.\nIn regard to performance, Ubuntu will often perform slightly better than Windows, but for most cases this in not something most people will notice.\nThe openness of Linux is a huge plus for anyone who likes technology.\nTo sum up my thoughts: If Matlab is an imporatant part of your day - consider sticking to Windows. Otherwise go for Ubuntu.\n\nA: You should not switch. The first thing you should do is to upgrade to Win 8.1, which is a stable and versatile OS. The upgrade is free. Ubuntu can of course be installed alongside, but the stability of the Grub-based startup menu you have to deal with after the installation, can be quite annoying. By all means - Ubuntu is a great OS, but to be quite frank - Windows 8.1 has a lot more opportunities when it comes to available software etc.\nRegards\nLars H.\n\nA: I have recommended linux for my friends who are either very simple computer users or very enthusiastic computer users. \nIf you don't use you computer to anything else than web browsing and checking mail linux is at most points better than windows, and if you are a computer enthusiast and like tinkering with your system and programming linux is also better than windows.\nAs long as you are not in need of proprietary software (e.g. Adobe software, Visual studio, Sony Vegas) or gaming (which linux is getting alot better at though!) you will most likely be very happy with using linux.\nWhen i look at the hardware of you laptop i saw that it's using a AMD A6 APU, which might not be the best thing ever.\nI have no idea if the open source radeon graphics drivers works well with the new AMD APUs, but i am currently writing this on a old lenovo x100e running Arch Linux with an even older AMD APU (Radeon 3000 series) and the open source drivers are decent but i could not get the proprietary drivers installed on either Ubuntu or Arch which i would have prefered.\nCheck how the open source radeon drivers are good on your APU on linux, and if they are not good check if the proprietary works well on it.\nMost likely it will work fine, but you don't want to take a guess before installing.\nIntel graphics are recommended for linux laptops, and i'm planning on buying one with that when i graduate this summer.\nI have never installed linux on a computer with UEFI, but from what i have heard it has either been very simple or very complicated. I think that you should at least try, but give up if it takes too much time.\nI have not used spyder but i have developed alot of python on my linux laptop, and i have come to the conclusion that as long as it is not a too heavy application it usualy works fine. Python and GTK is fine, but PyGame runs horribly because of the video drivers.\nIt's a myth nowadays that it takes alot of time to install the drivers for linux (especially ubuntu), the last 4 years i have installed linux on various computers the only driver issue i have are for graphics cards. Alsa and OSS used to be a hassle, but that is very very rarely a problem anymore. If you want to save time and know a friend who is used to linux, ask him if you run into any issues as it will save you alot of time if you encounter any.\nIf you develop on linux you will have to learn basic commandline stuff which might take a couple of months to get used to, but after that you will realize that it's more efficient than clicking around in menus on windows. Python is very easy to use in the commandline and so is haskell, so it's two good language to start developing with on linux.\nGood luck!\nI hope that you will switch but if you simply feel that it's too much of a hassle, just skip it.\nOnce you get used to linux though, you won't want to go back ;)\n", "Q: Wifi adapter worked from 12.04 DVD but won't connect after installing UB 12.04 I really don't get it, my wifi worked fine when I booted from dvd but after installing ub 12.04 my wifi only detects all APs but I suddenly can't connect to any of 'm and my neighbor upstairs and me are sharing his broadband connection (So I can only connect to the internet via Wifi and not by cable)\nI'm so pissed off, I donated $25 when I was asked for a donation before downloading ub 12.04, because of the \"good\" first impression I got from the trial I thought, why not, it works fine\nWhich it DID until I installed ub 12.04 and got stuck, I'm writing this on a damn tablet, ain't that great?\nHow can I download necessary drivers if I can't get my pc connected?\nI have a sweex rt73 and a built in wifi adapter Ralink technology corp 802.11n wireless lan card, but i'd rather not use the built in card because I have a much better signal on the sweex rt73 wifi stick\nI also tried tethering my pc with a tablet but after a few seconds ub disconnects the usb connection to the tablet, so no network there either\n\nA: I suspect the drivers for your two devices are conflicting.

I read on many docs that FTP is insecure and that SFTP or SSH is the best way to go.\nBut here's what I want to do...\nWe are a group of 4 users on a LAN. The Ubuntu server modules (eg: LAMP stack, Postgres, etc) are actually on an Ubuntu Desktop OS. Anyway, we're using it as a server.\nI need for each user to log-in from their PCs (usually Ubuntu) and update their work in /var/www and other shared folders. Not everyone has access to every folder. So I guess creating FTP accounts for each user is a good way to go.\nNow, since many people suggest that open-SSH or SFTP is the way to go, I'd like to know the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it correct to assume that SSH applies to a machine and NOT to a user? So if this is the case users will need to stick to a single computer.\n\n*Does SFTP work the same way as FTP where user names can be created with restricted upload/download rights?\n\n*Is it really a bad idea to continue using FTP instead of the more 'secure' alternatives since I'm on a LAN?\nPretty confused and really appreciate your inputs!\n\nA: Working backwards in your group of questions:\n3) If we presume that your FTP server is not exposed to the wilds of the Internet, then FTP is fine for transferring files internally on your LAN.\n2) SFTP works just like FTP for implementation regarding users and access privileges. Only the security of the connection between host and client is increased through encryption.\n1) SSH works at both the machine and user level. Users with host machine accounts can SSH in to the host; hosts can be configured with non-machine users to allow SSH (see running an OpenSSH Server).\n", "Q: How to change terminal theme / behavior?

The \"terminal\" itself is the thing you get when pressing ctrl+alt+shift+Fx (actually not right either, those are virtual terminals).\nYou can get a fancier terminal emulator with\n - transparency - diverse options - color themes - shortcuts - tabs - etc.\nAlso you can change the font.\nYiu can change the shell:The shell in Ubuntu is pretty standard. Get eg. zsh with oh-my-zsh and powerline - Just google, this can look awesome!Thkse shells often give you options like tab-completion, colored output, statusses in the prompt and syntax-highlighting.\nNo, you can't:The terminal is just a prompt where you can access all installed CLI programs AT ONCE.If one is installed it is automatically sourced.Additionally it can combine commands, ie. \"pipe\", \"filter\" etc. and pass output of one program into the input of another.All those tools you use there, ls, cd, etc. are actually programs.\nImagine this as a GUI: Imagine, every button, checkbox, etc. is single program.If you install another, another checkbox/button/ w/e will appear.And now do 'ls /usr/bin'. And see how much it is - and it ain't all.\nAll those in a GUI?\nYou need to also handle all the arguments etc. In the end you would come up with a VERY cluttered GUI which is VERY unhandy to use and actually won't help a user - as the way the shell works does not change. This is also the reason it is so powerful - it is an interactive script interpreter, and extensible script language able to call whole programs, no matter in which language.\nThe trick here is to use text. The shall does not get values or objects returned but the \"API\" is plain text. This is what it makes kinda \"slow\" but also overly extensible.\nYou are typing in the terminal? No, you are scripting!\nA GUI like this would fail like all the programming languages that try to be GUI-only.\nAnother approach, however, might be successful:\nMake only mostly used programs into a GUI or make a script-library GUI interface for most-used stuff. Beg the programmers to ALSO create a GUI ;-)\nBut: They won't do (mostly). Also because the shell will almost always work. For a GUI you need graphics.\n", "Q: Can't run make - gcc: command not found I'm trying to follow a tutorial to get CudaMiner working on Linux.

When I'm working there and I make an error in an html tag right away a big red warning pops up in the companion \"view\" screen and then I stop and set right the error.\nThe key feature I'm looking for is this code violation notification. Other features would be snytax highlighting and search and replace. And it would be nice if it was available for free.\n\nA: Sublime Text 2 should do the job, accompanied by the SublimeLinter plugin.\nBluefish is a (financially) free option, accompanied by weblint (which only supports HTML4 and not HTML5).\n", "Q: nvcc not found, but only when using sudo I can't get ANYTHING working on linux. I'm trying to compile CudaMiner. Output of sudo make:\nypt-jane.o `test -f 'scrypt-jane.cpp' || echo './'`scrypt-jane.cpp\nmv -f .deps/cudaminer-scrypt-jane.Tpo .deps/cudaminer-scrypt-jane.Po\nnvcc -g -O2 -Xptxas \"-abi=no -v\" -arch=compute_10 --maxrregcount=64 --ptxas-options=-v -I./compat/jansson -o salsa_kernel.o -c salsa_kernel.cu\n/bin/bash: nvcc: command not found\nmake[2]: *** [salsa_kernel.o] Error 127\nmake[2]: Leaving directory `/var/progs/CudaMiner'\nmake[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/var/progs/CudaMiner'\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\n\nSo, kind of interesting. Output of nvcc:\nnvcc fatal   : No input files specified; use option --help for more information\n\nWhereas the output of sudo nvcc:\nsudo: nvcc: command not found\n\nI have identical exports listed in ~/.bashrc AND /etc/bash.bashrc. (Nvcc is located in: /usr/local/cuda-5.0/bin/nvcc)\nI also tried changing the current path, to no avail:\n$ sudo bash -c 'echo $PATH'\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n$ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda-5.0/bin/nvcc\n$ sudo bash -c 'echo $PATH'\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: So apparently, nvcc is not on the PATH when you run it with sudo. You can confirm this with:\nsudo bash -c 'echo $PATH'\n\nThe easiest solution is to call sudo with the absolute path of nvcc:\nsudo $(which nvcc)\n\nWhen running commands without absolute path like nvcc, sudo uses the value of the secure_path configuration in /etc/sudoers as the PATH, for example in my system:\nDefaults        secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\"\n\nSo even if you set PATH in one of the startup files that the shell normally sources, it won't work. If you want to make sudo nvcc work temporarily, just to get your build working, I think you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the installer script and change the lines with sudo nvcc to sudo /path/to/nvcc\n\n*Create a symlink to nvcc in one of the directories listed in secure_path, like this: sudo ln -s /path/to/nvcc /sbin/nvcc\nUPDATE\nIf you have a hard time finding the path of nvcc, you can try these commands, in this order (they get slower and slower), until you find a match:\nwhich nvcc\nfind /usr/local/cuda-5.0 -name nvcc\nfind /usr/local/ -name nvcc\nfind /opt -name nvcc\nfind / -name nvcc\n\n\nA: You can use -E option of sudo to preserve your user environment. From the man page:\n -E, --preserve-env\n             Indicates to the security policy that the user wishesto preserve their existing environment\n             variables.  The security policy may return an error if the user does not have permission to\n             preserve the environment.\n\nYou can test this with:\n$ sudo bash -c 'echo $PATH'\n\nand then\nsudo nvcc\n\n\nA: The cause might be a read-only folder. In my case the 'Make' file that calls nvcc was in a read-only folder. Changing the folder permission settings solved my problem.\n", "Q: No brightness control in Ubuntu 12.04, Lenovo V570 I have been struggling now for an inordinate amount of time trying to get the brightness adjustment working in Ubuntu.\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04 on a Lenovo V570 Laptop.\nI have tried all of the adjustments I can find to \"fix brightness control\" in the /etc/default/grub file with the following results (before you ask, yes I did run sudo update-grub and sudo reboot after each change):\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=\"\nResult: No response to buttons, slider has no affect.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\nResult: No response to buttons, slider has no affect.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"splash quiet acpi_osi='!Windows 2012'\"\nResult: Limited response to buttons from OS (slider only moves down one tick, then sticks), no dimming, slider has no affect.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"splash quiet\"\nResult: OS responds to buttons, but screen does not dim.  Slider has no affect.\nAm I missing something?  What can I do to adjust the brightness?\nUpdate:\nI did more searching, and I found that in /sys/class/backlight I have both acpi_video0 and intel_backlight.  By changing the \"brightness\" file in each of these folders, I discovered, that editing the /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness changed the actual brightness setting on my screen.\nHow do I get Ubuntu to adjust this setting?  Any hope of getting my function keys to also adjust it?\nUpdate2:\nAs requested, here is the output from lspci:\n    $ lspci | grep VGA\n    00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n\n\nA: I had the same problem on my ThinkPad x240 running Ubuntu 14.04, and created a script that outputs and lets you step brightness up or down.\nThis assumes that the manual method of putting a number into /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight works, so test that first:\nsudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness <<< 500\nsudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness <<< 300\n\nThe script is here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/emning/5d3301a3f3c9420414f7\nSave it as 'brightness' somewhere in your path, make it executable and run:\nbrightness\nbrightness up\nbrightness down\n\nYou can also bind these commands to shortcut keys, even the standard brightness keys seem to work fine. I used Custom Shortcuts in KDE, but any desktop environment should work.\nNOTE: For this to work when using shortcut keys, sudo without password has to be enabled for your user.\n\nA: I was also suffering from same problem,but I found here a solution that worked for me(on Acer Aspire-5738).\nIf you have acpi_video0 and  /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness \nand changing /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness is changing your computer brightness  ,\nyou can force your system to use intel_backlight.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file 20-intel.conf in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ using following command:\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf\n\n*Now paste this\nSection \"Device\"\n        Identifier  \"card0\"\n        Driver      \"intel\"\n        Option      \"Backlight\"  \"intel_backlight\"\n        BusID       \"PCI:0:2:0\"\nEndSection\n\n*Save and logout.\n", "Q: MySQL Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' In my server, everytime I try to access MySQL I get the error:   \n\nAccess denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)\n\nwhen I try mysqladmin -u root -p password I get   \n\nAccess denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)\n\nHow can I access MySQL in my Ubuntu server 12.04?\n\nA: I get the same symptoms when I update, but for me the fix (after killing mysql and restarting with --skip-grant-tables to get in) is to execute\nupdate mysql.user set plugin = '';\n\nThe update process likes to set this column to \"unix_socket\". I don't know what that is supposed to accomplish, but for me it breaks everything.\n\nA: I solved my problem with this:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt install mysql-server\n\nBe extremely responsible. With this solution, you are removing MySql server and all of its data.\n\nA: The same as Ulrich Metzger, after upgrading my machine to Ubuntu 16.04 and Mysql-server-5.7, I couldn't log in with root because the plugin column changed.\nMy problem was not solved with sudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.7 + removing + purging + cleaning.\nI had to stop the mysql service:\n# sudo service mysql stop\nThen restart the mysql daemon with the --no-grant-tables option:\n# sudo mysqld_safe --no-grant-tables &\nThen in another terminal, enter the mysql console (which now doesn't need authentication) with the command mysql, and update the password and plugin columns via a SQL UPDATE:\nUPDATE mysql.user \n  SET authentication_string=PASSWORD(''), \n      plugin='mysql_native_password'\nWHERE User='root' AND Host='localhost';\n\nFinally, kill the mysqld_safe command, restart mysql service and connect to mysql normally:\n# sudo service mysql start\n# mysql\n\n\nA: Set a password for mysql\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.x\n\nNow open the terminal and type\nmysql -uroot -p\n\ngive password and press enter\n\nA: After completely reinstalling mysql (thinking that I was using the incorrect password) I ended up with the same problem, but eventually found Ivan Black's comment above which did the trick:\nsudo mysql -u root -p\nWhy I should need elevated privileges to log in with the root user is beyond me.\n\nA: After upgrading from ubuntu 14.4LTS to 16.4LTS the mysql root user could no more login due a wrong entry in the mysql user table's plugin column.\nThe upgrade sets the plugin value for the root@localhost user to auth_socket but the correct entry must be mysql_native_password, if you used mysql native password encryption before.\n\nA: If you're running n localhost, just type the command below in terminal:\nmysql -u root -p\n\nIf you're using an external server, enter the host IP (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) as well:\nmysql -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -uroot -p\n\nYou will be prompted for your password, enter it and you will be able to access your MySQL prompt.\nYou can also look at this answer on how to reset your MySQL password.\n", "Q: Why do Disk utility and Gparted show different information for the same hdd(s)? Gparted and Disks utility give me different sizes for my hard drive and its partitions. Is there a reason, for both programs, to list different information or is it an error?\nGParted & Terminal output: sudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL \n\ndev/sda = 298.1 Gib\n   /dev/sda3 = 191.40 GiB\n   /dev/sda4 = 92 GiB\n   /dev/sda5 = 88.40 GiB\n   /dev/sda6 = 3.60 GiB\n\nDisks Utility output\n\ndev/sdb = 320 Gib\n    /dev/sda3 = 206 GiB\n    /dev/sda4 = 99 GiB\n    /dev/sda5 = 95 GiB\n    /dev/sda6 = 3.9 GiB  \n\n\nA: The result shown by sudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL performs calculations using the binary prefix i.e. multiples of 1024 (which is 210). So 500107862016 bytes would be equal to 465.76 GB or approximately 466 GB. (You can use -b switch to print in bytes instead of human readable as sudo lsblk -b -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL.)\nCalculation:\n\n500107862016 bytes = (500107862016 / (1024 ^ 3)) GB = 465.76 GB\n\nWhile Disks Utility uses decimal prefix for calculation so expressed as multiples of 1000. So 500107862016 bytes here would mean 500.11 GB or 500 GB approx.\nCalculation:\n\n500107862016 bytes = (500107862016 / (1000 ^ 3)) GB = 500.11 GB\n\n\nA: Just a guess but I would assume that the terminal command is giving you the actual size of a partition, while gparted is giving you the size available using the current allocation size settings. When you format a partition the filesystem uses an allocation size (also called cluster size), the larger the size the less storage you get due to inefficient usage, but you can get faster write speeds as a tradeoff when writing large files. \n\nA: I don't know this for a fact, but I would assume that Disk Utility is telling you the actual size, and Gparted is telling you the functioning size, since the filesystem and partition table take some room. Allocation sizes aren't a factor, because they don't take up space, it's merely a setting.\n", "Q: How to install Subtitle Edit 3.3? I'm a subtitle translator in Sri Lanka.

When I run gsettings get com.ubuntu.update-manager launch-time the response is 1382579402. What does the value of 1382579402 mean?\n\nA: That's presumably a time in Unix epoch format, i.e. seconds since 01/01/1970 UTC.

Right now, 14.04 is in active development, the detailed Release Schedule of which is hosted here. One can see that the schedule says Alpha 1, Alpha 2 and Beta 1 are for opt-in flavors only.\nCan someone please explain the concept of opt-in flavors? What are they and what is different compared to flavors which have opted-out? Who decides upon them and how do I know which flavors have opted-in for a particular development cycle? Do the flavors which have opted-in change between the Alphas and the Betas? And all the points which would help me understand why they are important and have a separate distinction.\n\nA: Ubuntu has many derivatives, or 'flavors'.\nKubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu are some of them. Each of these are maintained independently, by their communities. These variants have the freedom to participate in these alpha and beta releases, or have their own schedules, or skip some of them.\nUsually, ubuntu as a project cares about only the officially recognized derivatives. Being an unofficial derivative means that it doesn't get access to some perks. For example, unofficial derivatives are off-topic on Ask Ubuntu.\nTo know if a project opted in, you need to check with the project itself.\n", "Q: booting without full network configuration 13.10 Recently I tried to install connman which removed network manager and some other dependencies.

Apt and other utilities ask dpkg to do its job.\ndpkg can not handle dependencies automatically. You either figure out dependencies, fetch all those packages and give them to dpkg all at once, or deal with the unmet dependencies mess. Apt handles this, and that is what I believe its primary use. Apt also brings in some fancy stuff. Look at its conf files for the full details.\nBarring the dependency handling, the remove commands are equivalent. The only difference is apt refuses to remove a package that others depend on, without removing them, and it can be set up to remove automatically the packages that no one else needs as a dependency.\n", "Q: Backing up 2 computers I have 2 laptops that i would like to have the same videos, pictures, and documents on. both run Ubuntu, both have a media partition with mostly the same videos and stuff on them.

I downloaded several programs that are supposed to support this file format like Gnome Subtitles, but none of them works properly.\nI keep getting the following error, even when I specify Open with:\n\n\nA: A .srt file contains simple text in it. If you want to open a .srt file, open it with your favourite text editor to see the contents.\nIf you want to use the .srt file as subtitle with a video.

Here is my boot repair output.\nHow can i solve this problem?\n\nA: try this solution:\nFirst boot on your Windows installation DVD and navigate to the section repair your computerif it finds your Windows installation, make sure it is unselected before clicking next, then click on Command prompt and run:\nbootrec.exe /fixboot\n\nbootrec.exe /fixmbr\n\nthen reboot and remove your installation DVD\nif you don't have the installation DVD you can get Windows repair disk (Win7 example) manually created.\nJust in case if after all facing any issues yet check on this\n\nA: You've got a mixed-mode (BIOS/EFI) installation: Windows is installed in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode on /dev/sdb and Ubuntu is installed in EFI/UEFI mode on /dev/sda. (Most such mixed-mode installations go the other way around.) Getting dual-boot working with OSes installed in differing modes is awkward at best and impossible at worst.\nGiven that Windows is less flexible that Linux on this score, my recommendation is to install a BIOS-mode version of GRUB for Linux. Try it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Linux.\n\n*Using GParted, parted, or gdisk, create a ~1MiB partition at the very end of the disk. If you use GParted or parted, give it a bios_grub flag. If you use gdisk, give it a type code of EF02. It's possible that GParted and/or parted will balk at creating such a small partition, but gdisk will definitely do it.\n\n*Reboot to a Linux live CD. Boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. This can usually be achieved by selecting a boot option in the firmware's built-in boot manager that lacks the string \"EFI\" or \"UEFI.\" Unfortunately, the exact procedures vary greatly from one computer to another, so you may need to experiment or ask for more help on this point.\n\n*Run Boot Repair again and tell it to re-install GRUB.\n\n\nAt this point, you should be able to boot into both Linux and Windows in BIOS mode, with GRUB controlling the boot process. You might need to fiddle with your boot options to get a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boot to work as the default, though.\nUnfortunately, some EFIs have bugs that can complicate matters with BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode booting from GPT disks. Check this Web page if you have problems getting GRUB to come up in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. In a worst-case scenario, you might need to convert /dev/sda from GPT to MBR.\nThe alternative to this is to convert Windows to boot in EFI mode. This will require converting /dev/sdb from MBR to GPT and installing an EFI-mode Windows boot loader.

I'm using the try option because for some reason it won't let me do a full install.  I researched and realized that may have to erase my entire hard drive before I can do a reinstall.  If this is the case I would like to know if there is anyway I can retrieve the data I had store on my partition.  Under the try option I don't have permission to access my own files and am unsure if I can recover them if I do a hard reset.  If anyone has any helpful suggestions I would appreciate it.\nI tried all the helpful suggestions and none of them worked so instead I just re-installed 12.04 back on my hard-drive.  I was able to recover videos I had stored but none of the documents that I had saved.  Thanks for the help.  \n\nA: If all fails, there is another option that will work almost for sure if the drive is not broken:\nAt least one of your partitions (not the data partition) needs to be large enough to contain the system (6GB). \nIf that is the case, start the installer (\"Install Ubuntu\") and walk through the steps until the window: \"installation type\". Choose \"something else\". \nIn the partition overview (in the next window), select the partition you need to save the data from, and choose \"change\" (next to the +/-). Choose the same filesystem as the partition already is, set the mount point to /rescue or something. \nAssign the swap partition (it is already there) and do not reformat /rescue. Set the mountpoint of one of the other partionos to / and install Ubuntu. After installation is finished, the files will be in /rescue.\nIf you do not have a \"spare\" partition, you would have to resize the data partition first to be able to create a partition that can hold the system.\n\nA: \"Crashed\" could mean many things. Perhaps you just borked grub, so you can't boot. Maybe the disk drive is truly dead. First thing to do is not write anything to the disk drive you want to salvage until you know a bit more. \nSince you're able to boot to a live USB, sudo fdisk -l in a terminal menu should show you all the drives your live USB booted system sees. If the hard drive in question is listed, that's a good sign.\nNow you have to decide what that information on the drive is worth to you. If you have a recent backup, you might want to move ahead with a re-format and reinstall, wiping everything and starting over. If you don't have a recent backup, and there's something you really don't think you can lose, you could perhaps use dd to make a bit-by-bit copy of the questionable drive onto a USB drive of larger capacity, then try to recover data from that copy so you don't destroy the original.\nOf course, it the live USB Ubuntu you're booting from doesn't see the drive, you're probably hosed.\n", "Q: Wireless driver (Relink RT3290) not working I'm having HP ProBook 450 and Ubuntu 13.10 with 3.11 kernel.

Should be put after the -x option, i.e.:\nhttping -x localhost:1080 -5 -g http://google.com\n\n\n*-c - How many probes to send before exiting. Infinite by default.\n\n*-G - Do a GET request instead of a HEAD request. That means that also full page/file will be transferred. Note that in this case you're no longer measuring the latency! Useful for testing actual websites.\n\n\nBe noticed that the time measured also includes the latency introduced by the proxy server itself.\n\nThe utility is available through a number of repositories for different OS'es and Linux distros:\nUbuntu:\nsudo apt install httping\n\nAlpine:\nsudo apk add httping\n\nmacOS with Homebrew:\nbrew install httping\n\n\nHere is a link to the author's website:\nhttps://www.vanheusden.com/httping/\n\nA: For bash commands you have to set the proxy seperately. For this, you have to set a environment variable, e.g.:\nping google.com    # can't resolve, no proxy set\nexport http_proxy=proxy.example.com:1234\nping google.com    # works, proxy set for this bash session.\n\nReplace the address and the port with your proxy configuration. If you're always behind this proxy, add the export http_proxy... command to ~/.bashrc so it gets executed every time you start a new bash session.\nOr to execute a single command with proxy settings and without setting environment variables, use env, e.g.:\nenv http_proxy=proxy.example.com:1234 ping google.com\nsudo env http_proxy=proxy.example.com:1234 apt-get install cowsay\n\nTo use other services, e.g. HTTPS or FTP you have to set different variables:\nexport https_proxy=proxy.example.com:1234\nexport ftp_proxy=proxy.example.com:1234\n\n\nA: Try this:\nOpen a terminal.

I tried the -lm option in every variety I could find online. When I worked in GCC 4.7.3 I just had to add the -lm in the end and it worked, for example: gcc -o test test.c -lm. Another thing. In /usr/lib/gcc/i686-linux-gnu folder I found 4.7  4.7.3  4.8  4.8.1 folders. Is it some conflict the new version is having with old ones? And is it just GCC which has changed the procedures of -lm?

When you ran\nls -l /usr/include/stdio.h /usr/include/math.h\n\nthe output indicated that header files are missing from that directory, including stdio.h and math.h (the two headers with which you seem to have had problems). And GCC's error message says it can't find header files.\nTherefore, replacing missing header files will likely solve this problem. Searching the Ubuntu packages database reveals /usr/include/stdio.h and /usr/include/math.h are provided by the libc6-dev package. Therefore, reinstalling the libc6-dev package should fix the problem:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get --reinstall install libc6-dev\n\n", "Q: In the CurrencyConverter Ubuntu SDK QML example where does the index variable come from?

I have a really old Compaq presario, I recently just wiped it clean and started again. I put Windows 7 on but, half way through installing it ran out of battery... Thinking nothing of it I just done it again, I partitioned my harddrive installed Ununtu 12.04.4.\nNo all went well, it ran fine it ran better than before infact, Ubuntu ran smoothly and I had no troubles (apart from getting used to it)  so anyway. Today I was looking in disc management and noticed my hard drive was in 4 parts... Long story short I deleted Ubuntu partiton and on reboot it went to the grub recovery etc etc.\nI didn't want to bother anyone on here with n00b like question, but. I tried everything on askubuntu I tried the ls (hd0,msdos1/2/3) etc I tried to fix the graphics thingy in the purple screen? Everytjing. \nI tried to reboot windows to repair partition or whatever, but when I load it up it either has a black screen with a flashing  ' - '  or it will say \n'Press any key to boot from DVD' etc I push a key and then it just goes black and my disc drive makes sounds as though it's working?\nIs this a problem I can fix ? Or is my computer ruined?\nSorry for bad spelling grammar I'm doing this on my phone quickly. \nOkay, here is a more detailed( I hope anyway) version of the above taking into account everything I have been told just a minuet ago.\nOkay, I'll try and break it down as easy as possible. So, set up computer > it ran fine > today I deleted the partition that had Ubuntu on it. I restarted my computer and was confronted with Grub rescue> I looked up how I could recover partition I.e the ls (hd0,msdos1 or 2 etc and everytime on every code it came back with 'unknown filesystem' \nso from here I looked what else it might be. Someone suggested I run windows through disc and repair windows. Which leads me to the black screen with a flashing  ' - ' OR if it asks me to press any key to boot from CD or DVD, I would press enter and my disc drive would make the noises it normally does when working, but the screen would just be black. \nSO I tried to go into BIOS fix some settings in there, save&exit > comp restarts > exactly the same things happen. \nnow if I have the Ubuntu disc in, SOMETIMES it will have the grub rescue screen and sometimes it will come up with the purple screen and the two icons at the bottom of the screen, now, if I press a key SOMETIMES it will go to a still screen with UBUNTU(not the loading one it's just the logo) on it and nothing will happen, other times it won't do anything? \nI just tried to have a look at one of the answers about Nomodeset as that sounds like what's up? But every code I punched in(even the one that's potentially dangerous for fan etc) it will just start a new line like I didn't out any code in at all? I really hope that's a bit clearer. Forgot to mention as well that once or twice it has gone to the Ubuntu load up screen as if it's starting up normally? But it won't go any further than that? I really hope that's a bit clearer. Thank you for you time hope I haven't made you all rip your hair out.   \n\nA: Your computer is fine. I can't give you the details with the information you have provided but it looks like you simply deleted the partition that held your Ubuntu install. The simplest thing to do would be to reinstall Ubuntu.\nIf you have indeed deleted the partition that held Ubuntu, reinstalling is the only thing you can do apart from restoring from backups and that wouldn't be very easy either. Your Windows install should not have been affected and you should be able to recover everything once you reinstall. \n\nA: You can start on a live-dvd and install testdisk. The recovery of a deleted partition can be easy if you haven't done any modifications to your HDD since the error. \nWith that tool, you should be able to recover your disk as it was. It worths at least a try. \n", "Q: Why do shells call fork()? When a process is started from a shell, why does the shell fork itself before executing the process?\nFor example, when the user inputs grep blabla foo, why can't the shell just call exec() on grep without a child shell?\nAlso, when a shell forks itself within a GUI terminal emulator, does it start another terminal emulator? (such as pts/13 starting pts/14)\n\nA: When you call an exec family method, it doesn't create a new process. Instead, exec replaces the current process memory and instruction set etc., with the process you want to run.\nAs an example: you want to run grep using exec\nbash is a process (which has separate memory, address space). Now when you call exec(grep), exec will replace the current process's memory, address space, instruction set etc. with grep's data.\nThat means the bash process will no longer exist.\nAs a result, you can't get back to terminal after completing the grep command.\nThat's why exec family methods never return. You can't execute any code after exec; it is unreachable.\n\nA: As per the pts, check it yourself: in a shell, run \necho $$ \n\nto know your process-id (PID), I have for example \necho $$\n29296\n\nThen run for example sleep 60 and then, in another terminal \n(0)samsung-romano:~% ps -edao pid,ppid,tty,command | grep 29296 | grep -v grep\n29296  2343 pts/11   zsh\n29499 29296 pts/11   sleep 60\n\nSo no, in general you have the same tty associated to the process. (Note that this is your sleep because it has your shell as the parent). \n\nA: For each command ( example: grep) that you issue on the bash prompt, you actually intend to start a new process and then return to bash prompt after execution. \nIf the shell process ( bash) calls exec() to run grep, the shell process will be replaced with grep. Grep will work fine but after execution, the control cannot return to the shell because bash process is already replaced.\nFor this reason, bash calls fork(), which does not replace the current process.\n\nA: TL;DR: Because this is the optimal method for creating new processes and keeping control in interactive shell\nfork() is necessary for processes and pipes\nTo answer the specific part of this question, if grep blabla foo were to be called via exec() directly in parent, parent would seize to exist, and its PID with all the resources would be taken over by grep blabla foo. \nHowever, let's talk in general about exec() and fork(). The key reason for such behavior is because fork()/exec() is the standard method of creating a new process on Unix/Linux, and this isn't a bash specific thing; this method has been in place since the beginning and influenced by this same method from already existing operating systems of the time. To somewhat paraphrase goldilocks's answer on a related question, fork() for creating new process is easier since the kernel has less work to do as far as allocating resources goes, and a lot of the properties ( such as file descriptors, environment, etc) - all can be inherited from the parent process ( in this case from bash).\nSecondly, as far as interactive shells go, you can't run an external command without forking. To launch an executable which lives on disk (for example, /bin/df -h ), you have to call one of exec() family functions, such as execve(), which will replace the parent with the new process, take over its PID and existing file descriptors,etc. For interactive shell, you want the control to return to the user and let the parent interactive shell carry on. Thus, the best way is to create a subprocess via fork(), and let that process be taken over via execve(). So interactive shell PID 1156 would spawn a child via fork() with PID 1157, then call execve(\"/bin/df\",[\"df\",\"-h\"],&environment), which makes /bin/df -h run with PID 1157. Now the shell only has to wait for process to exit and return control to it. \nIn case where you have to create a pipe between two or more commands, say df | grep, you need a way to create two file descriptors (that's read and write end of pipe which come from pipe() syscall), then somehow let two new processes inherit them. That's done forking new process and then by copying the write end of the pipe via dup2() call onto its stdout aka fd 1 (so if write end is fd 4, we do dup2(4,1)). When exec() to spawn df happens the child process will think nothing of its stdout and write to it without being aware (unless it actively checks) that its output actually goes a pipe. Same process happens to grep, except we fork(), take read end of pipe with fd 3 and dup(3,0) before spawning grep with exec(). All this time parent process is still there, waiting to regain control once pipeline done complete.\nIn case of built-in commands,generally shell doesn't fork(), with exception of source command. Subshells require fork(). \nIn short, this is a necessary and useful mechanism.\nDisadvantages of forking and optimizations\nNow, this is different for non-interactive shells, such as bash -c '<simple command>'. Despite fork()/exec() being optimal  method where you have to process many commands, it's a waste of resources when you have only one single command. To quote Stéphane Chazelas from this post:\n\nForking is expensive, in CPU time, memory, allocated file descriptors... Having a shell process lying about just waiting for another process before exiting is just a waste of resources. Also, it makes it difficult to correctly report the exit status of the separate process that would execute the command (for instance, when the process is killed).\n\nTherefore, many shells ( not just bash ) use exec() to allow that bash -c '' to be taken over by that single simple command. And exactly for the reasons stated above, minimizing pipelines in shell scripts is better. Often you can see beginners do something like this:\ncat /etc/passwd | cut -d ':' -f 6 | grep '/home'\n\nOf course, this will fork() 3 processes. This is a simple example, but consider a large file, in range of Gigabytes. It'd be far more efficient with one process:\nawk -F':' '$6~\"/home\"{print $6}' /etc/passwd\n\nWaste of resources actually can be a form of Denial of Service attack, and in particular fork bombs are created via shell functions that call themselves in pipeline, which forks multiple copies of themselves. Nowadays, this is mitigated via limiting maximum number of processes in cgroups on systemd, which Ubuntu also uses since version 15.04.\nOf course that doesn't mean forking is just bad. It's still a useful mechanism as discussed before, but  in case where you can get away with less processes, and consecutively less resources and thus better performance, then you should avoid fork() if possible. \nSee also\n\n\n*\n\n*Why do we need to fork to create new processes?\n\n*What is the difference between “Redirection” and “Pipe”?\n", "Q: Gnome session log getting too large Under my user a hidden system folder .cache/upstart/ is getting insanely large - 99G.

Gayan explains that Pulseaudio manages the audio of the software to Alsa and Alsa manages the audio to the hardware. Pulseaudio will have mishandling problems when passing the audio data to Alsa once in a blue moon. Simply removing Pulseaudio and allowing Alsamixer to take over removed all audio mishandlings.\n", "Q: Brightness in ubuntu 12.04 Well this is a common problem as i have seen through my google searches but i didn't manage to find any satisfactory solution so far. I got my laptop recently which came with windows 8 pre-installed.I decided to install ubuntu (i had it in my former laptop) but the main problem is that when ubuntu starts the brightness is 0 be default(my laptop has a backlit button too). I can use the Fn buttons to change back to what i want but i wondered if there is a solution after all. The only solutions i found so far set the brightness in a default value which fix the low brightness problem after the start up but i cant control the brightness with the fn buttons afterwards. If anyone has a solution please share. Thanks in advance.\nps my laptop is Lenovo G510\n\nA: Well this might be a workaround\nEdit you rc.local file which will run on each startup,\nsudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nto write there something like,\necho 100 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nor \necho 100 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\ndepending on what defines your system brightness.\nyou can find out which brightness value is best for you by looking in the \"actual_brightness\" file. Then change the 100 for that number.\n", "Q: Automatic say yes to make ext3 file system on disk with mkfs.ext3 I am working on a script where I make a ext3 filesystem on a disk, the problem is that the script ask user to either say yes or no:\n root@ubuntu:/home/school#  mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdc\n mke2fs 1.42 (29-Nov-2011)\n /dev/sdc is entire device, not just one partition!\n Proceed anyway? (y,n)\n\nI have tried to put -y before mkfs and after sdc but that didnt work. Do anyone have any solutions to do this without user interaction?\n\nA: There is no -y option for mkfs.ext3, you can check by readin its manual page (man mkfs.ext3). However, there is a program called yes that is specifically designed to do what you want:\nNAME\n   yes - output a string repeatedly until killed\n\nSo, you could run:\n yes | mkfs.ext3  /dev/sdc\n\nHowever, bear in mind that you are attempting to create a filesystem on the entire device instead of on a single partition and this is probably not what you want to do. You should first create a partition on the disk and then create a filesystem on that partition.\n\nA: You should probably not make a filesystem on an entire disk. Instead, you should make it on a partition on the disk (which would be something like /dev/sdc1 rather than /dev/sdc). If you don't already have a partition you can make that first. The partition can (essentially) be the size of the whole disk, if you like. Even when you only want one partition on the disk, you still need to actually make the partition. Many utilities and applications (and people!) will not work, or will behave strangely, if your filesystems are not on partitions.\nIf you really know what you are doing and you're sure you want to make a filesystem that is not part of any partition, you can do make mkfs.ext3 do this without prompting the user, by using the -F flag. This is almost always preferable to simulating interactive input with a pipe (it's simpler, more self-documenting, and what if something unexpected happens and the question is something else, like the device already being mounted?). On the other hand, in some situations (with some utilities) you may find you have to pipe y or yes to a utility, so it's a good technique to be aware of.\nFrom the description of the -F flag in man mkfs.ext3:\n\nForce mke2fs to create  a  filesystem,  even  if  the  specified\n  device is not a partition on a block special device, or if other\n  parameters do not make sense.   In  order  to  force  mke2fs to\n  create  a filesystem even if the filesystem appears to be in use or is\n  mounted (a truly dangerous thing to do), this option  must be\n  specified twice.\n\nSo, you can use mkfs.ext3 -F /dev/sdc.\nBut, to reiterate, you should probably not do this at all because filesystems should almost always be created on a partition.\n", "Q: Corosync & Pacemaker IPTables Rules When using Corosync with two rings via multi-cast addresses 226.94.1.1 (Port \n5405) & 226.94.1.2 (Port 5406) what iptables rules are required to allow two \nnodes to communicate optimally without giving any undue access and making the \nrules too lenient?\nI current have:\niptables -A INPUT -p udp -m multiport --dports 5404,5405,5406 -j ACCEPT\n\nWill that allow all the communication a Corosync/Pacemaker setup requires for \nboth rings?\nI have heard arguments that something like:\niptables -I INPUT 1 -m pkttype --pkt-type multicast -j ACCEPT\n\nis required. However I cannot seem to replicate a situation where this assists \nif the first rule I listed above is already in place.\nThe Red Hat documentation would seem to support the first approach. There is \nsome IBM documentation espousing the second but is it just a case of a rule \nthat is far too lenient when the first would do the job equally well whilst \nleaving no unnecessary ports open?\nI'm leaning more towards the first rule being sufficient but wanted to get some more opinions on the matter.\n\nA: The documentation from Red Hat and IBM specifies rules that actually allow more packets than are really needed.\nMulticast IP packets are really not much different from unicast IP packets, the only difference (in addition to the way how they are sent on Layer 2 and routed) is the destination address, which must be in the range 224.0.0.0/4.\nAs described on Server Fault, the following rules can be used for a single Corosync ring (assuming that the OUTPUT chain does not block any traffic):\niptables -A INPUT -p igmp -i $corosync_interface -j ACCEPT\nfor src_addr in $ip_addr_self $ip_addr_partner1 $ip_addr_partner2; do\n  iptables -A INPUT -i $corosync_interface -s $src_addr -d $ip_addr_self \\\n    -p udp --source-port $(($corosync_port - 1)) \\\n    --destination-port $corosync_port -j ACCEPT\n  iptables -A INPUT -i $corosync_interface -s $src_addr -d $ip_addr_mcast \\\n    -p udp --source-port $(($corosync_port - 1)) \\\n    --destination-port $corosync_port -j ACCEPT\ndone\n\nIn this example, the following variables are assumed to be defined:\n\n\n*\n\n*$corosync_interface: the network interface which is used by Corosync\n\n*$ip_addr_self: the IP address to which Corosync binds locally (specified as bindnetaddr in corosync.conf)\n\n*$ip_addr_partner1, $ip_addr_partner2: the IP addresses of the other Corosync nodes - more can be added if the cluster has more than three nodes.\n\n*$ip_addr_mcast: the multicast address used for Corosync (specified as mcastaddr in corosync.conf)\n\n*$corosync_port: the (destination) port used by Corosync (specified as mcastport in corosync.conf)\n\n\nFor multiple rings, the same approach can be used with the interface name, IP addresses and port numbers changed to match the respective definitions.\nIn comparison to the rules specified in the documentation, the rules above are restricted to specific interfaces, source addresses and source ports and the destination port is limited to a single port. Actually, Corosync does not send packets to more than one destination port, it just uses a different port (destination port minus one) for sending data than for receiving data.\n", "Q: Ubuntu not connecting to switch box I recently took my dad's old computer to use at a multimedia server, but when i hooked it up to the Ethernet switch (the computer sits under my desk so my main computer shares the switch) and it says its connected but i cant even access my router page.

This sequence of commands makes my ALC898-based Audigy Fx PCIe card work normally for as long as the system is booted. If you find that these commands reliably make the card work, you might be able to put similar commands into a script in /etc/rc.local. This workaround is not ideal but is good enough for my purposes.\n\nA: It's a Realtek ALC898 based sound card...\nYou'd better use the motherboard's integrated (probably very similar) codec.\nPlease see this: http://support.creative.com/kb/ShowArticle.aspx?sid=120331\nCreative is not a real friend of an opensource community.\nThey've killed the Canadian Advanced Gravis Computer Technology and later the Aureal Semiconductor.

This question tells you everything you need to know about my graphic card.\nYesterday I had a problem, my graphic card driver failed, now if I login to xubuntu default desktop, all I see is a black screen however I can login to xfce session\nThe output of inxi -G:\nGraphics:  Card-1: Intel 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller \n           Card-2: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD/ATI] Seymour [Radeon HD 6400M/7400M Series] \n           X.Org: 1.14.5 drivers: fglrx,intel Resolution: 1366x768@60.0hz \n           GLX Renderer: AMD Radeon HD 6400M Series GLX Version: 4.2.12337 - CPC 13.101\n\n\n\nxsession-errors\nScript for cjkv started at run_im.\nScript for default started at run_im.\nopenConnection: connect: No such file or directory\ncannot connect to brltty at :0\nXsession: X session started for elie at Mon Mar 10 10:16:26 EET 2014\nlocaluser:elie being added to access control list\nopenConnection: connect: No such file or directory\ncannot connect to brltty at :0\nScript for cjkv started at run_im.\nScript for default started at run_im.\nScript for cjkv started at run_im.\nScript for default started at run_im.\nlibGL error: failed to load driver: i965\nlibGL error: Try again with LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose for more details.\ngnome-session-is-accelerated: llvmpipe detected.\nx-session-manager[2113]: CRITICAL: We failed, but the fail whale is dead.

Sorry....\n\n/var/log/Xorg.0.log.old and /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Note that I no longer  have xorg.conf, because I followed the answers below, but even if I generate new file, It will be looking like the file above, I tried it.\n\nA: Your xorg.conf has two device sections:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"aticonfig-Device[0]-0\"\n    Driver      \"fglrx\"\n    BusID       \"PCI:1:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"intel\"\n    Driver      \"intel\"\n    Option      \"AccelMethod\" \"uxa\"\nEndSection\n\nThis is causing your machine to attempt to load both the fglrx and the intel drivers. While it is actually possible to use multiple graphics cards on Linux, I doubt you can do that with an integrated (intel) and a dedicated (ATI) one. It is very likely that removing the intel section will return everything to normal (assuming the fglrx driver works on your system but as I understand it used to, so it probably will). So, comment out the intel section and keep only fglrx:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"aticonfig-Device[0]-0\"\n    Driver      \"fglrx\"\n    BusID       \"PCI:1:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\n#Section \"Device\"\n#    Identifier  \"intel\"\n#    Driver      \"intel\"\n#    Option      \"AccelMethod\" \"uxa\"\n#EndSection\n\nThen restart X and, assuming there is no other issue, everything should be fine.\nIf not, you can try creating a new xorg.conf using ATI's configuration tool, aticonfig:\nsudo aticonfig --initial\n\nIf you do go down this road, I also recommend you read through that program's options, they're quite extensive:\naticonfig --help | less\n\nFinally, the Arch wiki page on ATI/AMD cards is a great source of information on this kind of thing.\n\nA: Try to purge the GC drivers and reinstall:\nsudo apt-get purge fglrx fglrx-pxpress\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nsudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-pxpress\n\nIf that doesn't fix it, time to  edit XConfigs!\n\nA: I think you could try to uninstall first your third-party driver.\nThen try deletesudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf and reboot.\nXSERVER will create a new one.\n\nA: A shot in the dark --- let's suppose is not the graphic drivers. What is failing seems to be the x-session-manager script, due to a bug in libGL. \nSo I would try: \n1) calling manually startx in a terminal. If the graphic screen appears, the drivers are working ok, and the problem is somewhere else. (You'll probably have just one naked terminal in it). \n2) Try to reconfigure gdm or lightdm. By the way, I could not start xubuntu desktop with lightdm windows manager, I had to install gdm. So could be \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm \n\nAnd/or the corresponding sudo apt-get install gdm if you do not have it. \n3) going deeper, it may be the 3D graphics failing. Have you installed xorg-edgers or something like that? Maybe it is a recent bug in it.  \n4) and as a last resort, you can try some non-accelerated desktop, like Gnome classic or Ubuntu 2D. \n5) Try to login as a guest user to see if the problem is related to some strange configuration file.\n6) and as a voodoo-kind of thing: check is there is some strange dot file (with  ls - lad .*) owned by root stick in your home dir --- I once had a $DEITY-know-how-was-there .Xauthority file owned by root that blocked all my logins...  \nHope this helps... but probably not. \n", "Q: wget and encoded URL I have a URL like this:\nhttp://dl.minitoons.ir/longs/Khumba (2013) [EN] [BR-Rip 720p] - [www.minitoons.ir].rar\n\nI want to download this URL using wget. If I pass it directly to wget, everything goes well. But I am in a situation that I have only the encoded versions of download URLs. If I pass the encoded version of the URL above to wget, it throws the following error:\n$ wget \"http%3A%2F%2Fdl.minitoons.ir%2Flongs%2FKhumba%20(2013)%20%5BEN%5D%20%5BBR-Rip%20720p%5D%20-%20%5Bwww.minitoons.ir%5D.rar\"\nwget: unable to resolve host address `http://dl.minitoons.ir/longs/khumba (2013) [en] [br-rip 720p] - [www.minitoons.ir].rar'\n\nNotice that wget changed the casing of URL (for example Khumba to khumba). What should I do to solve this problem?\n\nA: You should use it like this \nwget \"http://dl.minitoons.ir/longs/Khumba%20(2013)%20[EN]%20[BR-Rip%20720p]%20-%20[www.minitoons.ir].rar\"`\n\nJust replace every space with %20 .\nOr Better copy your original link and paste it in Chromium Browser address bar. It will automatically format it for you. Now copy it from there to your terminal.\n\nA: Wget expects the URL to have the following format:\n[protocol://]host/path\n\nThe protocol is optional. In absence of protocol, Wget assumes HTTP.\nWget accepts percent-encoded URLs just fine, but the delimiters between protocol, host and path cannot be percent-encoded.\nThis is also why Wget changed the casing of the URL. Since it didn't find a single unencoded slash, it assumes that\nhttp://dl.minitoons.ir/longs/khumba (2013) [en] [br-rip 720p] - [www.minitoons.ir].rar\n\nis the hostname (which would be case-insensitive). The actual hostname is, of course, dl.minitoons.ir.\nFor an automatic solution, substituting %3A%2F%2F and the %2F after the hostname by :// and / would suffice, but it's just as easy to decode the URL at one. @Wilf already gave a good solution for this.\nHowever, if you're going to type the Wget command manually, just do this:\nwget \"dl.minitoons.ir/longs%2FKhumba%20(2013)%20%5BEN%5D%20%5BBR-Rip%20720p%5D%20-%20%5Bwww.minitoons.ir%5D.rar\"\n\n\nA: As this is annoyingly so common, there are various converters available - e.g. this site. You can use these to decode the URL - so it will convert this:\nhttp%3A%2F%2Fdl.minitoons.ir%2Flongs%2FKhumba%20(2013)%20%5BEN%5D%20%5BBR-Rip%20720p%5D%20-%20%5Bwww.minitoons.ir%5D.rar\n\nto:\nhttp://dl.minitoons.ir/longs/Khumba (2013) [EN] [BR-Rip 720p] - [www.minitoons.ir].rar\n\nIt would be niCe to have a command line version though...\nEDIT:\nFound a command line version - basically:\necho \"http%3A%2F%2F-REST-OF-URL\" | sed -e's/%\\([0-9A-F][0-9A-F]\\)/\\\\\\\\\\x\\1/g' | xargs echo -e\n\nThis can be implemented in a script like this to decode the URL:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"$@\" | sed -e's/%\\([0-9A-F][0-9A-F]\\)/\\\\\\\\\\x\\1/g' | xargs echo -e\nexit\n\nwhich if saved and made executable, works quite nicely.\nalso this script, which will download the UL as well:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"$@\" | sed -e's/%\\([0-9A-F][0-9A-F]\\)/\\\\\\\\\\x\\1/g' | xargs echo -e | wget -c -i -\nexit\n\nN.B.

This should work[1], however if it doesn't, you're left with no way to boot your system.\nAnother solution would be to use Ksplice Uptrack, which allows you to update your kernel without ever rebooting. The only problem here would be that the free version only supports Ubuntu Desktop, so you'd have to pay for the service but there might be ways to use the desktop version on a server.\n1. “ubuntu just happily removed my (running!) kernel” Ubuntuforums.org\n\nA: I have a suggested solution, but I strongly recommend you try it on a local machine or in a virtual machine before futzing with your server, particularly if you can't get to it physically.\nThat caveat out of the way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount the /boot filesystem.\n\n*Disable swap space (sudo swapoff /dev/sda and likewise for /dev/sdb).\n\n*Using fdisk or parted, delete your two swap partitions and re-create them with smaller sizes and later start points. The \"later start points\" part is critical, because you want a gap between partitions 1 and 2. Also, be sure that the start points are identical on the two disks.\n\n*Using fdisk (not parted), delete partition 1 on /dev/sda and re-create it with the exact same start point and a later end point. This could be tricky. Your partition 1 on both disks has a start point of sector 63, which modern tools might be reluctant to create. Thus, you might need to dig up an old version of fdisk to get this to work.\n\n*Before saving your changes, verify that the start point of your new first partition is the same as it is now -- sector 63. If it's not, abort without saving your changes. (You can do this in fdisk by typing q or hitting Ctrl+c, but parted makes on-disk changes as soon as you type the command to make a change, which is why I said to do this with fdisk -- you can abort with fdisk but not with parted.)\n\n*If your new first partition starts on sector 63, save the changes by typing w in fdisk.\n\n*Repeat the expansion of the first partition on /dev/sdb.\n\n*Type sudo partprobe to get the kernel to recognize the changed partitions.\n\n*It may be necessary to do some RAID stuff here to get RAID to recognize the changed partitions, but I'm not positive of that.\n\n*If /boot uses ext2fs, ext3fs, or ext4fs, you can use resize2fs to resize the filesystem to fill the new size of the partitions on which it resides. Similar tools exist for other filesystems.\n\n*Create new swap space on both disks' second partitions, as in mkswap /dev/sda2.\n\n*Edit /etc/fstab to adjust the change to the swap partitions, if necessary. (They're often referenced via UUID values, which will have changed. Use blkid to learn the new UUID values; or refer to them as /dev/sda2 and /dev/sdb2.)\n\n*Use swapon to re-activate your swap space.\n\n*For an acid test, reboot.\n\n", "Q: PATH variable is reseting itself Every time I close my terminal and reopen it, simples command(e.g. ls) doesn't work.

I installed Ubuntu 13.10 on my Dell Inspiron 15R laptop. (Intel i7 processor, 8Gb ram). However the fan constantly running at a very high speed irrespective of the application that I am working on. It does not slowdown for a second even. Could anyone please help me to get this solved. I'll be truly grateful if anyone can help me out in this regard.\n\nA: I also own a Dell Inspiron 15R laptop, but with an i3 processor and 6GB RAM and running Ubuntu 14.04. I was experiencing the same issue you are and would like to offer you the solution the fan issue on my computer.\nI found out via the forums about an application called TLP, which is an autonomous power management tool. Once installed, it began to work immediately and my fans began to run normally. Slightly skeptical, I restarted my computer a few times to verify that the problem was resolved, and it was. My fans were not running at max speed and remaining as such once my computer displayed the GRUB menu and thereon, as they were before I installed TLP.\nThis site will guide you through installing the application.\nUPDATE\nI have discovered that TLP was not a complete solution to this issue, or my fan issue. However, I recently found a solution to my fan problem, which seems identical to yours, and I posted it on my thread, https://askubuntu.com/a/537538/311982. But I will post my answer here, for convenience.\n\nFan speed is normalized by editing the line \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nin the grub configuration file found at /etc/default/grub so that it reads \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=!Windows 2012\".\nFollow these steps to try this solution:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open a terminal, type sudo gedit /etc/default/grub, and press ENTER\n  \n*Enter your login password and press ENTER (the password will not be displayed as you type it)\n  \n*Edit the line,\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" \nsuch that it reads, \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=!Windows 2012\".\n  \n*Click \"Save\", wait a few moments for the file to save, then close the text editor.\n  \n*In the terminal, type \nsudo update-grub\nand hit ENTER\n  \n*Finally, shut down your computer. Shut it down completely, so don't \"restart\" it.\nOnce you turn your computer back on and select the linux operating system whose grub file you edited earlier, your fans should be working normally. This solution has worked for me on Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary OS, and LXLE on a Dell Inspiron 15R 5520 laptop.\n\n-Jordan\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 black boot screen and boot-repair failed I cannot boot Ubuntu 12.04 after from a copy of my VirtualBox file.\nI am getting a \"GNU GRUB version 1.99-12ubuntu5\" screen with these options:\nUbuntu, with Linux 3.0.0-24-generic\nUbuntu, with Linux 3.0.0-24-generic (recovery mode)\nPrevious Linux versions\nMemory test (memtest 86+)\nMemory test [...]\n\nChoosing option 1 or 2 leads me directly to a black screen.\nTrying to fix this, I started with an Ubuntu Live Cd and run boot-repair.\nUnfortunately, boot-repair failed with this link.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/7024127/\nNow I am stuck.\nBest regards\n\nA: I had a similar issue with VirtualBox.

How can I set a filetype to always open with a specific application?\nIn .local/share/applications/mimeapps.list there was this line -\napplication/x-extension-jap=gedit.desktop;jalbum.desktop;\nIt always opens with gedit, and jalbum does not appear in the Open with list.\nSince jalbum should be (and always used to be) the default application, I changed it to\napplication/x-extension-jap=jalbum.desktop;gedit.desktop;\nBut that doesn't seem to change anything.\nIn answers to similar questions \"Ubuntu Tweak\" has been suggested as a way to manage this problem, but that option seems to have disappeared from current versions of \"Tweak\".\nI tried fixing this using the Nautilus Properties display, but jalbum doesn't show up there as an alternative application.\nIs there some other way to fix this?\n\nUpdate\n@JohnnyD\nIt seems that the edit that I described actually worked, but needed a restart to take effect.\nBut the second app listed in mimeapps.list (gedit) is now not available in \"Open with\", and if I choose it from \"Other applications\", then jalbum disappears again!\nIt also seems that when I originally searched for \"Ubuntu Tweak\" in the Software Centre I found \"Unity Tweak\" which appears to be a different animal, so my earlier comments about \"Ubuntu Tweak\" really applied to \"Unity Tweak\" instead.\nSo the immediate problem was resolved, but -\nwith regard to your suggested solutions, I couldn't see any way in \"Open with\" to insert an app manually that doesn't already appear in the list. \nAnd I couldn't see in \"Unity tweak Tool\" a way to register a filetype that isn't already in the \"File Type\" list.\n\nA: right click on a file you wish to open navigate to properties at the bottom then navigate to open with there you can see the default app for given format and you can change or replace it with desired one, if it's not listed search for it manually of course, for example /usr/bin/ appname.\nAlso you can install Ubuntu-tweak:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nrun it when it's opened navigate to admins/file type manager and find and choose format for changing.\n", "Q: Settings for Glidepoint touchpad/trackpoint on Dell Latitude Couple of issues with the touchpad and trackpoint for my Dell Latitude laptop (Ubuntu 12.04).

No synaptics driver loaded?. \nThe relevent output of xinput is: \n    ⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n    ⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n    ⎜   ↳ GlidePoint Virtual Touchpad               id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nI found a file in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ that has code to enable middle mouse scrolling, but it looks like it's only triggered if TrackPoint|DualPoint Stick is matched in the xinput list? Oddly, the middle-mouse scrolling seems to work only in Chrome's pdf viewer, but no where else. \nI tried using gpointer-device-settings but it crashes/segfaults every time I run it. I've tried a couple of things about ALPS drivers, but those seem to come into play when the Glidepoint device shows up in xinput as regular mouse, which I don't think is the case here. \n\nA: I have a Dell E7440 with pre-installed Ubuntu 12.04. Here is how I solved issues mentioned by you:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have no \"Touchpad\" tab on the Mouse settings in system settings but it is not needed since there is a pre-installed tool called \"GlidePoint Control Center\" or \"GlidePoint Touchpad\" v.3.6 which allows to setup buttons, motion, tapping, scrolling etc. So all touchpad features can be controlled through it. It can be found here.\n\n*To enable middle-mouse-button scrolling on the trackpoint I followed this article and the only thing I modified was /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/11-evdev-trackpoint.conf in the MatchProduct section there was no my device which I got through 'xinput' so I added it there. And here is my 11-evdev-trackpoint.conf:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier      \"trackpoint catchall\"\n    MatchIsPointer  \"true\"\n    MatchProduct    \"TrackPoint|DualPoint Stick|GlidePoint Virtual Touchpad\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Option  \"Emulate3Buttons\"       \"true\"\n    Option  \"EmulateWheel\"  \"true\"\n    Option  \"EmulateWheelButton\"    \"2\"\n    Option  \"XAxisMapping\"  \"6 7\"\n    Option  \"YAxisMapping\"  \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nAs far as I see you have the same device in your 'xinput'. So to enable middle-mouse-button scrolling just modify that file and reboot.\n\nA: I've done that with xinput (it works fine on a E5450):\nxinput set-prop \"AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint Stick\" \"Evdev Wheel Emulation\" 1\nxinput set-prop \"AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint Stick\" \"Evdev Wheel Emulation Button\" 2\nxinput set-prop \"AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint Stick\" \"Evdev Wheel Emulation Timeout\" 200\n\nI think that's the behavior you're looking for.\n\nA: Well, this works for mee and Latitude E7470 too, however I have no idea how Santiago made this work, DnrDevil.\nxinput set-prop \"ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse\" \"Evdev Wheel Emulation\" 1\nxinput set-prop \"ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse\" \"Evdev Wheel Emulation Button\" 2\nxinput set-prop \"ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse\" \"Evdev Wheel Emulation Timeout\" 20\n\n", "Q: Why does Abiword crash or behave oddly on Xubuntu? After spending hours composing a document on AbiWord it suddenly, for no apparent reason, said it needed to close and I lost all my work. Is this a common AbiWord problem, Linux problem or other? \nAlso any time I am typing, suddenly my last sentence or multiple paragraphs will be randomly slammed into the middle of my work? What's up with that?\nAlso would you recommend Mint XFCE over Xubuntu? I have a 100GB hard drive and only 1GB RAM which I assume the stock computer uses some of that, but how much I don't know.\n\nA: *\n\n*Keep the zoom level at the 100% default, so AbiWord will have not too much graphics rendering to do.\n\n*Your problem with inserting the paragraphs in the middle is being caused by the middle button on the mouse which acts as a copy key to copy from the clipboard. If you are careful to not press the middle button of the mouse when scrolling, you should not have this problem. \n\n*You have made a good choice of operating system to match your hardware. Linux Mint is heavier than Xubuntu and may give you worse performance, especially when using the web browser, unless you use the lightweight MATE desktop environment. \nTo set the autosave time interval in AbiWord:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Edit -> Preferences -> Documents tab. \n\n*Put a check mark in the checkbox next to Auto Save. \n\n*In Interval set the number of minutes after which your document will be automatically saved.\nAuto Save is enabled by default in AbiWord, and the default Auto Save Interval is preset to 5 minutes. The .bak~ extension is added to the filename when the document is autosaved so that AbiWord does not overwrite the last version of the file you saved deliberately. This should be left as the default (.bak~) unless you have a really good reason to change it. \nIf the document has not been created in a folder or saved before, AbiWord will autosave the backup document to your Home directory. After the document has been saved the first time, AbiWord will continue to autosave the .bak~ document to the same directory as the original document. The autosaved backup is a hidden file that can be displayed in the file manager by pressing the keyboard combination Ctrl+H.\n\nA: I would depreciate Abiword. Try LibreOffice instead. sudo apt-get install libre-office It has equivalents of Microsoft Office's Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Database, and Formula Creation, as well as Drawing.\n", "Q: Is it better to remove software using Ubuntu Sofware Center or Synaptic Package Manager? I'm very new and I accidentally installed 6 text editors via the Synaptic Package Manager, and one from the Ubuntu Software Center. I know I can \"remove\" the text editing software with one click in the Ubuntu Software Center. Is that the best way to remove them or would it be better to remove them via the Synaptic Package Mangager or perhaps there's an even better way? \n\nA: They both do the same when you remove a package, so they're equally good and it's all up to you which one you prefer. Synaptic provides advanced functionality, but you don't need that for simply uninstalling software.\n", "Q: Bad symbols on my eclipse C++ installation https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9131763/eclipse-cdt-c11-c0x-support\nI come from that website.\nI have a C++ project that compiles with g++-4.8 without problems. I just wanted to use std::int8_t from the cstdint file. \nProblem is the eclipse indexer can't resolve the name.\nI went to the csdint file and in the initial macro it expands __cplusplus to 199711L instead of 201103L.\nIn my project settings I added std=c++11 and in the compiler flags I addded GXX_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX0X \nAnd did I say it compiles?\nIt's very frustrating, I suppose I can live without the indexer, but then again what is the purpose of an IDE if it's giving me error false positives. \n\nA: I found my answer in here: http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/490066/\nGo to Project Properties->Paths and Symbols->Symbols Tab->GNU C++->__cplusplus Symbol and change to 201103L\n\nA: It depends on your used type of C++ project and your eclipse version. I have a Makefile project in Eclipse Mars.2 (4.5) with CDT 8.8.1.201602051005) If you have a Makefile project and see the item C/C++ General-->C/C++ Make Projects in your project properties, you also have to go to the tab \"Discovery Options\" and add -std=c++11 to the Compiler invocation arguments.\n", "Q: No network connection with installed version but USB version works This is my first shot at the Linux world and particularly the Ubuntu segment. I\ninstalled Ubuntu 13.10 from a USB stick on an old Dell Inspiron 1510 and if I\nboot the installed version I am unable to get a network connection, either wifi\nor ethernet.   \nIf I boot from the USB stick, the same one I used to install from, I get an ethernet connection but no wifi connection.

If this does not equal 0, then you have updates! Simple as that, you can continue expanding to put the following in a script in /usr/bin :\n#!/bin/bash\nNUMUPG=`sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -s | grep \"not\\ upgraded\" | cut -c 1-1`\nif [[ \"$NUMUPG\" == \"0\" ]]\nthen echo \"SYSTEM UP-TO-DATE\"\n  else echo \"SYSTEM OUT-OF-DATE\"\nfi\nexit 0\n\nIf you create the script, be sure to do chmod +x [FILENAME] before attempting to run it.\nHope that helps!

I have no idea what it is in .kde that caused the problem, but it seems that nvidia have changed the way they do multi monitor support in the nvidia-settings control which may explain it. Now both monitors are set to a different screen and then Xinerama can be enabled (previously you just enabled Xinerama and it took care of the screens for you). I don't know if this is what caused the problem but it could be.\nThe only issue is that I now have a panel across the bottom of the second screen that I didn't have before that mirrors what is going on with the primary one. I've not been game to remove it yet.\nBut, both monitors now working without the dvi cable plugged in.\n", "Q: Trouble with rake db:setup I am trying to pull a GitHub file using rake db:setup, but I get an error every time, no matter how many times I reinstall postgresql  or check Rails.

with ruby on rails, but by reading the output I suspect that it is a password problem.\nline 8 reads:\nfe_sendauth: no password supplied\n\nAnd then towards the middle:\nCouldn't create database for {\"adapter\"=>\"postgresql\", \"encoding\"=>\"unicode\", \"database\"=>\"bathrooms_development\", \"pool\"=>5, \"host\"=>\"localhost\", \"username\"=>\"root\", \"password\"=>nil}\nfe_sendauth: no password supplied\n\nIt seems that the server is expecting a password in order to establish the connection but you are not supplying one in the connection string. If i remember correctly, it is recommended to use a \"open\" (ie without password) account while developing your RoR application.\nI suggest you create a db user with all admin(bad idea, sorry) create privileges but without password and use that account for development purposes. Do this on a local/test instance of the postgres server to avoid exposing any data.\n\nA: You need to specify the database adapter settings to your Postgres server in the config/database.yml file. Use something like:\ndevelopment:\n  adapter: postgresql\n  host: 127.0.0.1\n  database: my_app_db \n  schema_search_path: my_app_schema, public\n  encoding: unicode\n  pool: 5\n  timeout: 5000\n  username: my_user\n  password: my_pass\n\nFor more details on setting up Rails with Postgres you can try this guide.\n", "Q: How do I install a backdoor to logon to Ubuntu? Please tell me, how can I install a backdoor so that I can reset the password from recovery mode, as well as from terminal. I would prefer that this be something that can only be done while installing and that it would notify you for a few days after installing that there is a backdoor so that you can't install Ubuntu on someone's computer with a backdoor to hack/crack there information. \n\nA: You likely don't need a \"backdoor\".\nYou can reset the password for any user by booting to recovery mode or using a Live CD. Both these methods give you root on a system by virtue of having physical access. The only way to deny this sort of thing is using full disk encryption with a strong password you enter on boot... But yeah, that will deny any sort of recovery if you forget it.\nIf you need to handle this remotely, you could set a root password (sudo passwd) and enable root login in /etc/ssh/sshd_config but you should consider that a security risk. root login is disabled for a reason and I honestly don't think it's worth it...\n", "Q: How can i install Ubuntu on my laptop without USB stick or DVD?

If yes, please help me throughout it, i'll be very thankful to you.\n\nWhat is WUBI INSTALLATION. And how can i do it? .can anyone tell me step by step about it please..\n\nA: If you mean that you cannot boot your computer on a usb stick or a dvd, the other way is to put your hard disk into another computer and install it, then put back your hard disk into your laptop.\nThis page contains the ways you can use to install Ubuntu.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation\n\nA: A couple of ways you may wish to try is an \"along side\" wubi installation or a virtual machine running inside windows. Both of which you can download direct with any high speed internet connection and use right away.\n\nA: One thing I've been trying lately is using EasyBCD, which allows you to create a bootable entry for ISOs directly. Details here. The program is free (for noncommercial use) and easy to use, so it's pretty painless. \nI considered using Wubi, but it does not support UEFI and as far as I know it will not be supported in releases of Ubuntu above 12. \nAnother possibility that is a bit more complicated would be to use VirtualBox with a virtual hard drive mapped to the appropriate partition, then mount the .iso as a drive in VirtualBox. I haven't tried that, though, but I see no reason to believe it wouldn't work.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 - help for sound under Unity, silence under XFCE4 I have an ubuntu 12.04 install - if I login with a default (Unity) Desktop session sound has always worked out of the box.\nI installed XFCE4 and I;m really happy with it but for the fact that there's no sound. I bring up the mixer and set all of the output volumes to max but still hear nothing. The volume keys work in that they show the volume indicator going up and down but still no sound.\nI don't know enough about sound under linux to know what's missing or how to debug.\nHelp needed and appreciated.\n---Raymond\n\nA: You probably have the issue of some switches not being activated. In xfce4-mixer, Select controls... try to select most items (but look specifically for Headphone or Front), then in the Switches tab make sure that all items listed there are enabled. \n\nWhen this doesn't work, I usually resort to alsamixer from the command-line. \n", "Q: I cannot rename files in bulk using ubuntu's rename feature I cannot rename files in bulk using ubuntu's rename feature.

I don't want to use the command line either. So I can permanently erase files after I have encrypted them without exposing their contents to people who use a file recovery tool.\nI also don't want a method that takes days or months to rename the file. That is, rename one file at a time. So if I have hundreds of files to rename, this won't be a option. I want to give a each file the same name and numbered in order like shown above.\nPyrenamer is not an option for me, unless you can find how to do that in PyRenamer.\n\nA: You can use the rename command, which is usually included in a default installation:\nrename 's/.*/sprintf(\"filename (%d)\", ++$ENV{c})/e' *\n\nThis would do precisely what you asked for. Use the -n flag if you want to do a test first:\nrename -n 's/.*/sprintf(\"filename (%d)\", ++$ENV{c})/e' *\n\nThis assumes that the environment variable c is undefined, which will cause the count to start from 0. If you want to be extra safe, you could call it like this:\nc=0 rename -n 's/.*/sprintf(\"filename (%d)\", ++$ENV{c})/e' *\n\n\nA: Install pyrenamer from the software center or via terminal:\nsudo apt-get install pyrenamer\n\n\n\"You can rename files using patterns, search and replace, substitutions, insert or delete text, or even rename files manually. You can also rename images using their EXIF tags and music using their internal tags.\"\n\nTo do this with pyrenamer, the renamed filename pattern should be filename ({num+1})\nCheck screenshot below:\n\n\nA: Mass Rename is a simple pair of shell scripts which make it easier to move, rename, or copy multiple files at once.\nInstall mrename in Ubuntu\nsudo apt-get install mrename\n\nUsing mrename\nmrename pattern prefix [option]\n\nThere are only the following three options.\n-c The option -c will copy each file with the new filename.\n\n-m The option -m will move each file in the new filename.\n\n-h Display help.\n\n", "Q: Vietnamese input method After re-installing Ubuntu 13.10, the Vietnamese input settings in iBus changed. Before this it used the telex input method (same as Android and iOS defaults). Now it has a very strange keyboard with the diacritic accents replacing the number row.

If so, that'll be a cleaner solution for you.\nOften, the drivers supplied in Linux will be open-source and maintained while drivers supplied by manufacturers may be closed-source and dated.  That said, often there is no existing open-source driver for a piece of hardware.  And sometimes the manufacturer themselves made their driver open-source and so a derivative of that appears in Linux.\n\nA: You can download the driver from:\nIf you are running 32bit: here\nIf you are running 64bit: here\nPress I Accept and wait to finish download.\nNow to install the driver:\ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo dpkg -i brscan*.deb\n\nInstall the udev rule setup.\nIf you need to debug, then run:\n/opt/brother/scanner/brscan4/brsaneconfig4 -d\n\n", "Q: How to retain LCD brightness after reboot I frequently test different linux Distros and recently found a 'feature' that I would like to know how to turn on in Ubuntu.

If there are multiple disks in your computer the \"Erase everything and install Ubuntu\" option will only erase the selected disk, but it won't erase the other disk(s). Then the installer installs Ubuntu on a created ext4 partition and then it also creates a separate SWAP partition on the extended partition according to the swap size given.

(parentheses))\n\nA: Start screen in detached mode, and make it run your command inside it:\nscreen -d -m -S bukkit bash -c 'cd $HOME/server && java -jar bukkit.jar'\n\nYou might want to create a dedicated script bukkit.sh:\n#!/bin/bash -e\ncd ~/server\njava -jar bukkit.jar\n\nSo that if the script becomes more complex you don't have to write a long line for screen, and so the screen command can stay the same, simply:\nscreen -d -m -S bukkit path/to/bukkit.sh\n\n\nA: You should update-rc.d as follows to turn on service on boot:\n# update-rc.d cron defaults\n\n", "Q: what is the command to restart firefox from the command line? how to restart firefox from the command-line. I have already given as \"firefox\". Is this the right command to restart the firefox?\n\nA: First kill all processes that is named Firefox which means killing the existing running firefox then run it again\npkill firefox\nfirefox &\n\n\nA: At least in my version, Firefox doesn't have a restart option. You can kill the process and then start it again. For example:\nkillall firefox\nfirefox\n\nIf killall doesn't cut it, you can use pkill instead. Just keep in mind that pkill would kill any process with firefox in its name, though probably that's not a big concern.\n\nA: Update\nIn the address bar write\n\n*\n\n*about:profiles\nthen press the Tab button a couple of times to select the Restart Normally or the Restart with Add-ons Disabled button on the loaded page, and finally press Enter.\n\n\n*about:restartrequired then press  Enter (it should be already selected else you can always press Tab).\n\nUnder Linux it is possible to use from command line\npkill -f firefox && firefox 2>/dev/null &\n\nkilling all the processes with word firefox in the whole (full) command line, redirecting the error log to /dev/null; maybe after checking with pgrep -fl firefox.\n\nIt's a command line but an internal one...\nPress ShiftF2, write restart in the opened bar (at the very bottom), then press enter.\nOn old versions, e.g. the 41.0.2, it was needed to write the word true too: restart true.\nSome words more\nIt's possible to force firefox to restart through the Developer Toolbar, usually accessible via ShiftF2 or via menu (Firefox/Tools >> Web Developer >> Developer Toolbar in the English version).\nA bar will be opened in the bottom of the page where it will be possible to write the command\nrestart\n\nIt is possible to use restart --nocache true or restart --nocache false in order to force it the refresh of the tabs content or to use the local cached instead. It can result useful the --safemode option too.\nYou can find some words more and the old synopsis on another answer of mine on SuperUser.\n\nA: The below would be better since using nohup is cleaner and forcing firefox to stop wit -9 is sometimes important\npkill -9 firefox\nnohup firefox &\n\n", "Q: log in as root in ubuntu 12.04 I ran this commands in Terminal and I didnt get any error:\nsudo passwd root\n\nand after setting password I ran this command:\nsudo passwd -u root\n\nbut when I log off or reboot there is no root account!! please somebody tell me how can I login as root in ubuntu 12.04!\n\nA: Here is a community wiki. Often many users advice you not to use Ubuntu this way. \nYou have sudo anyway which elevates the privileges to root for a single command using your account password.\nBut, if you have a good reason to be root you can do that as well in Ubuntu.\nBelow are some useful links:\nUnable to login as root from the login screen even though I have a root account\nRe-enable graphical root-login on 12.04 LTS\n\nA: You can do this by editing /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf The default contents are just:\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nuser-session=ubuntu\n\nAnd you can just add:\ngreeter-hide-users=true\n\nNow logout and you'll see that there is no list of users in the login window.\nso you can just write root as username...\nIf you want to return to old lightdm window that list all users just open /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file and remove the added line greeter-hide-users=true\n\nA: Using Root as log in is not good, anyway if want it for some file management

don't remember the trick, Something like when you type in command in terminal it should auto complete it by matching it with the similar commands given in History, so Up Arrow would show me matching history commands instead of plain old previous irrelevant commands.\n\nA: tab-completion:\nYou can use tab-completion to complete the command, options, etc. e.g. type fi and hit Tab twice in quick succession, the list of available completions will be shown (if more than one command begins with the text fragment you typed in), then with fin typed press Tab it would complete it with find (if this is the only match).\nreverse-i-search:\nCtrl+R will smartly look from the history and display the matching ones. e.g. pressing Ctrl+R in terminal and typing su resulted in:\n(reverse-i-search)`su':  sudo restart lightdm\n\nif that's not the right one you can type further till the right most recent matching command is displayed.\n\nA: Add this to .bash_profile and source it:\n# make bash autocomplete with up arrow\nbind '\"\\e[A\":history-search-backward'\nbind '\"\\e[B\":history-search-forward'\n\n# make tab cycle through commands instead of listing\nbind

I have set ufw to block all ports by default (sudo ufw default deny) and so far have added rules to open a couple of ports for SSH and game servers, but there is one thing I don't understand.  \n\n\n*\n\n*How is it that I am still able to update packages, ping IP addresses, etc. \nif ufw is supposedly blocking all (or almost all) of the ports?  \n\n*Does ufw automatically allow traffic back from an IP address that I have connected to?  \n\n\nI'm sure there is a simple technical explanation but I'm having trouble finding it via Google.\nThank you!\n\nA: Unless you've set up ufw to default-deny outgoing connections (which is not the default), then applications on your system can connect to external hosts. The connections made to external hosts are generally bidirectional - when you run, say, curl or apt-get, the programs make a connection to the remote host and can then both push data out and pull data down that connection.\nufw is set to default-accept outgoing connections because default-deny is basically the same as not being connected to the network. Depending on what you're trying to secure, though, default-deny outgoing might be the right policy.\n", "Q: How to install specific version of some package?

Thus, running MPD is only half of the equation. To use MPD, you need to install a MPD client (aka MPD interface).\n  Command-line Clients\n\nYou can choose between a terminal or graphical based interface\nclients:\n\n\n*\n\n*mpc - a solid, lightweight, simple mpd client, written in C.\nConsole Clients\n\n*ncmpc - A curses client written in C.\n\n*ncmpcpp - A curses client written in C++ tailored after ncmpc.\nGraphical Clients\n\n*gmpc (Gnome Music Player Client) - A fully featured client.\n\n*ario - Another GTK based client.\n\n*More clients can be found on the Wiki\n\nUbuntu Install Procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, edit /etc/apt/sources.list and enable the 'universe' repository.

When using UEFI boot in Virtualbox, I instantly get dropped into EFI-shell. I looked this up online and did as explained in this thread. When I do as explained in the thread, I get \"efidisk read error\". Despite this error, it somehow still boots into Ubuntu, but I end up in tty1. \nI have tried this to avoid getting dropped into EFI-shell without any success. \n\n\n*\n\n*Why does \"efidisk read error\" appear? \n\n*How do I boot directly into Ubuntu without moving to EFI-shell?\n\n*How do I get into lightdm from tty1? \n\n\nA: VirtualBox tends to forget its EFI boot entries. I know of two solutions to this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move/rename the boot loader you're using (probably EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi on the EFI System Partition (ESP)) to EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. This is the default/fallback filename, and so VirtualBox will boot from it by default if there are no other entries.\n\n*Use the VirtualBox EFI's menus to locate the boot loader you're using (again, probably EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi) and add it as a boot option. I don't recall the precise steps, and the menus aren't exactly user-friendly, but if you poke around in the menus, the options are there.\n\n\nDoing either of these things should get GRUB starting, but then you've got the second issue, of X not starting. To solve this problem, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a text-mode login.\n\n*Type sudo su to acquire root privileges.\n\n*Type Xorg -configure. This should create a file called /root/xorg.conf.new, IIRC.\n\n*Copy that newly-create file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\n\n*Optionally, edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf. This may or may not be required. Personally, I edit the file to set the fbdev driver as the default, but you may prefer something else. There are lots of online guides to xorg.conf, but I don't have any URLs handy, and it can be pretty complex, so completely describing it here is impractical.\n\n\nA: As it may be possible to install Ubuntu in Virtual Box EFI mode it may not work as expected. I for myself have given up on this after some failed experiments, and after reading the documentation to Virtual Box :\n\nNote that the VirtualBox EFI support is experimental and will be enhanced as EFI matures and becomes more widespread.\n\nSo it can work fine, but like many experimental features it may not work as expected.\nFor a virtual machine a virtualized EFI firmware does not have any advantages over a virtual legacy BIOS it may (if not for testing) be better to install a virtual OS in legacy BIOS mode.\n", "Q: “/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_python-mt\" installing pycuda 2011.2.2 Trying to install PyCuda I followed these instructions as I ran into that problem but unfortunately I am still getting the error:\nc++ -pthread -shared -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -Wl,-z,relro -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O2 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -g -fstack-protector --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -Wformat -Werror=format-security build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/src/cpp/cuda.o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/src/cpp/bitlog.o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/src/wrapper/wrap_cudadrv.o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/src/wrapper/mempool.o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/src/wrapper/wrap_curand.o -L/usr/local/cuda/lib -L/usr/local/cuda/lib64 -lboost_python-mt-py27 -lboost_thread-mt -lcuda -lcurand -o build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/pycuda/_driver.so\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_python-mt-py27\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_thread-mt\n/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/local/cuda/lib/libcurand.so when searching for -lcurand\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\nerror: command 'c++' failed with exit status 1\nmake: *** [install] Error 1\n\nI found the linking file libboost_python-mt in /usr/lib/ but it seems referencing /usr/lib/libboost_python-mt-py26 which does not exist.

From side scrolling to both buttons. From zooming to double clicking. The distance is the best out of the 4. The only problem is that it does not have a middle button.\n\n*Anywhere MX - Excellent mouse. The side buttons, 2 middles buttons and fast scrolling make it the most used one I have. The horrible problem is that it uses the batteries at least 3x faster than any other AND the distance is horrible. Less than a meter. I had to send it back and change it for a new one. After about 4 months the problem started again.\n\n*M555B - Excellent mouse and I like fast scroll it has BUT here are the problems you might be facing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power problems. The first one I had, I used new batteries (Tested the batteries in the T620 before using them in the M555) and somehow it did not work correctly. A lot of stuttering or simply going off after about a minute. At first I thought it was the Bluetooth (A Kesington 2.0) but it was working great with my Samsung S4. I then tested the M555 with the Samsung S4. It did not work. So I send the mouse back saying it had a bluetooth issue. Got a new one about 2 months later.\n\n*Bluetooth issue. It might be a BT issue with the mouse as mentioned above or with the BT of the computer. Test the BT with a phone or another BT device to see which one is the problem.\nWhat I would recommend is that you connect the M555 to a phone or tablet that has BT support. If it works correctly then you know the problem is in the BT of the computer. If it does not, then it is the actual mouse the problem.\nIf the problem happens to be the BT of the computer then you can check which version of BlueZ you have. If you are in 13.10 it should be the 4.101. In 14.04 I do not know (I hope it will be the 5.17 that appeared yesterday since it will give support to a motherboard I have).\nI would suggest compiling the latest BlueZ version and testing it out. The latest at least makes my BT of the computer (Asus Z87 Pro) work.\nWith this I am saying that Logitech are not very good with all products. Some will have some weird problems others will not. Apart from this, all Bluetooth devices or not working 100% yet (The latest ones). In the case of the M555B for me, I needed to change to another one to fix the problem. Tested on 13.10 right now.\nTo test what in the world is going on in your case I would first recommend doing the following (Does not matter if you do it before or after connecting the mouse):\ntail -f /var/log/syslog\n\nThis will constantly display what is happening to the system. So after doing that connect or disconnect the mouse and try to pair it. Repeat at least 2 or 3 times with the working intervals you mentioned (2 or 3 minutes of working time). After you have enough logged information about what happens between connecting and the 2/3 minutes of disconnection, post that on http://paste.ubuntu.com and link it in your question or in a comment. This way we can do a follow up on it.\n\nA: This might be simplistic question but just in case: \ndoes your phone connection to the mouse is active at the same time you pair the mouse to your desktop? If yes, disable your bluetooth connection to the phone, reconnect to your PC and test it.\nThere is a really nice guide for Bluetooth Setup.\nI hope this will provide you direction toward resolution of your problem.\n\nA: Logitech indicates that this problem can be caused by low batteries or Radio frequency (RF) interference from more powerful devices, such as:\nWireless speakers\nComputer power supplies\nMonitors\nCell phones\nGarage door openers\n\nBefore reconnecting your mouse\nFix or rule out the potential problems listed above.\n\nInsert fresh batteries into your mouse \n\nTurn your computer on.\n\nReconnecting your mouse\nTurn your mouse on — slide the power switch on the bottom of the mouse to the right.\n\nPress the Bluetooth connect button.\n\nHopefully you will now see it in the KDE Bluetooth Manager and can connect normally.\n", "Q: Need compatible USB WiFi adapter for Ubuntu 13.10 The computer. \nIntel i5-4440 processor, Intel DB85FL motherboard on Ubuntu 13.10 64bit. \nPlease suggest me a WiFi USB adapter to work out of the box.\n\nA: There is a list of supported wifi adapters here\nI have very good experience with the netgear wpn111\nand the Conrad wlan stick n300 mini. \nAlso almost all Intel adapters are supported.\n", "Q: Mount disks at startup I want to mount my drive just after I login.

Icons are stored in /usr/share/icons/ and a good place for the script would be in your HOME folder, maybe hidden (hide by adding a . at the beginning of his name).\n\n*C) Make it executable : \nsudo chmod +x ~/Desktop/Lampp.desktop\n\n\nNote : the script isn't really checking if lampp is working, it is using a temporary file (disapears at reboot) containing 1 if you have used the script once (meaning it's started) and 0 if you haven't used the script (meaning it isn't started). \nWhat does it mean ? That you have to only use this script if you want things to work : do not start lampp without this script and you'll be ok. \nNote : you'll have to type your password in order to launch the shortcut. You could bypass that, but that wasn't your question so I will not explain that here. \n\nA: You can use a script like this,\n#!/bin/bash\n#checks if the process is already running or not\nps ax | grep \"/opt/lampp/lamp[p]\" > /dev/null\n#if the process is running exit status $?=0 \nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n#interactively states the running status of the process and asks permission to\n#proceed in a zenity pop-up box\n    zenity --question --text=\"Process is running. select \\\"yes\\\" to stop\"\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n#stop the running process on approval\n    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop\n    else\n        exit 0\n    fi\nelse\n#interactively states the running status of the process and asks permission to\n#proceed in a zenity pop-up box\n    zenity --question --text=\"Process is not running. select \\\"yes\\\" to start\"\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n#starts the process on approval\n        sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start\n    else\n        exit 0\n    fi\nfi\n\nSave the script. Give it execution permission,\nchmod +x <script_name>\n\nIt should give you Run option on double-clicking on it. If you wish you can make a .desktop file to run it.\nNote: See this answer to run sudo /opt/lampp/lampp without password.\n", "Q: Edubuntu in Ubuntu Guys I'm currently using Ubuntu LTS Version 12.04.4.\nI would like to install Edubuntu with higher secondary that is pre-college(age 16) and college level packages installed.\nI would like to know how to go installing Edubuntu should I download the ISO or is there a easy way I install from within Ubuntu?

It looks similar to this:\nchromium-browser &\nqbittorrent &\nxchat &\nguake &\n\nIs there any way I can detect if there are any \"active\" torrents and only open qbittorrent if yes? By active I mean any torrent in the client, not necessarily downloading (they're not downloading anyway if it's closed).\n\nA: What about checking the directory you've configured qbittorent to store .torrent files in?\nUnder Options > Downloads, take a look at the Copy Keep incomplete torrents in setting and select a location.\n\nSimply modifying your start up script to check this directory for .torrent files that haven't completed yet might be good enough.\nIf not, and you need a little more functionality, then, enable the Run an external program on torrent completion setting and write a simple script that does whatever additional things you want.\nAnyways, the point is, a combination of these various settings and scripts can be used to do a number of things with qbittorrent depending on what you want.\n\n", "Q: Download/upload still going even though internet is gone So sometimes my internet is disappearing and it's probably my internet provider problem, because my neighbors got the same problem. Now what's strange is when internet is gone, I can see using System Monitor that network download/upload is still going on, but just several kilobytes. Why is it showing internet download/upload when internet is completely gone?\n\nA: Even if you're not connected to the internet there will still be data sent from and to your wireless router. It's not from the internet but it's still data and system monitor will treat it as such. \n\nA: There are many possible issues in this case, but from what you say, I believe that the download/upload connection that you see, is just the connection between your computer and your home router.\nSo if you are unable to access www.google.com lets say from your browser, your computer tries to communicate to remote servers. But if there is a problem with your Internet Service Provider (ISP), then your computer is probably only connected to your home router. That is what you see...\nYou can try a ping or traceroute command on your pc using a terminal to further diagnose the problem.\nHope that helps :-)\n", "Q: Simulated secondary click doesn't work | Ubuntu 12.04 I would like to know how I can use simulated secondary click by press for a few seconds click left.

It simulates user actions by\n  generating keyboard and mouse events, and then testing the internal\n  state of the application in question. It works for gtk and qt based\n  applications.\n\nIn summary, this involves various automated testing procedures to prove the viability of any changes to the build.\nCanonical have stated that the extent of the automated testing has been so successful that the normal 3 alphas/2 beta approach to development that was so prevalent in earlier versions of Ubuntu is no longer required.  It could be construed that this is close to the \"rolling release\" version of Ubuntu - someone using this build always receives the latest versions of software during the overall cycle of development & testing.  Such a release is very well tested by the automated tests.\nThis approach was seen with the development Raring (13.04) and has continued with refinements for both Saucy (13.10) and especially for this LTS release.\nAs you can see from the release schedule - there is only one official beta release of Trusty - this coincides with beta 2 for the opt-in flavours of Ubuntu.\nTo provide flexibility for the differing development strategies for the various Ubuntu Desktop teams, the teams themselves nominate whether they wish to \"opt-in\" to this automated testing regime or to follow the more traditional point-in-time release strategy.  So far, only the Ubuntu desktop team has taken this approach.  However it should be remembered - for the vast majority of software and underlying software that is common, this automated approach benefits the wider eco-system - and indeed benefits Debian and Upstream - bugs are found more quickly and pushed upwards where necessary.\n\nLinked Questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I contribute an autopilot test?\n\n*How do I get involved with testing and QA with Ubuntu?\n", "Q: /etc/profile permission denied I'm running an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS partition and I've recently have had issues logging in.\nFrom the GUI login screen, when I enter my username and password, it takes me right back to the login screen. This is different from when I enter my username and password incorrectly.\nSo I entered alt+ctrl+F1 to access the terminal and I signed in.\nIt then reads: \n-bash: /etc/profile Permission denied\n\nFrom what I've tested, the only commands that I can run from terminal are basic terminal commands like ls and pwd. I tried changing my access to /etc:\nsudo chmod 755 /etc\n\nI get the errors:\nsudo: unable to open /etc/sudoers: Permission denied\n\nsudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting\n\nsudo: unable to initialize policy plugin\n\nIf I run it without sudo I get a permission denied. If someone knows how to get around this issue that would be great \n\nA: Setting permission to /etc:\nSince the permission of your /etc directory is drw-rw----, you will not be able to drop down to root privilege to set the right permissions. So you'll have to get a Live Ubuntu media with which you can boot and correct the problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to a live session, open a terminal and mount the target root partition:\nsudo -i\nmount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\n(replace sdXY with that of target device, the device for /; assuming you don't have a separate partition for /etc.)\n\n*Make permission changes:\nchmod 755 /mnt/etc\n\n(assuming the permissions for the contents in /etc is okay.)\nreboot\n\nP.S. I tried to replicate this by running sudo chmod 644 /etc and was able to recover with the steps stated above. However, I encountered additional issues with Unity plugins. The following AU Q&A helped to solve some:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears!\n\nA: If you have a root password, you can use su to become root and then fix the permissions of the files. They should be as follows:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 665 Feb 20 03:43 /etc/profile\n\nand\n-r--r----- 1 root root 745 Feb 10 20:16 /etc/sudoers\n\nAfter setting the permissions, you should reboot.\n\nA: I think you have messed with /etc/sudoers or some other sensitive file and  been locked out of sudo.\nBut you can use pkexec command to fix it.\nSee here and here for more deatil about file permission and /etc/sudoers.\n", "Q: Stuck on bootloop when I tried to install ubuntu touch on my Galaxy nexus I tried to flash ubuntu touch (saucy) on my i9250 and I got stuck on bootloop before I was able to push and flash the last file saucy-preinstalled-touch-armhf.zip. \nNow I am unable to boot into bootloader. When I open my phone it shows the Google logo and then it turns off. The problem is I cannot boot into bootloader/fastboot so I can flash the file. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: Hopefully you didn't brick it.\nTry booting into System Recovery Mode.. \n\nPress and hold the Volume Down button, and press then Power button until the screen lights up. Then select Recovery and press Power button to confirm.\n\nMight look something like this:\n\n\nA: I realize this is a really late response and you've probably solved it by now, but it may help others too.  I had the same issue with my phone after installing a CyanogenMod rom, where I couldn't even boot into recovery.  You will need to find the stock rom package for your phone on your computer and download the file.  You will also need a way to flash the rom via usb.  For example, a free program called Odin works for Samsung devices.  Regardless of what program you use-- \"jumpstart\" your phone into download mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take off cover and pull out battery\n\n*Hold volume up + down + power button\n\n*Plug in usb cable that is connected to the PC (kind of tricky to do)\n\n*Phone should buzz once, displaying warning triangle that says \"No OS installed\" or         something like that.  Release buttons.\n\n*Open the program for flashing the rom, and follow directions specific to that program to flash your stock rom\n\n\nThis is how I recovered my Galaxy S Blaze after soft-bricking it sometime last year. Hope it helps!\n", "Q: Temperature sensor showing really high temperature I am using HP Probook 4740s and my laptop is running on Ubuntu 13.04. I am facing some heating issues but couldn't found out which hardware was actually causing the heating issue.I have installed Psensor and saw that temp6 is reading 127 Celsius which is about 260 Fahrenheit.\nCan anyone tell me from which hardware I am getting this temp6 temperature reading ?\n\n\n\nA: Install  the packages lm-sensors with\nsudo apt-get install lm-sensors\nthen type \nsensors\n\nThis give you a list of Adapters and the assigned sensors. \n\nA: The id field of psensor is starting with \"lmsensor acpi\". It means that psensor is retrieving the information of this sensor from the lmsensor lib which get it throw the ACPI. As ACPI is not really normalized and depends on manufacturer it is quite impossible to locate the corresponding component without the technical specifications of your specific HW.\nMore generally, if you want to identify the component, read http://wpitchoune.net/psensor/doc/faq.html#S_WhatIsTheSensor.\nI guess that the temp6,7,8 temperatures never change, they are probably nothing else than default values meaning that there is no corresponding wired sensors. See http://wpitchoune.net/psensor/doc/faq.html#S_WrongTemperature.\nMost components in a PC have trouble with temperature higher than 100C. At 127C you should observe a major HW failure or at least easily locate the component manually... My conclusion is that you can ignore temp6.\nObviously, a 0C is also impossible, if it does not change to a >0 when the PC is overloaded you can also ignore them.\n", "Q: In Ubuntu 12.04 can I disable Iptables firewall? I want to create a minecraft server for me and my friends to connect to (port 25565). I already use ddclient, which updates the external ip so that the data sent to the hostname is forwarded to the external IP. \nI want to remove iptables because it is not going to help with anything suited for what I am trying to do. Although, if I remove it is there any other way I can forward the traffic through my external IP? - Or would it forward by default? And may I add, I would not like to just set the default rule to ACCEPT all connections because this doesn't solve my issue. \nI also know that if I keep Iptables, I will have to set up/modify an init script to update the rules every x minutes for the setup to work which will take even longer? But then I also realise that there for a reason - a firewall: To protect against hackers. Though, my ISP (Sky) does have a firewall that is default to BLOCK all connections, unless the port has been specified; in which I have forwarded the ports that are necessary for my server to run.\nWould this be safe enough to run my server behind? And can I remove Iptables? \nThank you!\n\nA: It would be saver if you keep iptables and setup the right rules to open the Minecraft ports. I would proceed as follows:\nnano /etc/iptables.rules\n\ninsert\n# 1. Delete all existing rules\niptables -F\niptables -P INPUT DROP\niptables -P FORWARD DROP\niptables -P OUTPUT DROP\n# 2. Accept established inbound connections\n-A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n\n# 3. Allow all outgoing traffic\n-A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT\n# 4. Allow Minecraft - default ports\n-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25565 -j ACCEPT\n# 5. Reject everything else\n-A INPUT -j REJECT\n-A FORWARD -j REJECT\n\nrestart firewall with new rules\niptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules\n\nload each time the server starts\niptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules\n\n\nA: Iptable is a part from the kernel and cannot be removed , in Ubuntu firewall is disabled by default and allow all traffics to flow .\nTo disable firewall :\nsudo ufw disable \n\nThis can help you configuring your firewall .\n", "Q: mp4v and mp4a in Ubuntu VLC In 13.10, I have this error in VLC:\n[0x7f529c0038a0] main decoder error: no suitable decoder module for fourcc `mp4v'.

I imagine that it could have to do with ffmpeg, but I have no idea. \n\nA: You should try Handbrake-gtk :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:stebbins/handbrake-releases\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install handbrake-gtk\n\nThis program can help you converting Mp4v and Mp4a to Mp4 .\n\nImage reference Here\n", "Q: Ubuntu VPS Automatic Backup Script \n\nCan anyone tell me how to create a backup script for Ubuntu VPS which is used as a webserver.\nI also want to add it as a cron job so that it runs automatically every day midnight at 12:00AM\n\n\nPrograms which i use in my VPS :\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache2\n\n*php5\n\n*MySQL\n\n*phpMyAdmin\n\n*sites-enabled\n\n*SSL\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Look into using rsync to perform the actual backup to your other server:\nman rsync\n\nYou will need to know exactly what data you would like to backup, though. Just from the list of programs (if you are using the vanilla directories), you will want to at least backup:\n\n\n*\n\n*/var/lib/apache2\n\n*/var/log/apache2\n\n*/var/www\n\n*/etc/apache2\n\n*/var/lib/mysql\n\n\nFor scheduling the backup process, you can look into crontab:\nman crontab\n\nTips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to isolate the backup process to a specific user, then give it read access to the backup directories. I would highly recommend not using the root user to backup your data.\n\n*Make sure that your backup script is executable (chmod +x /my/backupscript)\n\n*rsync runs over SSH, so whatever is initiating the backup will need SSH access (man ssh-keygen).\n\n*Depending on what kind of data you are hosting, you will want to make sure and stop all processes that are using the backup directories. I would definitely recommend stopping MySQL at a minimum (service mysqld stop).\n\n*It's more efficient to make a local, compressed (man tar) backup of the data (for example, to /backups/mydata_$(date +%s).tgz), then rsync the local backup to your other server. Actively rsyncing the actual directories could lead to extended downtime on your db as your dataset grows.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 does not detect the touchpad on Samsung Ativ 8 Just installed Ubuntu 13.10 on my Samsung Ativ 8.

How can I get the UbuntuOne URL from a file in a bash script?\nHere's what my script does so far:\nI run the script via Nautilus Actions, and it requires one parameter and an URL in the clipboard. The parameter must be a FLAC file name.\nThe script checks that the URL in the clipboard is valid and also if the FLAC file is a valid FLAC file. It then extracts some of the tags and produce two HTML files. One containing information about the song, the other one adding a line in an ”index file” – a file with one line per song with links to the different HTML files and so on…\nAnyway, to run the script properly right now I need to do the following:\n1. In Nautilus, right click the file, then Ubuntu One → Publish\n2. Right click the file again, then Ubuntu One → Copy URL (sometimes I need to press F5 first for this to work properly)\n3. Right click the file again, then Nautilus Actions → FLAC tags to HTML\n4. The script then asks for a comment via Yad (”Yet Another Dialog” – a fork of Zenity)\nSo, all I want to do at the moment, is to eliminate step 1 and 2. It would be nice if the script could do that for me. The file name and path should be enough information for the script, I think.\n\nA: You can use the u1sdtool command line tool to interact with ubuntuone-syncdaemon from a script. The --publish-file and --info options should let you do what you need to do. You'll have to wait until the file is actually \"published\" before --info will include the URL to the public file, though.\n", "Q: Destroying service before removing the relation causes both services to hang at dying I deployed wordpress and mysql and add relation between wordpress and mysql.

When I want to destroy a service and its \"stuck\" in a dying state, using your wordpress deployment as an example:\njuju resolve wordpress/0\n\nnow if that fails to help the situation, ergo, it continues to go from hook to hook in an error state, I will destroy the machine with extreme predjudice. (note, this yields an unrecoverable machine, and should be treated with caution, as you would any rm -rf operation - this WILL destroy the machine in question)\nObtain the machine id from the command juju status - then:\n juju destroy-machine --force <machine_id>\n\nIf this continues to leave the mysql service in a state of distress, you can resolve it manually following the above workflow:\njuju resolve mysql/0\n\nif all else fails, and you dont care about the data\njuju destroy-machine --force <machine_id>\n\nIn relation to the log output - know that there is an effort to move juju away from using git, so stray issues like this do not crop up for end users. I don't have an ETA on when this feature will land but its WIP at current.\n", "Q: error when logging in flashes by too fast for me to read it I had to do a hard reset on my machine because my Ubuntu VM in VMWare Player was completely frozen and causing some strange behavior.

The easiest way is to open software-center and browse through the single categories, to see what applications are installed and which of those you don't need [at all]. \n\n*Furthermore you could use GUI applications, like computer-janitor or bleachBit, that do a decent job in freeing up space. \n\n\n*\n\n*Please use with care!!\n\n\n", "Q: How can I reduce Hysteresis in the clickpad area?

My NFS bindings in fstab looks like this:\n#NFS4 Share bindings\n/mnt/disk1 /NFS4/XBMC none bind 0 0\n/storage_pool /NFS4/XBMC_pool none bind 0 0\n\nand my NFS exports look like this:\n/NFS4 *(rw,fsid=0,insecure,async,no_subtree_check)\n/NFS4/XBMC *(rw,nohide,insecure,async,no_subtree_check)\n/NFS4/XBMC_pool *(rw,fsid=0,nohide,insecure,async,no_subtree_check,crossmnt)\n\nthe share /NFS4/XBMC works perfectly but /NFS4/XBMC_pool shows up empty.\nI hope someone can help me, if more info is needed I'll try and add it.\nI now tried to move my AUFS Branch mount to my /etc/rc.local instead of my fstab, like this:\nmount -t aufs -o br:/mnt/disk1=rw:/mnt/disk2,sum,create=mfs none /storage_pool\n\nI then restarted my server and now the folders and files from disk2 shows up in the AUFS branch. writing files to the branch still gives problems, in that it only tries to write to disk1, when tried from my windows desktop, it reports back that there is not enough disk space, but only disk1 is full.\nhope someone can help me.\nregards\nnick\n\nA: I have found the problem related to my AUFS branch, the mount command was faulty.\nInstead of:\nmount -t aufs -o br:/mnt/disk1=rw:/mnt/disk2,sum,create=mfs none /storage_pool\n\nIt should be like this:\nmount -t aufs -o br:/mnt/disk1=rw:/mnt/disk2=rw -o sum -o udba=reval -o create=mfs none /storage_pool\n\nIt now mounts properly, writes new files to the disk with most space, and written directly to one of the disks are presented in the pool.\n", "Q: How do I get my Dashboard to advise anything but 'Sorry, there is nothing that matches your search'? The statement Sorry, there is nothing that matches your search comes as a result (virtually invariably) upon my entering just about anything in the command line or search string in Dashboard. \nThis is a problem, because it prevents me doing much of anything - including anything sudo.. (for example sudo ufw status or sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades. Seems therefore to be an important wall I just can't seem to get through, over, under, or around. I'm extremely new to Ubuntu (ver. 12.04.4), but have been using PCs for about 28 years, so I'm familiar with DOS and comfortable issuing commands in that manner - but I can't seem to get in the front door or to get the Dashboard's attention. \n\n\n*\n\n*I tried unity --replace &, installed unity-place-applications and also unity-place-files as well to no avail. \n\n\nIs there an easier, more direct way to sort this out (or do I just need to re-install the software)? \n\nA: I don't know if I can understand the question correctly but if you want to run command line tools from the dash then press alt+F2 instead of pressing the super key (windows key) but you should replace things like sudo with gksudo since it will not open in the terminal\na better solution would be to write terminal commands in the terminal itself \njust ctrl + alt + T to open the terminal then use the commands you need\n\nA: It sounds so to me like you are trying to use the Dash as the terminal. The search box in Dash will find files, programs etc on your computer. For example, to open Rhythmbox you would hit Super to open the Dash and then start typing in \"Rhythmbox\". As you type, you should get a live update that matches the letters you are typing. When you see the Rhythmbox icon pop up in results then would click on that icon to open the program. To run a command like sudo apt-get install you would need to open the Terminal by typing \"Terminal\" into the dash and clicking on it (or using the Ctrl+Alt+T to open the terminal) and then entering your sudo commands there. If the terminal doesn't open, or typing file name or program names into Dash still don't list results, then you have bigger problems.\n", "Q: Can ubuntu server be installed on <1G hds?

I'd like to know which Ubuntu distro is installed on my laptop. I know that it is Precise Pangolin, but is it Xubuntu, Lubuntu, plain Ubuntu or something else?\nWhen I run the usual lsb_release -a command, it says \"Ubuntu\", but running the same command after having booted from a Lubuntu installation USB-stick gives the same answer, so that is obviously not the answer.\nIs there another command that will tell me the answer? (Or some other means?)\n\nP.S. The GUI settings have been changed, so I cannot simply identify the look of the desktop visually.\nP.P.S. I found several questions on this topic, but they all seem to answer the question which version of Ubuntu is installed. Note that this is not what I'm asking for.\n\nA: The answer may not be totally straightforward because after the system is installed you can mix-and-match different components, including the desktop environment, applications etc. Everything is installed from the common repository so with time it may be difficult to tell what \"flavor\" of Ubuntu it is.\nFor example, on my laptop I used to have Ubuntu with Unity, but with time I replaced Unity with KDE and removed most of the default applications. Would you still consider it Ubuntu or is it Kubuntu now?\nSo maybe a better question to ask is \"what distro was originally installed on the machine?\" \nOn 12.04 I think you can check that with \ncat /etc/apt/sources.list|grep cdrom\n\nAt some point in 13.x series the format of files in /etc/apt has changed, so the above doesn't work anymore, but I think you can find some clues by doing\ncat /var/log/installer/media-info\n\nSee this question for more details\n", "Q: How can i have a good HTML report about my computer specifications?

In short, I'm considering this approach:\n1) install a base level Ubuntu from a DVD (say 12.04.3) on each Clone\n2) replace the /etc/apt/sources.list on each Clone with my own version of the file that has a single entry that points to a local server (say it's called \"Master\") on our network\n3) apt-get upgrade each Clone from that Master server\nA bit more detail:\nTo create the repository and add all the packages on that local server, I have seen this post:\nHow to create a local APT repository?\nQuestion 1: Is this approach ok? or am I completely off-base?\nHe says to use this line:\ndeb file:/my_repo/ ./\n\nwhere /my_repo is where I've stored all of the specific packages I want. And this post says I can use an ftp:/xx format:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man5/sources.list.5.html\nWhich means I only have to install an ftp daemon on the server.\nQuestion 2: Is this correct, i.e. just ftp daemon and a single line in the sources.list?\nTo initially populate the directory with packages, I can just\nscp -r me@some_well_configured_machine:/var/cache/apt/archives /my_repo/\n\nor on the Master machine:\ncp -r /var/cache/apt/archives /my_repo\n\nthat is, I can do a full directory tree copy from some other good machine or even from the Master machine itself.\nQuestion 3: Am I correct? (i.e. a simple directory tree copy?)\nEvery once in a while, to update the /my_repo/ directory on the Master server with the latest Ubuntu packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*I update the Master machine from the official Ubuntu repositories\n\n*copy the updated packages now in /var/cache/apt/archives into the /my_repo/ directory\n\n*On each Clone machine, apt-get upgrade\nQuestion 4: Will this work? Is there a better or simpler way?\nUpdate: The focus of all of this is having control of the changes made to these machines.\nSo hard disk cloning/ghosting won't work in this case. Once the machines are built, I need them to stay the same even if someone does an \"apt-get upgrade\". Stay the same, that is, until I change the Master (then after an upgrade of all of the machines, they are the same again). \n\nA: IF all your machines are identical(hardware wise) then..\nRather than installing ubuntu on all machines it will be better if you install and set up one machine completely and then just copy the hard disk bit by bit(there are such applications are available or even dd can do the trick). We used same approach in our computer lab where we wanted to set up 160 machines. This works like a charm and saves a lot of time.\n\nA: First With respect to your questions there. Yes the approach in that question is correct and I tried myself before. (For other questions about ftp its better to ask each question alone)\nBut to be more valuable and easy for you to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Your needed packages\n\n*Download Clonezilla live CD\n\n*Burn the iso file to a CD\n\n*Once you finish your initial machine reboot and start your Clonezilla Live CD and make a clone from your initial harddisk to others.\n\n\nCheck these screenshots here and be free to ask in details for any ambiguous menu entry.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Installation 12.04.4 I have 2 separate Hard Drives.

You will have to identify which is the blank IDE drive. It is very simple..the one which has some ntfs partitions on it is a SATA drive. while the one which shows completely unallocated space is your blank IDE drive. You can select the blank IDE drive and make partitions on it and then below in\nDevice for Bootloader installation\nselect your IDE hard disk(/dev/sda or /dev/sdb)\nOnce installation is complete you can restart your computer and at the time of booting just go to BIOS and select which hard disk you want to boot from.

Any help is welcome.\n\nA: For now you can put this command in /etc/rc.local.\nservice network-manager restart\n\nIn this way, every time you reboot/start PC NM will be started.\n\nA: A little strange that restarting Network Manager gets your networking back up after booting, but let's see if we can work around having to do that restart of it.\nFirst, let's look at your /etc/network/interfaces file. You can open this through terminal with gedit /etc/network/interfaces. It should read something like\n#The loopback network interace\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n#The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nWhere eth0 would be a wired connection or wlan would be a wireless connection. Use whichever interface is desired for your computer.\nNext, look at your /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf file. It should read something like:\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile\ndns=dnsmasq\n\nno-auto-default=00:30:48:70:D0:C3,\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=true\n\nYou will want the element of the no-auto-default= line to use the MAC hardware address of the eth0 or wlan interface, which you can get from running ifconfig in Terminal. You'll see a line that contains HWaddr 00:30:48:70:D0:C3 - the six-pair string is the MAC address to enter in that line.\nRestart your system, and if all goes well, Network Manager will start, connect your interfaces and you'll be ready to go.\n", "Q: Synaptic says Samba installed, can't launch it Ubuntu & Lubuntu 12.04\nI installed Samba with Synaptic Package Manager, but it doesn't show up on any of the Lubuntu menus.

I'm not overlooking something obvious, am I?\n\nA: In easy simple words:\nwhen you run samba in terminal then you  are calling the file serve window and if you are not installing before then you'll not find.\nThe packages you find in synaptic are part of these collections which are related to file sharing service that is founded by default in your system.\nTo be sure try to search for samba4 in synaptic which is the latest version of samba and you'll find that it's not installed.\nAlso notice that when you call samba in terminal thus you are running a command related to samba4.

I have installed Ubuntu 13.10. I have my files saved on a separate hard drive.  Now I want to put them back on my computer so I can access them in Ubuntu but I am nervous.\nDuring installation I erased the drive (I thought it would just replace Windows and leave my partitioned drive D reserved for files alone, but it didn't).\nI would like to partition my drive and use one partition for my files and the other for the OS like I had in Windows.\n\nA: Usually, the best is to partition the drive during install, or, in your case, leave the partitions as they are and install Ubuntu on the partion where windows is (replace it). \nBy default, Ubuntu uses the whole disk for installation. In your case you should have done the installation steps untill you can choose \"installation type\" and choose \"something else\" there. Then remove the windows partition and create a swap partition of, let's say 1GB and an ext4 partition to install the system on (mountpoint /). \nTo make the existing data partition available in the newly installed system, select it (in the same window) and choose \"Change\" (next to +-); keep the same file system as it already is and give it mountpoint /data or something you like. Do NOT format the partition! That way it would have been as you planned. \nIn this situation you can choose: do a reinstall and a repartitioning, or just copy your existing data to /home/\"yourname\". You could of course resize the partition to be able to create your data partition, but it is more \"clean\" to reinstall; you just installed Ubuntu and probably did not do too much work afterwards. All should take no more than just 30 minutes.\nhere are a few links to screenshots:\nchoose \"something else\"\n\nremove existing partitions:\n\ncreate new partitions (in your case somthing like 1x 20GB for Ubuntu, 2gb for swap, the rest for /data (the picture shows adding the swap partition)\nStart with the system partition, mountpoint /, then the data partition, /data, and finish with the swap partition. If you do it like that, Ubuntu will set the \"type of the new partition\" automatically correct.\n\nand ready to install:\n`\n", "Q: Is there any possible issue with changing the boot order often?

So, I decided not to use that. \n\nA: Changing the boot order frequently won't have any bad effect on your hardware, it will not corrupt anything.\n\nA: Put your Ubuntu HDD on top in your boot order list in the BIOS. After powering the pc, you should see the grub OS list, and you can choose which OS to boot. If you don't see that purple screen and the pc boots automatically to Ubuntu, try sudo update-grub2 on the command line of Ubuntu, to install grub to the MBR. (it won't corrupt any drives)\n\nA: You can use an easy-to-use the GUI application called Grub Customizer to make your life a little bit easier.

If yes, then how?\n\nA: Very simple, use option -lname:\nfind / -lname /path/to/original/dir\n\nFrom man find:\n-lname pattern\n       File is a symbolic link whose contents match shell pattern pattern.  The\n       metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.' specially.  If the -L option or the\n       -follow option is in effect, this test returns false unless the symbolic link\n       is broken.\n\nNote: Remember that symbolic links could be anywhere, which includes a remote system (if  you’re sharing files), so you may not be able to locate them all.\n\nA: Here is an example:\nfind -L /dir/to/start -xtype l -samefile ~/Pictures\n\nor, maybe better:\nfind -L /dir/to/start -xtype l -samefile ~/Pictures 2>/dev/null\n\nto get rid of some errors like Permission denied, Too many levels of symbolic links, or File system loop detected which find throws them when doesn't have the right permissions or other situations.\n\n\n*\n\n*-L - Follow symbolic links.\n\n*-xtype l - File is symbolic link\n\n*-samefile name - File refers to the same inode as name. When -L is  in  effect, this can include symbolic links.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use lowercase L in -xtype l, not the digit 1.\n\n*On macOS / Darwin, -xtype is -type.\n\n\nA: Try this :\nls -i ~/\n\n277566 Pictures\n\nfind . -follow -inum 277566 ( find directories with the same inode number )\nIt will display all its symbolic links paths .\n\nA: I like this one-liner the most: \nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type l -exec readlink -f '{}' \\;\nrefs:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/22128/how-to-get-full-path-of-original-file-of-a-soft-symbolic-link\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/21984/list-symlinks-in-current-directory\n", "Q: I cannot change between Windows VM and Linux Host When I open my Virtual Windows Machine  I cannot leave the screen and go to my Linux system.

I do not have the ntp package (which includes the ntpd daemon) installed at all.\n\n*How to force a clock update using ntp? - this guy's problem is that the ntpdate command wouldn't properly work at boot time when he put it into his /etc/rc.local, and the problem was similarly a conflict with the ntpd daemon that was running. Neither am I trying to run ntpdate at boot time, nor (again) do I have the ntpd daemon installed.\n\n*Unable to sync time using `ntpdate`, error: \"no server suitable for synchronization found\" - this is my error alright, but the accepted answer is basically \"Use ntpd instead of ntpdate\". Aaarggh...\n\n\nThings I have tried\nI installed the ntp package\n...and tried using the ntpd daemon instead of the ntpdate utility. It won't sync my time either; the daemon starts fine, but my clock remains off. I even tried using the exact /etc/ntp.conf from the accepted answer in the latter post, and restarting the daemon. No go. Anyway, I don't want to use the daemon. I am perfectly aware that ntpdate is considered \"deprecated\", and it is advised to use ntpd -q instead. Also see here:\n\n\n*\n\n*ntpd vs ntpdate: pros and cons\nBut since ntpd doesn't work for me either, the problem lies elsewhere.

This seems to happen randomly to clients even though they had both an IP address and MAC addresses (when \"arp\") during the initial boot up.\nAfter the MAC address is lost (incomplete), I am unable to ping or ssh to that client; nor does a reboot work.\nAnyone have ideas?\nDescription of LAN (closed system, not connected to the internet).\n- ~100 clients all set to static IP address through /etc/network/interfaces\n- ~1 core switch\n- ~16 access switches (daisy chained)\n- Linksys router\n\nA: MAC address can not be lost. MAC address is hardware address on nic. If you got incomplete that means that no network connection with IP address. \nI have same problem when network cable was damaged.\nMaybe is port on switch in problem.\n\nA: I suspect a damaged switch or loose cables/connection. Check your cables, connections, the switches.\nHere is an example I recently observed of how this can happen using wireless clients that loose connection:\n\n\n*\n\n*An android phone connects to the network. The router/dhcp server caches its name and IP address, something like this: android-1234567890 192.168.1.125\n\n*The phone goes to sleep, looses connection.\n\n*A service on a PC tries to connect the phone (e.g. pings).

In the case of my home PC i somehow managed to overwrite the MAC persistently to 12:34:56:78:90:ab . So i have a problem now with wake on lan.\nIn your case it seems that the problem can persist a reboot but not a shutdown/startup of a single pc.

I want to upgrade to the latest version of Ubuntu. Is it possible? I read on this forum that I have to do a serial upgrading. If that is  the case, will all my software installed  previously be safe or do I have to reinstall them again? what happens to my data after upgrading?\n\nA: Ubuntu offers two upgrade paths. The first is LTS->LTS and the second being stable release -> next stable release. In your case, you are running Ubuntu 10.04 which is a Long Term Stable (LTS) release. So if you want to the upgrade to the latest stable release which is 13.10 (at the time of this answer), your upgrade path would be 10.04->12.04->13.04->13.10. \nMy recommendation would be to wait until April 17th 2014 or later at which point Ubuntu 14.04 LTS will be released. You can then easily upgrade to it by 10.04->12.04->14.04 which is much shorter.\nNote: Always backup your personal data before performing an upgrade.

I have a simple notebook with no CD/DVD drive, so I am using a USB stick for it and I used this USB boot creator tool. The tool seems to work fine as Windows recognizes the USB stick as a Ubuntu install. I checked the md5 hash.\nI was able to boot the USB stick in EFI mode (following the Ubuntu help wiki page), but after a while in the Ubuntu typical loading screen I get to a terminal text screen with some \"kernel panic\" stuff and saying that it's \"going back to text mode\" or something like that. The problem is that after that nothing happens (need to force shutdown).\nI tried disabling UEFI and then boot the computer with the USB stick normally, but then after the typical loading screen I get a white screen with nothing and no options (need to force shutdown to leave, also).\nI have tried Ubuntu 12.04.4 in both Legacy mode and EFI mode and always I get to the white screen (after Ubuntu loading) without any further option (except forced shutdown). I also tried the 13.10 version, but the result was the same.\nI thought maybe it was a distribution problem, so I tried Linux Mint 16 (which is based on Ubuntu, but anyway) and also OpenSUSE. None of them worked. Mint X server crashed (at least I got to a terminal, but that was not what I wanted). OpenSUSE only got me more kernel panic text and I also needed to force shutdown.\n\nA: In order to be able to avoid the white/black screen and get to the live cd I needed to do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable UEFI (I couldn't just disable Secure Boot in my machine), so no Ubuntu in EFI mode for me.\n\n*Start the installer with two boot parameters: nolapic and nomodeset\nIn EFI mode I couldn't pass those parameters to the boot, so I was locked to the white/black screen. In the BIOS mode there is an easy way to pass the parameters, and so I could get to the installer and install. The problem is that now I need to choose the system by choosing either UEFI or BIOS, but at least I got both systems running.\n", "Q: Display configuration messed up I have a laptop and an external monitor.

Unfortunately I am no high flyer on regexp.\nWhat would the regexp be to parse to locate to show 1 occurrence of every bin dir, or can I better use a different pipe? \n\nA: locate -r '/bin$'\n\nwill only show paths that end with /bin.

Specifically, the path provided for the Icon field cannot be wrapped in quotes. Even if the path contains spaces, it must not be wrapped in quotes.\nOn the other hand, it's worth mentioning here that the path provided for the Exec field must be wrapped in quotes if it contains spaces. If it doesn't contain spaces, the quotes can be left off. This inconsistency in behavior is horribly confusing and should really be considered a bug.\nThus, the following is a valid .desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Firefox Developer Edition\nComment=The developer edition of Firefox Quantum.\nExec=\"/home/jack/Applications/Firefox Developer Edition/firefox\"\nIcon=/home/jack/Applications/Firefox Developer Edition/browser/chrome/icons/default/default32.png\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\n\nThe following will run, but not display the icon:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Firefox Developer Edition\nComment=The developer edition of Firefox Quantum.\nExec=\"/home/jack/Applications/Firefox Developer Edition/firefox\"\nIcon=\"/home/jack/Applications/Firefox Developer Edition/browser/chrome/icons/default/default32.png\"\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\n\nAnd the following won't even run:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Firefox Developer Edition\nComment=The developer edition of Firefox Quantum.\nExec=/home/jack/Applications/Firefox Developer Edition/firefox\nIcon=/home/jack/Applications/Firefox Developer Edition/browser/chrome/icons/default/default32.png\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\n\n\nA: this answer helped me in my case.\nThere was a stray space at the end of the path line that prevented the icon from appearing.\n\nA: Adding on to what others have said about finicky .desktop files. I've ran into this problem on Ubuntu 20.04 with a custom existing .desktop file that did not have an icon associated with it initially. Adding the Icon section to the .desktop file did not make the icon show. I found that doing an edit to the file that gtk-launch did not like, and then reverting that change, caused the icon to show.\n\nA: If your Exec path is too long, try separating that to multiple line using \\\nFor me, Brave Browser was not working.\nHere's how I fixed it,\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=New Tab - Brave\nIcon=brave-browser\nExec=/opt/brave.com/brave/brave --disable-chrome-google-url-tracking-client --disable-domain-reliability \\\n --disable-features=AutofillServerCommunication,TranslateUI,NetworkService,UnifiedConsent --enable-dom-distiller \\\n --enable-features=NewExtensionUpdaterService,SimplifyHttpsIndicator --extensions-install-verification=enforce_strict --no-pings\nStartupNotify=false\nStartupWMClass=Brave-browser\nX-BAMFGenerated=true\nMimeType=x-scheme-handler/mailto;text/html;\n\n\nA: In my case, on Ubuntu 18.04 the Icon value was not read because of an extra comment at the end of the line (#...), so just delete extra space, comments and any quotes and it should work properly.\n\nA: I run the .desktop file with gtk-launch, this fixed my issue, I don't know why but it works\n", "Q: \"Dummy output\" and no sound when update to the latest HDA drivers My system keeps asking for an HDA drivers update, but everytime I update those drivers to the latest version, sound disappers and only \"Dummy output\" is available as a choice in the Audio settings panel.

Running chkdsk /b from Windows will test the blocks marked as bad and hopefully clear them, allowing you to proceed.  If not, then you may need to replace the disk.  In any case, you should open the disk utility and check the SMART health of the disk.\n\nA: You can try booting to windows, run ckkdsk, and try resizing with the Windows tools.\nKeep in mind:\nFirst, the Linux tools are reverse engineered and there at times with they can not manage / repair NTFS partitions. On such occasions you will need to fall back to the Windows tools.\nSecond, yes there are times when the Windows resize tool limits how much you can reduce the size of your NTFS volumes.

I would also really like to start the GUI if I absolutely need it for something, but since I have file access through the network, I don't think I will be using it much.\nI need to know what I need to do with both my Windows machine and my Linux machine (obviously), so if someone has a solution to all of these, that would be great. \nI also want the machine to run as efficiently as possible, so as long as I can control everything from my Windows machine.\nThanks!\n\nA: You don't need a GUI for the usages you describe.  You definitely don't need X or GNOME or anything like that.  I recommend that you enable an SSH server on your Ubuntu box by typing sudo apt-get install openssh-server. \nThen, install PuTTY on your Windows box Link.  With this configuration you can remote into your server from your windows box.\nIf you absolutely need X access, you can configure PuTTY to forward X to your Windows machine, but you'll need to install an X server like Xming for this to work Link\n", "Q: Help on resizing my LVM partitions I need help on resize two LVM partitions as I'm afraid of loosing data.\nI'm using Ubuntu Server 12.04 headless mode.\nLVS:\nroot@server:/# lvs\n  LV      VG   Attr   LSize   Origin Snap%  Move Log Copy%  Convert\n  home    LVG  -wi-ao  27,94g\n  root    LVG  -wi-ao   6,52g\n  storage LVG  -wi-ao 504,84g\n  swap    LVG  -wi-ao 732,00m\n\nFDISK:\nroot@server:/# fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 80.0 GB, 80026361856 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 9729 cylinders, total 156301488 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00067ea1\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048      585727      291840   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2          587774   156301311    77856769    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5          587776   156301311    77856768   8e  Linux LVM\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders, total 976773168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0008c066\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1            2048   976771071   488384512   8e  Linux LVM\n\nDisk /dev/mapper/LVG-root: 6996 MB, 6996099072 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 850 cylinders, total 13664256 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDisk /dev/mapper/LVG-root doesn't contain a valid partition table\n\nDisk /dev/mapper/LVG-swap: 767 MB, 767557632 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 93 cylinders, total 1499136 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDisk /dev/mapper/LVG-swap doesn't contain a valid partition table\n\nDisk /dev/mapper/LVG-home: 30.0 GB, 29997662208 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 3647 cylinders, total 58589184 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDisk /dev/mapper/LVG-home doesn't contain a valid partition table\n\nDisk /dev/mapper/LVG-storage: 542.1 GB, 542063460352 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 65902 cylinders, total 1058717696 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDisk /dev/mapper/LVG-storage doesn't contain a valid partition table\n\nI want to shrink my /home LV partition and extent my /storage LV partition.\nWhat is the proper method to do this?\nThanks\n\nA: You have to use vgreduce on the home device and vgextend on the storage device. After that youhave to use resize2fs on both to resize the file system, if not, it will no show the changes.\n\nA: The lvresize command is used for altering the size of logical volumes, and can be used to \"trade\" extents among two LVs within the same volume group.\nThe most important flag to supply when using lvresize on non-empty / active volumes is the -r flag, which, from the man page:\n   -r, --resizefs\n          Resize  underlying  filesystem  together with the logical volume\n          using fsadm(8).\n\nAs long as the -r flag is included, lvresize will  change the size of the filesystem on the logical volume to fit the new size of the LV (automatically relocating any occupied blocks in the area to be reduced, when shrinking a volume), which will ensure that no data is lost.\nThe other important flags, for typical use, are the -L and -l flags for specifying the logical volume's target size, or size delta. Again, the man page:\n   -l, --extents [+|-]LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|LV|PVS|FREE|ORIGIN}]\n          Change or set the  logical  volume  size  in  units  of  logical\n          extents.   With  the  +  or - sign the value is added to or sub‐\n          tracted from the actual size of the logical volume  and  without\n          it,  the value is taken as an absolute one.  The total number of\n          physical extents affected will be  greater  than  this  if,  for\n          example,  the  volume  is  mirrored.   The  number  can  also be\n          expressed as a percentage of the total space in the Volume Group\n          with  the suffix %VG, relative to the existing size of the Logi‐\n          cal Volume with the suffix %LV, as a percentage of the remaining\n          free  space  of the PhysicalVolumes on the command line with the\n          suffix %PVS, as a percentage of the remaining free space in  the\n          Volume  Group  with  the  suffix %FREE, or (for a snapshot) as a\n          percentage of the total space in the Origin Logical Volume  with\n          the suffix %ORIGIN.  The resulting value is rounded downward for\n          the subtraction otherwise it  is  rounded  upward.   N.B.  In  a\n          future  release,  when expressed as a percentage with PVS, VG or\n          FREE, the number will be treated as an approximate total  number\n          of  physical extents to be allocated or freed (including extents\n          used by any mirrors, for example).  The code may currently allo‐\n          cate or remove more space than you might otherwise expect.\n\n   -L, --size [+|-]LogicalVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE]\n          Change  or set the logical volume size in units of megabytes.  A\n          size suffix of M for megabytes, G  for  gigabytes,  T  for  ter‐\n          abytes, P for petabytes or E for exabytes is optional.  With the\n          + or - sign the value is added or  subtracted  from  the  actual\n          size  of  the logical volume and rounded to the full extent size\n          and without it, the value is taken as an absolute one.\n\nBeyond that, -v provides verbose output, -t test runs.\nSo, to shrink /home by ~50GB, and then add that space to /storage, you could use:\n# test run\nlvresize -t -v -r -L-50G LVG/home\n\n# If all looks good, shrink for real\nlvresize -v -r -L-50G LVG/home\n\n# Give it all to /storage\nlvresize -v -r -l+100%FREE LVG/storage\n\nAll of this Growing partitions can even be done with the volumes mounted, in use, and even actively transferring data during the resize operations. LVM will simply work \"underneath\" the other disk activity to reconfigure the volumes. (At a cost of speed, of course.)\n", "Q: Online virus scanners for linux Can we scan the drive online to scan and remove the virus files?\nIf there where can i find them?

Even in case of the Live distribution you should be able to install software (obviously it will be not available after computer restart)\n\n*try to search for Antivirus Rescue CDs. They will include antivirus software which runs directly from bootable CD\n\n\nA: The Clam antivirus is useless for cleaning a windows PC, or the windows partition of a dual-boot linux/windows PC, or a virtual OS, or running windows via Wine - because - the scan literally takes at least 12-24hrs - and it finds THOUSANDS of potentially infected files - which requires you to go through ALL of them, one at a time, and double check each file online - one at a time - it's completely useless.\nIf I, or members of the general public, could DO that - I/we wouldnt NEED an antivirus scanner/cleaner program - we would simply go through our windows partition manually and delete the infected files & registry entries.\nI have yet to find a user-friendly, USEFUL antivirus that you can use Linus to disinfect a windows PC.. apparently no one thinks they will get PAID if you can do it yourself.\n", "Q: What is the difference between installing software from terminal or via software center?

I can also wget things.

This way you will be able to see it in Ubuntu and Windows without the need for any other steps. If you can not do this, then the next best thing would be to re-partition your 3TB drive to something smaller. Like 2TB. Then format the 2TB with NTFS (Using an app like gparted).

I am using a standard WiFi home connection.\n\nA: There could be several things going on here:\n1) Check the VM is configured to use bridging for the network.  By default, Virtualbox sets networking to NAT which will give you a 10.x.x.x IP on the guest rather than a suitable IP for your network;\n2) Make sure the hostname for the guest can be resolved by the DNS on the network.  You could just connect via the IP instead of the hostname in the meantime;\n3)  Make sure the Apache service is running on the host. sudo service apache2 start\n4) If you have configured a firewall on the guest, make sure it's allowing traffic through port 80.\n5)  Do some simple troubleshooting.  e.g. ping your lab machine from the VM guest, ping the VM guest from the VM host, ping the VM guest from your lab machine, etc...\nApologies if some, or all, of this is teaching you to suck eggs but detail was lacking in the post.  Plus, I still continue to be caught out by one or more of the above on occasion.\nRob\nUPDATE:\nApologies, I have a hectic work schedule so I don't often get a chance to visit here.\nThe message you see about Apache not being able to resolve the hostname is due to the hostname not being in either /etc/hosts or defined in your DNS.  Do this, and that message will go away.\nIf you cannot get to your webserver with http://yourservername:80 then make sure port 80 has been opened on the firewall.\nYou can use nmap to check that the port is open\nIf necessary, install nmap sudo apt-get install nmap\nnmap yourservername\n\nThis should give you a list of currently open ports.

Again, this effect will be applied to a selection of our audio files.\nNormalize\nNormalizing audio will try to stretch the volume range over possible values. Unlike a compressor (above) it will preserve the dynamic of a recording.\nRepair\nIn case of very short artifacts (clicks or the like) we can try to remove these wit the repair tool. This tool will try to interpolate the audio values from before and after the artifact to remove a tiny bit of our sample (less than 128 sample only).\n", "Q: How to launch a newly installed program I have just downloaded and installed Google Chrome for Linux, using Software Center.

Ubuntu and Lubuntu have different \"Supported until\" dates for Precise Pangolin (since Ubuntu have LTS releases, but Lubuntu does not). \nWhat exactly does this mean, for me as a user, if I have Lubuntu installed, given that both distros use the same apt repository? – Will I not get security updates for Lubuntu-related packages after April 2013? If so, which packages are those? Or are there any other consequences?\nP.S. Ubuntu Precise Pangolin is supported until April 2017, while Lubuntu Precise Pangolin is supported until October 2013.\nEDIT: Added the bold text.\nEDIT 2: I'm wondering what updates etc. I'll get be on a Lubuntu system after October 2013. (Given that both distros use the same apt repo, and that apt repo will continue to be updated until mainline Ubuntu is no longer supported, in April 2017.)\n\nA: Lubuntu 12.04 it's NOT the LTS and it will come to an EOL like the rest of non-LTS releases. Trusty Tahr 14.04 will be the first Lubuntu LTS release with five years of support.\nFrom official website dedicated to Lubuntu documentation.\nPlease note that Lubuntu 12.04 is not an LTS (5 years support), but a standard release, supported for 18 months. This is simply due the fact there is insufficient 'man-power' to commit to 5 years of support.\n*You will receive updates for 5 years, yet not for all of your packages including LXDE.\n(for example packages by Canonical or Ubuntu One Team: Ubuntu One or Firefox won't be updated for Lubuntu) Yet if you curious about every single package, when you'll be on Lubuntu run:\napt-cache show packagename | grep ^Supported\n\nand you'll see if it's supported yet or not on your current system.\nP.S.\nAnd it's actually 12.10 that is still supported. And Ubuntu 12.10 comes to an EOL this April 2014 and 12.10 it's not LTS either. And no you will not get support, fixes, security updates for an EOL version of Ubuntu/Xubuntu/Lubuntu etc...\n\nA: Ubuntu and Lubuntu share the same software repositories. The main difference between Ubuntu and Lubuntu is that Ubuntu installs the package ubuntu-desktop, while Lubuntu installs the package lubuntu-desktop, with all dependencies that entails.\nIn fact, you can even install one atop the other, e.g., in an Ubuntu system, issue the command sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop and you will end up with a \"hybrid\" system with both the Ubuntu packages and the Lubuntu packages, e.g., both Unity and LXDE. (Also see Lubuntu vs. lubuntu-desktop)\nNow, clearly, the lion share of the base system is exactly the same. So even though Lubuntu 12.04 is supported only through October 2013, as the Ubuntu 12.04 repos will be maintained through April 2017, you will also receive many package updates on Lubuntu 12.04.\nI guess that what will not be maintained is only some Lubuntu-specific development, as well as support from the Lubuntu team. You can start here for an overview of what development is specific to Lubuntu.\nPlease note that I do not want to encourage using a Lubuntu version that has reached its end of life. I'm just saying there will be many package updates still. :)\n", "Q: How to create a Bookmark that opens a Network shared folder I am trying to create a bookmark that when I right click the Files icon in the Launcher and select the bookmark it will open the desire network shared folder.\nRight now it only opens if I have previously opened the shared folder by going through the Browse Network option.

I was just wondering since i have the 12.04 lts ubuntu edition if it's possible to upgrade it to 13.04 or even 14.04 after it gets released without losing any of my files and installed apps?\nThat's actually the main reason i chose the LTS version because i didn't know if i had to re-install all my apps every time a new ubuntu version gets released.\n\nA: Yes, you can. However, the restriction is the versions you can upgrade to.\nUbuntu's versioning scheme is that 12.04 and 14.04 are LTS releases and are supported for a longer period of time than non-LTS releases, which are the releases inbetween (12.10, 13.04, 13.10). Due to support length changes before 13.04 was released, the current supported non-LTS releases are 12.10 and 13.10 (13.04 has reached End-Of-Life).\nAs for upgrading, you cannot directly upgrade from 12.04 (LTS) to 13.04 (non-LTS) (nor can you upgrade to 13.04 in any way, since it is EOL); You will have to go through 12.10, and then jump to 13.10. Usually, for non-LTS releases, you have to go through each version inbetween.\nHowever, you will be able to upgrade directly from 12.04 (LTS) to 14.04 (LTS) when 14.04 is released.\n", "Q: Partition Scheme Questions in Dual Boot Ubuntu/Windows installation I just got a new laptop with Windows 8 and I am ready to install Ubuntu. I see the hard drive already has quite a few partitions, most of which seem related to Windows recovery. \nSee capture: \nI am not allowed to post images, so I am including a link to the capture instead.\nPartitions on my computer\nI think I should probably avoid touching those partitions, if I want to keep the factory system recovery options. Any comments on this?\nI see there is a partition marked as Active & Boot, a 300 MB FAT32 partition with type EFI System Partition. Is anyone familiar with this type of partition? When installing UBUNTU should I somehow use this partition for grub or something like that? If so, how would I do that?\nThe disk has 1000GB.\nI am thinking I would like to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize the main partition (Acer/NTFS) with Windows. Not sure what the minimum size should be. Is 80GB OK? Too small? Too large?\n\n*Use the freed up space to create the rest of partitions... But I think I will need to create an extended partition, because there are already too many partitions, am I right?\n\n*Create a Windows data partition (NTFS) with maybe 200-300 GB\n\n*Create an UBUNTU OS partition. EXT4 ok? Or is there a better filesystem for the OS? What about size? Maybe 50 GB? 100 GB?\n\n*Create a swap partition, maybe 16GB because that's the maximum RAM allowed in the system. Or maybe I can set it to exactly 8GB as the current size of RAM and resize later if needed?\n\n*Create a data partition for /home, with the remaining space (probably around 500-600 GB).\n\n\nNOW, I am thinking I would like the /home partition to be visible to Windows. To do so I believe I would need to use NTFS as filesystem for that partition. Does this make sense at all? Maybe UBUNTU is more comfortable (faster access, etc) with EXT4 or other Linux filesystem and I would sacrificing performance? If a linux filesystem should be used is EXT4 the best or other?\n\nA: You don't need to -- and in fact can't -- create an extended partition. This is because the disk uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT).\nUsing NTFS for /home is a bad idea at best, and impossible at worst, because you must be able to use Unix/Linux filesystem features in /home that NTFS doesn't provide. Instead, you should either use a Windows filesystem driver for a Linux filesystem or create some other non-/home partition for sharing files. (You could mount that partition within your home directory -- say, /home/user254803/shared -- if you wanted to.) I believe there are some decent ext2/3fs drivers for Windows, but I don't know how well they cope with ext4fs. Windows drivers for other filesystems are much more primitive or non-existent, AFAIK.\nThe 300MB FAT partition is an EFI System Partition (ESP), which holds boot loaders. Ubuntu should detect and use it automatically. (The Ubuntu installer refers to it as an \"EFI boot partition\" and treats it a little differently from other partitions.)\nYou may want to check my Web page on EFI installations and/or the Ubuntu community wiki on EFI to learn more on the subject. EFI is very different from BIOS in the boot stage, and the differences between MBR and GPT have implications (mainly no logical partitions), but in terms of Linux partitions and how to make room for Linux, it's pretty similar to any other installation -- the arguments for and against a separate /home partition, sizing issues, etc., are all the same as they are on a BIOS-based computer.\n\nA: I finally succeeded in installing and booting both Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 12.04.\nThis is what I did:\nPartitions\nI converted the large 913GB NTFS partition with Windows 8.1 into:\n- NTFS Windows 8.1: 118 GB\n- NTFS Windows Data: 188 GB\n- EXT4 Ubuntu 12.04: 118 GB\n- EXT4 Ubuntu Data: 481 GB\n- Linux Swap: 8 GB\nThis is what it looks like after all these changes.\nhttp://www.freeimagehosting.net/newuploads/qw25t.png\nUbuntu installation did not leave everything ready. I could boot into Windows 8.1 but not Ubuntu. I had to run the Boot Repair and that did it. Unfortunately, I cannot remember the exact options I chose.\nOther Settings\nIn the BIOS I had to turn the UEFI Boot Mode off, as it was forcing Secure boot. I had to set the boot mode to Legacy. Secure boot was giving me all kinds of problems, such as not being able to boot from CD/DVD.\nAlso, In Windows 8.1 I had to turn off the Turn on Fast Startup option, as it was keeping the computer from shutting down completely in Windows, and creating problems with booting in general after installing Ubuntu. I cannot enter more than 2 links per post, so I will add another reply with a link to show what I mean.\nError Before Boot Menu\nEven though I can boot into both Ubuntu and Windows, I am getting an error message right before the grub menu, that reads: Error: efidisk read error. It is shown for just one second and then I get the boot menu. \nNot sure whether this is a serious issue. I am thinking maybe I should run Boot Repair again, but since I am able to boot without problems I have refrained. I thought I would post the report from Boot Repair here, in case someone with experience can tell me whether to attempt to fix that and point me in the right direction.\nFor instance, should I turn UEFI boot mode (and thus secure boot) back on?\nWhat is the problem if I keep it turned off?\nThis is the Boot Repair report:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/7063312/\nAs you can see the boot menu has a lot of options. For some reason Windows 8.1 has two options, but they boot the same...\nThanks!\nJuan\n\nA: I cannot call this a full answer yet. ..\nUefi and even secure boot which is the idea of a signed kernel are good ideas. That said the \"secure boot\" you are referring to is a very closed Microsoft implementation of the more general uefi and secure boot standards. Microsoft s key and verification mechanism is the one pre-configured by the oem. Somehow you must get your kernel's signature into the system database or it won't load. All of the solutions to date rely upon Microsoft and Verisign and are seemingly opposed by the FSF.\n I am trying to  use uefi (the efi partition) without secure boot on a hp laptop. My first attempt I accidentally over wrote the efi partition and made Windows unbootable. The idea is to get grub listed as a uuid entry. Ideally I would like win8/fedora/kubuntu. Both are supposed to be usable with secure boot on, as they have purchased keys. I got just fedora to boot and have not tried again,   however I am working it backwards, turning things on one at a time. \n", "Q: Why are my juju relation hooks not running?

As such, the hook never completed and essentially froze the state of that service. I thought it was working because the api that I was setting up would respond. The process that froze it was a foreground uwsgi process.\nHowever, debug-hooks was not running because the node was frozen. What I didn't realize is that the tmux session opens a new session for each hook. So the initial session will not have the capabilities shown in the documentation...

I am running Ubuntu Gnome 3.10, can I install Unity on Gnome, or will it break Gnome?\nOr should I do a fresh install?\nThanks\n\nA: There was an issue with Gnome 3.10 breaking Unity a few months back, but that has been fixed.   More in that issue here and here. However, I know of no issues with Unity breaking Gnome.\nIf you wish to install Unity you can either use the command line(terminal) or the Software Center(can't remember what it is called in Gnome, Munon?)\nIn a terminal type\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nin the Software Center search for ubuntu-desktop -search exactly as typed, including the hypen to find it easier.\nEither way will download and install Unity and all the programs that go with it....In my system it shows as 9.5MB to download and 32MB once installed but I think that is only the Unity desktop, with all other programs, I would expect it to be near 100MB download, about 300MB after install.\n\nAfter you install Unity select \"Ubuntu\" as the DE on login by clicking on the icon in the upper right of the box you type your password in.  The menu will open allowing you to select Gnome or Unity.  \nYou can switch between them without rebooting but you will have to log out of one and into the other so you will lose any unsaved info when you log out.\n\nA: Yes, ain't gonna break Gnome. Just select \"Unity 2d\" from login screen, or if you want to use both at same time (Unity and Gnome-shell) , there's a option for activate Unity in Compiz settings.\n", "Q: Increase Ubuntu partition size under virtual machine I use MacBook with Mac OS X 10.9.1. I have installed VMWare Fusion 6.0.2, under which Ubuntu 12.04 LTS has been installed as virtual machine.\nNow I need to increase the size of the disk of Ubuntu. GParted shows that there is 80G unallocated:\n\nHowever, right-clicking on the first partition shows that Resize/Move is gray, then I don't know how to continue...\nPS: this post seems to have same problem as I. If so, could anyone tell me how to Boot from the Ubuntu LiveCD under VMWare Fusion?\nEdit1:\nI have set up the following in VMWare to try to Boot from the Ubuntu LiveCD:\n\n\n\nOnce started, it is odd that I didn't see anything different from a boot from hard disk... Still, I opened terminal, turned swap off, and launched GParted. In GParted, I deleted the swap (as well as the whole extended partition containing it). However, I could not resize/move /dev/sda1. Could anyone help?\n\nEdit2:\nFollowing the comment of @Hadi , I think creating another disk is not a bad idea, a disk usage analysis shows the follows. Could anyone suggest which of my folders should be mounted to a newly created disk?\n\n\nA: You have to boot from Ubuntu live disk.So that you can be able to resize your installed Ubuntu partition on Virtualbox.\n\n\n*\n\n*First Right-click on the Ubuntu virtual machine and select settings option.From the settings menu, select Storage option.Finally choose CD/DVD virtual disk file(choose an iso file of Ubuntu in which you want to boot).I had choosed Ubuntu 13.04 iso file.\n\n\n*Now from the Ubuntu settings, select System option.From the boot-order, enable only CD/DVD option and put it on the top.\n\n\n*Now strat the selected Ubuntu virtual machine(Ubuntu is name given for my virtual machine).\n\n*It will boot from the iso file(live disk) you have to select Try Ubuntu option on startup.Then open gparted from dash.\n\nIn my case /dev/sr0 represents Ubuntu 13.04 live disk and /dev/sda1 represents the partition where Ubuntu 13.10 is installed.\n\n*Now You can be able to unmount all the /dev/sda disk partitions like in the above screenshot.\n\n*Resize your /dev/sda1 ext4 partition by adding the unallocated space with it or just add some space from the free space then using the remaining space, create an extended partition(make a swap within it).\n\n*After resizing, shutdown the virtual machine and change the boot-order to Hard-disk on virtual machine settings.\n\n*It will boot from the hard-disk.Now your Ubuntu partition size will be resized.\nNote: I am running Virtual box not vmware fusion.\n\nA: All of above answers are right and whatever but I advise you by this:\nWhy should you extend your partition. You need more space Ok that's fine so you can just make another partition and move your home to. \nWhat I mean the following: \nMost user data are located under /home/... directories so what I'll do here is just create a new partition of your unallocated space and make your /home be mounted on. This has critical useful effect on your system in case of failure.\n\nFor multi-user systems or systems with lots of disk space, it's best to put /usr, /var, /tmp, and /home each on their own partitions separate from the / partition. source\n\nNow let's go.\nFirst using Gparted make the new partition and format it to ext4.\nNow let's know the UUID of the newly created partition.\nsudo blkid\n\ncopy the UUID of the newly created partition.\nNow let's move your home to this partition\nOpen your /etc/fstab\ngksu gedit /etc/fstab\n\nadd the following line:\nUUID=THE COPIED UUID ABOVE /home           ext4    defaults        0       2\n\nNow save and reboot then Enjoy :)\n\nA: You can insert the ISO image of Ubuntu into the VMWare's CD drive, and you should be able to run a live session of Ubuntu from there.\n\nA: actually gparted itself can help.  When you initialize the disk/format it as linux type 8e, it actually assigns /dev/sda3 as disk id.  Then you can use \" fdisk /dev/sda\" to see and list it..\nRest is easy, extending the volume group to see the disk, with vgextend, lvdisplay, pvextend ...\n\nA: If you just want to have more space, no matter whether by increasing the size of an existing partition or by creating a new partition, you can simply create a new partition and mount it.\nYou can use gparted to create a new partition, for example, /dev/sda3 of file system ext4, out of your unallocated space:\n$ sudo gparted\n\nThen edit /etc/fstab to mount automatically each time you boot the computer:\n$ sudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nAnd add the following line:\n/dev/sda3 /home/yourname/mydata ext4 defaults 0 0\n\nNow reboot your VM, and you shall see your newly create file system:\n$ df -h\n/dev/sda3       78.8G   23M  78.2G   1% /home/yourname/mydata\n\n", "Q: How do you know if you can add 64 bit version of Lubuntu?

It allows taking snapshots and easier partition resizing)\n\nI'm a writer using the computer for mostly writing ebooks but I also do all the things most people do: buy stuff online, online banking etc. I want my information to be safe but I don't want to overburden my system with security stuff either. And I've read a lot of the similarly themed questions here on the forum but they've all been about stuff more technical than I'm concerned about. \nCan somebody please just tell me in real layman's terms about the implications of these two choices? Thank you.\n\nA: \n1) Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security (you will choose a security key in the next step).\n\nWhat Does This Option Mean\nBy enabling this option you enable complete encryption of your Ubuntu partition on your hard drive. Every time you boot your computer into Ubuntu you'll need to provide a passphrase so that you can access your Ubuntu partition. Note that this is separate from the password you use to log into a user, which you would still need to provide after giving your passphrase.\nWhen you don't encrypt, your data is shown in plain text which anyone can read; data is not stored with security in mind. In a situation where your computer is stolen, the thieves could easily read any data contained in your operating system. Your user password does not necessarily protect your data because the thieves could just use a Ubuntu LiveCD (for example) to bypass this to gain access.\nIn other words, your password is like the front door key to your house which contains nicely organized valuables (data). Unfortunately, there are alternatives to bypassing this security, like smashing a window, so in the end a thief won't have much trouble finding and stealing anything of value in your organized home.\nAdvantage\nThe advantage of encrypting your Ubuntu partition is you can be confident that an \"attacker\" that has physical access to your drive will be highly unlikely to recover any data at all. Remember, this will include data which you may not consider important, such as your program files, since the entire Ubuntu partition gets encrypted.\nTo continue with the analogy, your house is now a complete dump; encrypted data appears scrambled and random. Even if the thief gains access to the house they will have a hard time finding/ getting anything of value.\nDisadvantages\nThe disadvantages (at least as many I can think of or have come across) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is some computational overhead, meaning your system will run slower. Although, this is usually insignificant with modern CPUs with AES-NI hardware.\n\n*You have to remember a passphrase, as well as a login password to start using Ubuntu.\n\n*If you use anti-theft software like Prey, the thief will have a hard time logging in. Hence, these anti-theft tools can become useless. However, this can be circumvented by giving the thief an alternative dummy OS partition to use that you wouldn't normally use yourself.\n\n*Data recovery becomes more difficult since you can't just 'look' at your partition, you have to also decrypt it as well.\n\n*Losing or forgetting your passphrase will mean you will lose access to important data; you will be considered no different to a thief. This really should never happen unless you suffer a severe head injury. Although, you can avoid this unexpected disaster by backing up important data elsewhere, which you should be doing regardless.\n\n\nAlso...\nIt should be said that there is a 'lighter' weight way of encrypting by just encrypting your Ubuntu '/home'; /home is usually where anything of value is stored for a typical user). When using this method, you only need the user password when booting and logging in. The passphrase which you choose is only ever used specifically by you when you need to recover data and you are unable to login anymore, for instance, because your Ubuntu somehow became corrupted.\n\n2) Use LVM with the new Ubuntu installation (this will set up Logical Volume Management. It allows taking snapshots and easier partition resizing)\n\nThis page summaries LVM well. Essentially, if you plan on playing around with partitions often or require advanced and flexible partitioning then you may want to consider ticking this to make life easier. There aren't really any disadvantages for a typical user.\n\nA: An enormous DISADVANTAGE (for me) if you use option no. 1 and encrypt your hard drive, is that:\n1) if you forget or lose your pass-phrase/key you lose everything and cannot access anything again, and\n2) if your Ubuntu installation completely beaks apart (does not boot, get corrupted etc) or if your PC hardware fails,  at least all your files are in the clear and you can still read them on any computer !\n", "Q: What is the purpose of /etc/default? I've assumed /etc/default was a handy place to save the post-install/default state of configuration files so that when some poor sysadmin arrives at a new system she can quickly determine what has been customised on that instance.\nBut having just had a look around in there it seems I am mistaken?  So apologies if this is a dumb question...\n\n\n*\n\n*What's supposed to be in the /etc/default directory?\n\n*Where would it be appropriate, or is there a convention, for saving the default state of config files?\n\n\nA: From a post on a Slackware forum:\n\nBasically, /etc/default contains some parameters that the end user or administrator is likely to change, rather than embedding the values in the actual boot scripts. In this way, changes will persist even if you upgrade the package and the boot script is replaced.\n\nIn Debian, /etc/default/ is a directory of mostly empty files.  The way it is meant to work is that each /etc/init.d/test script first sources /etc/default/test before starting/stopping the test service.  The purpose of the file is to provide extra options for starting the service, or override certain aspects of the service's startup.\n", "Q: Gnome 3.12 compatibility with gnome 13.1 I just wanted to ask, does the new gnome release fix the compatibility issues that are present in gnome 3.1 for Ubuntu 13.10?\nI can't stand unity desktop but I put off installing gnome 3.10 because when I tried it, I had a few issues that resulted in me having to re-install the OS to fix ( i.e. vanishing mouse for example).\n\nA: Turns out the problem is solved, well at least it is in Ubuntu 14.04; it can work with gnome 3.10 without issues, just need to download it from app centre, which I'm going to do after I update to 14.04.\n", "Q: FFMPEG | How to encode a video to make it faster Good day people,\nI was wondering how to encode a video from a speed of 1 x to a one of 5 x, using ffmpeg. \nThanks in advance for any suggestion.\n\nA:  \nChange Video Speed\n \nSpeed Up(5x)\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]setpts=0.2*PTS[v];[0:a]atempo=5.0[a]\" -map \"[v]\" -map \"[a]\" output.mp4\n\n\n*\n\n*Here, setpts=0.2, atempo=5.0\n\nSlow down(5x)\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]setpts=5.0*PTS[v];[0:a]atempo=0.2[a]\" -map \"[v]\" -map \"[a]\" output.mp4\n\n\n*\n\n*Here, setpts=5.0, atempo=0.2\n\nsetpts:\n\n*\n\n*If you want to speed up the video 2x,  setpts will be 0.5(1/2).

I'm a new Ubuntu user and I live in Iran. I have problems opening many sites, even Google services.\nI cannot buy a VPN account..\nWhat can I do to access sites when access is restricted in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The safest bet is to use the Tor network to access sites that your ISP has blocked. In Ubuntu, you can download Tor through the Software Center or with the terminal command:\nsudo apt-get install tor\n\nThen, use the torify command to run programs and have network requests automatically sent through the Tor proxy network. For example:\ntorsocks firefox\n\nOr, to do software upgrades...\nsudo -i\ntorsocks apt-get update \ntorsocks apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nFor a more \"user-friendly\" experience with Tor, download their browser bundle.

Navigate to the extracted directory and run start-tor-browser.sh with a double-click.\nYou can run Flash in the Tor browser: Enable it under Tools > Addons > Plugins.\n\nA: There are some free VPN providers too, like vpnbook. These free services are usually donation based, so if you can, don't forget to donate so they can keep the service free.\n\nA: Just open the add-ons list on firefox and search vpn. you can find plenty of free vpn extensions like Hoxx VPN and Hotsposhield\n\nA: Try the following:\n\n*\n\n*Create an account on hub.docker.com (https://hub.docker.com/signup) and login\n\n*Go to https://labs.play-with-docker.com/ (and log in with same\ncredentials if required)\n\n*Click on the Start button (visible after signup and login)\n\n*A \"Lab Window\" will be opened\n\n*Click on Add new instance  and a \"Console window\" will be opened\n\n*Copy and paste the following in the terminal/console:\n\n\ndocker run --name chrome --privileged -p 3000:3000 -d tekfik/chrome\n\n\n\n*After that, a balloon/button/breadcrumb will be added on the page\nnear the \"OPEN PORT\" button\n\n\n*Click that button and you will be navigated to a new tab that will have a chrome browser opened in it.\nNOTE: The session will be limited to 4 hrs, use this for educational purposes only.\n", "Q: Uninstall GRUB and use Windows bootloader I have Windows 8 pre-installed, and then I installed GRUB with Ubuntu.

No long tutorials.\nOn UEFI all you have to do is:\nPlace Windows boot entry in NVRAM as first.\nHow to do this - several solutions.\nEasiest solution is to use firmware functionality and reorder NVRAM boot entries.\n\nA: This answer is for those with UEFI who have deleted the Ubuntu partitions before removing grub\nYou will be doing this from Windows 10. No bootable media required. \nWhere bootrec /fixmbr, bootsect /nt60 and the Ubuntu live with the boot-repair suggestions have failed, this has worked for me:\n(This answer borrowed verbatim from here)\n\n\n*\n\n*Run a cmd.exe process with administrator privileges\n\n*Run diskpart\n\n*Type: list disk then sel disk X where X is the drive your boot files reside on\n\n*Type list vol to see all partitions (volumes) on the disk (the EFI volume will be formatted in FAT, others will be NTFS)\n\n*Select the EFI volume by typing: sel vol Y where Y is the SYSTEM volume (this is almost always the EFI partition)\n\n*For convenience, assign a drive letter by typing: assign letter=Z: where Z is a free (unused) drive letter\n\n*Type exit to leave disk part\n\n*While still in the cmd prompt, type: Z: and hit enter, where Z was the drive letter you just created.\n\n*Type dir to list directories on this mounted EFI partition\n\n*If you are in the right place, you should see a directory called EFI\n\n*Type cd EFI and then dir to list the child directories inside EFI\n\n*Type rmdir /S ubuntu to delete the ubuntu boot directory\n\n\nAssuming you only ever had two operating systems (Win 10 & Ubuntu) you should now be able to boot directly to Windows without hitting the black grub screen.\n\nA: You can also use a USB memory stick for this job. It takes three applications: Unetbootin, FreeDOS and Testdisk for DOS.\n\n\n*\n\n*First download Unetbootin and use it to make a bootable USB memory stick. Choose Freedos when prompted for a distribution to install on it.\n\n*Download Testdisk for DOS (don't pick the beta, but pick the stable version).\n\n*Unzip the files testdisk.exe and CWSDPMI.exe, and put them on the bootable memory stick (not in a folder, just straight on it).\n\n*Boot your computer from the memory stick. At the Default window, simply press Enter.\n\n*Now FreeDOS is being launched. Choose: FreeDOS Safe Mode (don't load any drivers) and Press Enter.\n\n*Then type: C: and Press Enter.\n\n*Now type: testdisk and Press Enter.\n\n*Select [No Log] and Press Enter.\n\n*Select the hard drive concerned: usually the second option (the first option is the memory stick itself) and Press Enter.\n\n*Select [Intel] and Press Enter\n\n*Select [MBR Code] and press Enter. When prompted, type y (yes) and press Enter again.\n\n\nNow you're done! Reboot your computer normally. Your computer should boot up Windows now.\n\nA: Remove Boot Loader EFI / System Partion in Windows 10\nQuick Guide\nOpen PowerShell as Administrator\nmountvol S: /S\nS:\ncd .\\EFI\\\ndir\nrd /S Ubuntu\n\nDetails\nAdministrator PowerShell\nEnter powershell into the windows search of the start menu.

You can chose any free drive letter you want. For example \"S\".\nmountvol S: /S\n\nAccess Mounted Volume\nNow the partition is mounted. We can access the mounted volume by changing to the drive by the cd command and the drive letter S: as parameter\ncd S:\n\nTo ensure we are at the root of this volume we should execute:\ncd \\\n\nWe can now utilize the dir command to list the directories under the current path to ensure the we are indeed on the UFI partition drive.\ndir\n\nThe output should look similar to this:\nDirectory: S:\\\n\n\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\n----                -------------         ------ ----\nd-----       2019-01-17     12:55                EFI\n-a----       2018-10-16     10:57             31 startup.nsh\n\nDelete Boot Loaders\nYour boot loaders are location in the EFI directory.\nChange to it by using the cd command and list the entries via the dir command.\ncd .\\EFI\\\ndir\n\nYour output depends on the boot loaders you have installed, here is a example with Windows and Ubuntu.\nDirectory: S:\\EFI\n\n\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\n----                -------------         ------ ----\nd-----       2018-12-06     06:55                Ubuntu\nd-----       2018-12-05     05:21                Microsoft\nd-----       2019-01-17     12:55                Boot\n\nNow you can delete unwanted loaders via the command Remove-Item and the parameter -Recurse.\nDO NOT DELETE THE BOOT DIRECTORY OR THE WINDOWS DIRECTORY!\nRemove-Item -Recurse .\\ubuntu\n\n\nA: You can restore the Windows bootloader with a Windows 8/8.1 DVD. These instructions are inspired by Manindra Mehra's answer, but I expanded it with full working details (verified with a Windows 8.1 DVD).\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the DVD in your optical drive and boot from it.\n\n*Press a key when it displays Press any key to start from CD or DVD.\n\n*Select your language etc. and click Next.\n\n*Click Repair your computer.\n\n*Click Troubleshoot.\n\n*Click Advanced Options.\n\n*Click Command Prompt.\n\n*In the command prompt window, type bootrec /fixmbr\n\n*Click the red X to close the command prompt.\n\n*Click Turn off your PC.\n\n*Turn the PC back on and it should boot directly into Windows.\nThis leaves the Ubuntu partition on your hard drive or SSD. To remove it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Windows+X and select Disk Management.\n\n*Find the Ubuntu partition. It will probably be a large partition without a drive letter.\n\n*Be sure you have the correct partition!\n\n*Right-click the partition and delete or reformat it with a Windows filesystem.\n\nA: To do so you will need a windows installation cd/dvd\n\n\n*\n\n*put it in your optical drive and boot from it\n\n*on the installation screen where it asks you to install windows, click on Repair Your Computer on the lower left corner of your screen\n\n*Now go to command prompt (It probably will show a window saying \"Trying to repair windows automatically\", close it) and type BootRec.exe /fixmbr\n\n*after it finishes GRUB is gone and you can now boot into windows directly\n\n*you have an Ubuntu partition left in your computer, that doesn't show in \"My Computer\", to access that, right click on \"My Computer\" and Select \"Manage\" and go to \"Disk Management\"\n\n*Select the Ubuntu partition and format it to a file system that windows can use.\n\n\nA: If All Else Fails!\n\nThe guy above me's method  does not work on newer EFI computers. I solved the problem. Here is how I did it. WARNING, you have to reinstall Linux / grub first!\nSteps: (this is if nothing else works and takes a long time) \n1: Reinstall Ubuntu / Linux mint (this is just so you can use GRUB to boot into Windows). \n1.5: Restart and boot into windows (if you can't boot to Windows, then live boot from the CD or USB and run the following in a console: \nIf you have a windows repair disk you can select the UEFI firmware option and load Windows from there (to avoid reinstalling Linux)\nBoot repair (if needed right now)\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\n1g: Select recommended repair and follow the on screen instructions.\n2g: After your done, reboot. You should see the grub menu,  even though you can boot to Windows from here, this is not what we want yet... But find the option that boots into Windows.\n\n2: Once your booted into Windows, run your disk partition editor and delete All partitions related to Linux / grub. Especially make sure the small grub partition is removed. Reboot\n2.5: Make sure the windows loader is the first selected boot device. (most likely is). Disable the Ubuntu option. Continue boot. \n3: If you've done everything right up to this point you should see (depending on your computer) your splash screen for a second and then it will turn into an error screen saying that there was an error with the boot. (\"Winload.exe is missing or corrupted\" most likly). \n3.5: Don't be alarmed (I was). The next step will restore your original bootloader.    \n4: Restart and boot to your Linux CD or USB. \n5: Once booted, run boot repair commands from above again. This time when running it. It will act differently, there is no grub bootloader detected to reinstall and should run faster than before. \n6: Once complete, restart. \n7: Enjoy your GRUB free system! \nThis worked for me when nothing else did, I ran bootrec.exe. Nothing worked. This saved my computers life. Hope it saves yours! \n\nA: For system with GPT partition table, the method provided by @Ganesh Kondal won't work. Using bootsect /nt60 C: /mbr will show that it worked while it really doesn't. Using bootrec /fixmbr will lead to error that \"the system cannot find the file specified\". If any of the above situation applies, do the following (Using Windows 10 as an example):\n\n\n*\n\n*at log in prompt, hold shift, click on power button, choose restart, let go of shift\n\n*choose troubleshoot -> advanced options -> command line\n\n*at command line, type in bcdboot <drive name>:\\windows\nfor more detailed information, also look at this webpage:https://www.tenforums.com/general-support/74226-bootmgr-error-cant-find-fix.html\n\nA: With UEFI you have both a Windows folder & an Ubuntu folder in the efi partition. the UEFI reads the efi entries and adds them to its own NVRAM to remember them. You have to remove ubuntu folder from efi partition first or UEFI will re-add it. Then you have to remove UEFI entry from UEFI.\nYou should have these folders in the efi partition. Delete only the ubuntu folder. Live installer should show folders. And if only Windows you have to mount from inside Windows the efi partition as it is not normally mounted.\n/EFI/Boot\n/EFI/Microsoft\n/EFI/ubuntu\n\nYou should not have to install Ubuntu but can use live installer DVD or flash drive. Some UEFI systems may let you do the UEFI edit from UEFI menu.\nfrom liveDVD or flash and use efibootmgr\nsudo efibootmgr -v\n\nThe \"-v\" option displays all the entries so you can confirm you're deleting the right one, and then you use the combination of \"-b ####\" (to specify the entry) and \"-B\" (to delete it). Examples #5 is delete:\nsudo efibootmgr -b XXXX -B\n\nSee also\nman efibootmgr\n\n\nA: It may be impossible to do that. The temporary solution is to remove the GRUB menu, and use BCDedit.\nExtract from ubuntuhandbook (https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2020/06/hide-grub-boot-menu-ubuntu-20-04-lts/)\n\nYou can do the job easily via Grub-Customizer (available in Ubuntu Software) under General Settings tab. However, you need to also disable “look for other operating systems” option.\n\n\nAny time you want to show the Grub menu, press ESC while booting up will NO longer show dual-boot (multi-boot) systems other than Ubuntu.\n\n\nA: Not necessary, your bootloader will be clobbered by the windows-only one next time microsuck force-shoves an \"update\" down your throat.\n", "Q: device-mapper: remove ioctl on luks-xxxx failed: Device or resource busy While I was away from my computer, my encrypted USB drive got accidentally unmounted somehow  (although it was still physically connected at the time).

So the question becomes more specific: How can you identify which application is holding the device open?\nBear in mind that lsof doesn't seem to present an easy solution because, once the device is disconnected, the associated names provided by lsof no longer include the name of the disconnected device.\n\nA: After two years of fighting with this, I think I've finally cracked it completely!\ndmsetup ls gives you the data you need:\n$ sudo dmsetup ls\nluks-xxxxx (252:1)\n\nthen\nsudo lsof |grep 252,1   ## notice translation: (252:1) => 252,1\n\nIt seems that sudo may be critical here -- at least in some cases.\n\nThis should give you the information necessary to close all open files on the device -- including names of open files and process IDs for the offending applications.  You may be able to simply go to those apps and close them, but a brute force approach might be something like:\nkill -9 (process ID)\n\nOnce you've closed all the files, some of the command-line tools shown in the question may be necessary in order to close down the existing mount before it can be reopened normally.\n\nA: next time try a lazy umount\numount -l /<folder>\n\nThis works for me most of the times, especially useful with hung-up NFS-drives.\n\nA: Here is how I manage to solve this problem on Linux Mint 17.3 (~Ubuntu Trusty):\n\n\n*\n\n*remove the device from device-mapper\n$ sudo dmsetup remove luks-xxyyzz\n\n\n*map it back\n$ sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sdc1 luks-xxyyzz\nEnter passphrase for /dev/sdc1:\n\nNow the devices is accessible.\n\nA: Try to stop LVM group prior to stop cypher:\nlvchange -a n [LVM_Group_name]\nthen\ncryptsetup -v luksClose [LUKS_name]\nSample:\nlvchange -a n My_vg_crypt\ncryptsetup -v luksClose My_Crypt\n\n\nA: I was in a similar situation but could not solve the problem by removing the luks-xxxx device.

I know that at a minimum two physical NICs are recommended when setting up a Clonezilla Server.\nWill the Ubuntu Server operating system accept a USB NIC?  \n\nA: I can't imagine why you wouldn't be able to. NIC is a NIC. As for it being PCI, technically everything is connected to a PCI location in the linux filesystem. Find out if you require a physical PCI slot which I doubt this is the case. Everything PCI will be listed under lspci which also include usb devices. \nUnfortunately I have used Clonzilla Server myself so I cannot be 100% sure. \n", "Q: Prefer home WiFi over tethering WiFi I have 2 WiFi sources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Home WiFi, unlimited.\n\n*Mobile Broadband WiFi, limited.

In other partitions, I installed the Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty (Alpha version) to try out. I can't boot into the Trusty system any more. I guess it's something related with some grub configuration I modified or some error in booting the root partition (/).\nI want to access some file in the /home, which is a BTRFS partition over luks.

Does someone how could I access this from the precise? I'll need this so much when I began to change from my old Precise to the Trusty install later.\n\nA: BTRFS: couldn't mount because of unsupported optional features\n\nThis means that this btrfs filesystem was created with new, non-backwards-compatible features that the old Precise kernel did not have when it was released. These \"features\" are not visible to the user, they are improvements to the on-disk structure of the filesystem.\nThese features are optional: Trusty can create a btrfs that is readable from Precise (without those features), depending on the parameters that are passed to the mkfs.btrfs program. It seems that the Trusty installer enabled those features, which I think should be reported as a bug against Trusty, since it prevents interoperability.\nThe numeric code of the features is 60, that means: extended inode references and big metadata. As far as I can say, there is no way to disable extended inode references, thus you cannot make this filesystem readable by older kernels anymore.\nTo read the files,\n\n\n*\n\n*open the partition from a Trusty Live DVD (or Saucy? Saucy supports extended inode references, but I don't know about the other feature)\n\n*In theory, another option is to update your kernel in Precise with the Saucy one from the Enablement Stack, but that is equivalent to trying Saucy.\n\n\nTo reinstall Trusty so that its partition will be readable by Precise,\n\n\n*\n\n*either reformat from within Precise (will delete all the contents). Then, when you are at the Trusty installer, choose that partition for / but tell it not to format.\n\n*or choose the ext4 filesystem instead of btrfs, in the installer.\n\n", "Q: Static IP error in Ubuntu 12.04.03 LTS I am getting the following message after changing dhcp to start with the following settings:\nAddress 192.168.1.24\nnetwork mask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.1.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.1\n\n\n*Running /etc/init.d/networking restart is deprecated because it may \n  not enable again some interfaces\n  *Reconfiguring network interfaces...\n\nwhat does deprecated mean?

The device mounts and is recognized by guymager. Image cloning commences for a few seconds with data transferred but then the process halts with the following error:\nDevice disconnected, acquisition paused\nThis happens repeatedly. The physical connection is solid, I believe. Perhaps the device dismounts for some reason.\n\nA: It means, that the device disappears from the list of known devices. This normally is due to hardware problems.\nI saw this problem several times with harddisks. They sometimes \"disconnect\", \"switch off\", \"hang\" or whatever you may want to call it when reading certain bad sectors.\nGuymager has a special feature that might help you to recover from such a problem - with a bit of luck:\n\n*\n\n*Connect the device, preferably via USB or ESATA. Start the acquisition and wait until the device switches to \"disconnected\"\n\n*Unplug the device data and power cables (therefore USB or ESATA)\n\n*Wait a moment, re-plug the device, wait another 5 seconds or so\n\n*Press Rescan in Guymager (or F5). If the device came back to life, the acquisition should continue at the point it paused.\n\nYou may try the procedure with a good device first. That way, you can get a feeling for the whole procedure. Take an USB stick for example. Simply unplug the stick somewhere in the middle of the acquisition and you'll get \"disconnected\"; try the replug procedure then.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Bug caused during installing genymotion emulator I have tried to install genymotion android emulator but I am stuck at a point after downloading the file from geny motion site.\nI tried to install it from terminal by typing\nchmod +x genymotion-2.1.1_x64.bin\n\nit throws an error: \nchmod: cannot access ‘genymotion-2.1.1_x64.bin’: No such file or directory\n\nCan someone please help me?\n\nA: check if your are in the right folder whwhere you have downloaded the genymotion then run the commands\nchmod +x genymotion-2.1.1_x64.bin\n\n", "Q: How do I fix my screen resolution?

However, file managers typically come supplied with sophisticated functionality including network connectivity, directory synchronizing, archive handling, advanced searching, shortcuts, file/folder comparisons, checksums, plugins, and more, making them an incredibly powerful tool.\nDolphin is a file manager focusing on usability. You can browse, locate, open, copy and move files with it.\nIt is the default file manager for the current version of KDE (KDE 4), and can be optionally installed on KDE 3.\nFeatures include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sidebar\n\n*Supports dockable panels for places, information, folders and a\nterminal\n\n*Breadcrumb Navigation bar for URLs which allows users to navigate\nquickly through the file hierarchy\n\n*3 view modes (icon, list and column) with properties remembered for\neach folder\n\n*Split views designed for file copy- and move-operations\n\n*Network transparency\n\n*Undo/redo functionality\n\n*Support of service menus\n\n*Zoom from 16 x 16 pixels to 256 x 256 pixels\n\n*Tooltips show previews\n\n*Thumbnails\n\n*Panel tabs\n\n*Renaming of a variable number of selected items in one step\n\n*Supports: SMB/CIFS, WebDAV, NFS, FTP, and SSH\n\n*Networked Environment for Personalized, Ontology-based Management of\nUnified Knowledge (NEPOMUK) integration\n\n\n\nMore information about.\nsource\nTo install dolphin in Ubuntu:\nOpen a terminal,using Ctrl+Alt+T\nsudo apt-get install dolphin\n\nTo make dolphin default file manager instead of Nautilus\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal using Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Install exo-utils by running the following command in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install exo-utils\n\n\n*Run the following command in the terminal:\nexo-preferred-applications\n\n\n*In the window that opens, click on Utilities\n\n*On the File Manager section, click the drop-down menu arrow + Other...\n\n*Find /usr/share/applications directory\n\n*Adjust to show all files and select dolphin.desktop (wherever you find it)\n\n*Click close\n\nA: In a Nutshell\nDolphin is a file manager, like Windows Explorer. The default file manager on Ubuntu is nautilus from the Gnome desktop. Dolphin is from the KDE desktop. (You'll notice that it uses different icons and colours.)\nMany file managers exist, also ones running in the  terminal like midnight commander.

I have a Dell Inspiron 17R 5721 for a year now and I mostly use ubuntu 12.04.\nI had heating problems sine the beginning while I was using ubuntu but by trial and error I managed to decrease it to logical levels, that is 60C when idle and sometimes even bellow that.\nLately tho, I've had REAL problems with the heat going up to 90C and more if I didn't turn off the apps/games that I used at the time. My fan has a problem and I'm waiting on Dell to fix that BUT... until that happens I'm in windows where the heat is much less in normal conditions, on computer startup is at 40-48C and If I try to do stuff (watch videos, surf on the internet) the heat is at 50-56C. \nSo the question is \"Does Linux Cause More Heat Than Windows In General\"?\nI love Ubuntu but I don't want to sepnd another 1K Euros any time soon. As I said I only have this laptop for a year and I hope that it'll live longer.\n\nA: \nSo the question is \"Does Linux Cause More Heat Than Windows In\n  General\"?\n\nIn short your answer is Yes. Linux in general will generate more heat and give you less battery life as compared to Windows due to the face  open source drivers doesn't do power management well and is by default set to run on full power all the time.\nThe problem is probably in some of your drivers. you have to search for your problem and try other drivers if you find the problem but mostly is your graphics.\nyou can read these discussions here and here.\n", "Q: How to run a command or script at screen lock/unlock?

This printer looks like a clone of Samsung SCX-4521F [www.samsung.com]. Treat this printer like the latter whenever possible.\n\n*Use CUPS for the printer.\n\n*Use the Samsung Unified Linux Driver for the scanner.\n\n\nStep 1: Setup the Repository for Samsung Unified Linux Driver\nNo free or open-source alternatives are available to make full use of this multifunction printer yet. You will see later that we need the Samsung Unified Linux Driver mainly for supporting the scanner.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the following repository:\n\n\ndeb http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/ debian extra\nYou can do this with Synaptic Package Manager, Software Sources, etc.\n2. Install the GPG key, from http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/suldr.gpg, for the repository.

(Check this too: http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_drive ... iver=splix)\n\n*The Samsung unified printer driver. In this case, install the samsungmfp-driver package.\n\n\nEither of the drivers seems to work fine. I personally do not have any particular recommendation yet until further testing. (For the moment I use the Splix driver.)\n\n\n*\n\n*From the start menu, invoke System -> Administration -> Printing.\n\n*Use the driver for 'Samsung SCX-4500 Series'. Choose either the Splix or the Samsung driver according to your preference.\n\n*Check the 'Printer Options' in the 'Printer Properties'. Change the options where appropriate (especially the 'Paper Size').\n\n*Try to print a test page. It should work!\n\n\nStep 3: Install the Scanner Driver\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the samsungmfp-scanner package.\n\n*{SKIP THIS for Ubuntu since 10.04. But tell me if you found that this step is necessary for the scanner to work.} Add users you allow to access the scanner into the lp group. You can use System -> Users and Groups from the start menu to do this, or use the adduser command.\n\n*Reboot the computer. (Restarting some service(s) should do the trick too. But I haven't figured out which one. Tell me if you've found it.)\n\n*Now Graphics -> Simple Scan or xsane should be able to detect and use the scanner!

Is there a way to move all user interaction that occurs during a release upgrade to the end of the upgrade process?\nAs it currently stands, the Ubuntu upgrade process will be interrupted whenever some user interaction is required. In particular, whenever Ubuntu tries to upgrade a package, and finds that I have modified some configuration file that belongs to that package, it will ask me what to do. This behavior is quite annoying. I cannot launch the update and go away, because sooner or later there will be a popup and the upgrade utility won't do anything until I click somewhere. (The questions make sense.1 I do not criticize the questions per se, but the way the upgrade utility goes about asking them.)\nCould Ubuntu not simply perform all the package upgrades, as it is going to anyway, and then, at the very end, display one single pop-up with a list of all those questions, so that I can simply check them off one by one?\nBulk-moving all these questions to the end of the upgrade process would be so much more efficient. It would allow me to launch an upgrade in the evening, come back in the morning, and take care of all those little details in one sweep. Technically it shouldn't be a problem at all. The upgrade utility can easily keep track of which files it is going to ask me about. It could even do it on the run, adding questions to the pop-up as it goes, so that users who like the current behavior can stick with it, but the upgrade process won't get interrupted if a user doesn't answer right away.\nSumming up, is there a way to move all those questions to the end? If not, is there a reason for this behavior? Generally, would bulk-moving all those questions to the end of the installation process be a good idea? Should I make a feature request?\nShould there not be such a feature, and if the question stirs enough interest, I will definitely make a feature request, and we'll see what the devs have to say. :)\n\n1 On the one hand, if I'm running a server with a lot of customized configuration files, I don't want an upgrade to remove them or mess them up. On the other hand, configuration file formats may change, and so with package updates my customized configuration files may need manual massaging.\n\nA: I believe you would be suited by using the non-interactive upgrade features.\nFor stable releases:\ndo-release-upgrade -f DistUpgradeViewNonInteractive\n\nFor development releases:\ndo-release-upgrade -d -f DistUpgradeViewNonInteractive\n\nIt will go through the process without additional questions asked, which sounds like what you are looking for.\nSee this question for additional information: https://askubuntu.com/a/250882/173967\n", "Q: why it is needed to update the linux-images in ubuntu I had recently updated the linux image and kernel files.i found that after doing it,my system resolution becomes like a (without display driver) fonts,icons are big big..so....when entering to that updated generic images..while with the old i found its good and normal...hence why we need to update it the images....\nkindly the info of that is 3.5.0-23-generic(old and good display of my monitor)\nwhile new updates is 3.5.0.45-generic(where everything looks big)\nso i need to know why its happens and why to update this images\n\nA: The main reasons to update your packages, the kernel induced are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security - Updates often patch security holes and the kernel is one of the most important security updates. See http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/\n\n*Bug fixes. Updates also bring bug fixes\n\n*New features. The kernel often brings new features and video drives are written for specific kernels.\nIt is always a good idea to review updates before you apply them.\nIf you need help with your hardware, identify your video card and if you installed any drivers, how did you do so?\n\nA: The versions you mention are versions of the Linux kernel, most likely there is some compability issue or some missing configuration between the newer kernel version and whatever drivers you are running.\nAre you running 12.10? If so, I'd like to point out that 12.10 goes out of support in April 2014 (one month from now). You should run either 12.04 which is a LTS release (Long Term Support) or plan an update to 14.04 which is the next LTS planned for release this April. Quite likely, your display problems will be resolved in this newer version.\nIf you were to mention what GPU you have, it would be easier to find examples of drivers and strategies you could try out.\n", "Q: \"dmask\" and \"fmask\" mount options I tried this command to mount manually : \nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/external -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137\n\nI am not getting what dmask and fmask do here. I know they are used to set up permissions, but when I check permissions of files and folders inside the mounted directory, they are not the same as I set using fmask and dmask. \nSo, what are they actually doing?\n\nA: fmask and dmask are mount options for the FAT filesystem, based on fstab.\nThey are used to define permissions (umask sets them to both files and directories, while fmask only applies to files and dmask to directories).\nThe masks are NOT the permissions of the file, they are used to get the permissions you want. In addition, masks can't add any permissions, they only limit what permissions a file or a directory can have.\n\nThe umask is the default for files and folders, if you want to customize files and folders’s permissions you should use fmask and dmask same use as the umask.\nThe mask permissions are not like the octal permission codes passed to the chmod command, however this table is really helpful understanding how the masks permissions work :\n    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7\nr   +   +   +   +   -   -   -   -\nw   +   +   -   -   +   +   -   -\nx   +   -   +   -   +   -   +   -\n\nIt works as the normal octal permissions but subtracted from 7, and use the absolute value. for instance if you want to set the permissions to 0777 you will need to set it 0000 in the umask (e.g. umask=0000), if you want to set it to 0755 you will set it to 0022 :\n\n\n*\n\n*The first character represents that its an octal permissions\n\n*The second is for the owner\n\n*The third is the group\n\n*The fourth is for other, i.e any other user\n\n\n(Source)\n\nman mount gives this : \n   umask=value\n          Set the umask (the bitmask  of  the  permissions  that  are  not\n          present).  The default is the umask of the current process.  The\n          value is given in octal.\n\n   dmask=value\n          Set the umask applied to directories only.  The default  is  the\n          umask of the current process.  The value is given in octal.\n\n   fmask=value\n          Set the umask applied to regular files only.  The default is the\n          umask of the current process.  The value is given in octal.\n\nYou'll also find examples and technical explaination from Drenriza on Ubuntuforums and of course Wikipedia helps a lot, as usual.\n", "Q: Bad Wifi reception For some reason I got a really bad wifi reception in my bedroom under ubuntu.

From your lshw stuff I assume Ubuntu doesn't exactly know what the device is, so it uses a (more or less) working generic driver.\nSome companies supply Linux drivers (like Realtek does for my card), some don't. So you could try your luck this way.\nAnother possibility would be to disable ACPI power management for your Wifi card. Have a look at this AU question.

But there isn't such file in Apache 2.4.7 \nI read somewhere that the new default file is 000-default.conf.  So I edited that one and tried to add the line:\nAllowOverride All\n\nBut Apache2 did not restart correctly and gave an error. From an apache2 documentation, I found that AllowOverride is only allowed under the <Directory> section. Then I tried adding this:\n<Directory \"/var/www\">\nAllowOverride All\n</Directory>\n\nAnd this seems to work. But I am not sure if I should have put /var/www there. Is it a correct way of doing it or will my computer blow up somehow?\n\nA: tl;dr\nYes it's the correct way.\nBut to be more semantic: Yes, it's the correct way to allow .htaccess to override all directives in the /var/www directory.\n\nAs you found out, AllowOverride is allowed only under the Directory section.\nUsing your example:\n<Directory \"/var/www\">\n    AllowOverride All\n</Directory>\n\nThis is telling apache, that all configurations can be overridden in the /var/www and all its sub-directories (recursively).\n\nFor a better example, consider you have the following configuration in your virtual host:\n<Directory \"/var/www\">\n    AllowOverride All\n</Directory>\n\n<Directory \"/var/www/uploads\">\n    AllowOverride Limit\n</Directory>\n\nAnd the following directory structure:\nvar/\n    www/\n        .htaccess\n        uploads/\n            .htaccess\n            a/\n                .htaccess\n            b/\n                .htaccess\n        code/\n            .htaccess\n            c/\n                .htaccess\n            d/\n                .htaccess\n\nWhat I did here, is create an .htaccess in every sub-directory of the /var/www directory.\nIt usually shouldn't be like so, but this is just for the sake of the example\nComparing the directory structure with the configuration, it means that all .htaccess files inside in the /var/www folder and its sub-directories, excluding the /var/www/uploads directory and its sub-directories, can override all kinds of directives.\nBut /var/www/uploads and its sub-directories can only use the .htaccess file to override the Allow, Deny and Order directives.\nNote: As of apache 2.4 (Which is available by default in 13.10+) the Allow, Deny and Order directives were replaced by a single directive named Require.\n\nA: First enable rewrite using this command:\nsudo a2enmod rewrite\n\nThen restart apache2:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nThen go into the sites-available folder:\n/etc/apache2/sites-available\n\nEdit the file named default and change AllowOverride none to AllowOverride All. There are two lines where this change has to be made.\nThis will make .htaccess work in your server VPS.\nThis worked on an Ubuntu 12.04.5 VPS.\n\nA: In my case, it worked like this:\nI had to add the following lines:\nOrder allow, deny\nAllow from all\n\nSo it looks like this:\n<Directory /var/www/>\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\n    AllowOverride All\n    Order allow,deny\n    allow from all\n</Directory>\n\n\nA: Here a snippet how to enable htaccess in Apache 2.4 without change the default configuration:\ncat <<EOF> /etc/apache2/conf-available/allow-override.conf\n<Directory \"/var/www\">\n    AllowOverride all\n</Directory>\nEOF\n\na2enconf allow-override\nservice apache2 reload\n\n\nA: A common problem i ran into in these tutorials is that there's no default.conf file in\n/etc/apache2/sites-available\n\nI was able to find the place to change it,but it was the apache2.conf file here\n/etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\nNot really sure if this is a good idea, but it did work for me, and in the environment I'm in it's safe.\n\nA: For those running apache 2.4 and not finding \"default\" look in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and edit\nDirectory \n \nAllowOverride All\n\nDirectory \n\n\nDirectory /var/www/>\n\nAllowOverride All \n  \nDirectory\n\n", "Q: Installation of Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS from USB fails because unable to find .udeb file I am trying to install Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS on a server that only has USB boot capability (no cdrom, no pxe).

The solution could be to manually fix the names of the 29 filenames or try the mentioned Rufus tool to build the bootable USB drive with. \nFor reference, opening the ISO file with 7-Zip also shows the filenames cut short. \nJoilet doesn't officially support filenames longer than 64 characters. The shortened name is 65 characters long and could be the reason for this problem. Rockridge does not seem to suffer from the same limit, explaining why this iso image seems fine in linux.\nI guess every make of linux usb boot drivers need to bend the specifiations of Joliet or implement a Rockridge reader to extract the correct filenames.\n", "Q: Install Thunderbird 32 on Ubuntu 64 I would like to install 32 bit version of Thunderbird on Ubuntu 64. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: It should be as simple as using:\nsudo apt-get install thunderbird:i386\n\nSince there's multiarch is possible to do this easily without complications.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server (postfix) mismatch of version apt-get install and apt-get source I tried to apply VDA patch to postfix, but I see that my installed version is 2.9.6 installed via apt-get install.

Can you tell me what the difference is between cat and sudo cat?\nAll I know so far is that cat is used for displaying contents of file and concatenation.\n\nA: Cat is a standard unix utiliy and a most frequently used command which concatenate files and print on the standard output.\nYou may open a terminal (press CTRL+ATL+T) & type man cat to know more about the command and its usage.\nFurther, the difference between cat & using sudo cat;\n\n\n*\n\n*cat - Frequently & the standard command in use to print an output\n\n*sudo cat - Which prints an output with root privilege. This is mostly needed when a file doesn't have read access for certain user/users but not limited to root user.\n\n\nExample;\n-rw------- 2 root root 4096 996 Feb  6 20:39 log.txt\n\nAbove seen is a file which only a root user (or a user who's within root group) can read/write. In such situation you will need to use sudo cat filename to print the output.\nAssume it helped you to understand more.!\n\nA: For a little humour I would say that cat is an animal and sudo cat is a feline with superpowers. :D\nsudo is a command that you use to obtain root privileges. root is a special user that manages the machine, and for this he/she has superpowers. For example, if there is a file that only root can see its contents, and you are logged in as a normal user, you can use \n$ sudo cat name_of_the_file\n\nto read it. Also if there is a program that only root can run, like the reboot command:\n$ reboot\nwarning: must be root!\n$ sudo reboot\nrebooting...........\n\nTHE CATCH IS: you must be specially (and manually) assigned by root to have permission to use sudo. The permission is given in a file called /etc/sudoers. In Ubuntu, the first user, the one created during install, is automatically a sudoer. But the subsequent users are not. You have to add them manually to the group sudo whose members are allowed to use the command sudo.\nBy the way, /etc/sudoers is a file that only root can see. So if you do\n$ cat /etc/sudoers\n\nyou will not be able to see its contents. But if you do:\n$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers\n\nyou are good.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: cat is used to read a file; sudo is used for super user privileges. So sudo cat means read the file with super user (that is, root) privileges.\n", "Q: What is the hardware address of my Webcam Mic?

No!!! I want to download chrome dev to get dev version of libpepperflash or whatever it is called now and add it to chromium.\nAlso DO pre \"stable\" channels add repository auto?*\nIf not what is the repository?\n\nA: Warning\nYou want to install an edge plug-in.  This answer is technically correct, but it will, in all probability, break packages that auto-install the pepper plug-in in chromium.  So, use at the cost of putting your system in an inconsistent state.\nOf course I assume you installed chromuim from dev channel\nto install libpepperflash on chromium, open your terminal and write the following:\nchromium-browser --ppapi-flash-path=/opt/google/chrome*/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so --ppapi-flash-version=11.3.31.323\n\nTo always have the correct Flash Player version in Chromium:\nopen your profile\nvi  ~/.profile\n\nadd this to the end:\nexport PEPPER_FLASH_VERSION=$(grep '\"version\":' /opt/google/chrome*/PepperFlash/manifest.json| grep -Po '(?<=version\": \")(?:\\d|\\.)*')\n\nNow open chromium settings:\nsudo vi /etc/chromium-browser/default\n\nAnd replace CHROMIUM_FLAGS=\"\" with the following:\nCHROMIUM_FLAGS=\"--ppapi-flash-path=/opt/google/chrome*/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so --ppapi-flash-version=$PEPPER_FLASH_VERSION\"\n\n\nA: Pepper Flash is available through a PPA for Precise, Quantal, Saucy, and Trusty (although Trusty will have this package in the default repos).\nSee https://launchpad.net/~skunk/+archive/pepper-flash for installation instructions.\nShort version of the instructions:\nThe following adds the PPA and installs the Pepper Flash Player:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:skunk/pepper-flash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pepflashplugin-installer\n\nNow, you need to tell Chromium to use this version of the Flash Player. To do that, open up /etc/chromium-browser/default (something like sudo nano /etc/chromium-browser/default or sudo gedit /etc/chromium-browser/default), and on a new line at the end of the file, add the following line:\n /usr/lib/pepflashplugin-installer/pepflashplayer.sh\n\nSave and close the file, and run Chromium as normal.

I've been searching for one specific feature that was missing for Ubuntu...\nIn Windows I used to connect my headphone and speakers to two jacks, one is a normal analogue audio output jack and the other was a line-in jack. I was able to make it output analogue audio via a software called \"Realtek HD Audio Manager\" but this software doesn't have a Linux version. It's so bad that I have to get up every time I need to switch between my devices since I'm limited to one jack.\nBottom line, the question is; how do I output analogue audio from my \"line-in\" jack? I need an alternative software to that mentioned above.\n\nA: And I happened to stumble upon the solution here!\nA respectful developer named David Henningsson created an awesome tiny software that does the job!!! Even though it's still in the experimental phase up to the point but I installed it and it worked!!!! FINALLY!!!!!!!!\n\n...Now here's how to use it. It should be pre-installed but if not then follow this and install it. ...To cut short the installation command is\nsudo apt-get install alsa-tools-gui\n\nThen just search for HDAJackRetask. You'd find it in your dash or if you use LXDE you'd find it under the \"others\" title in the menu and that's all!! :)\np.s: \"Apply now\" didn't work.

Guests are all x86 or amd64, host is a 2-socket Westmere Xeon box.\nNow I want to create a new guest VM but this time the guest VM should run an armhf image (a Raspberry Pi image).\nWhat I was expecting would work: open Virt-Manager, go through the usual setup steps to create a new VM and then choose QEMU and armhf as the architecture of the guest.\nWhy it did not work: I can only see x86 and amd64 as options for the architecture of the guest.\nIs there anyway I can install QEMU support for armhf so that I can easily create armhf KVM guests on my server using virt-manager?\n\nI want to make as little changes as possible on the host.

However, I have some problems with the way Ubuntu moves windows around when turning off a monitor. \nFor instance, when I want to watch a movie I only want to use one monitor. However, when I turn off the other screens, the windows located on these will all move to the one monitor I use for a movie. \nIf I turn on the screens again the windows move back but not always to the same place and it's still kind of a hassle to suddenly have a huge bunch of windows pile up on the monitor you were just starting a movie on. It also means that my screens will blank out for 3 seconds, every time I turn one of the monitors on or off - probably to adjust X/compiz, I  guess?\nI know this is probably intended behavior, since it would make a lot of sense with a laptop setup. But with a triple monitor desktop setup, I really just want my windows to stay where they are, screens off or not. If I need whatever was on them, I'll just turn them on. Just some way to blank them would be nice, too.\nIs there any way to turn off this feature? For the record, I'm running the NVIDIA proprietary driver.\n\nA: This is the most common with HDMI and display port but some DVI and VGA monitors can do it too I'm told.  DVI is hit and miss and I've never personally encountered a VGA one that does this.  \nWhen you power off the monitor it ceases to be communicating with the computer.  On HDMI at least the easiest workaround I found was to cover pin 19 with a piece of tape there is a similar pin(unsure off the number) for displayport although for mini displayport it gets a bit small to get the tape in without blocking other pins.  \nIf you have the problem with DVI or VGA connections there are pins you can break off on the cable (again not sure which offhand).  I discovered this on Windows admittedly so I may be wrong but the linux machine connects by VGA to a KVM so haven't had a problem with it\n", "Q: Can't upgrade from Ubuntu 13.04 to 13.10 I do sudo do-release-upgrade, and I got an error message like this one.\n\nAn unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade.\nThis can be caused by:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Upgrading to a pre-release version of Ubuntu\n  \n*Running the current pre-release version of Ubuntu\n  \n*Unofficial software packages not provided by Ubuntu\n  \n\nHow I can solve this?\n\nA: Most times it's because of the last point listed: You've got some PPA's enabled which can't be upgraded.\nDisable all PPA's you've installed manually and run the upgrade.

What you want is closer to:\nfind . -name '*.php' -exec grep -lP '\\w{50,}' {} \\;\n\nThe -l means \"print the name of the matching file\" and -P activates perl compatible regular expressions so we can use the \\w which is shorthand for matching word characters (basically [a-zA-Z0-9-_] but the details depend on your locale. Using [^ ] is a good idea but will count \\t and \\r and even \\n, as well as stranger things like ~@#$%^&*() as words and I am assuming that's not what you want.\nIf you want to match any non-space character, use this instead:\nfind . -name '*.php' -exec grep -lP '\\S{50,}' {} \\;\n\n", "Q: Why is Juju failing to deploy my sharded MongoDB cluster?

Also if you download your iso from http://releases.ubuntu.com/13.10/ or http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ it lists the file sizes beside the names, in the directory browser at the page bottom.\n13.10:\nUbuntu 13.10 - Desktop X86-64 = 883 MB\nUbuntu 13.10 - Desktop X86-32 = 895 MB\nUbuntu 13.10 - Server X86-64 = 672 MB\nUbuntu 13.10 - Server X86-32 = 658 MB\nLubuntu 13.10 - Desktop X86-64 = 702 MB\n12.04:\nUbuntu 12.04 - Desktop X86-64 = 698 MB\nUbuntu 12.04 - Desktop X86-32 = 701 MB\nUbuntu 12.04.3 - Server X86-64 = 665 MB\nUbuntu 12.04.3 - Server X86-32 = 648 MB\nLubuntu 12.04 - Desktop X86-64 = 697 MB\nKubuntu 12.04.3 - Desktop X86-64 = 707 MB\nXubuntu 12.04.3 - Desktop X86-64 = 712 MB\n14.04:\nUbuntu 14.04 - Desktop DAILYBUILD-JAN-21-2014 X86-64 = 912 MB\n\nA: According to my Downloads directory, the download size for the 64-bit 13.10 desktop ISO is 904,192 KB (883 MB).\n\nA: It depends on which image and which release you are downloading. Everything prior to 13.10 hovers around 700MB so it can fit on a standard CD. 13.10 is a bit larger around 900MB. I believe Canonical aims to keep the LTS releases under 700MB.\n\nA: It says on the download page! Almost every browser including yourse shows how big is the file you are downloading!\n\nA: 32bit: 0.713867 GB\n64bit: 0.71582 GB\nInformation from ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS\n\nA: All the releases of Ubuntu along with its official derivatives are linked at http://releases.ubuntu.com/. Navigate to the particular release you want to download.\nSuppose you want to download the images for Precise (12.04), you would go to http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/. This page contains all the latest images available for download for 12.04 in a table showing the names, last modified date, size and description for each image. \"Size\" is the column which answers your question.\nWhich image am I supposed to download?\n* in the following list represents the release of Ubuntu (eg; 12.04.4 for the latest point release of Precise)\n\n*\n\n*For Desktop 32-bit: ubuntu-*-desktop-i386.iso\n\n*For Desktop 64-bit: ubuntu-*-desktop-amd64.iso\n\n*For Server 32-bit: ubuntu-*-server-i386.iso\n\n*For Server 64-bit: ubuntu-*-server-amd64.iso\n\nWe can see that Desktop 64-bit and 32-bit are about 733 MB and 731 MB respectively and Server 64-bit and 32-bit are 679 MB and 661 MB respectively. (Here 1 MB = 1024 KB, so if your ISP calculates data as 1 MB = 1000 KB, do the maths as necessary).\n\nTip: If you want to save as much data as you can while downloading and already have an image of Ubuntu previously downloaded, you might want to use zsync to update the iso.\n\nA: All of the Ubuntu desktop downloads are under a gigabyte. If you want to know the megabytes that each edition of a desktop installation of Ubuntu is, here you go:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 13.10 - 895 MB\n\n*Ubuntu 13.10 64 bit - 883 MB \n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 - 731 MB\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit - 733 MB\n", "Q: Is there a way to install 13.10 on btrfs and full disk encryption? I like the fact that the default desktop Ubuntu installer only requires me to check a single checkbox in order to have a fully encrypted disk in the end \n(which is a requirement within our company, so there is no way around that).\nOn the other hand, I would like to give btrfs a try ... seems like performance and stability are \"OK\" by now; and snapshots for backup seem to work great. \nBut ... there is no way to achieve that with the Ubuntu installer - its \"full disk encryption on ext4\" ... or \"do something else\", and then all the work is on my shoulders.\nSo, are there any \"easy\" options to install a 64 bit 13.10 on btrfs with fde?\n\nA: I did some further investigation, and it seems: there is no easy answer.\nThe thing that is actually pretty easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a fresh install of Ubuntu, including the automatic full disk encryption using LUKS and volume management\n\n*Right after installation, boot the computer using some external USB/DVD linux\n\n*From that \"USB Linux\", use luksOpen and the device mapper to mount the (ext4) partitions\n\n*Then use the btrfs tooling to change the partition to btrfs\n\n*Update /etc/fstab (for the root partition you just changed) to reflect root is now btrfs, and no longer ext4\n\n\nI tried that with a 14.04 installation, and it worked without any problem.\nBUT: just doing that doesn't make too much sense - in my eyes btrfs is only useful if more of its built-in features are used; for example using btrfs subvolumes instead of lvm groups; and btrfs raid1 for \"immediate\" backup support. Just using it like ext4 doesn't bring benefits; just performance impacts.\n", "Q: How to make xrdp display preexisting open programs I use xrdp to remotely connect from my Windows 7 laptop to my Ubuntu 13.10 server, which works perfectly... until I disconnect. Then, the next time I connect, all my programs are gone, presumably because it's starting a new session. I looked around for ways to fix this, and none of them work. They all give me an \"Unable to connect\" error in the dialog box after entering my password when xrdp starts. I forwarded port 5900 in my router, and then set xrdp.ini to connect with 127.0.0.1 and port 5900. I also configured vino to allow other users to view, and then control my desktop.\nWhat is set wrong? I followed several different tutorials and they all gave the same result. If I can't do this, is there some other software I can use that connects via Windows Remote Desktop Connection (i.e. no installing programs, for when I'm on a machine w/o admin access)? I'm getting tired of leaving the connection open, and my computer out of sleep mode, if I want to be able to access my Minecraft server's console...\nAlso, will this work even if the Windows 7 computer is in sleep mode? And is there a setting that lets me close the session on one computer with programs running, and then connect from a different computer and still have access to the same programs?\n\nA: I had a similar issue..\nto get it working for me I edited my xrdp.ini\nby runing \nsudo gedit /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini\nthen added the below to the list for my set up:\n[xrdp8] \nname=Reconnect \nlib=libvnc.so \nusername=ask\npassword=ask\nip=127.0.0.1 \nport=5910\n\nI assume yours would be the same but with port=5900\nI first log in to my machine usung the default sesman-Xvnc connection option in the 'Login to xrdp' 'Module' drop-down list..\nThis creates the original session that i can then log back into later by selecting the Reconnect option i have created which should now show in the 'Login to xrdp' 'Module' drop-down.\nAll my open programs, windows and files are just as i left them in the first session when i log back in using this..\nI can access this same session again from any of my other Windows PC's Remote Desktop Connection clients by again selecting Reconnect in the Xrdp login 'Module' drop-down.\n\nA: since UBuntu 14.10, a new package for xrdp has been released.  xrdp-6-1.xxxx includes the capability of reconnecting to existing sessions \nYou can check this post and go to the section \"Reconnect to the same section\" to have more information\nTill next time \nSee ya \n", "Q: Copy system to another computer Remastersys apparently let you do this? It's gone now.\nI have a development machine, and I'd like to basically clone it, and install it on a laptop, so I don't have to reinstall everything. Is that possible?\nI have a bootable usb, that I made persistent, but I only used it to install ubuntu originally. Can I use that to accomplish this?\n\nA: It is quite easy to clone a partition with gparted. Boot from your bootable usb, plug in a second usb drive which is bigger than your partition that you are cloning. Start gparted and simply Copy the original and Paste to Unallocated Space on the second usb drive.\nWarning: the cloned drive will have the same UUID number as the original partition, so do not boot into Ubuntu on the hard drive with the second usb plugged in. Ubuntu will get confused as to which partition is /\n\nA: Use either relinux or SystemImager\nRelinux is a good software to use instead of Remastersys. Here is a great tutorial how to use.\nDownload the latest version from launchpad\nSystem Imager is a fork of Remastersys.\nFrom System Imager's website:\n\nSystem Imager is a tool that images your running system and allows you to make a image of your running machine and install it on another. System Imager is based on the work of Remastersys.\n\nIt has been released under the GNU GPLv2 and the source code is available from the developers in Sourceforge.net\n", "Q: How to create alias with g++?

I've not been able to find this answer anywhere else. Are you able to install Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Windows 8.1 on unallocated space? I did this with Windows 7, but I had to cover all of those partitions and make one primary for the Windows 8.1 installation. Thanks for an answer, if anyone replies. \n\nA: Yes, if you have some unallocated space on your hard drive, the Ubuntu installer will be able to use that for Ubuntu. Alongside Windows 8.1 on another partition.\nThe only thing that you should be aware of is that you can only create a maximum of 4 primary partitions on a hard drive. That is, if you already have 4 primary partitions, then you cannot use that unallocated space for Ubuntu, as Ubuntu will need to create at least one partition for itself.\n(Note: Typically Ubuntu uses more than one partition, at least one for the root system and one for swap space; often for /home, sometimes for /boot, sometimes for other folders. But as long as you can allocate at least one primary partition on your hard drive, you could configure the Ubuntu installer to make it a logical partition that could again be split into four extended partitions.)\n", "Q: tar a folder minus one sub-folder I'm trying to create a tar archive of a folder thisfolder but want to omit a sub-folder named notthisfolder.

For specifying a relative path (to the current working directory), use thisfolder/ without the leading slash /.\n\n*As a little tidbit, you don't need to prefix the cvfzp options with a -.

If you're on a LAN, you shouldn't need the firewall, so you can read this wiki page for directions on how to disable it.\nOnce the firewall is disabled, you can then play to your heart's content.\n\nA: It probably is your router configuration. This happened with me a long time ago in Windows. Search in your router's manual about \"How to open ports\". Or search the internet. Just remember that the process can change depending on your model.

precise, quantal and raring. I'm not even sure what your system is anymore, which you should check using lsb_release -sc or use quantal as the header of the sources.list file suggest. You should remove/comment all the repositories that are not your version of Ubuntu, update your package list (sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update) and pray that sudo apt-get -f install doesn't throw more errors. Ah, you should also remove the linux-image-extra-3.8.0-35-generic package.\n", "Q: How to monitor who is pinging me? Is there a way to know who is pinging my PC on my network? Is it possible to monitor all ICMP packets? How can I do that?\n\nA: Good workout @nux I liked it .\nI also would like to add my trick I use to find who's pinging me by using avahi tool (can be installed from Synaptic).\nWhen I run in terminal avahi-browse -rat , it automatically compiles full list of connections for example:\nhostname = [xxx-xxx.local]\naddress = [xxx::x:xxx:xxx:xxx:xxx] physical\naddress = [xx.xx.xxx.xx] ipv4 or ipv6\nport = [xxx]\ntxt = [xxx]\n\nFor example , I can always see when my Internet provider is pinging me during my session, when I run this command .\nTo see everything avahi can do , Run :\navahi-browse --help \n\n\nA: Yes, that is possible using tcpdump, which is a most powerful and widely used command-line packet sniffer (package analyzer) tool available on Linux.\nIn the terminal application of the computer you want to monitor :\nsudo tcpdump -i ethX icmp and icmp[icmptype]=icmp-echo\n\nOptions:\n-n avoid a (potentially slow) reverse DNS query\n−i interface\nicmp[icmptype]=icmp-echo    To print all ICMP packets that are echo requests/replies\n\nThe it will start listening on ethX and waiting for arrived packets.\nExample : I have 2 pc win7 10.1.1.8 , Ubuntu 10.1.1.57 which will monitor packets arrived :\n\nOn ubuntu :\n\nReference : nixCraft\n\nA: This package must simply be installed (if you don't have it):\nsudo apt-get install iptables-persistent\n\nThen add this command to the /etc/iptables/rules.v4 file:\n-A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j LOG --log-prefix \"LOG_IPTABLES_PING_REQUEST: \"\n\nTo check who pings you  , just check the log file:\ngrep 'LOG_IPTABLES_PING_REQUEST: ' /var/log/messages\n\nYou can also use a monitoring applications such as Wireshark.\n", "Q: ubuntu server and samba I am trying to set up a Ubuntu server 12.04 nas using samba file sharing. I first tried to set it up with webmin and when that didn't work, I tried to set it up manually using the vi editor modifing the /etc/samba/smb.conf. Both times the results were the same. \nOver the network all users can open the share (empty) but cannot write to the share (permission denied). This is the same for both Linux and windows machines. \nMy smb.conf in part looks like:\n[John]\n  writable = yes\n  invalid users = kid1 kid2 kid3\n  path = /SharedMedia/John\n  comment = John\n  valid users = john wife\n  browsable = yes\n  create mode = 777\n  directory mode = 777\n\n[Public]\n  writable = yes\n  path = /SharedMedia/Public\n  comment = Public\n  valid users = john wife kid1 kid2 kid3 virtualbox \n  browsable = yes\n  create mode = 777\n  directory mode = 777\n\n(users on the system include: john, wife, kid1 kid2 kid3 and virtualbox for virtual machine - names hidden for privacy)\nAll users exist as linux users and samba users and have the same password for both.\nnote: I never did set up samba groups as it did not appear to apply to my use. For example: all users have have their own share on the server but other users should not be allowed to access it. Therefore I did not set up groups because there were few shares that all users access.\nI honestly cannot figure out what is holding me back. Thanks for your help.\n\nA: This may be due to the permissions/owner on the shared folder(s) themselves.\nTry to log into the server as one of the users and write to the same directory.\nAre the client machines asking for a password when you connect? If not, this could indicate that you are being connected as 'guest'.\nThis guide might help\n", "Q: how to stop xubuntu from opening programs when powered on Whenever I shut down xubuntu, if I happen to have any programs open, they start back up when I start up xubuntu. How do I stop it from doing this? The reason I want to stop it instead of just closing all my programs before shutting down is because I have an apache server running in the background, which is stopping lampp from functioning, and the only way I know how to stop it without lampp is to shut down the computer. But then xubuntu starts it right back up when my computer starts up.\n\nA: You need to disable the xubuntu option to save the session state. There are two possible places for this setting:\n\n\n*\n\n*At the bottom of the logout dialogue box there is a checkbox about saving the session state.\n\n*At Applications-> Settings -> Xfce 4 Settings Manager -> Session and Startup\n\n\nAlso try removing all files in ~/.cache/sessions/\nIf this still fails, try modifying the kioskrc to add option \"[xfce4-session] SaveSession=NONE\" see: How can I turn off Xfce session saving system-wide?\nHowever, if your actual problem is how to shutdown Apache, then also see this official page on how to stop Apache\n", "Q: Configure network interface for direct connection I need to connect two Ubuntu machines directly via ethernet (i.e., no switch or router between them).\nOne of them is running Ubuntu Desktop, so I am happy to use the network manager for that.  The other one is using Ubuntu Core, so the configuration will need to be done in /etc/network/interfaces.\nWhat is the appropriate configuration on each side?\n\nA: The solution is to configure both sides as a static connection.\nOn the headless side in /etc/network/interfaces put:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.100\n    gateway 192.168.1.254\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n\nOn the Ubuntu desktop side, configure a static connection in the network-manager, but with a different address (in the same network range).\n\nA: To connect two ethernet LAN card interfaces together, at least one of them must support Auto-MDIX, or you will need a cross-over ethernet cable. This is a special cable which connects the \"TRANSMIT\" lines of one LAN card interface to the \"RECEIVE\" lines of the other and vice versa. However if at least one of the two cards supports Auto-MDIX, then the cross-over function will be taken care of automatically.\nIf you care about the exact hardware, here is what wikipedia says about ethernet crossover cables\nIf the cable (or the Auto-MDIX) is not the problem then configure static addresses and appropriate netmasks and try to ping each other's ip addresses to confirm the link works. As there is (probably) no DNS service running you will need to refer to each computer by its ip address.\n", "Q: Is there ways to download youtube video?

I have downloaded Subliminal which is a program that downloads movie subtitles.But there are several problems: (1) when I test it at the console with a\nmovie that I know has an English subtitle, I get an unsatisfactory response:\nalan@alan-Latitude-D530:~$ subliminal -l en la fin du jour.avi\nusage: subliminal -l LANGUAGE [LANGUAGE ...] [-s] [-c CACHE_FILE]\n                  [-p PROVIDER [PROVIDER ...]] [-m MIN_SCORE] [-a AGE] [-h]\n                  [-f] [--addic7ed-username USERNAME]\n                  [--addic7ed-password PASSWORD] [-q | -v]\n                  [--log-file LOG_FILE] [--color] [--debug] [--version]\n                  [--help]\n                  PATH [PATH ...]\nsubliminal: error: too few arguments\n\n(2) I loaded a bash script into Nautilus so that I could download subtitles by a right-click on a movie file instead of having to go to a console.

But got a Nvidia driver which it was already been installed. So, how to make Nvidia driver as a default graphics driver?\n\nA: If you want to keep your Nvidia optimus technology to save battery life, you could use Bumblebee from apt-get as Danatela said.

Give it a couple seconds to change. There is also an option in drop down next to colored icon size scale to panel size optimally or scale to panel size exactly. That seems to make all icons in systray the same size.\n\nA: The Cinnamon panel \"tray icons\" are not all of the same type. The ones that look bigger are on the same applet.

I am not a Windows fan. I don't like Windows. But, for my curiosity, I temporally installed Windows 8 on my machine (a Samsung NP300, Intel Core i3, 4GB Memory).\nI observed that it's a lot faster than Ubuntu: boot time, application start and so on.\nWhy is this happening? Is there any solution to make Ubuntu faster?\n\nA: Windows 8 usually don't turn off the PC. It does some kind of hibernate shutdown.\nAnd the about app starting, I'm also amazed about the launching speed of Windows 8. I think they load your popular apps in background. \n\nA: There are a multitude of possible reasons, but in my experience Windows 8 tends boot a little faster, and load programs a little faster.\nBoot time: By default pre-installed versions of Windows 8 on laptops have fast-boot enabled. This means your Laptop never shuts off even if you click shutdown your laptop is still on, and drawing precious battery life. It's just using a special low low power hibernation. The idea is to make Windows appear to boot more quickly, when it actually never turned off. Windows 8 actually boots quite slow. Compare it to XP's boot times and see what I mean. That said Ubuntu has never been a quick to boot operating system especially now that it has Unity. The server edition is pretty good, but that's because it has no gui.\nApplication start time: It's kind of unfair to compare different programs. The startup time of a program depends on it's memory demands. Before data can be loaded into the memory it must be copied from the drive so size comes into play, and both operating systems use different filesystems. \nThings to keep in mind: \n-Make sure you've given enough swap to Ubuntu, it should be around the same amount of ram you have. If possible provide swap on a different drive.\n-Keep in mind that with fast-boot enabled in Windows there is less ram available for Ubuntu's kernel, and it can cause issues with Ubuntu. For example on my PC fast-boot prevented my root user from being able to mount and unmount partitions.\n", "Q: Need Google Input Tools to type Telugu in Celtx I need Google Input Tools for writing scripts in Telugu language in Celtx in Ubuntu 13.10.

I realize this thread might be deemed as a duplicate of this but I don't care about back-up or Lubuntu, nor can I disable UEFI because I can't get into BIOS no matter how hard I try.\nI found out about this option in Windows 8, which for some reason has something to do with recovery: \"Change advanced start-up settings\"/\"Advanced startup\". Seems like at this point I do not have to deal with BIOS, UEFI, and Secure Boot, nor do I want to; this installation process is already complicated enough. (I'm writing this because I don't know if this is relevant to the problem I'm about to address.) I boot from the DVD with Ubuntu .iso image properly burnt on it. At the start-up I saw a suspicious line:\nCould not open \"\\EFI\\BOOT\\fallback.efi\": 14\n\nThen it moves on to the boot partitions menu without Windows 8 on it. Now I'm booting into the trial mode of Ubuntu. Even during the installation process it does not recognize Windows 8:\n\nOn this blog the author says that she \"had to manually partition the hard drive, because the Ubuntu installer didn't recognize that Windows 8 was already on the computer.\" I don't know if this is safe for an amateur like myself to carry it out, considering that partitioning cannot be undone and I don't know how to do it right:\n\nProblem/question: How do I get it to recognize Windows 8 so that I can partition the memory correctly?\nHope I didn't put up too many findings. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: I also have Toshiba. It's annoying that they lock almost all the things in there BIOS. But you can just create a partition with your windows OS. Later come back to ubuntu installation and use this partition for installing ubuntu (Don't forget to partition this partition into two. 2GB for swap (u can assign more if you want)and rest as ext4 or ext3 whatever you like).

I read somewhere that you can use the .config file.

You can find a very interesting article about this here\nWith .config you could totally disable usbstorage module but this would then make any usb storage not work anymore.\n\nA: Simply blacklist the kernel driver:\nsudo echo \"blacklist usb-storage\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nAfter that, nobody can use a USB memory stick in that computer, but still allows the administrator(s) to manually load the module and use it.\nTo enable again simply remove the line from the blacklist file.\n", "Q: Why I can't get the TTY's?

Then enter your login and password and run\nsudo stop gdm\n\nThis will enable the CLI.\nThe second way is holding Shift during the boot and choosing Recovery Mode. Then you should select Drop to root shell with networking.\n\nA: When you boot you have to wait until the GDM has already loaded to press Ctrl + Alt + F1 to switch to a TTY.

One of those added functions by evnsetup.sh is mka, is it possible to call this from within the time command?\nEdit 3: Output of type mka\n$ type mka\nmka is a function\nmka () \n{ \n    case `uname -s` in \n        Darwin)\n            make -j `sysctl hw.ncpu|cut -d\" \" -f2` \"$@\"\n        ;;\n        *)\n            schedtool -B -n 1 -e ionice -n 1 make -j$(cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep \"^processor\" | wc -l) \"$@\"\n        ;;\n    esac\n}\n\n\nA: The problem is that mka is a bash function exported by your script and not an executable (as opposed to make), so /usr/bin/time doesn't find it, as it looks for an executable.\nThere are two possible solutions.\nFirst, note that there is a difference between the bash built-in function time, and the executable /usr/bin/time. These are different commands, which take different parameters and generate different output:\n$ time sleep 1\n\nreal    0m1.001s\nuser    0m0.000s\nsys     0m0.001s\n\n$ /usr/bin/time sleep 1\n0.00user 0.00system 0:01.00elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 664maxresident)k\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+215minor)pagefaults 0swaps\n\nType help time to get help for the bash built-in time. Type man time to get help for the executable /usr/bin/time.\nThe first solution uses time, whereas the second solution uses /usr/bin/time.\nFirst solution: using the bash built-in function time\nThe bash built-in function time is aware of declared bash functions, and you can immediately use it to measure the time of such functions.\n$ foo() {\n    sleep 1;\n    echo \"Hello World\"\n  }\n$ time foo\nHello World\n\nreal    0m1.002s\nuser    0m0.000s\nsys     0m0.001s\n\nIn your case, the following command should work:\n$ time mka -j8 bacon\n\nThis would be my preferred way. However, it may not generate exactly the output you want. In particular, it does not measure or print CPU usage.\nSecond solution: using the executable /usr/bin/time\nYou cannot directly measure the time of a built-in bash function using /usr/bin/time (as far as I know), but what you can do is measure the time of the /bin/bash executable executing that bash function. This is a little hacky, and it generates a little overhead as you are launching an extra instance of bash. But this overhead may be negligible when faced with a function that takes minutes to compute, so it may still suit your needs better.\nTo be able to launch the /bin/bash executable on a bash function, we have to export the function first.\n$ foo() {\n    sleep 1;\n    echo \"Hello World\"\n  }\n$ export -f foo\n$ echo foo | /usr/bin/time /bin/bash\nHello World\n0.00user 0.00system 0:01.00elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 1476maxresident)k\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+707minor)pagefaults 0swaps\n\nHence, in your case, to be able to use /usr/bin/time and generate the output format you want, you could proceed as follows:\n$ export -f mka\n$ echo 'mka -j8 bacon' | /usr/bin/time -f \"User\\t%U\\nSys\\t%S\\nReal\\t%E\\nCPU\\t%P\" /bin/bash\n\n", "Q: How to pass arguments to functions while executing a python script from terminal?

How do I pass the arguments to the function call?\n\nA: You can also use the sys module. Here is an example :\nimport sys\n\nfirst_arg = sys.argv[1]\nsecond_arg = sys.argv[2]\n\ndef greetings(word1=first_arg, word2=second_arg):\n    print(\"{} {}\".format(word1, word2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    greetings()\n    greetings(\"Bonjour\", \"monde\")\n\nIt has the behavior your are looking for :\n$ python parse_args.py Hello world\nHello world\nBonjour monde\n\n\nA: Python provides more than one way to parse arguments. The best choice is using the argparse module, which has many features you can use.\nSo you have to parse arguments in your code and try to catch and fetch the arguments inside your code.\nYou can't just pass arguments through terminal without parsing them from your code.\n", "Q: How to install eiffel on ubuntu 13.10?

It seems like there is a package called geoclue which uses Mozilla's location service to lookup wireless access points and their known location, but there doesn't seem to be a command line interface for this. Is there another way to do it? Any clever hacks?\n\nA: If you want IP based lookup... (but you'll have to fix the HTML formatting of the output)\nwget http://cqcounter.com/whois/my_ip_address.php && egrep \"IP Location|City|Latitude|Longitude\" my_ip_address.php\n\n\nA: Here's my own best answer, which tries out all of the different geoclue providers available in Ubuntu:\napt-get install geoclue geoclue-ubuntu-geoip python-geoclue geoclue-yahoo geoclue-plazes geoclue-localnet geoclue-gypsy\n\necho \"#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport Geoclue\n\nproviders = 'Gypsy, Hostip, Localnet, Plazes, Skyhook, Yahoo, Ubuntu GeoIP'\nproviders = providers.split(', ')\nfor provider in providers:\n\n  POS_PROVIDER = provider\n\n  location = Geoclue.DiscoverLocation()\n  location.init()\n  location.set_position_provider(POS_PROVIDER)\n  position = location.get_location_info()\n\n  print provider\n  print position['latitude']\n  print position['longitude']\n\" > location.py\n\npython location.py\n\nThis results in:\nGypsy\n0.0\n0.0\nHostip\n39.8121\n-76.9837\nLocalnet\n39.8121\n-76.9837\norg.freedesktop.DBus.GLib.UnmappedError.GeoclueErrorQuark.Code1: Could not understand reply from server\nPlazes\n39.8121\n-76.9837\norg.freedesktop.DBus.GLib.UnmappedError.GeoclueErrorQuark.Code1: Couldn't parse response from web service\nSkyhook\n39.8121\n-76.9837\nYahoo\n39.8121\n-76.9837\nUbuntu GeoIP\n40.6501\n-73.9496\n\nWhich is a big step forward, but it seems that all of the providers are using IP based lookup, and my VPN totally throws that off. Seems like there should be a provider that only uses wifi access points, but I haven't found it yet.\n\nA: To get your location by IP you can use:\ncurl -s http://whatismycountry.com/ | sed -n 's|.*> *\\(.*\\)</h3>|\\1|p'\n\nTo get your coordinates by IP you can use:\ncurl -s http://whatismycountry.com/ | sed -n 's/.*Coordinates \\(.*\\)<.*/\\1/p'\n\n\nA: Here's a Python 2.x script similar to the one posted by @Mike McKay, which will use all the available Geoclue providers and output their location information in a pretty-printed format (requires apt-get install python-geoclue):\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nimport Geoclue\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nprint(\"Geoclue version %s\" % Geoclue.VERSION)\n\ndl = Geoclue.DiscoverLocation()\ndl.init()\nproviders = dl.get_available_providers()\n\nfor provider in providers:\n  pname = provider['name']\n  dl.set_position_provider(pname)\n  position = dl.get_location_info()\n\n  print(\"\\n%s\\n%s\" % (pname, \"-\"*len(pname)))\n  for k, v in position.items():\n    if k.endswith('_timestamp'):\n      v = datetime.fromtimestamp(v)\n    print(\"%-25s%s\" % (k+':',v))\n\n\nA: There is a workaround that use your IP and find your location based to your Real IP.\nfirst install lnyx\nsudo apt-get install lynx-cur\n\nNow the command is:\nlynx -dump http://www.ip-adress.com/ip_tracer/?QRY=$1|grep address|egrep 'city|state|country'|awk '{print $3,$4,$5,$6,$7,$8}'|sed 's\\ip address flag \\\\'|sed 's\\My\\\\'\n\n", "Q: Setting power profile on radeo driver I am trying to change the power profile on my ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4530 in order to prevent overheating.\nI'm following instructions which say to do the following:\nsudo sh -c \"echo profile > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method\"\nsudo sh -c \"echo mid > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile \"\n\nHowever when I try and run this I get the following error\nsh: 1: cannot create /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method: Directory nonexistent\n\nHow can I change the power profile so my laptop doesn't overheat?\n\nA: The problem was that the AMD Catalyst driver was still installed, the system wasn't using it because my card is no longer supported, however it was still installed and this was in some way preventing /sys/class/drm from being there.\nI uninstalled the AMD Catalyst driver and rebooted and after that I could change the power profile.\nThe good news is after running that command my temp dropped 15 degrees.\n", "Q: How can I undo a recently closed tab in Nautilus? Most browsers have a 'undo closed tab' which will reopen a closed tab in case you closed it by mistake. For firefox, it's ctrl+shift+t. Can I replicate this behaviour in nautilus and how?\nI looked at nautilus shortcuts but couldn't find a shortcut for that.\n\nAssume you have a deeply nested folder thats open in a tab in nautilus, then as you go to select it, you accidentally close it. Now to reopen the tab, you will have to manually track it down under multiple other folders. Am looking for a shortcut (not necessarily keyboard) to restore the tab in the current open nautilus.\n\nA: I don't think Nautilus or any of the major file browsers have this feature.\nThe only File manger I have seen this feature is ranger.\nAccording to ranger website:\n\nranger is a file manager with VI key bindings. It provides a minimalistic and nice curses interface with a view on the directory hierarchy.\n\nIn ranger you can use uq keybinding to undo closed tabs.\n\nA: Till now there is no shortcut for this behavior. You just can't open recently closed tab.\nPlease note that nautilus is a file browser and it's totally different from web browsers such as firefox and google chrome.\nI don't think there exists a file browser with this feature to the best of my knowledge.\n", "Q: Gnome Menu Broken? I think my Applications Menu (the top right in Gnome Fallback) is broken or something.

Obviously, it is not possible to write this manually, so I want to generate the argument str_1,str_2, etc automatically and then copy it to the shell (or, if there is a better way to do, please let me know).\nHow can I generate this list?\n\nA: #!/usr/bin/python3\n\nimport os\n\ndef create_list(string_input):\n    number = 0\n    string_list = []\n    while number <= 1000:\n        number = number+1\n        string_list.append(string_input+str(number))\n    return(string_list)\n\ncommand_list = create_list(string_input = \"test\")\nfor item in command_list:\n    os.system(\"firefox -new-tab \"+item)\n\nThis would run firefox 1000 times, opening new tabs with \"test1, test2\" as url (don't try :)) \nchange \"string_input\" to your string, \"firefox -new-tab\" to your application.\nedit: I must have had a weak moment, can be much shorter in python as well of course:\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\nimport subprocess\n\ncommand_list = [\n    \"firefox -new-tab \"+\"test\"+str(number) for number in range(0,1001)\n    ]\nfor command in command_list:\n    subprocess.call(command)\n\n\nA: # array=( str_1 str_2 str_3 ... str_1000 )\narray=( str_{1..1000} )          \n\n# prints the content of the array as a single string with comma between elements. \n# str_1,str_2,str_3,...,str_1000   \n( IFS=,; printf '%s\\n' \"${array[*]}\"; ) \n\nSee http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/005 for more on using arrays in bash.\n\nA: This will work nicely in Bash only:\narray=( str_{1..1000} )\njoined_array=\"$(printf '%s,' \"${array[@]}\")\"\necho \"${joined_array%,}\"\n\nThe last echo line is to omit the trailing comma.\nFirst line of the commands is from geirha's answer.\n\nA: There are, as always, plenty of solutions.\nPersonally, for such a simple thing as this, neither do I write a whole Python script, nor do I declare arrays in bash or change the internal field separator.\nInstead I just write something like this, right from the command line, in one line:\nfor i in {1..1000}; do printf str_$i,; done\n\nThis will output a string str_1,str_2,...,str_1000,. Depending on the level of automation you need, if you would like to strip the trailing , then one of an estimated gajillion possibilities is to use sed:\nfor i in {1..1000}; do printf str_$i,; done | sed 's/,$//;'\n\ngiving you str_1,str_2,...,str_1000.\nUpdate:\nIt just came to me that since you only want to do a print, you can even do without an explicit loop. Short & crisp:\necho str_{1..1000} | sed 's/ /,/g'\n\nThe latter command also gives you str_1,str_2,...,str_1000.\nExplanation: The echo str_{1..1000} outputs str_1 str_2 ... str_1000. The sed 's/ /,/g' replaces all whitespaces by commas.\n", "Q: Repository Location I've recently updated to a development version of Trusty, and it disabled all the PPAs I've added.

Sometimes linux could appear to be frozen but actually, it could just be a pci issue where no inputs are being accepts.\nWhat part is freezing?\nHave you tried USB installation over DVD installation? What are the steps you used to create the DVD(or USB)?\nHere is a similar thread. Seems like you have a nVidia GPU, and it seems like your motherboard does not have an onboard display out. The solution mentioned is to use nomodeset when installing/booting to either liveCD or ubuntu itself. Of course this depends on what kind of freezing issues you are having. \nTry to minimize possible hardware issues. I see that you have 2 HDD's attached. Disabling RAID may be worth a shot as well. The thread I linked also mentioned that there could be issues with multiple HDDs and noted it was better to isolate the linux installation on one drive though I do not understand the detailed logic behind that. Additionally, validate that your RAM is stable. Seems like there are hard freezing issues when the RAM is faulty. I see that you have 4 sticks. See what happens when you only use one. Note:  Use 64-bit distros. 32-bit has a RAM limit.\nI did not see anything about IOMMU settings on this mother but check if you have this. Sometimes keyboard/mouse will not work because of this which may be causing the \"freezing\". Depending on where it freezes, it may be worth it to try an external mouse/keyboard. Avoid USB 3.0 if possible. \nUEFI can also cause complications. Did you boot the installation device in UEFI mode?\nI'd suggest adding more details to your post with these questions.\n\nA: Actually after time it was Linux problem itself.

How can I repeat a command every interval of time , so that it will allow  me to run commands for checking  or monitoring  directories ? \nThere is no need for a script, i need just a simple command to be executed in terminal.\n\nA: If you are monitoring the file system, then inotifywait is brilliant and certainly adds less load on your system.\nExample : \nIn 1st terminal type this command :\n$ inotifywait .\n\nThen in 2nd terminal, any command that affects the current directory,\n$ touch newfile\n\nThen in original terminal inotifywait will wake up and report the event\n./ CREATE newfile2\n\nOr in a loop\n$ while true ; do inotifywait . ; done\nSetting up watches.  \nWatches established.\n./ OPEN newfile2\nSetting up watches.  \nWatches established.\n./ OPEN newfile2\nSetting up watches.  \nWatches established.\n./ DELETE newfile\nSetting up watches.  \nWatches established.\n./ CREATE,ISDIR newdir\nSetting up watches.  \nWatches established.\n\n\nA: you can use crontab. run the command crontab -e and open it with your preferred  text editor, then add this line\n*/10 * * * *  /path-to-your-command\n\nThis will run your command every 10 minutes\n* */4 * * *  /path-to-your-command\n\nThis will run your command every 4 hours\nAnother possible solution\n$ ..some command...; for i in $(seq X); do $cmd; sleep Y; done\n\nX number of times to repeat.\nY time to wait to repeat.\nExample :\n$ echo; for i in $(seq 5); do $cmd \"This is echo number: $i\"; sleep 1;done\n\n\nA: You can create your own repeat command doing the following steps; credits here:\nFirst, open your .bash_aliases file:\n$ xdg-open ~/.bash-aliases\n\nSecond, paste these lines at the bottom of the file and save:\nrepeat() {\nn=$1\nshift\nwhile [ $(( n -= 1 )) -ge 0 ]\ndo\n    \"$@\"\ndone\n}\n\nThird, either close and open again your terminal, or type:\n$ source ~/.bash_aliases\n\nEt voilà ! You can now use it like this:\n$ repeat 5 echo Hello World !!!\n\nor\n$ repeat 5 ./myscript.sh\n\n\nA: Just wanted to pitch in to sourav c.'s and nux's answers:\n\n*\n\n*While watch will work perfectly on Ubuntu, you might want to avoid that if you want your \"Unix-fu\" to be pure. On FreeBSD for example, watch is a command to \"snoop on another tty line\".\n\n\n*while true; do command; sleep SECONDS; done also has a caveat: your command might be harder to kill using Ctrl+C. You might prefer:\nwhile sleep SECONDS; do command; done\n\nIt's not only shorter, but also easier to interrupt. The caveat is that it will first sleep, then run your command, so you'll need to wait some SECONDS before the first occurrence of the command will happen.\n\nA: Another concern with the \"watch\" approach proposed above is that it does display the result only when the process is done.\n\"date;sleep 58;date\" will display the 2 dates only after 59 seconds... If you start something running for 4 minutes, that display slowly multiple pages of content, you will not really see it.\nOn the other hand, the concern with the \"while\" approach is that it doesn't take the task duration into consideration.\nwhile true; do script_that_take_between_10s_to_50s.sh; sleep 50; done\n\nWith this, the script will run sometime every minutes, sometime might take 1m40. So even if a cron will be able to run it every minutes, here, it will not.\nSo to see the output on the shell as it's generated and wait for the exact request time, you need to look at the time before, and after, and loop with the while.\nSomething like:\nwhile ( true ); do\n  echo Date starting `date`\n  before=`date +%s`\n  sleep `echo $(( ( RANDOM % 30 )  + 1 ))`\n  echo Before waiting `date`\n  after=`date +%s`\n  DELAY=`echo \"60-($after-$before)\" | bc`\n  sleep $DELAY\n  echo Done waiting `date`\ndone\n\nThis will output this:\nAs you can see, the command runs every minutes:\nDate starting Mon Dec 14 15:49:34 EST 2015\nBefore waiting Mon Dec 14 15:49:52 EST 2015\nDone waiting Mon Dec 14 15:50:34 EST 2015\n\nDate starting Mon Dec 14 15:50:34 EST 2015\nBefore waiting Mon Dec 14 15:50:39 EST 2015\nDone waiting Mon Dec 14 15:51:34 EST 2015\n\nSo just replace the \"sleep echo $(( ( RANDOM % 30 )  + 1 ))\" command with what ever you want and that will be run, on the terminal/shell, exactly every minute. If you want another schedule, just change the \"60\" seconds with what ever you need.\nShorter version without the debug lines:\nwhile ( true ); do\n  before=`date +%s`\n  sleep `echo $(( ( RANDOM % 30 )  + 1 ))` # Place you command here\n  after=`date +%s`\n  DELAY=`echo \"60-($after-$before)\" | bc`\n  sleep $DELAY\ndone\n\n\nA: You can use  watch command, watch is used to run any designated command at regular intervals.\nOpen Terminal and type:\nwatch -n x <your command>\n\nchange x to be the time in seconds you want.\nFor more help using the watch command and its options, run man watch or visit this Link.\nFor example : the following will list, every 60s, on the same Terminal, the contents of the Desktop directory so that you can know if any changes took place:\nwatch -n 60 ls -l ~/Desktop\n\n\nA: Sounds like the ideal task for the cron daemon which allows for running periodic commands. Run the crontab -e command to start editing your user's cron configuration. Its format is documented in crontab(5). Basically you have five time-related, space-separated fields followed by a command:\nThe time and date fields are:\n\n       field          allowed values\n       -----          --------------\n       minute         0-59\n       hour           0-23\n       day of month   1-31\n       month          1-12 (or names, see below)\n       day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sunday, or use names)\n\nFor example, if you would like to run a Python script on every Tuesday, 11 AM:\n0 11 * * 1 python ~/yourscript.py\n\nThere are also some special names that replace the time, like @reboot. Very helpful if you need to create a temporary directory. From my crontab (listed with crontab -l):\n# Creates a temporary directory for ~/.distcc at boot\n@reboot ln -sfn \"$(mktemp -d \"/tmp/distcc.XXXXXXXX\")\" \"$HOME/.distcc\"\n\n\nA: You can also use this command in terminal, apart from nux's answer:\nwhile true; do <your_command>; sleep <interval_in_seconds>; done\n\nExample:\nwhile true; do ls; sleep 2; done\n\nThis command will print the output of ls at an interval of 2 sec.\nUse Ctrl+C to stop the process.\nThere are few drawbacks of watch:\n\n*\n\n*It cannot use any aliased commands.\n\n*If the output of any command is quite long, scrolling does not work properly.\n\n*There is some trouble to set the maximum time interval beyond a certain value.\n\n*watch will interpret ANSI color sequences passing escape characters using -c or --color option. For example output of pygmentize will work but it will fail for ls --color=auto.\n\nIn the above circumstances this may appear as a better option.\n", "Q: \"Turn screen off when inactive\"-setting from terminal I want to turn the \"Turn screen off when inactive for x minutes\" setting (in the brightness settings) to \"never\" from the terminal, but I couldn't find the right command.\nThis will be used in a executable file to change a few settings on a Ubuntu live installation.\nEdit:\nDue to more involved reasons I want to change this specific setting which is independent of the screen saver settings (I think).\n\nA: I think you can use this command:\nxset s off\n\nFrom the xset manual page (man xset):\ns       The  s  option  lets you set the screen saver parameters.  This\n       option   accepts   up   to   two   numerical   parameters,    a\n       'blank/noblank'  flag,  an  'expose/noexpose' flag, an 'on/off'\n       flag, an 'activate/reset' flag, or the 'default' flag.   If  no\n       parameters  or  the  'default' flag is used, the system will be\n       set to its default screen saver characteristics.  The  'on/off'\n       flags  simply  turn  the screen saver functions on or off.  The\n       'activate' flag forces activation of screen saver even  if  the\n       screen  saver  had  been  turned  off.  The 'reset' flag forces\n       deactivation of screen saver if it is active.  The 'blank' flag\n       sets  the preference to blank the video (if the hardware can do\n       so) rather than display a background pattern,  while  'noblank'\n       sets  the preference to display a pattern rather than blank the\n       video.  The 'expose' flag sets the preference to  allow  window\n       exposures  (the  server  can  freely  discard window contents),\n       while 'noexpose' sets the preference to  disable  screen  saver\n       unless  the  server  can regenerate the screens without causing\n       exposure events.  The length  and  period  parameters  for  the\n       screen  saver  function  determines how long the server must be\n       inactive for screen saving  to  activate,  and  the  period  to\n       change  the background pattern to avoid burn in.  The arguments\n       are specified in seconds.  If only one numerical  parameter  is\n       given, it will be used for the length.\n\n\nfor Gnome and Unity desktops, to turn lock screen after an amount of time off:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled  false\n\nto turn it back on:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled true\n\nYou can also set x minutes after which the screen will lock after the screen blanks, but you have to enter it as seconds (multiply by 60):\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-delay \"x\"\n\nAn example values are 300 for 5 minutes - you may be able to enter as minutes in the following bash line:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-delay $(echo X*60 | bc)\n\nWhere X is a number in minutes - seems to work in Ubuntu 13.10.\nOh, and to disable screen dimming:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power idle-dim false\n\n\nA: gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 0\n\nwill prevent your screen from locking and change that setting to never.\nNotice: close / re-open the settings window to see the effects the command takes.\nThe value that you write there is the time (in seconds) that it will take for Unity to decide that you have not been doing anything and the screen should be locked.\n\nA: Try this it worked to me at least :\nxset +dpms\nxset dpms 300\n\n300 is 5 min , so if it is 5 min inactive , it will power off .\n", "Q: apache2 enable ssl on subdirectory I just turned on ssl on my server, if I type on the browser https://myserver I get main apache welcome page if I use https://myserver/mydir I get a 404 error, if I simply use http://myserver/mydir I get right content.

If you are using /etc/fstab, you need to set options for that partition.  \nIf it's ext3 or ext4, you can use defaults,user_xattr.  \nNTFS is more complicated, and I don't actually have one to check, but it's something like:\ndefaults,dmask=027,fmask=137,umask=007  and sometimes you need to set the owner and group IDs (something like uid=1000,gid=1000 added to the list.  But there are a lot of variations, depending on your needs and tastes.  Like, do you want to be the owner, or do you want to be in a group that has certain permissions?

I followed all the instructions provided on Ubuntu forums. I also installed refit on my mac.\nBut after I restart the computer and go into the refit menu, I just see boot legacy OS options, and do not see any option for booting from the USB drive I created.\nI am reading here that it the USB needs grub2 and so on but if there is anything extra needed it should be part of the clear instruction process. I have spent two frustrating days trying to install Ubuntu, and it certainly is not motivating.\n\nA: I also have a Mac running Mavericks and I installed Ubuntu on it without using refit. Make sure the USB you are using is a bootable USB. I used a bootable DVD to do my installation, just because its much easier to create a bootable DVD using disk utility. Here are the steps I used: (This method worked for me, I am currently using Ubuntu to answer this question and do programming on it)\n   1. Use disk utility to make a free disk space partition of how much ever space you\n      want to provide for your Ubuntu. \n   2. Once you make the partition, you want to insert the DVD or USB into the macbook\n      and restart your computer.\n   3. On startup, hold down the 'alt' button on your macbook to get to the boot menu.\n   4. Choose the boot DVD or USB and it should take you to the installation process.\n   5. Once you go through the pick you language step, you should get an option\n      asking if you want to install Ubuntu along side mac OS, remove your current OS\n      and install Ubuntu, or custom.\n   6. Choose whichever you want, whether you want to run it alongside or just have \n      Ubuntu and remove Mac OS completely. That's your choice.\n   7. From there just follow the steps and you should be good, it will update and\n      when it restarts you will see the menu to boot from Ubuntu, or if you chose to\n      run alongside mac, to boot from mac. (Quick Tip: If you choose to boot mac,\n      don't choose mac from the boot menu whenever your laptop turns on. Just hit\n      'esc' and type 'exit' and hit 'enter', that should boot in Mac OS then. If you want to boot in\n      Ubuntu just leave it alone and it will automatically boot into Ubuntu.)\n\n* Do remember to BACK UP YOUR MACBOOK before trying to install Ubuntu on your Mac since it is very tricky and kind of risky. If something goes wrong you can always boot back into Mac and install Mavericks again. Shouldn't lose anything but its always best to Backup! Remember it is TRICKY and RISKY so if you try this... Pay attention to what you do and try at your own risk.*\n", "Q: Black desktop after login and problems with GUI in Ubuntu 12.10, 13.04 and 13.10 (currently using 13.10) I am having problems with the GUI when I log in. Please check out the youtube-link at the bottom first to see the problem. (I am currently using 13.10)\nProblem: First of all, when I have logged in and reached the desktop it is black instead of showing the real background. The graphics lag when I move the pointer over icons (e.g the text that shows up describing the icons to the left remains after I have removed the pointer) and if I open a window and move it around trace of its graphics remains (like to paint the \"frame\" all over the background if I move it all over the desktop, common lag problem in Windows XP etc.).\nWhat I do to fix the problem is simply to use xkill on the background and all the lag stops. The real desktop image comes back after a few minutes and everything turns to normal. I have done like this a couple of months but a better solution to the problem likely exists.

Close firefox, open a terminal and type:\nmv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla-backup\n\nto clean up your firefox session. Launch firefox again and check if the issue persists.\nIf it worked, you can recover your old history and bookmarks by copying the database in ~/.mozilla-backup/firefox/xxxxxxxxxxx.default/places.sqlite to your new ~/.mozilla/firefox/profile (xxxxxxxxxxxx are numbers are letters generated by firefox to your current user/session), browse it with nautilus to see yours. \nRemember that the more extensions you add, the more functionallities, but also the more resources and potential missfunctions. \n\nA: As in @Rho 's answer, if you move the profile folder, it will remove extensions etc. there are other ways to implement this.\nIf you have already followed Rho's answer, which should work nicely anyway, you can run the following to restore the Firefo profile:\nmv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozillaX\nmv ~/.mozilla-backup ~/.mozilla\n\nThis will move the folder that would of been created if you have opened Firefox since, then restore the original.\nNow, you can open Firefox, and enter the following in the address bar:\nabout:addons\n\nBy disabling all the unnecessary extensions, it should hopefully speed up Firefox.\n\nNow, for a different implementation of Rho's answer, close Firefox and run:\nfirefox -P\n\nThen you can use this dialogue to add profiles:\n\nCreate a new profile, and select it. make sure 'Don't ask a Startup' is selected otherwise it gets annoying, and then click Start Firefox\nAt anytime, you can close firefox and switch profiles using firefox -P.\n", "Q: Is running Ubuntu/XP duel boot safe now that XP is being pulled? I'm new to askubuntu and I was hoping someone might be able to provide some insight into a question I have. I run a duel-boot PC with Ubuntu/WinXP and, despite XP being pulled this April, I'd like to continue using XP safely. The reason for this is that, whilst I have a dual-boot, I use Ubuntu about 95-99% of the time but there is the very rare occasion when I need Windows. What I plan to do is keep Linux as my everyday OS and only use XP without a network connection. What I'd like to know is, would you deem this as safe? With both OS' being on the same drive (albeit on different partitions), is one OS vulnerable to getting a virus from the other i.e Linux to Windows? Can a virus \"jump\" from one partition to another? I apologise if this sounds trivial but I'm not too clued up on the nature of partitions. I have considered upgrading to Win7/8 but spending £100+ really wouldn't be warranted,\nMany thanks,\nRob\n\nA: If you do not connect to the internet using XP, it is unlikely that your XP will be infected through Linux. That is, if you do not have a shared FAT or NTFS partition and you do not use the Windows partition to store files on from Linux. By default Windows cannot read ext4 or older.\nAnother thing is that you are extremely vulnarable if you use other files than the ones you are 100% sure of. Many threats, malware, viruses are \"saved\" untill the date that support for XP will expire and there will be no fixes developped.\n\nA: It should be quite safe to use XP when disconnected from the internet, however there are three ways I can see that you could have your XP partition infected while doing what you describe (never connecting to the internet when XP is running).\nFirst, if you download an infected file (while on Ubuntu) and then open up or interact with that file in XP, the XP partition could become infected. If you only place files onto your XP partition that are from sources you trust, this is extremely unlikely to happen.\nSecond, if your Ubuntu install becomes infected, then that infection could infect the XP partition. This is extremely unlikely, and using XP would only cause a minuscule increase to your exposure to the threat of infection.\nThird, if you already have an infection on your XP partition (e.g. a virus that waits until XP is unsupported), your XP partition could already be infected. This is unlikely, especially if you have practiced good security habits while using the XP install before the expiration, and if you only interact with files from sources you trust. If you make a clean install of XP and only connect to the internet to download updates, the risk of this happening will be minuscule.\nIn short, it will be safe to use XP when not connected to the internet if you only interact with files from sources you trust. One way to improve security is to only put files where XP can access it if they are from a source you trust (the Ubuntu partition will likely not be accessible by XP, since it will probably be in the ext3 or ext4 format).\n", "Q: Cannot run cron job for a php script I want to run a php script using cron job on localhost.

These scripts are:\n\n\n*\n\n*apm=off\n\n*no=hlt\nThe function of these scripts is to prevent premature laptop shutdown when my laptop is a little bit hot but not hot enough to burn the CPU.\n\nA: \"apm=off\" and \"no=hlt\" are boot parameters. There is a good guide on the grumpymole blog for editing boot parameters temporarily and permanently.\nI highly suggest you try to keep your laptop cooler first, since setting these two options will likely make it possible for your CPU to melt, literally. You can try ensuring there is proper ventalation, using the ondemand CPU governor (see how to change default scaling governor back to ondemand), stop any overclocking that is set, invest in a $10.00 external fan to protect your $500.00 laptop, and/or clean out the dust from the fans (see any of the results on this searh).\nI would only edit these boot parameters as a last resort, since the computer usually only shuts down due to heat when it gets dangerously hot.\n", "Q: Tool like GeekTool [ see logs on your desktop ] Anyone know of a good alternative to geektool in macos x?

A better plan would be to do a clean install after copying any files you want to keep elsewhere.\nAlso, if it's that old, you might consider Lubuntu, as it is less demanding of memory and processing.\n\nA: Unfortunately, 10.10 is an unsupported and obsolete version as per Upgrade Notes \nHowever; you may have a look to the following article for some work around.\nanother suggestion -although lengthy and requires a lot of downloads is to download 11.04 and 11.10 ISOs from Ubuntu Old Releases and do an offline upgrade 10.10 > 11.04 > 11.10\n\n\n*\n\n*Nice guide with illustrations Here\nthen you should be able to upgrade normally from 11.10 to 12.04 LTS\nand for sure, Lubuntu is the best candidate for your old laptop.\n", "Q: Installing OpenJDK 7 didnt install javac I am very new to using the linux operating system and I'm currently using Ubuntu 13.10 coming off using windows for my whole life. I have been trying to get java development kit installed so I could create and compile java programs. However, when I installed the openJDK program from the ubuntu software center everything went fine and the program installed except it seems as though it didn't install javac to compile. When i open up terminal and type javac it comes up telling me where it can be found implying it wasn't installed. So I was wondering what I need to do in order to get javac to be installed so I could compile in programs such as eclipse. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The javac (and other Java development tools) is available for openjdk-7-jdk.\nNote that basic compiling within Eclipse might work without javac (but I still recommend having javac) because Eclipse uses its own compiler. See this answer below.\n\nA: I'm not a developer but you might need to have a look to Eclipse.\nyou can find details in below article and see if it suits you\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.eclipse.org/home/newcomers.php\nYou can install it from Software Center; but for latest version; you will need to refer back to Eclipse Website\n", "Q: Are any Ubuntu (Linux) vulnerabilities in media applications? Ubuntu (Linux)  has a solid system that permits and requires root privileges to modify the system.\nHowever; if an installed application eg. VLC, audacious, some image viewer installed from the software center has a vulnerability, and these applications play a file with an embedded malicious code or maybe an executable does exploits vulnerabilities in the application that was already running with administrator privileges (VLC, audacious etc ...).\nCould this compromise the system?\n\nA: Yes, this is entirely plausible. The simple way to prevent this is to adhere to the principle of least privilege and to only run programs with elevated permissions only when it's required. For example, you would need to do this for managing user and group accounts, but this should never be done for running media apps such as VLC. \n", "Q: How to install Jupiter on Ubuntu 12.04 I am currently running 12.04 and I can't get Jupiter to install on my computer.\nThese are the commands I am running to install it:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install jupiter\n\nThis is the error I get after updating:\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/jupiter/ubuntu/dists/saucy/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nand finally after install jupiter, I get this error:\nReading package lists...

For example, if there was a command call lookup (not an alias), how would I go about removing it?\n\nA: A better way would be to redirect the output of the command to /dev/null. That way, the command will 'be there' but will show no results.\nExample: the ls command.   \n\n\n*\n\n*Make an alias\nalias ls = \"ls > /dev/null\"\n\n*Running ls now will not show any results.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks to @scai\nIn the answer above, the command will still show errors because we have redirected stdout but not stderr plus a more serious issue, it will still run the command.\nQuoting @scai:\n\nIf the command in question does things you don't like, for example creating or deleting files, changing settings, painting your nose blue, then this alias won't stop it from doing these things.\n\nFor the workaround, we will just alias the command to an empty string, then just redirect the resulting error to /dev/null.\nalias ls = \"\" > /dev/null 2>&1\n\nThat's much better now.\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks to @scai again :-)\nThis is a temporary solution.\nTo revert back to the original function of the command (in our case ls), just run unalias ls.\n\nA: You can do that but you shouldn't.\nAnyway there are four main places for commands.\n/bin & /usr/bin & /sbin & /usr/sbin\nTo know the command you want where is\nwhereis COMMAND\n\nThen as a root you can delete or just rename or move to other directory\nsudo rm /path/command\n\nOr \nsudo mv /path/commad /newPath\n\nBe sure that the newPath is not in your $PATH environment \n\nA: I think this \"proper\" way to do this would be to use permissions. Let's take the ls command as an example as well.\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 105840 /bin/ls*\n\nHere's how I would do it :\nCreate a group for users allowed to use ls, let's say we call it lsusers.\nsudo addgroup lsusers\n\nAdd users to this group accordingly\nsudo usermod -aG lsusers [username]\n\nRemove world permissions on /bin/ls\nsudo chmod o= /bin/ls\n\nChange the group ownership of /bin/ls\nsudo chgrp lsusers /bin/ls\n\nMake sure group permission allow at least executing\nsudo chmod 0710 /bin/ls\n\nThis should bring something like :\n-rwx--x--- 1 root lsusers 105840 /bin/ls*\n\nWhich allows root and lsusers members to execute /bin/ls. Actually, the big problem of aliases is that they can be overridden most of the time. Changing permissions of something belonging to root, now that is a little harder.\nNow, about real removal, well this is a package problem. If you want to remove a program (command) from your system, just ask for its package to be removed with :\nsudo apt-get --purge remove [package name]\n\nOf course, this is not the kind of things you could do with /bin/ls (and I'm not sure you'd like to actually rm it :p)\n", "Q: How to use apt-get to download multi-arch library? Is it possible to force apt-get to download a multi-architecture binary of the library I want to install?\nOr is apt-get not the right tool for this?\n\nA: @Tanasis's answer is correct, I have updated it for 2021 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS) for arm64 and armhf.\n\n*\n\n*Add your desired architectures as follows:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture arm64\n\n\n*Create a new .list file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d:\nsudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list.d/arm-cross-compile-sources.list\n\n\n*Add the default sources to that list with the architectures (armhf, arm64) prefixed as such:\ndeb [arch=armhf,arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ focal main restricted\ndeb [arch=armhf,arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ focal-updates main restricted\ndeb [arch=armhf,arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ focal universe\ndeb [arch=armhf,arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ focal-updates universe\ndeb [arch=armhf,arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ focal multiverse\ndeb [arch=armhf,arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ focal-updates multiverse\ndeb [arch=armhf,arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ focal-backports main restricted universe multiverse\n\n\n\n*Update /etc/apt/sources.list to include your default architecture (if it doesn't already), otherwise apt will try to use your newly added architectures in those sources which may cause errors as it did with me. Add [arch=amd64] for each line in /etc/apt/sources.list as follows:\ndeb [arch=amd64] http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse\n\n\n*Run sudo apt update and make sure you get no errors\n\n\n*Installing a package with the new architectures should be successful now:\nsudo apt install libasound2-dev:arm64\n\nA: For arm64 I am doing the following on the /etc/apt/sources.list: \nUbuntu 16.04 (xenial) example:\nI mark all the current (default) repos as [arch=<current_os_arch>], e.g. \ndeb [arch=amd64] http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial main restricted\nAnd I added the following:\ndeb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ xenial main restricted\n\ndeb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ xenial-updates main restricted\n\ndeb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ xenial universe\ndeb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ xenial-updates universe\n\ndeb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ xenial multiverse\ndeb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ xenial-updates multiverse\n\ndeb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ xenial-backports main restricted universe multiverse\n\nNot sure if this is the corrent fix, but at least it seems to be working.\nNote: Don't forget to add foreign architecture: dpkg --add-architecture arm64\n\nA: First to enable multi-arch\ndpkg --add-architecture <arch>\n\nNow setup apt-sources to add the new repositories of the new architecture(if you need)\nnow update your sources.list\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow you can install multi-arch packages via apt-get regularly but you have to specify which architecture you want to download\napt-get install package:architecture\n\nexample:\napt-get install gedit:i386\n\n", "Q: Installing autotools, autoconf on Ubuntu I need to install autotools. When I search on the Internet, there are various method given that use commands like ./configure, for example.\nPlease guide me on how to install autoconf, autotools, and related packages on my system. A step by step guide would be very helpful.\n\nA: To install autotools:\nsudo apt-get install autotools-dev\n\nTo install autoconf\nsudo apt-get install autoconf\n\n\nA: Installing autoconf is easy, type in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install autoconf\n\n\nA: Installing from repositories is always prefered unless you need the last version of autotools. In that case you will have to download it manually and install it manually. GNU autotools are three packages: Autoconf, Automake and Libtool. Here are the steps to manually install it:\ncd /usr/local/src\n\nAutoconf:\nwget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.69.tar.gz \ntar xf autoconf*\ncd autoconf-2.69\nsh configure --prefix /usr/local\nmake install\n\nAutomake:\nwget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/automake-1.15.tar.gz\ntar xf automake*\ncd automake-1.15\nsh configure --prefix /usr/local\nmake install\n\nLibtool:\nwget http://mirror.jre655.com/GNU/libtool/libtool-2.4.6.tar.gz\ntar xf libtool*\ncd libtool-2.4.6\nsh configure --prefix /usr/local\nmake install \n\nMost importantly\nYou don't need autotools installed to run ./configure, that it's a key feature of autotools. On the other hand if you are not given the configure script you will need autotools installed to generate it.\nNote\nmake install will internally call make. Thus, there is no need in this case of calling make. Normally, Autotools expect you to call make without sudo privileges and make install with sudo. In this case for simplicity I skipped this guideline. It's (or is it?) fairly reasonable to trust there is no malware in the autotools generated Makefile.\n\nA: After installing the packages autoconf, automake and libtool, what I did was reconfigure because the error persisted. Then after reconfiguring I was allowed to compile and install without errors.\n$ sudo sh configure --prefix /usr/local\n$ sudo make install\n\nThe justification of why to use /usr/local and not /usr/local/apache2 I leave you in the next publication\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 Cannot download files with firefox after 7 march 2014 update After today update I cant seem to download any files using firefox.\nI can still download and directly with the \"Open With\" even the extension DownThemAll and Flashgot is working.

I just made a script to backup my files at shutdown and added it to init.d then linked it to rc6.d and I gave it the prefix or runlevel of \"K01myscript\".\nThe question is, will it cause any problem with my system? I have been testing it and it was working, I am just not sure if it will do some damage to the system in the long run.\n\nA: In essence: its ok, it will work as you want, specially if you are giving it such a high priority.\nBut the correct procedure for that would be to create a script in /etc/init.d with the correct structure (look for the scripts inside that directory for examples) and issue the command sudo update-rc.d foo_script.\nIt will then create links to your script in the specified priority written in the script while maintaining the necessary other services for your script to run. But since your script has a very high run priority and no other services necessary should down up by then you do not need to worry about that.\nWhat you did was just a short cut for what happens using that procedure and it should be fine.\n", "Q: Can I show the native Ubuntu package version of a program for that a never version is installed from a PPA?

It's just a monitoring to terminal and not command history.\n\nA: The bash terminal commands history for a user is stored in $HOME/.bash_history file. The commands used in the tty session will be written to the .bash_history file when the tty session is terminated; but running history -c command will prevent them from being appended in the history file. What history command does is it displays the contents of the $HOME/.bash_history. (You can also check and/or edit the file with text editors, say with nano $HOME/.bash_history.)\n\n\n\"A command with a space before it won't be stored.., !! or duplicate commands won't be stored, etc.\"\n\nYou can change the settings according to your needs by making changed in $HOME/.bashrc file. This post explains how: Get bash history to remember only the commands run with space prefixed!. \nAnd in this file you may find lines like:\n# for setting history length see HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in bash(1)\nHISTSIZE=1000\nHISTFILESIZE=2000\n\nHISTSIZE is the number of commands to remember in the command history. The default value is 500.\nHISTFILESIZE is maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When this variable is assigned a value, the history  file  is  truncated,  if  necessary,  by removing the oldest entries, to contain no more than that number of lines.  The default value is 500. The history file is also truncated to this size after writing it when an interactive shell exits.\n\nSo, to summarize history -c just clears the running tty session's history and the previous commands should still be accessible with history command provided the older commands are not truncated as per the HISTFILESIZE <= max_lines constraint.\n", "Q: Can I manage dpkg-installed package with apt-get? At the very beginning after I set up my Ubuntu 12.04, I installed Webmin (dpkg -s webmin reports the version to be 1.610) by first downloading the .deb file with wget and then running dpkg --install webmin_1.610_all.deb, according to the instructions on Webmin.\nLater, I found that I prefer to use apt-get to manage as much packages as possible, so that I can manage them in a unified way. Is it possible (or does it make sense at all to ask in this way) to make apt-get to manage this Webmin package installed with dpkg?  I understand there is a APT repository and the latest version is 1.67. If so, how to do that?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: In short: the answer to your question is just in the page you posted. \nIf you like to install and update Webmin via APT, edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file on your system and add the lines : \ndeb http://download.webmin.com/download/repository sarge contrib\ndeb http://webmin.mirror.somersettechsolutions.co.uk/repository sarge contrib \n\nYou should also fetch and install my GPG key with which the repository is signed, with the commands : \ncd /root\nwget http://www.webmin.com/jcameron-key.asc\napt-key add jcameron-key.asc \n\nYou will now be able to install with the commands : \napt-get update\napt-get install webmin\n\nLong version. If the package was installed with dpkg then it is installed. Once installed apt-get can handle it, i.e. you may run sudo apt-get remove webmin to uninstall it, or sudo apt-get install -f to fix the dependencies. \nJust to be clear, apt-get USES dpkg. In a very short simplified way, dpkg is the engine behind apt-get (and aptitude), it's the guy leading with the actual installation of packages directly and, of course, is potentially harmful to your system if you mess up, whilst apt-get really takes care of you trying to avoid any disturbance that dpkg may generate. :)\nGoing to the point, the first part of my answer reply to you directly, the alternative to install a .deb with dpkg is to add a repository. Why, well in the repository you will catch every update of the program, while with dpkg your version is fixed. Also, in theory, the repo may solve all your dependencies automatically. In dpkg is allways convenient check for broken packages afeter the installation with sudo apt-get install -f. \nAdding a repo consist on four steps: add the address of the software source, add the key to make ubuntu able to trust the source, update the database, and install. All of them are above. Adding a ppa saves you the steps 1 and 2!

It came to me with FreeDOS. I installed Windows 7 and a few days ago I wanted to install Ubuntu 12.04.4 to my pc alongside Windows 7. \nBut I read about UEFI about problem which happens to new pcs. I have C, D, E partitions on my pc. Windows is in C. I wanted to install Ubuntu to E. The E partition has 58 GB. And 50 GB of it is empty.\nAnd I parted that 50 GB to 30 GB.

I did not touch them , But there also to partitons which are sda2 which is double clickable. The other one says that it can not be used and I chose the sda2 and formatted it in ext4 But swap area is not created. And I continued whithout formatting the swap area. But my Ubuntu and Windows works well. Only one problem my E partition has dissapeared. It is not important but I created different place for Ubuntu. Why is this happening?\n\nA: Your E partition disappeared because Windows doesn't recognize ext4 file system. Everything's normal. You have correctly installed Ubuntu!  \n\nA: Linux recognizes window's NTFS file system but windows doesn't recognize the linux ext, ext4 disk format. So therefore your linux partition wont be shown in windows. But however you can still see the linux disk partition in the disk management which is shown normally. You don't have any problem in installation. \n", "Q: How can I modify the power button behaviour?

The presenter works perfectly when presentations are not maximized, but when they are, the frame-flipping buttons do not work. I've tried this with both Chromium and Firefox and the behavior is the same. The presenter works okay in LibreOffice Impress.\n\nA: According to this page, you need to have Flash Player 11.3 or higher in order to have wireless presenters work with Prezi on fullscreen.\nUnfortunately, support for Flash Player for Linux stopped just before that, and if you use Firefox or Chromium you're stuck at version 11.2. One easy way to work around this is by installing Google Chrome. Unlike Chromium or Firefox, Chrome comes with its own, up-to-date Flash Player (currently, version 12).\nGoogle Chrome is not available in the Ubuntu Software Center, so you'll need to get it somewhere else. I recommend the official website: https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/\n\nA: I installed the browser Chromium from the Ubuntu software center.

The \"no-proxy\" option\naccepts a comma-separated list of host names or addresses.\nThe proxy options are exported in all hook execution contexts, and also\navailable in the shell through \"juju ssh\" or \"juju run\".\nThere are three additional proxy options specific for apt. These are set\nto be the same as the non-apt proxy values, but can be overridden\nindependently:\napt-http-proxy\napt-https-proxy\napt-ftp-proxy\n\nFor example, with a squid-deb-proxy running on a laptop, you can specify\nthe apt-http-proxy to use it for the containers by specifying the host\nmachine’s network-bridge:\napt-http-proxy: http://10.0.3.1:8000\n\nFor the 2.0 release of Juju, there is no way to set the environment globally before a model is created, but you can create a config.yaml file, containing the following:\ndefault-series: xenial\nno-proxy: localhost\napt-http-proxy: http://<ip address>:<port>\napt-https-proxy: https://<ip address>:<port>\napt-ftp-proxy: ftp://<ip address>:<port>\nhttp-proxy: http://<ip address>:<port>\nhttps-proxy: https://<ip address>:<port>\nftp-proxy: ftp://<ip address>:<port>\n\nYou can then use the --config option to tell Juju to use this file (I store mine in ~/.juju/). For example, juju bootstrap localhost lxd-test --config=config.yaml.\n\nA: I was facing similar issues on a devstack installation of openstack. It seems like the variable is case sensitive.

Some issues relating to overheating, issues in BIOS vs UEFI modes, wireless connection problems etc.\nI would be extremely thankful if someone could recommend wither I should choose Ubuntu\n12.04 LTS, LinuxMint, Luna, Linuxlite, Fedora, Kubuntu.\n\nA: This is really mostly a matter of taste, and I would advise you to try out and judge for yourself. There simply isn't a unique answer here.\nI recommend taking a look at DistroWatch which makes a good job in listing many popular distributions and their differences.\nUbuntu is certainly a good distribution to start with, easily usable by newbies yet as powerful as any Linux for advanced users. But so are many other distributions.\nIf it's going to be Ubuntu, you should choose between Ubuntu 12.04 (long time support) or Ubuntu 13.10 (the latest release). An LTS version typically has older software without the newest cutting-edge features, but provides a stable experience and you won't have to update for a long time. A non-LTS version such as 13.10 will give you newer software, yet it is only supported for 9 months, so you will have to do an upgrade sometime mid-2014 at the latest.\n\nA: Ok I got your back so prepare to get.... an answer:\nThe reason why you should chose Ubuntu ( I say 12.04)  it's because Ubuntu is backed up by Canonical, you see in order for any Linux distro out there to get updates to be: secured, increase performance.... there must be people out there to do that, Canonical is not just some 21 year old computer geek who is still learning Canonical it's a bussines they know what they are doing so being backed up by Canoical Ubuntu it's more reliable, it's more stable and secured. Other distros are developed by either a group either even one person but not much  an Enterprise.\nThe reason why you should chose 12.04 is because it's LTS (Long Term Support) Canonical will offer updates for this distro for a long time this makes the developers able to make good software for Ubuntu since they have the ensuring from Canonical that the distro is going to be \"alive\" until 2017.\n   There are a lot of great Linux  projects out there that is just great but really if you look on the market there are really only 3 of them RedHat (for like BIG data centers, big cloud infrastructure)\nUbuntu (more geard toward end user (home user) but also on servers and cloud) and Suse with Suse Linux Enterpise the same for all . \nFor example  really popular software it's available for Ubuntu such as : Skype, Steam, Teamviwer, GoogleChrome and a lot more on the Ubuntu Software Center, Other distros such as Fedora don't come with Steam,Skype you can get them wroking but... not even legal for example Ubuntu has access to legal MP3 encoding and other movie / music formats, again because Ubuntu look towards end-users such us you and me.\n", "Q: How to autostart a daemon after installation?

I chose that instance type so it comes with a Cirrus Logic GD 5446 for graphical executions.\nOf course the primary install is headless, so I had to build this server from scratch, what I did firstly is.\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install gdm\nsudo /etc/init.d/gdm start\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\nsudo apt-get install gnome-core\n\nAfter that I installed a LAMP server (the usual) and I updated the kernel to Linux ip-172-31-29-168 3.8.0-37-generic #53~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Feb 19 21:37:54 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux.\nI also registered the xorg edgers PPA at https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa.\nAfter rebooting I had to connect a screen to my server, I chose to do this with vnc4server.\nSo that's the usual and my xstartup looks like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:\nunset SESSION_MANAGER\n#exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc\ngnome-session --session=gnome-classic &\n\n[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup\n[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources\nxsetroot -solid grey\nvncconfig -iconic &\n#x-terminal-emulator -geometry 1280x1024+10+10 -ls -title \"$VNCDESKTOP Desktop\" &\n#x-window-manager &\n\nAfter starting my VNC server and connecting it, I checked out my glfxinfo, so DISPLAY=:1 glxinfo (Display :1 is the VNC)\nThe first output was:\nname of display: :1\nlibGL error: failed to load driver: swrast\nlibGL error: Try again with LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose for more details.\nError: couldn't find RGB GLX visual or fbconfig\nError: couldn't find RGB GLX visual or fbconfig\n\nI fixed this one by installing the nvidia-current package. I already knew for WebGL to run, I needed GLX version 1.3 at least. So I gave glxinfo another swing and that gave the following output:\nubuntu@ip-172-31-29-168:~$ DISPLAY=:1 glxinfo | grep version\nXlib:  extension \"NV-GLX\" missing on display \":1\".\nXlib:  extension \"NV-GLX\" missing on display \":1\".\nserver glx version string: 1.2\nclient glx version string: 1.4\nGLX version: 1.2\nOpenGL core profile version string: 1.3 Mesa 4.0.4\nOpenGL version string: 1.3 Mesa 4.0.4\n\nAs you can see the GLX version is not enough to run WebGL, I tried all the guides on this. None of them seem to raise the GLX version. You're probably asking, why WebGL, well I had this running on a Mac Mini server, which worked perfectly to create a nice 3D video. Not looking to edit the code, just looking to get it up in the Cloud. Also tried the windows server, but ran in a lot of issues with ffmpeg there so that's also not an option. Now thinking of getting a Mac OS cloud server, but still wondering what's going wrong here.\nSo my question: is it even possible to do this on my Amazon EC2 server? And if so, how?\nP.S. When I run chromium-browser from the command-line, this is my error:\nubuntu@ip-172-31-29-168:~/.vnc$ DISPLAY=:1 chromium-browser --enable-webgl\n[12243:12243:0307/155523:ERROR:gl_surface_glx.cc(413)] GLX 1.3 or later is required.\n[12243:12243:0307/155523:ERROR:gl_surface_x11.cc(58)] GLSurfaceGLX::InitializeOneOff failed.\n\n\nA: Running OpenGL applications inside a virtual machine is very likely not going to perform well. First of all, you cannot use hardware acceleration but have to fall back to a software renderer. This is what the first error message tells you:\nlibGL error: failed to load driver: swrast\n\nInstalling the Nvidia driver does not help as there is no Nvidia card available - hence the second error message. Using a software renderer is possible, but it will be very slow.\nSo the answer is: Yes, it might be possible to do what you want but unless there is dedicated hardware that plays nicely with VNC on the virtual host this will not be a nice experience.\n", "Q: Google Earth Is Not Working I am using ubuntu 12.04 lts and i want to install google earth so I went onto it's official site and downloaded the 64bit.deb package.

Simply look in the\n  left pane of the file manager for the partition you wish to mount and\n  click on it - it will be mounted and its contents will show up in the\n  main pane. Partitions show with their labels if labelled, or their\n  size if not.\nUnless you require your Windows partition - or a NTFS/FAT32 partition\n  for data shared with Windows - mounted every time you boot up for one\n  of the reasons given below, mounting from the file manager in this way\n  should suffice.\n\n\nA: \nAre there any particular problems associated with transferring files between Ubuntu and Windows (via Nautilus) or procedures that should be followed?\n\nNo, you wouldn't face any problems because of transferring files between Ubuntu and Windows partitions(via Nautilus).\nBut you can't be able to drop files to the Ubuntu root file system partition normally.You have to get superuser permission for that kind of oprations.\n", "Q: whenever i use sudo apt-get remove/install, reply is Error I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and whenever I use:\nsudo apt-get remove\nsudo apt-get install\n\nit replies: \ncp: failed to extend `/boot/initrd.img-3.5.0-47-generic.dpkg-bak': No space left on device\ndpkg: error processing initramfs-tools (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n initramfs-tools\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nIs this right?\nIs it installing/removing?\nThe reply for:\nsudo apt-get install -f \n\nis:\nReading package lists...

I thought then you only could boot grub/shim. That renames the Windows efi file to a backup name and renames Windows file to actually be grub/shim.\nTo undo & to rename files to their original names, you just need to tick the \"Restore EFI backups\" option of Boot-Repair.\nWith the renamed file you cannot directly boot Windows from UEFI menu as it really is shim.\nAnd a Windows update may rewrite the bootmgfw.efi file overwriting the shim version, so then if you can only boot the Windows version you have to rerun boot repair.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but one of the directories in which commands are stored in Ubuntu is /usr/bin. I tried viewing one of the ELF 64-bit LSB executable files (synergy) with nano but all I see is a mix of random symbols/letters. Can I view these files? If so, how do I go about it?\n\nA: The most files (if not all) from /usr/bin are binary executable files. Now, a binary file is a computer file that is not a text file; it may contain any type of data, encoded in binary form for computer storage and processing purposes (more about: Binary file). \nSo, if a binary file is not a text file, you can't use nano (or another text editor) to edit it (well, you can, but for sure you will not know what you are doing).\nIn Ubuntu (and Linux like operating systems in general) there are some applications called hexeditors, like GHex which can be used to view and edit files in two ways, hex or ascii:\n\nFurthermore, you can transform vim in a hexeditor by typing :%!xxd inside of it (:%!xxd -r to go back to normal mode).\n\nA: Files under /usr/bin that are not shell scripts are normally \"real\" executables, i.e. they contain machine code that is executed directly by the CPU (intermixed with some headers/structures used by the loader and dynamic linker to do their job)\nYou can open them with a hexadecimal editor, but normally you cannot do much with it; if you know about the ELF format the classic tool to check out properties of executables is objdump; objdump -x filename will print a lot of information about ELF headers, while the -d option will produce the disassembly of all the executable segments of the given executable. But again, either you are really expert and you are doing very specific things, or this is really useless. Executables are meant to be run by a computer, not read by a human.\nWhat is more interesting, if you are programmer, is to get the source code (i.e. the code actually written by a human and then compiled to a binary executable) of a program you have installed, to check it out, apply patches, modify it, ... If your sources.list is configured appropriately and the source package is available (this is normally the case for all the packages provided in repos from \"main\" to \"universe\"), you can get the sources using the command apt-get source name_of_the_package.\n", "Q: Installing Without Overwriting HDD I have an external hard drive, with a few partitions on it.\nBecause I have a bootable version of Ubuntu 12.04 on it, I have all of the standard Linux partitions on it, as well as one called Data (which contains other data that I want preserved). Today, I upgraded to Ubuntu 12.10, which seemed to have messed up my installation. Whenever I tried to boot Ubuntu, I got a black screen with a simple insertion cursor on the top left corner. After some searches, I found that this was an error with the GUI-portion of Ubuntu.\nUsing the terminal, I reinstalled ubuntu-desktop and unity, but I still am unable to access the desktop. I had planned to install 13.10 after 12.10 finished upgrading, so I decided to just get rid of my previous installation, and replace it with 13.10.\nI have a LiveUSB with (bootable) Ubuntu 13.10 on it, so I want to install that onto my hard drive. However, I don't want to lose my Data partition. \nIs this possible, and if so, how? I'm going to boot 13.10 off of my hard drive (once I install it on there), but I also have Windows 8.1 installed on my laptop.\nEdit: On the installer, one of the options is \"Upgrade Ubuntu 12.10 to Ubuntu 13.10\". will that preserve my data and my Windows installation?\n\nA: So if you go into the \"advanced\" section of the install, you should be able to pick which partitions you want to use. If all you want to preserve is in the Data partition, then you can simply choose to format your old 12.10 partition (I recommend this over upgrading).\nIf you want to check the format of your partitions before starting all of this so you can get an idea of which partitions you'd be choosing, you can install gparted from the terminal (using sudo apt-get install gparted) and then run it from terminal (using sudo gparted). Sadly the partitions are not named well to the average user, so you have to know which one is your ubuntu 12.10 one, but it'll help and you don't have to decide on the spot during installation.\n\nP.S. As a general rule, unless you don't mind accidentally wiping your whole hard drive, I would recommend not doing any of the default options in the installation guide and always going to advanced. It gives you much more control, especially if you have multiple operating systems installed. \n", "Q: How do I set up a Tor server?

When I try to boot I am greeted with code flying down the screen and the message: \"fixing recursive fault but reboot is needed\". Then a trace is ran until my system locks up.

I have even attempted using Gnome 3.10.  Nothing I have tried has worked.\nThe issue that I am experiencing is that, within Gnome Classic, I am unable to change the window borders.  Most GTK3 themes installed in ~/.themes/ work in the sense that I am able to change the GTK theme, but not the window borders (Border, Title bar, Close/Maximize/Minimize buttons)\nI was finally able to get Window Borders using the correct theme while using Gnome Fallback, however, Gnome Fallback does not seem to be an ideal solution for me (introduces many more issues, such as Keyboard Settings not having an affect on my session).\nDoes anybody have any suggestions on how to get a Gnome Classic session honoring both GTK and Window Borders of a theme?\n\nA: As it was explained to me, Gnome 3 is moving towards the ability to allow each window to style itself.  The idea behind this goal is that applications can really improve their user experience by having their own custom colors and things.\nFor this reason, some \"GTK3\" themes aren't really Gnome 3 ideal.  You will find that some of the GTK3 themes (such as those on Gnome Look) work, while others do not.\nIf you experience an issue such as this, you can place your older themes in ~/.local/share/themes.  If you do not have the Current Theme option on Gnome Tweak Tool, you can manually set the Window Border/Current Theme theme using the following command: \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme \"THEME_DIRECTORY_NAME_HERE\"\n\nI hope this clears some stuff up.\n", "Q: Where to find compiz profiles online to load into my ubuntu?

I dont know what exactly is the error but I'll try to describe what happened and hopefully you can help me further debug and solve the problem, im on xubuntu 13.10 64 bit.\n2 days ago, while trying to make php work, I chmod -R /var\nThat worked but sudo apt-get install x says that var/lib should have chmod 0700 or something like that so I did chmod 0700 /var/lib and chmod -R 0700 /var/lib. I don't remember the exact permission but I messed /var permissions that's for sure.\nAnyway I dont know whether that's a big deal or not.  I also messed something else up,  apt-get install tasksel, I didn't wait for it to finish installing, I remembered that I could install lamp without tasksel, so I abandoned installation ctrl-z.\nRight after ctrl-z, I got that red icon next to the clock saying that this error usually occurs when a package doesn't finish installing dependencies. I tried updating the packages didn't work.\nApt-get no longer works, I cannot install nor remove anything var is locked or something. It's the same error you get when you try to install something from terminal while synaptic package manager is opened.\nI tried restarting the pc thinking that some background process is running, now xubuntu doesn't work, it boots and everything I see the xubuntu blue screen loading but I dont see the login screen afterwards, just a black screen (not a tty).\nI tried reinstalling, but there's no (reinstall option) in the live cd, so I'd have to format the hard drive, I dont want to do that. I have so many stuff.\nIf I go to tty and fix the mess I made in var, would it fix it? If so then what are the different permissions for folders and files in var?\n\nA: A short intro into Unix file permissions:\nFile and folder permissions are represented as 4 octets. The 1st octet is for special permissions. The 2nd octet represents what the owning user of the file/folder can do (this is almost always 7). The 3rd octet represents what the owning group can do (usually 5). The 4th octet represents what everyone else can do.\nEach permission is represented by numbers. 4 is for reading, 2 is for writing, and 1 is for running/opening (running a script or opening a folder).\nThe first command that you ran couldn't have been chmod -R /var, because it doesn't specify the permission to set. If the permission that you chmod'd is indeed 0700, then that means only you have full (read and write) access to the folder; the system can't even peek inside the folder. I'm not sure how the first instance of apt-get worked, though.\nFixing the permissions should cause your system to fully boot (and likely restore apt-get). The solution I can think of (assuming you can't get to a tty) is to run a live session from the live CD and, on /var of your hard drive (not the live session), run:\nchmod -R 0755 /var\nchmod 0377 /var/crash\nchmod 0755 /var/log\nchmod 0777 /var/run\nchmod 0777 /var/lock\nchmod 2775 /var/local\nchmod 3777 /var/mail\nchmod 3777 /var/metrics\nchmod 1777 /var/tmp\n\nThis should get you back on the right path.\nAlso, I strongly recommend you don't change the permissions of system folders (basically,  anything outside of /home).\n", "Q: Initialize start-up applications in certain workspaces?

I would like to create NTFS partitions in the external HD preserving all data stored there.\nDoes anyone know if/how that is possible? I'm new at Linux...\nMany Thanks\n\nA: Yes, you can be able to create ntfs partitions on your external HDD.Just shrink the size of FAT filesystem and then create NTFS partitions from the free or unallocated space.\nIt would preserve the data inside your HDD.\n\nA: You can create new partitions, but if your intent is to convert from FAT to NTFS, I'm not aware of any tools that can do that. Also, NTFS is a poor choice of filesystem for use in Ubuntu (or any other Linux distribution); for Linux use, you should be using a Linux-native filesystem such as ext3fs, ext4fs, or XFS. NTFS is a tolerable choice for dual-boot scenarios, but it's got serious problems even then.

I defragmented both and also formatted D,which has capacity for 190 GB.\nThe Ubuntu installer doesn't detect my main OS (Windows 7).\nSo I continue with the Something Else option, but it still doesn't detect either of my Windows partitions\n\nSo instead of installing Ubuntu, I just try it, and when I open the media folder, the partitions are there:\n\nOS folder is C, while DATA folder is D.\nI don't want to make partitions again if there's another option, and I want to keep Win 7 also. Thanks.\nThis is the output of sudo fdisk -l:\n\n\nA: Chances are you've got one of two issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*A disk that uses motherboard-based software RAID (aka \"fake RAID\") and no appropriate software running in the Ubuntu installer; or leftover RAID data that's confusing the installer. You may be able to fix this problem by disabling RAID options in your firmware and/or typing sudo dmraid -Er /dev/sda in a Linux Terminal window. Note that this fix is risky; if the computer relies on RAID to boot and you remove the RAID data, you may no longer be able to boot.\n\n*A damaged partition table. Your disk uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT) so fdisk will be useless for repairing it. Instead, use gdisk; see the gdisk page on repairing partition table damage for more on this topic. If you need more advice on this, post back with some basic gdisk output, such as the output you see when you launch it, type p, and type v.\n\n", "Q: How to reload Nvidia driver, (Nvidia Optimus/multiscreen: How to restart optirun after hibernation/suspend) I use the following scripts to initialize multiscreen setup:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Initializes Nvidia Optimus for multi-screen functionality.\n\nsudo modprobe bbswitch\noptirun true\nintel-virtual-output\n\nBut when my machine suspends, it goes back to a single screen.

It will prompt you if you want to install such packages. \n", "Q: How to print the directory tree in terminal What is the command that can be used to draw the directory tree inside the terminal emulator?\n\n\nA: You can do it easily with the following command:\nfind . -type d | sed -e \"s/[^-][^\\/]*\\//  |/g\" -e \"s/|\\([^ ]\\)/| - \\1/\"\n\nThis command will search recursively for directories inside the parent directory, and then draw the tree of the directories found.\nYou may also try the following to include all of the files as well.\nfind | sed 's|[^/]*/|- |g'\n\n\nA: You can use tree to print the directory tree in terminal. Install tree from terminal,\nsudo apt-get install tree\n\nTo see the directory tree, use\ntree /path/to/folder\n\nOr navigate to a directory and just use\ntree\n\nIt has some advanced options too. You can see owner's username, groupname, date of last modification of a file/folder and so on using tree. It supports directory colors of ls so you can see colourized outputs. \nSee man tree for more.\n\nA: There is a program called tree which lists directory content in a tree structure.\nI think it's in the repositories (or even installed)\nsudo apt install tree\n\ntree -d /path/to/directory\n\nCheck this link for more.\n", "Q: how do i share my mobile internet connection via wifi in ubuntu 12.04 Newbie here.

I do something like the following\ncd\nmkdir test\nmkdir other\ncd test\nln -s ../other/\n# So ~/test contains a symlink to ~/other\ncd other\ndirname `pwd`\n# So far so good; prints /home/user/test\nls ..\n# Prints the contents of /home/user (???)\ncd ..\n# Now we're back in /home/user/test\n\nSo the parent of the current working directory and .. refer to two different locations in the context of ls (and also cp), but not cd.\nI have observed this problem for all symlinks on my system, both existing and new (like the example above), and on multiple filesystems. The same thing happens in nautilus, which now shows the breadcrumbs of the physical path of any symlink I click, instead of the relative path. To my knowledge, I did not change anything that would cause an error like this, and booting an old kernel did not appear to fix the problem. I have seen many posts desiring this behavior, but none correcting it.\nAny thoughts on this issue would be greatly appreciated. I am running Ubuntu Linux 12.10 3.11.0-18-generic.\n\nA: Your shell remembers when you cd into a directory via a symlink and uses that information when you cd ... If you use bash or zsh you can execute the command set -P in order  to make cd behave the same as cp (i.e., make it ignore symbolic links so that  in your example cd .. would take you to /home/user, not /home/user/test).\nRefer to this Unix & Linux SE question for more information including a hack to make cp behave like cd instead of the opposite.\n", "Q: the Android libraries to Ubuntu system Hello How can I add the Android libraries to Ubuntu system, in order to run Android applications without the use of the emulator\n\nA: I guess this link will answer your question.\nStill you are not clear about your question.\n\nDo you want to run android application in your Ubuntu PC?\n\nIf yes, then you have to compile application for x86 to run on your PC instead of cross compiling it for android device.\nAnd about compiling application without SDK you can use NDK by writing android makefile.\n", "Q: GNOME Input Source switching - I can only switch once using shortcuts? I have GNOME installed on Ubuntu 13.10, and I enables several input methods (Japanese Anthy, Korean Hangeul and Chinese Pinyin) in addition to my English (US) keyboard. I set the shortcut to Ctrl+Space, then Super+Space, then Alt+Shift and multiple other combinations, however, whenever I use these shortcuts to attempt to cycle through my input methods, it only goes to the next one and stops.\nFor example, if I Ctrl+Space from English (US) to Japanese (Anthy), I cannot press Ctrl+Space to change further. I am stuck at Japanese (Anthy) until I let go of Ctrl+Space and repeat. However, clicking on the input method icon and changing still works for all input methods.\nDoes anyone know what the problem might be? To clarify again, I am using GNOME's input sources from System Settings.\nUPDATE: The latest system updates have solved this problem.\nUPDATE2: I have checked and realized that the problem exists in GNOME but not in GNOME Classic.\nUPDATE2B: After further experimentation, I have found that the problem sometimes exists and sometimes doesn't exist, and doesn't depend on whether it is in GNOME or GNOME Classic. Logging out and in usually solves the problem.\n\nA: Have you tried reassigning the same shortcut for Previous Source, in an attempt to blank it?\nI remembered seeing this problem a few days ago as well, on a 13.10 fresh installation. Didn't have the keyboard option when I installed over a freshly formatted partition.\nLater on, I reinstalled Ubuntu entirely due to another unrelated problem, and this time, I was given the option to set my keyboard. Did so, and the shortcut problem was gone.\nLooking back upon this, you might want to try reconfiguring your keyboard settings.\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\n", "Q: Xfreerdp Upgrade to version 1.1 to support Multi Monitor I was trying to use freerdp with support for multiple monitor using ubuntu 13.10 x64 and I get error :\nroot@rdp-client:~# xfreerdp /multimon /f /u:a /p:1 /v:192.168.0.140:3389\ntransport_connect: getaddrinfo (Name or service not known)\nError:protocol security negotition failure\n\nmy version of freerdp 1.0.2 \nHow can I upgrade to xfreerdp version 1.1 to support this syntax of command and multi monitor?\n\nA: FreeRDP has been above version 1.1 since Vivid - so the easiest way to get a compatible version is now to just install a recent version of Ubuntu. That said, Windows still imposes restrictions on which editions support multi monitor on the server.\nThere are no versions of Windows that support multimon on a Home edition server (the computer you're connecting to).\nWindows 7 only supports it on Ultimate and Enterprise editions and not Pro.\nWindows 8 and 10 support it on Pro and Enterprise editions (and there is no Ultimate edition).\nOld answer preserved below.\n\nThe easiest means of getting a version of FreeRDP that supports multimon seems to be via this PPA :\nhttps://launchpad.net/~9v-shaun-42/+archive/freerdp\n(the usual warnings about using a PPA for software apply).\nThat said... I tried this and still no joy. Why?\nI'm running Windows 7 Professional on the server machine I want to use. Which doesn't support multimon as a server, just as a client. So FreeRDP enters span mode anyway, which is not what I need because my monitors have different vertical resolutions.\nThis is by design, apparently. Multimon RDP service is only supported by Windows 7 Ultimate or Enterprise, even if the RDP client on other editions supports using it.

I tried switching the driver inside the Software & Updates screen, but no matter which selection I made, the result was the same.  Steam wouldn't run.\nI followed instructions I found on the internet and ran the following:\n\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update sudo\napt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nAll completed without error.  Upon rebooting, Ubuntu displays an error message pop-up window.  There are a few options, but no matter what I pick, nothing seems to happen.  One option is to continue in low-res mode, but if I select it, nothing happens.  It also says I can revert to an old configuration, but when I select that option, it brings me to the same screen.  It doesn't seem to actually do anything.\nI'm able to get online using the Ubuntu install USB...but I'm afraid I'm in over my head.  I don't want to reinstall because I've spent a good ~10 hours or so getting things to work, I don't care if I can't run Steam games.\nCan anyone help me revert back the video card driver?\n\nA: Start in safe graphical mode:\nTo start Ubuntu into safe mode (Recovery Mode) hold down the left Shift key as the computer starts to boot. If holding the Shift key doesn't display the menu press the Esc key repeatedly to display the GRUB 2 menu.  From there you can choose the recovery option.\n\nReference: here\n", "Q: Gksu Naulitus is not working I am using ubuntu 12.04. I wanted to change permissions of a file so i typed gksu naulitus. it asked my password andstl i entered it and nothing happened. What should I do?\n\nA: In your post title and text you write \"naulitus\", which is a typo, it should be \"nautilus\" (replace the \"l\" and \"t\").\nWhen you run gksu nonexistentcommand or sudo nonexistentcommand, the system still asks your password and print an error message after. If you launched gksu nonexistent from a terminal you would see this error message, if you launch by other means then you might not see an error message, just nothing would happen, like you described.\nIt might be easier and safer to do change the permissions of a file using the sudo chmod and sudo chown commands in a terminal, for example:\n# make a file readable\nsudo chmod +r /path/to/file\n# make a file executable\nsudo chmod +x /path/to/file\n\nIf you use gksu nautilus, then after you changed the permission, you might forget to close the nautilus window with superuser permissions open, and you might accidentally do something dangerous in it.\n\nA: To change permission of a file, try it on command line.gksu nautilus allows you to open nautilus using superuser permissions.\nChanging permission of a file via terminal,\nsudo chmod +x /path/filename\n\nAbove command will give execute permission to that file.See here about file permissions.\n", "Q: should I move /bin and /lib folders that's inside a program to /usr/local/? I've downloaded IntelliJ idea IDE from their website. I've putted it inside /usr/local/bin and then configured my PATH var and the program work correctly. the program folder has these two folders inside it, bin and lib. I know that if I moved their content to my /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/ the program will work. However, it will be a problem to remove it later because I won't be able to distinguish its files from what was already there inside /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/. I know that software centre doesn’t keep them in folders but it sprat them to /usr/bin, /usr/lib and other folders.\nSo my question is in what way should I organize these type of programs ?\n\nA: Don't fix what ain't broken.

How can I start the graphics?\nAlso, once I've got the screen working, can I reduce the window size (it doesn't all fit on one desktop)?\n\nA: First of all, currently, the Ubuntu Touch Emulator is only available for Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr and because of this sudo apt-get install ubuntu-emulator command will work only if you have already upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 which make the question off-topic at the moment. \nAnyway, I will try an answer. One of the minimal requirements for the emulator is that the graphics card to has OpenGL support. To test if your graphics card has OpenGL support or not, you can use the glxinfo command as follow:\nglxinfo | grep render\n\nYou will understand from the output if your graphics card has OpenGL support or not.\nNote: mesa-utils package must to be installed in order to use glxinfo.\nAnother two things from the minimal requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*512MB of RAM dedicated for the emulator\n\n*4GB of disk space\n\n\nNow, if these minimal requirements are met, I'm sure that you can start using Ubuntu Touch emulator with success. Just wait some (maybe several) minutes to come up the graphics.\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*EXPERIMENTAL UBUNTU TOUCH EMULATOR RELEASED\n\n*Getting the emulator\n\nA: If you use an NVIDIA graphics card ?\nCheck if you are running the X.Org X Server Nouveau display driver.\nIf so, install the proprietary NVIDIA driver from \"Software & Updates\" an reboot the machine.

I have a directory containing bunch of .txt files , I need a command to rename these files by one command ,  so their name will be : file1.txt , file2.txt, file3.txt , etc .\nAny Help ?\n\nA: You can use the rename command, which is usually included in a default installation:\nc=0 rename 's/.*/sprintf(\"file%05d.txt\", ++$ENV{c})/e' *\n\nUse the -n flag if you want to do a test first:\nc=0 rename -n 's/.*/sprintf(\"file%05d.txt\", ++$ENV{c})/e' *\n\nThe way this works is, for each argument, it executes the perl s/// expression, and performs the rename from the original to the replaced string. In the replacement string I use sprintf to format the name, where I use the environment variable c as the counter from 1.\nIn most cases you also may need leading \"0\" for each number, %05d does the trick, where 5 is number of digits.\n\nA: You can use this in terminal to rename files as you wished,\nj=1;for i in *.txt; do mv \"$i\" file\"$j\".txt; let j=j+1;done\n\nIt will do the job.\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set a counter j, initially set it to 1\n\n*Initiate a for loop and use a shell glob *.txt to obtain all txt files.\n\n*for each file rename it using mv and increase the counter by 1.\n\n\nA: The following command will also rename files incrementally :\ncd (directory containing files )\n\nThen run this script :\ncount=1\nfor i in *; do\n    mv \"${i}\" file${count}.`echo \"${i}\" | awk -F.
