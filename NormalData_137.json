["Q: VPN not setting all DNS nameservers I have searched for a solution to my problem but I just get people who have issues who can't resolve any of their workplace names.\nMy issue is I can't resolve ONE of my workplace servers. I have the VPN setup through Network Manager and everything seems just fine. I can connect to most of the machines and servers at work. Anything that is company.local or company.localnet resolves fine. \nHowever for some reason my company has an additional nameserver company.test setup. When I am connecting to the VPN through my Mac (trying to get rid of it) it sets up the DNS fine. It uses the same nameservers as everything else.\nBut when my Ubuntu connects I can not resolve company.test and I don't know how to add it manually or configure Ubuntu to find it.\nI have added company.test to the VPNs \"additional search domains\" but no avail.\nHow can I manually add a single DNS entry to a VPN connection or how can I configure Ubuntu to pick up this company.test search domain.\nThanks\nCorey\n\nA: You have two options. \nFirst, add the DNS entry to the VPN connection. When you setup the connection (sorry but there are about 100 ways to do this) look for a place to put DNS entries, name servers, or the like, and enter the IP of the DNS server for the company.test domain. If all else fails you can add the IP for the DNS server to /etc/resolv.conf (after the DNS connection is running).\nOr, if your just trying to find a single machine at say puter.company.test then you can just add that line to /etc/hosts\nit should look something like\n10.10.10.10 puter.company.test\n", "Q: How to make Guest save theme changes on log-out/shut-down/restart? Ubuntu 12.04\nAt the moment I'm trying to recover my password on my only account, (but it auto-logs in) so I use the Guest when the computer logs-out/sleeps on my administrator account. So I change the background etc., when I use the guest session again all my changes are deleted.\nSo how do I make these changes permanent?\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: You can not. I'm sure there's a way, if you find the script that cleans everything up. But the guest account is supposed to be cleaned after every logout. It's the very definition of the Guest account. \nYou can change the settings that it starts with.

I installed Windows on the first SSD through the UEFI, and it works fine, I've been using it for a couple of weeks now. When I enter the UEFI setting, however, it did not give me the option to set the second SSD as the boot device, even in advanced mode. I instead booted into the live CD (which worked with no problems) and installed ubuntu to the second SSD from there (which also seemed to work with no problems). \nThe problem is, now I can't figure out how to boot into Ubuntu, only Windows. The UEFI still only lets me choose the Windows SSD or the DVD drive to boot from, and neither Grub nor the Windows bootloader appears when I turn on the machine. Do I need to set the device for boot loader installation to be my Windows drive?\nDoes anyone who has set up a similar system know what might be causing this? Any help is appreciated.\nEDIT: I used EasyBCD to add my \"/boot\" partition to the Windows bootloader, and now it gives me the option to boot to ubuntu--but when I try, it just gives me the Grub rescue prompt without actually loading the kernel.\nEDIT2: I followed the procedure in the first section of the UEFI Community Documentation. I ran the boot-repair twice, and now I get the Grub menu on booting--but when I choose any \"Ubuntu\" option, all I get is a blinking underscore. No prompt or anything, just a black screen with a white underscore. I tried entering several commands, but nothing produced any feedback.\n\nA: I have several operating systems on my laptop which has three hard drives (Windows 8 on HDD1, Ubuntu LTS and Fedora on HDD2, latest version of Ubuntu on HDD3/SSD). They all have independent EFI System Partitions (ESP).\nAdd missing UEFI NVRAM entry\nGiven that your Ubuntu installation has a working installation of grub-efi (that is if boot-repair didn't overwrite it with something else, or there was no grub-efi to begin with, or no ESP on the Ubuntu SSD), you could add the Ubuntu bootmenu entry to UEFI NVRAM with the following command:\nsudo efibootmgr --create --disk /dev/sdc --part 1 --label \"Ubuntu\" --loader \\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\grubx64.efi\n\nNote that sdc is my third hard drive and --part 1 my ESP in this example. If your Ubuntu SSD is the second drive in your computer and you have to create the probably missing ESP (e.g. if just have a root / and swap partition on the Ubuntu SSD) your parameters would be sdb and --part 3.\nReinstall grub-efi to ESP and root filesystem\nTo reinstall grub-efi you could boot the live media in UEFI mode, mount the Ubuntu root filesystem on the SSD and the ESP respectively within that mountpoint (e.g. $mountpoint_of_external_root_filesystem/boot/efi) and run the following command:\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory $mountpoint_of_external_root_filesystem/boot/efi /dev/sdc\n\nAgain, sdc is my third hard drive, replace it as well as the path to the mountpoint of the ESP correspondingly. Run efibootmgr afterwards and check if you have a ubuntu entry, if not run the efibootmgr command from above and check again.\nUbuntu for some reason doesn't ship a default UEFI bootloader, which could get you in trouble if the NVRAM entry is missing (e.g. after a firmware update, formerly called BIOS update). You could copy EFI/ubuntu on the ESP to EFI/BOOT and make a copy of grubx64.efi or shimx64.efi named BOOTX64.EFI or install gummiboot (see related) to have a fallback.\nRelated questions and answers\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I remove \"Ubuntu\" in the bios boot menu?

Follow the procedure of the 1st paragraph of the UEFI Community Documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n\nA: This fixed it for me:\nMy initial setup had the efi mode Ubuntu ahead of the non-efi Windows 7 and it would boot into Ubuntu fine, but not into Windows 7.\nSince switching the order I've been able to boot into each flawlessly.\n", "Q: Where to install Ubuntu bootloader on a Mac? I'm trying to install Ubuntu on a Mac, but I can't get it to boot with default mac bootloader or rEFI. It shows up as \"Windows\" On the mac bootloader and shows up as \"Linux\" on rEFI.\nI'm not sure where should I install the bootloader to during installation.\nHere's my partition table:\nsda : Hard drive manufacturer name\n\nsda0: Mac partition\n\nsda1:\n\n ...\n\nsda4: SWAP\n\nsda5: Ubuntu\n\nAnd I have installed the bootloader on sda5. Should I install it on sda instead? I'm afraid this will replace the default Mac OS X bootloader and I won't be able to go into the Mac side again.\nAny help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\nA: Fist make sure your in BIOS mode. There is no good way to tell this, but if your in the Ubuntu Live CD Your probably in BIOS emulation mode. Specially if your using ReFiT.\nNext install on /dev/sda. This will not hurt your mac booting because it boots via EFI (which is a file in one of those partitions). \nThen Refit should sow you a Linux partition, and you can use that to boot. The mac boot loader doesn't understand Linux and will always call it \"Windows\". In addition it may not start in BIOS mode (which will make a lot of things not work). Your best is to use ReFit and install on /dev/sda\nOne other thing. Make sure your two partition tables are in sync. This can be done from refit.\n\nA: If you don't have Windows installed, IMHO it's better to boot Linux in EFI mode than in BIOS mode, if at all possible (and it usually is). This is done by installing an EFI boot loader on the EFI System Partition (ESP), and usually supplementing it with rEFIt or rEFInd. If you're using a 3.3.0 or later kernel, rEFInd can boot those kernels directly, without the use of GRUB or any other boot loader. See the rEFInd documentation and my Web page on EFI-mode Linux installations on Macs for more details -- but be aware that the latter page hasn't been updated for Ubuntu 12.10, and some details are actually simpler with 12.10.\n", "Q: Can I make Ubuntu server connect to wifi and create an Access point from the same wlan0 interface?

What i have googled so far wasn't really helpful as it has to do with bridging from eth0 to wlan0.\n\nA: No, you need two networks for this. Wi-Fi is EITHER in AP or Ad-Hoc modes not both.\nIf your neighbour is allowing you to connect to his Wi-Fi, just connect all of the PC's to it. If they don't know what you are doing, I strongly suggest that you don't do it! It may well be illegal depending on what country you are in.\nWhen bridging, you need two connections not one. You could bridge a wired and wireless or two wireless connections.\n", "Q: DIALux alternative for linux? I'm wondering if an alternative for DIALux lighting simulation software exists?

I want to install Ubuntu on it. So far the solutions say to disable secure boot. However, when I go to the boot options, I am unable to change it.\n\n\n*\n\n*When the boot option is \"UEFI\", Secure Boot is enabled, and I cannot go down to change it.\n\n*When I change the boot option to \"Legacy BIOS\", when the computer restarts, it is unable to even detect Windows 8.\nIs it possible to install Ubuntu on this computer?\n\nA: First, Microsoft's certification program requires that users must be able to disable Secure Boot on x86/x86-64 computers that bear a Windows 8 logo. Thus, there almost certainly is a way to do it. Unfortunately, there's no standardization in user interfaces on this matter, so you might need to dig deeper or call tech support to find out how to do it. If you have to call tech support, be sure to complain, and follow up with a letter.\nSecond, Ubuntu 12.10 ships with Secure Boot support, so it's theoretically possible to install it on a computer that uses Secure Boot even without disabling that feature. I say \"theoretically\" because this support is very new, and some people seem to have problems with it. Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't provide Secure Boot support, so getting it to install with Secure Boot active is much harder. (It's not impossible, but it's so hard that it's not practical for anything but experts.)\n\nA: *\n\n*Enable UEFI in your BIOS\n\n*Follow the 1st paragraph of the UEFI Community Documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n", "Q: What can I do when Ubuntu 12.10 begins to work slow? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I improve overall system performance? \n\nAs stated in the title, I want to know how can I repair my existing OS, Ubuntu 12.10.\nIt seems to be very slow, earlier I installed it along side Windows XP (32-Bit) at that time it was working fine.

The use case is this: I have two USB hard drives. Suppose one lives off-site, and another I keep at my desk.

That is to say, if I create ~/foo.txt, then backup to hard drive #1, and then backup to hard drive #2, will backup #2 have the file, or will DejaDup decide it already backed up that file and doesn't need to again?\nIn other words, is it safe to change the backup destination in DejaDup as a means of backing up to multiple places?\n\nA: Yes, backup #2 will have the file and things will work like you expect.\nHowever!  Note that Deja Dup uniquely identifies the USB drive by filesystem ID so you can't \"trick\" it in some fashion by merely swapping disks.  You will actually have to change your backup location in your system settings to switch which disk Deja Dup uses.\n", "Q: How do I fix dead Synaptics ClickPad on Ubuntu 12.10 + Toshiba P850?

I verified the O/S recognized my touchpad by going to a terminal and entering the xinput command - the list includes SynPS/2 Synaptics Touchpad.  I tried to watch the pointer variables by typing synclient -m 100 but nothing was happening.\nI felt there was a hardware lock on the touchpad, but I couldn't figure out how to disable it.  My laptop has no switches on it, and the fn-f5 combination wasn't doing anything in ubuntu.  \nTo fix, I booted a Windows install stick and noticed that my touchpad was still unresponsive.  Still in the first screen of Windows setup I hit fn-f5 and then the pointer became responsive.  Quit Windows, and reboot into Ubuntu and my pointer still works (gestures and all).\n", "Q: I seem to be locked out of my account \nPossible Duplicate:\nCannot get past login screen \n\nI keep trying to log in on start up, typing my password and pressing enter. But it doesn't go through. I just get kicked back to the login screen. I know I don't have the password wrong. Have I done something to lock myself out?\nI was messing around with Macchanger before this happened. Just wlan0. nothing else. Used sudo a couple of times. Did nothing as root.\n\nA: Keep Shift pressed when GRUB runs. It should bring you to the GRUB menu.\nThere you can choose to edit default boot option. Append ' single' (without quotes) to the end of the kernel prompt and choose to continue.\nThe system should boot into root shell. If your username is 'username' (without quotes), you can change password to the one you know and reboot into normal session:\n# passwd username\nEnter password:\nConfirm password:\n# reboot\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem recently. I found out that one of the files in my profile was owned by root instead of my user.\nAs mentioned in the other comments, get to a command line and check the ownership of the files, especially ~/.Xauthority, they should be owned by your user.\nIf not, take ownership with:\n    sudo chown : ~/.Xauthority\nWhere <user> is your user id.\n", "Q: How to completely remove application If I remove any application with sudo apt-get remove <applicationName>, the application is removed and then I can remove the repository later on.\nI have noticed that certain cached and config files remain in the system.

It is hard to find and delete the remaining manually, as I am often not certain whether to delete them or not.\nIs there any way to delete an application including the config and cache files along with the application?\n\nA: If you mean to remove all configuration files and all after uninstalling your software then you can use Ubuntu tweak. It is a very useful tool to do lots of things in Ubuntu, especially cleaning all unnecessary things.\nThe software is not in the official repo. of Ubuntu, but you can install it very easily using ppa. To install the software use the following commands\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nHope this information will be helpful to you.\n\nA: Using sudo apt-get purge <package-name> will remove <package-name> and all of it's config file that are not located in \"Home\" (~).   \nYou will have to remove config files in your home directory manually.  Since these files are hidden you will have to press Ctrl + H to view them in Nautilus.\nA good reference to look at:  What is the correct way to completely remove an application?\n\nA: To uninstall using GUI\njust open Ubuntu Software Center. \nOnce you open it go to installed\nfind your software by searching in the top right corner\nthen click remove\nIt will uninstall everything\n", "Q: moved ubuntu folder from C: to D: drive how to correct UUID entries I had a previous Ubuntu 11.10 installation which was done using Wubi in\nD: drive of my computer.

See this url for the latest kernel.\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu need to update its kernel so often? What are the advantages for updating so often? \n\nA: Here is a list why packages (so including the kernel) got updated: https://www.ubuntuupdates.org/\n\n\n*\n\n*Version: 3.5.0-22.34  2013-01-08 23:19:18 UTC\n\n*Version: 3.5.0-22.33  2013-01-02 23:08:48 UTC\n\n*Version: 3.5.0-21.32  2012-12-11 21:08:43 UTC\n\n*Version: 3.5.0-20.31  2012-12-05 15:08:46 UTC\n\n*Version: 3.5.0-19.30  2012-11-13 19:08:30 UTC\n\n\nAll include a long list of fixes so the best answer to me seems: those kernel bug fixers have been doing a lot of work so there have been more moments to offer a kernel upgrade.\nIt might have something to do with the kenelversion 3.5.0. This was a big update so it will include a bit more bugs where some might be easy to fix.\n\nA: The main reason is to provide fixes to security flaws that get discovered, fix stability bugs, and provide updated hardware support.\nSome notes about kernel updates:\n\n\n*\n\n*Because the running kernel is kept loaded in memory, it possible to keep working indefinitely without rebooting after a kernel update. This will continue running the old kernel. Of course, you will then remain vulnerable to any security issues fixed in the update until you reboot. If you are just using a low-security workstation and you're in the middle of something, that risk may be acceptable. Consider reading the changelog for the update to see whether it contains security fixes for flaws that may affect you.\n\n*Ksplice is a kernel extension that allows the running kernel to be updated in memory, without rebooting. This is useful for servers for which downtime (disruptions when rebooting) is costly.\n\nA: Kernel updates tend to add new features and drivers as well as fixing problems on the old one's and a few bug fixes along the way...  It's beneficial to update your kernel although you dont HAVE to...\n\nA: Frequent updates may not always be an advantage but as far as security goes, it is. If some kind of weakness is found in the kernel it could potentially be used to compromise the system until it is fixed. So it's best if as little time as possible passes from the discovery of a security hole until it's been fixed. There's really no reason to wait and leave an open security hole while there's a perfectly good fix available.\nIt's good to always have the latest kernel. Even if there's no security problem, an update might fix a bug or improve stability. And of course, new features are nice.\n\nA: All code has bugs. So does linux kernel code. Kernel updates fix kernel bugs early, before there is a zero-day exploit.\nIf you update, you are a moving target for an attacker. If you update on time, you move faster than any anyone can point. This makes you more or less safe from viruses and trojans.\n", "Q: Jenkins polling for Ubuntu Kernel upgrades? Say I wanted to distribute a binary kernel module for a custom in-house piece of hardware to users inside my company.  The ideal situation is that it requires no compilation on the part of the user.  I just want to use the standard apt-get/software update GUI tools to distribute it to our users.\nFor our purposes here, we'll assume that I have a Jenkins instance set up to build said kernel module, package it into a .deb archive and add it to an in-house APT repo.\nThis situation works, however I have to manually monitor when new Kernels are released for the different versions of Ubuntu and kick off each new kernel build manually.  \nWhat I'd like to find is a way for Jenkins to automatically poll for kernel updates in the Jenkins APT repo and kick off a new build of the driver for the new kernel.  Has anyone done anything similar before?  How did you go about doing it?\n\nA: Sounds like something a relatively simple script could do, similar to how you'ld trigger builds in a git post-receive hook for instance. In pseudocode:\nsudo apt-get update\nkversion=$(apt-cache policy kernel | sed .....)\nif [ our module not yet available for this kernel ]; then\n    wget http://jenkins/url_to_trigger_parametrized_build\nfi\n\n", "Q: How do I install the manpage from node.js' source tarball?

The screen would turn black with no backlight on whatsoever. But sounds could be heard no problem. \nSearching on google for solutions, I was unable to fix it.\nHowever,I tried plugging an external monitor to the laptop, via VGA, and it worked well. I could, and still can, see the OS running perfectly through the monitor but not through the laptop screen. Still, even if I unplug the monitor, the laptop screen will not display Ubuntu.\nI would like to have my laptop screen display the OS at once and any help is appreciated. Thanks. (:\n\nA: I am actually very new at this too. My first day ever with Ubuntu and I have the same problem. I also posted it as a question but got no replies. \nI however was trying the whole night to fix it somehow and what I did was first completely format the external drive. Then I ran the live cd again and clicked the install button. At the next step i chose the option LMV (Some disk management option). It installed and then when it was over, the system asked me to remove the disc so i did. But what i found out was, it never works when you restart the computer. I shut it down completely and then I heard a click sound at the end originating from the HDD. Then i started again and this time it booted normally.\nI guess maybe when you shut down, the header of the HDD returns to NULL position and maybe that plays a part. I tried it 3 times consecutively and each time it booted normally. \nI am not sure if this is the solution but as of now it is working for me.But as I said, I have only 1 day experience.\nJust try this, it might work and keep me posted.\nAll the best !!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS drains my Samsung Series 9 900X3C ultrabook's battery extremely fast.

My Samsung Series 9 900X3C ultrabook's battery is in the deep red around barely three hours after disconnecting it from the power - and during most of that time the screen wasn't even on. No heavy lifting, no video playback, nothing. Just a browser with static sites was open.\n\nA: Check the power consumption by your laptop using powertop and use TLP to fine tune it.\nCheck out below link how to use the utility:\nhttp://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-linux-advanced-power-management.html\nThis tool greatly helped me to reduce power consumption of my laptop. \n\nA: Look into a tool called powertop, it should be in your repository. (sudo apt-get install powertop). It'll tell you all kinds of goodness, like what's using your power from apps to the fan.\nAlso, if you have discrete graphics, such as Nvidia Optimus, could it be that the video card is powered up even when you're not using it? If so, try using Bumblebee (in your repo, again apt-get) to control when it's on and off. Or if you don't use discrete graphics, you can probably just turn it off entirely in the BIOS.\nEDIT: Looks like there's a documented bug in Ubuntu/Linux/the driver. See these related questions too:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel HD audio codec power management\n\n*Sound system is eating away the battery\n\n*100.0% usage by Audio codec hwC0D0: Realtek\nFrom that, it looks like you need to power down that audio output that's churning away. I'm not sure how, but I would go through that and experiment how. I found those questions and the bug, BTW, for searching \"audio codec hwc0d0 powertop\" - similar searches might be productive, as well as the discussion on that bug report.\n", "Q: Problems with nVidia gt640 on a desktop I'm currently running Ubuntu 12.10 on a desktop with a nVidia GT 640 that is giving me alot of problems. Everytime I boot, I get a mouse cursor over a blank black screen. \nBooting using nomodeset gives me full resolution on only one of the monitors, but only over a reduced screen area (it's really weird). I've narrowed it down to the fact that merely setting acpi=off in GRUB will enable this.\nThe strangest part is that I can get it to work. If I totally reinstall the mesa package using sudo apt-get --reinstall install libgl1-mesa-glx and use the default driver (the open source one) then I get a boot where both monitors are recognized at full resolution, no problem. However, once I restart, the same error happens. \nIs there a way I can get these monitors to be recognized on the first try, no problem? Thanks.\np.s.

Trying proprietary 310 Nvidia driver wasn't helping since it makes my desktop dramatically loosing performance.\nThen, I thought about switching to the pre-build of Ubuntu 13.04 (got the .iso from here: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/). So I burnt it and made a fresh install.\nThe first impression was good, the desktop behaviour with the open-source driver was quite much better than using it with Ubuntu 12.10. \nI decided to try out Steam for Linux. The in-game behaviour was still lacking a lot (Tried TF2). Then I've went to the Ubuntu Software Center application and installed the proprietary, tested 310 Nvidia driver.\nOnce I restarted the system, everything went Ok for me! Good screen resolution, good desktop behaviour, and surprise! Steam for Linux In-game behaviour quite NICE! playing TF2 with my profile recommended configuration happily! :D \nI recommend to give Ubuntu 13.04 the chance!

How do I install a man page file system-wide?\nFor example, if I have a man page file examplecommand.1, how do I install it so that I can just type man examplecommand to view it?\n\nA: *\n\n*First, find out which section your man page belongs to. If its a command, it probably belongs to section 1. You can read the manpage for the man command  to see a description of the different sections and their corresponding numbers.\n\n\n*Copy your man page to /usr/local/share/man/man1/ (change 1 to your section number if need be). You can also install it to /usr/share/man/man1/, but it's best practice to use the /usr/local/ directory for files that are installed without using the APT package manager. You can also optionally symlink over the file instead of copying it if you want:\n# First, ensure your local man page directory exists for your section of\n# interest (section 1 in this case, so the `man1` dir)\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man1\n\n# Option 1: **copy** over the man page to section 1\nsudo cp examplecommand.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/\n\n# Option 2: **symlink** over the man page to section 1. \n# NB: This cmd assumes you are already cd'ed into the dir in\n# which \"examplecommand.1\" is found, prior to running this cmd.\nsudo ln -si \"$PWD/examplecommand.1\" /usr/local/share/man/man1/\n\n\n\n*Run the mandb command. This will update man's internal database:\nsudo mandb\n\n\n\n*That's it! You should be able to view the man page by running:\nman 1 examplecommand\n\n\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*The manpage for the man command \n\n*The manpage for the mandb command \n\n*The source code in /usr/bin/dh_installman if you can read Perl, installed with the debhelper package.\n\n\nA: For an application binary that was copied to ~/.local/bin, copying its .1 man file to ~/.local/share/man/man1 worked for me on Ubuntu 18.04. I had to create the latter directory. I can now access the man page using man <app_name>.\n\nA: The answer by @ntc2 above is the one people should be looking at. I wanted to add some extra commentary which didn't fit in the comments section:\nThe approach by @ntc2 provides a path for people only needing to set their PATH (which they already expect) for local binaries.\nHowever, I don't think the generic mapping <path>/bin -> <path>/share/man exists for all paths in $PATH. It seems like this specific mapping is avoided when the $PATH in question is $HOME/bin. When performing strace(1) on man with MANPATH=:/nonexistingdir, I see the following lookups:\nFor any element in $PATH that's not $HOME/bin\n\n\n*\n\n*<path>/bin -> <path>/man\n\n*<path>/bin -> <path>/bin/man\n\n*<path>/bin -> <path>/share/man\n\n*<path>/bin -> <path>/bin/share/man\nFor $HOME/bin\n\n\n*\n\n*$HOME/bin -> $HOME/man\nI have no idea why it skips the others. This is on a Debian Buster system. It may be different on other systems.\nFor me, this means that the safest path to install man-pages is <path>/man, as it's guaranteed to be found if it's in the $PATH.\n\nA: If you only need to install the man page locally :\nIf MANPATH is unset, or includes an empty component (i.e. starts with :, ends with :, or contains ::), then <path>/share/man will automatically be searched for man pages whenever <path>/bin is part of PATH, for all values of <path>.\nThis provides a very simple way to add man pages for locally installed software. There are some details in man manpath and /etc/manpath.config, but I don't see any mention of the generic mapping from <path>/bin to <path>/share/man.\n", "Q: How can I execute scripts as root without pointing to its location? I tend to use sudo arp-scan --localnet --interface wlan0 a lot, but I find it cumbersome to type this each time. To speed things up, I've created a script, called arp-lw-scan, which should do this for me.\nContents of ~/Scripts/arp-lw-scan:\n#!/bin/bash\narp-scan --localnet --interface wlan0\n\nI've added ~/Scripts to my $PATH in ~/.profile, so each script in that folder can get executed from any location by just typing its name in the terminal.\nHowever, I'm having trouble executing arp-lw-scan in an easy way, because it requires root access. Just typing arp-lw-scan while being in my home directory gives an error about not having root rights.  I can type sudo ~/Scripts/arp-lw-scan, and that works, but that's still pretty much to type. I want to be able to just type sudo arp-lw-scan to execute the given script.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: Bash aliases\nAliases are the shortcuts in the command line. The regular shell, Bash, allows you to create your own aliases.\nTo try it out (without saving them permanently), try this:\nalias myalias='gksudo gparted'\nmyalias\n\nTo save them permanently, create a file ~/.bash_aliases like this:\nalias myalias='gksudo gparted'\nalias edsources='gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list'\n\nThe default ~/.bashrc file installed for users in Ubuntu will source the ~/.bash_aliases file by default.\nAliases allow you to append more arguments and 'overrule' current commands too. A common use case of this is\nalias rm='rm -i'\n\nTo get a confirmation message for everything you try to delete with rm.\nIn case you want to 'escape' an alias by running the original command, prepend it with a backslash. So, with the rm example, just do\n\\rm myfile\n\nto remove the file without the -i option forced by the alias.\nCurrent script\nAbout your current approach, you should just be able to prepend the command in the one-line script with sudo (or gksudo).\n", "Q: How to direct Back in Time snapshots to a Samba share?

However, sometimes I'd like to open a file in a different (non-default) application. Is there a way to achieve this from the terminal?\n(Obviously, some applications can take a file as an argument, e.g. vlc /path/to/movie.mp3, but I'm looking for a more generic way that works in all situations, similar to xdg-open.)\nAn advantage of an xdg-open-like command is that the terminal window can be closed after opening the file/application. However, if I use (e.g.) vlc /path/to/movie.mp3 &, then I'll need to keep the terminal window open.\n\nA: xdg-open is, of course, designed to use the default applications. To use non-default applicaitons, I think you have three options.\n1) Type programname filename as usual.\n2) Do this outside of the terminal by a right-click in Nautilus and using open with.\n3) Use your own script in the terminal. Let's assume you have a reasonably short list of default programs you might want to choose from.\n#!/bin/bash\nread filename\nmyvar=$(zenity --list --text=\"Chose a non-default program\" --column=\"Programs\" firefox gedit)\n$myvar filename &\n\nThis would let you specify a file name, then choose the program to open it with. This is the minimal implementation, so it might need some additional work. But try it out.\nThere may not be a lot of benefits to this approach, but it gives you control over the process and options to suit whatever needs you have.\n\nA: There are pseudo-solutions like \"Gnome's Web browser\" (gnome-www-browser) or \"Gnome's text editor\" (gnome-text-editor). Same thing for the X server with its browser (x-www-browser) and its terminal emulator (x-terminal-emulator). There is also \"editor\" for the terminal text editor (nano, vi or whatever else). You can configure them with the update-alternatives line command.\nBut there were not real solution. A generic program for opening applications like xdg-open is made for opening files with default applications, not the only one application the user want to use at the very moment where he want to open the file. You cannot do this except changing the default application before opening the file but it is not user friendly and it does not woth getting default applications.\nSo the best solution for you is forgetting generic solutions and opening the file just like the specific application you want to use does.\n", "Q: Unknown user 119 when I type ps when I typed \n    ps -aux \n\ni recived\n   (...)\n    root      2158  0.3  0.1  43860  6028 ?

This is something configured improperly or at least wrong in your set up. (unless you actually use the .local.domain suffix on purpose)\nName resolving and periods\nOne important thing what a lot of people don't know, is that a full name should always end with a period (.). If you omit it, then the machine will try to resolve it within the local search domain (e.g. mydomain.tld). So in that case, a query for mypc.local would become mypc.local.mydomain.tld. To prevent this, query with the period.\nResolver configuration\nThe resolver configuration is of great importance here. In Ubuntu (and Debian) this is configured in the file /etc/network/interfaces (assuming you're not running NetworkManager):\niface eth0 inet static\n   address 192.168.3.3\n   netmask 255.255.255.0\n   gateway 192.168.3.1\n   dns-nameservers 192.168.3.45 192.168.8.10\n   dns-search foo.org bar.com                      # <-- these are the search domains\n\nName resolving in Linux can also be accomplished in other ways. It's not just that the local DNS server is being queried for all of this. Take a look at your /etc/nsswitch.conf file for the hosts configuration of resolving:\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\n\nThis means that files are tried first (this is the /etc/hosts file), then mDNS and only later the real DNS server is queried. mDNS is implemented using Avahi in Linux and is called Bonjour on Apple devices. It is using the .local suffix by default and works via broadcast messages. Much like ARP works, but then for DNS.\nAll these systems can be very confusing and even more when using .local in a regular DNS setup mixed with mDNS devices. I guess this is why you're confused now as to why one device works and the other doesn't: they're not all using the same resolving method.\nTo sort things out\n\n\n*\n\n*Avoid the use if .local unless you want to rely on mDNS completely. From your question I understand you'd like to keep things configured yourself in a central place, so my approach here is to avoid it.\n\n*Configure your local DNS server (the DD-WRT device in your case) to use a special domain name, e.g. my.home. For dnsmasq this is a single setting, but in regular setups this should be configured on both the DNS server as well as the DHCP server (as it's being announced via DHCP).\n\n*Configure all PCs to have a simple and unique host name. They use this in their request for DHCP and this is used in the dnsmasq running on your router to resolve them. Alternatively, configure them manually to not to have to rely on DHCP.\n\n*Remove any leftover configuration in /etc/resolv.conf in case you fiddled with it in the past.\n\n*Configure the PCs in your network to use my.home as the local search domain. This can be done via DHCP automatically, or if using static addresses via the /etc/network/interfaces file or in Network Manager:\n\n\n*Now both simple name resolving (ping hostname) as well as full name (ping hostname.my.home) should work.\n\n\nA: Based on the answer by gertvdijk I just commented out the line in nsswitch.conf\nsudo vim /etc/nsswitch.conf\n\n.\n.\n.\nhosts:          files dns # mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns\n\n\nA: I got similar issues with a /etc/hosts containing multiple spaces between IP and hostname, instead using a TAB.

I need to create lab contains Windows 2008R2 domain controller with Linux servers and workstations with different roles installed. Hence I need a hypervisor (type 2) for the same.  \nMy laptop does not have VT enabled hence Type-1 hypervisors (like KVM or XEN) will not help me. :(\nNOTE: I have already tried VirtualBox; downloaded from their website. However that (virtualbox) has become unresponsive and often bug checking in Windows guest. I have uninstalled that and installed it back again from Ubuntu Software Center. But it continues to blue screened on me.\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04 x32.\n_\n\nA: Your question title is about which hypervisor is best in Ubuntu, yet the body of your question mentions a specific Virtualbox step-by-step guide. I'm suggesting an alternative to Virtualbox here.\nKVM (or QEMU-KVM) is a native Linux virtualization technology, built-in to the kernel. This means you already have it installed just by running Linux!\nCheck first if you can use KVM, as it requires some hardware acceleration to be able to run. Be sure to enable VT-x \"Virtualization support\" in your BIOS to get it to work (which is a good idea to enable for either which hypervisor you're going to use!).\n$ kvm-ok \nINFO: /dev/kvm exists\nKVM acceleration can be used\n\nTo get started quickly, I would suggest to install the GUI front-end first: Virtual Machine Manager \nThe Virtual Machine Manager pretty self-explanatory. My suggestions when using Windows as a guest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the VirtIO Windows drivers for network and disks. See Installing VirtIO drivers in Windows Server 2008 on how to do that. This is similar to what \"Guest tools\" are in VirtualBox terms.\n\n*Don't use the built-in console. It's rather slow and sluggish unless you move to SPICE (which I wouldn't recommend for server installations). Use RDP instead (remote desktop) via the network.\nAs a big bonus, you can just use SSH to manage other hypervisors in your network or via the internet.\n\n\n\n\nA: Xen may be your choice. \nNote: I am not a server user. As you were looking for a alternative hypervisor for ubuntu, so thought of sharing it.\n\nA: I have used VirtualBox on Linux on-and-off for many years, and with few complaints. I would recommend it over VMware Player. And in recent years, VirtualBox has seen great improvements; most notably in supporting hardware acceleration for graphics. \nIf you need the latest, .debs for Ubuntu can be downloaded from Virtualbox's download page. However, you haven't mentioned any details of the issues you're experiencing in the guests - so I don't know whether using a more recent version will help. \nVMware makes available VMware Player which can run on Linux: instructions are here. Unless you have cause to do so, I would stick with VirtualBox; but I know some prefer Player...\nTo comment on Xen; it's a solid option. As a T1 hypervisor, you get superior performance, at the cost of more complex setup configuration. My experiences with it have been mixed, but then I have been trying to accomplish more troublesome tasks than most. I've yet to try Xen 4.2.\nIt really depends on the requirements of your \"lab\". Generally speaking, the more control and performance you need, the greater the argument for migrating to a T1 solution. For simpler and/or quicker projects, VirtualBox is the way to go. \nHowever, I see your Ubuntu installations are 32-bit... so Xen isn't going to be viable in that configuration with 64-bit guests.\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu/Linux machines be infected by the Shylock trojan? I've heard of this trojan that can now spread through Skype. I use Skype regularly and also access my online banking account occasionally on my machine. Should I be worried? I also run ClamAV and a firewall. I'm on 12.04. What steps can this noob take to gain further protection?\n\nA: No, no Linux system can be affected. Please see:\nhttp://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-082310-2840-99\n\"Systems Affected: Windows 98, Windows 95, Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows Me, Windows Vista, Windows NT, Windows 2000\"\nWine cannot affect Linux, because it is a virtual XP, meaning that the \"Windows\" folder (made by wine, because some Win applications need resources from there) is fake. Even if the virus does change things in the fake \"Windows\" folder, it does not affect Linux.\n", "Q: How do I prevent Ubuntu from upgrading? I've been struggling with this bug the whole day. I've managed to install following the first workaround proposed, but after I install the nvidia-current drivers I end up in a small 640x480 screen and I can't select the nvidia drivers with jockey-text.\nAs mentioned in the bug description this doesn't seem to happen in 11.10, so I dug into my CD collection and found an old 11.04. I'm not done testing it, but so far so good.\nBut now I'm very afraid to update stuff. How can I prevent Ubuntu from upgrading? Or, should I look out and only not upgrade certain packages related to the mentioned bug?\n\nA: 11.04 is out of support. You won't be getting security updates for it. So you really shouldn't be running it.\nMore generally, if you don't want any non-security updates, go into Software Sources, and turn off the updates repository.\n", "Q: Compiling C programs on Ubuntu 12.04 I'm an absolute beginner at writing programs in C, and I'm having difficulty compiling a simple program.

Can anyone help?\n\nA: Seems like you have an unwanted space between # and include:\n# include <stdio.h>   \n\nMake that \n#include <stdio.h> \n\nand compile.\nThat should solve it for you.\n\nA: The reason why your code is not compiling is because of the -lmls at the end of the line.  This is looking for a library called \"mls\".  (Perhaps you are going to be coding with libmls for Maximum Length Sequence later?) \nCompile with\nUbuntu:~/Desktop/cFiles$ gcc -Wall hello.c -o hello.out\n\nThe rest of your output is warnings.  Most of them do not match the code which you provided.

I recently switched from Windows to Lubuntu as my sole OS.\nMy filesystem now has a NTFS partition with all my data (which I now would like to convert to EXT4), a EXT4 partition with Lubuntu on it and a swap partition. \nI have a full backup of the data, so wiping the NTFS partition is not the problem. But I want to be sure that, after wiping/converting it I can still boot Lubuntu just as before. The data partition is the first partition and gparted shows me a 'boot' flag on it. \nHere is my boot info output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1548312/\nCan I just delete the partition, and create a EXT4 one in it's place with gparted?\nWould be great if someone with greater knowledge could have a look! :)\nThanks a lot in advance.\n\nA: Answering my own question. As I found out, boot flags are a windows thing, so Ubuntu wouldn't bother about them in any way. Deleting the partition and recreating a EXT4 in it's place worked perfectly fine and didn't change anything in terms of booting the system.\n", "Q: Is this a Unity Dash bug or Aptana Studio 3 bug? Icon in Dash being displayed really large. I have installed Aptana studio 3 and you can see the icon in Unity Dash is being displayed, very large. \nIs it a Unity Dash bug or just Aptana Studio 3 bug ? \n\n\nA: This problem is due to a recent (not sure when) change in the way Unity displays icons.  Aptana Studio 3 provides a .xpm file to use as the icon, which is what I'm assuming you're using.  That's when this behaviour is seen and I've concluded that Unity can not resize .xpm images.\nThe fix is as simple as converting the .xpm file into a Unity friendly .png file that it can resize properly.  You can do this online pretty easily at a site like http://www.convertmyimage.com/.\nOnce you get the converted .png file, make sure you update your .desktop file to reference this new .png and you should be all good to go.\n", "Q: failed to update - internet connection error i am using ubuntu 12.04 lts.\ni m trying to update but i get an error \n\nFailed to download repository information\n  Check your Internet connection.\n\nMy internet connection is fine.\nwhen i see details of the error an get this \n\nW:Failed to fetch http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/dists/stable/Release  Unable to find expected entry 'main/source/Sources' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)\n  , E:Some index files failed to download.

I own a Lenovo EasyPad Z580 running Ubuntu and I'd like to manage more of the power management (battery). I found answers in this question about battery management on Lenovo systems: How can I limit battery charging to 80% capacity? \nSo, I've installed tp smapi using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install tp-smapi-dkms\n\nAquaherd's answer seems to settle the problem for some users. In the comments however it is clear it throws the following error for other users (me included):\nsudo modprobe tp_smapi\nFATAL: Error inserting tp_smapi (/lib/modules/3.5.0-17-generic/updates/dkms/tp_smapi.ko):\n No such device\n\nDKMS reports (dkms status):\ntp-smapi, 0.41, 3.5.0-21-generic, x86_64: installed\n\nI checked the following sources, but they all seem too advanced for me.

You've installed the correct DKMS package (tp-smapi-dkms) and you're modprobe'ing correct.\ntp_smapi is for real Thinkpads only\nNot for Ideapads. And not even all Thinkpads are supported. See this page on Thinkwiki.org which models are supported. It doesn't even mention any Ideapad there.\nFrom the same Thinkwiki.org page:\n\nThe ThinkPad SL series and IdeaPad series have firmware that is completely different from other ThinkPad models. Neither tp_smapi nor thinkpad-acpi support these models.\n\nThese are consumer-grade notebooks, from the original Lenovo line. The supported Thinkpads are more of the original IBM-line of machines with a completely different design in hardware. The component that's key here is the embedded hardware controller for this unique power controlling feature. As far as I know, only the business-line of Thinkpads still feature this today.\nShort history: Lenovo bought IBM's Thinkpad line of machines in 2005, but even till today the machines between the Thinkpad T/X/W series can't be compared to the consumer-grade machines in terms of compatibility (and quality).\nBottom line: you can't do this on your device.\n", "Q: Dynamically change the application icon The icon used for the app is in the .desktop file but is it possible to change this dynamically?

I am experiencing a bug where on first login to an Ubuntu/Unity session (12.04), my mouse buttons are not inverted (left-handed). The configuration does correctly list them as inverted, but they don't behave that way. If I log out and login again, they behave correctly, as per the configuration. It worked correctly for the longest time and only recently started misbehaving.\nNow my question is: how should one report such a bug? I have no idea what package or process causes the problem. In fact, there may be multiple packages involved. I have a Launchpad account and have reported bugs, or added information to bugs, in the past, so I'm familiar with the process. I just can't figure out how to report this without taking a guess at the responsible process to pass to ubuntu-bug.\n\nA: While it is possible to report bugs without specifying a package (as you've discovered), bugs reported that way virtually never have any progress made on them until a package gets specified.\nSo it's best to report a bug against a specific package whenever possible. You shouldn't randomly guess, but it is OK to report a bug against the wrong package if you had reason to believe it was the most likely package.\nIf you had to report this bug with no further information, I'd recommend reporting it against gnome-settings-daemon (remember, Unity is a shell for GNOME, a Unity desktop is GNOME). Probably that is what's preventing the setting from being applied correctly some of the time. This is (most likely) the package that should be applying the setting at login, and is not doing so properly.\nIf you happened to have KDE installed too, and it happened there as well (even when no GNOME login had taken place since reboot), then xserver-xorg-input-mouse, which provides mouse input functionality to the GUI, might potentially make more sense.\nBut gnome-settings-daemon is your best bet, right now.\nIt's best to start a bug report with ubuntu-bug but if you already filed the bug on Launchpad, you don't have to report it again (unless asked to do so). Instead, specify gnome-settings-daemon as the package. Once the bug report is targeted against that, run\napport-collect BugNumber\nwhere BugNumber is replaced with the bug number on Launchpad. This will automatically collect and attach (at least most of) the technical information that would have been attached had you started the bug reporting process by running ubuntu-bug.\nIf you wish, feel free to subscribe me to the bug. (I'm not a triager or developer though; I might not end up helping any.)\n\nA: Ah, found it. You can create bugs against package \"I don't know\" via https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug/\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu on my virtual harddisk (one of the feature of Windows 7) I would like to know how to install Ubuntu on my virtual hard drive which I created on Windows 7. The problem lies in making my virtual drive an active one. \nHow can I make my virtual drive active for installing Ubuntu on this virtual disk only so that it won't harm my real hdd?\n\nA: Ubuntu can not be installed on a Windows VHD\nFrom Microsoft Technet we can see the following note for a bootable Windows7 virtual hard drive (VHD):\n\n\"Bootable VHDs are VHDs that contain a Windows image.\"\n\nThis means that these drives are technically not meant to be able to boot any other OS, and they will be formatted with a Windows compatible format which is not the format Ubuntu needs for booting and running.\nSomeone may find a hack on how to boot to such a drive. But because Ubuntu provides a similar technology with booting from a virtual drive on Windows (see Wubi Ubuntu Wiki) there is not really a need for such a hack.\nWith Wubi, as with Microsoft VHD we do need to at least change the default bootloader in order to have an OS selection on boot. If you do not like this either you may want to consider installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine, but this will lead to a performance drop as compared to a real installation.\n", "Q: Change keyboard layout inside recovery mode I had two keyboard layouts: \"Swedish\" and \"Farsi\" in my Ubuntu 11.10.

I am new to Ubuntu and Linux and I want to install and use the newest version of the screenwriting software Celtx on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. \nAfter trying https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+question/206295 and using\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:dreamstudio/video\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install celtx\n\nI unfortunately had to find out that was a rather old version with a fairly screwed up UI. I then downloaded the newest version from http://download.celtx.com/2.9.7/Celtx-2.9.7-64.tar.bz2 but now I don't know how to properly install it.\nI extracted it to /home/username/ (there was no ~/bin/) as described here and I can now launch the application by running the file celtx within that folder (I get asked whether I want to Display, run or run it in Terminal) and it works fine. But I can't get it to launch from Unity.\nI tried right-clicking the launcher button and going \"Lock to Launcher\" while it's running and it does create an icon but clicking it to launch the program does nothing. Also searching for celtx in the Dash doesn't find the app.\nAnd advice on how to properly install Celtx 2.9.7 in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS?\n\nA: This tutorial: How to Install Celtx 2.9.7 on Ubuntu Linux might help people in the future, as I found it very brief and clear.

Type /usr/local/celtx/celtx in command area.\nNow you can search for and open celtx in the Unity Dash.\n\nA: Using your terminal, just put the extracted celtx folder in /usr/lib. You may need root permission. So go to where you extracted the folder and just type \nsudo mv celtx /usr/lib\nThen, cd to /usr/lib/celtx. Type ./celtx and it will launch. \nYou can create a launcher to do it in the future.

What specific tools are available, if any, or should we just use a fake Makefile that runs scons?\n\nA: The debian/rules file is a Makefile. Anything you might want to do in a \"fake\" Makefile, you can just do there. The dh command  is a helper that will run most build systems with Debian defaults for you. I believe it supports scons If so, all you need is:\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n\n%:\n    dh $@\n\nYou can override its default behavior if you need to pass custom options (or if it doesn't really support scons). Then your rules file might look like:\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n\nSCONS=scons \n\n%:\n    dh $@\n\noverride_dh_auto_build:\n    $(SCONS) --prefix=$(DEB_DESTDIR)/usr\n\noverride_dh_auto_clean:\n    dh_auto_clean\n    $(SCONS)  -c\n\noverride_dh_auto_install:\n    $(SCONS) install --prefix=$(DEB_DESTDIR)/usr\n\nSometimes, the best way to learn how to do something is to look at how other packages do it.

I also have an hybrid graphic card with a Intel HD 4000 and a AMD Radeon HD 7730m 2go. My Linux OS is Ubuntu 12.10 64 bits.\nMy problem is pretty simple, I went to AMD and downloaded the drivers for my GPU. The version is new,  it is 13.1. AMD recommend me to use this driver for my card so it gotta be the right drivers for my card. Also they are 64 bits and all. So I install it manually and use one of the tutorials we've got on the internet for this specific type of card. \nI install the recommended packages from the tutorial \nsudo apt-get install build-essential cdbs fakeroot dh-make debhelper debconf libstdc++6\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic xserver-xorg-core libgcc1\nsudo apt-get install dkms libqtgui4 wget execstack libelfg0 dh-modaliases\n\nAnd I install the 64 bit packages required:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs lib32gcc1 libc6-i386\n   cd /usr ; sudo ln -svT lib /usr/lib64\nSo then I unzip and all my drivers, make my .run executable, you know the thing you have to do to install the driver.\nEvery is installed, but during the installation I can see;\nupdate-alternatives: using /usr/lib/fglrx/ld.so.conf to provide /etc/ld.so.conf.d/x86_64-linux-gnu_GL.conf (x86_64-linux-gnu_gl_conf) in auto mode\nupdate-alternatives: warning: forcing reinstallation of alternative /usr/lib/fglrx/ld.so.conf because link group x86_64-linux-gnu_gl_conf is broken\nupdate-alternatives: using /usr/lib/fglrx/alt_ld.so.conf to provide /etc/ld.so.conf.d/i386-linux-gnu_GL.conf (i386-linux-gnu_gl_conf) in auto mode\nupdate-initramfs: deferring update (trigger activated)\n\nWell, after the installation you must generate your Xorg.conf so I do the command;\nsudo amdconfig --initial -f\n\nAnd there what it says:\namdconfig: No supported adapters detected\n\nAlso, I don't know if it can be useful but I have installed the open source drivers I did once\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati*\n\nI don't have any ppa that could get a different open source driver, those are from Ubuntu directly\nCould it be the problem? \nThank you very much for your help!\nAlso what do I do if I have the file to run the driver but I can't install it the fast way because there are missing tools? \n\nA: Create xorg.conf manually. Copy xorg.conf from Step 3 of my post, and configure the correct BusID (using lspci | grep VGA, also noted in my post in Step 3). I had been discussing it in reddit post too.  \nGood Luck !!!\n\nA: The latest AMD drivers no longer support series 4000 or below cards. You will need to use the 12.6 legacy driver, which does not support xorg 1.13, so you will need to either downgrade xorg or go back to 12.04.\n\nA: the last version of the drivers WORKS! Go on the website.\nhttp://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Quantal_Installation_Guide\nDo as they tell you and it works. I took the intel drivers from ppa:andrikos/ppa.\n=D I am happy I can use Linux Ubuntu now!!! haha =)\n", "Q: How do I install Chrome on a server?

Linux (and thus Ubuntu) is a complete other ballgame.\nLinux uses generic drivers. This means that IF hardware is supported by Linux the drivers are included with the system and during installation Linux will install those drivers for you. \nFor the motherboard you need no drivers. That Utility DVD you have is worthless when using Linux. Unless there are documents on there (but the drivers and software are useless).\nFor graphics cards we have native drivers but also drivers from the videocard manufacturers.

I'm doubtful if the import is permanent too as I'd imported previously but when I logged on today rhythmbox was empty.\n2) I've tried to set Preferences>Music>Music Location as the 'music' folder I want but it keeps showing 'multiple locations set'. How do I change this & ensure imported files/folders are saved where I want\n3) I've got plugins enabled for album art getting but can't see how to get this to work?\n4) Trying to answer the above I went to the rhythembox site & saw http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/screenshots/rhythmbox-visualization.png\nCan't see any way to set up visualizations on rhythembox but it looks cool so I'd like to know how.\n5) I now find that I've got some files on my Ipod I don't have in my external HDD music folder as for some reason importing these into rhythmbox previously didn't save them - Will I be able to transfer from Ipod to Rhythembox  save them in my main music folder?\nI realise its a lot of questions but I'd appreciate any help you can give.\n\nA: Rhythmbox doesn't copy your music to a different folder when you add files to your library. It stores the reference to the file you added, and some of the information from its ID3 tags, and that is all. If you added a bunch of files on an external disk, then unmounted the disk, the tracks will be hidden from the library view, and will show up under the \"Missing files\" source that will appear in the left hand panel.\nThe \"multiple locations set\" for the library folder is because purchased music from Ubuntu One gets downloaded to a separate folder, and not in the Music folder, so the plug-in adds the correct location to the library locations list. The otherwise standard default location, is your standard \"Music\" folder. If you pick a different location, then the new location will be used, and the Ubuntu One extension will ensure its location is also added to the list. However, as I already said, Rhythmbox does not copy music over to another directory when you import it.\nThe Cover Art Search plug-in will search for album art using last.fm, and cache it locally. It will also look inside the tags in the music file. If it can't find art for the song, it won't display it.\nIf you drag a song from your iPod to the \"Music\" library in Rhythmbox, then it will copy that file to your local music library folder. It does this because it knows the iPod is a music player. It doesn't do this for simple external disk drives, though.\n", "Q: Adding nodes to MAAS EDIT: The wiki page has been updated with the info.

For example, see the instructions here, which are generally just as valid for Ubuntu as for Arch. In my case, I had a LUKS1 device, which apparently makes things easier. All I had to do was this:\n\n*\n\n*Boot into a live environment using a USB stick. I used Ubuntu 18.04.\n\n*Run sudo cryptsetup-reencrypt --decrypt <device_path>.\n\nThat was it. For a 250 GB SSD, it took 20 minutes. I didn't have to do anything special to /etc/fstab, grub, or initramfs. I commented out the relevant (only) line in /etc/crypttab, but I don't even think that was necessary.\nThat said, I had a second machine with a 500 GB SSD, and after about 3 hours, it still claimed it was going to be another 90 minutes and the rate was only getting slower, so I gave up and just reflashed the drive.\nBefore doing anything, though, I recommend backing up the (decrypted) partition. Using dd as described in another answer is great. I did it while the partition was mounted before I rebooted into the live USB environment. This came in handy for the partition I ended up reflashing, as I was able to remount the backup and copy over anything I cared strongly about.\n\nA: If Ubuntu asks for an encryption passphrase during boot (i.e. on the text console before the login screen is displayed), this indicates that a full disk encryption method was used. (There's more than one way to do this, but I'll keep the answer general.) The encryption is handled by an extra software layer between the file system and the physical hard drive, not the file system itself.\nThere is no simple method or tool to undo this. With some knowledge about how Linux systems work, it can be done. You'd have to move the whole file system (or all files) to another partition (with enough free space) or external HDD. Then, remove the encrypted container, and recreate the file system without encryption. Finally, make sure that the new file system  is properly recognized by the boot loader and mount -a before rebooting.\nIf possible, it's best to avoid this time consuming and error-prone procedure. Just do a fresh install. For a new user, this is the quickest and safest option.\nPS: Chances are that you can change the encryption passphrase, possibly to an empty string. Then decrypting only requires to press Enter. Maybe you can go further and supress to (now useless) passphrase prompt. However, this does not disable the encryption. The data would still be encrypted although the encryption would be useless since the key can be trivially guessed.\n\nA: Below it's my solution that worked. Bear in mind that I am not Linux specialist, so it may be not the best solution. Could not find better one anyway.\nMigrating FDE installation to unencrypted partition\nNOTE: Whenever I say, I mean\n/dev/sda1 - boot partition\n/dev/sda5 - encrypted partition\n/dev/sda3 - clean non-encrypted EXT4 partition\n/dev/sda2 - my newly created swap partition\n\nCopying data from encrypted root filesystem\nBoot from a live CD. I've used Ubuntu 13.10 32bit desktop ISO.\nMount your partition:\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda5 crypt1\n\nCopy your source data to destination partition and save dd PID to pid variable:\nsudo dd if=/dev/ubuntu-vg/root of=/dev/sda3 bs=1M & pid=$!\n\nThis will ping each second dd process with USR1 signal and dd results status:\nwhile sudo kill -USR $pid; do sleep 1; done\n\nAlternative to monitoring DD\nIf you don't like above 'while method', you can use watch. \nOpen different terminal window and get the PID:\npgrep -l '^dd$' | awk '{ print $1 }'\n\nReplace  with your process ID:\nwatch kill -USR1 <pid>\n\nYou should see output in your dd terminal each 2s.\nConfiguring the new root filesystem and partitions\nWhen it's done you can mount your non-encrpyted partition to see if it's OK:\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt\n\nAfter that unmount your partition:\nsudo umount /dev/sda3\n\nRelease crypt partition:\nsudo cryptsetup luksClose /dev/sda5\n\nRun gparted.\nDelete your LUKS partition (both extended and logical).\nResize your /dev/sda3 and move left.\nCreate swap partition.\nNote: Moving your /dev/sda3 left may take long. For me it took 30min on 120GB partition and SSD drive.\nIf you have 500GB+ HDD be prepared for few hours waiting.\nYou may want to create swap before your partition instead of moving your /dev/sda3.\nCreate a new swap filesystem on your swap partition:\nsudo mkswap /dev/sda2 \n\nand store somewhere the UUID.\nGet your root partition UUID:\nsudo blkid /dev/sda3\n\nEdit fstab:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nDelete or comment out overlayfs and tmpfs lines.\nAdd line replacing  with blkid result:\nUUID=<uuid_root> /  ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 1\nUUID=<uuid_swap> none swap sw 0 0\n\nRemove file:\nrm /etc/crypttab\n\nUpdate your initramfs to avoid errors like \"cryptsetup: evms_activate is not available\":\nsudo -i\nmount /dev/sda3 /mnt\nmount -t proc none /mnt/proc\nmount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys\nmount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot\nchroot /mnt /bin/bash\napt-get remove --purge cryptsetup\nupdate-initramfs -u -k all\n\nFinal notes and troubleshooting\nIt worked for me, however there is chance that doing above step by step may not work for you.\nBefore I've figured out the update-initramfs method I was reinstalling kernel few times also was modifying grub.\nHowever it should not be a case for you.\nRemember that above instructions may delete your data, so be careful and make BACKUP, BEFORE proceeding that.\nJust in case you have kernel troubles (chrooted and /boot mounted): \nuname -r\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-3.X.Y-ZZ-generic\n\nOf course replace linux-image-3.X.Y-ZZ with your kernel date from uname.\nor GRUB (outside chroot):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nMore details: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nGood luck\n\nA: In case it is OK to keep the encryption, but to switch off the passphrase prompt, a much simpler approach is to just set a trivial password like \"password\" and then save that trivial password in the initramfs in cleartext. Disable the LUKS encryption password.\nEssentially, add a hook script which in turn adds a \"keyscript\" to the initramfs. Usually these scripts are used to get the password via Bletooth, from a USB stick etc., but in this case, just make it print the trivial password.\n\nA: Just format the encrypted disk and run disk drill , thats what i did i just put it in the slot sata on my windows laptop dont write anything to it after you have formatted it , use disk drill and voila, an Lubuntu encrypted volume was all open to get back my files from.\n\nA: @pattivacek 's short answer worked fine for me.\nTo get rid of the start screen \"Enter your password\" part - i just added\napt purge cryptsetup\n\nafter that.\n", "Q: Simple Scan - Changing the default output File Type to PDF and improving Compression? Is there a way to change the default output file type in the 'Simple Scan' software provided with Ubuntu 12.10 to be a PDF rather than a JPEG? And is it possible to modify the compression settings on the PDFs that Simple Scan outputs to be higher and so produce smaller file sizes?\nBackground: I use Simple Scan on Ubuntu 12.10 to scan multiple receipts to prepare for the Tax Season. I scan many hundreds of receipts at a time, so this is a very repetitive task. \nIssue 1: Every time I scan a new document using Simple Scan, the software defaults the file format to JPEG, meaning that I need to change the output format from JPEG to PDF per scan. This is very repetitive and precisely the sort of user preference that Ubuntu is usually so good at accommodating via gconf or dconf settings, or other tweak tools.\nIssue 2: I need to store my scans in PDF format with a high level of file compression. The output quality of the PDFs that are generated by Simple Scan is very high, meaning that the files that are output are too large to be emailed in bulk. I typically use an external script to later compress multiple PDFs in bulk but this can get messy and so I'd like to improve my workflow.\nAny ideas please? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I've answered my own question!\nSelecting Scan > Text now creates PDF files by default that are compressed. My preference for 'Text' is persisted, meaning that I can now quickly perform many scans without needing to manually update my settings per scan.\nThe reason why Simple Scan was defaulting to JPEG format previously was because I was scanning as an 'Image' rather than as 'Text'. I didn't see that there were options under the main 'Scan' menu item to optimise for either 'Images' or 'Text'.\n", "Q: Windows 8 laptop keeps alternating between the Windows 8 bootloader and Grub2 I have a Toshiba Portege Z935 with Windows 8 pre-installed.

(shared with windows) I have a freshly installed Ubuntu 12.04LTS and I wanted to use it to share an offline (wired) printer that is connected to the machine running ubuntu. \nI wanted to be able to print to this printer from both other Ubuntu Machines as well as Windows 7 machine. I am a newbie thus I don't really know how to do this, before I used to use Google Cloud Print but I wanted more \"Local\" method. \nHow could I accomplish that over a WiFi network?\nThank you.\n\nA: As long as your computers can see each other on the network, you should be able to share with them pretty easily (this works even if you have some computers that are on the network via Ethernet and some that are on Wifi).\nThe simplest way is to log on to the computer that has the printer connected to it (this is the \"server\"), go to \"Printers,\" right-click the printer and make sure \"Shared\" is checked. If not, enable it (this may require you to install CUPS (Common Unix Print Server), which it will prompt you for, if you do).\nThe other Ubuntu machine should pick it up easily. If it doesn't pick it up automatically, open terminal on your server and type in ip addr and find your wireless connection (usually named \"wlan0\") and make note of its inet value (usually something like \"192.168.1.xxx\" where \"xxx\" is between 2 and 254). Then, on your other Ubuntu machine, in Printers, select \"Add Printer\". If it doesn't detect it, select \"Find a Network Printer\" and put in the IP address of the server and click \"Find.\" It should pick it up from there, and the installer will walk you through.\nWindows 7 has a networking option called \"Home Group\", make sure this is turned off (I've found that it tends to interfere with networked sharing on mixed OS networks). You can find it in the \"Network and Sharing Center\" section of the Control Panel. Once that's turned off, you should be able to find the printer via the \"Network Printer\" option of the \"Printers and Devices\" Add Printer wizard.\nIf the Windows 7 client doesn't see the printer, or won't connect to it, you may need to turn on the Internet Printing Client, as described in this Microsoft Knowledgebase Article, and use the CUPS Windows driver when the printer setup wizard asks for the driver.\nEdit: If your computers can't see each other, there are a few things to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure file and print sharing is turned on (Windows) If the Windows machine doesn't see other computers, it's likely because File and Print Sharing is turned off. The Microsoft Knowledgebase has detailed instructions, but basically - go to \"Network and Sharing Center,\" find the \"File and Print Sharing\" options for the details for the network you're connected to, and make sure it's turned on.\n\n*Make sure all computers are on the same subnet. An IP address has four sets of numbers separated by a dot. All computers should have the same for the first three sets (such as \"192.168.1.xxx\"). If they don't, then you'll need to adjust the DNS software of your router to make sure they are all on the same subnet. This will vary by software, so you'll need to consult the manual or community for your particular router.\n\n*Make sure the print server is broadcasting the printer. On your print server, open \"Printers\" and find the \"Server\" menu. Click on \"Settings\" and make sure \"Publish shared printers connected to this system\" is checked, nothing else should need to be checked. (You may need to click \"Show printers shared by other systems\" on the Ubuntu client for it to see the shared printer.)\n", "Q: Does the order of kernel parameters matter when adding acpi_backlight=vendor?

But I don't know how to solve it.\nI tried to edit fstab (sudo gedit /etc/fstab) adding this line: \n/dev/sda /media/Dati ntfs user,exec 0 1\n\nbut after rebooting Ubuntu I had a warning on boot about a problem mounting a drive, that's because I set KDE to auto mount my Dati drive on boot. \nSo I should auto mount my NTFS drive with execute permission? How can I do that?\n\nA: Follow these steps to make a NTFS partition executable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and type sudo blkid -c /dev/null\nThis command allow you to identify your NTFS drive and your UUID number. Example:\n/dev/sdb1: LABEL=\"my_label\" UUID=\"xxx\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\n\n\n*Open the /etc/fstab file from terminal typing sudo -H gedit /etc/fstab\n\n*Don’t edit the existing lines, but add new one at the end like this example:\nUUID=xxx /media/my_label ntfs-3g defaults,auto,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=002 0 0\n\nNOTE: Replace the UUID number and the mounting point /media/my_label according to your situation!\n\n*Save the file and close the text editor.\n\n*Enter the next command in the terminal: sudo mount -a\n\n*And restart Ubuntu. Done\nNow, every time you mount your NTFS partition, you will be able to run executable files. \n\nA: I tried above solutions but didn’t work for me. This worked.\nUUID=xxx /media/ny ntfs-3g    auto,users,permissions,exec,big_writes,windows_names 0       0 \nRef - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NTFS-3G\n", "Q: Contributing to the package or the upstream branch? While learning about Ubuntu development & packaging, there's one part that's not quite clear to me. So, let's say we're in the middle of active development (e.g. Raring) before feature freeze and I want to work on improving a program packaged for Ubuntu - e.g. Guake. I would like to fix a bug, add a new feature etc. Now, I see two ways of doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*working on the upstream trunk lp:guake, submitting a merge proposal and requesting the package maintainer for Ubuntu to resync the package\n\n*working on the package branch ubuntu:guake, submitting my fix there and letting the project or package maintainer worry about forwarding this fix upstream or creating a guake-ubuntu0 patched version for the package repo\n\n\nIs one of these two approaches better? Does it depend on the situation (e.g. type of contribution - bug fix or a new feature; development phase) and if so, how? It would be great if someone experienced could give some more guidelines and advice on this topic.\nWhen working in the GitHub ecosystem, it always seems very clear - everything is centered around the latest development version and all pull requests are submitted for it (at least I never bumped into anybody submitting stuff for some old version 0.7 of project X), while on Launchpad this disparity between package and upstream branches kind of confuses me. I'm not sure if it's better to run the latest Ubuntu development build and dig into the source that's available there (through apt-get source <package>) or should I just get the latest trunk code into my stable Ubuntu, make the change and see if I can somehow get maintainers to forward this change towards the package (resyncing, checking if the builds still work against other Ubuntu libraries etc.)\nI read both the old and the new packaging guides, but it still left me puzzling about these questions.\n\nA: You need to conceptually separate Ubuntu from upstream, even when the upstream branch is hosted on Launchpad. The vast majority of packages in Ubuntu have their upstream branch hosted somewhere else completely (i.e. GitHub or SourceForge). An upstream project that is hosted on Launchpad might have a closer relationship with Ubuntu, but it should be treated essentially like any other upstream project.\nUbuntu redistributes upstream software usually only making changes when necessary for integrating with all the other software we ship. In most cases, the best option is to fix bugs upstream. That way the fix reach the most people. This also reduces the burden in Ubuntu by not having to maintain the local modifications.\nSo ideally, the process looks like your first option. You fix the bug upstream, upstream makes a new release, and Ubuntu updates to that version. As you've noticed, things don't always work that way.\nSometimes the release schedules of Ubuntu and an upstream project might not be aligned. Say you've found and fixed a bug that you'd like to see in the next Ubuntu release, but Ubuntu is releasing in three months and upstream has no idea when its next release will be. In a situation like this, the best approach is to fix the bug upstream but backport it to the release in Ubuntu as an Ubuntu specific patch. This is also the case when making a fix in a stable release of Ubuntu where we will most likely not be able to include a new upstream release.\nSometimes Ubuntu carries changes to upstream. If the bug lies in those changes, the fix should go directly to Ubuntu. This includes issues in things like the packaging.\nNew features are extremely unlikely to be accepted in Ubuntu unless it has already been accepted upstream. We will often accept patches fixing a specific problem before its been applied upstream for the sake of the larger project, but we normally don't like to deviate from upstream in terms of design or functionality.\nI know that I'm basically just saying it depends, but it does!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 Nginx and fastcgi-php not working I have nginx successfully running on my home server.

Then, edit your config to add include php.inc; (it automatically knows where to look) in your server{} block. Reload (sudo service nginx reload) or restart (sudo service nginx restart) Nginx, and your PHP file should work.\nEdit: Here are a couple of other things I've noticed in your config, and what I do differently.\nOne of the things that I do differently is to leave the main nginx.conf file alone, and instead, declare virtual hosts in either /etc/nginx/sites-available (with a symlink to sites-enabled) or /etc/nginx/conf.d. I've found this avoids issues all around, but then, I generally have to manage several virtual host domains at any given time, and set up with this in mind from the get-go.\nAnother thing I noticed in your config is that you have a root /var/www; block inside the location ~ \\.php$ {} block. You shouldn't need to do this (and, according to this article I found, may be causing your issue), as location blocks within a server block will inherit as needed.\nCombining these three tactics (leave vhost configuration out of nginx.conf and instead put it in conf.d, use an include file for PHP stuff, and allow location blocks to inherit as needed) should result in a clean configuration setup without much hassle.\nSo, your nginx.conf file should look like this (or the default, if you have it backed up):\nuser www-data;\nworker_processes 4;\npid /var/run/nginx.pid;\n\nevents {\n    worker_connections 768;\n    # multi_accept on;\n}\n\nhttp {\n\n    ##\n    # Basic Settings\n    ##\n\n    sendfile on;\n    tcp_nopush on;\n    tcp_nodelay on;\n    keepalive_timeout 65;\n    types_hash_max_size 2048;\n    # server_tokens off;\n\n    # server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;\n    # server_name_in_redirect off;\n\n    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;\n    default_type application/octet-stream;\n\n    ##\n    # Logging Settings\n    ##\n\n    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;\n    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;\n\n    ##\n    # Gzip Settings\n    ##\n\n    gzip on;\n    gzip_disable \"msie6\";\n\n    # gzip_vary on;\n    # gzip_proxied any;\n    # gzip_comp_level 6;\n    # gzip_buffers 16 8k;\n    # gzip_http_version 1.1;\n    # gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/x-javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;\n\n    ##\n    # nginx-naxsi config\n    ##\n    # Uncomment it if you installed nginx-naxsi\n    ##\n\n    #include /etc/nginx/naxsi_core.rules;\n\n    ##\n    # nginx-passenger config\n    ##\n    # Uncomment it if you installed nginx-passenger\n    ##\n\n    #passenger_root /usr;\n    #passenger_ruby /usr/bin/ruby;\n\n    ##\n    # Virtual Host Configs\n    ##\n\n    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;\n    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;\n}\n\n\n#mail {\n#   # See sample authentication script at:\n#   # http://wiki.nginx.org/ImapAuthenticateWithApachePhpScript\n# \n#   # auth_http localhost/auth.php;\n#   # pop3_capabilities \"TOP\" \"USER\";\n#   # imap_capabilities \"IMAP4rev1\" \"UIDPLUS\";\n# \n#   server {\n#       listen     localhost:110;\n#       protocol   pop3;\n#       proxy      on;\n#   }\n# \n#   server {\n#       listen     localhost:143;\n#       protocol   imap;\n#       proxy      on;\n#   }\n#}\n\nThen, add an entry in /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf like this:\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name localhost;\n    root /var/www;\n    include php.inc;\n}\n\n\nA: I figured it out.

After the last kernel upgrade in Ubuntu 12.10 I had to manually re-load two kernel modules for Virtualbox.\nmodprobe vboxdrv and modprobe vboxnetflt\nI don't know enough about the system to say if this is a bug, or if it's supposed to be like that, but it is rather inconvenient. As a user new to Ubuntu, it was fairly time consuming to find out what had to be done.\nIt was an automatic update, which asked me to reboot when it finished. After re-boot, virtual machines wouldn't run until I had re-loaded the modules.\nSo my questions are: is this normal? Will it happen with other packages, or just Virtualbox? Is the updater supposed to do this automatically? Should I file a bug report, and if so, to whom?\n\nA: The VirtualBox host modules are build from source code on your machine. Modules for one kernel will not necessarily work (or work properly) on another kernel. They are typically recompiled after the kernel is upgraded.\nWhen you install a new kernel version, your old kernel is still running. As Javier Rivera says, you must reboot to use the new kernel.\nSo if your goal is to run VirtualBox on the new kernel, you need to reboot; the modules will be loaded when you do (after being rebuilt from source if necessary).\nHowever, if your goal is to use the old modules with the old kernel, you can manually reload them with modprobe (as you've been doing).\nIf you believe it's a bug that VirtualBox modules don't keep working for the running kernel before reboot, you can bugreport that. If you're using the version of VirtualBox provided officially in Ubuntu (rather than the version from Oracle's software source), I recommend reporting this against downstream VirtualBox (i.e., against Ubuntu's VirtualBox). Please read this guide carefully first. There's also helpful information on bug reporting in this question.\nIf you can produce this with the upstream version of VirtualBox (especially if it happens on non-Ubuntu systems, but I don't think that's essential here), I recommend reporting it (or also reporting it) upstream (search first).\nI recommend not accepting this answer immediately; maybe someone can better explain why the modules are unloaded.\n\nA: If you had to run '/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup' after the update and before loading the new kernel modules, ensure that dkms is installed and updated properly. This is the component that recompiled the modules when you reboot after updating the kernel, it should also load the modules when finished.

Are administrators root? I installed Ubuntu on my PC. To log in, I use the username and password I created during installation. Does this mean I am a root user? If yes, then how do I become non-root? It looks like non-root user is more secure than admin user.\n\nA: You are an administrator, but not root. The root user can do anything. Administrators can perform actions as root, but ordinarily what administrators do is not done by root. That way, you have full control over your own system, but only when you choose to use it.\nUbuntu asks for your password when you try to do stuff as root, to make sure it's really you.\nUser Accounts: Human, and Otherwise\nReal human users have user accounts to represent them. You created one such account when you installed Ubuntu. But not all user accounts represent real human users.\nReal human users are granted (and denied) abilities through their user accounts. They must use their user accounts to use the system; therefore, their user accounts' abilities and limitations apply to them.\nUser accounts are also used to codify sets of abilities and limitations. Some user accounts--most, actually, unless you have many human users of the machine--exist so that certain programs or commands can be run with their identity, an identity with the right abilities and limitations for the job.\nFor example, the www-data user exists so that if you run a web server, it owns the data the server make accessible. No real human user has to be empowered to make unchecked changes to those data, and the web server doesn't have to be empowered to perform any action unnecessary for serving the web. Consequently, both the web data and the rest of the system are more secure against accidental or intentional breakage, than if the web server were run by some human user who would have all the powers of the web server (and whose powers the web server would possess).\nThe Most Important Non-Human User Account\nThe superuser, whose username is root, is a non-human user account with a very specific combination of abilities and limitations: all abilities, and no limitations.\nroot's allowed to do anything. There are still things root cannot do because the system itself cannot perform or make sense out of them. So root cannot kill a process that is in uninterruptible sleep, or make a rock too heavy to move, then move it.\nMany important system processes, like init, run as root, and root is used for performing administrative tasks.\nCan I log in as root?\nIt's possible to configure the root account so it's possible to log in with a password, but this is not enabled by default in Ubuntu. Instead, you can think of root as being like www-data, lp, nobody, and other non-human accounts. (Run cat /etc/passwd or getent passwd to see them all.)\nHuman users log in with their own user accounts, and then if some task is to be performed with another user account, they cause that task to be performed with that identity, without actually having logged in as that user.\nIt's possible to configure the other non-human users, like www-data, so one can log in as them, too. That's quite rare, though, whereas in some other Unix-like OSes it's common to log in as root in a terminal. The risks of running a whole graphical interface as root, combined with how many graphical programs are not designed to run as root and may not work properly, mean that you should never attempt to get a root-owned desktop session.\nPlease note that while logging in as root is disabled by default in Ubuntu, there are ways to get a root shell without authenticating as root, which produce a similar effect: the most common are sudo -s or -i, recovery mode and similar techniques. (Don't worry if you don't know what those things are.) This is not actually logging in: in recovery mode, you become root before any login would occur; with the sudo-based methods, you're just running a shell as root.\nAdministrators\nIn Ubuntu, administrators are the users who can do whatever they want as root, when they choose to do so.\n\nSystem Settings > User Accounts. \"Eliah Kagan\" is an administrator, so he can do stuff as root, but he is not root.\nI'm an administrator on my Ubuntu system. When I run programs, ordinarily they run as ek (\"Eliah Kagan\" is the full name that corresponds to the ek username.)\nWhen I run AbiWord or LibreOffice, it runs as ek. When I run Firefox, Chromium, Empathy, or Pidgin, it runs as ek. The programs that run to provide the desktop interface run as ek.\nHowever, I am an administrator, so if I need to perform an administrative task, I can do so.\nsudo\nOn the command line, I would ordinarily use sudo to run a command as root:\nsudo command...\nThis will prompt me for my password. (Not root's password; root does not have one.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Because I am an administrator, I can perform actions as root. In the default configuration, I must enter my password to do this.\n\n*Users who are not administrators cannot perform actions as root, even by putting in their password. sudo commands will fail if the user running them is not an administrator.\n\n\nBecause administrators are perfectly ordinary users except for the ability to perform actions as root, running a command requiring root privileges will still fail, except when the command is run as root.\n\nScreenshot illustrating the need to use sudo to perform administrative tasks. (Based on \"Sandwich\" by Randall Munroe.)\nsudo, Graphically\nGraphical programs can run as root through graphical frontends for sudo, such as gksu/gksudo and kdesudo. For example, to run GParted as root I could run gksudo gparted. Then I would be prompted graphically for my password.\n\nSince I'm prompted graphically, there doesn't have to be a terminal. This is one of the ways administrative tools are run as root.\nPolkit\nPolkit (once known as PolicyKit) is another way for administrators to do things as root. A program accesses a service that performs the action. Sometimes, the action is running a whole program; sometimes the action is more limited.\nThese days, many graphical system administration utilities are set up to use polkit by default, rather than to use sudo.\nOne example of such a utility is the Software Center. It takes full advantage of polkit, requiring the user to put in their password only when they want to do something that requires root privileges. (This is possible with sudo-based authentication also, but it is harder and uglier to accomplish.)\nIn the Software Center, I can find and read about an application; then I'm asked for my password when I want to install it.\n\nHow polkit Is Different\nAny graphical program can be run as root with gksudo and other graphical sudo frontends. (The program might not work very well, depending on whether or not it's designed to be used as root. But the command to start the program will be executed as root.)\nWhile polkit is now more common than sudo GUI frontends as the way applications on Ubuntu perform actions as root behind the scenes, polki will only run a graphical application as root if there is a configuration file allowing it and indicating what actions may be performed.\nPolkit, Non-Graphically\npkexec is the command used to run a program with polkit.\nLike sudo, pkexec can run non-graphical commands. (And it does not require a configuration file defining the command's capabilities--it simply runs the command as root.)\npkexec command...\npkexec prompts for a password graphically, even if it is run from a Terminal (this is one of the ways its behavior is more similar to gksudo than to running straight sudo).\n(If there is no GUI--for example, if you're logged in from a virtual console or text-only SSH session, or the GUI is not functioning properly--then pkexec will degrade gracefully and prompt for your password on the command line.)\n\nOnce authentication is performed successfully, the command runs in the terminal.\n\nRunning Commands as Other Users Besides root\nroot is special because it gets to do anything that can be done. But it's a user account like any account, and the ways of running commands as root with sudo (directly or with a graphical frontend) or polkit can be modified slightly to run a command as any other user:\nsudo -u username command...\ngksudo -u username command...\npkexec --user username command...\nWhat? You just type sudo first? How is that security?!\nRunning commands with sudo is sort of like invoking papal infalliblity.\nWhen you run a command with sudo [invoke papal infallibility], Ubuntu [Catholic folks] tries hard to make sure you're really you [really the Pope].\nYes, I know papal infallibility (even when normative) is declarative; the parallel is not perfect.\nTrying to do something as root with sudo (or polkit) is a big deal--Ubuntu is not just going to let that slide by like all the other times you run a program.\nYou are prompted for your password. (Then, that you have done so is remembered for a short time, so you don't have to constantly enter your password as you administer your system.)\nBesides reminding you to be careful, this safeguards against two scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*Someone uses your computer (or mobile device), maybe under the guise of checking their email or some similar innocuous purpose. Here, it's still possible for them to do some harm--for example, they could modify or delete your documents. However, they cannot administer the system, since they cannot put in your password.\n\n*Programs that aren't supposed to administer the system cannot do so, unless you enter your password. For example, if your web browser is compromised by a security bug and runs malicious code, it still cannot perform administrative tasks. It cannot create and delete users, modify programs installed as root (which includes anything installed by the package manager, such as LibreOffice), or alter the system at a deep level.\n\n\nI've heard of su. What's that? Can I use that?\nsu authenticates as another user, and runs a command (or starts an interactive shell). It's possible to limit who is permitted to use su, but su authenticates with the target account's password, not the password of the user running.\nFor example, su username -c 'command...' runs command... as username, just like sudo -u username command....\nBut when you run a command as username with sudo, you enter your password. When you run a command as username with su, you enter username's password.\nSince su performs authentication for the target user, with su you can only run commands as users whose accounts are enabled.\nThe root account (like www-data and nobody) is disabled by default. There is no password that will work to log in as root. So you cannot use su to run commands as root.\nYou can use su to run commands as another user who can log in (which typically includes all the user accounts on your system that represent human beings).\nWhen logged in as a guest, you cannot use su at all.\nCombining su and sudo\nSomeone who is not an administrator can even use su to run sudo as an administrator. (This is OK though, as they need the administrator's password to run commands as the administrator.) That is, a limited user can use su to run sudo to run a command as root. This can look like:\nsu username -c 'sudo command...'\n(Running graphical programs this way requires special care.)\nWouldn't su be a more secure way to run commands as root?\nProbably not.\nWhat if a user shouldn't be allowed to act as root?\nMake them a limited user instead of an administrator.\nWhat if a program running as an administrator tries to sudo to root?\nUnless you have reconfigured sudo to let it succeed without a password, it will fail.\nCan't a program that shouldn't be run as root piggyback on a recent sudo command, so no password is required?\nThis would be very unlikely to succeed. These days, most operating systems (including Ubuntu) have sudo configured by default so that its timestamps apply only in a specific context.\nFor example, if I run sudo ... in one Terminal tab and authenticate successfully, sudo in another tab (or run by an unrelated GUI program, or that I run from a virtual console or SSH session) will still prompt for a password. Even if it's run immediately afterwards.\nDoesn't a program running as user X have access to user X's password?\nNo.\nIf a malicious program is able to run as an administrator, can't it \"listen in\" to what's being typed when the administrator authenticates with sudo or polkit?\nPotentially, yes. But then it could \"listen in\" to a password typed in for su.\nIf I tell someone my password—\nDon't tell people your password.\nWhat if someone has to know my password to do something on my behalf, but I don't want to let them administer the system?\nIdeally, they should have a separate user account that lets them do what they need to do. For example, can share files between accounts, allowing multiple user to write to them, while still denying access to other users.\nHowever, in a situation where a less-trusted person may be permitted to share your account, it should be a limited user account. You could make a separate account for this purpose (which makes sense--if it's an account for you and someone else who you want to have different capabilities, it should be a different account).\nSo, would the most secure thing be to disallow both sudo and su and make people log in as root, manually?\nNo, because there are serious disadvantages associated with letting people log in as root at all. Whenever possible, the smallest number of actions as possible should be undertaken as root. Even most acts relating directly to administering a system (e.g., looking at what users are configured, and reading logs) usually don't require root privileges.\nAlso, just as potentially a malicious program could watch what someone types when they run sudo or su, or create a fake sudo/su password prompt, potentially a malicious program could create a fake login screen, too.\nWhat makes a user an administrator?\nGroup membership.\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 and later, administrators are members of the group called sudo.\nIn Ubuntu 11.10 and earlier, administrators are members of the group called admin.\nWhen an Ubuntu system before 12.04 is upgraded to 12.04 or later, the admin group is kept for backward compatibility (and continues to confer administrative power to users in it), but the sudo group is used as well.\nLimited User Accounts\nCan I use a limited user account instead of an administrator account?\nIf you like, sure. Create a limited user account in System Settings > User Accounts, and log in as that user.\nCan I make my administrator account a limited user account?\nYes, just remove it from the sudo and admin groups (see above).\nBut you should make sure there is at least one other administrator account, so you can administer your system. If there is not, then you'd have to boot to recovery mode or a live CD and make some user an administrator again. (This is similar to resetting a lost administrator password.)\nGraphical tools for administering users and groups will usually keep you from creating a system with no administrators, or at least warn you. Command line tools typically will not (trusting that you know what you're doing).\n\nA: No such thing as a dumb question ;)\nI hope this clarifies things a bit:\nIn Ubuntu, two different types of user accounts may be made: standard accounts and administrator accounts. The difference between the two: a standard account is not allowed to make any important changes to your system by attaining root access, whereas an administrator account may use their password to make changes as the root user. The Root user itself is one of the many users that the system has created and that you do not normally see or notice, and you can't login as it (by default, anyway). If you are logged into an administrator type account, you can become this Root user with the sudo command in a terminal, and you are able to type in your password in order to install software, make system changes, etc. If you are logged in as a standard user, you are unable to do any of that.\n\nA: In All Linux systems To do any changes to the system we need to be authenticated as root user and as well as to apply all changes we need to be root user.\nNormal users cant apply the changes system wide.This is the advantage with Linux as compare with the windows.\nIf any attack done then that will stem up to only that area in Linux/Unix system because to attack or to modify remaining areas It need root permissions but in Windows if one place got attacked means the whole system will get affected.\nThat's why only in many questions if any user placed for no prompt for root password, then we will warn him as this is not recommended under security circumstances and leave choice upto them.\nIf you want to turn into a root user ,sudo can help you.\nsudo -i \n\nIf you would like launch application as root user then you can sudo .\nsudo <app_name>\n\nIt always a Better to run the system as non-root user.\n\nA: The account created during installation is an administrator account.\nIn Ubuntu, root account has no password and as a consequence, you can not login as the root user. There are ways to circumvent this, but this is the default setting.\nAn Administrator account in Ubuntu means that the user is added to the group sudo, which makes the account eligible to gain previleges temporarily using the sudo command. PolicyKit can request privilege escalation by prompting 'Administrator' password. (You need to select a administrator user, and give that account's password.)\nTo confirm that these are true:\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and attempt to update software package index. apt-get update is the command used to do it and this requires to be run as root. It works only when you either login as root, or execute it as root by using privilege escalations. An administrator can run sudo apt-get update by authenticating to the sudo mechanism which allows commands to be run as any user. A standard user will not be allowed to do this.\n\n\n*Open User accounts from System Settings and attempt to add a new user. The protection mechanism used there is the PolicyKit. Administrators will be allowed to authenticate and escalate privileges but standard users will be blocked. It requires an 'administrator' password to proceed.\nHere is how you check if your account is administrator or not:\n\n*\n\n*Open User accounts from System settings.\n\n*Select your user account in the left column.\n\n*You should see Administrator under the account name in both panes for administrator accounts and Standard for normal users.\n\n\nA: No.\nthe user you log in to Ubuntu with, is not the admin user\n(the admin user in Linux terminology is called root)\n", "Q: Is there any way to run doom on ubuntu?

You need a DOS emulator.\nInstall dosbox from Ubuntu Software Center or with the apt-get install dosbox command from the terminal.  It will allow you to run most DOS games.\nAfter starting dosbox you need to mount the folder where you have Doom stored on your computer.\nFor example if I have Doom stored in /home/larry/downloads/doom, in dosbox you would have to write:\nmount c /home/larry/downloads/doom\n\nto mount the doom folder directly to the virtaul C: drive.\nIf you want to run the game in Multiplayer over network (Yes you can run it over the Internet as well) check out the documentation Its Much easier than in the old days.\n\nA: A much simpler way to play an original Doom clone, first I install prboom via terminal (sudo apt-get install prboom) and then I launch it by typing prboom in the terminal.\n2018 Edit: Use prboom-plus fork instead:\nsudo apt install prboom-plus\n\n", "Q: Where is music stored in Rhythmbox?

They are currently selling clients packages where they develop web applications for them to help automate certain business tasks for them.  Then they host the web application.  This is currently being done on Mochahost until they transition to a private server.\nI have recently setup another box running Ubuntu 12.04 as a test web server.  They decided they want to use this box as a backup DNS server to the Mochahost primary.  My experience with web servers is very limited.  What should the generic process be for accomplishing this?  I was thinking I would just need to download the db files from the Mochahost primary server, save them to the secondary server, configure the primary server to point to the secondary server for zone-updating, and then configure the secondary server zone files.  Am I missing anything?  And how should I go about getting db files from the Mochahost primary server?\nThanks\n\nA: I assume you are using BIND, which you wrote in a comment. First of all you need to copy some files to your secondary name server:\n\n\n*\n\n*named.conf\n\n*named.local\n\n*db.cache\nNow open the named.conf at your secondary server and change some values:\nzone \"example.org\" IN {\n  type slave;\n  file \"bak.example.org\";\n  masters { 192.0.2.34;};\n};\n\nThe type is now set to slave, so BIND knows this one is no master. The *file*name at your master server is probably something like db.example.org. At the secondary it is changed to bak.example.org. However you can select a na e you like. I like it this way because it makes clear, that this one is just a backup nameserver. The last entry is the IP address of the master nameserver. BIND will contact it and retrieve the zone files from there. So you do not need to download those files manually.\n", "Q: How to upgrade Ubuntu 9.10 to 12.10 via terminal?

As far as I know, usb-creator does include a certain degree of persistence, but it stores everything in one single file of up to 4GB, which sounds really odd and limited in functionality and performance. I might be wrong, but it seems it doesn't quite do what I'm looking for.\nUltimately, I can drop the \"easily install Ubuntu from it\" as long as there is some sort of command that does the trick, but I'd prefer to get Ubiquity too.\n\nA: Casper-rw does not make for a Windows friendly file or partition. Linux home is not easily accessible in Windows\nA persistent Ubuntu install uses the FAT32 filesystem, which Windows can see.\nAny data that you save in the drives root can be accessed by Windows.\nAny data saved in the drives root can be accessed while running the device by going to filesystem/cdrom.\nYou need to be root to do so.\nIn other words, do a persistent install, add a folder named Windows and save data to it as normal.\nIf you do not require the ability to install Ubuntu from the drive you can do a Full install using manual partitioning, (\"Something Other\")\nYou can make the first partition FAT32 or NTFS and the second partition ext2, 3 or 4 for use as /, you may also want swap space.\nWith a full install you can do updates and upgrades just like an install to internal drive.\n", "Q: I am looking for monitor and mouse calibration i/e changing the x / y positioning of them I've just installed Ubuntu and am new to Linux.  My monitor is slightly offset; I can see the edge of the icons on the left edge of the screen on the right side of the screen, the top of the screen is a little low with a 1/4 inch gray bar, and I can't see the bottom scroll bar on Firefox, so the screen needs to be shifted a little to the right and a little to the top.  My mouse is also off center, rather than pointing with the tip of the arrow, I have to use the bottom middle of the pointer, which makes it hard to click on items, the same problem existed in the installation, but I figured I could fix it in system tools.  As far as the mouse, in Windows I would go to system setting / mouse / calibrate mouse, click on the center of the little box, and that would be it, similar to calibrating a flight stick.  I used the horizontal / vertical positioning on the monitor itself, and the edge of the screen / bottom scrollbar still didn't appear.

Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).\n\nThis seems to have started when these same three packages showed up in Ubuntu's Update Manager and kicked an error when I tried to install them there.  Based on the suggestion in the output above, I tried running:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nBut this only gave me several instances of the following error:\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/linux-image-3.2.0-36-generic_3.2.0-36.57_i386.deb (--unpack):\n unable to create `/lib/modules/3.2.0-36-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/carl9170.ko.dpkg-new' (while processing `./lib/modules/3.2.0-36-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/carl9170.ko'): No space left on device\n\nNow maybe I'm way off-base here, but I'm wondering if the error could be coming from the \"No space left on device\" part?  The thing is, I'm running Ubuntu as a VirtualBox VM but I've got it set to dynamically increase its virtual hard drive space as needed, so why am I still getting this error?\nHere's my output when I use dh -f:\nFilesystem        Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1         6.9G  5.7G  869M  88% /\nudev              494M  4.0K  494M   1% /dev\ntmpfs             201M  784K  200M   1% /run\nnone              5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone              501M   76K  501M   1% /run/shm\nVB_Shared_Folder  466G  271G  195G  59% /media/sf_VB_Shared_Folder\n\nWhen I perform sudo apt-get -f install and the system says,\nAfter this operation, 192 MB of additional disk space will be used.\n\nDoes that mean 192 MB of my virtual machine's current memory, or 192 MB on top of the rest of my free space?  As I said, my machine normally dynamically allocates additional memory from the host machine, so I don't see why there would be memory restrictions at all...\n\nA: It's possible that the \"No space left on device\" error is related to the \"unmet dependencies\" problem. Either way, you have to fix both.\nCheck free space with any of these methods (such as df -h). If if you're low, free some up using these methods (removing old kernels; also applies when /boot is not a separate partition) and these methods (removing unused packages and cached package archives).\nEspecially if the \"unmet dependencies\" problem arose from software not being properly installed and configured after disk space ran out, you should be able to fix it simply:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -f install\n\nBut if that doesn't work, don't fret--there are many other powerful (and easily applied) techniques for fixing \"unmet dependencies\":\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I resolve unmet dependencies after adding a PPA?\n\nA: If, by any chance, you're using\nsudo apt-get -f install python-package\n\ntry running\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n(without any package name), and once this step is done with, try running the original command:\nsudo apt-get install python-package\n\n\nA: looks like virtualbox+apt= error\nI am experiencing the same thing with ubuntu12.10 on virtalbox.\nMost likely it's either an apt/dpkg error or virtualbox doesn't properly process something.\nMaybe other pkg managers will work... you could try to use them; you could also install packages by downloading them from http://packages.ubuntu.com/ \ncd ~/downloads   \n   dpkg -i *.deb  \n\n\n\nA: If you install teamviewer, this can also happen.

How to install and work with INTEX 3.5G 7.2 Mbps (aka 普创E003) Wireless USB Datacard Modem on Ubuntu?\nPlease assist me as a Linux beginner!\nThank You\n\nA: Step 1\nBefore plugging in your modem, check the entries in your /dev directory.\nls /dev\n\nYou'll find an entry named sr0 if you have an Optical Disk drive(CD, DVD, Blu-Ray, etc.). If you have no optical drive (as in the case of NetBooks and newer machines), then the dongle's storage will appear as sr0, and IntexModem binary'll work for you. If that's the case, you don't need to follow these steps. Else, plug in your modem, wait a few seconds and then repeat the ls /dev command to look again in /dev directory.\nStep 2\nInside /dev directory, you'll find a new entry /sr1 along with previous /sr0. This is a Read Only partition present on your modem, which must be ejected everytime you plug in the dongle, for switching the modem from removable storage state to modem state.\neject /sr1\n\nIn case you had no optical drive, you'll have to run eject /sr0 instead. Wait a few seconds and then check your Modem's USB ID:\nlsusb\n\nIf everything worked as expected, it'd have turned to 20a6:1105 from the previous ID 20a6:f00e.\nStep 3\nNow you have to load the kernel module to make this device recognised as a USB modem:\nsudo modprobe usbserial vendor=0x20a6 product=0x1105\n\nNow that you have succesfully loaded the module, the modem will be residing at /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1, /dev/ttyUSB2. To check, do:\nls /dev | grep ttyUSB\n\nIf nothing turns out, then wait. It can take anywhere from 30 seconds to a whole minute. Once you are sure there are these ttyUSB entries in your /dev, just use your default connection client to connect. For example in Ubuntu, the Network Manager or the connection icon on top panel.\n\nBackground/History:\nIntexModem binary didn't work for me and showed strange behaviors such as ejecting the Optical Drive. So I contacted the author of the IntexModem binary - Prateek \"GunJack\" Sharma, who explained to me how the binary works. It's his reply I formulated as this answer.\nNewer usb-modeswitch versions contain 20a6:1105 and 20a6:f00e config files by default and so you don't need to do the above steps to get it working. As a result, if you're running a recent Ubuntu release, the modem'll work 'out of box' without any extra configuration.\n\nA: The problem is that this modem does not switch automatically from a USB storage device to a USB Modem. Here is a simple solution.\nDownload This File IntexModem.\nNow Extract it and execute the IntexModem program. This will configure your modem to be used with Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian, Crunchbangnor other Debian based OS.\nYou will have to run this program everytime you plug in the modem. To make things simpler, you can put it in /usr/local/bin directory and run it just by typing IntexModem in a terminal.\nNote:- You may have to wait 1-2 minutes for your modem to be recognised in Network Manager.\n", "Q: Uninstall Netflix Desktop? I recently installed Netflix Desktop, but I would like to uninstall it. But I'm a noob when it comes to Ubuntu and I can't find it in the Software Center, how do I go about uninstalling it?\n\nA: The best way to remove Netflix Desktop (see also official site) depends on how you installed it.\nSo far, Netflix Desktop is not available in any of Ubuntu's official software sources. So the project maintains a PPA. You most likely installed it that way.\nIf you installed netflix-desktop from the PPA:\nIf you're planning to reinstall Netflix Desktop soon, your best bet it to just remove the package installed from the PPA (without removing the PPA).\nOtherwise the best thing to do is to purge the PPA from your configured software sources and uninstall netflix-desktop (and any other packages that might be installed from it--that PPA does provide other pacakges as well, and unless you know you want them, you probably don't).\nPurging the PPA and all the software installed from it can be done with a single command--but you may need to install the command first. This does both:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ppa-purge && sudo ppa-purge ppa:ehoover/compholio\n\nEven if you've already removed just the package with sudo apt-get remove netflix-desktop, you can still remove the PPA and any other packages installed from it with the above ppa-purge command. (See this question if you're interested in details of how ppa-purge, and its alternatives, work.)\nIf you got nextflix-desktop the old way, unpacking the archive in your home folder:\nBefore the PPA, Netflix Desktop was installed by unpacking an archive to a .netflix-desktop folder inside the user's home folder. As blogged, you can remove that by running:\nrm -Rf ~/.netflix-desktop\n\nBe very careful when you run that. If you accidentally put a space between ~ an / or / and ., you'll delete your whole home directory, including all your documents!\n(If you prefer to remove the .netflix-desktop folder from the comfort of a GUI, open a Nautilus window, navigate to your home folder if you're not already there, press Ctrl+H to click View > Show Hidden Files, and delete the .netflix-desktop folder.)\nIf you were using Netflix Desktop installed this way, you might want to try the newer version from the PPA; it may work better for you. And if you used the old version and then tried the PPA version without removing the old version, you may be able to fix some problems with it by removing the folder from the old version and starting over.\n\nA: Use Ctrl+Alt+T to open your terminal and type\n sudo apt-get remove netflix-desktop\n\nThen it will remove it.\n", "Q: How can I use a script to change the static IP address? How do I change the IP address of an interface from a script? \nI should say that I don't want to use ifconfig and also I don't want to edit the /etc/network/interfaces file manually. I need a script.\n\nA: If you are using ifup to configure the interface then you can define multiple so-called logical interface definitions for the interface and switch among them using ifup and ifdown. For example, you can define \"iface home\" and \"iface work\" in /etc/network/interfaces and then bring up eth0 either with \"ifup eth0=home\" or \"ifup eth0=eth0-work\". See ifup(8). Example of doing this from a script follows.\n#!/bin/sh\nifdown eth0\nifup eth0=home\n\nIf you are using NetworkManager to configure the interface then you can define multiple so-called connections and switch between them using the nmcli command.\n#!/bin/sh\nnmcli con down id  'Wired connection work'\nnmcli con up id  'Wired connection home'\n\nIf you are using neither ifupdown nor NetworkManager and you don't want to use ifconfig then you can use the ip utility.

As the mke2fs man page explains:\n-m reserved-blocks-percentage\n              Specify the percentage of the filesystem blocks reserved for the\n              super-user.   This  avoids  fragmentation, and allows root-owned\n              daemons, such as syslogd(8), to continue to  function  correctly\n              after non-privileged processes are prevented from writing to the\n              filesystem.  The default percentage is 5%.\n\nYou'll note that 5% is exactly the amount of unoccupied space as shown by gparted.\nYou can view the reserved block count by running (as root) tune2fs -l /dev/sda5, and adjust it with tune2fs -m <percentage> /dev/sda5. However, I would strongly recommend against it.\nAs the man page explains, the reserved count is not only used to give root processes some \"wiggle room\" (critical on system partitions), but to reduce fragmentation (especially critical on /home partitions). That 5% buffer provides the filesystem with spare blocks it can use to write files contiguously, rather than having to fragment them into available space scattered all across the disk.\n(The reserved block count is a percentage, rather than a list or range of blocks, because the filesystem doesn't care specifically which blocks are reserved. It can juggle free blocks around as needed, as long as a certain percentage are kept reserved.)\nForcing the filesystem to burn up that last 5% of space will give you a paltry amount of extra storage space, in exchange for sending the fragmentation of your filesystem skyrocketing and degrading performance. If you must reduce the reserved block percentage to gain some space, consider setting it to 4% or 3% rather than 0.\n", "Q: How do I open Skype's contact list when a chat window is open When a user has a Skype chat window open but closes the main Skype window (the contact list), then clicking the Skype icon in Unity only restores the chat window, but not the main Skype window (the contact list).\nHow can one restore the main window without closing the chat window?\n\nA: Click on the Skype indicator icon, and click \"Activate\".\n\n\nA: On my Ubuntu 14.04 with the default unity dock, the Skype application is a big blue icon in the list.

It may not be possible to fix it without a Windows system to check from, but according to the first answer to this question it's possible to download a Windows recovery CD that would allow running chkdsk.\nIt is also worth examining the various ntfs tools installed by default, especially ntfsls and ntfscat.  These allow one to manually access files without mounting the filesystem, but for thousands of files it's naturally not very practical, and as such should be considered a last resort.\nThe best solution, in terms of the simplest one with a good chance of success, remains gaining access to a computer with Windows, connecting the hard drive, and running chkdsk /f over the partition in question.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04.1 Server VM doesn't recognize keyboard I installed Ubuntu 12.04.1 Server on sdb2 with this iso.\nI selected the install minimal virtual machine (after pressing F4) and the installation worked fine.\n(The BIOS knows the keyboard and the grub also does as I can choose the boot device.) \nBut when I boot into the VM via grub, there is the login screen but I can't type my username.\nHow can I configure the keyboard manually?

On 12.10 my battery life is less than 1.5 hours but on 12.04 my battery life is 2.30 - 3.00 hours.\nActually, İt sounds me crazy because sometimes i had to use my laptop portable without ac power.\nCould anyone suggest anything about my problem?\n\nA: General tips:\n\n\n*Install jupiter. More info: Does Jupiter really improve battery power? To me this is a great battery saver since when changing from AC to battery it actually tells the kernel to set parameters to power saving. The deb installer can be found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jupiter/files/\n\n*Try another desktop like Cinnamon . You can install this next to the normal Unity 3D. Unity and Compiz seem to be a bit power hungry. \n\n*Install powertop and see what is causing wake up calls. The less you have the better       \nsudo apt-get install powertop\nsudo powertop\n\nThis AU topic: How to analysis the output of powertop to increase battery lifetime got me this link to a powertop benchmark topic. Conclusion: \"For best power consumption, we should have some pm-utils power.d scripts to put the following device controllers into a low power state: webcam, audio, DRAM, ethernet, wifi, bluetooth, SATA link, and your card slot (MMC/SD)\" \nImportant  If you want to test for wakeups, you need to close EVERYTHING except the base desktop (clean boot recommended), open a terminal, unplug, and start powertop as root. Wait 10, 15 minutes and check the result.\n\n*Check for programs that you never use. If you never use bluetooth disable it from starting (boot up manager).\n\n*Check the lesswatts.org website for general pointers. Though some of these seem to be already active in 12.10. For instance: VM writeback is set to 60.000 (weird thing: powertop claims it is bad). \n\n*Check power management for less aggressive options. Dim the display. Spin down the hard drive when possible.\n\n*... and of course check websites like Ask Ubuntu, Phoronix or OMG! Ubuntu! for tips. \n\n", "Q: Change swap size after upgrade I have just upgraded my cpu/mobo/RAM and I would like to now increase the swap size without having to reformat my entire drive.

I get noticeable screen tearing on VLC, Totem, gnome mplayer and Mplayer. I have tried fglrx drivers and now the experimental AMD drivers.\nI have a Radeon HD6950 and enabling 'tear free' mode in catalyst removes the tearing but makes my videos have a strange motion, like a stuttery framerate.\nAny way to fix this?\n\nA: There is much better performance of AMD cards from both the open source driver and the Radeon driver from ATI since 12.04. Upgrade to the latest version of Ubuntu 15.10 or 16.04.\nFor future travellers there are two issues with video playing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Playback refresh, the tearing mentioned above is caused by the frame rate and the playback rate being different and the display method refreshing scan lines instead of whole frames as a cached block.\n\n\nThis issue can be solved by using a video driver that takes advantage of the graphics drivers different ways of caching content and quickly displaying it all in one go. Effectively syncing each frame to the refresh of the screen.\n\n\n*\n\n*Decoding time, video is almost always encoded in a file which needs to be unpacked in real time. This puts a large demand on the processor to run very complex maths just at the moment you need that particular frame. If your processor is slow, old or broken (or in power saving mode) you may notice performance issues such as stuttering and frame rate reduction.\n\n\nThis issue is harder to solve; you could always buy a new computer of course. But the main way is to offload the decoding from the inefficient CPU to a dedicated video decoding chip that a lot of modern video cards have. You need three things for this to work. a. that the driver supports the chip, b. that the video program supports hardware acceleration c. that the video file is of a format supported by the chip.\nSo should the stars align for you, it is possible to get better video playback, even with an older machine.\n", "Q: Are WebApps not working as intended? So I was just trying out the Ubuntu 12.10 webapps feature, but they don't seem to be working as they should. I notice a few things that (to me) don't work as intended, or shown of in some videos.\n\n\n*\n\n*Most of them don't integrate with the messaging menu, even if they should. For example, as far as I heard, the GMail WebApp should show in the messaging menu, but it's not there at all. Also, I don't get notifications if a new email arrives.\n\n*When you activate a WebApp (for example, Twitter) it won't focus, but instead gives focus to Firefox, which doesn't feel right to me. (there is no arrow on the right side of the Twitter application, it's on Firefox instead).\nSo right now, the WebApps just feel like glorified bookmarks to me and don't really provide the integration that Canonical announced. Do more people have this problem, or am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: GMail doesn't show up in the messaging menu!\nWell, if this is what you mean, for me it does:\n\nSo, this is probably \"just you\" or a bug of some sorts.\nSome people have the exact opposite problem however - webapps that are still there, although they were removed.\nThey only give focus to [Browser]!\nWell, yeh. That happens for me as well, and as far as I can tell is perfectly intentional.\nWebapps act indeed as \"glorified bookmarks\", as you call them, as they're essentially part of a plugin. They definitely need some improvements (at which point Launchpad comes in handy to suggest them).\nInterestingly the focus pip is given to some users. Chromium in particular. (Screenshot from this probably slightly related bug report on Launchpad)\n\nConclusion\nThe answer boils down to \"It's a bunch of bugs and probably-intended features.\"\nGetting in touch with the WebApps Project team on Launchpad is probably the best course of action, as we can't really help with bugs, and whether or not what of these is a bug is complicated at this stage of development.\nI'm sorry we can't help more, and I hope this gets resolved quickly.\n", "Q: Getting character key code mappings in Ubuntu I am trying to play around with some keyboard layouts in Ubuntu.

For example when I type in\nsudo showkey\n//I get the response in the form\nkeycode num press/release\n\nI was just wondering if I have the keycode, can I get the character mapping back so that I know which character I actually pressed?\n\nA: Run xev from a terminal.

How to make it more complete than before? I search for login screen setting, and I don't find it. Someone can help me? I'm still beginner and wanna learn more for Linux especially Ubuntu.\n\nA: Changing Your Session Type\nTo change your session type and get a different GUI, log out. Then you have a login screen. It's not necessary to change anything in your settings, nor is it necessary to disable automatic login (which I presume you have enabled).\nTo log out, click the Ubuntu logo icon at the upper-right corner of the screen (the same one you click to access System Settings), and click Log Out....\nOn the login screen, you can select your user and log in (with your password--the one you set up when you installed Ubuntu, the same password you'd use to unlock the screen or install software). You can also select your desktop environment.\n\n\n*\n\n*Previous versions of Ubuntu hide the menu where you can select your interface in a little square icon (which shows the GUI's logo, which by default is an Ubuntu logo for Unity). But this setting is available right on the login screen before 12.10, too.\n\n\nSelecting a More \"Classic\" Session Type\nUbuntu 11.04 was the last version that had GNOME 2. After that, it's been GNOME 3. Ubuntu Classic was a GNOME 2 interface, and thus has not been supported since then.\nHowever, a GNOME Fallback session is in many ways (not all ways) similar to Ubuntu Classic; you might like that interface. You can get this by installing the gnome-session-fallback  package. Then select GNOME Classic for \"Desktop environment\" on the login screen.\nOther alternatives that may interest you are two alternative desktop environments: Xfce [wikipedia] and LXDE [wikipedia].\n\n\n*\n\n*To get Xfce on Ubuntu, install xubuntu-desktop  and select Xubuntu Desktop as the session type.\n\n*To get LXDE on Ubuntu ([wiki]), install lubuntu-desktop  and select Lubuntu Desktop as the session type.\nBoth desktop environments have traditional design--expanding, nested application menus and a window list embedded in a panel.\nGetting More Settings (Like the old \"GNOME Control Center.\")\nThe old version GNOME Control Center is no longer available in Ubuntu 12.10. The new System Settings have replaced it (coalescing into its current form over the last few Ubuntu releases).\nAs Rinzwind suggested, you can use Ubuntu Tweak (more info here) to get a variety of additional handy settings--but as Rinzwind said (and can be confirmed by looking at the categories of settings available), it doesn't add much that's related to user accounts.\nFortunately, the old Users and Groups utility is still available. (This dates back from even before the GNOME Control Center itself was introduced. It's still around because other supported desktop environments--Xfce and LXDE--don't have GNOME's control center.)\nThe old Users and Groups utility is provided by the gnome-system-tools  package.\nTo run it, press Alt+F2 and run users-admin. (Do not run it as root, that doesn't work. Instead it calls out to PolicyKit internally, to perform administrative tasks.)\n\n\nFor more information about alternative ways to administering user accounts, see my answer to How to manage users and groups?.\n", "Q: Acroread Package not Found Just installed Ubuntu 12.10.

If I had to guess, I'd say that you installed Ubuntu in EFI mode but it didn't quite work for some reason, and then you booted the Boot Repair tool in BIOS mode and it got a little confused and installed a BIOS-mode GRUB; however, it could be that they installed in the opposite order.\nIn any event, you should probably do what the error message suggested:\nPlease write on a paper the following URL:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/1552313/\n\nIn case you still experience boot problem, indicate this URL to:\nboot.repair@gmail.com\n\nBeyond that, you could try downloading the CD or USB flash drive image of my rEFInd boot manager and write it to a disk. It's possible, but far from certain, that it will get Windows and/or Ubuntu booting from rEFInd. If you have luck with it, you can then work from there on a longer-term recovery. To boot Ubuntu, you'll need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch rEFInd\n\n*Highlight one of the Linux kernel options (to boot vmlinuz-{something})\n\n*Hit F2 or Insert twice to open the kernel options editor\n\n*Add ro root=/dev/sda1 to the options\n\n*Press enter\n\n\nIf this works, you can run the install.sh script to install rEFInd on your hard disk.

I was under the impression that the following command will search for, and list all Java files starting from the current directory and recursing down.\nHowever, if I have a Java file in the root of my home directory, it lists that one, and then stops.  \nIs find supposed to stop at the first match, even with a wildcard?  I guess I have a misconception about the usage.  Thanks for any enlightenment.\nfind . -name *.java\n\n\nA: The wildcard pattern *.java is expanded by your shell before it is passed to the find command. If you have a single file foo.java in the current directory, then the shell executes the command find . -name foo.java. If you have two files bar.java and foo.java, the command find . -name bar.java foo.java is executed and find complains of a syntax error. If there is no matching file in the current directory, then the shell leaves the pattern unexpanded, so find . -name *.java is executed as you desire.\nTo tell the shell not to expand the pattern, so that it is always passed as-is to find, quote it:\nfind . -name '*.java'\nfind . -name \"*.java\"\nfind . -name \\*.java\n\n", "Q: How can I change the volume of a specific program?

When visiting a supported site Firefox shows a pop-up message asking if you want to install a WebApp (for instance facebook, pandora, etc). If you accept, the corresponding package is installed (for instance unity-webapps-facebookmessenger, unity-webapps-pandora-com, etc) which among other things involves copying files under folder /usr/share/unity-webapps/userscripts/ (no root password is requested during the process).\nMy question is: how all this is possible since Firefox is running without root privileges?

If not, it will open a full-screen explorer, and :q will close vim.\nIf you want to force the split-screen explorer even when the opened file has not been modified, or if no file has been opened, use :Sexplore instead. \nYou can also use a tabbed full screen explorer with :Texplore, that probably behaves exactly the way you want. It will open the explorer on a new tab, and typing :q will always close that tab, but not vim.\nPlease take a look at the Vim documentation about these commands.\n\nA: In Vim 8 (I haven't tried earlier versions) :Rexplore will work.\nIn :help :Explore it mentions:\n:Rexplore            ... Return to/from Explorer\n\n:Rexplore only actually works when you are in the Explorer.\n:Lexplore is also a very nice option, as it will open the vertical explorer, but opening any file from there will open the file in your original window. Then you can close the explore window by typing :Lexplore again. This effectively then works similar to other file explorers like NERDTree or as in editors like Sublime Text. This is different behaviour from :Sexplore / :Vexplore / :Texplore which open the file in the same window as the Explorer.\n\nA: :bd work, but if you're open NerdTree, this will close NerdTree and with :Rex, everything works perfectly.\n", "Q: How do I listen to radio hidden in flash players in audacious? This question has been asked before but was misunderstood. Just like the asker in the other thread, my goal is not to install flash in my browser so I can hear flash-based radio in the browser.

I don't understand it (if you do please explain it) but he used to get di.fm urls seen here.\n\nA: Install Wireshark (wireshark in the repositories), and then follow the process for finding the radio stream URL:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close all other applications, except the browser.\n\n*Close all tabs in the browser, except the one that loads the web radio page.\n\n*Capture the whole traffic of your system, while you listen to the radio stream. HINT: You must start the capture before you click on the \"Play\" button/link.

However, rumors about CCSM's wanton stability would prevent me from becoming too experimental about this...\nWho's Expo's maintainer? Who could just \"add that line of code\" ?\nThanks.\n\nA: Just install compizconfig-settings-manager and run ccsm.\nOn the Expo panel, open the Behavior tab, and lower the Zoom time to its lowest value.

I was thinking to make my Ubuntu desktop machine in file server for using it at home .\nI am having one old laptop . Could I use it as a file server so my other 4 system can download data or view data from that old machine (server). I want to make it wireless and want to access over the internet also  , and have a router . But I don't have any idea how doing it on Ubuntu Desktop or Ubuntu server.\nI don't want to install Ubuntu server .\nWant to Share all of my Drive . \nWant Some Password or some kind of security for some folder to restrict access .\n*I am seeing for Step by Step Guide how I can do it and How to access from other computer also * . \nI tired using filezilla but in Ubuntu it is only client based application is available.\nIt there anything like filezilla server in ubuntu .\nThe other system is on windows as well as Ubuntu .\nI am new to networking and server type thing any help would be appreciated .   \n\nA: well you can do that with samba file server.\nyou can install it by sudo apt-get install samba\nFirst, edit the following key/value pairs in the [global] section of /etc/samba/smb.conf:\n   workgroup = EXAMPLE\n   ...\n   security = user\n\nThe security parameter is farther down in the [global] section, and is commented by default. Also, change EXAMPLE to better match your environment.\nCreate a new section at the bottom of the file, or uncomment one of the examples, for the directory to be shared:\n[share]\n    comment = Ubuntu File Server Share\n    path = /srv/samba/share\n    browsable = yes\n    guest ok = yes\n    read only = no\n    create mask = 0755\n\n    comment: a short description of the share. Adjust to fit your needs.\n\n    path: the path to the directory to share.\n\nThis example uses /srv/samba/sharename because, according to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), /srv is where site-specific data should be served. Technically Samba shares can be placed anywhere on the filesystem as long as the permissions are correct, but adhering to standards is recommended.\nbrowsable: enables Windows clients to browse the shared directory using Windows Explorer.\nguest ok: allows clients to connect to the share without supplying a password.\n\nread only: determines if the share is read only or if write privileges are granted. Write privileges are allowed only when the value is no, as is seen in this example. If the value is yes, then access to the share is read only.\ncreate mask: determines the permissions new files will have when created.\n\nNow that Samba is configured, the directory needs to be created and the permissions changed. From a terminal enter:\nsudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/share\nsudo chown nobody.nogroup /srv/samba/share/\n\n[Note]  \n\nThe -p switch tells mkdir to create the entire directory tree if it doesn't exist. Change the share name to fit your environment.\n\nFinally, restart the samba services to enable the new configuration:\nsudo restart smbd\nsudo restart nmbd\n\nCredit goes here:Samba & for more information also you view that.\n\nA: Installing openssh-server would enable you to access your entire drive securely over the internet or from devices in your home, as long as they support sFTP. If any don't for any reason, a Samba share could supplement that as detailed in another answer. Here's how I set mine up:\nInstall OpenSSH Server: apt-get install openssh-server\nOpen up port 22: There are a number of ways of doing this, I use gufw (you might need to install it, I'm not certain if it's default). If you want to open it up to the internet at a later stage, you'll need to forward port 22 to the server from your router. You can normally do this via a web interface on the router. If you can, assign the server a static ip there too (ie turn DHCP off for the server).\nEdit the ssh config settings: Back up and open the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config and change/add the settings\nPermitRootLogin no\nAllowUsers guarav_java other_user_if_necessary\n\nFor maximum security, you can set up key-based logins as detailed here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys, but it would suffice if you just set up a really strong password and saved it on each client machine.\nYou might like to create a user for each person connecting. If you do that, you can add them all to the same group (ssh_users, say) and allow everyone in that group to connect using AllowGroups ssh_users. (For more information see http://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/learning/how-do-i-permit-specific-users-ssh-access)\nCheck the settings are valid: You can check if you've made any syntax error in the config file with sshd –t\nConnect from the server to itself: At this point you should be able to connect to the machine from itself in a terminal by ssh localhost (assuming you already have openssh-client). Then try it from another machine on your network, ssh <ip-address>.\nIf the server's ip is static on your home network, you can add an entry to /etc/hosts on an Ubuntu computer connecting to it with the line\nserver_ip_address        theserver\n\nThis will mean you can connect with simply ssh theserver, or whatever you called it. You can do the same for Windows (see here: http://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-7/windows-7-hosts-file/)\nConnecting via sFTP: If you can connect to the server from another machine on your home network in a terminal, you can connect to it via sFTP and browse and transfer files securely. Personally, I set up a keyboard shortcut so I can mount/unmount my server with keyboard commands (on Ubuntu):\ngvfs-mount sftp://user@ipaddress\ngvfs-mount -u sftp://user@ipaddress\n\n(The -u flag is the umount command)\nPut those into the \"Command:\" box of System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts > + (New shortcut), give it a name, click Apply, then click the right column and enter a key combination (CTRL+SHFT++ and CTRL+SHFT+- respectively seem logical).\nYou can replace the ip address with what is in /etc/hosts. This will mount the server as a drive in Nautilus and you can browse the folders just like those on your local computer. In Windows, you could connect using FTP software (Filezilla etc.). I've not tried it but I'm sure there is probably sFTP integration in Windows Explorer itself too.\nAnother advantage of key-based logins at this point is that you aren't prompted for a password each time you connect (unless you set one up to protect the key). You might like to look into it after you've got it working with password logins (and before opening up it to the outside).\nConnecting from outside: The final step would be to see if you can connect from the internet, ie next door or whatever. If you haven't got a static ip address for your home, it could be tricky keeping up with what your ip address is. I use a dynamic dns service (http://afraid.org/ is a free one) personally, but you might find another solution better. Then you would replace the ipaddress in the above mount commands with the dynamic web address which points to your home network.\nOne final security hint, keep tabs on your SSH log if you go for this (/var/log/auth.log), just to make sure nothing untoward is happening. If you find it is, Fail2Ban is one solution (http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fail2ban). To minimize the risk you can change the port SSHD listens on to something non-standard like 500, and changing the corresponding port forwarding rules on your router and the firewall of the server (Why: https://serverfault.com/questions/189282/why-change-default-ssh-port) though I haven't personally tested that with gvfs-mount.\n\nA: Right click on a folder you want to use as your main public directory, go to \"Sharing Options.\" A popup dialogue will appear that instructs you with install prompts for additional packages needed to properly run a home server, install, reboot, repeat and allow folder sharing. Its that simple! :)\n\nA: Since you want a GUI based server (Which is an Ubuntu Desktop transformed into a awesome server ;) ) then just do the following steps before proceeding:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update everything. Make sure you have already updated and upgraded the system\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade \nThis way we are on the same page.\n\n*Make sure your wireless card is working correctly. If you happen to have a Broadcom based wireless card check the Installing Broadcom Wireless Drivers . If you have another it is very likely you will find the answer in askubuntu after searching for it with the name of the wireless card. Anyway I will assume that it is working correctly.\n\n*Install Samba Service and configure it by following the How to turn on Network Discovery and Share between computers with Samba\n\n*Installing SSH Service (mostly to help ease your way between 2 Ubuntu computers) by following the How to enable file sharing between two PCs? .

This will improve the bandwidth usage in general and it will feel like the internet is faster for all client PCs. To install follow the first answer in the What Updated Web Cache Servers are available (Caching HTTP Proxy) (By Rinzwind)\nRemember to configure squid proxy in /etc/squid/squid.conf or /etc/squid3/squid.conf for site permissions, what should be reversed cached and other stuff.\nAfter doing this 7 steps we should have a system that\n\n\n*\n\n*Can share a folder with other computers in the LAN and they can see the shared folder without too much hassle, permissions or additional steps.\n\n*Can connect to the server via SSH or Samba sharing with no problem.\n\n*The server can share internet via a wireless or wired connection.\n\n*The server can now share a printer to all other computers including Windows like ones.\nLet me know if any of this steps seems difficult to help you along the way.\nAdditional stuff can be to install xbmc and put all movies on the server. Then via the xbmc configuration options, enable web service so the rest of the computers can watch movies from the same server.

Errors happen. \nBut when you've been coding for 18 hours straight to pure silence / soft music and this monstrosity occurs - well you could end up flinching and falling backwards out of your chair (which may or may not have happened just 10 minutes ago.) \nCan I mute, or otherwise change this sound? \n\nA: you can disable event sounds from Ubuntu Tweak.If you haven't installed it then you can do it by \n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa \n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nThen after installing it , type as Ubuntu and it will display the tweak Icon and from the tweaks as shown in the image you can disable them.\n\n\nA: You could just mute the speakers. You can do this by:\nPress Fn+F7 (In my case it's this, if it is not this then look at the 'F''s and you should see a button with a Speaker crossed over it)\nOr the simplest way: Just mute it from the menu.\nHope this helps you! :-)\n", "Q: how to add kernel boot parameters \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I add a kernel boot parameter? \n\nI'm looking for a way to fix this bug the way described here.\nBut I don't know how to edit boot options in Kubuntu. In my distribution there's no /boot/grub/menu.lst file and also the grub.cfg in same folder does not have a line starting with kernel.\nI'm really clueless about adding these options!\n\nA: The /boot/grub/menu.lst was a very old way of configuring GRUB and it's boot options. I think I used to use it like that in Ubuntu 10.10 and below. Right now, if you are using a updated version of Kubuntu, the option should be in /etc/default/grub\nJust do something like:  \nsudo nano /etc/default/grub (To edit via terminal)\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub (To edit via GUI)\nThe option you want to edit is:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nYou can either add what you want after the splash parameterin the first line or add inside the quoted part in the second part.\nAfter that, save the file and type in the terminal update-grub so the grub gets updated and adds what changes you have done to the boot part.

Ive installed Ubuntu onto an SSD in EFI mode and moved over to the system in question but it will not even see it, same as the live cd. I click on the medium in the BIOS to boot from and nothing happens. Secure boot is disabled. Is this because the CPU is not supported?

See if that helps.\nAlso, try installing \"gnome desktop environment\" because it's quite lite on system resources\n\nA: If you have the bandwidth and a couple of USB sticks to spare, I suggest you try out Xubuntu which uses the Xfce environment and Lubuntu which uses the LXDE environment (and the Openbox window manager) as Live USBs and see how well either plays with your hardware. Using an official Ubuntu derivative which is less demanding on resources may be preferable to falling back to an older version.\nThere are other possibilities such as just installing a lighter desktop on your existing set-up. You will then be able to try out different environments at the time of logging in.\nTo get the Xubuntu desktop, you'd use sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\nTo get the Lubuntu desktop, you'd use sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop \nYou could also be more \"minimal\" and go for sudo apt-get install xfce4 which will give you just the Xfce 4.10 experience or sudo apt-get install lxde to get the LXDE/Openbox experience.\nAlthough having multiple desktops in the same installation is usually not a problem, my preference is to stick with a pure installation of any distro.   \n\nA: It might be a kernel issue that is causing the problem.

This appears when I start my system:\n speech-dispatcher disabled :edit/etc/default/speech-dispatcher\n saned disabled: edit/etc/default/saned\n  * Checking battery state OK\n\nAfter this nothing happens. Checking battery state doesn't come to an end and I have to try to reboot the system again and again until tty1 window appears which is then followed by a low graphics mode error.\nI am using the Intel graphics card; the dedicated AMD Radeon 7700 is disabled. I don't want to use the AMD one but want to have a smooth operation with the Intel one. I have tried re installing the X.org drivers for Intel but still have the error of low graphics. I am not sure whether the two problems are related to each other or not.\nToday I am facing a new problem. I can't login into my original user account. Whenever I enter the password the screen blinks and prompts for the password again. So I have to login as a different user. But the original problem of \"saned disabled\" still exists. When when I try Ctrl+Alt+F1 and startX I get the following error. \nFatal server error.\nNo screens found. \n(EE). \nPlease consult the The X.Org Foundation Support for help.\n(EE) Please also check the log file at \"/var/log/Xorg.1.log\" for additional information.\nxnit: giving up.\nxnit: unable to connect to X server : Connection refused.\nxnit: server error. \nxnit: timeout in locking authority file /home/user name/.Xauthority`.\n\nThen I have no options but to try rebooting the system again and again until I get to login in Graphical Mode where I can't login as the original user. \n\nA: The initial messages you see are just the output of the various packages running below what you (normally) see as the graphical interface. I recently had the same login loop problem; it was caused by an overly-specific autogenerated xorg.conf file (found in /etc/X11/xorg.conf).\nTry re-generating your Xorg.conf file using\nsudo Xorg -configure\n\nAlternatively, you could even rename your existing xorg file and reboot to make the X server automatically detect the environment. Without the configuration file, it should automatically load the Intel integrated drivers and use your monitor's native resolution.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS: ReverseDDC is not working correctly When I enter: man radeon\nI get the output:\nOption \"ReverseDDC\" \"boolean\"\nWhen BIOS connector informations aren't available, use this option to reverse the mapping of the 2 main DDC ports. Use this if the X server obviously detects the wrong display for each connector. This is typically needed on the Radeon 9600 cards bundled with Apple G5s. The default is off.\nEvery time I boot I am met with a low resolution login screen, which is fine, but when I enter my password to boot into the desktop environment I'm met with a No Signal message on the screen and I have to physically switch the connector port.

Let me ask it in an other way.\nI have a ubuntu pc, a wireless router and an android tablet IN THE JUNGLE.\nNo internet what so ever, just a wireless signal from my router.\nHow can I set this up that I have a permanent link (share) between the pc and tablet. \nThe pc shares to the tablet and the tablet to the pc.\nShould I wire the pc to the router on the wan port or the lan port ?

The answer is unfortunately as specific as the make and model of the hardware you have.\nMost wireless APs can also act as routers, and you can access the web configuration to set up the networking information (depending on the model of Wireless AP). There are a number of ways you might want to set up the network, which is not clear from your question. It is also unclear to me what is providing the Internet connection - is it the Android device, or is it a cellular connection provided by the car (awesome if so!), or something else? In most cases, it is best to let the device acting a the Internet gateway to also manage the network in terms of handing out DHCP leases, NAT and routing, if you want to use Internet inside your car. If you don't, then the default gateway becomes irrelevant in your network setup.\nBased on what I can understand from your question, you have 3 wireless-enabled devices that you want to connect to the network; the Ubuntu notebook PC, your Android device, and the car's entertainment system itself (which is using XBMC to play media). I would suggest that you have the Wireless AP act as DHCP server, leasing IP addresses to all devices. This solution requires no wires at all (apart from the one running from the car's 12V socket to a transformer that will power the access point). Alternatively, the wireless access point could use an ethernet cable attached to the notebook's wired ethernet, but it's not necessary. The AP then hands out IP addresses to all devices, and you can stream media from your android device to the XBMC controller.\nTo set it up, you'll need to find out some details about your wireless AP (you can do a google search for the make and model), and access its web administration interface with a browser while it is powered on. Typically you are putting the AP into \"DHCP server mode\", where you configure the basic network parameters you want (IP address range and subnet, and gateway - only applicable if you have or want Internet access in the car). The other wireless devices will then connect to it just like your Wireless at home.\n", "Q: 12.10 Login Screen Skipped, Just begins session so ive got windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10 dual booted with Windows 8 bootloader and grub timeout set to 0.\nWhen it boots i dont even see the orange logo with the orange dots (loading screen) just a blank scrren think a flicker of a purple one, but then i see my fully logged in unity session, i have a password set, i did set it to prompt for login during the instalation and if i go into my user accounts the automatic login is off??\nIve seen this :http://askubuntu.com/questions/100010/no-password-asked-at-login-screen-just-start-session-button-with-lightdm/245432#245432\nbut i have no clue how to get gnome system tools, if someone has the ppa please share :) \nHoping for it to show me the login screen every time i boot, and ask for password, note i can access the login screen by locking the Pc.\n\nA: seem to have fixed it by constantly typing \nsudo gpasswd -d username nopasswdlogin\n\nalthough it never reprted a sucess the problem is fixed:D\n", "Q: Wireless Issues on Toshiba C855D Satellite \nPossible Duplicate:\nToshiba Satellite C850, Wlan, rtl8188ce not working \n\nI just bought a Toshiba C855D satellite yesterday and installed 12.04 this morning without a problem.  on the first boot up, I had no issues with wireless at all until I installed updates and restarted my computer.

I run windows 7. I run a Minecraft server, but I can only host around 9 players before lag appears. \nI heard that Ubuntu can run a server with much better performance than Windows 7. I kind of like the whole idea of Ubuntu, but I don't want to change my OS to Unix or anything else.\nBasically, my question is, does running a server (specifically and Minecraft server) run easier and faster on a Ubuntu server? On top of that, how would one set that up?\n\nA: Ubuntu would be a superior choice for hosting a server based application, especially if you use the server edition of Ubuntu.  There would be less resources diverted to unnecessary things, like the desktop interface.  The downside is that it would be command line only.  You can always still go with Ubuntu desktop if you need a desktop interface.\nTo setup a Minecraft server with ubuntu, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that you have the necessary Java packages installed.\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre-headless\n\n\n*After you install Java, download either Bukkit or vanilla Minecraft server.  Bukkit allows you to install plugins for server customization.\nTo get Bukkit (latest beta version as of post date):\nmkdir ~/minecraft && wget -O ~/minecraft/server.jar http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/craftbukkit/get/01804_1.4.7-R0.1/craftbukkit-beta.jar\n\nTo get vanilla Minecraft Server:\nmkdir ~/minecraft && wget -O ~/minecraft/server.jar https://s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload/launcher/minecraft_server.jar\n\n\n*Then, all you have to do is run Minecraft using this command:\ncd ~/minecraft && java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui\n\nYou can increase the allowed RAM usage by modifying the \"1024\" number in both locations in the previous command.  This will help performance if you can spare the extra RAM.\nIf you decide to use Ubuntu desktop, you can always get extra resources by stopping the desktop interface.  To disable: sudo service lightdm stop, and to enable: sudo service lightdm start.\n\nA: To start automatically, and download the latest beta:\nmkdir ~/minecraft && cd ~/minecraft && wget -O ~/minecraft/server.jar http://dl.bukkit.org/latest-beta/craftbukkit-beta.jar && java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar\n\n", "Q: How to mention a folder in a network?

No application is registered as handling this file.\" If I attempt to open the drive from the launcher, nothing happens.\nAny idea why this might be happening?\n\nA: This has something to do with the ACLs (access control lists). I'm not sure when the problem started (I think with release 12.10), but ironically it happened to me last week so I knew what to look for.\nAnyway here is the low down... if you check the access control list on the Wubi install it looks like this:\n# file: media/bcbc\n# owner: root\n# group: root\nuser::rwx\nuser:bcbc:r-x\ngroup::---\nmask::r-x\nother::---\n\nWhereas on the migrated install it looks like this:\nbcbc@23:34:50:~$ getfacl /media/bcbc\ngetfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names\n# file: media/bcbc\n# owner: root\n# group: root\nuser::rwx\ngroup::r-x\nother::---\n\nAs you can see it's missing this: user:bcbc:r-x\nSolution\nThe simplest solution is to remove the directory as it gets recreated automatically (substituting your username in place of bcbc):\nsudo rmdir /media/bcbc\n\nOr you can simply reinstate the ACL by running the following command (again substituting your username, twice):\nsudo setfacl -m u:bcbc:rx /media/bcbc\n\nThis is what it looks like:\nbcbc@23:34:53:~$ sudo setfacl -m u:bcbc:rx /media/bcbc\n[sudo] password for bcbc: \nbcbc@23:35:42:~$ getfacl /media/bcbc\ngetfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names\n# file: media/bcbc\n# owner: root\n# group: root\nuser::rwx\nuser:bcbc:r-x\ngroup::r-x\nmask::r-x\nother::---\n\nbcbc@23:35:44:~$ \n\nI've marked it as an issue on the migration script (wiki and github) and will fix it in the next release, probably need to add the -A option to the rsync commands to copy across the access control list.\n", "Q: Where are logon and startup scripts for graphical settings located and how are they managed?

The main thing is the should only apply to logging to Ubuntu or Gnome destkop, not logging on at the console.\n\nA: Programs that start at login in a graphical environment are called from .desktop launcher files in ~/.config/autostart and in /etc/xdg/autostart/. Here are the specifications for the autostart launchers. It's basically just a special case of the normal .desktop specification\n\nA: Usually, individual applications store their data/configurations in ~/.[program], however, login programs store their initializations elsewhere.\nFor instance, to have something start upon terminal login, you could put it in ~/.bashrc.\nHowever, you want to have it start upon desktop login. For that, you should write a script that executes all the things you do by hand.\nAfter that, set the script to executable (chmod +x [script]).\nLast of all, go to System --> Preferences --> Startup Applications, and add your script to the list.\nThat should be it!\n\nComment if that doesn't solve your problem.\n\nA: It's not an answer per se but just to add some more to what others said - depending on how well you know your system you might want to configure this with GUI. You will probably have to display all apps in gnome-session-properties first, i.e. ignore the Hidden attribute of .desktop files. To do so run sudo gedit /etc/xdg/autostart/print-applet.desktop and change NoDisplay=true to NoDisplay=false.\nOther than that, each autostart .desktop file can contain OnlyShowIn entry, e.g. OnlyShowIn=GNOME; will only run an app in GNOME and not in Unity, LXDE or other environments.\n", "Q: Windows 7 doesn't show in boot menu after installing GRUB and Ubuntu I had a system with windows 7 installed on it.\nFor installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, I installed GRUB.\nNow Ubuntu is working fine.

I have installed Remmina on my laptop home and X11VNC server on the computer in the lab. When I have the laptop in the laboratory I can connect, but when I try it from home I cannot. I do not get any diagnostic messages, just \"connection failed\".\nI figured out that the problem could be that the laboratory network is behind a firewall that prevents the connection from outside the LAN. I have read the documentation on X11VCN and firewalls on:\nhttp://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/index.html#firewalls \nBut, I have no experience with computer networks, so I do not understand what is written there. I tried to learn it by googling the terms I do not understand, but each one leads to many more things I do not understand.\nPlease could you help me in any way?

I realized that the IP adresses given in the System settings and the one given by entering \"IP address\" into Google are not the same. I was using the one given by system settings. I will also try the one given by Google\n\nA: If the sys admins in your laboratory are any good, you can't connect to your work PC from home. Firewalls are in place to prevent exactly that.\nAsk them about a 'VPN Login' which stands for 'virtual private network'. If they enable that for you, you could connect you PC at home to the network at your laboratory, being 'virtually there'. You could then connect as if you were in the laboratory as you have tested already. (And also ask them how to set up your computer at home to use the VPN.)\nIf your admins are not good, you could give it a try. You can make a simple test: go to WhatIsMyIPAddress.com from the PC in the laboratory you want to connect to and from another PC in your laboratory. If they both show you the same IP address, you can not connect. (All your laboratory PCs share the same internet IP, so when connecting from the outside, the system doesn't know which one to connect too. You need your admins' help.)\nThere are ways to circumvent this problems, but they are quite complicated, involve a lot of work on both sides (your PC at home and your laboratory PC), pose a risk to your network infrastructure and you might really get in trouble with your admins. Do you really want to know?\n", "Q: how can i create the customize image with hadoop installation for openstack?

Also, this question might be of interest to you.\n", "Q: How does my sys admin know that I haven't rebooted my system? I got an email from my system administrator saying that I needed to reboot my system to apply some patches. I had forgotten about it and after a couple of hours I got another mail telling me that I was yet to reboot my system.\nI have since rebooted my system but I'm surprised how they'd know if I had rebooted my machine or not. Can someone explain how this works?\n\nA: @saji89 mentioned the uptime command. I'll go one step lower, and simply posit that the sysadmin has a script somewhere that connects to each computer and does a cat /proc/uptime (or something equivalent). The first field of the output is the time, in seconds, since the system was last rebooted, which is much easier to parse than the output of uptime. For example, my computer gives a first uptime field of 1441218.24 with uptime returning up 16 days, 16:20. 1441218 seconds is 16 days plus 58818 seconds, and 58818 seconds is 16 1/3 hours. 16 days 16 1/3 hours.\nWhen you know the maximum length of time since the system should have been rebooted, this data makes it trivial to check to see if the system has been rebooted since then or not.\nIt could be done through a monitoring tool such as Nagios, or through a separate script that the sysadmin keeps on his computer (or rather accessible through it, I'd imagine) which connects to each computer in turn or in parallell and prints the time since last reboot in some format. That all depends on how elaborate to make it.\n\nA: Another way, just for the sake of completeness, is to look at /var/log/wtmp via the last  command.  Example:\n$ last reboot\nreboot   system boot  3.2.0-36-generic Thu Jan 24 16:25 - 17:42 (1+01:17)   \n\nwtmp begins Tue Jan  1 06:30:03 2013\n\nThis method is a favorite because it also happens to be the perfect mnemonic.\nQ: When did the last reboot occur? \nA: Just type 'last reboot'\n\n\nA: When a package that requires a reboot has been updated via apt, a file called reboot-required is created into /var/run/. The sysadmin can check for the presence of this file remotely to determine if a reboot is required due to updates.\n\nA: A quick way to check this remotely can be done using SNMP (provided your SysAdmin has set this up on your network):\nadmin@yourcompany:~$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c <snmpstring> MachineName sysUpTimeInstance\nDISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (9461615) 1 day, 2:16:56.15\n\nMost likely, the data would be polled and stored in a network management/monitoring system of some sort (i.e. Nagios or Cacti).\nIn case anyone is interested in playing around with the snmpwalk command, see the answer here to get a basic SNMP configuration set up on your system.\n\nA: A simple method will be to check the output of the uptime command, which shows how long you have been running the system without a shutdown/restart.\nSample Output:\nsaji@geeklap:~$ uptime\n12:41:29 up  3:08,  2 users,  load average: 1.06, 0.85, 0.86\n\nIt says that my system has been powered on for 3 hours and 8 minutes.\nThe admin can set up a shell script to either make use of uptime or to use some other method, as detailed in this link. Another method the admin can utilise is to setup an email to be send at system shutdown or restart, the details are available at this link.\n\nA: This ...\n\nto apply some patches\n\nis the key part. \nIf the admin is any good he probably set up the updates from HIS machine so the PC's do not have to download the same file from the web. If so he can see from his own machine who downloaded the patches. \nHe then only has to look at the IP addresses of those systems that did load the patches and send and email to those that did not. That email can even be an automatically generated mail. Imagine there are 500 machines. Manually checking each of them is a waste of time if there are several methods where he can do from his own machime.\n1 very important reason for doing it this way: an admin needs to have control on what is happening on the systems he needs to maintain. So he should always have a single point of control (ie. his own machine where he has all the tools) where he can see the status of any machine.\n\nA: There are several valid methods described in the answers. Logging in and checking the uptime would be strange for a large company, but doable for a smaller one. The sysadmin could have been checking via SNMP, but the same \"trouble\" argument could be used there.\nThe most likely situations are, as far as I'm concerned:\n\n\n*\n\n*The sysadmin runs some sort of checking-software, probably Nagios, that checks clusters of computer for problems. Something like the NRPE plugin will be used for most systems and can show you uptime (apart from disc, logged in users, etc).\n\n*A similar method can be used to check what is running where. If the to-be-updated-patches can be checked (what kernel are you using), the \"are all users updated\" script will be still pointing at your computer for being in a 'bad' state.\n\n\nA: If the system is connected to a network he controls, the sysadmin can simply look at the switch or the dhcp server to see how long your network connection has been active. That will also tell him you have not rebooted.\n", "Q: Is it possible to manually define the usable space on my laptop's trackpad? I have an Asus UX21A ultrabook. It's really sweet in most respects. However, there is one issue which to me is a design flaw, though maybe some people think it's a feature.\nThe tracking area of the touchpad and the mouse buttons overlap. I suppose some people might think this was a feature, as it means that potentially you could drag the pointer to somewhere and then click without having to lift your finger. But for me, it just ends up that sometimes when I go to click something, the pointer moves just a bit so that it moves off the thing I'm clicking and the click doesn't register. Especially with the high definition screen, where the pixels are small, which sometimes results in some really tiny interface elements.\nI'd like to be able to change the area that responds to finger movement so that it is separate from the buttons.\nThe current effective tracking area is this, outlined in red:\n\nI'd like to change it so that the tracking area is like this, outlined in green:\n\nIs it possibly to manually configure the touchpad's responsive area in this way?\n\nA: Not sure if this works on all touchpads (I think it should work on Synaptics and ALPS), but you could try and edit your xorg.conf and add \n\nOption \"AreaBottomEdge\" \"XXX\"\n\nSee Ubuntu manpages for more info about the Synaptics driver options.\n\nOption \"AreaBottomEdge\" \"integer\"\nIgnore  movements,  scrolling and tapping which take place below\n  this edge.  The option is disabled by default and can be enabled\n  by  setting the AreaBottomEdge option to any integer value other\n  than zero. Property: \"Synaptics Area\"\n\n\nYou can also try it live by running synclient in terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) with options: \n\n# synclient -l\n\nto list current options and \n\n# synclient AreaBottomEdge=XXX\n\nto change the settings temporarily. When you find the right XXX edit your xorg.conf.\nSee also synclient manpages.\n", "Q: error: unknown filesystem / grub rescue> My hard drive blew out a couple of months back. I bought a new one today and I downloaded Ubuntu 12.10 and put it on a USB. I tried to boot from my flash-drive because it always works. The grub menu does not pop up, (also my USB had to be formatted which deleted the file of Ubuntu I used to have) and I'm guessing it's either a bad version of the OS, or dragging it from folder to folder did not move GRUB with it too, or maybe one of my other drives blew out as well, or something else. I have no clue. \nIf any questions need to be asked, let me know. I also bought a recovery disk that's supposed to come in within the next week or two.

EFI partition is sda1.\nI tried to install Ubuntu in EFI mode and created/selected separate boot partition for Ubuntu boot loader.\nUbuntu installed perfectly, but I got 2 boot entries in EFI setup. When I tried to delete it in EFI setup (bios screen), it restored on restart. \nSo I tried doing boot-repair from live-usb, the thing is it added GRUB2 to my sda partition. And it did not solve the 2 Ubuntu boot entries. So I deleted the Ubuntu partitions (boot/swap/mount) to remove Ubuntu from my laptop.\nNow the problem is that GRUB2 which is in sda is listed in EFI Boot selector (without Ubuntu actually installed).\nCheck this http://paste.ubuntu.com/1554147/\nI need two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I remove GRUB2 from sda partition?\n\n*How to install Ubuntu without getting 2 boot entries? Should I\nselect the sda1 (EFI partition) as boot loader partition when\ninstalling Ubuntu?\n\n\nA: Boot from a ubuntu image in UEFI mode. Select \"Try without installing\".\nFirst run sudo apt-get install efibootmgr (No need an internet connection)\nThen view the entries using sudo efibootmgr -v. Which gives a lot of entries like this:\n$ sudo efibootmgr -v\nBootCurrent: 0000\nTimeout: 0 seconds\nBootOrder: 0000,0001,0003\nBoot0000* rEFInd Boot Manager   HD(1,28,96000,bc34b60c-6611-492f-99b0-d2c37bd77f48)File(\\EFI\\refind\\shim.efi)\nBoot0001* fedora    HD(1,28,96000,bc34b60c-6611-492f-99b0-d2c37bd77f48)File(\\EFI\\fedora\\grubx64.efi)\nBoot0003* ubuntu    HD(1,28,96000,bc34b60c-6611-492f-99b0-d2c37bd77f48)File(EFI\\Ubuntu\\grubx64.efi)\n\nThen try deleting an entry ubuntu using the following code\n$ sudo efibootmgr -b 3 -B\n\n\nA: In EFI, boot loaders are just files. Ubuntu's GRUB is stored as EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi on the EFI System Partition (ESP) -- /dev/sda1 in your case. Thus, to remove GRUB you must remove that file.\nI suspect your fundamental problem isn't really the file, though; it's one of two other things (your description isn't clear enough to identify which is the case):\n\n\n*\n\n*You've got two Ubuntu entries in your firmware's built-in boot manager.\n\n*You've got two Ubuntu entries in GRUB.\n\n\nI've seen Ubuntu create two EFI boot manager entries, and on this system (based on an ASUS motherboard), they seem quite resistant to deletion. Using efibootmgr should delete the extra entry, as in efibootmgr -b 0007 -B to delete entry #7; but the on the system with this problem, the offending entry just keeps re-appearing. Perhaps this is a firmware bug, or maybe there's an Ubuntu startup script that's to blame. This isn't really all that big of a deal, since the computer normally boots to the default entry, so the only time I see the extra entries is if I need to use the firmware's boot manager to switch from my default boot loader. The one thing that got rid of the duplicate entry in my case was completely clearing all of the entries via a firmware update. Thereafter, I ended up with just one entry. Perhaps using efibootmgr to delete both entries would have a similar effect.\nIf you've got two Ubuntu entries in GRUB's menu, they may be there for a reason -- to boot two different kernels or to boot in two different ways (normally and to a single-user mode, for instance). I don't advise trying to adjust that, although if you're determined to do so, you could look for a tool called \"GRUB Customizer\" that's supposed to simplify GRUB configuration. I don't have a URL handy, though.\n", "Q: Intel HD & Ubuntu 12.10 = unknown. Tried SNA enable & PPA add I have an Asus K52F with and Intel HD graphics chip.

Both OS's work just fine.\nBut anyway.. since your computer came preïnstalled with Windows 8, there is a big change that there is a hidden recovery partition somewhere.

I have read pages and pages of wiki and I'm just more confused than ever as to driver and patches to use with the aircrack-ng suite. The card chipset is ath5k but the info is conflicting as to which is the best to use.\ncat /proc/version\nLinux version 3.5.0-22-generic (buildd@lamiak) (gcc version 4.7.2 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.2-2ubuntu1) ) #33-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jan 2 21:45:40 UTC 2013\n\nlsmod | grep ath5k\nath5k                 135206  0 \nath                    19188  1 ath5k\nmac80211              461203  1 ath5k\ncfg80211              175574  3 ath5k,ath,mac80211\n\nlsmod | grep mac80211\nmac80211              461203  1 ath5k\ncfg80211              175574  3 ath5k,ath,mac80211\n\nso do I use ath5k or mac80211 and then do I have to blacklist all the others? or am I good to go as I followed the instructions to get to this point but it just seems really confusing and conflicting.\n\nA: I have had same question, but the answer is:\nAth5k is a new, completely FOSS driver for Atheros cards. Wireless-N-enabled Atheros chipsets should use ath9k instead. Unlike madwifi-ng, this driver is based on the new mac80211 stack, meaning that it requires aircrack-ng v1.0-rc1 or newer.\nAircrack-ng support\nAs of 2.6.27-rc2, ath5k can inject without patches (2.6.26 not tested, <=2.6.25 is known to be broken). However, injection support is a bit flaky, and speeds are limited to about 50~100pps. To improve injection speed, apply this patch. It is recommended that you also apply the mac80211 fragmentation patch for your kernel version, to enable the fragmentation attack. For the released 2.6.27 and 2.6.28 kernels, the mac80211 patch suffices, no extra patch is needed.\nIf you have a kernel older than 2.6.26, it's recommended that you install the latest compat-wireless-old package, and apply the 2.6.27 mac80211 fragmentation patch on the package itself. No ath5k-specific patch is needed for either flavor of compat-wireless.\nNote that in the latest wireless-testing & linux-2.6 kernels, as well as in compat-wireless-2.6 (but not in compat-wireless-old), there is a bug that prevents the fragmentation attack from working properly when no managed interface is brought up on the same PHY as the monitor interface. As a workaround, bring up wlan0 after creating mon0 with airmon-ng.\nSource: Aircrack-ng: ath5k - FOSS driver for Atheros A/B/G/Super-G cards\n", "Q: Can't open LibreOffice I can't open LibreOffice anymore, neither Writer nor Calc. \n\n\n*\n\n*If I try it from the launcher, the icons flash a few times and then\nstop.

In short, the following IPv4 range of addresses are defined in there:\n\n*\n\n*10.0.0.0/8\n\n*172.16.0.0/12\n\n*192.168.0.0/16\n\nOpposed to public addresses, these aren't routed across the Internet and are solely to be used behind NAT in a private network. Many people are using this and therefore absolutely not unique. For this reason it is of no interest to have public DNS servers respond to reverse lookup requests for private ones.\nWhy it isn't working\nGoogle and all other public DNS servers on the Internet aren't interested in private addresses as they're not routable over the Internet. So, basically, you're doing it wrong by asking a server totally not responsible for your network.\nIn case you were looking to override this with a local configuration like in /etc/hosts, this won't work:\n\n*\n\n*Can /etc/hosts config reverse resolution? No.\n\n*Do entries in local 'hosts' files override both forward and reverse name lookups? Yes, but no, actually\nLocal DNS server\nIf you want to be able to do reverse lookups within your private LAN, then you'll have to set up your own DNS server with the appropriate records and have all your local clients using this DNS server. You may already be running one, but you didn't specify anything of it in your question and if you have, you appear not to be using it.\nA quick all-in-one solution I can recommend is Dnsmasq . It's a DHCP and DNS server in one1 with the advantage of using the hostname for DHCP also in DNS. From the manpage of dnsmasq is the following excerpt:\n\nDnsmasq  accepts  DNS  queries  and either answers them from a small,\nlocal, cache or forwards them to a real, recursive, DNS server. It\nloads the contents of /etc/hosts so that local hostnames which do not\nappear in the global DNS can be resolved and also answers DNS queries\nfor DHCP configured hosts.\n\nSetting up a complete Dnsmasq is a bit out of the scope here as it will replace your current DHCP server, which I don't know is an accepted solution. Anyway, for this part of the configuration this setting will be important:\ndomain=mydomain.lan,192.168.1.0/24,local\n\nIn which you tell it to serve the 192.168.1.0/24 network with short hostnames to use the mydomain.lan domain name and will not be forwarded to the upstream recursive DNS server. Result will be that a machine with the hostname myhost requesting a dynamic address will be automatically used in the local resolver and listens to queries myhost.mydomain.lan and the reverse pointer will resolve likewise.\nI'm not aware of a \"How do I set up Dnsmasq for a home network the good way?\" question on this site. If you or others are interested, I'll be happy to Q&A it.\n1 Actually even more, like TFTP server as well.\n\nA: Short Answer: nslookup does not use the /etc/hosts file to do anything.\nLong Answer:\nIt seems like when you run nslookup it will only use the nameservers listed in the /etc/resolv.conf. This behavior is replicated in host as well. If you have the IP addresses listed in the /etc/hosts files you should not need reverse DNS, or vice versa. I believe that was the thinking in this process.\nUpon stracing the process I saw that it did not even look at the /etc/hosts file even though in my /etc/nsswitch.conf I had DNS set to files dns.\nSources: man host man nslookup\n\nA: DNS server applications for finding DNS informations are very rigid and takes more times than comparing to other DNS lookup search sites on internet which is very clear and short.I always look up my DNS queries at WhoisXY.com where it is by simple search to identify the details.\n", "Q: How can I set Déjà Dup to keep backups for less than six months? Déjà Dup allows me to choose whether to keep backups for six months, a year, or forever.\n\nHow do I choose to keep backups for less than six months, say, three months, or even more?\n\nA: You need to modify the Dconf setting at path /org/gnome/deja-dup/, schema org.gnome.DejaDup, key name delete-after. It's set to the number of days to keep backup files on backup location.\nFor example, to set it to 60 days from the command line, run:\ngsettings set org.gnome.DejaDup delete-after 60\n\nYou can also do this from dconf-editor:\n\nThe Backup Déjà Dup utility reacts well to this change, adding it as an option:\n\n", "Q: No menu option in vlc I do use vlc player for watching movies and I dont have any idea what happened with my vlc I am not getting any icons or anything not even time bar...its just the video, no preferences nothing...I know we can get it by ctrl + h , but nothing is happening with that as well.\nI am not getting any option when I hover over to title bar and when I right click anywhere on the video.

I don't have the budget to pay but do have enough to fund hardware, software etc and would cut them in significantly if the products became reality. I don't think the dev effort would be too massive, more a case of bolting existing technologies together.\nI am based in London so someone local would be best.\nCan anyone suggest how I might search for someone who would be interested?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: Looking for unpaid developers this way is a bit unrealistic. You can always post to something like Guru.com but be expected to have to pay. If your looking for developers to start a open source project then try Sourceforge of freshmeat. However, most developers want to be paid one way or another. The open source projects I work on are those that I get benefit from. \nExpecting someone to donate their time for nothing is a bit silly. Expecting that donation of effort to get your idea off the ground is not what open source is about. \nIf you have an idea that you think will benefit the community, then post the full idea to Sourceforge or Freshmeat, ask in language specific rooms on irc.freenode.net and start from there.

Nvidia and Intel support configuration of your displays through xrandr, meaning that if you could (i) save your settings to a file and (ii) automatically set that file as the defaults, you're good to go.\nFor (i), you can use arandr. Just sudo apt-get install arandr and set your configuration. Through File > Save as you can save the configuration as a shell file. For (ii) you could of course load the bash file at boot, but this is an ugly solution I think.\nYou sound like you know what you're doing, deploying computers and all, hopefully this can give you a push in the right direction. If it does helps, please append this post to briefly explain what you have done to get this to work.\nIf memory serves me right, Nvidia allows importing and exporting of the monitor configuration through nvidia-config. At least it did before they started supporting xrandr. This might also be of use...\n", "Q: How to install cndrvcups-common v.2.3 in Quantal?

SCR3340 - ExpressCard54 Smart Card Reader\n\n*ID 076b:a021 OmniKey AG CCID Smart Card Reader. This is the \"official\" card reader coming in the E-ID package as of January 2017.\n\n\nSee also this list for other compatible smartcard readers that work under Linux. The ExpressCard54 versions in there are:\n\n\n*\n\n*SCM Microsystems SCR3340 (as above, used here)\n\n*Gemalto GemPC Express\n\n*OMNIKEY CardMan 4321\n\n\n2. Instructions for Chrome / Chromium\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have either Chromium or Chrome installed. These instructions are tested with both of them. To install Chrome from a repo, use these instructions.\n\n*Install the \"ID Software\" under Linux as per the official instructions. In short, the instructions are:\nwget https://installer.id.ee/media/install-scripts/install-open-eid.sh\nsh install-open-eid.sh\n\n\n*Re-start the computer after the installation of the E-ID software (also try that in case your E-ID login attempts fail). I could not get any E-ID login to work before a restart, it would always fail with \"No certificate could be found\".\n\n*Connect your smartcard reader.\n\n*Insert the Estonian E-ID card into the reader.\n\n*Make sure the smartcard service is in status \"active\":\nsudo service pcscd status \n\nIf necessary start it with: \nsudo service pcscd start\n\nThis step is usually no needed as the service should be started automatically when inserting a card. But just to be sure.\n\n*Start Google Chrome (by executing \"google-chrome\") or Chromium (by executing \"chromium-browser\").\n\n*Visit a website that provides E-ID login to try it out, for example the Company Registration Portal.\n\n*Click the login button to the top right and then the \"Estonian ID-card\" link.\n\n*During the first login, choose the appropriate certificate from the list that will appear in a popup window, and enter PIN1 of your E-ID card to unlock it. This will be remembered for future logins until restarting the browser.\n\n\n3. Instructions for Firefox 64-bit\nThese instructions work only for a 64-bit Firefox on 64-bit Ubuntu – that is. They do not work for 32-bit Firefox on 64-bit Ubuntu (I tried), even though they should according to the available documentation.\nAs of February 2017 and (hopefully) only until March 7, 2017, you will not be able to use all E-ID websites with a 64-bit Firefox, though. You can use for example the Estonian Company Registry already, though. If you need to access other E-ID websites, maybe better use Chrome / Chromium, which does not have the 32/64-bit issue with E-ID use.\nThe reason I got told by id.ee support people (and partially mentioned in the official documentation now) is this: There is a transition underway from the old Firefox NPAPI plugin named \"Firefox Token Signing\" (which does only work in 32-bit Firefox) to the new Firefox extension named \"Token signing\" (which also works in 64-bit Firefox). This is because Firefox will abandon the support for all NPAPI plugins, so the \"Firefox Token Signing\" plugin will stop working soon. This transition also mandates that the E-ID websites update their hwcrypto.js library, which most have not done yet (but the Company Registry has, notably). So for now most of the E-ID websites will try to access your \"Firefox Token Signing\" plugin which works on 32-bit Firefox only, while the \"Token signing\" extension is still quite useless. That will however change soon, as the NPAPI gets retired in Firefox on 2017-03-07.\nNow the installation instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the \"ID Software\" under Linux as per the official instructions, step 1 only (./install-open-eid.sh).\n\n*Connect your smartcard reader.\n\n*Insert the Estonian E-ID card into the card reader.\n\n*Make sure the smartcard service is in status \"active\":\nsudo service pcscd status \n\nIf necessary start it with: \nsudo service pcscd start\n\nThis step is usually not needed as the service should be started automatically when inserting a card. But just to be sure.\n\n*Start Firefox and go to \"☰ → Add-ons → Extensions\". If the list does not contain both \"PKCS11 Loader\" and \"Token Signing\", do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-start the computer and check again if the extensions are now listed.\n\n*Re-install Firefox and check again if the extensions are now listed. This was done in my tests by temporarily installing Firefox 32-bit via sudo apt-get install firefox:i386; sudo apt-get install firefox;. But it should also work by simply uninstalling and reinstalling.\n\n\n*In Firefox, go to \"☰ → Add-ons → Extensions\" and make sure that \"PKCS11 Loader\" and \"Token Signing\" are enabled.\n\n*Visit a website that provides E-ID login to try it out, for example the Company Registration Portal.\n\n*Click the login button to the top right and then the \"Estonian ID-card\" link.\n\n*If an error message (\"Certificate could not be found\") appears, re-start the computer. This is probably only needed once after the installation of the E-ID software, but you can also try it if previous login attempts failed.\n\n*During the first login, choose the appropriate certificate from the list that will appear in a popup window, and enter PIN1 of your E-ID card to unlock it. This will be remembered for future logins until restarting the browser.\nAs of 2020-05 and Firefox 76.0, logins with the Estonian E-ID card (means, using PIN1) are possible without having any E-ID Firefox plugins installed. However, the plugins are required for signing (means, using PIN2). So the ultimate test is trying to sign something, obviously, not a login as shown above.\n", "Q: How to set up script or document to launch from top or side bar? I have searched for information about this, but not found anything directly related to it.\nIs there a way to add a document (for example, a Libre Office file or text file) to open when clicked from the top bar or the side bar?  Similarly, is there a way to permanently  attach an icon to either the top or side bar that when clicked will launch a shell script or a perl script?  Dragging a text file, libre office file, or perl script to the launcher does not seem to work as it does for other applications.\nAny ideas or suggestions on where to look for information about this?\n\nA: What you want to do is create a custom launcher for your scripts/documents.  You can do that in a text editor with the following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName = NAME_TO_DISPLAY\nExec = COMMAND_TO_RUN\nIcon = NAME_OR_PATH\n\nJust save it with a .desktop extension and make it executable. If you save it in ~/.local/share/applications the launcher will be accesible via the Dash.  Dragging it to the launcher bar will fix it there. The exec line to open a document or weblink should just be xdg-open FILE to open with a default program.

This is just an example: it's an issue in other programs too.\nI cannot fix this with keyboard shortcuts settings as described in this Ask Ubuntu answer. There is no such menu item as Keyboard Shortcuts.\nAlso using the trick with the Escape key is not good, as it's a workaround rather than a real solution.\nHow can I simply disable this particular Alt key behaviour?\n\nA: GNOME Connection Manager is intercepting the Alt key combinations for its own menu and refuses to pass it on to the shell it is hosting (where your MC instance is running). This is not configurable.\nThis is a bug in GNOME Connection Manager, or to be precise in the GUI library it uses (Gtk), so the only good solution is to go to their site and report the bug. \nThe other approach is filing a bug with GTK about \"Alt being hardcoded\" but you will need a lot of charisma and endurance to convince them to make Alt configurable. All alternatives will be workarounds, of which the ESC-key trick is the most elegant.\n\nA: There is a workaround which actually works. (tested on Ubuntu 15.10 and Gnome Connection Manager v1.1.0)\nFor me, main problem was with Alt+F which I use very often, but in GCM it shows File menu.\nMy solution is to modify language file (en_US.po) and remove all menu mnemonics (eg. _File to File_).\ncd /usr/share/gnome-connection-manager/lang\nsudo sed -i -e 's/\"_File\"/\"File_\"/g' -e 's/\"_Edit\"/\"Edit_\"/g' -e 's/\"_View\"/\"View_\"/g' -e 's/\"_Servers\"/\"Servers_\"/g'  -e 's/\"_Help\"/\"Help_\"/g' en_US.po\nmsgcat en_US.po | sudo msgfmt -o en/LC_MESSAGES/gcm-lang.mo -\n\nIt will remove all menu shortcuts: Alt+F, Alt+E, Alt+V, Alt+S, Alt+H.\nGnome Connection Manager has also one more hard-coded shortcut: Alt+A (opens \"Add host\" dialog). You can disable it as well in the gnome-connection-manager.glade file:\ncd /usr/share/gnome-connection-manager/\nsudo sed -i 's/(<accelerator key=\"a\" modifiers=\"GDK_MOD1_MASK\" signal=\"clicked\"\\/>)/<!-- \\1 -->/g' gnome-connection-manager.glade\n\n", "Q: Give access to a specific user to a specific folder within a group?

I don't know how. Ctrl+C won't work. I just close the terminal and force quit the process. How do i break out of the while loop as and when the user feels like quitting the program?\n\nA: If you get a blinking cursor you are probably not actually in a loop. You are probably expecting input. Try Ctrl+D. If that doesn't work then open a new terminal and ps aux | grep command where command is the name of the script you wrote and then kill the pid that is returned.  \n\nA: As suggested by this answer or this more detailed one to similar questions on unix.stackexchange.com :\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Z to stop the job, and send it to the background\n\n*kill %% to kill the \"current\" or \"last stopped\" job\n\n\nA: Just an idea.

I have already read through a lot of material, but found nothing for quite what I am looking to do, and I am not sure how or where I should start. \nI have a 120GB solid state drive on which I want to locate the windows and linux OS, as well as other applications that would benefit from the SSD. \nI additionally have a 1TB hard drive that I want to use for data/storage. \nFrom what I have read, I understand that I will need to partition the drive(s) or use Logical Volume Management to set up the dual boot environment that I envision. I hope to share the data stored on the 1TB hard drive between the two operating systems, but if this is not feasible then splitting the 1TB hard drive into two or more smaller partitions would be fine. \nI have previously installed windows to the SSD and 'migrated' the User's folder to my 1TB data drive (without manually setting up a partition or anything).

I want the system to be as stable as possible while maximizing the benefits of using an SSD to boot from/run applications. \n+ Any advice or information would be appreciated!\nThanks!\n\nA: I actually did this for myself a few months ago. The process is a bit long, and read through the entire thing before you make any decisions as to whether you want to do it or not. You will need to change your registry, and although I have not experienced any problems so far, you may if you don't do everything as I did.\nFirst, set up your partitions in a Ubuntu live disk. Copy all your information to a safe volume in case something happens. Then, wipe all your drives.\nInstall Windows first. When you create your account during installation, choose a spare account name. It doesn't matter what this name is, except for the fact that it cannot be the name you want to use in the future. I would call it something like \"spare.\"\nAfter installing Windows, create an account with your real account name, but do not log into it yet. Go into regedit, and change all instances of C:/Users to D:/Users (or whatever drive you have your storage on, be it D:, E:, F:, G:, etc. Don't change anything like C:/Users/Administrator, though, only the ones with C:/Users and the ones that would pertain to you.\nAfter doing this load of registry edits, go and restart your computer and log into your new account. If you've done everything right, your new account's profile should be in the drive you had set it to be.\nIf it is, great. Delete the spare whose account is still on C:/. Do whatever you want on Windows, and after that, install Ubuntu.\nI can expect that you can install Ubuntu without any instruction. During installation, I installed my user folder in the normal directory in the same partition as my main installation. I then created symlinks on my user folders by using the commands:\nrm -r ./Documents\nln -s /media/Storage/Users/Tyler/Documents ./Documents\nrm -r ./Downloads\nln -s /media/Storage/Users/Tyler/Downloads ./Downloads\nrm -r ./Music\nln -s /media/Storage/Users/Tyler/Music ./Music\nrm -r ./Pictures\nln -s /media/Storage/Users/Tyler/Pictures ./Pictures\nrm -r ./Videos\nln -s /media/Storage/Users/Tyler/Videos ./Videos\n\nTyler is my username on Windows, and Storage is the name of my storage partition.\nThese commands don't include the templates and the Desktop folder, although I expect that they would be easy to implement.\nThese symlinks do not have the pretty images, and I have not found a permanent fix for that at this moment. I can set the icon image, but it is reset. I suspect that this is because it needs to mount every time I start up, and that resets the images. I'll post a fix if I find one.\nIf you want to automount your storage partition upon startup in Ubuntu, you'll need find which partition to mount. In a terminal, use\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nYou should receive a list of partitions. Mine looks like this.\ntyler@Tyler-PC:/$ sudo fdisk -l\n[sudo] password for tyler: \n\nDisk /dev/sda: 320.1 GB, 320072933376 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 38913 cylinders, total 625142448 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0xf64a0fce\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   125831167    62914560    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2       125831168   188745727    31457280   83  Linux\n/dev/sda3       188745728   608364543   209809408    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda4       608364544   625141759     8388608   82  Linux swap / Solaris\ntyler@Tyler-PC:/$ \n\nSearch \"Startup Applications\" and add the command\nudisks --mount /dev/sda3\n\nsda3 should be replaced with the one for the disk you have. I had remembered that I had set mine to sda3 when I made my partitions. Also, it is my largest.\nAfter that command, upon startup, you shouldn't need to navigate to your storage partition via nautilus to mount it. I'd only discovered that fix yesterday; as I use Eclipse to develop in Java, needing to mount it via nautilus every time was extremely obnoxious.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Symbolic Links\nI recently setup a new computer for dual booting Ubuntu and Windows and I came up with a solution using symbolic links. I found that symbolic links can be the best thing to setup the two operating systems if you'll be using them both regularly. This guide will walk you through setting up your system to keep all of your personal files on your larger drive and let you access them seamlessly from each OS.\nFormatting\nPartition the SSD as whatever sizes you want with two partitions, I would use 60GB partitions. Use the whole 1TB as NTFS so both operating systems can read it. Windows will need a NTFS partion and Ubuntu will work best with an ext4 partition on the SSD.\nInstall\nI would install Windows first so Ubuntu can setup your boot manager for you. You don't need to do anything to Windows at this point. When installing Ubuntu next set where your large drive mounts when picking where to install to, for more info on this check out this guide. I would recomend mounting to /media/Data/ Once you have them both installed and the 1TB is formated as NTFS you can put all of your presonal files on the big drive. You can also just create empty folders but it's not as easy to visualize.\nLinking\nOnce your files are in place you will need to link them. In both Windows and Ubuntu you will be creating a new \"folder\" when you link so you can't leave the old one there.\nWindows\nIn Windows the command you'll want to use will be mklink /J LINK_LOCATION ORIGINAL_LOCATION so if you have the Windows drive as C: and the 1TB as D: with your pictures in D:\\User\\Pictures you would use mklink /J \"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Pictures\" \"D:\\User\\Pictures\" after deleting the Pictures folder in your user folder.\nUbuntu\nYou will use ln -s ORIGINAL_LOCATION LINK_LOCATION to link in Ubuntu. Note that the directories are switched compared to Windows. So using the picture example again and assuming you mounted the 1Tb to /media/Data you would use ln -s /media/Data/User/Pictures/ /home/USERNAME/Pictures after deleting the Pictures folder in your user folder.\nDone\nAfter this you should be ready to go! Keep in mind you can link  any folder you want off of the SSD. The user folders such as Music, Pictures, Documents, Videos, and even Desktop can all be moved to access from both operating systems. You may also want to move other folders like \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\" or \"/home/USERNAME/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps\" depending on what large programs you plan on using since the SSD has a more limited capacity.\n\nA: Well, I don't know why previous answers suggest to act on registry key or hard links. There is a simple way to do this.\nFirst,partition your SSD. I think 2 partitions are too little. I'm currently using 5 main partitions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Windows: containing Windows OS. Depending on how you use this OS. I think that for a normal user it should be large from 40 to 60 GiB.\n\n*Ubuntu root (/): containing most of Ubuntu system. Again, the size dependes on what you plan to install, but as a standard go for about 20 GiB.\n\n*Ubuntu home (/home): containing the home directory. It is useful to keep your home directory separated from the rest for many reasons. Reserve 5 GiB for your home directory. Follow this link\n\n*linux swap. Well, I think this is a very useful partition and you necessarily need this if you want to use hibernation on Ubuntu. The size mostly depends on how much ram do you have, but I think, but as a general rule my opinion is that it should be at least 1.5 times your ram.\n\n*FastFiles. I'm using this directory for others stuff like standalone applications, VirtualBox hard disks, ... The size again depends on your use.\n\n\nSee more on the argument at this link.\nThen, format your HDD as a NTFS, as suggested before. You want to use just one partition containing all your data.\nTo change your default user directories (Download, Documents, ...)\nN.B.: My suggestion is to move also your Desktop folders on the HDD drive.\nWindows\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/310147\nUbuntu\nThe easiest way to do this is by using ubuntu tweak (sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak). Launch the program and go to Admins> User folder. Then change everything as you want.\nIf you have any trouble, I can help in any way ;)\n\nA: Fine, \nIf you feel comfortable using Gparted then you will have to re-size your partitions.  \nNow, I have noticed that the use below has suggested using 'Wubi.exe', that is an alternative... It has its + & -'s (more later?). \nI have also noticed some advocating:\n\nwiping all your drives, via umop aplsdn \n\nHOLY SMOKES becareful listening to gun slinging cowboys...\nWhen you were in 'Live-user' mode using Gparted did you see several partitions for Windows?  If you did, good.  *Do not delete or change those unless you want to trash Windows. *\n1st, Try to resize the largest windows partition to give Ubuntu 20gb - 60gb. \nQ. How much do you use Windows? How much do you think you would like to load/play with software on Ubuntu?\n2nd, After you have backed up your 'stuff' install Ubuntu from the live-user desktop.  This is helpful for several reasons,  One the wifi or network connection you have will make the updating process go a little more smoothly.\nMore to come...\n\nA: I would start slowly if I were you, i dont say that tongue-in-cheek either.  What I would do first is get a 1 gb thumb drive (or whatever you call it) and download the Ubuntu 'cd' or 'dvd'. Do you need 32 bit or 64 bit? I would take that .iso file and then install it on your thumb drive (using the directions given on the Ubuntu site) and 'play' with it.  DO NOT Install anything yet!  Wait... Run Ubuntu off the usb drive and in live-user mode. See what the software is like... Do all the drivers work?  Does your video and sound card work well? Can you figure out gparted?  \nIn other words, load the Ubuntu o.s. onto the thumb drive so that you boot off of it.  Set you bios to load the os from your thumb drive first and try 'Your' new operating system.  Then try Linux mint, Fedora or anything...same thing download it, put it on your thumb drive and play around with it for a week or so. THEN get ready to start breaking things. ;D\n\nA: You can divide the partition of your drive ,But first you have to enter the Windows OS and Right Click My Computer > and Click Manage > Storage > Disk Management\nAnd Divied the partitions ilke these\nEX: Drive C is for Windows, And Drive D is special for Ubuntu.\nNow you have two partitions C and D\nCopy the Ubuntu ISO and Wubi.exe in Drive D (If u're not using CD)\nIf you're using the CD, just plugin the CD at the boot at usually\nAnd there's must be show a form like this \n\nIt's Ready!, You're Ready to Install Ubuntu in Dual Boot ;)\n\nA: Partition and format your 1TB space into two. One using ext4 for Ubuntu and the other using NTFS for Windows. Ubuntu will be able to detect both your ext4 and NTFS partition though but not will only be able to detect the NTFS. This is the kind of setup I use on my laptop using only one hard disk though and partitioned into 4 drives.\n\nA: You could keep your Windows installation on the SSD and resize its partition to make room to Linux. \nOr you could wipe everything and create new partitions, 1 NTFS for Windows and 2 for Linux (ext4 and swap). \nYou would need to use a program such as Gparted or Easeus.\nSometimes it's advised to remove the hard disk while installing Windows on the other one.\nRemember to configure your BIOS to boot from the SSD.\nThen you can install Windows and later Linux, using GRUB to boot both systems.\nOr you can also use Windows bootloader to boot both systems (google it), it's a matter of taste.\nAnd the other disk, the big one. You could just fully format it as NTFS, allowing both systems to acces it.\nOr you could consider to install again both OS in this disk in case you ever need to repair or access the SSD from the HDD if it gets corrupted for any reason (changing boot order on the BIOS).\nYou should install the software that needs to be loadaded quickly onto the SSD and configure the temp folders and pagefiles to be on the SSD.\n", "Q: How can I change xfce bottom panel to the top?

I think the author of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving forgot to mention that the step Moving /home into /old_home will work only if /home is NOT IN ITS OWN PARTITION. mv /home /old_home will work if home is just another folder. Not if /home has its own partition. If /home has its own partition, then your command mv /home /old_home will never work because fstab will mount that partition on boot and hence the error you are getting. If you have /home as a separate partition, I would suggest ignoring this step. You dont need a backup because when you move to your newer, bigger home partition your old /home partition will just sit there unmounted. Once you are satisfied with your newer home partition, you can format it and reuse the space. \nSo bottomline is if you have /home in its own partition and you followed the steps mentioned in the link above all you have to do is comment out the older home partition in fstab. Otherwise your newer home partition will never be mounted. \nThat's it. Hope it helps someone. \nThanks. \n\nA: \nShould I log out and re-enter as root to issue the command?\n\nYes! Moving your /home while you're logged in is a very bad idea.

Logging out should unmount them. If not, inspect the current mounts with cat /proc/mounts.\n", "Q: Installing on windows 8 \nPossible Duplicate:\n12.10 UEFI Secure Boot install\nInstalling Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed UEFI Supported Windows 8 system \n\nWhen ever I try to boot from a dvd for 12.10, an error messages shows that says that the system was unable to boot windows.  This laptop is a dell insipron 15x, it came installed with windows 8, is there any one who has had this problem before and can help.\n\nA: What is happening is that you are not booting from Ubuntu. I'm not sure why Windows is complaining that you have a boot disk for Ubuntu, however. \nTo boot from Ubuntu, when you first start up your computer, there is something called a BIOS. This is the first screen you see when you start your computer; it should show a Dell logo (as you are on a Dell Inspiron). There, you should see text say \"Press F for more boot options\" or something like that. On the top of your keyboard you should have those F-Keys, or function keys. Press the corresponding key, and you should be lead to a window where you can select which volume you should boot from. Select the correct one, and Ubuntu will boot.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu One support Content-Range?

How do I get this to work?\nActually I just made up this story about a friend.

A certain site only allows the use of either Internet Explorer and Firefox web browsers. \nWhen I open up the dashboard and type firefox in the search, I can't find it. \n\nA: If you search for Firefox and don't find it, that suggests it's not installed.\nTo be sure, open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run:\nwhich firefox\ndpkg -l | grep firefox\n\nIf you get nothing, or all the entries given by the second command start with something other than ii (like rc), then Firefox is not installed.\nYou can install firefox  from the Software Center or by running:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install firefox\n\nIf you get something, try running Firefox from the command-line:\nfirefox\n\nIf that works, then you've solved the main problem (and you can solve the problem of why you cannot run Firefox from the dash at your leisure).\nIf that does not work, then the way it doesn't work will provide valuable diagnostic information about the problem. In that case, please edit your question to include this information (or, for people other than the author of this question: you can search for your problem and post a new question if you don't find a solution).\nI've listed some examples below of how it might not be working, along with some solutions.\n###If the Command-Line Shell Cannot Find Firefox Either\nYou might see an error like this when you try to run firefox:\n\n*\n\n*firefox: command not found\n\n*The program 'firefox' is currently not installed. ...\nThe fix is to Install the firefox package.\nOr if it's installed, reinstall it with sudo apt-get --reinstall install firefox.\n(See below for another, more effective of reinstallation, which really does more than just reinstalling.)\n###Crashing\nYou might get an error that says Segmentation fault, core dumped, assert, assertion, or any combination of those.\nThat means Firefox has crashed. So you should consider reporting the bug. Read this carefully. (This question is a good resource too.) This is a crash, so you'll want to attach a stack trace: here's how that works, here's some privacy considerations (particularly relevant here since information from your Firefox profile might end up attached). Configure Apport to submit crash data for attachment to your bug report. Produce the crash and report the bug. But also try the fix below, as whether or not it works should be noted in your bug report--also, because that can help you use Firefox!\n###General Failure to Run\nIf there is no error, Firefox just hangs without a message, or quits immediately (or crashed as above), there are two fixes/workarounds:\n\n*\n\n*Try running Firefox as another user (or as Guest). Any user-specific problem won't occur.\n\n\n*Your Firefox profile is stored in a folder called .mozilla in your home folder (as suggested in vasa1's comment). Rename it to .mozilla.old (Ctrl+H shows hidden items like this in Nautilus).\nIf you prefer, here's the command-line way:\n mv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla.old\n\nWhichever way you use, make sure Firefox isn't running at all when you do it. (You can run ps | grep -v grep | grep firefox if you like, to check.)\nThen run Firefox, and it should generate a new profile. If the problem was related to or triggered by data in your old profile, renaming the profile should fix it.\nRunning Firefox with a new profile will fix most (though not absolutely all) user-specific problems. (It won't fix all of them because some can be in programs other than Firefox.)\n###Reinstalling the Package and Purging Systemwide Configuration Files\nSometimes when a program is not working, reinstalling the package that provides it with fresh systemwide configuration files (as sean_m suggested) can help. This is really doing things:\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalling the package replaces any corrupted files with new files (and also, if done in the optimal way, makes sure you get the latest version of the package provided by your software sources).\n\n*Eliminating any modifications manually, automatically, or inadvertently made to systemwide configuration files can solve problems arising from your system's local configuration.\n\nTo reinstall Firefox and with new configuration files (as well as new copies of other files, like the Firefox executable), run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install firefox\n\nThis (and any other \"purge\" method) only replaces systemwide configuration files--files that affect the configuration for all users. This does not affect individual users' profiles or other user-specific configuration.\nSee man apt-get and the Ubuntu wiki for more information about what the --purge flag (and the purge action) does.\n\nA: You may have a broken or incomplete Firefox install. This can happen from a botched update or other apt-get funny business. To see what's going on with Firefox you may want to fire up the terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and simply type 'firefox' . This will attempt to launch Firefox and provided that it is installed and somewhere in your system $PATH variable, it should either launch or give you some information about what's broken. \nIf you're not wanting to venture into the world of the terminal too much, just fire up the Ubuntu Software Center and attempt to search for Firefox then uninstall/re-install. There may be some corrupt configuration that isn't removed from a simple uninstall (apt-get remove firefox), and for this you will need to use the terminal and execute 'sudo apt-get purge firefox'. The 'purge' option for apt-get removes the application and all associated configuration files so that a re-install is a truly clean operation.\nIf that still doesn't work, there are several browsers out there which are basically Firefox without the Mozilla branding, there are guides for installing them on Ubuntu. IceWeasel is probably your best bet and is actively maintained by the Debian project. There are many guides for installing under Ubuntu and a simple Google search for \"Ubuntu IceWeasel\" will bring up several very good ones. I will attempt to link them when I'm at home and not posting from an iPhone.\n", "Q: Should swap and RAID-1 mix? I have a box with a small RAID-1 array being used for swap space.  I only did this since I was setting up mirrors for every other partition in the system.\nToday I read this question and it prompted me to wonder: \"is having swap on RAID-1 ideal / advisable ?\".\n\nA: Advanced installation section in Ubuntu Server documentation describes installation on a software RAID 1 array. From what I can see, they create a swap partition on RAID too, so it's almost a \"recommended\" layout.\nFrom purely theoretical point of view, however, using RAID 1 for swap partition may provide less benefits compared to \"normal\" partitions - the data on the swap partition is more or less volatile, so it is less likely you'll lose much data in case of a disk failure, although a process may crash or the system may reboot if the swap partition suddenly fails. \nUsing RAID-0 or 2 separate non-RAID partitions may (or may not) make more sense from performance point of view, if you're concerned about performance you may need to do some benchmarking.\nAdditionally, all of this may affect performance only in the case your system is severely RAM-limited and the swap is heavily used. Adding more RAM and removing swap completely would be an ultimate solution, both from performance and reliability point of view :) \n\nA: You should (probably) not take your swap off the RAID 1.\nIt's sometimes less important have swap on a RAID 1, but it's fine, usually helpful, and often necessary. Rarely is there any reason to deliberately put your swap elsewhere, if you're already using a RAID 1.\nSwap on RAID 1 May Perform Better\nSWAP on RAID 1 can be expected to perform better than a single swap partition outside the RAID, but not as well as two swaps set to the same priority.\nWriting to a RAID 1 is sometimes slower than writing to a single disk, since all data must be written to both disks. Often it's not really slower--usually the slowdown will be negligible. If you have a RAID 1 of two disks on the same IDE controller, it will be slower. But when accessing one disk doesn't slow down accesses to the other disk, writing to the RAID 1 will not be significantly slower.\nReading from a RAID 1 is almost always faster than reading from a single disk, since when one disk is occupied by a read, more data can be read from the other disk. Reading from a RAID 1 made up of two drives is often almost twice as fast as reading from a single drive.\nI'm not aware of any tests to compare two separate swap partitions to a single swap partition on a RAID 1 (or any other RAID). There's no reason to think a single swap partition would perform as well or better than a swap on a RAID 1. The situation is more complicated if you have two swaps on separate disks:\n\n*\n\n*If the swaps are given different priorities in /etc/fstab, separate pages are swapped to them; the same page is not swapped to both at once. I'd expect two swaps to be faster for accessing unrelated swapped data simultaneously, but slower for accessing a single page.\n\n\n*If the swaps are given the same priority in /etc/fstab, data (even from a single page) will be striped. This is similar to RAID 0 and will most likely perform even better than putting the swap on a RAID 1.\nTheoretically if you have a hardware RAID 1, software striping could be less efficient, but unless you have unusual applications where reading from swap is overwhelmingly more common than writing to it, I would expect a non-RAID software striped swap to outperform a swap partition on a RAID 1.\n(Since the kernel can stripe swapped data between multiple swap partitions, there's no reason to set up a software RAID 0 just for swap.)\nSee this section of the Wikipdia article \"Standard RAID levels\", for more information about RAID 1 performance.\nThanks to gertvdijk for providing critically important information about striped swaps.\nYou Might Really Need Your Swap on the RAID 1\nWhether or not you need your swap on a RAID 1 depends on why you need a RAID 1 in the first place. The data in swap is typically highly volatile and losing it usually doesn't represent a significant loss of assets. However.:\n\n*\n\n*One benefit of RAID (except RAID 0) is that if a drive fails your computer keeps running (just somewhat slower). If you have programs running that have swapped pages to disk (which virtually always is the case if swap is enabled), the drive containing a swap partition (whether or not it's the only swap partition) fails, and it doesn't have a redundant backup, your system will immediately stop working right (and will likely be entirely unusable until rebooted, depending on how the swap was being used). If you're using the machine as a production server or for any other important task, downtime will result.\nIf you can tolerate total swap failure from a single commonly encountered adverse event (one drive failing), you should ask yourself why you're using RAID 1 at all. You might have a good answer...and you might not. RAID (except RAID 0) safeguards against disk failure, but RAID is not a backup solution. If you change or delete a file on a RAID, or malware infects a system on a RAID, the changes are made immediately everywhere--the RAID will not enable you to recover from that.\nIf what you need is a backup rather than redundancy, and you don't already have a highly reliable, easily accessible backup, then you should take one of the drives out of RAID completely and use it for backups. (Of course, sometimes it is also necessary to have an off-site backup.)\n\n\n*If you hibernate your computer (i.e., suspend-to-disk), the contents of RAM are copied  to the swap partition. So you can actually lose data by losing your swap partition, if your machine is hibernated when disk failure occurs.\n", "Q: sound levels in alsamixer versus sound levels in the 'sound settings' menu the maximum volume alsamixer allows me to reach is 100%\nthe 'sound settings' menu (on the upper right corner) allows levels beyond 100%\nWhy are these levels not reachable via alsamixer ? Is this related to some deep fact about the sound architecture, or is it incidental ? Are those volumes only acessible via pulse (i.e. is alsa unaware of them) ?\n\nA: Percentages are always relative.\nIn alsamixer, 100% is the maximum value of the mixer control.\nIn PulseAudio, 100% is 0 dB.\n(Please note that this still doesn't tell you anything about the absolute volume level.)\n", "Q: juju deploy timeout After I installed juju through the ppa and bootstrapped it, I haven't been able to deploy anything.

See How do I bypass/ignore the gpg signature checks of apt? for more detail.\nBut ideally, you need to figure out why you cannot connect to the key server to install the key.\nFirstly, you can check your Internet connection and DNS by visiting http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/ in a browser. If your Internet connection is working you will see a simple page entitled SKS OpenPGP Public Key Server. This shows that your computer can look up and connect to the key server.\nIf this is the case, then it is likely that the problem is a firewall or proxy server restricting your access to the specific port that apt-key wants to connect to.

You can find useful lists of the special commands the terminal understands here or here. Note that these commands are not being interpreted by the shell (eg, bash), but by the terminal emulator (eg gnome-terminal, xterm, etc).\n(To further complicate matters, there are different types of terminal which can be emulated. The above character sequences apply to an emulated VT100 terminal, which is probably a safe bet. These different types of terminals now emulated in software correspond to physical terminals which could be connected to Unix mainframes of lore.)\nAll special commands start with an escape character, after which the terminal interprets the next few characters.\nTo change the text colour to blue, for example\n$ echo -e \"\\033[34mhello blue world\\033[0m\"\n\n\\033 is the code for the ESCAPE character, which starts the sequence. [34m sets the text attribute 34, which is foreground colour blue. The text hello blue world is then echoed as normal, except that the attributes currently used for printing have changed (to blue text), and finally the escape sequence and command [0m returns text printing to normal. (echo -e ensures the sequence \\033 is interpreted as a character code and not the four characters \\ 0 3 3).\nAttempting to do anything complex using these commands manually will very quickly give you a headache.\nThe curses library provides an abstraction layer for making user interfaces on a terminal. The python binding is probably a good place to start if you want to try it out - but be warned, the library is pretty arcane and the documentation doubly so.\nFor the case of trying to output graphics, the correct tool is probably libcaca.\n", "Q: How can I use bind9 to use my own custom domain in my LAN?

I want to install Ubuntu inside Windows.\nHowever, if Windows gets corrupted, how can data from the Ubuntu system be recovered?\n\nA: The data can be recovered if Windows is unbootable but you can still access the filesystem. All of the data is stored inside of a filesystem image called C:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk. \nSimply boot an Ubuntu livecd, mount the NTFS partition and then mount that image (sudo mount -o loop /path/to/root.disk /mnt), get to where you mounted it (/mnt if you used the above command) and backup your data.\nIf you cannot mount the root.disk and you suspect filesystem corruption, then you should do the following (the order is important):\n\n\n*\n\n*Run chkdsk /r from Windows to fix any NTFS file system corruption\n\n*Mount and fsck the root.disk from a live CD in case there is ext3/4 corruption\n\n\nIf there is no file system corruption you can also access the root.disk from within Windows using ext2read\n", "Q: Ubuntu sidebar on desktop stopped showing I decided to give Ubuntu a try after all these years using only Windows as OS. \nI downloaded that windows installer from their site and installed Ubuntu.

Will they just be skipped, or runned as soon as the server is on again?\n\nA: cron skips jobs if it isn't running at the time that they are scheduled.\nHowever, if you have anacron installed, then daily, weekly and monthly jobs are run \"at the specified intervals as closely as machine uptime permits\".\nIn /etc/crontab, you should see references to anacron. This logic uses anacron for regular jobs, but only if anacron is installed. anacron is installed by default on Ubuntu Desktop, but not on Server, since servers are generally expected to be on 24/7.

These keyboard messages concern Unity, and don't include in-application shortcuts like copy and paste:\n\nShortcuts identical to those in Windows:\nMany of the keyboard short-cuts are actually the same as on Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy:Ctrl-C\n\n*Paste: Ctrl-V\n\n*Cut: Ctrl-X\n\n*Close window: Alt-F4\n\n*Search for files and applications: Super (also known as the Windows key)\n\n*Close tab: Ctrl-F4\n\n*Rename file: F2\n\n*Refresh: F5\n\n*Help: F1\n\n*Select all: Ctrl-A\n\n*Properties: Alt+Enter\nJust like in Windows, if you hold down Alt, some letters will be underlined in the menu of the window, and you can use those letters to form a keyboard shortcut. For example, in the file explorer, you can hold down Alt, see that the F in File is underlined, so you hit F to open that menu.\nNewer versions of Unity also include a new feature that allows you to search the menus by tapping Alt and then typing the menu item, for example, \"save\". This is called the HUD.\nShortcuts different to those in Windows:\nHere are some keyboard shortcuts that are noticeably different:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch applications with Alt-Tab, and switch windows within an application with Alt-~\n\n*Log out with Ctrl-Alt-Del\n\n*Force log out with Ctrl-Alt-Backspace (this must be enabled first)\n\n*Run a particular command with Alt-F2\n\nI highly recommend learning some of the keyboard shortcuts specific to Unity. For example, Ctrl-Alt-Numpad right resizes and positions the focussed window on the right side of the screen (think sidebar), and the other numpad arrows do what you would expect. I use this all the time.\n\nA: All of the basic shortcuts can be the same, however the IBM CUA shortcuts are also supported if you're more used to those.\n", "Q: Remove USB dual boot Ubuntu 12.10?

I don't have SSD so no problem of fake raid.\nIs there some way by which I can install Ubuntu (12.04 preferred)? I don't care about Windows 8. Is there any way via which I can install Ubutnu over Windows 8? (I don't have a CD/DVD ROM).\n\nA: I had this problem on a Lenovo. Load Ubuntu onto a USB stick and then in Windows try running it from there. It will give you the option of when you want to restart the machine. Tell it to restart straight away and it should allow you to boot the USB. \nNote: you may still need to press F9 or it may prompt you to press something else.\n", "Q: Script/tool to clone a ubuntu server I have installed and configured a ubuntu server (installing additional packages and making modifications to some configuration files). Now I would like to install an almost identical  system, which has just a different IP, hostname, or anything like these. Is there any script or tool that can automate this process?\nI am not looking for something like Clonezilla, which makes an image clone. I am not looking for something like remastersys, which creates an ISO image. I would like something like this: http://www.debianadmin.com/clone-your-ubuntu-installation.html or this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=525660 , but more complete and automatic.\nBasically, this tool should scan the existing system and extract a list of packages that are installed. Then compare the configuration files on the system with the default configuration files of each package and generate diffs where they are different. However it should also identify the configurations that are different for each server (like IP, hostname, etc.) and give an option to customize them.\nAll this should be done automatically, and the output should be a very small sized \"DNA\" of the current system. Then a tool like debootstrap should be used to install the new system, and the changes that are described on the \"DNA\" should be applied to it: installing new packages and modifying their configuration files.\n\nAbout the motivation:\nI manage a virtual web server in cloud where I have made lots of configurations over time: related to security, different packages etc. Now, if I want to build another server that has the same function and purpose as the first one, the long and tedious way would be to go over all the installations and configurations again, and still I may miss something. I thought that maybe there is any tool out there that can make something like a diff between the current state of the server and the initial state of a just installed server. This diff would also help me to audit the current system, I don't exactly remember all the things that I have touched and messed in it. \nSuch a diff could also serve as a recipe that I can share with my friends, if they want to build a system like mine. It would be much more convenient and safe than passing around huge tarballs or images. \n\nThe tools suggested for cloning:\nSome of the tools suggested are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mondorescue\n\n*Clonezilla\n\n*Remastersys\n\n*TKLBAM\n\n*Snap\n\n*Cobbler\n\n*Puppet\n\n*Cfengine\n\n*Chef\nBut none of them is suitable for my case.\n\nA: If two systems have the same packages installed, and you make a diff of their /etc directories, you will basically get all the configuration changes between them (maybe not 100% of them but still very accurate). So, what I did to audit my system was this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a minimal system with debootstrap (similar to what is described here: \nhttp://dashohoxha.blogspot.com/2013/02/how-to-set-up-chroot-environment-for.html).\n\n*Make sure that I install on the chroot system all the packages that are installed on the main system (as described here: http://www.debianadmin.com/clone-your-ubuntu-installation.html)\n\n*Make a diff between the /etc dirs of both systems.\nOf course, this diff cannot be readily used to install and configure another system, but knowing where are the differences and what they are, can help to build a tklpatch (like this: https://github.com/dashohoxha/B-Translator/tree/master/tklpatch), which of course is not quite easy to be done and requires some work.\nThen, I can distribute/publish this tklpatch and everybody can build easily a system quite similar to mine.\n\nA: I think you could use dpkg --get-selections. Then install those packages on your new server. The configuration files you can copy from the old server. It is not painless, but it is accessible. \nSource\n", "Q: gtk-builder-convert Error I am doing the tutorial in the link http://www.micahcarrick.com/gtk-glade-tutorial-part-1.html\nWhen I run the gtk-builder-convert tutorial.glade tutorial.xml I get the following error\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"/usr/bin/gtk-builder-convert\", line 799, in <module>\n    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))\n    File \"/usr/bin/gtk-builder-convert\", line 787, in main\n    conv.parse_file(input_filename)\n    File \"/usr/bin/gtk-builder-convert\", line 162, in parse_file\n    self._parse()\n    File \"/usr/bin/gtk-builder-convert\", line 234, in _parse\n    assert glade_iface, (\"Badly formed XML, there is \"\n\n    AssertionError: Badly formed XML, there is no <glade-interface> tag.\n\nthe glade file looks like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<interface>\n    <!-- interface-requires gtk+ 3.0 -->\n    <object class=\"GtkWindow\" id=\"window\">\n        <property name=\"can_focus\">False</property>\n        <property name=\"title\" translatable=\"yes\">GTK+ Text Editor</property>\n        <signal name=\"destroy\" handler=\"on_window_destroy\" swapped=\"no\"/>\n        <child>\n            <placeholder/>\n        </child>\n    </object>\n</interface>\n\nNote: the glade file was generated using Glade 3.14.0 in ubuntu 12.10\n\nA: The last time I programmed in Glade/GTK, it didn't require \"gtk-builder-convert\".

I want to install Ubuntu on a separate drive with Windows 7 64-bit on the primary drive.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: First, read this please:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot \"WindowsDualBoot\"\n", "Q: Slow SSD + dm-crypt with Luks encryption in Ubuntu 12.10 I have an 128 GB SSD installed in my laptop (Samsung 840 Pro) on a Sata 3 interface. This laptop also has an i5 3210m Ivy Bridge Intel processor and 8 GB of RAM.\nI installed Ubuntu 12.10, using the graphical installer to get full-disk encryption. I am kind of disappointed, because I was expecting the specs I have to yield better results than what I get. \nWhile looking at this SSD Benchmarking page it claims that my processor is able to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*~500 MB/s : With AES-NI \n\n*~200 MB/s : Without AES-NI \n\n\nLooking at the numbers I get, I think I may not have AES-NI enabled. But first ...\nReading unencrypted data is fast:\n# hdparm -Tt /dev/sda1\n\n/dev/sda1:\n Timing cached reads:   14814 MB in  2.00 seconds = 7411.70 MB/sec\n Timing buffered disk reads: 242 MB in  0.48 seconds = 502.75 MB/sec\n\nThat's actually close to my SSD's specs of \"up to 530 MB/s\" and doing a dd test yields similar results to the above.\nWriting encrypted data is fast too with dm-crypt (otherwise with eCryptfs the performance on writing is abysmal, lower than 100 MB/s), the numbers being close to the SSD spec (I guess writing is buffered or something):\n# dd if=/dev/zero of=tempfile bs=1M count=1024 conv=fdatasync,notrunc\n1024+0 records in\n1024+0 records out\n1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 2.93896 s, 365 MB/s\n\nReading encrypted data is however another story:\n# echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n# dd if=tempfile of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1024\n\n1024+0 records in\n1024+0 records out\n1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 5.85956 s, 183 MB/s\n\nWhile writing this message, I actually got lucky to get 183 MB/s, because this number varies. Normally it's somewhere around 150 MB/s, but I also got close to 300 MB/s on a fresh boot, but then performance drops gradually to under 200 MB/s without me starting any apps. Do note that while conducting this test I have no other processes that are doing I/O (as seen with iotop). \nAlso, here's the test with hdparm which yields worse results:\n # hdparm -Tt /dev/mapper/sda2_crypt \n\n /dev/mapper/sda2_crypt:\n  Timing cached reads:   14816 MB in  2.00 seconds = 7412.86 MB/sec\n  Timing buffered disk reads: 422 MB in  3.01 seconds = 140.11 MB/sec\n\nI also tried the experiment by looking at htop ... not sure how to interpret what I saw, since the i5 processor does Hyper-Threading, but 2 threads out of 4 where going to about 73% of usage during the test, while the other 2 threads where left unused. Indeed, if I start 2 processes that are reading with dd from 2 distinct files (to prevent buffering), then iotop reports a total of approx 400 MB/s. So this definitely feels like it's CPU-bound.\nMy disappointment comes from the fact that my i5 processor is capable of AES-NI. Unencrypted data is being read at over 500 MB/s using the same tests I did above. So we are talking about an encrypted partition being at least 3 times slower.\nI don't really know if my dm-crypt install is using AES-NI. Here's the output of lsmod:\n # lsmod | grep aes\n aesni_intel            51038  35 \n cryptd                 20404  10 ghash_clmulni_intel,aesni_intel\n aes_x86_64             17256  1 aesni_intel\n\nHere's the output of cryptsetup:\n # cryptsetup status sda2_crypt\n /dev/mapper/sda2_crypt is active and is in use.\n   type:    LUKS1\n   cipher:  aes-xts-plain64\n   keysize: 512 bits\n   device:  /dev/sda2\n   offset:  4096 sectors\n   size:    249565184 sectors\n   mode:    read/write\n   flags:   discards\n\nSo, is this expected? Shouldn't AES-NI improve things more than this?\nAlso, how to disable AES-NI to see if there's any difference? And maybe I should enable it somehow, but haven't found any tips in my searches.\nThanks,\n\nA: Your Samsung 840 Pro supports hardware AES encryption. If your laptop BIOS supports the ATA security feature mode set master and user passwords, you're in luck.\nBy setting the ATA master password in the BIOS, and then doing a secure erase of the drive, the drive firmware should generate new random AES keys. After the secure erase make sure that you've set good ATA master and user passwords. As far as I have been able to establish (see my post here http://vxlabs.com/2012/12/22/ssds-with-usable-built-in-hardware-based-full-disk-encryption/ ) the Samsung also encrypts its AES keys with your ATA password.\nThis will give you full speed AES encryption, no software required.\n\nA: There is a misconfiguration in Ubuntu that results in the aesni_intel module not being loaded early enough to handle crypto for boot-unlocked devices. I was able to fix this on my machines by doing:\nsudo vim /etc/initramfs-tools/modules\n\nBelow the last line, add \n# enable h/w accelerated encryption\ncryptd\naes_x86_64\naesni_intel\n\nThen run \nsudo update-initramfs -u -k all\n\nreboot, and enjoy.

It's best to first install all of your windows installations from old to new. for example: first windows XP, second windows 7 and then windows 8 and afterwards your linux. Linux always recognizes the windows os and will install over or next to it. That's up to you.\nBut, and therefore I suggested it, there's another option: virtual machines. I have a windows 7 running, with several (7 to be exact) virtual machines. And I have got to say, it works for me. I can access all my linux installations inside windows. For example: I can have windows running with 2 virtual linux machines. And by installing them virtually I can test connecting from windows to linux. I can install virtual servers (Samba and Apache) and test how they work with windows. If something goes wrong with one linux machine I can always go back to a snapshot I made, without reinstalling the whole thing.\nThere are several programs for doing this, like Virtualbox and VMware (these are the best known.) Setting up a virtual machine is very easy and it installs faster then a normal installation. You can add as many network cards as you like, you can choose how much memory you want to dedicate to each machine, you can set up the size of the HDD,... Virtual machines are very flexible, and that's why I think it would be a great option in this case.\nBut that's just my suggestion.

Thanks to AndresSM's answer here - Ethernet problems in Ubuntu 12.04.\nI don't completely understand reasons behind this, but it seems that it has something to do with Wake-On-LAN and this could be the case:\n\n\n*\n\n*something has disabled the network adapter at some point - could well be Windows (I don't have it installed for a long time already, but I can't recall when the issue started either);\n\n*then when I power on the laptop, the network card is disabled and Ubuntu does not recognize it at boot;\n\n*afterwards when I restart Ubuntu, it enables the card while stopping and it is available at start up again. The weird part in that case is why this enabling was not persistent.\n\n*after completely powering of the laptop by removing the battery the state of the network card was finally cleared. Note: I did not have Wake-On-LAN enabled at any point of time in BIOS.\n\n\nThe issue outlined above can be usually encountered on dual-boot systems and is covered here. The link was originally found in that same thread.\nIf anyone understands this topic better than I do right now, it would be great to learn how this really works.

I have a couple of computers running ubuntu which i want the router to assign 192.168.0.50 and 192.168.0.51 every time they request for an ip address. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.:)\n\nA: You have a few options. \n1) DHCP reservations on your router. Some routers have this look around in the settings. \n2) I'm pretty sure if you go to networking manager you can set a manual ip, but still be on DHCP. I mostly use cli.\n3) Set a staic ip with this guide\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/change-ubuntu-server-from-dhcp-to-a-static-ip-address/\n\nA: using the linux program dhclient.\nIf you don't have linux installed, you can use a bootable Linux live CD.\n[edit] If you do this trick to create an address reservation for an actual Windows machine, first switch the NIC in Windows to a static IP, because after a reboot in DHCP mode Windows may send a DHCP request with its last used IP, which would annihilate your efforts with dhclient below...\nThe trick is to send a DHCP request with your desired IP address from the same NIC (or better: same MAC address).\nEdit the /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf and add the following line (you might have to first copy the file to a writeable location if booting from a CD):\nsend dhcp-requested-address 192.168.1.240;\n\nThen stop and start dhclient as user root, where your NIC is eth0 (check by issuing ip addr show beforehand)\ndhclient -r -v\ndhclient -4 -d -v -cf /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf eth0\n\nIf successfull, your DHCP server will fulfill your prepared request. Sometimes you will have to delete the device entry in the DHCP table before issuing dhclient -4 -d ....\nThen make that device IP address in the DHCP table of the router a fix address reservation. This will associate the IP to the MAC of the device and return the same IP everytime a DHCP request with that MAC address is encountered in the future.\nSource\n\nA: The simplest thing to do is to set computer A to a static IP of 192.168.0.50 and computer B to a static IP of 192.168.0.51 and configure your router to send DHCP addresses starting at 192.168.0.52 instead of 192.168.0.50. You may also wish to reserve addresses as outlined by wlraider70\n", "Q: Where does Compiz store its configuration in Ubuntu 12.10? According to http://wiki.compiz.org/CCSM#line-108, the settings could be saved at one of the following places:\n\n\n*\n\n*GConf\n\n*KConf (not applicable in a default Ubuntu 12.10 installation I guess)\n\n*INI configuration file (located in ~/.config/compiz/compizconfig)\n\n\nIn particular, I'm looking for the unityshell plugin settings. E.g. the panel opacity.\nUnfortunately, I haven't been able to find all of those settings.\n\"Most\" settings seem to be present in GConf, in apps/compiz-1/plugins. But the unityshell plugin isn't present in that directory.\nThe ~/.config/compiz/compizconfig/config file is present (it seems to be automatically created when I start unity), but it remains empty.\nThe ~/.compiz-1/metadata/unityshell.xml file seems to enumerate all options I'm looking for, but those are the default values, probably not necessarily the active options.\n~/.cache/compizconfig-1/*.pb seems to contain all options, but those are binary files, and since it's a cache, I doubt this is Compiz' location to permanently store its configuration.\nDConf also showed a few Compiz settings under org/compiz, but again, not everything.\n--\nThanks in advance for the information!\n\nA: All the settings related to Unity and Compiz are stored in the directory~/.config/dconf/ as a binary file user.\nIf you are looking to modifying the settings using the configuration file, you can't quite achieve that as it is stored as a binary file and is not human-readable. If tweaking the settings is your motive, I would suggest you use a configuration tool like Unsettings for that.\n\nA: I got here looking for a way to backup my compiz configuration and to transfer it to new computers I get, since I like to have my custom config in all of them.\nAlthough I think to remember that @jokerdino 's answer has worked for me at some point, I've recently tried it and I didn't get any config transfer. So I've come with a better and more standard solution to do this:\nHow to transfer compiz configuration between computers\n(Tested in Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 17.04)\nYou should have installed the CompizConfigSettings Manager utility, if you don't, install it right straight with:\nsudo apt install ccsm\nThen, go to Preferences > Profile > Export and save it in a usb pendrive, in the cloud or somewhere you have access from your other device.\nThen, proceed to your brand new computer. Make sure you have installed ccsm and the same compiz plugins you have in your other computers (for example, I use 'Put' plugin with isn't in compiz-plugins-default, so I have to install compiz-plugins-extra). Similarly, go to Preferences > Profile > Import and select the recently exported profile from the other computer.\nYou don't even need to log out and log in! All your compiz configuration should be up and running.\n\nLet me know any issues you face using this method.\n", "Q: How to reboot into ubuntu from Microsoft Windows without manually selecting the grub entry?

I installed Pantheon DE on my 12.04 laptop, which doesn't support 3d acceleration but Pantheon seems to don't work. How can I make it work?\n\nA: Pantheon can run without 3D acceleration, but only if you use a different Window manager. This is because Pantheon's default window manager (Gala) requires it. You could use Metacity instead.\nYou need to edit /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/pantheon.session and change the Window Manager to Metacity. By the way, you need to have Metacity installed for this to work. You can also use other Window managers such as Xfwm and Openbox.\n", "Q: internet connection problem in virtualbox I have installed Windows 7 in virtualbox.

Can anyone give me a pointer in the right direction?\n\nA: When I tried to install an Nvidia proprietary driver roughly from scratch, I always had the same problem as you with the breaking of Desktop appearance and resolution. I never resolved by means of \"software sources\" nor \"additional drivers\" because the driver installed in this way is never detected, so you will not see any driver report line in both the cited programs. The problem of this, is because the Nvidia Optimus technology is implemented for the latest video cards released by Nvidia. Briefly, you have two video cards installed on your laptop (type lspci | grep VGA to find out); one probably is an embedded Intel and the other one is the Nvidia card; because saving power reasons, the Nvidia card on Windows systems is just waken up when the OS detects a large amount of graphic duty. For Linux, the Nvidia drivers don't take into account the presence of the embedded card, so it will not work. The only way it worked for me is by installing Bumblebee as suggested on many sites and forums (for example this Bumblebee installation). After installed, don't forget to check in your /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.nvidia file the line \n\nOption \"ConnectedMonitor\" \"DFP\"\n\nyou have to change it to \n\nOption \"ConnectedMonitor\" \"CRT\"\n\nand you'll see the optirun glxspheres command working.\n\nA: I would first try to use the proprietary drivers that come with Ubuntu.

In /var/log/boot.log I see messages like Starting jira... and jira started... which I added in /etc/init.d/jira; however, it seems that the Java process does not survive the boot process as there is no Java process after reboot.\nAny idea why the Java process does not outlive the boot process?\nThanks,\nMartin\n\nA: For anyone who runs into this on Ubuntu 18.04, this is apparently a known bug in Jira and one that hasn't been addressed and seems it may not be.\nTo resolve this, you need root access (or sudo) and need to edit /etc/init.d/jira to add the following lines immediately after the #!/bin/bash line\n### BEGIN INIT INFO\n# Provides: jira\n# Required-Start: $network $local_fs $syslog\n# Required-Stop:\n# Default-Start: 2 3 4 5\n# Default-Stop: 0 1 6\n# Short-Description: JIRA Server\n# Description: JIRA Server\n### END INIT INFO\n\nOnce this is done, run systemctl enable jira as root or with sudo.\nThis will get the stock init script that ships with Jira to properly start the service when the system boots.\n\nA: I've been having the same problem with my own java process and I found this today: https://github.com/hectcastro/chef-statsd/issues/10\nIt's possible your issue is the same. Inside my startup script I was using sudo to launch my java process but if the line \"Defaults requiretty\" is uncommented in /etc/sudoers then sudo isn't allowed on boot. I tested the theory by commenting out that line and doing a reboot and sure enough my process started. I'm now using \"daemon --user=myuser myapp\" to launch my app instead. Hope that helps.\n\nA: In the end, this solved the problem: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Starting+JIRA+Automatically+on+Linux?focusedCommentId=214865540#comment-214865540\n", "Q: Is there any app like virtual drive of farstone?

I am new to Linux, so I do not know commands and I never did something like installing or compiling with command-line.\nI bought WiFi adapter from Edimax, model EW-7811UN for my PC (not laptop, so I do not have wifi card, only ethernet). When I go through guide on CD, I came across a version of kernel. It said I need version 2.6, but I have 3.5.0-22-generic. \nI got errors like I do not have file or folder etc. Can someone tell me where I can download compiled driver and where I need to put it? Or some other advice. I don't want downgrade kernel when it is not necessary.\n\nA: Generally speaking, any Linux driver on a vendor CD would be outdated, and, in most cases, would not be worth bothering with. The RTL8192cu module has been part of the Linux kernel since version 2.6.38, so that, ideally, you'd only need to plug the device in, and it would work. Unfortunately, that particular module hasn't ever worked, and, IMHO, a fix has been long overdue (bug report).\nSo, what should you do? Plug in the device. Verify that the network manager 'sees' the wireless networks around (may also verify that the correct module is loaded by running lsmod | grep 8192). Try connecting to your network. If that doesn't work, try connecting to any network. If that doesn't work, you are affected by the bug, and will have to try the driver from http://www.realtek.com.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the driver from here, and put the downloaded file into your home folder.\n\n*Blacklist the existing module. In a terminal window, run \ngksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, add blacklist rtl8192cu to the bottom, \nsave and exit, then reboot.\n\n*Extract the downloaded archive: right click, Extract here, or run\nunzip RTL8192xC_USB_linux_v3.4.4_4749.20121105.zip\n\n*Install. In a terminal window, run\nsudo bash ./RTL8188C_8192C_USB_linux_v3.4.4_4749.20121105/install.sh\n\nA: It works well. Only issue you should cd to the directory first.\neg.\ncd RTL8188C_8192C_USB_linux_v3.4.4_4749.20121105\n\nsudo bash ./install.sh\n\n\nA: If you run into this problem, what worked for me was installing the following driver:\nhttps://github.com/pvaret/rtl8192cu-fixes\nFrom the README.md file:\n\nInstallation\nEnsure you have the necessary prerequisites:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential dkms\n\nClone this repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/pvaret/rtl8192cu-fixes.git\n\nSet it up as a DKMS module:\nsudo dkms add ./rtl8192cu-fixes\n\nBuild and install it (this version number may change, it is .11 as of November 07 2019)\nsudo dkms install 8192cu/1.11\n\nRefresh the module list:\nsudo depmod -a\n\nEnsure the native (and broken) kernel driver is blacklisted:\nsudo cp ./rtl8192cu-fixes/blacklist-native-rtl8192.conf /etc/modprobe.d/\n\nAnd reboot. You're done.\n\n\nA: 12.04 & 14.04+: you can view these instructions or just do as I say.\n(use these instructions when your wireless USB device [rtl8192cu] is not automatically recognized by Ubuntu)\nsudo modprobe rtl8192cu\necho \"2001 330D\" | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/rtl8192cu/new_id\necho \"rtl8192cu\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\nThen, edit /etc/rc.local by opening the file with your favorite text editor like in this example:\nsudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nmake sure it says . . . \necho \"2001 330D\" | tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/rtl8192cu/new_id\n\nexit 0\n\nYou can use the wireless now or, alternatively, you can make sure you have all of your work saved before you type:\nsudo reboot\n\nYour wireless driver should start up automatically.\n\nTo compile and install the proprietary Realtek 8192cu driver, run the following commands in an open terminal:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git build-essential linux-headers-generic dkms\ngit clone https://github.com/dz0ny/rt8192cu.git --depth 1\ncd rt8192cu\nsudo make dkms\n\nFor hard installation use:\nmake\nsudo make install\n\ninstead of sudo make dkms .\nTo enable this driver, use the command:\nsudo modprobe 8192cu\n\nFinally, update /etc/modules with this command before you reboot:\necho '8192cu' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\n\nSouce #1: bernaerts.dyndns.org\nSource #2: github.com/dz0ny\n\nA: Can you provide details of what commands you used to setup the drivers or be specific about the errors when you tried ? I also found : installing Edimax EW7811, to install the drivers sequentially if the manual wasn't clear enough also try using the search bar too, many have reported errors on Edimax drivers as well. \nLink to the linux drivers for Edimax EW7811UN from their website : Download (in case if you have any other version installer)\n\nA: I downloaded a newer version of the driver and installed it with:\nsudo dkms install 8192cu/1.9\nSo, keep in mind to install using your driver version.\n", "Q: Configure sSMTP with Gmail, in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I am trying to get my hands on a good command line email tool for Ubuntu so that I can send simple emails may be even attach files through the terminal or simple bash scripts.

Definitely, 587 is a correct port, I selected this value for my settings and work. \nProbably the problem here is due to the existence of an outgoing rule into the firewall, or a new limitation of the security policy of gmail.

Why its showing incorrect partition size?\n\nA: There are several things going on here.  You are correct in seeking clarification before proceeding, since your Windows partition is the same size as your target partition, and a mistake on your part will wipe out your windows installation.  The sda1 is probably some sort of recovery partition, and not of interest, except that it takes up one of the four primary slots.  Looks like the sda2 (10G=F) is a primary, and sda3 (157G=?) is the third primary, and it is probably the windows C, but lets not guess.  Since you have more windows \"disks\"=partitions that cannot all be primaries, they must be \"logical\", so the last primary slot is made into an extended partition to hold many (256?) logical partitions.  So sda4 is probably this extended partition, holding two logical partitions (E and C or D).  The small difference in the number of G is a result of different measuring systems one based on 10 and the other based on 2 (2 to the 10th power is 1024, almost 10 to the power of 3). The simple fact is that the windows disk letters may be in any order, and even the sda partitions may not actually be in increasing sector order on the disk.  The safest way to proceed is to examine your disks from the windows side (where you have D identified), Note where D appears, (I'd guess it's the 4th or 5th one listed), and free up its space right there in windows.  Then the Ubuntu installer will see the free space, and try to use it.  If not, at least you should know which partition from its position is D.\n", "Q: How to install Banco do Brasil security solution? Banco do Brasil uses its own security solution.

I recently did a fresh OS reinstall - switched from openSUSE to Xubuntu. I had backed up all my scientific data post-processing scripts (written in C or in FORTRAN).

Both use gcc 4.7.1. \nopenSUSE does not generate the compiler warning because the appropriate warnings are not on by default. If you compile your code on openSUSE with warnings on (most commonly -Wall), you will see the same compiler warning as you do on Ubuntu.\nUbuntu uses dpkg-buildflags to set the default settings. By default, Ubuntu uses -Wformat (which is generating the warning about fscanf and would be included when using -Wall) and -Werror=format-security, which turns warnings from -Wformat-security into errors (and is not included in -Wall). \nYou can view these settings in the terminal with dpkg-buildflags --dump and dpkg-buildflags --status.\nWhat are Compiler Warnings?\nCoders learn about compiler errors quickly. When code has typos, syntax errors, or the compiler is able to detect certain other problems, the compiler issues errors and stops. In these cases, we say the code won't compile.\nBut there are many more cases where the compiler thinks there might be an error, or notices legal code that might have certain problems. In these cases, the compiler issues warnings but will usually finish compiling the code.\nIt's important to look at the warnings. Most of the time, the warnings should be treated as errors and fixed even when the code compiles. If the warnings are ignored or not seen in the first place, the programmer may falsely think there is nothing wrong with the code. The resulting code may run fine or appear to run fine. But these warnings very often mean there's a problem waiting to happen. When conditions change later on, the code might produce the wrong result or even lead to undefined behavior, causing crashes. It is very hard to find this kind of bug because the programmer is starting from an assumption that code has no problems.\nIn gcc, the command line option -Wall shows most warnings. Options that start with -W are about warnings. These are in the man page. In this case -Wall shows all (really most) warnings. It is a very good idea to always use the -Wall option. The GNU gcc documentation has a lot more information on warnings and settings.\nAn excellent new book that explains using Make files and other tools to set compile options is 21st Century C from O'Reilly Media, another very good book is Autotools from No Starch Press\n", "Q: issue with cp command when i was copying in /var/www i am not able to copy file in /var/www with\nsudo cp /home/index.html /var/www \nthe error is \ncp:omitting directory '/home/index.html'\n\nthen i used -r, sudo cp -r /home/index.html /var/www, then the error is\ncp: cannot overwrite non-directory '/var/www/index.html' with directory '/home/index.html'\n\n\nA: Judging by the error message, /home/index.html is a directory (folder), not a file, and /var/www/index.html already exists and it is a regular file.\nTo see if /home/index.html is a directory, try:\nfile /home/index.html\n\nIt will probably say: /home/index.html: directory.\nIf that's the case, you cannot copy a directory over file. Maybe the file you're trying to copy is inside the directory /home/index.html?

My issue arose when I was attempting to uninstall an application from my windows server 2003 box. I was constantly getting errors when trying to uninstall the software so I booted the server into safe mode with networking to troubleshoot the issue. To do this I ran MSCONFIG and accidently restarted the server in safe mode WITHOUT networking.  \nThis 2k3 box is enrolled in my active directory but is not a domain controller. Once I realized what I did I tried entering the domain administrator password hoping that the profile and credentials would have been cached, but of course they were not.  I then tried using what I believed was the local administrator password which was also unsuccessful. \nAt this point I assumed the simplest thing to do would be to wipe the password out using chntpw which I had on an old disk from way back. I ran through the process and the commands completed successfully, and yes I made sure to use this to unlock the account as well, however when I reboot the server I still can not login. \nI think I am now at the point of stopping to try and reset the password, unless any of you can give me another idea of how to do this, and am wondering if there is anyway to get a command prompt open and run MSCONFIG so I can rest the .ini and boot the server back up normally?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: Well, since this is Ask Ubuntu, this can be solved by, well, using Ubuntu.\nGrab an Ubuntu Live CD image (x86 desktop would be fine) from ubuntu.com, burn it (or write to USB if your machine supports USB boot and you have a spare USB stick lying around), and boot from it.  Assuming you've been shutting down your server cleanly - and assuming you haven't encrypted and/or compressed your server's C: drive - Ubuntu should be able to mount the local hard drive's NTFS partition(s) and allow you to edit the respective .ini files (on top of whatever else you need to do to reset/recover the passwords).  Note that you won't have access to MSCONFIG per se; instead, you'll have access to gedit (like Notepad, but way more powerful), and you'll need to know where the .ini file is located.\nOr, while you're at it, you could just install Ubuntu and be done with all your Windows-related problems :)\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu in a Virtual Machine I was trying to install Ubuntu on a Virtual Machine, i was downloaded the 64Bits version and it was all good until this appears \"this kernel requires an x86-64 CPU, but only detects an i686 CPU.

Means, I want to do the basic works with Emacs that I usually do with Terminal in Ubuntu, like 'sudo apt-get update'. I'll write this command and it'll update my Ubuntu system. Is that possible?\n\nA: You have a couple options, the perform the same basic function but there are some subtle differences. First you have M-term. This is a full fledged shell inside of an Emacs frame and responds the same as a terminal window and runs in it's own buffer. The issues I have with this is that you cannot switch buffers while the terminal is active, you must exit before changing buffers or performing any other common emacs tasks. \nYour other option is M-eshell. This is a seemingly mor lightweight option that runs on top of your current buffer and allows you to switch buffers and execute Emacs commands from the mini-buffer while using eshell. \nYou might want to read over this emacswiki page, has lots of good info on the topic.\n\nA: I did it.

For example, how can I replicate:\nls *.txt\n\nwhen my text files are missing the .txt ending, and as far as extensions go appear the same as many other types of file?\nAlternatively, is it possible to list specifically just the files which have NO file extension?\n\nA: To match files that do not have an extension at all, you can use the command\nls | grep -v '\\.'\n\nTo match files that do not have a .txt extension, you can use the command\nls | grep -v '\\.txt'\n\nThis will pass the list of files in the current directory to grep, which will remove all file names that have a . (or .txt for the second command) in them.\n\nA: With ls -ignore=\"PATTERN\" you can exclude files from a ls result.\nFor example, ls --ignore=\"*.txt\" to ignore txt files.\n\nA: Simply negate your pattern (note: shopt -s extglob is required).\nTo display all files without extension:\nls !(*.*)\n\nTo show non-txt files, try:\nls !(*.txt)\n\n\nA: The command ls -SX1|less will sort by extension in a single column and files without one will be moved to the top. Piping through less as in the example is suggested for directories with more than a few files to limit output to a screen full at a time.\n\nA: I prefer avoiding the use of grep for simple listing operations.\nIn order to avoid using grep,\nI recommend using ls !(*.*) to find files with no file extension,\nand\nls -I \"*.gz\" -I \"*.tz\" or ls --ignore={\"*.jpg\",\"*.png\",\"*.bmp\"}\nto exclude specific file extensions\n", "Q: How to figure out which wireless driver I need?

Add -vvv to make ssh print a detailed trace of what it's doing, and see where it's pausing.\nThe problem could be on the client or on the server.\nA common problem on the server is if you're connecting from a client for which reverse DNS lookups time out. (A “reverse DNS lookup” means getting back from the client machine's IP address to a host name. It isn't really useful for security, only slightly helpful to diagnose breakin attempts from log entries, but the default configuration does it anyway.) To turn off reverse DNS lookups, add UseDNS no to /etc/ssh/sshd_config (you need to be root on the server; remember to restart the SSH service afterwards).\nAnother thing that can go wrong is GSSAPI authentication timing out. If you don't know what that is, you're probably not relying on it; you can turn it off by adding the line GSSAPIAuthentication no to /etc/ssh/ssh_config or ~/.ssh/config (that's on the client side).\n\nA: The debug output for ssh in my case just stopped for 30 seconds while it was 'connecting'. The solution turned out to be related to the DNS settings on my local system. A previous network configuration had left behind a bogus DNS server in the /etc/resolv.conf file.

I haven't had time to debug the root cause, but this bandaid works for me.\n\nA: I could solve the slow password prompt via ssh - issue by checking Enable DNS Relay in DHCP settings on my dlink router. Afterwards connections with SSH worked within a second.\nNetwork Settings -> Router Settings -> Enable DNS Relay [x]\n\nThe default configuration forwards every DNS request to the provider. It was slow although I was connecting with ssh pi@10.0.0.103. A hint to the solution was an entry in /etc/resolv.conf \"search upc.at\" which is provided via dhcp. \nThe dlink manual states: \nWhen DNS Relay is enabled, DHCP clients of the router will be assigned \nthe router's LAN IP address as their DNS server. All DNS requests that \nthe router receives will be forwarded to your ISPs DNS servers. \nWhen DNS relay is disabled, all DHCP clients of the router will \nbe assigned the ISP's DNS server.\n\nAfter a dhcp release on client and server, connecting via SSH was fast again. HTH.\n\nA: In my case, DNS was resolving over IPv6, for some reason it made ssh slower. I made an IPv4 entry in /etc/hosts on the client machine, and then ssh/scp was fast again.\n", "Q: special character in smb field in Printer dialog I am trying to add a Windows printer via SAMBA from the New Printer dialog in Kubuntu 12.04.

I also upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04.\nIrritating that it works flawlessly on the same machine with Windows 7 in dualboot, same settings.\n\nA: See Franck Routiers Post:\nNote, you'll have to have the Java Development Kit installed on your System.\n\n1) go to https://sslvpn.demo.sonicwall.com/cgi-bin/welcome\n2) log in with demo/password\n3) click on NetExtender icon, this will download a tar.gz with the\n  client\n4) sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.1.0.0\n  /usr/lib/libssl.so.6\n5) sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.0.0\n  /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.6\n6) un-tar the client, make install script executable and launch\n  install\nYou're done.\nConnect with :\nsudo netExtender -u user -p password -d domain server\n(and see man netExtender)\n\n\nA: https://www.sonicwall.com/support/knowledge-base/how-can-i-download-and-install-netextender-on-linux/180105195559153/\nInstalling with rpm had this issue, download the .tgz version and install, that fixed my issue in ubuntu 16.04 version\n\nA: Not sure if you got a solution to this or not, but Dell Sonicwall just released a firmware update to the NSA series that somewhat addresses this type of issue.  I was having similar \"trailing off\" issues with my windows client.  The Global VPN client would work fine, but the Netexender would slow to a crawl after a couple minutes.  This firmware update has increased the throughput by a factor of at least eight and the speed stays constant!\n", "Q: I get this message when I try to install software in the Software Center Ubuntu 12.10.

I found several sources saying that it's the most popular desktop environment, but I've also read that popular third-party software (Firefox, for example) are written for GNOME since that is more popular. So what's the official answer?\nNote: I'm not asking which one is better\nThis was based on a poll: http://www.muktware.com/articles/3518/kde-voted-most-popular-desktop-environment\nThis is a blog post: http://www.thepowerbase.com/2012/01/5-reasons-why-kde-is-better-than-unity/\nBasically, I didn't find a good official answer.\n\nA: Datamation's June 2012 article suggests that while GNOME has lost users, KDE has failed to pick them up:\n\nOver the last fourteen months, discontent with Unity and the GNOME 3\n  series of releases have sent GNOME users galloping in all directions\n  in their search for alternatives. Xfce and Linux Mint's Cinnamon and\n  Mate in particular have benefited from this search. However, one\n  alternative that users have not considered to any extent is KDE.\nConsidering the years in which GNOME and KDE were considered the main\n  desktop environments for Linux, this trend is surprising at first.\nYet the trend seems hard to deny. Compare the results of\n  LinuxQuestion's Members Choice Awardswith the statistics from previous\n  years, and you’ll see that GNOME 3's release cost the desktop as much\n  as half its users.\nHowever, the same comparison suggests that KDE is only at\n  three-quarters of its pre-KDE 4 popularity.\nRead Full Article\n\nMeanwhile, a question on unix.stackechange discusses why distros have historically bundled GNOME over KDE: Why do most linux distros default gnome?\nIt's difficult to get an accurate read on the popularity without relying on survey data.\n", "Q: Windows has broken and will not boot nor reinstall, need to install ubuntu.

Many thanks! \n\nA: It sounds like you want to erase Windows and install Ubuntu on the whole disk. If that is the case, you can choose \"Replace Windows with Ubuntu\" and the installer will automatically format the drive for you.\nAlternatively, you could choose \"Something Else,\" then manually specify that you want to format the whole disk and use a new partition scheme.\nUbuntu will create a new bootloader partition for itself, so you don't have to explicitly make one with the partitioning tool.\n", "Q: What is the virbr0 interface used for?       virbr0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr a2:17:ea:e3:47:7e  \n      inet addr:192.168.122.1  Bcast:192.168.122.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n      UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n      RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n      TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n      collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n      RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\ncan anyone tell me what this interface does and how I can change the IP address? I want to see if it is the reason my guests cannot connect.\n\nA: The virbr0, or \"Virtual Bridge 0\" interface is used for NAT (Network Address Translation). It is provided by the libvirt library, and virtual environments sometimes use it to connect to the outside network.\nIt was likely bundles with a VM software you installed at some point. If you'd like to remove it, and you're sure nothing else depends on it, you can use the following command:\nsudo brctl delbr virbr0\n\n(from UbuntuForums)\nIt is unlikely that the virtual bridge is affecting your guests' ability to connect to the Internet, though.\n\nA: If you are unable to connect to the internet due to \"vibr0\" interface then follow the commands below\nvirsh net-destroy default\nvirsh net-undefine default\nservice libvirtd restart\nifconfig\n\n\nA: For changing the ip address of virbr0 under ubuntu 12.04\n\nsudo cp /var/lib/libvirt/network/default.xml /tmp/default.xml\nsudo vi /tmp/default.xml # edit the ip address\nsudo virsh net-destroy default\nsudo virsh net-undefine default\nsudo virsh net-define /tmp/default.xml\nsudo virsh net-start default\n\nYou could refer to: http://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Networking\n\nA: I am using virtualbox 5.2.28 on ubuntu-16.04 and the config file is in /var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.conf \nmaybe you can always check the conf file location by checking the cmdline of the dnsmasq process. \nTo check the process number, port, and name.\nsudo netstat -plant\n\nTo check the cmdline and find from where it loads the configuration file use \ncat /proc/<PID>/cmdline\n\n\nA: My answer is a mix of previous answers, but that's how I could make it to work for me:\ncp /var/lib/libvirt/network/default.xml /tmp/default.xml\nvi /tmp/default.xml # edit the ip address\nsudo virsh net-destroy default\nsudo virsh net-undefine default   # needed to avoid errors below\nsudo virsh net-define /tmp/default.xml\nsudo virsh net-start default\nrm /tmp/default.xml\n\n", "Q: update manager doesnt work My update manager doesn't work and comes up with this:\nplease check your internet connection\nW:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/ferramroberto/java/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\nW:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/ferramroberto/java/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\nE:Some index files failed to download.

For a university project, I have to count all the files in a folder. I have used the command:\nfind ./dirName | wc -l\n\nAlthough when I compare this to the file count provided by Nautilus it is considerably more. See the screenshot below:\n\n./dirName is actually a directory of files from a repository (SVN/GIT) and I need to find out how many files make up the system.\nCould anyone explain why these differences occur and maybe tell me which one is more reliable?\n\nA: Nautilus doesn't count hidden files.\nFiles and directories starting with a dot (.) are hidden in Linux.\nSteps to reproduce:\nmkdir somedir && cd somedir\ntouch .hidden .hidden2 regular regular2      # 4 files, 2 hidden\nfind . | wc -l                               # outputs 5 (4 files + dir itself)\n\nNautilus reports: Contents: 2 items, totalling 0 bytes\nUsing Git\nHere's a quick demonstration on the amount of files for the metadata used in Git, all in the .git directory.\ngit init myrepo                              # Initialized [...] in myrepo/.git/\ncd myrepo/\nfind . | wc -l                               # outputs 23! for an empty repository\ntree -a                                      # outputs 10 directories, 12 files\n\necho \"have to add something for git ls-tree\" > somefile\ngit add somefile && git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\nfind . | wc -l                               # outputs 38 (!)\ngit ls-tree -r HEAD | wc -l                  # outputs 1\n\nAnd also Nautilus reports 1 there.\nMy suggestion: use tree\nAs Gilles pointed out in his answer, using find and piping it to wc isn't overly reliable if the file names contain special characters.\nIt seems that tree is capable of doing this right:\ntree -a\n.\n├── dir\n│   └── regular3\n├── dir2\n├── .hidden\n├── .hidden2\n├── regular\n└── regular2\n\n2 directories, 5 files\n\n\nA: There could be file names with newlines in them. Highly inadvisable, but technically possible. This may be what your exercise was about.\nOne way to reliably count the files under a directory is to make find print something that can be counted reliably, i.e. with one item per file.\n\n find ./dirName -printf a | wc -c\n\nKeep in mind that find includes dirName itself, and recurses into subdirectories.\nIf you only want the files inside dirName, without recursing, let the shell count them:\nGLOBIGNORE=.:..\nset -- *\necho $#\n\n\nA: Try checking the output of find:\nfind somewhere | less\n\nYou'll see that find by default outputs any kind of file, without making distinctions based on the type or on the name. Nautilus instead does not count the starting directory (somewhere in the example) or files that it would not show when browsing.\nTo solve the issue, use the -type option of find:\nfind somewhere -type f | wc -l\nfind somewhere ! -type d | wc -l\n\nThe first line will look for all regular files. The second all the non-directory items (i.e. regular files, block devices, UNIX sockets, and so on). See man find for more information.\nYou might be probably interested in reading about -H, -L and -P, which control how find should handle symlinks (and therefore how symlinks influence the counts).\n", "Q: Init.d startup script not working for No-IP I have just installed No-IP on a brand new Ubuntu 12.04 install.

This would envolve writing any changes to the vmware environment to the base windows installation.

Something like Ubuntu One or Dropbox. In that way, changed files and documents will be available in both windows native as in windows vm\n\nA: According to this answer, it is possible, but very difficult to do and prone to blue screen errors in Windows.\nMy reading of the Win 7 license allows you to use your copy in either a physical install or in a virtual machine, as long as it's one at a time. One solution is to create a normal physical dual-boot and then install Windows to a virtual machine in Ubuntu. It's not quite as convenient since you will need to install software and windows updates twice; then again, avoiding blue screens and having Windows continue to work is a big plus.\nYou can use either your Windows system restore disk, if you have one, to install the VM, or you can find a Windows 7 iso and use your exisiting product key.

I have this video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8iOQ9zWP6A\nWhere i have to place two picture of my girl-friend, i have to replace the existing baby faces by those two pictures, which i will make a special DVD for one surprise / gift to my girl-friend. To make her smile.\nBut so far i have tried openShot but i can not edit frame by frame there. Then i tried Gimp with gimp-gap plugin, but still using Gimp is like i can spend 1 year to make this video.\nIs there any frame by frame editing software available for Ubuntu? (for example, in Flash for Windows its easy to do such thing)\nAny idea?\n\nA: You may wish to give a chance to kdenlive, which includes several keyframable plugins like those you may need in order to do that work. \nIt comes to my mind the track plugin \"MaskOMate\" to \"cut\" the part of the image that you wish to put overlaying the video. Of course, it will be useful if you first prepare the images in order to fit the project's size, with transparency, then simply use the \"Composite\" track's transition in order to put the images over the video. \nBoth \"MaskOMate\" and \"Composite\" plugins are keyframable, so you can choose where to place your video elements in a certain moment of the video play.\nSee the official kdenlive site and the Creative effects page for further information.\nIn the next screenshot, I am using a pre-made transparency image with an amazed girl in order to place it on the background video where a man is appearing over a green screen wall. Of course, I also used the \"Pan and Zoom\" Plugin in order to make the image bigger. Remember: The best your sources are, the best results you'll get.\n\nWhat you wish to achieve is complicated and a hard work but with patience and creativity you can create an awesome video.\nGood luck!\n\nA: You could of course try with LiVES.\nsudo apt-get install lives\n", "Q: No Sound Using Ubuntu 12.10 on Toshiba Satellite P100 I'm using Ubuntu 12.10, and I'm not getting any sound from my Toshiba Satellite P100's internal speakers.

Will windows 7 install in CSM so i can install ubuntu for dual boot purposes?\n\nA: It is vital for all systems running Windows 8 in UEFI mode to have fast boot and hibernated shutdown turned off, as well as fast boot in the UEFI.  This keeps you from losing data on your Windows install.\nI feel like I keep giving this same answer over and over again, but c'est la vie:\nFirst off, you cannot run dual boot configuration with Windows 8 in UEFI and any *nix in CSM.  Grub will not be able to see the Windows 8 installation (in my experience).  Either way:\nIf you want Ubuntu on the same disk as Windows 8.1, here are the steps to go through:\n1) Turn off Windows Fast Boot\n2) You need to shrink the main Windows 8.1 partition.  This can be tricky, as Windows expects a certain partition scheme to be used.  Let me show you a diagram:\n[(Windows RE Tools)(EFI System Partition)(Microsoft Reserved Partition)(Windows 8.1)(Anything else)]\nYou can use your favorite tool to edit these partitions.  I prefer Gparted, but any good disk partitioning tool can handle this.  Backup your Windows install first.  Then, resize the Windows 8.1 partition so that you have enough space for another OS.  I prefer to give my Linux installs about 50-100 GB of space (for expandability).\n3)  Download your Ubuntu (use 64 bit only and I suggest 13.10) iso and put it on some media (CD/DVD/USB/(insert your preferred media here)) by using your favorite tool (most people prefer Rufus) or dd.\n4) Shut off Secure Boot and Fast Boot in the UEFI.  DO NOT TURN ON LEGACY BOOTING (if your motherboard supports UEFI only booting without Secure Boot and Fast Boot on.)\n5) Insert your install media and install Ubuntu in the partition you made earlier.  Make sure that for your EFI boot partition, you make the installer use the EFI System Partition already created by Windows 8.1.  The partition should be something like sdXn (replace X with the drive it is on and n with the partition number, such as /dev/sda2), but this could be different.  DO NOT REFORMAT THIS PARTITION!!  You are only going to tell the installer to use it as the EFI partition.  It will put the grubx64.efi bootloader for Ubuntu in this location.  \n6) With that done, continue the install as normal and set up your partitions as you see fit.  Once the install is finished, you should be able to boot into Jessie easily.  \nIf you are trying to fix an existing install of Ubuntu, you will need to do:\nsudo apt-get install grub-efi-amd64\nsudo modprobe efivars\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdx (x being the drive Ubuntu is installed on)\nsudo update-grub\nFrom there, the UEFI should use Grub-EFI as the bootloader. I have not found a way to get the Windows 8 bootloader to see and allow Linux to boot in UEFI.  YYMV.\n\nA: Wubi will not install in gpt partitioned drives. If you have Windows 8 you have a gpt partitioned drive to boot in UEFI mode.\nWindows 7 can install in UEFI mode but there was some discussion of not making newer drivers available to keep users on Windows 8. Not sure of answer.\nBut with gpt there is no issue on adding partitions. Use Windows to shrink the Windows partition and install Ubuntu into the unallocated space. Be sure to turn off fast boot and secure boot during install. Some systems will not let you back into UEFI menu unless fast boot is off.\nYou will need to use the 64 bit version of 12.10 and from the UEFI menu boot the flash drive in UEFI mode. That way it will install in UEFI mode.\nSystems need quick boot or fast boot turned off in UEFI settings.

I entered my password and it went away. After that, I had not realised that whenever I hibernate, the computer pretends that it has gone into hibernation and it seems perfectly okay, until the next time I start. The computer then does not resume from hibernate, it instead starts as though it had been shut down and I lose all unsaved data. \nSteps taken:\nI suspected an error in swap and tried reformatting the swap partition in GParted and turned it back on, to no avail. On the subsequent boots, the swap drive is no longer being recognised, and hence now I don't even see the hibernate option. Of the possible reasons given by Gparted, I think this (\"The device entry /dev/sda7 is missing\") is the relevant one. How do I set it right and re-enable hibernation? (Even the command sudo pm-hibernate doesn't work now since the swap partition isn't recognised.)\n\nA: I found the answer!\nMy boot menu was long and had multiple entries. Hence I decided to reformat the swap partition, and restarted. I then ensured that the UUID of the newly created partition as mentioned by GParted was the same as that of the computer's registry.\nI hence edited the file /etc/fstab using gksu gedit /etc/fstab and updated the UUID there.\nThis made sure that my swap was back in business in a clean condition. I then updated the GRUB entry. This was where the problem was- I added the option \"resume=/dev/sda7\" to the file /etc/default/grub in the appropriate place a countless number of times, but my system still booted back as though it had not hibernated but shut down.\nThen, while booting, I decided to edit the menus and look at the boot entries, and it turned out that the one that I was using to boot it up had the wrong UUID of the swap partition!

Normally, to first connect (using windows) I have to connect to a \"setup\" network which then runs some \"express\" program using either java or java runtime environment which then configures the laptop for use on the secured wireless network. When I connect to the setup network, firefox just endlessly loads and does nothing. I also went to the IT department and tried doing the same thing through an ethernet connection with similar results. Lastly, the IT person tried entering all the network information and connecting directly, at which point a pop up said something about the security certificate (??) and gave the options to either ignore or to select a certificate. However, clicking either button did nothing, literally nothing; it behaved as though no button had been clicked at all.\nAlso if it matters, I can detect and connect to other networks, it is only the university \"eduroam\" network that I have had trouble with.\n\nSO\nCan I just run firefox with wine or some emulator / VM and run the setup network through that?

After installing a Canon printer in Quantal, in order to print I have to start ccpd at each restart with the command \nsudo /etc/init.d/ccpd start\n\nThis should be automated, says the driver manual. But before doing that, I believe that a script for that command must be created. Or is there a way to make the command run at startup without creating a script first? Whether a script must created or not, I guess a different command should be used, one that doesn't open the terminal and doesn't ask for the password each time.\nI guess the answer might be like here, editing /etc/rc.local.

I recommend checking there (if you have not done so).\nThis file doesn't always exist, and it's not a problem when it doesn't. However, if it does exist, it is executed by initial login shells instead of .profile.

As my Ubuntu distro has become quite slow, I am planning to re install it. Will installing 32 bit version make any difference to the DMA problem or the other hardware problems? (excessive processor usage etc). I don't play games much, so I don't need entire 6GB of my RAM to be available always. Also, can I give linux mint a try? (I like Unity)\nbtw, processor is i3\nThanks!\n\nA: I think there is not much difference. I had more Software issues with 64-bit, so I switched to 32-bit. My feeling was it is a little slower. With PAE you will have your 6GB RAM and you have it with the I3.\nSo, if you don't have software issues - use 64-bit, but maybe 12.10...\n", "Q: iptables-persistent doesn't load rules on boot I have few iptables rules which I want to use permanently. So I've installed iptables-persistent and save my rules in /etc/iptables/rules.v4 and /etc/iptables/rules.v6.\nAlso I turn on autostart for iptables-persistent service\n$ sudo update-rc.d iptables-persistent defaults\n$ sudo update-rc.d iptables-persistent enable 2345\n\nBut after system starts iptables rules are still empty\n$ sudo iptables -L\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\n\nAnd when I start iptables-persistent manually, it goes well\n$ sudo service iptables-persistent start\n * Loading iptables rules...\n * IPv4...\n * IPv6...\n\n$ sudo iptables -L\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source                destination         \nDROP       all  --  domain.ru             anywhere            \nDROP       all  --  srv246-131.domain.ru  anywhere\netc ...\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: The problem is, that iptables-persistent calls iptables-restore during bootup before the network is initialised. Therefore you cannot do dns-lookups at this point.\nYou either have to use the ip-address instead of a domain name or load the domain-related rules at a later time e.g. via rc.local.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 12.04, mouse cursor disappears I have Xubuntu 12.04 installed on my computer and there is an annoying problem with my mouse cursor. When I start the computer, it is usually fine, but if I leave it for a while it goes in sleeping mode, as it should, and then, e.g., in an hour I wake it up from sleeping mode, the mouse cursor is not there. Actually, it is only invisible but it is still active. If I hover with the mouse over some fields, they become highlighted as they should be when the mouse cursor is over them. Clicking on them also works fine. The only problem is that I don't see the cursor. If I restart the system, things move back to normal, but after the first sleeping mode the cursor disappears again.\nDoes any one know a solution?\n\nA: A temporary work around is to use Ctrl+Alt+F1 to go into a virtual terminal and then Ctrl+Alt+F7 to go back to the GUI. The cursor then comes back.\n\nA: I'm having the same problem with Ubuntu 20.04 as of about a week ago. I don't know what's causing it or how to fix it but when I type Alt-Tab I get the cursor back. Try that as a temporary work-around.\n", "Q: GPU fan spins like crazy in 12.10 on HD 6870 I installed Ubuntu 12.10 yesterday on my computer and everything is working fine apart from my GPU fan.

Although usually on the same computer, the Client and Server can be on different computers, unlike Microsoft Windows.\nX11 is a network protocol. It encodes things such as graphic primitives, images, pointer motion, and key presses.\nX clients are graphical applications like Firefox.\nXorg is an X server. It implements X11 and provides an interface to keyboards, mice, and video cards.\nGnome, KDE, LXDE, and Xfce are desktop environments. They provide libraries and specifications that applications use\nWhen running X-Windows, instead of a console login, the Display Manager i.e. Lightdm starts up.

I'm looking to chat to people about Ubuntu, and I don't think Ask Ubuntu is the right place, as I don't have specific questions to be answered. I've been told that I could join the IRC channel for Ubuntu.\nHow do I do that? What should I expect from Ubuntu's IRC channel?\n\nA: Probably the easiest way to join Ubuntu's IRC channel and start chatting is to use the webchat.\nJust click on this link: https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu\nTo log in, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter a nickname of your choice. For example, UbuntuFan.\n\n*Enter the channel you wish to join on Freenode, in this case #ubuntu. A channel is another name for a chatroom.\n\n*Keep the Auth checkbox unticked, unless you have a registered account with Freenode.\n\n*Enter the letters you see in the reCAPTCHA image.\n\n*Click connect.\n\n\n\nOnce you've connected, you'll see a few status messages scroll by. Just wait a few seconds, and you'll be added to the #ubuntu channel.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The tabs on the top indicate channels you've joined. This should be just the status tab and the #ubuntu channel.\n\n*Underneath that is the description of the current channel you're in. If it's your first time, you probably will want to read the links included.\n\n*The main section of the window contains the messages people have sent. Each message begins with the time it was sent...\n\n*... followed by the username of the user who sent it ...\n\n*... followed by their message. If a user is specifically talking to another user, they'll begin their message with that username. The targeted user's chat client will highlight messages that include their username in a special colour.\n\n*The list of all users in the current channel is on the right. If you want to have a one-on-one conversation with a particular user, click on their name and then click \"query\", or type \"/query USERNAME\".\n\n*Type your messages in the text field at the bottom.\n\n\nThe #ubuntu channel typically has over a hundred participants, so it might feel a bit overcrowded at first. My recommendation is to just dive in. You'll pick it up as you go.\n\nIf you don't like webchat, there are graphical applications for IRC on Ubuntu, Windows, OS X and almost any other operating system. On Ubuntu, I recommend xchat . Just join the #ubuntu channel on freenode.net and you're off!\n", "Q: Convert a directory of JPEG files to a single PDF document I have many JPEG files in a directory, and I want to convert them to PDF and concatenate them together to make a single document. \nHow can this be done? \nI would prefer using the command line, as this process will be faster.\n\nA: The following solution also relies on ImageMagick's convert but is a bit more sophisticated because:\n\n\n*\n\n*It allows all images to have different dimensions, while keeping the output PDF page size the same (A4 in the example below).\n\n*It centers the images on the PDF page.\n\n*It allows you to guarantee a minimum space between image borders and PDF page borders, to allow printing the PDF without problems.\n\n*It does not change the image data. (So image quality is unaffected, the PDF file has about the same file size as the image, and you can re-extract the original images later with pdfimages -j file.pdf img.) At the moment, this only works with PNG – see the comment by @dma_k below.\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use my script from this answer to convert each image into its own one-page PDF file with A4 page size and 5% border all around.\n\n*Concatenate all your one-page PDF files with PDFtk as follows:\npdftk *.pdf cat output out.pdf\n\n\nA: From the imagemagick package, use the convert command:\nconvert *.jpg -auto-orient pictures.pdf\n\nYou will get a single pdf containing all jpg in the current folder.\nThe option -auto-orient reads the image's EXIF data to rotate the image.\nInstall IM with:\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\nsources: stackoverflow\nimagemagick options\nEdit: Note that images will be out of specific order if they are not numbered. if you have 10 or more you need to name them ending filename01.jpg...filename99.jpg etc. The leading zeros are required for proper ordering. If you have 100 or more 001...999.\n\nA: convert `ls -1v` file.pdf\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This ls will list one file a time in a \"natural order\" (1,2,3...) and proceed with conversion.\n\n\nA: Worked for me (BUT warning! +compress options turns off compression and resulting PDF will be big!):\nconvert page1.jpg page2.jpg +compress file.pdf\n\nor even:\nconvert -rotate 90 page\\*.jpg +compress file.pdf\n\nFrom ubuntuforums.org, the +compress helps it to not hang.\nNOTE: the +compress turns off compression. The machine I was working on at the time seemed to hang ?forever?(I did not wait forever though to find out.) without the +compress option. Your Mileage May Vary quite a bit! RTFM on imagemagick.org option -compress, maybe experiment with -compress < type> if you have slow compression/hanging problems to find out what will work for you.\n\nA: I'm curious nobody pointed out pdfjam, which is a super efficient way to merge images/pdf into a pdf:\npdfjam --a4paper *.jpg\n\nwill create for you a pdf in A4 format for all .jpg files, usually named with a -pdfjam.pdf at the end. To force a specific output name, you have a --outfile <your output> option!\nAs far as I can see, there is no re-encoding of the file, making the command pretty fast compared to convert.\nTo install pdfjam, I'm not sure to know what's the most efficient way (it comes automatically with LaTeX), but you can try:\nsudo apt install pdfjam\n\nor maybe\nsudo apt install texlive-extra-utils\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, convert changes the image quality before \"packing it\" into the PDF. So, to have minimal loss of quality, it is better to put the original jpg (or .png) into the PDF.  To do this, you need to use img2pdf as follows:\n(Updated as suggested in the comments) A shorter one line solution using img2pdf:\n\n*\n\n*Make PDF\nimg2pdf *.jp* --output combined.pdf\n\n\n\n*(Optionally) OCR the output PDF\nocrmypdf combined.pdf combined_ocr.pdf\n\n\nBelow is the original answer with more commands and more tools needed:\n\n*\n\n*This command is to make a pdf file out of every jpg image without loss of either resolution or quality:\nls -1 ./*jpg | xargs -L1 -I {} img2pdf {} -o {}.pdf\n\n\n\n*This command will concatenate the pdf pages into one document:\npdftk *.pdf cat output combined.pdf\n\n\n\n*And finally, I add an OCRed text layer that doesn't change the quality of the scan in the pdfs so that they can be searchable:\npypdfocr combined.pdf\n\nOr, as an alternative to using pypdfocr:\nocrmypdf combined.pdf combined_ocr.pdf\n\n\nA: Open jpg or png file with LibreOffice Writer and export as PDF.\nI hope, this is simple way to export pdf.\n\nA: Using img2pdf you can do that.

This renders the mouse functionality incredibly frustrating, if not outright unusable.\nI tried the \"Mouse settings\" dialog, but all it has is a slider to increase the allowable time between clicks in a double click, which is the exact opposite of what I want. e.g. it allows me to wait several seconds between clicks, and still have it register as a \"double click\".\nI'm looking for some what to say, \"if you detect two or more mouse clicks within 100ms, then ignore all but the first\". How would I specify that? I feel there might be some way to do this in xorg.conf but I'm having trouble finding any documentation.\n\nA: I couldn't find an xorg setting, but I discovered there's actually a \"rapid-fire\" setting on the keyboard itself that was causing this.

The problem is in windows I had Realtek waves maxx audio in it for better audio and stuff, how do I get that driver in Ubuntu 12.04?\nIs there any possibility?\n\nA: I have found something. There are indeed drivers on the Realtek website. I think they work for all or many of their sound cards. I have a wifi card with a Realtek chip in it, and I had to get something from their website to get it to even work... let me tell you, the native Linux support for Realtek stuff is terrible.\nAnyway, the first thing you want to do is download their \"Audio Codec Drivers\" (Misleadingly named, I believe) from their website (direct link to the page you want.)

I want to authomatically, for example, install the github plugin and set the repository without the use of jenkins manager dashboard. \n\nA: The jenkins charm externalizes config for a few different things... including plugins.  You can see the current set of configurable bits, as well as their default values, on the config page.\nYou can set these at deploy-time:\njuju deploy --config myjenkins.yaml jenkins myjenkins\n\nwhere myjenkins.yaml has something like:\nmyjenkins:\n  password: mypassword\n  plugins-check-certificate: no\n  plugins: greenballs javadoc\n\n(the myjenkins service name has to match what you named the jenkins service when deploying with juju).\nAlternatively, you can change things after you've deployed via something like:\njuju set myjenkins plugins=\"greenballs\"\n\nThe service should pick up the latest version of the plugin from the url specified in the plugins-site config param... defaulting to updates.jenkins-ci.org.\nNote that some plugins (like maven-plugin for example) are really part of jenkins core, so the plugin version has to match the jenkins version exactly. The latest plugin version that the charm pulls won't necessarily match the installed version of jenkins... which can cause problems. I got around this by specializing the jenkins charm to pull some core plugins with matching versions, but perhaps a better way would be to use a separate plugins-site with only a single version of the plugin.\n", "Q: change the desktop appearance from my new version 12.10 to the old 10.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to revert to GNOME Classic? \n\nI've just upgraded my machine from 10.04 to the new 12.10.\nHow do I change the desktop appearance from my new version 12.10 to the old 10.04 so the rest of the family can get to grips with the PC?\n\nA: One way to do so would be by installing an alternative desktop environment. You could add the Xubuntu or Lubuntu desktops to give you the GNOME 2 look by running sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop or sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop and then logging into whichever desktop environment you want.\n\nA: Basically, you can install gnome-session-fallback and make a few additional tweaks to make your desktop almost the same (but not perfectly so) as that of 10.04.

I'm asked to do \"sudo touch /etc/default/google-talkplugin\" prior to installing 'google-talk plugin' in their installation  instructions\n\nA: I would need to know where you got that information or what site says to run that in order to install but I would guess the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Since sudo touch simply creates a file this might mean that the app that needs to install would do a boolean check on the file. If the file exists then it continues doing the install or any other process. If not, it stops with maybe a warning.\n\n*If the app can not create the file by itself (Either for security reasons or permissions), then it might need your help in creating the file first in order to be able to edit the file later on.\nNow, going directly to the Google Talk Plugin, it is my understanding that having the file /etc/default/google-talkplugin means to the google plugin that it should NOT add the google plugin repository, saving you from either a future update that may be broken for some apps, or letting you update the plugin manually every time an update appears.\nThis means that when you install the Google Audio/Video chat plugin, it automatically adds it's repository to Ubuntu. In the case you do not want the plugin to add the repository, then simply execute the line in question:  \nsudo touch /etc/default/google-talkplugin\nI personally never add that file, I like having some stuff automatically fetch and updated.\n", "Q: does it matter if the system drive is not /dev/sda? I'm adding 4 HD's to my new server build (ubuntu 12.10) and the sys drive is listed as /dev/sdb. I wasn't able to find in the mobo manuals which sata port is first in line. The machine boots up ok, but I was unsure if the order (/dev/sda, /dev/sdb) makes a difference. \nthanks. \n\nA: It does not.\nAlso for your purposes Linux now prefers the use of UUID's for mounting disks:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingUUID\nThis way you specify a UUID of what the exact disk is. By default Ubuntu will mount disks it sees during installation via this method. If you have a machine with multiple disks then you should consider doing it this way. \nSo instead of trying to guess which disk is on which port and all that, you just define the exact disk. For example in the old days if you took disks out of a server and put them back in the wrong order, it wouldn't boot if the disks got reassigned different letters, using UUIDs fixes that.\n", "Q: Does email client leave messages on GMail server by default? If I use POP3 and let email client autoconfig everything are copies of my messages left untouched on server? Where is the setting to change that?\n\nA: This behavior is determined by your settings within Gmail, not the POP client. See Gmail's documentation about deleting messages in Gmail after POP downloads.\nThe default setting is to leave copies of messages on the server.\n\nA: If you do an auto config for gmail. Your mail client will have configured it as an IMAP account. This means the messages stay on the server.\nIf you do a POP3 config, your mail client will take the messages from your server and puts them on your computer. Normally they stay a certain amount of time on the server (for example 7 days) before moving completely to your computer.\nBoth have their advantages. \n", "Q: What desktop environment should I choose for gaming? I'm finally getting rid of Windows for good. Now I'm looking for a good desktop environment for gaming performance.\nWhich desktop environments are best for gaming?

The contents of a user's ~ do not affect the operating system itself, however the individual applications may be sensitive to changes in the formats and contents of configuration and data files stored within the home directory.\n", "Q: Chkrootkit findings - what to do? after my ubuntu runs slower and slower and google regularly asks me for prooving to be human, i had Chkrootkit running. here's what it found: \nwlan0: PACKET SNIFFER \n(/sbin/wpa_supplicant [870], \n/sbin/dhvlient [1237])\nSearching for suspicious files and dirs, it may take a while … the  following suspicious files and directoris were found: \n/usr/lib/jvm/.java-1.6.0-openjdk-i386.jinfo\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyQt4/uic/widget-plugins/.noinit\n/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/.path\n\nsince i have no idea what to do with this: what do i do with this?\nthnx for responding, \n\nA: I just fixed this on my laptop, here's how to fix it.

Since I am totally new to Ubuntu I don't know how to setup a vpn.\nI searched a lot in software-center but I couldn't find any vpn software. And I don't know which vpn to use. I tried using hotspot shield(.exe) with  wine but it doesn't work and it opens in the bottom right corner a white window \n\nA: The most common solution is openvpn. You have some information in the Ubuntu web.\n\nA: First off:\nAre you sure you really need a VPN? I mean you can use a \"cgi proxy\" to view most sites even if they are somehow blocked normally; or even better if you have another box online with an sshd you can tunnel your internet connection through that (I generally prefer this method).\nSecond:\nBy VPN do you mean a VPN server / a VPN client / an open VPN network to connect to?\nIn the first and second cases look through the software center, in the third case look into Tor.\n", "Q: How do I fix a Calc error message \"Filled cells cannot be shifted beyond the sheet?\" In Libre Calc, when I try to insert a row, I get the message, \"Filled cells cannot be shifted beyond the sheet.\"  This message makes me think that the file \"thinks\" there is data way out to \"infinity\" in this spreadsheet. In actuality, I'm only using three columns which easily fit on a standard 8.5x11 inch paper.  How do I fix the spreadsheet so I can insert rows?\n\nA: You've said you only have three columns. But your error relates to rows, not to columns.\nI could reproduce your error by going to the bottom-most row, row 1048576, of the spreadsheet and typing something in a cell in that row. After that, if I tried to insert even one row anywhere in the sheet, I got the error. Similarly, if I filled a cell in row 1048566, and try to add eleven rows above the row in which I entered data, I get the error. I don't get the error if I insert only nine rows or ten rows above that row. Note how the row with the filled cell is pushed down to exactly the end of the sheet when you add ten rows.\nIn other words, your sheet can have only 1048576 rows. If you work at the top of the spreadsheet, as  most of us normally do, we don't notice the limitation of 1048576 rows.\n\nA: Solved problem:  Scroll through your open workbook (spreadsheet) and look for stray entries in columns and rows in unused areas of the document. Delete these entries and the spreadsheet will allow you to add rows again.\n", "Q: My Printers only print out blank pages I've just installed 12.10 - very good - all appears well, network connectivity is good - I can connect to devices on my network without issue.\nI have two printers - a local HP officejet 4500 and a networked Ricoh Aficio MP 2050. When a test print is sent to the HP 4500 it prints a blank and then I get an out of paper error even though paper is present. When a test print is sent to the Ricoh printer it prints lots of blanks - this is a real pain as the networked printer is elsewhere in the building and by the time I get there its used almost a full pack of paper. The only way to stop the Ricoh printing blanks is to pull the plug and then deal with the paper jams.\nI've tried both the drivers which ubuntu finds and a generic postscript driver on each printer without success.\nI've previously used a variety of linux mint distros without this issue.\nAnyone any ideas?\nThanks\n\nA: For the HP I downloaded HPLIP,after searching through HP's site, because I was having problems printing on my HP printer. \nhttp://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/index.html\nIt was fairly easy to set up and has instructions on the page.\nI am unsure about the other one.\nYou could look at this page:\nhttps://www.openprinting.org/printer/Ricoh/Ricoh-Aficio_MP_C2050\nand see if the drivers work.\n", "Q: How can I mount remote folder on D-Link 320 automatic?

In addition, if your system is configured properly to send e-mail to the outside world, you can alias it to any e-mail address. (To read e-mail sent to your local account, you can use, e.g., mutt.)\n\nA: It is reported in that file in ubuntu. It quite easy to change that. Just add this line in your /etc/sudoers file.

I've installed Ubuntu Server about half a year ago and i accidentally chmoded a+rwx / (yep not a good idea). So i downloaded the 12.04.1 and the software selection section of the installation has changed. Before it included lots of packages while now it's only 8 i think. \nSo am i mistaken and it haven't been changed or was it changed and if it was is there any way of getting the old one back?\n\nA: The list of tasks shown by tasksel is always being updated from release to release, however at the bottom of the list you should see an option for \"Manual package selection\", that lets you pick individual packages:\n\n\nA: If you want to get back a list of all currently installed software, dpkg helps. I assume that you can still access your old harddrive. So at a working Ubuntu system you can enter dpkg --get-selections to get a list of all currently installed software. In your case you have to modify this a bit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a live CD or another Linux system.\n\n*Mount your old harddrive (mount /dev/sdX1 /media/sdX1 where X is the letter for your drive)\n\n*Open a terminal and enter\ndpkg -root=/media/sdX1 --get-selections > installed-software.txt\nThe X above should be the correct letter where your drive is mounted. dpkg opens the file /media/sdX1/var/lib/dpkg/status and reads informations about currently installed software. This will be written to the file installed-software.txt. Now save this file to a USB stick or some other media.\nNow you can install a new Ubuntu system. When this is finished and rebooted, open a terminal and enter:\napt-get update\ndpkg --set-selections < installed-software.txt\napt-get -u dselect-upgrade\n\nNow all software from your old system is selected and will be installed to your new system.\n", "Q: Returning Packages To Default Is there a way to make my system go back to how it was when first installed ubuntu without doing the standard installation again? I want my packages, repositories, configuration files to go back to how it was when ubuntu 12.04 LTS was first installed.\nIs that possible?\n\nA: Edit:\nSadly dpkg or apt dosn't keep a log of what packages were installed / removed and when, as far as I know. The best shot here is to look through your .bash_history and try to find what you modifyed. (You do know that dpkg -l will show you all packages that are installed configured etc. right?)\nTo properly purge a package use:\napt-get remove --purge <package>\n\nTo reconfigure ALL packages on your system use the following command (as root):\ndpkg -l | cut -d \" \" -f3 | xargs dpkg-reconfigure\n\nBe aware that this will possibly take some time.\nThese tools are capable of getting a lot of configuration \"reseted\" but they are incapable of magic. If you messed up your system really bad then the best solution sometimes is to back-up everything and reinstall.\n\nYou can use dpkg-reconfigure <package-name> to \"reset\" most packages to their defaults; but no-one knows what you installed with your systems main install except you.\nYou could search for which packages a \"default\" installation puts on your machine and remove everything else, but then again we can't know what you installed with your system's base install.\n", "Q: Unable to use/mount/initialize/format Ipod in Ubuntu I was given an Ipod touch 2g by a friend.

This is what it looks after a while (specially if I use the option 'Show desktop' by draggin the mouse to a corner, as Ubuntu Tweak permits you to do):\n\nThis is my .conkyrc file and my ~/.conky/bargraph_small.lua file.\nI tried tweaking the setting around but it seems a bit random, at times it will work and at times it will not. Any ideas? Cheers.\n\nA: I had the same problem with conky in fluxbox. I solved the problem by changing\nown_window_type override to own_window_type normal (line 17 in your .conkyrc)\nCheck out more conky configuration settings here:\nhttp://conky.sourceforge.net/config_settings.html\nThe above answer would apply in most cases, however in this particular case it doesn't work well. The Ubuntu Tweak \"Show desktop\" option minimizes all open windows. Your .conkyrc line 16 states own_window yes. This means that conky has it's own window. By stating own_window_type normal the window is being told to act \"normally\" (can't move it around though). Thus the conky-window will as well as any other window minimize when the \"Show desktop\" option is used. The line own_window no is not an option because this causes placement problems.\nThe solution would seem to be to make the window stick to the desktop which would be achieved by changing the line own_window_type normal to own_window_type desktop.\nHowever, although this causes the conky window to stay on the desktop when \"Show desktop\" is used, when the desktop is being clicked left or right for some reason the conky window dissappears again.\nWhat so far seems to keep conky in its place is changing own_window_type normal to own_window_type dock. The drawback of this method is having to place conky on the right spot on your desktop again using gap x and gap y. Gap x is now counted from the left side of the desktop edge instead of the right side. Gap y is still counted from above.\nSo suppose your screen resolution is 1440x900 and gap x used to be 10 and conky maximum with is 250, the new gap x would be 1440-250-10=1180\nIn addition, to entirely lose any visible dock borders change the line own_window_transparent yes  with the lines: own_window_argb_visual yes and own_window_argb_value 0. So in your .conkyrc line 18 will have to be replaced by two lines, 18 and 19 with the new code. When own_window_argb_value is set to 255 the conky window will have no transparency and be black.\nThis solution has been tested and appears to work. The solution is based on the config_settings in the link above.\n\nA: I have an another ansver for you.\n1)Just let the window be own_window_type normal\n2)and go to compiz config manager.\n3)then go to window borders\n4)Click the + icon next to window types, that shall have borders to add an exception.\n4.1) Then while conky window is open; set the type to \"window name\" and next to value click \"Grab\". then grab the conky window.\n4.2) Then check the checkbox \"reverse\" or \"inverse\" or whatever it is.\n5) Do the same for shadows.\n6) Happy conking\nThe problem is, that it doesent appear on all workspaces. (IF one of you knows a solve, let me know). Next problem: if you click on conky window, it jumps on all other windows just like a normal window would do. Also \"show desktop\" is a problem. \n\nA: I had the same problem in Xubuntu 14.04. In my case, Conky was always working perfectly, until one day I noticed it wasn't transparent anymore. The problem was that I had disabled the Compositor option in the Window Manager Tweaks. Once I checked that box again, Conky was transparent again. \n", "Q: Not using a proxy but still getting \"Something wicked happened resolving..\" error I've been searching online for the last few days and have found many people with the same error but none with answers that fix mine as I'm NOT using a proxy :(\nWhen I run apt-get update I get the following error:\nSomething wicked happened resolving 'http-proxy:8080' (-5 - No address associated with hostname)\n\nI went to /etc/apt/apt.conf and this was written in it:\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://http-proxy:8080\";\n\nIt's complaining about this proxy it seems, but there is no proxy set on my home network!

I even went into the keyboard settings in both gnome and Ibus and disabled the hide all windows shortcut (in gnome settings) and tried to disable the D key from triggering shortcuts (in Ibus settings).\nI'm not really sure where to go from here.

I would not see why you shouldn't be able to.  You would probably have to check the BIOS for virtual.  Create a shared folder and you can share content.\n\nA: If VirtualBox is not sufficient, you should be able to get it working as a direct boot, albeit with some caveats. The most important key to this is to disable Secure Boot. Unfortunately, different firmware implementations enable you to do this in different ways, so it's hard to advise you about precisely how to do this.\nOnce Secure Boot is disabled, you might be able to install Ubuntu 10.04 in EFI mode. I don't recall when Ubuntu began including EFI boot support, though, and if 10.04 has it, it's very primitive. Most notably, it will trash your Windows boot loader (as it did until 12.04), so you should back it up by backing up your EFI System Partition (ESP) before you install Ubuntu. You'll then be able to restore the backed-up files once you've booted into Ubuntu.\nIf you can't install Ubuntu 10.04 in EFI mode, you can do it in BIOS mode and then switch to EFI mode by setting up an EFI boot loader for Linux. GRUB 2 from 2010 had abysmal EFI support, so I recommend staying away from Ubuntu 10.04's offerings on this score unless they've been significantly upgraded. ELILO's probably your best bet.\n", "Q: Restore fonts in 12.10 Before 12.10 I was used to restore fonts just by deleting the ~/fonts.conf file and ~/fontconfig folder.\nI cannot locate those two files anymore in 12.10 and deleting ~/.cache/fontconfig/ doesn't help.\nI have ugly fonts on chrome after installing kubuntu-desktop.\nHow can I restore the fonts?\n\nA: It seems that the problem was not related to the KDE installation, but to the msfonts.\nI removed the mscorefonts, logout and I got my fonts reverted to the original ones.\nsudo apt-get purge ttf-mscorefonts-installer\n\n", "Q: Problems auto-mounting samba/cifs share with fstab I have been following the same tutorial that everyone else is referencing.

But when I reboot and try to select Ubuntu, I cannot do so; when I press F12, it doesn't come up on the boot menu as a choice.\n\nA: F12, when it has any affect at all, usually has the affect of bringing up the BIOS's boot menu where you can select between physical devices to boot. It does not facilitate selecting between different operating systems on the same device.\nWubi\nYou installed Ubuntu inside Windows XP using wubi.exe, so your Ubuntu system was installed inside the Windows XP partition and should be available from the Windows boot menu. If Windows boots up without giving you the option to choose between Ubuntu and Windows, this should help you.\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu not showing up on boot menu after Wubi installation\nIf not, please expand your question to provide more details, including what happened when you tried that.\nStandalone Installations\nIf you had installed Ubuntu by itself (using the entire disk) or alongside Windows (both methods involve booting from a CD/DVD or USB flash drive.

In that case, for many machines (particularly, Dells), you would press F12 to select a boot device. So if that is not working:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure F12 is the correct key for your computer, as this is not universal. Soon after you power on the computer, it should tell you briefly what key to press to access the boot menu.\n\n*You can go into the BIOS Setup instead and change the boot order. On many machines--at least Dells--the key for that is F2. Other common keys are F10, Escape, and Delete.\n\n*If you're booting from a CD/DVD make sure it was written from an ISO with a good MD5SUM, burned with proper technique (here's one way), and try writing it at the slowest possible speed (this can reduce errors).\n\n*If you're booting from a USB flash drive, make sure it was written from an ISO with a good MD5SUM and written with proper technique (here's one way, here's another).\n\n*Not all computers support booting from a USB flash drive--older computers often do not. Furthermore, the computer can be confused as to which device to boot when there are multiple USB drives plugged in (whether they're flash drives / pen drives or full-size external hard drives connected via USB).

Posting here for future googlers who had the same trouble as I did.\nFor brevity;\n\nNOTICE: YOU WILL LOSE THE META KEY - so you might want to map it\nsomewhere else.\nRun xev | grep keycode press the meta key and watch the output (the\ncode is likely 115)\nthen add an entry to your Xmodmap configuration:\necho 'keycode 115 = F13' > ~/.Xmodmap\n\n\"xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\" will change the keysym to F13 (not present on\nmost keyboards ;-) and you can use it like any regular key.\nIf your distro does (probably) not invoke ~/.Xmodmap by default, add a\nshort script to ~/.kde/share/autostart/xmodmap.sh\nxmodmap.sh:\n#!/bin/sh xmodmap $HOME/.Xmodmap\n\nand make it executable chmod +x ~/.kde/share/autostart/xmodmap.sh\n\n\nA: It doesn't do exactly what you are asking for, but ALT-Space opens a search box with which you can launch basically the stuff you could select from the Application Launcher.\n\nA: kwriteconfig5 --file ~/.config/kwinrc --group ModifierOnlyShortcuts --key Meta \"org.kde.plasmashell,/PlasmaShell,org.kde.PlasmaShell,activateLauncherMenu\"\n\nworks most of the time for me. It adds the setting to the kwin config file. This means it defines a new so called \"ModifierOnlyShortcurt\", which is just the Meta key to activate the launcher menu.\n\nA: If you assign the launcher shortcut key to Meta+F1 or Alt+F1, KDE will instead interpret this as assigning it to solely the Meta key.\n\nTo open the settings window, right-click on the launcher icon and choose Configure Application Launcher. Then click on Keyboard shortcuts (as shown below).\nAfter clicking Apply, the launcher should open when just pressing Meta. This currently works on Plasma 5.24 and 5.25.\n\n\nA: Feature has been added by default since Plasma 5.8.\nIf it's not working, make sure your \"Start Menu\" widget has a global shortcut like Alt+F1 set.\nYou can't assign it directly to Meta, but it will open with Meta if another shortcut is assigned).\nRight Click the KDE Icon → Application Menu Settings\nKeyboard Shortcuts Tab → Shortcut: Alt+F1\n\nLatte Dock:\nIf you're using Latte Dock, you will need to run the following commands mentioned in it's Wiki.\nkwriteconfig5 --file ~/.config/kwinrc --group ModifierOnlyShortcuts --key Meta  \"org.kde.lattedock,/Latte,org.kde.LatteDock,activateLauncherMenu\"\nqdbus org.kde.KWin /KWin reconfigure\n\nhttps://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Tips#open-start-menu-with-windows-meta-key\n\nA: This soultion worked for me\nsudo apt-get install git gcc make libx11-dev libxtst-dev pkg-config\ngit clone https://github.com/hanschen/ksuperkey.git\ncd ksuperkey\nmake\n./ksuperkey\n\nthen make it to start every-time your computer boots up.\nsource\n\nA: Running the \"If you wish to revert...\" commands from here fixed it for me in the latest Kubuntu after I 'broke' it switching to a custom doc.\n\nA: For me, the keyboard shortcut Windows + Enter worked (Kubuntu: 22.04/KDE Plasma: 5.24.6).\nSteps:\n\n*\n\n*Right click on Application Launcher icon, select Configure Application Launcher.\n\n\n\n\n*Go to Keyboard Shortcuts tab and click on Input ... button.\n\n\n\n\n*Hit Windows + Enter keys on the keyboard.\n\n(Windows = Meta = Super = same key.\nEnter = Return = same key)\n\n\n*It should look like this\n\n\n\n\n*Finally, click on Ok to save the configuration and test.\n\n\nA: This simple solution don't use the Meta key but you can use only the Menu key for the shortcut.\n\n\nA: I have also be confused about this question weeks ago.\nToday I added a panel and a Tiled Menu on it. Then I use alt+F5 to activate it.\nBeacuse alt+F1 F2 F3 F4 are alreadly occupied. Really, not alt+F1.\nIt happened just after reboot that the Super was back to life!\nSo I think that:\nThe one on Latte Dock won't work.\nThe one on a default panel will do.\n\nIt's interesting.\nKDE Plasma Version:5.14.5\nKDE Frameworks Version:5.54.0\nDebian 10.3\n\nA: It just randomly stopped working today for me.  Had to right click the Application Launcher (start menu) > Configure > Assign a new keyboard shortcut 'Meta + Z' because some ditzy person decided to disable the option to just use Meta (That I can assure you was deliberate) Then.  Boom!  It started working with just Meta and also Meta + Z.\nWhat a silly solution all because KDE has dementia and can't remember what happened 5 minutes ago.  History in Konsole, Screen layouts, etc etc. There are many such examples.\n", "Q: How can I install ubuntu from the ISO in Windows? I don't have a usb stick or discs available to boot from, so is there anyway I can use the ISO image to install from within windows? \nI tried using the Windows installer but the download keeps failing and takes ~5 hours.. So I downloaded the iso via torrent in about 1 hour.\n\nA: If you mount the ISO using something like Daemon Tools, it should have wubi.exe autostart immediately and install using the mounted drive.\nIf this has changed in recent times, when you run the windows installer, you should be able to choose either the iso file or the mounted iso drive as the source.\nEdit:\nYes you are right, there is no manual source change option. You need do the below\n\nHow can I use a manually downloaded ISO?\nYou need to download the DESKTOP CD ISO of the appropriate version. Place the ISO in the same folder where you have wubi.exe and then run Wubi. For example, Wubi 11.10 requires the 11.10 DESKTOP ISO, available here.\nNote that you need a DESKTOP CD ISO. A DVD ISO may not work (except for Edubuntu). Alternate ISO files are not supported.\n\nSource : WubiGuide\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: Why does ~/.local/share/Trash still use lots of space even after emptying the Trash? I delete files via Nautilus. I then empty the Trash. It shows as empty. However, ~/.local/share/Trash contains 1.5G of stuff. I have a small SSD and so this is highly annoying.

I rm -rf'd .local/share/Trash last week. It didn't come back until I rebooted a couple days later. Since then, it's been well behaved. So I think this means that this is a bug rather than a useful question. I'll file a bug if it happens again because I should be able to trust that trash is doing what it is supposed to do.

Personally, I think best practice is to avoid using a garbage cache and things are either all the way there or all the way gone. \nIn your situation, if I wanted to keep using it, I would make a bash script on my desktop to the effect of:\nrm -rf \"path to trash folder\"\n\nand run it after I \"emptied\" the trash.\n\nA: Did you enable TRIM on your SSD, if not it would be good idea to do so.  TRIM improves your computer's compatibility with the Linux OS and it also increases the SSD's lifespan.\nHere's how you do it.\n", "Q: How to automount HPFS/NTFS (exFAT) 64GB microSD card on 10.04?

This can be caused by a cooling problem on your computer. I had a similar issue on a Dell XPS M1530 laptop and had to replace the motherboard, the laptop is now working well.

I have noticed if I configure (connect) any printer when my machine is connected to Lan (eth port) then it takes print job only if I am connected to Lan. If I try any printing job on wifi, it gets stuck in the print queue. Similarly, when on wifi if I configure the same printer again then it will take print action on wifi, but again if I switch to lan then it will again not print.  \nSo for 1 printer I have to configure two times, one on lan and other on wifi. Also I have to make sure while firing print jobs that I should be selecting right printer by checking the way I am connected to network.  \nIn an ideal situation, any printer configured to machine should take print action on lan as well as on wifi which happens exactly on Windows.  \nI believe there is something I am doing wrong so please any one correct me....\n\nA: Are you using wifi through access point or its a routed wifi network? Please provide network configurations for eth0 and wlan0. \nDoes there exists multiple printers in \"Printing\" interface? Also mention make and model of the printer.

I've tried looking for an Ubuntu/*nix equivalent to no avail. Does any one have any suggestions?\n\nA: Ubuntu pioneered \"indicators\" instead of \"system tray icons\" as they were before in order to solve this problem. There are now a limited number of indicators that are based on function, and each indicator can represent multiple applications.\nExamples: the sound indicator controls your system volume and also your music player; the messaging indicator interfaces with instant messaging, email and microblogging.\nMore information at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopExperienceTeam/ApplicationIndicators\nHowever, this is really for developers. I'm not aware of any mechanism that allows users to collapse multiple system tray icons without getting a developer to alter the program. Perhaps someone else has an answer for that.\n\nA: KDE environment in kubuntu have plasma widgets having similar feature. You can define group on desktop icons.\n", "Q: How to make a readable FAT16/FAT32 partition on usb stick for Windows access? I want to create a windows accessible partition(FAT16/FAT32). But even the created partition can read under linux.  It can not see on Windows. Just display a driver symbol like E:.\nI'm using parted to create the partition.\nAnd then use mkdosfs -a -F32 -v /dev/sdc2\nDisk /dev/sdc: 2022MB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: msdos\nDisk Flags: \n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags\n 1      4096B   22.0MB  22.0MB  primary  ext3\n 2      22.0MB  56.6MB  34.6MB  primary  fat32        lba\n\n\nA: According to this linuxquestions thread, Windows needs the FAT32 ID type to be 0xc instead of the mkdosfs default of 0xe.\nIn my anecdotal experience, GParted will automatically make FAT filesystems that Windows can read, so if that is an option, it may be something to consider.\n\nA: *\n\n*A current up to date Windows 10 system can see several partitions in a USB drive.\n\n*But previous versions of Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8) can see only the first partition in a USB drive. This is also the case with early versions of Windows 10 (that have not been upgraded with the relevant program packages).\nIf you have a Windows system, that can only see the first partition in a USB drive, you should make the partition, that you want Windows to see, 'partition #1' (number 1) in the partition table. It need not be located at the beginning of the drive space (at the drive's 'head end').\nWhen you create a partition table in a USB drive, you can start by creating the partition, that you want Windows too see. Then it will be 'partition #1'. You can use gparted for this purpose.\n", "Q: 'Insufficient permissions' error on `adb push` command on 12.04 When I tried to push my apk file into a tablet, I got this error, please help me out.\nadb server is out of date.  killing... \n* daemon started successfully * \nerror: insufficient permissions for device.\n\nThanks in advance for the help.\n\nA: I ran into this same problem. Adding a udev rule as indicated here did the trick:\nLog in as root, create a file /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules and add a line like this to give permissions to anyone in the plugdev group:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"0bb4\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\"\n\nIn this example, the vendor ID is HTC. You need to use the vendor ID for your device, which can be obtained by running lsusb and searching for a line like\nBus 002 Device 009: ID 2a47:9e18\n\nIn this example your vendor ID would be 2a47, so you would have to replace 0bb4 with 2a47. The correct line would thus read:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"2a47\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\"\n\nNow assign read permissions on the files, reload udev and reload the adb daemon: \nsudo chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules\nsudo udevadm control --reload-rules\nadb kill-server\nadb start-server\n\nYou may have to disconnect and connect again your device to the USB port.\n\nA: Jorch914's answer on Stack Overflow solved this issue for me:\n\nOk So I finally found the problem, apparently on this device you have to set to connect as camera(even after usb debugging is already enabled)\n\nAlso this link describes the setting up process\n\n\nA: I've seen this same error sometimes on Ubuntu. A working workaround for this is running adb with sudo command. For example, if you're pushing app.apk on sdcard the command would be\nsudo adb push app.apk /mnt/sdcard\n\nAlso, be sure you selected \"USB debugging\" mode in the Application settings (in GingerBread) or in Development section ( in IceCream Sandwich and above). If adb is already running, you should first kill it with the command sudo adb kill-server\nHope this will help.\n\nA: Today I encountered the insufficient permissions for device error, even though adb had been working as expected just a few minutes before.  Now I get:\n$ adb devices\nList of devices attached \n????????????    no permissions\n\n$ adb shell\nerror: insufficient permissions for device\n\nShortly before encountering the error, I had disabled Media device (MTP), as I figured I would not need to use MTP.  However, it appears that USB debugging, or at least some adb commands, require that Media device (MTP) be enabled.\nTo enable Media device (MTP) on Android 4.4, go to:\nSettings\nStorage\nThe \"...\" menu (in the upper right corner)\nUSB computer connection\nMedia device (MTP)\n\nWhen MTP is disabled, lsusb shows the following:\nBus 002 Device 071: ID [idVendor1]:[idProduct1] Google Inc.\n\nAfter enabling MTP, lsusb shows the following:\nBus 002 Device 072: ID [idVendor2]:[idProduct2] [idVendor string]\n\nThe idVendor and idProduct do change, based on whether or not MTP is enabled or disabled.\nI am not an Android expert, so it is possible that the above behavior is specific to my particular model of phone.\n\nA: These two simple commands solved the problem for me:\nadb kill-server\nadb start-server\n\nNote that unlike semi-newbie's answer I don't need sudo.\n\nA: I just run through the same issue but here is how i was able to go through it:\n\n\n*\n\n*you must kill the existing adb server by issuing the following command: adb kill-server (it may be wrong, but i issued it with AND without sudo\n\n*start the adb server with proper permissions by issuing: sudo adb start-server\n\n*voila. you may know issue any commands you need\n\n\nNot sure if you know, but there is a package that includes adb. I mention this because i noticed that you are getting a reference to an older version of adb. You may install by issuing the following in your command line: sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: It could be from another reason. I just get this error trying to install an apk on device:\n$ adb install platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-armv7-release.apk \n* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *\n* daemon started successfully *\nerror: insufficient permissions for device\n- waiting for device -\n\nIt happened because the device was not ready on the correct mode.  The device was sharing its 4G connexion via USB.\nIt can be known like that :\n$ adb devices -l\nList of devices attached\n* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *\n* daemon started successfully *\n\n33332EF19F3D00EC       no permissions usb:1-1.2\n\nSo it was enough to disable the connexion sharing on the phone and start again.\nIn general, make sure having the following result via the adb device command before trying to push files on the device\n$ adb devices -l\nList of devices attached\n33332EF19F3D00EC       device usb:1-1.2\n\nIn these cases, no need to kill or restart the adb server.\nIt probably would be the same situation if you've mounted the device for data transfer via USB\n\nA: I had the same issue and received that insufficient permissions.  What I did was revoke the USB authorities for my laptop. Then stopped and started USB debugging. Plugged it back into the laptop and granted usb debugging authorities. \n\nA: I have face the same problem and i have resolved this by \nAdding the path of your_android_sdk_path to the environment variable  like\nsudo export $PATH:/your_android_sdk_path/platform-tools/adb\n\nits your wish how you want to add this to your account or system wide by editing these file  ~/.bashrc file or ~/.profile \nor\n/etc/profile, /etc/bash.bashrc, or /etc/environment if u want to add to system wide access.\nand then create the link of that in bin \nsudo ln -s /your_android_sdk_path/platform-tools/adb /bin/adb\n\nif you have used adb devices or any command then first kill the server like\nadb kill-server\n\nthen start the server like\nadb start-server\nadb devices\n\nnow you can see your devices are listed properly without an issue\n\nA: The answer to this problem is here :\nhttps://github.com/snowdream/51-android\nAs an Android developer i suggest you do NOT use \"sudo\" to force the use of adb anywhere. It's not what we should do. Rules, policies and restrictions are there for our own safety.\n\nA: Yet another possibility: USB tethering also conflicts with adb. Disabling it solves the problem for me.\n\nA: There are some specific things to do for Ubuntu to make USB debugging work, described in this page on developer.android.com about setting up a device for development.\nWhat it suggests is to run these two commands in terminal:\nsudo usermod -aG plugdev $LOGNAME\nsudo apt-get install android-sdk-platform-tools-common\n\nThe above package contains udev rules for Android devices.\nRebooting may be needed for the changes to take effect.\n", "Q: How to view similar commands in terminal?

I use a very similar one too. Looks good. Found it here perhaps?\nBlocksizes with dd: alignment and performance\nYou can add a block size in which the operations take place. It does not matter what the block size of the underlying block device is to get the operation done equally well, but for performance reasons you might want to pick one that suits your needs.\nFirst of all, there's the alignment thing. In case your block device operates as 512KiB (like flash drives do), it would be very unfortunate to run dd with bs=512 (bytes) as this will cause 1024 writes (!) for each block from the device perspective. In practise it won't be this bad as writes are buffered and taken into one go, but during syncs it can still amplify the amount of writes a lot.\nThen also consider the plain CPU usage overhead when dealing with a very large amount of small operations. It's just more efficient to take megabytes at once when copying over large amounts of data.\nMy best practice is to start with 1MB as that is a nice multiple of most set ups, including RAID stripe sizes, LVM extent sizes, etc. On my laptop with SSD I tend to see a slight improvement using 10MB as block size, whereas I don't see it anymore on my physical hard drive.\nLast block\nDon't worry about the drive/volume size not being a multiple of the block size. The last block dd will copy will be adjusted to match the last bit of data on it. You can see whether the last block had a different size by looking at the output.\n18335302+0 records out\n\nThe +0 means that it was an exact match, a +1 means that it wasn't. No big deal.\nSee also\n\n\n*\n\n*Good block size for disk cloning with diskdump (dd)\n\nA: As others have said, there is no universally correct block size; what is optimal for one situation or one piece of hardware may be terribly inefficient for another. Also, depending on the health of the disks it may be preferable to use a different block size than what is \"optimal\".\nOne thing that is pretty reliable on modern hardware is that the default block size of 512 bytes tends to be almost an order of magnitude slower than a more optimal alternative. When in doubt, I've found that 64K is a pretty solid modern default. Though 64K usually isn't THE optimal block size, in my experience it tends to be a lot more efficient than the default. 64K also has a pretty solid history of being reliably performant: You can find a message from the Eug-Lug mailing list, circa 2002, recommending a block size of 64K.\nFor determining THE optimal output block size, I've written the following script that tests writing a 128M test file with dd at a range of different block sizes, from the default of 512 bytes to a maximum of 64M. Be warned, this script uses dd internally, so use with caution.\ndd_obs_test.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Since we're dealing with dd, abort if any errors occur\nset -e\n\nTEST_FILE=${1:-dd_obs_testfile}\nTEST_FILE_EXISTS=0\nif [ -e \"$TEST_FILE\" ]; then TEST_FILE_EXISTS=1; fi\nTEST_FILE_SIZE=134217728\n\nif [ $EUID -ne 0 ]; then\n  echo \"NOTE: Kernel cache will not be cleared between tests without sudo.

I understand that it has UEFI (as opposed to traditional boot-loading BIOS system).\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04 (not realizing that it doesn't work as well with the secure-load/uefi system).

For me to get sshfs working I needed the following steps:\nsudo apt install sshfs # (it was already installed so  I could have skipped this step)\n\nsudo groupadd  fuse # the group did not exist for me\n\nsudo usermod -a -G fuse phall\n\nNow I needed to logout/log back in (I rebooted) before it would register my user name belonging to the new group.

What is the purpose of using #!/usr/bin/env <sh|bash|python> shebang compared to #!/bin/bash, #!/bin/sh or #!/usr/bin/python?\n\nA: Some people might use a different python (perl, etc.) than the system one. /usr/bin/env python would run the version configured as the current one, possibly making the script more portable.\nOn the other hand, reportedly, some systems do not have /usr/bin/env. Also, you cannot use #!/usr/bin/env foo x as a replacement for #!foo x, because foo x will be interpreted as a single argument. So the value of the approach is debatable.\n\nA: #!/usr/bin/env python\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nThe first one is more portable. source1. source2. source3. I haven't seen Linux a system where it doesn't work. And this is a general statement - /usr/bin/env is often available, other binaries sit around the filesystem wherever they please.\n", "Q: Partitions unlocked from Unity launcher show up again after starting gparted I'm on Ubuntu 12.10 and dual boot. I have put the Windows partitions to the launcher blacklist so that they won't show up there (via \"unlock from launcher\" option). These partitions will then appear in the blacklist viewable in dconf-editor.\nBut when I start gparted all blacklisted partitions reappear in the launcher ( and get lost in the blacklist as well). \nIs this intended or a bug (I would guess it's a gparted bug, as I don't get the result when I start gnome-disks)? Does anyone know how to solve this?\n\nA: This only happens when the partitions are not already mounted when you start gparted. \nThe workaround is to: \n1) Mount all partitions on the drive or device\n2) Start gparted and allow it to scan the device\n3) Then unmount the partitions. \nThis prevents the icons from appearing in the Launcher and keeps the partitions in the blacklist, although in most cases its more trouble than simply removing the icons after they appear.\nI browsed the code for both Gparted and Unity and here's a very simplified summary of what is happening.\n1) Gparted scans the system and builds a map object listing partitions.\n2) Unity detects this and sees the unmounted volumes in the map as newly added volumes, even though they are already listed in /proc/partitions and other places.\n3) When Unity detects a new volume, it creates an icon for it and adds it to the Launcher. Part of the process of adding the icon is to remove the volume from the blacklist. \nA closely related issue is that Unity removes removable devices from the blacklist on eject. If you blacklist a removable device from the Launcher, it will always come back. \nI can understand how this behavior may be needed for phone and tablet interfaces, but I see the bug as a need for a little more analysis of these features. The problem for many power-users on the desktop is that logical partitions are seen by Unity as removable devices. If you plug in a usb hdd with, say, two primary partitions a dozen logical ones, you can blacklist the primary partitions but the logical partitions will always show up on the launcher with a usb device icon. \n\nA: Seems to be a bug (#1060484).\n", "Q: Unable to connect USB modem I want to configure my DLink USB modem to Ubuntu 12.10, it does not detect it.\n\nA: \nOpen up a terminal from Applications -> Accessories.

I am trying to make my Ubuntu machine boot from a /boot LVM, and it seems that the default core.img does not support LVM, so I am trying to figure out what modules I need to supply to grub-mkimage in order to make it find my /boot. So far no luck -- core_lvm.img either becomes too big (> 32k) or does not actually see my LVM vg.\nExample:\ngrub-mkimage -P i386-pc -o /boot/grub/core_lvm.img part_msdos ext2 lvm\ngrub-setup -c core_lvm '(hd0)'\n\nUpon boot this gets me into a rescue prompt where I can only see (hd0-*), not my LVM vg. What other modules do I need for LVM to work?\nI'm continuing to experiment with this, but it would be great if someone has already done this and could tell me why the above is not enough for it to work.\n\nA: You also need to prepare and embed  small early-grub.cfg file into core.img (grub-mkimage -c early-grub.cfg).

If this is possible in GIMP then how do I do so?\nIf I can't do what I need in GIMP, is there any other program for the same?\n\nA: Use Gimp's 'Save for Web' plugin. You can download and install it manually, or just add the gimp-plugin-registry package from the Software Center which includes it (and many more).\nOnce installed, you just open the image in Gimp, select File -> Save for Web then play with the output settings until you have what you want. There are two tabs on the left. One is for image quality, one is for image size. You can even output the image in a different image format. As you make changes, the output file size (shown below the picture) updates. I use this plugin constantly and highly recommend it.\n\n\nFor me, the only problem is that with very large images it sometimes won't launch. If I resize down from say 100MB to a 10MB image size, it works fine.\n\nA: There are several solution in here using both GUI and command line utilities. \nFor example:\naneeshep suggested to use\n\nconvert  -resize 50% source.png dest.jpg and \n\nconvert  -resize 1024X768  source.png dest.jpg\n\n\nOr even use the GIMP's built-it abilities suggested by tommy-brunn:\n\nGIMP is probably the easiest way, since it has a fairly simple UI for such common tasks. All you have to do is open up your image and go to Image → Image Size and then change accordingly. There are ways to do batch resizing using the GIMP as well, but I don't know them by heart.\n\n\nA: I am using the following packages for Nautilus:\nnautilus-image-converter - nautilus extension to mass resize or rotate images\nnautilus-image-manipulator - Resize and send images from Nautilus\n\nYou can install them with: \nsudo apt-get install nautilus-image-*\n\nAfter that restart Nautilus even by killing it (killall -9 nautilus) or by rebooting/logging out and back in.\nYou will have a context menu by right-clicking the images. You can rotate and resize the images in the simplest way.\n\nA: To decrease image sizes in GIMP we have several approaches. Use a combination of all for best results:\n\n\n*\n\n*Crop image\nUsually there are parts of an image we do not want to keep in the final published version. Start with cropping your image to the desired content. Crop to selection is quite easy to perform as it allows you to select the interesting area prior to crop. This also includes a fixed geometry we may want to have.\n\n*Scale Image\nScanned images or photos of a modern digital camera are usually way to large to fit on a standard screen. We may want to scale the image down to the desired final size.\n\n*Despeckle\nThis plugin (accessed with Filters --> Enhance --> Despeckle) does not only allow to remove speckles or artifacts from scanned images. It also helps to smooth the image which may lead to a dramatic improvement in efficiancy of a later compression.\n\n*Export\nIn the \"Export\" dialog we can export an image to any compressed format by file extension. For JPEG compression choose filename.jpg. There we can also adjust the resulting image quality, with less quality on smaller sizes. For JPEG the optimum quality would be at about 90% but we can compress down to less than 70% without over obvious artifacts. This also depends on the image content. Use the preview option to control artifacts and choose a lower quality unitl the resulting image size is small enough but still has not too many artifacts.\n\nA: Since you already have GIMP installed and running, you do not need to install any additional software.\nThe easiest solution would be to adjust the compression settings when saving as JPEG - moving the slider to 95-100% will somewhat increase file size compared to the default settings.  \n\nA: For image editing and re sizing best software is GIMP image editor .Install this using Software Manager.\nTo reduce Image size:\nStep 1:Right click on the image and open as GIMP image editor.\nStep 2:Now Check the footer of the image and reduce the PX percentage (as per requirement)\n\nStep 3: Now Click to file and export the image.\nStep 4: Finally check the image size.\n \nThis is the easiest way to reduce image size.If you have any more doubt please feel free to ask.Thanks..\n", "Q: Can Wine and its programs be set to use Ubuntu file manager instead of Wine Explorer? When browsing directories in a Windows program installed in Wine  - like when opening a folder in Foobar2000 -  Wine always opens the Wine explorer:\n\n\n\nIs it possible to set Wine to open an Ubuntu file manager (e.g Nautilus) instead?\n\nA: The most promising approach seems to me to set MIME types for all files of interest. Have a look at How to associate all file types within Wine with its corresponding native application?\nOther things I tried, but didn't work:\n/usr/bin/winefile is a simple wrapper script, you can replace or change it.\nFor example, to use thunar as your file manager in wine, add after the #comment lines\nthunar $@\nexit\n\nYou can leave the rest as it is, to be able to undo your changes.\nSecond approach, not working: looking in system32 for winefile.exe and explorer.exe, replacing them with softlinks to thunar. Wine ignores this, even a double-click on this softlinks runs winefile instead of thunar.\nIt seems to me that winefile is a builtin of wine. Maybe some registry edits could change wine's behaviour.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 A quick review of the code in /usr/bin/winefile indicates that the answer is no. after checking to see if it's called with a directory name it clearly is using wine to launch the file manager regardless.\nExcerpt:\nif [ -x \"$appdir/wine\" ]; then exec \"$appdir/wine\" \"$appname\" \"$@\"; fi\n\n# finally look in PATH\nexec wine \"$appname\" \"$@\"\n\nSince wine is designed to launch Windows executables It won't launch native apps. I would assume that using wine to launch the file selection routine is necessary in order to insure that the proper parameter is passed after file selection. This opinion is purely based on logic (and the content of /usr/bin/winefile). If you have information to the contrary please comment and share.\n\nA: You can associate folders with the native file manager by saving the following as fix.reg and importing it using Wine's regedit. Make sure to back up the registry first.\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\folder\\shell]\n\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\folder\\shell\\open]\n\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\folder\\shell\\open\\command]\n@=\"\\\"C:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\winebrowser.exe\\\" -nohome \\\"%1\\\"\"\n\n[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\folder\\shell\\open\\ddeexec]\n\nThis works for me to make foobar2000 open the native file manager when using 'Open Containing Folder'\n\nA: i think no. even i have use crossover with enabled \"use native browser by default\" it still use it's own file browser when i tried to open file from ms. word\n\n", "Q: Splitting a large package into smaller ones/upgrade path for users? I maintain a couple of large packages that we use internally and starting with the next release I would like to split those into smaller packages. These packages are already installed in a number of machines via our custom apt repository and I am not sure what the upgrade path would be for those who already have this big packages installed.\nTo illustrate the issue:\npackageX is the current big package installed in a number of machines\nI would like to split it into:\n\n\n*\n\n*packageX-foo\n\n*packageX-bar\n\n*packageX-baz\n\n\nI guess the sensible thing to do would be to create a virtual package called packageX that encapsulates all of the new packages, does that sound about right?\nHow can I ensure that an apt-get update && apt-get upgrade wouldn't break things for users?\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes, making packageX a virtual package that depends on the others is the usual way to handle this.\nThat way everyone who has packageX installed now will have all packageX-* packages after the upgrade. Plus it makes it easy to install all of packageX for those who want that.\nDepending on your software it may be worth thinking about creating additional virtual packages which depend on often used subsets of packageX-*` to simplify the installation of those subsets.\n\nA: *\n\n*packageX should Depends: packageX-foo, packageX-bar, packageX-baz. This ensures that upgrades automatically pick up each individual new package.\n\n*Each packageX-component should: Breaks: packageX (<< V) and also Replaces: packageX (<< V) where V is the new version.

It's needed to enable forwarding on the PC sharing, as it will prevent you from doing this by default (security reasons).\nDetailed steps\nThen follow these (general) steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the current NAT (router), add a static route:\n192.168.5.0/24 via 192.168.10.156. I don't know what device you have, so I can't provide instructions for doing this. Read the manual of it.\nIn case this router is running Ubuntu already, just add the route like this:\nroute add -net 192.168.5.0/24 gw 192.168.10.156\n\n\n*On the PC you want to share the 192.168.5.0/24 network, make sure it will forward the traffic:\nsysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\nMore info in this answer.\n\n*On the client PC make the route to the 192.168.10.0/24 network known by adding it to the route table:\nroute add -net 192.168.10.0/24 gw 192.168.5.1\n\n\nA: By principle, what you want to do is a NAT. The action of taking inside network requests to the internet and convert it to a single external IP, for requesting to you internet provider, is a NAT function.\nI think what you want is not have to use iptables, and its not nice, due to security reasions. At least a masquerade you need to use.\non /etc/init.d/rc.local add the code:\necho 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.5.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n\nthis may help you without too much codes.\n", "Q: Is there a way to stop Dropbox from opening Firefox as its default when viewing the Dropbox webpage?

It also allows you to use your GPU whenever you need more graphics power.\nWindows does this too, automatically, which is why you don't run into the same problem under Windows.\n--\nBefore installing Bumblebee, remove any graphics drivers you might have installed.\nAfter that, installation of Bumblebee and the proprietary nVidia driver can be done with the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia linux-headers-generic\n\nAfter that, reboot, and your laptop will use the low-power integrated graphics chipset and leave your dedicated GPU powered off.\nYou can always start an application that requires your full GPU power by running it \"with bumblebee\":\noptirun your-application\n\n--\nShould you run into trouble after the installation, the following page might help you: https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Troubleshooting\n\nA: My laptop had the same problem after a reinstall.

I am in Lubuntu Quantal and when trying to see LXPanel version I see the following:\n~$ apt-cache policy lxpanel\nlxpanel:\n  Installed: 0.5.10+git20120823-0ubuntu1\n  Candidate: 0.5.10+git20120823-0ubuntu1\n  Version table:\n *** 0.5.10+git20120823-0ubuntu1 0\n        500 http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ quantal/universe i386 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\ndpkg -l lxpanel and Synaptic give the same info, while in PCmanFM Help/About it's 0.5.11.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n(This is related to this answer here.) \n\nA: The changelog on this package will explain it. The current latest entry:\nlxpanel (0.5.10+git20120823-0ubuntu1) quantal; urgency=low\n\n  * New upstream snapshot.\n   - Lxpanel doesn't use monochrome Keyboard LED indicators (LP: #1016014)\n[...]\n\nMeans that the Ubuntu developers (package maintainers) have taken a new upstream snapshot of lxpanel to fix a bug. While this may not actually be 0.5.11 yet, the source of that snapshot will already contain new commits after the 0.5.10 was released and the state of the source code repository might already be in a prepare-for-0.5.11 state at that time.\nA common reason for naming the package version slightly different is the current set of dependencies relying on a 0.5.10 version available, but if the ABI compatibility hasn't changed, the 0.5.11 version just works and naming it 0.5.10 in the package management saves a lot of trouble in shipping out more updates with just a line of dependency changed.\nHowever, if package maintainers decide on this, they usually version tag it like this: phonon version 4:4.7.0really4.6.0-0ubuntu1. In this case the 0.5.11 version might not have been out yet, so they just use the git20120823 suffix to mention the upstream version not yet released.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for Gnome-Terminal profile change? I have two profiles in my Gnome Terminal, one uses specific image for background. Would like to switch between them when I enter/exit  Vim.\nSo far, I do this by Alt+t and navigating to the other profile. But would like to have this automated.\nPossible scenarios:\nvim newFile # profile changes to Vim-one\n:q # it changes back to default\n\nvim confFile # profile changes to Vim-one\nCtrl-z # vim is suspended, default profile enters\ncmd_that_uses_changed_config_file\nfg # vim is brought back from suspension, profile changes again...\n\nNow I realize that automating this fully may be difficult, so keyboard shortcut to do this is perfectly fine. I searched Gnome Terminal shortcuts but Terminal menu has three of them only: title, reset, reset and clear. \nAny ideas, hints or pointers? :-)\n\nA: Preface: I am new, and having similar problems. In the absence of an answer by someone with a functional knowledge of these things, this is how I am approaching solving this.\n'man gnome-terminal' offers some interesting options for starting new windows, or tabs using a specific profile. An alias to start an instance of gnome-terminal in a new tab using profile \"X\" seems like a reasonable quasi-kluge, and allows for existing keyboard shortcuts to switch between, and close tabs.\nIt would look something close to this:\n    alias gtvim='gnome-terminal --tab-with-profile=X -t Vim -x vim >&1'\n    gtvim filename\n\nFor alias permanency, it has to be added to bottom of ~/.bashrc\nI need to work on other things now, but that was my first foray into it. It still seems to open the command in a new terminal window, but still easily accessible from keyboard shortcuts. \nJust as a side note, I am attempting to have all terminals with ssh connections to remote terminals open with a different color profile to help prevent commands being issued to the wrong machine. \n", "Q: What does this info mean when I fire `dpkg -l lxpanel`?

I have a Fender Mustang II guitar amp which I'm connecting via USB and a mic that connects through the standard mic jack. So far I've tried installing FL Studio on WINE but I don't have the FenderASIO driver so the amp is not recognized by the program. I also tried both LMMS which didn't recognize any input device and Audacity which recognized all the inputs but I was able to record sound only from my amp and only on one track. Whenever I tried to record on multiple tracks the whole computer freezes and I have to do a hard reset. Any suggestins?\n\nA: If you're going to get started with audio in linux i suggest you install Jack, it's a little intimidating at first but there are plenty of tutorials out there to learn from. Jack is an audio server that allows you complete control of where sound input and output goes.\nOne of the best DAWs for linux is called Ardour. it's a pretty hefty program but it's more powerful than audacity. I've worked as a sound engineer and have recorded 4-hour shows on 8 tracks with ardour. \nFor example let's say you want to take your guitar signal and send it through some guitar effects using Rakarrak, then send it to record to ardour, jack will let you do this.\nI know this is straying from the scope of the original post, but my last suggestion is to invest in a cheap audio interface. There are plenty of linux-compatible ones out there and it will make your life easier, not having to deal with drivers for amps. just take the line out from the amp (or mic the amp), then put it into the interface and voila. even a small 2 channel one would work great, especially if you're just laying down ideas. \n\nA: There are going to be lots of possible answers to this question, and if you want to coninue this with Ubuntu, you have a lot of resources available.\ntl:dr;\nI record multichannel sound on Ubuntu using a Behringer XR-18 which I love to use - I can get 18 channels into the computer using Ardour, or a command line program using 'arecord' and 'sox' creatively.\nI also run 4 channel sound using a usb interface also from behringer.  At church, we run presonus devices, one 32 and one 4 channel.  I have never needed a driver, and run this in native Ubuntu.\n\nYou will be much better off using a multichannel interface (4 channels?) as coordinating sampling on multiple USB convertors is a real work of art.  This is probably why you are only doing single channel work.  You can theoretically set a single A/D convertor as the master clock for conversion, and cause the other sampling devices to slave to this, but it is not an insignificant problem.\n\nCheck out ubuntustudio - although I just run Ubuntu, and load the programs I want.\n\nSearch around for various Linux Audio forums - there are a lot of creative people out there, using Linux for recording purposes.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu it self have a sound recorder and you can record the sound in many audio formats.you can get it by typing as sound in unity-dash.\nyou can try one more new  application with great features ,audio recorder.\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:osmoma/audio-recorder\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install audio-recorder\n\n", "Q: Automatically mirror a directory in Ubuntu Running Ubuntu 12.04\nI have a library of personal files and documents stored in Dropbox. I want the Dropbox folder to be automatically mirrored to a directory in the local machine, as a backup to the backup. I want it to be done automatically. In other words, each time I add a file/folder to the Dropbpx, that file/folder is copied automatically to the second location on the local drive.\nAny ideas, tips or advices would be appreciated.\nBest regards\n\nA: I don't think (or know) how \" each time I add a file/folder \" could be done easily. But if you are OK with say a once a minute sync, I believe you could put together rsync and cron into a workable solution. I am not sure how efficient rsync is with data on the order of GBs, possibly made mostly of binary data?\nA question arises though. If you want to mirror each change immediately, how is that a backup? Wont a mistake/corruption get mirrored instantly as well?\nCheckout rdiff-backup if you want a proper backup solution.\nBut frankly, I would expect your backup drive to fail before dropbox store does.\n", "Q: Grub not defaulting to latest kernel in 12.10 I upgraded to 12.10 (32-bit) a few weeks ago (from 12.04) and everything has been running fine. A few days ago, the updater installed the latest kernel (3.5.0.22 ?) and since then I always have to manually select the latest kernel when booting.\nI tried looking for /etc/default/grub but that file didn't exist. I installed Grub Customiser but that, apart from taking minutes to appear, suggested that the default kernel was '0'.  But it did create a small /etc/default/grub file with the following entries:\n    GRUB_DEFAULT=\"0\"\n    GRUB_TIMEOUT=10\n    GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=\"false\"\n    #UNNAMED_OPTION=\"\"\n\nI have run sudo update-grub and have also tried changing the default from \"0\" to 0 but grub insists on defaulting to the previous kernel.\n\nuname -a in the manually-selected latest kernel gives:\nLinux typhoon 3.5.0-22-generic #34-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jan 8 21:41:11 UTC 2013 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux\n\nLetting the boot timeout and select the default kernel results in:\nLinux typhoon 3.5.0-21-generic #32-Ubuntu SMP Tue Dec 11 18:52:46 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux\n\nThe boot menu looks like this:\n\nMy machine has 2 hard disks.  The main disk is dual-boot with 12.10 (default) and winXP.\nThe 2nd disk is purely for data and isn't mounted automatically i.e. selecting it in nautilus always mounts it before displaying anything. It is available to both operating systems and is formatted as NTFS.\n\nfdisk -l results in:\n\nsda1 is the WinXP partition.\n\nA: OK, the newest kernel (v23) was installed today and everything has now suddenly reverted to normal i.e. the latest kernel is found by default.\nSo, not quite sure what caused the previous blip - never experienced that before and my PC config hasn't changed for several years - but it seems to have resolved itself before I got around to trying to find grub on my data disk and moving it.\nOne quick question though...

However, some basic or cross-platform development can be done using the MinGW compiler. For example Pidgin for Windows can be built on Linux as described here on their wiki.\nThis is possible because MinGW provides an optional Win32 runtime for Linux and it's depending on cross-platform tested libraries like GTK.\n\nA: Why would you want to?\nUse WINE instead. It gets most windows programs to run under linux.

Storing it on a flash drive would be easiest to store it on.\nBut if your going to use a flash disk, you could just use a 4 gig (minimum) or greater USB flash disk to install Ubuntu on it pretty much the same as if you were installing it Ubuntu to the hard drive. That way every custom setting or additional installed software will remain the same after reboots. \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Live CD\n\n*Select  \"Install\"\n\n*When presented with a number of options for installing, you should select the option 'Something Else' to bring up the partitioning menu. \n\n*Select the fist USB drive partition or create it if necessary.

And example is the name of my workgroup set earlier. Sysadmin is the name of the user I would use to register machines and add new users to the unix/samba, right?\n\nA: The sysadmin is a hypothetical group, the *sys*tem *admin*istrators. It says \"you prefer\" so you could use any existing UNIX group that you want to provide access to the Domain. This becomes evident later when it says:\n\n... user used to join the domain needs to be a member of the sysadmin group, as well as a member of the system admin group. The admin group allows sudo use.\n\nSo, the recommendation here is: use what you prefer, need, or feel like.\n\nAnd what implications will this have? will this mean that all unix user in this group would have domain admin status?\n\nThe users in this group will have Domain Administrator status, since: sysadmin (the group) = Domain Admins (the group)\n\nHere sysadmin is the username, not group correct?

I'm using Unity on 12.10, with most of the Compiz Effects disabled.\nI'd like to remove the fade effect when using the CTRL + ALT + D default shortcut to show the desktop.\nThe effect consists in fading out the active windows and fading 'em in when they get focus again.\nI couldn't find anything in CCSM or dconf to set the value of the fade effect to zero.\n\nA: Similar functionality of hiding all windows and showing the desktop is right now provided by several plugins: Show Desktop, Fade to Desktop and Ubuntu Unity Plugin, that seem to conflict with each other. Among those you'd of course choose Unity Plugin if you are using Unity, but it has no configurable option to control the fadeout.  \nMore about the current status of the problem an proposed fixes here - https://bugs.launchpad.net/compiz/+bug/1063171 and here - https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1067534.\nThe simplest workaround I have found so far that allows to achieve the requested effect is to go to Ubuntu Unity Plugin -> Switcher and disable Show minimized windows in switcher in CompizConfig Settings Manager. Obviously not a very elegant solution, but those like starting showdesktop after unityshell with gconf, proposed in bug 1067534 have been explicitly forbidden in bug 1063171 and will remain such until Unity 7 or compiz 0.9.9.0.\n\nA: The slow fading was bothering me for a long time until about 5 min ago, when I changed the settings in CCSM Fading windows plugin from \"constant speed\" to \"constant time\", and minimized the corresponding value (to 1, I think).\nNow, \"show desktop\" (ctrl alt d) is way faster and near instant.\nNote that I was reluctant to just disable the fading-windows plugin, because I think the dim unresponsive windows setting serves a good purpose as quite a useful visual indicator of system (un)responsiveness.\n\nA: I am unsure how to disable that specific effect but if you want to disable all compiz effects (by going into ow graphics mode) you should do the following:\ngedit ~/.xprofile\nThen enter the text export UNITY_LOW_GFX_MODE=1\nLogout then log back in\nTo check if this worked enter in the command glxgears -info\nThe output should look something like\nGL_RENDERER = Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 3.1, 128 bits)\nGL_VERSION = 2.1 Mesa 9.1-devel\nGL_VENDOR = VMware, Inc.\nI hope this helps.

How do I get to Lubuntu? \nI have no offer list while booting Windows, Windows is booting automatically without chance to change it to Lubuntu.\n\nA: Judging by your description, it seems like your harddisk's MBR (the first sector, used to boot up from that harddisk) points to the Windows bootloader. The Windows bootloader is incompatible with most operating systems other than Windows itself though. This commonly happens when you install Windows after Linux, or if you \"repair\" Windows.\nWhat you want is a bootloader that is compatible with both Linux & Windows. For instance, GRUB, the bootloader used by default by Ubuntu.\nUpdating/Reinstalling GRUB, should therefore fix your issue.\nThis answer explains particularly well how to proceed: https://askubuntu.com/a/88432/29365\nYou will need a bootable USB or install CD.\n", "Q: long waiting delay on wordpress I have just installed wordpress (last version) on /var/www/wordpress on a default ubuntu server 12.04 LAMP installation.\nEvery time I want to load something on this wordpress (even the login screen) the browser says \"waiting for 127.0.0.1\" or \"waiting for localhost\" for at least 10 seconds!

The CPU isn't busy at all during this time, though, which makes it even more mysterious...\n\nA: From experience I'd say there are several limiting factors in the described setup. For one, if you are using MySQL and Apache2, don't expect to get away with one GiB of RAM and no slowness. I'd strongly recommend you look into nginx or lighttpd as alternatives if your setup has such resource limits.\nFurther more you haven't told us anything about the setup such as IPv4 and IPv6 or possible firewall rules.\nLast but not least on heavy web applications such as WordPress I would recommend to have some kind of cache (be it nginx or varnish) if you are looking for speed.\nBut honestly your setup sounds like it's trying one connection method, e.g. IPv4 and times out on that and then tries the other. My guess is that IPv6 is still enabled and you haven't configured it properly. In this case you may want to tell the kernel to turn it off or use one of the other methods outlined here.\nPlease post the output of the following commands (as superuser) if you expect a more detailed answer:\nfree -m\niptables-save\nlsof -Pi|grep :80\n\n", "Q: Where can I find tracker-sparql-0.16?

See you soon!\n\nHow can I fix this so I can boot to my HDD partitions again?\n\nA: There is a problem with your partition table: it indicates an initial partition size of 596.18 GB while your HDD seems to have a size of 320.1 GB. Hence why it complains with a message like \"Partition outside the disk detected\".\nRepairing can't really help as the tool can't guess what your partition table should look like.\nReformatting will solve your problem, after which you can proceed with the reinstallation of your operating systems (good tip: install Windows first, then Linux).\nYou will physically lose all data on your hard disk though (even if it looks like there isn't much to lose anymore).\n", "Q: Brightness controls are not working in sony vaio with amd radeon hd 7650 I have a Sony Vaio SVE15116EN with AMD Radeon HD 7650 graphics card.

The Gnome icon theme (gnome-icon-theme) depends on this package, and most GTK icon sets inherit icons from both.\nNow this sounds crazy but, might as well just remove all the icons that you have either installed by APT or manually installed. Clean your cache, then use apt-get install -f and then install Hi Color first.\n\nEdit after testing:\nIf the above doesn't work due to errors mentioned in the edited question, boot from a live cd or usb and copy the folder usr/share/icons (of the cd/usb system). Save it on the desktop folder of your main hdd installation. Then boot normally and replace the folder usr/share/icons (of your main installation) with the folder icons that now should be on your desktop. Then, try reinstalling hicolor-icon-theme, gnome-icon-theme, and elementary-icon-theme in Synaptic Manager (and also other stuff that seemes related to icons and artwork in Lubuntu, just to be sure): that should now work without previous errors. But \nstill the missing icons would not appear, in the sense that they are not applied for the programs in usr/share/applications (and therefore in menus) until these programs are themselves reinstalled. \nReinstalling the program from deb seems to be enough, but this may depend on the program.  In Synaptic, at least for some programs, complete removal and re-installation is needed. The situation may vary from case to case: for example, reinstalling DeaDBeef from deb solved it, Brasero was fixed by complete removal and reinstallation, VLC by full reinstallation but only after removing completely and reinstalling vlc-data, etc.\n", "Q: How to uninstall (or delete) one of 2 ubuntu 12.4 LTS in my computer I have 2 ubuntu 12.04 LTS in my computer.

Other users should not be affected. The best I've found is tc, but it seems way too complicated to do such a simple thing.\n\nA: tc is the correct answer to your configuration needs.\ntc may seem complicated because it manages classfull (and less) queuing disciples which gives it unlimited flexibility and layers of shaping and filtering.\nThis however is not the case. As tc utilizes the built in (or modular) queuing disciples in the kernel it the simplest/best way of limiting bandwidth on a per user basis.\nHere is a sample set-up, I left it in Mbit format but you can change the rate measure to kbps.  \ntc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1:0 htb\ntc class add dev eth0 parent 1:0 classid 1:1 htb rate 1Mbit ceil 1Mbit prio 1\n\nFor you iptables rule just change --uid-owner to the uid of the user you wish to limit, documentation says you can use the users name instead of UID, have not tested that. \niptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -p tcp -m owner --uid-owner 1000 -j CLASSIFY --set-class 1:1\n\nFYI even though you do not need an HTB I would recommend it based on the available options and what speed you are limiting to.\n", "Q: How to make my backlit keyboard work? My laptop is Toshiba Satellite A660.\nMy backlit keyboard works in Windows 7 with no problems, but doesn't work when I'm running Ubuntu. Is it possible to make my backlit keyboard work with Ubuntu 12.10?\n\nA: Unfortunately, it seems that Ubuntu has identified this problem and offloaded it to the Linux team to fix: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/683133\nPage 4 of this ubuntuquestions thread mentions the bug in ACPI module.

I'd really like to have some variation of Ubuntu running on this device.\nCan someone point me in the right direction?\n\nA: The spec sheet (pdf warning) for the MC659B shows that it uses a Qualcomm MSM7627 CPU, a family that is well-suported by Android for mobile phones. CodeAurora seems to be running a project to further the Linux support for this SoC family.\nIt looks like the MSM7627 core was later included in the Snapdragon S1, so you might have a smooth time installing Linux.\nFurther specs show you get 512MB RAM/1GB Flash, plenty of space for a minimal OS.

What are some reasons it may have happened? How can I resolve it?\nUPDATE\nfstab is as follows:\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\n# / was on /dev/sda5 during installation\nUUID=ead12a48-4a3b-4e3a-b611-d3fc62e8716a /               ext4    errors=remount-ro,noatime,nodiratime 0       1\n# /home was on /dev/sda6 during installation\nUUID=217f1c44-5d04-4c75-9d4a-2a70b1726434 /home           ext3    defaults,noatime,nodiratime        0       2\n\nUPDATE 2\ncat /var/log/fsck/{checkfs,checkroot} returns (Nothing has been logged yet.) twice.\n\nA: Your only ext3 partition happens to be /home. One possible reason for your problem is that /home isn't being unmounted because it is in use at the time your system is being shut down. Since /home shouldn't be in use when no normal user is logged in, identifying if it is in use when nobody is logged in is one way of identifying if this particular possible issue is the cause of your specific problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Temporarily enable root login on your system (we'll disable it again later). This will allow you to log in without accessing /home, so that you can check whether anything else is using it and whether it unmounts correctly.\n\n*Log out.\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to a text virtual terminal.\n\n*Log in as root. This will start a shell in root's home directory (/root) which is outside of /home.\n\n*Try to unmount /home by typing umount /home (no sudo is required since you're already root).\n\n*If this succeeds, then this isn't your problem. If it fails, then this is your problem. If the reason is that the filesystem is in use, then the command fuser -m /home will list processes using /home which you can investigate.\n\n*Mount /home again by typing mount /home.\n\n*Log out with the command exit.\n\n*Switch back to the graphical login screen by pressing Alt+F7.\n\n*Log back in as yourself.\n\n*Disable root login to return your system to its original configuration.\nThis may or may not identify the cause of your specific problem, but should work to identify processes that are preventing /home from being cleanly unmounted on system shutdown in the general case.\n\nA: As you mentioned in your comment eCryptfs is a possible cause for your problem. To check this out do the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out and log in as a different user\n\n*Try to open your files in /home/richard (or however your user is called).\n\n*If you can access and read the files, your home was not correct unmounted.\n\n\nAnother thing you can do as user is to enter ecryptfs-umount-private. This scripts quits on success with the message:\n\nYour private directory has been unmounted.\n\nOn error you might get the message:\n\nfopen: No such file or directory\nCannot chdir into mountpoint.\n\n\nIn the latter case the problem are often missing symlinks. So do the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login as your normal user\n\n*Make sure your home directory is not encrypted (You can read all files).\n\n*Open a terminal (If you are working in a terminal, just type cd to get into your $HOME).\n\n*Type ln -s /home/.ecryptfs/YOUR_USERNAME/.ecryptfs and ln -s /home/.ecryptfs/YOUR_USERNAME/.Private.\n\n\nThe main point are the symbolic links in the last step. In some cases they are missing. This leads to not encrypting and umounting your data in the home.\nHowever if the problem persists then there might also the file $HOME/.ecryptfs/auto-umount missing. If this is the case your home directory will not be automatically unmounted. Just enter touch $HOME/.ecryptfs/auto-umount to change it.\n", "Q: How to create a complete backup ISO to an external hard drive?

However, it is really designed for exactly one thing: back up (and restore) the entire drive including the MBR.\nCloneZilla needs a little more understanding than RedoBackup, but it is more flexible. You can back up the entire drive or only selected partitions, and when you restore you can decide what to restore. This is useful if you have (say) an encrypted swap area, or you do not wish to restore the MBR.\nMy personal experience is that CloneZilla is extremely reliable. I cannot comment on RedoBackup, as I have used it only experimentally.\nThe biggest advantages of RedoBackup and CloneZilla are (1) they back up only what needs to be backed up, and compress the data at the same time; and (2) they are easier to use than dd commmands.\nNote that they do not back up into a single .img file, but instead into a folder (chosen by you). You use that folder when restoring.\n", "Q: What is colord-sane and why does it show up on lsof internet watch?

Kubuntu won't let me use it as a joystick and says something like the nintendo controller not being in /dev/ or something like that.\nI am fairly new to linux and don't feel very comfortable changing system settings from the command line. Yeah i can do it, but if things don't work out I have to remember what to change back, how to change it back and what to change it back to.

Your advice was very helpful.\nThis is what I did to get the wii controller working: \n1- Connect bluetooth radio to computer.\n2- Use the package manager to find and install \"wminput\" and \"wmgui\"\n3- Restart for good measure (not sure if it is necessary or not)\n4- Confirm that Wii remote works properly by using wmgui.\n5- Copy \"/etc/cwiid/wminput/buttons\" to \"/home/[username]/Documents\"\n6- Changed the copied buttons file to suit my needs (detailed below)\n7- Open a terminal\n8- run \"sudo wminput -c /home/[username]/Documents/buttons\"\n9- Play Kobo for a while (tweak settings in buttons file)\n10- Start Mednafen\n11- Configure button mappings in Mednafen with ALT+SHIFT+[number]\n12- Play Mednafen, have fun  \nTo stop wminput, hold the power button on the wii remote. Then you can mess around with the different button settings in the config file. Save the configuration and restart wminput with the same command as before.  \nHere is what is in my buttons file: \n=======================================================\n#custom buttons  \nPlugin.led.Led1 = 1\nPlugin.led.Led4 = 1  \nWiimote.A       = BTN_LEFT\nWiimote.B       = BTN_RIGHT\nWiimote.Up      = KEY_LEFT\nWiimote.Down    = KEY_RIGHT\nWiimote.Left    = KEY_DOWN\nWiimote.Right   = KEY_UP\nWiimote.Minus   = KEY_BACKSPACE\nWiimote.Plus    = KEY_ENTER\nWiimote.Home    = KEY_TAB\nWiimote.1       = KEY_RIGHTSHIFT\nWiimote.2       = KEY_RIGHTCTRL  \nNunchuk.C       = KEY_LEFTSHIFT\nNunchuk.Z       = KEY_LEFTCTRL  \nClassic.Up      = KEY_UP\nClassic.Down    = KEY_DOWN\nClassic.Left    = KEY_LEFT\nClassic.Right   = KEY_RIGHT\nClassic.Minus   = KEY_BACKSPACE\nClassic.Plus    = KEY_ENTER\nClassic.Home    = KEY_TAB\nClassic.A       = BTN_LEFT\nClassic.B       = BTN_RIGHT\nClassic.X       = KEY_X\nClassic.Y       = KEY_Y\nClassic.ZL      = BTN_LEFT\nClassic.ZR      = BTN_RIGHT\nClassic.L       = KEY_L\nClassic.R       = KEY_R  \n=======================================================  \nI have the remote turn on led numbers one and four so I know the remote is on and connected to my computer, as opposed to connected to the wii. I am sure there are better ways to configure it, but so far this one works for me. I have not tested the nunchuck or classic controller, but I do suspect that they will work as they should.\nI was also thinking of using wminput like this:\n\"sudo wminput -d -c /home/[username]/Documents/buttons\"\nso that it will automatically connect whenever the 1 and 2 buttons are pressed on the wii remote. Is there a way to issue this command automatically at startup?\n\nA: For Wiimote wmgui, wminput and friends are the right way to go. First thing to do would be to use wmgui and try to connect the controller, if it works and all buttons respond, then you can move on to wminput and try to map them to a joystick. wminput already comes with a bunch of example configs, they can be used like:\n$ wminput -c /etc/cwiid/wminput/gamepad\n\nor\n$ wminput -c gamepad\n\nWhen you don't give the full patch, wminput will look for configs in ~/.cwiid/wminput/gamepad, so that's where you should store your custom configs.\nThe manpage of wminput:\n$ man wminput\n\nContains further information.\nFor the PS3 controller you will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*QtSixa: http://qtsixa.sourceforge.net/\nThe Xbox360 controller are not Blutooth, but Microsofts own protocol, so you will need the Microsoft Wireless Receiver USB dongle first. After that they work out of the box with a standard kernel. You can however get some more configuration with:\n\n\n*\n\n*xboxdrv: http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/\nAnd generally speaking, if you want to make sure that your joystick is setup correctly in Linux you want to play around with evtest and jstest (they are in the evtest and joystick package). They can be used like:\n$ evtest /dev/input/event0\n\nand\n$ jstest /dev/input/js0\n\nUse different numbers for different devices. The js stuff is only joysticks, so there normally should only be js0, but the event interface contains everything on your computer that will send input events, keyboards, mouse, etc. so there are lots of different event devices and you have to just try them all to find your joystick, it will generally be the last one if plugged in last.\n", "Q: Dropbox-Client does not work I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 (64bit) and can't get the Dropbox-Client to work. I can install it but I don't get to the point where I should be asked for my user information (mail adress/password).\nWhat I already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing the package nautilus-dropbox\n\n*Installing the package from https://www.dropbox.com/install\n\n*Download from https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86 an run with dropbox start\n\n*Removing the folders .dropbox and dropbox-dist between the different approaches\n\n\nSometimes a window pops up, telling me that there was a 'Connection Error' with Dropbox and I should check my settings.\n\nI do not use a proxy.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I have dropbox working well on multiple 12.10 (32 bit) computers.  Are you using 64 bit?  \nI would suggest removing the nautilus extension and deleting all traces of dropbox in your home directory (such as the .dropbox hidden folder).\nI then use ubuntu-tweak to install a new version of dropbox.  When it installs I got a message about it being in the wrong location, but it's worked fine for me.\n", "Q: Colour Calibration Hardware Compatible with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I have a Thinkpad W520 and it has a Pantone colour calibrator.I looked it up here and in Google Search but as it seems the gnome colour manager can't use it as calibrating device at all(maybe there is no driver at all to do so,but anyway this is not the key issue). So I was wondering if there is any other colour calibrating hardware(from Pantone or any other decent company) which will be compatible with Ubuntu.There is I am asking this is because I have noticed that in Windows 7 where the Pantone colour calibrator of my laptop works,the eye strain is not happening so often it when it happens it usually is noticeable after a 2-3 hours where in Ubuntu I get it usually after 40 minutes of continuous use.\nIf by the way there is a way to make Ubuntu to use the colour of the laptop if you do not mind please explain to avoid any additional expenses from the purchase of a new colour calibration hardware. \n\nA: I found a solution to my problem.The developers/developer who are/is making the dispcalGUI they mention which devices are supported by their software.You can see it to their website HERE\nSo I guess I will go for X-Rite i1 Display Pro.I would like to go for a Huey Pro,but I looked it up on the web and there were people telling that Pantone is not supporting any more that specific device and whoever has a newer/more modern screen (either laptop screen or a normal PC monitor or MAC monitor) might not be able to make it work properly with them and make the colors look nothing,but normal.\n\nA: For Linux supported hardware, there's the ColorHug, which was created by Richard Hughes, the principal developer of GNOME Color Manager. I have one, and can recommend it. It comes with a liveCD you can use to calibrate almost any x86-based system; I've used it on Macs, too.\nAlternatively, you could search your Windows partition and see where the Pantone calibrator has put the ICC file for your display. If it uses a standard file, it should be usable with Ubuntu. Don't forget that some applications — notably Firefox (for details, fiddle about with the settings described here) — use their own colour management framework.\n", "Q: tuxguitar doesn't play any sound I have just installed tuxguitar. It runs correctly, with one exception which is quite crucial - it doesn't play sounds at all. How can it be fixed?\nI don't know the model of my sound card and don't know how to check it or install drivers All other audio players and options run ok. Could there be a problem with the MIDI port?\n\nA: You will need something to actualy make sound of the midifile that tuxguitar really is. So a midi player (i.e. a softsynth). There are complicated ones like fluidsymth. But the easiest is to use the plugin that goes with tuxguitar. It is a plugin so it might not be installed automatically.\nGo to tuxguitar in the Ubuntu Software center and look if you have the java plugin plugin for playback installed. If you havn't, do so. After that you are going to have to enable it in TuxGuitar. Go to the tuxguitar menu to:\nTools --> Settings --> Sound\nUnder midiport select Gervill\nand you have sound.\nLet us know if that worked\n\nA: Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the TiMidity++ midi sequencer (apt://timidity-interfaces-extra).\n\n*Make sure you have tuxguitar-alsa (apt://tuxguitar-alsa), tuxguitar-oss (apt://tuxguitar-oss), and tuxguitar-jsa (apt://tuxguitar-jsa) installed.\n\n*Launch TuxGuitar, open Tools/Settings/Sound, and under Midi Port choose Gervill or TiMidity Port [x] (128:[x]) (where x is a number in the range of the available midi ports - usually 0..3).\n\n\nYou're good to go!\n", "Q: Will I lose Unity-2d if I upgrade to 12.10 I want to continue to use Unity-2d which I have setup on my 12.04 install...but some of the new 12.10 features I would like to use. \n\n\n*\n\n*new Disk utility with auto mount settings built in\n\n*easier printer setup\n\n*unity webapps\n\n*and more new updates\n\n\nwill i lose unity 2d when I run the upgrade (from update manager)\n\nA: If you run the upgrade, you will lose the option called \"Unity 2D.\" Ubuntu made some architectural changes from 12.04 to 12.10, one of which was consolidating the two versions of Unity into one codebase. The new \"Unity\" option can automatically switch to CPU operation when it detects that your graphics hardware is insufficient.\nPhoronix wrote an article confirming the changes, and their article notes that the new version of CPU-operated Unity will run best on 64-bit machines.\nYou might want to try a LiveCD version of 12.10 to see how Unity behaves before you run the upgrade, because once you do upgrade there is no easy way to downgrade again.\n\nA: Well, Ubuntu 12.10 is to taxing for some older hardware. This is the way of the world, but Canonical has tried to make Unity work with both older and new hardware. If you can use Unity-2D, you should simply be able to upgrade and not notice much of a slowdown. \nIf this slowdown is too much, perhaps you could use a different desktop environment? There are quite a few nice, lightweight ones that work great on hardware that can't run unity. I'd recommend E17, KDE, MATE or Cinnamon. \nOr, if you want to really speed up your system, you could even try another linux distro.\n", "Q: Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10 boot problem I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my computer that had Windows 8 pre-installed.

For all of those that have the same issue. Ubuntu 10.04 uses rsyslog and the default file is:\n/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf\n\nIf you want to disable postfix logging just comment out the lines associated with \"mail\", the file is pretty self-explanatory.\n", "Q: Half of my disk space is assigned to Ubuntu. How can I move some to Windows? I don't need half my disk space on Ubuntu and I would love to move it back to Windows without having to uninstall and install Ubuntu all over again. I'd appreciate any help on this.\n\nA: Use an Ubuntu live-CD and run Gparted to change the allocated partitions on your disk.  You can also download GParted and create a dedicated bootable CD or USB drive.  A tutorial on the use of Gparted is available at:  http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gparted.html \nNote that, depending on your disk setup, you may have to shrink the Ubuntu partition first in order to create some unallocated space, and then move the Ubuntu partition to the right so that the unallocated space is immediately to the right of the windows partition.  You can then resize the Windows partition to use all the unallocated space.  This assumes that Windows was loaded first and occupies the front of the drive. \n", "Q: Is there any security alarm? I have friend that leaves an awful amount of time his laptop unattended. Its is not me, it would be stupid tip for thieves to ask this publicly if it was me :p.\nI was thinking of an alarm that could boost the volume and fire up in case someone would unplug my friend's computer and take it.\nOf course it would be useless if someone would plug some headphones or remove the battery, but still this could be a \"life\" saver in case of an unfortunate event.\nIf not, is there a terminal command to check if the battery is still plugged? Maybe an easy bash script can be made for this effect.\n\nA: The following bash script will check the state of the battery every 5 seconds. If the state is \"discharging\", it enters an alarm loop where it maximizes the master system volume and rings the terminal bell every 0.1 seconds until the state is returned to something other than \"discharging\". Attempting to mute the system will not silence the script, as it will set the system volume back to the maximum value at every inner loop iteration. The purpose of the slower outer loop is to minimize the impact of the state checks on your system resources.\n#/usr/bin/env bash\n\ncmd=\"upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | grep -i state\"\n\nwhile true\ndo\n  result=`eval $cmd | awk '{print $2}'`\n  if [ $result == \"discharging\" ]\n  then\n    while [ $result == \"discharging\" ]\n    do\n      amixer set Master 100\n      echo -e '\\a'\n      sleep .1\n      result=`eval $cmd | awk '{print $2}'`\n    done\n  fi\n  sleep 5\ndone\n\nYou can set this to run at system boot by running crontab -e and then adding something like @reboot /path/to/script, where the path points to this script.\nYou can kill the script by running top and finding a bash process with a very low PID (since it started right at system boot), and then feeding its PID to kill.\n\nA: My earlier comment lacked a good explanation and may not have conveyed the initial message properly, therefore I'll try my best to write a better understandable answer. Please note that tough you wrote on behalf of a friend I'll be writing \"you\" where I mean your friend. It's for other potential readers that seek for such a solution and for convenience.\nAlarms mostly do not work as they were intended or they do harm people. An alarm should alert people with the message: there is something going on here that should not happen, please look after it. In this scenario you are relying on other people to take responsibility for a device that you as an owner did not want to take. This is crazy.\nIf you want other people to take care of something for you just ask them kindly. If you don't trust them, then an alarm would not add anything security wise, it would be as if there is noboddy there except the potential attacker and s/he would not care if an alarm goes off. If s/he has just interest in the hardware, s/he would just turn the device off, pretending to be the owner and walk away. (There are also several security attacks against software and data, some of them have been showed off by Darren Kitchen on HAK5.) This is the usual scenario where an alarm does not alert and therefore does not work. I know, there is the scenario where the alarm is so powerful that it physically harms people and might keep attackers away. For 4-5 seconds, that is. That's how long it takes to shut the device down. But what right have you to harm all the other people sitting there, that do you no harm just for some fake sense of security for a device that you yourself as an owner do not want to take proper responsibility of?\nAlso note that some people like me manage to bring that 5 seconds down to almost zero by throwing the offending device out of the window, applying force or do other things. And also note that I take noise dampening ear plugs with me where ever I go and more people might be doing the same if this false sense of (IT-)Security gets popular.\nAlarms do not work in the public, neither do surveilance cameras. There have been numerous cases where people where getting robbed and molested with cameras waching. Therefore: taking your device with you is the best protection.\nI don't want to accuse anyone of deliberately doing harm to other people and I don't want sound depressed and fed up with society. I am just asking you to at least take responsibility for your own stuff, because if you don't do, other people will think the same way about their stuff and other people. You can imagine where this leads us to.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Synchronize Folder not working I am trying to synchronize the Pidgin folder .purple in Ubuntu One.  However it is not synchronizing.  I was able to get this to work with a previous version of Ubuntu.  I am currently running Ubuntu 12.10.   \n\nThe status of Ubuntu One appears to be fine:\n$ u1sdtool --status\nState: QUEUE_MANAGER\n    connection: With User With Network\n    description: processing the commands pool\n    is_connected: True\n    is_error: False\n    is_online: True\n    dqueues: IDLE\n\nWhen selecting another folder to synchronize with Ubuntu One, after first selecting to synchronize, if you right click the folder again and select the Ubuntu One option it says \"Stop Synchronizing This Folder\".  But this is not the case with the .purple folder.  Is there are an issue with synchronizing hidden folders?\nUpdate\nThe strange thing is, this doesn't happen on my machine at work.  Although it still isn't properly syncing.\n\nThe Ubuntu One status is the same on my machine at work\n$ u1sdtool --status\nState: QUEUE_MANAGER\n    connection: With User With Network\n    description: processing the commands pool\n    is_connected: True\n    is_error: False\n    is_online: True\n    queues: IDLE\n\nUpdate 2\nI have run the Ubuntu Control Panel Applet and saw that on my home machine the sync to .purple directory was not set up.  So I set that up, but it seems like I can only access the files in the .purple directory in the Ubuntu One Service and not locally on my machine.  I was expecting to be able to do things like grep the logs directory within the .purple directory but this no longer seems possible.  Is there something else that needs to be set up?\nWhen you sync a directory that is located outside of the Ubuntu One directory, can you only access the files on the Ubuntu One website dashboard : Ubuntu One Service?\nUpdate 3\nI can see the synced folders in the dashboard of Ubuntu One Service but can these folders be accessed in a terminal?\n\nA: I had this problem and to fix it I did a few things. Lets hope it works for you as well.\nFirst run the Ubuntu Control Panel Applet via Terminal, that way if there are any funnies you will see additional error messages in terminal over and above normal error messages fro the GUI app.\nubuntuone-control-panel-qt\n\nFrom there add the folder manually by clicking the big add folder command at the bottom to see if that works, as the \"add\" via Nautilus doesn't.\nI also manually logged into Ubuntu One Service and deleted some of my old computers syncs I wasn't using anymore.\nAlso check to see that the file syncs are getting through via the files tab on the web version of Ubuntu One.\nI also logged out and rebooted to ensure the Sync would restart, although it seems your u1sdtool --status command worked whereas mine never didn't.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: Any folder outside of ~/Ubuntu One within your home directory that you choose to synchronize with the service will be synchronized fully, on any of your machines where it is subscribed. The folder is only subscribed by default on the machine which you enabled the synchronization from. All other machines will require you to subscribe to the folder using the ubuntuone-control-panel-qt application, or u1sdtool in a terminal.\nIf you have subscribed to the folder, and it is not synchronizing fully, it is possible that you may be encountering a bug, and should report it using ubuntu-bug ubuntuone-client or request support by filling the Ubuntu One support contact form.\n\nA: I think you can't synchronise hidden folders (it's names start with .) - try to rename .purple as a eg.

Therefore if your partition is only 5% full, it will still take as long as if it were completely full.  To get a faster copy, you can shrink the partition before moving it.\nWhen gparted resizes a partition, the empty sectors aren't necessarily preserved.  If you didn't want this to occur and you specifically do want your empty sectors to be left alone, you'd have to make sure it's not resizing the partition, only moving.\n", "Q: Searching for MD5SUMS of 12.04 Daily Build on January 19th I downloaded and burned Precise Pangolin Daily Build on 19th January 2013 but forgot to gather the MD5Sum... which was a bad idea since I'd like to verify the file & disk now.\nIs there an archive for Daily Builds MD5SUMs?\nThe iso file was called precise-desktop-amd64.\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\nA: I'm assuming you want to make sure the file wasn't inadvertently corrupted (rather than concerned about it being deliberately modified in a man-in-the-middle attack).\nYou'll likely have some difficulty finding the MD5SUM for the file.

Logout doesn't work; it tells me to use exit.  Exit closes the terminal but when I open a new terminal nothing has changed.  Do I need to reboot my whole system?\n\nA: I think you're trying to change the shell being used when you use your terminal emulator (such as urxvt, gnome-terminal, xterm) or when you use the console. My assumption is that you're logged into a graphical environment such as gnome-shell/unity/etc. and exit just closes your terminal emulator window and quite rightly so.\nTry logging out of your X session and then back in. exit would have worked if you were logged in using a console (most likely tty1-6, accessible via CTRL+ALT+F1-6). Of course it would have worked but only for that and the following console sessions - it wouldn't influence your already running X session's behaviour.\n\nA: logout works only when you use tty - computer terminal accessible from Ctrl+Alt+F1 through F6. This is probably not what you want.\nIf you want to log-out from Unity desktop you need to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*log-out through GUI (power button in the top right hand side corner\nor by pressing Alt and typing in Log Out in the Unity\nHUD)  \n\n*or run gnome-session-quit in terminal emulator (like gnome-terminal).\n\n\n\nYeah, reboot would work too :)\n", "Q: EasyBCD removed all boot menus I recently tried to use EasyBCD to edit some things and apparently ended up corrupting it some how. I'm dual booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu.\nWindows boot manager pops up, now, and says:\nWindows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. \nTo fix the problem:\n\n 1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer. \n 2. Choose your language settings, and then click \"Next.\" \n 3. Click \"Repair your computer.\"\n\nIf you don't have this disc, contact your system administrator or computer manufacturer for assistance. \n\nFile: \\Boot\\BCD\nStatus: 0xc0000098\nInfo: The boot config data file doesn't contain valid information for an operating system.\n\nI was wondering if there is any way inside the Ubuntu CD to restore Windows and Ubuntu bootloaders.\n\nA: What you can do is to get Boot-repair on your linux live cd, and install grub using that. Then you can either work with that, or login to windows and redo your EasyBCD setup.\n\nA: Fixed.\nHow I did it:\n1. Put in my Ubuntu disk and loaded up Boot-repair. Used reccomended settings to get Grub back.\n2. Created a Windows 8 disk and went into command prompt with it. Used the commands listed here.\n\nA: Firstly I'm sorry for the long answer. \nThis solution is for the ones with no windows installation or repair disc. \nI had a similar problem, the same error message,  but I had no windows installation disc. I couldn't boot Ubuntu either. I thought everything was lost. So then I used Ubuntu live USB which I had and chose to \"Try Ubuntu before installing\"  and performed boot repair and finally I could get Ubuntu working. (finally relieved that something was working). Then I added windows option to the Ubuntu grub menu. I got windows 8 loader option in the grub while booting but same error when I select it. I googled a lot but found no solution and I  gave up. But finally after a few days I realized something and tried it. It worked right. I hope this would be really helpful for someone out there who struggled like me. \nTHE  SOLUTION  : EasyBCD actually creates a backup of your BCD file. (or you would have been prompted to create one when you run the software)\nI could access windows files from the drive in Ubuntu. Then I searched for the location where easybcd was installed and  and found backups of the bcd file. (gave me little hope that something could be possibly done) \nThen I went to the folder \"Root\" of windows and found a file named BCD. I copied the file to other directory (just in case if I needed  it later).\nNext step  I removed the BCD File (I didn't know if it was advisable to do it) and copy pasted the .bcd backup file into  the root folder.(The file had a name like EasyBCD Backup(-date-).bcd    )\nThen I renamed the file as BCD ( same as the one I deleted) without the extensions .bcd  (the file I deleted was plainly called BCD)\nAfter that restarted the laptop and chose the windows option from the grub and............ To my surprise..................  it worked. \nIt was a great relief as I was very new to all these things and had completely lost hope. \nI hope this helps \n", "Q: How do I enable wifi channels 12-14 when traveling outside the United States?

I have been trying to burn the OS to a DVD for two days now. It keeps failing no matter what I do, I have done everything that the instructions asked and I have tried on both a mac and a windows xp computer. Does anyone have any suggestions? I also put it on a USB stick but for some reason I cant boot from it (trying to install on a mac mini) \nThanks.\n\nA: We can't tell you why it's failing without you providing significantly more information--the exact make and model of your Mac Mini, what file you've downloaded, if you've verified its integrity (see below), precisely how you're trying to burn it and how you're trying to write it to a USB flash drive, with what utility, what settings, (for the burn) what speed, whether it's DVD+R or DVD-R and the make and model of your DVD drive (which you can usually get in the Windows device manager -- Start > Run... > devmgmt.msc; and on the Mac, in Apple System Profiler or, better, in the manuals).\nI can give you some tips, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*You're installing on a Mac, so if you're installing the 64-bit version of Ubuntu, use the Mac image. (This is not a CPU difference; rather, Macs can have trouble booting the usual, multi-catalog ISO images.) So if you're installing the 64-bit version, make sure you use the ISO image with amd64+mac in the name--not just amd64. (That's this one.)\nNow that is assuming your Mac Mini has an Intel processor. But if you have an old Mac Mini, that is not the case. If you have a Mac with a PPC processor (probably a G5), you'll have to use the PPC version of Ubuntu (available here). On the other hand, if your Mac has an Intel processor, make sure you are not using that version.\n\n*MD5SUM the ISO image; make sure it's good.\n\n*Make sure you're burning the ISO to the DVD properly (see the Windows and OS X instructions). In particular (and while you may know this many people do not): don't make a DVD with one file on it such that this file is the ISO, and don't unpack the ISO image and burn its contents to DVD.\n\n*Burn the DVD at the slowest possible speed. This can often reduce errors and lessen the impact of any damage or incompatibilities between the DVD media and your drive.\n\n*Check to see that your DVD media is not damaged before you start the burn, and make sure it is compatible with your burner in both type (there's DVD-R and DVD+R, and there's single and dual layer for each) and speed (discs have a maximum speed).\n\n*Make sure the DVD media are of a type compatible with the machine on which you're trying to install. Remember that many computers are capable of reading media they cannot boot.\n\n*You have not said how it fails. If it doesn't boot at all--the same as if you'd put an unbootable data DVD or a blank DVD in the drive--then try booting it on the other computer (the Windows XP machine). Hold down Shift and select Check disc for defects--see if there are errors. If any files are shown to be bad, that means it's a bad burn, you shouldn't attempt to install from that DVD, and corruption elsewhere on it may explain why it didn't boot at all on the Mac. On the other hand, if it boots on the Mac but doesn't get very far then try to run Check disc for defects on the Mac. (This doesn't just test the DVD installation medium but also will indicate failure if your computer is unable to read the disc.)\n\n\nFor trying to install from USB:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the correct ISO image (as explained above).\n\n*MD5SUM the ISO image (as above).\n\n*Make sure you're writing the USB flash drive correctly. This is likely what's going wrong. A USB flash drive created using UNetbootin or the Universal USB Installer will not boot on a Mac. You must instead open Applications > Utilities > Terminal in OS X and use this technique.\n\n*As with the DVD, try booting the USB flash drive on the PC if it cannot boot on the Mac, and run Check disc for defects (see above for more detailed explanation). In spite of its confusing name, this boot menu option applies equally to CD/DVD and USB media.\n\n\nHopefully that has enabled you to solve the problem. But if not, you can edit your question to describe in detail what happened when you tried all this (and also what happened originally--exactly how you'd created the DVD and USB media, how you tried to boot it, what happened when you tried to boot it, and so forth).\n\n\n*\n\n*For people using this answer other than this question's author, you can post a new question, providing this information. (If this and any other answers here don't help you, you should probably not assume you have exactly the same problem.)\n\n\nA: Well, if have a flash drive that can hold the iso file, you can try making a startup disk on the usb. I prefer using usb's to install an OS.\n", "Q: grep \"something\" anyfiles.log > afile.csv , don't need to print the input path and file name to CSV file I have some logs files, they have more than 30000 lines.

However, I suspect you only have access to a subset of the files.\nIn that case, take a look at http://portablelinuxapps.org/. They have builds of Firefox and Chromium that run out of a local directory.

Try booting into Ubuntu and adding a menu entry like:\nmenuentry \"Microsoft Windows Vista/7/8 x86_64 UEFI-GPT\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod fat\n    insmod search_fs_uuid\n    insmod chain\n    search --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,gpt1 --hint-efi=hd0,gpt1 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,gpt1 1ce5-7f28\n    chainloader /efi/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nThe precise setup for the 'hd0,gpt1' sections might be different for your installation, also the UUID at the end '1ce5-7f28' will be different - the guide in the page I posted gives detail on how to find it.\nTo add the entry to grub in Ubuntu open a terminal and enter\nsudo gedit /etc/grub.d/30_custom\n\nOr possibly 40_custom. Add the entry, save, and then in terminal again\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: I am also dual booting windows 7 and Linux on separate HD for each one. The way I did it....\nI installed Linux on its own hard drive from a thumb drive that I burned the iso file on, I used Unetbootin to do this.\nBefore installing Linux onto its own hard drive, I unplugged the windows hard drive from the mother board, then booted up from the boot menu, selected the thumb drive, boot Linux from there, and use the install selection from the desktop after Linux boots up. Make sure you have other USB hard drives disconnected when you do this. Install the whole Linux program to the hard drive you select. Doing it this way, prevents the Linux boot-loader from installing onto the windows hard drive, if you leave the windows hard drive plugged in while installing to the other hard drive, the Linux boot-loader (which is superior to the windows boot-loader) will be installed on the windows hard drive, and will be the primary way your computer boots up.\nWhen finished doing the install, shut down, go back and plug in the windows hard drive back into the mother board.\nNow when you boot up... your windows hard drive is the primary drive to boot from, and just starting your computer will boot windows7.\nIf you want to boot Linux, when you start your computer, tap the Esc key, or whichever key will get you to the boot menu, when the boot menu appears, use the arrow keys (next to the number keypad on most keyboards), use the down arrow key to move the highlighted selection to the drive you installed Linux on, hit the Enter key, Linux will boot up.\nDoing it this way, requires nothing to be changed in the BIOS, and puts Linux boot-loader away from windows, now if the boot-loader is installed in the windows drive, and for some reason you need to re-install your windows o/s, you will lose the boot-loader, and will not have any way to boot your Linux system.\nI have been doing it this way for a couple years and have had no problems.\nIf you are going to switch from one system to another, do a complete shutdown of the system you are currently on, and NOT a restart, If you do a restart the current system you are on will still keep charge of your sound card and other devices you use, and things will not function properly, you have to do a complete shutdown and reboot to change o/s.\n", "Q: Does Microsoft Office run in Crossover/Wine/Playonlinux? I'm a student so I kinda need full compatibility with Microsoft Office Documents for school.  I was wondering if Office will run without major problems in Crossover, Wine, or playonlinux?\n\nA: The answer is yes. In fact the other two are also based on Wine.\nConsidering just Wine, see this question. But later versions of MSOffice, 2007 and 2010, are much easier to install in Wine than older versions like 2003 and XP. For 2007 and later see my other answer. (Personally, I was not able to install msoffice xp or 2003 in Wine, although I deem it possible.).\nPlayonlinux has the advantage of offering the possibility of using different versions of Wine for different programs or program versions. See this answer for more details on installing msoffice 2007.\nCrossOver greatly facilitates the installation of MSOffice, even of different versions that could be used in parallel, new and old. (I was able to install very easily msofficexp.) This is a very useful and recommendable application, especially for the users who want the comfort and are ready to pay for it.\n(To make things even smoother, you can improve appearance of the programs installed in this way; for Wine and playonlinux, look here; for crossover, here.) \nRelated answer here.\n\nA: 2007 would probably work under wine. It has .docx support, and that is the main codec you would be worried about. 2010 might work, but I wouldn't push my luck. Wine can be frustrating.\n\nA: It depends what version of wine and Office you are trying to use.  The wine app database is a great resource for finding information on what runs well in wine and what doesn't. According to the Office Installer db entry, the installers for 2000 through 2007 work reasonably well and the 32 bit version of 2010.  Anything after that runs like \"garbage\" in wine. After checking the installer there are different entries for each of the different components of Office.\nWord - Excel - PowerPoint - Access - FrontPage - Outlook - OneNote - Publisher - Project - Visio - Schedule+ - Groove\nOne thing to note about these entries is that they are based on subjective reviews. That being said, they are the best resource for this sort of thing and I usually find them to be pretty accurate.\n\nA: Yes, it will run. The only problem you will face is that when office is installed this way, it will be installed for one user only.\nYou can copy or use links to the wine folder, but you have to edit all the wine/playonlinux... config files manually, because the user name is hardcoded in the paths. (I simply changed it to $user)\nOffice 2003 works like charm, 2007 has some problems (copy-paste for eg.), 2010 needs to much extra, but it will run also on the newest wine.\n\nA: MS Office 2010 mostly works on Crossover, but some limitations may apply as a marketing small print paragraph would say. iE : No multiple parameter search working in Outlook, no import of whatever source in Access.. It is a bit of a lottery when it comes to what is working and what isn't.. \n", "Q: What documents are available for Juju Design and Architecture?

Do I install English ubuntu and then get a Hungarian language pack or install Hungarian - if this is possible. My partner is Hungarian and wants to use Libre etc with Hungarian user/feature prompts, but I am English and want to maintain the overall support of the programs.\n\nA: There is also a tool available from the Ubuntu Software Center called localepurge.\nSo what you can do is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install your favourite Ubuntu distribution.\n\n*When you are logged in, using the first user account created during installation, fire up a terminal using Ctrl+Alt+t and enter sudo apt-get install localepurge to install localepurge, or simply start up your Ubuntu Software Center and search for localepurge.\n\n*After you downloaded and installed localepurge, configuration takes place. You will be presented with a few dialogboxes, stating what this tool is about and a question will be asked about witch languages you want to have removed. \n\n\nThe only thing you have to do is mark the languages which you want to keep, all the other unselected locales will be removed.\nI assume you have a separate account for your partner. Log in with your partners account and select the preferred locales for this session.\n\nA: You can look at this post - Change the User Interface Language in Ubuntu\nFrom the screenshots it looks a little outdated, the procedure might have changed a little.\nYou should be able to find \"Language Support\" in unity dash that should let you install other languages. So you are safe to install English version of Ubuntu, and then add on Hungarian.\n\nA: If I'm reading you right you will have 2 users on the same computer? Since you want English, it's easiest to install the standard system, creating the first user account for yourself. \nThen use System Settings > User Accounts to create a new user for your partner. When you create the account, you will see an option to set the language for that user. Choose Hungarian. For that user only, it will be just like having installed a Hungarian system.\n", "Q: iBus (Anthy) not working with Skype 4.1.0.20 I got Skype working with iBus (and it took a while at the time), but recently both my working set-up (on 12.04) broke, and any attempts for a new set-up (on 12.10) failed. (On 2 separate computers.)\nThat is to say, iBus does not input in the Skype window any longer. (iBus is running, and selecting the Anthy input method has no effect when the cursor is in the Skype window. It works fine via keyboard shortcut or the iBus menu in other applications.)

And have the qt & gtk versions of ibus installed. Has anything changed for Skype and iBus to stop working?\n\nA: I just found the solution for this! \n/usr/bin/ibus-daemon must be started with -x option. \nI've added 'iBus' to startup applications with following command:\n/usr/bin/ibus-daemon -x -d\n\nI also have following lines in my /etc/environment but I'm not sure if they affect the result somehow (don't really want to experiment now):\nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\" \nLC_ALL=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nGTK_IM_MODULE=ibus\nXMODIFIERS=@im=ibus\nQT_IM_MODULE=ibus\n\nUpdate: variables mentioned above has no any effect really in case of skype\nUpdate 2: on Fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.10 I just installed ibus-qt4 (not ibus!) and selected iBus as IME.

I place wubi.exe and the ISO in the same folder, and run it as administrator. But Wubi still attempts to download the stock 12.10 ISO. The Studio ISO also has a wubi.exe on it, but even that one tries to download the stock image. Is there a way to get this to work? Or does wubi support only stock Ubuntu?\n\nA: Wubi doesn't support Ubuntu Studio... yet. There is a plan to support it from 13.04. It's possible to install it through some workarounds, but it's probably only for adventurous users. See ref here (which talks about installing Xubuntu but the same technique can be used with a caveat contained on the bottom of that post) \nAnother point - if you have Windows 8 preinstalled, or are booting via UEFI (i.e. using a GPT partitioned disk), Wubi won't work at all.\nIf you do want to try it out you could see whether there is a 13.04 version of Wubi.exe available but that would be off-topic for Askubuntu since it's a development release.\n", "Q: Where should I start crond? On my Ubuntu server (LTS 12.04) I would like crond to be running every time I boot up. Where should I configure this? I took a look at service --status-all and saw that cron was there, but it was marked with a question mark.\nIn general, where should a user add daemons that they want to be executed at boot?\n\nA: Normally you add the script that starts a daemon into /etc/rcS.d/ (the S means at Startup) and the script should automatically be launched the next time you boot. (Generally you softlink scripts there from their original path.) This can also be done with the update-rc.d tool {requires root privileges}.\nSadly I'm not sure where exactly the crond starter script is, but it should be automatically configured for you to start up at boot, and before playing with system directories I would say that make a sanity check and see wht happens if you run crontab -e and add in a new line like this: */1 * * * * echo \"Cron works\", and you should get the string Cron works in a system mail (provided that you have postfix configured).\nAlso don't forget to remove the cronjob once it has been tested as it will send that string every minute to you and it quickly gets annoying.\n\nA: According to Andreas Poisel in a similar thread over at stackoverflow, \n\n\n*\n\n*To run a daemon or any command as root before login, add it to /etc/rc.local or add a cron job with @reboot as its time field. You can also write a proper init script based on /etc/init.d/skeleton.\n\n*To run a command after login, add it to ~/.bash_profile (provided you're using bash). Contrary to ~/.bashrc, this file will be executed by login shells only.\n\n*To run a command after login of any new user, add an appropriate .bash_profile to /etc/skel and new users will get this file automatically on account creation.\n", "Q: Record stream with avconv stops prematurley I am trying to simply record a IP camera stream to my harddrive on Ubuntu Linaro.

Unfortunately, that is the world we live in today.\nThat being said the license key infrastructure in MyApps is meant to be simple. The reason is that there are many, many ways to manage drm and no standard mechanism to implement it. Because there are so many ways, we do not have a tutorial or suggestions for best practice.\nWe have developers that use it to email a key which the user must install and we have developers using it to download a key to a specific location at install/purchase of the application. Some require the key for any use of the app (app does not function w/o a key) and some allow for limited use of the app w/o a key and full use with a key.\n\nA: You seem to ask for a DRM system. Licensing generally means \"describing what rights the end user has\".\nAs Zoopster pointed out, there is no standard way to implement such a system. Moreover, there is no foolproof way. Even the biggest commercial companies eventually see their software \"cracked\" sooner or later.\nIt seems to be discouraged, but if you still want a DRM system, developing your own DRM system shouldn't be hard if you have a basic understanding of web applications.\nExample\nYou could have a very simple database with \"keys\" (commonly called serial keys, activation keys, etc.).\n\n\n*\n\n*Each time you \"sell\" a copy, a random key is generated and added to the database.\nThe generated key is also given (e.g. sent by email) to the user.\n\n*The user then enters this key during the installation or the first use of the application.\n\n*Your installer/application sends this key to your key-validation service and the service \"replies\" with a positive answer, allowing the installer/application to proceed.\n\n*If the validation was successful, you might want to delete the key from the database to prevent its re-use. An alternative solution would be to allow multiple installations with a single key (that is, use a \"counter\" for each key, for example).\nImplementation\n\n\n*\n\n*You would need to develop a small web solution that handles the distribution and validation of the keys.\n\n*You would have to add the required functionality to your application, or develop an installer, that communicates with your web service.\n\n\nAnd since you seem to be interested in using the Ubuntu Software Center, you'll want to focus on a \"validation on first run\", because your application will be distributed as a .deb package (that is, your application gets installed by the packet manager, not by your own installer).\n", "Q: How can I synchronize Windows links (.lnk) to 12.10 using Ubuntu One? My problem\nUbuntuOne does not synchronize Windows link files (.lnk). Now, I do not expect UbuntuOne to synchronize the actual links by changing an .lnk file to a linux symlink, nor do I do expect UbuntuOne to copy the actual target file in the Library (as though it were a hard link). But I would love to have UbuntuOne copy the .lnk files themselves. \nThe use case\nI have an identical directory structure on my windows computer (@work) and my 12.10 (@home). At work I have a folder called Library which contains all my pdfs. When I am working on something I put a link to that file in the current working directory. That's nice because all my files are easy to reach and I know which files I have referred to.\nThat would allow me to see what files I quoted. On the long run it would allow me to use a script to convert the .lnk files to symbolic links on 12.10.\nAs a part of this question: do you have a) a proposal of a batch script to convert windows .lnk files to text files and b) a script that converts that text file to a symlink on 12.10. I could run the first script on W$ and the second on 12.10. Or do you have a better solution?\nThe background\nI have read the following questions (and their answers) and I think this is not a duplicate, because I don't want the target file (the file the link refers to) to be copied, but simply the .lnk file itself.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Ubuntu One follow symlinks if synchronizing a folder?\n\n*Does Ubuntu One sync symbolic links with Windows?\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/questions/205330/can-i-synchronize-links-with-ubuntu-one (a bit similar, but closed)\n\n\nA: We do not currently have any proposals to convert lnk files to text files, but you're looking in the right direction. What you could probably do is write a script that watches your U1 directory and calls FindFirstFileNameW on each file (or configured files) to find out what files have links and what the links are called. Then write that to a file which is synchronized by U1, then on your other clients (your linux machine(s)), open that file when it's changed and maintain your file->link setup.\n\nA: Synchronizing your .lnk file to ubuntu would not help you achieve your goal because reading the contents of those files from ubuntu is not easy (if it's possible at all).\nSo, it may be a better idea to do what you propose, export the data in those .lnk files to something, then read it in ubuntu and create symlinks.\nA quick search doesn't tell me anything very interesting about how to actually do it, but I'll ask around.\n", "Q: What software should I install for opening .stl files? I use Ubuntu 12.10. What software can I install that can open Physible .stl files? And what are the differences between these softwares?\n\nA: Blender is the best, just import the file.\n\nA: From OpenSCAD's online User Manual\nSTL Import - http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/STL_Import\nimport_stl(\"filename.stl\", convexity = <val>)\n\nAs of version 2019.01, if you do from the command line:\nopenscad file.stdl\n\nit automatically opens the GUI with the right command to view the file e.g.:\nimport(\"/home/ciro/git/OSP/Hardware/CAD Files/P1 - X-Axis Motor Holder/P1 - X-Axis Motor Holder.STL\");\n\nThen you can click Design > Render, and it gives for this sample file:\n\n\nA: You can use F3D for this task.\nf3d yourFile.stl\n\n\nA: Meshlab reads all kind of 3D meshes, also STL\nsudo apt-get install meshlab\nmeshlab file.stl\n\nExample with this file:\n\n\nA: You could try OpenSCAD.

Please use a command like this:\nimport(\"/home/documents/Screw.stl\", convexity=3); \n\nand push the preview button, as suggested by Hall above.\nThis should work!\nTo edit the .stl as an object in OpenSCAD, create a module like:\nmodule Screw(){\n      import(\"/home/documents/Screw.stl\", convexity=3);\n}\n\nNow you are able to recall it with Screw() for further actions.\n\nA: FreeCAD https://www.freecadweb.org/ also can import *.stl files\n\nA: I use ChiTuBox on Ubuntu 18.04 (I know you were asking about 12.04 but that was 6 years ago!).\nhttps://www.chitubox.com/download.html\n", "Q: Improve Ubuntu 12.10 performance on VM I am using Ubuntu 12.10 on a virtual machine in Win7. It is really slow and I wanted to ask what can I do to improve it. I have set 2GB RAM(from 4GB on physical machine) and 16GB hard disk for the machine. I need to run only Player/Stage simulator from the Ubuntu and some text editor for the source code writing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I lighten the GUI as in windows. There are a lot of animations that I don't really need\n\n*Can you suggest some disabling of applications or services\n\n\nI would appreciate every advice.\n\nA: There are several ways to achieve this and a combination of these might even be better.\n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of the vanilla kernel, you might want to install a virtualization guest kernel, e.g. linux-image-virtual\n\n*Instead of a 3d-accelerated desktop, you might want to try a classic one, like windowmaker or openbox.\n\n*You might start with a text mode install and only add the minimum required packages. \n\n*Your mileage may drop severely if you run a 64-bit guest in a 32-bit host, however running a 32-bit guest in a 64-bit host might work better than 64/64.\n\n*You might want to try a different virtualization software VirtualBox, VirtualPC, ...\n\n*You might check your BIOS if virtualization support is enabled at all.\n\n*Have a look at coLinux or andlinux, these do not virtualize at all and run linux as a user mode application.\n\n*You might want to install the Windows version of Player/Stage after all.\n\n\nA: I see this has been answered already. I had an issue where 12.04 would run unacceptably slow in vbox and the issue was that IO-APIC was not activated.

I have been searching for an answer for days now, thought it was time to ask! I have just setup my first ubuntu server, everything is working perfect. I have internet connection, I can ping every computer on our network but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to add a network attached printer under CUPS or HPLIP.\nI have two HP printers, one attached to a computer at 192.168.1.8 and one attached to a computer at 192.168.1.24. We have 8 windows computers on our network, every one of them can find, view and print. I can ping both of these IP addresses successfully from the ubuntu box, why can I not get these printers to work?\nHPLIP returns:\nwarning: No devices found on the 'net' bus. If this isn't the result you are expecting,\nwarning: check your network connections and make sure your internet\nwarning: firewall software is disabled.\n\nFind New Printers button on CUPS returns:\nNo printers found.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: This is how I have my Ubuntu systems print to a Windows-connected printer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that you have smbclient installed (sudo apt-get install smbclient);\n\n*Open System Settings / Printers / Add printer;\n\n*Choose \"Windows-printer via Samba\". At this point you should be able to search through the network for printers by means of the \"Browse\" button. If the Browse-button is greyed out, and displays a message about \"pysmbc not installed\" when you hover over it, you are hit by this bug. In that case, you will need to specify the correct host name and share name (you can find these on the Windows machine). Press Next.\n\n*Choose HP from the list and press Next.\n\n*Choose the correct model name from the list.\n\n*Fill in a user-friendly name.\n\n\nDone.\n\nA: I was having the same problem. Then I realized I was connected to a VPN which prevented CUPS from finding my network printer. When I disconnected from the VPN the printer came up in the CUPS prompt.\n\nA: I don't know if this will help, but I am printing on a home network to an HP printer with CUPS, with the server being ubuntu desktop rather than ubuntu server.  The way I did this was : \nA. On the server machine \n\n\n*\n\n*System settings > printers\n\n*In the new window, on the menu at very top of screen : server >\nsettings \n\n*In the new window, tick the box \"publish shared printers connected\nto this system\" and click OK\n\n*In the first window, right click on the printer icon and ensure\n\"shared\" is ticked.\n\n\nB. On the client machine \n\n\n*\n\n*System settings > printers\n\n*Click \"add\" box, \"network printer\", \"find network printer\" and the\nserver's printer was there.\n\n*Select it, click \"forward\", and ensure it uses CUPS (ipp://).\nUbuntu server may be completely different, and I am not using HPLIP, but there may be similarities.\n\nA: I was having similar problems. HPLIP was not able to find a printer on the network. The difference was that I have a network printer and not one shared as a window share connected to a computer.\nThe trick with me was to enter the IP of a printer at the finding process. I believe you should also enter an IP of your host computer before the start of finding the printer. The printer adding application will look only ad the specified IP address. It worked for me and I also found some other similar cases.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkPrintingWithUbuntu#Printing_from_Ubuntu\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2171712\nhttp://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-access-windows-shared-printer-ubuntu\nI believe you should connect with SMB protocol, so your printer address would be smb://computer/printer. Maybe you could also try entering the whole printer address manually if the finding process really can't find anything.\n\nA: I would like to add to birdy's answer. I am connecting via VPN to a university campus. The connection has two options: campus and external. The former routes all connections via VPN, the latter -- only those inside the university. Naturally if the connection is set to campus, it cannot find my local network printer. The USB scanner also malfunctioned, which is weird. Setting the connection to external fixed the problem. Both the network printer and the USB scanner work perfectly with VPN on.\nThanks to birdy for pointing to VPN as a source of the problem!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 wireless problem but Windows can work I am a student.

It have several steps. Works for me.\n\nA: Here's one way to debug this.\nWhat you have installed, is not necessarily what you're actually running. It is typical to have old versions of flash installed in various places under ~/.mozilla/plugins for example.\nIn order to figure out what's actually loaded into your browser, I suggest the following 3 step method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Figure out the process id of the process which loads the flash plugin this will depend on the browser, e.g. in firefox, you need to look for a process called plugin-container\n\n*Run lsof -p <pid> | grep libflashplayer (replace <pid> by your step 1 discovered process id), to see the full path from which libflashplayer.so is actually loaded.\n\n*Finally, once you have the full pathname of the libflashplayer DSO you can figure out its version by running strings on it and extracting what looks like a version number (4 numbers separated by dots)\n\n\nHere's a little proof-of-concept shell script implementing which-flash on a running firefox.\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# which flashplayer are we using?\n#\n# look for firefox-bin and/or plugin-container\n#\npat=\"/([f]irefox-b|[p]lugin-co)\"\n\nfor arg in \"$@\"; do\n    case \"$arg\" in\n        moz*)   pat=\"/[m]ozilla\" ;;\n        -x)     set -x ;;\n    esac\ndone\n\n# filter out parent procs (run-mozilla.sh) and grab the pids\npids=`ps xawww | egrep \"$pat\" | grep -v run-mozilla.sh | sed 's,^ *,,' | cut -d' ' -f 1`\n\nfor pid in $pids; do\n    echo ======= pid: $pid =======\n    output=`lsof -p $pid | grep libflashplayer`\n    case \"$output\" in\n        '')  echo \"You need to load flash in the browser first\" 1>&2;\n            exit 1 ;;\n    esac\n    echo \"$output\"\n    # extract the dso from the matching line:\n    dso=`echo $output| awk '{print $NF}'`\n    echo \"flashplayer is in: $dso\"\n    # Also print version of libflashplayer:\n    # Unfortunately there are many numbers in this dso, so we have\n    # to restrict the major version number...\n    echo version: `strings $dso | grep -P '^(1[1-9])\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\$'`\ndone\n\nChrome is similar except in the 1st step you need to look for the process that has a runtime argument like: --plugin-path=/usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so in the ps output.  YMMV.\nThe reason to go through all this process is to ensure you're actually running what you think you are (the official installed version from /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so). If you're not, you can remove the old versions and try to restart the browser to see if it loads the correct version.

Their default permissions are as follows:\n ➜  ls -la /bin/nano\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 192008 Oct  1 15:12 /bin/nano\n\nIt can be executed by owner, group and others. To maintain only owner execution you can use\nsudo chmod g-x /bin/nano\nsudo chmod o-x /bin/nano\n\nAfter this, if you execute it in a terminal as an ordinary user:\n ➜  nano\nbash: /usr/bin/nano: Permission denied\n\nPlease note that this is not a bullet-proof solution. If the application you want to lock has other entry points they could still be accessed. For example, if you tried the same trick with Firefox:\n ➜  ls -la /usr/bin/firefox\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 25 Jan 17 08:26 /usr/bin/firefox -> ../lib/firefox/firefox.sh\n\nEven if you limited access to /usr/bin/firefox, as it is just a link to /usr/lib/firefox/firefox.sh it could be still be executed by there (or using /usr/lib/firefox/firefox, which is used in the .sh file).\n", "Q: Canon MF-3010 printer driver not found!

If you don't know the name, search on google with keyword ID 148f:2070(your usb wlan's id which can be found by command lsusb).\nOr you can just add the wlan name to /etc/modules:\nsudo -i\necho 8192eu >> /etc/modules\nexit\n\nThen the wlan will be activated automatically when system start.\n\nA: First you need to identify the driver for your USB wifi adapter. Execute the following command to get the list of network adapters\nlshw -C network\nFollowing is the kind of output you might notice\n  *-network:0\n       description: Wireless interface\n       physical id: 1\n       bus info: usb@3:5\n       logical name: wlx542aa25b496d\n       serial: 54:2a:a2:5b:49:6d\n       capabilities: ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=rtl8xxxu driverversion=5.0.0-32-generic firmware=N/A ip=172.16.61.0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11\n\n\nCheck the driver and note it down. Assume it is rtl8xxxu and you can use following commands to unplug or plug the adapter via commands\nsudo modprobe -r rtl8xxxu\nsudo modprobe rtl8xxxu\n\nSince this again is manual invocation, you can add the commands in /etc/rc.local\nAdd the following code just before exit 0\nmodprobe -r rtl8xxxu\nsleep 1\nmodprobe rtl8xxxu\n\nInt Ubuntu 18.04 the rc.local file doesn't exists, so you can create with sudo nano /etc/rc.local\nAdd the following part which is taken from Ubuntu 16.04's stock /etc/rc.local file to automate it on system boot\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n\nexit 0\n\nThen add the uplug/plug code before exit 0.

For this I changed the settings as shown below in the screenshot:\n\nI restarted the Gnome environment with Alt+F2+R, but it doesn't work.\n\nA: The answer is: no, they aren't used by Gnome Shell.\nThe reason is simple: those settings are for gnome-panel and gnome-panel is not part of Gnome Shell, it is part of the so-called Gnome Fallback (or Gnome Classic).\nIf you want a proof to be 100% sure, download the source code of both gnome-panel and gnome-shell:\napt-get source gnome-panel gnome-shell\n\nand then look for a property:\ngrep -r unhide-delay\n\nYou'll see that all results come from the gnome-panel package.\n", "Q: How do I fix a \"Can't access Dropbox folder\" error? I'm having a rather strange problem with Dropbox that started a few weeks ago.\nDropbox will stop syncing with the message \"Can't access Dropbox folder\", and refuse to sync until I reboot.\nI've tried restarting Dropbox and logging out, but nothing I seem to do will allow it to sync again short of a reboot.\nThis is not a permissions problem, as the permissions don't change when I suddenly lose access.\nI've checked lsof for anything related to dropbox that might still be hanging on when I stop it. As far as I can tell nothing else other than Dropbox is accessing it's folders when this happens.\n\nA: if you put these in /etc/sysctl.conf:\nfs.inotify.max_user_watches = 1048576\nfs.inotify.max_user_instances = 256\n\nit will fix the issue. You may have to run sudo sysctl -p for these settings to take effect.\nAlternatively, if you are not interested in making these settings permanent, you may try the following commands...\nsudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_instances=256\nsudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=1048576\n\nIn this case the settings will be lost after a reboot.\nThe problem is that the system has run out of inotify instances. You can check your syslog  (e.g. by using tail -f /var/log/syslog) and if you see... \n\ntail: inotify cannot be used, reverting to polling: Too many open file \n\nthen you know this is your issue. For me it was nepomuk.\n\nA: The fs.inotify.max_user_instances=256 fixed my immediate \"Can't access dropbox folder\" problem (Ubuntu 12.04).  \nIt also cleared up an odd behavior I'd noticed, where the dropbox systray icon continually indicated file activity:  The arrow circles cycling continually, though nothing was changing in my dropbox, and the \"recently changed files\" list remained unchanged.\nA few moments after I changed fs.inotify.max_user_instances=256, the pointless cycling stopped.\n\nA: In one of the forums, someone mentioned it is due to inotify. They have this solution/workaround.\n\n\n*\n\n*disable desktop search (in kde nepomuk+tracker, in gnome tracker)\n\n*reboot (logout didn't help)\n\n\nA: This usually happens because sysctrl has run out of inotify instances.

(Apologize if you know this and I'm bothering you with it.)\ndrwxr-xr-x  14 root  root   4096 Jan 13 19:37 media in this d stands for directory, first group of rwx stands for the rights of the user who owns that object, which is in your case root.  \nsecond group of rwx stands for the rights of the group who owns that object & here you have only r-x which means even if you are in the sudoers file or in the admin group you do not have rights to write in it.   \nThird group of rwx is or other users, who are not owner of that object nor in the group who has ownership rights of that object. if your case it is again r-x only. so that is why you do not have write permissions on it.\n2) So you need to change permissions of the media folder. (I am going to consider that you are in admin group or sudoers file, because this will work only in that case). so this is what you need to do.\n$ sudo chmod -R 775 /media\n\n3) This will give you required write permissions on the all auto mounted drives.\nPlease check and let me know if this does not work will tell you what else can be done to fix this issue.\n\nA: I hit this problem too, in my case it was a fat32 corruption problem allowing to read it but not to write.\nThen if your usb key is a fat32, it might be that your filesyste is corrupted.\nTo verify do a sudo dmesg\n[17183.485565] FAT-fs (sdc1): error, corrupted directory (invalid entries)\n[17205.406905] FAT-fs (sdc1): Volume was not properly unmounted.

How do I make sure that the PPA maintainer hasn't added any malicious code in the version provided there?\n\nA: *\n\n*Install the devscripts package.\n\n*Go to the PPA page and find the source package files associated with the package that you're interested in. Find the one that ends .dsc.\n\n*Run the command dget url_of_dsc_file.  This will download and unpack the source code used to build the package into a directory. Rename this directory to ppa.\n\n*Get the original source code to compare the PPA against. This could be the original upstream tarball from the project website that corresponds to the version you're using, or perhaps the most recent official Ubuntu release of the package (you can find a link to the latter .dsc from https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/source_package_name). Download and unpack this, then rename this directory to upstream, using dget to download from a .dsc if needed.\n\n*Now compare the upstream and ppa directories to see if any malicious changes have been introduced in ppa that were not present in upstream. You could use meld for this, which is a graphical diff viewer. apt-get install meld, then run meld upstream ppa. It will show you which files are new, changed or removed, and you can double-click on a file to see detailed changes in an easy-to-review format.\n\n\nSince PPAs are built from source on Canonical's infrastructure, you can trust that the binary you have installed from the PPA matches the source that you review as above, provided that you trust Canonical. This should be acceptable given that you trust Canonical to build Ubuntu in the first place.\n\nA: You really can't be sure there is no malware in the package provided by the PPA, but you can at least check that the source code hasn't been tampered with:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the PPA page, download the package's orig.tar.* file and unpack it\n\n*then download and unpack the same version of the program from the project's website\n\n*Run diff -r orig-dir/ ppa-dir/\nThe two source trees should be identical. If they aren't, you can go through the differences in detail and make sure they're not malicious. \nYou also need to check the packaging itself. Debian packages can contain patches to the source tree, and they may add additional code.\nDebian packages (.deb) can be unpacked like so:\nar p mypackage.deb data.tar.gz | tar zx\n\n", "Q: Sync folder with Android via LAN or USB I am trying to keep my music folder synced between my ubuntu desktop and my android phone.\nBoth my devices are usually connected via LAN.\nI don't wanna use internet to sync.\nHow can I do this?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: My favorite software for such tasks is FreFileSync (http://sourceforge.net/projects/freefilesync/), \"a folder comparison and synchronization tool providing highly optimized performance and usability without a needlessly complex user interface.\"\nUbuntu package and installation instructions can found here: http://launchpad.net/freefilesync\nLaunch the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:freefilesync/ffs\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install freefilesync\n\nOR\nYou can also have a look at the answers (e.g. rsync) here: How to automatically archive a directory?\n", "Q: Problem installing ubuntu 12.04..stuck at install screen while trying to install ubuntu 12.04 after putting my wi-fi code in and press continue it doesent do anything the curser turns in to the ball that spins and doesent do anything else...i left it for 2 hours and still nothing :(\n\nA: During installing, do not connect to internet via WIFI or any other source.

If there is already a working preview on Galaxy Nexus, why is this not already an active/public development platform for Ubuntu?\n\nA: The release of Ubuntu for Nexus 7 is an exercise in helping shape up the Ubuntu experience for tablets - the purpose of releasing it to the public is to allow developers, testers and users to get to grips with it and provide feedback.\nThe development of Ubuntu for mobiles (http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone) is one which aims to provide, in future an OS for mobile phones that could either be available as the default operating system on a phone the day you buy it, or as a replacement OS for phones that allows such functionality, like the Galaxy Nexus.\nThe Ubuntu Mobile OS is still heavily in development and isn't ready to be shown or distributed publicly but it's also not a full deployment of 'Ubuntu' (as we know it today) either.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: I get \"Failed to load session \"ubuntu-2d\" when using XRDP Initially, when I try to log in to my ubuntu machine (version 12.10) using RDP, I would get an ubuntu desktop background, with no text, menu bars, or anything to indicate it loaded the desktop.\nI went through the following instructions that claimed to fix that issue:\nEdit the .Xsession file to add the following line:\ngnome-session –session=ubuntu-2d\n\nbut it caused the following error:\n\nFailed to load session \"ubuntu-2d\n\nand it only allows me to log out.\nSo now, my question is:\nHow to I log in to my Ubuntu Desktop using XRDP in a foolproof fashion.  I can successfully SSH in to the command line, so do I need to install another window manager? Do I need to reset some settings?\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 12.10, the Unity 2D desktop interface (\"Ubuntu 2D\") no longer exists. Ordinarily, computers without adequate 3D acceleration use the llvmpipe software renderer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity 2d support dropped in 12.10,  what now?\nSince Unity 2D used to be the easy way to xRDP into an Ubuntu system, its removal requires the use of a different technique. Fortunately, there is a solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to remote desktop into ubuntu 12.10 using xRDP (by Griffon)\n\n\nInstall xRDP\nThat page provides a circuitous way to install xRDP, but really it's as simple as before. Install xrdp  in the Software Center. Or install from the Terminal by running:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf it is not found, make sure the Universe repository component is enabled in your Software Sources. (If this is a headless system, use this command-line way instead.)\nInstall a Desktop Interface Not Requiring (Real or Simulated) 3D Acceleration\nGrifon's instructions recommend GNOME Fallback (providing the \"GNOME Classic\" session type). The gnome-session-fallback  package provides it.\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\n\n(It's best to run sudo apt-get update first if you haven't done so recently.)\nOther alternatives include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xfce (xubuntu-desktop  / sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop)\n\n*LXDE (lubuntu-desktop  / sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop)\n\n*MATE (this is a bit more involved to install, see these instructions)\n\n\nCreate a ~/.xsession File Specifying the Desired Interface for xRDP\nIn the home directory of the user or users who you wish to log in via xRDP, create a file called .xsession. You can do this with any text editor, such as Gedit. Once created, this file won't be visible in file managers except when View > Show Hidden Files (or similar) is enabled. In Nautilus and most other file managers, Ctrl+H does this.\nThe quickest and easiest way to make this file is probably the Terminal--a single command will create it.\nTo use GNOME Fallback (\"GNOME Classic (no effects)\"):\necho gnome-session --session=gnome-fallback > ~/.xsession\n\nOr, to use Xfce (\"Xubuntu Session\"):\necho xfce4-session > ~/.xsession\n\nOr, to use LXDE (\"Lubuntu Desktop\"):\necho lxsession -s Lubuntu -e LXDE > ~/.xsession\n\nConfigure the Keyboard Layout\nIf you want an English keyboard layout, you don't need to do anything for this step.\nOtherwise, to configure xRDP to use a different keyboard layout, see the \"Solving the keyboard Layouts problem in the xRDP session\" section of this post (the rest of that post applies just to earlier versions of Ubuntu; the post was linked to from those instructions for 12.10).\nNow it should work!\nGriffon has pointed out that, unfortunately, in GNOME Fallback, the usual way of logging out does not work (when connected via xRDP). Instead, log out by running the command:\ngnome-session-quit --logout\n\nYou can open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) for this, but you might as well just use the Run dialog (Alt+F2).\nIn other desktop environments, logging out might still work, but if it does not, you can use their approximate equivalents of the gnome-sesison-quit command:\nXfce: xfce4-session-logout --logout\nLXDE: lxsession-logout\nAcknowledgements\nMuch of the information here is from that blog post (though no text is copied).\n", "Q: Why does my optical drive not play commercial dvds?

I have 2.5 gigabytes of ram and want to use it all. How do I do the right way. I plan to  use 500 gigabytes and a Sempron core processor. Do I need the swap? \n\nA: SWAP can best be described as \"virtual memory\" I am not an expert on explaining this, but what it does is create a small partition that your system sees as RAM. It then uses this space BEFORE accessing ram when you are running applications, thus allowing your computer to be faster because applications use less actual RAM.  \nThe recommendations I have seen the most (& that I follow) is create a Swap of approximately half your physical ram (if you have 2GB RAM, create 1GB swap)\nKeep in mind however, if you install Ubuntu 12.10, you don't really have to worry about this since the installer can do it all for you. Unless you want to do it yourself of course!\n\nA: The correct way to think of SWAP memory is to think of it as RAM that exists on your hard drive.\nWhen your actual RAM gets full, memory that you don't need right now gets copied to the swap ram on your hard drive.\nWhen that memory is needed it is swapped (get it? swapped?) into main ram and that ram is copied into the swap ram.\nThis allows the operating system to function as having more available ram than it actually has but incurs quite a severe performance penalty.\nIt is always a good idea to have more ram :)\nWith 2GB of RAM it is preferred to provide 2GB of swap disk ram.\n", "Q: How to create bootable USB without administrator rights?

To scroll a single line in gnome-terminal you have to press Ctrl-Shift-↑ or Ctrl-Shift-↓ in Ubuntu.\nIn other distributions (e.g. Xubuntu) you only have to press Shift-↑ or Shift-↓ for the same behaviour. I would like to change the shortcuts in Ubuntu to work the same, but so far I haven't found an option or config file to change.\nThe reason why I would like to change this are two-fold: First, I find it more convenient (not having shift and ctrl above each other on a Thinkpad). Second, it is more consistent to the shortcuts for scrolling an entire page ( Shift-Pgup and Shift-Pgdown).\nAlso, I remember reading the reason behind using ctrl-shift instead of just shift, but I cannot locate that discussion anymore.\n\nA: According to https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/3.8/adv-keyboard-shortcuts.html.en, there are some shortcuts that cannot be edited in gnome-terminal. These are exactly: Ctrl+Shift+↑ and Ctrl+Shift+↓:\n\n\n\nIn Xubuntu you can use Ctrl+↑ and Ctrl+↓ because Xubuntu uses xfce4-terminal which is different by gnome-terminal.

Apparently some configurations changed (most likely to a default setting) with the machine off for long time. \nI solved it following this link here on Stack Exchange: \n\"initramfs\" error on boot ONLY on Dell XPS 13 (boots fine on other computer)\nSolution is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*Press F12 and go to the BIOS settings.\n\n*System Configurations → SATA Operations\n\n*Change RAID to AHCI\n\n\nA: If you installed Ubuntu Desktop onto a partition/hard drive which is part of a RAID array, or an encrypted disk, or on Windows ME, it will likely fail to boot. Installing Ubuntu Desktop onto one of these sources is not supported.\nIf you have installed Ubuntu Desktop to one of the above sources, and it won't boot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall Ubuntu.\n\n*Install Ubuntu to a hard drive or partition which is not part of a RAID array, not encrypted, and not on Windows ME, and it should boot up just fine.\n\n\nA: I also occurred same problem but I can solve it using following link\nhttp://blog.wittchen.biz.pl/ubuntu-system-boot-problem/\nAttempt #1\nFirst, I tried to change rootdelay as error message said. I opened file /etc/default/grub\nI found there the following line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nand changed it to:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"rootdelay=90 quiet splash\"\nrootdelay became longer, but unfortunately it didn’t fix the problem in my case.\nAttempt #2\nI edited /etc/fstab file. I executed the following command in terminal: sudo gedit /etc/fstab and edited fstab file in gedit. In the beginning my file looked like that:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

Now, my file looks as follows:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

I ran hexdump command without parameter and my ubuntu machine froze... What did I do? What does this command do without parameter?\nAnd what is it useful for?\n\nA: This is from man hexdump:\n\nThe hexdump utility is a filter which displays the specified files, or the standard input, if no files are specified, in a user specified format.\n\nIn short, it transforms text from one format to another. Traditionally, hexdump is mostly used for debugging, especially programs that are using low-level libraries. \nBut now with unicode, I sometimes use it to get different values of characters or to transform lines or files.\nBecause it is a filter, you send text into it. An easy way to do this is with the pipe operator (|).\nIt outputs the text displayed as either ASCII, decimal, hex, or octal. You use format specifiers to determine the output. These are command options you put after the hexdump.\nIf you want to see the results on the command line you need to start off with echo.\nSo it's echo text-to-transform | hexdump options optional-format-specifiers\nAn example from the man page is:\necho hello | hexdump -v -e '/1 \"%02X\\n\"'\n\nwhich outputs the hex value of each letter.\nThis example may not seem useful but remember it's possible to recode entire files or dump contents of memory in a human readable form.\nIf you don't send input to hexdump, it keeps waiting and appears to do nothing. This is what would happen if you ran hexdump by itself. When you say it froze, did more than that happen?\n\nA: It prints data in human readable format, typically hexadecimal.  Like most unix commands, without any arguments it reads the data on stdin and writes to stdout, so if you didn't redirect stdin, then it is simply waiting for you to type some data into the terminal.  The computer is not frozen, only the command is waiting for input.  You can interrupt the command with Ctrl-C, or Ctrl-D indicates the end of input.\n", "Q: Why it can't connect to local mysql server due ERROR 2002?

It runs incredibly slow. For example a \"$wget\" or \"$svn co\" will take several orders of magnitude from the compute node than from the storage node or a \"$make\" due to creating the files/installing will run slow. Presumably this is due to the IO writing from the compute to the storage node. I've run several tests to convince myself that it is indeed the IO.\nBoth nodes are connected through a gigabit switch and it's a straightforward install.\nI'm at a loss on how to troubleshoot this because I'm very new to NFS setup etc.\nAny advice on how to even start trouble-shooting this will be greatly appreciated.\nThanks!\n\nA: Anything with a bunch of small files will be slow via NFS vs. a local filesystem. \nFirst off you could start looking at tuning your NFS options.

You'll want to experiment with your NFS settings and measure performance to squeeze the most you can out of it.\n\nA: Step 1 is to make sure you're using NFSv4; that sends small writes/syncs in batches, making it much more efficient for operations that involve lots of small files.\n", "Q: How to printk() a s32 kernel data type When working with a wireless driver module, noise in the wireless medium is reported to the module as a s32 data type, which is defined in linux/types.h. \nI would like to use printk() to print out this value to the syslog, however when I do I get unintelligible results.

I would like to defragment Ubuntu; however, I cannot find software that I can download.  What is available?\n\nA: There is no good way to defragment Ubuntu, because it doesn't have a fragmenting filesystem like NTFS on Windows; i.e., there is no need to defragment. Take a look at Why is defragmentation unnecessary?\n\nA: The current default filesystem for Ubuntu is EXT4. This does not normally need de-fragmentation (by design).\nkernel.org > Ext4 Howto\n\nExt4 was released as a functionally complete and stable filesystem in Linux 2.6.28, and it's getting included in all the modern distros (in some cases as the default fs), so if you are using a modern distro, it's possible that you already have Ext4 support and you don't need to modify your system to run Ext4.\n\nAnd their reference to defragmentation:\n\nOnline defragmentation\n(This feature is being developed and will be included in future releases). While delayed allocation, extents and multiblock allocation help to reduce the fragmentation, with usage filesystems can still fragment. For example: You write three files in a directory and continually on the disk. Some day you need to update the file of the middle, but the updated file has grown a bit, so there's not enough room for it. You have no option but fragment the excess of data to another place of the disk, which will cause a seek, or allocate the updated file continually in another place, far from the other two files, resulting in seeks if an application needs to read all the files on a directory (say, a file manager doing thumbnails on a directory full of images). Besides, the filesystem can only care about certain types of fragmentation, it can't know, for example, that it must keep all the boot-related files contiguous, because it doesn't know which files are boot-related. To solve this issue, Ext4 will support online defragmentation, and there's a e4defrag tool which can defragment individual files or the whole filesystem.\n\n\nStill want to defrag ..\nCheck out: polishlinux.org > Ext4 defragmentation with e4defrag\n\nTo begin playing with e4defrag we must start compile of new kernel with patches needed to carry out the defragmentation. Below you will find a short description of that process, and if you would not like to use all those experimental patches for Ext4, then you should be interested in these seven only: ..\n\n", "Q: Choppy bluetooth sound I am running Ubuntu 12.10 on a Mac Mini and have extremely choppy sound when streaming and connected to a bluetooth speaker.

My second attempt was successful, but I have some concerns Is there something I should check, or a procedure I should perform, to make sure that nothing is wrong with my hard-drive or partitions? \nAnd I noticed that I wasn't asked to define a partition size the second attempt at installation. I assumed that the Ubuntu installation picked up from where it left off (shortly after defining the partition size) - is this correct?\n\n\nA: If your system boots, the operating systems residing in each partition will likely automatically check the hard disk for corruption. The partition table is clean, and if you really want to check everything out, you can run fsck to check for filesystem troubles. \nAssuming you only wanted 4 GB for Ubuntu, it all looks alright.

I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 and the fan has been running a little hot for a good bit. Even when I switch to Windows 7, it's running hot. It didn't do this before I installed Ubuntu. I have an HP DV6 running I7, 8 GB RAM, and a 750GB hard drive. I used the SpeedFan software to see what my temperature was. Plus, the fan is pretty loud and I can feel the heat from the sides. I guess I want to ask two main questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Ubuntu cause the computer to run \"hotter\"?\n\n*If you have Ubuntu installed alongside Windows 7, are they both technically running at the same time, causing it to overheat?\nThank you in advance for any help\n\nA: Regarding heat/power, Ubuntu tends to be running more services in the background and some hardware drivers are less efficient, so it tends to use more power and run hotter than Windows. So, you can expect worse battery life and more heat produced in general, regardless of whether you are dual-booting or not.  A lot of these have been reported as bugs that should get fixed eventually, example: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/760131\nAs far as windows goes, assuming a standard installation, your computer can only have one OS in control at a time, so it is either Windows running OR Ubuntu running.  While Windows is running/in control, Ubuntu is just a bunch of inactive files that can't have any effect on your computer's operation or heat because they're not running.  \nIf you've just rebooted, Ubuntu may have left the computer hardware hot and Windows would not magically cool things off - it would potentially cool off over time, or Windows may use enough power/produce enough heat that it would stay hot.\n\nA: They don't run on the same time, since you don't have a virtual machine in one of them, running the other one. Most people install them side by side and run either this or that. \nSince both systems aren't identical and can perform different tasks, they can differ in running hot. This can be due to one using more CPU, or due to different settings in power saving, fan usage and so on. \nI don't know about a general misbalance in one direction or the other - you should mention your board, chispset, CPU and memory, maybe laptop model if it is a laptop to compare with others. \nOh, I forgot to ask: How do you measure the temperature? \n", "Q: I can see a background, nothing more?

To get my desktop back, I did a 'apt-get install ubuntu-desktop'.\nI still get the same message re: no device found, AHCI BIOS not installed, but the message quickly goes by and the system continues to boot.\n", "Q: How can I get rid of 1mb of unallocated space at the end of this table? (Gparted - see screenshot) I can't seem to find a way to extend or move this 1mb, but it's really bugging me.  \n\n\nA: My understanding is that with GUID partitioning, as your disk probably uses, the final 1MB is a copy of the partition table.  From wikipedia: \"GPT also provides redundancy, writing the GPT header and partition table both at the beginning and at the end of the disk.\"  If this is the case, you can't reuse it.\nBut why worry about 1MB in 112GB?\n\nA: To reduce the clutter of a dual/multiboot disk. The partitions, especially with Windows utilizing multiple recovery partitions now too, become a clutter and sometimes separate key areas of the disk. Being able to remove 1MB separating other partitions is about just that.. partition clutter.. not space. It is not even the size of an old floppy disc, so this is pretty clear. \n", "Q: Will I need a PPA for my Dell XPS 13 \"Sputnik\" laptop? Imported from Google Plus:\nDoes anyone know anything about the status of the Sputnik project PPA for the Dell XPS 13?  Are there any plans to keep it up-to-date or at least ahead of the versions coming out of the standard repos?  Also, will it be updated to keep up with Raring?  It looks like it may be falling behind - it would be sad if it became unusable.\n\nA: I got this information from Kamal Mostafa, one of the maintainers of the Sputnik PPA:\n\nThe two big pieces of functionality that were supplied by the Sputnik\n  PPA were the Cypress Trackpad driver and the i915 backlight control\n  fixes.\nThe Cypress Trackpad driver is now shipping in stock {P, Q, and just\n  this week, R} kernels and is queued up to land in mainline for Linux\n  3.9.  So the trackpad is now a non-issue -- no PPA is required for that.\nIndeed the only thing left in the PPA kernel that isn't shipping in\n  stock Ubuntu is the backlight control (i915 driver) fix....  That fix\n  is still a problem:  In its current state, it can't go into standard\n  kernels because it breaks some other backlights.  I'm hoping further\n  progress will be made on that in the mainline 3.9 timeframe.  In the\n  meantime though, the PPA is and will continue to be necessary to\n  supply working backlight controls.\nI do have every intention of maintaining the Sputnik PPA as long as\n  its necessary, for all versions >= Precise.  I haven't uploaded a\n  Raring kernel to it yet, but will do so by early next week.\nThe other kernels in the PPA (P and Q) aren't really falling behind --\n  I always keep them just behind the stock 'proposed' kernels (hence the\n  PPA indicates \"Newer version available\" on the days where proposed has\n  just been released but I haven't uploaded new versions yet, like\n  today!) I'll be updating those within 24 hours.\nHope that clarifies the mud!  Let me know if you need any more info at\n  all!\n\n\nA: ...from PPA:\n\nALL FIXES HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO Ubuntu Raring (13.04), so this PPA is not needed for Raring.\n\n", "Q: How to setup Adhoc between Kubuntu 12.10 to Ubuntu 12.04 So I'm in a temporary situation. If I get the answer later, I still would like to know the answer. I have 2 laptops, laptop 1 is and old pentium m running Ubuntu 12.04 (The last supported OS for it.) Laptop 2 is a much newer laptop running Kubuntu 12.10. I have a single ethernet connection where I am but no wireless router coming for another few weeks. I had no problem setting up an Adhoc network from Laptop 1 to laptop 2 by simply clicking on the network icon > Create New Wireless Network... > entering an SSID and Key, Select Create and then pulling up Laptop 2, selecting the network icon, seeing the available connection and connecting. Really simple, worked great. However, When I tried to reverse the setup and make Laptop 2 the host connected to the internet, I discovered there is no \"Create New Wireless Network...\" option. When I goto Manage connections and setup a new connection as Adhoc. If I leave the IPV4 settings alone I can get Laptop 1 to connect to it, but no internet. If I change the IPV4 settings to \"Share\" on Laptop 2, laptop 1 just tries to connect for 5 minutes and never successfully does. The heck am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Not quite sure if this applies but I have Ubuntu 12.10 and to set up a \"Adhoc\" for my older laptop I simply open System Settings, Go To Network, Click Wireless, and hit Use as Hotspot.\nLook here for a more in depth tutorial:\nHow to Turn Your Ubuntu Laptop into a Wireless Access Point.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 won't boot after Nvidia drivers upgrade I have installed newest Nvidia drivers (from their site with the .run file) on my laptop with Nvidia Geroce 420M. \nAfter some time I decided to try out open source drivers there I went to System Settings -> Software Sources -> Additional drivers and clicked Open source drivers and applied the changes. \nAfter a reboot I have had no Unity panel shown when I logged into the system. So I googled a little and then removed all nvidia-* packages (except nvidia-common) and installed nvidia-current-updates, rebooted and ... boom system won't load. \nSo I booted now from the livecd and got some logs from it \ndmesg.log http://paste.ubuntu.com/1571454/\nboot.log http://paste.ubuntu.com/1571456/\nsyslog http://paste.ubuntu.com/1571474/\nXorg.failsafe.log http://paste.ubuntu.com/1571479/\nIn boot.log there is a line:\ninitctl: Event failed\nAnd in Xorg.failsafe.log : \n(EE) Failed to load module \"nv\" (module does not exist, 0)\n(EE) Failed to load module \"modesetting\" (module does not exist, 0)\n...\n(EE) open /dev/fb0: No such file or directory\n(EE) Screen 0 deleted because of no matching config section.\n(EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to initialize the NVIDIA kernel module.

Yeah sure, they will work for some people and even be the most recent ones but:\n\n\n*\n\n*When a kernel upgrade appears, they might (will) fail\n\n*They create more problems when trying to upgrade from an older version or even downgrade.\n\n*They are not automatically handled like the ones found in the X-Swat or Xorg-Edgers PPA.\n\n\nSo to save the trouble or several things associated with the Nvidia drivers coming from their site, do not use them. Instead go with the PPAs. Either the X-Swat or Xorg-Edgers.\nFor this case I see the following:\n(EE) Failed to load module \"nv\" (module does not exist, 0)\n\nThis also happen to me one time when I used the Nvidia drivers from their site, it basically did not get loaded correctly.\nRemove it by adding the --uninstall parameter to the .run file you executed to install the said driver. Then proceed to reboot. This will leave you with a system that is depending on the nv or nouveau drivers for the moment. Note that you need to press CTRL+ALT+F1 to go to a terminal after the error you mention in your question appears. Then type your login and password and then kill the GUI environment by issuing the following command:\nsudo service lightdm stop\nRemove the driver as I mentioned above first. Now make sure you have upgraded your system:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nThen proceed to install the Xorg-Edgers PPA which is the one I recommend for 12.10:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa -y\nFollowed by another Update and Upgrade so it reads the new Nvidia drivers:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nNow depending on your video card you would want one of the 3 types of Nvidia drivers in there. More info can be found in How do I install the Nvidia drivers?\nThe one I would recommend is the Nvidia 313 drivers. Install them like this:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-313 and reboot.\nIf by chance the Unity panel does not appear or you just get graphical glitches everywhere, then simply downgrade from the 313 to the 310. Do it again if the problem persists from 310 to 304. The versions available in 12.10 (And related to newer, middle or older versions) are listed here:\n313 Series - Newest drivers for newest cards. Package: nvidia-313\n310 Series - Newer drivers for newest cards. Package: nvidia-310\n304 Series - Newest drivers for old/new cards. Package: nvidia-304\n173 Series - Older drivers for old cards. Package: nvidia-173\n96 Series - Oldest drivers for very old cards. Package: nvidia-96\nSo just do a sudo apt-get install PACKAGE where PACKAGE is one of the ones in the list. Again, for your case it would be the latest 313 drivers.\nApart from this I recommend opening Dash, typing Software Sources and on the Ubuntu Software Tab and Updates Tab, activate all 4 options in each one, including the options \"Unsupported Updates\" and \"Pre-Released Updates\". You will need to update and upgrade the system like I mentioned above. But this should solve any video problems you might have.\n\nA: I've struggled with the same problem and I discovered that apparently fsck either hangs or takes nearly forever to complete -- but you can skip it by typing C - the system will then either boot to the user-selection screen, or right into the default user. \nThe problem might be that Unity won't load and you will only see a nice orange desktop background. However, you can open a terminal window (Ctrl-Alt-T) which you can use to start other programs, and you can end the user session (Ctrl-Alt-Del).\nI received this helpful advice that worked for me. It may work for you, too! (It worked for me at the time; I've now just reinstalled and I'm facing the exact same problem again, but the exact same solution doesn't help anymore. Perhaps it still works on your system!)\nYou could also simply remove the nvidia drivers by entering this in a terminal window and then rebooting:\n\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-current\n\nThis will help you insofar that you will see a working Unity desktop, but not at your desired resolution. It's better than nothing, and it's a way for you to at least get a workable machine.\nI also found this answer about Jockey. You can search for jockey in the Ubuntu Software Center, where it will appear as Additional Drivers. But please note that there's at least one user review that says it can't be used on Ubuntu 12.10! I just tried it on my new 12.10 installation; drivers were not installed, so apparently it really does not work :-/\n\nA: I found this solution, remains to be able to download jockey (upload fails) which after more careful reading is fortunately NOT needed :\nhttp://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/ubuntu-quetzal-nvidia.html\n", "Q: Why am I getting a login prompt after installation of ubuntu 12.04.1?

I am wondering is there a possibility that every time I logged in to my Ubuntu, the desktop is set to Gnome Classic (no effect)? It is too redundant to set and choose it in the login every time.\n\nA: The login screen always uses a user's last successfully logged-in session type as the default. If you don't change it, it logs in to the same interface you used before.\nIf that is not happening, that should be reported as a bug (see also this question). The affected package is lightdm (as LightDM provides the login screen in Ubuntu 12.04).\nIf the problem is that GNOME Classic is not installed, install the gnome-session-fallback  package. In particular, if the problem is that you are selecting Ubuntu 2D as the session type and you get something that looks like Unity, that's normal--Unity and Unity 2D (provided by the Ubuntu and Ubuntu 2D session types, respectively) look very similar and both have launchers instead of a bottom panel containing a window list.\nWhether or not this is due to a bug, it is also possible to set the default session type manually, as explained here. (However, if you're experiencing a bug, that also might or might not work. It would be valuable information for the bug report though, for you to indicate whether or not it does, so I recommend trying the techniques there.)\nIf you are trying to run gnome-panel in Unity or Unity 2D (as you asked about here), that will not be run automatically unless you configure your session to do so. gnome-panel is like any other program; to make it start automatically, use an appropriate method here. Or follow the specific instructions for adding gnome-panel to your startup applications, that Seth has added to his answer.\n", "Q: Unity Dash ignores privacy settings Relatively new full-time Ubuntu user, but experienced computer user. I'm asking a question that's been asked before, but my specific case seems to be unique.\nI installed the latest Ubuntu to my laptop in dual-boot mode with Win7. Overall I really like Ubuntu and I'm using it more often than Windows. However, I can't get the privacy settings in Unity Dashboard to work properly. I've excluded photos and videos AND blacklisted specific directories from the history, but it never seems to take.\nIt'll seem to work on first boot. No embarrassing photo or video files will show up in the default Dash search pane. But the moment I actually view something in the photo viewer -- and here's where it gets weird -- old photos and files I viewed two weeks ago will pop up again in Dashboard. NOT the ones I just viewed, but the same dozen or so from a previous session long ago. And, occasionally, the specific directories I blacklisted will also pop up.\nMost of these files, and the blacklisted directories, are actually on the Windows side of the partition. Is that a possible source of the problem? I'm dubious, because I'm seeing similar issues from people without Windows installed at all.\nThis is a potentially very serious problem for me. The files I look at on my own time are nobody's business but my own, but how can I use the Dash in front of a client or a friend if I have no idea what random files it's going to decide to display today?\n\nA: Blacklisting specific file formats, folders and other things in the Privacy settings only prevent it from being logged again in the future. It doesn't have any effect to the things that are already logged. \nIf your concern is, blacklisted photos show up in the dash, you should consider deleting the already logged history. That should ensure there are no more photos being logged as well as prevent any photos from being shown that were mistakenly logged beforehand.\nYou can use this link for reference on how to delete the logged activities.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I delete the entire history (Recently Used Items) in the dash?\n", "Q: No sound in Manually Compiled Wine 1.7.18 I downloaded the Wine 1.7.18 source code from Sourceforge, installed the dependencies according to the ./configure file and compiled & installed (sudo make && sudo make install).\nThe installation was finished successfully.

(Note: To save the script, either copy paste it into a notepad, or just right-click on the link and click \"Save link as\".)\nThen, in terminal run sudo sh ./install-wine-deps.sh.\n\nA: You need to get the dependencies. The easiest way is to simply run:\nsudo apt-get build-dep wine\n\nThis will install the dependencies required for the repository version of Wine. There may be a time in the future where this is no longer enough but currently speaking, this is enough to build Wine.\nAs a side-note, watch the output of ./configure. It will tell you what it thinks is missing and that will give you an opportunity to find the missing library before you build (you'll need to ./configure again after adding the library).\n\nI saw you mentioned download size in another comment. The build dependencies for Wine will likely far outstrip a single Wine download (hundreds of megabytes) but you'll only have to download them once.

Login and non-login shell defined as:\nsu - $USER # will give you a login shell\nbash # will give you a non-login shell\n\n/etc/profile is not invoked for non-login shells, such as when you start konsole (kde). /etc/profile is only invoked for login shells.\nWhy is that? Please explain, because I like to understand the rationale of this.\n\nA: /etc/profile is invoked only for login shells because that is its specific purpose.\nIf you want a command to run for interactive shells that are not login shells, and you're using bash, put it in ~/.bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc.\nThe purpose of the \"profile\" files is to contain commands that ought to be run for login shells only. These files are:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/profile, run by all Bourne-compatible shells (including bash and dash) when started as a login shell.\n\n*Scripts in /etc/profile.d.\nThis is for Bourne-style shells, but it's not coded into the shell executable itself. Rather, commands in /etc/profile calls them. For example, on my Ubuntu 12.04 system, /etc/profile includes these lines:\nif [ -d /etc/profile.d ]; then\n  for i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh; do\n    if [ -r $i ]; then\n      . $i\n    fi\n  done\n  unset i\nfi\n\n\n*.profile in the user's home directory, run by Bourne-compatible shells when started as a login shell (unless overridden, see below).\n\n*.bash_profile or .bash_login in the user's home directory. These are ignored by shells other than bash. But if .bash_profile exists, bash runs it instead of .profile. If .bash_profile doesn't exist but .bash_login exists, that is run instead of .profile.\n(But it is common for .bash_profile or .bash_login, when it exists, to be written so as to *explicitly call .profile.)\nThe benefit of shell-specific profile files is that they can contain commands or syntax that are only valid for that shell. For example, I can use the [[ evaluation operator in .bash_profile/.bash_login but if I use it in .profile and then log in with dash as my shell, it will fail.\nWhat Should Go In \"profile\" Files\n\"profile\" files should contain commands that ought only run once, at the beginning of login. (This includes graphical logins, as they start with a login shell, too.) If a shell is interactive, the user running it is probably logged on, and so it probably has an ancestor (that started it, or started what started it, or started that, etc.) that was a login shell.\nYou might want to run a command only once because:\n\n\n*\n\n*there is no reason to run it more than one time per login, it would be inefficient, or\n\n*it would produce an undesired result, to run it more than once per login.\n\n\nAs an example of the second situation, where an undesirable result would occur, consider these lines, which appear by default in every user's ~/.profile:\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nSuppose you SSH'd in, ran another shell (say, zsh), at some point found you wanted to temporarily go back to bash but keep your environment (so ran bash again while in zsh), and then ran a program like mc that runs a shell as part of its interface. If bin exists in your home folder and your username is james, your PATH in the innermost shell is something like:\n/home/james/bin:/home/james/bin:/home/james/bin:/home/james/bin:/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\n\nThat's inefficient and (much more importantly) makes it hard to understand the contents of PATH.\nThis is by no means a disaster, though. As far as I can tell, if every interactive shell sourced \"profile\" files, nothing terrible would happen, in the default configuration. However, since the purpose of \"profile\" files is to contain commands to just run once per login, a user or administrator may add commands to a profile that must only run when starting a login shell.\nWhere to Put Commands for Every Interactive Shell to Run\nIf you are using bash, there are files for commands that are to be run in every interactive shell:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/bash.bashrc\n\n*.bashrc in the user's home directory.\n\n\nThis is most commonly used for commands that\n\n\n*\n\n*affect only the environment of the shell in which they run--not even child shells, or\n\n*ought to run even when this is not the login shell.\n\n\nFor example, command-line tab-completion should generally be enabled whether or not bash was the login shell. So this appears in ~/.bashrc:\nif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ] && ! shopt -oq posix; then\n    . /etc/bash_completion\nfi\n\nThere, 1 and 2 both apply: this does not carry over to other shells run inside this one, and tab-completion should work in bash even if I logged in with a different shell.\nWhere to Put Commands for Login Shells and Interactive non-Login Shells\nIf you're using bash and want a command to run in login shells and interactive shells and that are not login shells, it is generally sufficient to put it in /etc/bash.bashrc or ~/.bashrc. This is because, by default, /etc/profile and ~/.profile run them explicitly. For example, ~/.profile has:\n# if running bash\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n    # include .bashrc if it exists\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n        . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n    fi\nfi\n\n(Similarly, /etc/profile sources /etc/bash.bashrc for bash.)\nThus both \"profile\" and \"rc\" files run when you start an interactive bash shell (whether or not it's a login shell).\nWhere to Put Commands to Run in non-Interactive Shells\nYou probably do not want to specify any commands for all non-interactive shells to run; they would run every time a script is run (provided the script is run by the shell you configure to run them).\nThis can cause substantial breakage. If you're going to do this, and there is not an administrator account on the system besides the one you're using, you might want to create one; that can make it easier to fix mistakes.\nIn bash, the \"rc\" files are actually run whether the shell is interactive or not. However, at the top they say:\n# If not running interactively, don't do anything\n[ -z \"$PS1\" ] && return\n\nSo, if you need commands to run automatically even in non-interactive shells like the ones that run to execute scripts, you can add your commands before those lines.\nStarting a Login Shell\nLogging in starts a login shell. If you want a shell started after that to behave as a login shell, start it with the -l flag (stands for login). For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*sh -l\n\n*bash -l\n\n*pdksh -l\nThat's the best way to start a login shell (without logging in) unless you want to start one as another user. Then, use:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo -i for root (use sudo -s for a non-login, interactive root shell)\n\n*sudo -u username -i for any user\n\n*su - username for non-root users (use su username for a non-login, interactive root shell)\n\n\nWhat's an initial login shell?\nAn initial login shell is the same as a login shell. Everywhere this answer says \"login shell\" it could say \"inital login shell\" (except in this section, which would already have stoped making sense).\nOne reason for the term inital login shell is that login shell is also used in a different sense--to identify which program is used as the shell that is executed by logging on. This is the sense of login shell used to say:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"OpenBSD's default login shell is ksh; in Ubuntu, it's bash.\"\n\n*\"You can change your login shell with chsh.\"\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Configuration files for shells\" in \"Unix shell\" (Wikipedia)\n\n*bash manpage\n\n*Full bash manual (GNU)\n", "Q: Did EFI Partition ruin my hard drive? I can't access my HDD (Drive D).\nAfter having trouble installing Ubuntu on my new EFI system, I couldn't boot either of the OS on my SSD (Drive C). I fixed that problem by running boot-repair, allowing me to boot Windows 8 again. But that created a new problem... I can no longer access my D drive (HDD)... in Windows it says \"D is not accessible: The parameter is incorrect.\"\nI tried to format it, but the capacity just says 97 GB when it's really a 2TB HDD.\nSo I looked it up two ways: in the partition manager on my live USB, and in a program called \"GetDataBack for NFTS.\" They both say that my HDD is an EFI system partition. Is this why I can't access it? Was this done by my boot-repair???\nSCREEN CAPTURE: I'm not allowed to post pictures yet so here is the URL to a screen-capture:\nhttp://www.spacewineries.com/problem33.gif\nI'm concerned mainly with the highlighted partition... the 1st HD with two partitions. (Although I think I screwed up the boot-loader on the 2nd HD which now has 9 partitions.\nSO: Can someone tell me if I'm right? I feel like this highlighted partition should NOT be an EFI system partition and that I should somehow convert it back to...  whatever it was (LoL). I guess I'll do ext3 or NFTS but I don't remember its original file system. Is this dangerous? Will I screw everything up? What should I do??\nThanks.\n\nA: From your description, I guess things are pretty messed up already. If you want to give a try to recover any lost partition then give a try to testdisk utility which is free to download for linux as well as windows. EFI or any other partitioning structure can only be modified on a raw disk without any logical partitioning. If things were working for you previously then EFI is not what is bugging you.\n\nA: I recommend against using TestDisk; that tool is good for recovering deleted partitions, but there's no evidence that any of your partitions have been deleted. I believe you're on the right track that the partition you've highlighted is incorrectly flagged as an EFI System Partition (ESP); however, you should not format (create a new filesystem) on it, since that would destroy any data it contains. Instead, you should set an appropriate filesystem type code on it. You can do this with Linux tools like GParted, parted, and gdisk. The details of how you do this, and the type code you should set, vary with the program and the filesystem that the partition contains. If you'd been accessing that partition from Windows, then it's almost certainly an NTFS volume. You can set it correctly like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Ubuntu, type sudo apt-get install gdisk to install gdisk.\n\n*Type sudo gdisk /dev/sda (but the disk might conceivably be /dev/sdb in Linux, in which case you'd need to change that detail).\n\n*At the gdisk prompt, type p to view the partition table and verify that you're working on the correct disk -- the ~1.8TiB disk with two partitions. If not, exit by typing q and try another disk device. Partition #2 should show up in gdisk as having a type code of EF00 -- that's gdisk's way of identifying an ESP.\n\n*Type t to change a type code. When prompted, enter 2 for the partition number and 0700 for the partition type code (that's the code for FAT and NTFS partitions).\n\n*Type p to view the partition table again and verify that it's OK.\n\n*Type w to write your changes back out. You'll be asked to confirm this operation.\n\n\nWhen you reboot, you should be able to see your disk again in Windows -- at least, assuming that the changed partition type code was the only problem.\nOne more comment: Since Windows is saying that D: is now much smaller than you expected, my suspicion is that it's mis-identifying one or more of your Linux partitions as unformatted Windows partitions. This is dangerous, since if you were to accept Windows' offer to reformat the partition, you'd trash Linux. You can fix the problem using gdisk in much the way you fixed the misidentified ESP, except that you'd need to figure out which partition(s) hold Linux filesystems and change their type codes from 0700 to 8300.\n", "Q: How to Install network drivers on Dell Iinspiron 5420 with Ubuntu 10.04?

I have here in my launcher bar an icon which states that there are currently 418 available updates. Now I think people will appreciate that A That's a lot of updates and B It is not likely that an average user such as myself would know what most of these things do.\nMy basic fear is that by installing some of these updates, it is going to adversely affect things that are already running fine. I have already seen this happen with installing packages for LaTeX in Ubuntu.\nSo why not just leave well enough alone and ignore the updates?\nAre there a few that would be particularly important that I should be aware of?\n\nA: There are several different kinds of updates in the software world, especially when package managers, with a party other than upstream is involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*Updates because there is a new version: Unless you're using a distro which focuses on stability (see Debian), the default strategy would be keeping the system up-to-date by having the almost-newest version of every package, unless there is no good reason to do so. There is no other point here other than being up-to-date.\n\n*Updates because there are new features. This is sort of a subset of the former, but a bit more meaningful:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will want to upgrade libpoppler once in a while, as this may introduce new features in the PDF support used by many PDF readers and manipulators out there, such as GNOME's evince. For example, annotation support: implementation is still ongoing, but it was definitely unavailable some versions of libpoppler ago. Perhaps this is not evident if you don't use source-based distros, but you can compile evince against different versions of libpoppler, annotation support would, of course, only be available if compiled against a version of libpoppler providing it.\n\n*go-oo (what you used to call OpenOffice.org under GNU/Linux, now libreoffice) has been undergoing a big cleanup with many fixes, and with extensive work regarding Office Open XML support. Even if you don't use that kind of applications a lot, you may want a newer version so that you're able to open these .docx files people now send because Microsoft Office started defaulting to Office Open XML and some people simply use that instead of the more widely supported CDF \"Office 97/2000\" format (both formats are open, the difference is exactly in the level of support from third-party applications)\n\n*Emacs version 23 included Xft support, effectively allowing you to use OpenType fonts under X Windows. This led to a much better font support, with a much broader glyph coverage, not to mention that the text looks much nicer with Xft.\n\n\n*Bugfixes, fixing programming errors that led to undesired/unexpected/unspecified behavior, for example, ghostscript may need to be changed so that it interprets some Postscript construct correctly and that it stops mangling some PDF or Postscript file using that feature; libreoffice may need to be updated to fix some UI bug where the \"Undo\" button did not work in Draw; and so on. Unlike the next kind of updates, these bugfixes don't involve security issues, just something working on a way other than the expected/desirable way.\n\n*Security updates, the ones I think you're completely forgetting about, and perhaps the most important of them all. Some projects mix these with the above (See Mozilla, what actually led to a legal problem with Debian, where the Debian team wanted to focus on fixing the security issues rather than updating the Mozilla stuff all the time). This means, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preventing other people from executing random executables on your machine simply by loading a font (which is even more of a concern nowadays, as it seems that the new CSS cool is to have fonts downloaded from the web... fonts which are handled using the same tools that were designed to process local fonts, not having to worry with this kind of scenario. Expect more issues like this in the near future.)\n\n*It is kind of frequent to have this kind of \"denial of service or program execution\" vulnerability with the media stack: media players are something you use with files you get from many many sources: They're nowadays' floppy disks, if one wants to spread some malicious code, using an exploit in some widely-deployed media library is a good strategy. Ubuntu: libav\n\n*Along with these two specific kinds of libraries, any vulnerability that hits a library is more troubling than one that hits a single program, as it will be exploitable in all the programs using that library. For example, there has been a trend to move to XML configuration files. GNOME's XML library has had vulnerabilities\n\n*Adobe products. This deserves its own category. If you use Adobe's (formerly Macromedia) \"Flash\", you want to update frequently, as Flash is considered to be one of the worst programs security-wise, and it is something some people run on every website which wants to run some Flash applet. Less likely, given the broad range of less-bloated, more smooth and lightweight alternatives, is when you run Adobe's Acrobat Reader.\n\n\n\nEver wondered why Google's Chrome has new versions so frequently? Part of it are security fixes.\nNow, let's go to what you want: \"My basic fear is that by installing some of these updates, it is going adversely affect things that are already running fine.\" Yeah, it happens. Although I'd say that if this happens too frequently, you may consider changing to a distro where updates aren't that sloppy: part of what a team behind a package manager is supposed to do is to make sure things don't break.\nEven then, you may encounter some breakage once in a while, or you may have to sit down an read through some kind of news bulletin issued (hopefully) before the update with any special instructions. But, most of the time, this is not Windows, there is a package manager, the occurence of that kind of breakage is not going to be that common. And if it does happen, it will happen to a wider audience, and there will be enough data to help the devs fixing it.\nBut yes, your concerns are of course valid. You could pick a distro where updates are only done to take care of what you really don't want to ignore: security updates. Debian does this, what some people have trouble understanding in their definition of \"stable\" is that it does stand for \"we don't update just because there is a new version with new features, not even with fixes for some non-critical behavior, we focus on keeping the system the same for the duration of the release\". They just fix attack vectors, so that you can have almost no updates while having a more secure system.\nThis is one of the things you should actually worry when picking a GNU/Linux distro, it's not \"which DE does that distro bring by default\", but what kind of package manager do you have, how does the team behind the package list/tree work and what are the update policies.\n\nA: I would recommend installing updates. It will take little effort on your part. On top of all that, many of these can be important security updates. \n", "Q: Run python script on reboot (boot) I am trying to run a script once the server reboots. So, how can I change it.

With screen -r NAME you can reteach it, if you need to.\nFor an autostart, you can place your script in the file /etc/rc.local for a execution on every boot. But watch out, exit 0 must remain as last line. The commands in this file will be executed with root. If you don't want this, you can add a su USERNAME -c \"COMMAND\"  If you want to acces it later, I prefer screen -dmS NAME COMMAND, so you can reteach it with screen -r COMMAND. In completion: su USERNAME -c \"screen -dmS SESSIONNAME COMMAND\"\n", "Q: Create a separate partition like D:\\ (of windows) in Ubuntu I've decided to make a complete switch to Ubuntu..\nMy thing is, In windows if the OS crashes (which happens very often) all the data in drives D:\\, E:\\ etc., will be safe.\nI format the C:\\get the new OS there again.\nHow do I achieve the same functionality in ubuntu.\nPlease shed some light :)\n\nA: You should separate a couple of things\nLosing data\n\n\n*\n\n*You can lose data if you format your drive, or if it breaks. \n\n*Only seperate drives can protect you from hardware failure, partitions don't.\n\n*You can break the filesystem on a partition, but this not very likely. If you do this, only the partition, not the complete disk is affected\n\n\nBroken OS\nIf your OS is broken, it can be a really good thing to have your data (like /home, or /movies) on seperate paritions, like you are suggesting. Please do so! This way you can fill up your disc with movies while your OS remains save from having no space at all, and much more of that stuff!\nAs I read in the comments on one of the other answers, you are doing this. That is good!\nUbuntu file structure\nWhere windows shows your filesystems with a letter ( Like C: or D:), linux doesn't do this, linux just calls everything a directory.\nSo you'd have /, and a bit further on you mount the partition home on /home. This looks like it's one big thing, but this doens't mean that if your OS gets 'broken', your /home is gone. You just format your main partition (this will NOT affect your /home. This is a bit tricky, but while it looks like some sort of subdir, it is \"mounted\", so it's only having some sort of shortcut in that spot. your data is safe!).\nAfter you have choosen your borked partition for a new os, you can choose the partition you use for your home files as mountpoint for the /home directory in your new os, and presto!\n\nA: When you install Ubuntu you can choose to make your own partition set up.\nSee this link for an example\nhttp://www.linuxbsdos.com/2011/05/04/manual-disk-partitioning-guide-for-ubuntu-11-04/\n\nA: How about using gparted for partitioning the drive? Then when you have partitioned the drive, Ubuntu displays it in the Starter.\n\nA: I think that, for a start, the feature you're asking for is not a feature, just a mere misunderstanding of the Windows installation procedure. I may not be an active Windows user, but I've gone through several installs when I, for some reason, needed Windows around. And both NT and non-NT offer the option to install on an existing drive.\nIn fact, one way to fix issues with windows is to install on an already existing file system, doing no changes. You do not lose any data in the C: partition (not drive, what the OS sees are filesystems on partitions; some disks/drives may be formatted without partitions, that's for sure, but the usual is to have partitions).\nYou will only lose data in C: if you tell windows to format it. So wait, you tell windows to format it, then you complain your data is gone. Perhaps you should not have told it to format the data, to start with.\nAlso, from what I remember, Windows NT separates user data and settings from the rest of the system, by offering a Documents and Settings folder. So, if you really want to start from scratch you can just go there and delete the Windows folder, and keep Documents and Settings.\nOnce again, unless you tell the Windows setup to format the partition, you won't lose any data. One of the best ways to avoid shooting your own feet is not to fire the gun. And, in this case, you are trying to use a gun when a broom would suffice, or maybe there's not even a need for cleaning at all.\nSo this is not functionality you're asking for, you're asking for a way to use the same exaggerated workaround you did use in Windows. I'm afraid this can't be helped a lot. Just like Windows, even if GNU/Linux does partitions, if you tell it to erase everything and start from scratch, that's what it will do.\nYou can have separate partitions for, say /home, that's the best way to achieve some kind of separation. But your comment of \"If u can see.. the link shows 45.4gib allocated for /home, which will be earsed if I reinstall the OS..\" shows that you are not understanding this at all. Ok, maybe the Ubuntu installer is so bad that it does not let you use existing partitions, but I thought it had a somewhat more advanced partitioning tool.\nOnce again, like Windows, there is an option to get rid of everything and start from scratch. You just have to read what is in front of you and not click in the option that will obviously get rid of your data...\n", "Q: Netbook can not shutdown in Ubuntu 12.10 Why my netbook (with Ubuntu 12.10) can not do shutdown after I click shutdown feature on desktop tool bar.

When I boot my PC, there is no automatic choice on what OS to boot up in. So I boot into my BIOS and choose what appears to be the USB HDD (it's a odd name). I get a choice to boot in Ubuntu, Ubuntu Safe Mode, and a few others. When I boot into Ubuntu I get a blank screen for a long time. Then I get some error text messages.

I thus have to add the nomodeset boot option which disables the KMS system and thus screen resolution change with xrandr also. But at least the Intel driver is able to boot when the screen is connected and provides a max resolution of 1280x1024. When it is not, the Intel driver gives up and the VESA driver is started with a max resolution of 1024x768. \nWhen I boot with the display directly connected to the PC (KVM removed) the Intel driver gets all the information it requires and I get many more display mode. \nThe KVM I used, which is cheap, is thus not good enough. A good KVM caches the EDID information provided by the display so that a PC connected to the KVM can obtain it even if the display is not connected to the PC. Such smarter KVM for desktop usage are more expensive of course. \nBTW, I see the same display resolution problem when I boot my Windows 7 computer with the display not connected. When the screen is connected when it boots I get the correct 1280x1024 resolution, and when not connected when it boots, I get a max resolution of  1024x768. Now I understood why. \nI ordered I new KVM switch (Belkin SOHO kvm switch) which is \"smarter\" and is said to cache the DDC/EDID information.

Ubuntu detects only 495 MiB. How can I fix this?\nOn Debian Squeeze, I have 512MB.(The correct size)\nOS: Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin\n\nA: Your RAM is detected correctly. MB (megabyte) and MiB (mebibyte) are two different units. \n\n\n*\n\n*1 MB is 1000 KB which is 1000 byte (decimal)\n\n*1 MiB is 1024 KiB which is 1024 byte (binary)\n\n\nIf you check the math yourself you will see that 512 MB are 495 MiB ;-)\nMB is mostly used for selling stuff because it's the higher number.

When I do\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nSometimes the Ubuntu GUI Update Manager will still have some items left. e.g. “Complete Generic Linuux kernel”.\nI know there's also sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, but that touches other things.\nMy question is, what's another command line option that I can use that'd update the rest of items shown in GUI update manager (but doesn't touch anything else extra). In other words, I am looking for command line equivalent.\nEDIT: This question refers to the update manager which is equivalent to Software Updater in newer versions (e.g. 16.04), as @Eliah Kagan pointed out.\n\nA: As Flimm commented, the answer really is sudo apt-get dist-upgrade (after running sudo apt-get update, which GUI package management tools automatically do the equivalent of). That is at least the closest thing to running the Software Updater (called Update Manager in older releases).\nRunning apt-get upgrade will upgrade packages that can be upgraded:\n\n\n*\n\n*without installing any packages that aren't already installed in some version, and\n\n*without removing any packages.\n\n\nThe Update Manager is capable of doing both these things, so apt-get dist-upgrade is quite close to it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Running sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will not, by itself, upgrade your Ubuntu system to a newer release. In fact, unlike in Debian, apt-get dist-upgrade is not a supported way to upgrade to a new release. In Debian (and in Ubuntu, though it may sometimes fail and is unsupported), changing all the repositories listed in /etc/apt/sources.list to the repositories for the next release and running sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will attempt to upgrade to the next release.\n\n\nBecause apt-get dist-upgrade can remove package (and install new packages you might not want), it's always best to look through the description of what it intends to do before pressing y.\nSo while running sudo apt-get -y upgrade is usually reasonable, the -y flag should rarely be used with dist-upgrade.\nThe reason you don't get new kernel versions with sudo apt-get upgrade is because they each are provided by separate, differently named packages. (The kernel version is part off the name.) This is to facilitate keeping an old kernel installed alongside a newer kernel (and being able to select between them in the GRUB menu).\nThe automatic offering of new kernel packages for installation is accomplished by having a metapackage (like linux-image-generic) installed. When a new kernel comes out for your Ubuntu release, your kernel metapackage is upgraded and the upgraded version fo that metapackage lists the new kernel as a dependency (without preventing the old kernel from continuing to be installed).\nIf you don't want to use sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, then you can always manually upgrade the individual packages that are listed as held back when you ran sudo apt-get upgrade. To do this, \"install\" them: sudo apt-get install packagename.\n\nA: If you're looking to open the software update window from the command line (which is what I gathered you were getting at, mostly because that's why I searched for this and ended up here as that is my goal) in order to give yourself root access to the GUI window (I had a permission issue trying to do this from remoting in)\nsudo update-manager\n\n\nA: I just found this answer but lost the source so I can't credit it...\nThe below command will install the package that has the kernel as a dependency and so will update your kernel choosing the right one to do it with.\nMy 14.4 install had been upgraded to 14.10 except the kernel. In my case, the kernel updated from 3.13.x to 3.16.x although it is possible that the 3.13.0.x versions may have had updates. Apparently 3.13 wasn't an LTS kernel though.\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-generic\n\n\nA: Likely is the wrong place but I believe you want to do:\napt-get -f install\n\nThis will clean up outstanding dependencies \n\nA: apt command line utilities don't provide the exact same level of comfort as their gui equivalent (namely software updater). While a apt-get dist-upgrade will take care of the bulk of the upgrade, that is to say download and installation of newer packages, it will not detect the existence of a new release of ubuntu (or debian), which the ubuntu gui utility will do.\nThe missing part is to edit /etc/apt/sources.list (or related files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ - but you probably don't have these), to tell apt that the new release exists, and where the repositories are.\nFor instance, for a dist-upgrade from utopic to vivid, you could open /etc/apt/sources.list, and do a quick search and replace of utopic to vivid, and then run the dist-upgrade CLI command. A safer path could be to duplicate the lines in that file, and do the search and replace only on these duplicated lines, thus keeping the utopic repositories.\nFor more informations, I suggest to consult the man page on sources.list which describes the file format, and how to edit it.\n", "Q: How to increase the default screen resolution without a monitor plugged in i have kinda problem with setting my resolution on ubuntu 10.04\nthe thing is that i installed the machine and put it away without mouse, keyboard and monitor (i am currently remote with VNC viewer)\nnow the problem is that without a monitor plugged in i can`t increase the screen resolution above 800x600\nhow can i increase it let`s say to 1024x768\n\nA: I found a page that might be just the thing for you.....\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution\nRelevant section:\nAdding undetected resolutions\nDue to buggy hardware or drivers, your monitor's correct resolutions may not always be detected. For example, the EDID data block queried from your monitor may be incorrect.\nIf the mode already exists, but just isn't associated for the particular output, you can add it like this:\nxrandr --addmode S-video 800x600\n\nIf the mode doesn't yet exist, you'll need to create it first by specifying a modeline:\nxrandr --newmode <Mode``Line>\n\nYou may create a modeline using the gtf or cvt utility. For example, if you want to add a mode with resolution 800x600 at 60 Hz, you can enter the following command: (The output is shown following.)\ncvt 800 600 60\n# 800x600 59.86 Hz (CVT 0.48M3) hsync: 37.35 kHz; pclk: 38.25 MHz\nModeline \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\n\nThen copy the information after the word \"Modeline\" into the xrandr command:\nxrandr --newmode \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\n\nAfter the mode is entered, it needs to be added to the output using the --addmode command as explained above.\n", "Q: What does the percent of an update process represent First look at the image:\n\nYou can see from the image that the apt process is downloading the repository updates, the one at the moment is one that is 5.406 KB of size, to which the download as only gotten 1.831 KB which is 34% of that package. At the far left, in the same line we can see the suppose \"total\" download percent, which shows 82%.\nI would think that this is 82% if the total packages needed to download, but then I would be mistaken. After downloading the package mentioned above, this 82% instead of going up, might go down like 73%. Even if it get to 99% does not mean it is 1% from finishing. This 99% could go down when downloading the following package.\nSo since this left most percent does not actually stand for the total package percent, what does it stand for since it confuses me when waiting for a download or checking the downloads and seeing it get to 95%, then back to 60%, then up to 80%, then down to 76% and so on.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Where is the actual TOTAL percent which shows how much has been done and how much is left?\n\n*Does adding 3rd party PPA (Xorg Edgers, webup8, xbmc...) influence in the correct check for the total percent?\n\n*Why the abnormal jumps between percents where they go down instead of up (eg From 85% to 81%) \n\nA: Apt-get typically looks at multiple repositories instead of just one. Why check them all just to see what the total is when you check them all just to pull a text file anyway? It would make the process a little less than twice as long.\nSo to answer your points...\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no total percent since apt-get would have to check every repository just to see how much there was. Like Joe said, it would create a lot of overhead.\n\n*Adding a 3rd party repository would affect the total percent, but neither you nor apt-get knows what it is. When apt-get came to that repository the percentage on the left would have it's own iteration through 100%.\n\n*The jumps are actually (usually) really fast iterations through 100% as it goes through each repository, and you only catch a glimpse as it flies through 100% multiple times. When it appears to go down it's actually not quite as far in the next scan through the next repository.\nI am not an expert on this kind of thing so someone correct me if that's not right.\n", "Q: Can I encrypt my disk after installing?

I removed the fakeraid, turned fastboot and secure boot off, and set the SATA to AHCI and deleted all existing partitions on both SSDs.\nPurchased Windows 8 Pro, installed on first disk, everything worked fine, Win 8 created four partitions: ntfs recovery, fat32 efi, some odd Microsoft reserved partition, and a main ntfs for the OS.\nBooted to Ubuntu 12.10 live USB, it didn't detect Windows 8. I choose to install with manual partitions - the installer selected /dev/sda2 (which is the fat32 efi partition Windows 8 had created) to use as efi. Created partitions on the second disk for / (/dev/sdb1) swap (/dev/sdb5 and /home (dev/sdb6). I choose /dev/sda2 as the location to install the bootloader, as in UEFI Windows 8 and Ubuntu should be able to share the EFI partition.\nOn reboot, ubuntu loads up automatically. So I ran backup-repair, which gave me this. Gave me Grub on reboot, the two Windows 8 entries gave errors basically saying that the device couldn't be found, and then the /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/xxx.efi couldn't be found. I tried again and got this paste.ubuntu.com/1572985/ and then this paste.ubuntu.com/1572995/.\nThrough the BIOS I can see Windows Boot Manager and two Ubuntu entries. If I select the Windows Boot Manager the screen flickers off and then returns with Grub. I managed to (I think) fix the grub entries following the info here. And now I have a grub entry that will also flicker the screen and then return to Grub. \nI have tried the Windows 8 repair installation, and it just leaves me with the ability to boot into a Windows 8 \"Preparing to repair\" or similar screen.\nI am completely stuck. Any advice please?! Have I installed Windows 8 in legacy BIOS mode somehow? This seems unlikely because my BIOS doesn't even seem to have an option for that (in the boot priority list there are no options for simple booting from a hard drive, and when a bootable USB is in it is listed as a single UEFI:xxxxx option.\nEDIT\nI just tried top answer here.

Whereas PTP was designed for downloading photographs from digital cameras, Media Transfer Protocol supports the transfer of music files on digital audio players and media files on portable media players, as well as personal information on personal digital assistants. MTP is a key part of WMDRM10-PD, a digital rights management (DRM) service for the Windows Media platform.\nMedia Transfer Protocol (commonly referred to as MTP) is part of the \"Windows Media\" framework and thus closely related to Windows Media Player. Versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system from Windows XP SP2 support MTP. Windows XP requires Windows Media Player 10 or higher; later Windows versions have built-in support. Microsoft have also made available an MTP Porting Kit for older versions of Windows back to Windows 98. Apple Macintosh and Linux systems have software packages to support MTP.\nThe USB Implementers Forum device working group standardized MTP as a fully fledged Universal Serial Bus (USB) device class in May 2008. Since then MTP is an official extension to PTP and shares the same class code.\n\n", "Q: Live Ubuntu 12.04 USB Disc not detected in UEFI This was not my first time attempting dual boot, but it is for doing this with Windows 8.

If you change the ODF format used in LibreOffice to 1.0/1.1 you will no longer have this problem.\n\nA: In my experience, MS Word 2010 does, in fact, open .odt files, even though it gives two error messages first. If I send people an .odt document, I just ask them to ignore the error messages.\nOr at least Word 2010 running on Windows 7 does so.

I saw aacgain and wavegain mentioned elsewhere.  normalize-audio is in the package normalize-audio, funnily enough.\nHope this helps you.\n\nA: In OpenShot you can increase the volume of a video by 150%.\n", "Q: certain sounds don't work after I start JACK I have ubuntu 12.10 on an acer aspire one 722 with ALSA & an ATI soundcard.\nSo, i finally figured out how to start JACK; I type in jackd & qjackctl & jack_mixer and then open a new terminal and open the applications i want to use JACK with, i.e. zynaddsubfx & ardour2 & hydrogen...This is the only way it will start JACK.

I have heard that there is some similarity in the code used for both Ubuntu and Android programs, but has there been any mention in all the recent publicity over the forthcoming Ubuntu OS for phones, whether or not existing Android apps will be compatible with Ubuntu?\n\nA: It may be possible with OpenMobile's Application Compatibility Layer. They have already demonstrated it with Tizen OS and from its site, it is clear that it will be available for Ubuntu too.\nSource: OpenMobile ACL for Ubuntu\n\nA: So far, the Ubuntu QML toolkit is just a preview, so there is no definite answer possible. \nBut Richard Collins, head of Ubuntu mobile products, has stated in an engadget interview: \n\nQ: Since Android is also Linux-based, is there any plan for Ubuntu to\n  run Android apps?\nA: Many Android developers already use Ubuntu as their desktop OS and\n  we have a very close affinity with them. We intend to encourage them\n  to make their Android applications run on Ubuntu, but we won't\n  engineer any middleware for running Android apps. Developers are\n  intelligent and capable enough to make their apps run on our devices.\n  We have an active initiative right now to directly help them achieve\n  this.\n\nSo this makes it pretty clear: the apps should be either web apps or ported to Ubuntu.\n\nA: As previously answered, canonical won't support android apps on ubuntu touch. Their official reasoning is that \"native\" apps are faster. A point they don't mention is that oracle draged google on a billionaire lawsuit for using java on android (google \"google oracle java lawsui\"t). It should be pretty simple for ubuntu to support android apps, but it would require the \"dalvik vm\" which might drag canonical in a lawsuit too big to make it all worth it. However, third parties can, and most probably will port dalvik to ubuntu in order to support android apps, I bet someone will do it right after the official ubuntu touch is released. The problem with all this is that it does not solve the problem of legally runnning apps bought for android. I don't think it should be a problem for free apps though. \n\nA: I remember seeing this article a while back.\nYou can run android apps using Google-Chrome with a few tweaks.\nI have not tried it myself.

I hope this means the drives are fine as they were quite a bit to buy and brand new. Disk utility shows a massive grey 'unknown' shown below:\n\nI have since removed my RevoDrive to try and make things simpler/clearer.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the motherboard doesn't have two controllers. Perhaps the Revodrive that I have since removed, which plugs in through pci was confusing things?\n\nHas anyone got any suggestions for how to recover the data from the drive rather than rebuilding the array? I.e. a step-by-step on using testdisk or some other data recovery program....\n\nI have tried putting the drives in another machine. I had the same issue where the machine would not get past the bios screen, but this one would constantly reboot itself. The only way to get the machine to boot would be to unplug the drives. I tried using different sata cables as well with no help. I did once manage to get it to discover the drive but again mdadm --examine revealed no block. Does this suggest my disks themselves are #@@#$#@ even though the short smart tests stated they were 'healthy'?\n\nIt appears the drives are truly beyond rescue. I cant even format the volumes in disk utility. Gparted wont see the drives to put a partition table on. I cant even issue a secure erase command to fully reset the drives. It was definitely a software raid that I had set up after discvering that the hardware raid I had initially tried was actually 'fake' raid and slower than software raid.\nThank you for all your efforts to trying to help me. I guess the 'answer' is there is nothing you can do if you somehow manage to kill both your drives simultaneously.\n\nI retried SMART tests (this time in command line rather than disk utility) and the drives do respond successfully 'without error'. However, I am unable to format the drives (using disk utility) or have them recognized by Gparted in that machine or another. I am also unable to run hdparm secure erase or security-set-password commands on the drives. Perhaps I need to dd /dev/null the entire drives?

Does that mean the drive should be fine or just that the test was able to complete? Should I start a new question as I'm more concerned about getting the use of the drives back rather than the data/raid array at this point...\n\nWell today I was looking through my filesystem to see if there was any data to keep before setting up centOS instead. I noticed a folder called dmraid.sil in my home folder. I am guessing this is from when I had initially set up the raid array with the fake raid controller? I had made sure to remove the device (quite some time ago way before this problem) and just before using mdadm to create 'software raid'. Is there any way I have missed a trick somewhere and this was somehow running 'fake' raid without the device and that is what this dmraid.sil folder is all about? So confused. There are files in there like sda.size sda_0.dat sda_0.offset etc. Any advice on what this folder represents would be helpful.\n\nTurns out the drives were locked! I unlocked them easily enough with hdparm command. This is probably what caused all the Input Output errors. Unfortunately I now have this problem:\n\nI have managed to mount the md device. Is it possible to unplug one drive, format it to a normal drive and copy the data to that? Ive had enough 'fun' with raid and am going to go down an automated backups route with rsync I think. I want to ask before I do anything that may cause data integrity issues.\n\n\nA: The problem was that the drives became 'locked' at some point. \nThis explains:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Input/Output errors I was recieving for all commands.\n\n*The inability to format the drives or see them with gparted.\n\n*The inability to boot with the disks in. (would have been helpful if the terminal didn't output this as SMART status BAD)\n\n*The fact that I would get I/O errors on multiple computers showing it\nwasn't the cables/bus.\n\n\nOnce unlocked with a simple hdparm command sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-unlock p /dev/sdb(c) and a reboot, my mdxxx device became visible in gparted. I was then able to just sudo mount it to a folder and see all my data! I have no idea what caused the drives to 'lock down'. I am also missing the e2label it seems. I have no idea what this is. Perhaps someone can provide a better answer which explains:\n\n\n*\n\n*how the drives may have become locked in the first place (unplugging\nthe drives while system is up/running/live?)\n\n*whether this is not an mdadm array? or if it is why the configuration\nfile didn't seem to show this?\n\n", "Q: gdb cannot run due to python error I am trying to run gdb, but as soon as I hit enter I get this error\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 562, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 544, in main\n    known_paths = addusersitepackages(known_paths)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 271, in addusersitepackages\n    user_site = getusersitepackages()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 246, in getusersitepackages\n    user_base = getuserbase() # this will also set USER_BASE\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 236, in getuserbase\n    USER_BASE = get_config_var('userbase')\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py\", line 577, in get_config_var\n    return get_config_vars().get(name)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py\", line 476, in get_config_vars\n    _init_posix(_CONFIG_VARS)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py\", line 337, in _init_posix\n    makefile = _get_makefile_filename()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py\", line 331, in _get_makefile_filename\n    return os.path.join(get_path('platstdlib').replace(\"/usr/local\",\"/usr\",1), \"config\" + (sys.pydebug and \"_d\" or \"\"), \"Makefile\")\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'pydebug'\n\nam I missing some package?

I have an old rig that I am trying to 1) learn linux and terminal/bash 2) make it into a simple fileserver so that I can mirror my documents  through LAN. More specifically I will be  using it in an office environment so I can not use Dropbox for example since it goes through their servers (my files are very confidential). \nSo I would like dropbox like functionality where a file change on my business machine (windows 8) is mirrored to an ubuntu box. Actually I am okay with periodic backup also rather then as soon as I hit \"ctrl s\" it starts a backup - this actually might not be a good idea considering the harddrives are slow and old and running them a lot is just asking for problems and failure. \nPlease let me know the easiest root with possible instructions. \nEDIT: I think what I am looking for is Samba. After I install samba it will give me a readable/writable folder on my linux machine. I will be able to access this location through explorer in windows. \nMy next question is: does there exist a backup software that I can manually type in the folder location?\nEDIT 2: I believe that syncing to the cloud is also possible as long as the files are being encrypted before they are sent. Any way to incorporate this ? \nThanks\n\nA: Is your business computer at an office somewhere outside of your house, where your Ubuntu machine will be?\n(Sorry, this should be a comment but I don't have comment privileges)\nEdit 1: Since everything connected through LAN, Samba could be a workable option. It's not going to be great though, because it has sync feature. You would have to mount a network folder (Easy), and then manually store documents that you need backed up in that network folder (Labor intensive). \nIf you need to sync many documents that are changing often, then you should look for a more advanced synchronization tool. For a start, try this SuperUser thread. Remember, once you have mounted the shared folder (on ubuntu machine) into your Windows file system, you can treat it as a local directory, so all you need is software that keeps two local directories in sync.\n", "Q: Can't connect to any wireless connection after updating I have a dual boot (windows 7 and ubuntu 12.04) setup and, for (apparently) no reason, I can't connect to any wireless connection on my ubuntu box at all.

The Ubuntu Music Lens displays just a few songs and albums of my music collections. For example the lens displays just 44 albums but it should be 200 albums.\nIf I type the name of the song or album in the search bar then the music lens displays the song, but not in the overview.\nI edited the ID3 Tags of the songs with Banshee, Rhythmbox or EasyTag but it had no effect.\nWhat could I do, that the lens displays all songs and albums?\n\nA: For Ubuntu 12.04, in particular, the performance of the dash was such that it did not handle displaying hundreds or even thousands of results very well. In addition, it was felt that a user would find it cumbersome to parse hundreds of results visually when it was easier to type terms to narrow down the search, so limiting the number of results displayed was a good trade off.\nAs such, there was a limit set on the number of results a scope would return to the dash to be displayed (100 when there is no search, 50 for a search in the music lens and 20 for a search from the home lens).  Presumably, in this case, the first 100 songs it finds are spread between 44 albums. \nThe music lens is written in vala. It should be possible to edit the source and compile  and install a new version with much larger limits.

(Didn't know, my fault)  Anywho, it connected on Kubuntu, and now it doesn't want to.\n\nA: Your IP isn't usually \"selected\" by Ubuntu.  It is usually given to it by the router, or remote system (ISP / datacenter), and in the very rare cases of virtual machines, you have to configure that on the system that's hosting the vm (since that's how the VM gets the IP).\nYou can't change the \"default\" ip, because as i said above, the IP isn't \"selected\" by Ubuntu, its handed to you from a location somewhere upstream in the network from your computer (whether its from the router, or ISP). (therefore, there is no \"Default\" IP address)\nUnless both myself and Dennis (the other answerer) are misunderstanding what you're wanting to do, you're likely going to get this same answer from more than just us.\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't \"grab\" an IP address.

I have only one 16 GB FAT 32 file system formatted USB drive, pen drive, flash-memory drive, or whatever you wish to call it.\nI would like to format it from my LiveUSB distro in memory, and format to EXT4, and finally have the partitions set up (with the swap space one), but I've had issues with this in the past.\nI've gotten error messages, such as:\n\"Can't perform action.

I have lost pretty much all hope, and I'd like some feedback on what the real problem behind this might be.\nThe .ISO is not bad, the hardware is all working fine, etc., etc., etc.\nWhy am I getting so many issues?\n\nA: If I'm interpreting right this is iwhat you want to do:\n(1) use a USB drive (we'll call it USBDRIVEA) with the LiveCD ISO on it to...\n(2) Use USBDRIVEA to install Ubuntu to USBDRIVEA.\nUnfortunately, i don't think you can from there, you'd need another USB drive to hold the image so you can free up USBDRIVEA from being mounted (which is what happens when you're on the live environment).  Typically you'd have to introduce another medium (for example, another USB drive, USBDRIVEB) to either receive the installation, or to have the LiveCD environment that's running so you can install to the other drive.\n\nA: You can use the Universal USB Installer or YUMI Multiboot USB Creator from Pen Drive Linux to boot and run your iso strait from the usb stick. You can still run it from there and use persistance to keep all of your data. WUBI will let you install to a usb stick and run through windows or boot it up.\nOtherwise if you have an optical drive, you can burn your ISO onto that then install to your USB device.

From time to time I boot from ISO files saved in my hard disk. It boots and executes much faster than the live-cd. I would like to save a minimum configuration so that I don't have to configure it each time. I tried \"rsync -av\" the user's home and then compressing it to bz2, but it didn't work well. When I extracted the bz2 it gave me a few errors, even though I copied the extracted files to replace the user's home but somethings were not configures and the most strange thing was that .gvfs directory appeared without \"w\" permission for the owner (that is 500).

Do I have to edit the file and then upload it back to the cloud? Will it then replace the original?\n\nA: Short answer: Yes, no and yes.  \nSlightly longer: Ubuntu One provides only a storage cloud, no editing tools. \nI just realized that you probably didn't add your notebook as a device to UbuntuOne and so no automatical syncing will take place at all. So that would need to be done first.\nThen if you edit the file on your notebook and save it it should get automatically synced back to UbuntuOne and then to your other system.

I set up an alias for 'sudo service lightdm restart; sudo startx'. It worked a few times when something crashed or glitched and I had to ctrl+alt+f2. But now I seem to have screwed something up, because trying to log in from the lightdm login screen on 12.04 shows a familiar screen with some weirdly indented text, and then kicks me back to the login screen without explanation.

I used a command i saw here to make my touch pad in lenovo 330 to scroll with 2 fingers and it worked exactly as i wanted but after each reset to the computer I need to retype the commend. Can you please tell me how i can make this command stay after i close my computer?\n\nA: Depends on the command. If X doesn't need to be running to do it, and it can be run as root, just add it to /etc/rc.local.\n\nA: Commands can't \"stay\" after rebooting the computer. When you shut it down and the power gets cut off, or when you reboot and the memory is cleared, things are gone from the memory.\nYou can, though, either keep the system state, by hibernating and resuming, or, what I expect to be the best solution for you, run the command after each boot.\nAs your command is probably something for X Windows, it must be executed after starting X Windows. Here I do that by adding the command to ~/.xinitrc, but that's for startx, I think Ubuntu by default uses a graphical login screen, so you would need to use some other ~/.xsomething file. Perhaps ~/.xprofile?\n", "Q: upgrade to 12.04, mysqld up but can't log on Sorry if this is the wrong place to post. I upgraded to 12.04 and mysql stopped working. I re-installed mysql server package.

I'm running the Django webserver locally, and I want be able to enter www.my-site.dev or username.my-site.dev and have that map to my Django application.  \nI've seen a lot of solutions for Apache, and have tried to add the following to my /etc/hosts file, assuming the Django server would also check /etc/hosts.\n127.0.0.1:8000 www.my-site.dev  \n127.0.0.1:8000 username.my-site.dev  \n\n\nA: A few things\n1) Django probably isn't referencing your hosts file. ( I say probably, because I don't use Django, but it doesn't make sense for it to reference the hosts file as it shouldn't need to do a lookup on itself).\n2) The hosts is for local name resolution. It has nothing to do with ports. If you want those two sites to resolve to your local machine, you should have this in your hosts file.\n127.0.0.1     www.my-site.dev    username.my-site.dev  \n\nYou can then access the site via your web browser by going to\nwww.my-site.dev:8000\n\nThe only way for you to not have to type in the 8000 is for you to make Django listen on port 80 (or providing you are doing SSL, 443). This should be configurable in Django, and shouldn't cause any issues (unless you are already running something that is using port 80).\n\nA: There are a few problems here that I will outline. Others have already gone some way to explain them but as Django developer, I can add some overlooked issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't misunderstand the relation between servers, browsers and DNS. The browser needs DNS to look up a name and get an IP address to connect to. The server doesn't give a flying banana which names points to its IP.\nNote: The httpd will, but not for connection purposes — it uses it to host multiple virtual hosts on one IP.\n\n*/etc/hosts can point a domain name to an IP but that's it. They can't specify port 8000. That's the browser's job.\n\n*To host something on port 80, you need to run it as root, redirect port 80, or use setcap to allow Python to hog port 80. The last two are very hacky but they're infinitely better than running a Django dev server as root. Please never ever do that.\n\n*Hosting multiple Django dev servers on one IP's port 80 is impossible. They will all try to greedily bind to it and disallow further binds. You either have to stagger ports, or stick a httpd/reverse-proxy in front to split virtual hosts to Django servers.\n\n\nFor development I just load up the dev-server as and when I need it. I only run one at a time and it runs on the default 127.0.0.0:8000. If that model suits you and you just want to host on a custom domain name, just something like this to your /etc/hosts:\n127.0.0.1 my.domain.ext sub.my.domain.ext\n\nYou can just keep chaining them on but remember that this is going to override all outbound traffic for requests on those domains. Aka: don't forget you've hacked your own DNS! From there you just load http://my.domain.ext:8000 and you're looking at your dev server.\nIf you want http://my.domain.ext, you're going to have to either hack things up (see above) or move to a more traditional infrastructure (below).\n\nIf you need to run multiple servers, I can really only suggest running a proper stack. I would run nginx + uwsgi + virtualenv stack. Something like what you'd use in production. In fact, the closer you can mirror your production environment, the better. If you're using Apache and modwsgi, do that.\nThis gives you a better testing platform. If you need to hook in on debug, I find setting uwsgi up to log (and monitoring the log) a suitable replacement for a live console output.\n\nA: I'm no expert, but it sounds like you need a DNS Server. Otherwise, your browser will check the world wide web to try to find a www.my-site.dev, and will not find your local machine unless you set up a DNS server ans set up any clients accessing www.my-site.dev to use the dns server that you set up. Then the DNS Server will point the client to your local machine. Ignore me if I am wrong :)\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu without first booting Windows 8? I want nothing to do with Windows.  The only methods I see for installing Ubuntu on a Windows 8 computer involve booting windows and restarting to change settings.  However, this requires first agreeing to Windows' terms of service.  I really don't want to do that if I can avoid it.\nI have a brand new Samsung Series 3 Notebook.\nI don't want to dual-boot, and I don't want to partition.  I want to preemptively scrub away all traces of Windows before using my computer.  What are my options?\n\nA: I have recently installed Ubuntu 12.04LTS on a Samsung NP355V5C, which is I think a series 3, and did not boot into windows at all.  It is very easy.\nAs pointed out, you need an install CD or a UEFI boot USB.  To do this, you can buy one, ask a friend to create one on his computer, or you could get the windows-8 set up on your PC, just to create the UEFI booting USB.  When you have a USB ready, but not plugged in to the Samsung, switch the laptop on while holding down F2 to get to the BIOS. In here I altered the boot option to disable secure boot, but this is probably not necessary.\nWindows 8 does not bypass the BIOS, but the BIOS is set to run the windows startup programs (you can see the setting in the BIOS).  This disappears when you disable secure boot, but if you do want secure boot you can have it with ubuntu 12.10.\nReboot with the USB inserted, and take the options to install ubuntu as the sole operating system.  This WILL create partitions and scrub off the windows-8, but if you just take the default options it does this automatically without you being aware of it.  You (after restarting when prompted) will then be running the laptop 100% in ubuntu.\nEverything I want works - sound, ethernet, wifi, DVD, etc.  But if your laptop is an AMD processor like mine, in the ubuntu additional drivers you should select \"ATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics driver\" to get resizeable starter icons and (they say) better graphic performance.\n\nA: Like any other Operating System, Windows is called by the firmware (BIOS or UEFI).\nSo if you delete Windows, you will still be able to install Ubuntu. Then when you boot your computer, the firmware will load Ubuntu directly.\nRemark: for Windows8 computers, the firmware is UEFI type. After erasing Windows8, you will probably need to follow the instructions of the 1st paragraph of the UEFI Ubuntu Community Doc.\n\nA: Use somebody else's computer to burn a live cd or make a live usb. Boot your new computer from that, install your linux of choice and you will have never had to boot into the windows environment. There are also places to buy a live cd or live usb if you don't have access to another computer.\n\nA: I'm not sure for certain, but I believe the BIOS is before windows. So, yes, i think you can boot ubuntu before Windows. And if not, you can quickly go through windows and do an immidate install of ubuntu erasing windows from your laptop.\n", "Q: Cant open softwarer center \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I fix a “Problem with MergeList” error when trying to do an update? \n\nI click on software center and it opens and closes so i tried to reinstall it in terminal and i get this error how do i fix this ?\nReading package lists...

I'm new to Linux and just installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my HTPC that I just put together.\nIt has a Z77 chipset with a Intel i3 and Intel 2500 graphics. I'm having an issue with overscan. I have an older Dynex 42inch tv that does not let you turn overscan on or off. I can't see the top, bottom or sides of the screen due to this and I've been trying to fix it.\nI've seen some stuff about modelines, and kernels, but I'm so new to this, all I'm able to do is open the terminal.\nCan someone tell me what to do step by step to get to a point where I can adjust the overscan?\n\nA: Take a look at this thorough guide on UbuntuForums. The trick is to set new display modes with xrandr. After you add the new modes, you adjust the margins accordingly to center the picture on the screen.\n\nA: So I had this very same problem and by searching around (allot!) and fiddling here is the best solution I found.\nIn the terminal type: \nxrandr --output HDMI2 --transform 0.95,0,-52,0,0.97,-35,0,0,1\n\nThen: \nxrandr --output HDMI2 --transform 1,0,-57,0,1,-29,0,0,1\n\nIf this doesn't fit your screen try playing with the 4 numbers I changed always going back to the '1' in substitute for the decimal number on the second input. Also remember to change HDMI2 to your output. You can find this by typing: xrandr -q\nAlso this change is not permanent so you will need to set a script to run at startup.\n\nA: Running a server version of Ubuntu I didn't want to hassle with xrandr.  I used an HDMI to DVI dongle and it got rid of the overscan.  If course, this assumes a monitor with a DVI input as well as HDMI.  \n\nA: I tried these settings (from Jason), and many others. What eventually worked for me was a combination of 2 switches - \"shrinking\" the content then realigning the top-left corner.\nxrandr --output HDMI2 --fb 1240x700 --transform 1,0,-20,0,1,-10,0,0,1\n\nMy TV overscans by 20 pixels on the sides and 10 pixels on the top and bottom. Yours will likely vary.\n\nA: For my TV, a 50\" LG plasma from 2004, running from my acer with Intel HD4000, it worked to set the resolution to 1152x864 and then do:\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --panning 1383x864  --transform 1.2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1\n\nI know it's a 4:3 resolution, but the 20% scale on y-axis, makes it fit perfectly and with correct aspect ratio. \n", "Q: The 4G/LTE Huawei E3276 modem does not work on Ubuntu 12.10 I installed Ubuntu 12.10 on an asus ROG laptop G74sx.

I'm trying to make a USB boot ubuntu for day-to-day operation.  Not live necessarily, but certainly to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Persist changes (including local document store)\n\n*Password-protected logins (though single user)\n\n*Minimal damage to USB blocks\n\n\nI'm not looking to run a machine off of this 24/7, just to use as an alternate boot OS for sitting in hotels with company laptop of an evening; I don't want my stuff left on their platters.\nPersisting changes can be covered by the likes of unetbootin and Universal USB Installer, this much I have gathered.  Secured login though appears to be an issue under such solutions as there is no authentication on these live instances - even creating a new user does not counter this as (I found) the system simply auto logs into the new user and you can't disable this feature - relevant controls are grayed out.\nHow can I disable automatic login on a LiveUSB?\nUsing the above as a guide I stoved my first live USB as the entries in the post do not match the 12.10 file content and adding the additional line appears to be the breaking change; I added it, the install broke.\nOnto USB life-span - I found a rather in depth article and no doubt to some it all makes perfect sense but to be honest I struggled with it, which goes into some detail including the mention of virtual partitions for high read-write processes that are not persistence critical:\nhttp://www.systemateka.com/usbboot.html\nIn contrast to that there are of course (again) the stand-alone applications like unetbootin and Universal USB Installer, but none of them seem to breach whether or not they make use of tmpfs for data that does not need to be persisted, logs, apt cache etc and nor do they state if the file system is set out in a way to preserve the USB - the use of swap partitions is pointless on a stick.\nSO in short, can anyone layout or point me in the the direction of simple steps to achieve my requirements?\nI say simple.. I'm not a complete simpleton, but editing files is simple, copying text is simple, replacing values is simple... running scripts is less simple and if Ubuntu and the Linux community want  Windows dead, there's still a lot to be done to make the life of a casual Linux user, such as I, easy.\nWould also be interested in assisting writing such a guide if someone has the know-how and the inclination; I can document processes given sufficient info :)\nthanks\n\nA: You boot a computer with a Live CD or USB stick. You then insert (another) USB stick and install Ubuntu on to it. When you run the installer, you select the (second) USB drive for installation and choose the manual partitioning. If it creates a swap partition, you can edit and set it to \"do not use the partition.\" There is some \"swap off\" command that you can try.

You should get the grub boot from your USB. You can move this usb to different computers and it should comfortably boot to Ubuntu.\nThe only issue is that since your GRUB setup is hardwired to /dev/sdb1 (second hdd), you would have to make sure that it is the second drive on whichever machine you wish to boot.\n\nA: you can burn multi-system on CD or install multi-system on usb-stick\nand manufacture innumerous distris on one stick.\nhave fun !\n\nA: Following is step by step how to do a Full install of 12.04 on a 8GB flash drive.\n12.10 is similar.\nFor larger drives make larger partitions.\nA quality flash drive with wear leveling, running Ubuntu casually, should last years:\nTurn off and unplug the computer.

Why is it doing this and how do I fix it?\n\nA: I had this problem before with Windows XP Pro. At the time I was installing Linux Mint (which is basically Ubuntu) over it.

Currently it uses 25 GB. \nWithin XP it repeatedly tells me that there is not enough space available.\nI still have plenty of space on my host's primary disk\ndf -h\n/dev/sda1       143G     48G   89G   35% /\n\nWhat to do to expand my XP's disk? This question did not help me, btw.\n\n\nA: You could have added a 40,04GB growing disk, but the Windows partition itself should have been created with the full size at installation time.\nAdd a Ubuntu CD to your virtual machine and boot with it. Launch gparted on the dash. Open the disk.\nYou should see a 40,04GB partition and no free space. If you see a smaller partition and free space, use this own tool to resize and grow the existing partition. \nAfter resizing and restarting your virtual machine, Windows will do a partition check, please let Windows do it at least this time! It's important. Don't worry too much about your data though, it's a normal procedure when resizing NTFS partitions.\n\nA: We have no idea why Windows in your case can not handle the dynamically allocated virtual disk. It may be worth to check the filesystem integrity or perform a defragmentation from your Windows guest OS.\nNevertheless we can easily increase the size of a dynamically growing virtual drive reported to the guest OS by issueing the following command run in a terminal:\nVBoxManage modifyhd <uuid/name> --resize <newsize in MB>\n\nReplace  with the uuid or the filename (full path needed) of your virtual drive. These can be listed with the following command:\nVBoxManage list hdds\n\nNote that obviously we can not change the virtual drive size if we had taken snapshots or saved the machine's state instead of power off. Before we change the virtual drive's size we therefore need to delete all snapshots, or work on a clone to makes sure we do not loose a snapshot's content. Shrinking a dynamically growing disk is not possible.\nAfter having resized the virtual drive we will then have to adapt the partition table of the guest to altered drive's size.\nIn Windows 7 go to Computer Management -> Disk Management to view new unallocated space (shown after resizing with adding 10 GB to the drive):\n\nRight click on this unallocated partition to select \"Extend Volume...\" to increase the partition size. You may also do this with booting an Ubuntu live .iso on this virtual machine to resize partitions using gparted.\nMore details here: Virtual Box User Manual\nSee also: How do I increase the hard disk size of the virtual machine?\nTo physically shrink/compact a dynamically growing disk see: How do I shrink a dynamically growing VDI disk from VirtualBox?\n", "Q: How to re-install network I had an issue with my realtek network drivers and r8168.

I have installed virtual box 4.2 on a Ubuntu 11.10 host.\nI have Windows 7 as the only guest OS.\nI'm able to auto start Windows 7 virtual when Ubuntu boots by adding it in start application with the command \"VBoxMange startvm Win7\" in the command option.\nNow when I shutdown Windows 7 , the virtualbox program is getting closed, but I go back to Ubuntu, when I want to have Ubuntu shut down as well when I click Shutdown in Windows 7 in Virtualbox.\nThis is an assignment for me. Can anybody please help me on this?\nAlso, when virtual box starts up automatically, Ubuntu's desktop should not be visible.\n\nA: The way to do this is to write a script to start your VM, wait until it terminates, and then issue the shut-down command.\nCreate a folder bin in your home folder (if it does not exist already).\nNow create a file with the following contents. Let's call it win7vmshutdown, and save it in your bin folder.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nVBoxManage startvm 'Win7'                           # Start the VM.\n\nsleep 10s                                           # Give it time to start up. \n\nwhile pgrep VirtualBox >/dev/null                   # As long as the VM is running...\ndo\n        sleep 5s                                    # Wait a bit before trying again.\ndone\n\ngnome-session-quit --power-off                      # Issue the command to shut down.\n\nMake the script executable; enter the following in a Terminal.\nchmod +x ~/bin/win7vmshutdown\n\nIn your Startup Applications, remove the VBoxManage ... command and replace it with win7vmshutdown.\nThe shutdown command will prompt you for shutdown; if you don't answer, it will shut down in 60 seconds. This gives you time to interrupt the shutdown in case of unexpected problems.\nReboot your computer to test.\nYou said:\n\nAlso, when virtual box starts up automatically, Ubuntu's desktop should not be visible.\n\nTo do that, you want to run your VM in full-screen. Install the Guest Additions in your VM, reboot it, and run it full-screen.\n\nA: You need to create a script that runs on your Windows box that performs a coordinated shutdown of your systems.\nFrom what I read, you want to trigger this from inside your Windows 7 VM.\nFor a scriptable shutdown of Windows 7, use the psshutdown utility from SysInternals.\nYou will also need to signal your host to shut down. The best way to do this is to remotely trigger it using secure shell. \nOn the Ubuntu machine :\nYou should create a user specifically for this task, and an SSH key specifically for this user. This user will be running a script with elevated privileges and access to it should be at a minimum.\nOn the Windows machine : \nYou will need a means to run the script on the host machine via SSH. The Cygwin version of OpenSSH is probably the best option.\nSo your Windows script should\n\n\n*\n\n*Use SSH to start the script on the host\n\n*Run psshutdown -t 0 -k\nThe Ubuntu script should\n\n\n*\n\n*Be owned by root\n\n*Have the setuid attribute on so that it will run with root privileges\n\n*sleep for a period of time greater than the Windows machine shutdown\n\n*Execute /sbin/poweroff\nAs for the other matter - if you don't want to see the Ubuntu desktop at any time, you can just not load it.

Its a fresh new Edubuntu installation, I haven’t installed any updates yet.\n\nA: It seems that NTFS formatted drives do not support executable files. As stated here:\n\nSetting executable permission of any files at ntfs partition on Linux is almost impossible.\n\nThe solutions I've seen so far are very hacky and I wouldn't recommend them unless you know what you are doing.\nAn easy workaround would be to move the whole game files to an ext4 file system, for example, create a Games directory in your home directory, move the Doom3 BFG files there and make the executable files executable again:\n$ chmod +x ~/Games/Doom3BFG/myExecutable\n\nAfter that you should be able to run the file by double clicking it or run from command line with \n$ ~/Games/Doom3BFG/myExecutable\n\nIf you prefer the more hacky way and want to run it only from your NTFS file system, you should read on the following threads:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can't set permissions for files on an NTFS partition\n\n*Enable Setting Executable Permission of Files at NTFS Partition\n\n*How can I run an executable from a CD when it doesn't have the executable bit set?\n", "Q: Bash - Get Sudoer Username?

How much RAM can i add and is it worth upgrading to 64bit afterwards?\nI hope that this question is suitable for this forum\nAdvice greatly appreciated \n\nA: You can check out the details of your computer's memory through terminal by running\nsudo dmidecode -t memory\n\nOne of the things this will show you is the maximum amount of RAM your computer supports. It also tells you which type you're using now, which is something to keep in mind. For more information on that, here's the Wikipedia page on DDR SDRAM. Important to know is that different types are \"neither forward nor backward compatible with any earlier type of random access memory (RAM) due to different signaling voltages, timings, and other factors\".\n\nA: 64-bit won't hurt.\n64-bit runs acceptably on machines with less then 4GB of RAM. I used to run it on ONE GB, on an old machine of mine. While you may still want more RAM, switching to 64-bit won't hurt (except in extremely rare cases), and even will help if you don't have 4 GB of RAM. This is because files greater than 4 GB can still be mmap'ed, boosting disk access and disk seek times, especially when files are cache[citation needed]. Another important thing is that even when working with small datasets, processing is faster since in one operation, up to 64 bits can be processed quickly and efficiently, as opposed to 32. For example, a program that factors numbers can perform a larger division in one instruction, as opposed to 4 or so on 32-bit.\nThe same goes for database and scalable applications, as well as even data-intensive things  such as Ruby on Rails.\n", "Q: Recent Update crashed Unity and Window manager I just updated a few packages.

For example, if you are installing to a USB disk, it might be /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc etc.\n\nA: Yes, this is possible. You can use the Startup Disk Creator from Ubuntu to do that.

But you should make a backup before ;-)\n\nA: Since you're using Windows, you can check this guide to create a bootable USB drive on windows Or just use Universal USB Installer which is quite self explanatory to use.\nAfter installing ubuntu on flash drive, you can put your files and folders in it without any problem.\n\nA: No, user files and settings are not saved on other storage media in Live environment, unless you explicitly do so. E.g. – mounting the hard drive and creating/saving configuration files on it.\nHowever, if the internal hard drive has a Linux swap partition on it, the Live OS may use it as a “ramdisk” for increasing the system’s performance.\n", "Q: error occured while installing ubuntu 12.04 using Windows installer for Ubuntu Desktop While trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 using wubi on my machine which is already installed with Win7, at last it is throwing an Error Pop-up with error code 22 and also says that INVALID ARGUMENT.

I am having a hard time understand who depends on who using apt-cache depends and apt-cache rdepends. I am keeping a long list of packages that I installed to solve a number of dependency problems.\nI would like to know which packages set to manually installed could be set to automatically installed (they are in the dependency tree of another package that is manually installed)?\n\nA: aptitude markauto marks packages as automatically installed. By default aptitude asks for removal of automatically installed packages that have no dependent package installed. So if you run:\nsudo aptitude markauto <your long list of packages>\n\nIt will ask for confirmation to mark the packages as automatically installed and if some of those packages have no dependent package installed it will ask for confirmation to remove them. Basically the packages aptitude says will be marked as automatically installed have dependent packages installed and should not be removed, and the packages aptitude says will be removed have no dependent packages installed and may be safely removed. Obviously you can cancel the command before any change be made by typing Ctrl+C at the confirmation prompt.\n", "Q: Having trouble with mounting the hardisk My Seagate USB hard disk won't mount.\nfdisk -l reports:\nDisk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes  \n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders, total 976773168 sectors  \nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes  \nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes  \nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes  \nDisk identifier: 0x0001607e\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System  \n/dev/sda1   *        2048      206847      102400    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT  \n/dev/sda2          206848   163842047    81817600    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT  \n/dev/sda3       163844094   976773119   406464513    5  Extended  \n/dev/sda5       163844096   217092095    26624000   83  Linux  \n/dev/sda6       217094144   225900543     4403200   82  Linux swap / Solaris  \n/dev/sda7       225902592   583307263   178702336    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT  \n/dev/sda8       583320213   976768064   196723926    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT  \n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 1000.2 GB, 1000204885504 bytes  \n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 121601 cylinders, total 1953525167 sectors  \nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes  \nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes  \nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes  \nDisk identifier: 0x174de4c5  \n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System  \n/dev/sdb1   *        2048  1953521663   976759808    6  FAT16  \n\nsudo mount -t auto /dev/sdb1 /media/newhd reports:\nmount: you must specify the filesystem type  \n\nsudo blkid reports:\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"System Reserved\" UUID=\"EA8CA5B58CA57D27\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda2: UUID=\"7A66B7F966B7B46B\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"b2c6b94a-132c-440d-95ea-33ee55d60ec9\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda6: UUID=\"022d77c7-fc22-4dd7-b280-0fe400ae052f\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sda7: LABEL=\"Study\" UUID=\"7398578669B29A5E\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda8: UUID=\"43215121476DA725\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n\nPreviously it was NTFS partition and due to some technical mistake it has converted to FAT16.\n\nA: Try with these commands:\nsudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sdb1 /media/newhd\nsudo mount -t fat /dev/sdb1 /media/newhd\n\nI find strange that your disk comes with a FAT16 partition. \n\nA: It seems you could have wiped the data.

I have a single OS - Ubuntu 12.4. Lately my laptop (HP ProBook 4530s) heating up until it automatically shuts down. It wasn't happening with the older Ubuntu version. After that I started getting prompt messages that I don't have enough disk space. Thought it was somehow connected with the heating up, so started looking for solutions.

Thanks!\n\nA: Overheating is a hardware issue - software should be unable to make properly maintained hardware overheat.\nThe most common overheating issue for laptops is dust accumulation in the cooling system. For that, you should clear your heatsinks and airducts with some forced air. You may have to open the case to do this ; refer to maintenance manuals for your hardware if you can get them.\nDisk space issues are nothing to do with overheating. It looks like your entire disk is allocated to the OS, so you probably have filled it up - I'd guess with video media, since few other things fill 640GB these days. If the lack of disk space is preventing you from booting the OS, boot from a LiveCD or LiveUSB, mount your OS drive, and delete some files.\nEdit : since you edited your question things are clearer ; it's much more likely that you've filled your root partition. Your root partition only seems to have about 10GB of space, which is on the small side. One place you might look for data to remove is in /var/log, another is /var/cache, particularly /var/cache/apt where the package manager keeps archives.\nYou might want to consider backing up your home folder (I presume this is mounted in /dev/sda6) and repartitioning your disk so that more than 10GB is available to the root OS.\n", "Q: How to re-enable lock screen?

If there are files in places like /bin that only root can execute, it is probably for security reasons.  \nThat said, be careful running your scripts as root too, as bugs in code can lead to breaking your OS (i.e don't do your experimentation with rm as root).\n\nA: I would advise NOT doing this on a live filesystem.

One of the things that has kept me away from gnome until now is the lack of a common, central place for configuration. This was bad in the old days, but after the advent of compiz, mutter and dconf, and the unofficial tweak utils (gnome-tweak, ubuntu-tweak, unsettings, etc.), it's even more confusing.\nEspecially when things don't work as expected. Some keyboard shortcuts are set in one place, some in others; some are taken over from one vanilla gnome to Unity, others seem to go unnoticed. Maybe they conflict with some other setting, but there is no notification to that effect. Etc.\nI've also experienced, when playing around with different flavors of GNOME (Gnome 2, Gnome 3, Unity, Gnome Shell, Cinnamon, etc.), that sometimes changes in one of them will have no effect on the others -- sometimes they will mess them up completely (or cause a revert to the default upon next login).\nSo, to get to the question: Can someone point me to a survey of how the various GNOMEs relate to each other -- to the various backends/systems, and to the configuration frontends? Which configurations in one (say Gnome Shell) will have effects on others (say Unity)?\n\nA: I've definitely ran into these issues when testing with different desktop environments and I can understand your concern. One thing to keep in mind is that KDE likes to mind its own business so when you install KDE without recommends or suggests turned on your KDE environment is entirely on its own.\nYou also have to be careful for display managers. Unity, LXDE and XFCE use LDM. KDE uses KDM, and Gnome uses GDM. Usually if you keep suggests and recommends turned off you will be fine. Another good way to look at dependencies\napt-cache depends [package-name]\n\nIf you want to just look at core dependencies\napt-cache depends [package name] | grep Depends\n\nTo get to your question, configuration files are tricky. Unity has been trying to get off of Gnome dependencies for a while and for the most part it has. Unity and Gnome both depend on similar libraries like: Cairo, ATK, GTK, Glib, Compiz and probably others that I couldn't find.\nYour best bet is to experiment in a safer environment. You can download an Ubuntu ISO and do some testing in VirtualBox. Or you can backup everything onto an external hard drive and test directly on your machine, and if something bad happens then you have a backup.\nI'm sorry I couldn't give you a more direct answer, but I'm sure a more direct answer would be helpful to many people who also want to try out and experiment with different desktops environments. \n", "Q: Ubuntu Live USB doesn't boot on Dell Dell Inspiron 17r I am trying to boot an Ubuntu 12.10 Live USB on  a Dell Inspiron 17r. However, after I boot from the usb, it briefly displays the red screen with keyboard and accessibility icon. It then goes to a black screen with an unmoving line in the top left hand corner. The computer is not making any sounds of activity, and the light on the usb is pulsing slowly, not blinking rapidly as it usually does when running Ubuntu. How can I get my live USB to work the my computer?\n\nA: I was able to find this amazing blog post that gave instructions on how to boot correctly from the USB. You can find it here.\n", "Q: can i restore my Ubuntu Deja Dup to a Lubuntu install? Are Ubuntu and Lubuntu similar enough to use a Deja Dup of my home directory from Ubuntu 12.04 to restore it to a different distro of Ubuntu - specifically Lubuntu 12.04?  As I understand it there are differences beyond just the desktop environment and default apps, but I'm not quite savvy enough to know fundamentally what they are.\n\nA: I'd say it \"depends\". Purely data files such as documents, spreadsheets, music and video should be fine.\nWhere you could run into complications is  \n\n\n*\n\n*with config files, often hidden, various programs store in your home\nfolder and\n\n*with the contents of ~/.local.\n\n\nIf they are tailored for Unity and they replace your current Lubuntu config files, things may not work as they should. But you mostly likely won't experience data loss.\nCaveat: this just seems logical to me; I have not tried what you wish to do.\nHere is a link related to the issue: What is TargetEnvironment=Unity?. At first glance it may seem unrelated but, sometimes, .desktop files are present in ~/.local/share/applications. \n\nA: If you are just backing up your home folder, you will be fine.  Consider that you might have both Ubuntu and Lubuntu environments on the same machine and could switch between them.\nEspecially since you are considering 12.04 versions of both.  I believe you will be fine.\nThat said, for a one-off backup for the purposes of switching Ubuntu versions, I think you have two better choices: 1) simply copy your files over to a USB drive and copy them back.  2) Use the Lubuntu installer support for keeping /home but replacing everything else (Ubuntu's installer does this, I believe Lubuntu's does as well).\n", "Q: Ubuntu Toshiba Dynadock u3.0 I am having a few issues with my new Dynadock u3.0.\nFirst of all, all of the USB connections are working as well as the usb ethernet.

So of you backup to ~/Ubuntu One, that folder will be excluded.\nThat said, DD has built in support for Ubuntu One in modern versions of Ubuntu.  So instead of simply backing up to the default U1 folder and having your backup files synchronized to all your computers, DD can backup to a cloud folder in U1 that isn't synchronized by default.  This also means that the backup files won't take up any space on your local machine.

You will find all of your wallpaper settings.\nNote: most of the wallpapers have a max resolution of 2048 x 1280.\nIt's hard to answer your questions since I can't replicate the issue, Ubuntu by default uses one wallpaper for all screens. I know KDE by default has a different wallpaper per screen, so you will need to change the wallpaper explicitly for each screen.\nHere is a related thread.\nMaybe if you reverse engineer the instructions on that post you can solve your issue.\n", "Q: The program 'rails' is currently not installed I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 on VirtualBox.\nI installed rvm, ruby and rails following this tutorial.\nBut when I restart, I am getting this error:\nThe program 'rails' is currently not installed.

You can install it by typing:\n  sudo apt install ruby-railties\n\nThe issue is simply caused by the rails executable not being globally accessible by programs.\nHere's how I solved it\nNote: If you are working on a production server, endeavour to make a backup of your database before trying out the solution below to avoid data loss.\nFor my case, my version manager was rbenv and not rvm\nRe-install rbenv itself. Clone the rbenv repository from GitHub into the directory ~/.rbenv:\ngit clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv\nNext, add ~/.rbenv/bin to your $PATH so that you can use the rbenv command line utility. Do this by altering your ~/.bashrc file so that it affects future login sessions:\necho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc\nThen add the command eval \"$(rbenv init -)\" to your ~/.bashrc file so rbenv loads automatically:\necho 'eval \"$(rbenv init -)\"' >> ~/.bashrc\nNext, apply the changes you made to your ~/.bashrc file to your current shell session:\nsource ~/.bashrc\nVerify that rbenv is set up properly by using the type command, which will display more information about the rbenv command:\ntype rbenv\nYour terminal window will display the following:\nrbenv is a function\nrbenv ()\n{\n    local command;\n    command=\"${1:-}\";\n    if [ \"$#\" -gt 0 ]; then\n        shift;\n    fi;\n    case \"$command\" in\n        rehash | shell)\n            eval \"$(rbenv \"sh-$command\" \"$@\")\"\n        ;;\n        *)\n            command rbenv \"$command\" \"$@\"\n        ;;\n    esac\n}\n\nIf everything worked right, running the command below will display the versions of Ruby and Rails previously installed on your machine:\nruby -v\nrails -v\n\nElse, run a fresh installation of Ruby and Rails on your machine.\nThat's all\nI hope this helps\n", "Q: Ubuntu permissions to open files My Macbook Pro hard drive is not working and I don't have a backup cd.

Today I was installing phpmyadmin on Ubuntu 12.04 and after a while a dialogue popped up stating what server I want to use; apache2 or httpd\nAre these, two different kinds of server?\n\nA: httpd is the same as apache2. It depends on the OS you use. For example in RHEL 6.2 it is called httpd and in Ubuntu it is called apache2.\n\nA: TL;DR\nThey are the same application - just that some Linux distributions refer to it differently within package managers and config files. RedHat-based distros (CentOS, Fedora) refer to it as httpd while Debian-based distros (Ubuntu) refer to it as apache. Gentoo, strangely enough, mostly refers to it as apache - but config files have httpd in the naming conventions.\nBackground\nThe application's development is managed by the Apache Foundation. Its name is actually Apache HTTP Server. It is often also called Apache httpd (http daemon) by the Apache Foundation. Colloquially, Unix admins have historically called it Apache and, even with the RedHat-based distributions, everyone already knows what you're referring to when you simply say Apache.\n\nA: The directives used in apache2 and httpd config files are slightly different, as well as the directory structure. It's advised to install apache2 on Debian-based distros (Ubuntu) and httpd on RedHat-based distros (RedHat, CentOS, Fedora). \nHowever, if you install httpd and its dependencies on Ubuntu, it works as well.\n", "Q: How to get out of grub error and stop it from happening again?

Also what is the middle partition used for? because when i boot now, i get options to do linux, or generic, or x86 and stuff.  Is that safe to delete?\n\nA: I hope I can answer your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The unallocated space is space on your hard disk that is not being used by any partitions; think of it as \"blank space\". To increase the size of that partition, boot from your live DVD or USB and open GParted. In the bottom list of partitions, right click the \"extended\" and \"linux-swap\" partitions and Unmount each of them. Select your Extended partition, click the \"⇥\" button (move or resize), and with your mouse click'n'drag the left side of the blue box all the way to the left. In the same way, use the Move or Resize (⇥) tool to click'n'drag the red linux-swap partition to move it all the way to the left, and then click'n'drag the right side of the blue partition again to close it in. You may have to close the tool and select the partition you want if it does not allow you to play with both partitions simaltaneously. Then you have a small light blue box containing the red box, expect it's all the way on the left of your unallocated space.\n\n*Select the dark blue partition, click the ⇥ button again, and click'n'drag the left side as far to the left as you can.\n\n*Click the green check mark, and apply the operations. This will be a long process, at least a few minutes, but you will see the progress.\n\n*Reboot. You may have trouble booting. If that happens, boot from your live DVD or USB again and use this guide to re-install the GRUB boot loader: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\n*You don't need to worry about any of the options on the GRUB menu for a normal boot. You will only need to use the top one, so when you see the menu, just press Enter. Your other options are Rescue mode, where you can make repairs if a normal boot doesn't work, or a Memtest.\nI hope that helps!\n\n", "Q: Copy text in Libre Office Writer If I have a Writer document that is a numbered list of instructions, and I highlight a chunk of text, or even just a single word in a line of the list, and copy it to the clipboard, go to another program, i.e. gedit, and paste the copied text, the number of the item/line that the text was originally copied from gets pasted as well, even if it was not highlighted to copy. \nCan this behavior be changed?\n\nA: I remember from old days I used to work with MS Office under Windows that this also used to be the case with MS Word and Notepad.\nSo I doubt it can be changed as you wanted probably because it is deep-rooted in the logic of word-processing programs.\nHowever, as a workaround, you can click on the Numbering icon on the Toolbar to turn numbering off before copying text, and then click on it again to turn it back on, or press Ctrl+Z to undo this last action. \n", "Q: Linksys AE3000 How to work around?

It begins with a shebang line that points to the interpreter that must execute the script. The path to the interpreter is usr/bin/python2.6, and this file doesn't exist.\nFirst, that line is wrong. The shebang line must have an absolute path. Change #!usr/bin/python2.6 to #!/usr/bin/python2.6.\nDepending on your version of Ubuntu, you may or may not have /usr/bin/python2.6. If you only have a later version such as 2.7, change the shebang line to #!/usr/bin/python2. It is highly unlikely that the program would work with 2.6 but not 2.7. Python 2.x versions are upward compatible. (But don't change to /usr/bin/python3, there are incompatibilities between Python 2 and Python 3.)\nSee /bin/sh: ./check-dependencies.pl: not found — but check-dependencies.pl exists! for more explanations.\n\nA: Check if the file in question does not have CRLF chars (visible as ^M in vi), that is, DOS-style line end char sequences. Sometimes they are not visible in various terminals/editors, while bash tries to run a script with interpreter like /bin/bash^M, which doesn't exist, hence the error.\n", "Q: How to report or block an inappropriate application in the Ubuntu Software Centre? While browsing through the Ubuntu Software Center I noticed a publication that I think is inappropriate.\nIs there is a way to report possibly inappropriate applications?\n\nA: You can ask questions of the Ubuntu Software Center team here.\nPer Section 6 of the USC Terms of Use:\n\n...Canonical is not responsible for any app provided by any third\n  party. Should you reasonably believe that any third-party app you\n  access through the Software Centre is in breach of any law, regulation\n  or third party's rights, you should notify Canonical in writing at the\n  address below. In doing so, please:* identify the material which you\n  believe to be infringing;* identify what you believe this material\n  infringes and why;* provide your name, email address, address and\n  telephone number;* confirm that you believe in good faith that this\n  material is infringing a law or third party's rights and that, to the\n  best of your knowledge, the information you are providing is\n  correct;*...\n\nIf you believe this to be the case, you should contact the USC team with the information requested in the terms of use.\nIf you are looking to block certain applications from the Software Center, you may want to take a look at this question. \nWhile it only addresses hiding the entire category of commercial applications, it may give you some pointers on how to target a specific application.\n\nA: It seems like there's two questions here, since reporting and blocking are extremely different acts.\nmaggotbrain's excellent answer presents the policy for requesting that content be removed from the Ubuntu Software Center. (Removed, in the sense that it will no longer be distributed through that platform, and thus nobody will see it in the Software Center--not just you.)\nRemember though, as per the terms, \"applications\" are removed if they are:\n\nin breach of any law, regulation or third party's rights.\n\nThe same presumably applies to non-program content too, like publications.\nIf one of those applies, you should feel free to go ahead and report it. Otherwise, remember that being offensive to you is not sufficient reason to prevent others from accessing something.\nIt is often good reason to avoid accessing it yourself though. So if you want to keep a particular item from appearing in the Software Center for you, and you find that existing questions about that don't address that, please feel free to post a new question.\nWhile you mentioned blocking in your question here, you were really asking two different questions in one; you'll have better luck if you ask it separately. (When you do, please be sure to explain exactly what you mean by blocking. People might think you're trying to block access to a particular item for an entire corporate network, for example, which would be a entirely different question from what you appear to be asking.)\n", "Q: Why doesn't Cheese not allow for multiple effects to be selected at the same time? For some reason in cheese on my 12.10 Ubuntu box, it seems I can not choose multiple effects. Is this a bug or what?\n\nA: This is the way it is designed to work.

Running cat /proc/sys/kernel/tainted prints the current kernel taint value (in base 10). My understanding is that this value is a bitfield, where each bit indicates the absence or presence of a particular type of taint. You can extract the bits using\npython3 -c 'from pprint import pprint; pprint(list(zip(range(50), reversed(bin(int(open(\"/proc/sys/kernel/tainted\").read()))[2:]))))'\n\nI've searched for documentation, but what I've seen only identifies the meaning of bits 0 through 10.

To the extent to which they are not, I suspect some characters just didn't copy and paste correctly, or that there is a discrepancy between what appeared in your Terminal window and what you were able to put into your post. I also improved the formatting in your post but perhaps I made a mistake; that could also account for the discrepancy.\nI am not worried. Unless you have additional information to suggest a problem, I wouldn't recommend you be concerned either.\nHere's what all your error messages mean:\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `>'\n\nThe > operator redirects the output of the command on the left to the file specified on the right. But you have more than one of these, separated from each other with spaces (so you're not making the >> operator, for instance.) That is a syntax error. > can only be followed by a valid filename.\n[ADMIN]: command not found\n\nYou ran a string as a command that contained the | operator. This runs the command to the left of it, and sends (pipes) its output to be the input of the command on the right. The first word of the command on the left was [ADMIN], so it was interpreted as the name of the command and everything following it was interpreted as command-line arguments to that command.\nBut there is no [ADMIN] command--no shell builtin, shell alias, shell function, or program by that name. Therefore, that command was not found and could not be run.\nBukkit: command not found\n\nThis is the same situation, just on the right-hand side of the | operator.\nforums.bukkit.org: command not found\n\nYou ran a command where the first word (i.e., before the first space) was forums.bukkit.org, like [ADMIN] and Bukkit, there is no command called forums.bukkit.org.\nucd@ucd-uc:~$ 30 posts - 6 authors - Feb 19, 2012 30: command not found\n\nI'm not entirely sure what's going on here. The error message appears on a line where a command was entered, which is unusual, though it sometimes happens when a program runs and produces strange output (output without the expected carriage returns, or output produced after the program has already returned control of the terminal to the shell that invoked it.\nBut it's not unexpected to see another command not found error, from text that isn't commands randomly being pasted into the terminal.\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\nThe line you ran contained a leading parenthesis (and a closing one, too, but the shell never got far enough to parse that) under circumstances that didn't make sense to the shell. Parentheses are used to group commands, and the syntax you gave is inconsistent with that use.\nucd@ucd-uc:~$ Getting the process ID in a shell script\n\nThis is not output at all. This is just the last line you pasted. Since it's the last line, no carriage return was pasted. So this is just the text you pasted, on a prompt. You can press Ctrl+C to get rid of it.\n", "Q: Trouble With Persistence After Making a USB Live Thumb Drive Using Pendrivelinux I created a bootable Ubuntu on my 32GB thumb drive (on a NTFS partition) and I selected a persistence of 4GB.\nI've noticed that when I reboot from the initial booting off of the USB thumb drive, nothing is preserved.  No apps that were installed nor saved bookmarks.\nIs there a way for me to manually force persistence?  \n\nA: Be sure you have and always select \"Persistent\" option after booting from usb - if you do not see this option the usb has no persistence: it happened to me often for some reason.\nAnd to be sure that it works, I use, beside FAT32 (as stated in the other answer) a program called LiveUSB Install - here.\n\n\n\nIt provides a clear and nice interface for selecting the \"persistent\" boot (cannot give a screenshot of that) - it should be the second in the list after booting from live usb.\n\nA: *\n\n*List of \"Related\" questions on the right column might be helpful in solving your problem (e.g. making sure you have the boot option \"persistent\" in the configuration file) \n\n*Instead of NTFS, FAT32 format might be more problem-free for Ubuntu live USB with persistence.\n\n*Trying the Linux utility MultiSystem might work better in creating Ubuntu live USB with persistence: http://liveusb.info/dotclear/index.php?pages/install\n\nA: Plug your USB into a computer running Linux or Windows.\nIf you used UNetbootin to make the persistent drive open syslinux.cfg.\nIf you used Startup Disk creator open txt.cfg, (or text.cfg, depending on version).\nYou should see a line similar to:\nappend  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper persistent initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash noprompt --\nIf \"persistent\" is missing, add it.\n\nA: I fixed my problem, but it was an unconventional way.  \nI gave up trying to get Ubuntu or Xubuntu onto a USB live drive due to the persistence issue so I went with Linux Mint (which is derived from Ubuntu).  But I still used the same tool that I tried to make a live USB drive for Ubuntu and Xubuntu.  \nTo answer Cipricus' question, the tool I used was the Pendrive Linux tool you can get here:  http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3.\nIn hindsight, I don't know if the problem is with the Pendrive Linux tool or the latest versions of Ubuntu / Xubuntu but I solved my problem simply by trying a different distro.\n", "Q: Hardware RAID1 device is the wrong size/too small?

This happens everytime I open it, after booting the computer or just after closing the browser with the X. There is a button that offers me to open the recent tabs, but the button does not work and Chrome does not find anything, I end up on a blank page.\nIn order to solve my problems, I tried to turn off my extensions and that kind of things, but I found out that it does not work. Plus, the changes are not saved in Chrome apparently, I suggest that it is because it does not close properly.\nI would like to solve this problem without removing and re-installing Chrome because I have a lot of stuff saved in my bookmarks and the configuration of my address bar*. The problem started out of the blue, not after any update or anything. I want it to be solved because I need to have access to my recently closed tabs when the browser opens.\nI tried to update with the current stable version of Chrome but it did not change anything.\n*Edit: my Address bar has search engines configured (maps, language translation, wikipedia...)\n\nA: One of the possibilities is that your browser's profile has been corrupted. Without doing anything that could cause you to lose data, you could try making a new profile as described here: Create a new browser user profile in the section on Linux.\nBut, in short (although you should read the link above completely),  \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that Chrome is not running at all.\n\n*Rename ~/.config/google-chrome/Default to\n~/.config/google-chrome/Default.bak.\n\n*Start Chrome. See if your problem is fixed.\n\n\nNote that .config is a hidden folder. You'll need to enable viewing of hidden files and folders in your File Manager. Of course, if you use the command line, you could run something like:\nmv ~/.config/google-chrome/Default ~/.config/google-chrome/Default.bak\n\nIf your problem is fixed, gradually copy over only files that you absolutely need (because some of them may be responsible for your problem in the first place) from Default.bak to the new Default folder that Chrome automatically creates.\nFurther, since you need your bookmarks, they are stored as a simple text file called Bookmarks in the Default folder so copying them over from Default.bak to the new Default should probably not break anything and give you back your bookmarks. Again, it's better to do this when Chrome is not running at all.\nAs for \"configuration of my address bar\", I don't know what that means. Perhaps you may want to edit your question to explain that aspect.\nEdit: if you don't want to go the \"new profile\" route and if you have another Google account, you may try adding a new user. That option is available in chrome://settings. Do take look at the options which include importing stuff from another profile!\n\n\nA: I had a similar issue where it displayed \"did not shut down properly\" every time after booting up. \nFor me this was happening due to Google Chrome running in the background even after closing it, as this was the default setup after installation.\nI fixed it by going to the Advanced settings in chrome \" Settings -> System -> Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed\" and unchecking the box beside it.\n\nA: This was happening to me too and it was driving me crazy!\nIn my situation (trusty), this had nothing to do with user profiles. My issue was that the desktop environment was shutting down prior to the background chrome process; this caused chrome to 'ungracefully' exit and bug me about it with each restart. \nSome of the solutions you find on line get around this by never letting chrome run as a background process, which was an unacceptable trade off for me.\nI fixed it on my system by adding a stanza to the Upstart script for the desktop manager (Lightdm). You need to edit /etc/init/lightdm.conf as root:\nsudo nano /etc/init/lightdm.conf\n\nAdd the following at the end of the file:\npre-stop script\n    pkill --oldest chrome\n    sleep 2\nend script\n\nHope this works for you!\n\nA: In my case it stemmed from gnome-keyring-daemon which was syncing data over internet and daemon keeps running in the background. \nTo fix it, run it with chrome --password-store=basic  --disk-cache-size=1 --media-cache-size=1 switches.

I have a script (called eclipse) in ~/usr/bin/ which runs Eclipse IDE.\nI can open any terminal and simply type eclipse and it runs fine like you would expect.\nBut when using the following .desktop file:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nName=Eclipse - Juno (4.2)\nIcon=/home/ben/.icons/eclipse.svg\nExec=eclipse\n\nI get the error:\n\nBut when I change the Exec= line to:\nExec=/home/ben/usr/bin/eclipse\n\nit works perfectly.\nThe Official Unity Launchers and Desktop files documentation suggests that this should work:\n\nExec is the path to the executable file. The full path to the executable file must be used only in case it isn't in any of the paths specified in the $PATH variable. For example, any files that are inside the path /usr/bin don't need to have their full path specified in the Exec field, but only their filename. \n\nAny suggestions on what is happening?\n\nA: The tilde doesn't get expanded in .pam_environment the way it would in a profile script, and desktop files don't do shell expansion on their Exec lines the way the shell would, so it's looking for a file that's literally named ~/usr/bin/eclipse, which of course doesn't exist.\nReplace the tilde in the PATH assignment with ${HOME} and it seems to work.\n\nA: What is said on the Ubuntu documentation makes sense, however its \"not recommended anymore\" section is lacking in some details. For that reason, my answer will involve using one of these methods. Also: it is already used for this exact same purpose.\nTake a quick visit to your ./.profile file.\nMine contains this:\n# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.\n# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login\n# exists.\n# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.\n# the files are located in the bash-doc package.\n\n# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask\n# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.\n#umask 022\n\n# if running bash\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n    # include .bashrc if it exists\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n    . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n    fi\nfi\n\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nAs you can see by the last section of this file (lines below # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists), this is already being done. So if you wanted to add something to the $PATH variable, you would simply do the same thing. The documentation did mention that this will be run every time the system is started.\nIn your case, all you would need to do is add this:\n# set PATH to custom variable (this line is not needed)\nif [ -d \"$HOME/usr/bin\" ]; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/usr/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nAt this point I am starting to think that the only reason that this method is not recommended anymore is it involves scripting on startup, which is very sensitive to slight mistakes. When someone is working with something like this, however, a small mistake could be undone simply by changing the file back to the way it was.\nIf you are not sure how to do this:\n1) First, press CTRL+ALT+F3\n2) Log in by following the onscreen prompt\n3) Type this into the command prompt:\n/usr/bin/nano ./.profile\n\n4) remove these lines: (we just added them)\n# set PATH to custom variable (this line is not needed)\nif [ -d \"$HOME/usr/bin\" ]; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/usr/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\n5) press CTRL+O (as in Out)\n6) press CTRL+X (as in eXit)\n7) type exit and press ENTER (sometimes RETURN)\n8) now press CTRL+ALT+F7\n9) You should get your login screen or desktop, depending on when the problem occured. If not, press CTRL+ALT+DEL (sometimes CTRL+ALT+DELETE) and your system should restart safely.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to install matlab if I already have a Windows version?

Is there a gui to control processes on Ubuntu 12.04? Im using BootUp Manager (bum) to control auto-start processes on Ubuntu 12.04. I have stopped Apache2 from starting automatically using bum. The problem is, today I have found that sql server is always running in the back. I can not alter auto-start settings for MYSQL from bum.\nWhy I can not see any entry for MySQL in bum, moreover does sql needed by the Ubuntu OS itself for its own processes ? If not needed by the OS itself ,then is it safe to disable MySQL and restart it whenever I need it ? How should I do that ?\nIs there any gui application for doing so ?

You have probably installed mysql while installing something else as well. To disable mysql from starting automatically you might want to execute:\nsudo update-rc.d mysql disable\n\nIf you no longer want mysql installed at all then you can:\nsudo apt-get remove mysql-server \n\nPlease note that if you remove the \"mysql-server\" package that your Ubuntu system probably will report that there are other packages that depend on it that may be removed. in that case, you will have to choose to do so or not, before proceeding.\n\nA: SQL is not needed for core Ubuntu functionality, so it's safe for you to start and stop it as you see fit.

By default it uses ATI, which consumes more power and heats up a lot. Is that possible between ATI and on board depending upon our requirement, so that I can save my battery and avoid laptop on heating up?\n\nA: You can use AMD's proprietary driver to install the Catalyst Control Center, which lets you choose between the graphics card or the CPU's integrated graphics. I've read that, because Intel + AMD switching is fairly new, the automatic features may not work yet. However, the Control Center supposedly lets you switch manually in software.\nAMD's website, which may be out of date, notes in the fine print,\n\nLinux OS supports manual switching which requires restart of X-Server to switch between graphics solutions.\n\nAlso have a look at this relevant Linux Mint forum thread about AMD graphics. Users there seem to have had some luck with automatic switching.\n\nA: It's also possible with the open source driver for Ubuntu. There you can switch the graphics cards with vga_switcheroo. \nMore information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics\n", "Q: Complete failure of any NVIDIA drivers to work on Sager NP9150 / Clevo P150EM with GTX 670MX on 12.10 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow well do laptops with Nvidia Optimus work? \n\nI have tried every possible solution in my knowledge to install NVIDIA drivers that are functional on Ubuntu 12.10. \nI define functional as the following:\n1) working user interface\n2) ability hibernate / suspend. \nCurrently I can only get the first of the two to work with the free drivers that are installed with the system.

I would like to organize my data on my server but that's impossible with this slow connection.\n\nA: Background\nThe I/O (copy) operation between two different shares does not take place efficiently on the remote side. Instead, all data is being transferred via the client. This is by design of the CIFS/SMB protocol.

AHCI enabled in the BIOS. I have a problem with extremely slow copying in all directions (Samsung->Samsung, WD->WD, WD->Samsung and Samsung->WD).\nLet me describe what I did:\nsudo hdparm -Tt /dev/sda\n\nThe result more or less ok:\nTiming cached reads:   16678 MB in  2.00 seconds = 8358.48 MB/sec\nTiming buffered disk reads: 1362 MB in  3.00 seconds = 453.96 MB/sec\n\nWhen copying by cp or in the midnight commander i was getting transfers only around 1MB/s!\nStarted reading a bit and after disabling the write cache with\nhdparm -W 0 /dev/sda\n\nThe speed reaches the crazy speed of 60MB/s, wchich still is nothing for operation inside the SSD drive.\nBoth drives are connected to SATA 3 sockets in the motherboard. FYI: Copying from USB Pendrive goes much faster, so it looks like read speed problem.\nThe problem doesn't occur with Windows. I paste the dmesg below:\n[ 4898.720381] ata1.00: configured for UDMA/133 [ 4898.720387] ata1: EH complete \n[ 4898.720509] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Write cache: disabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA \n[ 4983.122199] ata2.00: configured for UDMA/133 \n[ 4983.122205] ata2: EH complete \n[4983.122315] sd 1:0:0:0: [sdb] Write cache: disabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA\n\nDo you have any ideas what may be wrong?\n\nA: It looks like your partitions are not aligned to the erase block boundary in the case of SSD, and to the sector boundary in the case of HDD. This is why the problem manifests when copying, which involves writing to one of the drives, but not when just reading from the drive.\nWD Caviar HDDs have 4096 byte sectors, but expose 512 byte sectors to the BIOS to increase \"compatibility\". The default partitioning in Ubuntu will not align the partitions to 8 sectors, which will cause every write to be translated by the drive's 512 byte sector emulation to a read-and-rewrite. This will completely kill the performance.\nSSDs typically have erase page sizes between 128kB and 1024kB. It's best to align the partitions to a multiple of 1024kB.\nTypically fdisk uses a sector size of 512. This means your HDD partitions should start at sectors which are a multiple of 8 and the SSD partitions at sectors which are a multiple of 2048. Note that on you boot drive, the first partition should be at least 64kB from the start of the drive, so that the GRUB boot image can fit between the MBR and the first partition.\nTo sum up, you need to repartition and reformat your drives. Use fdisk -u /dev/sda from a LiveCD to set up partitions which start at multiples of 2048 sectors. After setting up the partitions, you can use Ubuntu's installer to format them.\n", "Q: How are partitons handled in Ubuntu, compared to Windows? How are partitions in my hard disk handled in Ubuntu? I want to draw parallels with what Windows does.\nLet's say I have a HDD formatted as ext4, if I create 2 partitions and mount them at /data-part and /movies, have I created 2 partitions like D:/ and E:/? \n\nA: First off, let's correct a little misconception:\n\nLet's say I have a HDD formatted as ext4, if I create 2 partitions...\n\nYou don't format a hard disk to a file system like ext4 or NTFS or FAT32, you format partitions to those file systems. When people say they've formatted a hard disk to ext4, they generally mean they've created a single partition covering the entire disk, and created an ext4 file system for that partition.\n\nIn Windows, partitions are each assigned a different drive letter (C:, D:, etc). This makes it easier to discover which files are placed in which partitions. A hard disk can have several partitions, and a computer can have several hard disks and other storage devices. The downside is that you can't easily put different directories in different partitions, you can't put C:\\Windows in one partition and C:\\Users in other for example, they both must be in the C: partition.\nIn Linux, everything is a file, and it is all found under the root directory, /. A partition can be mounted to any directory under /. For example, you could mount one partition to /home, another to /var, and another to /, which would contain all the other files, but not ones in home or var.\nIn Linux, even devices and running processes are files. For example, under /proc, you will find all the running processes, and under /dev/, all the connected devices. Hard disks are typically named /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sbc, etc. Partitions with hard disks are typically named /dev/sda1: sda represents the hard drive, and 1 represents the number of the partition within that hard drive. Every partition is then mounted to a directory in your file system. For example, your CD-ROM drive /dev/cdrom0 could be mounted to /media/cdrom0. In your file explorer, you would navigate to /media/cdrom0 to see the CD's files.\nWhile this makes conceptually more difficult than Windows' system, it is much more flexible, as you can assign any directory to a new partition.\n", "Q: I can not access phpmyadmin after installing Lampp(XAMPP for Linux 1.8.1) on Ubuntu 12.04 Im seeing this error while trying to open phpmyadmin (http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin) :\n`New XAMPP security concept:\n\n Access to the requested object is only available from the local network.\n This setting can be configured in the file \"httpd-xampp.conf\".\n\n If you think this is a server error, please contact the webmaster.\n\n Error 403\n xser.com\n Apache/2.4.3 (Unix) OpenSSL/1.0.1c PHP/5.4.7`\n\nEdit: \nI have commented out this code in  \"httpd-xampp.conf\"., but it has introduced a new problem.\n# New XAMPP security concept\n#\n<LocationMatch \"^/(?i:(?:xampp|security|licenses|phpmyadmin|webalizer|#server-status|server-info))\">\n    Order deny,allow\n    Deny from all\n    Allow from ::1 127.0.0.0/8 \\\n        fc00::/7 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16 \\\n        fe80::/10 169.254.0.0/16\n\n    ErrorDocument 403 /error/XAMPP_FORBIDDEN.html.var\n</LocationMatch>\n\nNow Im seeing this --\nAccess forbidden!\n\nYou don't have permission to access the requested directory.

I will back up all my files onto a external drive, but I just wanted to check that in theory if nothing  went wrong during installation then my files like word docs and downloads should still be on my computer, am i correct in my thinking here? Because as i remember when i upgraded from 10.04 to 12.04 (32 bit) everything stayed the same, docs, downloads etc\n\nA: When you do an upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04 everything was there because the OS was just upgraded. (partitions didn't get formatted) Now however , you are doing a fresh install which means your partition gets formatted. This means your data won't be there after install. (unless you have a seperate /home partition in which case you can select it and choose the option to not format it and then your data will be there).\nIf you only have 1 partition , or your home folder is on the same partition as / , then you will loose it as / have to be formatted during re-install. So make sure you backup your whole /home folder.\nThis is the reason why most of us choose to have a separate partition for /home.\n", "Q: How can I change the mount point of an external hard drive My external HDD currently automatically mounts at a certain name, let's say /media/500GB hard drive.

If they don't, it might just be your monitors.\nIf the monitors work but the card isn't working, it may be a defect with the card, or an alternate setup may be required.\n\nIf the (newly installed) drivers weren't working:\nHit Ctrl + Alt + F1\nYou will be shown a terminal. Log in using your username and password.\nStop whatever display manager you're using:\n\n\n*\n\n*LightDM (Default): sudo service lightdm stop\n\n*GDM (GNOME): sudo service gdm stop\n\n*KDM (KDE Plasma Workspaces): sudo service kdm stop\n\n*Any other display manager (custom/other desktop environments): sudo service [display manager name] stop\n\nThen, uninstall the nvidia drivers:\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-current nvidia-current-updates\nOnce this is finished, reinstall the nvidia drivers as shown at the top of the post.\nRestart the computer:\nsudo reboot now\n\nDid it work out in the end?\nIf all of the above doesn't solve the problem, tell us what didn't work.\nIf it did work, mark the solution, and upvote it.\n\nA: Since you have an Nvidia Geforce 600 Series card, please go here How do I install the Nvidia drivers?\nThe solution as I wrote there is using either the 313 or 319 drivers (Recommend using the 319 which came out yesterday). Basically the part you need to read (I actually recommend reading the whole guide I made) is this:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nThis would add the Xorg Edgers PPA to your system.\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThis would update the system and make sure your system knows of the packages provided by the added PPA.\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThis would update the system taking into consideration any packages the PPA offers.\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-319\n\nThat should leave you with the latest version of Nvidia and with support for the 600 Series cards.\n", "Q: Run diff on symlinks I have two folders containing a number of broken symlinks.\nIs there a way to make diff compare the target of the links instead of trying to follow the links?\n\nA: With 'content of the links' I assume you mean 'target of the link'. If that's correct, then yes, there is. Sort of. And you have to get creatie with shell redirection :)\ndiff -u \\\n<(cd /path/to/dir1 && find . -type l -exec stat '{}' '+' | grep 'File:' | sort) \\\n<(cd /path/to/dir2 && find . -type l -exec stat '{}' '+' | grep 'File:' | sort)\n\nWhat this does is run diff with as input the output of two commands:\ncd /path/to/dir1 && find . -type l -exec stat '{}' '+' | grep 'File:' | sort\ncd /path/to/dir2 && find . -type l -exec stat '{}' '+' | grep 'File:' | sort\n\nThese find | grep | sort commands display the name and target of all symlinks it can find in dir1 and dir2, together with their targets. So the net result is that you'll see which symlinks are different.\n(Edited from the original answer, which included the full path to the filename in the output of ls, and therefore showed every file as different. Worked around this by using cd first. Also if the symlinks had different dates and times, diff would show them as different too. Worked around that by using stat to extract the information that we actually want.)\n", "Q: How to run the Savage 2 after install?

If it is not, can you recommend any program to use in my ubuntu?\n\nA: /dev/ttyACM0 sounds like a serial device. You can use a terminal emulator program to speak to a serial device.\nFor example, the screen program has this functionality built in. You can connect to a serial device at 115200 bps using the command screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200. You manual should tell you the speed you need to use on your device; 9600 bps is another common speed. You may need to install screen first using the command sudo apt-get install screen. To close screen when you're done, press Ctrl-a, release, and then press k.\nPresumably you would then press buttons on your keyboard and see data appear in the terminal emulator window.\n", "Q: PC freezes after long period of inactivity (~> 30 min) My Ubuntu system is configured to turn off the screen and lock itself after 10 minutes of inactivity.

Hence my question above.\nOne avenue I explored was to start a kernel thread from the driver, I then implemented a semaphore to prevent any race conditions arising from concurrent read/writes to the same address space. I hoped that a child thread would be able to access the same area of memory.\nUnfortunately this has not worked as I expected. I would appreciate any suggestions. \n\nA: I supose you intend to implement another kernel module as you think it is easier to share data between kernel modules. But perhaps it is not a good choice. If it is possible to 'profile the noise' in user space, I think a better solution is to implement the 'profiler' in user space.\nIn this solution, the user space profiler reads data, performe some calculations, and than submit the result.\nIf this solution is ok, the implementation is as follows.\nIn the kernel module, it is just to register a char device in '/proc' and implement 'read' and 'write' primitives. In user space, is just to implement the profiler, reading and writing to the char device. Details and information for this implementation is all here.\n", "Q: Steam Counter Strike 1.6 Linux beta with optimus (optirun/primusrun) I was able to run Sam 3 on nvidia card before.

In your case this seems not to be readable.

My optimal screen resolution is 1600x900px, however when I first turn on my laptop, grub2 displays at 1024x768. I have an optimus system, so I am assuming that grub is using the intel card. When I do vbeinfo it says the maximum resolution is 1024x768, but the optimal resolution is 1600x900. I have tried adding i915.modeset=1 to my grub config and changing GRUB_GFXMODE to 1600x900 but to no avail. All help would be appreciated!\n\nA: There's no guarantee that GRUB will be able to use exactly the same resolution your Xserver is running at with your video hardware. The only way to find out what settings will be acceptable here is to use GRUB to tell you.\nTo find out, boot your computer and press your C key from your GRUB Menu to switch into command-line mode. \n\n\n*\n\n*To prevent text from scrolling up the screen uncontrollably, first use the command set pager=1. \n\n*Then you can run the vbeinfo command for a list of resolutions your hardware can support. \n\n*Write the numbers down on a piece of scrap paper if you need to.\n\n\nNow, let see how you can change change GRUB menu resolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your /etc/default/grub file with a text editor and change your settings there: gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub.\n\n*Alter the numbers after where it says\"GRUB_GFXMODE=\" with a suitable resolution for your hardware.\n\n*Save the file before closing it.\n\n*Run sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg to write the changes to your grub.cfg.\n\n*Reboot and see if it worked.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 restarts unexpectedly and runs very slow I am new to Ubuntu and have installed Ubuntu 12.10. I have first time tried OS other than Windows.\nI have\nProcessor: Genuine Intel® CPU T2250 @ 1.73GHz × 2\nRam: 2.0 GB\nGraphics: Intel® 945GM x86/MMX/SSE2\nHDD: 155 GB\nAvailable Disk: 92.1 GB\nOS Type: 32 bit\nMy laptop is very slow and restarts unexpectedly. Whenever I try to open any folder, file or application, it take quiet a long time to open....\nPlease help..\n\nA: Your question is two-fold, I'm answering one part here: \"my laptop  is very slow\". The sudden restarts should be asked in a different question.\nYour hardware is relatively old and low-specced for this recent Ubuntu release. More specifically, you're probably hitting the slowness of Unity 3D. Since the 12.10 release the Unity 2D, meant for these devices, was removed. More on that topic is in this OMG!Ubuntu! article.\nFrom here I believe you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try one of the official derivatives of Ubuntu with a different desktop environment: Lubuntu (LXDE powered), Kubuntu (KDE powered), Xubuntu (XFCE powered). These are not using Unity and your desktop will look completely different.\nThere's no need to reinstall the current Ubuntu installation! Just install the lubuntu-desktop / kubuntu-desktop / xubuntu-desktop metapackage (for Lubuntu / Kubuntu / Xubuntu respectively - pick one) and you'll be able to choose the desktop environment to run at the login screen.\nWhile KDE isn't as lightweight as XFCE and LXDE, I think it runs pretty well on older hardware with 2GB memory by installing the kubuntu-low-fat-settings package.\n\n*Install Ubuntu 12.04 with proper Unity 2D support. It's an LTS release (5 years support), so I'd recommend this if you only want to put effort in getting it to run once.\n\n", "Q: How do I obtain the offical Ubuntu patched kernel source without using git? I'm needing to custom compile a kernel to enable some very specific hardware features that are not on by default and have to be compiled in.  I started following this guide but it seems to be slightly outdated for 12.04 onwards as some commands fail with missing source packages.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile\nWhat is the easiest way to rebuild the current kernel source so I can tweak the options I need?\n\nA: These steps are very general and apply to every package in Ubuntu/Debian.\n\n\n*\n\n*This will download the source package and applies all Ubuntu patches.\napt-get source linux-image-3.... # select the exact package you want\n\n\n*Install all build dependencies.\nsudo apt-get build-dep linux-image-3...\n\n\n*Enter the directory of the source.\ncd linux-... # change accordingly\n\n\n*Do the changes to the source you need.\n\n*After finishing the edits, add a new version to the changelog (else it's going to complain the source doesn't match):\ndch --local mysuffix\n\n\n*Build it with unsigned changes file and unsigned source package (for local testing):\ndebuild -uc -us\n\nThis will take a while!\n\n*Find the packages one level below:\nls -al ../*.deb\n\n\n*Install them like any other package.\n", "Q: Installing a package works, but then I have to wait for 10

This means that apt won't be able to install/update/configure any other kernels as well. This results in the error you are getting. There are a few ways to deal with this; the easiest would be to run apt-get install linux-image-generic, and see what happens. If this works (I think it should) then follow that up by running apt-get install -f.\nIf you get any more errors in the process post them here.\n\nOkay, it seems that the easiest path won't work. Try running dpkg --unpack linux-image-generic. If you get an error about that there's no such package (which is likely) run \nwget http://ubuntu.secsup.org//pool/main/l/linux-meta/linux-image-generic_2.6.32.45.52_i386.deb and then dpkg -i <path to the package you downloaded>. If there's any error post it here.\n\nYou ran into a dependency-chain problem. You can resolve this by manually downloading and trying to install every package that is mentioned in the errors you get. Eventually you should find the root of the problem and that should cause every other package to be corrected as well. \n\nA: The error message\nFailed to process /etc/kernel/postinst.d at\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-image-2.6.32-41-generic.postinst line 1003.\n\nseems to suggest the the problem is one of the scripts in directory /etc/kernel/postinst.d. The code that tries to run the scripts in that directory reads something along the lines (in the file /var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-image-2.6.32-41-generic.postinst):\nif (-d \"/etc/kernel/postinst.d\") {\n  print STDERR \"Examining /etc/kernel/postinst.d.\\n\";\n  system (\"run-parts --verbose --exit-on-error --arg=$version \" .\n          \"--arg=$realimageloc$kimage-$version \" .\n          \"/etc/kernel/postinst.d\") &&\n            die \"Failed to process /etc/kernel/postinst.d\";\n}\n\nViewing some of the lines before the above error message you can figure out that the culprit is the dkms package:\nExamining /etc/kernel/postinst.d.\nrun-parts: executing /etc/kernel/postinst.d/dkms 2.6.32-41-generic /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-41-generic\nrun-parts: failed to exec /etc/kernel/postinst.d/dkms: Exec format error\nrun-parts: /etc/kernel/postinst.d/dkms exited with return code 1\n\nThe Exec format error suggests that the file /etc/kernel/postinst.d/dkms is trying to run a binary compiled for incorrect CPU arch (e.g. you have 32 bit host and you're trying to run 64 bit binary file). The error Exec format error means that the kernel is not able to figure out how an executable (any file with the executable bit set) should be executed.\nIn my experience, if dkms is causing you trouble, the correct fix is to do sudo apt-get purge dkms && sudo apt-get install dkms. That is, totally remove dkms from the system and reinstall it again.\n", "Q: Need symbols for libopenal1 package We've got some crashes in libopenal.so.1.13.0 and unfortunately this package was built without symbols. I've tried downloading libopenal1-dbgsym (appending -dbgsym works for most packages once the ddebs repositories are configured) but there is no -dbgsym package available for libopenal1. Apparently the package was built in a way that doesn't work well with pkg-create-dbgsym.\nWho should I talk to about getting this corrected? Canonical? The developers of libopenal1? We could try building libopenal1 from source and distributing our version with symbols but that doesn't seem like an ideal solution.\n\nA: The building of ddebs is down to the build system and the Debian packaging.\nThe openal-soft source package is in universe so is community maintained. If this is fixed in Ubuntu, then it would primarily fall to the MOTU team. Any fix would best be forwarded up Debian as well, since ddebs apply to Debian too. In Debian, the appropriate person is the maintainer of the openal-soft package.\nYou should check for existing bugs in both Debian BTS and Launchpad, file bugs as appropriate, and link Launchpad bugs to any corresponding Debian bug.\nProviding a suitable patch directly to the Debian maintainer in a bug filed in the Debian BTS is the easiest way to get something like this fixed. Then the change will eventually arrive in Ubuntu, or you can ask MOTU to merge any fix from Debian in the meantime.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu One delete or restore files in the cloud after formatting my PC? One of PCs the Windows is having typically Windows issues and needs a reformat. I have my documents, pictures, music files etc syncing across Ubuntu One to access on Smartphone and my Ubuntu dedicated PC. \nWhen I have reformatted PC, and install Ubuntu One. What will happen? \nWill it sync my files to the PC, or will it delete the files and synchronize that there is nothing in the documents, music and picture folders.\n\nA: the goal of cloud services like dropbox, ubuntu one, ... is to prevent you from loosing data.so if you have uploaded your data in ubuntu one, it wouldn't loose your data because they are stored in canonical data centers.\n\nA: Your files will not be deleted from the cloud. Obviously they are gone from the HD, but when you reinstall the Ubuntu One client, you can choose to sync the folders again to get them locally.\nUbuntu One will only delete the files in the cloud if you specifically go to the folder and choose delete while the client is running. By reformatting I assume you are doing it from a Windows cd or Ubuntu cd, and therefor the client won't be running, hence no deleted files.\n", "Q: unity greeter not showing selector i have installed gnome3.7 from gnome3 ppa\n\nand i have removed evolution using sudo apt-get remove evolution*\nand accidentally it removed gnome, gnome-shell and bunch of other things\n\nand now when i restart and log in it says failed to load sessioon \"gnome\"\nand unity greeter is not showing desktop environment selector?\ni have cinnamon, unity, installed?\ni went in to recovery mode edited lightdm conf file and set session to ubuntu but still it is logging into gnome instead of unity\nhow i can fix this \n\nA: You have 2 options: either remove gnome compleately or reinstall it's missing parts.\nFor removing gnome you will need to know what's left of it on your system (usually apt-get autoremove will take care of that).\nReinstalling gnome only requires that you apt-get install gnome3. This will reinstall everything needed to get gnome working again.\n\nNote: gnome3 is a meta-package, this is so to make installation of gnome easier. This sadly also means that if you remove parts of it it will think that you want to remove all of gnome, so by using gnome you either have a ton of stuff that you'll never use or you don't use gnome at all. Sadly there's no middle path. (Actually there is, but it's major pain.)\n", "Q: how can i mount partitons in recovery mode I am unable to login to my account and I want to back up my data from Documents folder\nso I need to know how to mount other partitions from recovery mode.  How can I do this? \nmv /home/username/Documents /to_my_other_partitons\n\n\nA: There is a current bug with Recovery Mode. Please vote for the bug (click the green writing at the top left of that page).\nThe solution is to enter the following two commands as soon as you enter Recovery Mode:\nmount --options remount,rw /\nmount --all\n\nThis will allow you to continue normally.\n\nA: mount <what to mount> <where to mount>. Usually this looks something like mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt. You can also specify a lot of options, which you most probably won't need. Also mounting this way requires root privileges (eg. sudo).\n", "Q: Why does LIBVA return an error while trying to init Intel GM965 driver?

But have all the same result as at the beginning of the post.\nupdate: after some research i have found that there is a non-zero possibility that VAAPI doesn't support GM965 (X3100) chipset. Is it really so?\n\nA: I should say that answer as simple as sad: from this 01.org link and this wikipedia link I knew that my GM965 chipset in particular isn't supported by VA-API.\n\nA: https://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads/2013/2013q1-intel-graphics-stack-release\nApparently it is supported now but I guess we will need to either find a PPA or wait for them to hit the repos as it would be too much effort to get going and certainly keep going really.\n", "Q: Getting ubuntu 12.10 and windows 8 to work correctly dualboot. Configuring GRUB There may be several questions on similar lines. But this one is a bit different. My Windows8 installation had stopped working earlier after installing Ubuntu 12.10, (standard : cannot find drivemap error), to fix this I installed boot repair from Ubuntu, ran it, rebooted, and tried the various windows options from the grub menu, NONE of them worked, as a result, I got into BIOS and moved up the Windows 8 option and booted directly into Windows, which got Windows to work, but now I cant access the grub loader as computer boots directly to Windows 8 leaving my Ubuntu inaccessible, any thoughts on how I could modify the GRUB,so that it contains the working windows 8 and Ubuntu installations, would be appreciated.\nThanks!\n\nA: It's not 100% clear to me how your system is installed. My suspicion is that you've got a BIOS/legacy-mode Ubuntu install and an EFI-mode Windows install. It could be that something else is going on, though. Running the Boot Info Script and posting a link to the RESULTS.txt file that it produces will give us details about how everything's set up, which would help in proceeding without guesswork.\nThat said, and proceeding on my initial guess, you could try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reconfigure your boot order to boot Linux.\n\n*In Linux, type sudo parted -l and look for a FAT partition with a \"boot\" flag set. If I'm right, this is your EFI System Partition (ESP). If you're not certain you've found an ESP, stop here and post that Boot Info Script output.\n\n*Mount your ESP at /boot/efi, as in sudo mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi if your ESP is /dev/sda1. (You may need to create this mount point first, as in sudo mkdir /boot/efi.)\n\n*Back up your ESP. Copying its files to a convenient location or creating a tarball of the /boot/efi directory should do the trick.\n\n*Download the Debian-package version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Install the rEFInd package. Double-clicking it in a file manager may do the trick, or you could type sudo dpkg -i refind_0.6.6-1_amd64.deb (adjusting the filename as necessary if I release a new version before you read this).\n\n\nWith any luck, when you reboot you should see rEFInd, which should enable you to boot either Windows or Ubuntu without the help of GRUB. In a worst-case scenario, the computer won't boot any longer, which is why I had you make a backup of your ESP -- you should be able to use an emergency disc to restore everything to get it booting again.\n", "Q: Steam crash on playonlinux I'm trying to install steam using playonlinux/wine.

I am using gtkmm-2.4 for my Ubuntu apps and to determine the size of the window for the application I use get_desktop_geometry. This returns the dimensions of the display you ask for. My issue is that when I use these dimensions to size my window, the window is slightly too big because I didn't account for the unity launcher (on the side) and the unity panel (across the top).\nHas anyone encountered this issue? Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I believe it doesn't need calculating since it's always 25 px. The panel cannot be resized so far and I can't find its size either but whenever I need the value I input 25 which doesn't vary even on different resolutions. It's a terrible job on the end of Unity but there's not much to be done about it except go through the source code.\nEDIT: The size of the launcher is the size of the icons (from 32 to 64 and default is 48) which is returned by gconftool --get /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/icon_size + 14 px.\n", "Q: How can I check if my computer has AES-NI support?

The only reason for their existence is to ease the user in installing a set of packages by just setting dependencies.\nBy looking at the dependencies of these you can see that -extras is depending on -addons, thus making the former an extension on the latter.\nThe description of both packages (apt-cache show ubuntu-restricted-addons):\n\nCommonly used restricted packages for Ubuntu\nThis package depends on some commonly used packages in the Ubuntu\n  universe and multiverse repositories.\nYou should not install this package directly, but instead install the\n  ubuntu-restricted-extras package.\n\napt-cache show ubuntu-restricted-extras:\n\nCommonly used restricted packages for Ubuntu\nThis package depends on some commonly used packages in the Ubuntu\n  multiverse repository.\nInstalling this package will pull in support for MP3 playback and\n  decoding, support for various other audio formats (GStreamer plugins),\n  Microsoft fonts, Flash plugin, LAME (to create compressed audio\n  files), and DVD playback.\nPlease note that this does not install libdvdcss2, and will not let\n  you play encrypted DVDs.

See\n  http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/licensing for more information.\n\nNow that mystery is solved, let's see what the differences are on the Ubuntu derivative part.\n\nubuntu- vs kubuntu- vs lubuntu- vs xubuntu-\nThis just depends on what the derivatives have decided on to ship and recommend. Sometimes this includes Desktop Environment specific packages. Some examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*The dependency on libk3b6-extracodecs in kubuntu-restricted-addons is only valid for KDE as this package is for K3b (KDE disc burning application) only.\n\n*The lubuntu set appears to contain a lot less dependencies and especially excluding the gstreamer codecs. This may indicate that LXDE's default player is not GStreamer based, and it's sane not to install all kinds of GStreamer libraries probably not being used in a Lubuntu installation.\n\n", "Q: GPT table error when trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 64 I am trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 64b on dual-boot with preinstalled W8.\nI already burnt a bootable USB with ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64 and configured my BIOS (EFI, secure boot disabled) to boot from there.\nI can boot from USB and test Ubuntu from the pendrive but Gparted shows the following error:\n\nbackup GPT table not at the end of the disk.

If the latter, just ignore the error and proceed with the installation; it's not really important. If it's in reference to the hard disk, though, there are two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your disk may be damaged, in which case using the \"fix\" option is likely to do as the name implies; however, I can't be sure without seeing more details. If you want more advice, try running gdisk, typing p and v from its main menu, and posting the results here. (You'll need to either install gdisk manually or run it from an emergency system like Parted Magic or System Rescue CD.)\n\n*You may be running into inconsistencies because the disk was prepared with motherboard-based software RAID (aka \"fake RAID\" and various other names) enabled and Linux isn't using that feature, or possibly vice-versa. If this is the case, you'll need to decide whether or not you want to use that type of RAID and set up all your OSes and your firmware to treat the disk consistently. The details depend on how you want to proceed. Once this is set up consistently, either parted will stop complaining or you can use the \"fix\" option to fix the inconsistency.\n\n\nThe second possibility is more likely, particularly on a new computer.

From help.ubuntu.com/community/WakeOnLan\n\nIn order to use WoL it must be supported and enabled as necessary in the BIOS, NIC and other network hardware (routers, switches etc). You may also need to configure some software if things don't work out-of-the-box.\n\nDoes this mean that I must have WoL enabled in all 3 items or just one of them?\nMy question is because the NIC says:\nSupports Wake-on: pumbg\nWake-on: g\n\nWhich, means that WoL is present and enabled. However, there is no option in the BIOS (it's a eeeBox 1503) to enable WoL. Actually, it loads a simple UEFI, not exactly the BIOS, so that is probably why I don't see any advanced option.\nThe router supports WakeOnLan. So, the BIOS is the only item I can't enable it. Will I need to find a way to enable it there, or having it enabled on the NIC is enough?\nEDIT\nIt was not working because I was trying to power up when the machine is completely off and not wake up from sleep/suspend mode. I want to power up, but I'm not sure if this is possible.\nThe answer provided by psusi answers my question. Using ethtool to enable WoL is enough.\n\nA: When you have your PC off, and the network cable plugged into it, do you see activity on the network port? i.e. flashing green or amber lights?

You can fix this using the mid3v2 tool from the mutagen package to remove the tag (apparently its optional):\n$ mid3v2 --delete-frames=TLEN filename.mp3\n\nThe music player Quodlibet also has a convenient \"Fix MP3 Duration\" plugin you can use to do this.\n(Taken from the Quodlibet FAQ: http://quodlibet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/faq.html)\n\nA: If you don't want to install anything new, try with ffmpeg:\nffmpeg -i file_orig.mp3 -acodec copy file_fixed.mp3\n\n\nA: mp3check worked perfect for me also with wildcards.\nsudo apt-get install mp3check\n\nmp3check {filename or wildcard} --cut-junk-start --cut-junk-end --fix-headers\n\n", "Q: Humble Bundle Closure Game: controls problem When I start the Closure game the character keeps moving to the left as if I was pressing the left key on the keyboard.

You need to use another program.\nThird and last step : write into the /dev/rfcomm0\nThere are several ways to write on the file, but note that all ways to proceed involve root. I describe here several programs that can do that (so that you can choose depending on your need or on what is installed on your system for example). If you forget to run the program as root, you may have an error :\nstty: /dev/rfcomm0: Device or resource busy\n\nFirst option : connect using screen\nScreen is a very powerfull tool. You can install it (it's always usefull anymore) by using :\nsudo apt-get install screen\n\nand then run\nsudo screen /dev/rfcomm0\n\nIf you forget to run it as root, you will get an error like Aleksander got :\n[screen is terminating]\n\nTo quit it, type \"(CTRL + A) + :quit\"\nSecond option : connect using minicom\nInstall it\nsudo apt-get install minicom\n\nand then run\nsudo minicom -D /dev/rfcomm0\n\nIf you forget to run it as root, you will have an error like\nminicom: cannot open /dev/rfcomm0: Device or resource busy\n\nTo quit it, type \"Ctrl + A X\".\nThird option : python script miniterm\nDownload this script, and run :\nchmod +x miniterm.py\nsudo ./miniterm.py /dev/rfcomm0\n\nWrite directly into the file\nFirstly run the following command (9600 is the baud rate) :\nsudo stty -F /dev/rfcomm0 cs8 9600 ignbrk -brkint -icrnl -imaxbel -opost -onlcr -isig -icanon -iexten -echo -echoe -echok -echoctl -echoke noflsh -ixon -crtscts \n\nNow you can write in this file like in a classic file :\nsudo su -c \"echo 'message' > /dev/rfcomm0\"\n\nand in theory read from it using\nsudo tail -f /dev/rfcomm0\n\nBut I don't know read does not work, if any of you have an idea...\n\nA: 1) Use hcitool scan to find the Mac address of the device. \nThe device should be set to slave mode with a known pin.

I want any instances of EITHER of these programs to be grouped under the same Unity icon.\nI have created a .desktop file to try and accomplish this but don't exactly know how to go about it. The desktop file is as follows:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nName=Android Virtual Device\nIcon=/home/ben/.icons/android.svg\nExec=/home/ben/usr/bin/android avd\nStartupWMClass=Android Virtual Device Manager\n\nFrom what I understand, StartupWMClass is what I need to set to achieve this correctly. I have obtained the two class names ('Android Virtual Device Manager' and 'emulator64-arm') using xprop WM_CLASS on the repsective windows. Both work individually (the launcher icon is correctly attached to the program no matter what way it is launched), but I cannot get it to work for both.\nI am assuming that I somehow need to set two values for StartupWMClass but have not been able to do it correctly (or know if it is a valid operation). I have tried, colon separated like environment variables, comma separated, quotes, etc and I cannot find any hints in the official documentation.\nAny suggestions?\nEDIT:\nAnother, more pedantic, but probably more identifiable example is with Matlab. I am running 2013a and the splash screen that initially shows and the program have completely different WM_CLASS values. This means, when I click my launcher with StartupWMClass=com-mathworks-util-PostVMInit in it, the splash screen comes up with a different (default Unknown) Unity icon, while the rest comes up grouped under my launcher.\nBy using xprop WMCLASS and clicking on first the splash screen, then repeating with an active Matlab session I get the following terminal output:\nben@ben-OptiPlex-9010:~$ xprop WM_CLASS\nWM_CLASS(STRING) = \"MATLAB\", \"MATLAB\"\nben@ben-OptiPlex-9010:~$ xprop WM_CLASS\nWM_CLASS(STRING) = \"sun-awt-X11-XFramePeer\", \"com-mathworks-util-PostVMInit\"\n\nIf I could specify something along the lines of:\nStartupWMClass=com-mathworks-util-PostVMInit&&MATLAB\n\nThat would work perfectly (as both work separately) but I have no idea of the syntax, if it even exists. I just know nothing I have tried has worked thus far.\nAny help or a definitive answer either way would be great as I believe this is a pretty fundamental element of a well functioning desktop.\n\nA: Same problem for me with Starcraft II launched throw playonlinux. There is first a application launcher:\n\n\n*\n\n*(WM_CLASS(STRING) = \"Blizzard Launcher.exe\", \"Wine\")\nand then the game itself:\n\n*(WM_CLASS(STRING) = \"SC2.exe\", \"Wine\")\nI guess that wine is setting the class with the binary executable.\nI had a look in bamf code (bamf_matcher.c, insert_desktop_file_class_into_table() method):\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a map that make the association between a desktop file and one and only one class,\n\n*The key StartupWMClass is read with g_key_file_get_string() which is not designed to return a list of strings,\n\n*g_key_file_get_string_list() could do that but bamf developpers did not design the framework to be able to associate multiple classes to one single desktop file.\n\n\nIn my case I cheat by creating 2 desktop files with same keys but StartupWMClass. This is not perfect because I still have 2 Uniy icons when in the launcher but the important thing is I know why :-).\n\nA: I know this question is really old, but after going through the same problem, i think i've finally created a workaround for this, and decided to share with anyone having this issue:\nAs we can't set multiple WMClasses for a single .desktop file, why don't set all the windows to a single WMClass?\nWe can do something like this (Obviously, replace Window 1, Window 2 and potatoes with your windows names and desired WMClass):\nxprop -name \"Window 1\" -f WM_CLASS 8s -set WM_CLASS \"potatoes\"\n\nxprop -name \"Window 2\" -f WM_CLASS 8s -set WM_CLASS \"potatoes\"\n\nAnd on the .desktop file we can do this: StartupWMClass=potatoes\nTadam! All windows are grouped now.\nBut hey, are we doing this manually every time the program opens up? Of course not.\nWe can just go and make a bash script that automagically does that every half second:\nwhile true\ndo\n    xprop -name \"Window 1\" -f WM_CLASS 8s -set WM_CLASS \"potatoes\"\n    xprop -name \"Window 2\" -f WM_CLASS 8s -set WM_CLASS \"potatoes\"\n    sleep 0.5\ndone\n\nAnd finally, set the .sh we created to run every time the OS starts up: \nHope my answer is helpful to anyone browsing this question.\n", "Q: How to disable 3 finger drag on macbook air trackpad. I'm a novice with command line So I read the other answer for this question but I really was hoping to get a more basic explanation that would make sense to an ubuntu novice.\nI am running 12.10 on a 2011 macbook air and love it generally but three finger drag activating whenever I try to re-size a window is driving me completely insane. There seems to be a way to disable it, How can I disable the multitouch gestures in Ubuntu? but I lost the last contributor's advice at \"...create a shell script\" and the other answers didn't seem to work.\nwrt my familiarity with the command line I understand generally how to add repositories and update installed packages. Kind of. That's about it. \nAny help for a noob here would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: In the post you're quoting, the right way of doing things is to use synclient. \nThe command line posted in How can I disable the multitouch gestures in Ubuntu? should do the trick. If you want to test it, just execute this line in a terminal : \nsynclient ClickFinger3=2 && synclient TapButton3=2\n\nIf the behaviour is OK with these parameters, you have to execute this piece of code at each system startup. This is done easily. First, create a text file that you can name touchpad.sh for instance. Inside, you put this code : \n #!/bin/sh\n sleep 10;\n synclient ClickFinger3=2;\n synclient TapButton3=2;\n\nThe sleep command is to delay the call of synclient. If it's called too early in the startup process it will have no effect. Try larger numbers than 10 if this doesn't work.\nThen, you must grant execution rights to this script and execute it at each boot.

What are the connectivity options on the peer computers that need to connect via the share? \nBasically, on the computer that will be connected to the Internet, you have to edit the LAN connection and select the IPv4 Settings method - \"Shared to other computers\" and also check \"Available to all users\". See below image. \n\nNow, as soon as you hookup the peer computer to the above LAN connection, Internet is available. \n", "Q: Does enabling ACLs have an effect on performance? I'm looking at a web application that needs ACLs enabled. Are there any benchmarks or other documents to show what potential impact ACL does{n't} have when the file system is under heavy load?\nAlso, does it matter what filesystem you use with ACLs?\n\nA: I got stuck with a similar question and found this Usenix article which has a section EA and ACL Performance discussing a comparison of time taken with and without ACLs. Also compares this for different file systems, which shows interestingly that XFS-512(inode size) and JFS do not cause a performance impact.\nSo definitely the ACLs cause a performance degradation depending on the file system type but it also depends on your production load, server resource and how much overhead is acceptable.\n", "Q: Very High CPU usage on HP dv7 Laptop when IDLE I'm pretty new to Linux computing. So I finally thought of giving Ubuntu a try, by dualbooting it with Windows 8 on my hp dv7-6006tx laptop. Laptop Specs\nBut after installation, I immediately realised that the fan of the Laptop is spinning very hard and there's a considerable amount of heat underneath, when the laptop was on idle, IE NOTHING RUNNING. - this rarely occurs when running Windows (Unless I'm rendering or encoding movies). \nSo I'm not sure if this is maybe an incompatibility issue, or if I just need the latest driver software and that things? What also concerned me was how quickly it drained my battery. It didn't even last 30mins, where I can use it for over 2 hours on Windows.\nPlease advice me, as despite of this issue, I'm really enjoying Ubuntu and would love to make further use of it!  :-)\nThanks!\n\nA: there has been several questions about this topic. it seems to be a popular problem and there are some solutions for it. check these answers:  \nGnome 3 Ati Fan always on\nOpenSource ATI driver - Fan running at full speed all the time\n", "Q: how to color each new command in terminal?

I thought about colors, but, I have no idea what to do or how to configure the terminal?\nIs there another terminal which support colors, bold, or may be italic .. ?? \n\nA: To color each new command in terminal, you've to edit ~/.bashrc file.\nTo do this,\ngedit ~/.bashrc\n\nUncomment the line\n# force_color_prompt=yes\n\nto\nforce_color_prompt=yes\n\nThen, You can restart the terminal or do\n. ~/.bashrc\n\n", "Q: How can I free space on a Ubuntu Usb drive? I'm very new in the Ubuntu family (I downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 LTS , just 2 days ago, I must learn Linux for college).\nSecond of all, English is not my native language, but I'll try to be as clear as possible).\nI installed Ubuntu on a 1 GB flash drive using Universal USB Installer, following the instructions on the Ubuntu.com. It worked just fine.\nSo i started using the Terminal, to learn about commands, and I edited a text file, a few times, and after a few hours when I tried to save the text file again it displayed me the \" low disk space ..\" message.\nI think it also stored the Firefox history/cache.\nAnyway, my question is, how can I clear the space?\nSide note: while using Universal  Usb, it asked me for the size of persistent folders ( or something like that)  and i specified 200 MB, thinking that this is for file storage. Have I done good? Or wrong?\n\nA: *\n\n*I recommend you use at least 2GB or even larger USB stick (1 or 2 GB for persistence) in order to avoid such space problems, and install a program like Bleachbit  to clean cache, etc. from time to time.\n\n*As a temporary solution to the problem with your present USB drive, you can try and delete the contents of a number of your (hidden) folders (which you can see when you press Ctrl+H in Nautilus) in your home folder such as: .cache, .thumbnails, .mozilla, etc.\n\n", "Q: ubuntu server: can't access apache hosted pages after changing ip I moved my server to a different office. Since they wanted to access it, I joined their network by changing my server's IP. The server hosts LAMP + postgres.\nNow I can't get the basic web apps to run. Even pgadmin from my pc to the server won't run. It's all on a LAN?\nWhat could be the issue?\nEg: /phppgadmin\nwon't work. not even that index.html that shows 'it works'.\nMORE INFO:\nI just realised this... When I turn off my firewall with \n\nufw disable\n\nI have no problem. How can I now allow this to work with the firewall on? I remember allowing port 22 but it doesn't seem to have an effect. Maybe something I'm doing wrong.\n\nA: I don't really get WHY this happened... I mean, I WAS using the server without a problem before I took it to the new place and changed its IP.\nAnyway, I allowed port 80 (that was running Apache) and this was the solution to the problem.\nIt is worth mentioning that even before allowing this, I had (and still do) port 22 and 5432 open for PostgreSQL and SSH.\nJust allowing the Apache port did the trick.\nWhat made me do this was, when I disabled the firewall, everything was fine. So this gave me the clue that the firewall was the cause.\nAlso it is worth mentioning that before explicitly allowing port 80, when I tried to connect to PGMyAdmin, it would give me an error about some SSL problem. But this was misleading (at least to me).\nHope someone else finds this useful.\n", "Q: What is hardware enablement (HWE)? I see the linux-hwe-generic package as part of the kernels you can install in Ubuntu.\nWhat is hardware enablement (HWE)?\n\nA: Brand new hardware devices are released to the public always more frequently. And we want such hardware to be always working on Ubuntu, even if it has been released after an Ubuntu release. Six months (the time it takes for a new Ubuntu release to be made) is a very long period in the IT field. Hardware Enablement (HWE) is about that: catching up with the newest hardware technologies.\nNow, how does Ubuntu want to reach the goal of Hardware Enablement? Using rolling releases for the kernel: as soon as a new kernel is released, it is packaged for Ubuntu, tested (via the proposed pocket and special Q/A methodologies), and made available to Ubuntu users. This method has of course some disadvantages: releasing a new kernel too quickly may introduce some bugs and issues, and may not be suitable for the enterprise.\nThe solution? Offering different kernels for different users. Therefore Ubuntu will offer at least two kernels: the General Availability (GA) kernel, i.e. the most stable kernel, which does not get updated to point releases; and the Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel, i.e. the most recent kernel released. This is why you are seeing both the linux-generic and the linux-hwe-generic packages.\nFinally, if you are interested in developing or testing the newest kernel technologies, look at the Ubuntu Hardware Debugging web site.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/RollingLTSEnablementStack\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 and later\nThe 18.04.2 and newer point releases will ship with an updated kernel and X stack by default for the desktop. Server installations will default to the General Availability (GA) kernel and provide the Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel as optional.\nThe 18.04 HWE Stacks will follow a new Rolling Update Model as documented at Ubuntu Rolling LTS Enablement Stack wiki.\nInstalling the HWE stack is simple.\n22.04-23.04\nsudo apt install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-22.04\n\n20.04-22.10\nsudo apt install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-20.04\n\n16.04/18.04\nDesktop\nsudo apt install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-\"`lsb_release -r -s`\" xserver-xorg-hwe-\"`lsb_release -r -s`\" \n\nServer\nsudo apt install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-\"`lsb_release -r -s`\" \n\nSource: revised from Ubuntu LTS Enablemen Stack wiki\n", "Q: Is possible to install Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10 on ACER V5-571-53314G50 ULTRABOOK?

I'm looking for taskbar that works similar to the one found in win7 and it's not unity:)\nDockbarx is very close to what I'm looking for but it does not have ungroup option.\nIs there any gnome applet (or something?) that works like dockbarx but has the ungroup option?\nEDIT\nHow does win7 taskbar works:\nAll open windows are presented as icons. You can add title to these icons but there is no text in default view, just icons - which is fine.\nYou can pin those programs so that they stay on the taskbar even if you close the program.\nIf the program is pinned it behaves like a placeholder for itself. \nFor example if you would like to open firefox, you just lick on the firefox icon and then it brings the current instance of firefox program or run a new instance if firefox is not running.\nSo if I click on the icon, the program is brought back (if it's running) or it's executed (if it's not running).\nDockbarx works exactly like that except it cannot ungroup windows. \nNowadays in the age of webapps lack of this functionality is very big disadvantage. For example I have always opened chrome browser and gmail app (as a chrome app opened on gmail.com) and many other webapps as a chrome apps (command: chrome --app=http://www.example.com). Dockbarx groups them all into one icon because all of those are chrome instances. The author of dockbarx stated plainly that \"ungroup\" functionality will never be implemented in dockbarx so i ask if there is any gnome applet that works just like dockbarx but has ungroup option.\n\nA: AWM allows it.\nRight click to open setting, then click on task manager and then click on group/ungroup option.\nCairo, I haven't found it yet.\nNot being able to work with ungrouped windows made leave unity.\nUngroup windows is a requirement when you really work with linux, when it is not a leisure, like when you use osx to work and then have fun with linux.\nI've lost more than 3 man days to see that there was a stupid will to prevent users from chossing to group or ungroup windows.

Is there anything else I can/should do (maybe similar to running stop juju-jon-sample-file-storage in the previous mentioned post)?\n\nA: dpkg --get-selections should return nothing for packages that are not installed. The fact that it is returning something is a symptom that there are parts of the package that have not been removed.\nIf you try --list instead of --get-selections, you'll see the reason why the package is not fully removed. In your case, you should see rc near mythtv-backend, meaning that there is still Residual Configuration for the package.\nFiles inside /etc are considered configuration files and are not removed automatically when removing a package. To remove residual configuration, you need to purge the package:\napt-get purge mythtv-backend\n\nThis is the correct way of removing all configuration files, including the ones in /etc/init.\n\n", "Q: Uninstall Metasploit problem I had serious problems with Metasploit since I installed it, so I want to uninstall it\nI did try /opt/metasploit-4.5.0/uninstall but it doesn't work \nit shows a yes and no ..

Nothing has any effect.\nTo avoid this problem (which often results in lost data if the lid is accidently closed before a program save) I have to stay with 11.04 even though it is now no longer supported.\nThere seem to be some bug fixes shown for this problem, but they specify non-intel graphics cards.

I found the following bug report in debian which is unsolved until now:\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=669342\nI quickly tested the installation of dracut on a Ubuntu 12.04 server and it installed fine, but I need it for Ubuntu 12.10.\nI already tried to force dpkg to ignore the conflicts, but the result was the same\naptitude -o Dpkg::Options::=\"--force-conflicts\" install dracut\n\nInstalling dracut from source is working, but to include network setup in the initramfs, the package dracut-network is needed which I couldn't find the sources for and even so it's available in Ubuntu 12.10 it depends on the dracut package...\nCan someone help me how to install dracut and maybe share some insides on why it's so hard to use dracut in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The problem here is that Aptitude does not suggest you remove initramfs, because it is considered a core package, and Aptitude never proposes to remove core packages.\nThe only obvious way to work around this problem would be to tell Aptitude to remove initramfs-tools:\naptitude install dracut initramfs-tools-\n\nHowever, if you try this command, you'll see that it triggers other important dependency problems:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n dmsetup : Depends: initramfs-tools but it is not going to be installed.\n console-setup : Depends: initramfs-tools (>= 0.85eubuntu12) but it is not going to be installed.\n linux-image-3.5.0-22-generic : Depends: initramfs-tools (>= 0.36ubuntu6) but it is not going to be installed.\n linux-image-3.5.0-17-generic : Depends: initramfs-tools (>= 0.36ubuntu6) but it is not going to be installed.\n kpartx-boot : Depends: initramfs-tools but it is not going to be installed.\n [...]\n\nAll that packages should actually depend on linux-initramfs-tools (which is a virtual package provided by both initramfs-tools and dracut). This is a bug, and should be reported as such.\nIn short, the only solution is to modify the dependencies of that packages. With the current situation, you cannot install dracut without having broken packages. (Though, if it's OK for you to have broken packages, then you can play with dpkg --force-all, remove initramfs-tools and install dracut.)\n\nA: Thanks to the help from Andrea Corbellini the problem has been identified and is tracked in the bug report Package dracut cannot be installed on Ubuntu 12.10. The underlying issue is tracked in the bug report \nDepend on linux-initramfs-tools. Any help on increasing awareness to the last bug report so that it gets resolved as soon as possible is very much appreciated.\nTogether with the Debian maintainer of the dracut package, we came up with a workaround for installing dracut by removing the conflict to initramfs-tools.

I see a lot of text messages on the screen, the last of which is something like:\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\n/dev/sda7: clean 503648/5873664 files, 16228870/2348972 blocks\n\nAfter that, nothing happens.  In desperation, I hit CTRL+C and see this:\nThe disk drive for / is not ready yet or is not present\n\nWhile this doesn't sound good, after a few seconds Ubuntu boots and I'm able to use it normally.  What's going on here, and how can I get Ubuntu to boot properly without having to go through the recovery mode?\nBelow are some relevant files:\n/etc/fstab:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

I have ordered several virtual machines from a hosting provider, which all need exactly the same setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*same users\n\n*same programs installed\n\n*same config (except for hostname) including cron-jobs\n\n\nIs it possible and save to create a tarball of my entire system, excluding /dev, /proc, /sys folders and the /etc/hostname file and just unpack it on the disk while the system is not running (using a repair mode, or a Live CD, in case of a physical server)? \nWhat else do I have to consider?\nEdit: Since I have no physical access to these machines, everything has to be done from the command line.\nEdit 2: Also /etc/network/interfaces should not be copied.\n\nA: Yes, you can.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the /etc/fstab is still correct, based on where you put partitions and what types they are. Make sure you run mkswap on any swap partition. If UUIDs are used, then you'll need to update these. The blkid command will give you the UUIDs of all the new partitions. If labels are used, then use the e2label command (or equivalent command for your filesystem) to make sure that the labels match.\n\n*Skip these, and make sure you create empty ones at the other end: /run (/var/run on older releases), /proc, /sys, /dev. Check /proc/mounts on the old (running) system for others (there are fewer on newer releases).\n\n*Update /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts (which also contains the hostname).\n\n*Check /etc/udev/rules.d/ for a 70-persistent-net.rules or similarly named file that contains any NIC MAC addresses. These are usually skipped for virtual machines though, and the only harm would be that you end up with an eth1 device instead of the usual eth0.\n\n*As you've mentioned, you should check /etc/network/interfaces for correctness, especially with respect to ethernet device names.\n\n*Re-run the bootloader installation. This is the awkward bit. It depends on how your VPS provider boots your instance. It's worth having a plan for this before you begin.\n\nA: You can consider using the CloneZilla application, which allows you to either backup and restore, or directly clone, over the network.\nIt efficiently backs up (or clones) a disk, copying only the used parts of the partitions. It also copies the MBR.\nAfter restoring your new partition, be sure to correct the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*UUID in /etc/fstab (if required; in my experience, CloneZilla also clones the UUID).\n\n*The computer name in /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts.\n\n*If appropriate, any changes to /etc/samba/smb.conf.\n\n", "Q: Howto handle packaging and development in one git repository?

As no tarball is involved, there is no need to use git-import-orig.\nJust make sure that your branches and tag naming matches what git-buildpackage expects. If this is not the case, you will have to override the default configuration with your own configuration file. The syntax is explained in the documentation and the configuration file is searched at various locations.

I have a desktop PC that is wired. I dont have a router. I have only a Linux O.S. and no windows. It was installed when I got the machine. I want to use only the wireless connection.

For my wireless connection the speed value is up and down between 1 Mb/s and 54 Mb/s.  I've always taken this to be a measure of how strong and reliable the connection between laptop and WAP is.  However, I find it recently varying wildly when I'm stationary and close to the WAP/router.  Question, does this suggest a hardware problem?\nHope this isn't considered off topic.\n\nA: The difference in the wireless connections speed value is normally based on the capabilities of both the WAP and your adapter card in your computer. It does not necessarily show the strength of your signal, more the connections ability to accurately transmit data at designated speed values ie. 1Mb/s, 54Mb/s. I do not know enough of the Linux world to help with the troubleshooting that I would recommend. But If you can get some help from someone more Linux savvy the go for it.\nFirst thing that I would do is test your computer on a different WAP. If the connection is stable then you would need to go into troubleshooting your WAP which I will cover a little further down the post.\nIf in the event the connection is still shoddy and bouncing around then I would recommend un-installing your adapters drivers and ensuring that you have the most updated version for your card/OS. Once you have done that then I would use the software available for your adapter and set the link speed to match the link speed of your WAP (Most WAP's will state capable link speed somewhere on a sticky tag or sometimes right on the top of the case).\nIf you are still having trouble maintaining a stable connection then I would try a USB wireless adapter to see if maybe your on-board is having some issues. I do not recommend using the standard Wall-Mart available adapters, but they do the job in most cases. Install all the software and make sure it is up to date and test you connection again.\nOkay, with WAP's first off I would log into the WAP and ensure that all your tx/rx settings set set to their highest levels. Also most WAP's will have a firmware update option built into their configurations page. If not then you can always go to the manufactures web site and see if they have newer firmware and instructions on how to update your WAP.\nIf you have any questions or need me to walk you through any of the hardware settings just let me know by email. cody.castor@gmail.com\nHope this helps you out!\n", "Q: How can I regain internet access?

What I want to do is localise the network and only have one external node that all the other machines route through to access the Internet (and conversely, externally access the other nodes via SSH through this one machine).\nThis is set up on a university network, so we don't have an internal network router, only a switch (Netgear GS748T). Is it possible to use the switch to set up a local network (using say 192.168.x.x addressing) and then route through one machine to the external network? And if so, how is this set up and managed? The main reason for the switch is because we're entirely dependent on the external network being up for parallelisation -- if the university network drops for any reason, we lose the cluster connectivity.\nNot being a typical set up, I've found it difficult to find guides to get off the ground. As such, any help or suggestions of where to direct my search would be appreciated.\n\nA: I'm fairly new to this myself, but hopefully this helps:\nIf you put two NICs in your master node, you can have one of those connected to the outside world and then connect the other one to the switch which would connect to all of your compute nodes.  You would want to run DCHP to serve out IPs to all of the nodes and DNS so that people won't have to know the IPs of the nodes to ssh/rsh to them. Dnsmasq is the easiest way to get these two services running.\nIn /etc/network/interfaces add something like:\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\n# The inside network interface - To the Nodes\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 192.168.0.254 #(I set the master to 254 so node1 can be .1, etc)\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.0.0\nbroadcast 192.168.0.255\n\nIn /etc/dnsmasq.conf make sure you define interface=eth1 (the inside network) so you're not trying to serve IPs to the outside world.\nIn /etc/hosts add the lines for your compute nodes:\n...\n192.168.0.1    node1.<domain>   node1\n192.168.0.2    node2.<domain>   node2\n...\n\n", "Q: Why can't I create a Wi-Fi hotspot with Ubuntu 11.10 I was able to create a wi-fi hotspot using connectify in windows but once I switched to Ubuntu I am no longer able to do the same.

Please help me..\nFYI: I also tried to install 64bit 12.04 when it released, but had problems of windows not being listed in Grub bootloader.\n\nA: You don't have a proper EFI installation; there are several things wrong with it. First, though, consider this: It looks as if you're dual-booting with Windows, and Windows is clearly installed in BIOS mode. If you intend to keep booting Windows from this disk, I strongly recommend against attempting an EFI-mode installation of Linux. Instead, I recommend booting a Linux recovery disk in BIOS/legacy mode and re-installing GRUB 2. That should get Linux booting in BIOS mode, and you should be able to dual-boot Windows in BIOS mode.\nIf you don't care about booting Windows, or if you want to convert it to boot in EFI mode, you'll have to correct some things about your installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*The partition table uses the Master Boot Record (MBR) rather than the GUID Partition Table (GPT) system. Although some EFI-based computers seem to be able to boot from MBR disks, some have problems with this. I don't know what percentage have problems with this, but the vast majority of EFI installations use GPT. If you intend to convert Windows to boot in EFI mode, converting the disk to GPT is an absolute requirement. You can do an in-place conversion with GPT fdisk, which is available in the Ubuntu repositories as gdisk.\n\n*You have no EFI System Partition (ESP). It appears that your /dev/sda8 was intended as an ESP, but it has the wrong type code. On an MBR disk, an ESP has a type code of 0xEF. On a GPT disk, it's identified via a type code of EF00 in gdisk or by a \"boot flag\" in parted or GParted. (Note that the libparted \"boot flag\" means something entirely different on GPT disks than on MBR disks. Your /dev/sda8 does have an MBR \"boot flag,\" but that does not identify it as an ESP!)\n\n*It's unclear if you've registered your EFI version of GRUB with the EFI. If not, you need to do this with the efibootmgr utility, as in:\nefibootmgr -c -p 8 -l \\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\grubx64.efi -L Ubuntu\nThe installer should set this up, and you can type efibootmgr -v to see the existing entries to see if you've already got one.\n\n*There may be other things you'll need to do to get the system booting in EFI mode, but they're likely to be highly system-specific.

I don't believe b43 and firmware is optimal for 14e4:4727.\n\nA: You need to install third-party drivers from Broadcom. Even if you want to use b43 (although your card is not in the list of supported and tested devices, this may require forcing b43 to work on that card, I don't know), you'd need firmware from broadcom.\nUbuntu has a page with instructions to handle Broadcom wireless cards. So do other Linux distros, namely Arch Linux, which also describes the state of Broadcom wireless cards.\nIn short, you need to install the bcmwl package. (The page also lists broadcom-sta, which is the name used on my (non-Ubuntu) distro, I am not sure of what the difference is, but that does say to install bcmwl...)\n", "Q: How do I run eclipse as sudo I've read that it's bad to run gui applications from a terminal using sudo.\nIn order to administer some eclipse updates, I need elevated privileges (view screenshot). \nHow do I do this correctly?\n\n\nA: If, like me, you're forced to sudo eclipse because you did it once out of desperation, which changed some config file as root, and permanently rooted you in Sudoland for Eclipse. You can try:\nsudo chmod -R a+rwx ~/workspace \nsudo chmod -R a+rwx ~/.eclipse \n\nthat got me out of it.\n\nA: To run GUI applications as root you should not be using sudo, but instead use gksu.\nIn this particular case run gksu eclipse, then enter your password.\n\nA: Basically the Eclipse update system does not work well when repackaged for various operating system packages.  If \"apt-get upgrade\" does not work for you, then I would suggest you stay away from the packaged version of Eclipse, and simply download the one you need directly from Eclipse, unpack and run it.\nThen you can update it as needed.\n", "Q: Offline File & Document Management System?

For example, right-click on a file in Nautilus and go to the Tags tab.\nThe Unity Dash includes automatic indexing and full text search for your documents.\nDocuments you save end up on your own hard drive by default, in a folder structure of your choice.\nIn short, doesn't Ubuntu do exactly what you're asking straight out of the box? If not, please could you edit your question to make it clear exactly how your requirements do not match what Ubuntu provides already?\n", "Q: How can I save settings when booting an iso file from HDD? I was looking for an easy way to manually save settings when booting from an iso-file in the hard disk with grub2, and load them the next boot; but maybe it would be easier to do a persistent boot that automatically restores the saved settings. The only info I have found talks about usb, complex tools or just ideas and plans but I haven't seen any solution. I guess this could be solved with a dedicated partition for the persistence or with a file in the same partition where the ISO files resides. I would prefer the last one because the idea of repartitioning a hard disk on a macbook with refit and dual boot doesn't thrill me.\n...........\nNote: Sadi's solution is not working for me (without the first line and the file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed parameter). Unfortunately, and according to other posts, there are many combinations possible: the casper-rw has to be on the root directory?, does it have to be in a vfat partition? the paramenters are persistent rw?, is a paramenter persistent-path needed?... and so on.\nI can hardly believe there is not a single example that explains all this in a clear way.\n\nA: *\n\n*Your grub2 menu entry should be something like this:\nmenuentry \"Ubuntu iso\" {\nsearch --set -f \"/ubuntu.iso\"\nloopback loop \"/ubuntu.iso\"\nlinux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz root=UUID=71C2-0118 iso-scan/filename=/ubuntu.iso boot=casper file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed noprompt quiet persistent splash --\ninitrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz\n}\n\n\n*To have the persistent option work, all you need is a persistent file named casper-rw (size depends on your needs) which can be produced (see: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-create-a-larger-casper-rw-loop-file/) or downloaded from internet (see: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/diskimg/).\n\nA: After trying different combinations around  Sadi's solution, the only thing that has worked for me is to place the ext2 file called casper-rw in a FAT partition (I haven't been able to boot if the file is not in the FAT partition) and the only parameter that I need to add to the menu entry in grub2's menu that already booted the iso-image is \"persistent\" (no reference to the FAT partition). The menu etry is like this:\n`\nmenuentry 'ISO Booting - Ubuntu-64bit.iso live' {\n  set isofile=\"/home/user/Desktop/ISO/Ubuntu-64bit.iso\"\n  loopback loop (hd0,3)$isofile\n  linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz boot=casper iso-scan/filename=$isofile bootkbd=es console-setup/layoutcode=es persistent noprompt noeject --\n  initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz\n}\n`\nThe problem is that the the whole FAT partition that contains the casper-rw, ext2 file, becomes unaccesible; it can't be mounted because it's busy.\nAny workarounds? \n", "Q: How can I install software without using dpkg or APT? Since my catalogue was broken (which thing is detailed here How do I repair my broken catalogue?) I have been unable to install software or update software.\nCould somebody tell me a way of installing and updating software (regardless of origin and package type so I can install any software I could before the catalogue broke) despite my broken catalogue?\n\nA: Ubuntu, being a Debian derivative, is solidy built on APT. dpkg, apt-get, the Ubuntu Software Centre and PPAs all depend on APT to work correctly.\nHaving said that, you can install programs from source, bypassing APT. Have a look at this question for how to do it: How do I install a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) file?\nIn your case, I would not recommend this. I would concentrate on trying to fix the broken catalogue. APT is much superior and easier to use than installing directly from source packages, and you are much more likely to have success fixing APT's problems than you are fixing problems with source installations.\nSee this question for a summary of the differences between APT and installing straight from source: Should I install programs from a source tarball (`.tar.gz`), from the Ubuntu Software Centre, or from elsewhere?\n", "Q: Where does Ubuntu Tweak save the wallpaper?

If I open a gnome terminal and connect to a server through SSH, I am asked for my passphrase by a text prompt in my terminal instead of a GUI, and, worse, this passphrase is not stored in memory for the duration of my Ubuntu session.\nOn the contrary, I use PGP keys with Enigmail in Thunderbird, and I have to enter my passphrases only once per session, using a GUI.\nIt seems I have 3 agents installed and running: seahorse-daemon, gpg-agent and ssh-agent, and they do not seem to play along nicely. I have a gnome-keyring running, too. I do not understand what each of these programs is supposed to do.\nssh-agent is run by my system with \"/usr/bin/gpg-agent\" as first command argument, and I do not understand what this means. \nHow can I set up which agent to use for ssh keys ?\n\nA: I do not use the GUI util in \"settings\" -> \"passwords and keys\"\nI have installed keychain. \n\nsudo apt-get install keychain\n\nIf you're running bash you need to add a few commands to your .bash_profile\nIf you do  not have a .bash_profile create one in your home folder. Add these lines:\n### START-Keychain ###\n# Let  re-use ssh-agent and/or gpg-agent between logins\n/usr/bin/keychain $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa\nsource $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh\n### End-Keychain ###\n\nAt the start of a work day I will login. When I open a terminal, I will be prompted once for my passphrase. For all other new terminals and connections I will not be asked for my passphrase again. \n\nA: Run ssh-add in a terminal, and type in your passphrase when prompted. If this works, then every subsequent access to your ssh key should just work without any prompting, in all terminals and applications running in the same X session.\n\nA: I did a lot of testing and research to find out that most of the documents are out of date, here is a simple and yet effective way to get it working.\nAt the bottom of your .bashrc file just put this in:\n# use a tty for gpg\n# solves error: \"gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device\"\nGPG_TTY=$(tty)\nexport GPG_TTY\n# Start the gpg-agent if not already running\nif ! pgrep -x -u \"${USER}\" gpg-agent >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n    gpg-connect-agent /bye >/dev/null 2>&1\n    gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye >/dev/null\nfi\n# Set SSH to use gpg-agent\nunset SSH_AGENT_PID\nif [ \"${gnupg_SSH_AUTH_SOCK_by:-0}\" -ne $$ ]; then\n    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=\"${HOME}/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh\"\nfi\n# add alias for ssh to update the tty\nalias ssh=\"gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye >/dev/null; ssh\"\n\nHope this saves someone the headache of revewing old documentation.\n", "Q: Booting issues after crash during update While automatically updating to the newest version of Ubuntu, my laptop crashed (I was watching youtube videos and the screen went to the desktop, could still hear the audio, but could not get anything to do anything... the mouse arrow would not even move)...\nI hard rebooted the laptop and ever since it will only boot into a basic blue background with the one folder icon (looks like a blank piece of paper with a corner folded over). My usb mouse is recognized, but the launch bar does not appear, and I cannot get any programs to launch (or even find any of them)...\nIf I download Ubuntu on to a usb flash drive and boot my computer with the flash drive plugged in, will it automatically load Ubuntu again? The laptop is a Lenovo x200 that does not have a built in disk drive, I do have a usb cd/dvd drive (the computer does not seem to recognize it when it is plugged in)... What can I do?\n\nA: If it crashed during an update, you're in deep trouble. At this point, you have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall, lose everything. (Easiest. I have done this myself a few times ;)\n\n*Back up everything, reinstall. (Medium, requires a bit of linux knowledge.)\n\n*Attempt to repair your current installation. (medium, requires a lot of time. May not work.)\n\n\nReinstall, lose everything\nInstall from the Live CD/USB, just like you did the first time. If you don't remember the procedure, or didn't install it yourself, read this before continuing.\nDURING THE INSTALLATION PROCESS, if you're running a dual-boot, tell it to overwrite the existing Ubuntu installation. If it's a full-disk install (i.e., you don't have Windows installed on that computer as well,) just tell it to format the whole disk.\nBack up your files, then reinstall  NOTE: For this, you'll need something to back the files up to.\n\nThis is actually fairly simple.\nWhile it's booting up, hold CTRL. You should see a screen with a purple background (sometimes it's black) and a few options. One of these is labeled as a \"Recovery Mode\". Choose it.\nDuring the startup, you'll see a bunch of text on the screen, maybe some errors. Don't panic. Once it finishes, choose \"Drop to root shell prompt\".\nYou'll need to know the drive of your external HD (or whatever you're using to back up with.) Type, at the prompt: fdisk -l\nYou should see a bunch of info. If you pay attention, you'll see that it's arranged in a table. Try to puzzle out which entry is your external HD. (Guessing by size is usually a safe bet.)\nHere's my partition table, for an example:Disk /dev/sda: 160.0 GB, 160000000000 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 19452 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *           1       12234    98263714+   7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda2           12234       19453    57985025    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5           19192       19453     2094080   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda6           12234       19192    55890944   83  Linux\n\nPartition table entries are not in disk order\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 8014 MB, 8014266368 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 974 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *           1         974     7823623+   b  W95 FAT32\nHere, /dev/sda is my hard drive, and /dev/sdb is a flash drive I had plugged in. (1024 MB = 1 GB)\nNow, note the Device (e.g., /dev/sdb1) and the filesystem type (e.g., NTFS.)\nIf it's NTFS, type sudo mount -t ntfs -o nls=utf8,umask=0222 /dev/FOO1 /media/ (replace FOO1 with the drive you found earlier - e.g., /dev/sdb1)\nIf it's FAT32, type sudo mount -t vfat -o iocharset=utf8,umask=000 /dev/FOO1 /media/ (again, don't type FOO1.)\nNow, a good idea ismkdir /media/ubuntu-backup\ncp -Rv /home /media/ubuntu-backup\nAfter if finishes, use another computer to double-check that the files are backed up, then do method 1 above to reinstall.\nAttempt to repair your current installation\nUse the process in method 2 to get to the root shell prompt. At the prompt, type:\ndpkg-reconfigure -a\napt-get update\napt-get dist-upgrade\nreboot\n\n(If you'll be running it overnight, just type this one command: dpkg-reconfigure -a && apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade -y && reboot. This will run all the commands in order, and tell the upgrade command not to ask any questions, unless there's a problem.)\nBE SURE your internet is in a stable condition, and will be so for a while. After you execute the command, it will probably take a LONG time.\nIf this third method fails, just try method 2.\n", "Q: Configuring a HTTP and HTTPS web accelerator using Varnish I have installed and configured varnish on my new server. The server is currently working for http traffic.\nI would like to also forward SSL traffic to my webserver. It is not necessary to cache this traffic at this time.\nAny suggestions? Thank you!\n\nA: After reading the comment by gertvdijk, I have decided that the best strategy is to forward HTTPS traffic from the firewall directly to the web server, bypassing the Varanish proxy (as I don't need it to cache this traffic).\n\nIf I understand your question correctly, you want to handle the SSL\n  layer at your webserver behind Varnish, right? Why would want a caching server to only\n  forward traffic? You can use plain firewall (iptables) rules or have your webserver\n  connected directly at port 443 for this without the need for traffic to pass Varnish.\n\n\nA: I don't think varnish support caching for https, if you want caching with ssl, nginx might be a better choice for you\n", "Q: Why do I get \"Failed to fetch [...] Hash Sum mismatch\" errors during update? \nPossible Duplicate:\nTrouble downloading updates due to “Hash sum mismatch” error \n\nEvery time I try to update my system I get these messages:\nW:Failed to fetch bzip2:/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/it.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_precise-updates_universe_binary-amd64_Packages  Hash Sum mismatch\nE:Some index files failed to download.

I have Windows and Ubuntu partitions on my laptop. I tried using Wine to start Steam. It actually works and may function fine. My only problem is when I try to start one of my games, some of them will start. The only game that works so far is Team Fortress 2. The game is a bit slow and when you go to one the battle areas and stutters a little. Is it because of the NTFS on my partition? Or is it because of my graphics card? I have an Icore3 CPU,4 gigs of RAM, and a intel hd 3000 graphics card. Is there some way to improve the performance?\n\nA: I can pretty positively say it has nothing to do with your NTFS partition.\nThe fact of the matter is that Wine can't run everything. Some games just don't function properly with Wine. Wine runs Windows programs, but it hasn't mastered it yet. Sometimes it just...doesn't work.\nYour graphics card (although you don't technically have a card, the Intel HD series is integrated graphics) will affect the speed and sometimes compatability of games as well.\nIn the meantime, you can try running Steam natively on Ubuntu.

Sometimes when looking at programs in the Ubuntu Software Center, I see things about the programs being 'for the GTK+ environment', or 'for GNOME', or a whole lot of other things.  All I know is that I've got Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and what I'm seeing through my monitor appears to be the controversial Unity interface.\nWhat are these other things I see mentioned in the descriptions of programs (such as KDE, GTK, QT, GNOME, GNOME 'shell', etc.)?  Are they Linux GUIs that are alternatives to Unity?  Are they dependencies that I need to have?  \nI've spent the last several months getting used to Ubuntu in its present form (though I confess, I have played around with Compiz, which is fun as hell).  Will these other things completely turn my world upside down if I use them?\n\nA: GTK, GTK+, and Qt are GUI toolkits. These are libraries that developers use to design graphical interfaces, all running on top of the X Server or Wayland. These are things that you need to install as dependencies. They're the Linux \"equivalent\" to Windows' GDI/GDI+. When an application uses any of these, it will usually have a general \"look and feel\".\nGNOME and KDE are Desktop Environments. GNOME primarily uses the GTK+ toolkit, while KDE primarily uses the Qt toolkit. There are applications designed for GNOME or KDE, such as a settings menu or a default music player, usually in the appropriate toolkit. These Desktop Environments have a set of utilities/window managers/design specification to create a more unified desktop. You can mix the two if you feel like it, but you may run into issues with colliding standards and applications (which is a bit more common on systems like Arch).\nUnity uses many of the GNOME utilities and backends (Nautilus, Rhythmbox, gvfs, etc.), so Unity is more GNOME than KDE.\n\nA: GTK+ is the \"GIMP Toolkit\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK+) ; this refers to the widgets - the bits that make up GUI applications, like buttons, menus, drop lists, etc - and the underlying bits you can't see, like libraries for storing configuration.\nUnity is a desktop environment - based on Gnome.\nGNOME is a desktop environment that uses GTK+ as its GUI toolkit.\nKDE is another desktop environment. It's more like Windows in general style and uses Qt as its GUI toolkit.\nThe good news is that Qt applications run just fine in Unity.\nThe medium news is that some applications written for KDE use quite a lot of the KDE desktop and pull in a lot of dependencies. While this won't break anything, it can consume a lot of system resources running chunks of KDE that you're not really using.\nAn application written on Qt is not necessarily the same as an app written for KDE, though. There are plenty of apps that use Qt for their GUI and don't use the KDE libraries.\n", "Q: Manually turn on CPU fan My BIOS controls my fan speeds, and I want to keep it that way. I have a machine in my basement where it's normally pretty cool, and as long as the machine isn't under high load the fans don't need to run at all. The BIOS already handles this just fine.\nBut if my fans aren't running, I have no way to test them to make sure they aren't broken. So I'd like to make a script which will turn on the fans full blast for a few seconds, then use lm-sensors to monitor fan speed, and then I will know that the fans aren't broken.\nHow can I manually turn on the fans to full speed? I don't want to use fancontrol, because I'm not looking for something that keeps running and keeps controlling fan speed. I just want something \"low tech\" that will turn them on regardless of temperature.\nAnother thread said:\n\nIf you really want to do it yourself, you can probably find special device files named pwm1, pwm2, etc. in /sys/class/hwmon/*/device/. You can cat them to get the current value or write a number between 0 and 255 to change the fan speed.\n\nThat would be perfect, but it doesn't seem to work. Fancontrol says that my CPU fan is /sys/devices/platform/it87.656/pwm3, but when I set that to 255, it doesn't affect fan speed at all.\nDoes anyone know how I can manually turn on the fan from a script, regardless of temperature?\n\nA: You can do this with the tool\npwmconfig\n\nThis tool is normally used to save a configuration file for fancontrol. But you don't have to do so. You can just start the tool, than it will put all fans on full speed, sowing there current speed like this:\nGiving the fans some time to reach full speed...\nFound the following fan sensors:\n  hwmon0/device/fan1_input     current speed: 2129 RPM\n  hwmon0/device/fan2_input     current speed: 1679 RPM\n  hwmon0/device/fan3_input     current speed: 0 ... skipping!\n  hwmon0/device/fan4_input     current speed: 0 ... skipping!\n\nAfter that you just skip (Ctr+C) the tool without saving anything.\nTo install the tool, you can use the following command:\nsudo apt-get install fancontrol\n\n", "Q: ext4 filesystem wrongly detected as jmicron_raid_member I have an installation of Ubuntu 12.04 on an SSD disk that I'm unable to boot after a kernel upgrade and a reboot. Additional things that might be a possible cause is that I did some cleanup (dpkg -r) of old unused kernels (a list that I selected manually from dpkg -l | grep linux-).\nThe following is what I can gather from booting a live system (that is, boot another operating system) and trying to access the disk.\nThe disk has two partitions, the first one is a small partition (sdb1) containing a /boot ext2 filesystem, and the second is LUKS encrypted, so I have opened it up using cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb5 ssd. The new device is an LVM2 pv so I make that available with vgscan and then vgchange -a y. Now I have one LVM2 vg containing two logical volumes named foo-root and foo-swap. It is foo-root that contains my filesystem.\nNow is when weird things start to happen. I try to mount the filesystem with mount /dev/mapper/foo-root /mnt which returns:\n\nmount: unknown filesystem type 'jmicron_raid_member'\n\nSo I try to specify the filesystem type mount -t ext4 /dev/mapper/foo-root /mnt, and that works. I am happy to be able to access my data, but since I still cannot boot the disk I unmount the filesystem and continue exploring.\nI run fsck.ext4 -f /dev/mapper/foo-root without errors.\nAt this point it seems that the problem is that the file system type is reported incorrectly. I run blkid -p /dev/mapper/foo-root and it returns:\n\n/dev/mapper/foo-root: VERSION=\"55.72\" TYPE=\"jmicron_raid_member\" USAGE=\"raid\"\n\nA healthy ext4 filesystem would return UUID=\"along-uuid\" TYPE=\"ext4\".\nI turn to google. It seems that dmraid could remove the erroneous RAID header with dmraid -Er but that does not work. Also dmraid -r returns:\n\nno raid disks\n\nFor good measure, and a bit of alright-already-fix-it feeling, I try dmraid -x and dmraid -Er /dev/mapper/foo-root and neither helps in any way.\nWhile accessing the filesystem I have tried various things like chrooting into it and rebuilding the initrd, rewrite grub to MBR (tried both sdb and sdb1), and making sdb1 bootable, among other things. Nothing seems to make the disk bootable again.\nI am out of options. Any help is appreciated.\nUPDATE: Running the command from @psusi comment:\n0000000: 4a4d 4837 780a 4744 5851 7033 4d70 5136  JMH7x.GDXQp3MpQ6\n0000010: 6c71 5056 4932 4f31 6c49 7155 7646 6359  lqPVI2O1lIqUvFcY\n0000020: 414b 382f 7054 766f 5a32 5a57 754c 585a  AK8/pTvoZ2ZWuLXZ\n0000030: 6e59 7746 5174 4b53 5656 686e 6230 4e4a  nYwFQtKSVVhnb0NJ\n0000040: 4646 685a 506b 4155 3936 7335 4d69 2f65  FFhZPkAU96s5Mi/e\n0000050: 4971 0a67 5346 6a59 4b43 4f2f 536f 5a5a  Iq.gSFjYKCO/SoZZ\n0000060: 4855 3838 7231 2b6c 4137 4558 326c 704d  HU88r1+lA7EX2lpM\n0000070: 6e6e 6a74 5463 4d63 2b6c 4959 3131 334c  nnjtTcMc+lIY113L\n0000080: 6a6f 4b69 4346 4f56 4a42 3635 4641 4675  joKiCFOVJB65FAFu\n0000090: 4457 626d 312b 5658 4c4b 4f64 7458 4a0a  DWbm1+VXLKOdtXJ.\n00000a0: 4e5a 6136 6841 6b6a 5573 6553 6176 6e30  NZa6hAkjUseSavn0\n00000b0: 735a 2b7a 5637 6f71 6561 564f 3566 6c7a  sZ+zV7oqeaVO5flz\n00000c0: 3655 3458 6855 6373 4b6c 4d70 784a 494c  6U4XhUcsKlMpxJIL\n00000d0: 612f 3152 6a46 6157 3563 3966 4e6b 4f31  a/1RjFaW5c9fNkO1\n00000e0: 4150 6331 6f32 3368 6131 6a62 0a66 6653  APc1o23ha1jb.ffS\n00000f0: 2f61 626e 474e 6b66 4559 787a 6e31 4e63  /abnGNkfEYxzn1Nc\n0000100: 3157 7139 6b61 526a 6255 3339 4a69 314b  1Wq9kaRjbU39Ji1K\n0000110: 3632 5765 6e51 4b6c 7567 3373 5742 4148  62WenQKlug3sWBAH\n0000120: 7278 5854 5165 4634 346e 6534 3143 4d33  rxXTQeF44ne41CM3\n0000130: 637a 592b 5668 3870 2f0a 4373 7562 5132  czY+Vh8p/.CsubQ2\n0000140: 6847 3675 6470 3455 3850 5875 7132 5631  hG6udp4U8PXuq2V1\n0000150: 465a 324b 7851 4842 5975 4e75 4354 6a49  FZ2KxQHBYuNuCTjI\n0000160: 4866 474b 364f 342b 4851 3036 454a 4a4e  HfGK6O4+HQ06EJJN\n0000170: 4578 5541 6b4b 546a 5070 7a53 5431 4432  ExUAkKTjPpzST1D2\n0000180: 6e4b 506e 6730 0a37 5449 6d44 5478 4462  nKPng0.7TImDTxDb\n0000190: 7879 514d 6e30 7761 7a5a 2f45 324a 7047  xyQMn0wazZ/E2JpG\n00001a0: 4563 7337 6a6e 4c63 4138 6574 4356 7a4a  Ecs7jnLcA8etCVzJ\n00001b0: 766e 454c 586e 6957 7868 4639 5038 4132  vnELXniWxhF9P8A2\n00001c0: 645a 2f66 3277 7556 794f 344a 3731 4e59  dZ/f2wuVyO4J71NY\n00001d0: 5357 6c0a 696b 7364 6a59 7665 7356 4b6f  SWl.iksdjYvesVKo\n00001e0: 572b 376e 314f 6174 752b 6737 4c59 5732  W+7n1Oatu+g7LYW2\n00001f0: 744e 574d 5a6a 765a 3459 5933 7756 696a  tNWMZjvZ4YY3wVij\n\n\nA: For some reason it looks like you have a jmicron raid signature at the end of the volume.

That is too much, it is only reading text from the sources, and you are right about that. The answer is that it did not use 25mb! The fact is that although the download speed is 128kb/s, it does not mean that it is constantly downloading data. Most of the time it is simply processing. As a test, open your Terminal and type the following command:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nEnter your password when asked, and wait for it to finish downloading the sources.

Ubuntu One syncs directories only in the home folder and don't work with links.\nThen I create empty directories in home like Documents, Downloads, Pictures etc.. and used fstab file to bind my old NTFS directories to the empty directories.\nThis is part of the fstab file:\n# binds\n/media/DataNtfs/Music           /home/can/Music                  none    rw,bind \n/media/DataNtfs/Pictures        /home/can/Pictures               none    rw,bind \n/media/DataNtfs/Downloads       /home/can/Downloads              none    rw,bind \n/media/DataNtfs/Documents       /home/can/Documents              none    rw,bind \n/media/DataNtfs/Backups         /home/can/Backups                none    rw,bind \n/media/DataNtfs/Notes           /home/can/Notes                  none    rw,bind \n/media/DataNtfs/Other           /home/can/Other                  none    rw,bind \n/media/DataNtfs/Packages        /home/can/Packages               none    rw,bind \n/media/DataNtfs/Photos          /home/can/Photos                 none    rw,bind \n/media/DataNtfs/Videos          /home/can/Videos                 none    rw,bind \n/media/DataNtfs/WorkSpace       /home/can/WorkSpace              none    rw,bind \n\nBind works well. Now I can sync some of data directories with Ubuntu One. As if data directories are actually in the home directory. So I think 'the best way' is bind.\nBy the way; DataNtfs partition is always mounted by fstab and I never unmount it.\n\nA: Unless the partitions are already mounted, the latter two techniques wouldn't work. However you can try mounting them using fstab at boot and see if they work.\n\nNo, a symbolic link would not work. The reason is links only work if the linked file is on the same partition as the link itself.\nYou'd be able to create a link, but once you unmount the partition and open the link it'd give you something like this:\n\nThe bottom line is: Links are good as long as the other partition is mounted. Links cannot mount the partition for you.\nSimilarly when you modify your xdg-users-dirs using ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs, it won't work. When I tried to change my Music directory to something else in other partition, it didn't work even after a restart. \n", "Q: What does \"sudo echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 > /etc/resolv.conf\" do? Can someone please tell me what sudo echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 > /etc/resolv.conf does?\nI used to have random dropping of internet connection for 15 seconds to 3 mins but after using this command, internet connection is working like a charm. I am just curious what this magic command line did. \n\nA: It replaces the nameserver (DNS) used on your machine by the Google Public DNS service. If running that command helps you out, you're having DNS issues in the default settings provided by your network probably (DHCP). While it would be better to resolve the root cause of the issue, this is a general answer to your question.\n\nExplanation of the command\nsudo echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 > /etc/resolv.conf\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo elevates privileges to be root in this case.\n\n*echo just outputs the arguments following to the standard output (in this case it outputs nameserver 8.8.8.8)\n\n*> redirects standard output to a file (overwrites it) in a regular Unix shell.\n\n*/etc/resolv.conf is the file where the output is written to.\n\n*Having a line nameserver 8.8.8.8 in /etc/resolv.conf makes the system using the nameserver having IP address 8.8.8.8 for resolving domain names to IP addresses. (very short version of what actually happens)\n\n*8.8.8.8 is one of the addresses published by Google as to where their public DNS services are listening on.\n\n\nsudo mistake\nWhile this explanation sounds plausible, this won't work, because of an error you'll get:\nbash: /etc/resolv.conf: Permission denied\n\nWhy? The output redirection is handled by your shell (here: Bash) and is not taken into account for the command used for sudo. Similar to how multiplying in maths has precedence over adding. So, it's just echo that has got elevated privileges, but your shell hasn't! To solve this, one should run this command like\nsudo sh -c \"echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 > /etc/resolv.conf\"\n\nor, by using a pipe and tee to output it to a file:\necho nameserver 8.8.8.8 | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf  #prints to screen as well\n\nUbuntu and Network Manager\nOn Ubuntu this is only a temporary change, as Network Manager \"manages\" the /etc/resolv.conf file. Local modifications will be overwritten. That's why you should configure this in Network Manager to have it persistent.\n\nConfiguration using Network Manager\nI would recommend configuring your PC properly using Network Manager. I'm assuming you're using DHCP on your network here (most common). Then do this to perform the same as equivalent to the command you were using:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Edit connections:\n\n\n*Edit the connection profile you're using.\n\n\n*On the IPv4 Settings tab:\n\n\n*\n\n*Method: Automatic (DHCP) addresses only\nThis setting makes it doing a regular DHCP request for IP address configuration of your host, but it will ignore other non-mandatory options like DNS servers suggested.\n\n*DNS Servers: 8.8.8.8\n\n*Hit Save\n\nDone.\n\nImportant notes\nIn a local or corporate network the local DNS server might be used for local hosts. You'll loose this functionality by directly asking Google's servers to resolve names for you. So, if for example the local DNS server would know what \"printer\" is, then you'll loose using your printer by that name.\nSo, please, fix your local DNS server instead. If it's just a simple forwarder to a broken DNS server of your ISP and you can't change that (ISP-managed all-in-one-router for example), then this 8.8.8.8 solution might be your only option.\n", "Q: How can I let Unity WebApps always run in Chromium?

I pinged the sites earlier while at work and, if anything, the ping times from this computer were lower than the ping times from my work computer, which loaded both of these pages in under 30 seconds.\n\nA: Out of the question but, do you happen to be connected via 2 NICs on the same PC? I ask since I see:\n[   59.129120] eth1: IPv6 duplicate address fe80::422c:f4ff:fe05:4843 detected!\n\nIn your log, so I would think that your wired connection got connected first, followed by your wireless connection, which gave that error since they are both connected to the same device. Might no be the case, just to make sure you check it out. Now with your answer:\nThis could be Ubuntu, but since, some pages are slow and others are not maybe you can do the following to check, if it is the site or you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ping the site (This is the quickest way to see where the problem lies)\nping boingboing.net \nping offliberty.com\nFYI - I did this and got low latency but the pages for me opened like a minute or two after I tried to visit them. They are way too slow to open in Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Opera and IE in Wine. I open other sites in less than 5 seconds.\n\n*Trace your way to the site (Assuming the Ping was not enough)\ntracepath boingboing.net \ntracepath offliberty.com\nAnother FYI - After doing this, at least with boingboing.net, the latency went really high on the jumps that said Chicago1, Miami1, Atlanta2. This might be my routing path but boy did it go up on those 3.\n\n*If both of the above are positive, then try to use another computer (Same browser). For example, if you tested Firefox, then test Firefox in another computer. This can tell you if it is Ubuntu or the site.\n\n*Make sure nobody else is using the internet connection when you are testing this (Happens a lot).\n\n*Reboot or turn off/on the router and any other network device. Just to make sure since some devices need the occasional off and on to get them to work correctly again.\n\n*Instead of using the wireless card, if possible, try to test the same connection with your wired card (If you can manage a cable to the router).\n\n*Test the connection in different times of the day. Sometimes, using the connection a peak hours in your city / state will make your connection slow for some types of connections of course. This is also the case for sites, where, they have some peak hours or peak days where they get too many visitors and their connection goes down because of it. So try to test this also.\nFor the rest, as far as I can see, there is nothing wrong with your configuration. This might just be a moment that the pages are passing through, where they have high latency. For me, I think is not your problem but the sites problem, because when I did the tests I also did them in Windows and even called a friend in that moment. She told me the sites where slower than even facebook on a horrible day.\n\nA: Have you tried installing Google Chrome instead? Although not open source, Google Chrome is the best choice for most users as it already includes nearly all the codecs and extensions most websites need to operate correctly.\nhttp://www.howopensource.com/2011/10/install-google-chrome-in-ubuntu-11-10-11-04-10-10-10-04/\n\nA: This can be a hardware problem. I have seen same problem happens in HP Notebook 15-ac125tx. Using external USB Adapter has solved this problem.I prefer this TP-Link TL-WN725N 150Mbps Wireless N Nano USB Adapter (Black).\n", "Q: How to search for source packages? I can use aptitude to search for packages using a search term. For example, to search for all packages whose name begins with Foo:\n$ aptitude search Foo*\n\nHowever, this listing does not include source packages (package with source code).\nHow do I search and list source packages using a search term?\n\nA: Searching: I don't know how to perform a regex search over source package names using apt on the target machine, but one can perform a regex search over source package names by selecting \"Source package names\" under \"Search package directories\" at http://packages.ubuntu.com\nListing: Once you know the source package name 'foo', apt-cache showsrc foo shows the source package records for foo.\n\nA: this is what I do (besides what is listed) using unity as a example\napt-cache policy unity*\n\nor \nThis is a much larger list that shows you  the control files of packages\n   apt-cache show unity* \nOr you can use 'dump' to dump everything (not recommended)\napt-cache dump unity*\n\nOr you can use dpkg also like \ndpkg-query -l | grep unity*\n\nOr you could use \napt-cache showpkg unity*    \n\nHope this helps \n", "Q: Is there anyone who has Canon MX435 printer. No driver for Linux There is Mac and Windows drivers only. I tried that tar.gz file http://support-au.canon.com.au/contents/AU/EN/0100412601.html\nNothing happened. Usb cable not connected. Trying to print over wifi.\nHow can I use MX435 from Ubuntu?\n\nA: According to that webpage you posted, there is a Linux driver. It's nice to find Linux support from manufacturers. The bad part is there's no easy installer provided.\nIn case you didn't know already, a .tar.gz file is a compressed directory in a file, somewhat like a .zip.\nWhat you want to do first is extract the .tar.gz file. You can do this by double clicking the downloading cnijfilter-mx430series-3.70-1-deb.tar.gz file and selecting \"Extract\". After you extract the contents of the archive, navigate to the extracted directory. Inside you will find install.sh. Double click it - Ubuntu will then ask whether you want to run the program or not. Say that you want to run the program in a terminal. \nTell us if it works, or if the terminal says anything unusual. If it says something along the lines of must be run as superuser or need root privileges, then you'll need to run it as root. For that...you'd need to navigate to the directory in a terminal and run sudo install.sh.\n\nA: The URL http://support-au.canon.com.au/contents/AU/EN/0100412601.html\ndoes contain a driver.\nI also have an Canon MX 435 that i have had trouble installing on my Ubuntu 12-04.\nAfter installing this driver the printer works so far.\n", "Q: How do I create a bootable Ubuntu USB using Trisquel? Does anyone have experience creating a bootable Ubuntu USB from the Trisquel OS? \nI have no access to a Windows or OS X machine.\n\nA: Trisquel is sufficiently similar to Ubuntu that you can use essentially the same technique recommended for making an Ubuntu USB on a pre-existing Ubuntu system.\n\n*\n\n*How to create a bootable USB stick on Ubuntu\nOr you can use the Trisquel GNU/Linux instructions for writing a Trisquel ISO to a USB flash drive, but write the Ubuntu ISO image instead of a Trisquel ISO image:\n\n*\n\n*How to Create a LiveUSB\nThe Ubuntu instructions say to search for Startup Disk Creator in the Unity dash. The Trisquel instructions say to run it from System Settings (in the GNOME Control Center).\nIf you don't use a GNOME-based desktop (includes Unity), you can run it directly by pressing Alt+F2, typing usb-creator-gtk, and pressing Enter.\nIf you're using KDE as your desktop environment, run usb-creator-kde instead.\nusb-creator-gtk and usb-creator-kde are available for all versions of Trisquel GNU/Linux. If you don't have them, you can install them with the package manager--for example, in Add/Remove Applications. But they are installed by default; it's quite unlikely you don't have them.\nHere's a summary of what to do once you have successfully launched the utility:\n\nThen click Other, find the ISO image, and back on the main screen, select which device you want to write it to. (Be careful not to select the wrong one, as this overwrites whatever data are already there.) Click Make Startup Disk.\n\nOr use the terminal-based instructions:\nThe CLI instructions there work too. As it says, run:\nsudo dd if=/path/to/image.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=8M;sync\n\n*\n\n*/path/to/image.iso should be replaced by the actual path. (One way to get this is to drag the ISO image into the terminal window from a file browser window or the desktop.)\n\n*X should be replaced by the letter (a, b, c, ...) representing the physical disk to which you are writing the image.\n\n*It is very important to avoid accidentally writing the image (or any part of it) to the wrong drive. Like on Ubuntu, when you run sudo dd ... in Trisquel GNU/Linux, there is no protection against a typo that could potentially cause substantial data loss. While an equivalent mistake using the GUI utility (explained above) is possible, the interface makes it somewhat less likely. If you're not already comfortable using the command-line, I recommend the GUI way instead.\n\n\nA: I recommend MultiSystem utility for best results with the least problems, which you can download and install from here: http://liveusb.info/dotclear/index.php?pages/install\n", "Q: Nvidia driver installed but no menu, hud, or dash are shown I have Ubuntu 12.10 and I have been very painfully trying to figure out how to install my Nvidia drivers.\nOnline I read to do this: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get updates\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nI did that and restart and now i have no menues, HUD, dash or anything, just my desktop wallpaper and a handfull of icons i left on the desktop. \nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: Ok, so you are experiencing something that happens to a small group, me included. The solution is a little bit tedious but if you have an internet connection then we can proceed.\nAnother point to be noted, if you are trying to install the driver into a optimus/hybrid graphics enabled laptop/All in one, you may stuck at black screen or low resolution (or some weird situation). \n\n\n*\n\n*These nvidia-driver doesn't support optimus enabled computer. To know how to work with these models see Is a NVIDIA GeForce with Optimus Technology supported by Ubuntu?. \n\n*To know whether you have optimus, execute lspci | grep VGA, if the output is two line intel HD and nvidia, you do have optimus. If you only have one nvidia card in the output, please follow instruction below.\nFirst, when booting, hold the SHIFT or press ESC like crazy until the GRUB menu appears. Select the option about \"Recovery\".\nAfter the recovery menu appears, go to the option that gives you the chance to go to the terminal with root privileges.\nAfter going to the terminal add the Xorg Edges PPA. Why this PPA?, Because on some machines I have worked on, the solution is the specific drivers and xorg version found in this PPA.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nNow the following line, which is the one to install a specific driver, depends totally on the video card you are using.\nThis will literally vary, for example, if you have an Nvidia 730m from HP DV 6000 for example, the only driver that will work correctly will be the oldest one. This is, the Nvidia 173 packages.\nIf you have a more up to date model, then you can test the 304, 310 or 313 series.\nsimply do ONE of the following and reboot afterwards to see if it worked:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-173 - For very old models ranging from 5xxx to 9xxx\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-304 - For old/new models ranging from 6xxx and up\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-310 - For new models\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-313 - For newest models\nAfter executing one of those, simply do sudo reboot\nOne of those will, after rebooting, fix all problems. Unity and Compiz should work correctly. The only thing left would be that, if after opening the Nvidia Panel you get an error about some missing file, simply go to a terminal and sudo nvidia-xconfig, then reboot again.\nThis is the quickest way to solve this, although,adding the specific Nvidia model would help narrow down the package you need to install. I can confirm this in 12.04, 12.10 and 13.04 with about 10 computers that happen to have the same problem since I encounter it a couple of months back.\n", "Q: libnl1.1-6 /netlink/genl/genl.h no such directory I'm trying to compile hostapd, and for that it needs the headerfile genl.h which is supposed to be a part of the libnl1 library (I searched around, the best I got was a recommendation to update libnl1.1)\nSomehow that headerfile is not available on the system anywhere, I checked some include folders and used\nlocate genl.h\n\nbut got no result.\n\nA: The /usr/include/netlink/genl/genl.h header file is contained in the libnl-dev package.\nThe latest version in the repositories is 1.1-7.\nsudo apt-get install libnl-dev will also install the libnl1 library as a dependency.\n", "Q: How do I fix an error in my apt sources list? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I fix this “E:Type ‘*’ is not known on line * in source list …” update error? \n\nI type sudo sh -c 'echo \"[some repository]\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list, but, then I get this message:\nbash: /etc/apt/sources.list: Permission denied` \n\nAnd it doesn't work.\nAnd now, when I type sudo apt-get update or open the Update Manager, the system just shows me the error message:\nE: Type '[some repository]' is not known on line 62 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list \nE: The list of sources could not be read.**\n\nOr:\ncould not initialize the package information\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Your problem is not bad so do not worry, simply do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the file sources.list\nsudo rm -fr /etc/apt/sources.list \n\n*Run the update process.

This setup will allow me to create a music bot of sorts when I play audio into the line that is the input of teamspeak. This setup is easily achieved through Virtual Audio Cable on Windows.

My Facebook chat bar is not rendering properly. When I scroll down my news feed the chat bar appears distorted. \n\nI have cleared the cache, and the problem still persists. \n\nA: I have run into that problem as well. The way I solved it was by clearing out my application data and installing a beta version of Chrome. If you're having the same problem I used to have, try going to YouTube and clicking the \"Show More\" button for a video - it wouldn't render properly.\nTo clear chrome's application data, first make sure Chrome is not running (open this webpage in Firefox or something else). We're going to be backing up the data just in case something goes awry. Open up a terminal and run this command: mv ~/.config/google-chrome ~/.config/google-chrome.bkup.\nTry using Google Chrome and seeing if the problem persists.  Don't worry, your bookmarks and things are safe in that backup or in the cloud if you're using Google Synchronization.\nIf the problem still persists, we can try installing the Google Chrome Beta. Google Chrome continually has three releases at a time: stable, beta, and development. Stable is designed for the general public, beta is for people who want a sneak peek at new features, and development is for people who want to live on the edge. I'm on the development version right now.

I see there is answers for ubuntu 10.04, but mine is 12.10. I've tried uninstalling software in ubuntu software center, but with no success, giving me a error in the uninstalling process, telling me that it can't be uninstalled. What do I do to rectify this? Please asssit me\n\nA: Welcome to Ubuntu!\nOne thing to realize is that your hard drive can be logically split up into smaller pieces. These pieces are called partitions. There are many advantages and disadvantages to partitioning, but that is a topic for another time. Just realize that this means that installing and removing apps will not affect the boot volume (most of the time).\nBased on what you've said, you have your a separate partition which your computer uses to start up from called the \"boot volume\". You may have residual kernels and other files on there that are taking too much space. As long as you have a normal Ubuntu installation, these commands can be pretty safely run:\nWhile booted into that computer, run this command:\ndpkg -l 'linux-*' | sed '/^ii/!d;/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\(.*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/d;s/^[^ ]* [^ ]* \\([^ ]*\\).*/\\1/;/[0-9]/!d' | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge. \nThis will clear out the unused kernels and initrd's that you are not using.\n(Adapted from this question that is similar)\n", "Q: Is there any \"windows-family-safety\"-like feature available in Ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I restrict my kids' computing time?\nWhat is the best way to restrict access to adult content? \n\nIs there any \"windows-family-safety\"-like feature available in Ubuntu?

It is not able to stop nonsense images (and at times videos) brought  up by search engines, for example.\n\nA: The only thing i could find except of OpenDNS is DansGuardian but its bit more complicated to work wit as Windows Family Safety.\n", "Q: Cronjob for security updates? I'm having trouble creating a cronjob for automatic security updates on my ubuntu server 12.04.\nI separated the security sources into a different file, and then did this from within a cronjob:\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\napt-get -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist=\"security-sources.list\" -o Dir::Etc::sourceparts=\"-\" update -y\napt-get -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist=\"security-sources.list\" -o Dir::Etc::sourceparts=\"-\" upgrade -y\n\nBut I'm getting all kind of weird messages in the log:\nExample 1:\ndebconf: unable to initialize frontend: Dialog\ndebconf: (TERM is not set, so the dialog frontend is not usable.)\ndebconf: falling back to frontend: Readline\ndebconf: unable to initialize frontend: Readline\ndebconf: (This frontend requires a controlling tty.)\ndebconf: falling back to frontend: Teletype\ndpkg-preconfigure: unable to re-open stdin:\n\nExample 2:\nUnpacking replacement python-apport ...\nPreparing to replace apport 2.0.1-0ubuntu15 (using .../apport_2.0.1-0ubuntu15.1_all.deb) ...\nstop: Job failed while stopping\ninvoke-rc.d: initscript apport, action \"stop\" failed.\n\nExample 3:\nUnpacking replacement dh-apparmor ...\nProcessing triggers for ureadahead ...\nProcessing triggers for man-db ...\ndebconf: unable to initialize frontend: Dialog\ndebconf: (TERM is not set, so the dialog frontend is not usable.)\ndebconf: falling back to frontend: Readline\ndebconf: unable to initialize frontend: Readline\ndebconf: (This frontend requires a controlling tty.)\ndebconf: falling back to frontend: Teletype\nProcessing triggers for shared-mime-info ...\n\nAfter receiving these logs in my email inbox, I logged in via ssh and saw this:\n44 packages can be updated.\n24 updates are security updates.\n\nSo I guess it didn't work.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: Not really an answer to your scripting problem, but I recommend using the unattended-upgrades  package. It is specifically designed to do just that. You don't have to worry about updating at a peak hour, because unattended-upgrades is run with a random delay (max 30 minutes) because otherwise the servers are being crushed.\nIf you still want to change the time your updates are done, it is useful to know that the unattended-upgrades is in cron.daily. You can change when cron.daily is executed by editing the /etc/crontab file, for more information see this question.\n\nIf you want more information about setting up automatic updates in general (including some pointers on how to write your own cron job) see the Ubuntu help page on AutomaticSecurityUpdates.\n", "Q: My user password is not accepted when connecting to a wireless network When I installed my Ubuntu 12.04, I was never asked to enter the root password, therefore I assumed it was the same with my user password. Now, when I want to connect to a wireless, my root password is required. At entering my user password I'm told it's the wrong one. How do I reset my root password?\n\nA: The root user does not have a password by default in Ubuntu. Instead, your normal user gains root privileges through sudo or PolicyKit, entering the normal user's password.\nYou may have forgotten your user's password, or your user may not have sufficient rights to gain root privileges. If both are true, see this question: How do I reset a lost administrative password?\nYou shouldn't need root privileges to connect to a wireless network, though. Make sure \"Available to all users\" is unticked in the settings of the wireless connection.\nLike Ari Malinen said, your user also has a keyring with a different password. By default, it is set to the same password as the user, but if you change the user's password, the keyring's password won't change with it. Run seahorse to view your keyring.\nAnother issue might be that you are actually being asked for the wireless network's password, which is completely independent from your user's password or your keyring password.\n\nA: You can set new root password with sudo passwd. If you get prompted for keyring password it doesnt mean the root password. Keyring has its own password.\n", "Q: aptitude (apt-get) always crashes I'm using Ubuntu Quantal.

I would like to keep my Linux partitions and install Windows 8 (currently have XP) to another partition.\nI tried it on another computer, where I had a Linux partition, but didn't need to keep it. There was also an XP partition, but that wasn't good enough for Win8. The Windows 8 partitioner is... not very good and only allowed me to create a new Windows partition to install to after deleting all previous partitions.\nAny ideas how I could prepare the partition setup in such a way that Windows 8 would just use some of the ready made partitions and leave my Ubuntu install alone?\n(Sorry if dup, could only find ones for doing it the other way.)\nUpdate:\nThe error I get is 0x803000024. Google returns results where the \"solution\" is always either to unplug all other drives (I got this with only one HDD) or remove all partitions (which I'm trying to avoid).\n\nA: By default the Windows installer creates 2 partitions, one small \"System Reserved\" and a big one where you install windows and where the rest of files go. You can force it to use only one partition by creating it beforehand by using for example gparted . You need to make sure that it is a ntfs primary partition.\nNow if you start windows setup, point to the partition you made beforehand and it should install without partitioning anything.\n\nA: Ok, I managed to solve this in the end. I'm not sure the following are all strictly required, but it's what worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the target drive is the first, numbered 0 in the Win8 installer. Switch drive order via BIOS or swapping SATA connectors if necessary.\n\n*Make sure no GPT drives are connected if installing to MBR drive. Presumably vice versa.\n\n*Remove/don't create the target partition, leave empty space where you want it.\n\n*In the installer, don't create a partition, but choose the empty space and click next. Necessary partition(s) will be automatically created.\n\n", "Q: How can I launch Disk Utility after installing it? I'm trying to run gnome-disk-utility.

A simple single quote (') should have been used here probably.\n\n*The hashes (#) are your chosen delimiter, a good alternative to the common forward slash (/) as your match is about this same character and this avoids the need for escaping.\n\n*The pattern in the command s/regexp/replacement/ is a standard one as mentioned in the manpage, among many others: man 1 sed:\n\ns/regexp/replacement/\nAttempt to match regexp against the pattern\n  space. If successful, replace that portion matched with replacement.\n  The replacement may contain the special character & to refer to that\n  portion of the pattern space which matched, and the special escapes\n  \\1 through \\9 to refer to the corresponding matching\n  sub-expressions in the regexp.\n\n\n*rexexp in the above is a commonly used abbreviation for regular expressions.\n\n*The regular expression ^//[ \\t]test$ matches lines starting (^) with two forward slashes, followed by a space or a tab character, followed by the exact sequence test and a line ending ($).\n\n*The g flag is to do this operation in a global way as explained here.\n\n*An input file is missing and should be given after the Sed-command.\n\n\nA: You do not have to use forward slashes as separator. In fact, I recommend using other separators like comma or hashes for readability.\n-i is also your friend, but only use it if you know for sure it is correct. In this case, I would do something like:\nsed -r 's,^//[ \\t]*(.+),\\1,' file.conf | less\n\nI use -r here for extended regexp, so I do not have to escape the parentheses. Furthermore, it allows me to use the plus operator which means \"one or more occurrences\". The following expression would be equivalent:\nsed 's,^//[ \\t]*\\(..*\\),\\1,' file.conf | less\n\n(one dot to match at least one character followed by zero or more of any character)\nAfter I am sure that the replacement is correct (type slash followed by your keywords in less for searching), I close less by typing q and navigate to the previous history entry by pressing the Up key. I then delete | less and type -i to proceed with the replacement:\nsed -r 's,^//[ \\t]*(.+),\\1,' file.conf -i\n\nIf you want to gain a deeper understanding of sed, I can recommend you reading the info page of sed which is more extended than the manual page:\ninfo sed\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu system is broken after accidentally uninstalling many packages I accidentally removed all the packages starting with the name jpeg with:\nsudo apt-get remove jpeg*\n\nThis screwed up a lot of things, removed Unity, Firefox, Flash player etc.\nI somehow managed to recover the desktop and unity but then a lot of things are still buggy. For example .rpm files and .tag.gz just won't open up at all.\nWhat I want is a way to fix everything that's amiss. Something that is the equivalent of a 'repair installation' with a windows disc.\nAny tips, anyone?\n\nA: You can install the ubuntu-desktop task:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^\n\nThis will install all the packages of the standard Ubuntu Desktop you have removed. It won't restore packages you had installed that are not part of the standard desktop (i.e. it will reinstall Unity and Firefox, but not Flash player).\nTo install those packages, you can look into /var/log/apt/history.log and see exactly what you had removed.\nNote: installing the ubuntu-desktop^ task is not the same as installing the ubuntu-desktop package. The first will give APT some hints to resolve dependencies involving virtual packages, the latter will give APT the freedom to choose packages (and will end up installing useless stuff like ubiquity).\nWhy has the problem happened? apt-get remove jpeg* will not remove all packages starting with jpeg. It will instead remove all packages containing jpe in their name. This is because apt-get works with regular expression, so that jpeg* means: everything containing jpe followed by zero or more g.\n\nA: The best way for you to fix this problem might be to reinstall Ubuntu. (You should back up your documents first, even if you plan to reinstall without reformatting.)\nIf you do want to try to fix the system in place, then look at the package manager's log files to see what packages were removed, and reinstall them:\n\n\n*\n\n*/var/log/dpkg.log (full information, but hard to read)\n\n*/var/log/apt/history.log (abbreviated by will tell you every package removed or otherwise modified - likely your best bet)\n\n*/var/log/apt/term.log (if you removed the packages with apt-get in the terminal, this should show what you saw then, including lists of what packages were going to be removed - so this might be the best way)\n\n\nReinstalling just packages whose names start with jpeg won't work, because many (almost certainly most) of the packages that were removed were removed because they relied on those packages.\nIn the future, I recommend carefully checking the consequences of uninstalling a package. If you're working from the command-line, you'll always be notified. (Unless you use the -y option, in which case, usually not. I recommend against using that option unless you know what you're doing, especially for removals.)\nOne way to check the consequences of a package management operation carried out with apt-get, without risking them happening, is to run apt-get -s instead of sudo apt-get. This merely simulates the action specified, and reports what packages are would be affected as a result and how.\n\nA: I run sudo apt-get purge wine* on Ubuntu 15.10, so no graphical interface on boot only terminal login option.\nAs Eliah Kagan suggested I used info from /var/log/apt/history.log\nI run nano on history.log and made a simple script that contained sudo apt-get install on all purged packages I found at line :\nPurge: evolution:amd64 (3.16.5-1ubuntu3.1), libtotem-plparser18:amd64 (3.10.5-1) ...... etc\n\nBut first I had manually to remove text between all : and ,\nincluding the : ,\nat this step a new script would be helpful because the packages were hundreds.\nafter that I run the script and removed a few Unable to locate packages (which I had manually installed).\nrun the script again and thats it. Everything is working fine ... luckily\n\nA: Install the ubuntu-desktop  package\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nIt will install necessary packages for your system.\n\nA: Here is a small python script where you can write the (unusable) package string from your mass uninstall that is on /var/log/apt/history.log. It will output a string that you can copy paste into the apt-get install command in order to easily install all the removed packages.\nimport re\n\napt_str = u\"INSERT YOUR PACKAGE STRING HERE, BETWEEN THE QUOTES\"\n\nmatch =  re.findall(r'([\\w\\d\\.-]+).+? \\(.+?\\)', apt_str)\nprint \" \".join(match)\n\n\nA: I accidentally removed libssl1.0.0 and my machine was crippled.

The Windows machine shares a folder with the Ubuntu machine via CIFS and the Ubuntu machine mounts the shared folder automatically on startup thanks to this line in /etc/fstab file:\n//<remotehost>/<sharename> <localsharepath> cifs soft,uid=1000,username=<remoteusername>,password=<remotepassword> 0 0\n\nFile sharing through the mount works fine until there is a need to resume the Ubuntu virtual machine after it was paused or to restore it from a snapshot. This typically happens after the Windows host machine was restarted or started after a nightly shutdown.\nAfter Ubuntu is resumed, the folder that contains the mount of the shared folder does not list any items. The Nautilus window just hangs for a long time completely empty with \"Loading...\" in its bottom right corner, despite of the fact that there are lots of other folders and files in that folder to show.\nRestarting the Ubuntu machine does help but it isn't practical: Ubuntu takes forever to shut down, it just hangs on one of those final command line screens desperately waiting for something (when the mount is accessible, there is no such problem). For now, the only option is to power off Ubuntu brutally and then power it back on in order to be able to access the mount, which, of course, is not practical either.\nMy guess is that when some CIFS/Samba communication parameters get changed (after Windows is restarted) the restored image of the Ubuntu virtual machine somehow fails to catch up.\nEven with VMware Tools installed on the Ubuntu machine, the VMware's shared folder feature, which could serve as an alternative, doesn't work for Ubuntu 12 (and many other Linux distros). But even if it did, CIFS/Samba sharing would still be required for file sharing with other virtual machines.\n\nA: 1. umount -f\nThis is not a solution nor work around, but a procedure (an annoying one).\nAfter VM resume, do not try to view the share drive with Nautilus or any program. Do not do ls to it. Any kind of access will trigger a 5min timeout and make the share busy. Just do the umount -f before anything.\n    umount -f <localsharepath>\n\n-f Force unmount (in case of an unreachable server).\nAs long as the share is not busy, this will unmount the share immediately without triggering the 5min cifs timeout.\nThis is definitely not ideal, but it does not require rebooting and the share can be mount again right away.\n2. Change smbfs to cifs with defaults\n//<remotehost>/<sharename> <localsharepath> cifs defaults,uid=1000,username=<remoteusername>,password=<remotepassword> 0 0\n\nIt is official that smbfs is not being maintained anymore\n\nsmbfs has not been maintained in the last few years.

It always mounts them read-only, regardless of the write-lock switch.  This is observed across many SD cards that otherwise work, and crucially occurs for a microSD in an adapter, where the microSD was fine in the microSD slot in the reader.\nAnyone got any ideas as to what's going on and how I can fix it?\n\nA: It sounds to me to be a permissions issue. I've come across this myself with my Linux Mint 14 (Cinnamon) install, which I believe is based on Ubuntu 12.10.\nFirst thing to do is to check the permissions on the hardware device mounting your card. You'll need to find the device name. To do this run the following command:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nYour device will probably be something along the lines of /dev/sdb1, in my case the SD Reader was /dev/mmcblk0p1.\nNext you need to get the permissions on this device:\nsudo ls -l /dev/mmcblk0p1\n\nReplace \"/dev/mmcblk0p1\" with your device location.\nThe output will look something like this:\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 179, 1 Feb 3 21:58 /dev/mmcblk0p1\n\nThis tells us the device is owned by User 'root' and group 'disk'\nYou need to be a member of group 'disk' to be able to write to the SD card.\nYou can check which groups your a member of with \ngroups username\n\nIn my case I was not a member of the 'disk' group, I rectified this with \nsudo usermod -G disk --append username\n\nThis adds the group 'disk' to your user's groups, which should allow you to now read & write to the SD card\n\nA: Get hold of a PC running windows, download a program called SD Formatting, install and reformat the SD card, making sure the option is set to \"ON\", it will then be recognised on a Linux machine! without the read only option.\n\nA: USE:\ndosfsck -l -t /dev/sdb\nRemove dirty bit (y)\nAnswer Yes for ALL\n\nA: In my case Ubuntu auto-mounted the SD Card into a directory it created that didn't have write permissions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Once mounted (accessible but read-only), find the mount point: /media/{username}/{sd-card name}\n(in my case this was: /media/andrew/SDCard - you can find this by right-clicking on the drive, selecting 'Properties' and looking for 'Mounted on', or by typing mount -l in a terminal)\n\n*Open a terminal and type the following: sudo chmod 777 /media/{username}/{sd-card name}\ne.g. sudo chmod 777 /media/andrew/SDCard\nThe SD card is now writable\n\nA: Open terminal by hitting Alt+Ctrl+T and run:\nsudo mount --options remount,rw /dev/sdd\n\nReplace /dev/sdd with your SDHC drive, you can find it using fdisk -l.\n\nA: I've had this problem. I noticed other devices were able to write to the SD card.\nIt turned out to be a bad SD card adapter (the kind with the ro/rw switch).\n", "Q: How do I restore previous packages after a failed update? I recently upgraded my 12.10 installation on my Alienware m11x laptop, and lost both my network cards (wired and wireless network). How do I get them back? I would like a solution that doesn't involve going to my work computer and downloading files on a USB stick to get on the laptop; instead I would like to see a solution where the partial upgrade is reverted back to what was functioning before, so I can retry the upgrade.\nThe upgrade was aborted halfway through because the network went down and/or because the laptop was running out of batteries.

This is the total absolute space. This number will approximate the size shown in the results of fdisk -l for the partition which you're reviewing in the df results.\nUsed+Avail provides the total effective space and excludes the 5% reserved space. This is the space you can actually work with.\nSo nothing is missing. The disparity between Size and Used+Avail totals in df's output represents the 5% reserved space.\nFree space not accounted for in df's output\nIf you're scratching your head thinking \"But I deleted that file(s), why can't I see the additional space in df?!?\", here's why:\nIf you delete a large file(s) but the process for it hasn't been terminated, this \"free\" space won't be reflected in the results of df.\nsudo lsof +L1 will identify deleted files still showing a PID.\n", "Q: What are the corresponding commands in Ubuntu?

You execute them (without sudo) in a Terminal window after you have downloaded the source code, etc.\n\nA: Some commands in Ubuntu/Linux are not intended to be used by normal users (only administrators)\nWhen this is necessary simply prefix the command with sudo for a detailed explanation see here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo \nHowever, the commands you have should not need sudo and will run without it.\n", "Q: Why can't I read encrypted DVDs after installing libdvdread4? I have already installed libdvdread4 and I still get the message:\n\nCould not read DVD.

For your convenience, Ubuntu includes a nice metapackage to install most libraries and codecs to watch media: Ubuntu Restricted Extras .\nThis does not include libdvdcss2 from the Medibuntu repository yet. It's not included in Ubuntu for legal reasons as mentioned on the Ubuntu Wiki: RestrictedFormats/PlayingDVDs. See this answer on how to enable the Medibuntu repository and how to install this package.\nIn case you're still having problems playing DVDs and you have both libdvdread4 and libdvdcss2 installed, see this relevant question: Why does DVD playback still not work after installing libdvdcss2?, specifically this answer in it about setting the region code on your DVD player.\nIn case you're running an official derivative of Ubuntu, this might be relevant as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu and Lubuntu restricted extras/addons?\n", "Q: Unity-Tweak-Tool is not starting from Ubuntu Dash I've installed the tool unity-tweak-tool, but I couldn't start it from Dash.\nI can launch it from terminal though.

For example, this alias:\nalias hvlc='vlc --http-port 54444'\n\nwill make\nhvlc -v /path/to/my/movie.mkv\n\nto become\nvlc --http-port 54444 -v /path/to/my/movie.mkv\n\nIf you like the alias, install it permanently:\necho \"alias hvlc='vlc --http-port 54444'\" >> ~/.bash_aliases\n\nThe default ~/.bashrc file installed for users in Ubuntu will source the ~/.bash_aliases file by default.\nMore about aliases in an earlier answer of me.\nAbout your script\nIt's not passing the arguments to the vlc command as given to the \"parent\" Bash script. To fix this, make the line\nvlc --http-port 54444 $@\n\nThe $@ is the Bash magic for \"all arguments\".

I'm not good at scripting, but I'm pretty good in terminal. My system is an Ubuntu server 12.04.\n\nA: Sure you can.\nThe script might look something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Set permissions\nchmod 755 /home/user/Downloads/*\n\n# Move files\nmv /home/user/Downloads/* \"/home/user/New Location/\"\n\nSave this as something like /home/user/download-script.sh and make sure to run chmod u+x /home/user/download-script.sh so it can be executed.\nTo have this executed periodically you could use cron. Enter crontab -e and create an entry like this:\n0 * * * * /home/user/download-script.sh\n\nThis would lead to the script being executed every hour exactly (so, say 1:00 am, 2:00 am, etc.).\nYou can expand on this of course. Depending on whether there might be folders in you Downloads directory, you might want to add -R to the chmod-command to make changes recurse into those directories for example. Hope this helps :).\nNote: You might want to be careful about when you use 755 as far as permissions go! Does everybody really need to execute those files? Maybe something like 764 is enough already.\n", "Q: May I use UbuntuOne to share files from my business? Me (and my partners) have developed a point & click adventure game.

I know generally the answer is \"use a PPA\", but separate from this... \nWhat is the Ubuntu policy on compatibility across versions of Ubuntu for a given architecture? For example, if a binary in a package is built on 10.04 LTS and the same libraries exist in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, does Ubuntu guarantee compatibility? Are there any guidelines for ISVs?\nI did search quite a bit and find references about compatibility to LSB, other distributions, etc. I'm not finding a document that describes across Ubuntu release versions.\n\nA: What makes a binary package incompatible with a library is an API or ABI break.\n\n\n*\n\n*An API break occurs when the interface offered by the library changes in a way that is no longer compatible with the previous version. An example is the addition or the removal of an argument from a method signature.\nAPI breaks generally require you to adapt your software to the new interface and are avoided as much as possible by library developers.\n\n*An ABI break occurs when the size or the alignment of data types change, or the low-level conventions (such as calling conventions) change. An example is modifying a function's parameter type from int to size_t. ABI breaks generally are introduced just by bug fixes or by changes to the API.\nABI breaks require you just to recompile your program with the newest library headers.\nHaving said that, what's the Ubuntu policy on API and ABI breaks?\n\n\n*\n\n*Newer Ubuntu releases try to offer always the latest software, including the latest software libraries.\n\n*Newer Ubuntu releases try to be as much backward-compatible as possible. For example, Ubuntu offers both GTK+2 and GTK+3 at the same time.\n\n*Once an Ubuntu release is made, it is frozen, in the sense that only important bug fixes can reach the archive for that release (there are exceptions and special cases regarding this rule, but such exceptions are limited to a small set of applications).\n\n*Across updates of a single Ubuntu releases, there are no chances of API breaks. This is implied by the \"only bugfixes\" policy.\n\n*As I previously said, some bugfixes can introduce ABI breaks. Whilst being this a rare case, this is possible and if an ABI break is necessary to fix an important bug, it will be introduced.\n\n*Across Ubuntu major releases, both API and ABI breaks may be introduced. This is because tries to offer always the newest software.\nLong story short: whether your program will work across Ubuntu releases really depends on the libraries it uses and the policies around them. Also, you cannot be sure whether your package will be compatible across Ubuntu release updates.\nThat was the most technical part. Having said this important preface we can fight the problem from a different point of view: consider that 1. many standards exists, 2. free software tries to respect the standards as much as possible, and 3. most libraries (even small and unimportant ones) will very unlikely change their API/ABI across releases.\nSo, feel free to offer a single binary package for multiple Ubuntu version, but keep an eye on the changelogs. Also, remember to be clear about your package dependencies: e.g. do not say that it depends on GTK+3, but clearly state the ranges (from 3.X to 3.Y). This will help your users prevent serious mistakes.\n\nA: I might be a little off but let me say what little I know about this. I will use as an example the package nvidia-313 with version 313.18-0ubuntu1~xedgers~raring2\nAt the basic level, when a package is created for a specific Ubuntu version it hold:\n\n\n*\n\n*Architecture to which it was made for (eg: 32 Bit, 64 Bit)\n\n*For what release it was made for (eg: 12.04, 12.10, raring, oneric..)\n\n*What specific version that package is (In my example above you can see raring2, which would mean is either the 3rd version of it if starting from 0 or the 2nd one if starting from 1. This of course depends on the PPA I used and what the maintainer had in mind)\n\n\nWhat does all of this guarantee. It guarantees that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The package will work \"correctly\" for that specific Ubuntu version, with that specific architecture. This is assuming the libraries that might be used by the package were not manually changed or otherwise tampered with in a clean environment.\n\n*The package will know for what architectures an version it is. If it is used in another different one, it will give you a warning or simply fail to install.\n\n*Most PPA developers and main repositories of Ubuntu will have a version of a package. It might be the same version (Like an Nvidia 313 for 13.04, 12.10, 12.04...) but when it was packaged, it used specific versions of some other packages (Dependencies or pre-depends) and some specific versions of some libraries it needed for that version of Ubuntu. Hence seeing the same package for different Ubuntu versions.\nWill it work if used on a future or older version to the one it was made for, most like not. Some cases it will but at least it will give you a warning. In most of this cases it really depends on the dependencies of said package, since, if it used some libraries for example in 12.04 that have not changed or changed a little when 13.04, this package might even still work correctly on 13.04 (Even if it was made for 12.04), assuming of course it is at least the same architecture to avoid other problems.\nTo get to a specific question you are making:\n\nif a binary in a package is built on 10.04 LTS and the same libraries\n  exist in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, does Ubuntu guarantee compatibility?\n\nIf the same libraries exist in both, 10.04 and 12.04, with the same version, same architecture (And same pre-dependencies, versions of it, etc..), then it is my believe the package will work in both versions of Ubuntu. Now, this is not very likely since the speed at which any Linux distro changes over a period of a couple of months is huge. \nMany libraries change, many updates are made, many improvements are added. So something that did not exist in 10.04 for example, might exist in 12.04 that will eliminate the need for, for example, using less libraries (Like if a packaged used 12 libraries in 10.04, but in 12.04 it would only need 2 to accomplish the same objective). This is also taking into consideration, changes made to the tools that compile and package each app. Many new techniques appear every year, many ways to optimize packages, compress them, read them, etc..\nSo, basing all of this on my little knowledge, I would guess, the more time exists between a package on different versions of Ubuntu, the less probable a guarantee will exist that the package will work between both Ubuntu versions.\n", "Q: Where to install Netbeans I'm planning on installing Netbeans 7.2.1 on my Ubuntu 12.10. So far I've already installed JDK 7u11 without any problems and already downloaded Netbeans from Oracle site.\nMy question is this: Where should I install Netbeans? Should I accept the default /usr/local/netbeans-7.2.1 or should I change this path to my /home?\nI'm questioning because someone told me not to install it in the default proposed installation path because later on I’ll be more than likely to run into permissions problems down the line. Working with Netbeans I would not have permissions to write in that folder thus disabling me from adding Libraries to my projects, installing and uninstalling plugins to the IDE, and even with Glassfish server configuration.\nI've googled in order to cast a light on my doubts to no avail. The only thing I found was this thread at Netbeans forum which brought even some more doubts.\nCan anyone help me?\n\nA: You don't need to run the installer using sudo and you don't need to install it in a system folder, such as /usr/local/. Just run the installer normally and choose to install it in your home directory. If you don't want the netbeans and glassfish folders cluttering up your home folder, you can install them in a sub-folder in your home folder, such as local or Library or whatever. \nYou will be able to run Netbeans by clicking on the launcher it creates. However, if you want to run it from the command line at all, you will need to add the Netbeans' bin folder to the system path. You can do this by opening your .bashrc file in a text editor and adding this line at the bottom (modified according to where you installed Netbeans):\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/netbeans-7.2.1/bin\n\n\nA: If you are going to be the only user on the machine running NetBeans you should not run installer as a root user. \n $ chmod u+x ~/Downloads/netbeans-7.3rc1-linux.sh\n $  ~/Downloads/netbeans-7.3rc1-linux.sh\n\nYou will be prompted to select installation directory defaulting to the user home. Selected installation folder must be writeable by acting user.\nFor details check NetBeans Community Wiki.\nIf you are going to have multiple users launching NetBeans from the same installation then you should run installer as root user and select /user/local as installation directory. It should be default choice when prompted.\nThe NetBeans IDE is engineered to take in account multiple users launching the IDE from the same installation: \n\nNetBeans accommodates this by keeping each user’s personal settings separate from the NetBeans code installation.\nOn Unix systems, settings are kept in a local settings directory created in the user’s home directory the first time NetBeans is run.\n\nAbove quote is from NetBeans: The Definitive Guide.\n\nA: In general, you should install software from the software centre - that way you will get security updates automatically, and it will work without any fiddling or configuration on your part.  \nhttps://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/netbeans/ \n", "Q: How to list available space excluding mount points in home directories?

I set in BIOS as hd0 the first device to boot from think that this is where this file is located. \nThanks\n\nA: I managed to solve my problem by running boot repair for a couple of times. Why it took few times to get it right, I have no clue. I followed these instructions. \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nI am very happy with my ubuntu and windows 8 living next to each other. \n\nA: Your grub.cfg file does show an Ubuntu entry. It's the first one, labeled \"Ubuntu.\" There are also several different Windows entries. My first suggestion is therefore to reboot and look over the menu again; perhaps you've overlooked the Ubuntu entry at the top of the list because of the large number of distinct Windows entries.\nIf Ubuntu really isn't there, then I'm not sure how to fix GRUB -- its configuration files have just become so big, complex, and delicate that I've given up trying to fix their problems. My suggestion is therefore to try something else. Several options are available, the best for your situation likely being Fedora's patched GRUB Legacy and my rEFInd. I'll describe how to set up rEFInd:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Windows, or boot another computer entirely.\n\n*Download the rEFInd bootable CD or USB flash drive image (links are on the rEFInd download page) and prepare an external boot medium.\n\n*Boot using the rEFInd medium you've just prepared. You'll need to use your firmware's built-in boot manager, which is usually accessed via a function key, but which one varies greatly from one computer to another.\n\n*rEFInd should show an option for Windows and at least two for Linux. One of these two Linux options will boot GRUB. Another will show a name of vmlinuz-{version}, where {version} is a version number. Highlight the vmlinuz-{version} option.\n\n*Press Insert or F2 twice. You'll see a text-mode line editor open showing kernel options.\n\n*Add ro root=/dev/sda7 to the boot options and press Enter. Linux should boot.\n\n*In a Terminal, type cd /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot\n\n*Type sudo mv bootmgfw.efi.bkp bootmgfw.efi. This undoes the Boot Repair tool's renaming of Microsoft's boot loader back to its standard name.\n\n*Download the rEFInd Debian package.\n\n*Install the rEFInd Debian package. Double-clicking it may work, or you can type sudo dpkg -i refind_0.6.6-1_amd64.deb.\n\n\nAt this point, when you reboot rEFInd should appear, and you should be able to boot Windows by selecting its option or boot Ubuntu by selecting a vmlinuz-{version} option. (You won't need to add kernel options any more; by installing the Debian package you also configured rEFInd to no longer require this.) Neither boot method relies on GRUB, so whatever its configuration problem is becomes irrelevant.\nOne caveat: Some EFI implementations are broken and won't boot anything but Windows' boot loader. If you've got such a system, then when you reboot, Windows will start. You can work around this by using your external rEFInd boot medium to boot into Linux. You can then open a Terminal and type sudo mvrefind.sh /boot/efi/EFI/refind /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot. This renames the Windows boot loader and moves rEFInd into position to take its place (which is similar to what Boot Repair did with GRUB). With any luck you won't need to do this, though.\n", "Q: Cannot get gsettings set to work at boot using cron, rc.local, or autostart I am trying to \"lock down\" the computer by running a script at boot that turns lock on, lock screen after 10 min and require password, etc. I am using Ubuntu 12.04\nI have tried editing crontab, anacrontab as well as rc.local to either run my script or actually inserted the code from the script into the files and I cannot get anything to work.\nAny ideas?\n* this is the only way I can get the commands to run in a script manually *\n(su - $(logname) -c \"gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled true\")\n\n(su - $(logname) -c \"gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-delay 600\")\n\n(su - $(logname) -c \"gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver ubuntu-lock-on-suspend true\")\n\n(su - $(logname) -c \"gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver user-switch-enabled false\")\n\n* These commands work if entered into terminal manually *\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled true\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-delay 600\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver ubuntu-lock-on-suspend true\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver user-switch-enabled false\n\nI also tried inserting the following code from other posts about using gsettings in cron with no luck:\nDISPLAY=:0 \nGSETTINGS_BACKEND=dconf\nsessionfile=`find \"${HOME}/.dbus/session-bus/\" -type f`\nexport `grep \"DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\" \"${sessionfile}\" | sed '/^#/d'`\n\nAlso I double checked my script was executable and created /home/username/.config/autostart/screenlock.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=/path/screenlock.sh\nTerminal=False\nHidden=true\nNoDisplay=true\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName[en_US]=screen lock\nName=screen lock\n\nAlso adding /path/screenlock.sh to bash.rc or .profile do not seem to work as well.\n\nA: Instead of using:\nDISPLAY=:0 \nGSETTINGS_BACKEND=dconf\nsessionfile=`find \"${HOME}/.dbus/session-bus/\" -type f`\nexport `grep \"DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\" \"${sessionfile}\" | sed '/^#/d'`\ntry to use:\nPID=$(pgrep gnome-session)  # instead of 'gnome-session' it can be also used 'noutilus' or 'compiz' or the name of a process of a graphical program about that you are sure that is running after you log in the X session\nexport DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$(grep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS /proc/$PID/environ|cut -d= -f2-)\n\nSee the explanation in my answer here.\n", "Q: How to remove grub2 in favor of another linux installation grub I'm using Arch Linux Windows 7 And Ubuntu on the same machine, I installed first Windows 7 Then Arch Linux and Then Ubuntu.\nThe problem is that the grub 2 on Ubuntu is not recognizing my arch Linux installation, and I can't make it look like the arch Linux grub.\nMy arch Linux installation has a boot partition of about 100mb, it contains the boot stuff of arch, I can make grub 2 on arch Linux recognize the Ubuntu and windows installation so it works better.\nSo I want to remove the grub on Ubuntu so I can avoid problems with two grub installation on the same machine for example when Ubuntu updates grub I don't have to re-install arch Linux grub.\nThanks\n\nA: The last installed OS, which is Ubuntu, normally takes over the bootloading process.\nIt's strange that grub in Ubuntu has failed to detect Arch Linux.\nEdit: The method suggested above by NikTh to mount Arch Linux partition before updating grub might probably be the solution to this problem.\nOtherwise, you have 3 options that I can think of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually entering a grub entry for Arch Linux, which you won't have to enter again if you include it in this file as well: /etc/grub.d/40_custom\n\n*Trying Plop Boot Manager or Rescatux (via a live CD/USB) to boot Arch Linux and re-installing grub there so that it will take over the bootloading process as you wanted.\n\n*Reinstalling Arch Linux so that it takes over the bootloading process as you wanted.\n\n\nA: Try this please \nBoot into Ubuntu and open a terminal  CTRL+ALT+T\nThen mount the partition with Arch Linux .. we assume is /dev/sda5 (you can find it with command sudo fdisk -l) \nmount \nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt \n\nThen update grub \nsudo update-grub\n\nI'm almost certain that Arch Linux recognized now. \nAbove is a workaround , but when the grub be updated again the Arch Linux partition must be mounted otherwise will not recognize it.\nIf you want to make it permanent , you can add the contents of arch linux from /boot/grub/grub.cfg to /etc/grub.d/40_custom\nIf you want to install Arch Linux grub instead of Ubuntu , you can boot in Arch Linux and do \nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nabove command will install Arch's grub in MBR and do not forget to update it \nsudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n", "Q: Maximum brightness is not maximum brightness On my dual boot laptop I noticed that maximum brightness in Ubuntu and Windows 8 is totally different.

I am curious as to what happens when you run\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nif you have custom kernel modules installed.\nAre there hooks to reinstall your custom module? Are the modules completely unaffected by the upgrade?\nI ask this because every time I do an upgrade I'm worried that the modules I've installed from source are going to break. At this moment I haven't had any issues yet, but I'd like to find out more regarding what happens to modules when you do update your kernel via regular updates.\n\nA: This really depends on how this module was installed. The mechanism of DKMS is specifically created for automatic recompiling against the new kernel installed.\nPlain kernel modules are only built for very version they were compiled for and keep working when updates do not break the ABI. However, the Ubuntu updates appear to break the ABI quite frequently and require kernel modules to be recompiled. As this is a very much boring and repetitive task, DKMS was invented to overcome this. It inserts hooks in APT to trigger compiling and installing the new version.\nTo view the current kernel modules installed using DKMS (example):\ndkms status\nnvidiabl, 0.79, 3.5.0-22-generic, x86_64: installed\nnvidiabl, 0.79, 3.7.5-030705-generic, x86_64: installed\nnvidia-current, 313.09, 3.5.0-22-generic, x86_64: installed\nnvidia-current, 313.09, 3.7.5-030705-generic, x86_64: installed\nvboxhost, 4.2.6, 3.5.0-22-generic, x86_64: installed\nvboxhost, 4.2.6, 3.7.5-030705-generic, x86_64: installed\n\nHere you can see I have installed some kernel modules into DKMS, only the nvidiabl one myself, the others were installed by the Nvidia driver package and Virtualbox package.\nThe modules are located (installed) in a specific directory for each kernel version:\n/lib/modules/\n├── 3.5.0-22-generic\n│   ├── build -> /usr/src/linux-headers-3.5.0-22-generic\n│   ├── initrd\n│   ├── kernel\n│   │   ├── arch\n│   │   ├── crypto\n│   │   ├── drivers\n│   │   ├── fs\n│   │   ├── lib\n│   │   ├── net\n│   │   ├── sound\n│   │   └── ubuntu\n│   └── updates\n│       └── dkms\n└── 3.7.5-030705-generic\n    ├── build -> /usr/src/linux-headers-3.7.5-030705-generic\n    ├── initrd\n    ├── kernel\n    │   ├── arch\n    │   ├── crypto\n    │   ├── drivers\n    │   ├── fs\n    │   ├── lib\n    │   ├── mm\n    │   ├── net\n    │   └── sound\n    └── updates\n        └── dkms\n\nIn order to get a custom kernel module with no support provided for DKMS, it needs some \"packaging\" you'll have to do yourself, of you'll have to recompile it yourself everytime. In other words, a \"typical\" ./configure; make; sudo make install will just install one specific kernel module and requires you to recompile it every time.\nIf you fail to do so, the kernel module will simply not be found after an update. It will not look in the old directory and if you would force to load it, it would fail to insert probably. In case the installation overwrote a system default one, it might also load the non-custom one.\nI'm not going to include the DKMS packaging here, as I think I've answered your question by now.\n", "Q: Why did wlan0 device disappear?

Ensure the BIOS doesn't skip tests and disable the splash screen for it, then look for the wireless card when it's booting (hit Pause if it goes too fast to read).\nIf it doesn't show there, see if it's deactivated in the BIOS; if not, there's probably a hardware problem.

I can see the AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS folders, but Movie Player, VLC, and xine wont recognise the content. \nAlso, I checked and libdvdread4 is already installed. \nAny suggestions? \nThanks\n\nA: It is not enough that \"libdvdread4\" just be installed. It must be activated/executed.

I have an Ubuntu file server running SAMBA on my home wifi network. It is set to share a directory under the user \"john\"\nI have a Windows XP desktop connected to the network and it sees the file server just fine. Same goes for a Windows7 laptop PC and a Windows7 desktop which connect through the wifi router. I connect, I enter the user and password and I am off to the races with it.\nMy Ubuntu Thinkpad laptop, on the other hand,  will connect to the wifi network and browse the Internet, but when I attempt to connect to the server, the Ubuntu laptop doesn't find it when I open the directory and click on \"Browse Network\"  The two icons that do display when clicked churn for a while and then display the error message \"Cannot mount volume\" or something like that.\nI see lots of demonstrations and tutorials out there that instruct on how to get a Windows system to connect to an Ubuntu file share, but I have not seen any on how to get two Ubuntu systems to talk.  Can you point me to some documentation or help me understand what I need to do to get my laptop to communicate with my file server?\n\nA: Do you have the Samba client installed on your Thinkpad? Since you're in a mixed environment, your server is sharing via Samba, instead of the Unix-based sharing protocols. This means that if you don't have the Samba client installed, you won't be able to access those shares.\nAdditionally, you might have to also set up your file server to allow your Thinkpad in a similar way you probably set it up for the Windows client.\n", "Q: How to update libpoppler?

How can I make this possible? And which Linux distribution should I use? \nComputer Specs are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD Turion TL-52 (1.6 ghz)\n\n*512 MD Radeon Xpress 1100\n\n*2GB DDR2 RAM\n\n\nA: You can easily run Ubuntu 12.10 on your system!  I have an old compaq with only 1Gb ddr2 RAM, and onboard video.  Used to run vista (very slowly) It runs awesome with Ubuntu!  I browse the web on it all day, play 720p HD vids from youtube, play pandora radio etc.\nYou'll be able to wipe the drive during setup, as long as you're not attached to your data that's on the drive.\nAll you need to do is to get the ISO file, and make a CD with it.  You'll love it!\n\nA: If you really want to be sure that everything is wiped from the disk then you should use DBAN (http://www.dban.org/).\nIt will however overwrite MBR, the partition table, so any installer that you run will have to reinitialize the disk. Any Linux installer will do that for you, but I vaguely remember that old versions of Windows were unable to initialize it (you could of course do it with another tool and restart the Windows installer).\nAs for the Linux of choice, I wonder if you realized that this is an Ubuntu specific site?\n\nA: If I wanted to do what you are suggesting (and I have, several times), I would use another computer you trust to work well. Install unetbootin. There are is a Windows version. Download the disk image (ISO) for the current version of Linux you're considering. For an older machine, I'd recommend Lubuntu. Use unetbootin to create a bootable USB flash drive if your target machine can boot from USB, or burn the ISO to a CD if not. Boot from the USB or the CD. When Lubuntu loads, there should be an \"Install\" icon on the desktop.\nWARNING: Installing any Linux distribution over your old windows will wipe all data unless you choose a dual-boot configuration, but since you can't clean the Windows, it sounds like that's exactly what you want anyway.\nThere's a bit of a learning curve moving from WinXP to any Linux, but not as great as moving from XP to Win8! Lubuntu is pretty easy, a good jump from XP.\nI currently run Ubuntu 12.10 on a new Acer notebook, on my wifes 10 year old desktop, my younger daughter's Acer netbook, and on my older daughter's Toshiba notebook.\nI run Lubuntu 12.10 on an old EEEPC-900 netbook hooked up to the stereo to play Spotify throughout the house, and on an old salvage-build tower in my classroom to run my python-whiteboard. Lubuntu is my clear choice on old equipment!\nHome-built smartboard\n", "Q: Login identity when system sleeps System went to sleep, then asked for a password.  I have tried every password I have ever used.  Does ubuntu require something different.  I loaded this two years ago, last summer.  I do not remember, how do I get it back?\n\nA: I would boot from a System Rescue CD (http://www.sysresccd.org) and mount your filesystem, chroot into it and then change the password.\nThis is done like so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Either run fdisk -l or blkid to identify which disk and partition is your root filesystem. I will assume it is /dev/sda5.\n\n*Mount it with mount /dev/sda5 /mnt. Sometimes it might be necessary to specify which filesystem is used, for example mount -t ext4 /dev/sda5 /mnt.\n\n*Then chroot into it, chroot /mnt. This is done so that the commands that follow is issued from within the filesystem root of your on-disk installation.\n\n*Change the password with passwd chastain or any other user.\nNote that there are many ways in which this procedure can go wrong.

According to this http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-2082752.html it is caused by a buggy broadcom driver. The suggested solution is to manually upgrade to the lastest driver which you can get here: http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php.\nThis worked for me.\n\nA: As work around, just set fake MAC address in your wifi connection settings, in Ubuntu it's called \"cloned MAC address\".\nI had the same error message on my Ubuntu 14.04 after upgrading from 13.10 with Broadcom BCM4313 wireless card, suggested answers didn't work for me, rolling back driver or changing it with different ones like STA and b43 didn't fix the issue.

To install search for pixelize on the Software Center or type on Terminal:\nsudo apt-get install pixelize\n\nDescription from its man page:\n\npixelize is a program that will use many scaled down images to try  to duplicate, as closely as possible, another image.\n\n\nA: Try Andrea Mosaic under Wine, which works perfectly in a GUI and creates awesome Mosaics based on your pictures. \n\nYou simply choose the image that you wish to represent with pictures, add the galleries of pictures that you wish to use for that purpose and with minimal adjustments you'll be able to create amazing images like this one:\n\nLow resolution image, the mosaic is too big.

After you installed Wine download\n  and execute the AndreaMosaic Windows Setup. Click Here for more\n  details about AndreaMosaic under Wine.\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: A very nice program for doing all sorts of photomosaics is in the repositories and is called metapixel. \nInstall from software-center or open terminal and run\nsudo apt-get install metapixel\n\nThe readme is available at the github page or from /usr/share/doc/metapixel/README.gz when it is installed, and it notes that \n\nMetapixel is a program for generating photomosaics.  It can generate\n  classical photomosaics, in which the source image is viewed as a\n  matrix of equally sized rectangles for each of which a matching image\n  is substitued, as well as collage-style photomosaics, in which\n  rectangular parts of the source image at arbitrary positions (i.e. not\n  aligned to a matrix) are substituted by matching images.\n\nThe readme contains full instructions for use, but a useful youtube tutorial for Ubuntu exists, as well as a sort of online gui with which you can construct your command-lines.\nNevertheless, here's an example of how I used metapixel to create a classic photomosaic.\nThere is a perl script that comes with metapixel called metapixel-prepare, and this is very useful for generating the photo tiles that your mosaic image will contain.\nOptions can be found with metapixel-prepare --help, but basically you just have to specify your folder of pictures and your metapixel library folder. \n1) This library folder needs to be created before you run the metapixel-prepare command, so run in terminal \nmkdir metapixel_library\n\n2) Then to generate the tiles from the selected folder, the minimum command would have the form:\nmetapixel-prepare ~/location/of/my/pictures/ ~/metapixel_library \n\nIf you wish metapixel-prepare to recurse through the folders you have to specify -r; if you want the tiles to be a specific size (other than the default 128x128), specify at the end of the command, for example, --width 80 --height 80. \nAs an example, the command I used was:\nmetapixel-prepare -r ~/Pictures/canon/metapixel ~/metapixel_library --width 80 --height 80\n\n3) To construct your photomosaic you must specify the location of this library of tiles, specify the image to be metapixelled and designate an output file (which must be a .png file). The input jpg can be any kind of picture and any size (see note on scale below).\nI used the following commands in my case: \nmetapixel --library ~/metapixel_library --metapixel /home/mike/Pictures/canon/2012_02_05/img_0372.jpg output.png\n\nThe full options for metapixel can be found by entering metapixel --help, and sometimes you may need to use --scale to increase the size of the output image. I didn't in the case above as my input picture was already 4000x3000.  \nThe results will differ according to which pictures you have chosen for your library and your input picture.\nThe process will also take a while if you select thousands of pictures for the mosaic, and will also consume a fair bit of memory. \nBelow is a photomosiac created with my own photos (using the commands above):\n\n:\n\nA: You can create a photo mosaic online on Ubuntu or another platform using PicMyna online service.\nHere's a sample photo mosaic made using this website:\n\ndisclosure: I work for the company that owns PicMyna service.\n", "Q: Is the Alcor AU6371 card reader supported in 12.10 64bit?

I have added a simple command avconv -i %f %f.mp3 to Thunar's custom actions to convert a selected media file to mp3 (in the same folder and with the same name).\n\nWhat would be the command that can be added in the same way that would allow selecting multiple files or an entire folder to convert them to mp3 (with the source's folder and name)?\nI expect them to be converted one by one (not in parallel, that is, not all at the same time) - but I was wandering if that could be done with one context menu command after selecting multiple files.\n\nIt looks like avconv does not support multiple files per input (see comment under here), I am not asking necessarily for a command that includes avconv, but for any other solution.\n\nA: It depends a little, on how Thunar handles multiple files. Basically, you can use parallel (website) to handle a lot of files.\nsudo apt-get install parallel\n\nSo I would start with the following:\nparallel avconv -i '{}' '{}.mp3' ::: %F\n\nBy default, it only does one job at a time. If you want to use multiple CPU cores in parallel, try parallel -j 4 ... for 4 jobs in parallel. Also check out man parallel.\n\nIn order to run it in Thunar's custom actions, this should be embedded like so:\nxfce4-terminal -e \"parallel avconv -i '{}' '{}.mp3' ::: %F\"\n\nTo convert to other audio formats supported by avconv, just replace mp3 with that - but: take into consideration other issues like:\n\n\n*\n\n*flv and mp4 files contain aac audio and converting that to other audio formats may entail unwanted results - more here. If the aac file has about 95 kbps bitrate converting directly to mp3 would work, because the default bitrate for the mp3 would be 192kbps, which is a good option (according to here). If the aac file has a different bitrate, the mp3 should be modified accordingly.\n\n*aac is a lossy format, and converting it to other formats should be considered in the context of the larger issue that converting between lossy formats is not recommendable. Even more, converting from a lossy format to a lossles one is pointless.\n\n*a better option than converting aac to mp3 would be to just extract the aac audio into a m4a container, as described here.\n\nA: This will not stand as accepted answer.\nInitially I was not thinking about a GUI. But, this is a way of doing it too. It will not convert directly, but will add selected files to Soundconverter list. (The main advantage is that supplementary settings are at hand.)\nThe command to be added to custom actions is \n/usr/bin/soundconverter %F\nAppearance conditions: video and audio.\n", "Q: How do I disable IVTV?

Firstly, pardon the chaos. I have an Ubuntu partition that I've shrank in half to install Windows. When I ran Windows and rebooted after updates, there was no boot loader and it automatically chose Windows. I used easyBCD to configure the boot loader and add Ubuntu to the list, but when I tried to boot Ubuntu, I got a blinking white line in the\ntop left corner of a black screen. I redownloaded easyBCD, moved Windows to the top of the list, rebooted and then the only boot option was Ubuntu, the Windows option didn't even appear. I used Ubuntu to change from the Windows boot manager to GRUB2 and none of the ways I've researched to add Windows to GRUB2 have worked for me. Is my best option to just reinstall Ubuntu?\n\nA: Please add your windows entry from grub.cfg, using grub is always the recommended way.\nI would recommend not exploring booting grub from windows loader.\n\nA: Sorry for the late response, I ended up deleting both operating systems and using this method: http://lifehacker.com/5403100/dual+boot-windows-7-and-ubuntu-in-perfect-harmony\nI would've liked to figure it out but I just didn't have the time. From what I gather, in most dual boot situations, one should have Windows installed first so that it's boot loader doesn't erase GRUB2. \n", "Q: I have error message connecting a monitor to my netbook I want to connect my Lenovo S205 Netbook with a 1080p monitor, however the only way to get it to work is by Mirroring the Display.\nI would like to use the top display at 1080p.

In order to use multiply desktops it is necessary to expand the virtual size of your xorg configuration file first.

When I tried to fix the driver by using a generic ATI driver, the computer refused to boot to the desktop on Ubuntu.\nIt also won't let me boot to Windows 8, and gives two errors: \nerror: can't find command 'drivemap' and something about an invalid efi. \nI tried to get to Windows by bypassing the boot in bios, but it booted and a sad-face (literally) came up on Windows for a split second and said \"sorry, windows has to reboot...\" and then reboots to the startup screen that asks which os to use.\nWhen I send Ubuntu into recovery mode, to do anything, it tells me I have to change to read/write mode and then locks up when I said yes.  I had to cold shut down.\nPlease help. I can get to the terminal in Ubuntu but that is all.  How can I remove Ubuntu from my laptop so I can use it again?  \n\nA: Uninstalling an operating system is rather a misconception. You seem to have a computer that is set up to use UEFI. Apart from deleting the partition that contains the OS you want to remove, you should delete the UEFI boot entries, which can be done using efibootmgr in Linux running in UEFI mode or the UEFI Shell running from a USB stick, as well as removing the corresponding files from the EFI system partition.\nEFI's intention was to make things easier, instead it added another layer of complexity.\nIf you don't want to use UEFI and you don't plan on using a harddrive greater than 2TB, the easiest way would be to disable UEFI funtionality, partiton your harddrive with a legacy MBR/MS-DOS partition table and reinstall your prefered operating systems, after you have made your backups of course.\nGoing the other route, I would recommend reading the UEFI related articles on the Arch Linux Wiki and the Ubuntu documentation as you can break many things when fuzzing with the wrong EFI entries.\n\nA: There are ways to uninstall Ubuntu and repair the boot from LiveCDs, such as GParted or boot-repair-disk. As for command line operations, I'm not entirely sure. Even if you did uninstall Ubuntu from within Ubuntu, you would have no way to restore your Windows boot without the Windows repair CD (which you could probably use right now to restore the Windows bootloader) or some other form of live Linux OS.\nIf you can burn a live CD or USB then I recommend using Ubuntu 12.04 live. Install GParted in the live session and delete your Linux partition, then either install boot-repair to boot Windows through GRUB (might not work since there's no Linux partition) or install 12.04.\n", "Q: Why does `sudo passwd root` reset my root password? Is this a security risk? Both in my ubuntu desktop host and virtual machine. I have't login as root for about a month, during which I upgraded the kernel. I found my root password doesn't work anymore. However, by using  sudo passwd root, I can easily reset the root password by current user password. How could this happen? I don't have a problem anymore, just curious about the underline reason for this. \nThank you!\n\nA: No, it's not a security problem. If you have the ability to run sudo commands as root, which users generally do in Ubuntu, you're fine. The idea behind sudo is that you can run commands as root, without logging in as root.\nNot a security problem. Not unusual. The system is working like it's supposed to. Nothing to see here.\n\nA: It is not a big problem, Your user was granted as root.You can create a user that is not granted as root.\nLook at account type, a Administrator can use sudo to become root.\nAdministrator:\n\nStandard:\n\nBut how it actually work? We can find answer at /etc/sudoers (open it as root) \nYou will see \n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nIt means only member of sudo and admin can use sudo to have more permission than a normal user.\nYou may also wants to check /etc/group (open it as root) to know who is in these group.\n\nA: sudo runs commands as a user other than the one currently logged in. Usually you'd use this to run stuff as root, though you can run stuff as other users too.\nSo sudo passwd root tells the system to change the root password, and to do it as though you were root. The root user is allowed to change the root user's password, so the password changes. The system is working as designed.\nThe missing piece of this puzzle is that not everyone is allowed to use sudo. In fact, the way that sudo is configured by default, only one group of users is allowed to do that. The user you created when you installed the system is automatically put into that group, but you can create users who aren't. You can even take yourself out of that group if you really want to. You can even set sudo up so that some users (or groups of users) are only allowed to do certain specific things.\nThat said, it's true that your first user is allowed to do anything as root. This is why sudo asks you for your password. An attacker who gets into your account won't need that the root password to do root-y things, but will still need your password to do them. A lot of attacks don't actually give the attacker your password, so sudo still limits the damage that can be done by those attacks.\n\nA: First of all, sudo executes commands as root, so resetting the actual root password while accessing as root to begin with usually isn't a problem. You already have root access through sudo, so there's little change. (This assumes you don't have a setup that restricts user commands but allows them to sudo passwd ... But that's a configuration issue.)\nSecondly, in order to remotely infiltrate a PC through the use of sudo passwd, you would have to a) trick the user into giving you the user password one way or another (which, again, gives sudo access just as well), or b) have physical access to the machine, in which case \"remote\" probably isn't so true anymore.\nSo, no, there is no direct security risk. Certain (but uncommon and illogical) configurations may create a loophole there, but that's it.\n", "Q: How to check the required dependencies for a package? I want to install the ndiswrapper packages (utils, -dkms and -common) in my Ubuntu 13.04 live-usb. However, since I don't have wi-fi while I'm on the Daily build, I can't install them directly, so I have to return to my default 12.10 installation to download the appropriate packages and dependencies. \nThe package dependencies are listed here:\n\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/ndiswrapper-common\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/ndiswrapper-dkms\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/ndiswrapper-utils-1.9\n\nThough -common and -utils have relatively few dependencies, -dkms has quite a few, and most of these have their own dependencies. I also realize that many of these dependencies are installed by default in 13.04. \nSo I was wondering if there is some way to quickly determine only the packages I would actually need to download and install to get ndiswrapper working in 13.04. Something like a simulation of an \"apt-get install\" in 13.04 that would output all the missing packages for a default installation. Thanks!\n\nA: *\n\n*Install the devscripts package.\n\n*Run chdist create raring\n\n*Edit ~/.chdist/etc/apt/sources.list and enter your sources as they would be for raring (eg. deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu raring main universe restricted multiverse)\n\n*Run chdist apt-get raring update\n\n*Run chdist apt-get raring --print-uris install ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper-dkms ndiswrapper-utils-1.9\nThis will give you a list of URIs to download, which you can transfer and then use dpkg -i on directly.\n", "Q: Can I symlink a Dropbox folder? I've just installed Ubuntu 12.10 as a dual boot with Windows 8. I'd already had windows up and running for a few months before installing Ubuntu, so in order to have my files accessible from both OS's, I have the windows partition automatically mounted, and the folders in /home symlinked to their windows counterparts.\nThis is working really well except for my Dropbox folder. The dropbox folder created by the windows side is accessible by the linux side, but obviously it doesn't sync any more. The same problem arises the other way round.\nCan anyone think of a way around this, to get both sides syncing the same data? Is it possible to point dropbox to a pre-existing folder instead of having it create a new folder?\nThanks\n\nA: Dropbox should not have any problems using a symlinked \"Dropbox folder\".\nMake sure the dropbox folder on your win partition is synced and uptodate.\ndropbox stop\ncd /home/$user/Dropbox\ntar cvfz /home/$user/backup.tar.gz *\nrm -R /home/$user/Dropbox\nln -s /pathtowindowspartition/User/Dropbox /home/$user/Dropbox \ncd /home/$user/Dropbox\ndropbox start\n\n\nA: AFAIK, yes. This is sort of an \"advantage\" to Dropbox for Linux. Windows' \"links\" are actually .lnk files, which are windows-only. (I'm currently wondering how Windows handes Linux's symbolic links, but that's another story...)\nIt allows you to easily back up things to your Dropbox folder that would not normally be able to be backed up, such as ~/.minecraft. You can simply make the link to a game's config folder, or anything else, and it will work.\nAs for it pointing to a preexisting folder, you get to choose your Dropbox folder location during the setup. If that's not going to work (e.g., you don't want to reinstall it,) a symlink always works.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Terminal Colouring I got this snippet of code from @mdo (http://markdotto.com) and optimized it to Ubuntu.

I have a D-Link DWA-160 Wireless adapter, and the current driver (carl9170) has some really, really, really frustrating bugs. (Well, just one, but it's a real showstopper.)\nWhenever I'm in Puppy Linux, this bug doesn't occur. The difference is, Puppy Linux says it's using ar9170. I'd like to use that for Ubuntu and see if it works better there, as well. I'd like to know the exact procedure for doing this.\n\nA: The modinfo on the other Linux distribution shows me it's still on Linux 2.6.33. The driver you refer to is removed in recent Linux versions:\n\ncommit b0006e69615868f3dfdfe2bd64eb11973f1208fc\nAuthor: Christian Lamparter <chunkeey@googlemail.com>\nDate:   Fri Mar 25 20:21:55 2011 +0100\n\n    ar9170usb: purge obsolete driver\n\n\ngit branch -a --contains b0006e69615868\n  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master\n  remotes/origin/linux-3.0.y\n  remotes/origin/linux-3.1.y\n  remotes/origin/linux-3.2.y\n  remotes/origin/linux-3.3.y\n  remotes/origin/linux-3.4.y\n  remotes/origin/linux-3.5.y\n  remotes/origin/linux-3.6.y\n  remotes/origin/linux-3.7.y\n  remotes/origin/master\n\nThis indicates to me that ar9170usb was removed from 3.0 onwards. I think it will be hard to get this module into a recent Ubuntu release.\nSo, taking a step back, getting the newer driver fixed seems a bit more constructive. In case you're on Ubuntu 12.04, try the backported Quantal kernel linux-image-generic-lts-quantal package. If that doesn't fix it or if you're on Quantal already, try a more recent \"mainline\" kernel to see if your issue is fixed \"upstream\". This answer explains how to install pre-built mainline kernels in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Try the suggested workaround in this answer for similar hardware (same chipset). It seems to have fixed it on my system today, also with this DWA-160 adapter. Check it out and see if it helps. I also downloaded the latest firmware file I could find.

But when you do:\nls -R /media/ai/WALKMAN/MUSIC > filename.txt\nThat's just a plain textfile and while things are listed, it is a very long list and very hard to skim through. \nSo I was wondering if it were possible to have the output saved either in an HTML/XML document or a table so it'd be easier to pilfer through the tremendous list?\n\nA: Not possible.\nThe reason is that your shell has settings configured (likely ~/.bashrc) to recognize different commands and outputs and color code accordingly.\nTherefore there is no markup to save and no way to do what you would like. What you can do is use a text editor that contains the same type of rules for color coding, recommend emacs.  \napt-get install emacs\n\nIn terms of saving to another format, you could get infinitely creative here using pipes and redirection, but I do not think this is what you are looking for.\n", "Q: How to get crysis 2 running I am runnung ubuntu 12.04 64bit with nvidea gtx660 the with proprietary driver version 310 installed via additional drivers\nI have tried a variety of things having no succsess \nI have got past the initial padlocked room, but everything was black I could see the objective marker, and the gui with the map thing\nI would like to know the ubuntu version and bit (32 64)\n wine version and bit (32 64)\nany patches\nwinetricks (install order) if known\ninstall method, iso, steam, etc\nthis is for crysis2\n\nA: There's a piece of software called PlayOnLinux which runs on Wine and helps a lot with installing the required dependencies for software that it supports.

I have a AMD Radeon HD 7730m 2gb with a Intel HD 4000, I am currently using the kernel lastest kernel from X-edgers I believe. 3.7 something like that. Anyways, this isn't the problem. I'm sure there's a way to change the level of brightness from the terminal, or even just change the range, cause it looks the be range that isn't enough. In fact, when I try to lower the brightness, it drops but slightly but it doesn't go lower on the bar. If I want to make the screen go brighter, well it can't because it is at the max.\n\nA: Well try this link http://www.refreshit.info/2012/08/solved-brightness-increase-and-decrease.html\nI have fixed the brightness problem ..\n\nA: this is unfortunately no answer to your problem, but i have the same laptop model and i also tried out the 3.7 kernel, because i have problems with the fan which is all the time running at full speed (did you solve that?). i experienced the same thing with the brightness. i swiched back to the 3.5 kernel. there it works fine.\n", "Q: How can I insert an APA style bibliography in a document using LibreOffice? I'm a college student and my teachers ask me to insert APA bibliographies in all of my works. I haven't found any site which has a clear explanation. I've seen this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjTMtEzjD8\nBut what I really want to do is this:\n\n\nIs there some kind of counterpart to Microsoft Office Reference Manager? \nThanks for your answers.\n\nA: There are multiple alternatives you available to you. The first is a stand alone app, the second is also stand alone but can integrate with Libre Office, and the third is built to integrate with Libre Office.\nThe first, available in the Ubuntu Software Centre, is a neat app called Referencer. With it you can organise documents or references, and ultimately generate a BibTeX bibliography file. Referencer includes a number of features to make this process easier.\n\nThe second, with many positive reviews in the USC, is JabRef. You can customize the entry information shown in the main window, and sort by any of the standard BibTeX fields. JabRef also lets you easily link to PDF or web sources for your reference entries. I great feature is that JabRef can integrate with Libre Office. \n\nAnd third, Bibus, again in the Ubuntu Software Centre. Bibus is a bibliographic database which has been developed with LibreOffice in mind. It can directly insert citations and format the bibliographic index in an open Writer document.\n\nEach one of these Apps excels in different ways, so try them all out. They available on Windows as well, if you ever have to do work on Windows and want the same tools. \n\nA: Zotero (compatible with LO/Microsoft Office on both Linux and Windows) supports the APA format and dozens of others out of the box. So does Mendeley. \nThese are the most widely used reference managers out there.\n", "Q: What did I do wrong? Why isn't Ubuntu loading?

That being the /etc/hosts file entry.\nI was using the same java application at my VPS and my home computer and these were supposed to communicate over TCP. My home computer accessed the internet via a DSL modem which had a fixed IP address.  When I tried to direct a message from home to VPS, the java reported timeout (which just meant that a connection could not be made).\nI had already allocated my computer a fixed address withing the local network (i.e. 192.168.1.57) because it just seemed sensible. But the crucial change that I eventually made was to register my computer's internet address (i.e. 192.168.1.57) into the Ubuntu file /etc/hosts; now the java running at the home machine read its own \"inet address\" as 192.168.1.57 instead of 127.1.0.1 and everything started to work.\nI also needed to provide the VPS with my DSL fixed IP address (203.x.x.x) and a port number which was port-forwarded to the 192.168.1.57 machine. I hope this might help someone.\n", "Q: GPT partition table warning message during install of ubuntu /dev/sda contains GPT signatures indicating that it has a GPT table. However, it has a fake msdos partition table as it should. Perhaps it was corrupted? Is this a GPT partition table?\nSo, that's the error message and this is during my first OS install of Ubuntu.\nCan close the message box. Can't click yes and can't click no.\nWhat do I do?\n\nA: NO NEED FOR A EMERGENCY DISK!!\nSimply boot with ubuntu live CD or USB (I did with USB).\nThen open the Terminal.\nType: sudo gdisk (hit enter)\nType: /dev/sda (change /dev/sda to whatever is appropriate to access your hard disk, if necessary).\nThen you will probably see that there are MBR and GPT. Tell the computer you want to use the MBR\nThen:\nAt the Command prompt, type x to enter the experts' menu.\nAt the Expert command prompt, type z to \"zap\" (destroy) the GPT data.\nType y in response to the confirmation about destroying the GPT.\nType n in response to the query about blanking the MBR. Caution: If you answer y here, you'll destroy your Windows partition(s)!\n\nA: I am answering because the answers here are inadequate. I don't want future viewers of this question to destroy their windows partitions just to install Ubuntu.\nTo fix your problem, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the emergency disk (Ubuntu or other linux Live CD) and open a text-mode shell.\n\n*Type sudo gdisk /dev/sda (change /dev/sda to whatever is appropriate to access your hard disk, if necessary). The program is likely to complain that it's found both MBR and GPT data, and will ask which to use. It doesn't matter which you tell it to use.\n\n*At the Command prompt, type x to enter the experts' menu.\n\n*At the Expert command prompt, type z to zap (destroy) the GPT data.\n\n*Type y in response to the confirmation about destroying the GPT.\n\n*Type n in response to the query about blanking the MBR. Caution: If you answer y here, you'll destroy your Windows partition(s)!\n\n\nA: I've seen a similar problem on my disk when I had a leftover partition from my windows 7 system.  Went back to windows 7, and took all the partitions off using disk manager.\nAlso, make sure the disk is not \"dynamic\" in disk manager.\nAfter that, I was able to do a clean install of ubuntu 12.1o :)\nIn case you don't have a system running windows 7, you can boot with a windows 7 dvd and run setup.  Choose \"advanced\" when you get to choosing partition for the installation, and erase all partitions there.\n\nA: I do not know why, however if this is a fresh install without ANY data being retained on the HDD boot up as the livecd then use gparted to clear the GPT table and make an msdos partition table.\n\nA: I would like to answer about one of the causes that could lead to this complex situation.\nI had a GPT system with Ubuntu 14.04, no Windows. I was unable to install Windows without wiping my disk. So, I took the necessary BACKUP (always do that no matter what simple thing you are doing) and wiped the disk using bootable Windows USB.\nNow, the catch is, even if this automatically converts from GPT to MBR, somehow, it keeps signatures of GPT. So, any tool for managing the hard disk (like Gparted) gets confused as it founds GPT and MBR both. So, this will show all the disk space as unallocated as if you do NOT have Windows. But, if you check in your media, it will show the mountable drives, even, it will show all the data that your drive has.\nSolution to this is - make a bootable USB with any Linux version. Live boot it and once the Linux starts, open the terminal and use gdisk utility to remove all corrupted GPT entries or Signatures.\n\nA: To add to the answer given by PitaJ (and improved by Roxy)\nIt's possible that using Live disk, you will be asked to open terminal as a root and it will give you an error on gdisk command. To do that you will need to do the following:\n1) Open terminal\n2) type sudo passwd root, it'll ask you to enter new password, enter any password\n3)Type SU and enter password that you just used above. \nNow you are in terminal as root, everything listed by PitaJ will work from here on. \n", "Q: Zenity alternative for Bash scripts in package sources?

The installation went fine with the exception of the GPU lockup that is still occurring on my desktop NVIDIA card. That's another bug that I had in the past with 12.04 and I'm still surprised to have found it on 12.10.\nNow although I see my data partition which contains my windows user profiles in Ubuntu, when I boot into Windows it doesn't see it, thus I can't log in (says user profile service could not find profile, obviously because the drive is seen as missing).

It allows Windows to read Linux file systems natively, providing access to the file system via a drive letter that any program can access.\nYou can have Ext2Fsd launch at every boot or only open it when you need it. While you can theoretically enable support for writing to Linux partitions, I haven’t tested this. I’d be worried about this option, myself – a lot can go wrong. Read-only support is fine, though, and doesn’t have a risk of messing anything up.\nThe Ext2 Volume Manager application allows you to define mount points for your Linux partitions and change Ext2Fsd’s settings.\nIf you didn’t set Ext2Fsd to autostart at boot, you’ll have to go into Tools –> Service Management and start the Ext2Fsd service before you can access your Linux files. By default, the driver automatically mounts and assigns drive letters to your Linux partitions, so you don’t have to do anything extra.\nYou’ll find your Linux partitions mounted at their own drive letters in Windows Explorer. You can access the files on them from any application, without the hassle of copying files to your Windows partition before accessing them.\nThis partition’s file system as actually EXT4, but Ext2Fsd can read it fine, anyway. If you’re looking for your personal files, you’ll find them in your /home/NAME directory.\nDiskInternals Linux Reader\nLinux Reader is a freeware application from DiskInternals, developers of data recovery software. In addition to the Ext file systems, Linux Reader also supports ReiserFS and Apple’s HFS and HFS+ file systems. It’s read-only, so it can’t damage your Linux file system.\nLinux Reader doesn’t provide access via a drive letter – it’s a separate application you launch to browse your Linux partitions.\nLinux Reader shows previews of your files, making it easy to find the right one.\nIf you want to work with a file in Windows, you’ll have to save the file from your Linux partition to your Windows file system with the Save option. You can also save entire directories of files.\nExt2explore\nExt2explore is an open-source application that works similarly to DiskInternals Linux Reader — but only for Ext4, Ext3, and Ext2 partitions. It also lacks file previews, but it has one advantage: it doesn’t have to be installed; you can just download the .exe and run it.\nThe Ext2explore.exe program must be run as administrator or you’ll get an error – you can do this from the right-click menu.\nTo save some time in the future, go into the file’s properties window and enable the “Run this program as an administrator” option on the Compatibility tab.\nAs with Linux Reader, you’ll have to save a file or directory to your Windows system before you can open it in other programs.\n\nAll credit for unearthing these programs goes to How-To Geek.\n", "Q: Continuous synchronization I am new to Linux so forgive my ignorance. I am looking to set up a mirror of my data drive. It contains photos, music and my backups from the various PC's in the home. I use a standard 12.10 desktop as my file server. I have my data and the mirror on two identical drives. \nI want something that can run in the background to keep the data disk and the mirror in sync. I have tried Grsync and it does the initial copy fine but does not sync again until I hit the \"Go\" again. Is there a way to set this up to run continuously in the back ground. I use Yadis!Backup on window and it does exactly What I am after.\nThanks\n\nA: A good way to do this is to use the power of CRON. Thankfully, Ubuntu is very well documented about CRON jobs.\nYou can use a graphical interface to create jobs that do certain things for you via sudo apt-get install gnome-schedule (this might be easier). You might need to delve into the terminal side of things so you know which commands to execute for a CRON job, here is an image example:\n \nSo you would need to execute a command in order for this to happen. A local backup could be something along the lines of sudo rsync -azvv /home/path/folder1/ /home/path/folder2. \nHope this gets you started in the right direction!\n", "Q: how to disable usb based on vendor id in linux environment? I want to disable usb based on vendor id in linux environment. i want to allow only specific usb's only based on vendor id.\n\nA: This should be possible using udev rules, but is probably not easy and will require some experimentation. It is possible to accidentally do bad things like blocking your mouse and keyboard from working requiring restore with a live USB stick. I haven't tested these commands, caveat emptor.\nCreate a new file with a low priority number, eg /lib/udev/rules.d/20-block-usb.rules with contents:\nBUS==\"usb\", PROGRAM=\"/bin/filter_usb.sh %s{idVendor} %s{idProduct}\", RESULT!=\"allow\", OPTIONS+=\"ignore_device\"\n\nWhen a USB device is inserted, /bin/filter_usb.sh should be called with the vendor and product IDs of the device as arguments, and unless it echoes allow then the device should be ignored, eg:\n#!/bin/sh\nvendor=$1\nproduct=$2\n\nif [ \"$vendor\" = \"0123\" ]; then\n    if [ \"$product\" = \"4567\" ]; then\n        echo allow\n    fi\nfi\n\nYou will probably want to look into udevtest for experimenting with rules, and as noted, you need to make sure your mouse, keyboard etc are whitelisted. You may want to restrict the blocking rule only to USB block devices by adding SUBSYSTEM==\"block\", before PROGRAM in the original rule.\n", "Q: How to access Samba shares in Lubuntu 12.10 Lubuntu uses PCmanFM as it's default file manager. I want to access my samba share with PCmanFM to upload and download files. I've already installed the \"samba\" and \"cifs-utils\" packages and thier dependancies. Installing them seems to allow me to see the windows network which I can open and see my workgroup, but I cannot open the workgroup.

Is there a way to see the text of tty7 without shutting down Xorg, just like switching to another tty?\n\nA: I presume you want to see the X server logs for your GUI under VT7 (Ctrl+Alt+F7). In other words, the text that gets printed if you were to do a text boot, login and type \"startx\" (before the script hands over to your DE).\nIf this is the case, you can simply open your Xserver logs:\nless /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\nFor boot logs that would appear prior to the console login & X greeter, check:\nless /var/log/boot.log\n\nThe greeter creates its own logs. If you're using lightdm (the default greeter), then you'll find them all under:\n/var/log/lightdm/\n\n\nA: If you start X manually (startx or xinit) you'll see the text in whatever VT you issued the command in - unless you redirect it to a file or /dev/null (remember there are two streams here, stdout and stderr).  \nUsually however X is started automatically at boot by some display-manager (e.g. gdm, kdm or xdm), so you'll find the information in the Xorg-, *dm-, boot- and upstart-logs under /var/log.  Other logs - like /var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog - may also hold some information.\n\nA: Check /etc/init/ to see if you actually have tty7 configured. It isn't by default, meaning that there isn't one to view, AFAIK.\n\nA: You can also quit X windows using Ctrl-Alt-F12. That sends you to a text terminal, in general tty7. You can use the Alt-F1 to Alt-F7 to switch between terminals, however, when you come back to tty7, it switches back to X11, so you cannot go back and forth...\nIf like me you start X11 from a console, the X11 output will be in that console. Say you do so in tty1, then you'd use Alt-F1 to go back there.\nNow, this is all nice, but it only gives you the last 25 or so lines of output. Checking out the logs is definitively better since that way you can find everything since you started your session.\n", "Q: Is there any application like amazing slow downer for window or Mac?

By this i call to simply tick the *-security and *-updates only. \n\ncheers.\n\nA: This is by design.\nFrom the 12.04 Release Notes\n\nBackports are now more easily accessible -- to enable users to more easily receive new versions of software, the Ubuntu Backports repository is now enabled by default.

However, once installed, packages from backports will automatically be upgraded to newer versions.\n\nPS: I very much doubt there is anything related to wireless (or any kind of drivers) in the backports.\nPPS: Not sure what's going to happen in Raring.\n", "Q: How to set primary desktop on multiple monitors? I am perfectly able to set primary monitor via Nvidia X Server Settings or displays settings. It works just fine for the most of my needs.\nExcept for one. System ignores these settings when I want to save a file to my desktop. It always saves new files to my left hand side desktop, although my primary monitor is on my right hand side.\nThis is very annoying since I want to use my left display only for browser window, which I always keep open while on the right desktop I do all my other stuff like programming, browsing files, writing documents etc..\nSo how can I set my primary desktop to the same value as my primary display?\nEDIT: I have tried to switch the cables, displays but either one doesn't solve the problem. System always use left hand side desktop as a primary.\n\nA: *\n\n*The primary monitor is the monitor that gets used when you boot, so it's a setting you have to change in your BIOS.  Ubuntu allows you to move screens around so that your secondary monitor can be placed anywhere you want it, but it stays the secondary monitor.\nIf your BIOS doesn't allow you to do this (my Siemens laptop allows this, my IBM doesn't) I can give you something to try, but at the moment, I don't have a secondary monitor to test this, so I cannot vouch for it (I'm travelling).\n\n*Only works on a powered-down laptop: close the lid, turn on computer, hope that the secondary monitor shows the boot screen now.

Create a sensors configuration file in /etc/sensors.d/, e.g. mypc.conf and include this:\nchip \"w83627dhg-isa-0290\"\n\n  ignore fan1\n  label fan2 \"CPU fan\"\n  ignore fan3\n  ignore fan5\n\nAfter saving this file, the output of sensors should be changed accordingly. The current system default configuration can be found in /etc/sensors3.conf. Please don't modify this file as you're supposed to override any values in your own files in the .d directory.\nChanging ranges for ALARMs\nIf you feel that the reported values as ALARM are within a safe range, you can change that as well. From the sensors3.conf file I see that Vbat is actually in8 and defined with 10% margin. If you wish to change this, override this as well to become 15% like this:\n  set in3_min 3.3 * 0.85\n  set in3_max 3.3 * 1.15\n\n\nI hope this will get you somewhere in changing the configuration to a point that it's actually useful for your set up!

Thank you.\ntheguilster\n\nA: Below are some of my \"best practices\" thoughts about it. Ask a specific question about the individual options, it's too broad to dive into the details of all of them in this single Q&A, I think.\n\n\n*\n\n*Manage them in a centralized way.\nYou have several options here: Puppet, Landscape and Chef are just a few examples.\n\n*Preseed the installation.\nThis will avoid manual ask/answer question in the installation and allows you to install it automatically in your central management from the item above.\n\n*Consider PXE booting.\nIn case of issues and you want to completely restore the original state of the system, this will make it a lot easier to reinstall from scratch. Consider this to be automated as well, so you can let users do it themselves if they don't trust the current state of the system (security wise).\nAlternatively, you can even run of a customized (updated) Live environment in a diskless set up by using a central NFS server. Users can then store files on their USB flash drive or you can configure it to have the homes on a network share.\n\n*Surveillance on the machines.\nI'm not sure if you're asking about viewing the screens of the individual machines or to view the screen of the \"master\" PC on the individual ones.\nSeveral options here as well. The easiest way I think it is to enforce the start of a VNC server on each machine (using the central management) and then find a client application being capable of tiling 15 of those on the desktop of the teacher. The other way around is quite easy as well: just pre-configure a VNC client on those machines or even add a shortcut on their desktops.\n\n*Install a central proxy.\nIf you expect the users to use the Internet in a similar way (visit identical web pages), a proxy like Squid can help you reduce the bandwidth usage on the link to the ISP as well as an improvement in speed. The squid-deb-proxy package is useful for package updates, yes, but a regular Squid can do more than that.\n\n*\"cluster\" SSH commands\nI really recommend avoiding this, in favour of the first item (centralized management). However, if you need to run commands from a central location, PSSH  or Cluster SSH  can help you out in scripting. But really, look into options in Puppet/Landscape/Chef first.\n\nA: My suggestion is to use Edubuntu LTSP (Ubuntu + Linux Terminal Server Project + teacher tools) for this.\nThe last time I managed computer labs was before Edubuntu existed, but I used LTSP quite effectively, and eventually used K12LTSP for this. You can search for K12LTSP -- the mail archives are still online and most problems you encountered will be similar to the ones there.\nLTSP is wonderful for reusing older computers because most of the heavy lifting can be done on the server, with individual apps like Firefox or Scratch run locally on the client if you so choose. You also don't need to worry about locking the disks, since everything is run RO from the server, with /home mount RW (generally using NFS). You just set the server between you lab router and the outside, and set the clients to PXE boot, and you're generally done. The students won't be able to change anything, and any damage they do to their $HOME can be blasted away with no issues.\nEdubuntu also comes with the kind of client monitoring tools you are asking for.\nhttp://www.edubuntu.org/\n\nA: Another option (though not Ubuntu) is to use a modified SliTaz image on one of the systems, which can be used to PXE boot the entire lab, loading the image into memory. Boot is almost instantaneous, and even old systems are super fast on this system.\nYou create your modified image, boot the first system, turn on the boot server, then boot the other computers. That's all you need to do.\nhttp://www.slitaz.org/en/\n", "Q: is there a runic font for ubuntu 12.04? I would really like a font for the elder futhark runes.

I've never used Ubuntu before. Just heard from some friends. \"IT'S GREAT!!!\", they used to say. So i decided to try it. I downloaded WUBI, and ran it but 'twas takin' too much time. So I decided to download the .ISO Image file separately. It couldn't download more after 150 mB, and got interrupted (and cancelled) itself. I just went to Ubuntu's Website, and further went to Ask Ubuntu, and searched for my question. After having found a related one, which told\n\n\"try the torrent way\"\n\nSo I downloaded it through the torrent. And after that when I opened the .rar file, there wasn't any .ISO image file; just some folders with names like .disc, boot, ISOLINUX, etc. I searched for the .ISO file but nothin' there: ANYONE HELP ME, PLEASE!!! or this will drive me into never thinkin' about Ubuntu again.\n\nA: The file probably did not actually have a .rar extension. It probably showed no extension, and when you double-clicked it, it opened in WinRAR. That looks like this:\n\nAnd when you opened it, it probably looked something like this (the files inside may have been different, though, as it appears you downloaded the alternate CD):\n\nThis happens when these two conditions both hold:\n\n*\n\n*Windows is configured to Hide extensions for known file types, which is the case by default.\n\nIt's not necessary to change this setting, but if you want to do so, Folder Options is in Control Panel (in Windows Vista and later, it's in the Appearance and Personalization category).\n\n\n*WinRAR is installed, and configured to open ISO images.\n\nIt's not necessary to change this either, but if you want to after installing WinRAR, open WinRAR and go to Options > Settings... and click the Integration tab. You can adust file associations there. You can also adjust them in the Default Programs applet in the Control Panel (it's in the Programs category).\nThis is unrelated to how you obtained the ISO image. The problem is that you're opening the ISO image as an archive. You don't have to use WinRAR on the ISO image. Instead...\nIf you want to install Ubuntu alongside Windows (or replace Windows with Ubuntu):\nBurn the ISO image to a CD/DVD or write it to a USB flash drive, then boot from that. See:\n\n*\n\n*How to burn a DVD on Windows\n\n*How to create a bootable USB stick on Windows\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu?\nIf you want to install Ubuntu inside Windows using Wubi:\nYou can install a Wubi system from a pre-downloaded ISO image by downloading wubi.exe from the Ubuntu website (this is a very small file), then make an empty folder, and put wubi.exe and your ISO image (which, as explained above, may not show any file extension) in that folder. Then run wubi.exe. Make sure wubi.exe and the ISO image file are for the same version number of Ubuntu.\n\n*\n\n*However, you need the desktop CD/DVD image for this. You seem to have downloaded the alternate CD, which is not suitable for this purpose.\n\n*And for readers wishing to install Ubuntu via Wubi on computers that shipped with Windows 8 preinstalled: at least currently that is not supported and will not work. (But you can still create a regular (non-Wubi) Ubuntu installation.)\n\nAs a related but somewhat different situation, sometimes users confuse an ISO image and the program that opens it. See Ubuntu image download either downloaded or opened Roxio instead. Why? (In contrast, here the confusion is between an ISO image and another file type opened by the program set to open ISOs.)\n\nA: The Ubuntu torrent releases are not rar'd for any reason and are distributed as ISO's. If you have downloaded from an unverified source it would not be recommended to install that version.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/alternative-downloads\n"]
