["Q: What is the life of an infinite loop send to background? When will an infinite loop end?\nE.g. if I run\nwhile :; do sleep 1; date +%s; done &\n\nwhen will this end — on closing the terminal or on shutdown?\n\nA: When you provide & at the end, it goes into the background. Whether it is killed or not depends on how you close the terminal.\nIf you close the terminal application itself (Ctrl+F4, press the x in the window decoration, or Shift+Ctrl+W for gnome-terminal), it kills the background process.\nBut if you close the terminal using exit or Ctrl+D, it continues to run, even if you log out (unless it is a GUI application). It will end when you shut down.\n(I do not know why there is a difference between the two. I suspect that when you close the application, the operating system closes it and its children.)\nThe following is different:\nnohup while :; do sleep 1; date +%s; done &\n\nThe nohup command detaches it from the terminal. However you close the terminal, the command will continue to run until you shut down (logging out is not sufficient) or kill the command manually.\nWhen you use nohup, the output goes to ~/nohup.out unless you manually redirect the output.\nP.S. The command will not work with nohup as given, because nohup does not take a compound command. But you could script it and run the script with nohup.\nP.P.S. It is easier to see what is going on by running a GUI. Instead of the while… command, I run this:\ngcalctool &\n\nMuch quicker and easier to see what is happening, as the calculator disappears when it is killed; and you can kill it easily (just close the calculator).\n\nA: If you supply & a the end, closing the terminal will not close the process. It can still be killed by a TERM or KILL signal, though. On shutdown, TERM and KILL are sent to all the processes.\n", "Q: How do I download Ubuntu using BitTorrent on Windows? I am trying to download and install Ubuntu. I was told that downloading a torrent was a good option, as it can deal with interrupted downloads very well.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where should I go to download an Ubuntu torrent?\n\n*What programs should I use for this on Windows?\n\n*What is the bare minimum I need to know about BitTorrent for this use-case?\n\n\nA: Canonical provides detailed instructions on how to use BitTorrent as well as how to obtain their official torrents for their ISO images here. Below is a brief summary on how to obtain a copy of those torrents to download.\nWhere should I go to download an Ubuntu torrent?\nThe torrent files needed for downloading an Ubuntu ISO are made available by Canonical as an alternative to downloading the entire ISO directly. \n\n\n*\n\n*From the Ubuntu homepage, select the Download tab.\n\n*Next, scroll down to the bottom of the page and select the link:\nTake a look at a full list of our previous versions and alternative downloads\n\n*On this page, you will see the links for the currently available Ubuntu torrents.\n\n\nIf you would prefer, you can select a local mirror that is geographically closer to your region to obtain the torrent. \nDirect links to all ISO torrents:\nThese will open directly in your torrent client (uTorrent, Vuze, etc.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04.2 Precise Pangolin\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop\n\n\n*\n\n*32-bit\n\n*64-bit\n\n\n*Alternate (text-based installer)\n\n\n*\n\n*32-bit\n\n*64-bit\n\n\n*Server\n\n\n*\n\n*32-bit\n\n*64-bit\n\n\n\n*Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop\n\n\n*\n\n*32-bit\n\n*64-bit\n\n\n*Server\n\n\n*\n\n*32-bit\n\n*64-bit\n\n\n\n*Ubuntu 13.04 Raring Ringtail\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop\n\n\n*\n\n*32-bit\n\n*64-bit\n\n\n*Server\n\n\n*\n\n*32-bit\n\n*64-bit\nSource: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/alternative-downloads\nSee also: Previous AU Q&A \nWhat programs should I use to download torrent files on Windows?\n\n\n*\n\n*uTorrent\n\n*Vuze\n\n*BitTornado\n\n*BitComet\nWhat is the bare minimum I need to know about BitTorrent for this use-case?\nAfter installing your preferred BitTorrent client, all one needs to do is download the torrent file from the one of the direct links mentioned above. Your browser should ask you what you want to do with the file. Instead of saving it, have your browser open the file with your newly installed torrent client. \nSee also: A Beginner's Guide to BitTorrent\n\nA: To download an official Ubuntu release via torrent visit http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/alternative-downloads\nThe bare minimum you will need to know about bittorrent is that you will need an application which will start the download with a .torrent file. Then once the download has completed it will continue to share this file until the application exits.\nutorrent has been the go-to application for a long time, however if you have the opera web browser installed already it will download a torrent natively.\n", "Q: Konsole like terminal for Gnome I would like to switch from Kubuntu to Ubuntu but so far I couldn't find a terminal emulator for Gnome which had history support like Konsole does. In Konsole you can set the history to be unlimited and you can have highlighted search results almost instantly.\nIs there such a terminal emulator which would provide the same features in Gnome?\nThis would be very essential for me. \n\nA: For unlimited history, you'll have to edit ~/.bashrc. The default configuration is as\n# for setting history length see HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in bash(1)\nHISTSIZE=1000\nHISTFILESIZE=2000\n\nYou can edit above variables to a large number for unlimited history.\nAlso, you can use konsole itself in unity. To install,\nsudo apt-get install konsole\n\n", "Q: Remap shortcut to a single key cannot be used I want to remap my workspace switcher shortcut to a single key, specifically the Page Up/Page Down keys for going to the top/bottom workspace. But Ubuntu will not let me do this using System settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts, giving the following warning:\n\nThe shortcut \"Page up\" cannot be used because it will become impossible to type using this key.\n  Please try with a key such as Control, Alt or Shift at the same time.\n\nIs there any other way to remap shortcuts to a single key?\nHelp is appreciated!\n\nA: This is actually quite easy using the xbindkeys  and the xdotool  packages. xdotool lets you emulate key presses, and xbindkeys lets you add custom shortcuts.\nAll the following steps are run in a terminal.\nFirst we will kill the process\nkillall xbindkeys\n\nNow we put our custom shortcuts in the ~/.xbindkeysrc file\ngedit ~/.xbindkeysrc\n\nand we put in the following lines\n\"xdotool keyup Next && xdotool key ctrl+alt+Down\"\n   Next\n\n\"xdotool keyup Prior && xdotool key ctrl+alt+Up\"\n   Prior\n\nsave and close, and start xbindkeys again by running\nxbindkeys \n\nIt should now work like you wanted, enjoy!\n\nExplanation:\nNow what does it actually do? Say, you press Page Up, your computer recognizes this as the Prior key (you can check this using xev | grep key and pressing keys). Now before we simulate other keypresses, we should emulate a key release first, that's what the xdotool keyup Prior is for. If it is released successfully then we send the Ctrl+Alt+Up combination and this is what xdotool key ctrl+alt+Up is for.\n\nA: It is possible to remap any navigation command in GNOME and Unity directly with dconf or via command line using gsettings. For PageUp/PageDown moving workspace up/down you could do:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-up \"['Page_Up']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-down \"['Page_Down']\"\n\n", "Q: Add launcher of type Location to Unity application launcher I would like to open a specific file directly from the launcher.\nI have created a launcher (myFile.desktop) of type Location, which works like a charm when on the Desktop.

But few companies don't want to give away source code of their driver, so these are propitiatory drivers and need to be installed separately.\nWith internet there is a great way to get such restricted drivers, press Windows key (key between alt and ctrl on left side), search for addtional drivers.

Ubuntu is one of many Linux versions or 'distributions'. Of course it's one of the most popular.\nWindows on the other hand is a product from Microsoft. Now, if you see any program that has and extension \"exe\" or \"dll\", it is guaranteed to be a Windows-only product. So the first thing you should do is to see in your CD, if there are any folders named \"Linux\" or \"Ubuntu\" or even \"Debian\". If you don't find any, then your CD is strictly Windows-only. So you shouldn't waste time trying to get it going.\nNow, assuming that you don't have a CD for Linux/Ubuntu, the best way to install all drivers is to first install the OS with a network cable connected to your computer so that it detects that networking/internet devices automatically.\nOf course you can install all this later on and configure your wireless connection later but as a person new to Ubuntu or Linux in general, that would mean a very lot of work. So if this is a fresh intallation, you're better off redoing it. But make sure that you're plugged in to the net via a cable.\nIf on the other hand, you're up for a challenge, you may try looking for answers on how to configure networking for Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How can I fix an issue occurring while installing the latest AMD graphics driver?

I tried to exchange my Fn key with left Control, which didn't work.\nI used the command xev to get the keycodes/keysym.\nAfterwards I used:\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 151=Control_L'\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 37=XF86WakeUp'\n\nBut it didn't change anything.\nI also couldn't create the .Xmodmap to change the keys there.\nDid I forget anything? It didn't throw out an error.\n\nA: You are probably using a Lenovo keyboard, which reports the Fn as XF86WakeUp. Normally Fn does not register an xev event at all because it is handled by the BIOS, therefore you cannot remap it.\nThe fact that it is reported as XF86WakeUp gives a lot of confusion, as you can see in this bug report, but it is not really a bug, to quote comment 27 of that bug report:\n\nIt's not really a bug. Fn is the wakeup key when the machine is suspended. If anyone wants to map it to other functions, then that's okay, but being able to do that is not universal... Fn on ThinkPads and LenovoPads is a magical/special key. If only generates its own code if not combined with any of the other magic (blue highlighted) key combinations and that is more of a fluke than anything.\n\n\nA: If you are using a Lenovo or Thinkpad laptop, see into BIOS/UEFI config to check whether there is a \"Swap Fn and Ctrl\" option in \"Keyboard\" section. According to the user guide, most models should have that option.\n", "Q: How can I delete a mail account in Thunderbird? I missed one letter of my user name for my mail when add an account to Thunderbird. My mail is reachable in webmail with my browser, but is unreachable in Thunderbird.\nHow do I delete an email account in Thunderbird so that I can start again?\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to menu: Edit, Account Settings...\n\n*Select account name on the left\n\n*Either make any changes here (on the right) or Remove Account from the drop-down menu opened by clicking the Account Actions button at the bottom left\n\n\nA: Go to Edit->Properties and select the Account. Then Click on Account Action at the left bottom of the current Window and delete your Account.\n\nA: Select Account and go to \"View Settings for this account\". Then click on \"Account Actions\" at the left bottom of the window and click \"Remove Account\".\n\nA: I found this process for removing an email account from Mozilla Thunderbird:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Thunderbird\n\n*Click on the account you wish to delete \n\n*Look for \"view settings for this account.\" and double click.\n\n*Outside the box on the left which contains a menu of topics, click on \"Account Actions\".\n\n*You should now see a list of actions, double click on \"remove account.'\n\n*Answer Yes to \"Are you sure.......\"\n\n\nIt should be gone.  \n\nA: I wanted to delete all mail accounts in Thunderbird but not delete Thunderbird itself (i.e. perform a complete mail accounts \"clean up\"). Unfortunately, Thunderbird's interface was not letting me do it. So I had to manually perform something a bit more extreme with the help of the shell terminal.\n\n*\n\n*First, I opened a new shell terminal window (CtrlAltT usually works on Ubuntu and its \"flavors\" e.g. XUbuntu, LUbuntu, KUbuntu...).\n\n\n*Then I deleted all (hidden) Thunderbird's profile folders with this shell command:\nrm -r ~/.thunderbird/*.default\n\nThe ~ (tilde) symbol is a shortcut to your home folder (e.g. /home/myusername/) and the * symbol means a string of as many characters as necessary. Hence, *.default means all files ending with .default i.e. it doesn't matter how many characters the filename has, nor which characters it contains (numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters etc.): any file with any name, ending with the file extension .default, is matched/selected by the above command.\n\n\n*I also deleted the file that stores all Thunderbird profiles:\nrm ~/.thunderbird/profiles.ini\n\n\n\n*Finally, I started Thunderbird's profile manager:\nthunderbird -P\n\n...and then created a new default profile by following these simple steps:\n4.1. Click on Create Profile and then Next.\n4.2. At Enter new profile name, replace Default User with default (or leave it as it is, if you prefer to keep the default name suggested by Thunderbird) and then click on Finish. Thunderbird will automatically create a new folder for such new user/profile and will also create the profiles.ini file again.\n4.3 You will be taken back to Thunderbird's main Profile Manager window. Just click on the default (or Default User) profile name, make sure that Work offline is unchecked and that Use the selected profile without asking at startup is checked, then click on Start Thunderbird.\n\n\n*You may now click on Cancel and then close Thunderbird's main window, or add a brand-new account if this is what you want to do next.\n", "Q: Disable Usb ports in ubuntu desktop except usb keyboard and mouse I installed ubuntu 12.10 64 bit version in my system. I want to disable all the usb ports. Except usb keyboard and mouse. I tried to add a line blacklist usb_storage in the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and run the command sudo modprobe usb_storage. Reboot the system. But still the usb port is detected. What is the problem? \nAnyone can help me to find the solution?\n\nA: For every device there will be modules in our kernel which will be installed with our OS  to make work them you have to just enable their modles\nso in ubuntu usb enabling modules will be  /usr//lib/modules/3.2.0-36-generic-pae/kernel/drivers/usb/storage/usb-storage.ko  as of mine is [UBUNTU 12.04] and kernel number may differ in yours \ngo to that destination as shown above and type in terminal as\nsudo modprobe usb-storage.ko as superuser it may ask for password and it will enable them and to check if they are enabled or not type in terminal as lsmod |grep usb* \nAnd if it shows any usb storage then u have enabled it \nthats all \nfor more info \nMODROBE INFO\nLSMOD INFO\n", "Q: Where to install libraries manually? I want to install SFML (a free multimedia C++ API) on my Ubuntu system, which basically isn't a problem. But I wanted to know where I should store the files.\nI can see, that Ubuntu stores my C++ Standard libraries in /usr/include/c++ and so on..\nMy problem is, that I don't know where I am supposed to leave the libraries or is there no place which should be used for this and I can move the files wherever I want? \nAll I am looking for is just some kind of a way \"how to do it right\" but I can't find an answer. I want my libraries to stay organized.\n\nA: /usr/local/lib/ should be the right folder for this. It is the normal place for keeping shared library files installed manually from source code (as defined by FHS).\nIf you build a library by running ./configure, make, and sudo make install, it will usually install there automatically.\n", "Q: Can I use an old home directory in my new Ubuntu installation? I've installed Ubuntu 12.10 and I did somethings wrong (things that do not allow me to boot my system any more), when I installed it for the first time I used the following table of partition: one for the user files /home and one for every thing else (/).\nSo, I'd like to know if I can install (again) the Ubuntu 12.10 and use this old /home directory, can I?\n\nA: You most certainly can. I've been doing that for a while now.\nDuring installation, you should make sure that you select the old home partition to be used as \"home\" and that you do not format it. That is basically all there is to it; that's how you use your old home partition.\nNow, because you mentioned you did some things wrong, you will probably want to delete your old settings as well. Most (all? Any gurus here to confirm?) of these are stored in the dot folders and files (e.g. /home/zignd/.filezilla/ or /home/zignd/.config/). By moving all the dot folders and files away from /home/zignd/ to for example /home/zignd/backup-dotfiles you can reset all the settings. By moving instead of removing you can restore the settings you'd want. For example, the .filezilla folder might contain some settings you can still use and is most likely not responsible for the issues you have.\n\nA: There'll be no problem with it. You can use old /home directory for new installation.\n", "Q: guvcview can't capture video.

Seems to be it'is recording something but when done, i'm running this video and there no sounds buy only animation like in windows media player some kind of screensaver.\n\nA: I had this problem also, if you go into your audio settings you can change which device uses the microphone.If you are using a webcam with a built in microphone be sure that it is selected in the audio settings. That ended up being my problem anyway, Hopefully that helps. \n", "Q: Monitor setup and desktop background lost on restart I have a Lenovo Z570 dual booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.10 very happily. I love it, and I'm fairly sure I want to switch permenantly. The laptop has a  1366x768px built in screen, and is connected to a second monitor, resolution 1680x1050px.\nAt login, both screens are mirrored, and both screens are set to 1024x768px. On logging in, I can set the laptop screen to the correct resolution, but I had to use xrandr in command line to add the correct resolution for the second monitor. I also set a nice desktop background.\nOn restarting, I get a window saying \"Could not apply stored configuration for monitors\". It's back to mirroring at 1024x768, and my desktop background is gone.\nHow can I get the correct resolution at login, keep my desktop background, and not have to mess around in a terminal window every time I reboot?\nAny help greatly appreciated!\n\nA: At the moment, it appears the best solution is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not rebooting with the VGA cable plugged in\n\n*Saving the xrandr commands to a .sh file to run on startup\n\n\nI suspect the answer is to get a more modern monitor.\n", "Q: How to adjust text color, contrast in ALL system features & apps? Why is there no system directory where a person might access all system utilities, like background, text size, color, etc. Must I download a separate utility for everything?\n\nA: All appearance options are in the 'Appearance' section of the 'System Settings'.\nThere is also myunity  in the software center that lets you modify the Unity interface.\nIf that is not enough you can also install Ubuntu Tweak or UnSettings, the first lets you tweak Ubuntu in general, the second is specifically for the Unity interface.\nFinally there is compizconfig-settings-manager , but this tool is very advanced, so I wouldn't recommend it to novice users.\nEdit: To keep this answer up to date:\nThere is now also Unity Tweak Tool which lets you change almost every part of Unity.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Live CD - Persistance and install If I were to use a Ubuntu live USB with persistence for a while, and then when I am comfortable with it, choose to install it to a Hard Disk, will my persistent data transfer over? Or will I get a vanilla Ubuntu install, as per the read only part of the Live USB?\nThere is an exact duplicate(one that I could find) in If I Have a Live USB with Persistence, if I install it, will the persistence be included, however the one answer there seems to be rather confused.\n\nA: *\n\n*Ubuntu live USB with persistence can be used to install Ubuntu on hard disk but it simply produces a fresh install with no transfer of any system-wide or user settings, data, etc.\n\n*It is possible to transfer most user settings and data from your home folder (e.g. sub-folders like .mozilla, .thunderbird, etc.) by simply copying and pasting them to your new home folder, and same applies to data files in folders like Documents, Pictures, etc.\n\n\nA: No, installing Ubuntu is like installing a fresh copy of Windows or Mac OS X(Ten). So any persistence you have set up as the LiveUSB will be lost.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Why can't I Resize/Move in GParted?

I tried doing this using a virtual machine (VirtualBox and VMware) but it was not good enough. I want to make a partition on my hard drive so when the computer starts I'll choose between Windows 7 and 12.04.\nI tried using Gparted, but for some reason I'm not getting the Resize/Move option.\nThere must be a way that I can do this without formatting and installing everything again.\n\nA: To be able to resize/move partitions, the partitions must not be in use.\nBoot from a liveCD or liveUSB, make sure no partition is mounted then launch Gparted and create the necessary partition.\nAfter installing Windows you'll have to recreate Grub. The easiest way is to boot again from the live USB, install boot-repair with sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update followed by sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair and do a recommended repair.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 issue: only wallpaper and curser appear, no menu or icons etc \nPossible Duplicate:\nUnity doesn’t load, no Launcher, no Dash appears \n\nI have installed Ubuntu 12.10 on an old Compaq N800v.

Thank you.\n\nA: You've just found the great powers of being root and how easy it is to screw up your whole system!\nI would recommend reinstalling the complete system, because, I can't agree more to what Gilles said in a similar question:\n\nCan it be fixed? Sure. Faster than reinstalling? Probably not.\n\nSo, as this is not easy to fix yourself by hands within reasonable time and effort. And if you try, you'll notice a lot of stuff will break: sudo, setuid/setgid binaries, etc.\nGeneral steps for a reinstallation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your data, e.g. /home/username.\n\n*Back up configuration files: /etc\n\n*Get a list of manually installed packages, which allows you to reinstall them quickly in the new installation.\n\n*Restore the configuration files selectively. Don't bluntly restore complete /etc as that will break stuff. Only restore files you actually touched yourself.\n\n*Restore your data.\n\n\nDone.\nI'm looking forward to the time that we have Btrfs as the default file system and we can restore our complete system by simply reverting to a snapshot.\n\nA: For changing permissions only for folders (directories), recursively, you can use:\nsudo find ./ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\nFor changing permissions only for files, recursively, you can use:\nsudo find ./ -type f -exec chmod 640 {} \\;\nConsidering you run the command with 755, you only need to run the command for the files. \nBe aware that these commands run in the folder you are in (./).\n", "Q: How to disable Internet connection for a single process?

How can I enable an effect like Aero Glass in Windows, applied to the Unity dash and top panel in Ubuntu 12.10?\n\nA: Ok tested on 12.04, 12.10 and 13.04, is rather easy and I will add more info as I do more tests.

Most Post commands are executed within a normal amount of milliseconds, but when there is a delay it always seems to be for about 4.5 seconds. This is not a busy, public server so it shouldn't be a matter of server load being the problem. The best way for you to understand what I am trying to explain is for me to show you. So without further delay, please take a quick look at these couple of short videos:\nvideo 1\nvideo 2\nCan anyone give me any ideas why this is happening and what to try to resolve it?\n\nA: As I mentioned in the comments, I see no reason to believe MySQL is the bottleneck here, but I do think the webserver configuration can cause this.\nInstalling a regular LAMP setup done by for example apt-get install lamp-server^, will install PHP as an Apache module and pull in the prefork MPM. By default, this only starts with a limited number of workers (forks) to handle incoming connections. Any new connections will simply not be processed (though not refused). So, I think what you're seeing is simply that the \"pool\" of workers is to small to handle all the connections.\nAn error similar to this one will probably be in your Apache error logs somewhere when hitting this limit:\n[error] server reached MaxClients setting, consider raising the MaxClients setting\n\nTo configure the prefork MPM in Apache, you can see the current values in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf:\n# prefork MPM\n# StartServers: number of server processes to start\n# MinSpareServers: minimum number of server processes which are kept spare\n# MaxSpareServers: maximum number of server processes which are kept spare\n# MaxClients: maximum number of server processes allowed to start\n# MaxRequestsPerChild: maximum number of requests a server process serves\n<IfModule mpm_prefork_module>\n    StartServers          5\n    MinSpareServers       5\n    MaxSpareServers      10\n    MaxClients          150\n    MaxRequestsPerChild   0\n</IfModule>\n\nIn order to change this, I'd recommend to create a new file in /etc/apache2/conf.d, e.g. prefork-mpm-tuning.conf and just \"overload\" the settings from their defaults (and restart Apache):\n<IfModule mpm_prefork_module>\n    StartServers          20      # |-- important to increase\n    MinSpareServers       20      # |\n    MaxSpareServers       50\n    MaxClients           70       # too high will get you out-of-memory here\n    MaxRequestsPerChild   0\n</IfModule>\n\nImportant note here is that Apache only scales up per second, starting with only one (hardcoded, not configurable) and never scales down unless you explicitly configure it to. As explained in the Apache documentation on performance tuning:\n\nIf the machine is busy spawning children it can't service requests. But it has such a drastic effect on the perceived performance of Apache that it had to be replaced. As of Apache 1.3, the code will relax the one-per-second rule. It will spawn one, wait a second, then spawn two, wait a second, then spawn four, and it will continue exponentially until it is spawning 32 children per second. It will stop whenever it satisfies the MinSpareServers setting.\nThis appears to be responsive enough that it's almost unnecessary to twiddle the MinSpareServers, MaxSpareServers and StartServers knobs. When more than 4 children are spawned per second, a message will be emitted to the ErrorLog. If you see a lot of these errors then consider tuning these settings. Use the mod_status output as a guide.\n\nWhile the last paragraph may apply to general cases, I find it very confusing in testing that Apache seems unresponsive after restarting. For this reason my recommendation is to raise the StartServers setting.\nSo, to summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*You probably want to increase the StartServers to accept all the subsequent connections you fire from the clients. Apache's prefork MPM is not very dynamic worker - to be able to have it perform well with a lot of simultaneous connections, you'll need to simply start a lot.\n\n*Allow it to allocate enough memory (roughly 20MB per fork in practice). Yes you'll need loads of it just to serve 100 concurrent visitors in this design. (look at PHP-FPM if you need more performance with less memory)\n\n*Limit the MaxClients to prevent Apache to claim all memory of the server and crash it. Do math and testing here.\n\n*Setting StartServers too low to save memory while maintaining a larger MaxClients is a bad thing: your site will appear to be slow for the one-per-second reason and memory usage will grow later anyway. This will happen then.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache prefork MPM tuning on a low-memory machine\n\n*Apache Performance Tuning\n\n*Optimal values for ServerLimit, MaxClients, MaxRequestsPerChild directives\n", "Q: Unable to Mount Location Can't mount file I am new to ubuntu.

I searched some answers from the askubuntu forums and here. but I am unable to mount the drive still. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: This is nothing to be concerned about. This happens due to partitioning - the \"500 GB Hard Disk\" icon represents your entire SDA tree, so it can't be mounted as a single volume. \nNext to that icon, you will see a folder called \"File System\" that represents the base of your Linux installation. Any other operating systems or data partitions should be accessible from your desktop, and will be labeled \"xGB File System\" where x is the amount of space in that partition.\n", "Q: Setting up Xen VGA Passthrough With Two Different Video Card While I have learned that you must use two different video cards to utilize Xen's VGA Passthrough, I am curious if you can do this with different video cards from the same manufacturer.  Specifically, I would like to utilize the following setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*xubuntu\n\n*Radeon 4870\n\n*Radeon 7870\n\n\nMy goal is to have triple monitors on the Linux host OS (7870 allows this via mini-DisplayPort).  Then, I want to be able to launch a VM of Windows that has direct access to a single video card for gaming (probably on the 4870).\nA bonus would be to have the host system utilize 2 displays on the 4870 and 1 on the 7870, so that the 7870 could be used for the gaming VM (w/ that monitor switching to the VM).  I think I'm reaching a bit far with this bonus though.  Any working configuration that allows triple monitors with a gaming Windows VM (even if it uses the 4870) would be great!\n\nA: You can use any number of cards from any number of manufacturers.\nDom0 won't care because while it will know that there are devices there, you'll be passing kernel boot parameters to tell it to ignore looking for and binding drivers to the cards so it will just leave them alone for the domUs to deal with.\nEach domU will only know about the card assigned to it so they in turn won't care that you have multiple video cards from either the same manufacturer or different ones. As long as the domU's OS has drivers for the card(s) assigned to it, it'll be able to use it fully.\nMy Xen server setup has a cheap Nvidia card for the Xen host and a Radeon 7750 driving multiple monitors dedicated to one of the guests. Works like a charm.\nNote: there are still some issues with rebooting domUs that have assigned VGA adapters.

I'm trying to install juju on local environment. For that I installed Ubuntu Server 12.10 and I followed this juju Getting Started tutorial. At the step where I run the following command:\nsudo usermod -a -G libvirtd <YOUR_USER>\n\nThe error is reported:\nusermod : group 'libvirtd' does not exist\n\nDoes someone have ever had this problem and can help me?\n\nA: You don't need to run this command. The guide states:\n\npre v0.6 users only Then you need to add yourself to the libvirtd group:\nsudo usermod -a -G libvirtd <YOUR_USER>\n\n\nAs Ubuntu 12.10 provides juju version 0.6, this does not apply.\n\nTo explain a bit more on the error you got, the libvirt-bin package (the base of Libvirt basically) will create this system user group for you. Because you don't need to install this for 0.6 version of Juju, it's not installed and you'll get the error about the group specified not being a valid existent group. The command is listed for pre-0.6 versions and the guide also lists this package to the lists of packages to install for these older versions.\n\nA: log in as root using this command su -\nthan use the command  adduser  libvirtd\nafter that for checking it try the same cmd with same user name if it already added you than it will show you \"The user your user name' is already a member oflibvirtd'.\"\n", "Q: Change MTP default action when connecting to Ubuntu The first time I've connected my smartphone to Ubuntu, it asked me about the default action each time I'll connect it.\nNow the default action is to open nautilus.\nHow do I change it to not do anything or ask me what to do?\n\nA: Go to system settings.\n\nAnd then choose \"Details\"\n\n", "Q: rysnc errors, backup with deltacopy and Ubuntu I have several windows machines that are using deltacopy and rysyc to back up via ssh to an ubuntu machine.

Even with a manual run the backups do not execute:\n\nrsync: read error: Connection reset by peer (104) rsync error: \nerror in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at \n/home/lapo/packaging/rsync-3.0.4-1/src/rsync-3.0.4/io.c(791) \n[sender=3.0.4] Generic error occurredRsync.exe returned an error. \nWill try again. \n\n\nA: This error tells you that the local rsync was trying to talk to the remote rsync, but the connection to that rsync is now gone. \nIf the remote rsync is a daemon, your first step should be to look at the daemon's log file to see if it logged an error explaining why it aborted the transfer. Also double-check to ensure that the log file is setup right, as a wrong \"log file\" setting in your rsyncd.conf file can also cause this problem.\nThere are several common causes for a remote rsync process going away:\n\n\n*\n\n*The destination disk is full (remember that you need at least the size of the largest file that needs to be updated available in free disk space for the transfer to succeed).\n\n*An idle connection caused a router or remote-shell server to close the connection.\n\n*A network error caused the connection to be dropped.\n\n*The remote rsync executable wasn't found.\n\n*Your remote-shell setup isn't working right or isn't \"clean\" (i.e. it is sending spurious text to rsync). \n\n\n\nIf you can't figure out why the failure happened, there are steps you can take to debug the situation. One way is to create a shell script on the remote system such as this one named \"rsync-debug\" (This is a Linux script and you probably need a windows equivalent). You would use the script like this:\nrsync -av --rsync-path=/some/path/rsync-debug HOST:SOURCE DEST\nrsync -av --rsync-path=/some/path/rsync-debug SOURCE HOST:DEST\n\nThis script enables core dumps and also logs all the OS system calls that lead up to the failure to a file in the /tmp dir.

My laptop CPUs are throttled down to .8GHz instead of 2.5GHz whenever I am connected to AC only and not the battery.

Is there a way to prevent this?\nUpdate: I've also tried changing the governor, but it seems locked at .8GHz whenever it's on only AC power. Are there any overrides for this?\n\nA: CPU scaling is controlled by your BIOS and not by the software running on the computer.\nReboot and go into the BIOS configuration.\nLook for an item called \"CPU scaling\" and toggle it.\nIf it's not there, you can't prevent that from happening.\n\nA: That is only the operating system (and drivers themsevelves) honor it.

Can I remove the HD from the new PC when it arrives and swap in the Ubuntu HD without a need to alter GRUB?\nI'm clueless about BIOS settings, altering GRUB or any of the growing list of things mentioned here to deal with the UEFI issue and would very much appreciate any and all help in dealing with this. Thank you!...Dave\n\nA: Yes, it should work, but with a couple of caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your new computer will probably be configured to boot with UEFI and with Secure Boot active. To get your old (presumably BIOS-based) installation working, you'll probably have to adjust your firmware settings to disable Secure Boot and perhaps to enable BIOS/legacy/CSM support. Precisely how you do this varies greatly from one computer to another, so you'll have to dig into your firmware settings and figure it out for yourself, or locate model-specific documentation.\n\n*A new computer might have hardware that's newer than the drivers available in Ubuntu 12.04. Thus, you may need to upgrade your kernel or add new kernel modules. This could be tricky, particularly if one of the drivers you need to upgrade provides very basic services, such as a driver for a hard disk controller. It's probably best to just try it and hope for the best. If you can't get it to boot, swap the disk back to the old machine and do research on the new computer's hardware and how to get Ubuntu 12.04's kernel to work with it.\n\n\nA: Yes, it's very simple. Ubuntu will automatically recognize the new hardware and operate accordingly to the new hardware's needs.

(It's connected through USB.)\nCan I keep/use any of the loaders that Windows has and be able to link them all together, when Windows 8 is on an external drive which is connected through USB?  If it works, but is slow or otherwise suboptimal, that's fine. \nI read another post about this before asking but since I have a short supply of primary partitions I'm willing to format to convert to logical I wanted to specify my question a bit.\n\nA: In my experience Windows always needs to be on the drive that has been set as the first boot HDD device in BIOS. I don't remember whether I have tried it with Windows 8 but probably it's still the same. \nSo if you want to boot Windows 8 from the external drive you should select that one as the first boot device from BIOS or BIOS' boot menu. If you select Windows 8(that is on a second drive) from the Windows 7 boot loader (that is on the first drive) Windows 8 will start to load but after few seconds the computer will reboot.\nYou could also try to fit all the operating systems to the same hard drive and use the external for storage. Or run Windows 8 inside Virtualbox if that is enough for your needs.\n\nA: No problems to install any Windows to logical partition.\nThere must be at least one primary active partition on first HDD for boot related files.\nIf you install Windows 8 on a computer with existing Win 7 and Ubuntu 12.04\nWindows 8 boot files will replace that of Windows 7, an entry for Windows 8 will be added in BCD (boot configuration data).\nTo view complete BCD contents (and edit it) you can use Visual BCD Editor.\nFor booting any Linux/Unix descendant using Windows boot manager see\nDual boot Windows 7 and Linux/UNIX.\n", "Q: What is the proper way to setup an Ubuntu OpenStack instance to run MySQL?

How to make it to detect that Ubuntu is actually there? When to remove the USB? Please help :( Thanks in advance! :)\n\nA: It's supposed to tell you explicitly when to remove the USB flash drive, but I think that, unfortunately, that message is not visible 100% of the time.\nIt's right when the live system shuts down. The best time to remove it is before rebooting. If you've rebooted already and you're in the live system again, then shut down, remove the USB flash drive, and boot your computer.\nAssuming there were no problems during the installation, Ubuntu should be installed and working.\nIf It Still Doesn't Work\nIf the installation appeared to complete, but booting without the flash drive fails without detecting an operating system, this usually means the GRUB2 boot loader did not successfully install to the Master Boot Record. To fix this, boot from the USB flash drive, select Try Ubuntu (not Install Ubuntu), and reinstall GRUB to the MBR, using any of the techniques on either of these pages:\n\n*\n\n*How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\n(This applies even though the cause of the problem is not a recent Windows installation.)\n\n\n*The Ubuntu help wiki section on repairing GRUB2.\nIf It Still Doesn't Work\nThen it's necessary to collect more information to troubleshoot the problem.

Trying to replace it with Ubuntu so my laptop will work.\nNow I have two USB sticks. One is about 1 GB, and the other is 8 GB, recently purchased for the purpose of installing Ubuntu.\nI followed the directions laid out by the help files, and used the Universal USB Installer to install Ubuntu onto both USB sticks. Oddly enough though, the 8 GB stick will not boot even the trial of Ubuntu on the laptop. Meanwhile the 1 GB could (that is, until something happened and I had to format it and it's now only 556 MB). So to run the trial and unsuccessfully attempt to install it, I had to have both USBs plugged in at the same time. Before it wouldn't let me install it, giving me various errors about partitions and /dev/sda. But now it won't even boot up at all.\nI've gone to the BIOS screen and made it so it always tries to boot from the USB stick and still nothing happens. The 8 GB has Ubuntu correctly installed onto it and it still refuses to boot up even a trial, let alone allow me to try to install. I just get a black screen.\nWhat is going on here? I'm not a computer expert so it would help if you can simplify any answers you can give. Thanks.\n\nA: Possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have a hardware problem like a failed hard disk drive. If this is why Windows isn't booting, of course that will translate to any other OS. The dev/sda errors make me suspect this. Depending on the make/model of your machine there may be hardware tests you can run from BIOS or boot selection screen.\n\n*The install media has gotten messed up. Sounds like you've done some pretty intense formatting and playing around with those sticks. I'd open up a program like UNETbootin and make sure it can recognize the formatting on those sticks and see them as writable.\n\n*Last but not least it could be an issue with booting from usb, or a problem with the usb port itself. You could rule these out by burning a disc if you are able to.\nHope that helps. \n", "Q: installing wine without internet How to install wine application on ubuntu12.10 without internet. I have already downloaded wine 1.4, but I don't know how to install it.Please be sure any answer for me.\n\nA: How you install it will depend on the file type that you downloaded.\nIf it's a \".deb\" file, then just double-clicking it should make it run and install. If that doesn't work, then open terminal, cd to where the file is, and run it from there (something like sudo name-of-installer-file.deb).\nIf it's a \".tar.gz\" file, then it will be more involved. WineHQ has good information on how to do this, though. See the \"installing without an internet connection\" section.\nIn short, what you'll need to do is use a computer that does have a connection to download the necessary dependencies and copy them to a USB stick or external drive that you can then plug into the computer without a connection. Then, on the non-connected machine, cd in terminal to where those files are and run sudo dpkg -i *.deb to install everything.\nOn a side note, I noticed you tagged this question with \"video-player\", \"media\", and \"media-manager\". Ubuntu comes with a video player (Totem) and music manager (Rhythmbox), and there are a number of other such applications that work well, run natively, and are compatible with most MP3 players. It may be worthwhile to try them, instead, which you would install the same way as you would install Wine. The advantage to this would be that you'd install far less (to compare, installing Wine on a computer with a high speed connection can still take upwards of 10-20 minutes to download and install everything, and often needs other libraries installed to provide the necessary support). It's usually a good idea to try native applications, first.\n", "Q: Pc acting weird since dual-boot setup I just came to think of something I've noticed recently when rebooting my PC.\nIf I reboot my PC from within an OS, after installing software or something, it get's stuck on the absolute first screen where you have the option of going into BIOS.\nThis started happening a week ago or so and I've never had this issue before and I assume it came from dual-booting. I think it may have come up after Windows was put down in suspend-mode by accident (my girlfriend doesn't know swedish and though it said shut down) and it never resumed from that suspended mode and I had to repair Windows following that. (This is one of the primary reasons I prefer Ubuntu)\nAnyway, so I have Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 installed. Ubuntu works fine but SINCE THAT STUPID BEHAVIOUR from Windows 7, neither OS can reboot successfully. I have to shut the PC down and then boot it up again manually, or else it gets stuck on that first screen. \nAny ideas or theories? My theory may be completely wrong. I didn't think it was permanent the first time it happened because I thought it was related to Windows acting like a child but it stuck with me and it's bugging me a lot now actually.\n\nA: Windows does not play nice with other operating systems. When you ran that repair it would have overwritten whatever bootloader you had on there, attempted to replace it with MBR, and with it as the only OS. It also would have deleted any partitioning and formatted your HDD with NTFS.\nIt's probably too late to go back. Windows discs delete everything to an extent where you'll need data recovery software to get that drive back as it was. \nWhat has worked for me with Win7 and dual booting is to install Windows first. This will help with certain hardware like some wireless cards as well. Then you can shrink the NTFS partitions in Computer Management>Disc Management to make space for Linux. If you install Ubuntu second it should install GRUB which can then either boot you straight in or pass you to the Windows 7 loader. If the Windows install breaks for any reason, definitely back up before using a setup disc.\n", "Q: How do I change the background at boot time for Ubuntu 12.04? I have Ubuntu 12.04 with GNOME.

The video may be .flv, .avi, etc. I want it done from the terminal. How can I do that?\n\nA: This should start with a caveat, that transcoding between lossy media formats will generally involve loss of quality.\nThere are lots of options here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert older formats (MPEG-1, DivX 3 etc) to newer and more efficient codecs (eg x264, theora) which will generally mostly preserve video/audio quality in a smaller output.\n\n*Reduce the target bitrate or target output size, improving size at the cost of reproduction quality.\n\n*Reduce the video dimensions, allowing similar reproduction quality at lower total size.\nUnless you have strong reasons for another choice, x264 for video and aac for audio in an mp4 container is a good choice for quality and reasonably wide compatibility (but you should encode something short and try it on anything you'll want to play it on - getting widely playable transcoded results remains an exercise in witchcraft).\nI find the current command serves me fairly well for converting older formats:\navconv -y -i INPUT -pre:v libx264-slower -b:a 96k -c:v libx264 -c:a libvo_aacenc OUTPUT.mp4\n\nYou can scale down the image size by adding -vf scale=iw*0.5:ih*0.5 before the output name, or set a video bitrate -b:v, or play with multi-pass options... but mostly the above will produce a reasonable outcome. \n", "Q: Restore audio settings - cannot open mixer: No such file or directory The internal speaker of my laptop never functionned under Ubuntu.

Recently, I migrated an Ubuntu 12.04.1 virtual machine from one host to another. After the migration, the server was unable to contact Landscape. Based on the Landscape documentation, I removed the server from Landscape, and re-registered it. It worked beautifully and the server is in contact with the service.\nHowever, while the server was out-of-touch, several \"Resynchronize computer\" activities were created and were left in a Pending or In Progress status when the server was de-registered. They did not get removed when the server was removed from Landscape.\nHow can I remove these orphaned activities?\nI have tried to manually cancel them, but the action buttons are greyed out when the task is opened.\nThank you.\n\nA: I'd recommend you file an support case about this by clicking on the \"SUPPORT\" link at the top of the landscape GUI.\nIf you don't get a response, please reply here and I'll make sure it gets taken care of.  \nOf the top of my head, it looks like something is very wrong with the client, as a re-synchronization event should not happen under normal circumstances.  Those activities should also not be stuck there, and thus there is no normal mechanism to delete them (short of deleting the computer and re-adding it).\n", "Q: Not returning focus to previously focused window This has been bothering me a lot. When closing a window, the system does not give the focus to the previously focused window. Let me give an example.\nRight now, I'm working with Google Chrome and it is focused (active). I decide to open up nautilus and check a file. When I'm done with nautilus, when I close it, it should automatically return the focus to Google Chrome (previously focused window), but it doesn't. No window is focused, not even desktop.\nIs there a solution for this problem?\nnote: I'm using Unity 2D, but I don't think this is the reason.\n\nA: Ok I found out what the problem was.\nI was using \"Glx-Dock / Cairo-Dock\" and it was stealing the focus on every window close. I couldn't find a solution or even a single bug report on the net, so I just uninstalled it and now I'm fine.\nAnd BTW, thanks for the down votes. I'm wondering how ridiculous my problem was to receive down votes :)\n\nA: I had the exact same problem with Ubuntu 16.04 after installing Gnome Desktop (ubuntu-gnome-desktop) and configuring cairo-dock 3.4.1 to start on login. Additionally, I also had the problem that some application windows did not receive focus after I started them and started under the currently active window (so called 'pop under').\nI traced the problem to the usage of cairo-dock's Desktop->Notification Area Old. It was working fine under the Unity desktop. After disabling this module the focus issue was resolved. Guess, that's why its called 'Notification Area Old'.\n\nA: The better way is to use compiz \"Window Rules\" to avoid focusing cairo-dock: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1339646&p=9565169#post9565169\n", "Q: Notification Panel in Ubuntu Gnome Remix Crashed how to start without reboot I was writing some python code which interacts with dbus to do notification which works great. not sure what happened, but somewhere along the way the notification panel at the bottom crashed.\nI can't seem to figure out how to start it again.\nAny idea what I can do to start it without rebooting?\n\nA: gnome-panel --replace &\n\nfrom a terminal will restart the panel without keyboard shortcuts or kill commands.\n", "Q: How to stop the fluent change / switch between work spaces?

While I disable this, can I still keep the shortcut CTRL + ALT + RIGHT or CTRL + ALT + LEFT intact? \n\nA: Solution: Use arandr to properly deactivate the laptop monitor and properly configure the resolution for the external monitor to resolve all wonky and weird looking layouts. (Although it might look pretty good already.)\n", "Q: Why does it appear that my Linux file system is more fragile than my Windows file system? I've got my laptop in dual booting, and whenever I boot into Linux (Ubuntu or Linux Mint), there's a decent chance that it will run the file system check (more than the default once every 30 times), and it'll be a definite run if I'm booting after letting the laptop run out of battery. This has happened over two different laptops.\nThe Windows partition on the other hand, never does anything visibly, so I was wondering:\nIs it the case that the file system on my Linux partition (ext2/3) is more fragile than the file system on my windows partition (NTFS)?\nIs it the case that Windows checks for errors and solves them in the background?\nIs it the case that Windows doesn't check for errors, and Ubuntu is just more vigilant in terms of file system health?\nThanks\n\nA: \nIt'll be a definite run [of a file system check] if I'm booting after letting the laptop runs out of battery.\n\nOn every mount, Ext3 will simply replay the journal, eliminating the need to do a full file system check. But really, please avoid a hard shut down of the system! It's not a good practice if your data is valuable. Instaed, let Ubuntu just shut down your system gracefully on a low battery.\nTo see if your file system will be checked on the next boot, run\ndumpe2fs -h /dev/sda1 | grep -iE \"(mount count|check|state)\"\n\nIf you really need to hard shut down without taking the time to going through the shut down procedure, then at least shut down your file systems cleanly before pulling the power - e.g. by doing Alt + sysrq + REISUB (but use O instead of B to halt).\n\nIs it the case that the file system on my Linux partition (ext2/3) is more fragile than the file system on my windows partition (NTFS)?\n\nNo. I believe the Ext3 file system is very stable and very unlikely to break. The checks just make sure the structure is intact and that possibly corrupt blocks are being hidden (moved to lost+found) and that the files will be in a known consistent state.\n\nIs it the case that Windows checks for errors and solves them in the background?\n\nIt's not the right place to ask how Windows works, but I really prefer to know whether my file system can be recovered to a known state before my applications are allowed to start and write to the disk. Doing a check afterwards while applications are already writing, it can make things a lot worse.\nLong story short: checking the file system before it goes \"live\" and writeable, is of your own benefit.\n\nIs it the case that Windows doesn't check for errors, and Ubuntu is just more vigilant in terms of file system health?\n\nSee above.\nAbout Ext2\nAs became clear later in the comments, you appear to be using Ext2 still. That version does not feature any form of a journal, as psusi points out. The above does only apply to Ext3/4 and most other journaled file systems. Please avoid the use of such and old file systems if your data is valuable in the conditions of unclean shut downs. There's no reason to use it still for regular Ubuntu desktop installations.\nNewer generation file systems\nAdditionally, I wanted to point out that a newer generation of file systems is starting to become more and more mainstream. For Ubuntu/Linux this is Btrfs, a design similar to ZFS. It will be way more intelligent in fixing corruptions and is self-healing on-line. However, it will not be able to do magic on pulling the power from a running system - there's still risk in losing data you wrote just before you pulled the plug.\n\nA: Don't use ext2.  It has no journal, so like FAT, has to be checked after an unclean shutdown.\n", "Q: Where are my themes? I am in 12.04 logged on to Gnome Classic I ran some commands in the terminal to download themes from internet but I dont know how to access them, they dont show up in Appearance.\nThese themes are for gdk3 and gnome\n\nA: Edit: Wrong answer, sorry!\nCorrect answer here:\nWhen a theme is downloaded from the internet, it is usually placed in an archive. All you need to do is extract this archive to the .themes folder, located in your home folder. To see hidden files (EG. those beginning with a .) press CTRL+H. If the folder isn't there, don't panic. Just create said folder, and extract the theme archive into this spot.\nALSO: Some themes have a set of instructions for installation on their website. This would be a good place to check.\nOLD ANSWER:\nUbuntu 11.10 and newer uses GTK+ 3, meaning it uses a completely different system for displaying applications. This said, it still supports theming.\nFirst, make sure your themes are compatible. If you had the \"clearlooks\" theme, and you really liked it and wanted to continue using it, google \"clearlooks for GTK 3.\"\nAlso, the appearance dialogue is annoyingly limited now. It currently supports the Ambiance, Radiance, Adwaita, High Contrast, and High Contrast Inverse themes ONLY.\nIn order to get around this, you will need something called the \"tweak tool.\" It can be downloaded through the software center or the Synaptic Package Manager by searching for \"gnome-tweak-tool\" or running the command sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool in the terminal. Once that is done, look for something that says either \"Advanced Settings\" or \"Tweak Tool\" in your Accessories and System menus, and then launch it once you have found it. On the sidebar, click \"Theme\" and you will be presented with the option to change your theme. Hope it helps!\n\nA: Ubuntu 10.04 uses gnome2 and ubuntu 12.04 uses gnome3, gnome2 themes are not compatable with gnome3 hence they are removed, BTW you can install other gnome3 themes from internet\n", "Q: How can I completely remove NetworkManager?

So, maybe it has a problem finding it on C: (for whatever reason). Just copy it to the root of another drive. e.g. D:\\wubildr. It doesn't matter which drive.\n\nA: The problem is, you cannot install OS within windows and run it. Create Bootable USB (Easier than CD), you can go to http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ to create bootable disk. You can save ISO image from http://www.ubuntu.com first and then create bootable using the ISO image.Boot from the USB and you are good to go.\n", "Q: simon listens 4.0 build - further - error I'm a PhD researcher in Applied Anthropology, and I am trying to dictate fieldnotes to my Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (x86_64 3.2.0-36-generic).

In the event I want to set up a RAID 1 mirror utilizing mdadm, is it needed to have a file system on the drives first? Reason I ask is my desktop which has RAID 1 (built from the alternate install CD) says both drives (via GParted) are EXT4, along with /dev/md0 which is the usable volume of course. I just set up my server, which is currently resyncing the drives now, but it too had a RAID 1 mirror. My drives were unformatted when I added them to the mdadm array via terminal. I had set them as unformatted + set the RAID flag via GParted on a LiveUSB session prior to starting the array build process.\nThat being said, I'm sitting here wondering - if mdadm basically clobbers the data on the HDDs during the rebuild process, how are my desktop RAID drives coming up as EXT4 when independently looked at? Likewise, does that mean my server will come up in GParted through a LiveUSB session as unformatted when I look at each drive independently since they were unformatted before I started? And lastly... does it matter?\nThanks!\n\nA: No, the filesystem is not relevant before creating the array.  mdadm does not \"clobber\" both drives, it just copies the contents of the primary to the secondary when mirroring.  If the primary already had an ext4 filesystem in it, then it will still look like it does, and after the resync, so will the second.  The new default mdadm metadata format of 1.2 is stored 4k from the start, so it will have overwritten and damaged the filesystem that was there before.  If you use format 1.0, which is stored at the end, then you can look at an individual disk and still use it without mdadm, though writing to it this way is a very bad idea because mdadm won't know what has changed if you put the drive back into the array.\n", "Q: 12.04 losing display settings on startup I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 on my desktop at work. It seems like every other week when I boot up my computer it loses its display settings. It's to the point where I have to bring up the virtual console (CTRL+ALT+F1) to stop the lightdm service, reinstall the NVIDIA driver and reboot. It runs fine every other time... Just once in awhile I have to reinstall the graphics driver.\nDoing this doesn't take all that much time (5-8 minutes, tops), but it's annoying that I have to do this every couple weeks.\nSystem information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n\n*Memory: 7.8gb\n\n*Processor: AMD FX 8120 (8 cores) - 64 bit\n\n*Disk: 2TB\n\n*Graphics Card: NVIDIA Quadro FX 1700\n\n*Graphics Driver: NVIDIA Linux x86(64) 310.19 (The most recent version\nis 310.32)\n\n\nAny idea what could be causing such an issue? Would upgrading to the most recent Linux driver from NVIDIA fix this issue?\n\nA: On Ubuntu, using the drivers from Nvidia's website is likely to cause more problems than it solves (not the least of which being that it's a PITA to install to begin with).\nOn my system, there tends to be three Nvidia drivers, in addition to the generic one. An experimental, a stable, and a stable tested. I'd recommend trying one of the others and see if that makes a difference.\nAlso, keep an eye on updates and see if there's a kernel or Nvidia driver update that corresponds with your issue. Keep notes of what was going on before you shut down before the issues and see if you find any patterns.\n", "Q: How to prevent animation during Compiz viewport switching? I want to turn off animation of windows appearing and disappearing when switching between Compiz viewports.\nI've tried to turn this animation off by the setting-changes listed in a bullet list below.  However, windows still seem to slide or zoom out of the old viewport or into the new viewport whenever I switch viewports, rather than popping instantaneously into place like I want.  Here is the script I used to test the behavior:\n#!/bin/sh\nS=1.5; W=1680; H=1050\n\nfor y in 2 1 0; do\n    for x in 2 1 0; do\n    wmctrl -o $(($x*$W)),$(($y*$H))\n    sleep $S\n  done\ndone\n\nNote, I installed wmctrl via sudo apt-get install wmctrl.

(Note, several of these settings probably are irrelevant, but I haven't found a discussion that explains which, if any, are relevant to the current problem.) (Note, CCSM stands for Compiz config-settings-manager, which I installed with\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager)\n• On CCSM/Effects, unchecked the Fading Windows and Animations boxes.\n• On CCSM/Desktop/Desktop Wall, set target preview visibility time to zero.\n• Also unchecked Show viewport switcher preview and Show live viewport previews.\n• In CCSM with expo in search box, clicked expo, and\non Behaviour tab set zoom time to 0.1 (it won't go to less) and checked Immediate moves.\n• Set Expo animation to Zoom (there is no animation-off option on the tab) \nSummary of question:  How do I turn off animation of windows appearing and disappearing when switching between Compiz viewports, and make those windows just appear as quickly as possible?\n\nA: A previous question, Turning off the transition animation when changing workspaces in GNOME2, has an answer that partly solves the problem.\nFirst, install ccsm (the CompizConfig settings manager) if it isn't present, either via Ubuntu Software Center or with apt-get:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nNext, run ccsm, and click Desktop, Desktop Wall, and Viewport switching in turn.  Set Wall sliding duration to 0.  (On my Ubuntu 13.04/Unity/Compiz system, that duration defaulted to 300 ms.)\nThis still leaves the following problem that occurs when I run the test script shown in the question.  When wmctrl issues a command to switch to a different viewport, that viewport is immediately displayed (as desired) but also a scaled-down viewport-indicator box animation appears.  In a fraction of a second that box shrinks and disappears.\nTo deal with that issue, in ccsm click Desktop, Desktop Wall,  and Viewport switch preview in turn.  Change Switch target preview visibility time from 0.2 to 0.  After that the test script runs cleanly.\n", "Q: How to display buttons in Evince?

In the \"Layout\" group, you should see a checkbox labeled, Different widgets for each desktop.\nToggling that will enable/disable having separate widgets for each desktop.\n", "Q: Unstable wireless connection I have Ubuntu 12.10 64 bits kernel 3.5.0-22 running on a Dell Precision M6700. The wireless controller is a Broadcom BCM43228 (802.11abgn, the router also is 802.11abgn); it didn't install on a fresh install, so I added the bcmwl-kernel-source package and I got the wireless network working... sort of.\nThis is a dual boot machine, and under the same conditions that the connection running Windows is stable, running Linux it is anything but; every now and then it disconnects itself, it doesn't manage to connect on its own to the router, requiring a repeater (which is not necessary with Windows) and even then there are times when it connects to the network without really working (e.g. pinging the router itself returns \"unreachable\"). Frequently when reconnecting it asks the network password again. At times it doesn't manage to connect at all, even with the repeater turned on. Things only really work if I am practically stuck to the router, but that sort of defeats the whole idea of wireless connections.\nAny suggestions are greatly appreciated.\nKen\n\nA: There's a program called NDISWrapper. It's in repo under ndisgtk. It will let you use windows XP drivers pretty seamlessly which is nice. \nThe broadcom cards are a total headache - the company is d-bags to open source and their proprietary linux drivers are far from reliable. \nGeneral recommendation - Wicd instead of Network-Manager. Good time to ditch Unity as well if you are still on it. Wicd has fixed persistent authentication problems, signal strength issues, etc with the Broadcom cards for me before. \n", "Q: How do I install Eigen2?

I'm planning to develop an open source application and am also considering to set a non-zero price for it.\nIf an user purchases the app, will he be charged again when updates are released?\n\nA: From my experience with the Software Center and the Humble Indie Bundle apps, no, they will not be charged again.  I've installed updates to Bastion without any re-payment, though I redeemed the Bundle apps via the gift codes, so it might be different for store-bought apps.\nTechnical\nWhen you purchase an app, it adds a private repository (a.k.a. PPA, or personal package archive) to the folder /etc/apt/sources.list.d, e.g. private-ppa.launchpad.net_commercial-ppa-uploaders_bastion_ubuntu.list.  The URL inside the file does not change when the app is updated, so I assume you will never have to re-purchase as long as the app is not republished under a new name.\n\nA: The answer is no, they will not be charged again if updates to the app are released.\n", "Q: Gaming Screen Recorder I make gaming videos and recently installed Ubuntu and I haven't been able to find a good screen recorder for gaming. Are there any recommendations (preferably free ones) that can record in HD, use multiple audio sources (i.e. Headset and computer sound), and is in the Ubuntu Software Center? If it's not in the software center I still might get it, just preferably in the software center. I've already tried Kazam Screencaster and RecordMyDesktop, but they didn't work out for me. Thanks guys!\n\nA: RecordMyDesktop is the easiest solution, you use it like:\nrecordmydesktop \\\n    -o \"/tmp/recording.ogv\" \\\n    --fps 30 \\\n    --no-cursor \\\n    --full-shots \\\n    --on-the-fly-encoding \\\n    -x 22 -y 249 --width 320 --height 240\n\nHowever it is slow and not fast enough for gaming at large resolutions. It also has issue when it comes to very long recordings, which tend to corrupt, so it's a good idea to stop and restart the encoding every 30min or so, to not risk a corrupt stream.\nFor proper game capture you need GLC, which is specifically written for OpenGL and only works with OpenGL apps. It's not in Ubuntu, but you can download the source and compile it yourself. Once compiled, you need to start your game via glc-capture with a line like:\nglc-capture -l /dev/stdout -v 3 -i -j -o /tmp/recording.glc -b back your_game\n\nGLC is fast enough for capturing games at 1280x720 or more depending on your computer.\nIf you need more flexibility when it comes to capturing multiple audio sources you can use pulseaudio tools. Most important is pavucontrol, it's a mixer app for pulseaudio that lets you decide what gets recorded and even switch recording sources at runtime. To select an recording device go to \"Input Devices/All Input Devices\" and select one named \"Monitor of Build-in Audio Analog Stereo\". All the Monitor ones allow you to record audio output. This is something you likely will have to do when using GLC and recordmydesktop, as I think by default they will record the line-in or something like that, not the actual speaker output.\nPulseaudio also comes with numerous modules that allow you to redirect or filter output. For example to create a virtual Soundcard that doesn't output to your speakers, you use:\npactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=nullsink\n\nDocumentation can be a bit lacking, but it should allow you to do most things you might want to do. For just recording game audio and headset output separately, you can setup pavucontrol so that GLC records the game audio and then use a separate parecord to capture your headset.\n\nA: You might wanna try Gamecaster, from Ubuntu Vibes.\n\n\nGamecaster is a graphical frontend for open source project glc. It\n  can capture real time footage of any Linux game that uses ALSA for\n  sound and OpenGL for drawing.\nGamecaster has following features:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Capture HD video of Linux games that use OpenGL acceleration\n  \n*Select a game binary or choose one of your installed games to start recording\n  \n*Playback a .glc file\n  \n*Encode a captured .glc file into webm video format\n  \n*Options to change capture hotkey, video bitrate and number of CPU threads\n  \n*Ubuntu indicator support\n  \n  \n  I have updated Gamecaster for both Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10. It includes\n  an important bugfix that will prevent Gamecaster from crashing on\n  launch if you use any other language than English on your desktop.\n\nAt the time of writing, is only available for 12.04 and 12.10. The development seems to have ceased. Press the keyboard combination: CTRL-ALT-T, \nto open up your terminal, and copy/paste the codes below.\nWARNING GAMECASTER is still in alpha stage (0.3)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:niteshgupta16/gamecaster-stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gamecaster\n\nsource code tar balls are here\n\nA: I can actually vouch for the answer that Grumbel made about recordmydesktop in the terminal. It has been the best one when it comes to resource usage. Also ffmpeg/avconv. But there are a couple of factors you should take into account when recording:\n\n\n*\n\n*How many RPM does your HDD have (Assuming you don't have an SSD in which case, do not worry about the hard drive). If it has 5400 RPM you have a bigger chance that when recording while playing, the video will not look smooth or the game play will feel slower. If it is 7200 RPM and to top it off, the HDD has a lot of cache (Like 16 MB, 32 MB or 64 MB) then you will have a better experience.\n\n*What video card do you have. For example, I had a case where the user had an FX 5200. I mean, an actual Nvidia FX 5200. Really?.. There is no power in the world that will let you record a game while playing on that video card in a smooth and crystal clear way. So the better your video card is, the better the experience will be.\n\n*CPU Power. Expecting to create the best and awesome gaming recording but have an Intel Celeron or an AMD Duron.. hell no. That video recording will really REALLY suck. If your CPU is not powerful enough (And side by side with it, your motherboard) then don't make an odd face when you see that recording while playing makes a lot of lag and that will make the video look awful.\nFrom my experience, having a good computer with enough CPU, RAM, VIDEO and the other obvious stuff for it to record (Specially from experience the hard drive Read/Write speed) you can use Kazam for it (Since you are talking about HD). But not the Kazam that comes with the Software Center but the one that comes in the PPA. It has better performance the one that comes in the PPA. At least compared to the one in 12.04 or 12.10. If you want to try it then do the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kazam-team/unstable-series\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kazam\n\nBut take into consideration that:\n\n\n*\n\n*When recording, depending on the recording app, the video recorded can be send directly to the HDD/SDD, in which case it will eat some of the speed of the hard drive which will have an impact on how the game will feel. The other case, depending on the available amount of RAM, it will send it to RAM and then start to process it (coding the video on the fly), then writing to the disk in intervals.\n\n*In any case, remember that the video will be in most cases being coded while recording the game. This means it will take a chunk of your RAM, CPU and HDD speed. So the more you have of any of this, the less impact you will feel.\n\n*If your video card and/or CPU is optimized for specific coding techniques (For example H.264) then that will help a lot.\nNotice I don't mention the sound. This is because sound has less of an impact to the performance of the PC than the actual video.\nFor an example I have here a VIDEO done using Ubuntu 13.04 on an Intel i7 2600 with 16 GB RAM and an Nvidia 560 TI. I have an Intel 120 GB SSD with an Intel DZ68DB motherboard... yeah I know.. all Intel. Anyway, you can see how the video behaves.\nFor multiple audio sources, Kazam (The one in the PPA) offers:\n\nAs you can see you have sound from Speakers and sound from Mic.\n\nA: I recommend SimpleScreenRecorder. You do have to use the command line to get it but it is really simple. I had problems with a lot of other screen recorders having huge video tearing issues and stuff but SSR has worked really well for me\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:maarten-baert/simplescreenrecorder\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install simplescreenrecorder\n\nThat's all there is to it.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Try out glc, it's not in the software center and I don't know if it supports multiple audio sources, but it was the only one which worked fine for me with OpenGL.\n\nA: You can try Open Broadcaster Software (OBS).  It is made for multiple Operating Systems; I use it on my Windows gaming machine, but it also runs natively in Linux.\nIt captures multiple sound sources, as I often stream/record games, Mumble, and other things.\nThis link is for 14.04, but it should also work for you:\nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2015/06/open-broadcaster-software-ubuntu-14-04/\nIt is also probably in the repositories.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Set up Ubuntu on VirtualBox I downloaded the VirtualBox and added the saasbook-vm-0.9.1.vdi.\nWhen I start the virtual machine I'm getting a prompt:\nPress ESC in 0 seconds to skip startup.nsh or any key to continue\nShell>\n\nWhat am I missing? What should I do next?\nI'm using a Mac with OSX 10.7.5\n\nA: You have enabled EFI boot in VirtualBox. \nEither type exit in the EFI prompt and try to find the EFI file for booting Ubuntu if you're committed to booting in EFI. Play around with the options in their EFI configuration menu. If it's not working, disable EFI in the System properties for your virtual machine and install Ubuntu into BIOS mode. \nEFI isn't too much fun in VirtualBox and you don't gain too much from using it, unless you're trying to boot from a raw local disk, in which case it could be essential. \n\nA: Yes. You may want to disable EFI support in your VirtualBox settings and try loading Ubuntu in the VM again. \nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: How do I boot Ubuntu ISO from Windows 8 I have a Lenovo ThinkPad S230u Laptop/Ultrabook with Windows 8 pre-installed on it. It doesn't have a CD/DVD Drive. I read another question that was similar to mine, but it involved using a Live CD, DVD or USB device. I have an Ubuntu 12.10 ISO file, ready to be mounted.\nCan I install Ubuntu directly from an ISO, without using a Live CD, DVD, or USB device? If so, how?\n\nA: You asked:\n\nIs it possible to do this through an emulated USB(similar to PowerISO)?\n\nYou can install directly from the ISO image if you use Wubi. Here's two ways:\nPut the ISO Image in a Folder with the Installer\nDownload wubi.exe and put it in a folder with the ISO image and (preferably) nothing else. Make sure the Wubi installer is for the same Ubuntu release as the ISO image.\nThen just run wubi.exe; assuming the ISO image is uncorrupted, it will find and use its contents automatically.\nMount the ISO Image\nIf you have a Windows utility like Virtual CloneDrive, Daemon Tools, or PowerISO that lets you mount ISO images on a virtual drive, you can mount the ISO image, then run wubi.exe from inside the virtual drive. (It's a file in the ISO, so if you use this technique, you don't have to--and should not--use a separate copy of it.)\n\nA: You should create an installation/LiveUSB from .iso file as it simplifies installation process.\nSee official Installation/FromUSBStick.\nAfter booting from USB you will be presented the same interface as if you have booted from a LiveCD/DVD.\nYou could try installing Ubuntu in a VM first so this will leave your current Win 8 installation without change. \nA VM (virtual machine) installation is just a file (set of files) on any existing partition/drive.\nIf you install Ubuntu natively you need at least 2 new partitions and there will be some common boot manager (GRUB or Windows boot manager) which has to be configured to boot both OSs.\nFor native Ubuntu installation you have to check if current Windows 8 installation is on MBR or GPT style disk. There are different guides for BIOS/MBR and for UEFI/GPT installation/dual-booting.\n\nA: No, this is not possible. You must use the live DVD if you want to install Ubuntu. Starting with Ubuntu 12.10, live CDs are no longer available, as the ISO was bigger than the other versions released in 2011.\nTo do this, you must buy an external DVD drive. Most of them are not that expensive, and will save you time if you need to install anything from a CD or DVD in the future.\nBut if you want to install Ubuntu inside of Windows, I would suggest using Wubi. It's free to download and will help you install the latest version of Ubuntu inside of your Windows installation. Link to download Wubi will be below.\nWubi Installer\n", "Q: Ways to make persistent iso-bootings from hard disk Here I asked How can I save settings when booting an ISO file from HARD DRIVE.\nAfter trying different combinations around  Sadi's solution, the only thing that has worked for me is to place the ext2 file called casper-rw in a FAT partition, not in the system ext4 partition (I haven't been able to boot if the file is not in the FAT partition); and the only parameter that I need to add to the usual menu entry in grub2's menu that already booted the iso-image is \"persistent\" (no reference to the FAT partition, but I ignore if 'boot=casper' makes reference to the casper-rw used for persistence). The menu entry is like this:\nmenuentry 'ISO Booting - Ubuntu-64bit.iso live' {  \n  set isofile=\"/home/user/Desktop/ISO/Ubuntu-64bit.iso\"  \n  loopback loop (hd0,3)$isofile  \n  linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz boot=casper iso-scan/filename=$isofile bootkbd=es console-setup/layoutcode=es persistent noprompt noeject --  \n  initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz  \n}\n\nThe problem is that the the whole FAT partition that contains the casper-rw ext2 file becomes inaccessible; it can't be mounted because it's busy; it is displayed, together with the /cow filesystem as mounted in Nautilus, but I only see /cow as root in mount's output . I would like to find a solution without repartitioning.\nIs that possible?\n\nA: EDIT:\nFor 12.04 & 12.10  you can access the FAT partition by opening filesystem/isodevice as root, when booting an iso with grub2.\nAnother option to the 4GB limited casper-rw file is to make an ext2, 3 or 4 partition labeled casper-rw.\nA partition labeled home-rw will work as a separate home partition.\n\nA: Yes, like C.S.Cameron said, you can access the FAT partition by opening filesystem/cdrom as the root user. Another option is making a ext2, 3 or 4 partition. But, if you find this hard, just follow what C.S.Cameron said and follow the steps in the quote below.\n\nYou can access the fat partition by opening filesystem/cdrom as root.\nAnother option to the 4GB limited casper-rw file is to make an ext2, 3\n  or 4 partition labeled casper-rw.

Do this by typing pactl load-module module-loopback latency_msec=1 at the shell prompt.\n\n*If you now record with audacity, or recordmydesktop, from the \"Monitor of Built-in Analogy Stereo\" (see Recording tab of pavucontrol after you start recording), you'll get your microphone as well as whatever's coming out of the speakers. This means that you can now easily record Skype meetings or private Google+ Hangouts.\n\n*UPDATED: On the Recording tab, you can show all streams (combobox at the bottom) and then configure which microphone (if you have more than one) should loopback into the built-in analog stereo\n\n\nI think this module load has the same effect as the \"Duplex\" config recommended by @Takkat, but did not work on my machine.\n\nA: To define the recording source for any recording application we may install pavucontrol.\nAs soon as we record any audio stream the name of the recording application and the source from where it records will be shown in the Recording tab. We then may be able to change the source to Monitor of <your soundcard> to record the output of our soundcard:\n\nWe may have to choose another audio profile in addition. This can be done from the \"Configuration\"-tab of pavucontrol, e.g. a \"Duplex\" sound profile for output of the microphone to our local audio sink:\n\n\nA: My favourite GUI audio recording tool is Audio Recorder which is able to capture audio from all of possible sources.

I tried Audacity, RecordMyDesktop, SimpleScreenRecorder. I realized that even if I managed to get one program to record the two audio sources together and a second program to capture the video, I would have to line them up in a video editor (OpenShot) which wouldn't be aligned to the millisecond.\nFinally, I found a perfect solution with Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)\nIn Settings → Audio, I was able to select:\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop Audio Device - Monitor of GK106 HDMI Audio Controller Digital Stereo (HDMI 2)\n\n*Mic/Auxiliary Audio Device - EMU20k2 (X-Fi Titanium Series) Analog Stereo.\n\n\nFor Source, I selected Screen Capture (XSHM) to capture the entire desktop.\nWorks perfectly.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 spdif output doesn't support multichannel sound I'm a relatively new Ubuntu-user, and I need a bit of help.\nI just recently discovered that my laptop (an Acer Aspire 5670), has an optical-spdif output and since it's connected to a 5.1 Yamaha Receiver I bought a special optical cable and connected them properly.\nNow, I noticed most people usually find at this point that they cannot configure their sound cards to output an spdif signal, but that is definitely not the problem in my case, since when I made the connection Ubuntu automatically changed the output to spdif (and properly gave me the option to choose between spdif and analog) and I could hear everything just fine (more than fine actually, since the sound was greatly improved!).\nHowever, what did happen was that the spdif signal was set to 2 Channel Stereo and there is no option whatsoever for multichannel sound through the spdif output! (while, there is a 5.1-analogue output option, which I tried while the laptop was connected with the spdif cable and obviously nothing happened) So even though I played video files with multichannel sound (6Channel AC3 and DTS) the audio reached the receiver as 2-Channel PCM. I tried playing the files through different players (Movie Player, VLC, SMplayer) but nothing changed. \nSo, here's hoping someone could help me figure out whether this is a software/driver problem (and if so, how and if I could possibly fix it) or a hardware problem, for instance that, maybe, my sound card can output spdif but only for 2Ch.

Question 1 - Before you answer with \"it just takes the smaller disk\", hear me out quick. My 3TB WD Reds come out to be 3001 GB in size. Let's say I set up a mirror via mdadm for sdb1 and sdc1 which span 100% of the drive. But suddenly, one of the drives fail. The replacement is a 3TB, weighing in at 3000 GB. What happens when I put in a drive that is smaller than the one currently existent on the array? I know with a new array using 3000 vs 3001, it would build the array to be 3000. But like I said, what about a current array @ 3001 and I add a smaller drive? Does it re-structure itself during the rebuild to be 3000 GB in size?\nQuestion 2 - In the event that I can't add a 3000 GB to the array with an existing 3001 GB and it simply downsize to 3000... can I resize the 3001 down a bit?\nQuestion 3 - Or, a better idea. What if I downsize my 3TB drive to be 2999 GB. That way whether the drive is short by 1 MB, 1 byte, 10 KB, doesn't matter, it'll always pick up the \"smaller\" drive @ 2999 GB.\n\nA: I came across this answer by mistake, but in case anyone is curious, here's an answer supported by experiments.\nThe Short Version\nBonus Question: can I create an md(4) RAID array out of block devices of unequal size? Yes, but the RAID array will have the size of the smallest block device (plus some overheads for its own housekeeping). If device sizes aren't within 1% of each other, you get a warning.\nQuestion 1: can I add to an existing md(4) RAID array a device smaller than the smallest current member? Nope, sorry. mdadm will flat out refuse to do that to protect your data.\nQuestion 2: can you resize an existing md array? Yes (read the mdadm manpge!), but it may not be worth the effort. You'll have to back everything up, then resize the contents of the RAID device, then resize the device itself — all of this is quite prone to errors, miscalculations, and other things that'll cost you your data (painful experience talking).\nIt's not worth the risk and effort. If you have a new, blank disk, here's how to resize it and also keep between one and two copies of all your data intact at all times (assuming you have 2-disk RAID1):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new md(4) array on it (with one disk missing).\n\n*Recreate the structure of the array contents (Crypto, LVM, partitions tables, any combination thereof, whatever floats your boat).\n\n*Copy the data from the existing disk to the new one.\n\n*Reboot, using the new disk.\n\n*Wipe the old disk's partition table (or zero the md(4) superblock). If necessary, create the required partitions to match the scheme on he new disk.\n\n*Add the old disk to the new array.\n\n*Wait for the array members to sync. Have some coffee. Fly to Latin America and pick your own coffee beans, for that matter. :) (If you live in Latin America, fly to Africa instead).\n\n\nNote: yes, this is the same technique 0xC0000022L described in his answer.\nQuestion 3. What if the drive is 1G short? :) Don't worry about it. Chances are your replacement drive will be bigger. In fact, with a strategy like above it pays to get cheaper larger drives whenever one fails (or for a cheaper upgrade). You can get a progressive upgrade.\nExperimental Proof\nExperimental Setup\nFirst, let's fake some block devices. We'll use /tmp/sdx and /tmp/sdy (each 100M), and /tmp/sdz (99M).\ncd /tmp\ndd if=/dev/zero of=sdx bs=1M count=100\nsudo losetup -f sdx\ndd if=/dev/zero of=sdy bs=1M count=100\nsudo losetup -f sdy\ndd if=/dev/zero of=sdz bs=1M count=99  # Here's a smaller one!\nsudo losetup -f sdz\n\nThis sets up three files as three loopback block devices: /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1 and /dev/loop2, mapping to sdx, sdy and sdz respectively. Let's check the sizes:\nsudo grep loop[012] /proc/partitions\n   7        0     102400 loop0\n   7        1     102400 loop1\n   7        2     101376 loop2\n\nAs expected, we have two loop devices of exactly 100M (102400 KiB = 100 MiB) and one of 99M (exactly 99×1024 1K blocks).\nMaking a RAID Array out of Identically-Sized Devices\nHere goes:\nsudo mdadm  --create -e 1.2 -n 2 -l 1 /dev/md100 /dev/loop0 /dev/loop1\nmdadm: array /dev/md100 started.\n\nCheck the size:\nsudo grep md100 /proc/partitions\n   9      100     102272 md100\n\nThis is precicely what we expect: one look at the mdadm manual reminds us that version 1.2 metadata take up 128K: 128 + 102272 = 102400. Now let's destroy it in preparation for the second experiment.\nsudo mdadm --stop /dev/md100\nsudo mdadm --misc --zero-superblock /dev/loop0\nsudo mdadm --misc --zero-superblock /dev/loop1\n\nMaking a RAID Array out of Unequally Sized Devices\nThis time we'll use the small block device.\nsudo mdadm  --create -e 1.2 -n 2 -l 1 /dev/md100 /dev/loop0 /dev/loop2\nmdadm: largest drive (/dev/loop0) exceeds size (101248K) by more than 1%\nContinue creating array? y\nmdadm: array /dev/md100 started.\n\nWell, we got warned, but the array was made. Let's check the size:\nsudo grep md100 /proc/partitions\n   9      100     101248 md100\n\nWhat we get here is 101,248 blocks. 101248 + 128 = 101376 = 99 × 1024. The usable space is that of the smallest device (plus the 128K RAID metadata). Let's bring it all down again for our last experiment:\nsudo mdadm --stop /dev/md100\nsudo mdadm --misc --zero-superblock /dev/loop0\nsudo mdadm --misc --zero-superblock /dev/loop2\n\nAnd Finally: Adding a smaller Device to a Running Array\nFirst, let's make a RAID1 array with just one of the 100M disks. The array will be degraded, but we don't really care. We just want a started array. The missing keywords is a placeholder that says ‘I don't have a device for you yet, start he array now and I'll add one later’.\nsudo mdadm  --create -e 1.2 -n 2 -l 1 /dev/md100 /dev/loop0 missing\n\nAgain, let's check the size:\nsudo grep md100 /proc/partitions\n   9      100     102272 md100\n\nSure enough, it's 128K short of 102400 blocks. Adding the smaller disk:\nsudo mdadm  --add /dev/md100 /dev/loop2\nmdadm: /dev/loop2 not large enough to join array\n\nBoom! It won't let us, and the error is very clear.\n\nA: There are several ways to set up mdX devices. The method would be to use gdisk (or sgdisk if you prefer the command-line only version) to partition this as GPT. If you want to boot from the array create a \"BIOS Boot Partition\", type code ef02. This is only necessary if you want to boot off this array, otherwise no need to care. Then, create a partition the same size or smaller than the smallest disk to be added to the array. Last but not least, copy the GPT data over to the other disk (expert menu in gdisk, using x, and then u and specify the target device). This is a destructive process.\nIt should be possible - if the file system allows for it - to resize an existing partition to something smaller and then use the same method to copy the GPT data. However, this gets you into a bit of a kerfuffle. Because now you have two disks, but still no mdX device. One of them has to be prepared as mdX, either partition-wise (which I implied above) or disk-wise) and then the data must be moved from the existing disk to that.\nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*big disk (/dev/sda) contains data, data is smaller than 3001 GB, partitions are not\n\n*smaller disk /dev/sdb gets added to the system\n\n*you partition /dev/sdb with gdisk\n\n*you create an array from each respective partition (mdadm -C /dev/md2 -l 1 -n 1 /dev/sdb2)\n\n*you create file systems on the new arrays\n\n*you copy all data over, making sure that your system will be prepared to run off a GPT disk and making GRUB2 understand the implications (see below)\n\n*you copy the GPT partitioning data over from /dev/sdb to /dev/sda\n\n*you add the \"raw\" partitions from /dev/sda into the existing arrays\n\n*you wait for /proc/mdstat to show you that the synching is done\n\n\nIf you followed all steps you should now be able to boot into the new system off the mdX arrays. However, keep a rescue CD or a PXE boot option handy, just in case.\n\nGRUB2 will not be able to recognize the setup off hand. So you need some \"magic\". Here's a one-liner:\nfor i in /dev/disk/by-id/md-uuid-*; do DEV=$(readlink $i); echo \"(${DEV##*/}) $i\"; done|sort|tee /boot/grub/devicemap\n\nOr let's be more verbose:\nfor i in /dev/disk/by-id/md-uuid-*\ndo\n  DEV=$(readlink $i)\n  echo \"(${DEV##*/}) $i\"\ndone|sort|sudo tee /boot/grub/devicemap\n\nThis creates (or overwrites) the default /boot/grub/devicemap with one that tells GRUB2 where to find each respective disk. The result would be something like this list:\n(md0) /dev/disk/by-id/md-uuid-...\n(md2) /dev/disk/by-id/md-uuid-...\n(md3) /dev/disk/by-id/md-uuid-...\n(md4) /dev/disk/by-id/md-uuid-...\n\nIf you use legacy GRUB, you also need to create the \"BIOS Boot Partition\" with meta-data version 0.9, using mdadm -e 0 ... and the process will differ. I haven't done that, though.\n", "Q: How to enable flash only for FIreFox I have two browser on my Ubuntu 12.10 64bit. Chromium and FireFox.\nI want to install flash player but only for FireFox to play game and music. But not for Chromium.\nCan someone show me how to do that?\n\nA: Assuming you have successfully installed Flash and that it works for Firefox, you can simply prevent Chromium from using Flash. To do so, type about:plugins in the Chromium browser's address bar and hit Enter.  \nThen look at the list of plug-ins enabled, and just disable anything related to Flash.\nSuch a step will only affect Chromium and not Firefox.\nNote that Firefox has a click-to-play option for plug-ins as well. If you wish to enable that feature, type about:config in the Firefox address bar and press Enter. Answer okay in the resulting screen and then, in the next screen, type click and look for a line with plugins.click_to_play. Go to that line and pressing Enter will toggle the click-to-play feature on or off.\n\nI don't use 64-bit myself and have heard that getting Flash to work may be problematic, but, in any case, make sure you have allowed ubuntu-restricted-extras and run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer\n\n", "Q: Upgrade from Ubuntu 12.04 To Ubuntu 12.10 Secure-Remix Is it possible to upgrade an existing Ubuntu 12.04 install to Ubuntu 12.10 Secure-Remix? If so, could that HD be swapped into a new UEFI PC (as the only HD) and would it boot? \n\nA: \nIs it possible to upgrade an existing Ubuntu 12.04 install to Ubuntu\n  12.10 Secure-Remix?\n\nYes, you can upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 Secure Remix, by:\n\n\n*\n\n*either using a 12.10SecureRemix this way:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuReinstallation \n\n*or upgrading\nfrom 12.04 to standard 12.10, then install Boot-Repair and\nOS-Uninstaller. (in your situation, Clean-Ubiquity is useless).\n\n\n\nIf so, could that HD be swapped into a new UEFI PC (as the only HD)\n  and would it boot?\n\nNo, you can't upgrade and change your HD's partitioning type (MsDos <-> GPT/UEFI) at the same time.\n", "Q: change Wifi key I was trying to connect to wifi on ubuntu 12.4 when I accidentally typed in the wrong wifi key.

Sometimes, when info is being collected by ubuntu-bug (either automatically following a program crash or by manually calling it) the following dialog pops up:\n\nShould I include these files or not? What is \"dangerous\" about someone else know my computer's hostname?\n\nA: General recommendation: \n\n\n*\n\n*If you know what are you doing and that compromising your logs is not a threat to you, you can include logs to the error. \n\n*Or if you feel pretty safe, as security is not your business and your Linux is test or similar installation, you can include them.\n\n*From display manager there should not be anything about your networking, so I think it is pretty safe to include logs. Maximum threat is, that community will see what types of monitors you use - but I cannot guarantee that. \n\n*If this is not the matter, (so you don't know what you are doing, you work in \"secured\" environment, etc. ) it is better NOT to include the information. Remember, that these logs are accessible to the ubuntu community so almost everybody can read it / or you have no control who is reading. But in general, this cannot harm your computer. \n\n\nFinally, it is up to you.\n\nA: The software uses several data sources for a bug report. One such source is your user environment. This is the content of the file /proc/PID/env where PID is the process ID of a specific process. In the case of a networking program this might reveal to which servers you are connected. Some software allows it to enter a password as commandline option.\nAlso a hostname can be sensitive. Just assume you are working inside a company. The fact itself that you're working there, could be revealed through a hostname and might be sensitive.\nSo in many cases a hostname will not sensitive per se, but with additional information it can easily get sensitive or sometimes dangerous.\nThe error message is just a reminder for you to reflect if your hostname or other information are worth being protected. If no, all is OK. If yes, you should modify the report.\n", "Q: How can i recover a raw ISO file to a partition?

Or, sdc itself might have some physical errors, personally I've had some problems with usb flash memory (sd cards, thumbdrives) and multiple partitions.\nOr maybe there's a problem with the partition backup (hbcd.iso), try\nfsck.msdos -n /var/isos/hbcd.iso\n\nand see if it likes the fat32 partition or not. (-n makes no changes, just to check)\nOr First, to just get the data, directly mounting the hbcd.iso file should work if it's a good fat32 filesystem, then you could copy everything out of it without playing with sdc at all. Testdisk can copy the files out of it directly too and may work better if there's some problems with it (run testdisk hbcd.iso). Something like this should work:\nmount -o loop,ro hbcd.iso [somedir]\n\nAnd if mounting & testdisk can't read the filesystem then photorec (part of the testdisk package) can carve the data out of hbcd.iso, but it probably won't keep any original filenames. I think sleuthkit should have some good data carving tools, maybe even testdisk/photorec.\nDon't forget the data recovery rule: MAKE A BACKUP COPY AND PLAY WITH IT FIRST!\nOtherwise some small typo or a naughty program could erase everything, so backup that hbcd.iso.\n\nA: From how I understand dd, it reads what it can and copies the data it gets. \nBut if there is an error, there is no data so nothing to copy and nothing gets written into the output\n- so with conv=noerror you get a mismatch/offset between actual data and sector/block numbering. \nYou need conv=sync,noerror to neutralize that effect. sync adds 'NUL' data (zero bytes here) to fill the gaps and keep the following blocks where they should be in the output (image file).\n", "Q: Thousands of pam_unix log entries in logwatch My logwatch reports, within the CRON section, contain thousands of entries like those below.

Originally my laptop came with Windows 8. After enabling legacy OS in the BIOS I was able to install Windows 7, but I installed in on the original Windows 8 partition structure, but when I tried to install Ubuntu, the option to install alongside Windows was not available. I tried Windows repair to see if maybe the boot structure was install incorrectly, reboot after reboot, tweaks left and right inside Windows, and the BIOS to try and allow Ubuntu to load side by side with Windows but nothing worked. I ended up having to re-install Windows 7 and wiping the entire HDD when I did it. Once the HDD was wiped and a fresh install of Windows 7 was loaded, Ubuntu showed the option to install along with windows.\nMy best guess as to why I had the issue was that with the original set up, UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, along with the format did not allow for Ubuntu to accurately check for other OS's. Unfortunately I an not Ubuntu savvy enough to figure it out on my own.\nI do hope that this helps a little.\n", "Q: I can't dim my laptop's light I can't modify my laptop brightness.

I used to use Lubuntu, as chromium used to have it, but now it doesn't work. The reason I want it pre-installed is that I use it a lot as a live CD.\nThanks\n\nA: There is a way to make changes persist that are made in a live session. It relies on a mechanism that searches all drives for a filesystem with the label \"casper-rw\". It will mount that filesystem as a writeable overlay over the non-persistant filesystem (this is called a union mount).\nThere are multiple ways on how to go about this. If you want to continue booting from a CD, then you can plug in a USB stick (before booting the live session, not after -- it must be present while the live session is booting).\nOr you could make the USB stick contain two partitions, one with the bootable live system and a second partition with the \"casper-rw\" filesystem.\nThe details can be found here (read them in this order, the first article seems more to the point):\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD/Persistence\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Can't Play DVDs with Libdvdcss installed I've installed VLC, libdvdread4, libdvdcss, Medibuntu and Ubuntu restricted extras AND ran this line of code...\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\n\n...on my Ubuntu 12.04 but whenever I start a DVD, whether it be with or without DVD menus the VLC player does not play.

I just recently installed Ubuntu on our desktop PC and my father uses an Forerunner 305 GPS wristwatch when he goes out for a jog.\nOn Windows he always used the the program Garmin Trainingscenter to import the data gathered during his run (things like the route he did, speed, distance etc.). I searched on internet and saw that Pytrainer was a program which offered the same features and also had support for the Forerunner 305.\nSo I installed it but when I press the \"import\" button, initially it looks like he is importing the data (the Forerunner gives a bleep and a progress bar is running). But when he is done, nothing shows up in the program.\nIs there someone here who also has this GPS watch and got it to work under Ubuntu? If so, is there something I am doing wrong? I am using the latest version of Pytrainer (version 1.9.2-dev) and \"gpsbabel\" (a program needed to communicate with the watch) that came with Ubuntu 12.10.\nUpdate 7 February\nI was just experimenting and I tried an import via the garmin-forerunner-tools package instead of gpsbabel. Although results didn't show up in Pytrainer, it did create a .dump file in the ~/.pytrainer/tmp folder. I tried to manually import that file and that actually showed up in Pytrainer! :D\nAlright, it's a very dirty workaround but we at least know that communication and exporting works. Now to just let Pytrainer import automatically when I press the button\n\nA: Alright. Somehow I got it to work by myself.. I am not sure how I did it, but if you are, like me, having trouble getting your Forerunner 305 to work on Ubuntu, I'll describe what I did here.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you haven't already, install Pytrainer trough the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n*You'll also need to install an extra library in order to communicate with the Forerunner so execute this command in the terminal, or search for the package in the USC: sudo apt-get install garmin-forerunner-tools\n\n*Now open up Pytrainer and open in the menu Tools > GPS Device Plugins\n\n*Select the \"Garmin via garmintools\" option and press \"Preferences\"\n\n*Enable the plugin by selecting the \"Enable\" option under Status.\n\n*Now connect your Forerunner to the PC with the USB cable and go to File > Import from Garmin GPS Device (via garmintools)\n\n*Notice that your device gives a beep and a progress bar will show. It might seem like the program crashed (Pytrainer turns grey) but after a few seconds it should come back to live, and your activities should show up in Pytrainer!\n\n\nIf you run into problems, make sure that there is an recorded activity that is not older than 30 days! Pytrainer will not import activities that are older than that. You can change this default value in the preferences.\nI also saw somewhere on a site that it might fail to import your tracks when there is one with a special character in it's name. So make sure you won't name any tracks with special characters.\nTook me a while to figure all this out since there is not a whole lot of information about it on the internet.

This can be easily installed by running the following in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs \nGive that a go. If it works without using sudo and your above edit, then happy days!

In most set ups there's just one of it in a home network and both wireless and wired are connected at layer 2.\nSuppose one host is called host1 and the other host2, then you should be able to talk to each other using host1.local and host2.local.

Generally it comes pre installed but in case  you don't have it then do it quickly.\nStep 2:\nDownload the latest Ultrasurf file from the website http://ultrasurf.us/  . Unzip the downloaded file and you will get a .exe file.\nStep 3:\nOnce you are done with step 1 and step 2, you just need to download two more file and you are done.\n   -> mfc42.dll  \n\n   -> msvcp60.dll \n\nStep 4:\nPretty much done. Now you just have to copy both the files at two places. Go to your Home folder and press Ctrl+H. This shows up the hidden files. Locate .wine. Inside the folder follow the path\n         drive_c/windows/system\n         drive_c/windows/system32\n Paste both the files in both the location. Now you are done.\nStep 5:\nNow open the .exe file with the help of wine. It takes a while for Ultrasurf to load in Ubuntu, so be patient. Once the software loads change the settings just as you do in Windows.\nThats it !! All set to go ....\n", "Q: Can I cache an mdadm raid with an ssd? I have a 1TB array set up in raid 1 using mdadm on Ubuntu 8, to store mission-critical files. I'd like to speed up read/write, especially for large files by caching to an SSD. Is this possible? Does mdadm contain a facility to cache to another drive?\nAlternatively, is there something I should do to assign ordinary RAM to caching? There is 4GB RAM and files to be written are rarely larger than 1GB so I'm thinking writes should be quite quick just with RAM caching alone.\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: \nDoes mdadm contain a facility to cache to another drive?\n\nNo, the Linux software raid (managed by mdadm) is purely for creating a set of disks for redundancy purposes.1\nI know of two projects that will let you do this: dm-cache and flashcache (both relatively experimental). It enables you to use your SSD as cache (read and write) for your slower hard drives or any other block device such as an md device. Both offer huge performance gain and are very tweakable to find balance in durability and performance.\nUnfortunately, this not yet packaged or included in the kernel as of this time. Therefore it's not a very straightforward task to do in Ubuntu. Feel free to get your hands dirty, but remember it's a bit of experimental software and hard to get support on.\nRelated questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install and use flashcache/bcache to cache HDD to SSD?\n\n*raid advice with SSD and two HDD\n1 However, you can hint the kernel to use one of the drives for reading primarily, to get some improvement in reading performance, but this is not quite the same as a real SSD cache. See this answer by Gilles on how to do this.\n\n\nis there something I should do to assign ordinary RAM to caching?\n\nThis is already enabled in every Linux kernel! You can see the amount of cached pages by using free:\nfree -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:         24047      17703       6343          0       6492       3550\n-/+ buffers/cache:       7660      16386\nSwap:         3811          0       3811\n\nHere you see that it has now 3550 MB of pages (file system level) in cache, and 6492 MB of pages (block device level) on my machine. Reads to one of those will not result in a read from disk.\nTo demonstrate block-level caches this, try this command:\nhdparm -Tt /dev/md127  # replace with your device - try both disks and md devices!\n\n/dev/md127:\n Timing cached reads:   8624 MB in  2.00 seconds = 4313.50 MB/sec\n Timing buffered disk reads: 282 MB in  2.93 seconds =  96.31 MB/sec\n\nThe first result is clearly coming from caches in memory, whereas the second is read directly from disk.\nTo demonstrate the file system based caching using dd:\n# first time\ndd if=/home/gert/bigfile.img of=/dev/null \n5927206912 bytes (5.9 GB) copied, 25.9253 s, 229 MB/s\n\n# second time\ndd if=/home/gert/bigfile.img of=/dev/null \n5927206912 bytes (5.9 GB) copied, 4.91444 s, 1.2 GB/s\n\n# third time, with file system cache disabled using iflag=direct\n# yields results similar to first one\n# Try using a bigger blocksize (bs=10M for example) if you're seeing very low speeds\ndd if=/home/gert/bigfile.img of=/dev/null iflag=direct\n\n\nA: A somewhat similar solution for RAID4/5/6:\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/md/raid5-cache.txt\nIt's an option to use an additional drive to your RAID4/5/6 configuration solely for caching purposes. There are also modes to either increase performance (read or write) or reliability.\n", "Q: How to solve mkv video problem on 12.04 I have a problem with playing mkv file on my laptop.\nI installed driver and working well.\nmkv file is full HD (1080p) and my pc is hd (720p).

The README files reads\n\nThe GNU Image Manipulation Program Version 2.2\nThis is version 2.2 of The GIMP.\n\nIt looks harmless by looking at the content.\n\n\n*\n\n*It has no install script hooks (preinst, postinst, etc.) in place. This means it's just a simple unpacking of files.\n\n*The above makes it very clear: it's not responsible for removing the package from your download folder.\n\n*The binaries themselves are hard to check. If you haven't run the program then you don't have to worry about it.\n\n*The quality of the package is really poor and it appears to be built by a very simple \"checkinstall\" script. This may explain why Software Centre wasn't able to handle it properly.\n\n\nSo, just remove it completely using your package management:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge gimpshop\n\n\nA: First of all open a Terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get purge gimpshop\n\nI have downloaded and analyzed the deb package linked by you, and it looks that it is not harmful. \nI don't know why the file disappeared from your Download folder.\n", "Q: Running Windows from Ubuntu I have a Windows Vista problem I'm trying to resolve with Ubuntu, but I'm not all that familiar with how to work one with the other. Vista went into an update loop while my wife was booting up our Acer Aspire 5515 a few days ago. Screen is stuck on installing Part 3 of 3 at 0% for over 5 hours. Can't boot into Safe Mode with command line, System Repair refuses to come up, so no System Restore or command line or anything else. Of course, the laptop came without any installation discs to boot from, and the recovery disks want to wipe the drive and reinstall Windows. Then I remember I have an older Ubuntu CD I was playing around with years ago. I can boot from that, but because of the \"unclean\" state left by the failed update, I have to force mount the Acer disk. So now I can see the drive.

Thanks for any insight offered.\n\nA: The chntpw  tool has limited registry editing capabilities.  I don't believe it comes with Ubuntu by default, you'll have to install it by clicking the link above, or opening a terminal and runing the following command: \nsudo apt-get install chntpw\nOnce you get the tool installed, you'll have to tell it which registry file to edit by entering chntpw <full registry file path> in the terminal.

I have an XP partition for gaming and could not open it through wine's editor.

You will need to boot from a LiveCD/USB and use GParted from there.\nAs far as I know you should just then be able to increase the extended partition (sda4) to fill the unallocated space, and then create a new NTFS partition within the extended space. It should not be necessary to change any existing installation, assuming they're all working at the moment.\nNote that Ubuntu will work quite happily without swap space (providing you delete the UUID=xxxxxxx none swap sw 0 0 line in /etc/fstab so it doesn't get unhappy being unable to find it on boot), providing you have sufficient RAM.\n", "Q: Dim/dark screen back after latest update [Ubuntu 12.04] I booted a few minutes ago and everything was fine, update manager notified me about new updates so I decided to install them, and then poof, dim/dark screen is back in action.\nI did update grub, I did tried to remve fglrx but terminal said I don't even have it installed and the \"classical\" fix I used is the\nsudo setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=01\nIt does work, but only till I reboot, I had same problem but I added this code before exit 0 from /etc/rc.local [gksudo gedit /etc/rc.local] now it's still here but it doesn't work.

In a .desktop file you can specify the Path key in a [Desktop Entry] so that the working directory will be that path when the Exec is launched. However, this key does not seem to work when launching items from Quicklist even though the Path key is set in the [Desktop Action] group. Am I doing something wrong or does Unity not support this yet? \nIf there's no way to do this, can I change the Exec key in some way to get the same effect?\nEDIT: \nFor testing purposes, here's an example little script (displaycwd.py) that when run displays the current working path in a Gtk window. There's an example .desktop file that follows showing that when run normally through the Launcher it opens with the right path (/home/ian/Documents in my case). However, activating it through a quicklist, displays the user directory (/home/ian in my case) instead. Just make sure to put the script somewhere in your $PATH.\n#!/usr/bin/python\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\nimport os\n\npwd=os.path.realpath(os.curdir)\n\nwin=Gtk.Window()\nlabel=Gtk.Label(pwd)\nwin.add(label)\nwin.show_all()\nwin.connect('destroy', Gtk.main_quit)\nGtk.main()\n\nAnd the .desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Display Working Directory\nExec=displaycwd.py\nType=Application\nActions=quicklist\nPath=/home/ian/Documents\nIcon=folder\n\n[Desktop Action quicklist]\nName=QL Display WD\nExec=displaycwd.py\nPath=/home/ian/Documents\n\n\nA: Ok, I found a way around that, since it seems that the quicklist ignores the path and other variables, we can create a script that changes the directory, then executes your program.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file called cd.sh or title of your choice, In that file use the following text:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /home/ian/Documents\ndisplaycwd.py\n\n\n*Mark the file as executable, Right-Click > Properties > Permissions > Allow this file to run as Program.\nOr in terminal: \nchmod +x cd.sh \n\n\n*Place cd.sh in the same location you have displaycwd.py and change the Quicklist to:\n[Desktop Action quicklist]\nName=QL Display WD\nExec=cd.sh\n\nThis makes the quicklist first call a shell-script that changes the directory, then runs your program.\n\nSolution #2\nAfter looking around I think you can change the Exec line to this:\nExec=bash -c \"cd /home/ian/Documents && displaycwd.py\"\n\nTo pass a string through bash, that changes the directory then runs your program.\n", "Q: NVidia gt620m on Ubuntu 12.04 buyed a new pc with a nvidia gt620m.\nSomeone can help me to install the right drivers? thank you.

The Linux Nvidia drivers work for most Nvidia cards. Pick one of the ones that say \"proprietary\" to install a set of drivers from Nvidia (I recommend the one that says \"stable, tested\"). You'll likely be asked to restart, if you aren't, I recommend doing so anyway, as it's the easy way to activate the driver.\n\n*Update your graphics settings. Once the driver is installed, it will likely change your settings to something crazy like 640x480. You'll want to change that by opening Dash and searching for \"Nvidia Settings\".

I have two monitors set up, one is my laptop monitor and the other is an external display.

After all this years nothing has been fixed, but at least I have an easier workaround for this problem.\nI open a Files window (nautilus, nemo, etc.) and navigate to the Desktop folder. I select all my files and just drag and drop them anywhere I want in the visible (and accessible) desktop. No files get copied or cut since it's just a rearrange inside the same folder from two different interfaces. This way you don't have to be constantly changing the Monitor's configuration.\nThe problem still persist if you want to save or create new files on your desktop, because they all get created and/or saved in the inaccessible part of the desktop.\n\nA: Similar problem here. But as Ubuntu remembers the icon position (it seems even depending on monitor setup), there is a (ugly) workaround.\nI use my laptop at home (single-monitor setup, enternainment purposes, soft work) and at work (dual monitor, one taller than the other). When i stick an USB memory, ubuntu creates an icon on desktop, perfectly visible. But when i go to work and try to use it, i know the icon is there (using keyboard arrows to navigate I can reach it, and intro does open it), but out of view (as ubuntu never seen it in this monitor setup, it uses the last known position... the one in the other setup, out of current view. \nIn these cases, i use to change (temporarily) my desktop setup, moving the laptop's desktop position to one the icon is in, then moving the icon to a visible area in the other monitor, then return to my favourite setup, then moving te icon where i really want it to be. It's a tedious manner, but it works, without changing files, or scripting, nor nothing.\nOr you can try to automate:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1472774\n\nA: I kind of suspect that \"Organize Desktop by name\" is the cause of all this, it will put all the icons in a long vertical column regardless if there is an actual monitor below current monitor to show the complete line of icon.

It's called gifview and it's an old version of gifsicle; you can get it by installing gifsicle. The really interesting option is -w where you specify the window to open the gifs (so you can make all go to the same acting pretty much like feh), it still doesn't accept command inputs but it's close enough.\n\nA: Try sxiv with the -animate flag.\nsxiv -a\n\n\n\nSimple X Image Viewer\nThe primary goal of sxiv is to create an image viewer, which only has the most basic features required for fast image viewing (the ones I want).

Is there any benefit to using the raid flag since it appears mdadm seems to work with or without it?\n\nA: Linux software RAID doesn't care about this flag, as far as I know. It identifies the volumes by scanning them for the appropriate metadata on specific locations (superblocks).\nYou can check this yourself manually by this command:\nmdadm --examine /dev/sda1                              # part of an array\n/dev/sda1:\n          Magic : a92b4efc\n        Version : 0.90.00\n           UUID : a20e36c2:a217b925:f3fd9ffa:59263103  # Array identifier\n[...]\n\nmdadm --examine /dev/sdc2                              # not part of an array\nmdadm: No md superblock detected on /dev/sdc2.\n\nWith mdadm it's also possible to create an array on a volume without any form of partitioning, so, that also indicates me it will just work without.\n\nDoes mdadm auto-add the raid flag once you add the drives to the array and begin building?\n\nIt doesn't touch partitions or partition tables.

I need it to install Ubuntu with encrypted LVM. When I use automatic partitioning everything is be okay and works. But the machine sets 2 gigabytes SWAP, an unreasonably high value. I could use manual partitioning with standard sections of course, but god I cannot figure out how to set up LVM. Is there a section VLM with encryption, but failed to implement it into my / swap as it does automaton. Could someone please advise?\n\nA: The alternate installer has the ability to set up and install to LVM, and is the supported way of doing so. You can install the lvm2 package on an existing system, or the desktop livecd and manually set it up, and then install to it. This is what I will cover. (Ubuntu 12.10 has since introduced LVM support from the installation live CD.)\nFirst, you need a Physical Volume. Typically you start with a hard disk, and create an LVM type partition on it. You can create one with gparted or fdisk, and usually only want one partition to use the whole disk, since LVM will handle subdividing it into Logical Volumes. In gparted, you need to check the lvm flag when creating the partition, and with fdisk, tag the type with code 8e.\nOnce you have your LVM partition, you need to initialize it as a Physical Volume. Assuming this partition is /dev/sda1:\nsudo pvcreate /dev/sda1\nThis writes the LVM header to the partition, which identifies it as a Physical Volume, and sets up a small area to hold the metadata describing everything about the Volume Group, and the the rest of the partition as unused Physical Extents. After that, you need to create a Volume Group named foo:\nsudo vgcreate foo /dev/sda1\nNow you have a Volume Group named foo. I suggest you change foo to a name meaningful to you. foo contains only one Physical Volume. Now you want to create a Logical Volume from some of the free space in foo:\nsudo lvcreate -n bar -L 5g foo \nThis creates a Logical Volume named bar in Volume Group foo using 5 GB of space. If you are installing, you probably want to create a Logical Volume like this to use as a root filesystem, and one for swap, and maybe one for /home. I currently have a Logical Volume for a Lucid install, and one for a Maverick install, so that is what I named those volumes. You can find the block device for this Logical Volume in '/dev/foo/bar' or 'dev/mapper/foo-bar'.\nYou might also want to try the lvs and pvs commands, which list the Logical Volumes and Physical Volumes respectively, and their more detailed variants; lvdisplay and pvdisplay.\nIf you are doing this from the desktop livecd, once you have created your Logical Volumes from the terminal, you can run the installer, and use manual partitioning to select how to use each Logical Volume, and then install. \n", "Q: Change decimal mark in calculator In Germany we use , as decimal mark instead of ..

How to configure this?\nAlso, what is the preferred approach to cache the packages in CentOS?\n\nA: It's been working ok for me using the latest apt-cacher-ng on 12.04 from the backports (sudo apt-get install apt-cacher-ng/precise-backports).  Otherwise you need to edit the VfilePattern in acng.cnf to add some of the centos/rhel patterns.\nSee this for more info: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt-cacher-ng/+bug/1006844\n\nA: Backports version contains more fixes than just the one listed in the bug above.  If you just use the Precise ordinary version (with the fix above), you get the following error\n403 Forbidden file type or location\nBecause the first thing Centos does is check for local mirror locations with this\nhttp://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=6&arch=x86_64&repo=os\nAnd something in that URL is not liked by apt-cacher-ng.  \nThe Precise backports version fixes this issue.\nYou can verify you have (or have fixed) the issue from your Ubuntu machine with these steps.\n1) Firstly, set wget to use your apt-cacher-ng proxy\nnano ~/.wgetrc\n# wget run control file for current user\n# tell wget to use a proxy, apt-cacher-ng which listens on 3142\nhttp_proxy=localhost:3142\n\n2) Now ask wget to retrieve the mirror file. Note the extra \\'s to escape the '&' to get the full url to wget\nwget --output-document=- http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=6\\&arch=x86_64\\&repo=os\n\n3) This will answer back with either 403 error as above (problem not yet fixed), or a correct list of mirrors...\nhttp://mirror.xnet.co.nz/pub/centos/6.4/os/x86_64/\n", "Q: Printing from Firefox to network printer does not work I just noticed that since using Ubuntu 12.04(.01) or since some update (can't tell it for sure) I cannot print from Firefox to my network printer (Samsung CLX-3175FN) any more.

Printer dialog called from Text editor or Evince says \"Ready to print.\". And although print dialog calling from Chromium gives the same wrong message (there is 13 % toner left says the web interface of the printer) Chromium prints it out fine.\nWhat can be the reason?\n\nA: I had the same problem printing from Firefox to a HP3055 network printer.

And using the upper command the output file only contains the default marked audiostream and subtitle. Is there any additional command to copy all containing audiostreams and subtitles?\n\nA: To force FFmpeg/Libav to copy all input streams to the output, use the -map 0 option.\nffmpeg -i in.mkv \\\n       -map 0 -c copy \\\n       -c:v mpeg2video -qscale:v 2 \\\n       out.mkv\n\nFFmpeg and Libav should behave the same way here. See How to use -map option on the FFmpeg wiki. Try the suggested '-qscale:v 2' option in this commandline, it should give excellent results, or simply keep the bitrate options as specified in your own post.\n", "Q: Trouble logging into newly installed Ubuntu 12.04 I've installed Ubuntu 12.04, but when I login it says bryan@ubuntu:~$ and waits for me to type something. Is it supposed to be the password or is there a command I'm supposed to enter?\nThank you!\n\nA: Since you see bryan@ubuntu:~$, you are already logged in. bryan is logged on at (@) the machine which you named ubuntu. The ~ shows where you are in the file system (~ means home folder) and the $ means it is waiting for your commands.\nUbuntu Server is meant to be used from the command line (mainly for server administration). If you want to have a graphical environment (windows, icons, buttons, mouse pointer and such), you should install Ubuntu Desktop instead of Ubuntu Server.\n", "Q: 12.04 LTS updated today and now throws me back to login screen after logging in I allowed the update to run and once it finished, I restarted.  Now it will not accept my password.  I can log in as a guest, but can not access most of my programs or files.  Additionally, when I enter my password, it seems to begin the login process but after the screen flashing black (there are some lines displayed but it flashes too rapidly to see) the system returns me to the log in screen.\nI tried logging in in terminal and this is the error I get:\nLast login: Fri Feb 1 09:15:55 EST 2013 on tty1    \nWelcome to Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-37-generic x86_64) \n\n * Documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/\n\n[1] keyct1_search: Required key not available Perhaps try the interactive 'encryptfs-mount-private' \n\nI am a purely cut/paste user.  This is really getting to be an issue.  For each of the past three updates that required a restart, my system has failed to restart for a variety of reasons...\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Reboot and then select previous version in recovery mode. Then go to settings, users and create another administrator and password. Select the new administrator as the default and click the lock button. Restart system and login with new user name and password. \n", "Q: Running executable txt.file in terminal by default Basically, I have the code I need to run the thread to start my Minecraft server in an executable text file. When I click it, it asks me what I want to do with it: Run In Terminal, Display or just Run. \nBecause I want to create a link to it and then put that link in Docky, I need a way of setting it to Run In Terminal by default. I found a way to make it Run by default, but I need to run it in terminal.\n\nA: Open the Dash and search for Main Menu. (It's in the Software Center if it's not installed.) Open it and create a new item. Type in the name you want it to have, then type in the command line:\ngnome-terminal -x executable_text_file_path/and_name\n\nFor instance, I have a Shell Script folder in my Home folder. To run one of them in Terminal, I would type in...\ngnome-terminal -x \"Shell Scripts/script_name.sh\"\n\nI only used the quotation marks because I have spaces in the names. If you have no spaces, you don't need the quotation marks.\nYou should now be able to go to the Dash and type in the name you gave your program. A single click on it will start it in Terminal mode - or just drag it to your Launcher!\n\nA: As this file is executable, it's by default treated as such. You are asked to run or open it, as a feature of Nautilus (the file browser). When creating a shortcut to it, simply make a shortcut to an application (an executable), and select your script file. This will run the file instead of opening it.\nOn the other hand, if you wanted to make a shortcut to opening this file, you would select gedit (or any editor you like) as the executable, and pass the path to your script as an argument.\n", "Q: Disable Mouse Movement in Tap Zones on Synaptics Trackpad I have an HP dv6-3160 with a \"soft\" trackpad e.g. the buttons are part of it.\nUbuntu 12.10 works well with it apart from when I want to drag+drop. Because the mouse movement area includes the buttons if I'm holding down the left button I can mess everything up just by a twitch of my left finger (I can of course use tap-to-click and then move things but only up!).\nWhat I'd like to do is be able to set a \"dead zone\" - just stop all mouse movement in the button area (I have enough space above).\nInstalled the synaptics package and tried using synclient and setting BottomEdge but no matter what (valid - if I set it too low it errors) value I set it to the mouse behaviour doesn't change.\nMany thanks in advance.\n\nA: I just ran into this problem myself and sadly it's a matter of RTFM, because it gets described in the manual pretty clearly (Look it up here: http://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.5/doc/man/man4/synaptics.4.html).\nThe relevant value is \"AreaBottomEdge\" and the manual says \"Ignore movements, scrolling and tapping which take place below this edge. The option is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the AreaBottomEdge option to any integer value other than zero.\"\nSo to try it out you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a synclient -l | grep BottomEdge to find out your touchpads bottom edge.\n\n*Let x be the value of BottomEdge minus the height of your wanted deadzone\n\n*Do a synclient AreaBottomEdge=x\n\n*For it to be permanent put it as an \"Option\" in the 50-synaptics.conf file (Don't know where it is on Ubuntu, I'm on Archlinux and there its /etc/X11/xorg.d/50-synaptics)\n\n\nAnyway, hope this helps.\n", "Q: How to install packages per-user? I'd like to install programs without affecting other users on a box.  I can imagine a parallel install tree (lib, bin, man, etc.) in my user directory.\nCan apt-get do that, or is there another technique that would work?\n\nA: Easiest way, IMO, is to compile from source.\nJust specify a location with 'prefix'\n./configure --prefix=/home/your_user/\nmake\nmake install\n\nOften the hardest part of compiling is installing the dependencies.\n", "Q: Counting files per owner recursively From an entire directory structure I would like to output all the owners and how many files belong to each owner. \nI would like an output like this:\n+-------+-----+\n| alex  |   3 |\n| liza  | 345 |\n| harry | 564 |\n| sally |  23 |\n+-------+-----+\n\nHow can I do this in bash?\n\nA: This won't draw the pretty lines but...\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor _user in `ls /home`\ndo\n    _count=`ls -R /home/$_user/ | wc -l`\n    echo \"$_user = $_count\"\ndone\n\n\nA: I would suggest to use find and wc in a for-loop:\nusers=`getent passwd | awk -F: '{print $1}'`\nfor user in $users\ndo\n    echo -n \"file count for $user: \"\n    find / -user $user -type f | wc -l\ndone\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*find is recursive by default.\n\n*You may want to prepend the find line with sudo in order to have the privileges for reading all directories. Or run the complete script as root.\n\n*It now limits to listings of files by the -type f filter. Remove that if you want to count directories too.\n\n*It's not terribly efficient, as it's first listing all names, while wc -l then just counts the number of newlines.\n\n\n\nParsing ls -R is inaccurate for several reasons. Firstly, it lists directory entries twice. Secondly, it leaves an additional blank line while it descends into directories. Thirdly, you'll need to pass -a to count hidden files. And finally, it won't be possible to filter directories.\nSee the demo below:\nmkdir d1 d2 d3\ntouch a b c d1/a d2/a d3/a\ntree\n.\n├── a\n├── b\n├── c\n├── d1\n│   └── a\n├── d2\n│   └── a\n└── d3\n    └── a\n\n3 directories, 6 files\n\nfind . | wc -l\n11\n\nfind . -type f | wc -l\n7\n\nls -R | wc -l\n16\n\nls -R | cat -   # to show why the number was 16\n.:\na\nb\nc\nd1\nd2\nd3\n\n./d1:\na\n\n./d2:\na\n\n./d3:\na\n\n\nA: Consider using the Linux quota system. You'll have to enable it first and get it initialized, but it will require a lot less resources for creating a report.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the quota package.\n\n*Add the usrquota mount option to the file system in /etc/fstab.\n\n*Remount or reboot the file system.\n\n*Do the initial quota scan by running quotacheck -avug.\n\n*Run repquota to list the usage. The File limits (used) column lists the amount of 'files' per user. However, it's not quite the same as the amount of actual files, but it's the number of inodes.\n                        Block limits                File limits\nUser            used    soft    hard  grace    used  soft  hard  grace\n------------------------------------------------------\nroot      --   80088       0       0          12025     0     0       \ndaemon    --       8       0       0              3     0     0       \nman       --     172       0       0             17     0     0       \n\nTo get a new report on a later time, it's only required to run repquota and this will run a lot quicker than running find all over again!\nNote: it's not needed to set actual quota limits - just use it for reporting.\n\nA: Based on Ed Manet's answer, this will print the lines around the file counts:\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"+---------------+-------+\"\nfor _user in `ls /home`\ndo\n    _count=`ls -R /home/$_user/ | wc -l`\n    printf \"| $_user\\t| $_count\\t|\\n\"\ndone\necho \"+---------------+-------+\"\n\nNote that this works by counting the files in each user's home directory, so it can only scan the /home/ directory, and also it won't work correctly if one user has files in another user's directory.\n", "Q: Failed rebooting ubuntu 12.10 after installation in VirtualBox I tried to install Ubuntu 12.10 i386 with the latest VirtualBox on windows 8 x64 pro sony vaio vpcf11e1r. At the end of installation I waited for about 10 minutes observing the system is going down for reboot now! and reset vm manually. New boot resulted in the same installation procedure asking to try or install it again. Why the reboot failed?\n\nA: Your VM is booting the ISO/CD Image, not the Installed system.\nThat happens because you still have the ISO or CD in the VM drive un mount it, eject it and reboot the VM. \nSource and credit to Uri Herrera from comments: \n", "Q: How to copy into with cp if destination folder already exists? Example...\nThis is what I want.\n/tmp $ cp -f -R --verbose /tmp/a /tmp/b\n`/tmp/a' -> `/tmp/b'\n`/tmp/a/file2' -> `/tmp/b/file2'\n`/tmp/a/file1' -> `/tmp/b/file1'\n\nThis is what I do not want.\n/tmp $ cp -f -R --verbose /tmp/a /tmp/b\n`/tmp/a' -> `/tmp/b/a'\n`/tmp/a/file2' -> `/tmp/b/a/file2'\n`/tmp/a/file1' -> `/tmp/b/a/file1'\n\nHow can I let cp behave as if the folder didn't already exist?\n(I don't want to delete it beforehand. Just some files from /tmp/a to get copied into /tmp/b without creating a sub folder a inside /tmp/b. So it looks like /tmp/b/file1 /tmp/b/file2 and so on.)\n\nA: Assuming Bash you can do\n( shopt -s dotglob; cp -f -R --verbose /tmp/a/* /tmp/b/ )\n\nWhat this does is:\n\n\n*\n\n*it will make sure globs (the *) catch files with a dot in front. They are considered \"hidden\" by convention.\n\n** will expand before cp gets to see the command. So if there are two files as in your question the expanded command line will be cp -f -R --verbose /tmp/a/file1 /tmp/a/file1 /tmp/b/\n\n*finally the trailing backslash on the destination makes sure that it copies into that folder /tmp/b/.\n\n\nThis method also makes sure you don't have to reset the shell option, because it's being run in a subshell. You can achieve similar results by putting it into a script file instead of executing from the command line.\n\nA: Rsync was invented for this kind of thing.\nrsync -av --update /source/ /destination\n\nNB: Notice that /source/ has a trailing \"/\" which picks up file1, file2 and not the folder it is in.  /destination doesnt have a trailing. So your solution looks like this:\nrsync -av --update /tmp/a/ /tmp/b\n\n\nA: $ cp -r --verbose a/. b\n`a/.' -> `b'\n`a/./zzz' -> `b/zzz'\n\n$ cp -r --verbose a/. b\n`a/./zzz' -> `b/./zzz'\n\nI don't think I've seen this described anywhere; I was just trying different possibilities and found one that worked.  For all I know it's a natural consequence of how /. and cp work.  (As opposed to the syntax for rsync, mentioned in another answer, which is explicitly documented as a special case).\n\nA: The -T flag (AKA --no-target-directory) does what you want:\n$ cp -R --verbose -T /tmp/a /tmp/b\n`/tmp/a/file1' -> `/tmp/b/file1'\n`/tmp/a/file2' -> `/tmp/b/file2'\n\n", "Q: Attempting to re-install postgres fails due to rabbitmq On 12.04, when I do apt-get install on postgresql (which is already installed), it returns an error that mentions rabbitmq-server.

On my system, I believe that crashplan (backup software) was the cuplript.\nIncreasing the amount of resources dedicated to inotify fixed the issue.

Can anyone give me any idea if and when OpenCobol 1.1 is likely to be released on UBUNTU. The version that comes with Ubuntu does not have many of the commands available such as TRIM, WHEN-COMPILED and numerous other features in 1.1.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.10 and later come with OpenCobol 1.1. It's unlikely that there will be an official package for 12.04 or earlier. Maybe you can find a PPA or backport the package for 12.10 yourself.\n", "Q: How can i play acoustic guiter in Ubuntu? Like placing cords making leads and playing it Is there any package available for Ubuntu which allows me to create guiter music such as cords place and making lead melody, edit/delete/etc?\n\nA: TuxGuitar  might be what you're looking for.\nYou can find more info on TuxGuitar's website.\n", "Q: Is there any ubuntu API? in Windows, a programmer can use Windows API to write a Windows application. Windows API can be used with C (not necessarily C++). In Windows API you have a message loop and you have to program responses to different messages (eg a right click on client area).\nIs there any ubuntu API?\nI don't mean Qt or GTK. I'm looking for a raw (C/C++) API so that everything must be (re)designed. \n\nA: I came to Linux from a Win32 API background. Because Windows wraps up the equivalent of the Linux window manager and desktop environment into a single container, there just isn't a one-to-one match. Gtk and Qt really are more or less the equivalent to the Win API.\nKeeping in mind that the Win API itself in most cases is a wrapper on lower levels, if you really want to get down into the low-levels of the windowing system, you can look at X11 programming. For example, X Window System and Brief Intro to X11 Programming. But Gtk and Qt are designed to be wrappers around these functions.\n", "Q: Juju Charm, Deb Package or Puppet I have a django project which when deployed provides mysql-nss services. This dule use database setup requires automatic deployment by any basic server user. The first part is the creation of an sql database on localhost, followed by the configuration of mysql-nss for the server.\nEach client machine that wants to authentication then requires not just pointing at the new server's mysql database, but a very specific list of SQL commands which access the data. This specify leads me to believe that the server and client setups should be packaged for deployment.\nShould I use JuJu charms for server/client, should I use Debian packages to set everything just so, including over-riding the mysql-nss-bg package's config files. Or should I force users to learn pupper or similar technology to manage their clients and simply just provide a template config with the required sql commands?\nThe least complex, most secure solution is preferable.\n\nA: (I've asked more experienced people to look at this question but here's my kneejerk fast-response that might or might not be the right answer.)\nJuju doesn't really do what you want here, it's the wrong tool for the job. Juju is for deploying to clouds, it's not really designed for you to be able to mess with individual client machines. \nYour idea about custom .deb's seems like a better idea, however this sort of \"I need these packages installed on these machines and then I want to configure them this exact way\" looks more like a use case for puppet or chef. \nYou can install the stock mysql packages and then do all your database-y things as scripts. If you had custom mysql debs then you'd end up having to maintain these debs over time. \nGiven the amount of work being put into security updates and maintenance, you're probably better off using the stock packages and chef/puppeting to your needs post installation than maintaining your own custom debs. I'm not sure what your requirements are, just something to think about. \n", "Q: Ubuntu ARM ldd can't find libs I have a program that compiled fine on Ubuntu ARM (12.04) but it cannot run due to linking errrs. e.g. libX11.so.6 cannot be found, however it is clearly in \n/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf\n\nldconfig -v shows it as well\n\nWhat's weird is when I pass LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/arm-gnueabihf/ to ldd (after the shared library), I get the message\nldd: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/: No such file or directory\n\nWhile the directory clearly exists. What could be going wrong? I ran sudo ldconfig.\n\nA: You may have mixed ABIs. There are currently several ABIs for ARM processors in common use, due to the variety in ARM CPUs. Check that you have a gnueabihf binary, and not a gnueabi binary. You can install both kinds of binaries on the same system, but you can't link both kinds of libraries inside a single executable. It's like 32-bit and 64-bit executables on x86 systems.\nWith LD_LIBRARY_PATH, the right command to add the variable in the environment for the duration of the ldd command is\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ ldd /path/to/binary\n\nYou wrote ldd LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ /path/to/binary which tells ldd to act on a file called LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/.\n", "Q: After upgrade to 12.04, can only access wired and UNSECURED wireless networks I recently upgraded to 12.04 and during the upgrade installation notices my wireless signal indicator go to \"no wireless\". Since the upgrade, I can ONLY access the internet via a wired connection or an UNSECURED wireless connection. I do not like leaving my home wireless unsecured, however that is now my only option unless I want to go buy a 25' long ethernet cable to give me the ability to sit somewhere beside the floor near where my router is located. Any ideas as to what may have happened and/or how I can fix this bug so I can secure my home network once again?\n\nA: You may try this:   \nConnect an ethernet cable, install updates, install Additional Drivers, reboot. \nThen, open a terminal and type the following commands:\nsudo apt-get purge broadcom-sta-common broadcom-sta-source bcmwl-kernel-source  \nsudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer\n\nRestart again, and open up the \"Network\" program, and click the dropdown to select your network, and type your password.\nUnplug the ethernet cable and see if you can now access your wireless network.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Mysql Won't Install Error when i trying to install mysql-server on Ubuntu 12.04\nAppArmor parser error for /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld in /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld at line 9: abstractions/mysql\nstart: Job failed to start\n\nA: Ok, I wont share the time and failures on repairing a mysql install on 12.04 but here is what I did having most if not all the symptoms of multiple faulures. \n  sudo apt-get --purge apparmor \n\n(reinstall after done?) \n sudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-client-* mysql-server-* mysql-core-* mysql-workbench-* \n\n(the * is all files related to that tag \n sudo aptitude purge ~c \n\n(must have aptitude installed)\ncheck removal of all files by: \n sudo dpkg --get-selections \n\n(you can replace with sudo dpkg --get-selections | grep mysql) but i reccomend the first because a clean file structure runs well. \nThen reinstall using: \n sudo apt-get install -f mysql-server-5.5 \n\nand whatever else mysql packages you need. \nI have reproduced the error most of us have been getting and this fixed it each time.\nNOTE!!!

At the client it's of no interest what the actual file system is on the NFS server. Similar to how SCP, FTP and CIFS also doesn't care - it's on a different level.\nSo, the\nsudo mount -t ext4\n\nbecomes\nsudo mount -t nfs\n\nFor Ubuntu, you'll need the nfs-common package to be able to have the nfs type of mount available.\n", "Q: VLC player wont play AVI or MP4 I'm brand new to Ubuntu (and linux all together).

How can I configure samba so that I can connect to a WORKGROUP with boxes with diffeerent op systems but not to share or hide the shares from other boxes?\n\nA: Install Samba Server Configuration with sudo apt-get install system-config-samba. From there you edit each of the samba shares you have between your computers, choose which users are allowed to acess the folders, and whether the shares are \"visible\" or \"writable\".\n", "Q: Tracking data sent to remote host over time? What is a a good way to track over time the amount of data transferred from my ubuntu machine to another host on the internet? \n\nA: That greatly depends on how you transfer it. If you have some sort of a VPN, then vnstat can track traffic per interface. These are for example monthly statistics from a VPN I'm using: \n# vnstat -m -i tun0\n\n tun0  /  monthly\n\n       month        rx      |     tx      |    total    |   avg. rate\n    ------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------\n      Sep '12     26.36 GiB |  894.47 MiB |   27.23 GiB |   88.12 kbit/s\n      Oct '12     49.80 GiB |    1.90 GiB |   51.70 GiB |  161.92 kbit/s\n      Nov '12     25.93 GiB |    1.20 GiB |   27.12 GiB |   87.78 kbit/s\n      Dec '12     27.64 GiB |    1.24 GiB |   28.88 GiB |   90.46 kbit/s\n      Jan '13     17.11 GiB |  745.23 MiB |   17.83 GiB |  125.83 kbit/s\n    ------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------\n    estimated     38.54 GiB |    1.64 GiB |   40.17 GiB |\n    ------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------\n\nOf course, this is per network interface, not per host. vnstat can be configured to keep a persistent database (flat files). \nAnother way would be to set up a forward rule in iptables and read iptables traffic statistics (iptables -nv). \nBut a proper solution would be to use dedicated software with traffic accounting.

They all say I have the most recent version of Django. Now whenever I run python in Terminal and type in import django, I receive\nImportError: No module named django\n\nHowever, when I run django-admin --version I receive\n1.4.3\n\nI know it's installed, but why is python not finding the django module? \n\nA: python is not finding django because it's not on its path. You can see the list of paths python looks for modules like this:\n$ python\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.path\n\nYou can import django if you find the location it is installed, and add that location to python's path, for example like this:\n$ PYTHONPATH=/path/to/django/parent/dir python\n>>> import django  # should work now\n\nBut your real problem is that something's wrong with your python installation. If you have installed both python AND django using apt-get, then django should certainly be on python's path without dirty hacks like above.\nThat said, when working with Django, your best bet is to NOT use apt-get but create a virtual environment using virtualenv (you can install virtualenv itself using apt-get), and install Django and other modules your Django site might need using pip within the virtual environment. That way you can have multiple Django projects side by side, with precisely the Python modules and versions it requires. It's just a few extra steps to do, but definitely worth it and will save you from much frustration in the future.\n\nA: I had the same problem when I was using PyCharm Community Edition for making Django projects.\nFor me, the following steps worked:\nIt turns out that python wants you to create a virtual environment, install django in that and then run the server. To do this,\nCreate a Virtual Environment\n\n1) Install virtual environment using pip install virtualenv.\n2) Navigate to the project folder and type virtualenv env (Here env is the name of the virtual environment.) This will create a new folder named env inside the project folder.\n3) Navigate to env/Scripts inside your Project Folder using cd env/Scripts.\n4) Type activate and press Enter. This should start the virtual environment. You can verify this as (env) would be prefixed to your current path.\n\nInstall Django\n\n1) Once inside the virtual environment, head back to your project folder using cd ../.. and type pip install django.\n2) You can verify its installation by typing django-admin --version. It should display the django version number installed inside the virtual environment.\n\nNow type python manage.py runserver to start the python server. \n\nA: I faced the same problem. I activated the virtual environment\n$ source bin/activate \n\nafter that it showed me the version of Django\nThere was no need of installing anything.\n\nmamata@mamta-inspire-all:~/dodjango$ python -m django --version\n/usr/bin/python: No module named django\n\nmamata@mamta-inspire-all:~/dodjango$ django-admin --version\nCommand 'django-admin' not found, but can be installed with:\n\nsudo apt install python-django-common\n\nmamata@mamta-inspire-all:~/dodjango$ source bin/activate\n\n(dodjango) mamata@mamta-inspire-all:~/dodjango$ ls\nbin  include  lib  lib64  mamusite  pyvenv.cfg  share\n\n(dodjango) mamata@mamta-inspire-all:~/dodjango$ django-admin --version    \n2.2.5\n\n(dodjango) mamata@mamta-inspire-all:~/dodjango$ python -m django --version\n2.2.5\n\n\nA: If you have multiple python version installed into your machine. The different packages you are trying to install gets conflicted.So, the best approach is to use virtualenv..\n\n\n*\n\n*Simple install virtual environment and python version\n\n*use virtualenv env to create virtualenvironment.\n\n*activate your virtualenv. using . /env_name/bin/activate\n\n*use pip install django==1.70 (specify version to install django)\n\n*pip list to list all installed packages.\n\n\nA: i have this problem and still had it till recently in my project\nvscode did not recognize my virtual environment , so when ever i try to run the project it gives me an error that vscode can not import django\nthe fix for this for me that i exported the libraries in my virtual environment to a fill \npip freeze > req.txt\n\nthen i created a new virtual environment with the same requirements , and it worked \nnote: try looking this up python virtual environment \n\nA: I've got this problem when I renamed the project folder in PyCharm.\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal tab stopped getting into the Virtual Environment (venv folder). To fix that, I went to the Settings -> Project -> Project Interpreter and changed the folder there.\n\n*Django \"disappeared\". django-admin --version did not respond. To fix, I did pip install django within the venv.\n\n\nIt helped.\n", "Q: Weird change in theme I've had something really weird happen to my 12.04. I was installing new desktop environments, and now I have no sound through my headphones and the \"pop up\" theme has changed. by pop up, I mean the icons that appear when I use hot keys to do things like change volume, brightness, etc. \nI first noticed this change after I left my computer on, but was away from it. I hadn't logged out of my session, but the theme changed when I woke back up from suspend. The only other thing I had done was the regular update stuff with update manager. \nSo, the question is how do I go back to how it was this morning? At the very least, I can deal with the icons being different, but I need sound out my headphone jack! here's a pic\nhttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByuTthf4CDVhVE1XdF9nTEhRalk/edit?usp=sharing\nThanks!!!\n\nA: I found the answer to the problem!

Firefox is fine though, I tried updating flashplayer but it didn't work. Thoughts?\n\nA: In chrome://plugins, I disabled libpepflashplayer. Now I can watch youtube and Dateline. :D\n\nA: I can't seem to add a comment to Uri Herrara's answer, or even up vote it. But he set me on the right track.\nUbuntu installed a new image and Chrome, and the libpepflashplayer.so Flash player is not working. I disabled it, and the\nName:   Shockwave Flash  \nVersion:    11.2 r202  \nLocation:   /opt/google/chrome/plugins/libflashplayer.so  \n\nis working fine\n\nA: Don't know why, but the pepperflash plugin used by chrome seems to be crashing recently.  Removing the plugin completely will do the trick temporarily, but will be recreated automatically at some point in time, probably after a relaunch of the browser or something.\nrm -fr ~/.config/google-chrome/PepperFlash\n\nThis is the command to remove the plugin.  Launching chrome thereafter should allow you to play flash via it defaulting back to the default adobe plugin.\nIf you don't want to go around blowing away directories, you can rename it:\nmv ~/.config/google-chrome/PepperFlash ~/.config/google-chrome/PepperFlash.bak\n\nIt works too.\nAgain, just a temporary work around, but it works in a pinch until they fix PepperFlash.\n\nA: I solved the issue by moving the following folder to a backup:\n~/.config/google-chrome/PepperFlash moved to ~/.config/google-chrome/PepperFlash.bak\nAfter that kill all processes of Chrome (also the background ones for offline gmail and so on).\nIt works now for me. Must have to do something with the new rule that you have to enable plugins per page/site before they run maybe?\n\nA: I was able to get flash playing again by just disabling libpepflashplayer in Chrome via chrome://plugins/, no terminal needed, didn't even restart Chrome. Strangely I did not have any issues with Firefox.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open up Google Chrome\n\n*Type chrome://plugins into the address bar\n\n*Look for Adobe Flash Player\n\n*Click on +Details in the upper right corner\n\n*Disable one of the Adobe Flash Player entries, and make sure one is Enabled\nIf you have installed the package flashplugin-installer you'll see two plug-ins, you can choose whichever you want.\nFor some reason it was disabled and at the beggining of the list you can also see another libpepflashplayer which is also disabled.\n\nA: Well got lucky. Did the following after closing both browsers. Go to a terminal and:\nrm -r  ~/.config/google-chrome/PepperFlash\nThen open any of the 2 browsers and go to their respective plugins section.\nFor Firefox it is in the menu in Tools --> Addons --> Plugins and check to be sure that the Shockwave Plugin is Enabled. Then test any flash video.\nFor Chrome, type in the URL: chrome://plugins and check that the plugin is checked there as Always Enabled.\nRight now am testing to make sure both are working fine.\nUPDATE - Yeap, both are working correctly again. Maybe it was an update that left a confusion there with the PepperFlash file.\n\nA: The new release, Version 24.0.1312.69 has fixed this.\n\nA: It's simple go to chrome://plugins and disable /opt/google/chrome/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so.\nEverything works like charm.\n", "Q: How do I install Molsketch?

In Ubuntu filesystem, there is a / directory which is called \"the root directory\" and in that / directory there is a directory literally named root. What is the difference between them?\n\nA: / is the topmost directory in the file system. All other directories are subdirectories of it at some depth.\n/root is the home folder for the 'root' user (see id root and What is the root user?). The purpose of this directory is to hold user configuration files for root. Usually you won't find much inside it.\nBoth are sometimes confusingly designated by the word \"root\".

I am currently dual-booting Windows and Linux (not Ubuntu), and I am looking to encrypt my Windows partition with Truecrypt.  The Truecrypt bootloader must be installed on the MBR, so it will displace GRUB.  I have read from numerous sources that installing GRUB to a partition is a bad idea, but it is the only solution for my setup.\nWhile I was playing with Ubuntu in a virtual machine, I found that it will install GRUB onto a partition's boot sector without complaint when you choose the advanced partitioning option during installation.  How does Ubuntu perform this installation?  I would like to know enough detail so that I may move the concept to any distribution that uses GRUB2.\n\nA: Instead of installing to the device like /dev/sda you install to the partition /dev/sda1.\nCommand would look like this from a live CD: sudo grub-install --force --boot-directory=/mnt/drive1/boot /dev/sda1\nI found a blog post about this issue, the author says that Truecrypt bootloader acts like a chainloader if ESC is pressed at password prompt. \nThe ideal solution today would be to use a GPT partition table and UEFI, but unfortunately Truecrypt doesn't seem to support that up until now.\n", "Q: Install wireless drivers on a Dell e1505 manually So I'm trying to install the Broadcom BCM4311 driver on 12.10 but the thing is that I don't have any way to use Ethernet to actually download it.

I notice that the installer for Ubuntu Server 12.04.1 LTS contains an option that appears to allow you to toggle between more than one keyboard layout:\nEnglish (US) - English (layout toggle on multiply/divide key)\n\nHowever, there is no information about this shown in the installer, and I can't find anything useful online.\nI regularly switch back and forth between the US and US Dvorak keyboard layouts, and think it would be very useful to be able to toggle between layouts. How does this work, and what is this \"multiply/divide\" key mentioned by the installer? When I select this option, the installation appears to proceed with the US keyboard layout.\n\nThe install completed successfully, and continues to be in standard US keyboard mode.\n\nA: After a lot of Googling,I believe I understand it. The English keyboard with \"toggle on multiply/divide key\" is a legacy option to support the XO laptop from the One Laptop Per Child project. The layout is located in /lib/udev/keymaps/olpc-xo. Apparently, there were some hardware bugs with the keycodes on the XO. As a workaround on bilingual XO devices, the multiply/divide key (a key that existed on that device but is not a standard key on other devices) was used to to switch between keyboard layouts.\nI installed the keyboard and it can be fairly useful if you type a lot of non-English characters, plus it has some useful combining diacritics. To insert the special characters, use System Settings > Keyboard Layout > Options to set the Compose key or an AltGr key.\nAgain, the multiply/divide key does not exist on standard devices, so the way to toggle between this layout and any other keyboard layout, such as US Dvorak, is through the same standard settings path above.

I suppose it has one key to multiply/divide since the keys are so squished.\n\nThat said, you can still bind a key to switch the layout. In 12.10 you go to Keyboard->Options and about midway through the options there is one called Keys to Change Layout. I remember 12.04 was very similar.\nI like Shift+Caps Lock since I never use that combination for anything else.\n", "Q: How to get Ubuntu installed, when my laptop restarts without installing? I'm trying to install Ubuntu from USB flash. So I boot from it and the install begins. It works until it ask me which type of instillation I want.\nI choose alongside with Windows 7 and then it the computer restarts and Windows 7 runs without Ubuntu being installed! I tried this installation several times and every time I get the same problem. How can I fix this problem and get Ubuntu to install?\n\nA: This resembles two common problems.\nIf it restarted soon after you told it to install alongside:\nThen you are probably using bad installation media. There are two causes:\n\n*\n\n*Corrupted ISO image.\n\n*Bad write to the USB flash drive (or, if you had been using a CD/DVD, bad burn).\n\nFirst, check the MD5SUM on the ISO image to see if it's corrupted. If it is, download it again (and test that, too).\nIf it's not corrupted, boot from the USB flash drive, press a key when you see the keyboard and person icon appear at the bottom of the screen, and select Check disc for defects. (See also this video.) This applies equally for CD/DVD and USB media. That should reveal if the write is bad.\nIf it is bad, write it again (and test it again). If it's still bad, make sure you're writing it correctly. If you are, and it's still not working, try writing it with a different technique. If you're creating the live USB in Windows, there are two common techniques, so you can try whichever one you're not currently using:\n\n*\n\n*Universal USB Installer\n\n*UNetbootin\nIf the installation went on for a while and then it restarted:\nIn this case, it's still worth checking the installation media, but it's more likely Ubuntu did install successfully, but that the GRUB2 boot loader was not properly installed to the Master Boot Record. To fix that problem, use any of the methods listed in:\n\n*\n\n*How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\n(That applies even though your problem is not due to a recent Windows installation.)\n\n*Ubuntu help wiki section on reinstalling GRUB2 to fix a broken system.\nIf neither works:\nThen more information is needed. Please boot from the USB flash drive, open a Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), and run:\nsudo parted -l\n\nThen edit your question (or, for readers other than the creator of this question, make a new question) to include the complete and exact text from the Terminal (you can copy it to the clipboard in the live USB system, access Ask Ubuntu, and paste it in, then format it with the <$> tool in the Ask Ubuntu editing toolbar).\n\nA: i know this post is quit a long time ago, but i had the same problem & is now solved; By responsing, i am just hoping someoneelse might find it useful in the future. \n1st thing about \"I choose alongside with Windows 7 and then it the computer restarts and Windows 7 runs without Ubuntu being installed\" : u need to do a partition manually, i am not too sure why (doing with EFI/BIOS issues?), but after that the install worked out fine.\ni hope that will do for your computer; but mine had a lot of problems after this duelling with the UEFI/ legacy BIOS, which took me another 4 weeks to dual-boot (somehow my BIOS doesn't allow BIOS boot); if u have the same problem, pls check the following links:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#Setup_the_BIOS_in_EFI_or_Legacy_mode\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootPartition\n", "Q: I can not boot Ubuntu unless I disconnect everything from USB 3.0 port Few days before, I have upgraded my OS from 12.04 to Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit (I had the same problem on 13.10).

Do I need to worry about disk mount order?\n\nA: \nI'd like to move /sys\n\nDon't bother\nIt's SysFS, a virtual file system. The kernel presents information to the userspace by this. It's not taking up space on your disk, it's not configurable.\n\nSysfs is a virtual file system provided by Linux. Sysfs exports information about devices and drivers from the kernel device model to user space, and is also used for configuration.\n[...]\nsysfs is an in-memory filesystem that was originally based on ramfs.\n[...]\nSysfs is used by several utilities to access information about hardware and its driver (kernel modules) such as udev or HAL. Scripts have been written to access information previously obtained via procfs, and some scripts configure device drivers and devices via their attributes.\n\n\nA: Rather than moving directories around you could simply resize the partitions. If you boot from a live CD/USB there is a program called GParted. It is fairly easy to use and I have resized many partitions without any problems.\nOne issue I have had when doing more involved rearranging of partitions is the breaking of GRUB but this can be fixed by running Boot-Repair.\n", "Q: Is there a simple fix to get my launcher size slider bar back in Settings>Appearance?

Thanks!\n\nA: CompizConfig Settings Manager (ccsm from Terminal)\n\nand change icons size:\n\n", "Q: How to define disk usage during Ubuntu Installation I am trying to install Ubuntu on D: Drive (228 GB) with Wubi. Installation size is by default 15 GB.  Will I be able to utilize the balance 213 GB of empty Disk space or do I need to partition/shrink the drive?\n\nA: The answer may be Yes, but not in the way you expect. A Wubi install will not automatically make use of the remaining space on the drive or partition. It will confine you to the original size you chose at installation time: 15GB (up to 30GB if you select it). While you certainly can save files to the rest of the drive, mounted under /host this is a manual effort akin to mounting a separate partition.\nIt also won't stop you running out of space on the Wubi virtual disk, if you're not careful. There is a way to resize the virtual disk, but you should ask yourself why you are using Wubi upfront. It's mainly to try out Ubuntu first. If you are planning to use it long-term, then partitioning and installing directly is recommended. In this way you can select as much space as you need.\n\nA: Yes. You would be able to utilize the balance Disk space on your partition. So, you do not need to partition/shrink your drive if you want to install Ubuntu via Wubi.\nFor further help with Wubi Installation/Upgrading/Uninstallation/Troubleshooting, see this WubiGuide on Ubuntu Wiki.\n\nA: In addition to any other answers, it is a good idea to understand the difference between a drive and a partition.\nWindows refers to a partition as a drive; but in fact C:, D:, etc. are partitions, which may or may not be on separate drives. In your case, it is likely that C: and D: are two partitions on the same drive.\nThis knowledge is important for when you start dealing with drives and partitions on Linux, which does not confuse the two concepts.\nOn Linux, a drive is typically called sda, sdb, sdc, etc. Partitions on a drives are numbered, e.g. (for drive sda) sda1, sda2, sda3, etc. (not always in numerical order, depending on how the partitions were created on the drive).\n", "Q: How to join text files? I have saved many documents as txt. I want to print them together so first I want them together in a single file. The order doesn't matter in this case. \nI want a solution that does not involve typing the names of the files to be merged, but one that would just merge all txt files within the folder.\nCan I do it with a command or some GUI?\n\nI looked here. Don't know how to use join.\n\nA: Do it with a simple loop:\nfor i in *.txt; do cat \"$i\" >> complete.txt; done\n\n>> appends to the file.\nNote: If for some reason you have to run the command again, you have to remove complete.txt, otherwise you'd write the file to itself, which doesn't work.\n\nA: Use cat with output redirection. Syntax: cat file [file] [[file] ...] > joined-file.\nExample with just two files (you can have many more):\n$ echo \"some text in a file\" > file1\n$ echo \"another file with some text\" > file2\n$ cat file1 file2 > mergedfiles\n$ cat mergedfiles\nsome text in a file\nanother file with some text\n\nIn case you have \"many documents\", make use of shell globbing (patterns):\ncat input-files-dir/* > joined-file\n\nThis will join all files in that directory to the current directory (preventing it to match the output file itself). It is totally independent to the use of cat and output redirection - it's just Bash providing all the files as arguments to cat.\n\nFile types\nIt will just glue (join) files together as you would do with paper and tape. It does not care about the actual file format being capable of handling this. It will work for text files, but not for PDFs, ODTs, etc. Well, it will glue them together, but it's not a valid PDF/ODT anymore.\n\nOrder of joining\nAs phoibos pointed out the shell globbing will result in alphabetical order of file names. This is how Bash and shell globbing works.\n\nAddendum about input file is output file error\nWhen the pattern of the input files matches the very same file as being output, this will cause an error. It's a safety feature. Example: cat *.txt > out.txt run the second time will cause this.\nWhat you can do about it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose a more specific pattern to match the actual input files, not matching the output name. Example: input files pattern *.txt with output file output.out will not collide.\n\n*Work in different directories. In the example above I've used a separate input-files-dir directory to place all files in, and output to the current working directory. This makes it impossible to get this error. \n\n\nA: If the files you want to combine all end in .txt, keep it simple:\ncat *.txt > combined.txt\n\nIf the directory only contains text files, it's also simple:\ncat * > combined.txt\n\n(Note that once you create combined.txt, doing it again would include it in the expansion of *, leading to odd behavior).\nIf you want to select some files in the directory and not others, it's best if the filenames allow you to distinguish which ones you want. If not, you can get fancy with find. But I doubt you need to go that far.\n\nA: Thunar custom action script written by cipricus also inspired me to write a similar Nautilus script and I thought it might be useful for others who look at this Q&A for reference on this subject. So here it is:\n#!/bin/sh\n#Nautilus Script to join selected text files in a single file and open the joined file with default text editor\n#\nIFS=$'\\n'\nFILENAME=\"JoinedFile_$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S).txt\"\ncat \"$@\" > \"$FILENAME\"\nxdg-open \"$FILENAME\"\n\n\nA: This is a complement and a variation to the other answers, related to putting these solutions to work in Thunar's custom's actions.\nNot all of them are usable in this way, but some are.\nI thought that most interesting would be to be able to merge selected files from Thunar's context menu.\nThis is a variation from what was suggested by Sadi in a comment to gertvdijk's answer :\n   cat %N > JoinedFile\n\nOnly selected files will be joined. Restrict appearance conditions to text files.\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Sadi whose comment provided me with the most clear and up-to-point solution to my problem.\nI accepted gertvdijk's answer as definitive. Not only it was the occasion to Sadi's comment, but is seems to be of further value to others, providing a well argued and complete solution (albeit somewhat above my CLI reading skills).\n\nA: You could try find command also,\nfind . -name \"*.txt\" -type f -exec cat {} + > file\n\nIt finds  .txt files inside the current directory and execute cat command on each founded file. Finally the whole output was redirected to the filename file(created within the current directly itself).\nExplanation:\n.                  # current directory\n\n-name              # helps to find only .txt files.\n\n-type f            # Only files\n\n-exec cat {} +     # helps to run cat command on the founded .txt files.\n\n>                  # Output redirection operator\n\nfile               # to store final output.\n\n\nA: A simple way to do that is by using cat:\ncat file1 file2 > joined_file\n\nIf you just issue cat file1 file2 you'll see both files on the standard output. By using >, you're just redirecting the standard output to a file. That will work also with another commands.\n\nA: You could also just use an online utility such as merge-files-online.com\n", "Q: VirtualBox kernel modules do not match the version of VirtualBox The VirtualBox 4.2.12 on Ubuntu 12.04 was running fine till I needed to install guest additon.

The root cause of the problem was exactly as stated in the error message: kernel module version mismatch. I have confirmed this with \nmodinfo vboxdrv\n\nwhich came back as version 5.0. (From ppa, I have vbox 5.1).\nI have uninstalled virtualbox-dkms, because installing it would also install the regular vbox version from ubuntu repo. But the kernel modules were still among the modules which are handled by DKMS (/lib/modules/(kernelversion)-generic/updates/dkms/), so I am GUESSING that is why the scripts would not work: \nI have tried\nsudo /sbin/vboxconfig\n\nwhich seemingly did everything as usual, stopping kernel modules, recompiling, reloading the (supposedly) new kernel modules. Except checking the module version still came up 5.0.\nThen I tried \nsudo /sbin/rcvboxdrv setup\n\nwith the same result: no version change. \nThen I decided to delete the modules because I did not like the fact that they were in the dkms folder. To do that, you need to unload the kernel modules with\nsudo rmmod vboxnetadp vboxnetflt vboxpci vboxdrv\n\nthen delete the module files from /lib/modules/(kernelversion)-generic/updates/dkms . Then run \nsudo /sbin/rcvboxdrv setup\n\nagain, and voilá the new modules are v5.1, and not under dkms anymore, my VMs are running.\nNow that I think of it, maybe the modules were correctly recompiled in /lib/modules/4.4.0-59-generic/misc/, but at loading the dkms modules might have priority. Unfortunately I have no more time to investigate this.\nps.: If you make this same transition from repo version to ppa, make sure to add yourself to the (newly created) group vboxusers, and then log out and back. \n\nA: This happened to me today on Debian 8 (Jessie) following a kernel patch.

From the manpage of head(1):\n\nwhen FILE is -, read standard input.\n\n\nYour keyboard is the standard input in this case, as your shell doesn't provide another to head here. Everytime you provide a line, it will just process it up to 10 times as it's outputting the first 10 lines by default. As your shell will also print the input you provide, you'll see all lines twice.\nWhen you are providing a stream to the standard input to head, then your keyboard input will not be grabbed. E.g.:\necho blaat | head -\n\nwill make echo output \"blaat\" to standard output and your shell will connect that to standard input of head (as expressed by the |).\nNote: Without any arguments given head will also read from standard input.\nA more useful (random) example for the use in connecting up standard input with head is this:\ngrep error /var/log/syslog | grep -iv apache | head\n\nWill print the first 10 lines matching error, but not apache from /var/log/syslog.\n", "Q: Ubuntu suspends when the lid is closed after pressing shutdown I am running 12.10.

Unfortunately this extension and its control options aren't available on Chrome Linux's latest versions due to the drop for NPAPI support, as mentioned in the extension FAQ.\nAs a result, the only option I see is to pull down the source code for Chrome and modify the source, which I've done personally to make tweaks. It's not that hard to do and would be the route I would take. For this particular feature, I would simply undo / rollback the following change and recompile:\nhttps://codereview.chromium.org/155053\nIf you click the \"View\" link under the column Side-by-side diffs and change the files to match the red version (old), that should essentially do the trick.

We are working with a terminal server that is running Xubuntu. Because we have had some issues with saved sessions, we want to turn off the saving of sessions completely.\nSo far, we have been able to set the default to not saving the session, but in the logout screen it is still possible to save the session. Is it possible to turn off session saving completely (system-wide) so our users won't \"accidentally\" use it?\n\nA: (Tested with Xubuntu 12.04, but with the ppas for Xfce 4.10 and 4.12 installed, but the option I discuss was available for Xfce 4.8)\nThere is a way to globally disable the option of saving the session, and the best way to achieve it is to use Xfce kiosk mode. One of the available kiosk mode options, buried in the source code for xfce4-session, is SaveSession. If we look at /home/mike/xfce4-session-4.10.0/xfce4-session/xfsm-shutdown.c, we can see the undocumented setting:\n/* check kiosk */\n  shutdown->kiosk_can_save_session = xfce_kiosk_query (kiosk, \"SaveSession\");\n\n\nFirstly, create the kiosk directory with\nsudo mkdir /etc/xdg/xfce4/kiosk\n\nand then create and edit the kioskrc with your text editor:\nsudo nano /etc/xdg/xfce4/kiosk/kioskrc\n\nPlace the following in your kioskrc:\n[xfce4-session]\nSaveSession=NONE\n\nNow, save the changes and logout and login again as your user to test it. The checkbox option to save the session should have disappeared.\nBefore the setting is applied, the box is still available:\n\nAfterwards, with kiosk mode active, the option is no longer available:  \n\nIf you wish to use kiosk mode to globally disable other settings, such as the ability to shutdown or suspend, etc, see my answer here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to change the hibernate and suspend settings at a system-wide level in Xfce?\n\nA: the hack from misterich didn't do the trick for me either, somehow it still can write to sessions folder\nmy solution: \n\n\n*\n\n*rm -rf \"$HOME/.cache/sessions\"\n\n*touch \"$HOME/.cache/sessions\"\nnow there is a file named sessions instead of sessions folder therefore it can't write file to it anymore.\n\nA: I ran into the very same problem, but the solution provided by @user76204 didn't do the trick for me.\nMy Details\n$ uname -ir && lsb_release -a && xfce4-about -V\n\n\n3.13.0-24-generic x86_64\n    No LSB modules are available.\n    Distributor ID: Ubuntu\n    Description:    Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n    Release:    14.04\n    Codename:   trusty\n    xfce4-about 4.11.1 (Xfce 4.10)\n\n\nMy Solution\nI fully admit that this is an ugly, ugly hack\n\n\n*\n\n*Clear out the sessions directory:\nfind \"$HOME/.cache/sessions\" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f\n\n*Remove write permissions by setting octal permissions on \"$HOME/.cache/sessions\"\nchmod 500 \"$HOME/.cache/sessions\"\nThus, sessions cannot be saved.

I've tried every possible combination of my own logins, the examples of default ones and anything else that came to mind but all were incorrect.\nI've carried out a network boot from another computer running the same version of Ubuntu, and from a memory stick with Ubuntu Live but startup goes straight to the password request before any boot options appear.\nCan anyone explain what has caused this and if there is someway to do a restore, stuck as I am halfway through startup? Or does anybody know which user name and password it may be requesting? Even a suggestion for some way to get around this password request and into Ubuntu or into boot options would help me out.\n\nA: Thanks for all the help guys.\nFinally found a way around it by going into an earlier version of Ubuntu from the startup options page. I'm embarrassed to say that I was entering the username incorrectly. After all, you have to enter your password every time you login but how often do you have to enter your username.\nThanks again, i've removed the driver that caused all the problems in the first place.\n\nA: Looks like you have switched to the terminal session on tty1. In Ubuntu, you have six terminal sessions (tty1 - tty6) and a graphical session (tty7). You can switch between them with [ALT + (1 - 7)]. So to return to the graphical session you press [ALT + 7]. To switch back to the terminal session from your graphical session, you'll need to press [CTRL + ALT + (1-7)].\n\nA: What you observe is a failure of the login screen (lightdm) to load. Therefore you are directed to a terminal. Most likely the update of your graphics driver has caused this. \nTo resolve the issue you will have to remove the driver again as it obviously seems not to work with your hardware. \nRemoval of this driver depends much on how you updated it. In general we will have to inverse the steps we took. Sometimes this is as easy as running\nsudo apt-get purge <name_of_wrong_driver>\n\nin the terminal after having logged in with the credentials of our (administrator) account.

This option was annoying since I had to play with the NVIDIA driver every time Canonical updated the kernel.\nSeveral days ago I had a conflict with the packages that Canonical distribute and my own installation of NVIDIA's drivers so I decided to uninstall both of them and start over using this answer. After rebooting the machine - my monitors were detected automatically and all I had to do is un-check the 'Mirror display' checkbox in the 'Display' system settings in order to get my working station ready.\nPlease note that I didn't try running any graphic intensive program.. so there might be issues with that.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to choose a resolution for GRUB2?

But, It just restarts to GRUB menu. \nI have an HP Pavilion dm4-2015dx\nMy end goal is to do a factory reset, and re-install Ubuntu so I can properly dual boot both OS's.\nI dont have a windows 7 disk laying around, and I dont have any backed up images of my hardrive prior to the accident. \nAny ideas to how I can get windows back on my laptop?\n\nA: If the Windows recovery worked, you should be able to just change a GRUB boot menu to get it to boot. You may also just have to select the windows recovery partition again if it is still in the middle of recovering.\nAssuming it worked, but GRUB is not working for whatever reason, you can try using qemu-kvm in Ubuntu to emulate booting off of a partition of your hard drive and test it. For example:\nsudo kvm /dev/sda2\n\nYou'll need to use the following to determine which partition it is:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIf the Windows recovery does not work, you can look into system rescue cd, a linux distro built for data/system recovery (note that this is mainly for recovering data from a damaged partition that you can't just copy over from Ubuntu; if you are able, it would be easier to do the latter). After recovering your data, you can download a windows 7 install disk from one of the links below and then install windows onto that partition and copy your data over:\n\n\n*\n\n*Home Premium (x64)\n\n*Professional (x64)\n\n*Ultimate (x64)\n\n*Home Premium (i386)\n\n*Professional (i386)\n\n*Ultimate (i386)\nYour product key should be on your computer somewhere if it came with windows.\nTL;DR\n\n\n*\n\n*See if the install actually did work, but GRUB is just getting in\nthe way or not working\n\n*If not, recover what you can and install Windows again.\n\n", "Q: How to run a script when suspending/resuming? - Sony VAIO Ubuntu 12.04 Question: How to assign a script to run when selecting the suspend option on the power menu?\nContext:\nI have a Sony VAIO laptop with an AMD Radeon graphics card. I would like to be able to disable/enable the discrete graphics card. I have no problem in doing this but it causes problems when suspending & resuming from suspend.\nWhen the session is resumed from suspend (with the discrete DPU disabled), the fan will spin up uncontrollably, what I would like to do is edit the suspend script or assign a new script to the suspend option on the power menu. This is so I can re-enable the GPU before suspending.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter some research I think it has something to do with the files in /etc/pm/sleep.d/?\nIf I put a custom script in there would it be run when suspending and resuming from suspend? \nHow do I differentiate in the script between suspending/resuming?\n\nA: On current Ubuntu versions which use systemd, you can put scripts (or links to scripts) into /lib/systemd/system-sleep/.\nTry to put this into /usr/local/bin/test-sleep.sh :\n#!/bin/sh\n\n## This file (or a link to it) must be in /lib/systemd/system-sleep/\n\nme=$(basename \"$0\")\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    pre)\n        logger -t \"$me\" \"Suspending: \\$1=$1, \\$2=$2\" ;;\n    post)\n        logger -t \"$me\" \"Resuming: \\$1=$1, \\$2=$2\" ;;\nesac\n\nThen make it executable and put a link to it for systemd:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/test-sleep.sh\nsudo ln -si /usr/local/bin/test-sleep.sh  /lib/systemd/system-sleep/\n\nThe script just writes to syslog, so you can see what it did with\ngrep 'test-sleep' /var/log/syslog\n\n\nA: You are right. You have to write a script and save it to /lib/systemd/system-sleep/ (since 2015 systemd take care of that, before was /etc/pm/sleep.d/). The difference between suspending and resuming is given as a parameter to the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    suspend)\n        # executed on suspend\n        ;;\n    resume) \n        # executed on resume\n        ;;\n    *)\n        ;;\nesac\n\nIf you also want to do it for hibernate, the arguments would be hibernate and thaw.\n", "Q: How do I switch between Pulseaudio and Jack on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x86 Linux? There are some applications on my Ubuntu 12.04 which requires Jack. Without Jack they just won't start, so I have to keep Jackd + (QjackCtl). Now the problem is jackd is not starting properly all the time. Sometime it works well, sometime it fails start(I suspect Pulseaudio is the reason). \nNow, I have found a workaround to keep both Jack and Pulseaudio runnning side-by-side \nHere is what I have done\n1.

Is there any app to do so ?\nHere's a screenshot -\n\n\nA: The best option I found at the moment is suspending pulseaudio while jack is running. It's described in the pulseaudio and jack page, and involves invoking the jack server through pasuspender.\nFrom the man pages:\n   pasuspender is a tool that can be used to tell a local PulseAudio sound\n   server to temporarily suspend access to the  audio  devices,  to  allow\n   other  applications  access  them  directly.  pasuspender  will suspend\n   access to the audio devices, fork a child process, and when  the  child\n   process terminates, resume access again.\n\n\nA: I realize this question was asked/answered quite a while ago however I have some extra information that may be of help to those who might come across this question. \nThe original poster indicates they are experiencing CPU spikes (lag) while using both pulse audio and jackd together. In my experience (I am a professional studio engineer) this is caused by not running the low latency kernel that is available for use with ardour et. al. \nMy suggestion would be to first install and reboot your PC using the  rt-kernel. The kernel should be available in the repo and synaptic, however the sources may need activation. \nPersonally, I would recommend the rt-kernel as ubuntu actively supports it and is available (and will not affect overall day-today usage of your PC. \n", "Q: BIOS loader on EFI system I have an unusual case. I'm not trying to partition drives or anything, I have separate physical drives for Windows and Linux. Being a new machine and all, I have UEFI.\nLast time I attempted to install Ubuntu 12.04, it worked fine but it destroyed my windows install. Changed the format of the drive or something and messed up the MBR. This was 6 months ago, so sorry for the lack of technical insight -- my memory is a bit off. Wasted a lot of time reinstalling Windows, and I gave up for awhile.\nNow I'm trying it again (after 12.10 was a technical disaster, repeated unity crashes and whatnot) but I currently have my Windows drives disconnected so my Ubuntu install can't mess it up.\nI figure my future bootloading will involve selecting which drive to boot from, but I'm worried that GRUB might take it upon itself to mess around with my Windows drives the moment I boot from it. Is there any way I can be certain that I won't have my Windows partitions corrupted again? Last time it took over a day to reinstall everything, this time I suspect it'll be much longer.\nOn the other hand, I really don't want to be physically unplugging and replugging drives whenever I want to switch operating systems. Selecting drives is weird, but I can at least live with that...\n\nA: The only way to guarantee that one OS won't damage another one in a dual-boot configuration is to put the OSes on physically separate drives and disconnect/reconnect them to keep them from ever co-existing. I expect the risk of damage from an electrostatic discharge or physical trauma in this configuration would far outweigh the risk of software damage, though.\nYou can achieve an intermediate level of safety by installing one OS in a virtual machine (VirtualBox, QEMU, VMWare, etc.) within another one. The guest OS is then unlikely to be able to do serious damage to the host OS unless you give it low-level disk access. You could trash the whole guest OS just by deleting one file, though.\nYour description of your original problem is far too vague to offer an opinion about what happened. As a general rule, though, Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, are fairly good about co-existing with another OS. Accidents can happen, of course, but they're usually the result of user error rather than the OS going berserk.\nNote that an EFI-based installation uses different rules for boot loader location and use than does a BIOS-based installation. There are currently a lot of problems related to EFI on Linux, owing to both firmware bugs and the immaturity of Linux distribution support for EFI. These issues are more likely to result in boot problems than in trashed data, though.\n\nA: It is not clear to me what you currently have and what you want to achieve. You have a UEFI capable machine and 2 hard drives. So far so good. But what is the maker and model name of the machine (some manufacturers have weird kludges)? What version of Windows do you have installed? Is it really booting in UEFI mode? Does you Windows hard drive have a proper GPT UEFI partition table? If you have Windows 8 you should disable fast startup and probably do not write to the file system from within Linux if you want to be sure.\nIf your Windows partition does have the legacy MBR layout and is not booting in UEFI mode then you could either install Linux in traditional MBR mode too and choose at boot which drive to boot or you could install in UEFI mode (you have to boot the install medium in UEFI mode) and choose to put a complete UEFI setup (EFI system partition, EFI loader for grub and registering the grub loader in the firmware) on the drive you choose.\nAll in all dual-booting traditional MBR setups hasn't changed just because a UEFI firmware is working in the device. Installing to separate drives is even less dangerous while staying in legacy mode.\nI'd like to add that I bought a new UEFI capable laptop back in June last year that also came with the traditional layout installed. One can also boot a traditional Windows installation in UEFI mode from Ubuntu's GRUB bootloader if done right, thus removing the need to remove drives or bring up the BIOS/firmware boot menu.\nThe UEFI article from the Community Documentation in the comment above seems to be a good starting point.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You should check your machine for known UEFI issues first before attempting to install Linux in UEFI mode.\n\n*It would be interesting to know what went wrong las time you tried to install Ubuntu.\n\n", "Q: Print jobs held, and after manually releasing them, they return to being held.

My buddy has been using hand me down computers for years and is due for a upgrade.  He currently has a pre-lga775 pentium 4 @ 2.8GHz and I have a Core2Duo E6400 @ 2.13Ghz with an ASUS P5LP-LE mobo.  I would like to just spend the $30 on RAM and be able to just swap it out in his current computer.  What, if anything, would I have to do to Ubuntu to play with the new hardware? He is currently running Xubuntu 12.04.\nASUS P5LP-LE MOBO\nCore 2 Duo E6400\n\nA: I do this all the time. Since Ubuntu is based on Linux, which means it is hardware independent (A whole different story if we talk about Windows) you won't have a problem in most cases. So since it is hardware independent you can just change your motherboard, cpu, ram, video card, lan card, wifi card and any other hardware without any problem.\nThe problems that will appear are (I will list some of them since you will get an idea with the couple I will write about):\n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware that needs Proprietary drivers - If you happen to move from a integrated video card in your motherboard (Let's say an Intel video card), to another computer with an Nvidia or Ati card, you will most likely need to install the proprietary drivers to have full features for that particular video card. Is not the same performance to compare the open sourced Nouveau with the Proprietary Nvidia drivers. Both of which are found and available to install when Ubuntu starts. This will likely not interfere with Ubuntu but will make it tough if you want to play son HD video or play a Windows game on Wine. Same goes for Wireless cards like the Broadcom Based ones.\n\n*Moving from 64 Bit to 32 bit (Backwards Architecture). If you have a 64 bit capable hardware with an Ubuntu 64 installed on it and you move to a hardware that has no 64 Bit support, you will receive some errors. The opposite is not true on newer systems and Ubuntu versions but it is recommended to stick with the same architecture for performance and stability issues.\nIn the cases you are mentioning, you won't have any problems whatsoever. To test this, simply remove your hard drive and connect it to the other PC. Then boot from your hard drive. You will notice that it will boot like it was running on that computer since the beginning.\nAside from this, if you are going to use more than 4GB RAM, I recommend going for a 64 bit version, although the 32 bit will still use the additional memory with its PAE kernel.\n\nA: From my experience it shouldn't be a problem, though I cannot really guarantee that it will work. I've only tried it once. :P Ruining your operating system with a hardware upgrade is a Windows thing as far as I heard.\nBut of course, making proper backups of your important information before attempting the upgrade is always a good idea. \n\nA: You shouldn't have to do anything, other then deactivating/removing any proprietary graphics drivers, in case the graphics card on the new board is going to change.\nThat said, you'd probably want to swich to the 64bit version of Xubuntu, especially if the amount of RAM is going to be 4GB or more, though the 32bit version should also work.\nLinux distros do not have any problems with hardware changes, as long as the new hardware is supported.\n", "Q: What is the best way to uninstall Ububtu 13.04 from a PC dual booting 12.04?

This is where the script freezes:\nSetting up mount (2.31.1-0.4ubuntu3) ...\nSetting up systemd (237-3ubuntu10) ...\nInstalling new version of config file /etc/pam.d/systemd-user ...\nInstalling new version of config file /etc/systemd/journald.conf ...\n\nConfiguration file '/etc/systemd/logind.conf'\n ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.\n ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.\n   What would you like to do about it ?

NOTHING HAPPENS NOW... WILL KILL AND RESTART WITHOUT -f OPTION...\n\nDue to Input Inhibitors neither reboot nor shutdown will work after killing the script.

This will answer \"yes\" to all prompts.  It will not run automatically, though, so you have to run it.  It should work.  AFAIK there's no way to use the GUI update manager to do unattended upgrades to software (this is NOT the same as a release upgrade!)\nIf you're trying to upgrade to a different Ubuntu version (aka a release upgrade, and usually the next release in the line of releases relative to your version of Ubuntu), you have to activate that  manually.  sudo do-release-upgrade may work.  There is no way to skip past prompts though.  This is why you initiate upgrades when you are going to be around for such prompts - there will be prompts.\n\nA: Try adding -y option to apt-get but know that it will answer y all queries.\n", "Q: How do I access files on my Windows partition from Ubuntu? I'm new to how Ubuntu works and installed it yesterday alongside Windows 7, but in doing so I have created a few problems. I have partitions for Windows, Ubuntu, System Recovery, and storage for all my files with the intention to access them on either OS, but I don't even see all of my drives listed on Home Folder. Not to mention that  during the Ubuntu instillation I managed to screw up any chance of booting to the Windows side of things at all. I'll fix Windows once I get my hands on a copy in a couple days, but in the mean time any suggestions for accessing my files?\nIf you need me to find any data about my computer to help you figure out what's wrong with it, please don't hesitate to tell me what I need to show you. Thanks\n\nA: Ubuntu supports Windows File Systems by default and you should be able to access them out of the box. What do you see when you open the file manager? There should be a list of your Windows partitions of the left side of the file manager.\nIf you don't see anything, please click the Ubuntu button on the top-left of the screen. In the Dash, search for \"disk\" and click on the disk utility application. In here you are able to see your hard disk and partitions. Are they showing up in here?\n\nA: You should run this command in a terminal after you boot into Ubuntu and login. This should solve a few of the problems with not being able to boot Win7:\n  sudo update-grub\n\nUntil you fix you WIn7 boot, you can access your other partitions (apart from linux partitions) by running a few commands in a terminal. Make sure you have installed the following packages:\n sudo apt-get install fuse mount mountall mtools udisks usbmount pmount\n\nThey should all be already present on your system but it doesn't hurt to check again. Also make sure you have installed 'gvfs' metapackage:\n sudo apt-get install gvfs*\n\nReboot your computer, and if you are still unable to access your NTFS partitions, you can try to manually mount them as follows.\nFirst you have to create a new directory in your /media folder. '/' is the standard symbol for 'file system' directory. Inside the file system directory, there is a folder named 'media'. This is where you will mount your NTFS partitions, after you create a new directory inside this /media folder. You can name this new directory 'hdd'.  To do that, run this command in a terminal:\n sudo mkdir /media/hdd\n\nInsert your password when prompted for it and you're done.\nNext, you can mount one or more partitions in /media/hdd by typing in a terminal some codes similar to this one:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/hdd   \n\nor this one:\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /media/hdd\n\nTo find out which one is which, use the disk utility application as suggested by user Gladen in the previous post.\nTo unmount your partitions, you can use this command in a terminal:\n sudo umount /media/hdd\n\nHope this helps.

How do I turn off the firewall in Ubuntu 12.04?\nThanks for the answers. The reason for turning it off was twofold: I often cannot make a wireless connectin to internet and get the server is unable to connect message or I get a message that disappears telling me my domain is not compatible with the Avahi network whatever that is.  So I thought if I disable firewall I would be ok.\nSo my question is as follows: What command line or configuration in Ubuntu 12.04 can I use to disable or stop the Ubuntu 12.04 default firewall? \n\nA: By default, the firewall on Ubuntu (which can't be removed, because its part of the kernel) is unconfigured, and has default allow on everything.  Unless you've added ufw or iptables rules, the firewall (which cannot be disabled because its part of the kernel) will not filter/block anything (Default ALLOW rule).\n\nA: Actually Ubuntu got a firewall it self named uncomplicated firewall.  For any reason you have problem with the firewall means you can simply disable it by running:\nsudo ufw disable\n\nfrom your terminal.\nTo again enable firewall write/paste the following command-\nsudo ufw enable\n\n\nA: sudo iptables -F will flush the firewall rules. You won't be able to turn off the firewall as it is built into the kernel.\n\nA: I had a problem that I can not access a server on my hosting machine (Ubuntu 14.04 64 Bit) from a guest windows machine by VMWare Player. I had been around for like a two days searching for a network solution while the problem was all about firewall. \nI decided that it is all about firewall and I tried to see how to stop the firewall, I tried this solution :\n    sudo ufw disable\ndidn't work with me, however I used another way \nsudo service iptables stop\nThen i tried to access the servers, and IT WORKS finally.

What does ./ mean?\nFor example: Does the following command mean moving files from Gapache2 folder to sites-available:\nroot@ip-10-112-55-203:/etc/mds-1.2-beta4/sana/config/etc/Gapache2# mv ./ /etc/apache2/sites-available\n\nIf not how should this be modified?\nI tried getting something from Google Search. But ./ gets ignored by search engines.\n\nA: About .\nIn UNIX/Linux, . means the current directory. You'll also see it listed in ls commands:\nls -al\ntotal 40348\ndrwx------  20 root root     4096 Feb  2 23:05 .               <-- there!\ndrwxr-xr-x  24 root root     4096 Jan 31 20:07 ..\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root      322 Dec 16 17:35 20-revert\n\nSlashes, ./ and the symbolic links\nWhen appending the / to it, this has the same meaning as appending a / to any other directory name. It will just make sure you're not operating on a file. Generally, this will not be a difference in cp and mv commands, but you will see a difference when you're using symbolic links. Suppose this structure:\n.                                                                   \n├── a                                                               \n├── dir1\n│   ├── b\n│   └── c\n├── dir2\n│   └── d\n└── symlink -> dir2\n\nThen a regular listing will show the link itself\nls -l symlink\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 gert gert 4 Feb  3 12:15 symlink -> dir2\n\nbut appending the / will make it list descend into it and showing the contents.\nls -l symlink/\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 gert gert 0 Feb  3 12:15 d\n\nThis means that when using operations, it's a good thing to append the / if you refer to the contents of it or you want to copy/move into it by dereferencing the link, rather than replacing the link itself.\nSee also: Trailing slashes on symbolic links to directories \nBack to the example\nIn the example in your question you really want to only move the contents of the directory into the other. So, as aneeshep pointed out, you should use mv ./* destdir/. This is the same as mv * destdir/ as your shell (Bash) expands the * from the current directory by default.\nSo, I would run it like this (in the source directory):\nmv * /etc/apache2/sites-available/\n\n\nA: In Unix/linux . means the current directory in your case /etc/mds-1.2-beta4/sana/config/etc/Gapache2. There are also many shortcuts like:\n\n\n*\n\n*..: parent directory (/etc/mds-1.2-beta4/sana/config/etc/)\n\n*~: home folder\n\n\nSo to move all folders and files from /etc/mds-1.2-beta4/sana/config/etc/Gapache2 to /etc/apache2/sites-available, the command will be like this \nmv ./* /etc/apache2/sites-available/\n\nUPDATE: This link is a good resource for basic UNIX commands\n", "Q: I can't install the software I want to!

I want to install Adobe Reader X (10 or 11) in my system. But there is no native application available for Linux. After doing Google I have seen that Adobe Reader 10.1.14 is given gold rating with Wine 1.5.19. But when I have tried, the installation is going fine without any error, but I could not find the Adobe Reader in menu. So I have tried it through PlayOnLinux and getting error that \"wine crashed\".

I have tried to install Adobe Reader 10.1.14 and 11.0.01 with Wine 1.4 and 1.5.19 through PlayOnLinux.\n\nA: I'm not sure if you can accept this as a valid answer, but since what you want is a feature-rich PDF viewer program with \"lots of commenting and writing tools of Adobe Reader x\" I think you would be very happy with PDF-XChange Viewer.\nIt actually offers more features than Acrobat Reader using a much smaller disk space and memory! \nYou can either install it under Wine or - if you encounter any installation problems -simply download the Portable version and then create your own Launcher manually.\nI've been using it with various versions of Ubuntu and Wine for a long-time, including the current Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit and the latest Wine version.\nUPDATE\nThe new PDF-XChange Editor (which supersedes the PDF-XChange Viewer) works better under Wine with more or less the same features in the Free version.\n\nA: I've been struggling with this question for years.

It could not find setspace.sty and tlmgr didn't work. I googled it a little but i couldn't figure it out how to solve it (i'm a rookie)\nSo i removed texlive from synaptic and installed it again from iso file that i had downloaded (it's TexLive 2012).\nBut somehow it does not work at all now (pdflatex and etc).\nI checked synaptic and there is no package installed related to texlive and when when i try to remove it from terminal it shows:\nE: Unable to locate package texlive\n\nAfter tring sudo apt-get update it still shows the same error.\nAny suggestion will be appreciated. \n\nA: Sorry to say this, but I think you don't know what you're doing. Let me explain it a bit.\n\n\n*\n\n*It's texlive, not textlive.\n\n*If you install \"from upstream\" (the ISO file, rather than Ubuntu packages), it's not being managed by your package management. It will not show up in any of those tools as it doesn't know about it. Please don't mix up installation from both methods - it will get you into more trouble and it will confuse your package management.\n\n*tlmgr is supposed not to work in Ubuntu, as you should install TeX Live packages using your system package management, rather than another package management tool only for one application. This is a change that Ubuntu/Debian package managers make to software and such a change applies to many more packages. For example, the Firefox updater is disabled in the application itself - you will get it via the system package updates instead. See below one approach I use to find the right Ubuntu package.\n\n\n\nSteps to get your system back in a reasonable working state:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall the TeXLive version you installed using that ISO file. I don't know how to properly uninstall that - it should come with instructions to do so.\n\n*Remove all the packages with possible leftovers as well:\nsudo apt-get remove texlive texlive-\\*\n\n\n*Reinstall:\nsudo add-apt-repository universe\nsudo apt-get install texlive-generic-recommended\n\n\n*Install additional packages you need. Search the package management using the texlive- keyword for generic packages you may want. For specific missing .sty files, use the packages.ubuntu.com search, like I did here: setspace.sty search. It will show that this file is present in the texlive-latex-recommended package (which you previously didn't install I guess).\n\nA: Seven years later, texlive-xetex was easier to find and install:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install texlive-xetex\n\nTested and installed on ubuntu 20.04\n", "Q: How to redistribute Ubuntu(Linux)? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to customize live Ubuntu CD? \n\nI have Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Ubuntu/Kubuntu and Server) and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Other linux distributions.

And I want to redistribute the modified version.\nI also want to replace the kernel with a new kernel, in the ISO. \nIn short, I want to customize Ubuntu (or any linux distribution) and distribute the custom version.\n\nA: You can use ubuntu-builder. More information can be found on its Launchpad page:\nubuntu-builder \n\nA: There is a page in the Community Documentation on this topic. Newer kernels like the quantal kernel are available in 12.04 as packages, so this should also work. Please note that you very likely do not have the rights to release your custom spin under the Ubuntu brand on the internet and you shouldn't do so in the first place.\nWhat do you mean by redistribution anyway?

Just as an example, like this:\n$ appfoo --do-something-cool\n\nMore specifically, I want to start Chrome with --disable-accelerated-compositing due to this bug.\n\nA: The easiest way of doing this would probably be by using the app called \"Alacarte\".\nAlacarte is a menu editing applications which is available for free download in the Ubuntu software center.\nWhen the app is installed you can launch it by searching \"alacarte\" in the dash.\nInside the app you navigate to the app category and then edit the specific app you want by clicking \"Properties\".\nThere is a field called \"Command\" which you from here can edit like your example.\n", "Q: Broadcom Wireless BCM4313 on 12.04 LTS \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to Install Broadcom / STA Wireless card (BCM43XX)\nCan’t connect to any wireless connection after updating \n\nUsing wireless successfully on 2 DELL VOSTRO 3500 laptops.\nBoth have failed - second one after update today.

They'll save you a lot of time!\n\nA: It's probably worth noting that this is what yes was written for. It by default prints a y repeatedly, but yes <string> will just repeat \"string\" instead.\nIf you're presented with a bunch of responses like:\n\nPress [ENTER] to continue or ctrl-c to cancel adding it\n\nYou can do something like:\nyes '' | sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable\n\nTo automatically put an enter at every prompt. Given that apt-add-repository has a -y option, you should use that, but if you ever encounter a script that doesn't have that option, you can use yes.\n", "Q: Properly modify home dir I would like to know, whow to modify properly the homedir of a user.\nI already know about this command\nusermod -d /home/peter peter\n\nBut now, do I have to create the homedir before?\nAnd what will happen to the old homedir?

You either need to be logged on as root, not recommended, or prefix the command with sudo.  The command does not create the folder so you will need to create it first.\ncd /home;\nsudo mkdir peter\nsudo chown peter:peter peter\nsudo usermod -d /home/peter peter\n\nWill do what you want.  Any existing home folder will remain unchanged\nYou cannot change a user's home directory while that user is logged in (if you are logged in as peter, it will not work).\n", "Q: What do the symbols like =, * and | in the output of \"ls -F\" mean?

I would like to install Ubuntu on a machine that is intended to work as server, and for some reason I do not have an option to connect a screen to it.\nI expect this may be similar to remote installation. However, there is currently no OS on that machine, so I will have to set up everything from scratch.\nOn the other hand, I do have a physical access to that machine. Therefore I can get it to boot from a CD/USB. But that's not enough.\nIs there a way to do such installation remotely? Is there a version of Ubuntu image that comes with a SSH server preinstalled, and starts it once booted, so that I can boot the machine with such image, connect to it via SSH and process the installation from a different computer?\nIf not, what other options do I have?\n\nA: I write a simple solution based on preseed.\nhttps://github.com/mhf-ir/ubuntu-overssh-reinstallation\nYou need installed version of ubuntu that have ssh. another http server for serving preseed file. I tested so many times in many datacenters.\n\nA: The method mentioned in the comment above with installing Ubuntu on a different computer to just move the hard drive to the headless machine certainly is an elegant and probably the fastest method to get Ubuntu installed. In most cases hardware will be recognized and drivers will be provided on boot (not on installation). This makes installation of drivers unnecessary unless we do need proprietary drivers (e.g. for some very special network cards).\nBut there is another way we can install Ubuntu unattended by creating a custom CD-ROM, USB or from a network solution (Preseed). See this rather complete guide on the steps and tuning procedures involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Documentation: Preseed (amd64)\nYou may also find the following related questions helpful:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I create a completely unattended install of Ubuntu?\n\n*How can I install Ubuntu on a headless machine?\n\nA: Another option, using Serial console:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add serial 0 9600 0×003 to isolinux.cfg for CD or syslinx.cfg for USB\n\n*Add console=ttyS0,9600n8 to kernel append parameters in text.cfg that contains menus.\n\n*Connect it to another PC, with serial port (or with USB/Serial adapter), use Putty or Minicom with same settings 9600n8, then boot\n\n*Follow installation through serial console.\n\n*If want to make it permanently boot to serial console, follow instructions here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SerialConsoleHowto\nReference: Ubuntu Server 10.10 headless installation via serial console\n\nA: You could use a No Question Asked preseeded debian-installer which installs just the base server and ssh package. On reboot you will be able to ssh into the running system and further install and configure from there.\nThere is an example of a preseed file here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Cobbler/Preseed\nYou can follow the normal iso to usb instructions https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick and then edit the syslinux/txt.cfg file on the usb boot stick to point to your preseed file and copy your preseed file to the preseed directory on the usb boot stick:\nlabel custom\n  menu label ^Install Custom Ubuntu Server\n  kernel /install/vmlinuz\n  append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu-custom.seed initrd=/install/initrd.gz quiet ks=cdrom:/isolinux/ks-custom.cfg --\n\nNotice the second to last line in the preseed file installs openssh server package:\nd-i     pkgsel/include string byobu vim openssh-server\n\nCheck the logs on your DHCP server to get the IP address of the newly booted system and ssh to it as the ubuntu user. The password in the example preseed is also 'ubuntu' (without quotes).\n\nA: Just to update, Ubuntu supports auto-installation (since 20.04). They have a Quick Start guide, to make it nice and easy for you. Essentially you provide all of the info you need when making the USB, then plug it in and boot (very oversimplified)\n", "Q: Why can't I upgrade to Ubuntu 13.04 using Update Manager?

I have a bunch of files which need to be converted from .mp4 to .mpeg.one. A friend of mine had suggested me this simple script. However it doesn't work because filenames contain blank spaces.\nHere is the script:\nfor f in $(ls *.mp4); do ffmpeg -i \"$f\".mp4 \"$f\".mprg; done\n\n\nA: Instead of ls, you can use find -print0 and xargs -0:\nfind -name '*.mp4' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 ffmpeg -i '{}' '{}'.mpeg\n\nFollowed by a rename afterwards:\nrename s/mp4.mpeg$/mpeg/ *.mp4.mpeg\n\n\nA: *\n\n*No ls needed\n\n*You probably mean .mpeg as extension\n\n*If you place the \" right, spaces won't be aproblem\n\n*ffmpeg -i \"$f\".mp4 in your command will look for e.g. files.mp4.mp4, which you probably didn't mean\n\n*Be aware that your output files will be named e.g. files.mp4.mpeg\n\n\nPossible solution:\nfor f in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" \"$f\".mpeg; done\n\n\nA: You don't need to use ls in this case. As a general rule, always try to use shell builtins and glob features instead of relying on external programs (e.g. ls) that can introduce problems with ugly workarounds.\nAlso, you shouldn't 'manually' append the extension to the input file name (the one you give to -i) and you should strip the extension on the output file.\nSo the command should be:\nfor f in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" \"${f%.mp4}\".mprg; done\n\n", "Q: Testing Ubuntu mobile applications I'm currently reading a lot about the new Ubuntu mobile (phone) OS, and now I'm wondering if there is the possibility to test applications.

What you have to do is basically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an environment: virtualenv env\n\n*'Activate' it: source env/bin/activate\n\n*Install your packages: this could be done either using pip or the setup.py script of your packages.\n\n*Enjoy.\n\n\nI'm not giving much information because virtualenv is well-documented and if you need help with something, you'd better open a new question.\n\nA: Try appending to PYTHONPATH instead of overwriting it completely.\nexport PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/dev/python-files\n\nReferences:\nAccording to the the Python documentation on PYTHONPATH\n\nAugment the default search path for module files.

For that purpose, I put together a small Scala shell script that 1) traverses /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin directories, 2) locates non-symlink executables, and 3) sums the file size of the libraries listed by ldd. Is this a feasible approach to compute the extra space that would be needed?\nFurther, besides extra disk space consumption, what would be the runtime memory usage implications? That is, binaries compiled against the same shared library will let the kernel to instantiate the shared library just once at runtime. In case of static binaries, each binary will need to reserve extra memory for the very same library. With enough swap space, would still that be a problem? (After all, isn't that how most of the user-space Windows applications run?) Are there any other potential implications that I might be missing?\n\nA: The key difference between static and shared libraries is that when static libraries are used every program has a copy of the parts of the library it uses.  With a shared library the code is stored separately. \nWindows like Linux uses a mixture of statically linked and shared libraries.  In windows dll files are shared libraries in Linux the libraries usually have the extension .so\nPrograms written with static libraries are larger taking up more disk space.  Also If two or more running programs are using the same library functions then this code will be in RAM multiple times.  Depending on the complexity of the functions called this may mean more RAM is used and so may need to swap space more often.  There is an overhead in \ncalling a shared library so if the function is simple enough it may be more efficient in terms of RAM to have a static library.\nIf an error is discovered in a shared library then only the shared library needs to be updated.  If the same error is discovered in a static library then all programs that use it need to be re-compiled and updated.  On the other hand if a program is linked using static libraries there are no concerns about is the library available, and is it the correct version.\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. \nThere is more information here\nhttp://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LibraryArchives-StaticAndDynamic.html\n", "Q: \"No such file or directory\" error while using npm I installed node and npm using the instructions provided here\nI was able to use node successfully.

I'm willing to give them IT support for free, but they live 50 miles away. The Solution? A NX Server. I setup the Node, Client and Server on her computer, with the client only on my computer. It's working out fine, but the only fear I have is other people accessing the server. I want only a few computers to be able to access the NX server, and nobody else. How do I go about doing this? By the way, both computers (relative's computer and my computer) are running 12.04, with a few computers that may access running CentOS 5.\n\nA: I would do this...It will block all traffic to a port except from your ip.\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -s 192.168.1.1 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -j DROP\nWhere 8000 is the nx port and \n192.168.1.1 is your ip address.\n\nA: You could also use SSH just for tunneling (ssh -D 1080 user@ip\") and allow only connections from 127.0.0.1 / localhost. Then tell your client to connect using a SOCKS 5 proxy at 127.0.0.1:1080. This will not only use the security ssh offers and not lock you out if you get a new source ip but also will take your worries about exposing your server.\n\nA: I would suggest using X2Go, which is based on NX, but incompatible with Nomachine NX. Everything is over ssh, and it supports PulseAudio etc. It's been very much more user friendly than FreeNX. \n\nA: NX is already secure since it uses encryption and authentication\nso there is no need to tunnel or use something else.\nfrom their feature matrix here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Secure communication protected by SSL cryptography Full encryption\n\n*for UDP traffic Kerberos password authentication PAM based\n\n*authentication Support for industry standard SSH protocol Kerberos\n\n*ticket authentication and ticket forwarding to the session\n\n", "Q: What happened to the Leadership Code of Conduct? I'm trying to read and perhaps sign the Leadership Code of Conduct, but all I can find is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Code of Conduct v2.0\nBack when the Code was in version 1.1, I could access the \"regular\" CoC 1.1 and the Leadership CoC that went along with it.\nThe Code of Conduct is now on version 2. Where is the corresponding Leadership Code of Conduct?\n\nA: As of the Ubuntu Code of Conduct v2.0, there is no longer a separate Leadership Code of Conduct. Instead, CoC 2.0 covers both.\n\nOver the past two cycles the Community Council has put in a great deal\n  of effort to merge the original Code of Conduct with the very\n  important Leadership Code of Conduct so that the document more clearly\n  communicates the guiding principals the community has. That work has\n  involved two in-person sessions; one at UDS-Q and one at UDS-R. It has\n  also involved two drafts being shared with the community in an effort\n  to seek feedback. Every effort was made to clear up ambigous language\n  or phrases that posed difficulty to translations.\n\n— Charles Profitt, \"CoC Version 2.0 has been released\" (official mailing list for Ubuntu News Team)\nSo now, the one CoC includes the expectations for leadership. And agreeing to CoC 2.0 corresponds to what was formerly achieved by agreeing both to CoC 1.1 and the Leadership CoC.\nIt makes sense that they are both collapsed into one as, after all, there are numerous opportunities for both participation and leadership in the Ubuntu community, most of which require no formal recognition (though some leadership positions are official, as always). CoC 2.0 makes this clear too:\n\nWe all lead by example, in debate and in action. We encourage new\n  participants to feel empowered to lead, to take action, and to\n  experiment when they feel innovation could improve the project.\n  Leadership can be exercised by anyone simply by taking action, there\n  is no need to wait for recognition when the opportunity to lead\n  presents itself.\n\n— Ubuntu Code of Conduct v2.0\n", "Q: How to completely remove Thunderbird?

(without the grep mentioned above?)\nMake sure your BIOS is set to use the card you want to use as the VGA primary card. It probably has an option like \"Primary video: PCIE16-slot1, PCIE-slot2, .. \".  Make sure this is set to the slot of the NVidia card.\nBlacklisting the modules might work but I imagine that the Xorg server will still try and run a vesa driver on the other card.  Another option may be to use the pci-stub driver to essentially 'hide' the device from Linux. See here:\nhttp://www.linux-kvm.org/page/How_to_assign_devices_with_VT-d_in_KVM\n.. You might need to add these commands to scrips that run early in startup.\nFailing those, you'd need a custom /etc/X11/xorg.conf to force the xserver to run on only one GPU.  Otherwise, the Xorg server will scan the PCI bus and helpfully load any drivers it finds and (presumably) try to use them.  Do man xorg.conf and then run Xorg -configure to generate an xorg.conf.new in the current directory. Then edit from the generated data, paying special attention to the BusID field under section Device.  Then look at the \"screen\" section of the config, and remove any screens with a reference to the device (probably Card0 or Card1) that you don't want to use.\nHowever, you may want to reconsider your use case. From your comment:\n\nI'd like to use the HD 4770 and the radeon drivers for X and the HD 7770 for a Windows Virtual Machine or just the HD 4770 and ignore the HD 7770.\n\nThat's a very, very tall order despite how simple it seems.  The problem is that either you need a system that has an IOMMU that can support re-routing the PCI(-E) bus using hardware virtualization (this needs CPU, bios and chipset support).  Very few motherboards have the full support necessary (most have borked BIOS tables).  Here's an account of someone trying to get their asus motherboard to work with virtualbox and running into BIOS issues:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/56777/enabling-iommu-in-the-kernel-for-graphics-card-pass-through\nEven systems that have an IOMMU working enough to support things like network card passthrough fail when working with video cards since the video cards are still treated as 'special' by the pci bus for legacy reasons (particularly the primary card as marked by the bios). \nOtherwise, you're stuck using experimental hacks to various hypervisors trying to make things like this work using paravirt PCI-passthrough support.  Xen claims to support using radeon cards in guests that are non-primary (and hidden using their PCIback driver).  They also claim to be able to passthrogh an intel card to a guest even if its the primary card on the host.  I personally never got it to work.  NVidia cards are always harder to deal with in this case due to lack of documentation.  It's quite possible that VMWare, KVM, or virtualbox may have better support for this, i don't know.  \nYou can find information on Xen's graphics passthrough here:\nhttp://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_VGA_Passthrough\nReally, if you don't have functioning IOMMU support, give up trying to run a VM with video card passthrough, save yourself the pain.\n", "Q: Something has stolen my Ctrl+Shift+F12 shortcut key after a recent update.

I also know that there is work on adding OpenCL to the opensource Radeon driver & new gallium mesa stack, but that it is not done yet (and not compatible with the binary drivers anyway). I also know best practice when switching from one video card to another using binary drivers is to completely scrub the drivers.\nBut what I am not clear on as yet is the linkage between the Stream SDK and the X/OpenGL stack, such that I can use part of the Radeon driver for OpenCL support, but leave graphics to the NVIDIA stack. \nIdeas that came to mind could include getting the the ATI driver to install to a different location, or installing the NVIDIA stack over the AMD stack (hopefully leaving the OpenCL specific parts alone). \nNote that I have no intention of video/graphics on the Radeon card. It will only be used as a GPGPU.\nI am looking for specific examples of documentation of anyone who has accomplished this. Google suggests is is possible with Windows 7, but my question is for Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit. \nnouveau is not a solution for me at this time, as I am doing Linux based gaming on this rig and don't want to give that up. \nIf there is a better place to post this question, please let me know.\nThanks to anyone with ideas or suggestions on how to proceed.\n\nA: Actually I managed to do just that, it was a year ago and I was mining some bitcoin with the Radeon card while having the NVidia card as the render card and for movie watching. I am not sure how I have done that but as I recall installing AMD drivers first and NVIDIA second will do just that. There was some instability due to the sequence in which the drivers were loaded. The AMD binary blobs worked only one way, either initialized before NVidia or after Nvidia - cannot recall for sure. Anyway, the point is, it is possible. Also, I might have installed NVidia drivers from repository (openSUSE) and AMD from installer.\n", "Q: Recompile Nginx with nginx-push-stream-module? I've installed Nginx on Ubuntu with apt-get.

Too lazy to copy-paste everything\n\nA: There is no way to do that.\nYou need to recompile Nginx plus the module from source, like described in the Nginx Push Stream documentation.\nIt is not possible to do what you want because Nginx does not support DSO (Dynamic Shared Object) like Apache does. Nginx can't LoadModule since it's design is not for Dynamic Linked binary, it has to link modules during compile time and that is what we call a Statically Compiled (monolithic) binary. With Apache you can load external modules from .so files, but in Nginx you need to compiled the \"sbin/nginx\" binary with all modules in it, that's why you can't apt-get the module, you need to do some compiling work yourself.

Don't ask why, I was just wondering if I can completely uninstall Ubuntu and then go back to Windows 7 with my original C: drive at full capacity (getting rid of the Ubuntu partition). If so, how?\n\nA: This is essentially a case of installing Windows 7, which involves booting from the Windows 7 installation disc and installing over your complete hard drive.  Whether or not you have Ubuntu (or any OS) already on that drive doesn't really change the procedure, except that perhaps the installation may prompt you as to whether you want to overwrite existing partitions and/or use the whole drive (you want to use the whole drive).\nThis isn't really an Ubuntu related question, so I'll leave the specifics of how to do this to other sites on the internet.\n\nA: You need to specify how you have installed it - by using WUBI or using a separate partition. If there is a separate partition and you can boot into windows 7, then the easy way is installing \"easybcd community edition\", then overwriting the boot-loader with win 7 boot-loader and then deleting the partitions from the windows disk manager.\nEasyBCD download page - http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/EasyBCD.shtml\n", "Q: Can I Install torcs 1.3.3 from Ubuntu 12.10 repo on Ubuntu 12.04 by directly downloading the .deb packages?

This is back to basics, and it seems to work fine with the Nouveau driver, until then. I will post again if I I see the Unity freeze again.\nEdit: No, it does the same.

It's important not to change the order of doing the above when changing the configuration for an interface. One of the issues that can occur is that a dhclient process is started when bringing the interface with dhcp up, but when you change the configuration to static or something else, that process will not be taken down anymore, ever! The result is that your interface configuration is being managed by a split brain. So, please: ifdown, edit, ifup.\n", "Q: Why can't I install these packages?

Is it possible to install IIS on Linux?\n\nA: After introducing .Net Core, now Microsoft officially provide support to run .Net Core applications on Linux and you no longer need IIS server to serve .Net applications. You can use Kestrel web server to server .Net Core web applications. A complete guide to serve .Net Core web application with Nginx as reverse proxy is given here. If you want to use Apache instead of Nginx have a look here.\n\nA: IIS is Microsoft-proprietary web server software that can only run in the Windows operating systems for full support of it and all of its features.  It is not capable of being run in a non-Windows environment without sacrificing some functionality, and you will need Windows Server or Windows 7 with IIS installed on it in order to use IIS and all of its features.\n\nA: It is not recommended to run IIS in a non-native environment (net exactly sure why you would want to) but it is possible to run .NET applications on Linux. \nYou should check out Mono: http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page\nSo the answer is; Yes it is possible but 100% not recommended.\nIf you would like to run a web server using Linux you should use a native package like apache.\n\nA: As others said, IIS isn't supported on GNU/Linux however, as of (at least) late 2019, you can use the Kestrel web server which runs perfectly fine on Arch, so it shouldn't be a problem to run a .NET Core 3 web server on Ubuntu or any modern distros.\nThat being said, you should make sure you have the correct .NET Core SDK and runtime (which matches the version specified in your project's WebApi.csproj file).\n", "Q: Acer Aspire One 725 unstable WiFi connection I installed 12.10 on an Acer Aspire One 725. There were intermittent problems with the WiFi disconnecting and connecting again and again.\nI thought this might be an issue with 12.10. So I installed 12.04. I'm getting the same problems with 12.04 too. Which probably points a finger at the hardware or drivers for the Aspire One 725. I have six other devices that are working perfectly with the same WiFi router.\n\nA: I had similar problems, I found that it was the broadcom chipset, it even fighting with the the other 'atheros' chipsets in my family to the point where there internet became unusable.\nI just replace the chipset in my Acer 725 with an atheros one and all is well now.\n", "Q: How to increase video smoothness?

This fixed the issue for me across all distros. \nBut given that you are left only with \"legacy\" catalyst driver, it seems to be a good solution to use the ever improving AMD OSS drivers. Make sure you use the latest 3.7 / 3.8 kernel to get all the benefits that has been going into the OSS driver stack.\n\nA: Appearently was my AMD HD4570 proprietary driver to blame,if anyone else is having this issue try using open source driver from ubuntu.\n", "Q: How do I black list applications from the application indicator? I am trying to black list a program from appearing in the application indicator and wondering how I can achieve this.

Nautilus and Thunar have a such context menu option under Properties/Permissions, but not PCManFM, Lubuntu's default file and desktop manager (at least not yet in the present v. 1.1.).\nBut under \"Open with\"/(again)\"Open with\"/\"Custom command line\", it is possible to add new custom commands. \n\n\nThis creates a file with extension .desktop in ~/.local/share/applications which can be edited further so as to get a proper name and icon.\nWhat is the command to add in this way for making a file executable?\nThat is: how to use sudo chmod +x filename to make it work in this way? \n\nA: Considering the example from the answer - of using the \"Open with\" option:\nThe command sudo chmod +x must run in a terminal (gnome-terminal -e \"sudo chmod +x %f\") or alternatively the line Terminal=true should be in a desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications/make_exec.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Make file executable\nExec=sudo chmod +x %f \nIcon=path/to/icon\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nNoDisplay=true\nMimeType=text/plain;\n\nFor an application to appear in the context menu, it may need a desktop file in /usr/share/applications, but also you may need to edit as administrator /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache and in the line of the intended file type to add the application.desktop.\nSo, in the present case, open /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache and add make_exec.desktop to the line text/plain.\n\nConsidering the creation of custom actions - like in Thunar, Nautilus or Dolphin:\nPCManFM supports custom actions. \nThose created with Nautilus configuration tool (for Nautilus) appear in PCManFM too. These are .desktop files created in ~/.local/share/file-manager/actions. So, they can be added manually without the Nautilus tool. \nThe form of these files should be like those presented here or here.\nSo, for the present purpose, create the file ~/.local/share/file-manager/actions/make_executable.desktop with these lines:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName = Make executable\nTooltip = Make this file executable\nIcon = terminal\nProfiles = make_exec;\n\n[X-Action-Profile make_exec]\nName = Make executable\nMimeTypes = text/plain;\nSelectionCount = 1\nSchemes = file;\nExec = sudo chmod +x %f\n\n", "Q: Shutdown over SSH I just installed a fresh ubuntu server 12.04.

I have to set it to connect as an input device and it will work fine for a little while. Sometimes it disconnects in the middle of using it; sometimes the mouse goes to sleep to save battery power and it will not reconnect after waking up.

On the other one, even when using the same keyboard, the cursor moves unbearably slowly. Setting the key repeat speed to max does not help. Setting the mouse speed to max doesn't help. Setting the touchpad speed to max does not help.\nWhere's the setting for the cursor speed with mouse keys?\n\nA: Try adjusting xkbset settings as i.e.:\nxkbset ma 60 10 10 5 2\n\nYou can find xkbset on the universe repository.\nSource: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1977588\n\nA: Okay, first install xkbset by using the following command;\nsudo apt install xkbset\n\nafter installation done, set the value of mouse key speed, something like below; there are 5 parameter mentioned the 4th one (20) is responsible for pointer acceleration, set it according to your need;\nxkbset ma 10 10 10 20 10\n\nTo make the setting persistent use xmodmap, you will need to create a file that specifies the desired key mappings, and then use the xmodmap command to apply the mappings.\nHere is an example of how you might use xmodmap to disable the numlock key:\nCreate a file named .Xmodmap in your home directory, and add the following line to it:\nclear mod2\n\nThis line tells xmodmap to clear the keycodes that are assigned to the mod2 modifier, which is used by the numlock key.\nRun the xmodmap command to apply the changes:\nxmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\n\nThis will disable the numlock key, causing it to have no effect when you press it.\n", "Q: Accessing Ubuntu from Windows over Samba: The specified network name is no longer available I've just installed Samba on my Ubuntu 12.04 machine and need to access it from Windows Server 2008.\n$ sudo apt-get install samba\n$ service smbd status\nsmbd start/running, process 23485\n\nWhen I try to connect from the Windows Run dialog using \\\\192.168.1.111 (verified using ifconfig) I see the error message:\n\n\\\\192.168.1.111\nThe specified network name is no longer available\n\nThis error pops up immediately.

I've been playing around with Ubuntu only for some short time and I really enjoyed it. I want to buy a new laptop, and the thing is, although I have mac at work and it's great to work with, I don't want to pay 2500e for a new laptop. I'd rather pay half and spend the rest on a trip to the Caribbean.\nSo, I was wondering if I could buy a powerful PC (maybe i5 or i7 quad core and 16G of RAM) and use something stable and fast like Ubuntu as my main OS, with Windows 7 setup in VirtualBox. \nI need windows because I will still need to use FlashDevelop (only on windows) and Adobe Flash IDE and maybe Adobe Fireworks (Although I could get use to GIMP instead). So how about if I dedicated at least 6G of ram to a virtual machine with windows for when I need to develop projecs with this software? \nWill it run fast enough?  \n\nA: VirtualBox is a good solution to have occasional access to Windows, or to be able to quickly run a Windows application without having to reboot. It is also a good solution whenever you need to rapidly share your data from a Windows, and from an Ubuntu application.\nBut there are some drawbacks from a virtual machine. As it is true that the performance of mere data processing applications or editors will be more than sufficient given the specs of your machine this is not true for graphic intense applications.\nI have no experience how much the flash development tools make use of your graphics card but I suspect they do a lot. In this case you may not be happy with the somewhat sluggish performance in a virtual machine. It may be good enough for testing, but probably not for application development, where it is also critical to not introduce bugs from the virtualization environment.\nTherefore I would go for a dual-boot setup where you boot Windows for development, and Ubuntu for safety. \nBut I might be wrong, it may be that VirtualBox performs good enough for you, and on your individual machine. You need to test this, really. Intall Ubuntu as dual-boot with your presumably already preinstalled Windows. It is not much of an effort to also install Virtual Box to run Windows in Ubuntu 1 . In case you are happy with the performance, just leave Windows sitting there for an occasional boot, or remove it  later.\n 1  Note that for running an additional Windows in Virtual Box you will need a separate own licence.\n\nA: I would rather say that the better option is to use dual boot GRUB (Ubuntu/Windows) -- especially if you consider doing so for a longer period of time.\nThe 3D acceleration provided by virtualbox is rather basic and you would be far better off using a faster GPU on Windows where it is fully supported (especially with DirectX). Another thing is the fact that you would need a full box license of Windows to run it in virtualbox. Most laptops come with OEM version that wouldn't be sufficient in the legal terms.\nIn other words, it is possible, however as with gaming through virtualbox -- it's still better to use a normal installation of Windows for it. \n", "Q: Xampp says it's running but is not reachable Very awkward problem...

FAT / FAT32 formatted drives don't support file permissions. The permissions for everything are determined by how the drive is mounted. When you set the permission open it worked when you \nserver# sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /home/storage -o umask=000\n\nAs for it not auto mounting on reboot\nUUID=8C52-C1CD /home/storage auto user,umask=000,utf8, -->noauto<-- 0 0\n\nThe \"noauto\" makes this NOT automatically mount when the system starts and parses the /etc/fstab file.  Remove that option and it will mount on startup. You can set the permissions on the mount point once it's mounted with chmod or specify them in /etc/fstab.  \nIf you need the media user to access it, you can set the permissions to 764, and add them to the security group. Root always has access to everything.  \nsee http://www.linux.org/threads/file-permissions-chmod.4094/ for some examples of propper file permissions\nOn a side note, bodhi.zazen made a good point\nIs there some reason you need to use FAT ? If not, I would back up the data and use a linux native file system. You can then set ownership and permissions.\n\nA: Note: as mentioned in the comments below, be careful using 0777 permissions: it means anyone, or any script, on the machine can write to the drive. With that caveat in mind, this can sometimes be a useful fix in a pinch:\nYou can also run\nsudo chmod 0777 /home/storage\n\nSince FAT drives don't have permissions, linux applies the permission of the mount point to the entire drive.\n\nA: Unless overridden by mount options GID= or UID= the owner and permissions of\nthe mount point upon mounting become those of the filesystem tree being\nmounted.\nSo if /dev/sdb1 contains an ext4 filesystem (say a backup) owned by user\nthen user will become the owner of the mount point upon successful mount.\nStarting off we have an empty folder 'backup' to serve as the mount point,\nand is owned by root.\n# ls -alR /mnt\n/mnt/:\ndrwxr-x---  5 root root 4096 May 30 20:59 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Dec  5  2015 ../\ndrwx------  2 root root 4096 Jan  1 07:45 backup/\n\n/mnt/backup:\ndrwx------  2 root root 4096 Jan  1 07:45 .\ndrwxr-x---  5 root root 4096 May 30 20:59 ..\n\nnow we mount /dev/sdb1 (read-only)\n# mount -o ro /dev/sdb1 /mnt/backup\n\nand lets see...\n# ls -alR\n/mnt/:\ndrwxr-x---  5 root root 4096 May 30 20:59 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Dec  5  2015 ../\ndrwx------  2 user user 4096 Jan  1 07:45 backup/\n\n/mnt/backup:\ndrwx------  2 user user 4096 Jan  1 07:45 .\ndrwxr-x---  5 root root 4096 May 30 20:59 ..\n-rw-------  1 user user 252076021760 Jun  9 21:11 backup.tar\n\nNow if you've got an empty drive and you want to mount it for 'user' as an\nextension of 'user's disk space, mount the drive as root, chown the root of\nthe mount to 'user' and unmount.\nThe next time the filesystem is mounted (by root or anyone as per fstab) the\nowner of the mount will be 'user'.\n\nA: Without mounting to /home/storage (very fast):\n$ pcmanfm  \n$ df -h  \n... /dev/sdb2 ...  \n$ chown -hR user:group /media/user/a13*  \n\n\nA: If you do have external storage device connected to your Linux box with NTFS, make sure that the filesystem is clean.\nBefore you mount the storage to your Linux box:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the below command\nntfsfix /dev/storagedevice ( like sdb1 or sdc1 )  \n\n\n*Reboot your Linux box  \n\n*Mount the external storage by running the command:    \nmount -o rw /dev/storagedevice /media/ \n\nor \nmount -o rw /dev/storagedevice /mnt/ \n\nor mount the storagedevice via GUI.\n", "Q: What is HID_MAX_USAGES Question:\nWhat is HID_MAX_USAGES? What is it used for?

Otherwise my gaming-mouse is not recognized by ubuntu. So I want to know what this value is good for, before changing my system.\n\nA: I think the HID_MAX_USAGES is so \"small\" cause a HID-device report descriptor in cases where the hid-devices report the right size, the size is way smaller, and in that case it's descriptor won't exceed the hard coded HID_MAX_USAGES limit. \nWhen you get the issue of your keyboard or mice not working, and after a recompile of the kernel with the increased HID_MAX_USES your device start working. Is that most likely because the lower limit would reject parsing the reported descriptor.\nAfter reading and googling some did I inspect some Linux drivers that seemed to override what the device reported itself. Eg. if the device reported it had 2^15 the driver could override it to the maximum allowed by the HID_MAX_USAGES, or with the device usages actually size.\nSo short summed, basically what happens, the hid-device report descriptor specifies an excessively large number of consumer usages (eg. 2^15 ), which is more than HID_MAX_USAGES. This prevents proper parsing of the reported descriptor and most likely the device or parts of it won't work.\nI have been using the dirty hack of increment the HID_MAX_USAGES myself in a production environment. How dirty it is have I asked with no good answers. But with my knowledge I can see that the hack leaves a bigger memory-footprint, I have not looked into if it might be able to slightly hurt performance a bit. I could not see the hack pose any security risk. (Please correct me if I am wrong.)\nI believe incrementing the HID_MAX_USAGES in a bug-report is out of the question for any mainline kernel, it is no optimal solution. Rater I would suggest you to submit a detailed bug-report about your hid- keyboard\\mice not working.

I have dived several times into the labyrinthine locales configuration system, reading man pages and browsing the Internet. Every blog/tutorial/Q&A I read is either incomplete, adventurous, hyper complex, risky, contradictory, erroneous, incomprehensible, out of the case explanation, or all of them at the same time, and never explain how to undo the changes they suggest.\nWhen installing a normal Ubuntu desktop, I want these reasonable settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*A certain keyboard model, in a certain language with certain options.\n\n*A certain (different) language for default user folders, for the system and programs.\n\n*A certain (different) language for numeric (thousands and decimals notation) format.\n\n*A certain (different) language for dates format (the same as the keyboard language, in my case)\n\n*And, last but not least, I'd like the desktop calendar to consider weeks starting at monday rather than sunday.\n\n\nTo configure these few things is something super simple in Windows, but in Ubuntu it seems to be a freaking nightmare.\nFor EXAMPLE, I may want:\n\n\n*\n\n*A certain Apple keyboard for Spain with its special symbols.\n\n*All the system: names, messages, help info, applications,\nbuttons..., in English.\n\n*Dots to separate decimals and commas to separate thousands (not the\nSpanish way)\n\n*Date formats in a certain Spanish format.\n\n*Weeks starting at Monday in the desktop calendar.\n\n\nCan anybody help?\nI am still waiting for an answer to this common problem.\nIs there no clear simple way to do it?\n\nA: You can manually edit the localisation settings. From your example I would suggest that you use some English version as the base language and add other bits according to your needs. Other bits you can get from other locale settings that must be also installed in your system. That is, if you want the system to be in Italian, dates in Russian style and numbers in Finnish the these packages to support those languages must be installed in your system.\nYou can see the full list of locales installed in your system by running this command in the terminal: \n$ locale -a.\n\nOr you can open System settings->Language support->Install/Remove languages. All the installed languages will be checked. To add or remove languages just check some more or uncheck unwanted ones. From your example I advise you use just English(includes many versions)+Spanish.\nThe specifics of your current localisation settings can be checked with this command:\n$ locale\n\nHere is what these settings refer to:\nLANG - Provides default value for LC_* variables that have not been explicitly set. \nLC_ALL - Overrides individual LC_* settings: if LC_ALL is set, none of the below have any effect. \nLC_CTYPE - How characters are classified as letters, numbers etc. This determines things like how characters are converted between upper and lower case. \nLC_NUMERIC - How you format your numbers. For example, in many countries a period (.) is used as a decimal separator, while others use a comma (,). \nLC_TIME - How your time and date are formatted. Use for example \"en_DK.UTF-8\" to get a 24-hour-clock in some programs. \nLC_COLLATE - How strings (file names...) are alphabetically sorted. Using the \"C\" or \"POSIX\" locale here results in a strcmp()-like sort order, which may be preferable to language-specific locales. \nLC_MONETARY - What currency you use, its name, and its symbol. \nLC_MESSAGES - What language should be used for system messages. \nLC_PAPER - Paper sizes: 11 x 17 inches, A4, etc. \nLC_NAME - How names are represented (surname first or last, etc.). \nLC_ADDRESS - How addresses are formatted (country first or last, where zip code goes etc.). \nLC_TELEPHONE - What your telephone numbers look like. \nLC_MEASUREMENT - What units of measurement are used (feet, meters, pounds, kilos etc.). \nLC_IDENTIFICATION - Metadata about the locale information. \nHere is your fix (hopefully):\n\n\n*\n\n*For folders and the system use chosen English language as the main\nlanguage and that's it.\n\n*For numeric values (with dots to separate decimals and commas to separate thousands) you could either just use the British English as the base for your system. But if you chose to use US English instead modify the “.profile” file in your home directory by adding this line to it:\nexport LC_NUMERIC=”en_GB.utf8”\n\n*For the dates and calendar you just need to change the time format localisation to Spanish (as far as I know then also the weeks will start with Mondays).\nSo add also this line to the same .profile file in your home directory:\nexport LC_TIME=\"es_ES.utf8\"\nLocalisation will be applied on the next time you login to Ubuntu. You can check then the results by running “locale” command once more or just see if everything functions as you would like to.\nKeyboard settings are separate from localisation settings and for your specific problem with the Apple keyboard use “console-data” package.\nFor this run: \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure console-data\n\nBut as probably the package is not yet installed in your system run this:\nsudo apt-get install console-data\n\nThe install includes configuring your keyboard settings, so probably that is all you need.\nThe mac Spanish keyboard was listed there – hopefully that is what you need.\nHopefully these tips will solve your problems.\n", "Q: Grub prompt after upgrade from 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS I am a Linux newbie who has tried to update from Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (used for 3 years) to 12.04 LTS on my Dell desktop using update manager.\nI thought all was working well, even though my HD partition desktop is small (just 20gb) and commentary stated short disk space. \nI am now faced with the grub> prompt, what do I do now? \nCan I go back to 10.04 or boot via USB?\n\nA: You need to boot into Ubuntu 12.04 using a live CD & install 'boot-repair'.\nYou will first need to add the repository using this command:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\n\nThen update your index & install boot-repair using\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\nOnce installed, run the programs \"Recommended Repair\" option.\nThis program is nothing short of a lifesaver.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Are you wanting to \"upgrade\" or are you willing to do a clean install?

So open a terminal and:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\nand edit away what you do not need. Add a # before the line to comment it out. It is better than deleting it, just in case you make a mistake you can go back.\nEvery time you change this, always do an sudo apt-get update to verify that everything is OK. apt-get will notify you if there is a problem with one of the repositories (Misspelled, Wrong symbols, etc..)\n", "Q: Erase backup files external hard drive I'm looking for a way to delete automatic backup files (those on the form \"filename.extension~\") from a external hard drive, where I keep a backup from my main disk.\nIf the files were in /home, I could erase them with bleachbit or a similar program, like ubuntu tweak.\nIs it possible to do?\n\nA: Here's a command-line way of doing this using find. It's a little bit more advanced than using a GUI like Ubuntu Tweak, though.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the mount point of your external hard drive. Several ways exist:\n\n\n*\n\n*In your file manager, press Ctrl+L to get a text-based location bar. Copy this absolute location to your clipboard.\n\n*In a terminal identify the hard drive using cat /proc/mounts and locate the mount point. Example:\n/dev/sdc1 /media/1589-880A vfat rw,nosuid,[...]\n\nIndicates the mount point as /media/1589-880A.\n\n\n*Open a terminal and use the following find command to list the files matching the search we're performing. Replace the /media path here with the mount point you just found in the previous step. I've added -type f to filter for files only - disregarding links and directories.\nfind /media/1589-880A -name \"*~\" -type f\n\n\n*If you feel happy about the results and you are sure you want to delete these files, then perform the delete like this:\nfind /media/1589-880A -name \"*~\" -type f -delete\n\nNote: These files will not be sent to the Trash! They go to oblivion straight away. No easy undo exists. Don't ask for undoing this.\nFeel free to modify the *~ pattern to allow other matches for other use cases (e.g. *.bak, autobackup-2012-*.tar.gz, etc. It's just using plain shell globbing. It's also perfectly possible to select a sub folder or even a parent folder instead of the mount point. Anyway, always list first before deleting!\nOptionally add -xdev to the find command to prevent it descending into other file systems if you're unsure about it.\n\nA: At a command line prompt in a shell, you can use a command like\nrm -i *~\n\nto delete from the current directory those files whose names end in ~.  The -i flag tells rm (the “remove” command) to inquire before deleting.  If you are not familiar with using shell commands, keep the -i flag in there until you are familiar, because minor errors like a space in the wrong place can have major consequences.\nTo list the files that will be affected in the current directory, you can say any of the following.\nls *~\nls -l *~\nls -la *~\n\nTo make a particular directory be the current working directory, use the cd command and the name of the directory.  For example, if you deduce that your backup disk is mounted at /media/xyz (either via the cat /proc/mounts command mentioned in another answer, or more directly via command mount with no parameters, or via df) you would say cd /media/xyz to make the top level directory of the backup drive the current working directory.\nEdit: The rm -i *~ command affects files only in the current directory, and does not affect subdirectories.  To treat indefinite levels of directories, use the find approach given in another answer.  However, if you know how deeply directories are nested, and the level is shallow, you might use a command like\nrm -i  *~  */*~  */*/*~\n\nwhich as shown would delete ~ files in the current directory, its direct subdirectories, and their direct subdirectories.\nEdit 2: As gertvdijk mentions in a comment, the clumsy rm shown in previous edit can be streamlined by using ** Bash 4.0+ recursive shell globbing (1).  After the command shopt -s globstar has been entered, free-standing instances of ** will glob recursively, ie will stand for all names in current directory and its descendants.  (shopt -u globstar turns globstar off, but since one is unlikely to type ** by mistake it seems reasonable to leave it turned on in interactive shells.)

When I do restart into Ubuntu (I have a dual-boot with Windows 7), it tells me that it detected a disk error, and that I have to press f to fix it, after which it will restart successfully.\nMy Windows 7 doesn't have any problems with it, so it can't be the hard disk. I also saw on a forum that I should run these commands to fix the issue: mount --options remount,rw / and mount --all, but these just say that I cannot mount the device on a read-only system. I'm a Linux newbie (and a newbie with computers in general) so any help would be greatly appreciated!\nEDIT 1:\nOkay, so I ran fsck from the boot CD… Is it supposed to only take two seconds? 'Cuz mine did. Anyway, it came back with two errors:   \nSuperblock last mount time is in the future (hardware clock incorrect)\n\nand\nSuperblock last write time is in the future (hardware clock incorrect)\n\nIt fixed both of them, apparently.\nEDIT 2:\nI just ran sudo fsck -Cf /dev/sda5.

The guide bodhi linked says to write them to a file, but I'm in LiveCD - I can't write anything to the hard disk.\n\nA: The Issue\nThe reason it randomly switches to read-only is that if the kernel detects a filesystem error, it immediately switches to read-only mode to prevent further trashing the disk.  (That is, the problem isn't with the hard disk itself, but with the filesystem on the hard drive.)  If you continue using such a corrupted filesystem, it will only get worse, not better.  The easiest way to fix it is to use a live CD/DVD; the Ubuntu install disk will do.\nThe Fix\nIt goes without saying, but step zero is, Ensure you have a backup of vital data.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your computer from the live disk.\n\n*The easiest way to perform these operations is in the terminal, so go ahead and open one with Ctrl-Alt-T.\n\n*Run sudo blkid to get a list of all the block devices on the computer.  You are looking for the partition you installed Ubuntu to; it will likely be /dev/sdaX, where X is some number.  If you have absolutely no idea which one it is, it will likely be the only one formatted as ext3 or ext4 (TYPE=\"ext4\").\n\n*Run sudo umount <your partition> to ensure the partition is unmounted; the filesystem checker will refuse to operate on a mounted disk.\n\n*Run sudo fsck -Cy <your partition>.  The -C option displays a progress bar and is entirely for show.  -y tells fsck to go ahead and fix everything it finds.  If it comes back with errors, use your best judgement, or post them here and I'll look at them.\n\n*Reboot; hopefully, you're done!  If you'd like, you can run fsck more than once to ensure that it really did fix everything.\n\n\nA: If you're dual booting your machine with Ubuntu and Windows together and this issue occurs,it's because Windows changes the filesystem,in that case this might do the trick. Try disabling fast startup\nControl Panel > Hardware and Sounds > Power Options > (in the left) Choose what closing the lid does > Change settings that are currently unavailable > Untick 'Turn on fast startup'\nNow booting into Ubuntu will solve the issue.

I really, really want to use\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/cinemagraphs\nI've done a lot of research on this, but the answers seem to vary greatly and I haven't had much success with any of the other suggestions, and I can't find any answers on xubuntu 12.10, only earlier versions of xubuntu (not many), but mostly just ubuntu.\nI feel these gifs would be perfect for a background (though they are a bit low-res, good enough for now)\nAlso, I do run dual monitors, so if something can be tailored to that fact (but def not required, any info will do), I'd be most appreciative.\n\nA: (I don't know whether you have tried the following suggestions, as you haven't responded to the comment, but I thought I would mention the following ways, which are about the only options available.)\n\nGeneral Introduction\nWithout using compiz or some special compositor plugin, what you can do on Xubuntu is use xwinwrap; even though the program hasn't been updated officially for a while, there is an improved version available here with many comments posted by users. \nHowever, you may want to use the excellent gwinwrap, which is a front-end to xwinwrap. You must install it by following the instructions from the official site; it is, however, very quick and easy. You also need mplayer and xscreensaver installed in addition to xwinwrap.  Even though the documentation keeps mentioning screensavers, it does work for the desktop as well, as this useful youtube video demonstrates, and this is one way to make a desktop 'active'.\nSo, you could either use xwinwrap as it is and follow the tutorial here so that you can display your gif, or it may be easier to use gwinwrap. You could simply convert your gif to a video file and select it in gwinwrap and it would loop as the desktop background. Other options such as the size of the video could be passed to mplayer in the gwinwrap options. \nIf you run gwinwrap from terminal and select various settings and then apply them, you can see the xwinwrap command lines being used. As an example, gwinwrap executes an xwinwrap command (in conjunction with mplayer) such as this:\nnice -n 15 xwinwrap -s -st -sp -b -ni -fs -nf -ov -o 1.000000 -- mplayer /home/mike/jazz.mp4 -quiet -noconsolecontrols -loop 0 -wid WID \n\n(To kill any xwinwrap actions which have gone awry, open a terminal and run killall xwinwrap.)\nSpecific instructions\n1) Choose your animated gif from your collections and convert it to a video format such as mp4 or avi; you can do this directly with ffmpeg, as noted in the suggestions from this superuser question. If the quality isn't what you expected, try the other alternatives.\n2) Start gwinwrap, click 'new' on the first screen, and then on the second, add your video of your converted gif, specify any settings and click apply (see screenshot below).\nNote: you usually have to have window compositing enabled in XFCE settings > window manager tweaks. As noted in some of the comments for xwinwrap, sometimes the video may overlay other windows depending on your graphics card. It should not happen, however, and using xwinwrap/gwinwrap is about the best way to achieve what you want.\n\n\nA: xwinwrap seems like the way to go as this answer explains. \nHowever, I couldn't get it working, so created something similar. It's basic, but does the job, you can find it here on GitHub.\nInstallation\nDownload a release from here, then extract/unzip, enter the directory, and run\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake\nmake install\n\nUsage\n\n\n*\n\n*To set a gif in the center of the screen \ngiphytool -c /path/to/animation.gif\n\n\n*For full usage guidance\ngiphytool --help\n\n", "Q: How to fix `ubi-timezone failed with exit code 1` error?

Sorry for the non-detailed answer, but I am in a hurry :)\nEdit:\nI have managed to revoke my old code of conduct, and now I have signed the 2.0 version. \nYour Code of Conduct Signature was modified.\n= Ubuntu Code of Conduct v2.0 =\n\nHowever I had some small issues; \nFor starters, I have deleted the old key I have signed the initial COC, so I generated a new one. Strangely when running the command :\ngpg --clearsign UbuntuCodeofConduct-2.0.txt\n\nthe default key is taken. I had now multiple on my key-ring, so I wasn't signing with the one I had just re-registered on Launchpad's site.\nThe correct command to sign the COC with the chosen key is:\ngpg -u <name of wanted key> --clearsign UbuntuCodeofConduct-2.0.txt\n\nSo when I finally managed to sign the COC with the wanted key, Launchpad wasn't accepting the response I was generating. Honestly I have copy/pasted the response at least 15 times, until it finally accepted it. :)\nSo there I go, now I have version 2.0 signed.\n", "Q: Disabling All Keyboard Shortcuts Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Hey I want to lock down Ubuntu so that it only has access to chrome and the ability to logout.

The following image illustrates the partition setup I have in my head, but what I'm unsure about is the data partition.\nI've heard Linux support for NTFS is fairly good nowadays, but since it is ultimately reverse engineered it is still not perfect. Is there a possibility I could lose data when Ubuntu is accessing it? And should I follow a different method to share files?\n\nThanks :)\n\nA: The short answer is Yes.\nWhat I did is that in Ubuntu, I modified the default location of the Documents, Pictures, Video folders etc. to point to folders on the Data parititon, by changing the ~/.config/user-dirs.dir file.\nIt goes without saying that the Data partition needs to be mounted at boot. So you will have to add it to your /etc/fstab file. There should be a line which should look something like this:\n/dev/sda7   /mnt/Data   ntfs    uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=027,fmask=137   0   0\n\nWhere /dev/sda7 is the partition location and /mnt/Data is where it is mounted.\nIn Windows, you can also personalise the location of the standard folders. This depends on your Windows version. Google it and you'll find how.\n\nA: My whole family has always found it easiest to share massive amounts of data via an NTFS partition since ownership doesn't matter on NTFS.  It is on a computer that had Windows installed originally and though I hardly ever use it the partition is also available to Windows.  I have done this on half a dozen computers since 8.04 and have never had a problem.  On computers where Windows is the primary OS, I typically just use one of the Windows directories as the transfer point since I can just as easily mount the Windows boot disk (partition) for use in Ubuntu, note however that this method only works one direction (I can't access the Ubuntu boot partition from Windows).\n", "Q: Installation in mac from bootable usb stick I have two installation issues. \n1) Trying to install UBUNTU in a macbook air mac osx, I can't seem to get past step 7: Run diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN (replace N with the disk number from the last command; in the previous example, N would be 2).

I have a RedHat Linux machine that I use to host subversion and run a number of CAD tools on.  RedHat is now so out-of-date that it refuses to update Firefox.  So I'd like to upgrade to Ubuntu.

Just install openssh (sudo apt-get install openssh-server) and packages you need and you have a lean and mean server.\nSince the Server Edition uses the same repository as the Desktop Edition, you can always upgrade it to a fully fledged desktop later on:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nOh and I'd suggest you go for the Long Term Support version, which currently is 12.04 (Precise Pangolin).\n", "Q: Can't get 1920 x 1080 in Ubuntu via VMWare I just installed Ubuntu and typed in sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools\nI can change my resolution to 1920 x 1200, but not 1920 x 1080.

But keep in mind that the resolution will be auto adjusted only when on fullscreen mode, not when on windowed mode.\n\nA: My solution:\nCreate a text file with .sh extension. For example setscreen.sh\nInsert the following text and save.\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080\"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode Virtual1 1920x1080\nxrandr --output Virtual1 --mode 1920x1080\n\nRun this .sh file as an executable. Screen should go to 1920x1080.\nUse \"startup applications\" to launch the file at startup.\nNote: I am running Mint 17 but this should work fine in Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can add a mode to xrander. For you, the command would be something like:\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080_60.00\"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\n\nYou might need to specifically state the output by adding the --output Virtual1 option. I calculated this commands arguments with cvt 19200 1080 60. They could be different for you. Then just switch to that mode with this\nxrandr --output Virtual1 --mode 1920x1080 --rate 60\n\n\nA: There is a workaround by a guy called \"dts-dreamer\". It's attached as a patch on the bugtracker.  \nNow for the issue: It's a regression from 12.04 and it's still in the code as of 13.04.\nThe bug received a confirmed state on the bugtracker, but Canonical didn't comment yet.\nSolution? None that I know.  \nThe xorg.conf file also works for only some of the variants. Like Ubuntu itself and Kubuntu.\nPlease flag the bug if it affects you (and if you have a Launchpad account.)\n\nA: I ran into that same problem. I had vmware tools installed and could not get it to go to full screen. What you want to try is in virtual machine (ubuntu) change the resolution there. It worked for me. For some reason it did not dynamically recognize the resolution i wanted and I had to manually change it for ubuntu. \n\nA: Adding on to dward's answer, I found that I had to use this command:\nxrandr --addmode Virtual1 1920x1080_60\n\nafter I had entered dward's first command:\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080_60.00\"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\n\nThen I was able to select the resolution in settings.\n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install open-vm-tools-desktop and reboot\napt install open-vm-tools-desktop && reboot\n\n*Install fuse and reboot\napt install fuse && reboot\n\n*set VM View->Autosize to Autofit Guest\nI tried  installing everything at once and then rebooting and resizing, it didn't work for some reason, maybe because of the apt upgrade I had done before installing open-vm-tools-desktop. The above solution worked when I did that before any package upgrade.\n\nA: Power on the virtual machine.\nLog into the virtual machine using an account with administrator or root privileges.\nGo to Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools (or VM > Install VMware Tools).\nNote: If you are running the light version of Fusion, a version of Workstation without VMware Tools, or VMware Player, you are prompted to download VMware Tools before they can be installed.

I have recently much trouble with services started by upstart. Currently I have problems with avahi-daemon and rsyslogd. Most of the time i had that problem on Ubuntu >= 12.04.\nWhat's the problem? If I stop such a service, the stop-script hangs (waited 2 day on one server).

The start/stop scripts just do nothing at a point and it is intranparent to me what causes this. I even had that problem with the unattended-upgrades\n\nA: The command to start system Upstart job is sudo start <service>. Since version 6.10. Upstart replaced the /sbin/init daemon handling starting and stopping tasks and services during boot/shutdown and supervising them while the system is running. [1]\nLog files can be found in /var/log/upstart/<service>.log. You can increase log priority from the default message to debug to get more details.

I can't tell whether this file was put there by apt-get when I ran apt-get install virtualenvwrapper (the file's mdate is several months ago), but if it was, then I'm mystified by the apparent stupidity of the arrangement...  For one thing, not everyone uses bash (I happen to use zsh).  For another, one may want to run virtualenvwrapper.sh at times other than startup...  I'm sure I'm missing something major here, but on the surface, it sure looks like the apt-get installation of virtualenvwrapper is plain retarded...

There is a small issue determining kernel version when PATCHLEVEL is 6 or greater (3.7.6 in this case). Comment out (#) if and fi lines and leave SELECTED_MAKEFILE and RET lines alone. Reinstall kernel headers and image debs, and nvidia.ko should build properly.\nUpdate: If you are also running into compatibility issue between kernel 3.7.* and virtualbox, solution is to either 1) upgrade virtualbox to 4.2.6 -or- 2) patch memobj-r0drv-linux.c to replace VM_RESERVED macro with (VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP). Good luck.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi frequency is interrupting the installation of Ubuntu via USB stick I downloaded the ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso, then I created a bootable USB stick using the guide from here. I booted via the USB stick, then after the Ubuntu logo and some circles loaded beneath it, nothing happened and my laptop started making some weird noise.\nSo I booted the USB again, but this time with acpi=off, noapic and nolapic enabled. This time the booting process went past the circle loading thing, but halted, and the weird noise started again.\nThe screenshot of the rendered lines of code:\n\nWhy isn't the OS booting properly?\n\nA: What you are seeing on the screen basically meeans that, although wifi could be detected during installation, the bandwidth on which to isolate that connection keeps flipping. This can be fixed as shown here:\nhttp://tech.chandrahasa.com/2012/05/31/fixing-wifi-regulatory-rule-in-unix/\nNow the commands that you need to execute to fix this can only be done once you have booted into ubuntu. So my sugestion to you would be to do an offline installation of ubuntu. You will not see this error (to be sure, I would even shutdown your router if thats possible)\nAfter the offline installtion, you can execute the commands as shown in the link. Your Wifi should work then.\nGd luck, let us know how you got on.\n", "Q: Grub Error 15. Can't boot I made a partition with Windows disk management (40GB) for the purpose of installing Ubuntu.

Try searching for \"google-chrome\" instead.  \n\nEdit:\nAs a general note, the longer and more specific your search term is, the smaller your chance of finding something unless you're sure of what you're searching for.\nIn this specific case, if you just typed google or chrome, the Software Center would have shown you google-chrome.\n\nA: I also had this problems, but with CHROMIUM (Google Chrome worked..)\n   ERROR:object_proxy.cc(608)] Failed to get name owner.

I will use Ubuntu for installing any kind of interesting packages and doing some programming. And, another question, can I use any partition (which is being used by Windows 7) as my home folder in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Note that you don’t need to put root and home on separate partitions, and the size depends on how much data you will store on your home as well as total space available on your hard disk. For example I myself prefer storing data on Ubuntu because on journaling file types (ex2, ex3, ex4) my data won’t get fragmented or even virus-infected and it’ll be faster to access them.\nSo let us know, if possible, how much space you have and where you will store your data more: Windows or Ubuntu.\nFor swap, you can visit this SwapFAQ; if you have much space, 3 GiB is highly recommended.\n", "Q: Reset all Google Chrome settings on Ubuntu I enabled some experimental features in Chrome (using the about:flags page), and I'm trying to reinstall it completely (since it has begun to malfunction in various ways - for example, flash applets and extensions are no longer working.)

Create new profile (User) like this.\nThan delete the old/default one.\n\n \n\nA: That was interesting!   After a routine updating in Ubuntu 14.04, Chrome would only try to start showing the first window, and after a few seconds would just disappear.\nI opened xfe in superuser mode (sudo xfe) and I went to the home/user/.config and searched for the file corresponding to google, (google-chrome).  Changed the name of that file, (just in case I needed it again), and magically, now Chrome has no problem running. Chrome managed to reconstruct the google-chrome, end even kept my bookmarks, etc. \n", "Q: Ubuntu Gnome - after install no grub menu I have sucessfully installed Ubuntu Gnome next to Win 7 OS, but after install i get no grub menu. Windows 7 just starts itself ignoring Ubuntu completely. Is there a way i can boot from Ubuntu live cd and manualy create grub menu?\nPlease post your sugestions below. Thank you.\n\nA: You can boot your ubuntu from a live cd called SuperGrubDisk2, which automatically detects any system on the pc. When successfully booted, you have to reinstall the GRUB-Bootloader:\nsudo update-grub\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdx   \n\n(where 'x' is the appropriate character for your harddisk, probably 'a')\n", "Q: Where to publish useful customised functions I have started to write a customise function, that encapsulates a bunch of actions that make my daily work easier.\nA few questions about sharing the function with the community:\n\n\n*\n\n*What would be the best way to share the function with the rest of the community? \n1) Simply publish the code on a blog with the instructions to save it to a file, in a certain location?\n2) Create a package and publish it in a ppa?\nP.S. the code is in shell script.\n\nA: Personally I would post in in a blog, ask friends to review the script, and once it has been tested a bit / debugged / reviewed, assuming there is sufficient interest, sure you can package it in a ppa. \n", "Q: How can I add two bridged interfaces on separate LANS into KVM?

I have also configured the server to forward port 80 to a server sitting on my internal network. This all works fine.\nWhat I would like to do now is setup additional port forwarders to addition web servers using port 80 on my network. I have several other static internet addresses I can use externally and just need to setup forwarding to the local servers.\nI know I could just create additional Ubuntu servers, configuring each of them with different internet addresses (as well as local addresses on a 2nd NIC) and setting up port forwarding.\nIs this possible to do with a single Ubuntu server?\nI tried adding more virtual NICs to my single Ubuntu server but ran into routing problems since all these additional NICs were on the same internet subnet.\nIs setting up individual ubuntu servers for each port forward I wish to do the only way to accomplish this?\n\nA: What you are asking to do is not possible (that I know of) with NAT. There is really no way for iptables to know where to send what traffic and you can port forward only one instance of post 80.\nImo am more elegant solution is to use nginx as a reverse proxy.\nSee:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Nginx/ReverseProxy\nhttp://bostinno.com/channels/nginx-as-a-reverse-proxy-with-wordpress/\nIt works well as nginx is fast, light weight, and you can forward to your various servers based on url ;)\nNginx serves out the static content very fast and apache serves out the dynamic content (usually php) very fast (see the second link).\n\nA: if you've got specific external ips for specific internal http servers you can use iptables for NATing to the right one, like this.\nLets supose you've got a inner http servers with ips 10.10.10.2, 10.10.10.3 and 10.10.10.4\nand everytime the external ip 50.35.100.10 calls port 80 you want it to go to the 10.10.10.2 server so you use the DNAT rule like this\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -s 50.35.100.10 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 10.10.10.2\n\nand the rules keep the same for other. Now if you have no specifications like this, as bodhi.zazen said before, there is no way to do it with iptables only.\n", "Q: Where are Nautilus loading animation icons located?

I find K3b is most reliable and has the most options. YMMV and I am sure you will get other opinions from other people.\n\nA: (i'm the developer of libburn, a competitor to cdrecord)\nThere is something wrong with the drive or the (SATA ?) controller\nresp. its driver software.\nThe drive returns an error diagnostic code that is not covered\nby the relevant SCSI specs (SPC in this case).\n\nSense Bytes: F1 00 04 00 00 01 31 0A 00 32 7F 6E 09 90 00 00\n  Sense Key: 0x4 Hardware Error, deferred error, Segment 0\n  Sense Code: 0x09 Qual 0x90 (track following error) [No matching qualifier]\n\nThe first byte should be 70 to 73, but never F1.\nThus the interpretation of this diagnostic code by wodim (the cdrecord\nclone that issued these messages) might be misleading. The alternative\nform of sense data would yield a registered error code:\n 0 04 00 = No error. Logical unit not ready. Cause not reportable.\nBut i do not believe that Sense Data Format F1 should be interpreted\nlike this, which would be appropriate with format 72 or 73.\n\nI have a blu ray player and that's another problem for another time..\n\nMaybe not. I have a Sony BD-5300S Blu-ray burner which reliably goes\nmad when i just insert a CD. Afterwards, CD burned or not, it deformats\nBD-RE media (which is not an official feature of BD-RE) and spoils BD-R.\nTo heal it, i have to switch off and on the electrical power of its USB box.\nI see a similar error with Nero on a MATSHITA UJ240AS drive in\n  http://club.myce.com/f61/panasonic-matshita-bd-mlt-uj240as-doesnt-work-not-perform-start-disc-once-323543/\n\n\nSense Area: 0x70 00 04 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 7F 60 09 90\n\n\nHere, the format code is covered by the specs. But the error code\nis 4 09 90, as with your wodim run. A non-official error.\nSo i would expect that this burner is not working properly and\nshould be replaced. (Best with a different brand or model.)\nHave a nice day :)\nThomas\n", "Q: Sometimes Flash freezes in fullscreen mode. How can I just close it? Almost every time I use YouTube in fullscreen it freezes and doesn't let me back to the desktop.\nI want to know if it's possible close to it through the terminal or something like that. Something easier then reboot the PC all the time.\n\nA: If you can open the terminal :\ntry pkill -9 firefox \nor change Firefox , if you are using another browser  .\n\nA: you see what happens is that adobe flash did not really freeze it's just that your ubuntu locked itselft. What you have to try is to make sure that your ubuntu does not lock when it's inactive OR whenever it locks go to terminal through ctrl+alt+f1 and type in killall[space][browser] e.g killall chrome. \n", "Q: Colorize hardlinks in ls output? How can I colorize hardlinks myself? Turns out on an old Ubuntu 10.04 I have, this happens by default (same .bashrc and .profile in use), whereas on the newer Ubuntu 12.04 it doesn't.\nThis is the output on Ubuntu 10.04 (the one I desire):\n\nAnd this is the output on Ubuntu 12.04:\n\nThe relevant file is .vimrc, however, .viminfo is an ordinary file with link count 1, in contrast to the hardlinked .vimrc.\nOf course the fact that GNU coreutils uses texinfo pages instead of man pages doesn't make things easier. I found this here, but it doesn't refer to the case I am looking for.\nTL;DR: how to achieve coloring hardlinked (as in: link count > 1) files the way I like in various Ubuntu versions.\n\nA: Do this:\nLS_COLORS=\"mh=44;37\" ls -l\n\nAnd you may edit your ~/.profile to change LS_COLORS accordingly.\nBackground\nThis feature was enabled as default in 2008 has been disabled by default in 2009. Somehow the freeze for Ubuntu 10.04 was exactly in between those moments.\nUsing the Git repository of coreutils I see that the commit to revert automatic colourization has been in since version 7.5:\ngit tag --contains 0df338f6719ec2bcf1e1dea2d8b12dc66daf8a1e\nv7.5\nv7.6\n[...]\n\nIn versions before 7.1 there seems no upstream maintained support for this:\ngit tag --contains 1e48b1fee5fa2ad2d1802771eafbfcddb38a24cb\nv7.1\nv7.2\n[...]\n\nThe source file multihardlink.sh, lead me to the exact LS_COLORS value to enable it again.\nYou may want to reopen LP Bug #123423.\n\nA: Based on gertvdijk's answer, I came up with the following snippet, which suits my needs:\nif [[ -e \"/etc/debian_version\" ]] && type dircolors > /dev/null 2>&1; then\n    command dircolors|command grep -q 'hl=' && export LS_COLORS=\"ln=01;36:hl=00;36\"\n    command dircolors|command grep -q 'mh=' && export LS_COLORS=\"ln=01;36:mh=00;36\"\nfi\n\nEdit: I actually had to rewrite the snippet (see edit history).\nTurns out that ls swallows the error output concerning LS_COLORS when piping it. At least I couldn't grep for it, neither with 2>&1 nor without. Hence the changes. We check for dircolors to be available. If it is, it's expected to output a snippet of shell code (Bourne shell compatible by default) that contains the defaults for the various recognized file types. So we check for hl= or mh= respectively in the output of dircolors. This way we can detect which is expected by ls and export LS_COLORS accordingly. It may be safer to grep for :hl= and :mh= respectively to rule out the possibility for file extensions ending in hl or mh and matching our condition.\nThe above colors are light cyan on black for soft links and a darker cyan on default black for hard links.\nYou can vary the top-level condition, of course. I am currently only setting it on Debian/Ubuntu, because I have no time to test it on older RHEL/CentOS systems at the moment.\nNB: the invocations via command are to work around potential aliases/functions with the same names as the tools we try to use here.\n", "Q: Should I use 32bit version of ubuntu 12.10 or 64bit version? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat is the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit and which should I choose? \n\nAfter using Ubuntu 12.10 for awhile on a separate computer, I decided to dual boot on my windows machine.\nThe only bad thing is that I do not know which version of Ubuntu 12.10 to use 32bit or 64bit.

What is the relationship between Ubuntu and QT and Canonical?  The coming Ubuntu phone looks interesting.  Ubuntu seems to be interwoven with QT.  If my company wants to write commercial C++ apps calling QT (or Ubuntu) libraries that my company has not modified, then I do NOT have to provide my company created source code with the app, correct?  Thanks!\n\nA: Well, Qt is owned by Digia, not related to Ubuntu/Canonical.\nQt itself is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1. This allows you to create and redistribute your closed source apps very well, as long as you're dynamically linking to Qt, or adhere to the limitations of statically linking.\nSee also these Q&A on SO:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use LGPL libraries in closed source software?\n\n*QT, LGPL, Commercial closed-source application\nWhile your question is specifically about Qt, keep in mind that in case you are using other libraries in addition to it you will need to check the terms on those as well. Another library may require you to release the source, but Qt does not.\n\nA: Qt is available in 3 diffrent licenses:\n\n\n*\n\n*GPL: Suitable for open source programs, because you should release source code of your app.\n\n*LGPL: Suitable for both open source and closed source programs. You need not release source code of your app. But if you created some changes in the qt library, you should release modified sourcecode.\n\n*Commercial license: Suitable for closed source programs, You can make any change in qt libs and kept it as secret, and you can use any license for your app.  But you should purchase license from Digia\nIn most of the cases LGPL license is enough. If your app's source code is very critical contact a lawyer before choosing the license.\n", "Q: Mac dual boot fail to read ubuntu12.10 usb stick I have a late 2011 macbook pro. \nPartitioned off 40 gigs using the disk utility app.\nI have the rEFInd Boot manager correctly installed.\nFollowed ubuntu's usb stick disk image instructions.\nChecked the image using md5sum and got the correct hash back, the ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso.\nWhen I restart, it brings me to rEFInd's menu. There's a grub and a root usb stick options as well as the osx partition and the empty partition intended for ubuntu. If I go to the empty partition, there are doubles of the root and grub options.\nThey all bring me to a same grub screen. When I try any of the options my screen goes black. When I'm trying the \"install ubuntu\" option, I hear the chime after ~20 seconds, but then the screen continues to go black.\nConsidering that it was a graphics issue, I changed my resolution to 800x600 while in osx then restarted, I'm not sure if those settings would carry over as rEFInd seems to default to the highest resolution possible (1680x1050).\nAny theories or tips?

I have tried, well, what I thought was the instructions but when trying to run power point it would just give me and error \"IOPL not enabled\", I right clicked the icon and tried to set permissions to run as an executable but it would not stay clicked.\n\nA: You will be able to use (If you are using the latest wine PPA) Powerpoing 2007 with no problems, but just in case there is PlayOnLinux. In my tests, whichever you choose will work, however, some users have still reported some problems that can be tackled by:\n\n*\n\n*Going to winecfg and configuring in the library tab the gdiplus library to either (native, builtin) or (native, windows).\n\n\n*Setting the Wine Prefix variable to your .wine folder. For example if my user is cyrex then:\nWINEPREFIX=\"/home/cyrex/.wine\"\n\n\n*Using LibreOffice to simply open this files (Assigning this files to be opened with LO). In this case I suggest the latest version since it has some serious updates and fixes regarding Microsoft Office 2003/2007/2010 files.\nSince you are showing a IOPL Bug I mentioned the 2 first points to fight that problem. But as others might recommend, you should give LibreOffice a try.\n", "Q: How to bind Ctrl+arrows to Home and End keys? xmodmap does not work On Windows, I used to bind Ctrl+Left to Home and Ctrl + Right to End via ahk.\nNow I'm struggling to achieve this behavior in Ubuntu.\nI've tried editing /etc/inputrc:\n\"\\e[1;5C\": end-of-line\n\"\\e[1;5D\": beginning-of-line\n\nIt works but only in the terminal window.\nI've also tried xmodmap:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 113=Left NoSymbol Home\"\n\nbut it does not work.\nThe strange thing here is that if I bind to Shift + Left in xmodmap it works:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 113=Left Home\"\n\nMy guess here is that the default behavior of Ctrl + Left(skip words) somehow gets priority over xmodmap bindings. \nWhere can I find where the default bindings are located and how to remove it? \nOr,  maybe I could just bind needed behavior there ?\nI'm on Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: I'm using Apple aluminum keyboard on Ubuntu workstation and the following xmodmap commands did it for me:\n# remap Ctrl_L to ModeSwitch, then use it to map arrow keys so that\n# they act like on the MacBook keyboard with Fn key pressed \nxmodmap -e \"keycode 37=Mode_switch\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 113 = Left NoSymbol Home\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 114 = Right NoSymbol End\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 111 = Up NoSymbol Prior\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 116 = Down NoSymbol Next\"\n\nThis works perfectly because my Caps Lock key is remapped to Control function using Ubuntu keyboard preferences, so the left Control key is not needed. Since it is located where the Fn key is found on MacBook keyboard, switching between desktop and MacBook keyboards does not impact muscle memory.\n\nA: AutoKey can do bindings like this, but it requires running a service in the background (like ahk, but unlike xmodmap). \nConfigure a \"phrase\" where the text is <home>, the paste method is Keyboard, and the hotkey is <ctrl>-<left>:\n\n\nA: Autokey worked for me. The default Autokey behavior would be: map both right ctrl+arrow and left ctrl+arrow.

If your account was the one created as the administrator when you installed Mythtbuntu, you will already be set up to use sudo. You can then try:\nsudo -i -u mythtv\n\nHowever, if the mythtv user does not have a shell configured, then you still might not be able to log in as that user. You can try setting a shell for the mythtv user:\nsudo chsh -s /bin/bash mythtv\n\nOr rather than trying to log in as that user, simply run individual commands as that user using sudo:\nsudo -u mythtv \"<command_to_run>\"\n\nIn a similar vein, can also log in as root using sudo -i -u root, or open a new shell as root by running sudo bash.\nLastly, if you really want to, you can use sudo to set a password for the mythtv user:\nsudo passwd mythtv\n\n", "Q: Unable to install any package When I try to install ANY application through terminal, I get this error:\nReading package lists...

Right now i can only suggest you to run system utility to check and fix problems related to your drive. you can do it by either of the way.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to command prompt and type following command\nchkdsk G:\nOr you can run same utility by GUL mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*In MY COMPUTER, Right click on G drive\n\n*Go to priperties\n\n*Go to tab \"TOOLS\"\n\n*Click on Check\n\n*Select both \"Automatically Check and fix system errors\" and \"scan and attempt recovery for bad sectors\"\n\n*Run it by clicking on Start.\n\n\nHope it works.\n", "Q: problem to update ubuntu 12.10 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I fix a 404 Error using a PPA? \n\nWhen trying to update Ubuntu, I receive the following failed error message. \nW:Failed to fetch http:// ppa.launchpad.net/sevenmachines/flash/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\n, W:Failed to fetch http:// ppa.launchpad.net/sevenmachines/flash/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n, W:Failed to fetch http:// ppa.launchpad.net/sevenmachines/flash/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n, E:Some index files failed to download.

It only has 128 gb of ssd storage, and I want to be able to use Ubuntu 12.04 on it. Can I install Ubuntu onto a usb? Not to use it for installing onto my computer, but to natively run on it and act like hard drive. The USB is 32gb and if it can be done, how would I go about doing it?\nCheers.\n\nA: Although you speak of installing, the Persistant Live mode is easier to use and setup. I do not know about really installing to USB - this should theoretically be possible, but I doubt it will be much faster than the Persistant Live stick, which is painfully slow.\nUbuntu however does not take up much space; I personally use Xubuntu AMD64 and Mint Xfce x86, both with KDE runtimes and LibreOffice installed, and neither has grown beyond 6/7GB.\nSo I'd recommend you to just use it from the SSD.\nBut, since you'll need a Live USB stick anyway, I'd recommend you to just use this tool and take any version of Ubuntu you want to try for a test drive: http://www.linuxliveusb.com/en/home  ...and take it from there. I've been using it for ages and have achieved better results with it than with unetbin.\nDo note that to use the USB stick in persistant mode, you will need to add persistance in the LiLi tool. There's a big slider there to set the size of it. Just use whatever you have available.\n", "Q: How can I dub an audio track over a video I'm making with avconv?

On GPT disks, this is done by setting the \"boot flag\" on the partition, but this action on an MBR disk has a different effect: It sets the boot flag. This is a design flaw in libparted; they've overloaded the same term on entirely different concepts for GPT and MBR disks.\nYou can fix the problem using the fdisk, cfdisk, or sfdisk programs in Linux. Use the t command to change the type code from 0x0B to 0xEF, then save your changes with w.\n", "Q: Why is Eclipse Juno on my Lenovo W530 with 12.04 so slow? I got a new Lenovo W530 with 16 GB of RAM and 280 GB SSD with NVIDIA Quadro K2000M Graphics with 2GB DDR3 Memory.\nAfter trying to make 12.10 to work with dual external monitor and failed, I moved to 12.04.\nMy problem is with compiz and Eclipse:\nFirst, Eclipse is very slow - the search screen can take 30 seconds to load (the display becomes grey and after 30-60 seconds it is live again). \nActually I can't work with Eclipse because of this problem. \nI removed all the plugins and marked the other to not load at start up.\nI changed in my eclipse.ini to -Xms512m -Xmx1024m and then to -Xmx4096m.\nIn addition to this problem - generally it seems like compiz is killing my coputer - it consumes up to 10 GB of RAM.\nI tried to log-in with Ubuntu 2D - and the Eclipse problem is still there.\nI tried using gnome-classic but:\na. It has problems of its own (alt-shift not working, etc.)\nb. I don't want to give up on Unity - I really like it.\nI'm not sure if the problems are related.\nPlease remember that I'm new in the Linux world.\n--Update\nI've got back to Indigo and everything is working great. still, Juno has some great features...\n\nA: This is is the progress I have made on this problem.  I don't agree that my original post was deleted because I was providing content in the spirit of this forum: \"Help us find a solution by researching the problem, then contribute the results of your research and anything additional you’ve tried as a partial answer\"\nAs in my deleted post, I put more details of the problem in order for the original poster to compare the behavior and decide whether the problem I am addressing is the same as his.  Frequently, eclipse juno on ubuntu 12.10 is unresponsive (its window turns grey), and cpu utilization of both compiz and xorg shoot way up to 60-75% each (measured with top). It could be related to eclipse's search dialog, but might be related to any of its dialogs; I have not noticed.\nThe solutions I attempted which had limited effect:\n1) disabling compiz effects: (reputation not good enough to post the link).  Drops compiz cpu utlization to acceptable level, but xorg's cup utlization is still much to high: 70-80%.\n2) disabling scroll bar overlay.  (reputation not good enough to post the link).  The problem still occurs after this but is significantly shortened, from 30 seconds to about 3 seconds.\nCurrently I am testing this solution which seems to have positive result after a few hours:\n1) upgrading nvidia driver: http://www.noobslab.com/2011/09/nvidia-drivers-for-ubuntu-1110-oneiric.html.\nIf eclipse response is still poor, I will continue to research and post findings here, unless this answer is deleted.\n", "Q: Where are my U1-synced Tomboy notes?

A simple way of fixing this issue is to chown all the files to nobody.media inside of /data/media you are sharing and forcing clients to write as nobody.media . Your smb.conf would look like this\n[global]\n    security = user\n    guest account = nobody\n\n[media]\n    path = /data/media\n    browsable = yes\n    guest ok = yes\n    guest only = yes\n    read only = no\n    create mask = 0765\n    force user = nobody\n    force group = media\n\n", "Q: How to Manualy install the bootloader in Ubuntu 12.10 I have a small notebook that i was using a previous version of ubuntu on and it worked perfectly until i did a clean install with the latest 12.10.

(Which I assume is adobe flash player) I'm using Chrome 24.0.1312.68 which is supposed to have fixed a recent \"can't load plug-in\" error.\nI have tried the instructions on the page http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/flash-player-google-chrome.html#main__I_am_unable_to_view_Flash_content__How_do_I_get_Flash_Player_to_turn_on_ to turn flash player on and I have restarted my browser and it still gives me this error. How do I get around this error? \n\nA: Despite claims that the latest update has fixed things ...   \n\nThe Stable channel has been updated to 24.0.1312.68 for Linux. This build contains the fix for Pepper Flash.  \n\npeople may still be seeing the \"can't load plug-in\" error.\nOne workaround is to disable the Pepper Flash and use Adobe's if it's available. The Chrome browser will \"see\" the Adobe NPAPI Flash plug-in if it exists in ~/.mozilla/plugins.  \nFor people who have installed Chromium as well, along with its goodies, the Flash plug-in will be in /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so. So just copy it from there to ~/.mozilla/plugins.  \nIn the long term, Adobe's policy is to not develop Flash for Linux anymore. And so the latest Flash will be the Pepper Flash which comes with Chrome. Unfortunately, it's still highly \"experimental\".  \n\nEdit: A way to still use Pepper Flash is described here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Chrome \n\n*In chrome://plugins, enable Pepper Flash in case you disabled it (as suggested above)  \n\n*Close the Chrome browser  \n\n*Open a file manager and enable viewing of hidden files and folders (Ctrl+H)  \n\n*Either delete the ~/.config/google-chrome/PepperFlash folder or rename it to something else.  \n\n*Restart Chrome. Now Pepper Flash should work.  \n\n\nFurther edit 20130208: Version 24.0.1312.69 worked out of the box for me and didn't need the \"delete the ~/.config/google-chrome/PepperFlash folder\" hack.\n\nA: Go to chrome://plugins and set your setting like the following screenshot and refresh your page:\n\n", "Q: Duplex printing gives punched holes in wrong place When I print single sided, the punched holes (on A4) show up on the correct side of the documents.\nWhen I print duplex, the punched holes end up on the wrong side.

But this also requires that you leave the DVD in the optical drive when you reboot. If you don't leave it in, you get this error.\nWhat you likely wanted was the now hidden middle option, to Install inside Windows. This is suppressed when you're running Wubi from the DVD and to get it you have to run Wubi with the --force-wubi option. So if your DVD is drive E: then you would go to a command prompt and run E:\\wubi.exe --force-wubi.\n***I'm saying DVD instead of CD because the ISO doesn't fit on a CD anymore, but it's still referred to as the CD boot helper in Wubi.\n", "Q: How to install 12.10 on a VirtualBox under Windows 7 Host?

I have checked the packages list for Ubuntu and for Precise (12.04) it is listed.\nYou can do this 2 ways. The first would be using something like Synaptic. This is a graphical apt-get manager which can be found in the Software Center and then search for unity-2d. Alternatively, you could also look using the terminal with the command:\n    sudo apt-cache search unity-2d*\n\nThat should list all packages that have unity-2D.\nI would also make sure that you haven't actually done a distribution upgrade, in which case you would now have 12.10 which does not include Unity-2D. \nLet me know if you can find the packages\n", "Q: How to supervise and automatically restart a process? I want to have a process which will be restarted if it crashes. I googled a bit and found that an easy solution is to use daemontools.\nI didn't understand how to configure it.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the easiest way to acomplish such a functionality?\n\n*How to configure it?\n\n\nA: This answer applies to Ubuntu versions with Upstart (<= 14.10). Use another approach for versions with Systemd (>= 15.04).\nIt seems you're looking for a functionality already provided in Ubuntu with Upstart. The respawn stanza in the configuration will do exactly what you need. I would recommend against the use of a less standard way of dealing with this.\nWithout more details about the process you're trying to manage with it, it's hard to say what the configuration should look like. It depends on whether it forks and puts itself in the background for example. The Upstart documentation on the respawn stanza should give you more information.\nUnfortunately, it's not yet possible to run User Jobs properly: cannot get upstart to run user job\nExample\nLet's assume we want to keep the Calculator app running, even when it's being killed with fire (signal 9).\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a configuration file in /etc/init/calculator.conf (based on this article):\n#!upstart\ndescription \"Calculator\"\n\n# Start job via the daemon control script. Replace \"gert\" with your username.\nexec su -l gert -c 'export DISPLAY=:0; /usr/bin/gnome-calculator'\n\n# Restart the process if it dies with a signal\n# or exit code not given by the 'normal exit' stanza.\nrespawn\n\n# Give up if restart occurs 10 times in 90 seconds.\nrespawn limit 10 90\n\n\n*Start it by running\nsudo start calculator\n\n\n*It opens on your current display (:0) and enjoy the awesomeness by seeing it restarting after closing it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Identify the process ID, e.g. by doing ps aux | grep calculator:\ngert  13695 0.2 0.4 349744 16460 ?

There is a name column which will be printed here, you can use this to refer to the job with other control commands.\n\n*immortalctl stop <name>: Stops monitoring the job with the given name (it will not be automatically restarted, but the current process will continue to execute)\n\n*immortalctl -k <name>: Sends SIGKILL to the current process.\n\n*immortalctl exit <name>: Stops monitoring the job with the given name and removes it from the list of jobs.\n\n\nA: Startup and respawning processes are managed by \"systemd\" since Ubuntu 15.04, a good introduction can be found here\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/systemd-essentials-working-with-services-units-and-the-journal\nan example that get you started is available on\nhttps://www.devdungeon.com/content/creating-systemd-service-files\nThis approach supersedes older ones based on /etc/inittab and upstart. \n\nA: If you don't need daemon/service/background process functionality and just want to do it in the console then create a file called autorestart.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile [ 1 ]; do\n  some_command\ndone\n\nThen ./autorestart.sh will automatically restart some_command if it exits or crashes. CTRL-C breaks the loop and quits the program cleanly.\nTested on Ubuntu 18.04.\n\nA: There is a way without \"Upstart\". The keyword is \"inittab\" :-).

I'm concerned about the amount of proprietary software that seems to be part of Ubuntu now. I've noticed quite a few apps that in the software center are listed as \"Licence: proprietary\".\nObviously there's the partner stuff, like Skype (although that's not good example as it doesn't work in the Software Center) but there seems to be a fair load of other stuff creeping in, too.\nIs there something I've not understood here? Is it all in partner or is some proprietary stuff in the main Ubuntu repos?\nIs there a way to filter for FOSS?\nThe open source bit is important to me - I don't just want a free-beer OS as I think open source software model is better. Debian is strictly FOSS (AFAIK), for example.\n\nA: Several repositories\nUbuntu features various repositories with its own policies on the software being included there.\nSummarized from Community Wiki - Repositories:\n\n\n*\n\n*main contains applications that are free software, can be freely redistributed and are fully supported by the Ubuntu team.\nThis is the fully-FOSS section.\n\n*restricted Our commitment is to only promote free software – or software available under a free licence. However, we make exceptions for a small set of tools and drivers that make it possible to install Ubuntu and its free applications on everyday hardware.\n\n*universe is a snapshot of the free, open-source, and Linux world. It houses almost every piece of open-source software, all built from a range of public sources. Canonical does not provide a guarantee of regular security updates for software in the universe component\nOpen source, maybe FOSS\n\n*multiverse component contains software that is not free, which means the licensing requirements of this software do not meet the Ubuntu main component licence policy. [...] not supported and usually cannot be fixed or updated. Use it at your own risk.\n\n\nThese are the \"regular\" repositories which the Software Center uses to list the applications available.\nAdditional software (partners)\nAdditional to the above, there's the Extras and the Partner repositories. You'll have to enable those by yourself as an opt-in. The partner repository is more or less privately held by Canonical. It includes proprietary software in it, without source code available usually, just for reasons of being partners with Canonical or other commercial reasons.\nSome costless \"apps\" in the Software Centre are provided via the Extras repository, and have to adhere to the Extension Repository Policy. These list just a few (see below).\nThe apps submitted via the MyApps programme are another story and very much Ubuntu specific. Source code is not always available and you can find some relevant information on the MyApps commercial software FAQ. Some are commercial and closed-source only, provided via a Private PPA with APT-HTTPS authentication. The ones distributed in this way don't have to adhere to any policies apart from the Launchpad PPA policies and some technical requirements - they're fairly private to the developers.\nWhat about package x, y and z?\nTo see in which component a certain application is included, I suggest to go to packages.ubuntu.com, find the package, and in the page title you'll notice the section in brackets, e.g. Package: kcalc (4:4.9.2-0ubuntu1) [universe].\nCan I run my system with only FOSS software?\nTo filter for FOSS-only, just only enable main (and optionally universe) - just to make sure you don't let in close-source software. Edit your /etc/apt/sources.list and files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ to exclude these if you like. You may run into issues running your hardware correctly as indicated by the description of the restricted component above.\nWhether it will be very functional depends on your hardware and requirements you hold to the software you'd like to use. Some mainstream hardware doesn't require any proprietary firmware/binaries and can run perfectly fine without any closed source piece of data. The restricted and multiverse components provide a generally acceptable balance in this for most people, but you need turn them off in case you want to completely FOSS.\nThe set of applications you can pick will considerably scale down if you decide to disable the universe component. The list of all packages in Quantal has these numbers to give you some idea:\n\n\n*\n\n*main (+ security): 14250\n\n*universe: 32595\n\n*multiverse: 746\n\n*restricted: 14\n\n\nI was unable to find a credible source for the additional repositories, so by just using the regular Packages.gz files (assuming Quantal amd64):\n\n\n*\n\n*extras: 9\n\n*partner: 9\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Free software philosophy\n\n*Extension Repository Policy\n\n*How to remove the “For Purchase” section from the Software Center?\n\nA: If you disable snaps using sudo apt purge gnome-software-plugin-snap as shown in another answer, and then in Ubuntu Software Center, go to Software & Updates > Ubuntu and uncheck the option that says \"Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (multiverse)\" I think that will remove all the non-FOSS results.  At least, no proprietary results have shown up in my searches so far after doing so.   \n...except for drivers - uncheck the \"restricted\" option to get rid of those as well\n", "Q: How can I enable spell checking in Gnote?

Is there any way to fix this and set the default paths permanently?\n(Ubuntu 12.10 / Nautilus 3.4.2)\n\n\nA: I've solved this by making an executable script which I added to my startup applications.\nThe first thing we should know is that the file with your default folders is ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs, which is where you can indicate the directories of the folders you want to have listed under \"Computer\" in Nautilus.\nStep 1\nCreate the correct user-dirs.dirs file with all your desired default folders and their locations. I only had to edit two entries so I opened the original (in Terminal: gedit ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs), edited it to the correct folders and \"saved as\" in another location (namely ~/Documents/Miscellaneous/).\nStep 2\nOpen up your preferred text editor, like gedit. First we want to remove the original and incorrect user-dirs.dirs file: rm ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs. Then, we want to take the correct file we created and copy it into the ~/.config folder: cp ~/FolderWithCorrectFile/user-dirs.dirs ~/.config/. Make sure to add && between the two. In my case it came out like this: rm ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs && cp ~/Documents/Miscellaneous/user-dirs.dirs ~/.config/\nI saved this file in the same folder as the correct user-dirs.dirs file, but you can put it anywhere.\nStep 3\nNow we have to allow the file we just created to be executed as a program. The easiest way to do this is to right click on the file, go to its properties → permissions. There, check the execute tick box. Then run the file to check if it works by verifying the original user-dirs.dirs file has been replaced by your new, correct version.\nStep 4\nIf everything worked, go to \"Startup Applications\". Browse and add the file we created. Next time you boot your computer all your default folders will be there.\n\n\nA: On external harddisk right click on folder where picture is stored and press make link. Now you can see a new folder link. Cut that link and paste it on the home directory. Next rename it to Pictures (use same name as original. Before rename link move or delete or rename original picture folder). That's it. Test the link by opening picture folder in home. Now you can see the pictures in external disk.\n\nA: Bind pic folder in usb to default picture folder. Edit and add following line to /etc/fstab\n    /media/usb/\nPictures        /home/\nuser/Pictures none    rw,bind\n", "Q: apt-get -f install simply not working Every time I am trying to install a package with apt-get install I get this:\nReading package lists...

I have configured my android to auto-upload photos to the U1 cloud. Which is usefull in case I lose the phone.\nHowever from time to time I want to clean out the junk photos. \nIf I go to https://one.ubuntu.com/photos there doesn't seem to be any way to delete photos.\nIf I go to the https://one.ubuntu.com/files area and then the folder that the photos are in, I encounter the following problem:\nToo many files or folders in this folder to display, only displaying 1000 entries.\n\nSo I can't figure out how to delete photos. \nAlso if a file is deleted from the cloud will it be deleted from the sync'd devices?\n\nA: You can use the Ubuntu One Files application on Android to delete your files from the server, as well. Simply do a long press on the file in the list, and choose Delete.\nHowever, the Android application doesn't do synchronization yet. You can manually upload or download files (or use the auto-upload feature for photos), but it will not keep them in sync, if they have changed. However, deleting files from the cloud will result in them being deleted on other devices with clients which do synchronization, such as on Ubuntu, Windows, or OS X.\n", "Q: Flash On Firefox Since Adobe recently dropped support for Firefox on Linux, I can't get flash player to work properly on Adobe Connect in Ubuntu. YouTube videos work fine, I only have problems with Adobe Connect.\nI am using Ubuntu 12.10 and Firefox 18.0.1 and Flash 11.2.202.261.\nIs there a PPA or another lead I could use to get the latest (or more current) version of Flash Player for Ubuntu?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/\n\n*Choose tar.gz, download the file\n\n*Once download is complete, right click on the file (tar.gz) and click on \"Extract here\"\n\n*Launch Terminal (Keyboard Shortcut : CtrlAltT)\n\n*Go to that location where you extracted the file\n\n*Run this command : sudo cp libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/firefox-addons/plugins\n\n*Run this command : sudo cp -r usr/* /usr/\n\n*Launch Mozilla Firefox and check that you have Adobe Flash Player\n\n\nA: John Rambo. I had a similar problem about six months ago, and this is what I found to fix it.\nYou have two options at this point.\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to Google Chrome. It now has a built-in version of flash.\n\n*Check your software installation. A version of flash is available in the ubuntu-restricted-extras package, or kubuntu-restricted-extras, xubuntu-restricted-extras, etc.\n\n\nThe reason Youtube still works is because Youtube has added HTML5 support, which is built in to almost every browser (with the exception of Internet Explorer, which still doesn't fully support it as of version 9 or 10) since around 2009.\nThe flashplugin-installer package should be all you need, and that is installed with the restricted extras packages.\nPlease note that downloading and installing the .deb from Adobe does not work unless you move a file to Firefox's directory.\nAs was stated in the comments, there is no Firefox PPA, because no one needs one. Everything Firefox related that you would ever need is in the Ubuntu repositories or available through a Firefox extension.\nThe fix I recommend is installing Google Chrome JUST for Adobe connect, so long as Flash works well for everything else on Firefox.\nchrome.google.com is the place to find it.\n\nA: I don't know if it helps out but there is pipelight repo that let you run latest version of flash, shockwave, silverlight, unity player in your native linux browsers such as chromium, firefox, opera. Check it out :\nhttp://fds-team.de/cms/pipelight-installation.html\n", "Q: What is the path of libraries (samples, docs) setted up from Software Center of Ubuntu 12.04? I installed OpenCV and its DOC and Samples from software center but I cannot find the them at anywhere. What is the certain location for all these at Ubuntu12.04\n\nA: The easiest way is to issue the list-files option of dpkg from a terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*Enter the following command:\ndpkg --listfiles opencv-doc\nYou can also find the information from Synaptic Package Manager, if you prefer a GUI, but you'll have to install synaptic from the Ubuntu Software Centre first.\n", "Q: How to install Jenkins charm with dependecies? I have a question about the jenkins charm:\nAfter creating a new instance with a jenkins charm, how can I run a script with commands to install some programs needed in machine created?\n\nA: If you need quick access to the machine you can:\njuju ssh jenkins/0\n\nAssuming 0 is your machine number (you can find out specifically by running juju status). \nIf you're wanting to do this on every machine you spawn, you might want to consider downloading the charm and modifying it to meet your exact deployment needs. This is especially useful if it's things that are useful to you or your organization. You can do this by branching the code:\nbzr branch lp:charms/jenkins\n\nand then deploying from that instead of from the charm store. \nIf it's something that you feel is useful for the Jenkins-using community in general then I encourage you to consider contributing to the charm.\n", "Q: Have a secondary charm in Juju? I want to install some dependencies on a machine after it created. Have a type of secondary charm, who I could install these dependencies, even if these dependencies do not have a charm in Charm Store? \n\nA: Juju has a concept of \"Subordinate Charms\" where you can deploy charms on top of existing deployed services. One such example of this is the Nagios/NRPE charm. Where you deploy the nrpe charm on existing services and relate it to a regular Nagios charm. NRPE sits on top of whatever service it's deployed on and monitors the machine. In this case you can create a subordinate charm to deploy additional services on top of a regular charm.\nHowever, if the charm you're deploying requires these dependencies to work properly it is probably better to fork the charm, add your modifications, then deploy from your forked version.\n", "Q: Sound won't play in Kubuntu 12.04 I can't get sound to work in my computer that I just installed Kubuntu 12.04 on.

I use the laptop for work, and work from home regularly.  I have an external 30\" monitor at home, an external 23\" monitor at work, and often need to connect my laptop to projectors.\nI've found so far with Ubuntu that connecting an external monitor or projector seems to do the right thing (i.e. extends the desktop to display on the monitor/projector), but when I disconnect the monitor, it leaves the 'workspace' the same size as it was when the external monitor was connected - so I can't see any windows that were on the external monitor.  If I go into \"Workspace Switcher\", I can see the windows and drag them onto the laptop monitor to work with them.\nif I go to 'System Settings -> Display' and detect displays, it seems like the workspace size gets fixed, but instead of having all of my windows on my workspace on my laptop display, they get spread over other workspaces, so I still have to go into \"Workspace Switcher\" and drag windows around.\nI'm really hoping there's a way to get similar behaviour to MacOSX, which automatically resizes the workspace when the monitor is removed and moves all windows onto your screen so they are visible. \nAny advice or ways to make this less painful?\nUpdate on Feb 11, 2013:  I've been retesting this, and it seems like the workspace size is now being updated automatically when I disconnect/reconnect the monitor cable.   I don't believe I've changed anything, so not sure why I'm seeing different behaviour here.\nThe second part of the problem - moving all windows onto the main workspace - still exists\n\nA: Take a look at:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DynamicMultiMonitor\nLooks like it will give you some help.\n\nA: I think you posted this long time ago. I just found this post although I have a similar one too. I have found this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/compiz/+bug/763148\nIt seems to be a bug and that it has been corrected in Compiz. My problem (as silly as it may sound) is that I do not know how to update Compiz....\n", "Q: How do I use Apple Magic Trackpad for Firefox navigation? I use my trackpad with touchegg and touchegg-gce for easier configuration.\nIn the initial configuration there's an 'application' section for Chromium navigation which uses 2-finger drag that doesn't seem to work in Chromium or in Firefox (when I add Firefox).\nThe problem seems to be that the 2-finger drag is used for scrolling left and right. I have the feeling that an override for this function in Chromium or Firefox doesn't work and scrolling is \"more important\" than forward or back navigation.\nWith an iMac I saw that this is possible so did anyone get the trackpad to be usable for browser navigation?\n\nA: You can emulate Firefox 'forward' and 'backward' navigation in Touchegg. The normal hotkeys that are used in Firefox for 'forward' and 'backward' navigation are alt-right and alt-left respectively, so it's just a case of configuring Touchegg with a sendkeys action to perform this. I use 3 finger left and right drag mapped to these hotkeys. This emulates the behaviour in Safari on a Macbook. Hope this helps.\n\nA: I forgot to add that you also need to disable the Alt key from showing the Unity HUD otherwise you get a 'command' window pop up in the HUD when trying to navigate backwards and forwards. You can do this by running CompizConfigSettingsManager (CCSM), and then using the search filter for the 'Ubuntu Unity Plugin'. Next, disable the 'Key to show the HUD' (it's Alt by default, you can also map it to something else if desired). \nAfter all this you should be able to navigate forwards and backwards in Firefox using 3 finger left and right swipes.\n\nA: One thing you can check out, as well, is the about:config option in Firefox. Do a search on \"swipe\" and see if those are set to how you want.\n", "Q: Use default music player in Dash When I select music file with Files & Folders lense, it loads it with default music player.

Just make sure in script 2 you rename it from script2.\nThen have the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*in your C program, you can create the output file first and write whatever you need first (i.e. fopen(\"output\", \"w\")). And write to it if you need. Close the file pointer.\n\n*Launch the scripts in the background. (system call that you have)\n\n*Rename the file \"output\" to \"output.script1\" and the script 1 will pick it up.\n\n\nA: Maybe you can fork GNU Parallel and redirect the output to the file:\nsystem(\"(echo script1.sh; echo script2.sh) | parallel > output.txt\");\n\n", "Q: 12.10 Ubuntu will not boot due to no space left on device I have a windows 7 / Ubuntu 12.10 system that has been booting and running without problems for several months.

The --progress is an extra nice touch to show progress.

To solve it, I'm using bumblebee since he manages my needs of performances, and with that, doesn't overheats my notebook. I don't know if there is such software for AMD, but you should look for that, since the fan works nonstop for this reason.\n\nA: have you looked at this post here? \nhttp://asusm51ta-with-linux.blogspot.com.br/ \n\n(4) OPTIONAL: Script to turn off laptop\nThis next script is used to turn off the computer. Because, in my\n  case, if I turn off the computer without switching on both cards\n  (specially when the integrated card is on and the discrete card is\n  off), the fan runs at full speed when I turn it on again, stoping only\n  after rebooting. Hence, to avoid this, this other launcher can be used\n  to turn off the computer:\n\n\nA: I had the same issue, and after dwelling for whole day, my fan stopped making noise. This have to do with using GPU. I tried few suggestion from askubuntu, but the one worked for me was from AMD website.  \nGo to http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx and from the list, select the Graphic card you have in your pc. Download it and make the file executable and run it via Terminal. Something graphical installer will pop-up, select what best suits you (I did not select custom), and after finishing installation, just reboot your pc.  \nI don't have the fan noise now, and my Graphics are working perfectly. I also have AMD Catalyst Manager to play with... \n\nA: I have a pretty similar model.\nI have the catalyst driver installed (HD 7700 Radeon).  VGAswitcheroo does not work for me AT ALL - it hangs the machine. Many different revisions of the catalyst driver and BIOS. (I'm at A09 now).  I don't think that there is a way to roll-back the BIOS, but I recall that some earlier models have a set of contacts on the motherboard that you can ground and that clears the bios back to the original state. But this was desktop machines, and over a decade ago.\nMy fan seems to spin up when it needs to - but wont spin-down when it's not needed.\nI have the same problem with speed-step. (seems to default to 2.10 GHz on wake-from-sleep, requiring manual reconfiguration every time).\nAlso, every time I reboot, I have to turn-off Bluetooth. That setting won't persist.\nWhat I do for my fan, is I use \"sudo i8kfan 0 0\" (from i8kutils) in a terminal, to spin-down the fan. But I must use the Hardware Sensors Indicator and PSensor to tell me whether it ever overheats, (because sometimes the fan won't spin back up; if ambient room temperature is hot, and CPU load goes up).  I use CPU Scaling Frequency Indicator to ramp down the clock to 1.2 GHz (which is fine for almost all purposes), and this generally keeps the temperature down low so that I can run the fan at 0 or 1 (depending on the air temperature).\nI also have a conky setup that keeps track of the CPU frequency, and heat, and fan-speed relationship. So that I always have a visual cue.  (It's not a problem that I need to monitor manually, if I just leave the fans alone at 2, which is full-speed, but then it's loud).\nI'd really like it if there was a tool that could automatically and dynamically balance these factors.  And especially, the fan-speed override - without having to use a command-line where I have to authenticate.\n\nA: I have the same model but with a higher spec. I don't use Ubuntu but I had the same fan speed problem. When I searched on the web for solutions I found this one as well as some others. I hope the following are helpful.\necho \"min_power\" | sudo tee /sys/class/scsi_host/host*/link_power_management_policy\n\nThis helps a little. But did you try to run this command?\npm-powersave true\n\nThis script not only sets min_power, but a lot of other power related tweakings.\nAnother approach you can try is to create a file /etc/modprobe.d/i915-kms.conf and put the following line in the file. I got this from here.\noptions i915 modeset=1 i915_enable_rc6=1 i915_enable_fbc=1 lvds_downclock=1 semaphores=1\n\nDepending on the kernel version you use the acceptable i915_enable_rc6 value is different. The patch here describes the difference. You can run modinfo i915 | fgrep i915_enable_rc6 to see if a value higher than 1 is acceptable.\n\nA: Check the discussion on this bug I opened recently. It has many great advices and links for dell inspiron machines. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/1272781\n\nA: Didn't saw you mentioned using Intel(R) Graphics Installer for Linux.\nI had some fan issues myself. The problem seems to be the conflict between CPU and GPU graphics.

For this to work you have to make sure that your CPU supports Intel VT-x for Intel processors or AMD-v for AMD processors and that it is turned on in BIOS;\n\n*Enable 3d Acceleration: VM Settings -> Display -> Video tab;\n\n*Allocate to the VM that much memory and run that many programs on Host together with VM, that your Host OS has enough free RAM left;\n\n*The above were primary recommendations that really make a difference and are easily achievable, however there are a lot of other ways to improve performance of virtual machines to a different extent. Here are some examples:\n\n*\n\n*put your VM on a separate hard drive to improve I/O (can be a major performance gain, but requires a separate hard drive);\n\n*disable all the unneeded services/programs/visual effects on Guest;\n\n*if your Host/Guest filesystem supports defragmentation - use it. There are also tools that can try to defragment a specific file (virtual disk image in our case);\n\n*install Guest Additions;\n\n*if you have enough RAM you can disable swap file/partition on Host completely or tune it in a way that it is used only when a large portion of RAM (like 90%) is used.\n\n*exclude virtual disk images of your virtual machines from Antivirus checklist\n\n*and so on.\n\n\n\nFor a comprehensive list of approaches to increase VM performance, have a look at this article http://www.hanselman.com/blog/VMPerformanceChecklistBeforeYouComplainThatYourVirtualMachineIsSlow.aspx\n\nA: Having very slow perform when running Ubuntu 12.10 and 13.04 in virtualbox?

It makes running ubuntu in virualbox really slow.\nTo check if your Ubuntu 12.10 or 13.04 guest is using 3D acceleration\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\nYou should see something like this\nNot software rendered: no\nNot blacklisted: yes\nGLX fbconfig: yes\nGLX texture from pixmap: yes\nGL npot or rect textures: yes\nGL vertex program: yes\nGL fragment program: yes\nGL vertex buffer object: yes\nGL framebuffer object: yes\nGL version is 1.4+: yes\nUnity 3D supported: no\n\nIf you see “Not software rendered” and “Unity 3D supported” both say no. This means Unity is using slow LLVMpipe.\nTo enable 3D supported, fist you will need to update linux-headers\nuname -r\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nNow insert vitualbox guest iso from devices and to install manually\ncd /media\nls\ncd username\nls\ncd VBOX*\nls\nsudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nInsert vboxvideo to /etc/modules\nsudo nano /etc/modules\n\nAdd “vboxvideo” at the end of the file\nloop\nlp\nvboxvideo\n\nReboot the machine\nsudo reboot\n\nSource: http://namhuy.net/951/how-to-fix-slow-performance-ubuntu-13-04-running-in-virtualbox.html\n\nA: The other answer is good, but the link with more information seems Microsoft-centric.\nThis link http://blog.jdpfu.com/2012/09/14/solution-for-slow-ubuntu-in-virtualbox has a Win7 host, Ubuntu Guest solution for VirtualBox with specific VirtualBox settings. It is about running Ubuntu Guests too:\nDisk I/O - virtIO, if possible; SATA if no other choice\n\n\n*\n\n*Allocate the minimal CPU and RAM for the guest workload\n\n*Network I/O - virtIO, if possible; Intel PRO/1000 if no other choice\n\n*Keep disk storage allocations as small as possible.\n\n*Use pre-allocated storage files on spinning disks; avoid sparc files.  If you have SSD, use whatever storage you like - even QCOW2 with compression\n\n*Turn down the graphics \"cheese\" - No 2D or 3D extensions, at least not initially. Unity and Gnome3 suck graphics.  Try them after you have a highly responsive system working with a simple GUI.\n\n*Never over-allocate RAM or CPU. Sharing.\n\n*1 CPU is usually enough for most guests, even if you have 6, more than 2 CPUs per guest just isn't necessary, even for an email server for 50 people.\n\n*Leave 1G of RAM for the hostOS and 1 CPU for the hostOS, if you can.\n\n\nAnyway, hope this helps.\nBTW, How do I improve the performance of my VirtualBox guest? is a similar question with slightly different information.\n", "Q: Hosting a website on UbuntuOne Recently, google drive offered a way to host websites. \nIs it possible to do something similar using UbuntuOne?\n\nA: Yes, you can. But there are certain caveats.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you publish the file, the address would be some random string like http://ubuntuone.com/0vKfOjPz0ZJSqXY8Q5B6i6flkasdjflkjsadflalkfdsjkjf, so it'd not be easy to remember.\n\n\nOfcourse you can use URL shorteners, but that's an extra layer of effort.\n\n\n*\n\n*The CSS and JS files you use need to be shared as well, if they're stored on your Ubuntu One account, otherwise you can link them directly.\n\n*The above point would make your HTML code from something like:\n\n\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/css.css\" />\n\nto something like:\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheel\" href=\"http://ubuntuone.com/somerandomstring\"/>\n\nIf you can handle all of it, you're good to go!\nHere's a sample page for an example linking to another CSS file: http://ubuntuone.com/3z3QTmzw9kJZmisMOKxnL3 (The link doesn't work anymore).\n\nA: The short answer is Yes, but here is more information that may help you: \n\ngoogle drive offered a way to host websites\n\nWhat they offered isn't host websites precisely, but a simply file host. And if this files can be public and if their content is a HTML web page, then you can call it as a website host (bad).\nAs Ubuntu One offer the same service than Google Drive (theoretically) it will work in the same way.\nThe things that you have to take into account are:\n\n\n*\n\n*You won't get an specific domain, it will have a lot of strange characters.\n\n*The traffic limit of your page is a real problem.\n\n*As you don't have a full server host, you will not be able to use technology like PHP or database software and many other tools.\n\n*And obviously the storage capacity..\n\n\nBut if you want to share information or play on the world of the web design it's a funny/useful tool.\nYou can use a HTML page to load CSS, JavaScript code, images, and such static files.\nEDIT: in this week Canonical announced that Ubuntu One services will be shutdown. So in a couple of days you will no longer be able to do \"host a website\" on it.\n\nA: No, you cannot. Ubuntu One file synchronization is not a cloud server or web hosting service.\nYes, you can make individual files publicly accessible, but it is not a reliable way to host a web site.

Evidently, in earlier releases of Ubuntu, an animation add-on plugin for Compiz called Skewer could be tweaked to get a slide-in/slide-out effect for opening and closing Windows. Alas, I discovered Guake while running Quantal, and Skewer is gone from the Compiz plugin packages provided in the official repos. Guake's really nice, but the fade/expand effect just feels wrong -- is there any way to get Skewer back, or is there some other plugin that'll do what I want?\n\nA: I found a great article about this in Fedora Forum:\nhttp://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=197409\nBasically you do the following:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nsudo apt-get install compiz-fusion-plugins-extra\n\nLaunch Compiz Configuration Settings Manager (CCSM), go to the Effects section, tick the box next to Animations Add-On, then click on Animations.\nIn Animations; under Animation Selection; for the Open Animation tab; click on New, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Burn as your Open Effect\n\n*Enter 900 for Duration\n\n*Enter (type=Normal) & name=guake for Window Match\n\n*Enter fire_life=0.1, fire_particles=100, fire_size=0.1, fire_slowdown=0.1, fire_direction=1 in Options\n\n*Click on Close\nMove this item up to the second position with the Up button, then click on the first item in the Animation Selection list (which should be a catch-all Glide 2 effect with certain exemptions), click Edit and add the exemption &!(name=guake) to the end of its Window Match entry.\nRepeat this process for the Close Animation tab and you should then be all set!\nLaunch Guake and you should see it slide down from the Unity Panel at the top of the screen.\nIf like me, you find that this effect does not persist correctly over reboot and you end up with the default Burn effect (Guake appearing and disappearing in a burst of big flames) then just go back into CCSM, click on the Animations Add-On button, select Burn and set everything down to its lowest, selecting up for Fire direction. This will set the global defaults for Burn.\nI hope this helps anyone. ;)\n", "Q: /can you install ubuntu to hdd but it runs completely from ram while hdd is not spinning? my main purpose is to be able to install ubuntu to the hard disc so that my settings and everything are saved but i want it to load itself to my  ram for faster operation and better battery life while the hdd sleeps \n\nA: See: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1594694\nIt is a lengthy how-to on the forums ;)\nIt will use the hard disk (or flash drive) if you wish to save your data between boots.\n", "Q: install ubuntu on dell xps 8500 with preinstalled windows 8 I got a Dell xps 8500 pre-installed window 8. I installed ubuntu 12.10 and after reboot the system directly enter into ubuntu. I use boot-repair and I got the grub menu with ubuntu and windows 8. If I enter Ubuntu, there is no problem. But if I enter Windows 8 it is ok for the first time, but if I restart the system, I got a line \"No bootable device available!!! Press any key to retry.\" on the top of the screen.\nIn the bios I open the UEFI and secure boot.\nThis is the boot info: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1611189/.\nWhat can I do now?\n2013-02-07\nThanks Rod Smith very much for his great help. I summarize here my problem and the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Platform: Dell xps 8500, 1T hdd, pre-installed Windows 8; UEFI open, secure boot open\n\n*Problem: Install Ubuntu 12.10 (I want to use 10.04, but because only from 12.10 UEFI and secure boot is supported), everything is ok except entering Windows 8 and restart. The system will not find boot device. The reason here is a 'windows boot manager' that revise the boot file.\n\n*Solution: in Command Shell type: \"bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\" to correct the bootfile. The \"shimx64.efi\" file is under \"/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/\". (As Rod said we should choose shimx64.efi since I open secure boot option; this also can be found after using 'boot-repair' which says: \"Please do not forget to make your BIOS boot on sda1/EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi file!\"; so if your system is different check there.)\n\n*Note: as before the solution I have tried with Rod's advice to kill \"fast boot\" and \"hybrid boot\" options. I didn't test if I change back to \"fast boot\" will have problem. Anyway, this can be tested since now the system works fine.\n\n\nA: This is a bit of a shot in the dark, but my suspicion is that you're running into problems because of a Windows feature called \"fast boot\" or \"hybrid boot.\" This system basically involves a suspend-to-disk rather than a shutdown. This is known to cause problems on dual-boot systems, and IIRC, it can even corrupt the EFI System Partition (ESP), which can lead to the symptoms you report. A quick Google turned up some sites with instructions on shutting off this feature:\nhttp://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/6320-fast-startup-turn-off-windows-8-a.html\nhttp://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3152/~/disable-windows-8-fast-startup-%28hibernate-file%29\nNote that I don't have a Windows 8 installation, so I can't offer any firsthand advice about this; I'm just passing on what I've read elsewhere.\n\nEdit: If Windows is \"taking over\" the boot process, you can fix the problem by using the Windows bcdedit command:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Windows.\n\n*Launch a Command Shell prompt with Administrator privileges. (You do this by right-clicking the shell icon and selecting the option to \"Run as Administrator.\")\n\n*Type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi to register GRUB as the desired default boot program. (Note, however, that if you haven't disabled Secure Boot, you may need to specify shim.efi instead of grubx64.efi. If you're using something other than GRUB, or if it's not in the specified location, you'll need to adjust the command appropriately.) Note that {bootmgr} should be typed exactly that way, including the curly braces; that's not an attempt to denote a variable.\n\n\nThereafter, Windows should settle down and stop disabling GRUB as the default boot program.\n", "Q: Why would modinfo say a module is not found when it appears with lsmod I have noticed several cases where, if I use lsmod to find a module and then use modinfo for that module, it comes out with a ERROR: Module not found message.

If I can find the actual icons I could probably fix them. The icons in /usr/share/pixmaps don't match what I see in the tray.

I need to install Lubuntu on to a hard drive that has no other means of installation other than the hard drive itself (USB, CD, Net, none of those are available on this system). \nWhat I have already tried: I installed a LiveCD onto the HDD and it runs fine, but when I try to install to the same drive, no matter on which partition I choose (tried root, boot, and swap partition, using free space, etc.) it errors out. The errors I get are mostly about not being able to unmount the drive to install, or it being in use. This was tried on several HDD's so it isn't the drive.\nSpecifics: This laptop has no ethernet or CD drive, and only has USB1.1 of which I only have an external floppy that works with it. Also, this computer doesn't have an operating system, and only 256MB of RAM, which Lubuntu runs fine on (live anyway).\nI used RMPREPUSB because Netbootin doesn't detect my IDE laptop drive, and even tried booting the LiveCD from a DOS floppy.\n\nA: Installating to a different partition than the boot-partition, or to an unpartitioned space should be possible without issue. Make sure the partition to install is not mounted.\nNevertheless, and because you seem to be unable to use additional partitions on this hard drive, think of plugging the drive into another computer, where you have access to the Internet for installation. For safety reasons unplug any other hard drives on this computer.\nThis will not only let you install Lubuntu smoothly, but it will additionally give you the advantage of installing all updates, additional applications, or drivers you may need. \nAfter all is setup you can then plug the drive back in to your laptop.\nRelated questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to install Ubuntu without a CD and a USB?\n\n*Can I install Ubuntu on the same hard drive I booted with?\n", "Q: How to provide second monitors resolution to application? I have a dual monitor setup, with the basic TwinView settings from my Nvidia-card (550 Ti). One monitor is my primary display (1600x900) and the other is my TV (1920*1080).\nI have arranged XBMC to start up on my TV (using windowed mode, a quick and dirty GTKhack to hide the borders, and wmctrl to stretch it). This works for most games that have window mode as well (e.g. Shank2). However, I am unable to get some others working as I am unable to select the 1920x1080 resolution in their settings menu. All available resolutions for my primary display and the combined resolution are available. (e.g. Vessel, Snapshot)\nHow is it possible to provide my 1920x1080 resolution to the applications/games?\nEvery other workaround/solution is also very much appreciated!\n\nA: What you're trying to do is not possible with TwinView.\nTwinView works by adding a fake display mode with the combined resolution to the primary display. For example, if you have two 1024x768 monitors, the driver tells the OS that there is only one screen with the resolutions of the primary display and an additional, fake 2048x768 mode. When you select this mode, the OS thinks it has a single 2048x768 screen, and the driver takes care of sending portions of the image to the correct displays. This means you don't need any special support from applications, but you also e.g. can't fullscreen an application only on one of the displays - the apps will all think there is only a single 2048x768 display.\nThe solution is to disable TwinView and use a driver which has XRandR support. This is present in the Nvidia driver since version 302. Use Ubuntu's Displays panel to configure the displays through XRandR (in 12.04 and later, click on the power button in the top right and select \"Displays...\").\n\nA: At settings in Displays you select the red screen which is TwinView and change on buttom to off at the box next to your laptop screen. Then Apply a box will appear which you will need to press keep settings. Now you shut see it only on the tv and your TwinView shut come black. \n", "Q: 12.04LTS virtual kernel: no HFS/+? why?

Por favor, soy novato, este Ubuntu sería mi primera distribución Linux, ¿QUÉ HAGO?\n\nA: That's not a grub rescue prompt. It's a grub prompt. There is a difference - you have many more commands at your disposal - but it's not going to help you much, because it's a fresh install. \nUsually when Wubi users experience this it's due to filesystem corruption and you can just run chkdsk from Windows or fsck from a live CD, but in this case, it's probably a different issue preventing Grub from loading the menu (grub.cfg) from the virtual disk (root.disk). \nNot really sure what could cause this, but it happened to someone else recently - have a look here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2112111\nYou can try a few of the commands and see if your problem is the same, and if so, file a bug.\n", "Q: Installing stackless python, how to get modules?

What is goin on here?, any one else have seen this behaviour before?\n\nA: Transmission daemon re-writes the configuration file with the old options when it exits.

Also would this fix the curl issues I was having. I was just trying to install RVM by curl according to the tutorial but nothing happened. No message that it failed or succeeded. \nUpdate 2\nSo I did some research and it looks like a known bug with Ubuntu 12.10 upgrade, which I had just did before using these commands.\nDNS resolution fails after 12.10 upgrade\nI thought the above was causing the problem but it wasn't in my case\nHere is what reads inside /etc/network/interfaces\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.131\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\n\nThanks,\nJoe\n\nA: This is a name resolution error, not a ping error, per se.  Check that your DNS is configured properly (/etc/resolv.conf)\n\nA: Agreed, this is a DNS resolution error.  You can verify this by pinging facebooks actual IP:\n# ping 173.252.110.27\n# 64 bytes from 173.252.110.27: icmp_seq=0 ttl=239 time=124.665 ms\n# 64 bytes from 173.252.110.27: icmp_seq=1 ttl=239 time=83.031 ms\n\nIf pinging the IP fails, it's likely a network issue.  If it succeeds, it's likely a dns issue.\nUPDATE\nBased on new information:\nI'll assume (and if I'm wrong, I'll need to know a lot more about your setup) that you have a typical broadband internet service provider, and a typical consumer grade router that your other machines connect to just fine. If that is the case, you should comment out the last 5 lines and add this at the end:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nThen perform these commands:\n# sudo ifconfig eth0 down ; sudo ifconfig eth0 up ; sudo dhclient\n\nLet me know if anything errors out.\n\nA: You need a dns-nameservers option in the iface eth0 inet static stanza of /etc/network/interfaces. The argument of this option should be the IP address of some nameserver. After adding this option, do ifdown eth0 ; ifup eth0. \nAlso make sure that the resolvconf package is installed and that /etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link to ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf; if it isn't, run sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf.\n", "Q: How can I open my Meteor app's port to the local network I'm running a MeteorJS app on localhost:3000.

So, meetings become meengs, litigation becomes ligaon, etc. Makes for a hard read!\nNow, if I modify CSS etc. this helps one page. I can try Stylish but I don't want to (this may change later). I also prefer to have these MS C-fonts degrade gracefully, than to have to install them (especially since I've read for this I'll also have to run Windoze on my device).\nThis caused me to learn great deal about fonts in Ubuntu and in general, but I am new to topic, so if I dig under wrong tree, please point me to right one. ;-)\nTest sites: anything that uses Calibri.

I can do so using System Setting->Display, but after every reboot I should do it again.\nAn I am just wondering why there are no such options anymore, what has been changed?\n\nThank you.\n\nA: So here is the answer on my question. \nThere is no more display settings in AMD Control Center. Now all display settings are in System Setting->Display, which make sense, cause all displays settings are kept separate of the driver - they are driver-independent.\nThe problem with resetting display settings after every reboot does not connected to the absence of display settings in AMD Control Center and seems a bug, that should be posted on launchpad.com \n", "Q: On Android, can I point a file to a folder on the file system so that it syncs to Ubuntu One? I have an application that generates a file, and I'd like to have this file automatically sync to Ubuntu One. At the moment, I'm happy for it just to go in the 'Ubuntu One' folder, but being able to specify an alternate folder in my U1 account would also be cool.\nAs it stands, the only way I know how to do this is to generate the file that gets saved to some folder, then open the Ubuntu One android app, and specify to add a new file, pointing to the file that was generated. \nSince the application that generates the file allows to me to specify the path, what I want to be able to do is to point it to the 'Ubuntu One' folder so that it gets synced to my account, without needing to add that extra step.\nI've had a look in the file system and can see: /sdcard0/u1/Ubuntu\\ One, but this seems to be only to store files that you specifically select from the app. I guess the android app doesn't have a daemon watching folders to auto push new files to U1 - other than perhaps pointing it to a pictures folder, since there is that auto upload photo's option.\n\nA: Ubuntu One Files currently does not provide sync features, besides auto-upload of photos. We do have sync on the roadmap. The ETA is not close, though, as we only have one Android dev on the team.\n", "Q: How can I fix my NTFS partition after shrinking in Windows? In attempting to shrink my NTFS drive to a smaller size, so I can dual boot my currnet Windows 7 with a brand new Ubuntu 12.10 (didn't want to use Wubi), I've somehow managed to stuff up the drive and what Windows can see.\nEssentially, after shrinking it with a partition manager, Windows blue screens upon restarting.  I shrank it while Windows was running (which is valid to my surprise, according to many Windows 7 & 8 dual boot HOW-TOs), and it said to restart to finish off the process.\nOther partition managers I burnt to an ISO say it's a raw format.  Ubuntu *trumpets blare* to the rescue; the live CD said I can see your NTFS partition sure no problem.\nSO.  Here's my issue.  I'd like to recover my drive, so that Windows can boot again.  Whether I then format or not, I'd like to get Windows running so I can do things like run steam and properly back-up... run other programs that can't just be copied over.\nHow do I fix my NTFS partition from an Ubuntu Live CD?\nI've tried so far:\n\n*\n\n*ntfsfix /mount/point/31415: Runs & exits fine; have tried with all parameters\n\n*ntfs-label /mount/point/34154 NEW_LABEL: Said sure no problem.

I can't find that package either.\n\n*Windows Recovery Tools: Not only does the Windows 7 installation disk (recovery tools) not pick up that there is a Windows installation on the drive, it thinks its a raw format and can't read it.  Consequently, chkdsk doesn't work, as it can't see there's contents.\n\nHelp would be greatly appreciated!! :)  I'll update this description with clarifications as they come.\nClarification(s):\n\n*\n\n*Windows doesn't boot, but does attempt to:  I get the Windows 7 logo, and the orb things start to spirl, but then it blue screens.

I gave up on the whole thing and after buying a new external drive and backup the data, went to install Windows again fresh (still need to dual boot).  Windows STILL couldn't pick up the drive.  That's when I got suspicious.\n\n\n*\n\n*I went into gparted\n\n*Deleted the mount that I'd attempted to create in Windows\n\n*RE sized  the drive back to what it was before.\n\n*Rebooted.\n\n*Windows asked whether I wanted to recover Windows (instead of booting normally)\n\n*THIS TIME, it actually seemed to do something.\n\n*Rebooted, and all was well.\n\n\nThanks to the advice from all.  Turns out even undo'ing what you've done with partitions can sometimes fix issues.\n\nA: Try reverting back to a recent version of Windows or restoring from a backup. If neither work or you don't have either one, you can always go with re-installing Windows after backing up the data you want from the hard drive. If you need an install iso, they're (legally) online. Depending on your product key, you can use one of these links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Home Premium SP1 (64-bit)\n\n*Professional SP1 (64-bit)\n\n*Ultimate SP1     (64-bit)\n\n*Home Premium SP1 (32-bit)\n\n*Professional SP1 (32-bit)\n\n*Ultimate SP1     (32-bit)\nYou can also copy the files over from the disc (including hidden ones) then put them on a new partition and see if Windows will boot from that. You can use QEMU's kvm command to try booting from a drive. Example:\n\nkvm /dev/sda\n\nWith the kvm command, you don't list the partition with the drive; it's also best to have the drive unmounted although it may not matter.\n", "Q: How to lower the HDD temperature I have 4 hard disk drives that have temperatures which go beyond the recommended 50 degrees (Celsius). (I have several Samsung Spinpoint F3 which are 1Tb each and they do have good temps, between 32 and 35 degrees. That's normal for me. But in this case, 50+ is not normal.)\nI have already read the question and answer provided here, but none of the solutions  helped. What tools can I use or what terminal commands should I execute to lower the temperature of these drives?\nAnd on a similar note, if I were to use a method similar to this one, how would I know which hard drive I am reading?   Where can I check to see which HDD is related to, for example, /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy ?\nI have already tested powertop, hddtemp, disks and others to check and try to lower the temp with no luck.\n\nA: maybe you can try hdparm -S180 /dev/sda - to put HDD idle (low-power) mode after 15 min idle time\n\nA: There are two ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the drive to sleep, for example, with hdparm -y\n\n*Add more fans blowing cool air across the drive.\n\n\n\nA: Well found a way to lower the hard drive temperature, had to stay up all night.\n(Gave a +1 to Ringtail's comment ;) )\nOpen Dash and type disks. You will see the Disks Utility pop up. Open it.\n\nNow select the Hard Drive you wish to work with and then, in the green circle above, there is a button, click on it and select Drive Settings...\n\nDepending on the hard drive you will get more settings or less settings. In this case I got Standby Timeout and Automatic Acoustic Management. So I changed the Acoustic from the Default to the lowest one which is 128 (As seen in the image above). \nThe temperature did not change for at least 2 to 3 minutes, but then it suddenly lowered itself by 1 degree. I then waited 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and the more I waited, the lower it went. It literally went from 53 degrees to 39 degrees. That's 14 degrees lower than the one I was used to.\nI then added, just for a bonus the Standby Timeout, cause I was actually not going to use the hard drive all the time, basically only about 50% of the time I was on the computer. That lowered the temperature 2 to 3 degrees more. He is an image of hddtemp:\n\nSo hey, did not know Disks had this feature. The curious part is this. After searching a lot for this, I came to know that many HDDs do not have Automatic Acoustic Management (AAM), mainly because of lawsuits and patents (Go figure). But one of this is the same one I have, a Seagate Barracuda which has been mentioned to not have AAM support. So I wonder how did this option help the drive if it was not supported in this case.\nAnother helpful hint was found in this link which also helped.\nThey mention there the use of powertop, terminal commands and kernel options. It covers a lot, but the ones I took and used were:\nSata Power Management\nThis are mentioned in relation to the /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy line I was asking about. It just so happens the host0 part depends on which Sata motherboard connection you connected the hard drive to. For laptops, most of the time is host0. In my case with 6 sata connections I get host0 through host6. should be noted that this features will work on a newer kernel (At least 2.6.x an above, but since we are all into the 3.x then it does not matter), have an Intel AHCI compatible chipset and use a SATA drive. If you meet all of this requirements then you can use the line above in the following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*First check if you are using that host at Maximum Performance:\nsudo cat /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy\n\n*if it says max_performance then do the following:\necho min_power > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy\nRepeat for any other HDD that has that problem (Need to double check which HDD is connected in what SATA port to know which host it is). I also do not recommend using this on an SSD because... why?.. What heat can a SSD make.. none.\nThis is not permanent since when you reboot you will have to do it again. You can added in some runtime file to make sure it is always activated.\nNota that adding the Standby Timeout will make your HDD take a little bit longer to mount if in standby. Also lowering the AAM a lot will lower the speed of Read/Writes by a little bit. This depends if is worth it or not. In my case it is, to lower the temperature of it.\nUPDATE: After about 12 hours of testing, the HDD is normal again. In standby it stays between 33 and 35 degrees. When in use it goes to 39 degrees max. Still, it is 10 degrees less than what it had when not in used and almost 15 when it was in used. Am really happy and relief about it. Also this is without the air conditioning unit turned on. Simply on normal room temperature.\nUPDATE: With air conditioning on, the HDD is finally able to get to 30 degrees. Before it simply stayed in the 50+ range. An image of how happy I am:\n\nUPDATE: With exactly a month of testing I can say that the temperature has stayed under 30. Right now am in 26 degrees which is very good (50% less than the \"normal\" temperature it had before).\n\nA: A hard drive does not produce that much heat, even under load - in this article the worst-performing models consumed under 10 watts when under load, and for \"green\" models the power consumption was below a watt when idle. So it is likely your four drives produce twice less heat than your CPU, even if you using your machine to do I/O intensive tasks for extensive periods.\nHaving said that, some time ago I used to have a system in which drives ran very hot (and failed regularly). When investigating, I found some articles which noted that a poor power supply may cause this - something along the lines \"an overload on +12V line may cause the voltage on the +5V line to increase, which results in hard drives overheating\" - or, maybe it was the 5V lines which was overloading, I don't remember.\nAlso note that cheap power supplies may have wide variations in voltage even without being overloaded.\nNow I have some of the same old hard drives in another system and they're quite cool.\nSorry the answer does not include a nifty command to fix the problem :)\n", "Q: Chrome suddenly using too much memory, what's wrong?

Furthermore the script should not stall the log off process until the entire script is executed (something that will never happen).\nHow can I achieve these two goals?\nI know the script isn't that accurate with time (since the stuff itself will take some seconds, after a while, the loop will not be executed each 30 minutes), but that doesn't matter that much.\n\nA: Check this post to see how to run a script at startup (after you are login in GUI).\nRelating to the second part of request, I don't think that you will find an easy way to prevent the log off process.

What else can I try?\n[Edit: I had another shot at installing the Ralink/MediaTek driver and now I have a new network interface:\n$ lsmod | grep rt3\nrt3290sta            1174375  1\n$ iwconfig \nusb0      no wireless extensions.\nra0       Ralink STA  \neth0      no wireless extensions.\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n$ sudo ifconfig ra0 up\n$ iwconfig \nusb0      no wireless extensions.\nra0       Ralink STA  ESSID:\"\"  Nickname:\"RT3290STA\"\n          Mode:Auto  Frequency=2.412 GHz  Access Point: Not-Associated   \n          Bit Rate:1 Mb/s   \n          RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Link Quality=10/100  Signal level:0 dBm  Noise level:0 dBm\n          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0\neth0      no wireless extensions.\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\nThe problem is that I now get bluetooth and wifi both showing as hard blocked in rfkill and the new wireless section of the network manager indicator has the \"wireless is disabled by a hardware switch\" message. The only hardware switch is the f12 button which has always has a red light (wireless radio disabled) under ubuntu even though rfkill previously showed it as unblocked and rfkill event doesn't react to pressing the button. I made no BIOS changes since posting this question and there is still no Windows OS installed on the hard drive. \nI'm also not sure about how to automatically handle the ifconfig step above. ]\nGraphics\nCard: NVIDIA GeForce GT 635M\nEdit: Working fine with bumblebee.\nFingerprint reader\nDevice: Validity ??? (ID 138a:0018)\nEdit: Found a bug report for FPrint tracking support for this device. Marked as Fix Released but no version of that library I found in PPAs detected the device.\n\nA: I later discovered this bug report. Following the suggestions there, I enabled the network card in the BIOS then was able to toggle the hardware switch while the hp_wmi module was disabled. This allowed me to connect to my wireless router, but attempting to use the connection causes a kernel panic as with the bug reported linked here.\nPending the resolution of that bug, I'm using the suggested workaround.

Although it has a gpl'd kernel module (which I was unable to build on debian wheezy), it seems to require running a binary from your startup scripts (more than the usual firmware blob).\n\nA: I have an HP Envy dv6-7375ez laptop running dual boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.04.03. The laptop comes with a Ralink 3290 wireless card. In Windows, it works fine. Airplane mode is switched on and off with the F12 key.\nTo get wireless to work at all in Linux, I had to upgrade the kernel to 3.6.11-030611-generic. Some people reported having problems getting this driver to work in 12.10, but I wanted to stay with 12.04 LTS anyway, so I upgraded the kernel. Details are here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1049466/ (see comment #16).\nYou can then follow the instructions in this link to download, build and install the driver: Wireless driver - how to load manufacturer's STA file (Ralink 3290). I was able to get wireles to work if no ethernet (wired) connection was present. However, Bluetooth and wireless WLAN seemed always either both enabled or both disabled. Turning one off or on would do the same to the other. Sinde I really don't care about Bluetooth and would rather have it off all the time, this was less than satisfactory.\nAfter that, I updated the BIOS in a Windows Update session, and then I was always getting the \"Wireless network disabled by hardware switch\" even though I had run \"sudo rfkill unblock all\". Blacklisting the HP driver finally did the trick (see what it is called by doing \"sudo lsmod | grep hp\" ... on my system it is \"hp_wmi\").\nI can now even turn wireles on or off using the F12 key. However, the indicator light is always the same, and after you hit F12 it takes a few seconds to toggle (i.e. enable/disable) the wireless, so check the network menu in the status bar to see what it is at the moment. I can live with this for now.\n", "Q: Broken count error : linux-generic-pae : Depends: linux-image-generic-pae (= 3.2.0.37.44) but 3.2.0.37.45 is installed I am getting a broken count in synaptic and unable to fix it by running:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nFollowing is the extract from the terminal:\n$ sudo apt-get check\nReading package lists...

When I compile it using etterfilter and run:\nsudo ettercap -F /tmp/filter.ef -T -M arp -i wlan1 /192.168.1.6/ //\nthe msg is not printed. With the packet visualization I do see TCP packets, but the filter seem to just not working even though ettercap says \"Content filters loaded from /tmp/filter.ef\".\nTo solve this I've tried enabling ip_forward, and I've tried deleting the \"#\" sign in /etc/etter.conf so it will use iptables for it's redir_command (lines 168-169)\nDo you know how to make filtering work?\nI'm using ettercap NG-0.7.4.2 on Ubuntu 12.10\n\nA: Finally found the answer.\nThe problem is because of a bug in ettercap!\nFrom the man page:\nYou can also load a script  without enabling it by appending :0 to the filename\n\nAnd from the code:\n/* enable a loaded filter script? */\nuint8_t f_enabled = 0;\n/* is there a :0 or :1 appended to the filename? */\nif ( (opt_end-optarg >=2) && *(opt_end-2) == ':' ) {\n        *(opt_end-2) = '\\0';\n        f_enabled = !( *(opt_end-1) == '0' );\n}\n\nAs you can see from the code, and as opposed to what the man page says, you must append \":1\" to the filter's file name in order for it to be loaded. Otherwise, the filter is not used.\nSo why it inly happned to me?\nThat is beacuse I'm using version 0.7.4.2, which is the version downloaded when I apt-get install ettercap on my Ubuntu.

No matter if it actually contains anything that could be executed or not.\nYou can set Nautilus to always open files instead of executing them. To do that just open a file manager window, go to Edit->Preferences, and on the Behavior-tab set it to \"View Executable files when they are opened\"\nAlso try to change permissions in terminal using chmod -x (and if you have no permissions ro change permissions sudo chmod -x), something like sudo chmod -x file.tex (here r are saying that file.tex is not executable).\n\nA: There are mainly two reason\n\n\n*\n\n*File system is Read only\n\n*Not supported FS (like Windows ntfs,fat etc)\n\n", "Q: Errors were encountered while processing: cinnamon nemo nemo-fileroller I am getting  the following error\n\n\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n    cinnamon\n    nemo\n    nemo-fileroller\n\n\nWhen I run sudo apt-get install <anything>.

As such I have created multiple identities. The mail server which I use will only allow me to use my email on its domain, so it is important that is used as the From: in all emails. The default seems to be that Thunderbird finds which identity is used in the original email and use that as the identity. I know I can select the correct one by hitting the pull down at the top next to the From: but I would like to always have it use the default identity so I do not have to deal with this. Is there a way to do this?\nNote: I have thought about just having the one identity, but then when I Reply All it gets sent to my other email accounts which I do not want it to do.\n(B) Suggest an add-on to format response header in particular way\nI would like me response header to largely emulate the default Forward header. My goal is something like:\nFrom: FromName1\nSent: Date-With-Timestamp\nTo: ToName1 ,..., ToNameN\nCc: CcName1 ,..., CcNameN\nSubject: Subject\n\nI have been using SmartTemplate 4 which comes very close to doing this, but it is unable to interweave the names and emails (instead if there are multiple To/From individuals, all names and then all emails are listed; the author confirms it is not possible to interweave the names and emails). Is there another add-on which will do this?\nNote that in the Ask Ubuntu Question I linked to at the top there was a nice suggestion to have email addresses listed as html links which would be great, but the SmartTemplate code there does not work well with multiple addresses (all the emails are combined in one link: yuck!)\n\nA: (A) Always use the same identity when responding\nI think that the only way to do this is with add-ons. There is a way to set a default outgoing account, but this default is overridden depending on the current folder selected.\nAn alternative is to use the Virtual Identity add-on. This is probably overkill, and I'm not sure if there is a slimmer alternative. I don't know how I'd set it up exactly, but you might be able to set up a wildcard \"to:\" address, and specify an associated default \"from:\" address. But I'm not sure.\n(B) Suggest an add-on to format response header in particular way\nThe \"Change quote and reply format\" add-on may do what you want. If not, there are also additional functions as stated on the linked page.\nAgain, I'm not 100% sure if this will help, but I thought it better to give you some possible leads.\n\nA: For (A):\n\n\n*\n\n*I advise you to redirect the mailbox to the other identity (the one you want to use for the answer). It might be convenient to create a rule to put the mail with \"From or Cc\" to your other identity in a different directory. One mailbox, one identity.\n\n*if this is just a problem of SMTP, you can also use the SMTP server relative to the other identity.\n\n", "Q: How can I make Pidgin a single-window application?

There have been no package updates for the DNS bind9 recently but there are plenty of vulnerabilities. Can someone please assist with a \"How-To\" for a manual installation of the latest stable release of Bind9 from ISC?\n\nA: The bind9 package is in main, which means that Canonical are committed to providing security updates for it until the end-of-life of any particular release. Note that security updates are generally backported, so you won't necessarily be able to tell what updates are included from just the version number. Instead, you should check the changelog or search for the CVE that concerns you using Launchpad's CVE search feature.\nUsers who care about keeping their versions up-to-date should stay updated via the official security updates.\nBuilding the package from source will work, but you will need to watch upstream security notices and keep up-to-date yourself.

I have no other os installed. I have tried to install windows xp using bootable cd of XP. But it doesn't work. Blank screen appears. How can I remove ubuntu then? I have tried many ways using gparted and all but no result.\n\nA: 3 possible methods for removing an operating system from your hard disc (so it does not even have to be Ubuntu):\n\n*\n\n*You can remove the current OS from your hard disc by using the Live CD you used to create the installation. It will have gParted installed and loaded into memory and all you need to do it delete the partitions gparted shows you. Mind you: you can only delete unmounted partitions. And not all operating systems will have a live CD.\n\n\n*You can also use the gParted Live cd that you can find here. You need to burn this though. So if you can not access your current OS you might need a 2nd computer to burn the disc.\n\n\n*You can also use another OS installation media to format your disc. All operating systems installation disc will have some sort of partition manager. Windows starts with it when you boot from the installation CD. Linux flavors tend to ask for some information 1st (like language settings etc) before you see the partition manager.\n\nIf you decide to stick to gParted then this link explains how to do that. Copy/paste from that link:\n\nDeleting a Partition\nTo delete a partition:\n\n*\n\n*Select an unmounted partition. See the section called “Selecting a Partition”.\n\n\n*Choose: Partition → Delete.

I have 2 hard disks, one SSD and another HDD. Windows was installed in the HDD, and I wanted ubuntu on my SSD. I chose to have boot files in the SSD where I had installed ubuntu. Initially after the installation it didn't show the dual boot option and directly booted to ubuntu. But after going through some suggestions I used boot-repair and got GRUB repaired/installed. But when I restarted again in the boot options I didn't find the Windows 7 option. I fear that I have accidentally deleted the windows boot files. This is the link I got after boot-repair:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/1615740/\n\nA: Looking at it a bit more, I suspect that running the following command in the Windows 7 installation CD repair console will allow os-prober to find your windows installation.\nbootrec /fixboot\n\nAfter running the command. Reboot, you will most likely still only boot into Ubuntu. So then rerun the boot-repair script. If you've got any trouble please submit the new pastebin.\n\nA: You can try rebooting after manually modifying your grub menu very, very carefully by opening Terminal and entering sudo gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg, and inserting the following text at the end of the /etc/grub.d/40_custom section, immediately above the last line containing \"END /etc/grub.d/40_custom\":\nmenuentry 'Windows 7' --class windows --class os $menuentry_id_option 'osprober-chain-9E8A1E4F8A1E2475' {\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ntfs\nset root='hd1,msdos2'\nif [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\nsearch --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd1,msdos2 --hint-efi=hd1,msdos2 --hint-baremetal=ahci1,msdos2 9E8A1E4F8A1E2475\nelse\nsearch --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 9E8A1E4F8A1E2475\nfi\nchainloader +1\n}\n\nIf this works, you can make this menu entry permanent by performing the same insertion on the file \"/etc/grub.d/40_custom\" with this Terminal command: sudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom\nThis might serve as a workaround if this is because your Ubuntu/Grub somehow cannot detect Windows.\n", "Q: Games stuttering about every 7 minutes Whenever I play a game on my Linux machine, it stutters every 7 minutes or so for about 5 seconds. Seems like not a serious problem but it is still a bit annoying. So any ideas on how to even trace the cause of that bug and then maybe try to fix it too.\nI have Ubuntu 12.10 installed on my Acer aspire 5552g which has a:\n\n*\n\n*AMD 2.20 GHz proccessor\n\n*Radeon HD 5650 with the latest AMD proprietary drivers.\n\n*4 GB of RAM\n\n*DE: Gnome 3\n\nUpdates:\n\n*\n\n*I took a look at the CPU usage chart while the stutter occurred and it showed that one core (dual core) went up to 100% while this happened and the other one stayed like it was.

Maybe it helps a bit.\n\n\nAs it can be seen, when stutter occurs, Xorg is taking up a lot of processing power from one core. This time it was only 12.6% but the nastier ones take up to 37% which causes a real lock-down for a couple of seconds.\nAlso I wonder if this is Xorg making the error, should I not look at Xorg logs? But which one should I be monitoring as there are so many of them. Also when I tried to monitor Xorg.3.log it did not show any timestamps for it's errors so it might be hard to read stuff from there I guess.\n\nA: If you don't have your AMD Graphics Drivers installed, you can download them here\nIf that doesn't work, try uninstalling and reinstalling xorg using\nsudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg\n\nthen\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg\n\nA: It might just be a game error (or bug).

I want to install new KDE 4.10 on Ubuntu 12.04.\nCan I install it from any repository and without kubuntu-desktop package? I want clean, fresh KDE without Kubuntu modifications.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I came across this question from google asking how can I update KDE on (k)Ubuntu 12.04 without updating the server parts of the system.\nSo, I have Kubuntu 12.04.01 LTE, and there was KDE 4.8.5 installed (along Unity and a few others DMs)\nI did \nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports -y\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n.. and now I have same system with KDE 4.10 running on it without much problem so far.\nSince the backports are from Kubuntu team, that does include kubuntu-desktop (in your situation it might be a better choice to first install kubuntu-desktop, then update from backports, and then remove extras you don't like too much).\nOther option might be looking at http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build \n\nA: You can do this by doing the following:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports -y\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install kde-standard\n\nDon't worry about the \"kubuntu\" in the PPA name. If you install the kde-standard package, it won't include Kubuntu's customizations.\n", "Q: Configuring mongo DB to work with NTFS drive I have 120 GB SSD Drive with two partitions (NTFS with Windows and ext4 with Ubintu) and 2TB NTFS HDD shared between Windows and Ubuntu.\nI configured my HDD to be properly mounted on system boot:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\nUUID=B400515500512022 /media/B400515500512022 ntfs-3g auto,users,uid=1000,gid=1001,fmask=113,dmask=002,utf8 0 0\n\nI also created special group (gid=1001) to handle permissions and added mongodb user to it:\nntfsdrive:x:1001:leonid,mongodb\n\nSo, now ntfsdrive group have proper permissions (rw for files and rwx for directories) for the whole drive, including mongodb folder:\ndrwxrwxr-x 1 leonid ntfsdrive       4096 Feb  6 12:51 mongodb\n\nBut mongodb still refuses to run on this drive:\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] MongoDB starting : pid=7480 port=27017 dbpath=/media/B400515500512022/mongodb 64-bit host=ubuntu\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] db version v2.2.3, pdfile version 4.5\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] git version: f570771a5d8a3846eb7586eaffcf4c2f4a96bf08\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] build info: Linux ip-10-2-29-40 2.6.21.7-2.ec2.v1.2.fc8xen #1 SMP Fri Nov 20 17:48:28 EST 2009 x86_64 BOOST_LIB_VERSION=1_49\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] options: { config: \"/etc/mongodb.conf\", dbpath: \"/media/B400515500512022/mongodb\", logappend: \"true\", logpath: \"/var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log\" }\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] journal dir=/media/B400515500512022/mongodb/journal\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] recover : no journal files present, no recovery needed\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] info preallocateIsFaster couldn't run due to: couldn't open file /media/B400515500512022/mongodb/journal/tempLatencyTest for writing errno:1 Operation not permitted; returning false\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] exception in initAndListen: 13516 couldn't open file /media/B400515500512022/mongodb/journal/j._0 for writing errno:1 Operation not permitted, terminating\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 dbexit: \nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] shutdown: going to close listening sockets...\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] shutdown: going to flush diaglog...\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] shutdown: going to close sockets...\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] shutdown: waiting for fs preallocator...\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] shutdown: lock for final commit...\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] shutdown: final commit...\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] shutdown: closing all files...\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] closeAllFiles() finished\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] journalCleanup...\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] removeJournalFiles\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 [initandlisten] shutdown: removing fs lock...\nWed Feb  6 12:51:31 dbexit: really exiting now\n\nI have no problems running mongodb with the same configuration (including mongodb folder permissions) on my ext4 drive.\nIs there a way to solve this problem, or my only option is to add ext4 partition to my HDD drive?\n\nA: Having replicated this myself, it appears that using the mount options you specify allows the mongodb user to write to the NTFS volume, but there is something specific that MongoDB is trying to do with the files that is not permitted by these options; perhaps it cannot set the umask or ownership on its files exactly how it wants to.\nThe solution is to use the permissions option when mounting the NTFS volume rather than specifying the owner explicitly. See the ntfs-3g man page for further details.\nSo /etc/fstab would look like this:\nUUID=B400515500512022 /media/B400515500512022 ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.UTF-8,permissions 0 0\n\nOn a fresh NTFS volume mounted at /media/B400515500512022, you can then run:\nsudo mkdir /media/B400515500512022/mongodb\nsudo chown mongodb:mongodb /media/B400515500512022/mongodb\n\nbefore running:\nsudo -u mongodb mongod --dbpath /media/B400515500512022/mongodb\n\nYou may wish to check that this does not cause problems when accessing the files from Windows.\n\nA: As a temporary solution I reconfigured mongodb upstart script. I configured it to run mongodb using my own user instead of mongodb user.\nTo do so I changed the following line in the /etc/init/mongodb.conf file:\nif [ \"x$ENABLE_MONGODB\" = \"xyes\" ]; then exec start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --chuid mongodb --exec  /usr/bin/mongod -- --config /etc/mongodb.conf; fi\n\nBoth --chuid mongodb:ntfsdrive and --chuid leonid options resulted in the same error, so I completely removed --chuid option from it:\nif [ \"x$ENABLE_MONGODB\" = \"xyes\" ]; then exec start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --exec  /usr/bin/mongod -- --config /etc/mongodb.conf; fi\n\nRunning mongodb using my own user isn't a good solution, so I  think I'll partition my HDD drive to prevent similar problems.\n", "Q: How to reset network manager I'm using Mobile Broadband using a nokia mobile to connect to Internet. All I did in my Ubuntu 12.10 is add 'new mobile broadband' (in terms of networking, no other tweaks).\nProblem:\nYesterday i just test connected a micromax mobile (Not deteced by nm). After that i can't connect to internet using my nokia mobile. This is first in my experience (Connecting a phone make the network manager to not detect other one). lsusb and ifconfig -a show my phone without any problem. Then I connected the nokia to a live system, everything is OK until i connect the Micromax phone. (just phically. nm not even detected the micromax).After that no detection by nm.\nI think reseting network manager will fix the problem.\n\nA: You can restart network-manager by doing (in the terminal):\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nCertainly I find this can help with some network hardware issues (network-manager seems not to properly detect when my wifi is turned back on with an external switch, for instance), whether it will help here you will have to find out.\n\nA: In addition to @chronitis, if your machine faces this problem more often, then you can create an alias in your UNIX based machine like reset-wifi. This will save your good mood and time.\n$ echo \"alias reset-wifi='sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart'\" >> ~/.bash_aliases\n\n\nThis works for my machine: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

After booting Ubuntu from pen drive, it automatically reboots every time when I boot it from the pen drive.\nIt dont give me any chance to install it.\nI don't know why it is happening? Please help me\n\nA: I think I know what you're talking about. I'm having a problem installing it as well... I installed it from windows (I'm using a flash drive as well) And it told me to restart. I restarted and was prompted with a screen that says something along the lines of \"file missing in c:/ubuntu/winboot/...\". It tells me to hit emter to go to the next screen where it prompts me with an OS selection screen. If I choose Ubuntu, it restarts again, and if I choose Windows 8 then it continues as normal.\n\nA: If it is one of the newer Samsung notebooks (I assume you have Windows 8 preinstalled), it comes with UEFI enabled. And AFAIK, disabling UEFI to enable CMS emulation makes it impossible to boot from a pendrive, at least that is what I experienced.\nMy advice is to disable UEFI and try to install Ubuntu from a DVD. For learning how to disable UEFI, you can check the tutorial on this link: Disable UEFI on Windows 8\nThere is also another alternative that I have not had the chance to test more than once yet. Without going through the hassle of disabling UEFI from Windows 8 interface, you can try to press F2 \"as soon as\" you power up the laptop.

Please keep in mind that I'm very new to Ubuntu.\n\nA: conio.h is a library that is windows specific. To my knowledge it comes with mingw32, a compiler that is a windows port of gcc. Try to set up your code so that it doesn't use it.\nAlso, note that linux uses (99% of the time) the gnu standard library (gnulibc). You can find its content here\n\nFor input/output you'd need the iostream (not iostream.h) header file. You can look at a more elaborate and complete list here.\n\nA: conio.h is turbo c++ specific header file, it is not a standard c++ header file\nusage #include<headerfile.h> is no longer supported in c++, It is replaced by #include<headerfile>\nEg: use #include<iostream> instead of #include<iostream.h>\nYou can run turbo c++ in linux using dosbox, But it is highly discouraged, Always use standard syntax while learning a programming language\n\nA: The <iostream.h> header is old and deprecated.  Instead you should use <iostream> which is the new header. If you still get an error about your header file then check your include directories.

But when I set network type to NAT the network adresses are different, 10.0.3.15 and 10.0.4.15.\nEven when I change the range, one of them to another one statically in Ubunutu I can not ping another one.\nI could not find any solution over the Internet!\n\nA: NAT mode will not let you do that. In this mode:\n\nThe \"router\", in this case, is the VirtualBox networking engine,\n  which maps traffic from and to the virtual machine transparently. In\n  VirtualBox this router is placed between each virtual machine and the\n  host. This separation maximizes security since by default virtual\n  machines cannot talk to each other.\n\nNote there's an isolation between each virtual machine, so they will be unable to connect to each other.\nWhat you need is to configure your virtual machines (go to settings, network, look at the network modes) to use either internal networking or host-only networking.\nInternal networking will allow virtual machines to communicate only with other virtual machines. Host-only networking will also allow VMs to communicate with the host system.\nRead here about what each mode does and how to configure them:\nhttp://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html\n\n\n*\n\n*configure both your virtual machines' networks to be \"Internal network\". Select \"eth0\" for \"attached to\" (this means the VM's network interface that will be connected to this network) and select the same  \"name\" for the network (think of each name as a \"hub\" to which virtual machines are connected). The default of intnet is fine.\n\n*Boot your VMS, and manually assign IP addresses. I tried with 10.0.0.1 for one and 10.0.0.2 for the other.\n\n*You should be able to ping 10.0.0.1 from 10.0.0.2. It works for me!\n\n\nA: As of VirtualBox 4.3, a new mode called \"NAT Network\" is supported.  To enable this, go to \"VirtualBox preferences -> Network\".  Under \"NAT Networks\", create a new network.  Then, on each guest, go to \"Preferences -> Network\".  Under \"Attached to:\" select \"NAT Network\" and under \"Name:\" select the network you created earlier.  Now you have one NIC that can reach the outside world and other guest on the same NAT network.  Configuring static IPs worked with no problem for me but the NAT Network mode also supports DHCP.  My configuration (using defaults) was Default Gateway = 10.0.2.1, Mask = 255.255.255.0, and IP(s) 10.0.2.15/10.0.2.16.

Does this mean if I try to add content to one of the nonroot directories, it should work but if I try to add to the root, it won't work? I was expecting that 100 percent usage would be the total of ALL the directories added up, but as the example below shows, that's not the case:\n$ df -h\nFilesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/mapper/eubuntu10x32-root\n                      3.5G  3.3G     0 100% /\nnone                  1.5G  180K  1.5G   1% /dev\nnone                  1.5G     0  1.5G   0% /dev/shm\nnone                  1.5G   40K  1.5G   1% /var/run\nnone                  1.5G     0  1.5G   0% /var/lock\nnone                  1.5G     0  1.5G   0% /lib/init/rw\nnone                  3.5G  3.3G     0 100% /var/lib/ureadahead/debugfs\n/dev/sdb               50G   27G   21G  57% /home\n/dev/sda1             228M   35M  181M  17% /boot\n\nThanks for some explanation of disc usage on filesystem.\n\nA: As df shows, /dev/mapper/eubuntu10x32-root is mounted on / (the root of your file system).\nThe other \"folders\" that df shows are not really folders but also what is called \"mount point\". \nFor instance, \n\n\n*\n\n*the real partition /dev/mapper/eubuntu10x32-root mounted on / is full.\n\n*the real partition /dev/sdb mounted on /home is not full (57%). \nThe thing is that you can't access these disk partitions directly. So partitions have to be mounted on some mount points (folders). For example, the /home folder is called a mount point for /dev/sdb since the physical disk is \"linked\" to this folder. \nThis means that when you write something into /home, your data are actually written to /dev/sdb, not /dev/mapper/eubuntu10x32-root. 3.5G is small for a root partition and you lack space on it but you can still write in your home directory because there are 21G available in it. \n\nA: Linux works a bit differently then windows. You have a \"root filesystem\", and that is the disk you have mounted (pointed towards) the directory called /. But other discs, like for instance your your /home disc can be there. Where in windows they would be for instance c:\\ and d:\\ , you end up with them in \"subdirectories\" in linux, called \"mountpoints\".\nSo while the disc that you use as / might be full, if you mount an empty terabyte disc as /home it will be that: empty.\nThis also means that if you have enough space on /home you cannot add a file to /otherdir: that gets added to an actual subdir on the / partition!\n\nA: File systems and mount points\nYou're missing out on a very important way Ubuntu/Linux handles file systems: all comes down to the same root (/) and other file systems (\"volumes\", \"disks\", \"partitions\") will be mounted on a location inside the root.\nTo explain two most interesting lines:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your / is full:\n/dev/mapper/eubuntu10x32-root   3.5G  3.3G     0 100% /\n\nHere you see a \"device mapper\" meta-device being used for your root filesystem. I think you're using LVM here or encryption.\n3.5GiB for a / is a very low capacity for a desktop installation, unless you have directories like /usr, /var moved out of it. In your case it's clearly not sufficient.\n\n*Your second disk (sdb, without partitions) is mounted at /home and a partition of sda is mounted as /boot:\n/dev/sdb               50G   27G   21G  57% /home\n/dev/sda1             228M   35M  181M  17% /boot\n\nThis separated /boot is common for a LVM/encrypted installation to allow the bootloader (Grub) to load the relevant software/drivers to be able to reach your other file systems to actually boot the operating system.\nSo, basically, your /home and /boot aren't just directories. They are directories on the / file system, but there's another file system mounted on top of it. This means that whenever you descend into it, you're looking into a different file system. Each file system has its own capacity, listed by df.\nWhile you moved out /home and /boot, this wasn't enough to have sufficient space available on /. Solutions: grow the / file system, move out more like /usr or /var to another file system.\nAre all directories under / mount points?\nDirectories not being a mount point are actual regular directories part of file system in mounted as /. There are also special ones, which don't actually represent data on disks, but in UNIX/Linux, everything is represented as files such as sockets, kernel interfaces (/proc, /sys), etc. and even directories itself are files.\nHow does this compare to Windows?\nWindows tends to hide the difference between the devices/partitions and the actual file system being mounted. This means that a C: \"drive\" can also be mounted as such.

Specifically, Unity 2D replaces the panel, launcher and places components as defined in Unity's architecture overview. Moreover it does not enforce the use of Compiz as a window manager but instead uses a slightly tweaked version of Metacity.\nNote: on some old hardware the normal (3D) Unity is not an option and Unity 2D is offered instead.\nFor more details see here Unity2D\nIf you want the Unity desktop log out then at the login screen click the circular icon next to you name and the password box.

Hard to get an excerpt with only relevant information from it, so to summarize by example:\n\n\n*\n\n*/tcp just makes the rule only match TCP. Removing that will match all traffic, including UDP and possibly other future protocols with port numbers.\n\n*Ranges are indeed specified as you described. 6667:7000 matches all ports from 6667 up to and including 7000.\n\n*Multiple ranges or individual ones can be separated by commas, e.g. 6667,6669:7000 will be the same as above, but excluding 6668.\n\n\nWikipedia on IRC mentions this as the protocol/ports required to use it:\n\nIRC was originally a plain text protocol (although later extended),\n  which on request was assigned port 194/TCP by IANA. However, the\n  de facto standard has always been to run IRC on 6667/TCP and\n  nearby port numbers (for example TCP ports 6660–6669, 7000) to\n  avoid having to run the IRCd software with root privileges.\n\nSo, this should do the trick for most common outgoing IRC connections:\nsudo ufw allow out 6660:7000/tcp\n\nAnd look for documentation on the IRC server you're connecting to if available. For example FreeNode:\n\nAll freenode servers listen on ports 6665, 6666, 6667, 6697 (SSL only), 7000 (SSL only), 7070 (SSL only), 8000, 8001 and 8002.\n\n\nA: I'm not proficient with Xchat, but I found that the following was sufficient-\nsudo ufw allow out ircd\n\nI think it does same effect as sudo ufw allow out 6667.\n", "Q: How do I change the theme of the Arduino IDE?

Tasksel or plain Apt?\nIn the past I've always used tasksel to install so-called \"tasks\". It seems, however, that this has been integrated in APT:\napt-cache dumpavail | grep ^Task\n[...] snip\nTask: lamp-server\n[...]\n\nand that I can install such \"tasks\" by appending a caret (^) to it, like this:\nsudo apt-get install lamp-server^\n\nIs this equivalent to the following?\nsudo tasksel install lamp-server\n\nAnd which is preferred?\nMetapackages\nAdditionally, how do metapackages come into play here?

If it exists execute this script.\nConclusion\ntasksel is more powerful in processing and selecting tasks. It can execute extra scripts before/after installation/removal of tasks. And the biggest benefit: You can modify tasks and create new ones very easily. It is not possible to edit an official package list file without drawbacks (valid signature).\nBack to your first question:\nIn your special case both commands are almost equivalent (supposed you have enabled both APT::Install-Recommends and APT::Get::AutomaticRemove). Only difference is the extended package state of mysql-server and apache2 dependencies (set to \"manually installed\" with plain apt-get).\nAnd what about metapackages?\nIf you don't make use of tasksel's features like selecting tasks (especially helpful at installation) and executing extra commands before and after some task blocks then a task is very similar to a metapackage. The difference is: A task is not registered as a package in APT cache.\nSo if you uninstall one task-dependency other task-deps aren't marked as auto-installed because they were explicitely installed. If you uninstall a metapackage the dependencies are removed with autoremove because their extended package state is \"auto installed\" (if not installed manually).\nNote: All distributed tasks in Debian install a metapackage named task-TASKNAME.\nGiving your example:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\n*\n\n*Will install the metapackage kubuntu-desktop. Dependencies are \"auto installed\".\n\n\n*sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop^\n\n*\n\n*Will select all packages tagged with task \"kubuntu-desktop\". That are all dependencies of metapackage kubuntu-desktop.

I want to guide the user by pointing out mistakes if any. I have attached a sample glade interface below. Here the user is supposed to enter a valid station name in the GtkEntry field. I want to highlight this field with red color (for instance) if he presses the submit button.\n\nHow do I achieve this in GTK3 with Python?\n\nA: First, you will need the Color class from Gdk and the Gtk class:\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\nfrom gi.repository.Gdk import Color\n\nThen, in your handler, change the foreground color of the text field:\nCOLOR_INVALID = Color(50000, 0, 0) // A dark red color\ntext_field.modify_fg(Gtk.StateFlags.NORMAL, COLOR_INVALID)\n\nIf you want to change the color back to the default when the text field is modified, put this in the change handler:\ntext_field.modify_fg(Gtk.StateFlags.NORMAL, None)\n\nThe RBG values for the Color class are in a range from 0-65535.\nFor more information, see the PyGTK documentation, specifically the Widget and Color classes.\n", "Q: gem install error: \"cannot load such file -- zlib\" I'm trying to install ruby on rails from scratch on Ubuntu 12.10.

This first part is going to be slightly long and hopefully entertaining.   As in, that is screwed up! but there might be a clue in there.\nSo I bought my laptop. From the very beginning, and occasionally for no known reason it's screen would freeze. The keyboard would freeze and the keyboard shortcuts on wikipediea, that try and shut down a frozen computer, were quickly found. The shortcuts didn't work either. It didn't happen often and got better with updates.  Better means less frequently.  Eventually it would happen only when  under heavy load, when I was in Chromium with 10 tabs.  Annoying but with no solution , I ignored it.  \nWell two days ago before work It did this, I shut the computer down as I always did,by holding down the power button. \nIt popped back up and ran a hard drive check as it sometimes did and brought me to the login screen.  Which is different then most times , usually it goes straight to the desktop. So I typed in my password and nothing happened,  fine I called up a terminal trying to shut down the computer first by ctrl-alt-f2 as I always do.  My computer not being frozen goes to command line, I log in and I type in one of the few commands I now know by heart sudo reboot! And it does in ten seconds,  SSDs rock.   And comes to the login screen. \nVague recognition occurs that this isn't Kansas anymore Toto,  and Crap  I haven't backed up in a while.  No don't groan,  I swear I'll back up more often, I swear I will learn what rsync does and create a keyboard short cut to back up my home folder.  I'll go through rehab I swear  just help me get my wallpapers and documents  back please!\nI broke X and I don't even know what X is, Its a video thingy mag jig, that puppy linux (dell mini sometimes)  asks me X versa or X org.\nSo I broke out my netbook  a dell mini 9 that I bought with a tax return,  I now have internet with a small screen, to small to enjoy really, 12 inch minimum is recommended , maybe 10 with a tablet.   I come the interwebs for a solution and nothing.  My google fu has failed me. \nI think, well lets upgrade to 12.10, that should keep my files and fix the problem.  Well It starts and I go to work.   And doesn't work.  I am now ubuntu 12.10 and no GUI.   I try to reinstall the gnome shell via a command on the internet choose lightdm and nothing.   I have tried these commands (not necessarily in order)  sudo apt-get system76-driver  ,  sudo dpkg –configure -a , sudo apt-get gnome-shell , sudo apt-get autoremove , sudo apt-get update, sudo start lightdm , sudo stop lightdm , do release-upgrade , sudo stopx , sudo killx ,  sudo startx, and sudo lsusb (that last didn't help me at all, note a lot of the responses went over my head)  \nSo being terminaly board, get it I am in the terminal and board, and being as I have to go to work in an hour and being ready to work I type in the commands to run Diablo 3 I run my Ptrace command\necho 0| sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope\n*force_s3tc_enable=true setarch i386 -3 -L -B -R /opt/cxoffice/bin/wine –bottle “Diablo III” --cx-app “Diablo III laucher.exe”\nand I am sure you are just shocked shocked to hear that I didn't run.  It can't create a window, can't find a driver or some such.

Would Ubuntu 12.10 on a Dell Inspiron e1405 (Intel Core Duo T2300 (1.66 GHz/2MB L2 Cache)  be too slow?   also, it only has 1GB RAM\n\nA: The easiest option would be to go onto the Ubuntu website and check the relevant release notes if you're keen on using Ubuntu (although keep in mind that older versions won't receive updates after a certain amount of time) here is a list of the official system requirements which you'd probably find relevant with your hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*12.10 Quantal Quetzal\n\n*12.04 Precise Pangolin LTS\n\n*11.10 Oneiric Ocelot\n\n*11.04 Natty Narwhal\nHowever as the release notes only really give you an idea of the minimal requirements and don't give you a clear indication on how responsive the system is, I'd suggest you'd also give a look at other Ubuntu derivatives as Unity can be slightly less responsive on lower end systems. A good read if you're unsure is to give Marco Ceppi's answer on Ubuntu derivated operating systems a read as it's a great resource if you're unsure what to pick. \nAlternatively if you want pure speed on your laptop, I'd suggest looking at questions such as the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lighter in CPU/Memory Usage: Lubuntu or Xubuntu\n\n*What is the lightest desktop interface for ubuntu and is Unity-2d classified as a 'light' interface?\nAdditionally if you like stability and regular updates for years to come I'd suggest sticking to a LTS release such as 12.04, as these versions will be updated the longest as explained in this question's answers.\nAs I'm guessing you're relatively new to the community and I may have bombarded you with information feel free to search the site for any terms you're not familiar with or alternatively just post a question in the comments below and I'll add the information you need to my answer. \n\nA: You would probably find such a system to be too slow, but this is subjective.

They have something called Qt Service Framework which seams to do the job.\n", "Q: NTFS vs EXT4 behavior on a HDD with a bad block Anyone have a guess as to why a HDD, formatted to EXT3,  failed showing a bad block, and when wiped and reformatted (just to test) gave errors in gparted for every file type except NTFS?  \nThe drive gave me input/output errors.  I had all the data backed up anyway, so I decided to just play with it, running scans, checks, repairs of every sort just to get some practice.  I fired up gparted, and attempted to format it to every type down the list, and suddenly NTFS took to it without issue.  \nI even tried to reformat it again, every type, and got an error every time again except with NTFS.  Is it safe to use that way?  Does NTFS work around bad blocks and sectors?\nBefore I turn the drive into slag or an art project, I would like to figure out this mystery.\n\nA: Because a freshly formatted NTFS happens to not use that bad sector.  Thus it wasn't written to, and so the error was not noticed.\n\nA: NTFS probably re-maps bad sectors and works around them.  Bad sectors that aren't handled internally by the drive mean that it's on it's way to impeding failure.  Would you rather know about this or have these events silently logged in Window's system log?  I personaly would rather know at the time of formatting.\n", "Q: How can I get my bookmarks shown in nemo quicklists automatically How can I get my bookmarks, shown in Nemo Quicklists automatically.\nLike nautilus can right now. As seen in the image below.\n\nWhen i create a bookmark in nautilus, it is automatically shown in Nautilus Quick-lists.\nHow can i get that exact same feature for nemo!?\n\nA: I'm pretty sure this PPA is working on it, however the description says not to use it because it's a work in progress, but it's at least worth watching to see how far it gets. If anyone else knows of another way, like a way to manually create quicklists for it, please do tell.\nUPDATE: I found a solution, it's not \"automatic\" so to speak, but I found a way to manually and easily add quicklists for bookmarks and places. Menulibre supports creating Unity quicklists.\nTo install Menulibre first open a terminal, Ctrl+Alt+T, then enter the following commands:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:menulibre-dev/devel\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install menulibre\nNow when you launch Menulibre, look for the Nemo launcher (it'll be titled 'Home Folder', so doing a search for 'nemo' will not work), you'll notice when editing a launcher in Menulibre there's a tab for 'Quicklists', click on it and add your items. For the commands, here's an example, to make a quicklist for 'Documents' just type nemo Documents, the working directory for the commands is your home directory, so just typing the name of the folder after 'nemo' is enough.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: If memory serves, as of 2.0.8 nemo is able to show bookmarks from quicklist, so the answer to the question is, update to the latest nemo: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/nemo\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nemo\n\n", "Q: Error during ATI propreitary driver install I tried to install the latest (13.1) ATI propreitary drivers, as mentioned here.\nBut I'm getting the following error when trying to create .deb packages for use.\n.........\n.........\n# refresh copyright file\ncat debian/copyright_stub_0 > debian/copyright\ncat usr/share/doc/fglrx/LICENSE.TXT >> debian/copyright\ncat debian/copyright_stub_1 >> debian/copyright\n#Steps that we can't easily represent in debhelper files or .in files yet\n# Remove any libraries that may be caught by shell expansion\nfind . -name libGLE* | xargs rm -f\nfind . -name libEGL* | xargs rm -f\ndh_installdirs -pfglrx\n# Install the QT libraries\ndh_install -pfglrx \"arch/x86_64/usr/share/ati/lib\" \"usr/share/ati\"\ncp: cannot stat `debian/tmp/arch/x86_64/usr/share/ati/lib': No such file or directory\ndh_install: cp -a debian/tmp/arch/x86_64/usr/share/ati/lib debian/fglrx/usr/share/ati/ returned exit code 1\nmake: *** [binary-arch] Error 2\ndpkg-buildpackage: error: debian/rules binary gave error exit status 2\n[Error] Generate Package - error generating package : Ubuntu/quantal\n\nHow can I fix this error? \nI tried the open Radeon driver, but the laptop was overheating to above 80 degrees C. \nI installed the propreitary drivers via the Software Sources window, and the system was running at moderate temperature, but then I couldn't login to Gnome 3 after the reboot, so installing the propreitary drivers properly would be really useful.\n\nA: From what I read over on ubuntufourms it is a bug in the package installer.

I press F9 when booting and the boot menu comes up, but only the harddrive with Windows 7 is available; the USB stick doesn't show up.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: If USB doesn't show in boot menu, probably there's something wrong with it. Perhaps you should format it and see if it shows in the boot menu without anything else in it. You should proceed with creating Ubuntu live USB only after you can see the reformatted empty USB. If it doesn't show up perhaps you should try another one.\n\nA: Maybe you should try doing it with a DVD. I had that issue when trying to boot Lubuntu from my perfectly fine USB drive, then tried the DVD player, and it worked perfectly\n\nA: Did you make your USB bootable, or did you only copy paste the ISO onto it?\nCheck here how to make it bootable: https://rufus.ie/en_IE.html\n", "Q: Google Chrome starting up slow Whenever I try to open Chrome for the first time after booting, it takes about 8-10 seconds longer than it does for Windows. Is this the case for everyone? Is there a way to fix it?\nI know it is not that much of an important problem but it bothers to wait that long while the process is instant on Windows 7.\n\nA: This sound like an issue with Chrome. However, you can install this daemon which will significantly improve launching apps on start-up. It is called Preload. Here is the summary of what Preload, taken from the Ubuntu Software Center:\npreload monitors applications that users run, and by analyzing this data, predicts what applications users might run, and fetches those binaries and their dependencies into memory for faster startup times.\n\nNote that installing preload will not make your system boot faster and that preload is a daemon that runs with root priviledges.\nI have used it, and found that when I get to my desktop, from boot, programs like Firefox, launch significantly faster. \nTo install it, either open the Ubuntu Software Center, and search for preload, or for Terminal users, open the terminal (Alt+Ctrl+T) and enter:\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\nSimple as that. Please report if it make Chrome open quicker. I hope this helped. \n\nA: I've heard some people talking about the same issue, so I assume it's normal.\nIs it a desktop PC or a laptop?

I have a printer capable of printing high res photos on photo paper, and duplex documents on plain A4.\nI have set the printer up twice (i.e. two separate printers pointing to the same URI) using the CUPS interface at http://localhost:631, once called Documents, once called Photos. For each of these instances I have set up the appropriate defaults (media type, size, print quality, duplex...). CUPS seems to remember these fine but applications (e.g. LibreOffice, EOG, firefox ... under Gnome Shell FWIW) seem to have some weird other default that bears no resemblance to either the defaults I set up, nor the last settings I used with any particular application.\nIt's a problem because there are so many settings to change that it adds a couple of minutes to each and every print job. Inevitably I forget one or two and end up having to reprint the job.\nSeems there must be somewhere that these defaults get stored? Anyone shed any light on it?\n\nA: I have three CUPS print queues configured with the same printer URI. Queue \"deskjet\" is configured with my local standard paper, queue \"Legal\" is configured with \"Legal\" size paper, and queue \"Envelopes\" is configured for #10 Envelopes. \"Legal\" and \"Envelopes\" queues are stopped (via cupsdisable). \nFirst, add the queue in CUPS  (http://localhost:631), then use Administration->Modify Printer to change the paper type and other characteristics.\nI use my setup like this:\n# print to the Envelope queue ( select Envelope queue in your app)\nenvelope .envelope/addresses/Friend4 | lpr -PEnvelope \ncupsdisable deskjet\n# remove regular paper, load envelopes\ncupsenable Envelope\n# wait until envelope is printed, then\ncupsdisable Envelope\ncupsenable deskjet\n\n\nA: I came across this page because I had a problem in assigning\nmultiple queues with one printer.\nThat is: (in my case)\n1.

I would like to have the nautilus background color different if the current folder is being managed by git (i.e., if there is a .git directory in it).  Any ideas how to do that?  Ideal solution would work for all nautilus views (list view & compact view, not just icon view).  I've looked at \"gnome color chooser\" and at the \"window rules\" module of ccsm, to no avail.

For me it was /usr/share/themes/Ambiance\n\n*It is better to copy this folder in ~/.themes and then make changes to it, rather than making changes in the original location.  \n\n*Look for gtk-3.0/apps/nautilus.css in the Ambiance folder.\n\n*Add these lines at the top of the file:\nNautilusWindow * {background-color: gray;}\n\n*Restart nautilus, using nautilus -q command to quit nautilus.\n\n*You will notice that the background color of browser area changes to gray.\n\n\nComing back to your original question, I don't think it's possible to theme nautilus based on location because, changing theme requires nautilus to be restarted.

I have the ssh-server running fine, configured ufw (firewall) fine as well. However, it seems I can't manage ssh as a service or through /etc/init.d/ssh.\nI re-installed openssh-server specifically to ensure my minor configuration tweaks to /etc/ssh/sshd_config were not the problem. \nUbuntu:~/$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh status\n\nRather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d, use the service(8)\nutility, e.g. service ssh status\n\nSince the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an\nUpstart job, you may also use the status(8) utility, e.g. status ssh\nssh stop/waiting\n\nand\nUbuntu:~/$ sudo service ssh status\nssh stop/waiting\n\nbut I can ssh fine (either from Ubuntu [localhost] or otherComputer [remotely], presume the comp's name is Ubuntu)\notherComputer:~/$ ssh me@Ubuntu\nme@Ubuntu's password:\nme@Ubuntu:~/$\n\nVery frustrating, unsure what the problem is. I'm running gnome-keyring to manage my ssh-agent and keys, but this shouldn't interfere with ssh-server as a service.\n\nA: What follows assumes that the computer on which you re-installed openssh-server and from which you are sshing is NOT \"Ubuntu\", the machine you accessing by means of ssh me@Ubuntu.\n\nI think that your problem is confusion about the difference between the ssh daemon and the ssh client. The ssh daemon (sshd) is the program that allows you or others to ssh into the machine that the daemon is running on. When you run sudo service ssh <whatever> you are giving commands to sshd, i.e. to start or stop or whatever.\nThe other piece of ssh is the ssh client. This is what you start whenever you run ssh somebody@host.name in a terminal. This is a self-contained program that connects with the ssh daemon running on computer called \"host.name\". For ssh to work there must be an ssh daemon running on the computer it wants to connect to but there does not need to be one running on its own computer.\nWhat this all means is that your computer is working perfectly fine. You are able to ssh out to a remote server as long as you have networking. \nIn fact you should probably remove the openssh-server package from your computer as if it is not being used all it would do is be a security risk. \n\nA: @alex-l answer to me is right: \n(as root)\n service ssh status\nservice ssh stop\n\nthen check if the port is up (22)\nnetstat -nat\n\nthat's all\nother thing that you can do to check if ereytinh is ok is do from other machine an \nssh -v user@ubuntu-machine\n\n\nA: It's worth knowing that as far as I know, the 'service ssh [stop|status]' command, applies to the process identified in /var/run/sshd.pid but the actual process listening can be identified by running 'sudo netstat -lpn |grep ssh' if they don't match, that'll be why the confusion is there.  \nOn my machine this is what I see:-\n\nroot@babypuss:/var/www/middletier# ls /var/run/sshd.pid\n/var/run/sshd.pid\nroot@babypuss:/var/www/middletier# cat /var/run/sshd.pid\n10959\nroot@babypuss:/var/www/middletier# ps ax |grep sshd\n10959 ?        Ss     0:00 /usr/sbin/sshd -D\n\nIf the pid's don't match, then (as root) kill the running sshd process and start it again with 'service ssh start' to see what happens.  \nBut as has been said before, if on the Ubuntu machine, you can run 'ps ax |grep sshd' and see nothing running, then check isn't not some kind of xinet type service by asserting via 'netstat -lpn |grep 22' that nothing is listening on port 22.  If nothing is really listening, then the most likely problem is that the machine you're connecting to, from somewhere else, isn't the one you're looking at (so check the /etc/hosts file on @otherComputer).  \nIf you're 90% sure it is connecting to the machine you think you are, then double check with 'netstat -n |grep -v ^unix' on each machine, to identify the actual connection, and the shell running on @Ubuntu when it's connected.  \nIf you really can't see the listening service, be afraid.  It could be a rootkit.  Try shutting down the computer and attempting to reconnect, to be absolutely sure you're connecting to the machine you're worrying about.  \n", "Q: How to monitor USB webcam bandwidth usage?

Had windows xp installed this morning, thought I'd give ubuntu a whirl since I was planning on using it on my just ordered odroid u2, installed it through usb (copied the important data on there to one of my three partitions, formatted it and installed ubuntu through that) & decided to replace windows xp with ubuntu during installation because of random issues I was having with it. Now I'm having trouble accessing my drive. I can see my drive under computer but it says 'Unable to mount location' \nSorry if this is a really noob question, but its 2am here and I need my data in a few hours. I've been searching for quite a bit now. Downloaded GParted, tried mounting it through the terminal, and a couple other things. \nedit: running 12.10 btw\n\nA: Most often linux will refuse to mount it because of errors on the filesystem\ntry running ntfsfix\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man8/ntfsfix.8.html\nit is part of the ntfsprogs package so you should have it. \nsudo ntfsfix <options> <device> .. <device> being something like  /dev/sda4 etc..\nYou can get the device name from Disk Utility. Open Unity Launcher and type Disk Utlity\n\nA: NTFS 3g will not mount a drive thats been uncleanly shutdown. The 'safe'/'easy'/'idiotproof' way would normally be to boot into windows, then shutdown cleanly then boot into linux. You can also 'force' mount the drive. \nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdaX /mnt/mountpoint/ -o force \nShould do the trick - replace /dev/sdaX with the device name of the partition, and mountpoint with the location you want to mount the drive. This will tell ntfs 3g to ignore the errors and mount the drive anyway.\nFor more details, take a look at the ntfs 3g manpage.\n", "Q: Can I install `libssl-dev:i386` on x86_64 system without losing important packages?

I want to try Bodhi Linux (which is very close to Ubuntu) beside the already installed Lubuntu Quantual (which was in a dual boot with WinXP). So, I want a 3-boot: to chose between these three at boot.\nI have shrinked Windows partition, created a 7 GB new one and want to put Bodhi there.\nBut didn't took the time to get all the info. Where to put the bootloader?\nI have set it to the same partition where I set Bodhi to be installed. It is called /dev/sda4 and is on the same partition table with all the others. But during install it says that setting bootloader there is impossible and I have several  options: change location of bootloader, continue without a bootloader and abort installation.\nWhat to do?\nContinuing without bootloader would keep the old Lubuntu bootloader and I'll have the 3-boot desired option in grub or what?\nShould I follow this answer and others that recommend to put bootloader in /dev/sda or is that just for dual boot?\n\nA: From my experience you should install the bootloader in the hard drive itself instead of a partition, most likely /dev/sda (unless you are using a mac with OSX where you need to install EFI in the hard drive and create a partition for the bootloader).\nEvery time you add a new distro grub checks for installed OSs in each partition and it will update your grub screen with an option for each OS. \nThe only thing that will happen is that some distros have a different look and feel for grub so it might not be as nice depending on what partition you install last.\nFinally if you want to update your grub (because you broke it or don't like the looks of it) you can put a live cd (or usb or whatever you fancy) and fix it. There are some guides for it. My point there is that you can play around without actually losing information though backups are always in place ;)\n", "Q: How do I Make the Cuda 5.0 samples?

Within the file manager (Nautilus), you can customize it a bit through Edit -> Preferences. \nI set default view to List View and added some additional default columns. Adding the owner column displays the machine username and full name of the user (given on install). Like this:\nName       | Size    | Group   | Owner            | Permissions\nfile.txt   | 1.0 kB  | john    | john - John Doe  | -rw-r--r--\n\nHow do I remove the full name? So it displays like this:\nName       | Size    | Group   | Owner  | Permissions\nfile.txt   | 1.0 kB  | john    | john   | -rw-r--r--\n\nSee how it says john - John Doe?\n\n\nA: As has been alluded to, this is behavior that is coded into the Nautilus application.  \nHowever, you can get around the functionality by changing your \"Real Name\" to be the same as your username ... Nautilus only displays a second \"name\" in the owner column if the real name is different from the username.\nYou should be able to change your \"real name\" in System-Administration-Users and Groups.\nI had trouble getting the changes to stick for me, so I manually changed it by editing /etc/passwd.\nYou will have to restart all nautilus instances for the change to take effect.\n", "Q: Who is Mark Shuttleworth, and how is he related to Ubuntu?

Thawte has since been sold to Verisign.\n\n*Shuttleworth was a Debian Developer in the 1990s.\n\n*Shuttleworth founded his company Canonical LTD in 2004, a company dedicated to supporting free software.\n\n*Through his company Canonical LTD, he founded the Ubuntu operating system in 2004.  Ubuntu is a derivative software product of Debian.  Canonical still governs and supports the Ubuntu operating system to this day and Ubuntu continues to be a product based on Debian.\n\n*He set up the Ubuntu Foundation in 2005 with an initial donation of $10 million USD of his own funds.\n\n*He remained the CEO of Canonical LTD until 2010, when he stepped down to focus on other responsibilities within Canonical and Ubuntu.\n\n*Shuttleworth is also famous for being the second ever self-funded space tourist (funded a trip to space with his own money) and the first ever South African in space.\n", "Q: Headphones and ubuntu 12.04 (again) As the title says.

Did this week's backup work? Will next week's? If not, how can I resolve this error?\nI'm not too concerned about the old versions of my files, and even if I need them in the future, I have some disk images saved which I could restore from. So should I just delete everything and start deja-dup from scratch?\nAny advice is appreciated.\n\nA: I have had this problem recently myself. I have not found an 'ideal' solution. The safest option is to discard the faulty backup and start a new one, as you mention in your comment.\nOther answers to similar problems suggest workarounds for restoring files by using previous backups or ignoring the files in the corrupted volume, but this is clearly sub-optimal, not to say fiddly to achieve in practice. However, this does not help a failed backup.\nTrying to force a full backup of the files in the failed volume is counter-productive, because the next incremental backup is huge, covering all the other files; you might as well delete the failed backup and start again.\nI did find a way to implement a patch of the failed part of the backup. Here is the recipe:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the affected files by noting the volume number, and then check against the volume number in the manifest file.\n\n*Touch the affected files (touch -m /name/of/file). \n\n*Do an incremental backup.\n\n\nThe incremental backup will contain the affected file(s), plus any others that changed in the interim, and the SHA1 error is no longer reported...  except by verification (see below).\nI tested this using duplicity directly rather than the deja-dup gui, because it enabled me to have a bit more control, and to do additional things like verify the backup (duplicity verify /target/directory url:///for/backup/archive). It does not remove the original SHA1 problem, but mitigates it by providing a way to restore the files in the presumably corrupted backup volume(s).\nBy the same token, I think if you are serious about backups, you need to forget deja-dup and use duplicity directly instead, because backups without verification aren't worth anything. I discovered that the hard way, having used deja-dup for almost two years, before a failed backup made me realize that actually my backup schedule was a house built on sand; when I checked the external drive I had been using, about 5% of all the backup files were unreadable. Since then, I have found that using shell scripts with duplicity isn't so hard, and once it is set up it is very easy.\n", "Q: Push contacts to Google from local I am able to synchronize Thunderbird with my gmail contacts such that I can use all of my gmail contacts in Thunderbird.\nI have made changes locally to my contacts locally in Thunderbird.

That depends on  your bios. During bootup you may need to press Del or F2 or F1, Again this depends on your bios.\nIn order to make a flash bootable you have some options including using a tool named \"unetbootin\" witch I believe is the best tool to do so.\n", "Q: What should I do to run after I have successfully installed touchegg on Ubuntu 12.10?

While pressing Prnt Scrn mostly takes a screenshot there are times it doesn't do as intended. The most common case is when a dropdown menu is active.\nHow do I take such screenshots?

Assign the key combination you'd like.\n\n*Close this window or it wont work.\n\n\n\n*presto!\nYou just took one further step to be an ubuntu master, I hope this answer was helpful *\n\nA: If you are running Ubuntu and prefer using the command line, gnome-screenshot should come pre-installed on the system and has some handy command line options (and you should be able to do everything you can do from the GUI via command line).\nFor instance, to take a screenshot with a delay of 5 seconds:\ngnome-screenshot --delay 5\n\nRun man gnome-screenshot for the full list of options, or view some examples in this blog post: 4 Methods to Take Screenshot Capture in Ubuntu Linux\n\nA: The answer is quite similar for each distro. It requires you to use the \"delay\" feature present in these tools. The delay feature allows you to issue the command to take a screenshot after an interval that you specify. You can set this interval such that, after you have issued the command, you have enough time to bring up the screen you want to capture.\nThe exact way to set up a delay depends on each distro's default screenshot application. And, as often, you maybe able to do what you want via a GUI or a terminal or keyboard shortcuts.\nGNOME in 22.04\nIn 22.04 the screenshot delay feature was replaced with a built in screen recording feature. Instead of taking a delayed shot you can record a video and then later pick the precise frame that you need for your screenshot.\nunfortunately I was unable to work out how take a screenshot of the built in screenshot tool so here's a photo of it:\n\nGNOME/Unity in 12.10\nThe default tool is Screenshot (aka gnome-screenshot if you want to run it from a terminal). So, you would start typing screenshot in Unity's Dash to see it appear for you to click on. You'll then see a small window with several options:\n\nSome options will be exposed depending on what you choose. If you choose to grab the whole screen, the \"Include the window border\" and \"Apply effect\" won't be available.\nSet things up as you want. A five second delay is a nice starting point to let you bring up the actual screen you wish to capture. To get things going, click \"Take Screenshot\". Quickly set up what you want and wait.\nYou'll hear the sound of an (old-fashioned) camera shutter and a new screen will appear.\nIn it, you will see:\n\n*\n\n*a \"thumbnail\" of the screenshot\n\n*an option to specify the name and destination for saving the\nscreenshot\n\n*and the possibility to save it to the clipboard instead if you wish\nto process the image further.\n\nThe default image format is .png, which is, in the opinion of some, a more suitable format than .jpg.\nNote that the time delay feature of gnome-screenshot is not available if you choose \"Select area to grab\".\nLubuntu 12.10\nThe default screenshot capture tool in Lubuntu is called scrot. There is a way to use scrot with a time delay that doesn't require using the terminal. But it involves a one time edit of a file called lubuntu-rc.xml after backing it up for safety. This file is found in ~/.config/openbox. Go to this subfolder using your file manager, right-click on the file and open it with your favorite text editor. Then search for something like:\n<!-- Launch scrot when Print is pressed -->\n<keybind key=\"Print\">\n  <action name=\"Execute\">\n    <command>....</command>\n  </action>\n</keybind>  \n\nWhere .... is whatever is currently there between <command> and </command>. Replace .... with\nscrot -b -d 5 ~/Desktop/%Y:%m:%d:%H:%M:%S.png\n\nSave the file and close it.\nGo into a terminal and run openbox --reconfigure. (You won't see anything happen and you'll get back your prompt if you haven't messed up anything. If you have messed up something, you'll get an error. That's when the back-up comes handy.) Running the command is a necessary step to ensure that your edits to lubuntu-rc.xml are now active.\nWhat you've done by editing lubuntu-rc.xml is to ask scrot to\n\n*\n\n*take a full screenshot (including window borders because of -b)\n\n*with a time delay of five seconds\n\n*name the file based on the current time in\nyear:month:day:hour:min:sec format in the .png format and\n\n*to save the image to your Desktop.\n\nWhat is described above basically enables you to just hit Prnt Scrn, then do what you want such as open a menu within 5 sec after which scrot takes a full window screenshot. It does this silently. Don't expect to hear or see anything.\nRunning man scrot from a terminal provides you with more information on scrot.\nOne can modify the code to take a snap of the active window only by the addition of -u and assigning the keybind of Alt+Prnt Scrn to this code.\nWith both Prnt Scrn and Alt+Prnt Scrn, it is possible to add -q N to the code where -q tells scrot to save the image with a quality other than the default value of N which is 75.  A high value will create a higher quality but larger file. According to man scrot the effect of -q is dependent on the image format chosen.\nXubuntu 12.10\nThe default screenshot tool in Xubuntu 12.10 is Xfce4-screenshooter. It has a GUI that doesn't look too different from that of the GNOME one:\n\nAs with the GNOME screenshot tool, there are a few options but the delay function is not available with \"Select a region\".\nOn clicking OK, another window appears with choices about saving the image to a file, copying it to the clipboard, opening it with programs that can manipulate images (as the dropdown shows), and even uploading it to a specific image-hosting service.\n\nIf one opts to save the image to disk, a regular \"Save as\" screen appears allowing you to specify the name, file type, and location of the saved format.\nman xfce4-screenshooter has details of the switches available and those could help if a user is interested in modifying the functions of Prnt Scrn and Alt + Prnt Scrn to always use the delay option.\n\n*\n\n*Prnt Scrn could be set to xfce4-screenshooter -d 5 -f.\nThen, any time Prnt Scrn is pressed, xfce4-screenshooter\nwill take a snap of the full screen because of -f after a delay\nof 5 sec and then prompt you for a filename and location.\n\n*Alt+Prnt Scrn could be set to\nxfce4-screenshooter -d 5 -w to grab the active window because\nof -w.\n\n\nA: I use a program called Shutter . To my knowledge it works on most of the desktop managers - I currently use is in Unity without problems, it works in the current Kubuntu and Mint for me as well. \nYou can see its got buttons to take screenshots of (in order, buttons from left to right):\n\n\n*\n\n*Selection of the screen\n\n*One or more of the workspaces/desktops \n\n*Any window that is open\n\n*Any selection of a window\n\n*A single menu or cascading menus from an application\n\n*Tool tips\n\n*Websites\n\n\n\nFurthermore, at the bottom you can see its also got a delay function. Its got a very nice basic editing tool as well as an app-indicator.\nI've been super please with it for a long time.\n\nA: Install Kazam Screencaster by:\nsudo apt install kazam\n\n\nIt's especially useful on Ubuntu 22 where delay feature from the default screenshot utility appears to be removed.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Got freezing while preparing to install I've downloaded Via http Ubuntu Desktop ISO and used a Usb stick as per Ubuntu instructions I've done all and got it to the installation point and \nthen preparing to install when i click continue it takes forever \nIt's not hanging whole computer i can still work on Firefox without any problem but Ubuntu preparing to install window freeze \nPlease help on this what can i do ?

However, due to Windows finicky UEFI setup, this didn't all go as planned.\nIn order to boot from a LiveUSB, I entered my BIOS and changed the boot mode from UEFI to Legacy BIOS.  This allowed me to change the boot order and properly install Ubuntu 12.10 onto my partitioned drive.\nUbuntu was working fine, but when I rebooted, there was no GRUB menu asking whether I'd like to load into Windows or Linux.  It simply loaded me directly into Linux as if Windows wasn't there.\nI figured it was due to my being in Legacy BIOS boot mode, so I changed it back to UEFI.  Then, only Windows would load, with no menu for choosing Ubuntu.\nIn retrospect, I'd have kept this over the disaster that is currently my computer.  I went back into Linux by switching into Legacy BIOS again and install boot-repair.  I ran it on the Recommended Settings, thinking it would install my much needed boot menu.  It didn't.\nNow, I can't get either OS to load.  When I reboot in UEFI, I get errors stating:\nWindows Boot Manager has been blocked by the current security policy and then HDD0:  has been blocked...etc.  I can't disable Secure Boot while still loading in UEFI mode.\nBooting in Legacy BIOS leaves me in the grub rescue prompt with the error file '/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod'.\nPrior to rebooting after running boot-repair, I was given the pastebin: paste.ubuntu.com/1618833 and was told that my .efi file was located in sda2/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi.\nI am becoming desperate.  Please advise me in loading into at least one of my operating systems...\nNOTE: I have read many of the similar posts, but none address the problem with necessary depth.  Most others' problems were solved by boot-repair, not caused by it.\n\nA: I guess your mistake has been to install two operating systems (Windows and ubuntu) in different modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 8 is istalled in UEFI Secure mode\n\n*ubuntu is installed in BIOS Legacy mode\nYou can only switch between the modes via the BIOS/UEFI. \nPlease try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart you system with the power-button\n\n*Immendiately thereafter press  to enter the BIOS/UEFI\n\n*Press F10 and set the system to UEFI Boot and Secure boot enabled. Then save the settings\n\n*Press F9 to enter the \"boot options\". In the \"boot manager\" try the listed files one by one. Hopefully one boots. Alternatively let us know what is listed there.\n\nA: I did the same thing day one with the same laptop! Freaked me out. But it got better. I really learned about the UEFI bootloader and intel. \nyou need to youtube \"intel uefi\" .  intel puts out a series of three videos were they install windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10 on a machine with a uefi type device. \nWhat you need is a shim added to the bootloader. All is explained in the videos. Just make sure you dont lock your bootloader. I mean secure boot. That locked me out of the machine totally. It would not boot from usb, cd, anything. Its like locking your keys in your car with the engine running.\nAfter all said and done, i now dual boot with grub2. At start up i see my options for ubuntu or windows. For three months, ive used windows, three times.\nI know you got into your machine by now, but this post is for others now discovering the wonderful world of the uefi bootloader with secure boot!

Is there any way to ignore checksum and install it anyway?\n\nA: If the checksum is not right, your file is corrupted or someone tampered with it. Just download it again. There may be some workaround for this but this would mean that you would either install a broken software or a malware.\n", "Q: Literally impossible to install Ubuntu on Win8 laptop I have tried countless times to boot from  a usb and also a disc... secure boot is off, but still in UEFI mode. Please guide me.. I love the look (I am using Virtual Box) and I want to be able to Dual Boot. Thanks\n\nA: Are you looking to wipe Windows 8 off completely? If so, I managed to do this myself. I cannot remember the exact steps (did it by accident) but I know I repaired Ubuntu from the Live CD. It ended up wiping my partition completely and fresh installed Ubuntu. \nHope that helps.\nEdit: make a recovery CD of Windows 8 so you don't end up in my position and stuck with Linux only. Not a huge deal but it's seems almost irrevocable. \n\nA: Since you already have secure boot off:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Windows 8 Disk Management to shrink your windows partition the desired amount to leave room for Linux (ONLY APPLYS IF SHARING SAME DISK)\n\n*Boot from Installation media in UEFI mode(Not sure if applies to cds). My laptop lets me choose to boot devices with UEFI or normally. Choose UEFI. One of your F1-F12 buttons should give you a boot device selection menu. If you cant find this menu, going into BIOS should let you choose one manually or chnage the order of boot devices.\n\n*During install choose \"something else\"\n\n*Split the unused space into 2 partitions,a swap partition and filesystem of your choosing. Install the bootloader to the same drive your Windows is installed on.\n\n\nOnce done isntalling windows will no longer boot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from installation media again but choose try Ubuntu this time.\n\n*install boot repair\n\n*Run boot repair using recomended settings and reboot.\n\n*Enjoy\n\n", "Q: Cambria appears only in italics in LibreOffice I have a Windows 7 partition mounted in Ubuntu.

I restored it, nothing. \nFor what it's worth, I wanted to try gnome-panel so I installed it just before I did the drivers. I noticed it was a little shaky so I don't know what can be attributed to that and what issues are related to the driver install. \nFirst the launcher went, then the resolution and multiple displays on a subsequent reboot. \nFound something online about downloading compiz manager to get the launcher back.

When investigating this question, I discovered that many GNOME applications' packages depend on the libunity9 package.\n\nIf I try to uninstall libunity9 on Precise, it tries to uninstall lots of GNOME applications:\n\nMiJyn said in a comment,\n\nhow could the ubuntu developers possibly think that would be a good idea? Ubuntu is starting to be more and more like windows :(\n\nThe libunity9 package is described as:\n\nbinding to get places into the launcher - shared library\nlibunity is a shared library to be able to interact with the launcher and add places in Unity environment.\nThis package contains shared libraries to be used by applications\n\nSo obviously it's a component of Unity. It is odd that GNOME applications depend on Unity. Since Unity is an Ubuntu-specific addition, upstream GNOME apps shouldn't be depending on it.\nWhy these dependencies?\n\nA: In the case of Shotwell and Geary (and probably many other apps), libunity support is a compile-time option set when you run ./configure.  That way it's enabled when Ubuntu builds it, but other distros can leave it off if they want to.\nUnfortunately that means Ubuntu derivatives that don't use libunity either have to rebuild the .deb without Unity support, or use the official Ubuntu-compiled package and accept that it requires an unnecessary package.\nKeep in mind that libunity is not Unity.  For example, Elementary OS uses libunity for their own custom dock to display badges on top of the icons.\nWhat any of this has to do with making Ubuntu \"more and more like windows\" is beyond me, particularly since Windows has no package management system.\n\nA: $ apt-cache rdepends libunity9\nlibunity9\nReverse Depends:\n  libunity9:i386\n  libunity9:i386\n  libunity-dev:i386\n  xchat-indicator\n  wallch\n  unity-china-music-scope\n  psensor\n  liferea\n  libunity-tools\n  geary\n  diodon-plugins\n  xchat-gnome-indicator\n  unity-webapps-service\n  unity-scope-musicstores\n  unity-lens-shopping\n  unity-lens-music\n  unity-lens-gwibber\n  unity-lens-files\n  unity-lens-applications\n  thunderbird-gnome-support\n  telepathy-indicator\n  shotwell\n  nautilus\n  libunity-dev\n  libunity-dev\n  libbrasero-media3-1\n  gir1.2-unity-5.0\n  evolution-indicator\n  empathy\n  deja-dup\n\nAll of the applications that depend on libunity9 actually use the library for Unity specific integrations like launcher badges, progress bar and urgency animation. If I am not wrong, the dependency on this library is actually Ubuntu specific modification to each of the GNOME application and probably has nothing to do with the upstream versions.\n\nA: The Ubuntu packaging of Psensor is depending on Unity to provide some integration features:\n\n\n*\n\n*display the highest temperature directly in the application launcher icon as a badge\n\n*provide a quick access to sensors values in the application indicator \n\n*when a sensor raises an alarm, the application indicator color is red\n\n\nYou can recompile psensor and rebuild the .deb without this dependency. That's the case of the debian packaging.\n", "Q: Skype login problem I have following strange problem under my Ubuntu 12.04. There is no possibility to start several skype instances. So I ran second skype with sudo /usr/bin/skype, logged to\nskype and used it without problems.

I tried to start skype with sudo /usr/bin/skype and after this I logged with this account without a problem. But now it's impossible to use this account directly without\nsudo command. How can I fix this issue?\n\nA: Do NOT run Skype with sudo! This is extremely unwise, as Skype will have full control over everything.

After rebooting or shutting down, things go haywire.\nWhen trying to boot back into Ubuntu 12.10, I just get a all purple screen with some weird black fuzzy bars at the top. I got past this by booting to recovery, going to root terminal, and typing the following:\nrm -Rfv ~/.compiz-1\nrm -Rfv ~/.config/compiz-1\nreboot now\n\nThis gets me back to the login screen but at a much reduced resolution and no Unity. I can play around with the different drivers here by right clicking the desktop, hittng change background, hitting All Settings, Software sources, and then Additional drivers, however all end up either the same or with just a black screen no mouse. \nThe only way at this point I can get unity and 1080p back is too hit CTRL + ALT + F1 and type:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\nsudo reboot now\n\nAt this point, compiz no longer crashes and all works great for my minimal purposes.

I've set the /etc/fstab file so that I can mount an ext4 partition on startup and I did it with the following options : rw, auto, nouser, exec, sync.\nThe problem is that I can't create or delete any file on that partition without using sudo, which I find even more puzzling because I've mounted an ntfs partition (with these options : rw, auto, user, noexec, sync) and I didn't get the same problem I can read and write on the ntfs partition without using sudo.\nHow could I mount an ext4 partition and have read/write permissions on it?\n\nA: This may not because of mounting problem, but of permission. You may not have sufficient permission to write on drive/folders on it or you are not the owner.\n  As you not provided the mount point we assume partition mounted at /media/foo\nTo own a directory, \n Open a terminal and run  sudo mkdir  /media/foo/test;  sudo chown $USER /media/foo/test . Now you should be able to write inside the folder test.\nIf you want to write on the folder then there are two option.\n1. own the data by sudo chown $USER /media/foo.\n2. Allow write for other users sudo chmod o w  /media/foo\nRarely some people interested in write, read access to all content for all users, like a windows partiton in linux. Commands chmod and chown has an option -R which recursively change the mode of all data under it. But it is not recommended unless you know what you do. If you use the -R on a OS's partition it may become unfunctional.\n\nA: Unfortunately Linux kernel  enforces POSIX permission on ext2/ext3/ext4 FS.\nWith common group across hosts and setgid bit or ACL you may share external volume across different hosts and keep read/write permission. One example of such setup is:\n$ sudo chgrp -R sys /mnt/data/dir\n$ sudo chgmod -R g+s /mnt/data/dir\n$ sudo fsetacl -R -m g:sys:rwx /mnt/data/dir\n$ sudo fsetacl -R -d -m g:sys:rwx /mnt/data/dir\n$ sudo adduser user sys\n\nRead more at https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/126213/external-hard-drive-permissions-ext4/\nSee also Solving permission problems when using external EXT4 hard disk with multiple linux installs\n\nA: First of, it'd be useful to check the drive's UUID by using following command:\nls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid\n\nIn my experience, I usually mount an EXT4 formatted harddrive using the defaults, and I never experienced any errors in write permissions.\nMy /etc/fstab looks like the following:\nUUID=004f9bfa-fb5a-438c-8a5a-dc04fa6f2d3e /media/MYCH0  auto defaults 0 0 #external hdd\n\nif all fails, you also might try to set yourself as the owner by doing this:\nsudo chown username:username /media/mountpoint\n\nFor further reference, you might want to take a look at this:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1482818\n", "Q: USB barcode scanner reading incorrect values We use an barcode reader.

If you do that then you can install Cisco Packet Tracer and this will be available next time you boot. \n\n\nA: You could either install the program every time you run Ubuntu Live, using another drive/partition and a quick install script, something like \"sudo dpkg --install program.deb\" should work.\nLike another answer said, using a USB with \"persistent\" would work too, but be aware there was a bug in the persistence where after several reboots (took me a few weeks of daily boots to see it) where the persistent data would get corrupted. It was existing in some debian bug reports since 2007 or so, and still there in 2011. And of course, a CD would need a separate drive/partition to save the persistent data.\nOr you could remaster a new Ubuntu Live ISO/CD/USB, a tool like remastersys should work, and there are other tools to do that too, but I don't know which are \"easier\" or \"best\".\n", "Q: Further information on the Ubuntu Phone SDK We saw many threads on the Ubuntu User Interface Toolkit that will be available for the Ubuntu Phone application development (see this thread for example).

I'm trying to configure unattended Ubuntu Desktop (12.10) installations booting from PXE.  I've got it working, but since I had to use the initrd.gz and kernel from the mini iso, it appears only to be able to install from an HTTP repository.  I'm using kickstart and preseed to do the actual install, and as I said it does work, but it takes a long time since it has to download all the packages.\nI have the full 12.10 ISO and I'd like to be able to PXE boot and do an unattended installation (with custom partitioning scheme) using the packages from the installation CD (i.e., not a remote mirror).  I looked in the install image and saw that everything's in a single squashfs file, so I mounted that but have no idea if it's possible to use the files inside that to do the install.\nIt looks like one solution is to use apt-mirror to setup a full repository mirror, and then configure preseed to use the local repository for the install.  This seems pretty straightforward, but requires setting up a 100 gig repository, when all the files I want for the base install are on an 800 MB ISO already.  \nI have a second PXE option which just mimics booting from the Ubuntu CD.  It drops you to the desktop, and you double-click the \"Install Ubuntu\" icon and go through the whole procedure.

You would not need to actually run the \"apt-mirror\" script to populate the mirror folders. \nIf you wanted the latest updates, you could limit the \"apt-mirror\" configuration to just update the main and restricted sections, which are all that is on the CDROM. This would increase the disk usage to about 25GB. \nOther suggestions may be to change the distribution point in the /etc/sources.list on the mini.iso system, or to just change /etc/hosts to redirect archive.ubuntu.com to a local address. \n\nUsing the proxy server was actually a pretty good idea, as it will tend to keep the files up-to-date automatically. It also handles future updates pretty efficiently. Kudos Evan.\n\nA: I use reprepro to make partial debian mirrors.  I use dpkg --get-selections > package.list to select the packages to mirror.

If so, how? Sorry if this is a stupid question I am new to Linux. \nI recently discovered what a theme engine is and I was wondering if it's possible to install other engines on my computer. A few themes that I have downloaded require certain engines. I am running GNOME 3.4 on Ubuntu. How can I find out what engines I have/where are they located and how would I add more?\nThank you\n\nA: For starters, you could run the following two simulations:  \napt-get install -s gtk3-engines*  \n\nand  \napt-get install -s gtk2-engines*  \n\nThese commands should indicate engines available to you.\nThen you could run:  \ndpkg --get-selections > ~/Desktop/installed-software  \n\nto get a list of software installed on your system and search that file for engines. I did that and have just the following engines because my OS is Lubuntu 12.10 and I haven't installed any extra themes:\n\ngtk2-engines:i386\n  gtk2-engines-pixbuf:i386\n  gtk3-engines-unico\n\nYou may also want to look at basic theme engines for GTK+:  \n\nGTK-engines is a collection of basic theme engines for GTK+.  \nThe GTK-engines provide basic themes for GTK. Themes control the user\n  interface, providing icons, shadows, text layout, color schemes,\n  window decoration and more.  \nThe basic theme engines are the ones that GNOME produce, though users\n  can install (or write and install) others.  \nThe basic theme engines are very flexible, so many themes can use a\n  single engine but still get a unique look and feel.  \n\nAnd from reading here and there, I get the impression that one has to be a little careful in ensuring that the themes one tries matches the GNOME version!\nAs for where exactly the \"engines\" are located, I honestly don't know but you could see if you have something like /usr/share/gtk-engines and /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/engines/. \n", "Q: Hp Dv6000 am i good to go I have a HP DV6000 and i'm interested in Ubuntu.

On startup, Dropbox runs files indexing, which brings the system pretty much to a stand still for three minutes.\nIs there a way to restrict Dropbox from accessing the hard disk, or decrease the priority of Dropbox's access to the hard disk?\n\nA: The right command is the following:\nionice -c 3 dropbox start -i\n\nBut you have to be careful and deactivate dropbox check box \"Start dropbox on system startup\" in dropbox config. Otherwise, dropbox will restore the command in the config file to \"dropbox start -i\" (without ionice call).\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Running Kubuntu 14.04, the above suggestions did not work. I came up with this one and it solved this problem for me on my Lenovo T510.\nIn the file /usr/share/applications/dropbox.desktop, change the Exec line to read:\nExec=ionice -c 2 -n 7 dropbox start -i\n\nWatching iotop, dropbox gets 99% of the CPU ONLY when no other process wants some time. It shares the hard drive with other processes by lowering it's demand level.\n\nA: You propably have encrypted home directory? Decrypting all the files on your Dropbox folder takes time and all your CPU capacity (I have the same problem). Switching dropbox process to low priority has the desired effect of un-jamming the computer and syncing still working fine.\nI just don't know how to automatically always start Dropbox with lower prioirty.\n\nA: Complementing the answer of Carlos D. Barranco, you can edit the launcher file located in /usr/share/applications/dropbox.desktop and permanently set a low priority start for dropbox.\nIn my case, it was also useful to limit the processor usage of dropbox. You can install package cpulimit: # apt-get install cpulimit \nFor example, to limit dropbox up to 20% processor usage: # cpulimit -b -e dropbox -l 20\nIn order to configure both low IO and low processing for dropbox automatically with the system launch, edit /usr/share/applications/dropbox.desktop and replace dropbox start -i by ionice -c 3 dropbox start -i && cpulimit -b -e dropbox -l 20\nCommand ionice will set idle priority for IO access and the parameter -l of cpulimit configures the processing limit in percentual values. More information on cpulimit can be found in: http://www.nixtutor.com/linux/changing-priority-on-linux-processes/\n\nA: Maybe a complex solution, but it should work and resolve your problem:\nSetup a file system in your system’s memory (tmpfs) and set that as your Dropbox folder. (Anything under /run/ will do this automatically.) It is temporary and will be deleted when you reboot! So you should setup something like a cron-job to periodically synchronize this location to a persistent folder in your home folder.\nUpdate: This article disuses this method for browser profiles.\nAlternatively, ionice will let you set the process priority to the file system. It could actually be more complicated to maintain and I am not even sure it does what you want.\n", "Q: Why are KDE apps running on unity too slow to load I use a few KDE applications in ubuntu; Okular, Kate and Kile. And it seems to me that they take a lot longer to load than other programs like Evince and gedit.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it because I'm running unity instead of KDE or is that just the way it is?\n\n*What can be done to reduce the loading delay?\n\n\nEdit:\nAfter changing my hard drive to SSD the lag is gone (of course not only that, everything loads instantaneously now)\n\nA: You could say that yes, Evince and Gedit use GTK libraries, these are already loaded by the rest of the environment. Launching the KDE software means launching more libraries which take more time because they're not already being used by other software. \nI wouldn't add anything to autostart  as it will probably slow it down, once they're loaded  when you open one your KDE programs you're good to go.\n", "Q: Installation via USB drive I recently downloaded version 12.10 to a flash drive.  When I try to load it, it does not go to a setup or installation page.  Goes to a log-in page, and asks for a username and password that I haven't established yet.  Is there a way to get past this page?\n\nA: Looks like you already installed. Try to boot directly from USB drive and not from the harddisk.\n", "Q: Web pages in Firefox scroll automatically. Is someone intruding on my computer? I think there has been 3 times an intrusion in my computer.\nLast week, I was listening music on my computer (ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS on a MacBook Air 4,2), my hands were far from keyboard and trackpad (on a  real book) and Firefox had the focus. I'm not a geek and not a 'mum-and-dad' user.\nI saw the web page I had opened self-scrolling a few (not reloading). I move the moose and 5 min later it happened again. I disable wifi. At that time aMule was running. Skype too. Some ports were open but not for my IP address. My system was updated 3 hours ago (but not the kernel) and so up-to-date.\n10 min later, the ubuntu update manager prompt me updates for the linux kernel. One package was named using Russian (linux-image-generic). It never happened before, so I didn't applied it yet. Yes, I've added Russian language to keyboard-maps and Russian virtual/visual keyboard.\n3 days later I saw again an open web page self-scrolling in Firefox. aMule wasn't running, but skype was.\nOne day later (now), I even find some packages' names translated in Russian in Ubuntu Software Center. Not apps, only packages.\n1. How can I know if there has been an intrusion in my computer ?\n2. How can I know if someone remotely changed/corrupted some packages or\n    configuration in my system ?\n3. Especially something concerning the update manager ?

All others are in the default Ubuntu language. Some packages' names are translated in Russian in Software Center. Not apps, only packages.\n\n\nFor the second activity, I would not consider this suspicious at all. Ubuntu is divided into thousands of packages, each one can receive updates. I wouldn't be surprised if not all the packages in Ubuntu's repositories get their meta-data translated into Russian on time before release, sadly. English is still by far the most used language in Ubuntu.\nFor the first problem, I would say this is much more likely to be a bug than a security breach. Even if you're aware from your touchpad and your mouse, it could well be that the hardware is problematic, sending signals to your computer when it shouldn't, or that the software is buggy, badly interpreting mouse signals.\nThe output of the commands you ran do not look suspicious to me, although I only glanced at it and didn't analyse it properly.\n", "Q: Monitor 1 turns off I just recently upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to 12.10.

I can't install it, it's the Intel 4 mobile chipset family.\n\nA: Well after seeing the video all I can say is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu loaded without any problems (Not even video problems)\n\n*Intel drivers, including for your mobile version are already installed automatically once you install Ubuntu. If they had any problems, you would not be able to even load the Desktop, the Unity Launcher or any other GUI parts that need video.\n\n*The video for me basically proved that you do have video. There is no need to install it (at least for Intel).

My desktop machine has an Intel i5 CPU with integrated graphics and a dedicated geforce card. Through blacklisting the nvidia driver in Linux and by using two cables, I'm planning to use the integrated intel card for Linux and the dedicated Nvidia card for Windows. Since  the whole idea is to consume less power when using Linux, I was wondering if anybody knows how much power the dedicated card will consume when it's not initialized and whether it might be necessary to unplug the power cable from it to really save on power consumption.\n\nA: Usually a discrete card will draw around 5W of power, which can be anything from 10-25% of the total power consumption of your laptop.

In addition you need ground connection. The others is more or less optional. This cable is commonly called a null modem cable, and can be had cheaply on e-bay, amazon and so on. Or you can make your own.\n\n*It has no state. The server doesn't know when there is a client listening. You thus has to inform the server to send something - or it will sit there waiting for input. Sending enter is a common way of getting some response. If it's sitting at the login prompt, this will provide some output.\n\n\nThis is the two most common pitfalls I've seen people make with serial connection. They're used to ssh or telnet, which has a state - and the server responds when connecting. Or they're used to modern cables, where it generally works if the cable fits.\nWith the advent of cheap computers like Raspberry Pi, a serial console may in a lot of cases be a convenient and cheap Out Of Band management system.\n\nA: For modern Ubuntus you can found an example here:\nhttps://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2343595\n", "Q: Is it possible for Ubuntu 12:10 to re-install my lost Windows 7 Home 64-bit,?

I have tried a few things already with windows with no success.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a Dell Desktop which came with NO Full Windows 7 Home 64-bit disk.\nDell provides users with what they call a \"re-Installation Disk of the OS already installed in your computer original HDD\".\n\n*I also made \"Rescue Disks #1 and #2\" as per their suggestion.\n\n*I downloads an ISO image of the windows 7 version i own. I also have the key code of my Windows activation with Microsoft\n\n\nI have tried to re-install with the Dell Data Safe, I tried reinstalling following detailed instructions both from Seven Forums community as well as Microsoft Forums.\nNothing worked.\nAside from the SSD which i had the Win OS installed and now also has Ubuntu 12:10 I also own another 7 HDDs of different sizes and Brands.\nI had the OS installed in more than just the SSD, in fact of all 8 disks only one boots Windows although after bypassing a boot error message.\nAll I want to do know is to recover (or reinstall) Win on the SSD\nSo my last 2 recourses left for me (ao so i think) are. \na. Use ubuntu to recover (if possible) and\nb. use the files still existent on the Recovery partition on the HDD that still boots to make a clean copy of a booting Windows 7 on the SSD/\nCould anyone help me with my situation?\nThank you kindly.\n\nA: As a straightforward solution and if you want to keep an Ubuntu installed, I suggest the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*use the windows iso together with the licensing key you have, burn it\nto a dvd and install as usual on your ssd... leave some room for\nubuntu though (10-15gig would be sufficent to play a bit with it now\nand then)\n\n*use the ubuntu live cd to install Ubuntu on the empty space. at the\nend of the installation ubuntu should take care of installing a\nbootloader and giving you the option to either startup windows or\nlinux\n\n*if using dell's recovery dvd it might be possible that it creates a checksum of your system and if something did change hardware wise, won't install because of licensing issues\n\n*additionally: you can always use a ubuntu live cd to access data of a windows installation that doesn't boot anymore, if you didn't\nchoose to use BitLocker encryption.. after bootup of the live cd you \nshould be able to browse through your \"windows data\" by just clicking\non the partition you installed it to in the file browser\n\n\nhope this helps!\n", "Q: Broadcom wireless doesn't work I installed Ubuntu 12.10, it works fine, but the wireless doesn't work. I have broadcom 4313.\n\nA: For the wireless card, you need to install a proprietary driver. Connect a cable to your computer (just needed once, to install the driver). Then do this from sofware-center:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*Go to Edit -> Software Sources\n\n*Select the last tab (Additional Drivers)\n\n*Under \"Broadcom Corporation BCM 4313\", select a driver other than \"Do not use the device\". \n\n*Click \"Apply changes\" to install the driver.\n\n", "Q: Can't boot from USB when installing Ubuntu I downloaded Ubuntu 11.10 32bit and put it in on USB drive using Universal USB Installer from http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ .\nI then restarted my laptop. I pressed Esc and chose \"Boot Management\", but there was no option for booting from USB. The only options I could see were boot from hard drive and boot from internal CD/DVD. What should I do?\nI have already changed the boot order at BIOS and it still didn't work.\nMy system is 64-bit, but does it matter if I want to install a Ubuntu 32-bit?\n\nA: You might need to try enabling \"legacy USB support\" in your BIOS then rebooting, then going in to the BIOS boot menu.\nAnother thing to try is to plug it into a different USB port, especially if you're currently plugging it into a hub or your computer separates its USB2/USB3 ports.\n\nMy system is 64bit, but does it matter if I want to install a Ubuntu 32bit?\n\nNope, that should work fine, though if you have more than 3GB RAM (or are likely to upgrade RAM in the future) I'd highly recommend using 64-bit in order to use it more efficiently.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 taking a very long time to install from Live DVD on a very fast desktop I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 from a DVD onto a very fast desktop. My first installation attempt was very slow, taking over an hour for the \"Copying files...\" stage. Then it seemed to stall completely when downloading updates. After it sat on the same step for a very long time I pulled the plug to start fresh.\nNow I am trying again; this time with the checkbox about installing package update UNCHECKED (since that seemed to be the straw that broke the camel's back last time). Again, the \"Copying files...\" stage is taking a very, very long time considering the speed of this desktop (including SSD).\nI expanded the console to try to find some clue about what's going on, but there's nothing useful there. No errors, just what seems like normal commands that are spaced way too far apart in time.\nFeb  7 21:07:05 ubuntu install.py: keeping language packs for: en_US.UTF-8\nFeb  7 21:17:01 ubuntu CRON[17922]: (root) CMD (   cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly)\n\nFrom 21:07 to 21:17, the only command shown is \"keeping language packs\"?!\nI don't know exactly what to ask, except:\nWhy is 12.10 installation from a live DVD so, so, so slow on a fast desktop?\n\nUpdate\nAdditionally, while stalled, there seems to be nothing happening, including no DVD spinning.\nUpdate 2\nThe second installation was just as slow as the first, despite skipping the update-packages step. I allowed it to finish and after the 2.5-3 hour install time things are working. After installation I began to have other problems like very slow 'apt-get update's and an extremely slow untar that took ~5-6 hours to extract a 16GB gzipped tar with default compression. More research has led me to worry that these problems may be caused by my SSD (Plextor PX-256M3) and/or EXT4's interaction with it. For reference, I previously had 12.04 installed using BTRFS (which had it's own host of insane problems). I tweaked several recommended SSD settings, including adding \"discard\" to /etc/fstab as well as the line\ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0\n\nand adding to cron.daily:\nsudo fstrim -v /\n\nMy next step is to upgrade the firmware for my SSD...\nUpdate 3\nAfter upgrading my SSD firmware I've still had lots of slowness related to disk activity. I decided to re-install after a week of painfully slow use and ran into the same problems again during installation. This time, I tried several different things including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install 12.10 32-bit from live DVD, with btrfs again (which worked well before my recent installations)\n\n*Install 12.04.2 32-bit from live DVD, with btrfs\n\n*Install 12.04.2 32-bit from USB disk image, with ext4\n\n\nAll of these failed. Hard. Insanely slow installs (I let the latest attempt of 12.04.2 32-bit go all night and it was 2/3 done) with nothing happening on the DVD drive or the USB drive.\nResolution\nAfter trying so many variations of things I was beginning to lose hope, but it struck me that all of my attempts had been with 32-bit Ubuntu. I downloaded the ISO for 12.04.2 64-bit this morning and it installed (with ext4) in less than 5 minutes, including downloading updates and third-party packages! Performance is great again and all is well.\n\nA: hp notebooks always have problem in reading Disc [i have hp dv6 ] yet it doesn't even read a simple CD disc always go with USB-stick because it is faster than DVD\n\nA: First, let me say, I reiterated the exact same question, to hopefully strengthen the effort to investigate.\nSecondly, I have constructed a successful method to overcome that hangup, but it resulted in a fresh install without saving my programs/files (which were already backed up).\nAfter an unsuccessful installation, I rebooted the Ubuntu secure-remix 64 bit ISO and restarted another installation attempt.  Shortly after electing \"Install Ubuntu\" there's a screen which asks \"quit\" as well as \"continue.\"  I hit the \"quit\" which caused the screen to blank for a brief moment, then the 12.10 Ubuntu screen opens up with the toolbar on the left.  Towards the bottom of the tools is \"UNINSTALL OS\" that eliminated the existing Ubuntu, and a button higher up restarted a fresh 12.10 Installation.  It repartitioned about 73Gb for 12.10 and installed quickly.  Where it had frozen previously was at the very end of the routine.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: The resolution for me was to install 64-bit Ubuntu instead of 32-bit. I tried many combinations of Ubuntu versions and filesystems which all failed miserably, but installing 64-bit 12.04.2 with ext4 finished in less than 5 minutes and performance is great.\nI'd love to know why 32-bit failed so miserably, especially since the Ubuntu download site so clearly \"recommends\" it...\n", "Q: Mysql Server shuts down periodically on ubuntu Mysql Server shuts down periodically on Ubuntu.  I looked through the system log file and found the following lines in the log files i checked :\n Out of memory: Kill process 719 (mysqld) score 114 or sacrifice child\n\nWe are however using just about 20% of the allocated memory. \nWhat could be the cause of this problem? \n\nA: It says what is wrong right in the error message. It is out of memory.\nIt could be a 32-bit application with 2–3 GB memory restriction that 32-bit apps have. You can run file $(which mysqld) and see whether the output mentions x86-64 or 32-bit/i386.\nOr there could be a upper limit on the server. Check the configuration in /etc/mysql/my.cnf and look at the upper memory limits.\n\nA: It's also always a good idea to check for the biggest tables or tables with the biggest overhead via localhost/phpmyadmin (if installed). Sometimes it's just a matter of cleaning the caches of a cms (if you're using mysql for a CMS) and looking for overhead and get rid of it via phpmyadmin\nadditionally if this helps and your are using mysql for a cms that is causing the problems it might be necessary to check the caching policies and setup a cron job to clean caches periodically\n", "Q: Failing backup, Ubuntu 12.04 after I installed Ubuntu 12.04, my automatic backup hasn't been working.

I installed Ubuntu 12.10 onto an external hard drive after I partitioned it and everything went well.

I received the no such device grub rescue error when I booted. \nI tried boot option, the external hard drive was not option so now I'm stuck using the Ubuntu disk.

If you can boot off the live media, you can reinstall grub to the external usb disk, and that should fix the grub config file.  You can also edit the grub boot commands (commands on screen to edit and boot) to fix the wrong devices.  For the last few years, the fix was to simply reduce the disk letter or number by one, and upon successful boot, immediately run\n sudo update-grub\n\nWith 12.10, the wrong device has changed, it may even be sda (which is usualy the internal hard disk).  In 12.10, I have started seeing the disk lettering change, with the internal hard disk sometimes sdb instead of sda -- not even consistent.  But after the update-grub, UUIDs will be used, and the disk letter will no longer matter.  Feel free to add yourself to the bug, and maybe someday it will be fixed. \n\nA: Here is what you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn an Ubuntu ISO image onto a USB Drive or a DVD to make a Live USB/DVD.\n\n*Boot into Live mode (\"Try Ubuntu\" option).\n\n*After it boots up, press \"Ctrl + Alt + T\" to bring up the Terminal.\n\n*Put these codes ONE AFTER ANOTHER.\n\n\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\n\n\n*\n\n*After doing this, open the \"Dash\" (Search menu). It can be accessed by \"Alt + F2\"\n\n*Search for \"Boot Repair\" (Although just entering Boot will give you the app).\n\n*Open it and select the only option (Recommended one).\n\n*Reboot. You will no longer get the GRUB Error after this, and will boot straight into Windows.\nYou can also do it with Ubuntu installed.

Typically it will create one of these, but not both:\n\n\n*\n\n*a traditional root user\n\n*a non-root user that has sudo permissions\nLong answer\nThe oem-config command is a symbolic link to ubiquity, Ubuntu's standard installer. Ubiquity runs the script user-setup-ask-oem to determine how user accounts should be configured, and then the script user-setup-apply to actually create them.\nThe configuration script begins by asking whether a root user should be created:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you answer yes, you have the option to also create a non-root user.\n\n*If you answer no, you are forced to create a non-root user.\n\n\nLater on, the account creation script checks to see if you have decided to create a root user:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have, a root user is created with traditional, implicit administrative privileges. If you have also opted to create a non-root user, that user is created without sudo permissions.\n\n*If you've decided not to create a root user, the non-root user is created with sudo permissions.\n\n\nThis behavior can be complicated by preeseed configurations.\n\nA: Ubuntu now uses the sudo group rather then the admin group for sudo access.\nPost the output of:\nid <user>\n\nWhere user is the user created with the oem-config ;)\nSee also What is the difference between the 'sudo' and 'admin' group?\n", "Q: Using native connection while still connected to a vpn I'm setting up a vpn server on a remote development server.

How can I make it so that only traffic going to certain addresses are sent through the vpn, and all other requests go through my native connection?\nIt's a little hard to explain so feel free to ask me for more info.\n\nA: I believe you're talking about split-tunneling. Depending on the application/VPN in question, this could be an option in the server configuration. \nWith OpenVPN, I'm not sure if this is the default.  If you aren't sure what routing is being pushed to the client, it would be easiest just to run a route command on the client to see where it think the default is.  You'll really only want the vpn gateway set as a route for the development server(s).  Everything else should default to whatever the normal gateway for the client is.\n", "Q: Run Xswipe at startup I want to run Xswipe for my xps 13 (sputnik) build.\nI have added it to gnome-session-properties.\nThe command is:\nperl ~/xSwipe-master/xSwipe.pl\n\nBut it does not run at startup.\nAny ideas?\nThanks\n\nA: I'm pretty sure what you add to the gnome-session-properties is equivalent to a command run by using Alt+F2 and running a command.

I'm trying to jailbreak my iPod touch with a tool called evasi0n.\nI have downloaded the package, but I have no idea how to run/install it. I am trying to do this on a Dell Latitude D830 with an Intel Core 2 Duo and 4GB of ram.  \n\nA: I just figured it out:\nGo into the downloads folder, and extract it. Go into the folder, and the one that says evasi0n, click on it, and a window will open up. Just choose \"open with terminal\".  A terminal window will pop up, and then the evasi0n window will. \n\nA: There's another way to install evasi0n on Ubuntu rather than downloading from the website. This way is a bit better (In my opinion) as you will get updates for it in the Software Updater every time the team updates the tool. \nTo install Evasi0n in Ubuntu 12.10/12.04,  open Terminal (Press Ctrl + Alt + T) and copy the following commands in the Terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/evasion\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install evasion-linux\n\nThen, to open it, go to the dash, and type evasi0n.\n", "Q: Are there any PC-98 emulators for Ubuntu?

I am using Ubuntu 12.10 with Gnome-Shell from the gnome-3-team/gnome3 ppa.\nThis is working great, and I have my custom theme setup.\nThe only issue I am running into is that Gnome-Shell seems to forget the theme after every reboot.\nIf I open gnome-tweak-tool the correct theme is selected, however it is not applied; if I select anything else and then re-select the theme it is then applied correctly.\nWhat could be causing this? It does not seem to be related to a specific theme, as I am getting the issue with both Mountain Shell and Elegance Colours.\n\nA: After a quick debug of selectively disabling extensions it came down to my initial attempt at fixing/tweaking the original gnome-shell theme.\nSpecifically the installation of the remove rounded corners extension.\nWhile toggling this extension I noticed that every time I re-enabled it my shell theme would revert back to default. so un-installing does the trick.\n", "Q: Which Java package should I use: OpenJDK or Oracle JDK?

I want to know if there is any difference between OpenJDK 7 and Oracle's JDK 7. Are they basically the same? Thanks. \n\nA: OpenJDK is the default version of Java that Ubuntu uses and is the easiest to install while Oracle Java 7 is Oracle's own version of Java 7. \nYou can read Ubuntu Java Documentation.\nOpenJDK: \"Oracle makes the OpenJDK source code available under an open-source licensing model.

Or what my next troubleshooting step would be?\n\nA: You probably have not created a filesystem on the partitions; see man mkfs.ntfs. Just setting the partition type is not enough.\n\nA: First of all, you don't want to use NTFS unless you are dual booting with Windows.  For sharing files with samba to Windows or other clients, you are better off using a normal filesystem like ext4.\nSecond, you are better off with a single raid array than letting lvm stripe over multiple raid1s.  A raid5 or 6 will give you the most usable space with good performance.  The raid6 can handle two disks failing without data loss.  A raid10 will give the same space as what you proposed, but better performance.  You should use the offset or far layout depending on whether you want to optimize for writes or reads.\n", "Q: How to free the Print key I would like to use the Print key for my own purpose.

I am new to linux and brought up a server on ubuntu 12.10.  I wanted to try KVM so I setup /etc/network/interfaces correctly for a bridge.  As I learned a little more about the networking tools, I decided to use ethtool to change the speed of the bridge.  I happened to place the ethtool command in the wrong location in the file and now the entire server boots to a screwed up GUI and I don't know how to recover.  I could reinstall the server but I am really tired of doing that with ubuntu.  I think the problem is that ubuntu doesn't like my Radeon 7400 graphics card or something so it is really hard to get installed in the first place since it gives a blank screen half the time.  Now, after making this change to the the interfaces file, it screwed up the entire display.   How in the world does changing a network config screw up the entire graphics display?  I am pretty unimpressed with ubuntu at this point.  It seems very unstable and difficult to install.  Any thoughts on how I might recover without another reinstall?  I tried using a live CD but it won't work because it can't seem to recognize the graphics card to give me any type of display.\n\nA: Found a solution.  Instead of messing with the Graphics detection, I learned how to use the recovery features.  Basically reboot and immediately started pressing ESC until my BIOS interface came up.  One of the options is to Continue Startup.  Selected Continue Startup and immediately started pressing ESC again.  This brought me into the boot manager menu where I could select\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu \n\n*Advanced Options for Ubuntu \n\n*Access System Setup (basically taking me back to the BIOS setup)\n\n\nI selected Advanced Options.  On the next menu, I selected recovery mode.  It will run for a few minutes spitting a bunch of messages to the screen.  Eventually I  got a recovery menu with a host of options.  Many of these looked useful.  One option was to boot in graphics safe mode but I did not use it.   Since I knew that reverting my last /etc/network/interfaces change would fix the problem, I selected the recovery menu “Drop to root shell prompt”.  At that point the file system was mounted readonly which prevented the changing of any config files.  So I used the \"mount all\" command.  This mounted the hard drive with rw permissions for root.  I then opened the config file in vim editor, made the changes and rebooted the system.\n", "Q: Can't adjust screen brightness on Ubuntu 12.04LTS My laptop is Samsung NP-Q430-JS03US. \nI have searched for the solution.

That means that it has two video cards: an Intel card and a Nvidia one (meant to be used for games only). This is problematic because Optimus has been designed to work with Microsoft Windows, and Ubuntu won't play very good with it.\nPlease check your BIOS setup, whether the Optimus option is enabled or not --if there's even any Optimus settings. \nWith Optimus enabled, your display will be managed by the Intel card. The brightness controls should work out-of-the-box. The Nvidia card will be fully-powered all the time though, and you need to setup Bumblebee to avoid this and to be able to use the Nvidia card for gaming.\nWith Optimus disabled, your display will be managed by the Nvidia card, and you'll lose the brightness controls, since the Nvidia card is not capable of accessing them.\n\nA: I believe you should sudo open /etc/default/grub, find the line that starts with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and make it look like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash pcie_aspm=force acpi_osi=Linux i915.i915_enable_rc6=1″\n\n\nA: I have a Samsung NP300E5a with Optimus.

What implications does this have for my continued Windows usage and for when I may remove the Ubuntu installation later?\nLonger: I was running just Win 7 x64, then installed Ubuntu 12.10 along side it. Was trying to boot back to Windows 7 only to get a \"disc reading error.\" Booted back to Ubuntu, grabbed boot-repair, then used mbr repair in boot-repair. System could then boot back to Windows but in fact always did so directly, i.e. always by-passed Ubuntu. Then I used the Ubuntu LiveCD to get boot-repair and used the \"Recommended\" repair option. Now everything works normally except for the issue described here. Both Windows options in Grub boot to the same Win installation I had previously.\np.s. Running \"sudo update-grub\" maintains both the Windows options.\n\nA: \nI'm getting 2 Windows boot options: \"on dev/sda1\" and \"on dev/sda2\".\n  What does this mean?\n\nDon't worry, what you observe is normal and common.\nThese 2 Windows entries in the GRUB menu both boot Windows the same way. \nI can tell you how to remove/hide one entry if you indicate the URL provided by Boot-Repair.\n\nWhat implications does this have for my continued Windows usage and\n  for when I may remove the Ubuntu installation later?\n\nNo bad implication. You can use Windows normally whatever the Windows entry you choose. And you can uninstall Ubuntu in 1 click via OS-Uninstaller.\n", "Q: Can I run OpenGL 3.3 or higher (with or without HW acceleration) on 12.10 with Intel graphics?

They are still working towards getting GL 3.1 ready in Mesa 9.1. \nAlso I am sorry that I am unaware of any methods to use Software rendering for the same.\nGiven that, your best bet would be to use your inbuilt AMD card with Catalyst 13.1 as AMD already supports upto OpenGL 4.2. I am specifically recommending Catalyst 13.1 because it supports Xorg 1.13 properly, (which was not the case in the previous driver releases) , which means you will no longer have trouble logging in your Ubuntu 12.10 desktop. \nHere is the download link for the same\nTo install, either you can directly run the installer file, which works just fine, but this is a better way to install Catalyst driver by generating .deb files , so that you would not have any trouble removing the drivers if you wish to.\nLastly, I am doubtful if you can get hybrid graphics working in Catalyst 13.1 , which mostly seems hit and miss and highly unpredictable in the binary blob, in that case your safest bet is to use Catalyst 12.10 but then you will have to downgrade your Xorg version to 1.12.\n", "Q: How can I change the number of workspaces in `Workspace Grid` extension?

I think it is because I can't use a newer version of Gnome Shell. Currently, I'm using GNOME Shell 3.2.2.1.\nHow can I change the number of workspaces without using the configuration button?\n\nA: As you can see at mathematicalcoffee BitBucket page, you can change this configuration through the extension.js file. \nFirst, find your Workspace Grid folder inside the extensions folder.

Would you guys tell me the procedure of reading the file? Thanks.\n\nA: If you want to read the files on-the-fly from your (gzip) compressed filesystem without having to unpack it, use mksquasfs and dd to create it in the first place.\nYou can also choose the compression with the -comp option of mksquashfs, e.g. gzip, lzo, xz etc.\nSee this answer on how to do it (backup/create image, mount one partition of a whole diskimage with the help of kpartx, etc.).\n\nA: Are you sure it's not a .dd.gz file?\nHere's how you uncompress a gzipped file:\ngunzip example.dd.gz\n\nThis should create a file named example.dd in your current working directory.\nTo mount a dd image file, create a directory, and mount the image to that directory:\n$ mkdir exampledir/\n$ mount -o loop example.dd exampledir/\n\nYou may need to specify more options to the mount command depending on what type of image your file is.\nYou can now view the files inside the image by browsing exampledir/.\n", "Q: How to make Shutter as the default screenshot tool? I have shutter 0.90 on my Ubuntu 12.04 machine (installed via PPA). I would like to use it as my default screenshot tool with the Print shortcut key. But I can't find the option in Shutter. It should be in Preferences -> Keyboard, but I don't see the Keyboard option there. I also tried to make a shortcut in Ubuntu with shutter -f. It doesn't work too.\nWhat can I do to use shutter when I press the Print key?\n\nA: I am not using Ubuntu 15.10 Unity Distro. So the the Gnome Compatibility tool of compiz just didn't worked for me. So I used Michael's method (above). Go to All Settings -> Keyboard -> Screenshots.\n\nThen at first disable the \"Take a Screenshot\", \"Take a screenshot of a window\" and \"Take a screenshot of an area\" options by clicking on the options and pressing backspace.\nAnd then go to \"Custom Shortcuts\" option and click on the plus button to add a new shortcut. To create screenshot for the whole desktop write the command \"shutter-f\" and and to take a particular area screenshot write the command \"shutter-s\". \n\nNow after creating two Custom Shortcuts you have to assign the key to these Custom Shortcuts. Click on the \"Disabled\" area and press the key that you want to assign to this function. I recommend to use \"Print\" Key for full screen captor and \"Shift+Print\" for an area to captor.\nClose the window, and then you are good to go... \n\nSimilarly you can even use gnome-screenshot tool. Just use \"gnome-screenshot\" command for full screen shot and use \"gnome-screenshot -a\" command for using the tool for an area. You can also use\"gnome-screenshot -w\" command for capturing a specific window.\nI actually use gnome-screenshot tool because I it is way more fast and light weight. But it has less feature.\n\nA: For Unity (up to Ubuntu 17.04)\nWe need to install CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM) to bind Print and Alt + Print to Shutter. Follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Install compizconfig-settings-manager .\n\n\n*Open Dash (press Super) and query for ccsm and hit Enter to run CompizConfig Settings Manager.\n\n\n\n*Under the General Category, you would find the option called Gnome Compatibility. Click on it (not the Checkbox beside it, ie; keep the checkmark activated).\n\n\n\n*Now switch to the Commands Tab and modify the text fields as shown in the following image.\n\n\n\n*Explanation of previous step. You can run man shutter in terminal to see what are the different CAPTURE MODE OPTIONS available.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Screenshot command line: shutter -f - This captures the entire screen. Activated when you press Print.\n\n*Window screenshot command line: shutter -a - This captures the current active window. Activated when you press Alt + Print.\n\nEnjoy taking screenshots with Shutter!!\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04: for some reason neither \"CompizConfig ⇒ Gnome Compatibility\" nor \"All Settings ⇒ Keyboard ⇒ Screenshots\" worked for me. One thing that helped me was to define custom global shortcuts. I went to \"All Settings ⇒ Keyboard ⇒ Screenshots\" and removed all conflicting bindings on a \"Print\" key, which I was going to use.\n\nThen in the same window I opened a \"Custom Shortcuts\" section and created two custom shortcuts for Shutter.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Full screen with Shutter – shutter -f\n\n*Take a screenshot of an area with Shutter – shutter -s\n\nA: Without installing anything other than shutter, go into system settings, then keyboard, click the shortcuts tab, click custom shortcuts, then the + button to add for example, the following custom command :  \n. . name = shutter -f  \n. . command = shutter -f -e -o 'Desktop/%name_%T.png'  \n\nand click the apply button.  Now click that new line in the list of custom commands and hit the print screen key.  This will reassign the key to take a snapshot using shutter.\nTo see the shutter options, type man shutter into a terminal screen.  My example takes a full screen screenshot and saves it to the desktop with no other user interaction needed.\nOther useful options are to replace the -f with -a for the active window, and with -s for a selectable rectangular portion of the screen.\nHaving taken some screenshots you can use them directly from the desktop (or wherever you saved them to) or annotate them etc by opening the shutter program itself, in which they appear.\n\nA: For GNOME Shell (Ubuntu 18.04+)\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> Devices -> Keyboard\n\n*Find Save a screenshot to Pictures and disable the Print Keybinding  (otherwise it doesn't let you reassign the Print Key.\n\n*Add a new Custom Shortcut at the bottom\n\n*Enter any name and the command shutter -s for area selection.\n\n*Assign the Print Key.\n\n*Click Add at the top.\n\nAlternatively, to send directly to disk:\n# Full screen, exit after capture, no session\nshutter -f -e -n -o screenshot_%Y-%m-%d_%T.png\n\n# Active window, exit after capture, no session  \nshutter -a -e -n -o screenshot_%Y-%m-%d_%T.png\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 has a screenshot section now. Doesn't answer your question, but it's a simple alternative.\n\n\nA: For ubuntu 17.10, all the above solutions did not work for me.\nEven when I disabled the default mappings and added custom ones (as outlined in the second answer), it didn't work.\nTo make it work, I did this:\n\n\n*\n\n*start ccsm\n\n*deselect Gnome compatibility\n\n*Select Commands\n\n*Add a command and a corresponding key binding e.g. shutter -f\n\nA: To share 1/24/2019 since I also use this For Ubuntu 18.04.1\nGo to settings - > Keyboard -> Screenshots\n* Change the default \"Save a screenshot to pictures\" with something else (other key combination)\nThen go below to add a custom shortcut\nAs of this writing Im using shutter. ;)\nshutter command\n\nA: I'd suggest using a custom shortcut instead of trying to replace the default PrintSc, as this CCSM seems too much of a hassle. I know this doesn't answer the original ques but for Linux noobies such as myself I'd say:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Devices > Keyboard\n\n*Scroll down then add a custom shortcut   +  \n\n*In the Command section add shutter -a to capture the current active window or if u need to capture some specific application window all the time: shutter --window=.*VLC.* will always look for any VLC media player tabs (even when they running in background)\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 20.10:\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Screenshots\n\n*Remove the \"print screen\" shortcut\n\n*Scroll down and click the +\n\n*\n\n*Name: Save a screenshot\n\n*Command: shutter -f -e -n -o screenshot_%Y-%m-%d_%T.png\n\n*Shortcut: Print Screen\n\n\n\n", "Q: How do I install Unity Web apps from the software repositories? I found .deb files in my cache for some webapps I installed. Then I used apt-get to install some other web apps. But the icons aren't showing up on the unity bar. How do I rectify this?\n\nA: After you install a WebApp, it doesn't get added to your Unity Launcher like normal applications do. You actually have to visit the website in your browser and enabled/install it on that website. When you visit a website supported by or supports WebApps, you should get a little option bar or panel that asks you if you want to install or enable WebApps for that website. Once you click yes, you should see the icon appear in your Unity launcher and Dash. If you don't get an option bar/panel then most likely you have the website blacklisted. \nRemove an “excluded” WebApp website in Firefox:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Edit – Preferences – General \n\n*Under “Desktop Integration” click the Exceptions button\n\n*Make sure the website you are trying to use is removed from that list.\n\n*Restart your browser and revisit the website.\n\n\nNote, by default, Firefox is the only browser that supports Unity WebApps; however, you can install an extension to allow Chromium to work as well.

Or change them to whatever makes them a bit more distinguishable.  \nCurrently, it looks like this:  \n\nThis is the elementary XFCE style for the icons. Ironically, the Elementary XFCE dark theme is a bit better, but still, the bluetooth and Dropbox icons are pretty dark. It's not easy on the eyes, IMHO. Same goes for the workspaces switcher. The workspaces are only distinguishable because I know where they are and there is a single blue mark on the active one.\nWould anyone happen to have any sort of advice on how to improve this issue from my perspective? (I am asking this specific way since I imagine some of you are fine with it.)\n\nA: A common problem when users change away from default settings is that something unintended could happen. In this particular instance, a change in the icon theme leads to poor contrast of some icons with the background of the panel.\nThe simplest option is to modify the panel background color to the extent required.\nOr, if one is by and large happy with the icon theme and panel background, and also has other icon  themes available, a little searching in other icon themes may help find a replacement for the troublesome icon.

(I know, possible in Ubuntu, this n that, but for ease atm wanting to keep it with Win8). \nSo. How to install both on this little thing?\nI've found a way into the BIOS (before splash screen, mash F2. Works only after reboot, not cold boot). But the whole boot loading setup is different than from what I know, and I must've messed up something because it's been \"Attempting Repairs\", \"Analyzing hard disk\", and a bunch of other things for the past 15 minutes.

I left the Recovery partition (you never know...). Of course, the new Windows Installation dit not like this. Apparantly Windows cannot be installed on a GPT hard disk. Remember I hadn't changed the partition table, was still factory default! Minus a few partitions, granted. So deleted ALL partittions, did a format of the disk, created a new partition.

The easiest solution is to run my FixParts utility; it will detect the stray GPT data and offer to delete it. Tell it to do so and then exit FixParts. You'll need to download and use the Windows version of FixParts, manually install a FixParts package in the \"try before using\" Ubuntu boot, or run FixParts from an emergency disc like Parted Magic.\n", "Q: Wireless with visible ssid not visible in network menu.

The MacBook Air 4,1 has a Broadcom BCM43224 chip, which is actually covered by several different drivers, b43 (if you hack around a bit), brcmsmac, and the wl Broadcom STA driver (closed source). Poking around seems to suggest that the best option is the brcmsmac module, as it is based off the open-sourced driver that Broadcom released late 2010, however owing to it’s immaturity, it still lives in the staging drivers section of the Linux kernel. It also seems to lack some features supported by the Broadcom STA drivers, namely power management, which is the main reason why I chose to use the closed source (the horror) Broadcom STA drivers available from the Ubuntu “restricted” repository under the brcmwl-kernel-source package.\nThe one item to note with this module is that the brcmwl-kernel-source package actually doesn’t have an updated blacklist file in /etc/modprobe.d, and will fail to blacklist the brcmsmac module available by default, potentially leading to problems. I had to add brcmsmac and bcma to the blacklist with the following:\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'blacklist brcmsmac' >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-b43.conf\"\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'blacklist bcma' >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-b43.conf\"\n\nThis prevents the kernel from loading both drivers.\nMore about your issue: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=698697\n\nA: I had to change my wifi radio channel to channel 9, and it magically appears on the network dropdown.

I performed a clean installation of ubuntu 12.10 on one disk.\nHow can I convert the running system to boot off a (software) raid5 comprised of all three disks (one of these is in use running the system)?\nIs it possible to start a raid 5 md device in degraded mode using 2 disks(disks 2&3), copy the data over from disk1, boot of of 2&3 (raided 5) and then add disk1 into the md device and let them resync? If possible, how would I got about doing this? what are the steps I need to perform? and if possible, do you know of a tutorial I can follow?\n[I know something similar is possible if you want to boot off of a RAID 1, you started a degraded device and add the first disk later]\nThanks.\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup.\n\n*Test the backup.\n\n*If needed, install mdadm\n\n*Create a RAID 5 array with mdadm --create --level=5 missing /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1Adjust drives or partitions as needed.\n\n*Format the new array (mkfs -t ext2 /dev/mdx).\n\n*Copy all data to the new array. rsync -av --exclude-from=excludefile /source/ /destination/ might come in handy since you do not want to copy /dev/ :)\n\n*Setup your bootloaded (grub2?) to boot from the new array.\n\n*Reboot and test.\n\n*Add the old drive to the degraded array. This will fail if you have the drive in use at the time of adding. (So make sure it is not mounted from step 6, or reboot to a liveCD).\n\n\nA: Take a look at:\nhttp://raider.sourceforge.net/\nSeems to do what you are looking for.\n\nA: Even if you could come up with a means of doing this, you will face several issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*RAID 5 is never recommended today.  It is effectively a deprecated technology, avoid completely.\n\n*RAID 5 should not be used in a three drive array, it is highly inefficient at this scale.  No array size is good for RAID 5 but it gets worse at smaller spindle counts.\n\n*One of the biggest risks of RAID 5 is its high likelihood of failing during an array rebuild. So starting from a degraded position means that you are in a position of doing this because you can't risk your data being offline while at the same time putting yourself into a position of being extremely likely to lose your entire array before it finishes rebuilding.\n\n\nMove to RAID 1 with two drives.  Or use all three in RAID 1.  Avoid RAID 5.\nhttp://www.smbitjournal.com/2012/11/choosing-a-raid-level-by-drive-count/\nhttp://www.smbitjournal.com/2012/07/hot-spare-or-a-hot-mess/\n\nA: RAID 5 requires at minimum, 3 disks.  RAID 1 only mirrors data between two disks, whereas RAID 5 formats data in such a way that part of its data is stored across all three disks.  In my mind, you will need at least one more disk.\nI'm not very linux-ey, but this is what I'd do under Windows.  If you have a LiveCD which supports the Software RAID you're trying to set up, I would first make sure the image is set up with the required drivers, image the drive under LiveCD, build the RAID, and then re-image your Linux system to the RAID.  From here you may need to do a fix to the bootsector (should be doable under LiveCD), and make any necessary changes to the boot config.\nNote: followed this from Serverfault :P hence why a non-linux guy is posting on askubuntu\nHope this helps,\n", "Q: netbook slow on ubuntu (and win 7). Tips and tricks for speeding up My computer just broke down so I got a new one on second hand because I need one in the mean time while it's on repair. I got a 10\" Dell Inspiron mini 1012.\nHowever, it's slow. Really slow. Usually when I open like 10 tabs with just text in chrome it freezes and becomes unresponsive.\nThe computer was completely wiped and came with a brand new Windows 7 starter edition freshly installed. I tried installing Ubuntu 12.10 on it and it was a little bit faster but it's still slow and becomes unresponsive a lot of times.\nI'm thinking of buying some extra RAM for it (updating from 1 g to 2 g). However I'm wondering if this would help. Is it probable that it is the low ram that makes it slow or could it be that it is something else, like the hard drive being worn out because it is second hand? \nAre there any Ubuntu tweaks I can do that can make the installation lighter?  Or if not, any other Linux distro that might be good for my particular computer. I know that Ubuntu had a netbook edition before but from what I understand the two merged.\nI sort of can't get my head around why it's so slow because my other laptop had like 2 g of RAM and a similar speed on the processor and I have no problem running seven YouTube videos simultaneously while doing other stuff. With this, however, running only 1 YouTube video often lags.\nWhat do you think?  Is the extra gig of RAM worth it or will it still be slow on account of it being a netbook and being cheap? \nSpecs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Chipset: Intel® Atom NM10 Express  \n\n*CPU speed: 1.66 GHz  \n\n*RAM memory: 1 GB  \n\n*Wireless: Dell™ Wireless 1397 802.11g Half mini-card  \n\n*Bluetooth: Dell Wireless 365 Bluetooth Internal (2.1) mini-card  \n\n*Integrated network connector 10/100 LAN (RJ45)  \n\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.10 is actually really slow. If you really really like unity interface i would recommend you to first try 12.04 version, cause is faster than 12.10, and it's a long time support. It also has a 2D unity interface which is better for old computers. If it's still slow using that, or if you don't like unity that much, i would strongly recommend to use Lubuntu 12.10. It's waaaay faster, everything loads almost immediately. I'm running a netbook with 1gb RAM and lubuntu, and it works faster than a laptop with 4gb RAM running ubuntu. \n", "Q: Permission denied for using some files or copying files to desktop Sometimes ago i experienced couple of errors in my Ubuntu 12.10 and i was getting the permission denied error in a lot of Softwares.

I have Ubuntu installed in Virtualbox. I want to mount my VirtualBox shared folder in Ubuntu automatically when I log in Ubuntu. I put the following line in my ~./bashrc and ~/.bash_profile:\nsudo mount -t vboxsf windows_share /media/windows_share\n\nwhere windows_share is the name I created with Virtualbox. But everytime I start my Ubuntu, it asks me for passwd since it needs sudo. Is there anyway to automatically mount Windows share without entering password every time I log in?\n\nA: For newer systemd based systems you need alternative approaches - the simplest being one mentioned in another answer to another question - which basically says that you need to add a special comment option to the /etc/fstab entry:\nsrc     /my_mount/src_host  vboxsf  auto,rw,comment=systemd.automount 0 0\n\nHowever for the above to work on some systems you need to check the 'Auto-mount' box in  VirtualBox's Shared Folders->Add dialogue, which means you can end up with a few duplicate mounts of the directory.\nFor a cleaner mount - without duplicate directories nor the need for 'Auto-mount' - you need to use systemd's mount and automount directives. To do so create two entries in /usr/lib/systemd/system/ named after your desired mount point e.g. to match the fstab mount point above they would be named my_mount-src_host.mount and contain:\n[Unit]\nDescription=VirtualBox shared \"src\" folder\n\n[Mount]\nWhat=src\nWhere=/my_mount/src_host \nType=vboxsf\nOptions=defaults,noauto,uid=1000,gid=1000\n\nand my_mount-src_host.automount:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Auto mount shared \"src\" folder\n\n[Automount]\nWhere=/my_mount/src_host\nDirectoryMode=0775\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nThen they need enabling:\nsudo systemctl enable  my_mount-src_host.automount\nsudo systemctl enable  my_mount-src_host.mount\n\nThey will now mount on boot. If you want mount them immediately (provided the Shared Folders have been created) you can do so:\nsudo systemctl start  my_mount-src_host.mount\n\nNote if you have directories with odd names or dashes (-) in them then use systemd-escape to find the appropriately escaped name. \n\nA: After an exhausting morning trying all the above in Ubutntu 16.04 running in Virtualbox 5.0.20 unsuccessfully (particularly disappointed that the rc.local solution didn't work), it worked by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Registering from Shared Folders menu of Virtualbox GUI the required directory but NOT automounting it or permanent mounting from Virtualbox. Otherwise the host dir is mounted by root and it's a pain to access by non-root users even from the admin group.\n\n*adding simple entry in fstab:\n[VirtuablBoxNameOfMount] /media/[guestOSuser]/[mountSubdir]    vboxsf   rw, noauto   0     1\n\nNote noauto option - otherwise boot loader fails as has been noted.\n\n*Add corresponding line to /etc/sudoers as follows by using command visudo from within guest OS:\nALL ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/mount /media/[guestOSuser]/[mountSubdir]/\n\nThis will allow non-root processes to specifically mount this (as fstab can't mount with 'user' option ...)\n\n\n*Add corresponding line to .profile of user:\nsudo mount /media/[guestOSuser]/[mountSubdir]/\n\nNow the selected host subdir is ready-mounted for the selected user upon login!\n\nA: I tried the rc.local solution but couldn't get it to work.\nHowever I discovered the problem seems to be related to the folder you run the command from (no idea why).

It is up to personal preference which option works best in our setting.\n1. Mount with fstab\nTo mount a shared folder using the vboxsf filesystem provided with Guest Additions we first need to make sure prerequisites are met. Then we may put the following line in our etc/fstab file:\n<name_of_share>   /path/to/mountpoint   vboxsf   <options>  0   0\n\nReplace name_of_share and /path/to/mountpoint with your individual setup (the directory for the mountpoint has to be created first). See the manpage for mount <options>. One possibility is to mount with defaults, or to give specific mount options (e.g. rw, suid, exec, auto, users).\nOn some systems the vboxsf kernel module is not yet loaded at the time fstab is read on boot. It may then help to append the vboxsf kernel module to /etc/modules.\nSome systems may need option comment=systemd.automount in their fstab entry (source).\n2. Mount with Virtual Box \"automatic mounting\":\nIn recent releases of Virtual Box we can also automatically mount shared folders on creation:\n\nAfter a reboot of the guest this shared folder will be mounted to the guest directory /media/<username>/sf_<name_of_share> accessible to all users who had been made member of the group vboxsf.\n\nA: (In my case, my host OS is Mac OS X and my guest OS is ubuntu)\nNone of the above solutions, and the solutions mentioned here and here worked for me. There was a problem with all of them.\nHere is what I finally did to solve the issue:\n1- I created a shared folder in VirtualBox UI, pointing to a folder named VMShares in my Mac OS, naming it wd \n2- Then I installed Ubuntu Guest Addition tools (restart required)\n3- Then I made a folder in my guest OS as the mount point (in my case the name was /home/fashid/host)\n4- Then I ran:\nsudo VBoxControl sharedfolder list\n\nThis was the command to be ensured that the share is available to the guest OS, meanwhile you still need to mount it in your guest OS to make it actually available.\nIt will show something like:\nShared Folder mappings (1):\n01 - VMShares\n\nThis is the trick! It is showing the actual name you need to put in below command to actually mount it and make it available in your guest OS:\nsudo mount -t vboxsf VMShares /home/farshid/myshares\n\nDid you realize the point? I did not use wd anywhere later. In step 3, I needed to pickup the actual (host) folder name instead of the arbitrary name I asigned in GUI dialog box.\nVia above steps, my issue was solved.\n\nA: I recently encountered this thread when, after updating to Ubuntu LTS-18 (and making no changes whatever to VirtualBox, and after reinstalling the extensions and blah-de-blah), auto-mount stopped working.  The sf_xxx directories were present in /media/ but none of them were actually mounted.\nAttempts to mount them in /etc/fstab (as suggested by VirtualBox's own documentation) didn't work:  the boot failed into \"emergency mode,\" even when I had modified the /etc/modules file.\nWhat did eventually work – although I regard it as a stinkin' hack – is the crontab trick described above.\nTo this day, I have no idea \"what broke.\"\n\nA: I was having an issue where I could see the shared folder, but there were no files in it.  So I did a hack similar to what was shown above:\nI made sure that my user was in the correct group(s), and that there was an entry in fstab for mounting the share, and that the permissions were set correctly, and that auto-mount was on in VirtualBox settings, but still no files to be seen.\nSo I opened up the Startup Applications app in the Ubuntu 18.04 GUI and created a task that simply ran \"sudo mount -a\" right at startup.  For whatever reason the shared folder was not being mounted correctly when fstab was automatically parsed at boot, so re-mounting everything seemed to fix the problem.  Now I can see the files in the share.\n\nA: I tried all of the solutions here and none worked.\nWhat worked was to install supervisor and run a python script.\ninstall supervisor\napt-get install supervisor\npython script (mine was at /home/ubuntu/shared_folders.py)\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport time\n\nshared_folder = '/home/ubuntu/shared'\n\nfile_count = len(os.listdir(shared_folder))\n\nmnt_command = 'mount -t vboxsf -o rw,uid=1000,gid=1000 shared-folder ' + shared_folder\nif file_count == 0:\n        # mount\n        subprocess.Popen(mnt_command, shell=True)\n\ntime.sleep(3600)\n\ncreate config file for supervisor\nnano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/sharedfolders.conf\n[program:shared_folders]\ncommand=python shared_folders.py\ndirectory=/home/ubuntu\nprocess_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)s\nnumprocs=1\nnumprocs_start=0\nautostart=true\nautorestart=true\nstartsecs=1\nstartretries=3\nexitcodes=0,2\nstopsignal=TERM\nstopwaitsecs=10\n;user=pavelp\nredirect_stderr=true\nstdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/qlistener-stdout.log\nstdout_logfile_maxbytes=50MB\nstdout_logfile_backups=10\nstdout_capture_maxbytes=0\nstdout_events_enabled=false\nstderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/qlistener-stderr.log\nstderr_logfile_maxbytes=50MB\nstderr_logfile_backups=10\nstderr_capture_maxbytes=0\nstderr_events_enabled=false\nenvironment=APPLICATION_ENV=development\nserverurl=AUTO\nopen supervisorctl\nsudo supervisorctl\nread configuration\nreread\nadd configuration\nadd shared_folders\n", "Q: Is the Ubuntu \"Restore Test\" program legitimate? I have an encrypted home directory, and today when I came to my computer, there was a prompt I had never seen before labeled \"Restore Test\", which asked me to input my home directory decryption key.\nWell, I put in the decryption key, and pressed OK, and the prompt went away, never reporting success or failure. Now I'm a bit suspicious of the program. \nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this a legitimate part of Ubuntu and not some spear phishing attack? \n\n*How can I be sure? \n\n*If this is just a bad UX, where do I report this as a bug so others don't have to worry as I currently am? \n\n\nThanks.\n\nA: That sounds like you are on Ubuntu 12.10 and are using encrypted automatic backups.  Every two months, the backup system performs a Restore Test which will prompt for your password (see below for why).  You should have also seen in that same dialog a checkbox to disable such tests.\nHowever, you should have seen a success or failure dialog at the end of the test (which may take some time).  It would have been a dialog that asked for attention in the launcher bar on the left, but would not have popped above your current window.  Maybe you didn't notice the dialog before logging out?  Else maybe there is a real bug.\n(The restore test is done without using any saved passwords.  That is why it asks you.  This is done in part to confirm that the user has not forgotten the password and would able to restore on a fresh system.)\n\nA: I had the same question. My conclusion is that the software is legitimate.\nDetails:\nWhen I launched System Monitor, the names for the backup software were deja-dup and duplicity. When I searched for them, deja-dup is the GUI wrapper for the command line backup software of duplicity which is made by http://duplicity.nongnu.org. These software's seems to be installed by default in Ubuntu. So, it is legitimate.\nIn my test, the Restore Test result was done successfully when I entered my correct password but it didn't for wrong passwords in my test.\nThis is the initial window for the Test in Ubuntu 18.04:\n\nAnd this is its result window when the correct password was given:\n\nWhen a wrong password is given in the initial window, after verifying process has been finished, its result is not shown anything and then the initial window shows again for getting the correct password.\nFYI, it is recommended not to use Login password or Admin password for the backup password even though the backup software is legitimate.\n", "Q: Battery life: 90 min on Acer ultrabook / 12.10 i usually work on my Acer M5-481TG with Windows 8 x64 and recently installed Ubuntu 12.10 (x64) alongside with it.\nUnfortunately, the battery-life is roughly one and a half hour - which apparently is disasterous, compared to the 5-6 hrs it runs under Windows.

Hopefully someone here can help:)\nI was having some problems with an install of Ubuntu 12.10 so I decided to reinstall Ubuntu Studio 12.04 over the existing install.\nI am running a dual boot WinXP/Ubuntu system and decided it would be safe to reinstall Ubuntu from a liveusb of Ubuntu Studio 12.04 I had on an existing USB stick.\nAll went well, booted from the usb, played around with it for a while then decide to install. Chose the option that said 'Install over your existing Ubuntu 12.10' - let this run, finish and then rebooted.\nI was then faced with the grub rescue prompt and 'no such partition'.\nI then rebooted this time with my usb stick in and lo and behold it booted into grub with my usual boot options e.g. Ubuntu, Memtest, Win XP etc.etc.\nSo I figure somehow I've installed the bootloader to my USB (/sdb1) and my system won't boot without it.\nHave installed boot-repair and ran the log: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1626253/\nMy OLD Ubuntu 12.10 was installed on a partition called /dev/sda2 which no longer exists, and new install of 12.04 is on /dev/sda6.\nShould I just run boot-repair and hope for the best?

Plug in the USB and in grub menu select Windows XP. Let it boot, at user select take out the USB. Log in as administrator and download EasyBCD (and install it). Now, restore the Windows bootloader. The easiest way to do this is run EasyBCD and click \"BCD Deployment\". There, choose your os (Windows XP for this question) and click Write MBR. Now, if lower left corner shows \"MBR Written succesfully\", you are almost done. Now, you need to add Ubuntu to the Windows bootloader. We will use EasyBCD again, so click \"Add new entry\", select Linux/BSD, type is \"Grub 2\", name is whatever you want, then click \"Add Entry\". Confirm by going to \"Edit boot menu\" and maybe edit default. Confirm by rebooting with USB stick out.\nFOR OTHERS WITH NEWER WINDOWS, THIS DOES NOT WORK ON GPT/EFI!!!\n\n*Install Grub again\nPut the USB in and boot linux from it. There, log into a terminal and type in sudo -i. That will get you a root prompt. There, type in grub-install /dev/sda, assuming your disk of installed Linux is /dev/sda, if not, replace /dev/sda with the correct disk. It will run some commands and install grub.

I assume it didn't work because my card is the ATI Mobility Radeon HD6370 which is apparently not the same as ATI Radeon HD 63xx series.\nNow that you know my life story, has anybody been able to get the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 6370 working in Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit, or any other version of Ubuntu for that matter?\nThanks in advance \n-Rob\n\nA: Give a try to this how to and it should help you install the driver at the \nAMD Linux Community\n", "Q: Unity removed after installing KDE SC 4.10 I wanted to try the new version of kubuntu desktop (KDE SC 4.10) on my Ubuntu 12.10, so I did this:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\ninstallation went without problems, I ended unity session and logged into KDE.

So does anyone know if a SSD drive or a 32 GB ram upgrade will fix this problem? Or alternately if there is another solution. Thanks so much  \n\nA: If you believe that the swap partition is the culprit, then you should try to disable or unmount it first (swapoff -a) to see if your guess was correct. Or look at the System Monitor and see how much of the swap partition is currently in use. Note that you can also configure the swappiness, which means that you can have a active swap partition for system functionality such as hibernation, but that is otherwise only utilized if there is really not enough RAM available (like when an application has a memory leak).\nI doubt that more RAM will do any good. 8 to 16 GB should be sufficient current games. Depending on how the game preemptively fetches data from the drive, a SSD will either only have an impact when loading new maps or levels or will minimize lags when new events are triggered, but that mostly depends on the game and how it is written.\nIt is also possible that you have set your graphics settings too high or you have interferences in your input devices.\n\nA: As stated above you could try messing with your swap partition and the way it behaves (swapon/swapoff and swappiness) however , looking at the tech specs of the laptop your swap would not be the culprit. \nIt appears that your laptop has no gpu , this can greatly impact performance as your in built graphics may not be able to handle your settings or may just be too slow. swappiness being lowered (to say , 10) may help this , but i wouldnt think it will solve the symptoms it may also be the driver being used , especially on 2nd and 3rd gen i7's\n", "Q: How do I combine two toolbar buttons into one?

I am running an Ubuntu 12.04 VirtualBox guest (with Guest Additions installed) within a Windows 7 host.\n\nHow can I set the resolution of the guest VB to match the physical machine's native resolution (1280 x 800)?  IOW, is there a way to add 1280 x 800 to the available options?\n\nThe highest resolution available under the System Settings > Displays that \"fits\" within the native one is 1024 x 768, which gives an aspect ratio of 4:3, whereas the native resolution gives an aspect ratio of 8:5 (better known as 16:10, for some reason).  Choosing this resolution means that a considerable portion of the screen is left unused (which is a big deal when working with a tiny screen to begin with).  All the other resolution choices available through System Settings > Displays give a 4:3 aspect ratio.  (E.g. there's also a 1280 x 960 option, which does use the full width of the screen, but results in the loss of the bottom 160-pixel-high strip of the image.)\n\nA: OK, it looks like I solved this problem, somehow or other.  Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I quit VirtualBox (both the vm and the graphical VirtualBox Manager window);\n\n*At the Windows host's cmd prompt, I ran:\nC:\\>cd \"c:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\"\nC:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox>VboxManage setextradata \"<vmname>\" \"CustomVideoMode1\" \"1280x800x16\"\n(Of course, replace <vmname> with the actual name of your vm, and replace the resolution spec string with the appropriate one for your monitor.  Also note that the last character in the argument CustomVideoMode1 is the digit 1, and not the letter \"l\".  With some fonts the two characters are practically indistinguishable.  BTW, more custom models can be specified, using a similar command, with arguments of the form CustomVideoMode2, CustomVideoMode3, and so on up to, I believe, CustomVideoMode16.)\n\n*I restarted VirtualBox and the VM; (at this point I noted that there was no change in the appearance of the display, nor in the resolution options available through System Settings > Displays);\n\n*I selected System Settings > Additional Drivers, selected the option Oracle VM VirtualBox Guest Additions for Linux Module, and clicked on Activate;\n\n*I restarted the vm;\n\n*I wiped the tears of joy from my eyes.\n\n\nWhen the VM came back up, the resolution was the correct one; furthermore, now the resolution options available through System Settings > Displays include one additional option \"1280 x 800 (16:10)\" (it is, of course, the currently active one).\nI can't tell whether running VBoxManage setextradata ... (steps 1 & 2 above) made any difference.  IOW, steps 4 & 5 may very well have done the trick.\nAlso, note that the Oracle VM VirtualBox Guest Additions for Linux Module was not activated even though I had previously run Devices > Install Guest Additions... at the VirtualBox control panel.\n", "Q: SSD on Ubuntu 12.10 Much Slower than on Win7 I have OCZ Solid 3 120GB SSD with 500MB/s Read & 450MB/s Write speeds on my Dell Inspiron R15. My primary OS is Ubuntu 12.10 (fresh) 32-bit. It runs fairly well, no freezes and overall performance is much better than on a HDD, however, just now I noticed that copying speed is much slower than on Win7. Copying a 3GB file on Win7 has around 130mb/s speed while on ubuntu it's roughly 30-40mb/s. I'm wondering why this is the case. \nI followed few guides which has to optimize an SSD on linux like adding \"discard,noatime\" to fstab, however, this hasn't improved copying speed. It's still under 40mb/s.\nAny ideas how to solve this issue?\nADHCI Enabled\nDual boot (Ubuntu 12.10 & Win7) on the same OCZ Solid 3 SSD (two partitions: A for Ubuntu; and B for Win7. No Swap)\nDell Inspiron 15R\nI3-380M\n6GB RAM\nRadeon 6560 1GB\n\nA: I'm surprised the difference is that great. I don't know the answer, and I have never compared I/O on a dual-boot system, but I have a few ideas.\nI don't recognise the errors you got from your benchmarking program, but they can't be good. Another test for you: are there any anomalies in your disk self-monitoring data? (For example, execute gnome-disks and look for SMART data. Does it judge an OK assessment for all the attributes?)\ngnome-disks also can run isolated read and write tests. I have never run a write benchmark on my SSD and I never will, but the read benchmarks are always satisfying. Are you getting advertised isolated I/O speed? Also it might be interesting to break out separate read and write speeds during your file copy, and compare to those isolated speeds from the gnome-disk benchmark. iostat -m during the copy will give you those numbers. (iostat is in the sysstat package on Debian/Ubuntu.) That's probably not terribly practical advice, but something shocking could possibly rear up.\nIs your Linux file system itself in good shape? fsck is the program for finding out, but it's difficult to run on a working file system. It's easiest I think to sudo touch /forcefsck and reboot.\nSay, you're not using Ext3, are you? This might be, if you upgraded to Ubuntu 12.10 over an older distro. Ext3 does not handle gigabyte-size files as efficiently as Ext4. Perhaps that's a factor. mount (just mount, no parameters) will identify the file system in play.\nYou may be seeing an effect of the programs you're using to do the file copy. The cp command for example, I think it isn't terribly fast or efficient. (I gather however you're using some GUI, not cp. That adds more variables though. You never know what a program is really thinking behind its GUI.)\nI can't imagine noatime would have any measurable effect on copy speed of a single file. (Even so, I use it on my SSD.) discard won't help, and may slow copying. discard you know, encourages the file system to take care of the flash memory erase pass as early as possible. I'm not certain that it even works in Ubuntu 12.10 / kernel 3.5. In any case for best benchmark results, you are better served by TRIMming an SSD before the test, and this may make a large difference in write speed indeed. sudo fstrim /home for example.\nThe web is full of advice for other performance adjustments. It's common SSD advice to adjust your disk I/O scheduler and file system journaling enthusiasm. Here's a thread extolling the virtues of data=writeback journaling. In my opinion that advice is slightly off the mark, but it might make a difference. Some journaling configurations would be genuinely slower, but you wouldn't be using data=journal by accident.\nWhat am I saying anyway? System performance can be home to a thousand variables. In my opinion on a few popular choices, regarding speed of copying one file: noatime, I don't see it. data=writeback possibly. discard surely not. fstrim quite possibly. fsck maybe. Outside the worrisome benchmark I/O errors you mentioned, I would guess Ext3 or an unTRIMmed disk may account for some part of the discrepancy you're seeing.\n\nA: *\n\n*do you use ext4 file system (file system which supports TRIM)\n\n*also check if you have discard in mount options in your /etc/fstab (TRIM enabled)\n\n*noatime option also helps\n\n*is Ubuntu partition properly aligned (starting block number should be divisible by 4096). If is not - you get speed penalty and have to re-align it with gparted started from live linux distro\n\n", "Q: Why doesn't deleting files increase available space?

Reserving some number of filesystem blocks for use by privileged \n  processes  is done  to  avoid  filesystem fragmentation, and to allow system \n  daemons, such as syslogd(8), to continue to function correctly after non-privileged \n  processes are prevented from writing to the filesystem.  Normally, the default\n  percentage of reserved blocks is 5%.\n\n\nA: The simple answer is delete more files.  You are seeing the \"reserved\" blocks reclaiming themselves.  Usualy 5% of a filesystem is reserved for privileged processes, is the filesystem is considered full when that limit is reached.  You can adjust the limit with the tune2fs -m command.  see the man pages for tune2fs for more info.\n", "Q: ctrl+alt+f8 pulls blank screen. What is this for?

The latest version of GCC in the Precise archives is 4.6.3. However, GCC 4.7 adds support for some newer C++11 features (like delegating constructors). Quantal's package archives have GCC 4.7.2 available.\nIs there any way I can get GCC 4.7 installed on Precise? Better yet, is there an easy way to take a newer version of a package in one release and backport it to an older release?\n\nA: I have created a PPA that contains a build of GCC 4.7 for Precise here:\nppa:george-edison55/gcc4.7-precise  (Click here for instructions on using PPAs.)\n\nTo backport a package from one release to another is a relatively simple process assuming you have a Launchpad account and have registered your GPG key there.\nMake sure you have the ubuntu-dev-tools  package installed:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-dev-tools\n\nThe syntax for running the backport command looks something like this:\nbackportpackage -s [new_release] -d [old_release] -u [ppa] [package_name]\n\nThe command above will backport [package_name] from [new_release] to [old_release]and upload it to [ppa]. Note that in this particular case you will need to backport not only gcc-4.7 but also gcj-4.7 and gcc-defaults in that order.\n\nA: A slightly more easy way is to just utilize the Ubuntu Toolchain Uploaders (Restricted) Team's PPA of test builds, which has Toolchain builds (this includes gcc, etc.) of newer toolchains in older releases.  The above link shows the Precise packages there but they do compile things.\nThe releases available include gcc 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, and 5, although I've only tested 4.7.\nYou can always backport your own gcc packages and such, but that can always take time.\n", "Q: Faience icons for battery indicator I'm using the Faience Azur icon theme, and my Battery indicator displays ugly icons when the computer is plugged in and at some other times too:\n\n\n(I'll add more problematic icons when I see them)\nI've seen several questions about linking in battery icons from other themes, but looking at the theme, I see that a great icon already exists for a plugged-in battery:\n\nI also see a bunch of battery icons prefixed with xfpm and gpm.\nI assume the reason the Battery Indicator doesn't show some icons correctly is because the icon for that status is incorrectly named and the indicator doesn't recognize the name. \nHow do I correctly set up the Battery Indicator to use icons from the Faience theme?\n\nA: Update:\nI got it working.\n\nI had to rename some icons and add some.

There are various tools for various desktops that aim to run a graphical application as root. gksudo, kdesudo, empower, etc...\nBut what if I'm writing a script that could be used on any Linux desktop? Is there an xdg-sudo of some sort..? A standard for getting sudo access in a desktop environment?\n\nA: A more general way would be to write a \"helper program\". Such a program would prompt the user for a password; if you are sure that, say, Zenity, is installed, you can use that, otherwise you'll need to write the helper program in Python or something else that can interact with the GUI.\nRead the sudo manual for the -A (\"askpass\") and -S (stdin) options.\nAnd remember that when you run sudo from your script, you need the -H (home) option to simulate gksudo.\nThis method works well, but you need to test the helper program thoroughly to ensure that it is bug-free.\n\nA: No, there isn't any standard way of getting root (or any other user's) privileges.\nIf you want to be compatible with as much systems as possible don't assume any way but tell the user that she/he has to run your script as a specific user. Then it's up to the user/admin to configure the system so your script is run in a proper way.\nMaking some suggestion for how to use the most common authentication systems, like su, sudo and ConsoleKit, would be nice.\n\nA: Following @Tachyons suggestion, I researched a LOT about pkexec and it is awesome!\n\n*\n\n*It is part of PolicyKit, a widely used package.\n\n*Hosted and sponsored by freedesktop.org\n\n*Default in Gnome, Unity, MATE, Cinnamon, KDE, LXDE and XFCE, and possibly others\n\n*Works via D-Bus, so it's completely desktop-neutral, with a well-defined protocol.\n\n*In many DEs it is used in several services like login screen, shutdown/restart, disk management (udisks/automount) and so on.\n\nSo yes, it meets all requirements, and I guess it's the closest thing an \"universal gksudo\" can be.\nThat said, pkexecis the command-line front-end to PolicyKit. There are 2 basic modes of operation:\n\n*\n\n*Simply run it as you would with sudo, and you get a nice GUI prompt:\n$ pkexec rm -rfX /\n\n\n*\n\n*Or create a PolicyKit authorization file for you application, drop it in /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d, and it will allow a great deal of customization and security-related options, for example root access for certain actions only, no need of password for others, access limited to certain paths, etc. You can fine-tune your settings with amazing granularity.\n\n", "Q: twitch.tv video full screen opens on different monitor?

What is the difference that explains the different results of these commands?\n\n\n*\n\n*a=2 echo $a\n\n*set a=2 echo $a\n\n*a=2; echo $a\n\n*set a=2; echo $a\n\nA: *\n\n*a=2 echo $a\nResult: output a blank line\nReason: Bash provides a subset of its variables (the environment) to every program you call with it (you can specify which with the export builtin). Prefixing a command with e.g. a=2 tells bash to add $a (with value 2) to the environment, but \n\n\n*\n\n*only for that particular program, and \n\n*not to the set of variables used by bash itself.\n\n\nSo, if echo were a program (it's actually a builtin), it would receive $a along with the other environment variables ... but echo doesn't care about environment variables - it just spits back the arguments you give it. Since $a isn't defined as a variable in bash itself, your command is equivalent to a bare echo, which emits a newline character, giving you a blank line.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*set a=2 echo $a\nResult: no output\nReason: This isn't doing what you think it is - in fact, the echo command isn't called at all.

You can see this with a couple of extra commands:\n$ set a=2 echo $a\n$ echo $1\na=2\n$ echo $2\necho\n\n... and echo $3 gives a blank line, because you tried to set $3 to $a, which doesn't exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*a=2; echo $a\nResult: output 2 (at last!)\nReason: This is the correct way to get what you want: you set the variable $a to 2, and then you called echo with $a as an argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*set a=2; echo $a\nResult:\n\n\n*\n\n*If $a is already set to 2: output 2\n\n*If $a is not set: output a blank line\nReason: Hopefully you can work this out for yourself, given the explanations above.\n", "Q: Can't Update Ubuntu On the Ubuntu website, it says that if I want to update Ubuntu from 12.04 LTS to 12.10, I have to go into Update Manager and click 'Check', which won't work.

I have gotten most of the way there but I have a very specific question: I want to run full Unity on the external (HDMI) monitor, and I don't care if the laptop display is unusable.\nI have a Dell XPS 15 with Nvidia GT 540M with Optimus. (DAMN OPTIMUS!!!!) I have Bumblebee installed. I am able to run the system on the laptop display, and I can use optirun to run programs like glxspheres in high-performance mode. When I plug in the external monitor, I see nothing, and xrandr does not detect it (\"HDMI1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\").\nHere's what I've done so far (working from Bumblebee's multi-monitor setup guide). I followed the \"extra screen\" advice there, so I have edited bumblebee.conf and xorg.conf.nvidia as instructed. Now, if I run:\nexport DISPLAY=:8 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/nvidia-current:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\noptirun glxspheres\n\nI see the glxspheres demo on the external monitor (without any window dressing). Woohoo!\nNow the next step is to shut down Unity on the laptop display and test that glxspheres still works. So I hit Ctrl+Alt+F1 to go to the non-graphical terminal. Then:\nsudo service lightdm stop\nexport DISPLAY=:8 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/nvidia-current:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\noptirun glxspheres\n\nAgain, I see glxspheres on the external monitor.\nNow the Bumblebee guide tells you to do \"optirun wmii& (or other like startlxde)\" but I don't want to change to another window manager. How can I run Unity on the external monitor?\nI tried optirun unity and I got most of the way there. This starts up Unity on the external monitor. I can see the desktop, and the mouse works. I can run other programs inside Unity. There are just a couple of problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Certain keyboard combinations don't get detected by Unity -- looks like anything involving Ctrl as well as the Fn key. (e.g.: Ctrl+Alt+T didn't work to get a terminal; Fn+F11 didn't work to change the volume.)\n\n*Keyboard strokes appear in the terminal as well as Unity. I don't want that since there may be passwords being typed.\n\n*If I switch to another screen (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+F8), the audio stops working, so this is not a viable solution to #2.\n\n\nI feel like these three issues are related. I think the main problem is that I shouldn't be directly running Unity, but instead, running lightdm. I've tried optirun lightdm but it doesn't work at all. Hoping someone knows. If not, hopefully at least this question will help people almost-run Unity on an external monitor.\n\nA: as I understand, Unity doesn't work with optirun (it seems to be a bug).\nThat's what I've found here:\nHDMI doesn't work with Optimus hybrid graphics chipsets under Linux for most laptops, even if you use Bumblebee, but there is a way to get HDMI to work: by using a separate session.\nUsing the instructions below, you'll get an LXDE session (you can use XFCE or others, but the instructions below are for LXDE) to show up on the external monitor (which is connected via HDMI), and in this session, all the applications you launch use your laptop's Nvidia graphics card and you can play games, watch movies, etc. The LXDE session runs in the same time as your regular session, so on your laptop's screen you get your regular (main) session. Also, the mouse and keyboard are shared between the two sessions / monitors.\nHere's how this looks like:\n\n\nThe first image above is from my laptop's screen (Dell XPS L702X which comes with Nvidia Optimus) while the second image is the separate LXDE session which is also running on my laptop, but is displayed on a TV connected via HDMI. As you can see, the first one is using the Intel graphics chip while the second one uses Nvidia.\nHowever, there are some things to consider when using this:\n\n\n*\n\n*the sound won't work (if you know a way to get it to work, please let\nus know in the comments!) through HDMI so you'll only get sound\nthrough your laptop's speakers\n\n*you can't move a window from your current desktop to the monitor\nconnected via HDMI. The only way to run applications on the device\nconnected via HDMI is to either run it from its session menu, or by\nusing \"export DISPLAY=:8.0\" (see the end of the post for more info on\nthis). The mouse is however, shared between the two desktops.\n\n*when loading the extra session, you may get double indicators / tray\nicons on your current (main) session. There is a way around this\nthough (see the \"tips\" section at the end of the post)\n\n\nGet HDMI to work with laptops using the Optimus technology under Ubuntu using Bumblebee and Synergy\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Bumblebee if you haven't already.\n\n*Unity doesn't work with Bumblebee (and I'm not sure if you can run two sessions using the same window manager without them interfering anyway), so you'll need to use a different desktop environment / session, like LXDE, XFCE and so on - use whatever you want. I've used LXDE so using the instructions below, you'll get an LXDE session on the monitor connected via HDMI.\nTo get the mouse and keyboard working on the external monitor connected via HDMI we'll use Synergy, a tool that lets you share the mouse and keyboard between multiple computers.\nLet's install the required packages (LXDE and Synergy):\nsudo apt-get install synergy lxde lxde-common\n\n*To be able to use Synergy, you'll need to create a configuration file. You can download mine from HERE - copy the file to your home folder and rename it to \".synergy.conf\" (notice the dot in front of the filename - that makes the file become hidden).\nThe file I've provided above should be enough, but if you want to change it, you can read about the Synergy configuration file here.\n\n*To start LXDE on the external monitor connected via HDMI, you can use a script which you can download from HERE. Extract the archive, copy the \"hdmi\" script to your home folder and make it executable using the following command:\nchmod +x ~/hdmi\nNow, to run the script, use the following command:\n~/hdmi\nLXDE should now start on the external monitor connected via HDMI. Give it some time (around 10 seconds) and moving your mouse to the left of your screen should make it show up on the HDMI device.\nHere's what the script does (this is just an explaination, you don't need to run these commands, just use the above script):\nexports the display to the one we're going to use for the HDMI monitor (8):\nexport DISPLAY=:8.0\nruns LXDE with optirun (Bumblebee):\noptirun startlxde &\nruns the Synergy server in the foreground on the main display (on your laptop's main session) with 127.0.0.1 as the address:\nsynergys -f -a 127.0.0.1 --display :0 -n ubuntu &\nruns the Synergy client in the foreground on the HDMI display and it connects it to the 127.0.0.1 server address:\nsynergyc -f -n hdmi --display :8 127.0.0.1 &\nAnd finally, it exports the display back to your laptop's (main) display:\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0\nThe script also uses some \"sleep\" commands which add a delay to make sure the commands have enough time to get executed before running the next command.\n", "Q: How to make GRUB remembers what I boot last time?

The most frequently used commands are update\nand install.\nCommands:\nupdate - Retrieve new lists of packages\nupgrade - Perform an upgrade\ninstall - Install new packages (pkg is libc6 not libc6.deb)\nremove - Remove packages\nautoremove - Remove automatically all unused packages\npurge - Remove packages and config files\nsource - Download source archives\nbuild-dep - Configure build-dependencies for source packages\ndist-upgrade - Distribution upgrade, see apt-get(8)\ndselect-upgrade - Follow dselect selections\nclean - Erase downloaded archive files\nautoclean - Erase old downloaded archive files\ncheck - Verify that there are no broken dependencies\nchangelog - Download and display the changelog for the given package\ndownload - Download the binary package into the current directory\n\nOptions:\n-h  This help text.\n-q  Loggable output - no progress indicator\n-qq No output except for errors\n-d  Download only - do NOT install or unpack archives\n-s  No-act.

I would upload a file like that for you, but I do not have access to my computer.\n\nA: This depends on your /etc/sudoers settings as well. For starters, as pointed out, the alias won't even be available within the sudo context. However, you could adjust your alias to say:\nalias rapt-get='http_proxy=\"10.1.1.26:8080\" sudo apt-get'\n\ni.e. include the variable that you set for this invocation. If you wanted sudo to take this over from the user's context you'll have to edit /etc/sudoers in order to add the variable name to the env_check or  env_keep setting. Quoting man sudoers:\n\nBy default, the env_reset option is enabled.  This causes commands to\n  be executed with a minimal environment containing TERM, PATH,\n  HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME, USER and USERNAME in addition\n  to variables from the invoking process permitted by the env_check\n  and env_keep options. This is effectively a whitelist for\n  environment variables.\n\n\nA: ~/.bashrc adds aliases for you, and only you\nsudo runs as root. Even though you may have administrator access, your user is not root.\nSo, add your alias to ~root/.bashrc (generally this is /root/.bashrc).\nIf you'd like to add this alias for all users, add it to /etc/profile\n", "Q: How can I uninstall my current java and install sun java 1.6 I installed jdk using the following command:     sudo apt-get install default-jdk     but it is the wrong version.

But my hardware vendor ( fujitsu primergy mx130 s2 server) is not in Ubuntu Server certified hardware list , will this make any kernel panic errors or system instability during long run?\n\nA: In most cases hardware incompatibilities are rare, and tend to often be with specific hardware components. Chances are your server would work, even if its not in the certified hardware list - the list simply means that someone tested to make sure everything does work, and probably ship with an installed, configured version of the OS, with all the necessary drivers. \nIt very likely will not crash.I've seen other reports that it works fine. Haven't seen any mentions of kernel panics or system instability. Ubuntu gets installed on a wide array of hardware and usually works, so this should be a non issue\nOn the other hand apparently there's sometimes a problem with the built in graphics adaptor and the default settings - especially if you need fglrx. The link recommends installing ssh during the initial install (something you should do anyway) in case this happens. Should the system boot with no video output, it may be necessary to use ssh or a rescue console to fix the drivers. \n It may be neccessary to backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and purge, and reboot and reinstall fglrx and fglrx-amdcccle, then rebuild a new xorg file with sudo aticonfig --initial.

Linux does not support the exFAT partition type yet. And even when Linux does support exFAT, you still won't be able to install Ubuntu on an exFAT partition, because exFAT does not support UNIX file permissions.\nI would use Gparted to create, move and resize partitions, as it supports many more file systems than Windows' admin utility.

I adjusted fonts for the menu of the programs to Droid Sans 8, but Dolphin, VLC and Skype do not accept this setting and they look different.

For instance apt-cache search firefox. \nOnce the options listed, you can select your choice.\n\nA: First you check for available versions of software:\nsudo apt-cache search php-mysql\n\nThen install the latest version from the list printed out from the previous command:\nsudo install php7.4-mysql\n\nIf there was no package, try the following command and redo the above process:\nsudo add-apt-repository universe\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to do a lossless conversion from m4v to webm? I have several m4v files, which I need to convert to webm.\nI am using ffmpeg for doing so and have used commands such as:\nffmpeg -i myfiletoconvert.m4v output.webm\n\nThe conversion works fine, and the resolution is still the same, however the quality is just not the same.  \nWhat I actually would like is that the conversion is lossless. I would like the properties of the input file to be the same for the output file, so that I do not have a noticeable quality change.\nHow would I accomplish that?\n\nA: \nI would like the properties of the input file to be the same for the output file, so that I do not have a noticeable quality change.\n\nYou're going from a lossy codec to another lossy codec. That means you will lose quality no matter what, unless you set the target bit rate so high that the quality loss won't be noticeable (even if it's still there). \nThe downside is, of course, that the file size will increase. How much, you ask, will it increase? No one can tell. It depends on how good the quality of your input video is, and how easy the video is to encode.\nTo force a bit rate during conversion, do the following, e.g. for constant 1 MBit/s:\nffmpeg -i in.m4v -c:v libvpx -b:v 1M -c:a libvorbis out.webm\n\nThe libvpx encoder can also work with variable quality, using the -qmin, -qmax options:\nffmpeg -i in.m4v -c:v libvpx -qmin 10 -qmax 42 -c:a libvorbis out.webm\n\nUse lower values for both parameters to achieve better quality. Usually FFmpeg would set them to 2/31, but WebM needs a different scale here AFAIK.\n\nA: As of version 1.3.0, Dec 2013, libvpx supports lossless encoding through VP9.\nExample usage:\nffmpeg -i in.m4v -vcodec libvpx-vp9 -lossless 1 out.webm\n\nOne gotcha is that webm only supports opus and vorbis audio, which is not going to be lossless. However, opus quality is excellent even at modest bitrates, so if you absolutely need a webm, that's the way to go. Just crank the audio bitrate with -b:a 512k or to whatever level you like.\n", "Q: Crashing issue.

Hi i'm Trying fixing my Windows 7 system with a broken harddrive, but it's still running.\nI'm trying copy all data to a new drive to reinstall Windows 7. Drive called SQSERVICE.\nI can't copy at all - see below:\n$ sudo dd if=/dev/sdc1 of=/dev/sda1\ndd: reading `/dev/sdc1': Input/output error\n11233976+0 records in\n11233976+0 records out\n5751795712 bytes (5.8 GB) copied, 187.731 s, 30.6 MB/s\n\nHow to fix this \"Input/output error\"?\n\nA: I don't know if this is useful to anyone, but if I found this page in my search, maybe it will help someone (other than the OP who hopefully solved his problem months ago).\nddrescue may be the best choice in this case, for data recovery (different from \"fixing\" the error/disk as the original question was worded), as Dennis suggested.\nAlternatively, you could also mount the disk and copy the files. This is MUCH faster if there is lots of empty space, or if you only want some particular files. WARNING: done from a Linux machine, this loses all extended attributes, such as file permissions, so is a very bad choice for OS files, but tolerable for user files. Doing it from windows should preserve those, but might not handle errors smoothly, possibly making it go very slow.\nAnother option to actually \"fix\" the sectors, not just bypass them, is to reallocate the bad sectors. If you know the sector number (in your case, 11233976 assuming your block size in dd, and sector size are 512), just run this, and run again for each new bad sector you find:\nhdparm –write-sector 11233976 –yes-i-know-what-i-am-doing /dev/sdb\n\nWARNING: This will destroy the data on that sector. So be sure you really do know what you're doing. If this sector can't be read, overwriting it will stop the errors, but it will mean that sector will contain garbage, possibly corrupting an important file.\nSee this for more info: http://www.sjvs.nl/forcing-a-hard-disk-to-reallocate-bad-sectors/\nAnd if your disk has a large number (thousands perhaps) of bad sectors (either seen as Current_Pending_Sector, Offline_Uncorrectable or Reallocated_Sector_Ct), or if it's new and still on warranty, or if the number consistently goes up over time, then you should replace the disk anyway. Don't let them tell you that reallocating fixes the disk. It only fixes the known bad sectors and consumes the sectors reserved for reallocation. If the disk is prone to developing more bad sectors, the problem will just keep coming back, each time corrupting some data.\n\nA: While some parts of disk are broken, you are still able to copy good parts of disk.\n$ dd --help\n...\n noerror   continue after read errors\n...\n\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdc1 of=/dev/sda1 conv=noerror\n\n\nA: You said it yourself: your disk is broken. You can try ddrescue, it may be able to work around the broken path. Beware though, that you will lose data.\nRestoring from backup will be easier :)\nThe correct usage of ddrescue is as follows:\nsudo apt-get install gddrescue\nsudo ddrescue /dev/sdc1 /dev/sda1\n\nor if you want to pipe stdout to the progess monitoring tool:\nsudo ddrescue /dev/sdc1 /dev/sda1 | pv\n\n\nA: I had a drive with IO-Errors and on top of that the drive disconnected itself after a couple of minutes read, but then came back after a couple of seconds, that's also why i use disk/by-uuid since the device name changed after this happened.\nI extended Dennis' Answer and this one to run indefinitely:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile [ true ]\ndo\n    echo \"start ddrescue\"\n    ddrescue -O  --retry-passes=3 /dev/disk/by-uuid/<uuid> /media/<other-disk>/data.img  /media/<other-disk>data_ddrescue_map\n    echo \"ddrescue end, sleep 30\"\n    sleep 30\ndone\n    \n\nThis will use ddrescue with an map file, that way you can restart the program and ddrescue will continue where it was before. It will recover the data to an .img-File.\nThe -O Parameter means \"reopen input file after every read error\".\nEvery time it fails, the script sleeps 30 seconds and then tries again. After nearly a Day i got to 99% Rescued, after that it stalled. I let the drive cool down and tried again, then i got to 100%.\nWarning: The script will run forever, unless you terminate it yourself, wenn your are happy with the results.\nWith these commands you can mount the created image to browse the files:\nsudo mkdir /media/data-image\nsudo mount -o loop,ro /media/<other-disk>/data.img /media/data-image\n\n", "Q: Can't do sudo commands on a user account that has no password I'm setting up this Ubuntu dual boot. I have two users, one called smallcomputer that is supposed to be an administrator account, and one called bob that I plan to use bob for everyday surfing and stuff. I will use the adminstrator account for doing advanced stuff like changing system configuration. Bob doesn't have a password, but smallcomputer has.\nI would like the system to boot into bob's account directly when I start the computer, and not ask which account I want to log in to. How do I do that? I feel this should be able to be done since he does not have a password.\nI also have some problem with when I'm logged in as bob and want to do a sudo command. Sometimes I see tutorials online about changing something and they say \"write this in the terminal\". I can never execute a sudo command logged in as bob. I tried typing my adminstrator password and typing no password at all (just pressing return) and the terminal just says it's the wrong password. Those are the only accounts I know of on the system. If I'm logged in as administrator I have no problem executing sudo commands. Why can't I do it from the regular user account? Does calling sudo (when logged in as bob) try to log in as administrator account or is it some level beyond that like some root account?\nIt's Ubuntu 12.10.\nThanks for any help\n\nA: Since you are the main user who needs administrative privileges to install software, you should give your user id \"bob\" administrative privileges. If you are the only user on this computer, then you only need one account and it should have administrative privileges. Ubuntu will safely run \"bob\" with out administrative privileges until it is needed (example installing software). Ubuntu will then ask you for your password allowing you to run an administrator task.\nIf your home folder and documents are already saved under \"bob\", I would give \"bob\" administrative privileges first and then delete the \"smallcomputer\" user. To do this you will need to login as \"smallcomputer\" first:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in as \"smallcomputer\"\nGo under \"system settings\" > \"user accounts\" > select \"bob\" > select \"unlock\" button in upper right window > authenticate \"smallcomputer\" by entering in \"smallcomputer's\" password > change \"Account Type\" to \"administrator\" > select \"Password\" and enter a secure password > log out of \"smallcomputer\"\n\n*Log in as \"bob\" and you should have to enter a password. Go under \"system settings\" > \"user accounts\" > select \"smallcomputer\" > select \"unlock\" button in upper right window > authenticate \"bob\" by entering in \"bob's\" password > you can delete the account \"smallcomputer\". If you do not want to delete the account, you should change the account type to \"standard\" for security purposes.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*I think it would be better for you and others if you can break down this whole thing into several steps and questions.\n\n*I'm not sure but it seems your scenario is too much under the influence of Windows ;-) Although you would probably need just one user (e.g. bob) with a login password under Ubuntu. You can then set auto-login for this user (see System Settings > User Accounts). And every time you need to perform administrative tasks (e.g. sudo commands) you'll only need to enter your login password, and that's it.\n\n", "Q: Problem Setting Up Local SSH Server I am trying to setup one of my linux computers as an ssh server but I can't connect to it.\nI have openssh-server and openssh-client installed already on both computers (client and server).\nIf I run sudo service ssh start, I get start: Job is already running: ssh, so ssh is indeed running.

Games have some tearing issues and they are not smooth at all, even though frames are limited to 60fps.

Any clarification? I know I can export the $http_proxy variable to the correct proxy but I just want to understand what all files/settings Ubuntu uses for proxies.\n\nA: Linux Proxy settings are not the most friendly things in the world.  The attempts at standardising or creating global settings are not particularly successful.\nGlobal configuration files (Such as /etc/environment) are not read by every application or every time they start, and are specific to Linux distributions.\nApplications can use DE (Eg Gnome or KDE) environment settings.\nUser preferences, eg settings from the shell environment may (and should) override host or system global settings.\nThe order of priority between different configuration sources are frustratingly difficult to manage, eg System global configuration files, Desktop environment settings, and login script settings.\nApplication specific settings may override environment settings.\nChanging \"global\" settings often require a restart of the application, sometimes even of the host, so it is more convenient to use the application specific settings in each application.\nThe end result is that the settings are not particularly dynamic.\nIn this case the setting for APT and /etc/environment most likely came from a setting you specified during installation.\nThe values seen in the terminal is quite likely being overridden in your login script or shell profile file, possibly in the users' Gnome global preferences.\n", "Q: Do I have the full OS installed?

No software can fix mechanical problems with the disk.\n\nA: some errors can be fixed. if the mag on the disk has faded, repeatedly writing to it can re mag the sector. how ever if it is physical damage, then it can't be repaired. it is marked as bad, and not used.this is not a problem, unless the bad sector is in a critical area, ie the boot, partition, fat sectors.\n", "Q: User account needs password to eject Kindle in Calibre My 12.10 computer has several accounts on it.  My wife has a Kindle Keyboard 3G that she manages with Calibre.  The problem is that every time she tries to eject the device in Calibre if asks for my password.  Mine is the main administrative account which may be why it wants my password.    \nI'm not at the computer so am not positive whether I could eject from the file manager without a password, though I know that other USB flash drives don't require it.\n\nA: Does this occur if you mount the Kindle 3 (3G), when Calibre is not running?\nThere are multiple known issues with conflict between Nautilus/OS and Calibre over mount/unmount. Also, some efforts to address this (eg. calibre-mount-helper) introduced security flaws, and are not recommended.\n\nThe likely best fix is to use the latest Calibre version, from: http://calibre-ebook.com/\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 System crashes right after login - Boot-Repair log included Wow, my system crashes hard - right after login!

Neither, did a check on the harddrives yield an error message.\nFurther Details\nUbuntu will boot fine up to the login screen.  Then - after I enter the password and hit login - it will hang.  I am not able to enter anything at the resulting screen (see image - larger view here).\n\nThe first time this occurred was right after I cleaned my computer carefully with aerosol. Maybe a hardware damage? But I don't think so, it was minimal maintenance mostly focusing on the cooling-fans. Also, I removed an old harddisk (no boot partition, just mp3 data).\nRegarding Boot-Repair ... ran it through UbuntuSecureRemix (a Ubuntu boot mix CD) a and used the standard option \"Recommendend repair - repairs most frequent problems\".\n\nA: Ok, got back into my system and it is running.\nTo help others, here is the simple fix:\nAll I had to do is boot into an older kernel! :) (here is an explanation on how to do it https://askubuntu.com/questions/97731...keeps-crashing )\nNote though, that I had to go back to a kernel as low as 2.6.x.

I was thinking to have a support in my Ubuntu machine.  When an incorrect password is entered, a picture is taken later revealing who has been trying to gain access.\nI have searched around and the only thing I have found is stuff to do this on Macs. Is It possible to write a script for Ubuntu to do same .\nIf possible then what is a script or Software to make this happen.\n\nA: Based on this post on the Ubuntuforums by BkkBonanza.\nThis is an approach using PAM and will work for all failed login attempts. Using SSH, a virtual terminal or via the regular login screen, it doesn't matter as everything is handled by PAM in the end.\n\n*\n\n*Install ffmpeg , we're going to use this as a command line way of grabbing the webcam images. Update: ffmpeg is removed when you upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04. We can use avconv in place of ffmpeg in the below script. No need to install anything separately.\n\n\n*Create a small script somewhere, e.g. /usr/local/bin/grabpicture with the following content:\n #!/bin/bash\n ts=`date +%s`\n ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -s vga -i /dev/video0 -vframes 3 /tmp/vid-$ts.%01d.jpg\n exit 0  #important - has to exit with status 0\n\nChange the /dev/video0 with the actual video device of your webcam and choose a path where the pictures are being saved - I just choose /tmp.\nIn the newer version of Ubuntu use avconv instead of ffmpeg (sudo apt-get install libav-tools).\n\n\n*Make it executable, e.g. chmod +x /usr/local/bin/grabpicture.\n\n\n*Test it, by just calling it: /usr/local/bin/grabpicture. Check if you see files appearing in /tmp/vid....jpg.\n\n\n*Configure PAM to call this on every failed attempt.\nNote: do this carefully - if this fails you'll not be able to gain access to your system again in a regular way.\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window with root access (sudo -i) and leave it open - just in case you screw up in the next steps.\n\n\n*Open /etc/pam.d/common-auth in your favourite editor, e.g. by doing gksudo gedit /etc/pam.d/common-auth. Keep in mind for the following steps that order of lines in this file matters.\n\n\n*Locate the line below. By default there's one line before the one with pam_deny.so. On my 12.04 system it looks like this:\n  auth    [success=1 default=ignore]      pam_unix.so nullok_secure\n\n\n\n*In this line change the success=1 to success=2 to have it skip our script on success. This is an important step If you failed this step see below how to recover (***).\n\n\n*Right below there, add a new one to call the actual script:\n  auth    [default=ignore]                pam_exec.so seteuid /usr/local/bin/grabpicture\n\n\n\n*Save and close the file. No need to restart anything.\n\n\n\n\n*Test it.\n\n*\n\n*In a new terminal window, as regular user, try su -l username to log in as another user with username username (change with an actual one of course). Deliberately enter the wrong password. Check if this result in a new picture.\n\n*The same as above, but now enter the correct password. Check if you log in and it doesn't result in a picture being taken.\n\n\n\n*If the tests have succeeded you can log out from your DE (Unity/KDE/...) and you should see the same when entering a wrong password from the login screen.\n(***) How to recover the system if you messed with /etc/pam.d/common-auth file:\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the computer\n\n*At grub boot press \"e\" to edit\n\n*Add\n\n\ninit=/bin/sh\n\nto the line starting by \"linux\"\nMount the system with write access\n\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nEdit the file and fix\n\nvi /etc/pam.d/common-auth\n\n\nA: Explanation\nOne way that enables you to run a command when an incorrect password is entered, is to make use of the Authorization Log.\n\nAuthorization Log\nThe Authorization Log tracks usage of authorization systems, the\nmechanisms for authorizing users which prompt for user passwords, such\nas the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) system, the sudo command,\nremote logins to sshd and so on. The Authorization Log file may be\naccessed at /var/log/auth.log. This log is useful for learning about\nuser logins and usage of the sudo command.\nMore here on LinuxLogFiles\n\nOn a failed login attempt, a record will be appended to the /var/log/auth.log file and the last line will contain something like:\npam_unix(gdm-password:auth): authentication failure;\n\nIf you constantly monitor the file for modification and check if the last line contains the keyword failure with for example grep failure then you know a failed login attempt has just occurred and you can run whatever command you want based on this action.\n\nSolution\n\nChange echo \"failed login\" in the scripts below to the command you\nwish to run upon a failed login.\n\nYou can monitor the last line of the /var/log/auth.log file with a script like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile true\ndo\n       sleep 1\n\n\n        if (( $(tail -1 /var/log/auth.log | grep failure | wc -l) == 1))\n\n        then\n\n                echo \"failed login\"\n\n                # Your command here\n\n        fi\n\ndone\n\nOr even better, you can install inotify-tools and use inotifywait to monitor the file instead of the sleep 1 and the script will be like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile inotifywait -q -e modify /var/log/auth.log >/dev/null\n\ndo\n\n        if (( $(tail -1 /var/log/auth.log | grep failure | wc -l) == 1))\n\n        then\n\n                echo \"failed login\"\n\n                # Your command here\n\n        fi\n\n\ndone\n\ninotify-tools can be installed with the following command:\nsudo apt install inotify-tools\n\n\nImplementation\nTo run this solution as a system service, please follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Copy and paste the script code above ( without echo \"failed login\" as I added this line for debugging purposes only ) into a file in your home directory and name it TakePicture.sh and save the file.\n\n\n*Make the shell script file executable by running the following command in the terminal:\nchmod +x ~/TakePicture.sh\n\n\n*\n\n*Create and edit a custom systemd service to run the shell script at boot by running the following command in the terminal:\n\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/TakePicture.service \n\n\n*\n\n*Copy and paste the following code into the editor, replace USERNAME with your username and save it by pressing Ctrl + X then press Y then press Enter :\n\n[Unit]\nDescription=Take Picture\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/home/USERNAME/TakePicture.sh\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the service by running the following command in the terminal:\n\nsudo systemctl start TakePicture\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable the service by running the following command in the terminal:\n\nsudo systemctl enable TakePicture\n\n\nNotice:\nThe authorization Log will contain all sorts of failed logins or authentications ( ie. GDM, SSH, terminal user authentication, sudo, ... etc. ).\nIf your aim is just to activate the script when an actual physical login happens ( ie. someone is sitting infront of your computer, using your keyboard and looking at your screen ), then you need to change the above if statement to be like this:\nif (( $(tail -1 /var/log/auth.log | grep gdm | grep failure | wc -l) == 1))\n\nif GDM is your login manager. This way the script will only be triggered if an actual failed physical login happens.\n", "Q: Laptop with Nvidia gt555m and optimus I have a laptop with Nvidia Gt555m graphics card + optimus. I was wondering how I can make it so that I can play games on Ubuntu. I now have windows on my laptop and the only thing keeping me there are some games that I like to play, so if I could install drivers for Ubuntu I would gladly make the switch.\n\nA: You can use bumblebee, but the graphics performance of the dedicated GT555M will not be very good, but it will be still much better than the integrated graphics.\nYou can also just install nvidia-current or nvidia-experimental-310 (that one has much better performance) and remove Nouveau.\nThe problem is that you have to choose between battery life and graphics performance, because there is no way how to make Optimus technology fully working on Linux, because Nvidia won't make optimus drivers for linux.\nAnd if you are asking about games compatibility, you can use Wine, or play games specially created (or ported) for linux (and list of these games is getting bigger, because of Steam for Linux)\n", "Q: Searching techniques via Nautilus or otherwise Lets say I have following files in a folder\n\n\n*\n\n*Blue-Green-Red \n\n*Red-Yellow-Blue\n\n*Green-Black-red\n\n\nNow I want to search files having 'green' and 'red' as part of their names (case insensitive), how i do that via nautilus or any GUI?

I need to sync my data between these computers. I don't want a backup utility - i need a two-way sync.\nWhat i tried already:\nUsing a cloud (Dropbox, Ubuntu One) is not an option because there's too much data to sync (~50 GB, 12000 files) - even if i purchased extra space, sending all this over the internet would take forever.\nThis task is really easy on Windows - i can just use FreeFileSync and a shared network folder. That's the user-friendliness i want.\nUnfortunately, FreeFileSync doesn't work well with my Ubuntu, and apparently it cannot recognize a samba share address (it's the only way of sharing folders that i know how to setup).\nDirSync Pro looks promising, but it throws an error when i try to run it:\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: dirsyncpro/DirSyncPro : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0\n\nMaybe it's because i have wrong Java, but unfortunately DirSync doesn't say what precisely i need. (i tried installing Java Runtime Environment from here, but it didn't work).\nI don't want a command line tool, because i need an interactive way to view and set which files should be synced and in which direction.\nI've already looked at this question.

And how can I turn it off?\n\nA: Maybe this is due to the backup files which Kate creates regularly.\nYou might check if the described behaviour stops when changing parameters under Settings - Configure Kate - Editor Component - Open/Save.\n\nA: This is a known and confirmed bug, since at least three of us can confirm it.

How do you switch tabs when you attach a window as the tab of another? I wasn't able to find the corresponding KWin shortcuts to modify. I have realized that scrolling over the titlebar works, but is there a key binding I could use? A custom shortcut, probably? What is the command I would have to execute to switch between tabs?\n\n\nA: To switch only between tabs you can configure your own shortcut.\nThis can be done in the following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Application Launcher → Settings → System Settings → Shortcut and Gestures → Global Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n*Select KWin from the 'KDE component:' combo box\n\n*The interested Action is 'Walk Through Windows Tabs'\n\n\nThis tool is smart enough to warn you if you are overriding some other keybind when the latter is defined in it.

I have a completely blank, new out the box, hard drive. Can I still use Ubuntu 12.10 on my Laptop?\n\nA: Yes you should be able to easily install Ubuntu onto it. Just get a flash drive or CD and put ubuntu ( which you can download here http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and insert teh flash drive etc into your laptop and you should be able to downlod it\n\nA: Yes, you can install Ubuntu.\nUbuntu does not need:\n\n\n*\n\n*any operating system to already be installed\n\n*any files or data already on the hard disk\n\n*the hard disk to already be formatted\n\n\nHowever, since your laptop doesn't currently have an operating system on it, you probably will not be able to use it to download Ubuntu and burn it to a CD/DVD (or write it to a USB flash drive). So you'll have to use another computer for this purpose.\nSince you were able to post here on Ask Ubuntu, I am guessing you have access to another computer. Even if you cannot do that on the computer you're currently using (for example, if it's a library/cafe computer with very restrictive policies), most people have a friend, coworker, or other associate who can download Ubuntu and create installation media for them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu or your desktop\nHowever, if you prefer to purchase pre-created installation media, you can do that too.

Thank you in advance.\n\nA: I've gotten that grub> prompt before when trying to write a live iso. It sounds like the live usb wasn't created quite right, usually the live iso's (especially Ubuntu's) have pretty menus and even a timer that will automatically start it in a few seconds, getting a grub> prompt means it didn't load the menu correctly. I don't think it's related to the boot options since it did get to a grub> prompt from the USB, so at least that's good.\nThere's probably a way to edit some files on the usb to get the menu to show up correctly, but it's far easier to just write the iso to the usb again with a different tool that will hopefully work correctly this time.\nIf you can boot another Ubuntu try using ubuntu's usb-creator Ubuntu Documentation Installation/FromUSBStick\nOr if running in Windows try PenDriveLinux.com's Universal USB Installer\nOr also for windows try Linux Live USB Creator (also linked on the Ubuntu Installation/FromUSBStick page above) \nUsually that unetbootin tool is supposed to at least work, but I've found it doesn't use the regular (nice) menus that the iso creators have setup\nOf course, make sure the iso file doesn't have errors, check it's MD5 or SHA1 against what it's supposed to be.\n", "Q: slapd with back_sock does not create a socket I have installed slapd on Ubuntu 12.04 and configured it with the following under /etc/ldap/slapd.conf:\nmodulepath /usr/lib/ldap\nmoduleload back_sock.la\ndatabase sock\nsocketpath /tmp/slapd.sock\n\nHowever, if I start slapd with service slapd restart then, slapd is running but there is no socket file in /tmp.

It's documented in the slapd-sock(5) manpage. It certainly does not create any socket.\nIf you review your logs, you'll only see errors when an action is attempted, because the sock backend opens the socket each time it needs to do some action, and closes it afterwards. You'll see an entry could not open socket in your logs if the socket cannot be opened for each action.\nIf you're trying to make slapd listen on a socket instead, you need to modify /etc/default/slapd, and adjust/add the slapi:// URL (remember you'll need to encode slashes as %2f, see slapd(8) for more details).\n", "Q: How do I call FreeMat that was installed via Alien?

I have a Lubuntu 12.10 server set up in VMWare VirtualBox with an OwnCloud 4.5.6 installation. One of OwnCloud's functions is as a CalDAV server. OwnCloud's web front-end doesn't yet have an interface for adding or editing event reminders. However, it does record settings for event reminders made by other clients -- Evolution, for example, can see reminder settings recorded in events that I imported into OwnCloud from a Google Calendar. However, email reminders for events in OwnCloud, even though the reminder settings are saved with the events, are not being served -- the CalDAV server hasn't sent me any reminders for these events.\nI'm wondering whether there is a way to set up the CalDAV server so that it will send email reminders that are included in events' settings. I've read elsewhere that CalDAV can do this, and that it's just that OwnCloud doesn't provide a GUI for it yet. Is that correct? What would I need to do to set that up?\nThank you! I'll be grateful for any guidance you can offer to me!\nA note: This question is bit similar to the question at Is there a CalDav client with email alert support on Ubuntu server?, which is old and was never answered.\n\nA: Owncloud doesn't have reminder feature. Here is the related bug:\nhttps://github.com/owncloud/apps/issues/34\nTo get email notification you have to sync owncloud calendar with google-calendar.

My goal is to use the server to log some netflows and maybe run squid between the modem and wireless. \nWould this be done via a network bridge? I'm not sure how to handle dhcp. Would it be possible to use dhcp from the wireless router to issue IPs from the access point? Or would disabling dhcp on the modem/wireless router, assigning the server a static IP and turning on dhcp on the attached router. Any thought on how to do this would be appreciated.\nInternet <-> Modem/Wireless router <-> Server <-> Wireless Router <-> Devices\n\nA: Your wireless router should have a bridge mode but the setup is different according the the manufacturer and some won;t bridge between vendors (you may be able to run DD-WRT if you run into this issue). \nIn Bridge mode you generally disable DHCP on the \"client\" router and let it be served from the master. \nAlternatively you can purchase a USB wifi adapter for as little as $6 on Newegg.\n", "Q: Reinstall latest kernel?

In order to do so I need to open \"Sound\" in \"System Settings\". I would like to set a keyboard shortcut to do that. I found out that I can set a custum shortcut in System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts with the command \"gnome-control-center sound\", which will bring up \"Sound\". So far that works well, but there is a little optimization that I would like but cannot figure out. The problem is this: When I use the shortcut to open \"Sound\", the focus is not on \"Output volume\". So before I can modify the output volume with the arrow keys, I need to either click on output volume or hit the Tab key five times, thus moving the focus to output volume. My question is this: Is there something that I can add to the command \"gnome-control-center sound\" so that the focus is moved to \"Output volume\" automatically, for example something equivalent to \"hit Tab key five times\"?\nThanks in advance for your help!\nWolfhart\n\nA: Answers to your question exist here:\nHow can I reach over 100% volume with a keyboard shortcut?\nPersonally I prefer this way:\nOpen the sound settings and with sound settings opened , open also a terminal. \nThen try the command below \npacmd set-sink-volume 0 80000\n\nProbably you will see the sound increased further than 100%.

I have internet access on my cellphone, which I don't abuse, but having internet on my laptop basically makes me completely non-productive.\nIn the past I fixed this by going into /sbin and doing rm iw* if*, which makes it impossible to get internet back because to get those files back needs a liveCD and to get a liveCD requires internet; I gave a liveCD copy to a responsible friend in case of emergency.\nHowever, I recently got a new laptop and upgraded to 12.10. I'm having trouble completely disabling the wireless. I tried removing nt-* but this had no effect - the applet is gone, but the laptop still automatically connects.

X now works, but I still have internet access.\nAll help appreciated :)\n\nA: Potentially, a friend could blacklist all drivers for the inbuilt wireless capability for this specific laptop. They would then provide you with a user account that does not have rights to undo this.\nHowever, you could always re-install the OS, find another wireless device, or simply find some other method ..\n\nIf this is a serious addiction, you will NOT be able 'cure' yourself without ongoing counselling and the support of family and friends.

I have a laptop with an internal SSD (let's call it samsung-SSD), and I would like to install ununtu 12.04 on an external SSD connected via USB3 (let's call this one vertex2).\nI downloaded an ubuntu iso and created a bootable usb key from it.\nThen I booted on the usb key, and followed the ubuntu install:\n  /dev/sda is the internal samsung-SSD.\n  /dev/sdb is the usb key from which I am installing\n  /dev/sdc is the external vertex2 on which I am installing.\n\nThe install completes, I boot ubuntu this time from the vertex2. But as the usb key is not here anymore, the vertex2 is known as /dev/sdb.

For example:\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu quantal main restricted multiverse universe\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu quantal-updates main restricted multiverse universe\ndeb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu quantal partner\ndeb http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu quantal main\n\nYou can read more here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine\nOnce you've edited sources.list to your satisfaction, you will need to refresh things and make apt aware of the changes by running\nsudo apt-get update\n\nYou should then be able to install Flash Player with \nsudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer\n\n", "Q: Unable to open Update manager or Ubuntu tweak I cannot open Update manager and Ubuntu Tweak\nwhen I open Ubuntu tweak I get this log\nuser@laptop:~$ ubuntu-tweak\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/ubuntu-tweak\", line 124, in <module>\n    from ubuntutweak.main import UbuntuTweakWindow\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ubuntutweak/main.py\", line 32, in <module>\n    from ubuntutweak.apps import AppsPage\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ubuntutweak/apps/__init__.py\", line 9, in <module>\n    from aptsources.sourceslist import SourcesList\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/aptsources/__init__.py\", line 4, in <module>\n    apt_pkg.init()\nSystemError: E:Opening configuration file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00aptitude -

I've installed Ubuntu wrong I wanted to do a dual boot with Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10.\nI followed this tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNCSbTyUzoM\nWhen I was on the installing Ubuntu part, the free space was not showing, it was showing as unusable. So I clicked on my C drive on the installation screen and pressed the - button to remove the partition I created and just created the swap space on the C drive and installed Ubuntu on the C drive choosing to use 50GB. So I installed, rebooted and can no longer run Windows 8, where all my files are accessible.\nI'm not just talking movies, tv shows galore that I have not watched. I'm talking about all the music I've collected over 3 years and all my pictures and important documents. I know I should have a backup, but I don't so that's that.\nNow, can I do anything to access these files at all on Ubuntu, because I cannot find this 'host' folder containing my Windows 8 user where all my files are.\nThanks for your time, I hope I ain't buggered this up!\n\nA: Open your file explorer in Ubuntu and on the left side, under \"devices\" it will say something like \"50gb file system\" (it may not be 50gb it will be whatever you set it to)\nThat file system is your windows 8 partition.  Once there, you can browse it just like in windows; it contains the same files. \nWhen you start up your computer what does it look like? Do you get a menu that lets you choose between Ubuntu and Windows? If these don't work you may have done the installation wrong and deleted your entire windows partition.\nThirdly, the Ubuntu install comes with a partitioning tool (gparted or fdisk), you didn't have to make it in Windows. Instead when it says \"install alongside windows 8\" just choose that option and press \"install\".\n", "Q: Most suitable permissions for mounted internal disk shared with Windows? I've been using Ubuntu/Linux for a few years now but I'm still learning..\nI've just updated to 12.10 after installing a Samsung 830 128GB SSD which has Windows and Ubuntu OS's dualboot on it. My old 500GB HDD (Data) is now NTFS with all my data on it (music, docs, videos etc) and I'd like to have this accessible/shareable in both OS's. I've decided to leave /home on my SSD but symlink to the Data drive. Before I do this I want to make sure Data automounts at startup (for Dropbox most importantly).

The workaround is to let Latte dock manage the borderless window configuration. See this answer for more details.\n\nTo remove the borders of maximized windows in KDE Plasma 5, run the following commands:\nkwriteconfig5 --file ~/.config/kwinrc --group Windows --key BorderlessMaximizedWindows true\nqdbus org.kde.KWin /KWin reconfigure\n\nThis is equivalent to doing the following:\n\n*\n\n*Edit the file ~/.config/kwinrc to add the line:\nBorderlessMaximizedWindows=true\n\nunder the [Windows] section, so that it looks something like this:\n\n [Windows]\n BorderlessMaximizedWindows=true\n ActiveMouseScreen=true\n AltTabStyle=KDE\n AutoRaise=false\n AutoRaiseInterval=750\n BorderSnapZone=10\n CenterSnapZone=0\nIn older versions of KDE, the file may be located at: ~/[.kde|.kde4|.kdemod4]/share/config/kwinrc\n\n\n*Restart KWin by running:\n kwin --replace\n\nIf that does not work, try one of the following, depending on which display server you are using:\n kwin_x11 --replace\n kwin_wayland --replace\n\nGo crazy and maximize every window in sight!  Remember that you can unmaximize them from the window menu (Alt + F3) or from the task manager in your panel.  If quick tiling is enabled (System Settings → Desktop → Screen Edges → Window Management), you can also use Alt + Left mouse button to unmaximize windows by dragging them.\nReferences\n\n*\n\n*Hide window border for maximized windows\n\nA: In Kubuntu 18.04, one can toggle borders (including the titlebar) and the maximized state of windows relatively simply.\nIn System Settings, choose Shortcuts > Global Shortcuts > KWin.

I have a small SSD for running the operating system (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, it used to windows but recently made the switch!). I then use another large harddrive for storing all my data (I call it \"11111\", it shows up under \"Devices\" in the file explorer, with the option to unmount it).\nQuestion 1:\nIs there anyway I can make the default \"Documents\", \"Pictures\", \"Videos\", \"Music\" links refer to a location of my large \"11111\" drive instead of a location on my small SSD?\nQuestion 2: \nShould I incorporate my \"11111\" drive into the file system somehow instead? However I dont want my media spread on the two drives, I would like to keep the OS and media on separate independent drives.\nQuestion 3: \nAny good tutorials or links on how to do Question 2. I have been googling it but not coming right.\nQuestion 4: \nI would like to make Dropbox and UbuntuOne point to locations on \"11111\" drive instead of on the \"file system\". Anyone know how to do this?\nAny advice, guidance, or links to help me with the above will be highly appreciated.\n\nA: Option 1: Moving the home directory\nThe best choice is to copy your home directory over to the other drive and mount that drive as /home as Takkat described in his comment/answer. I use a setup like this on my laptop with a SSD and a fast 7200rpm hard drive. I didn't notice any performance degradation during startup/login compared to having /home on the SSD.\nOption 2: Redirect particular directories\nAnother option was discussed here:\nHow do I integrate my Windows filesystem with Ubuntu? Note that special folders can and should be redirected by not using symlinks. For regular folders you just need to know where the data is stored to replace the folders with a symlink, though some applications store data across different directories:\n$ find -iname vlc\n./.local/share/vlc\n./.cache/vlc\n./.config/vlc\n\nThis is where it can get difficult with some applications or in the event of a migration or re-installation you probably find yourself accidentally deleting data you wanted to keep. Therefore go with option 1.\n\nA: *\n\n*I'm not sure unless you specified that when creating partitions before installing, though you can create a symlink to your a folder in 11111. Something like :\n\n\nln -s path-to-hdd ~/Documents/11111_docs\n\n\n*\n\n*You can either do the above or do what says below.\n\n*When Installing you have to choose \"Do something else\" then you\nproceed to make the mount points like home/Documents,\nhome/Music, etc. point to the Hard drive, while you point / to the SSD.\n\n*You can change that in the Dropbox settings, click the indicator then\nPreferences and go to the last tab then select another folder. In\nUbuntu One by default the Ubuntu One folder will be in your Home\nhowever you can choose to sync a different folder of your choice.\n\n\nA: I would agree with LiveWireBT. I think that in your case, your best option is to move the home mount point.\nThe way to do it is to move the /home/username folder to the root of your large disc. Then modify your fstab file changing the mount point of the hard disk to /home.

It boots up perfectly and the entire filesystem is as it was. However , when I right click inside a directory and click properties or when I tupe df -h , it shows that there is only 10gb free space. Howrver , in the disk utility it shows the 500gb as the filesystem and nothing seems wrong. How can I make ubuntu see that there is more than just 10gb free space on the new hdd ?\nEDIT:\nHere is the result I get in gparted and then also the contradictory result when right clicking in a directory and selecting properties:\n\nA: If you copied one drive to another using dd, the partition table is copied from one drive to another as-is, so all your partitions are of exactly the same size as they were on the old drive. The rest of your new drive is unallocated space.\nYou need to boot from Ubuntu LiveCD/USB and use gparted to resize the partition(s).\nHere's an example how unallocated space looks in gparted:\n\nThe above is true if you dd'ed the whole device to another, something like dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb. In case you created partitions on the target drive first and then copied a partition from one drive to another (something like dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1), then the partition table on the target drive is correct (i.e. it has one partition which is ~500Gb), however, the filesystem on that partition is of the same size it was on the source drive.\nTo resize an ext4 partition you need to use resize2fs command. \n   resize2fs [ -fFpPM ] [ -d debug-flags ] [ -S RAID-stride ] device [ size ]\n\n\n   The resize2fs program will resize ext2, ext3, or ext4 file systems.  It can be used to enlarge or shrink an\n   unmounted file system located on device.  If the filesystem is mounted, it can be used to expand  the  size\n   of  the  mounted filesystem, assuming the kernel supports on-line resizing.  (As of this writing, the Linux\n   2.6 kernel supports on-line resize for filesystems mounted using ext3 and ext4.).\n\n   The size parameter specifies the requested new size of the filesystem.  If  no  units  are  specified,  the\n   units  of  the  size  parameter  shall be the filesystem blocksize of the filesystem.  Optionally, the size\n   parameter may be suffixed by one of the following the units designators: 's', 'K', 'M',  or  'G',  for  512\n   byte  sectors,  kilobytes,  megabytes, or gigabytes, respectively.  The size of the filesystem may never be\n   larger than the size of the partition.  If size parameter is not specified, it will default to the size  of\n   the partition.\n\nSee man resize2fs for more details.\n", "Q: Backup recovery partition of windows 8 in GPT My friend have acer Laptop which had windows 8 pre installed and a recovery partition(SDA 7).

With the normal screen disconnected and fiddling with the \"Evdev Axis Calibration\" option it works fine, but when I hook up the normal screen again the tough mapping is shifted. If I touch the touchscreen the mouse moves to the corresponding position on the other screen.\nNeither \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\" nor \"map-to-output\" seems to work...\nAny help is greatly appreciated!\n/Henrik\n\nA: I now (on 13.04) had a similar problem but xinput map-to-output did help, if I do things in the right order.\nxinput map-to-output tweaks the \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\".\nxinput_calibrator sets \"Evdev Axis Calibration\" and is completely unaware of \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\".  It also always opens stretched to the full available output area.\nThis means that you must run xinput_calibrator on a single screen.\n\n\n*\n\n*xrandr --output <non-touch-output> --off\n\n*xinput map-to-output <touch input device> <touch-output>\n(to reset \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\" in case you've touched it before).\n\n*Calibrate with xinput_calibrator.\nYou should now have well-calibrated touch on the single screen.\n(My touchscreen was initially way off — X/Y swapped, Y inverted — so I had to run this twice, with --misclick 0.  I believe that's a property of my touchscreen, unrelated to the dual monitor situation.)\n\n*Re-enable the second screen.\nxrandr --output <non-touch-output> --on\n\n*Do map-to-output again.\n\nA: While Beni's answer will probably work for some (if not most) people, in my case xinput_calibrator was still getting confused despite the other displays being disabled. I also wasn't partial to installing closed-source drivers from the vendor.\nFortunately, using the information in this very QA and other sources (the EVDEV xorg documentation, and this answer), it turns out it's completely possible to set up everything manually as long as you're using EVDEV and Xorg (default for Kubuntu currently at least).\nSingle-session setup (via xinput)\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the device ID via xinput --list. This will be referred to as <DEVICE_ID>.\n\n*Run xinput --list-prop <DEVICE-ID> and note down the default values just in case.\n\n*Set up the Coordinate Transformation Matrix property. The easiest way would be installing ptxconf from Hrobjartur's answer and using its configure option.\n\n*You're now ready to set up axes. The first step is checking whether the X and Y coords are swapped with one another. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*press your finger/stylus on the top of your screen,\n\n*and on the bottom.\nIf the mouse pointer appears on the left and right (or vice versa), run:\nxinput --set-prop <DEVICE_ID> \"Evdev Axes Swap\" 1. Otherwise, leave this property unchanged.\n\n\n*Now, check whether the X and/or Y axes need to be inverted. This is controlled by the Evdev Axis Inversion property, with two values - X Y, where 0 is normal and 1 is inverted. So:\n\n\n*\n\n*check whether pressing on the far left of the screen places your cursor on the right. If so, you need to invert X.\n\n*check whether pressing on the very top of the screen places your cursor at the bottom. If so, you need to invert Y.\n\n*For example, inverting X and and leaving Y unchanged means running:\nxinput --set-prop <DEVICE_ID> \"Evdev Axis Inversion\" 1 0.\n\n\n*Now we get to the fun stuff - calibration. The Evdev Axis Calibration property controls it, and it's theoretically vendor specific, but it's possible to figure it out with a bit of prodding (literally). Here's what you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*check whether Evdev Axis Calibration was reset (it happened in my case after running ptxconf). If so, run xinput --set-prop <DEVICE_ID> \"Evdev Axis Calibration\" <DEFAULT_VALUES_FROM_POINT_1> (take note that while the values are comma-separated in the output, they should be space-seperated in the input).\n\n*the values could be described, at least in my case, as <FAR_RIGHT_OFFSET> <FAR_LEFT_OFFSET> <VERY_TOP_OFFSET> <VERY_BOTTOM_OFFSET>.\n\n*take your stylus, and start poking at the far right offset. Adjust the first value until the pointer is under your stylus. Don't worry if the pointer is off-target on the other axis.\n\n*do the same for the far left offset. Check if the offset on the right is still correct, if not, tweak the two values until you have a match.\n\n*do the same with the other two offsets.\n\n*check if the pointer is correctly placed on the far left middle, far right middle, top center, and bottom center of your screen. If so, you're good to go.\n\n\n*Run xinput --list-props <DEVICE_ID> and note down your final values.

From the following ouput I got the id 13 :\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SIGMACH1P USB Keyboard                    id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SOAI Gaming Mouse                         id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ eGalax Inc.

Ended up with this command:\n$ xinput set-prop 13 --type=float \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\" 0.287856, 0.000000, 0.712114, 0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000\n\nThat got it all running fine. btw I did have some issues, which seem to disappear when I used only 6 decimal places precision for the params idk if that is actually required or, more likely I just had messed-up sth else. \n", "Q: Bluetooth connection - will not auto pair/reconnect to audio device I am using Bluetooth 4.99 & bluez.\nMy audio device is paired successfully.

That causes the error message about not enough space on the device.\nDue to the broken state of your packages you will not be able to (un-)install anything with apt-get but have to use dpkg -r for the few oldest kernel images under /usr/src.\nAfter that you can run apt-get install -f to solve your problem.

An easy way to check is to do apt-get install -s codeblocks and see what happens during the simulated install.\nTarballs are a little tricky. I recommend installing build-essential and checkinstall in addition to any dependancies that codeblock needs. Download the tarball, and expand it in a working directory with tar -xf filename.tar.gz. Then read the install file if any for instructions\nTypically you need to pull in dependancies - an easy way to do this is to use apt-get build-dep. Then you run ./config (which checks if prerequisites are met and sets system specific stuff), make (which compiles), and make install(which moves the compiled files to the right places). I replace make install with checkinstall to make a deb and install that instead cause its easier to uninstall. YMMV - some applications replace make with cmake and so on. \n\nA: Since you are using Ubuntu 12.10, I'm sorry to inform you that you will still be getting the Code::Blocks 10.05 version even after adding the PPA, since according to https://launchpad.net/~pasgui/+archive/ppa/+packages the codeblocks package for 12.11 is for Precise and not for Quantal.\nAnd also, since the Code::Blocks version in the Ubuntu software repositories (quantal-release universe) https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/codeblocks is also 10.05, it might seem to be that you can't install Code::Blocks 12.11 using either the Ubuntu repositories or PPAs.\nFor the remaining installation method refer to @JourneymanGeek's answer.\nDetailed guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the .tar.gz source code for Code::Blocks 12.11 in http://prdownload.berlios.de/codeblocks/codeblocks_12.11-1.tar.gz\n\n*Open a terminal, then type cd ~/Downloads (or any download location you have presetted)\n\n*Run tar -zxf codeblocks_12.11-1.tar.gz\n\n*Run sudo apt-get build-dep codeblocks\n\n*Run cd codeblocks-12.11release8629\n\n*Run ./configure\n\n*After completion type make && sudo make install (or checkinstall to get debian packages`.\nAfter step 5 there is another method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run debuild.\n\n*Run cd ..\n\n*Run dpkg -i (the produced codeblocks packages) and it is installed!\n\nA: After several trials and errors, I have successfully installed Codeblocks 12.11 on my laptop running Ubuntu 12.04.

The Wubi (Windows Ubuntu Installer) will install Ubuntu inside your Windows Hard drive's space. For example, if you selected 30GB, then Wubi will create a partition inside your Windows' hard drive.\nFor the best performance of course you should download the ISO, burn it on a CD and install it.

When the weather is displaying, the memory usage increases over time. When the weather is not displaying the memory does not increase.\nI guess this is a bug with the weather indicator that should be reported, but reporting bugs on Launchpad is far too convoluted a process for me to undertake.\n\nA: Some process is leaking memory.  To get an idea of which process this might be, run\nps --sort -rss -eo rss,pid,command | head\n\n\nA: I suggest you start the troubleshooting process by testing the RAM with the built-in utility provided in the GRUB boot menu and eliminate \"bad RAM\" as a source of the problem. \nMemory test\n\nMemtest86+\n\nNext, check your system for broken dependencies from a terminal with sudo apt-get check and, if errors are found, rerun the command as sudo apt-get check -f to try and correct them. \nIf you please, try these steps and report back here with any results.\nLeland \n\nHi Dave, \nOk then - we've ruled out the hardware as a source of the problem. \nNext, let's examine memory usage and process settings on your computer; run these commands from a terminal prompt:  \nDisplay amount of free and used memory\nfree -m\nDisplay swap usage summary\nswapon -s\nDisplay user-process resource limits \nulimit -a\nThe screenshot below is from a clean installation of 10.04LTS.  The particulars to note from the first and second yellow-circled items are in the \"used\" column, which display memory and swap space available for the operating system to use, i.e., they're not all used up. \nThe bottom yellow-circled item displays no limits on the number of user-processes, i.e. gFTP or other application for example, that the operating system will permit the user to run. \nIf you please, try these steps and report back here with any results.\nLeland \n\n\nHi Dave, \nThe results returned from ps --sort -rss -eo rss,pid,command | head you have posted show the gnome-panel process using roughly 1.8GB of memory which seems a little unusual - that seems like a lot of memory for the Desktop Environment to be using. \nYou can get a breakdown of the memory the gnome-panel process is using by running the circled commands in the screenshot below and see where it's all going - that may reveal something that stands out. \nFor comparison, the gnome-panel process on my virtual machine is using 48MB of RAM - granted though, the 10.04 machine in these screenshots is a virtual machine I'm using for tests only and not my own desktop. \n\nGiven that, I'll put forward the next step is to isolate the problem to \"something\" in the Gnome desktop environment. \nTo test this, try installing the KDE plasma workspace which you'll find in the Ubuntu Software Centre.  \n\nOnce it's installed, reboot your computer and login with a KDE session instead of Gnome, run your applications as best you can (the desktop is completely different) to see if the \"Cannot allocate memory\" error repeats itself here. \nSimply to be clear, you'll be able to run the same CLI \"tests\" in a KDE environment as we've done in the Gnome environment and be able to compare results in examining the computer's behaviour between the two. \nIn KDE, the console application you'll be looking for is xterm which you can find from the Search dialog on the main menu. \n\nI'm going to throw in a little confidence here and say I think we're collectively on the right track to isolating the problem. \nLeland \n\nA: If you're having this issue using Ruby on Rails with Digital Ocean it's likely because you have too little RAM. Try upping the RAM from 512MB to 1GB, that fixed it for me.\n", "Q: Installation -- No Internet Connection Option I installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my laptop. I tried to right click on the right hand corner where the internet icon is, and it says Wired Network Disconnected. Below that, I see that Enable Networking has a check mark next to it. I clicked on Edit Connections, and the name of the wireless connection that I want is listed under the wireless tab, but I don't know what to do. \nI have no idea what to do. Am I missing a driver? Is there something that I'm missing? Can someone please help me?\n\nA: I'm having the same issue, so are many others. I did a little search, discovered this:\nhttp://www.upubuntu.com/2012/10/how-to-fix-unity-and-wireless-problems.html\nI have not tried it yet. Seems to work for others though. Good luck.\n", "Q: Wi-fi interferes with other devices when connected? Ok, this is kinda weirdo and not easy to explain.\nAfter the latest updates, I've noticed that my smartphone and other devices can't connect to the internet when my Ubuntu is running and connected via Wi-fi. After lots of testing (including changing my router) I discovered it's \"Ubuntu's fault\": other devices have access to the internet only when Wi-fi is off and when my laptop runs on my Windows 7 partition. Also, other devices can connect if W7 is connected via wifi. \nObviously, when I try to connect a device being far from my laptop, the problem disappears...\nThis problem started about 10 days ago and I still haven't found a solution. I've also did a fresh installation 3 days ago, hoping to resolve. \nMy idea is that it may be an issue with the latest kernels.\nAny help is more than well accepted :)\nPS: Sorry for my english, I'm an italian guy\n\nA: I resolved the problem today :D\nFor some reason, the Broadcom proprietary driver of my wireless card, doesn't work properly causing the interference described above. If you have a Broadcom integrated wireless card in your laptop and you notice this issue (I've got an HP Pavilion DV6), launching Jockey from terminal typing\njockey-gtk\n\nand disabling the proprietary driver, will do the trick. After that, be sure to reboot as suggested! Ubuntu integrated drivers will be used instead of the proprietary ones.\nI hope it may be useful in the future :)\n\nA: Definitely a weird issue. I'm actually on Elementary OS Luna. This happened after a new installation. Also I was not able to lock sudo when I tried to apt-get update.\nWhen I launched jockey-gtk (Additional Drivers) there was nothing to remove. I removed jockey-gtk from Synaptic and reinstalled and still no luck. I then booted from the live USB I used to install the OS and there was no interference with the clients connected to the WIFI modem -- because the live USB does not use proprietary drivers. While installing the OS there is an option to install 3rd party drivers in the wizard. I unchecked it and reinstalled the OS again and the issue was gone. So if the solution posted above doesn't work, reinstalling the OS without installing 3rd party drivers will do the trick. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu Server 12.10 on Proliant Microserver?

It is not enough to use the version of VirtualBox distributed in the Ubuntu package repostories. I think that you can use VBoxGuestAdditions 4.1.24 and it will work with Ubuntu 12.04 guests.

I have some really important files in the partitions that was deleted E:, F: is there anyway I could get them back.\nI am new to Ubuntu and now I am stuck on it till I try and find my files back and change my partition to NTFS so windows can install.\n\nA: Yes, and once all the partitions have been deleted, it is very difficult to recover the files, sometimes impossible.\nBasically, it depends on how the drive was formatted. \n\n\n*\n\n*If it was fast format, i.e. don't zero out the harddisk but just delete the file information (headers, etc), there is a possibility that you can recover some of the files using softwares such as TestDisk and PhotoRec.\n\n*If it was a complete format, i.e. zero out the hard disk, then it is impossible to recover data.\nIn your case, it is very difficult to recover. If you want to do it with TestDisk or similar softwares, you'd need another harddisk which has atleast the same storage space as your harddisk, and you'd need to boot from either a Live USB or some other computer and connect your hard disk to that computer.\n\nUbuntu needs ext4 or ext3 (usually) to get installed. To install Windows you'd need one more partition of type NTFS. \nIf you have only one partition, you have to compress that partition to make space for new partitions, or you can delete that partition and format it as NTFS to install Windows.\n\nA: As i answered in kind of same question:\nYes. You have lost them.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you partition is at the same space as you \"lost\" partitions were then i recommend you to IMMEDIATLY SHUT DOWN YOU UBUNTU!

(You will find it easy to use)\n\n*Recover the files that you still can recover to USB/Portable HD (But not to you Ubuntu HD)\n\n\nIt wont save all you files.

My questions are:\n1) If I purchase it for windows 8 - which one will I need ?\n2) What happens if I doesn't work / customer satisfaction ?\n3) Is this the same a Linux ? \nThank you!\n\nA: What version do i need for Windows 8?\nIf you have Windows 8, you can either install it alongside in a separate partition by downloading the desktop version, or use the Windows Installer. Either way, if your computer came with Windows 8 (rather than you installing it yourself) you should go for Ubuntu 12.10 or 12.04, nothing earlier.\nWhat happens if it doesn't work?\nYou can ask questions here, or take to the forums to find solutions to your problem. If you're not satisfied with something, do the same thing. Chances are, someone's of the same opinion, and has made an alternative!\nUnless you buy Ubuntu Advantage or Ubuntu Advantage Advanced, Canonical (the creators of Ubuntu) won't be providing you with any direct support, although some of their developers do volunteer on here as well.\nWhat about Customer Satisfaction?\nRemember that this isn't a paid product, it is something you get for free. It doesn't come with a warranty or guarantee in the traditional sense, and you can get rid of it whenever you want.\nIs this Linux?\nLinux is a free, open-source kernel, the very base of your operating system, and is what Ubuntu uses. More commonly, Linux is used to describe (sometimes incorrectly) any open-source operating system. Either way, yes, Ubuntu does boot from a Linux kernel, and is an open-source operating system.\nSo i don't need to purchase anything?\nNo, you can download, modify and share Ubuntu as you please. The DVDs are there mainly for people that either want a more professional touch, or perhaps have severe bandwidth limitations.\n\nA: *\n\n*The 12.10 release DVD, since it has the  GRUB2 bootloader and kernel support with UEFI. Or wait till 12.04.2 is released to get a more stable version.\n\n*Can't understand the question. If the purchased DVD doesn't work, contact Canonical. If you don't laike Ubuntu, install another OS.\n\n*Yes, it is based on the Linux Kernel.\n", "Q: How to 'cd' to a directory found with 'find'?

See this section of the Ubuntu community documentation for more information about abbreviations in directory names, and related concepts.\nYou ran the command cd Rubyscript. The folder name after cd did not start with a /, so it is a relative path--relative to your current location (which is /home/Peter). cd Rubyscript, run from there, is thus equivalent to:\ncd /home/Peter/Rubyscript\n\nBut the Rubyscript folder is not located in /home/Peter. As the find command said, it's located in /media/aruprakshit/FA686DE4686DA05D.\nTherefore, you should run this command instead:\ncd /media/aruprakshit/FA686DE4686DA05D/Rubyscript\n\nThat will get you there. (Assuming you have permission to enter that folder. Which you probably do--its volume name looks like a UUID, and its length indicates it's probably an NTFS volume. If you mounted an NTFS volume, you usually can enter any folder within it and perform any read or write action.)\n\nA: There is no Rubyscript in your ~ directory. You should type:\ncd /media/aruprakshit/FA686DE4686DA05D/Rubyscript\n\n", "Q: Custom Unity Quicklists not working after upgrade to 12.10 In the popular question What Custom Launchers and Unity Quicklists are available? are listed a lot of launchers with custom quicklists for Unity, that worked for Ubuntu old release, included 12.04.\nThis is a sample from the first answer:\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=Videos;Documents\n\n[Videos Shortcut Group]\nName=Videos\nExec=nautilus Videos\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Documents Shortcut Group]\nName=Documents\nExec=nautilus Documents\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nWhy that quicklists are missing after upgrading to Ubuntu 12.10?

With Windows, I have to open the browser and give my login and password to the provider through a webpage, but the connection has to be established first.\nAny tips, tricks?\n\nIn /lib/firmware/, there is a folder called RTL8192E.

I'd like to install another clean linux distro (Mint) on my 160GB (i.e. remove Windows), but I'm confused as to where the boot loader goes. Obviously I don't want it to mess up my Ubuntu installation.\nAt the installation window I'm given the following:\n/dev/sda\n  /dev/sda1 ext4\n  /dev/sda6 swap\n  /dev/sda5 swap\n/dev/sdb\n  /dev/sdb1 ntfs\n\nMy question is, I have several options for  boot loader installation . So where should I put it? Currently my system boots up and grub loads and gives me to option to choose between ubuntu (default) and optional windows.\nMy choices are\n/dev/sda ATA ST.... (400.1GB)\n/dev/sda1 Ubuntu\n/dev/sdb ATA WDC.... (160.0GB)\n/dev/sdb1 Windows 7 (loader)\n\nWhat is the difference anyways? could anyone link where this is explained or explain it?\nThank you all!\nEDIT To be specific, I wanted windows completely gone. Just two Linux distros on separate HDs.\n\nA: To get rid of such problem simply download super-boot-manager.\nYou will need to add the ppa:ingalex/super-boot-manager before. Open a terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ingalex/super-boot-manager\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install super-boot-manager\n\n\nOnce installed run the program, and select \"Grub-manager\", go under \"Parameters\", \"Param. 1\" and select the default OS to boot from. \n\nA: If you want to install it in the 160GB along with your Windows the bootloader should be installed in /dev/sdb\nNow, if you have your 160GB HDD not already partitioned you need to make space for it. If you didnt when you installed your Windows then its taking all of the /dev/sdb space except for the 100MB boot partition at sdb1, and so Mint wont have a partition to be installed in, inside of /dev/sdb\nThe only thing left is, boot windows, administrative tools, get into disk management or something like that and try to \"shrink\" or reduce volume on your actual 160GB Windows partition to make space for Mint. Take in note the program itself will tell you that is recommended to defrag the partition first so you can maximize the shrink-able MB amount.\nOnce you reduce the Windows partition, let the rest as unallocated space and in the Mint install, your /dev/sdb should be looking like:\n/dev/sdb1 - ~100MB - NTFS - Flags : boot (this is the place for bootloader)\n/dev/sdb2 - 160GB-shrinked - NTFS - Windows (windows partition=\n/dev/sdb3 - ShrinkedVolume(GB) - extended\n/dev/sdb4 - XGB - linux-swap (mint swap)\n/dev/sdb5 - RestofShrinked(GB) - ext4 - this is the / path partition (mint partition)\nThis is how it should look in the Mint installation, bootloader are always installed at first part of the disk. The rest is pretty common, you only need to reduce the Windows actual partition volume to make space for Mint and its own swap partition.\nThe bootloader job is giving the right directions for the OS to startup after the HDD has been called to boot by the BIOS. If you are trying to install the OS in the 2nd HDD then the bootloader will be located in the 2nd one (letting you choose Windows/Mint OSes). In the first HDD there is another bootloader for the time BIOS tries to boot from it (so it will give you few options even when only Ubuntu is installed, such as recovery, old kernels entries, memtest+..).\nThe choose of wich HDD startup first is up to your BIOS setup.\n", "Q: Diagnose complete hang of Ubuntu 12.04.1 Server when starting an I/O intense operation? At the moment I am trying to migrate data from a software RAID5 (6 disks) over to a software RAID1. The command of choice was:\nrsync -avxHACPX /mnt/old/ /mnt/new/\n\nHowever, after the first few files the machine locks up completely. First I thought that this was because the disks were connected using a USB3 extension card, but even when directly connecting them using SATA the situation won't change.\nAt the moment I am running a long SMART test using smartctl, but that will take a long time to finish. And in the meantime I'd like to find out how to diagnose such an issue.\nSeveral years ago one used to be able to follow the kernel log on one of the terminals, but it seems Ubuntu doesn't provide that anymore. Since the log files don't contain anything useful whatsoever (likely because they don't get written once the error condition occurs) I'm left wondering how to diagnose such an issue?\nMy question is also more of a general question about diagnosing such an issue when I come across it. Right now the only chance I seem to have is to note down the files that contain errors and then skip those when copying. But that's the actual task. On a more abstract level I'd like to learn about strategies like what I could do in the past by watching the kernel console.\nNB: I prefixed my invocation of rsync with ionice -c 3 nice first, but then after this gave the error, removed it. The error occurs independent of this.\nFurther information: source volume is XFS, target disk is ext4. I am always mount -o ro,remounting the source volume before starting the copy operation. The source volume also happens to be an LVM2 volume layered on top of the software RAID5 (md).\n\nsmartctl -a output (filtered):\n# for i in $(blkid |grep '/sd'|cut -b 1-8|sort|uniq); do echo $i;  smartctl -a $i|grep -A 1 '^SMART Error Log Version'; done\n/dev/sda\nSMART Error Log Version: 1\nNo Errors Logged\n/dev/sdb\nSMART Error Log Version: 1\nATA Error Count: 1\n/dev/sdc\nSMART Error Log Version: 1\nNo Errors Logged\n/dev/sdd\nSMART Error Log Version: 1\nNo Errors Logged\n/dev/sde\nSMART Error Log Version: 1\nNo Errors Logged\n/dev/sdf\nSMART Error Log Version: 1\nNo Errors Logged\n/dev/sdg\nSMART Error Log Version: 1\nNo Errors Logged\n/dev/sdh\nSMART Error Log Version: 1\nNo Errors Logged\n\n/dev/sdb is one of the physical disks that comprise the source volume's physical volume.\n\nThe iostat output you asked for:\nsdc               0.00     3.50    0.00    2.00     0.00    22.00    22.00     0.45  226.00    0.00  226.00  78.00  15.60\nsdd              38.50     0.00   86.00    0.00  6982.00     0.00   162.37     0.27    3.14    3.14    0.00   2.95  25.40\nsde              39.50     0.00   88.00    0.00  7064.00     0.00   160.55     0.43    4.95    4.95    0.00   4.30  37.80\nmd1               0.00     0.00  625.00    0.00 34984.00     0.00   111.95     0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00   0.00   0.00\nsdf              40.00     0.00   84.50    0.00  6994.00     0.00   165.54     0.40    4.73    4.73    0.00   4.43  37.40\nsdg               0.00   107.00    0.00  250.00     0.00 18018.00   144.14     1.29    5.06    0.00    5.06   0.61  15.20\nsdh               0.00   107.00  251.00    6.50 16034.00  2434.00   143.44     2.54    9.69    9.74    7.69   0.60  15.40\nmd6               0.00     0.00    0.50  113.50     2.00  2434.00    42.74     0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00   0.00   0.00\nmd5               0.00     0.00    0.00    0.00     0.00     0.00     0.00     0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00   0.00   0.00\nBIGDISK           0.00     0.00  625.00    0.00 34984.00     0.00   111.95     2.59    4.19    4.19    0.00   0.92  57.80\n\nDevice:         rrqm/s   wrqm/s     r/s     w/s    rkB/s    wkB/s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz   await r_await w_await  svctm  %util\nsda              38.50     0.00   86.50    0.00  6982.00     0.00   161.43     0.40    4.58    4.58    0.00   4.09  35.40\nsdb              39.00     0.00   87.00    0.00  6898.00     0.00   158.57     0.38    4.37    4.37    0.00   3.91  34.00\nsdc               0.00     0.00    0.00    0.00     0.00     0.00     0.00     0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00   0.00   0.00\nsdd              40.50     0.00   86.00    0.00  7028.00     0.00   163.44     0.30    3.51    3.51    0.00   3.16  27.20\nsde              37.50     0.00   86.50    0.00  6972.00     0.00   161.20     0.39    4.51    4.51    0.00   4.05  35.00\nmd1               0.00     0.00  626.50    0.00 34772.00     0.00   111.00     0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00   0.00   0.00\nsdf              38.50     0.00   86.50    0.00  7002.00     0.00   161.90     0.42    4.86    4.86    0.00   4.23  36.60\nsdg               0.00   470.00    0.00  277.50     0.00 80506.00   580.22    68.39  246.57    0.00  246.57   2.54  70.40\nsdh               0.00   459.50  128.50  152.00  8224.00 71834.00   570.82    72.01  256.88    6.66  468.42   2.52  70.80\nmd6               0.00     0.00    0.00  612.50     0.00 71834.00   234.56     0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00   0.00   0.00\nmd5               0.00     0.00    0.00    0.00     0.00     0.00     0.00     0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00   0.00   0.00\nBIGDISK           0.00     0.00  626.50    0.00 34772.00     0.00   111.00     2.69    4.30    4.30    0.00   0.93  58.20\n\n/dev/sdb is the device smartctl reports with errors.\n\nA: To answer the question and give further pointers to other people stumbling over this.

I need step by step instructions. I did a Google search but only found instructions on rc5 and below. \n\nA: Instructions for installing a new \"mainline\" kernel aren't specific for any version. Just install the packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the download page for Ubuntu mainline kernel packages.\n\n*Select the kernel version - e.g. v3.8-rc7-raring\n\n*Download the packages fit for your architecture. For 64 bit this is all amd64 marked, for 32-bit this is i386. Also pick the architecture-independent packages marked with all. So:\n\n\n*\n\n*64-bit: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n*32-bit: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n\n*Install them all at once:\nsudo dpkg -i /path/to/Downloads/linux-*3.8.0*.deb\n\n\n*Update your Grub bootloader (most general installations are running Grub).\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n*Done.\n\nA: You can download the source and build, or use deb packages found in http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.8-rc7-raring/\n3 packages should be downloaded, depending on your architecure (amd64, i386, or armhf). linux-headers-3.8.0-030800rc7_3.8.0-030800rc7.201302081635_all.deb is needed regardless of your platform. Once downloaded, open a shell prompt (xterm), cd to Downloads or directory/folder where the files were downloaded, and run 'sudo dpkg -i *.deb'. Once installed, reboot and check the kernel version via 'uname -r' from a shell prompt. Good luck and have fun.\nUpdate: For all versions after v3.8-rc3 (including the latest v3.8.0), there is a conflict with virtualbox due to macros that were removed in include/linux/init.h. To properly build, one must either patch virtualbox source -or- use v3.8-rc3's version of the init.h header file.

Try selecting a default mode, as described in a linuxmint article which applies to drivers with a modeset parameter.  I've quoted part of the article below, but for more background see the article itself.  The general idea is to tell grub to temporarily (ie, for the current boot) turn off video  features that may be causing problems.  If turning those features off alleviates the symptoms, then do a web search concentrating on the video card features that were turned off.  When the system is running, you can also make parameter changes permanent by editing /boot/grub/menu.lst or perhaps /etc/default/grub as described elsewhere (1, 2, 3, 4).  \nFrom the linuxmint article:\n\n•  Reboot and wait to see the initial boot screen of GRUB with a list of operating systems. Tap a cursor key to avoid automatic boot.\n  • Select your choice ... with the cursor and then press the [tab] key to get the full boot grub commad line.\n  • Go to the line starting with the word linux and ending with the words: quiet splash\n  • [Add a modeset=0 parameter] at the end of the long grub command line [...] Use the parameter related to the brand or chipset of your video card [eg] use nouveau  or nvidia for nvidia based cards ... use radeon for amd/ati cards, i915 for intel based motherboards, [eg]\n\nnvidia.modeset=0\nnouveau.modeset=0\nradeon.modeset=0\ni915.modeset=0 \nr128.modeset=0 \n\n\n•  If you don't know the brand you may use just one word:   nomodeset\n  • Press [Ctrl]+[X] to boot with this added parameter. This parameter will not be saved, just used in this single boot and nothing is damaged. To cancel without changes press [Esc].\n\n\nA: SOLVED! I took a chance and did a clean install of Ubuntu 12.10 from an iso image I burned to disc. Now everything works even better than it did before! And OMG Ubuntu 12.10 what a fantastic new look along with a bunch of nice new bells and whistles! The fresh instill is ENTIRELY different than what I had with just the upgrade to vs 12.10. Congratulations to all of you who worked on it. BTW, everywhere in the documentation it DOES say to make a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.10 rather than just doing an upgrade since SNAFU's are more apt to take place from doing a \"lazy\" upgrade. I am just so happy that I did take the chance on the fresh install of vs 12.10 rather than just playing it safe and doing another fresh instillation of Ubuntu 12.04 to try and correct the errors that occurred during the sloppy upgrade process and which are now not present.

Now I want to remove it but when I try it returns Drive write protected.\nI have tried sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/devsdb bs=512 count=1, but that returns Read only file system. I have tried many different USB format programs and all say the same. It does not have a switch on it! It is a 32gb CoreMicro USB flash drive. How do I remove Ubuntu from this USB drive?\n\nA: then you have really problem on that drive cause They are no chance to unlock it, my friend have this too and i tried everything on it but can't format or everything.\n", "Q: GRUB messed up after plugging in external hard drive I connected an external hard drive in which I have a dual boot of Win 7 and Ubuntu on my Ubuntu laptop to transfer some files. Now when I boot my laptop, it shows GRUB with the partitions from the external hard drive even though the latter is not connected to the computer. Obviously if I try to load some of the partitions from the external disk it fails. \nHow can I repair my MBR?\n\nA: I fixed this using: \nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: I believe you updated the Ubuntu on the external hard drive using your laptop. The easiest way to fix this is to select the Ubuntu (the one installed in your laptop) and start your laptop with Ubuntu. Then run Update Manager. Once grub is updated, the external partitions will no longer show up. (Perform this while the external hard drive is not connected to the laptop).\n", "Q: How can I change the default location of sidebar content folders to folders in partition shared by win7 & ubuntu I have a partition named Storage which is used by both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 where I have my music, videos, pictures and downloads.  I'd like to have the sidebar icons with these same names (eg. Music, Pictures, etc.) on Ubuntu link to the folders in Storage with the same name rather than Home/Music etc.\nThe problem is that I am super new to Ubuntu, I've been researching and i think it has to do with editing ~/.config/user-dir.dirs but i have no idea how to navigate to this location, much less how to edit the file.\n\nA: Probably the simplest way for you could be this:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you're in your home folder where you see \"Documents\", \"Music\", \"Pictures\" and \"Video\" in Nautilus, press F3 which will switch to dual-pane mode.\n\n*Go to the other pane and click on the \"Storage\" partition to open it and make sure you have the same folder names there.\n\n*Now go back to the first pane (your home folder) and first check if these folders are empty. If they're not, move contents (select, press down Shift key, drag and drop) to the respective folders in the opposite pane (Storage). And now delete these empty folders (safer: move to trash).\n\n*Now go back to the second pane (Storage), select these folders, press down Ctrl+Shift, and then drag and drop to the first pane (your home folder) to create shortcuts (symbolic links) there.\n\n\nThat's it.\nBut you might also prefer to make your shared partition Storage mounted every time you login. Otherwise these links will look broken until you click and mount it. To do this you need to enter this partition in a system file called fstab like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter this command in Terminal (entering your login password when asked): sudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\n*In this file add a line similar to the one below (assuming your partiton is in ntfs format, merely entering your partition uuid number instead of the example) at the end of the list:\nUUID=5D07479B6A5F6512    /media/Storage    ntfs-3g    defaults,nls=utf8,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=027,fmask=137      0    0\nYou can get your partition uuid with this terminal command: **ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid**\nOr you can start GParted, select the partition and then \"Information\" from the context menu.\n\nA: Another - More GUI - Way is using the Ubuntu Tweak tool to specify custom locations for those user folders.\nTo install, you need to enter the following commands (typing your login password when asked) in Terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nThen start Ubuntu Tweak, go to Admins and then User Folder.\nThere you can select each user folder, click Change button at the bottom, and select the folder you want.\nAfter this you might also prefer mounting the Storage partition each time you login by modifying the system file fstab as described in my first answer.\n", "Q: Disk Image Mounter: Value too large for define data type I have a genuine iso file of AutoCAD ~2.5gb, I can mount it in windows with traditional application like Poweriso & Alcohol but while in nautilus the error mentioned in title occurs.\nNow how can I eliminate this error? And, or how do I extract iso to its contents at-least Winrar can treat iso as an archive....\n\nA: I don't know what nautilus does here but you can mount the image on the command line without any problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory where you want to mount it, e.g. sudo mkdir /media/AutoCAD (if you want to use an existing directory it should be empty) \n\n*Type sudo mount -o loop /path/to/file /path/to/mountPoint, e.g. sudo mount ~/downloads/AutoCAD.iso /media/AutoCAD\n\n*Access the files via /media/autoCAD with any application\n\n*When you are done unmount it again with sudo umount /media/AutoCAD (it is umount, not unmount)\n\n*If you want delete the directory again with sudo rmdir /media/AutoCAD\n\nA: The alternative to Alcohol 120% or DAEMON Tools Lite is the wine command and AcetoneISO app, it's useful but not 100%:\n\n*\n\n*Here is an explanation how to install wine.\n\n\n*To install AcetoneISO is to type the following commands in Terminal:\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install acetoneiso\nTo set up to work any Windows app with one or more virtual disks, follow the steps:\n\n*\n\n*Start AcetoneISO window, and then click the button [ Mount ] and select one .iso file to mount. Once it's done, the virtual disk must be in the following directory: /home/<user>/virtual-drives/1\n\n\n*In Terminal, type the following command to setup wine to get the virtual disk: winecfg\n\n\n*Once the wine window is opened; #1. Click the tab Drives; #2. Click the button [ Add... ] and select the letter 'D' and click [ OK ]; #3. In the path box, type the directory made by AcetoneISO /home/<user>/virtual-drives/1; #4. Click [ Show Advanced ] and select the type: CD-ROM; #5. Finally at the bottom of the window, click [ Apply ] and [ OK ].\n\n\n*To install an app from the virtual disk such as /home/<user>/virtual-drives/1 is to type the following command in Terminal:\n$ cd /home/<user>/virtual-drives/1\n$ wine setup.exe\n\n\n*To run the app after the installation, is to type the following command in Terminal:\n\n$ cd /home/<user>/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/<APP_DIRECTORY>/\n$ wine file.exe\n\n*\n\n*To make a Desktop shortcut of a Windows app installed, here is an explanation how to.\n\nThat's all, best regard.\n", "Q: I get several \"broken file\" errors when creating my boot stick While creating my boot stick I get 199 separate errors during the ISO extracting process that all say data error in (insert file name here) file is broken then it sticks on 99% of the ISO extraction and only offers me an option to close the installer.\nWhat have I done wrong?\n\nA: *\n\n*Did you md5sum check the downloaded iso?  \nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM\nCheck the number against the listing in the link for your release listed at http://releases.ubuntu.com under the MD5SUMS link.\n\n*If using a CD/DVD, did you burn the disc as slowly as possible?\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto\n\n*Did you select the media check before trying to install?\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/CDIntegrityCheck\n\n*Did you ever do a \"memory check\" (another live-media menu choice) on your PC?\nDoing the above can save you a lot of time struggling with a bad install media.\n\nA: Something could have gone wrong while downloading the ISO file.

I connect my iPod and iPad to my computer to charge them. I do not want them to automatically mount on the desktop.\nHow can I keep using my computers many USB ports for charging without being bothered by auto-mounted devices?\n\nA: Configuring Automounting\nTo enable or disable automount open a terminal and type dconf-editor followed by the [Enter] key.\nBrowse to org.gnome.desktop.media-handling.\nThe automount key controls whether to automatically mount media. If set to true, then Nautilus will automatically mount media such as user-visible hard disks and removable media on start-up and media insertion.\nThere is another key org.gnome.desktop.media-handling.automount-open. This controls whether to automatically open a folder for automounted media.\nIf set to true, then Nautilus will automatically open a folder when media is automounted.

After a long search I found the solution here: Wireless card Realtek RTL8723AE-BT is not recognized. The solution with the dropbox link worked, but not for long.\nNot long after that I had problems with the card in windows AND ubuntu (and I still have them sometimes). Sometimes the card just does not work. I have looked for a solution and let people from the IT-service in our school look but nobody of us could find a solution.\nAfter that, I upgraded the kernel of ubuntu, which has the next problem because the driver only supported until kernel 3.3. But in the same article that I've mentioned before, someone gave a second link for kernel 3.5. But from that time, everytime I restart my computer the driver isn't working automatically. I had to enable it as an LKM with modprobe.\nIt worked for a while, but suddenly it stopped working. It doesn't work anymore to use modprobe to enable it and I've tried restarting, reinstalling the drivers, ... I installed almost everythink I could think of and what I could find on the internet.\nDo anyone have a solution for this? It's so irritating... Thanks!\nEDIT: Now working again (for a time...)\n\nA: I#ve had similar problems. \nI usually rebuilt the drivers from the Realtek file \"rtl_92ce_92se_92de_8723ae_linux_mac80211_0006.0514.2012\" when updating to a new kernel manually, using the commands:   \nsudo su \nmake clean \nmake \nsudo make install \nsudo modprobe rtl8723e\n\nWith Kernel 3.2.0-38 this didn't work anymore.

It's described at wikidevi.\nAbout ndiswrapper I can say only one thing. It isn't support master mode.\n\nfirmware-b43-installer says This card is actually not tested. Please install the driver manually.\nAfter downloading and unpacking via b43-fwcutter (described at link), but no results. Driver is installed, lsmod shows loaded modules, but wi-fi card was unreachable. \n\nA: I would first recommend reading this question and the answer provided: Installing Broadcom Wireless Drivers (Just to have the same driver install)\nSecond I would first try to look to see if this Broadcom Wireless card, using the wl module, supports Ad-hoc mode. For example, in the wiki about broadcom modules I can see this wireless card when using the wl module listed as not supporting Ad-Hoc, Monitor or even Injections. This does not mean it is permanent, it just means that the development of this card is not yet mature enough for this features (It will eventually have them). I happen to have a BCM4313 that has the same issue. I can connect to other devices, even Ad-Hoc ones, but I can not create an Ad-Hoc one.\nNow, there might some changes looking into newer kernel versions. Since you are in the 3.5.x kernel version I can only add that:\nIn the kernel version 3.6.x, regarding the Network part, there were little updated to Broadcom cards.\nIn the kernel version 3.7.x, same as above, there were other updates to Broadcom cards.\nThere is a very good link regarding this Model created by izx that I mention in the link about installing Broadcom cards. His answer is here.\nAt the end, if you still have a wireless card that does not support Ad-Hoc, then you are like me, we would have to wait for future implementation of this (Or use a \"modified\" version of the driver.. injected or otherwise).\n", "Q: How do I move a file from one place to another in ubuntu?

You should avoid downloading and installing stuff manually (not from Software Center), at least until you're a bit more proficient with Linux. Since unetbootin is in Ubuntu repositories, you can install it from Software Center or using sudo apt-get install unetbootin. \nHowever, this may not even be necessary - there is a program installed in Ubuntu by default which is called \"Startup Disk Creator\".

In the meantime I can use the wifii with WEP provided I use a fixed IP. I simply checked what numbers are available on the router, and pick one that is unlikely to be picked. Set the dns/mask/gateway and I am all set. Connect without a hitch.  Not a satisfactory solution, but a workaround.\n-- Halldór\n\nA: I have faced the same problem before. I am not an expert at this, but have you tried using Edit Connections? May be there is a problem in configuration of the Wifi in Ubuntu. Your internet might work if you fix it. Check the exact configuration used in Windows (shared/open etc). Then use the exact same configuration for Wifi in Ubuntu.\n\nA: I'm no expert but it looks like it might be a problem with IPv6 addressing.  I've experienced a similar problem and fixed it by turning off IPv6.  This is, of course, not really a solution to the underlying problem, which would be \"why is IPv6 addressing not working?\" but it got my wireless working again - might help you as well.\nFrom terminal:\nsudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\nNow add these lines at the end of the sysctl.conf file:\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\nSave and close, might need to reboot.\n\nA: Looking at your syslog....\nAssociation succeeds but the DHCP client receives no reply from the DHCP server to its DHCPDISCOVER packets.\nCheck your DHCP server configuration: is it set up to reject unknown MAC addresses and is your Wi-Fi interface's MAC address listed?\n\nA: Reconfigure the router to another authentication mode (for example WPAPSK with TKIP encryption). It seems WEP may be a problem on many Linux versions with a variety of drivers.\n\nBackground:\nI had a similar problem with 16.04 on an Asus laptop with Mediatek drivers. I could connect to other routers, but not my home router that was set up to use WEP. I tried many of the suggested solutions, but none of them worked. The solution in the end was to reconfigure the router to another authentication mode (WPAPSK with TKIP encryption in my case) and that fixed it for me. From other comments it looks like WEP may be a problem on many Linux versions with a variety of drivers. So if you're having problems with a WEP connection, look to the router config rather your Linux setup.\n", "Q: How to inject or know if my wireless card is injectable what ways or methods exist to know if a wireless card is injectable or can be injected (Packet injection).

You should be able to do it.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu\nRegarding the mounting related query\nWhen you mount a disc normally with the file browser (nautilus etc) it mounts disks by interacting with udisks behind the scenes.\nYou can do the same thing on the command line with the udisks tool. \neg\n/usr/bin/udisks --mount /dev/sdb1\nThe bit after --mount is the device name of the partition you want to mount. (/dev/something)\nAlternately try mounting the CD using the mount command.You can check the MAN page for \"mount\" if you are new to mount command.\n", "Q: How to set root proxy settings via command line?

Could someone really help!!!?\n\nA: \nthe next time I format my pc\n\nThis might have something to do with your problem.\nYou need to ensure that you only format the 10GB partition that contains Ubuntu, and leave the rest untouched.\nIf you are formatting using the Ubuntu installer, then you need to tell it not to use the \"whole drive\" but instead point it to that 10GB partition and tell it to use that only.\nIf you could provide more information about what you are doing when you format your computer, that might help.\n\nA: You don't have to do anything special with partitioning.  If you don't want to lose your existing data when you reinstall Ubuntu, then you just need to tell it to upgrade/replace the existing install, or do manual partitioning, tell it to use the existing partition, and do NOT check the format box.\n", "Q: What is Jack Audio? I have problems with Hydrogen+JACK I want to do a lot of music editing, recording, etc. First of all I installed Hydrogen and along with it came this 'Jack'. After I use hydrogen, my system sounds stop working and start again only after restarting. I tried Googling this problem and seems like several others have this problem too. The solutions there are actually some explanations and I don't have the patience to read all those pages!\nWhat I want regarding JACK audio is:\n\n\n*\n\n*A simple and proper understanding of what this software does so that solutions to this problem make sense. When we go to their actual website, they have all this long story of \"Do you want to .... blah blah\". When we go to the Wikipedia article, they straight away demoralize us with all technical terms.\n\n*How I can close it along with Hydrogen so that my system sounds return to normal (OR)\nHow I can make all my system functions works along with JACK. In this case, Jack will have to start with every boot.\n\n*Hydrogen's default MIDI driver is ALSA (even when there is a jackmidi option); then why is jack needed at all?\n\nA: Ubuntu uses PulseAudio by default. This is a sound server application based on ALSA with customizations to integrate it well in the Ubuntu desktop environment, and to operate well with all default applications.\nThis is very much different for JACK, a more professional sound server aimed at music production applications, possibly in a realtime environment. Therefore the more ambitious a software is the more likely it will make use of JACK. Which sound server a software uses is entirely up to the developers.\n\nBecause of the more professonal audience we do need to have the patience to read the documentation as only then we are able to make use use JACK's features aimed at our special tasks.\n\nTo be able to run both JACK, and PulseAudio there is quite some effort to integrate JACK into pulseaudio.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*jack sound server how to?\n\n*Jack and pulseaudio\n\n*How can I use Jack for all my system sounds?\n\nA: You've got all the JACK info in Takkat's answer.\nHowever, it doesn't tell how to restore sound after using Hydrogen. I've run into the same problem, and after a little experimenting and talking to the Hydrogen guys, I've found out the only way that works for me is to kill the jackd process:\nkillall jackd\n\nThis is what happens:\n\nThe cause for that behaviour is that hydrogen starts jack if it is installed and if no other audio system was explicitly set in the hydrogen preferences. Hydrogen does not stop jack on shutdown, so the service is still running and may block other audio.\nSo how to solve that problem?\nA) You can remove jackd if you don't need it\nB) You can select an appropriate audio driver in the preferences panel\n\nFrom: https://github.com/hydrogen-music/hydrogen/issues/134\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu 12.10 freezing and windows becoming greyed out?

I have successfully installed Ubuntu and it runs perfectly. But, why is there only a pink and purple screen while it boots?\nMy machine specs are 2nd Gen i3 2.4ghz, 8gb RAM, Intel HD graphics and AMD Radeon HD switchable.\n\nA: In my case I also see the \"pink and purple\" screen when booting because of speed related checks. I am assuming this is normal since the PC boots too fast for the plymouth logo (The cool Ubuntu logo with the animation) to appear, it simply defaults to a basic screen (The pink and purple one).\n(The above needs verification from additional users since I have only tested this with my computers and some friends. Faster computers or booting faster means skipping the animated logo).\nOn my fast computers (Core 2 Duo 8500 and an i7 2600) this always happens. For a slower (still fast) one a Pentium 4 2.4Ghz, I can see the loading screen fine (The ubuntu logo).\nBTW, Updates are done automatically, you will get a Update Manager window saying \"Hey buddy, you got some new updates ready\".

I recently bought an Alesis iO4, a 4 microphone USB input device, which, according to this site works under Linux \"completely\", and was tested using Ubuntu 9.04. So I thought it was a good bet it would work with my 12.10 Ubuntu laptop.\nWhen I connect it by USB to my laptop, it is recognized under the sound settings, and if I speak into the microphones I can see a response:\n\nSo far so good. However, in Audacity, when I press \"record\", I see no response whatsoever. My main concern is Audacity, but I tried also using Ubuntu's \"Sound Recorder\" utility, and it also showed no response in its level meter when I spoke into the mike, so I think this isn't just an Audacity problem.\nI looked into Audacity's preferences, and under Host in the Interface section, the only option is ALSA. Under Device in the Recording section, there are four options. HDA:Intel is my on-board sound card. I'm not sure what the difference between pulse, default, and sysdefault is, but in any case, selecting any of them does not seem to change anything.\n\nWhy is my sound device seen by the OS but not by Audacity (or any other software)?\nHow do I set it up so that Audacity takes input from this device?\n\nUpdate: According to a very helpful person on the Audacity forums, the problem I'm reporting here is most likely caused by a bug in ALSA. The current version of ALSA in the Ubuntu repositories does not seem to contain the necessary patch, so I'm hoping it will be updated soon.\n\nA: It is an issue with Audacity getting your mic's input.. I had the same issue with Teamspeak and still do with Skype. Basically you need to play around with the host, and usually under Recording using the default device works. :)\n\nA: Thanks to very helpful advice on the Audacity forums, and also a little lucky experimentation, I have discovered a workable solution.\nThe key is that the iO4 must be plugged in before the laptop boots. If I try to plug it in any other time after that, it does not work as described in the question. If I plug it in before booting, then it's very easy. Audacity can select the device independentaly of any other sound settings and will record all four channels.\nI believe this might be a bug in that a USB device should be able to work even when plugging in after booting the computer (all my other USB devices work this way). But I will file a bug report for that. For the time being, I can at least use my device as intended, so the issue as originally outlined can be considered closed.\n\n", "Q: Why does 32 bit and 64 bit Ubuntu OS change the behavior of the r8169 LAN module? This question is posed because I finished building a new rig with a GA-990FXA-UD3 mobo, unlocked FX 4100 proc, 16gb RAM, and GT 640 graphix card.  Started it up and tested the mobo (via BIOS) and all was beautiful with it and all its many ports.  Then I grabbed a copy of Ubuntu 12.04 64bit and fired up the Live disc.  Besides not recognizing my two monitors off the rip, things seemed okay except I was getting a Wired Connection disconnected pop up in the top right hand corner.  Then I noticed that several peripherals (USB) were not lit up.  Tested all the USB ports; only two were live.  Tested my LAN CAT5 cable to my router with another computer; it was live.\nShut down the rig and fired it up a couple more times with the same results.  Then I grabbed another disc, Xubuntu 64bit; same thing.  Grabbed an Ultimate Edition 3.5 64bit; same thing.  Hours later I thought that it was related to the Realtek r8169 module.  Then by some chance I grabbed an older Ubuntu version; 10.04 LTS.  However, I did not realize that it was 32bit.  Everything worked; USB, LAN, etc.  So I installed 10.04 Ubuntu (again did not realize that it was 32bit) and everything worked great.  Decided on a whim to upgrade through Ubuntu to 12.04.

It was only then that I realized I had 32bit installed.\nImmediately, I grabbed the 12.04 64bit Live DVD and rebooted.  Same problems.  There is no doubt that the hardware that I have supports 64bit so that is not the issue.  Why the 64bit kernel and the 32bit kernel act so differently in (seemingly) compatible hardware is beyond me.  \nDoes anybody have some explanation about this strange phenom?

The default option is to have gman open the man pages within an xterm session. This can be modified to suit your taste with four other options.\nThe other viewing options available are:\n\n*\n\n*ghostview\n\n*Evince\n\n*LocalBrowse\n\n*NetBrowse\n\nIn order to change the application used for viewing, select View from the menu and then select the radio button next to your preferred application, as shown below:\n\nThe last two options require having the man2html package installed on your system and will bring up the man pages in your default browser.\n\nA: If you know Emacs -- it has a woman command, where you should type in the page you'd like to read. woman has a top level menu and there you can, in particular, generate a clickable TOC.\n\nA: In Kubuntu via Krunner (Alt+F2) type #ls or any other command. Just add a '#' in front.\nsee also: http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner#Issue_.28shell.29_commands\n\nA: I find GTKMan very promising.\nHere a screenshot of it in action: \n \n\nA: I liked Justin Solm's answer in that he added a line to his .bashrc to replace the man command with his gui man of choice, yelp.  That is what I wanted, however sometimes I am running w/o X (such as through SSH). I wanted it to automatically fall back to the commandline.\nAt another post I found answers about how to do that, mostly those were checking the DISPLAY variable. That is good but one answer included a C program called RunningX that actually checked to ensure the DISPLAY variable is actually valid rather than just defined and non-empty. Even better! I recommend going over there and getting it!\nHere is what I ended up with:\nman () {\n    if RunningX\n    then\n        yelp \"man:$@\";\n    else\n        /usr/bin/man \"$@\";\n    fi\n}\n\nI'm sure this could be adapted for use with Gman, KDE's help center or whatever man viewer one prefers. It could be adapted for other uses besides manpage browsing as well.\n\nA: You might want to try xdg-open which fires up the desktop environment's native help tool (yelp for GNOME, khelpcenter for KDE,...):\nxdg-open man:printf\n\n\nA: So out of all this answer I usually use this way, when I need to refer any manual. \nman ls>/tmp/ls.txt && gedit /tmp/ls.txt\n\ninstead of gedit use any text editor.\n\nA: I'm using this trick that works for man pages well: \nman bash |yad --text-info #or |zenity --text-info\n\n(requires yad or zenity, usually exists in your linux distro).\nIn this way you have GUI interface without the need of any external tool other than yad/zenity which usually exist in your system.\nYou can scroll with mouse, and most important for me using gtk3.0 version of yad (default today) i can scroll even with my touchscreen.\nPS: You need to maximize the yad / zenity window to see all the contents correctly. \nAs a more permanent solution, i created a tiny script called mang (no extension) under /usr/bin and as soon as i chmod +x mang i was able to call mang (instead of man) from anywhere as simple as `mang cat' . \nFor those guys who like to play, this is the content of mang script:\n#!/bin/bash\n# place this file under /usr/bin , and chmod +x this file in order to be able to call it \nif [[ -z $1 ]];then\n    echo \"You need to provide a manual\"\nelse\n    man $1 |yad --text-info --height=500 --width=800 --center --title=\"Man Pages of $1\" --wrap --show-uri &\nfi\nexit\n\nTips : --show-uri makes the links inside man pages clickable . Operator & sends the yad window to background , mang is terminated and terminal is free.\n\nA: Currently, I'm developing a GTK front-end for man pages using Vala.

I have several music files all in individual folders by artist name that I want to copy to one location so rhythmbox can import all the files from the single location. I've seen simple program solutions to this but none for Ubuntu. Any suggestions?\n\nA: To move the files do this:\nfind /my/files/path -iname \"*.mp3\" -exec mv {} /home/user/music \\;\nIt works like this, the first /my/files/path is where you want to look. The part that says /home/user/music is where you want to move all files to. So let us say you have all music inside your home folder in /home/jon/music and want to move it to home/jon/newmusic then do this:\nfind /home/jon/music -iname \"*.mp3\" -exec mv {} /home/jon/newmusic \\;\nIf it is on the same drive the origin and destination then it will do it really fast. If it is in another hard drive like /media/jon/backup/music then it will depend on hard drive speed.\nIf you prefer to copy instead of move the files, you must use cp:\nfind /home/jon/music -iname \"*.mp3\" -exec cp {} /home/jon/newmusic \\;\n\n\nA: Took it from here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1385966\nDO NOT ACCIDENTALLY DO THIS IN YOUR HOME FOLDER.\nChange to the top directory containing all these files and execute \nfind ./ -type f -exec cp '{}' ./ \\;\nAccording to the man page for find you might need to escape the {} too.\n\nA: Or if You prefer scripts:\n#!/bin/bash\n# to get description use the -h flag\n\n# ==========\n# preambula:\n\nPROGNAME=${0##*/}\nPROGVERSION=1.0\nName=\"*\"\ndestDir=`basename ${0##*/} .bash`\n\n# colors:\nBLUE='\\033[94m'\nGREEN=\"\\e[0;32m\"\nRED='\\033[91m'\nBLACK='\\033[0m'\n\nusage()\n{\ncat << EO\nUsage: $PROGNAME <folder>\n\nCopies files matching rgxp (default to all files) from the current dir\nand its child dirs to the specified dir (default to $destDir).\n\nI recomment back-up files before running this script.\n\nOptions:\nEO\ncat <<EO | column -s\\& -t\n\n  -d, --dest & destination dir (default to $destDir)\n  -n, --name & files-of-interest shell-style rgxp (default to $Name)\n \n  -h, --help & show this output\n  -v, --version & show version information\n      --nocolors & disable colors in output.

Windows was Installed First and Ubuntu Second. Now Windows is all virus- Virus and I want to format it. but once I format and reinstall windows the Bootloader won't show any options to boot into Ubuntu. The Bootloader will be of windows by default. How can I format Windows but keep the Bootloader of Ubuntu ?\n\nA: This will only work if this was a GRUB dual boot. If you have used wubi to install it, then recovery is a bit harder.\nFirst, create an Ubuntu Live CD or thumb drive.\nNext, boot into the CD/Pen drive, and use the \"try ubuntu\" option. \nThe remaining steps are from here:\nNow, open the terminal and type sudo fdisk -l. Find out which partition is the \"Linux\" partition. Let's call it /dev/sdaX.\nNow, run:\nsudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt \nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc \nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc \nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\nsudo update-grub\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo umount /mnt/dev \nsudo umount /mnt/proc\nsudo umount /mnt/sys \nsudo umount /mnt/usr\nsudo umount /mnt\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: If you mean format Windows with the bootloader created (Assuming with Wubi) inside of it, then it is not possible (At least to my knowledge). This is because the boot loader is still inside the Windows environment and when you format that partition, well you pretty much are eliminating everything in it, including the boot part or at least a part of the boot part related to the system (In the case of a separated system partition for this).\nYou need and I highly recommend (Which is much better) to have the bootloader outside of the Windows environment, first for safety reasons, second for performance reasons. This is done with a LiveDVD or LiveUSB of Ubuntu. The reason behind this and also the reason (One of many as to why I do not recommend using Wubi) is because:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have the boot part that manages Windows and Ubuntu inside the Windows environment and somehow Windows gets corrupted, you loose both. Even the option to boot from Ubuntu to repair Windows is gone (Assuming you do not have in that moment a Live Ubuntu CD/DVD/USB).\n\n*There has been many cases where using Wubi has resulted in loosing by corruption do to Windows either the Linux boot part or both. You do not even have to do a lot of research for this, just look in the Ubuntu forum or Askubuntu. Heck, just look into any Linux distro that has nicely tried to have the boot part inside the Windows file system.\n\n*The boot part does not play nicely when left inside Windows, specially when some \"upgrades\" in Windows (Windows 7 and 8) appear that magically happen to damage the boot part for Linux. Remember, this is not using GRUB as we know it but the Windows boot menu.\n\n*Having the boot loader (GRUB when outside the Windows file system) outside the Windows file system gives you more flexibility over problems like Viruses in Windows, file system corruption in Windows, making backup of files, etc.. since you have Ubuntu as a backup OS. \n\n*When you encounter a problem with GRUB, you can in most cases fix it quickly and easily, either with a LiveCD or some basic commands. When you have it inside Windows, it's a bit trickier (Not easy).\n\n*If you have the boot loader outside the Windows environment, it is much easier to accomplish an easy task such as formatting Windows because of viruses and not worry about the boot part for it. Ubuntu will take care of that. If not, in many cases a simple execution of sudo update-grub will help.\nRecommendation\nRight now you can download a LiveCD/LiveDVD/LiveUSB of Ubuntu and install/reinstall Ubuntu from it. This will make sure the boot part is outside the Windows environment.\nAfter testing to see you get the GRUB menu telling you which system to use (Either Ubuntu or Windows) before going to the Windows environment, then you are ready to simply format the Windows part and install it again.\nThis however will imply that you will need to redo the boot part since Windows is not kind when other Operating systems are in the same PC. What I would recommend then would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall you Windows, do not worry about Ubuntu.\n\n*With a Live copy of Ubuntu, reinstall Ubuntu using the LiveCD. Do not boot from inside Windows, boot the Live copy from the CDROM, DVDROM or USB. This way you make sure the boot part (GRUB) is outside the Windows system and you avoid many problems caused by our friendly Windows environment.\n", "Q: How to get SNES SmartJoy working on 12.04? I have an SNES SmartJoy adapter so I can use a SNES controller with emulators but I can't get it working under Ubuntu. Is there a controller configuration utility I need to use?\nI'm trying to get it working using the VisualBoy Advance emulator from the standard Ubuntu repository but I'm not having any luck getting a response from that program's controller setup menu.\n\nA: Well the Smartjoy adapter is known to work with zsnes so my first bet would be to install zsnes. Open your Software Center and:\n\nInstall zsnes and test your Smartjoy with it. The links also provide a bug that happened several years ago, but in the case you get it you can simply remove zsnes and install it again or install the joystick app:\n\nwhich should help you calibrate the joystick.\n", "Q: Proprietary Drivers: Does Ubuntu know truly what my system has? I was just wondering if Ubuntu actually knows the Proprietary drivers of my laptop.  Using a DELL Inspiron 15r 6gb ram i5 intel core processor.  If I pick the drivers that it recommends are they actually the right ones?\nIt's not a serious problem but just was wondering if Ubuntu actually knows this or it just gives you a whatever driver for Intel, and also is this driver actually designed for this chipset?  All Answers welcome, well only nice ones.:)\n\nA: My understanding is that NVidia and ATI both have a single unified proprietary driver each, named nvidia and fglrx respectively. Those drivers are closed proprietary binary blobs over which Linux developers have no control.\nThere are also open source replacements of those drivers, named nouveau and radeon.\nIntel, being in this case more open-source friendly, opened their driver, so there's just one open source driver, named intel, \nAll of those drivers support all available graphic chipsets from the given manufacturer (maybe except ancient ones). When a new chipset appears, the support is added to the driver; also the support for very old chipsets is sometimes dropped, which means that if you have an older machine sometimes you want to install an older version of the driver. Apart from that, there are no drivers specifically designed for a particular chipset.\nOn the other hand, if you don't have, say, an Nvidia card in your system you won't see nvidia driver in the Additional Drivers. So yes, Ubuntu only shows drivers which are designed for your hardware, but no, those drivers are not for designed for one particular chipset only.\nOpen-source drivers are installed in Ubuntu by default. If Ubuntu detects that there are proprietary drivers available for your hardware, it lists them in the Additional Drivers dialog. You're actually not required to install those drivers, if you don't you will continue to use the open source drivers. \n\nA: No. There is a possibility that the Recommended one might not work correctly. I am really sorry to actually admit this since it is the recommended. This is because it actually works for more people than for the ones that it fails with.\nThe cases I have tested are for example the Nvidia drivers and Broadcom wireless drivers but is not limited to this. Point to mention is that they are called \"Proprietary\" for a reason which increases the chance of this mistakes or problems of detecting and recommending the actual one. Although the percent is small, is not a 100% sure thing.\nNow, for an intel driver, there is a huge chance that it will install the correct driver, but I actually do not know of any proprietary driver from Intel (in you case, the WiMax might be but Intel has been for a long time open to the open source world with everything). At least one that I am aware of. All intel drivers are open sourced, work out of the box as far as I am concern and will install automatically.\nIf you want to know if some driver or hardware part is not working or needs the proprietary driver, simply open Dash and type Software Sources and click on the Software Sources app. Then click on Additional Drivers tab. If there is any proprietary driver needed to install it will appear there.\nBut like I said before, for Intel, you most likely do not need to worry about anything. For Broadcom, Ati or Nvidia... well.. that's another matter.\nJust in case you really want to know what Ubuntu detected, you can run in terminal commands like lshw to list all hardware on your computer, or lspci and lsusb to see all devices like Video, Network, Webcam and sound on your PC.\n", "Q: Where does software go after it is downloaded? I tried downloading ClamAV and it could not be found. Also I'm clueless on how to install stuff using the terminal. I'm sick of windows and want to learn how this works.\n\nA: Clamav is a terminal based application, so your best bet is to open a terminal and type man clamav. Doing that will tell you if it has been installed, since you won't have the manual page for it if it hasn't. Then you can read the information to learn how to use it.\nNote that clamav is only effective against Windows viruses. These by their nature cannot work on Linux and antivirus on Linux is therefore really just to avoid you passing viruses on to Windows users e.g. through Word documents.\nLinux is not immune to malware, although a well organised and maintained Linux system is extremely well protected compared with Windows.\nIf you are security conscious, consider installing chkrootkit and rkhunter, as well as a script blocker in your browser to block javascript when you surf the web e.g. No-Script. If you have open ports (e.g. if you use SSH), you would also do well to set-up a firewall e.g. gufw.\n", "Q: Is there a way to stop KDE from overwriting my other WM settings? What is the problem?\n\n*\n\n*KDE does not respect other window manager/DE settings.\nIs there a way to safely run KDE alongside other window managers without having to reconfigure them every time after finishing my testing with KDE?\nBackground\nMy user's main desktops are primarily xfce (4.6, 4.8, 4.10) and Unity.\n\n*\n\n*I frequently test multiple Window Managers(fluxbox, enlightenment, unity, gnome, etc). Only KDE causes me problems when returning to another WM once I am done testing some KDE functionality.\n\nWhat I have done to fix this?\nWhen returning to a WM other than KDE, I find that I have to delete config(specifically *gtk files) files in order to return my other WM's to their default settings.\nWhat answer am I looking for?\n\n*\n\n*Are there any file permissions that I can set to prevent KDE from breaking my other WM settings?\n\n*Is there a way to determine what files in my home directory that KDE touches and modifies? That might help my narrow down my issue.\n\n*I am amenable to building a login script to correct anything that KDE has broken. For three users, this would be acceptable. This doesn't scale to 50 users.\n\nWhat can I do to safely test KDE and return to my default window manager without having to continually restore my configuration?\nWhy is this important?\nHere is a use-case that is causing me problems:\nI have a user(think C-level exec) that likes to change back and forth between KDE and xfce(among other WMs). How can I configure their profile so they do not get KDE window decorations when they decide to move back to xfce?\nAs it stands, I have been unable to prevent an xfce session from being totally mangled after a user logged into a KDE session.\n\nA: Here is a solution that I have found mitigate display/window decoration issues when switching between KDE and Xfce.\nHow do I find which files KDE has modified?\nFinding the files that have changed in a home directory, within a specified time period, is fairly straightforward.\nfind ~ -maxdepth 5 -mmin 10 (searches for changes within the last 10 minutes)\nHowever, the results are cluttered with a large number of dynamic files(various app caches, for example). So, I needed to exclude those from my results:\nfind ~/ -maxdepth 5 \\( -path ~/.cache -o -path ~/.xchat2 -o -path ~/.local -o -path ~/Downloads -o -path ~/.config/deluge -o -path ~/.config/chromium -o -path ~/docs -o -path ~/.dropbox -o -path ~/Dropbox -o -path ~/.pulse -o -path ~/.dbus \\) -prune -o -mmin -5\nThis results in a much more manageable list to identify the files KDE has modified(I don't doubt that there is a more elegant solution to get the same results). \nWhat files need to be changed and what commands should be run?\nPrior to exiting KDE, enter a terminal(Ctrl-Alt-t), and enter the following command:\nrm ~/.gtkrc-2.0\nThis will remove KDE window decoration settings and its deletion will result in those settings not being applied to Xfce. However, once logged into Xfce, the WM will need to be reset with the following command:\nxfwm4 --replace\nAdditionally, if any theme or font changes have been made while working in KDE, another file will need to be deleted prior to logging into Xfce. Otherwise, fonts in the web browser will have been modified.\nAgain, from the command line:\nrm ~/.fonts.conf\nHow can I (partially) automate this?\nI have automated part of this by editing /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and placing the following lines in the file:\n    [SeatDefaults]\n    session-cleanup-script = home/<userdir>/clean_up_after_kde.sh \n\nThe script contains the two rm commands from above. The xfwm --replace cannot run until the desktop environment has already started, so this is still run manually.\nIn order for the changes to take effect, lightdm needs to be restarted. Run the following:\nsudo restart lightdm. \nYour session will immediately restart after this command and drop you back to a login screen, so ensure that you have saved any work before restarting.\nThese commands will be run as part of the logout process now. Note that this script runs only after the user is completely logged out.\nWhile this is still pretty kludgey, it is a smaller step to making it less so. \n\nA: Setting a separate /home partition could be the way to go. Basically you have 2 /home partitions (or folders, one dummy) and use the dummy for KDE.\n", "Q: Uninstall program by terminal How can I uninstall any program using terminal.\n For example, how can I uninstall TeamViewer 7 wich is stored in my home folder. I can not see TeamViewer in ubuntu softvare center, so I can not uninstall it that way.\n\nA: Simple googling might have helped, anyway here is how you can uninstall any package from terminal:\napt-get --purge remove <package>\n\nYou should never remove files by hand use dpkg --purge <package> if you have already removed it with apt plus the files by hand and it thinks it is still configured this should get rid of it.\nSource of info and more on this you can find here:\nlinuxquestions\n", "Q: Assign more than 1 CPU/core to a process I lost the password to open a PDF file I need to access, so I installed pdfcrack with the hope to recover my password.

Is there a way to assign to pdfcrack more than one core to use? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04LTS 32-bit.\n\nA: Unless specifically designed to do so, software cannot generally use more than one CPU core, and cannot in general have extra added.\n(Writing software to run on multiple cores concurrently is significantly more complicated, as you cannot guarantee the order in which tasks will finish, so you have to guard against all manner of problems caused by multiple CPUs trying to access resources concurrently, or events occurring in a different order to that you expected).\nThat said, PDF cracking is a task that should be parallelisable. It appears you can find a modified version with multi-core support, but it looks like you'll have to compile it from source.\n\nA: Check out\nhttps://github.com/shreepads/pdfcrack-mp\nThis is a fork of pdfcrack with multi-core pattern support.\nAll changes are in the baseopnmp branch.\n", "Q: iwconfig indicates \"no wireless extensions\" for a working wifi card I was trying to set-up a virtual wifi access point.

Or are you trying to connect to one?  Either way it looks like you are missing the ESSID.  If you're trying to set up a VPN that's beyond the scope of my experience but there are various packages that will do that for you...not sure about anything that is open source however.  Check the forums as that's probably a question that has been answered.\nIf you are trying to connect I believe the problem is you haven't input the SSID.  I'm not aware you can connect to a VPN without doing so...it wouldn't be very private otherwise.\nSee here for setting up SSID etc.:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1062276\n\nA: The lspci output shows that you have one RealTek Gigabit network card and one Broadcom Wifi card.\nYour iwconfig output shows that besides the loopback interface you have two network interfaces : eth0 which is not a wireless card so I suppose it is the Realtek one and eth1 which is a wireless card, not connected to a Wifi AP when you ran iwconfig.\nSo your wireless card is called eth1.\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 windows 8 UEFI dual boot A friend has a new laptop with windows 8 pre-installed and he'd like to install Ubuntu like a second operating system.\nI recommend him to use the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS because he is a new ubuntu user and LTS distributions in my opinion are more stables than the normal distributions.\nWell, my question is if it's possible to install dual boot windows 8 with UEFI and ubuntu 12.04.

Actually, I'm talking about icons for Nautilus Scripts, and I have many of them. Although I prefer menus without icons, I cannot prevent icons from being displayed in Nautilus context menu items Open With and Scripts.\nParticularly, having the same script icon displayed for all of them does not look good at all.\nSo, if I cannot prevent them, at least I'd like them use icons better related with the function of each script.\nIt's easy to assign a custom icon for a single file through File Properties but I have a total of 82 Nautilus Scripts at the moment!\nWhen you enter gvfs-info /path/to/file command in terminal, you can see a line like this: metadata::custom-icon: file:///usr/share/icons/NITRUX-Buttons/apps/scalable/accessories-text-editor.svg\nI wonder if it is possible at all to edit this line (where ever it is) in a batch / from command line? \n\nA: I couldn't see it in the list shown as I was writing this question, but later I saw a similar question and the answer I was looking for in the list of Related questions on the right:\nHow can I programmatically change a file's icon?\nIt seems basically the command for this is:\ngvfs-set-attribute -t string /path/to/your/file metadata::custom-icon file:///path/to/your/icon.png\nNotes:\n1. This doesn't seem to work for Nautilus Scripts in Ubuntu versions before 12.10.\n2.

When I installed 12.10 I immediately removed Rhythmbox and installed Audacious. Is this the reason why this is happening? \nOr does it work only for music from the Ubuntu Music Store?\n\nA: There is a scope for the music lens for Audacious available in the Scopes Packagers PPA.

I have opted for menus without icons system-wide for reasons of simplicity and speed.\nBut I still get icons in Nautilus context menus. I don't mind the icons on Open With menu items too much, but all those identical icons on Nautilus Scripts (especially when you have  many scripts) look ugly.\nI wonder if there's a way of disabling these icons at all?\n\nA: As an interim solution, i.e. to avoid identical script icons (in the absence of a way of disabling display of icons) different and more relevant icons can be set for Nautilus Scripts using this command pattern:\ngvfs-set-attribute -t string \"<Your-Nautilus-Script-File-Path>\" metadata::custom-icon file:///usr/share/icons/<Your-Coice-of-Individual-Icon>\n\nNote: Another trick to get rid of those icons can be assigning non-existent icons, upon which no icon is displayed in the Scripts menu! \n", "Q: Cannot overwrite file /home/baadshah/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/toolchains.xml: Permission denied Cannot overwrite file /home/baadshah/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/qtversion.xml: \nPermission denied\nCannot overwrite file /home/baadshah/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/toolchains.xml: \nPermission denied\nCannot overwrite file /home/baadshah/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/devices.xml:\nPermission denied\nCannot overwrite file /home/baadshah/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/toolchains.xml: \nPermission denied\n\nI am getting these 4 errors when opening Qt and uinable to find application when opening a new files\n\nA: Qt installer adds the configuration directories with root as the owner. \nYou need to own the files and directories to a file to be able to write into a file.

Of course I will be backing-up all my files in DropBox. But is there a way that I wont need to do that. \n\nA: It depends on what you do during the partitioning part of the installation.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can install Ubuntu along side Windows (dual boot) on unallocated space on your sytsem (you might need to create that space with something like Partition Magic). If done correctly this will result in the Windows files staying on your system where you can switch between Windows and Ubuntu.   \n\n*You can erase all other operating systems and have Ubuntu as the only OS. This will destroy all software on the partitions you choose to use for Ubuntu. Let's say you have a D: disc that is a separate partition. If you do not format this you will end up with a disc inside Ubuntu that you can mount and access those files. Depending on what they are (.doc(x)/.txt) there will be programs they can open and save those (libreoffice, gedit). \nJust make a backup, like you intend to, and all should be fine.

Y\n(Reading database ... 89500 files and directories currently installed.)\nRemoving pure-ftpd-mysql ...\n\nI then have to tell the system to reboot and then run:\ndpkg --configure -a\n\nHas anyone got any ideas how I can completely remove this package so I can re-install it. \nEven if I try an install -f it gives the same results.\n\nA: I have solved my own issue. Though i would not recommend this, After all the un-install processes failed, i eventually gave in and manually located all the remaning files that had anything to do with pure-ftpd and removed them all manually, this then allowed the removal to complete.\nUsing Webmin file manager I did a search for everything that matched pure-ftpd, pure-ftpd-mysql and pure- and deleted them all. There were about 66 files still remaining.\nI have since managed to successfully re install pure-ftpd\n", "Q: Change default shell for Terminator I want to change the default shell of Terminator to zsh.\nIn /etc/passwd/ I've changed the default shell to /bin/zsh.\nThis settings changes the default shell in LXTerminal (the default terminal on Lubuntu), but not in Terminator. So I tried chsh -s /bin/zsh, but that doesn't work either.\nThe Terminator documentation says:\n\nHow do I change my default shell?\nTerminator will always start the shell specified by the SHELL\nenvironment variable. (It will fall back to /bin/sh if the SHELL\nenvironment variable isn't set.) You could simply influence\nTerminator's environment, but the best solution is to tell your\noperating system which shell you'd like, and it will ensure that SHELL\nis set correctly for all applications, not just Terminator. See the\ndocumentation for your operating system for details on how to change\nyour default shell.\n\nSo I expected my attempts to work, but they don't. How can I change the default shell in Terminator.\n\nA: After a reboot Terminater used zsh. I filled in a bug report.\n\nA: Ancient question, but after fighting with this for a bit:\ntl;dr: Terminator reads off of the $SHELL environment variable. If you're in a graphical X sesson, this variable was set when you logged in, and won't get reset until you log in again, even after you run the chsh.\nIf you were to switch to a text terminal and log in there, you'd see that your chsh already took effect. Once you exit and log back in, $SHELL gets reset to whatever your shell is in /etc/passwd.\n\nA: Use `chsh` to change shell\nYou can use chsh to change your default shell. Running this command will ask for complete path of the shell.\nYou can also run \n\nchsh -s <path_to_shell>\n\nto change the shell directly.\nChange Terminator Preferences\nYou can also change the Terminator preferences directly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminator.\n\n*Right Click on Terminator and select Preferences.\n\n*Go to Profiles > Command.\n\n*Check Run command as login shell, Run a custom command instead of my shell, and type in the address of the shell.\n\n\n\n - Close the dialog box.\n", "Q: After rebooting Ubuntu from USB, settings not saved After I started Ubuntu 12.04 from USB Stick I changed some Settings (display resolution, two monitors, etc) and made some updates.\nWhen I restart my system all new settings are deleted and I get a completly blank system. Is it possible to save all the settings to USB or is it necessary to install ubuntu to HDD?\n\nA: Did you create the startup USB disk using Ubuntu's Startup Disk Creator?\nThere's an option there (near the bottom) to store user documents and settings on the USB disk:\n\n", "Q: Is there a messenger that can appear offline to some contacts and online to other contacts? I am looking for a messenger which lets me choose who I want to appear online to and who I want to appear offline to (like Windows Live Messenger in Windows).\nIs there any thing that could do the job in Linux?\n\nA: This would depend on the particular service you are connecting to, since Linux clients have no control over what a sever does once it's told it you're online. Some (Facebook chat for example), simply don't provide the option to selectively appear as online or offline - and there's nothing that any client (whether running on Linux or Windows) can do about it.\nIf you're saying that there's a specific feature of the Windows Live service which allows this, then I don't know which (if any) Linux clients support it. But if it's not available in either Pidgin or Empathy (which I don't believe it is) then I strongly doubt it will be available in any others.\n", "Q: Manually turn off monitor Can I turn off my laptop monitor manually and instantly with just a click or a simple terminal command?\nI just want to turn off my monitor not locking my machine.\nThere is no dedicated turn off monitor button on my machine.\n\nA: Just to add more options... You can run\nxrandr --output <DISPLAY_NAME> --brightness 0\n\nTo determine your display name, simply runxrandr. It will provide you with information on connected displays, so you can actually turn on and off any of them\nBeware though, after running this command, you won't be able to turn your screen on by moving your mouse or using a keyboard. You will have to either use second monitor or blindly type \nxrandr --output <DISPLAY_NAME> --brightness 1\n\nSo, X RandR provides you with better control over your screens, but it does what it does. It can also be used for other things, like changing resolution, orientation, rate, etc. It is also very easy to run it inside scripts. If you want, you can write a script to make your screen nicely fade to black. Brightness parameter can take fractions\nMore on X RandR\nExample of X RandR script, bind to Fn keys\n\nA: You can by using the preferences command for X server (http://systembash.com/content/how-to-turn-off-your-monitor-via-command-line-in-ubuntu/)\n\n\n*\n\n*To turn off the monitor $ xset dpms force off\n\n*To turn on the monitor $ xset dpms force on\nPressing a key or moving the mouse will also switch the monitor on if it has been turned off. You can assign the command to a key if you like using shortcuts.\n\nA: To add on to the other answer, I found that when I entered xset dpms force off and pressed the Enter key, my screen would turn off and turn on again.\nBy running the command below, I was able to get the screen to turn off without turning on.\nsleep 3; xset dpms force off\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.04, dpms not working properly with GNOME Wayland    \n$ xset -q\n\nDPMS (Energy Star):\nDisplay is not capable of DPMS\n\nYou can try the command below,\nto turn off monitor:\nbusctl --user set-property org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig /org/gnome/Mutter/DisplayConfig org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig PowerSaveMode i 1\n\nTo turn on monitor:\nbusctl --user set-property org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig /org/gnome/Mutter/DisplayConfig org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig PowerSaveMode i 0\n\nIt works for me.  \n(Source)\n\nA: I found the xset dpms force off command works well. However, when assigning a hot key to this command, I ran into trouble: my screen would turn off and back on again.\nI found the reason for this was the hot key combo I was using for no particular reason. I discovered the hot key combo \"Mod2+Mod4+Super+Hyper+Left shift\" assigned to the xset dpms force off command turns the screen off and the screen will not turn on again until a key is pressed or the mouse is used. Exactly what I wanted! That hot key combo is simply the Super (Windows key) used in conjunction with the left shift key. I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 and this is working on my systems.\n\nA: To add to the accepted answer:\nIf you want to do this remotely over an SSH session, you’ll need to specify the DISPLAY number, e.g.,\nDISPLAY=:1 xset dpms force off\n\nIf you want to do it for the login screen,\nsudo -u gdm env XAUTHORITY=/run/user/$(id -u gdm)/gdm/Xauthority DISPLAY=:0 xset dpms force off\n\nWithout the XAUTHORITY bit you’ll get the mysterious error\nNo protocol specified\nxset:  unable to open display \":0\"\n\n\nHow did I find that?\nIn general, if some program is using the display, you can figure out how it’s talking to the display server by looking at its environment variables:\n$ ps aux | grep gd[m]\n…\ngdm         1643  0.1  0.2 3784328 164396 tty1   Sl+  08:59   0:01 /usr/bin/gnome-shell\n…\n$ sudo cat /proc/1643/environ | tr '\\0' '\\n'\n…\nDISPLAY=:0\n…\nXAUTHORITY=/run/user/126/gdm/Xauthority\n…\n\nI happened to recognize these specific environment variables as critical, but in a pinch you could use binary search to narrow down the relevant ones. Try running xset with all the environment variables copied over, and if that works, comment out half of them to see if it still works without, and so on.\n", "Q: Setting Plex media server on Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop?

I just got an idea to create a lense that would work as a Character Map. I need character copying very often, and on Windows there was a very useful programme (PopChar), but on Ubuntu I haven't found anything like it. So I thought I could try to build a lense that could copy a single character (or perhaps a sequence of characters, if possible?) by just searching for it in the Dash and clicking on it once found. Since I've never done anything similar, I'm not sure how possible it is to copy certain content by clicking on its visual link in the Dash.\nSo, my question is, if I create a Lense + Scope for copying Unicode characters, would it be possible through Dash to just copy a character that I click on once I find it?\n\nA: The scope's activate_uri method could be used to copy text to the system clipboard with the following:\nclipboard = Gtk.Clipboard.get(Gdk.SELECTION_CLIPBOARD)\nclipboard.set_text('text', -1)\nclipboard.store()\n\n", "Q: Gnome-terminal- how do i open a new winodow asking to authentificate as root?

As far as I am aware (I've been teaching in China for 10 years) QQ for linux was never properly developed in the first place and there certainly hasn't been any further development.\nYes, you can use longene/wine but to be perfectly honest, it's 'iffy' and buggy.  Bear in mind that whilst the front page of QQ will be in English -or the language of your choice - the remainder will be in Chinese .. the 'search for friends .. add contact..'  and the inbuilt translator is absent.\nThe best advice I can offer is to make your system dual-boot.  Install Windows then download QQ (www.imqq.com)  shove a Ubuntu cd into the drive and restart the computer.  Install Ubuntu alongside Windows.\nIf you want to use QQ boot into the Windows operating system.

Obviously this makes it pretty hard reading the file names that are open. Changing the color in the gedit-settings only changes the font and background color of the document. Changing the general settings for windows' appearance hasn't helped either.\nAny suggestions are welcome! Preferably none that take long to implement as I'm just familiarizing myself with Xubuntu.\nThank you!\n\nA: Despite \"Preferably none that take long to implement as I'm just familiarizing myself with Xubuntu.\", here's a longish multi-step procedure. The procedure assumes you know which theme you're currently using and, for the purpose at hand, let's assume its name is DefaultTheme.\nThe default location for themes is /usr/share/themes. This folder and its contents are not owned by you. So, if you make changes here, they will be lost in case of an update. A preferable way to play with themes is to install them in your home directory if you're getting them from elsewhere or copy them over from /usr/share/themes if they already exist there. To copy them over, here's what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal by pressing\nCtrl+Alt+T. You should normally be placed in your home directory. Otherwise, type cd and press Enter to get there.\n\n*Type mkdir .themes and press Enter. The . signifies a hidden file and is required.\n\n*Type cp /usr/share/themes/DefaultTheme ~/.themes and press\nEnter.\nType ls ~/.themes and press\nEnter to confirm that you've copied over the entire DefaultTheme folder to ~/.themes. Here, ~ is a shortcut that Ubuntu understands for /home/YourName.\n\n*Close the terminal.\n\n\nAt this point you should look at the contents of ~/.themes/DefaultTheme in your file manager, Thunar, the default, or Nautilus or whatever. Most themes provided by default are quite complete and should contain, among others, folders called gtk-2.0 and gtk-3.0. (gtk-3.0 is newer and shinier but gtk-2.0 lives on.)\nNow, gedit is a gtk-3.0 app. To change the appearance of its tabs, we need to edit a file called gtk-widgets.css located in ~/.themes/DefaultTheme/gtk-3.0. In other words, we want to edit ~/.themes/DefaultTheme/gtk-3.0/gtk-widgets.css.\nTo do so, open this file with your preferred text editor.\nLook for a section named somewhat like .notebook tab because there maybe differences from theme to theme. If you find such a section, look within it for something like:  \nbackground-image: -gtk-gradient (linear, left top, left bottom,\n                                 from (shade (@bg_color, 0.97)),\n                                 color-stop (0.80, shade (@bg_color, 0.95)),\n                                 to (shade (@bg_color, 0.92)));\n\nIf you find this content and you understand how gradients work you could edit the above to suit your needs.\nA simpler, probably less aesthetic way is to just replace the entire content with the following code:\nbackground-color: #bbb\n\nSave the file and close gedit. Log out of your session. Log back in and open gedit and see if you have decent contrast now: you should now have dark gray text on a light grey background. If you want the background even lighter, try #ccc or #ddd or even #fff (for pure white).\nNotes:\nI've provided a similar answer here: gnome-terminal tabs are very dark, difficult to tell which tab is in use.\nI'm providing this answer based on my past usage. I no longer use Xfce or gedit. If you find this answer doesn't work for you, let me know and I'll ask for it to be deleted.\n", "Q: Installation of 12.10 stops at 'Configuring hardware' My problem is very similar to the one described here.\nI'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 64bits from a LiveUSB drive.

I also checked the USB for errors and no error were detected.\n(NB: I am trying to install this as a dual boot with Windows 8, install in EFI)\nI had problems with the display, so from Grub I used the options 'nomodeset' and 'xforcevesa' which brings me to the install GUI.\nI start the install and set up all the relevant partitions and the install starts correctly and then stops at this step:\n\nubuntu ubiquity: update-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-3.5.0-17-generic\n\nHere are the specs of my machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Acer Revo L80\n\n*CPU: Intel Core i3-2377M @ 1.50 Ghz\n\n*Ram: 8Gb\n\n*Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 3000\n\n\nI strongly suspect the problem comes from the integrated graphics card not being recognised, but not sure what to do about it...\nThanks in advance for any suggestion or fix!\n\nA: Had to make a bit of research about this issue, as expected it is a hardware issue. The machine I was trying to install on is an Acer Revo L80, installing Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10 on it is simply not possible, not sure why...\nThe temporary solution was to install Ubuntu 11.10 instead, not ideal but it works.\n", "Q: How to add buttons in Glade and resize Trying to create the framework for a calculator.\nI add the window\nI add the vbox using 2 boxes.  1 for the display, the other for the buttons\nWhen I add 1 button it fills the entire panel and I can't resize it.\nIn visual basic you can just add a button and resize it, or drag and drop anywhere you want.\nI just can't figure out how to do it here.  Steep learning curve for me.\n\nA: GTK+ uses box-based sizing, just like CSS and other modern tools. Also, a VBox will have all its children oriented vertically. You won't be able to add anything to the right.\nYou can use the GtkLayout for absolute positioning, or a GtkGrid to create a grid-based layout (which is appropriate for calculator).\n\nA: You have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the lower vbox pane, add a 'Grid' container. Your buttons will have all the same size and scale automatically with the window.

I am really new to Ubuntu/Linux, and I am trying to make a bootable USB drive so I can freely change between OSs on my laptop until I am more comfortable with Ubuntu. I went to he Ubuntu website and followed the instruction for making a bootable USB device. So at this point I have Ubuntu installed on my USB but I do not know how to actually boot my computer to the OS. \n\nA: Some older models don't support USB boot at all. This might be the case for your laptop, if it's old. You can check by entering the BIOS Setup (not the BIOS boot menu), and looking at the boot order. If there's nothing there for USB or \"external drive\" (or similar), it probably does not support booting from USB devices.\n\nA: When you turn on or reboot your computer, you should see a splash screen with your manufacturer logo. Search for the key that says \"Boot device options\" or such.\nFor example, press F9 for HP laptops, or Esc for Asus computers. Then select your USB drive and you will be able to boot into Ubuntu.\n\nA: A common issue that I have faced (when installing Ubuntu on Portable Hard drives) is that the hard drive does not get detected when the system is booting up. This is possibly because of the lag in reading the physical drive extension and can be rectified by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del before the windows boot screen comes. This will trigger another restart to the system and end up identifying the hard drive boot loader faster.\nIn this case, simply changing the boot priority sequence by going to the BIOS (have a look at the first screen of the computer startup, even before the windows screen - there would be an options list for eg:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Del for setup or \n\n*F9 for setup etc.)\n\n", "Q: error installing xampp 1.8.1 in ubuntu 12.10 sudo apt-get install xampp\n after above step the following error is shown\nReading package lists...

I think I just don't understand how to use this program.\nhere is what efibootmgr tells me about my boot sequence:\nBootCurrent: 0001\nTimeout: 0 seconds\nBootOrder: 0001,0000\nBoot0000* ubuntu\nBoot0001* ubuntu\n\nDoes anybody know how I can add my diskdrive to the sequence?\nefibootmgr is giving me the following options:\nefibootmgr version 0.5.4\nusage: efibootmgr [options]\n-a | --active         sets bootnum active\n-A | --inactive       sets bootnum inactive\n-b | --bootnum XXXX   modify BootXXXX (hex)\n-B | --delete-bootnum delete bootnum (hex)\n-c | --create         create new variable bootnum and add to bootorder\n-d | --disk disk       (defaults to /dev/sda) containing loader\n-e | --edd [1|3|-1]   force EDD 1.0 or 3.0 creation variables, or guess\n-E | --device num      EDD 1.0 device number (defaults to 0x80)\n-g | --gpt            force disk with invalid PMBR to be treated as GPT\n-H | --acpi_hid XXXX  set the ACPI HID (used with -i)\n-i | --iface name     create a netboot entry for the named interface\n-l | --loader name     (defaults to \\elilo.efi)\n-L | --label label     Boot manager display label (defaults to \"Linux\")\n-n | --bootnext XXXX   set BootNext to XXXX (hex)\n-N | --delete-bootnext delete BootNext\n-o | --bootorder XXXX,YYYY,ZZZZ,...     explicitly set BootOrder (hex)\n-O | --delete-bootorder delete BootOrder\n-p | --part part        (defaults to 1) containing loader\n-q | --quiet            be quiet\n   | --test filename    don't write to NVRAM, write to filename.\n-t | --timeout seconds  set boot manager timeout waiting for user input.\n-T | --delete-timeout   delete Timeout.\n-u | --unicode | --UCS-2  pass extra args as UCS-2 (default is ASCII)\n-U | --acpi_uid XXXX    set the ACPI UID (used with -i)\n-v | --verbose          print additional information\n-V | --version          return version and exit\n-w | --write-signature  write unique sig to MBR if needed\n-@ | --append-binary-args file  append extra args from file (use \"-\" for stdin)\n\nSo with '--create' I can create a new boot number.

Or how I can ad the blueray disk drive?\n\nA: I don't think efibootmgr is really suited to this task.\nIn most cases, you can do what you want via the firmware's own user interface. Sometimes just selecting the built-in boot manager (typically by pressing a function key during the boot process, but which one varies from model to model) will cause it to re-detect your optical drive. In other cases, you may need to enter the setup utility (by pressing another function key or the Del key) and locate an option to set the boot order. Unfortunately, the user interfaces for all of this are highly variable, so I can't be more specific. Consulting your computer's or motherboard's manual might provide you with clues, but unfortunately, these manuals are getting vaguer and vaguer as time goes on.\n\nA: Try unplugging/replugging your drive. Also Upgrading/Downgrading BIOS may help. I got mine fixed by plugging drive into another SATA port.\n\nA: When you first power up your computer, try pressing F2 to enter setup.  if you set your disk drive higher in the boot order, it will boot off of a disk before it looks for an efi file on your hard drive. F12 or F10 may bring up a menu which may include an option to either boot from a disk or enter setup to configure options such as preferred boot order.  which exact button varies by manufacturer, but F2 is commonly used, Del or delete are also common options for entering setup.\n", "Q: Start nagios web interface on a different port I am trying to install nagios but I would like to start the web interface on a port other than 80.

I have an apt-get install process that seems to be hopelessly wedged at the processing triggers for python-support step.\nMy inclination is to kill it, but in the past, simply kill-ing an apt-get install process has caused me much grief.  (IIRC assorted lock files are left behind, etc.)\nIs there a safer way to stop this process?\n\nA: Killing processes\nGenerally speaking for killing a process, there's no safer way to kill a process than with a regular kill (SIGTERM). In case it's an interactive process it usually allows you to stop it even safer by sending a SIGINT signal, usually sent by pressing Ctrl + C. This signal is being trapped by the process itself can listen to it - and usually stop gracefully. (thanks Eliah)\nDPKG database\nRegarding the package management is a sort of special case. The DPKG database that the APT commands use under water can always detect whether an operation hasn't finished. Every package has an actual state which is marked in as well as a current state, e.g. unpacked, configured, etc. By killing the APT frontend, the database will be in a broken, but in known state. The lock files will only be released once it's all back in a clean state - you should get this fixed until it allows new operations.\nThe way to fix is just firing a process to get all packages in the configured state. Practically speaking, if you've interrupted an apt-get operation, you can just finish it later using\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nIt knows how to recover from the broken state to an all-configured state and in that sense just continue from where it was interrupted. The lock files are left there until you finished that, and that's for a reason - to prevent new operations with the DPKG database in an unclean state.\nAbout SIGKILL (9)\nSending a SIGKILL (decimal representation 9) is very unsafe. This signal is cannot be caught by the process, but the whole process will be cleaned up by the operating system (kernel) whether the process likes it or not. The state of the files on the file system can be left in a corrupt state. Never send these signals unless it's not listening to other more graceful signals anymore.\n\nA: sudo dpkg -r <package name>\n\nIn my case I had problems with Java 8 on Ubuntu 12.04, so...\nsudo dpkg -r oracle-java8-installer\n\n\nA: When I encounter a failure with apt-get, I do the following (as root, i.e. sudo before all commands):\n\n\n*\n\n*Kill the process named apt-get:\nkillall -9 apt-get\n\n*Reconfigure dpkg:\ndpkg --configure -a\n\n*Update apt-get:\napt-get update\n\n*Update packages, including those improperly installed:\napt-get upgrade\nThis I learned from somewhere, but unfortunately I cannot remember exactly where.\n\nA: Here is how I do it, Ctrl+C But mind you that it is safe as long as apt-get is in downloading phase or its updating the cache. Other than that I cannot think a way that is safer. Just let it finish and undo changes by uninstalling or downgrading somehow.\nThe downloaded files can be cleaned with sudo apt-get autoclean\n\nA: If Advanced Package Tool (APT) is hung, then the /var/lib/dpkg/lock and /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend lock files are probably held. You can run the following procedure—described by the Debian Wiki in the Q: What can be done when the dpkg lock is held? section.\n\n*\n\n*Kill the process holding the lock files.\nsudo fuser -vki -TERM /var/lib/dpkg/lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend\n\nThe following options are passed to the fuser command—a command to identify processes using files or sockets:\n\n*\n\n*-v, --verbose Enable verbose mode.\n\n*-k, --kill Kill processes accessing the file.  Unless changed with -SIGNAL, SIGKILL is sent. In this case, the -TERM switch indicates a SIGTERM signal is sent.\n\n*-i, --interactive Ask  the  user  for confirmation before killing a process.\n\nNote: If—despite your best efforts—the -TERM option doesn't work, then consider increasing the force of your fuser command and send a SIGKILL signal with the following command: sudo fuser -vki -KILL /var/lib/dpkg/lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend\n\n\n*Complete dpkg pending configuration steps.\nsudo dpkg --configure --pending\n\n\nA: Linux and other Unix type systems are very powerful from the command line but very unforgiving once a process has started.  Sending a process the kill signal will certainly kill the process that is running but bear in mind that you are leaving a database in an unstable state.  The last record may not be closed out correctly so you risk have to repair a database.

I've recently been finding myself writing more SQL, on Windows with MSSQL and LinqPad and while I want to experiment on Ubuntu to get more of a handle on databases and I have no love lost for MSSQL, I'll be using MySQL I do want to find a LinqPad equivalent.\nWhat I mean by this in more concrete terms is not the most powerful tool but more of a scratch-pad like LinqPad is, where a novice can quickly write down a query and run it to see what happens, also something which is fast to start and run.\n\nA: I have to disagree with the basis of Shauna's answer; LINQPad is not a MS-SQL gui or frontend.  It is a .NET scratchpad which can generate a LinqToSql context for supported data contexts.  This makes it fundamentally different from typical SQL clients (such as SQL Server Management Studio or MySql Workbench).\nOut of the box LINQPad ships with drivers which support MS-SQL, however additional drivers can be easily installed and can add support for other data sources--including MySql.\nFor your specific question the answer is that the closest think you'll find that can run natively on Linux would be a custom .NET application written with Mono (version 2.6 added LINQtoSql support).\nHowever, if you need to use LINQPad with MySql you easily can using the IQ driver.  You will still need Windows to run LINQPad (or, possibly wine).  I personally keep a Windows VirtualBox on my Linux development station specifically for a handful of tools such as LINQPad which are windows-only.\n\nA: LinqPad is basically a gui front end for MS-SQL Server. In that sense, you have several options, but remember that you'll need to install MySQL server (sudo apt-get install mysql-server in terminal) to use them. Additionally, you'll probably want create and populate a database to play around with. The biggest difference will be that you won't be able to use Linq syntax, because Linq is a .Net syntax (you can, however, get similar syntaxes by getting into some of the languages and frameworks, the most closely-resembling probably being Ruby or Python).\n\n\n*\n\n*MySQL's built-in terminal application. You'll have to install mysql-client (which you'll probably need if you do any PHP/Python/Ruby development, anyway), but then, you can open up a terminal and type in mysql -u[a mysql user] -p (-p if the mysql user has a password, otherwise just leave the -p off). That will bring up a mysql console, which you can then run SQL queries directly in.\n\n*MySQL Workbench This is a more full-featured database management GUI more similar to Management Tools than LinqPad, but it features a SQL query editor that allows you to run queries to your heart's content. You can find this in the repos as the mysql-workbench package.\n\n*PHPMyAdmin This is somewhere between, and is a web-based solution. You'll need to install the php5 and php5-mysql packages, and a web server (such as lighttp or apache, either of which PhpMyAdmin should give you the option to configure), then install the phpmyadmin package. Open your browser and navigate to the URL you created for it, and you can play with SQL in the \"SQL\" tab, again to your heart's content.\nI personally prefer Workbench, or just the plain terminal application for most things.\nUpdate: JetBrains has been working on a plug-in/standalone SQL client similar to MySQL Workbench. The standalone version is called 0xDBE, but you can get it as a plug-in if you already use one of JetBrains' other suites (WebStorm, PHPStorm, etc). It's about a step or two below Workbench's power in some areas (it doesn't have Workbench's reverse engineer and data modeling), but has the advantages of integrating into what may be your existing development environment and supporting multiple database systems if that's what you need. It's also cross-platform, like the rest of their IDE products. I've been using it for some time as part of the early access program and it has proven to be rock-solid and a great scratch-pad like tool (albeit a bit heavy compared to LinqPad if you use the standalone version).\nUpdate 2016: Sqlectron is a new cross-platform lightweight SQL client, built on Github's Electron system. I haven't had a chance to play with it, yet, but as I understand it, it's a lighter weight option for Mac and Linux environments than some of the former options.\n", "Q: Replaced Windows 7, but where did my old files go? Ok, let me start by saying that I know nothing about Linux and that I switched because I was sick and tired of windows.\nSo I had Windows 7 on my C: drive and I chose to replace it with Ubuntu 12.10.\nThe problem is there I was prepared to have all my data erased from C: Drive but now it seems I can find anything at all!\nThere is no partition.

I didnt get any option to select my partition or anything, the thing just rolled and mowed down on everything I had..\nFollow Lucio's comment to figure out how to do it right. And always have a backup.\n\nA: To see all your partitions (size, system, etc.) enter sudo fdisk -l in terminal.\nIf you don't see your D: and/or X: partitions there, then is not much I can do.\nIf you selected the Erase disk and install Ubuntu option, then all the OS, partitions and files there (C: & D: & X:) are gone.\nIf you selected the Something else option, then depends of what you did there. Like if installed Ubuntu in the C: partition, then maybe your D: & X: partitions could  be fine.\n\nWhat I can say is that you have to be very careful when you are preparing your HDD to install a new OS. You have to review twice all the options and actions that you take in the process. Read this article about disk space the is very useful for dual systems. And always remember to create a backup with all your important information! \n", "Q: How can I get gnome-keyring-daemon to prompt for ssh-key password in the terminal instead of the GUI When accessing an ssh-key with a password for the first time in a gnome session, it's so much clearer for the password prompt to appear in the terminal I'm running the ssh command in. Instead, though, gnome-keyring-daemon prompts with a GUI pop-up that can easily get lost on different workspaces. \nHow can I make gnome-keyring-daemon prompt me in the terminal rather than with a GUI? It should look like this:\n$ ssh name@server.com\nEnter password for ssh key `/path/to/my/key.dsa`: \n\nThis is the prompt that appears in a non-X session, for instance.\n\nA: If you don't insist on using gnome-keyring it is easy. ssh-agent is the tool you want. You can add keys to the running agent with ssh-add path/to/keyfile and list the active keys with ssh-add -l.\nAfter you have added a key to the agent you can use ssh like you are now, but the keys are provided by ssh-agent.\n", "Q: How can I avoid having to pair my bluetooth mouse all the time?

It is working properly in both OSes but I have to pair every time when I switch OS.\nIs there any way to use the bluetooth mouse without needing to pair each time?\n\nA: \nThis answer works for bluetoothd v5.35 - I assume that it will also work with earlier releases of bluetoothd v5.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pair with the device in linux\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Pair with the device in windows\n\n*Extract the link key as described by thezeroth\n\n*Turn off the BlueTooth device and reboot into linux\n\nMake sure to have your device turned off when booting linux.\nOtherwise it will try to connect to the device repeatedly with the old (and now invalid) link key.

Nevertheless, this should help:\n\nQuoted from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1479056 (with some formatting added)\n\nHi, I got it to work with mine, by copying the bluetooth link key. Here is what I did:\n\n\nFind the bluetooth address of the PC/dongle (let's say AA:11:11:11:11:11).Find the bluetooth address of the keyboard (let's say BB:22:22:22:22:22).Pair the device normally, under Linux (via the Gnome panel).\nThere should be a file called /var/lib/bluetooth/AA:11:11:11:11:11/linkkeys, which contains a line like this:\n\nBB:22:22:22:22:22 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 0 6\n\nHere, xxxx is 16 bytes written continuously in hexadecimal, that's the link key.\n\nPair the device normally, under Windows (this will change the key). Get the key from Windows. In my case, it was in this registry entry:\nSYSTEM\\ControlSet002\\services\\BTHPORT\\Parameters\\Keys\\aa1111111111\\bb2222222222\n\nUnfortunately, RegEdit says \"access is denied\" when I get to Keys, even when logged on as administrator. (I suppose it might be in another ControlSet in some cases.)\n\n\nReboot under Linux, install chntpw. The version packaged with Lucid v0.99.5 doesn't seem to support registry in 64-bit. The latest version in the Debian repo (v0.99.6-2 as of writing) worked for me.\n\nTo avoid unwanted modifications of the Windows registry from Linux, I've copied the SYSTEM file somewhere else, from: /path/to/Windows/System32/config/SYSTEM\nI've then opened it with chntpw (browse registry with ls/cd; help with ?):\nchntpw -e SYSTEM\nls\ncd ControlSet002\\services\\BTHPORT\\Parameters\\Keys\nls\ncd aa1111111111\nls\nhex bb2222222222\n\nThis produces something like this:\n:00000 xx xx xx xx xx xx xx\n\nHere, xx xx xx is another 16 bytes, in hexadecimal, represented the link key set up in Windows.\n\nFinally, I copied that (and removed the spaces) to replace the value already in /var/lib/bluetooth/AA:11:11:11:11:11/linkkeys.\n\nI had to disconnect and reconnect (via the Gnome applet), but I had to do that sometimes anyway. (It doesn't seem to work before being logged on either, but that the same, it was happening even with being paired under Linux only. That's probably a different problem.)\n\nIt worked for me. It's probably a bit complex for people who are not comfortable editing config files. I think it's safer to work on a copy of the SYSTEM registry file too, just in case something goes wrong.\n\nA: you should configure both windows and ubuntu to use the same key (password) when connecting with your mouse.\npair it with your ubuntu, then restart to windows, pair it and get the key windows using to connect to the mouse, see my answer here to learn how:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/229930/finding-bluetooth-link-key-in-windows-7-to-double-pair-a-device-on-dualboot-com\nthen reboot to ubuntu open terminal:\nsudo -i\ncd /var/lib/bluetooth/\nls\n\nnote your bluetooth adaptor MAC address\ncd [put adaptor mac address here]\nnano linkkeys\n\nchange the key in front of MAC address of your mouse to the key windows is using\npress Ctrl+X and y and Enter to save and then reboot. now your mouse should work on both OS.\n\nA: Bluetooth Mouse with Windows 10 and K/Ubuntu 17.10  Dual Boot    –  HP Z5000 Bluetooth Mouse\nThere is a long list of suggestions on this topic most are old and are complicated to follow. This is an alternative to enable the same bluetooth mouse to work on both Windows 10 and Kubuntu 17.10. It’s fairly simple. This should work in other Debian systems and perhaps for other bluetooth devices. \nFIRST STEPS:\n1/. First pair in Windows. Save a copy of the bluetooth keys to a USB stick then print it. This is helpful in determining the computer and device addresses for use in changing the Windows LinkKey. Using regedit (In the result left click to enable administrator rights) go to -  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\BTHPORT\\Parameters\\keys\\computer MAC\\device MAC. \n2/. Reboot to Linux then pair in linux. \n3/. Open Nautilus via terminal with su for full root:\n4/. Using Nautilus navigate to bluetooth via file system ROOT - var – lib - bluetooth\n5/. From Bluetooth open the 12 digit number (machine MAC address) opens up to device MAC address \n6/. Open device MAC\n7/. Opens to Info folder\n8/. Open Info – displays Linux LinkKey data - either save a copy or print screen / file or print a copy to use later in this process. It makes inputting the Linux LinkKey much easier.\nWINDOWS 10: \nSwithch off mouse before starting Windows and do not reconnect. The finger/touch pad will be the only means to proceed.\n1/. Login with normal user password\n2/. Search for regedit\n3/. In the result left click to enable administrator rights.\n4/. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\BTHPORT\\Parameters\\keys\\computer MAC\\device MAC\nThe the computer and device address will at least be similar or even identical in Linux and Windows. This can be ckecked from the printed copies (if made).\n5/. To gain access to the Keys files elevated privilages are needed (see https://www.howtogeek.com/262464/how-to-gain-full-permissions-to-edit-protected-registry-keys/).\n6/. Click on keys and then Device Mac\nThis will open up a binary value editor:\n1/. Input the 32 pair linux key that was obtained using Nautilus. \n2/. The original LinkKey will be seen as two lines of 8 paired digits. There will be three lines visible.\n3/. Place the curser at the start of the first line and input the Linux LinkKey. The curser will automnatically move to the next pair.\n4/. The input will appear in capitals, however it will be automatically be converted to lowercase on completion. Windows will convert the key characters to HEX values during this process this will be seen to the right of the new LinkKey.\n5/. When the new key input is complete, place the curser at the start of the original Key and delete the original two lines. This will leave three lines as originally. \n6/. Close the editor which will save the changes if it’s reopened the key appear in lower cass and in Windows format (separeated by commas not colons)\n7/. Collapse HKEY-L_M and exit Window registry editor.\nFINALLY:\nClose down Windows 10 and reboot to Windows again without turning on the mouse. Once fully booted turn on the mouse – it should now work in both Kubuntu 17.10 and Windows 10.\n", "Q: How to copy /sda3 to /sda1? UUID's can't be similar /dev/sda is a 400 gig drive.

I am looking for a clipboard manager, but I don't want one that just keeps a list so I can select an item to bring it to the front of the clipboard, nah, that's too easy.\nWhat I am looking for is a clipboard manager where I can assign say\nCtrl+Shift+1 to paste the first item in the clipboard,\nCtrl+Shift+2 to paste the second item in the clipboard\n...\nCtrl+Shift+9 to paste the ninth item in the clipboard\nCtrl+Shift+0 to paste the tenth item in the clipboard  \nwhy?\nAs we web developer I am often pasting alternating lines of code (remember, not all browsers support CSS3!), \n<tr class=\"odd\">...</tr>  \n<tr class=\"even\">...</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">...</tr>  \n<tr class=\"even\">...</tr>\n\nSo, the ability to just sit there doing\nCtrl+Shift+1 Enter \nCtrl+Shift+2 Enter \nWould be a huge help,\nI am using 12.10 with gnome-shell 3.6.2.\nI have looked into gPaste and such, but none seem to have this feature.\n\nA: I'm not aware of a clipboard manager that itself provides the feature you want, but there are two ways in which I imagine that Klipper could be incorporated in a solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*Klipper offers \"Next History Item\" and \"Previous History Item\" shortcuts that change the order of the clipboard history. Therefore, pasting the nth entry can be done by running the \"Next History Item\" shortcut n times, then running Ctrl+V (or whatever your paste shortcut is), and then -- to put the history back into its original order -- running the \"Previous History Item\" shortcut n times. Using this, your problem reduces to setting a shortcut that simulates entering a series of shortcuts.\n\n*The command qdbus org.kde.klipper /klipper getClipboardHistoryItem n where the n at the end is a number (e.g. 0, 1, 2...) will output the nth clipboard history item. Using this, your problem reduces to the problem of setting a keyboard shortcut that will paste the output of a command.\n\n\nA: When Keepboard is activated, the second item in the history is selected by default (because the top item is in the clipboard anyway and can be pasted directly without activating clipboard manager). Thus you can quickly paste the second item by using Keepboard activation hotkey and pressing Enter right away.\n\nA: GPaste is a clipboard management system for GNOME. GPaste manages clipboard history and allows easy access to it using keyboard shortcuts, gnome-shell extension and command-line tools.\nTo install GPaste in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install gpaste\n\n\nQlipper is a lightweight clipboard history applet. It provides the following features:\n\n*\n\n*saves clipboard history entries and restores them\n\n*lightweight\n\n*system tray docking app\n\n*few requirements\n\n*can be used in GNOME\n\nTo install Qlipper in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install qlipper\n\n\nCopyQ is an advanced clipboard manager with editing and scripting features. CopyQ monitors the system clipboard and saves its content in customized tabs. Saved clipboard entries can be later copied and pasted directly into any application.\nTo install CopyQ in Ubuntu 18.04 and later open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install copyq\n\n\nA: I've released a clipboard manager Gnome extension that supports paste on select, including numbered keyboard shortcuts to select the Nth item.\n", "Q: Auto-selected text in a browser address bar In windows when I click the address bar in Chrome or Firefox, or the search box in Firefox, all existing text is selected automatically and if I type something it is typed in a black text area.\nBut in Ubuntu, the text is not selected automatically, and I have to select all and then type.\nIs there any option that fixes this problem?\n\nA: On my system, when I press F6 the contents of the address bar in Firefox are selected, just as you wish. The same behaviour with Iron (a derivate of Google Chrome).\nTo select the text (if any) on the search bar on Firefox, then you can press F6 and then Tab.\nAbout the \"black text area\" I don't know; maybe you mean \"blank text area\", meaning that once you start typing, the (selected) text is substituted?\nIn Opera, you press F2 to open a window where you can type a new URI.\nFor searches, I have configured several search keywords in Opera's integrated search, so I simply press F2 and type, for example, d recipe, to search for the word \"recipe\" on DuckDuckGo.com or doi 10.1126/science.1100199 to go to this paper.\n\nA: Firefox\nOn the address bar write about:config and press enter.\nPress the I'll be careful warning\n\nOn the search bar look for browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll and change the value to true.\n\n\nA: For Opera Ctrl + L works or F8. And also simple double click works in Opera.\n\nA: A changable setting in Firefox governs text selection in the address bar.\nType about:config in the Firefox address bar, search for browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll and change its value to true by double clicking.\nYou may also want to use ctrl+l or alt+d to autoselect text in the address bar, and ctrl+k to do the same in the search bar.\n\nA: Triple-clicking works for me to select the entire contents of the address bar.  But I like the F6 trick better now that I've heard about it.\n", "Q: Depends: exim vs mail-transport-agent I am creating a .deb installation package for our software, which depends on a valid SMTP server being installed. Currently the control file states:\nDepends: mail-transport-agent\n\nHowever one Debian user complained that the package wouldn't install, probably because he has exim installed. Now I am a little confused. Is exim a valid MTA? If so, why doesn't it \"provide\" the virtual package mail-transport-agent?\nIf I edit my control file to state:\nDepends: exim | mail-transport-agent\n\nCan I assume a working SMTP server will be available when the exim package is installed? Or is exim not really a replacement for postfix, sendmail, etc?\n\nA: Exim is a full MTA, just like Postfix.\nThe several flavours of Exim, such as exim4-daemon-light, all have a nice\nProvides: [...] mail-transport-agent\n\nline there.\nIf your user complains it won't install, I see these obvious causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo dpkg -i package.deb will result in a failure if dependencies aren't met, just like will happen with any other package with dependencies. He has to run sudo apt-get install -f to satisfy them and complete the installation, but he might not know he has to do this.\nSolution: ask full output of his installation attempt and it will probably hint on running some fix-broken command.\n\n*He has installed Exim from source and his package management tries to install it over his local install (and he refuses to do so - for a reason).\nSolution: make it a Recommends: instead of a hard Depends:, to relax the dependency a bit. Regular installation methods do install the recommended dependencies, but can be relaxed by the user, e.g. --no-install-recommends via apt-get.\n", "Q: Windows wont boot in grub I have a dualboot with Windows xp and ubuntu.

In the top right corner of a standard KDE/Kubuntu installation you'll see this:\n\nBut seriously, I seem to be unable to understand what those \"activities\" are and what it would enable me to profit from. It just pops up like an \"add widget\" screen with just four options:\n\n\n*\n\n*New Activity - default plasma widgets desktop - is this a bug that it's called like that?\n\n*Search and Launch - sort of over-spacious netbook interface?\n\n*Photos Activity - I don't have any pictures local on my machine, useless for me.\n\n*Desktop Icons - traditional style desktop-icons-only\n\n\nChoosing one of those options seems to create a completely new desktop \"plasma\". Then why is this called Activity? Am I missing something?\nIs this is nifty feature I've been missing on for a few years now or is this not that exciting? How do I use this as it's supposed to work?\n\nGoogling for what this is supposed to be give me all kind of vague descriptions like this one:\n\nNo feature defines the KDE 4 release series more than Activities. At the same time, no feature is so little understood -- Fedora even has a package for removing the desktop toolkit, which provides mouse access to Activities.\nBut, when you take the time to learn about Activities, you'll find them a natural extension of the desktop metaphor that just might help you to work more efficiently.\nActivities are a super-set of Virtual Desktops. They don't replace Virtual Desktops -- in fact, each Activity can have its own set of Virtual Desktops if you choose. Instead, Activities are alternative desktops, each of which can have its own wallpaper, icons, and widgets.\n\nSorry, but after reading such a vague and impractical story I'm out. Can someone give me an overview of what I can do with it? I guess this is supposed to provide a way to separate private and business work, but then, how?\n\nA: This answer refers mainly to KDE4. For Plasma 5, see update at the end of answer.\n\nTerminology is relative, but I guess the term \"Activity\" is used instead of \"Desktop\" because the latter is more commonly used on the one hand when referring to desktop environments, and on the other when referring to \"virtual desktops\" or \"workspaces\", while Activities are a way of using the plasticity and mobility of KDE. \n\nWhat are Activities?\nEach Activity is a set of virtual desktops (workspaces) with specific characteristics. \nThere are different types of activities. \n(Not only you can create multiple ones and switch between them, but their characteristics can be very different, because they are of different types.)\n\nWhat can I do with an Activity?\nBefore knowing what you can do with each type of activity it is useful to know what each activity can do.\nThe different characteristic of an Activity/set-of-workspaces that is already in place can be specified by clicking the last entry of the desktop menu (right-click on desktop) inside that Activity.\n\nThere you will see different types of activities, under Layouts:\n\nIn different systems they may be more or different \n\nChanging the layout changes in fact the way an Activity operates.\nSimilar options can be set  when creating a new Activity, only they are inconsistently called 'Templates':\n\nThat also may vary \n\nThere are some inconsistencies: \n\n\n*\n\n*the template \"Photos Activity\" is absent from the list of \"layouts\". (So, you cannot set that \"layout\" to an existing activity, but you can set it as \"template\" to a newly created one)\n\n*the template \"Desktop Icons\" is absent from the list of layouts, but it seems to do be same thing as the item named \"Folder\" (present in both layouts and templates)\n\n\nSome of them seem to serve basically the same purpose (which will reduce the number of \"types\" available - see below), others seem to serve no purpose at all :) - but there are a few that are interesting enough to make this discussion worthwhile. Some of them are just empty plasma desktops with some widgets added by default but some are more fundamentally different.\nThere is also an option called \"Get new Templates\" when creating a new Activity, which should give us more types of activities, but that doesn't work in the KDE system that I tested.\n\nWhat can these types of activities do?\nI'll try to describe each type of activity (and I'll try to update this answer on the way).\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Folder\" layout/template (not different from \"Desktop Icons\") shows the content of ~./Desktop and thus allows icon files on the desktop. Sending an application to the desktop creates just an icon file for that instead of an icon widget (as is the case in the classic KDE desktop layout).\n\n*The template \"Search and launch\" which seems to be the same as the layout called \"Default Desktop\" adds a very interesting feature: just by typing you can search and launch an application or search and find a file, bookmark, etc., without the need for clicking a search button on the panel or use a shortcut to open the search window. The search window pops up just by typing.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Homerun\" creates a dashboard with main tabs that give access to the favorite items, the installed applications and the folders\n\n\n\nNot present by default in Kubuntu 14.04\nsudo apt-get install plasma-widget-homerun-kicker plasma-widget-homerun\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Group Desktop\" has the option of creating groups, which look like empty widgets... What they are for I don't know yet.\n\n*\"Grid Desktop\" does the same as the previous, only it adds a grid on which the groups can be moved - but for what purpose I cannot say.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Photo activity\" is a classic KDE desktop that starts with two widgets (Photo Frame and Folders) showing the Pictures folder. Switching to this activity by shortcut will give easy access to your photos etc\n\n*\"Newspaper layout\" is (on my system) just an empty KDE desktop . It is just a name I guess with the idea of adding some widgets focused on news.\n\nSumming up:\nThere can be many activities created at the same time, with different purposes, as the other answers explain.\nBut what I find interesting is to show the main types of activities that can be used and how they are different.\nFirst, there are the widget-based activities: the classical KDE desktop layout (the one with icon-widgets, created by selecting \"Empty desktop\" for a new Activity)  that can be by itself o good base for creating new specialized activities, by using specific widgets (\"Photo activity\" is an example).\nThen, there are the three activities that have a different structure than the classical KDE layout+widgets. They all allow widgets too but add something more:\n\n\n*\n\n*access to the Desktop folder (\"Folder\"/\"Desktop icons\")\n\n*\"type-and-launch\" feature (\"Search and launch\"/\"Default Desktop\")\n\n*dashboard (\"Homerun\") \n\n\n\nUPDATE on Plasma 5\nIn Kubuntu 15 the list of layouts contains only two entries:\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop - Plasma empty desktop \n\n*Folder view - access to ~./Desktop\nThere are no Templates. \nThe default desktop has the \"Search & launch\" feature integrated.\n\nA: In this episode of the Linux Action Show they explain the concept when they reviewed KDE 4.8, but it has been improved upon since then. Since I watched this and the video's on the Vivaldi tablet were released (check those out as well, they explain why it could be usefull to attach certain files or folders to an activity) I understood how to use them and couldn't switch from it. \nThere are things that could be improbed upon are, as you already mentioned, that certain files which were open upon shutdown, or pausing of the activity, are not reopened when the activity is restarted. But it is very handy to be able to have different widgets on your desktop  with different activities. That way your desktop doesn't get cluttered and you will get less distracted. \nThat being said, it is only usefull when you do more than one of the same task where you need a specific setup often. \n\nA: I had exactly the same issues and questions with \"Activities\" as you.  I found the video Wicky posted to be instrumental in filling in gaps in my understanding of how Activities are suppose to improve upon traditional virtual desktops.  The most important thing I took away from watching the video was that activities are just another type of virtual desktop that allow for more fine tuned control over your experience.  Interesting examples of one or more features that could potentially be enabled in any activity are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Changing your power settings - say a presentation mode actvity - such that your screen never times out \n\n*Changing your default language / default keyboard to a different locale\n\n*Changing your default permissions; all apps launced run as root root - or - contrarily all apps have read-only access (sort of a super \"incognito\" mode I can't wait for this)!!\n\n*Changing your default printers\n\n*Changing you default email and calendar (from personal to work etc)\n\n*Restoring the most commonly used apps for that activity.  Moreover, apps are not launched, and thus memory not allocated until you actually use that virtual desktop, and could all be stopped when you decided to press the stop button for that activity.  Yes, currently the document you had open last isn't necessary launched, but that is a likely future feature.\n\n*Changing the default folders / widgets displayed on the desktop\n\n*Changing the way that scrolling and different button mouse clicks work \n\n\nAside from power-settings, mouse clicks, and basic application restoration, I'm not sure any of these other features have yet been implemented.  Indeed, my desire to figure this out came from someone else’s ask Ubuntu question where they were trying to write the app for language switching upon virtual desktop changes.\nOverall I think the thing most holding back progress is a nice GUI tool to configure activities to execute commands or apps, and seems a likely next step. \n\nA: Even if proper answers were already been given I would try with a simple example:\nI use the same laptop for work and personal use. It is very distracting to have personal email, open tabs, programs, etc... around when you work and vice versa.\nAt work I use a \"work\" activity where I have open my work email, browser with work tabs, programs and so on. When I go back home I click on \"home\" and, without losing anything, I have another laptop with my personal email opened, browser with my tabs, etc...\nThink also about messages and notifications popping up when you are doing a presentation or in a screen-share call\n\nA: The previous answer already explains it quite nicely.\nKDE has a feature where you can save all open windows. This means all windows will open again after a shut-down and restart, that were open/being used before.\nIn conjunction with this feature then, it is nice if you can have a few different projects open, and you can continue working on them uninterrupted, just by switching an activity button on your desktop. Just like stated above, it is like having different projects on different workspaces/different screens. \nIt is a great feature for multitaskers. You can, for example do your video editing on one activity screen, your bookkeeping for your business on another, and edit your journal or book on yet another virtual screen.\nBeware though, it takes some computing power.\nI think it is a nice feature for some people.\n\nA: What you could do with it (if there was a frontend for nepomuk for that goal) is to track the time you spent on certain activities. Right now you would use a timetracker, which you would need to set manually or let it track the programs you used (which will give you a biiiig list after not too long - I tried).\nThe information actually ist saved already, you just can't access and display it (yet).\n\nA: Activities are like virtual machines, all running different instances of KDE Plasma, with different configurations, each configuration tailored for a different task.\nPlus copy&paste between the virtual machines, not just of text but of entire applications!\n\nOf course, Activities are more useful if your interactions with your computer are strongly compartmentalized, otherwise the effort to customize the different Activities leads simply to different looking desktops (not that that cannot be an end in itself…).\n", "Q: lost data on partition I'm totally new on Ubuntu. Just decided to kick out the horrible windows 8: so I downloaded the last version of Ubuntu available on the web site , tried out the live cd and found it quite interesting. \nAfter starting to install I arrived to the part where I could choose and manage the partitions where I wanted to install Ubuntu. Being new to it decided not to touch where I wasn't sure as I didn't want to loose my data partition where I have accumulated my pictures for almost 6 years.\nSo I decided to go back and let the installation do it by itself. There was a warning saying I would lose all my data but I  supposed it would be just on the windows partition. After the install finished I started to wonder around my new OS and realized that I couldn't find my data partition. I guess this is not a new question at all, but I'm just a bit scared as I don't want to loose all the data I had. \nI've been reading and trying some solutions like mounting the partitions, but it seems that the only partitions I find is one called boot and another called swap along with sda2 which I tried to mount but got the message wrong nfts format. \nSo here is the big question: is there any chance to recover the partition or shall I forget about everything (my files) ?\n\nA: Many of the answers above are much more reliable, but in case you've really messed it up, like I've done in the past, then you can try this as a last-resort option.\nFor this, you'll want to use TestDisk. Once you have installed and launched TestDisk on a LiveCD/USB:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select [Analyse]\n\n*Select the disk that you want to recover from\n\n*Select the partition table type. For most people it will be Intel/PC\n\n*Following the analysis, TestDisk may find some partitions. If it finds your old data partition, simply have it written to the disk, and that should be that.\n\n*If TestDisk doesn't find any/the right partition, try a deeper search. Once again, if this finds the partition, simply write it to the disk, and you're done.\n\n*If, like in my case, TestDisk is unable to write the partition to the disk, you can try creating a new partition with the exact specifications (cylinders, heads, sectors, type) your old one had, and that should be able to recover it.\n\n\nIf data has been written to the disk where the old partition was, which is probably the only reason you would ever need to resort to step #6, then it is likely that some/many files will be corrupted; results may vary.\nIf you want to read the original tutorial where I found these steps, which includes descriptive pictures, click here.\n\nA: It may be possible to undelete the data partition using a tool called testdisk (see here). If not, you can still probably recover the individual photos, documents, etc. by running photorec (which comes with testdisk).\nPhotorec will find files even after the partition has been formatted (as happened in your case), but you'll need to recover them to another drive - so you'll need to plug in an external drive. Depending on how important your data is to you, you might consider a professional data recovery service as well, but in my experience photorec works quite well (you do have to sift through everything manually though as the file names will not be recovered).\nFrom the website:\n\nPhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and archives from hard disks, CD-ROMs, and lost pictures (thus the Photo Recovery name) from digital camera memory. PhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted.\n\nTo install testdisk and photorec from a live CD (make sure the Universe repository is enabled):\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\n\n\nA: Yes. There is a good chance to recover your partitions. Nevertheless you must run the whole process from a CD/DVD/USB in order to recover your disk to the previous partition tables. You can't bring back a partition while part of/or the whole disk is mounted. So I suggest you to make a live-cd in order to run the process.\nParts of this answer comes from this previous answer.\nThe procedure I used is documented at the very bottom, placed here for your convenience:\nIMPORTANT: Try not to use forensic recovery procedures and not to use MS based recovery tools in the first instance.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*First of all you calm down.\n  Tranquil, if you erased or removed\n  the partition's table, the data is\n  still there. You need to find a way\n  to bring it back, that's it.\n  \n*The most you can keep the drive off\n  new data, the best for your data. If\n  you write new data, the older data\n  will be replaced by the new as this\n  starts using the clusters.\n  \n*If possible, try not using MS based\n  tools, which (in my case) just wrote\n  a few clusters in the disk which\n  made unusable some data. MS Recovery\n  Tools (such as Easy Data Recovery\n  and others) tries to read the\n  partition table but it also writes\n  some clusters which can't be fully\n  read in order to recover the \"usable\n  part of the data\". This may harm\n  your data replacing the original\n  allocation clusters with blank data\n  which allows the software to gain\n  access to the cluster itself.\n  \n*Follow the instructions shown on the\n  video documented by amzertech, which\n  was embedded in the previous post\n  and that clearly explains exactly\n  what I did in order to recover my\n  data.\n  \n*If you follow these instructions, I\n  am sure you are going to succeed.\n  Even in the worst cases ([...])\n  you will succeed if you follow this\n  easy instructions. Remember, the\n  data will remain intact if you leave\n  the disk intact. The most things you\n  do to the disk, will be the most\n  risk your data is reaching.\n  \n\nIf you need further assistance don't hesitate to drop a comment. \nGood luck!\n", "Q: Using ncftp or other ftp command-line software to get directories I'm transferring files from a FTP client to my ubuntu server using the terminal. I was able to upload a backup of some files that were already zipped but there are some files I need that are in a folder that can not be zipped or archived.\nWith NcFTP or other using another way, how can I transfer a folder of files (And sub-folders) without having to archived/zipped the folder? I am unable to do this because the files are on a shared hosting account for a game server and they're replying to slow while I'm asking them to archived it.\n\nA: Well you don't say that there is strictly the need to use a command in the terminal in order to do the work so I guess what you wish is some terminal software which can handle ftp servers, such as a ftp client gui but for terminal purposes. \nIf I am right, I suggest you to give a chance to Midnight Commander. Inside of which you will be able to connect to a ftp server in order to put or get files the same as folders (with files recursively).\nCertain ftp server commands are allowed, such as the chmod for changing the permissions of the files/folders and there is the help of a dual tree window in which you can handle the contents of both your local device and remote server.\nHere is a screenshot to illustrate:\n\nThis screenshots are taken in a unity desktop (12.04) but the same screens you'll find in terminal mode. Here is a step by step process in order to connect to a ftp. (Mouse supported only in GUI)\nFirst let's hit F9 in order to get in the PullDown Menu. Let's go to the \"Left\" menu and choose \"FTP Link\" as shown.\n\nThe machine name will be asked, let's write in this box using the next format:\nuser:password@ftpserver.com\n\nThis will send your username and password to the desired ftp server. If everything runs ok you'll be able to see the contents of your ftp server on the left side of the Midnight Commander windows.\n\nIf you succeeded, let's hit the TAB window in order to move the pointer to the right pane, in which you can choose which files/folders (with files) you wish to copy, move, delete, etc. You may wish to read the manual before using midnight commander but it is quite easy to use indeed.\nMidnight commander is a powerful application that can be installed directly from the terminal using the next command:\nsudo apt-get install mc\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Bind Super + Numpad 4 I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 and would like to rebind Super + Num4 to \"Put window on the left side of the screen\"\nBased upon this question, I was able to setup my binding using the CompizConf Grid settings, however the default hotkey to for the 4th Launcher icon is taking precedence over my binding.

It seems that its default behaviour is to override the default route, even if the OpenVPN server isn't pushing it.\nYou can fix that behaviour by editing the VPN connection and on the IPv4 settings tab select the 'Routes...' button.\nYou'll see an option called 'Use this connection only for resources on this network'.  Make sure that's enabled and then restart your VPN.  That should sort you out.\n\nA: Edit the respective lines in yor .ovpn file.

Follow the guide according to whether you want CUPS or LPR, Brother recommends cups. I have heard following these steps have worked for others and that the MFC print drivers is all you should need on some models to make both work. Mine doesn't work this way. I have never came across one that works this way.\nI searched all these websites and couldn't find a Brother MFC-240C scanner that was supported. However, I did see a Brother MFC-7240 and a Brother MFC-230C. So for your sake I hope you made a typo and your device is supported. The photo copy part of the machine is not handled by your computer and should work whether its connected to a computer or not.\nThis being a brother device I do know that they can be a pain to get both printer and scanning capabilities to work correctly in any Linux distrobution if it isn't supported. I've read where others have the same issue as you with Brother devices, printer works scanner doesn't. I have a brother MFC device that has never worked correctly and it seems never will unless I learn how to write device drivers. I can get it to work if I don't set it up as a printer first. But if the scanner works the printer part never will, and vice versa. So you can try removing the printer set up and driver, disconnect it from the computer. Then reconnect it and try setting it up to scan first. If that works then you can try setting up printer and hope they both work that way. Mine wouldn't. Its one or the other.\nOther than what I have already stated the following is basically my experience and some suggestions. I work for a networking/computer repair company and I personally specialize in printer networking and repairs. Always check that the device you have in mind to buy is supported in Linux and Ubuntu before buying. You'll save yourself a possible headache.  I always recommend HP devices for Linux systems, they are usually supported, at least the ones I have came across, and are a snap to get working. Research what other people have bought and have had good experiences with when installing and using in Linux. In my experiences, multi function printers/scanners/fax machines can be a pain to get working correctly if unsupported in any version of Linux. Also, I've found that USB devices work and are easier to configure compared to Parallel devices that hardly ever work for scanning especially. That being said it has been a few years since I've installed any type of MFC on a linux machine because most of our customers use Windows and the ones that use Linux I have to set it up once and they never screw up so I hardly have to fix them again.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to internet in ubuntu 12.10 using MTS I have recently installed Ubuntu 12.10(64 bit).\nBut was not able connect to internet using my MTS modem.\nIt detects My modem, but says 'not enabled' even after enabling mobile broadband.\nBut some times, very rarely (once in a day) the 'not enabled' changed to somthing like 'CDMA home network...evdo' and then i was able to connect.\nI googled around and found that this is due to buggy 'modem manager 0.6.0.0' which comes shipped with ubuntu 12.10.

However, these are already installed. \nI also deleted the /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules so it could be created from fresh at start and the contents are as follows:\n# PCI device 0x14e4:/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.1/0000:08:00.0 (wl)\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", ATTR{address}==\"e4:d5:3d:7b:a6:cb\", ATTR{dev_id}==\"0x0\", ATTR{type}==\"1\", KERNEL==\"eth*\", NAME=\"eth1\"\n\nI am really at a loss to understand what is happening and how to arrive at a solution. Can anyone help?\n\nA: You want to first remove everything from your /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf that you may have added, as well as that one line you added to /etc/rc.local. \nFirst thing to try:\nWith your wifi device plugged in, search for \"Software Sources\" and open the app. Go to the \"Additional Drivers\" tab. There you will find an option to enable your wireless device.\nSecond thing to try:\nIf this does not work, uninstall and then reinstall the bcmwl-kernel-source package, then reboot. You should then perform the step above to make the change survive each kernel upgrade.\nYou can see a further explanation here. Basically, when you upgraded the kernel, the wireless driver, which is an extra that needs to be built into each kernel, was not carried along.\n\nA: Sorry guys, I am not able to try out anything you suggested. One of the answers that came to my mind, was a fresh install. Thats what I did. The problem does not exist now.\nEDIT:\nIt happened again on a fresh install. This time, I went to the software sources, and chose the proprietary drivers tab. I chose to disable the wireless device and applied the new settings. Point to note, that before applying, the broadcom device was selected and underneath the wifi entry, it was written that this is using an alternate driver (where it currently mentions, device is not working).\nI restarted after applying the changes and now its working.\nPlease look at pic for better understanding.\n\n\nA: You should try following command:\nrfkill unblock all\n\n\nA: This is a bit of a guess but I had to set the channel rather than use auto. You can download apps to point you at a good channel if this is the problem\n", "Q: problem installing meld on 12.04 64 bit LTS(1) I get this error during apt-get  BUT - when I install my original disk it still doesn't like it and requests this specific disk again.

Is it Normal? I'm using Samsung 5 Series NP535U4X-S01ID with specification of AMD Quad-Core A8-4555M processor and AMD Radeon HD 7600G + HD 7550M Dual Graphics.\nI've just installed Ubuntu 12.10 and I use the AMD nee ATI: Thames [Radeon 7500M/7600M Series] driver which is recommended by the ubuntu software sources.\nBut after I update to this AMD \"recommended\" driver, my average laptop temperature rise up to 75C. Is this normal? Or what should I do to reduce the average temperature?\n(The fan sounds loud right now.)\n\nA: You need to turn off your Radeon GPU in order to resolve your problem with temperature and fan sound! I used that method on 12.04, 12.10 and is working perfectly.\nCheck THIS question also.\nMore informations about Hybrid Graphics here\n\nA: Anything between 45-65 ° Celcius is fine if you working on regular applications and the number of application you are running is not abnormally high. However, even in such circumstances, the temperature may rise beyond this range due to dust or other underlying softwares or some other reasons I am not aware of.\nIf your system heats up regularly, try cleaning up your vents, near the fans which block air by either blowing air through it or using soft brushes.\nSome applications like Jupiter help control temperature by adjusting system performance accordingly. See instructions for installing Jupiter here.\n\nA: My laptop has 50-60 degrees of Celsius (older Asus eeePc with Atom CPU). Nowadays I'm using Intel Core i5 CPU on HP ProBook notebook and the temperature doesn't reach over 40 degrees. Sometimes the graphic chipset can make the temperature higher. \nIn case that you are using Linux try to monitor the mostly used processes with high system resources usage.\n\nA: I use ubuntu on a laptop too (a crappy one).\n75 C is just fine, as long as it doesn't get over 90 (it will shut down your system,\nand thus making it an unreliable system).\nIf you cant keep it at this temperature, you should try to look for what actually overheats it(in my case the cpu sometimes went up to 100C), then search for a fixing programm that lets you controll the speed of the overheating piece of hardware :)!\nCheers, Max\n\nA: average temperature of my laptop is 50 to 55 degree Celsius.when no application is running then it comes down to 35 to 37 degree celsius and when my cpu usage reach up to 80% then my cpu temperature is 70 degree celsius... \n\nA: I had installed Core Temp after I began having some sudden black outs; after quickly figuring out the high temps were forcing the shutdowns, I began researching a fix for the problem and was afraid I would have to take the machine apart (which you end up doing to get to the fan) to fix it.\nI ended up trying the most simple suggestion. I took a drinking straw and flattened one end, taped of half of the flattened end for a more stream line flow of air; popped a piece of bread in my mouth to get rid of all the moisture in my mouth; then blew both through the exhaust backwards, into the heat sink, and forward down through the fan vents.  I saw several plumes of dust when I blew from either direction, and when I turned my machine back on was amazed that it dropped from 80c to 35-40c while running processor taxing programs.  It's seemed like a miracle.  \nApparently a vacuum is a bad choice for this fix, because of static electricity.  A vacuum conducts static electricity and can send it through your computer, though very unlikely.\n\nA: I recently answered a similar question, check it out.\nOtherwise, follow the official documentation of ATI or this great thread\nI am pretty sure that's a driver issue unfortunately.

I broke something in my winecfg. Thus, It won't run any Windows apps in wine anymore. (I cannot afford to mv .wine and reinstall).\nHow do I override a dll using the command line. I disabled rpcrt4.dll by accident and want to undo it.\nWhen launching winecfg or any windows application like MS Word, Wine prints this error message:  \nerr:module:import_dll Library rpcrt4.dll (which is needed by L\"C:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\explorer.exe\") not found\n\n\nA: Firstly, try using winetricks on the command-line to revert just your winecfg dll settings back to defaults with:\nwinetricks alldlls=default\n\nIf this doesn't solve the problem, you can use WINEDLLOVERRIDES; it is an environmental variable that can be used with wine to specify the dll overrides you want (or don't require). As stated on the manpage, WINEDLLOVERRIDES\n\nDefines  the  override  type  and load order of dlls used in the loading process for any dll. There are currently two types of libraries that can be  loaded  into  a  process'  address  space:  native  windows  dlls\n                (native),  wine  internal dlls (builtin).  The type may be abbreviated with the first letter of the type (n,\n                b).  The library may also be disabled (''). Each sequence of orders must be separated by commas.\n\nYou can either export the environmental variable, or use env and specify the variable to be used with the wine command (if you don't specify a WINEPREFIX it will use the default):\nenv WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"rpcrt4=b,n\" wine exe_to_run\n\nThis will specify that the builtin version should be tried, then the native version. If you instead use \"rpcrt4=\", then that dll will remain disabled and wine will not run at all.\nIf you want to export the value to the shell for that session, you can run\nexport WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"rpcrt4=b,n\" \n\nThis will not affect the settings in winecfg, and they will remain the same. This environmental variable, and many other useful ones available with wine are only temporary and merely affect the shell in which they are used, either by exporting the variable or using env each time to state the variable and then run wine with that variable as it launches your program. You could also specify environmental variables in a bash script that launched your wine programs.\nFor more information, please see man wine, the Ubuntu manpages online, and the useful wine FAQ.\n\nA: I assume you can do it via ~/wine/user.reg, where you should look list of dlls under [Software\\Wine\\DllOverrides]\n", "Q: How can one get sound louder for a laptop that comes with Dolby Home Theater? Is there anyway to get sound louder if you fail to enable the Dolby Home Theater on Ubuntu? The laptop in question is a Z580 Lenovo.

To use bcdedit, run cmd.exe as an administrator, then enter bcdedit to show all boot entries, note the {GUID} specified for the Ubuntu entry, and then remove it: \n bcdedit /delete {GUID}\n\nTo remove Wubi from the add/remove list, delete the registry key:\n HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\Wubi\n\nAfter deleting the registry key, Ubuntu may still appear in the program list. If this is the case, you may be asked if you would like to remove the item from the list.\n\nA: In your comments, you mention:\n\nI don't know how to get rid of Ubuntu, so I can install a clean new windows OS\n\nIf this is all you want to do, then you don't need to uninstall anything.\n\nSTOP: Be careful, the following steps will *delete all data from your hard drive. If this is not what you want, then you're using the word \"format\" incorrectly.\n\nSimply run your Windows install CD from boot.  During installation, the Windows installer will ask if you want to Reinstall Windows, Upgrade Windows, and/or Install from Scratch (though it might use different wording). Indicate that you want to install from scratch.\nThere may be another option allowing you to format the hard drive.  Make sure this is selected (or that you answer \"Yes\").\nPS: You may have to select something similar to \"Advanced Install/Setup\" in order to see it.\n", "Q: Ctrl + V will not work if I close the application I copied text from I always have to keep an application open I copied text from to paste the text somewhere. In fact the copied text will be saved to Klipper (if Klipper is on) after it has been copied. But why cannot a simple shortcut Ctrl + V be used to paste the copied text?\nOS: Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS, KDE version: 4.4.5\n\nA: Because the text is not actually \"copied\" anywhere. The copying application notifies the X server that it has the CLIPBOARD selection. The pasting application asks the X server which application has the CLIPBOARD selection, and then communicates with the application to negotiate content transfer. This obviously fails if the copying application has been closed.\n", "Q: upgrade to 12.04.2 and all *-quantal packages I have Ubuntu 12.04 installed and upgraded. I noticed lots of packages with -quantal suffix (kernel, xorg stack, drivers, etc.), which is included in 12.04.2 upgrade.  How to easily upgrade all of my installed packages to *-quantal equivalent?\n\nA: sudo update-manager -d\n\nHowever you are on newest stable Ubuntu edition. This command will allow you to switch to DEVELOPMENT version of Ubuntu!\nExplanation of *-quantal packages present in precise edition\nUbuntu updates are split into few categories ranging from security, to back-ported.\nBack ported describe package with version of software that will land in next Ubuntu version, but is deemed stable enough and can bring enough value to Ubuntu users that packages for earlier versions are released.\nYou can check settings in Update Manager or in Ubuntu Software Center, for all options.\nEach update category is optional (yes you can even disable security updates, but its not an good idea).\nAll that mean that you can benefit from newest software versions any Ubuntu can offer without potential troubles of using development version of Ubuntu.\nUbuntu will provide you with notification when Ubuntu 13.04 is ready.

For viewing which of these additional options are enabled by default, as well as which options should only be changed when completely necessary by a well-informed user, one must use the help provided (from CLI) by dpkg --force-help.

Following is the quote from Gigolo's Help Document\n\nThere is no support for direct storing of passwords at all in Gigolo. Instead by using GVfs we get support for gnome-keyring for free. All you have to do is to install the gnome-keyring package (and maybe restart your session).

I tried to install Ubuntu 12.10 with the Wubi installer while running Windows, because my PC does not accept my BootCD as a bootable medium.\nBut Wubi showed me this error:\nUbuntu-Installationsprogramm\n(X) Ein Fehler ist aufgetreten:\nCould not retrieve the required disk image files\nWeiter Informationen finden Sie in der Protokolldatei:\nc:\\users\\username\\appdata\\local\\temp\\wubi-12.10-rev273.log\n\nWhat can I do, because I want to get rid of my Windows 7 and use the way better Ubuntu 12.10?\nThanks for your huge answer, now my next problem after trying to install wubi with the .iso is, that the same error shows up again and i am not shure which part of the errorreport you need.\nCan you tell me? Because i'm not that good at linux.\n\nA: I cannot tell you exactly what went wrong, because you didn't include anything from the log file the error message told you has more information.\nHowever, the general problem is that the Wubi installer is unable to download an Ubuntu ISO image.\n\n*\n\n*One common cause of this problem is that the Wubi installer is unable to use bittorrent. This is how it downloads ISO images. No special software is required on your computer to facilitate this (wubi.exe contains everything necessary). But, this does not work well on some Internet connections. Yours could be one.\n\n*If you want more detailed information about the cause of the problem, please edit your question to include the contents of that log file (c:\\users\\username\\appdata\\local\\temp\\wubi-12.10-rev273.log).\n\nIt sounds like you already tried burning an Ubuntu ISO to a DVD, so you probably already have an ISO image. If you do, and if it is an ISO image for Ubuntu 12.10, just put it and wubi.exe (the Wubi installer) in a folder that contains no other files, and run wubi.exe again.\nIf you don't have an appropriate ISO image, you can download one manually on the download page, and put it in an otherwise empty folder with wubi.exe.\nIf you're already running Wubi from the DVD you burned (or from a USB flash drive you created, or by mounting the ISO image), then this means the installation medium is corrupted. That is, either the ISO image contains wrong data, or the DVD/USB contains wrong data (which could happen from wrong data in the ISO, or due to other problems, most commonly due to something going wrong when it is burned/written).\nSo if that's the case, MD5 test the ISO image. If it's bad, download the ISO again (and test it again too). If it's good, make sure you're burning the DVD or writing the USB flash drive correctly. In particular, remember that the desktop ISO for Ubuntu 12.10 (but not earlier versions) requires a DVD, it is too big to fit on a CD.\nSometimes a DVD will come out better if you burn it at a slower speed.\nWubi might not meet your needs, though.\nYou said:\n\nWhat can I do, because I want to get rid of my Windows 7 and use the way better Ubuntu 12.10?\n\nIf you install with Wubi, Ubuntu will be installed inside a rewritable disk image file stored inside your Windows system. So, while Windows will not be running while you use Ubuntu, you will not be able to remove Windows and keep Ubuntu. (Actually, you could, if you converted your Wubi installation to a regular installation. But you would have to be able to boot from external media to do this, so if you can do that, then you can just install a regular Ubuntu system in the first place.)\nSo you probably shouldn't use Wubi. How you should install Ubuntu depends on what went wrong in your first attempt (before you tried Wubi):\nIf you tried to burn it to a CD, that won't work starting with 12.10 (the version you're trying to install). Burn it to a DVD instead.\nIf your computer won't boot DVDs, or you don't have a DVD, or you'd prefer not to use a DVD, then you can write the ISO image to a USB stick instead.\nAs stated above, your ISO image, DVD, or USB flash drive could be corrupted. So test the ISO image, and make sure you're writing the DVD or USB correctly (see the two links just above this paragraph). Corruption can interfere with regular installations as well as Wubi installations, and can even prevent your DVD from booting entirely. As stated above, if you're trying to install from a DVD, burning the DVD slowly can reduce the likelihood of corruption.\nIf your DVD/USB boots but doesn't get very far, then you can usually test the DVD/USB itself. When you see a purple screen with person and keyboard icons at the bottom (this is very early in the boot process after you boot from the DVD/USB), press a key to bring up the text-based boot menu. Then select Check disc for defects.

Here's what fixed it for me - I just had an old installation file.\nWhen googling \"Download wubi\"  go to the newest link e.g. I used: https://softfamous.com/postdownload-file/wubi/3746/706/\nInstall from the executable you download.\n", "Q: Complete Removal of Mediatomb I recently changed to miniDLNA as my main DLNA server, however I tried removing mediatom via the normal ways (apt-get remove ...) and I still get:\n[   33.926615] init: mediatomb main process (1340) terminated with status 1\n[   33.975586] init: mediatomb main process ended, respawning\n\nHow do I get rid of this permanently?\nJ\n\nA: The service is probably still present. If so these files will be on your system: \n/etc/mediatomb.conf\n/etc/init.d/mediatomb\n\nThe software should be installed in:  \n/etc/mediatomb/\n\nIf still present remove that too. \napt-get remove will not remove everything; apt-get --purge remove removes config files too. But manually added upstart scripts you need to remove yourself.\n\nA: Another way to do this would be to first run:\nsudo find / -name mediatomb\n\nReview the findings to make sure there are no files you want to keep  then run:\nsudo find / -name mediatomb | xargs rm -f\n\nThis will force the delete of all the files found with the find command.  If you want to confirm the deletion beforehand you can run:\nsudo find / -name mediatomb | xargs rm -i\n\n\nA: First seek it out:\nsudo find / -name mediatomb\n\nYou will get a list of files and directories. Paste all your findings inline with the super dangerous recursive force delete AND include the log files like so: \nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/mediatomb /usr/share/mediatomb /usr/bin/mediatomb /etc/logrotate.d/mediatomb /etc/mediatomb /etc/default/mediatomb /var/log/mediatomb.*\n\nThen kill the running spawn:\n$ ps axo pid,comm | grep mediatomb\n[PID_NUMBER] mediatomb\n$ sudo kill -9 [PID_NUMBER] \n\nNot wise to use wild cards lazy whiz's. Enjoi & Whistle\n\nA: Your sudo find / -name mediatomb finds files AND directories. rm will only delete files, you must use rmdir to remove (empty) directories.sudo find / -name mediatomb -type f will find only files. Rather than traverse the whole filesystem, I suggest using rm -rf instead (read man rm).\nWhile sudo runs the find as root, the xargs command is run as the user, which causes several of your errors.  \nSince mediatomb is an installed package, you should use a package manager to remove it - that will find ALL the pieces, and update its database. sudo apt-get purge mediatomb will do the trick the right way.\n", "Q: How do I access the file system as a root or owner? I need to add online store configuration files in file system var/www. but I can't access the file system, because it says that only owner can access it, the owner is root.\nSo, how can I access those files? Or is it possible for me to use my file system as a owner?\nI need to create a directory named ubuntu in var/www and store my online store configuration files.\n\nA: By default /var/www is owned by root:root and no one but the admin can add or change files there. You need to set contents of /var/www/ to the correct permissions.  There are several methods but the one I use: set the group to www-data and add your user to that group.\nSetting group www-data: \nsudo chgrp -R www-data /var/www/ubuntu\n\nAdd your user to www-data:\nsudo usermod -a -G www-data $USER\n\nThat way you are part of the group that can write inside /var/www/. \nBut I would start by reading the documentation that you got with the webserver since this is just a small part in setting the correct and secure permissions. Directories tend to have permissions set to 755 or 775 and files to 644 or 664 depending on who you want to be able to do things. \n\nA: Try sudo -s command in terminal. But make sure you know what you’re doing.\nAlso, if you don’t want to mess with terminal, you can press ALT+F2 and enter gksu nautilus. This will open a file manager window from root user.\n\nA: A more GUI friendly way is using the gksu command in terminal it gives you a little pop up box and type in Nautilus to open it as root\n", "Q: How to boot USB in UEFI mode? we recently bought a new windows 8 laptop, and we are trying to install Ubuntu to it in a dual boot configuration. I downloaded the 64 bit 12.10 iso and put it in a USB stick, both with the utility recommended from the Ubuntu installation guide and with Unetbootin. \nHowever, when I reboot the laptop and select from BIOS the USB as first option, it just flashes the Toshiba logo for 2 seconds and then reboots again and does this ad infinitum (I disabled SecureBoot) until I remove the usb stick and then it boots normally into windows. If I however turn on the option CSM/legacy boot in the BIOS I CAN boot into the usb installer, so I don't think it is an issue with the usb stick nor the iso image. \nThe question is, how do I get it to boot in UEFI mode? Or should I just keep going in legacy mode and hope the installer recognizes the UEFI boot? \n\nA: In the end I ended up installing it in CSM/Compatibility mode. It didn't boot. But then using the Ubuntu version with BootRepair as a Live USB disk I ran BootRepair and it installed the EFI files and changed the booting mode and it worked. I still have no idea why it didn't work from the beginning.\n", "Q: Kubuntu : display avatar in lightDM lightDM isn't displaying my avatar when I try to login (i changed it in kde control center)\nwould it work if I used gnome control center for user management ?\n\nA: When you change your avatar via your KDE settings a hidden image called .face.icon is stored in your /home folder. Unfortunately lightdm looks for an image called .face, which doesn't exist and that's the reason why Login screen doesn't match with user settings.\nAn easy workaround is to copy your .face.icon and rename it to .face\nIn my opinion this is, however, something that should be fixed in near future.\n", "Q: How to run same query on multiple servers via the jump server I have many servers like sdeuu1, sdeuu2, sdeuu3,.. etc.\nI want to run a query on each one of them and the query is :\ngrep -i 'SponsoredLinksIFrame.jsp' /home/nextag/httpd_logs/access_log.1360* | \n  grep -ic 'nextag.co.uk'\n\nthis query is returning perfect results when ran on separate servers.\nNow i have one server named sdalp1 through which i can ssh to sdeuu1, 2, 3 etc.. and go to that server to run the query. Now instead of doing that i want to run the query from sdalp1 for all the sdeuu servers in one go and i tried the following command and a few other versions of it:\nfor i in sdeuu1 sdeuu2 sdeuu3 sdeuu4 sdeuu5      \\\n         sdeuu6 sdeuu7 sdeuu8 sdeuu9 sdeuu10     \\\n         sdeuu11 sdeuu12 sdeuu13 sdeuu14 sdeuu15 \\\n         sdeuu16 sdeuu17 sdeuu18; do \n  grep -i 'SponsoredLinksIFrame.jsp' /home/nextag/httpd_logs/access_log.1360* | \n    grep -ic 'nextag.co.uk'\"\n  echo $i\ndone\n\nBut this command is returning an error for all servers as follows: \n-bash: grep -i 'SponsoredLinksIFrame.jsp' /home/nextag/httpd_logs/access_log.1360* | grep -ic 'nextag.co.uk': No such file or directory \n\nWhat is the problem here, i am not getting if this is an issue with permissions?\n\nA: for i in sdeuu1 sdeuu2 sdeuu3 sdeuu4 sdeuu5      \\\n         sdeuu6 sdeuu7 sdeuu8 sdeuu9 sdeuu10     \\\n         sdeuu11 sdeuu12 sdeuu13 sdeuu14 sdeuu15 \\\n         sdeuu16 sdeuu17 sdeuu18; do \n  ssh $i grep -i 'SponsoredLinksIFrame.jsp' /home/nextag/httpd_logs/access_log.1360* \\| \\\n    grep -ic 'nextag.co.uk'\n  echo $i\ndone\n\nNote that I added ssh $i to the start of the command inside the loop.\nI also added a backslash (\\) to the pipe symbol (|), so that the second grep happens on each individual server for efficiency. And then I also needed a backslash at the end of that line to indicate a continuation line, since the escaped pipe symbol no longer does it. When you type this in, make sure you don't put any spaces after that last backslash.\nIf that's confusing, you can also do it with everything on one line:\nfor i in sdeuu1 sdeuu2 sdeuu3 sdeuu4 sdeuu5      \\\n         sdeuu6 sdeuu7 sdeuu8 sdeuu9 sdeuu10     \\\n         sdeuu11 sdeuu12 sdeuu13 sdeuu14 sdeuu15 \\\n         sdeuu16 sdeuu17 sdeuu18; do \n  ssh $i grep -i 'SponsoredLinksIFrame.jsp' /home/nextag/httpd_logs/access_log.1360* \\| grep -ic 'nextag.co.uk'\n  echo $i\ndone\n\nIf you haven't already, you can set up passwordless ssh login so that you don't have to type a password in for each server.\n", "Q: Cannot boot ubuntu CD on UEFI new laptop (Toshiba Satellite L850)?

I bought 1 month ago a 64x Laptop with Windows 8 pre-installed.\nUsing UnetBootin I installed Ubuntu 12.10 and completely removed Windows 8.\nNow, the new Ubuntu version is a bit too heavy for my slow laptop, I therefor decided to try Bodhi or Fedora. Like I did for installing Ubuntu, I downloaded UnetBootin for Linux, and the Bodhi image. I thought I could simply run UnetBootin and follow the same steps as I did on Windows, and then install Bodhi...\nBut as I double click the downloaded UnetBootin executable [\"unetbootin-linux-583\"] it gives me the following error:\nCould not display \"/home/laptop/Desktop/unetbootin-linux-583\".\nThere is no application installed for executable files.\nDo you want to search for an application to open this file?\n\nI searched before about the error, and found several times the tip to change the Allow executing file as a program in the properties. I tried, and now if I double click, nothing happens at all.\n\nA: You have probably forgotten to make the unetbootin file executable. \nRight click on unetbootin-linux-583, click on Properties, choose the tab Permissions. Check the small square Allow executing file as program.\nNow double click unetbootin-linux-583 and fill in your password.\nYou can also do it through the command line. Open a Terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T and type:\ncd /path/to/unetbootin\nchmod +x unetbootin-linux-583\n./unetbootin-linux-583\n\nFinally, fill in your password.\n\nA: Go in the software center and download wine. Then, download the windows version of unetbooting and run it with wine! Profit!\n", "Q: Unable to mount filesystem as read-write in recovery mode I deleted two unused user accounts.

However, the filesystem is read-only!\nI can only access root shell via recovery.\nCan you help me?\n\nA: If I am not wrong, the filesystem is mounted read-only by default in Recovery mode. To mount it as read-write, go the recovery mode and choose root. Now type the following command:\nmount -o rw,remount /\n\nNote the spaces, you'll get an error if you ignore the spaces, or add extra ones too. And then you can copy as you tried earlier.\n\nA: Recently on my Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, I encountered error \"System is running in low-graphics mode\" and there is no way you can login or proceed beyond this error screen.\nFor me this happened when I renamed /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d directory while I was trying to solve one of the graphics related problems.\nWorkaround:\nOn the error window, press ctrl+alt+f3 to get to the console. Here the filesystem is mounted but in read-only mode so you can't edit to rename the directory back for correction.\nTo mount the filesystem in read-write mode, use following command\nCommand: mount -o rw,remount /\nIt would mount the filesystem in read-write mode.

Why is the terminal prompt unchanged when I log in as root? I.e, my default prompt is 0|storm@sky:~ %, but when I log in as root, it's something like ~ root] #. How do I change that variable, and would it affect my other prompts?\n\nA: @Eugene.\nI'm not sure if I understand your question but if by \"prompt\" you mean the $PS1 variable you can try to change it through one of these files ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc or /etc/profile. Those files would be read by the shell after you login, which means you'll have to logout and login again to make those changes available.\nThe $PS1 variable is the first prompt string variable which defines your 0|storm@sky:~%. The second one is the $PS2 which is usually seen as \">\" (\"greater than\" symbol).\nLet me show you some options:\n$ PS1=\"\\d$\" #date format\nSun Jan 9$\n\n$ PS1=\"\\u$\" #username\njohn$\n\n$ PS1=\"\\h$\" #hostname\nyour_computers_name$\n\nThe combination of some of these options will define your prompt string.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Should I use ZimageZ in Xubuntu xfce to store my screenshots? xfce4-screenshooter is offering to upload your screenshots automatically to zimagez.com but how long will they keep your screenshots there?\nSee this article about the tool on webud8.org\nIf it is not stored \"forever\", it would be an unreliable way of sending someone your screenshot.\n\nA: From their FAQ(roughly translated):\n\"Only anonymous images that have been inactive for several months (thumbnails not clicked) are automatically deleted, so there is no risk to see your collection go up in smoke :)\"\nYou would probably have to contact them directly to get more specific answers.\n", "Q: Why is top breaking history-search-backward in bash? I have a line in my .bashrc the following line:\nbind '\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward'\n\nthat causes that when I write \"abc\" to command prompt and press up arrow, bash searches in history only for commands that start with \"abc\". All is fine until I run top (and maybe some other applications that I am not sure about, with top, I am sure) when this behaviour is reversed to normal search. However, when I run bind '\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward'\n in terminal, nothing changes and I have to kill and restart the terminal to get the old behaviour back. Is there a way to reverse it (or prevent it from happening?) This happens in gnome-terminal and xterm in Unity and Gnome Shell. tty seems to be not affected.\nMy -bashrc on top of stok ubuntu .bashrc is this:\nbind '\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward'\nbind '\"\\e[B\": history-search-forward'\n# that behaviour is for pageup and pagedown\nbind '\"\\e[5~\": previous-history'\nbind '\"\\e[6~\": next-history'\n\n# show possibilities if tab ambigious\nset show-all-if-ambiguous on\n# ignore case when completing, lets see how it works\nset completion-ignore-case on\n\n\nshopt -s cdspell\nHISTSIZE=10000\nHISTCONTROL=ignoredups\nHISTFILESIZE=10001\nHISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%h/%d - %H:%M:%S \"\nshopt -s histappend\nPROMPT_COMMAND=\"history -a; history -c; history -r; $PROMPT_COMMAND\"\n\n\nA: It turns out that some misbehaving applications break the cursor mode. The symptoms are similar to when we accidentally cat a binary file to terminal.\nThe fix is to call reset. If Enter is also broken, then we can use Ctrl+J as also mentione here.\nAs to the original question of why top (or in my case some random script that uses escape characters for colorful output) breaks history-search-backward. When it is broken, you can run read and then hit the arrow keys. Usually it is \\e[A but when broken it may become \\eOA. So, one could map that to history-search-backward as well, but usually the terminal is not in a very usable state and reset fixes the issue.\n\nA: Try edit binds in /etc/inputrc file.\nI use 'history-search-backward' on all linux systems and I have no problem with top.\nIf you have problems with editing the file, see my answer here.\n", "Q: Why do system sounds only play in mono? I've attached a screenshot of pavucontrol.\nIs there a way to have the system sounds play in stereo and not mono? It seems when it's set to mono, it only plays the sound out of my left speaker. Music apps play just find in stereo, and I'm able to adjust the L/R channels independently.\nI'm on Ubuntu 12.10, 3.5.0-23-generic. Thanks for any help!\n\n\nA: While I'm not sure of the exact rationale for this decision to play the sounds as mono, the reason why they are mono is because the system is supposed to play the sounds on either side of the system depending on where your mouse is positioned. It doesn't always work perfectly, but that is the intended behaviour.\nUnfortunately this seems to be hard-coded, so that you cannot change this behaviour without editing the source code to Gnome itself.\n", "Q: Gnote / Tomboy WebDAV connecting error If I want to sync my notes with WebDAV server, I get the following error messages in Gnote and Tomboy:\n\nThis synchronization addin is not supported on your computer.

The copy works on my HP PC which has Windows XP installed. \nWhen I try to install it in my Dell machine, it tells me that it cannot find an operating system and asks me to clean my hard drive. How do I install or make a Live Boot?\n\nA: If you just want a live session or just want to wipe Windows ME to install Ubuntu, there is nothing related to the current operating system. Just make sure you selected \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" when booting into your copy to get live session. Or just simply select \"Renove all files and install Ubuntu\" when installing to wipe out Windows ME and install Ubuntu.\nHowever, if you want to dual-boot it might be difficult. Wubi doesn't support Windows ME now, and it makes sense for your copy not to support it.

I have used this same card reader with Linux Mint and Previous versions of Ubuntu. I have installed pcsc-tools,pcscd libccid, libnss3-tools, and coolkey. The driver for the card reader is included in libccid. \nWhen I run pcsc_scan the terminal returns the error, SCardEstablishContext: Service not available. If I understand this correctly, the error is indicating that it can't contact the pcscddaemon/service. \nWhen I check service pcscd status it returns * pcscd is not running. If I try sudo service pcscd start, I get no error but the service doesn't start. I also tried the force-reload option, it returns * Restarting PCSC Lite resource manager pcscd [failed]\nFor what it's worth, the card reader and supporting software currently work under my Mint partition.  So far I haven't seen where  I'm missing anything under the Ubuntu install that is present under Mint.

The good news is I got it working. The bad news is, I'm not sure which step fixed it...\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed Coolkey\n\n*Installed CacKey (available at SourceForge.mil). Tested but still couldn't restart pcscd\n\n*Looked through the README.gz file and found a reference to libusb. I didn't have libusb in my /lib directory on Ubuntu but I did on Mint. So I sym-linked to the /lib/libusb on my Mint partition. (Yes, I realize that would not be an option for everyone, but it's what I did.) Still couldn't get pcscd to restart.\n\n*Removed and Re-installed pcscd. I was then able to contact the reader with pcsc_scan. Keep in mind I had already un-installed/re-installed pcscd before.\n\n*Added Security device in Firefox and pointed to /usr/lib/libcackey.so.

According to this news , there is an official fix for secure boot. Will Ubuntu adapt it?\nIf so, how long should it take? And does it allow booting new computers from Wubi?\n\nA: No. \nUbuntu already supports secure boot, as mentioned in the real source of the news:\n\nDoes this mean Linux distributions can now support Secure Boot?\n  They've actually been able to for a while. Ubuntu shipped with Secure Boot support last October, and Fedora shipped with Secure Boot support in January. Both used Shim rather than the Linux Foundation loader, and Shim's also being used by a variety of smaller distributions. The LF loader is a different solution to the same problem.\n\nWubi doesn't work on UEFI systems because it uses grub4dos which doesn't support GPT  (GUID partition table) disks. This is unrelated to secure boot, other than the fact that Secure boot requires UEFI. That's the first problem.\nThe secure boot would be the second problem to solve since whatever solution provided would have to be signed to be useful (I would guess since I claim no expertise on this).\nThe third problem would be that someone should be working on it and - unless it's top secret - no information I have seen indicates that anyone is addressing the problem. The bug report has seen no change from Wishlist and remains Unassigned: https://bugs.launchpad.net/wubi/+bug/694242\n\nA: \nI knew ubuntu supports secure boot but this is the official fix.\n\nNot really. The Linux Foundation has released its fix in the form of the PreBootloader program. Ubuntu 12.10 and Fedora 18 both use another fix in the form of the shim program. (Fedora 18 uses a newer and more capable version of shim.) Neither solution has any more claim to being \"official\" than the other, except in the sense that certain organizations might support one solution or the other. In that sense, shim is \"more official\" than PreBootloader for Ubuntu, since shim is included in Ubuntu. FWIW, Matthew Garrett, the author of shim, has written this blog post that compares and contrasts the two programs. He says he's working on integrating the PreBootloader approach into shim, effectively combining the two programs into one.\nIn addition to the issues with GPT that bcbc has identified, a more fundamental problem with WUBI is that it doesn't support EFI-mode booting. To work on an EFI-based installation of Windows, WUBI would need to support an EFI-mode boot loader. Patching grub4dos to support GPT would be insufficient to this task. The LF PreBootloader also does nothing to help, since it requires the use of an EFI boot loader to follow itself -- hence the name *Pre*Bootloader.\n", "Q: How can I put games on a USB stick for a LAN party?

Everything works fine but the graphic driver is listed as unknown. In the Nvidia app, Nvidia server settings it's says the correct version.. the desktop seems to be running in 3D, not sure how to verify that but the experience is set to \"standard\"\nWhat should I do here for Ubuntu to list the correct driver?\n\nA: Updating the system will solve this issue. I would recommend activating the Proposed repositories in case you have not yet done so, but after upgrading 12.10 that minor bug should be fixed. Is not an error, nor does it mean you are not using the drivers correctly.\nThe bug is simply that the Window, in that line stops mentioning the correct video card. This does not affect the performance, 3D effects or anything else graphics related if that is what is making you doubt.\nHere is 12.10 after upgrading and using the 313 drivers as you are doing right now:\n\nAnd this one  \n\nAlso in the Software Sources I have all updates active:\n\nSo with that in mind, do an update and done. Even if you still see that text not showing the video card, it is just that, a text that is not showing the video card. The video card will still work fine (I know it scares me when I did not see it detected there the first time).\nUPDATE - Just did an awesome check with Synaptic and Aptitude to find what did I do apart from the mentioned stuff above. The only thing I found that involved video cards was installing the mesa utils because I normally tend to use the glx commands to check stuff out and to run the sudo nvidia-xconfig command to create the xorg.conf file only if I got an Nvidia missing configuration file bug. Maybe you can give it a go:\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils \nand restart the session or reboot. Apart from this, we would end with the same configuration for everything.\n", "Q: Why does Unity depend on Gnome In the light of some similar questions I have received, I took the liberty of creating a simple question that addresses this which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does Unity depend on Gnome and to what point is the dependency required?\n\n*Why is a specific version of Gnome used for a specific Version of Ubuntu (Let's say Gnome 3.6 for Ubuntu 12.10)\n\n*What changes is Unity doing in regards of being less dependent of Gnome\n\n*Has the dependency on Gnome created limitations with Unity?\n\nA: Why does Unity depend on Gnome and to what point is the dependency required?\nUnity is not an entire graphical desktop.  It is only one small part of it - the desktop shell.  It is one of the most visible parts of an operating system, particularly when you are interacting with the controls it provides or launching applications.\nIn order to use a graphical desktop you need to have a solid suite of software which comprises everything from a window manager and display manager, to widget toolkits, to file managers, and countless GUI applets for configuring and controlling everything from networking to which application should open which types of files.  You also need a suite of actual applications such as browsers, picture viewers, video players, and more.\nUnity could have been written as a shell for any existing desktop suite.  Gnome was chosen because it is relatively full-featured and had already been the default desktop environment for Ubuntu for many years prior.  Thus, with the exception of what Unity provides (which has a very visible immediate difference), the vast majority of your graphical desktop works the same way you were used to from previous versions of Ubuntu, if you stayed with the default Gnome.\nUnity is actually implemented as an extension to Compiz, which is not part of Gnome at all.  Compiz is a 3D-accelerated window manager that is designed as an alternative to Gnome 2's metacity and Gnome 3's mutter, though it can be made to work with KDE as well (even though KDE now includes Compiz-like functionality in its own window manager).  Ubuntu have chosen to work Unity and Compiz into the Gnome desktop environment, rather than KDE, for the reasons stated above.  Some development effort would be required to make it work in KDE, even though Compiz itself can be made to work with KDE.  The version of Compiz that is installed by Ubuntu makes use of a number of other Gnome-specific extensions in additional to Unity.\nWhy is a specific version of Gnome used for a specific Version of Ubuntu\nThis is just how most Linux distributions work - for a given release of the operating system, all their core software tends to stay at the same version throughout the life of that release, but a new release of the operating  system will typically get newer versions of software.\nThe version of Gnome that ends up in each Ubuntu release will usually just be the latest version of Gnome that is \"ready\" (no major problems) at the time that Ubuntu is getting ready for release, given enough time for testing beforehand.\nWhat changes is Unity doing in regards of being less dependent of Gnome\nThere's no reason to make Unity less dependent on Gnome, so I don't think there's anybody seriously working on that.  If Ubuntu needed to drop Gnome for any reason (which I don't see happening) they'd probably also switch away from Unity, too.\nHas the dependency on Gnome created limitations with Unity?\nI'm sure that it has influenced Unity's technical decisions along the way, but it will also have granted Unity great freedoms as well, because it is a mature and full-featured desktop environment.  Ubuntu are in no position, and would have no desire, to replace Gnome by building a new desktop environment from scratch.\n", "Q: Grub loads after rEFInd I have a dual-boot UEFI laptop, with Ubuntu and Windows. I installed rEFInd to boot to these systems, and it worked fine, but my linux system was triplicated. I supposed it was because of rEFInd searching for any vmlinuz and all these, so I added the line scan_all_linux_kernels 0 into refind.conf.\nAfter this, the extra booting options disappeared, but when I select Ubuntu, I get the GRUB menu to select it again.\nI want to disable GRUB, so that the system boots from rEFInd. I have tried to apt-get remove all grub and grub2 packages, but GRUB still appears.\n\nA: I seem to have solved it, although I don't understand why.\nI have reinstalled grub, but telling it NOT to generate menu.lst\nI have renamed /boot/grub/to /boot/grub_back/, which has broken the boot. From a live USB boot, I have renamed it back to original and, after this, GRUB doesn't start any more after rEFInd.\nProblem solved, but in a strange way.\n\nA: Your GRUB is still starting; it's just that it's not presenting a menu any more. A cleaner solution is to change scan_all_linux_kernels 0 back to scan_all_linux_kernels in refind.conf, uninstall GRUB via dpkg or apt-get, and then trim any duplicate entries in the rEFInd menu in a more targeted way. I can't be more precise about this last point without knowing precisely what the existing options are, though. Also, be aware that in some configurations, you should have multiple Linux options in rEFInd, since each one boots a different kernel. This is equivalent to having multiple Linux entries in GRUB, each of which boots a different kernel.\n", "Q: How to set netbeans 7.2 as my default PHP IDE on ubuntu 12.10 I'm using Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit ...

The \".*-chrome*\" part says to apply these scroll wheel speed increase changes ONLY to chrome.\nRun imwheel -b \"4 5\" to test your settings. When done testing, run killall imwheel to kill it, then make your edits to .imwheelrc, as desired, and run imwheel -b \"4 5\" again for more testing. Be sure to fully close and re-open Chrome each time you restart imwheel too, to ensure its new settings take effect. This must be done by right-clicking the little Chrome icon in the top-right of your desktop pane and going to \"Exit\".\nAlso keep in mind that if you are using a cheap mouse, your scroll wheel decoder may be lousy and miss encoder counts when moving the wheel fast. Therefore, in such a case, move the wheel at a reduced speed when testing the effect of imwheel, so that your mouse doesn't miss encoder counts on the scroll wheel, making you think imwheel isn't working right when it's really just your cheap hardware's problem.\nAdd imwheel -b \"4 5\" to Ubuntu's \"Startup Applications\" to get it to run every time the computer starts.\nAs Steven C. Howell says here:\n\nNote that using the option -b \"4 5\" restricts imwheel to only affect the scroll wheel, discussed here.\n\nAnother answer by \"tvn\" here: https://askubuntu.com/a/304653/327339.\nMore answers here: Increase mouse wheel scroll speed.\nReference notes:\nI am not the original author of the answers linked-to above, rather, user \"tvn\" and others are, although tvn's answer is lacking in that it replaces mouse scroll wheel movements with multiple arrow-key Arrow Up and Arrow Down key presses, which means you have to click in a window for it to take effect, and some things like the browser-based Jupyter Notebook Python programming environment scroll horribly like this! Therefore, Steven C. Howell gave an improved answer which keeps the scroll wheel mapping to the scroll wheel, instead of to keyboard up and down keys, but his answer is lacking in that it applies this new scroll wheel scaling to everything on your computer, so I just modified this answer 27 Aug. 2018 to reflect Steven Howell's answer, but with the addition of adding \".*-chrome*\" to the top of the ~/.imwheelrc file so that these new scroll setting apply only to your Chrome browser, which is really what I want. Note also, I have made several significant and important edits and contributions to tvn's answer linked to above, but now I think this answer here is much better, and it's deviated too much from tvn's answer to even attempt to edit his answer further.\nTested in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nUpdate 3 Mar. 2019: tested in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS as well, and it seems the effect takes place immediately in Chrome now each time you run killall imwheel and then imwheel -b \"4 5\" to test new settings.\nHelp, my touchpad/trackpad is glitchy when scrolling!\n\n*\n\n*This section added 22 June 2019:\n\nDepending on your computer and hardware, the above settings may work best with a mouse with a scroll wheel. On a track pad (again, this may or may not apply to you or your computer) it may make the result very glitchy when trying to do two-finger scrolling on the touch pad. I have a shortcut key (Ctrl + Alt + P) set up to run a script which enables/disables my track pad so I don't bump it while typing and using a mouse, yet so I can still easily enable it for when I don't have a mouse and/or someone else who loves touch pads wants to use my computer. To fix the glitchy scrolling caused by imwheel when using the touchpad, I've just added the following to my script:\nWhen the touchpad is disabled, enable imwheel so my mouse scroll wheel will work well:\nimwheel -b \"4 5\"\n\nWhen the touchpad is enabled, disable imwheel so my touchpad two-finger scrolling will work well and not be glitchy:\nkillall imwheel\n\nDoing the above is especially important for my HP Spectre x360 Ultrabook (Model 13-4193nr, and running Ubuntu 18.04), which otherwise has horribly glitchy two-finger touchpad scrolling when imwheel is enabled.\nHere is my full touchpad toggle script with those 2 imwheel lines added as described just above:\nFile \"~/bin/toggle_touchpad\":\n(I keep the latest version updated here: eRCaGuy_dotfiles/.../touchpad_toggle.sh).\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# GS_toggle_touchpad.sh\n# - toggle the touchpad on and off\n\n# Gabriel Staples\n# Written: 2 Apr. 2018 \n# Updated: 12 Sept. 2019 \n\n# References:\n# - https://askubuntu.com/a/874865/327339\n# - https://askubuntu.com/questions/844151/enable-disable-touchpad/1109515#1109515\n\n# Search for id number of \"TouchPad\" OR \"Touchpad\" in `xinput` list; manually type `xinput` to see all your devices\nread TouchPadDeviceId <<< $( xinput | sed -nre '/TouchPad|Touchpad/s/.*id=([0-9]*).*/\\1/p' ) \n\nstate=$( xinput list-props \"$TouchPadDeviceId\" | grep \"Device Enabled\" | grep -o \"[01]$\" )\n\necho \"TouchPadDeviceId = $TouchPadDeviceId\"\necho \"state = $state\"\n\nif [ \"$state\" -eq '1' ];then\n    xinput --disable \"$TouchPadDeviceId\"\n    zenity --info --text \"Touchpad DISABLED\" --timeout=2\n    imwheel -b \"4 5\"\nelse\n    xinput --enable \"$TouchPadDeviceId\"\n    zenity --info --text \"Touchpad ENABLED\" --timeout=2\n    killall imwheel\nfi\n\nTouchpad toggle script source: Enable/disable touchpad\nNow just run toggle_touchpad from the command line, or associate it with a keyboard shortcut like Ctrl + Alt + P like I have.\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*Get the latest version of this script from my repo here! eRCaGuy_dotfiles...touchpad_toggle.sh\n\n*Enable/disable touchpad\n\n*For new entries to fix scroll speed for Slack and Sublime Text 3 as well, see my latest ~/.imwheelrc file in my project here, and see also my new answer here answer: How do I change the mouse wheel scroll speed in Sublime Text 3?.\n\n*My answer on disabling the trackpad in Ubuntu 22.04: How to enable/disable the touchpad in Ubuntu 22.04 from the command-line\nKnown bugs/issues:\n\n*\n\n*[AMAZON PLEASE FIX THIS!] Amazon designed their website with your discomfort in mind, and their website is extremely slow and glitchy when using the above fix.

I just got a new netbook and I'm setting up operating system configuration. It came with windows 7 starter but I installed dual boot Ubuntu 12.10. I've been writing on some forums and now I don't want things from previous searches and stuff popping up in public so I'm considering a disc wipe and reinstallation of Ubuntu.\nUbuntu was installed by downloading an iso from inside Windows, then put on an usb drive and rebooted and installed alongside windows. I did not do any fancy configuration about swap spaces or partitions. When I start, I get to choose if I want to boot up as Windows or Ubuntu. It automatically chooses Ubuntu. Also, I would like to change this so that it chooses Windows by default.\nMy question is, is it possible to reinstall Ubuntu without having to reinstall Windows 7?\nI'm not interested in a wiping of free disc space or any goverment-level confidentiality. I just want my Ubuntu partition cleared, from occasionaly peeping curious eyes, not having previously visited websites or previously written documents popping up accidentally. If I remove Ubuntu from my hard drive, and then install it again, will a lot of the stuff still be there? I really would like not to format my hard drive because I have stuff on the windows part of the system that I use.\n\nA: The short answer is Yes, you can re-install Ubuntu without having to re-install Windows 7. You might be able to apply this answerto your situation:\nHow to install Ubuntu, remove Mint and set up a separate home partition?\nYou should be able to follow the same steps, but ignore the last part about the separate /home partition.\n\nA: Reinstalling Ubuntu has nothing to do with Windows 7. Just make the bootable USB again and reinstall Ubuntu on the same partition as before. If you choose to format the partition everything, including all files (under home) and settings and also installed application will be lost.\nBut I think it’s not necessory to reinstall Ubuntu in your situation. You can delete your history:\nFor deleting Firefox history, go to Edit -> Preferences -> Privacy and click on clear your recent history and you can choose Never remember the history.

I've mounted the ISO file using a virtual drive application. When I open the virtual drive with the Ubuntu ISO mounted, I only have the option of restarting to be able to do anything. However, I couldn't boot from the ISO after restarting.\nIs it possible to boot from a mounted ISO file from the first place? Or do I have to burn the image and boot from the physical CD?\n\nA: When you mount an ISO image as a virtual disk, this happens at the OS level. Not at the hardware level. When your running operating system stops, the virtual device goes away. So no, it is not possible to boot a physical machine from a virtual drive.\nWhether or not you need to create physical installation media depends on how you want to install Ubuntu:\nIf you want Ubuntu installed separately from Windows--either alongside it or replacing it--then you need to create real physical installation media. You can burn the ISO image to a DVD (or to a CD, if you're installing Ubuntu 12.04 or earlier). Or you can write it to a USB flash drive.\nIf you want to install Ubuntu inside Windows with Wubi (so that it is contained within the pre-existing Windows partition and booted using the Windows boot loader), then you do not need to create physical installation media:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have mounted the ISO image as a virtual disk, just run wubi.exe on the virtual disk. This will install a Wubi Ubuntu system.\n\n*Alternatively, just put wubi.exe (you can download it here) in the same folder as the ISO image, preferably with no other files. Make sure you use the right version of wubi.exe--it must be for the same version of Ubuntu as the ISO image itself. Then just run wubi.exe, and it will automatically detect and use the contents of the ISO image.\n\n\nIf you are doing one of these things and it is not working, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the integrity of the ISO image you downloaded.\n\n*If what you're doing involves physical installation media (a CD/DVD or a USB flash drive), make sure you're creating it properly, if it's a CD/DVD try burning it at the slowest possible speed, and whether it's CD/DVD/USB, if you can even begin to boot from it, then check the installation media itself for defects (see also this video).\n\n\nA: When you mount a ISO image in Windows using a virtual drive, the image will be available only from within Windows - so, you cannot access it right after restart, before Windows loads.\nYou need to burn the DVD and boot from it, or to create an USB stick with Ubuntu and boot your computer from that USB stick. Or you can use a Windows installer, which is probably what you want - see instructions here.\n\nA: No, you cannot boot from a mounted ISO file. The ISO file is unmounted when the computer reboots.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on a Chromebook 3? I read that it's possible to install Ubuntu on a Samsung Chromebook, but I have a Samsung Chromebook 3 model code xe303c12-a01uk.\nCould you please tell me where I can get the Ubuntu installation details for this model?\nIf I install Ubuntu is this going to make my life easier?\n\nA: The Samsung varient of the chromebook uses the arm architecture rather than the x86 architecture everyone else uses. The standard ubuntu builds you can download off the ubuntu site is unlikely to be used. There is a port to that system called ChrUbuntu that apparently has partital support at the moment.\nInstructions cribbed from the link, with appropriate additional information and warnings posted. I've not tried it myself, so do at your own risk.\nFirstly, going into developer mode will wipe anything on the chromebook, unless its backed up to the cloud. You probably don't but its worth noting. You can do so by pressing  as per google's instructions - enter recovery mode by you holding down the ESC and Refresh keys and poke the Power button.\nConfigure wifi but don't log in, and open up a terminal with ctrl + alt + ←\nLogin as chronos with no password.\nrun wget http://cr-48-ubuntu.googlecode.com/files/arm-chrubuntu-3.sh; sudo bash arm-chrubuntu-3.sh - this runs a script that walks you through partitioning your drive, and installing ubuntu. It will ask you to set a size for ubuntu and reboot. You will have to configure wifi, open the terminal and run the script again. It'll download a bunch of files then reboot into ubuntu. \nYou can login using the username and password user, then do what you need to do. As it, chromeos will be the default, you can switch to having ubuntu as the default with sudo cgpt add -i 6 -P 5 -S 1 /dev/mmcblk0 and switch it back with \nsudo cgpt add -i 6 -P 0 -S 1 /dev/mmcblk0\n", "Q: How do I find out what credentials I need to run a command? Whenever I go to use my computer I always get the message \"Your computer is running in low graphics mode\".\nPeople have directed me to the terminal to enter a command but I don't know what my credentials are.\n\nA: Open a terminal, enter the command :\nsudo <command>\n\nYou will be asked for a password, it is the same as your log in password. You will not see anything in the terminal as you type your password. That  is normal behavior, just enter your password and hit enter.\n\nA: In Linux (and Unix in general), there is a SuperUser named Root. The SuperUser can do anything and everything, and thus doing daily work as the SuperUser can be dangerous. You could type a command incorrectly and destroy the system. Ideally, you run as a user that has only the privileges needed for the task at hand. In some cases, this is necessarily Root, but most of the time it is a regular user.\nBy default, the root account password is locked in Ubuntu.  \nThere are also administrator users and normal users\nThe first account you set up is an administrator user, Subsequent users are not if you need to give another user administrator privileges run the the following command in a terminal\n    sudo adduser <username> sudo\n\nwhere you replace username with the name of the user (without the <>). \nThe root user can run any command without question, which is part of the reason the account is locked by default.  Administrators can also run any command but need to ask for special privileges to run restricted commands,  normal users can not run restricted commands at all.\nAs an administrator you can run GUI programs such as nautilus (default file manager) with super user powers by pressing ALT+F2 and typing gksu nautilus for other programs replace nautilus with the name of the program you want.\nFor command line programs the syntax is slightly different.  To run a command as a super user type\n    sudo command\n\nreplace command with the command you want for example fdisk -l does nothing because it's a restricted command but sudo fdisk -l lists all the drives your computer can see.\nFor both sudo and gksu you will be asked to enter your password.\nTo find out what credentials you have enter whoami to get your user name; if it does not say root you are not root.  Next enter id this lists what groups you belong to if sudo is listed you are an administrator, otherwise you are a normal user \nThere is more information here \n", "Q: Can I set up LIRC to enable me to navigate the Unity Launcher, using my MCE Remote Control, and how would I do this? I have MythTV front-end, XBMC and Steam Linux installed and running fine on my Ubuntu 12.04 HTPC and would like to be able to control the machine by IR Remote Control, without having to plug in a keyboard or use another entry device every time I boot up, just to be able to launch my apps.\nI set up lirc for my MCE Remote Control, using the Mythbuntu Control Panel and tested it successfully with irw. It works fine within the applications mentioned, but I need to be able to use it to launch these applications, too.\nI have searched around for a solution and come up with very little which helps. Even the suggestions on LIRC's homepage (http://www.lirc.org/software.html) are out of date, poorly maintained and/or would not install.\nI think that these sort of common input methods should be able to be used 'out of the box' with the new Unity interface, so it surprises me that the Launcher isn't compatible.\nAnyway, does anybody have any idea how to make this work, or have any other solution to my problem?\nThanks,\nRich.\n\nA: I found this lifehacker article on LIRC.  It suggests that you install the lirc-x package.  If you do that, and then modify your .lircrc file as I am about to show, and then run the irxevent program (from a terminal window or as part of startup — note that you can use irxevent -d to fork and run it in the background) you can then navigate the Unity launcher.  But there is a downside - when irxevent is running and then you go into a program that knows how to operate with LIRC (such as XBMC), what happens is that your remote keys are received by both programs, and both try to act on them, with semi-predictable results.  I haven't figured out a way around that yet.\nHere is what I added to my .lircrc file:\nbegin\n prog = irxevent\n button = KEY_UP\n repeat = 0\n config = Key Up CurrentWindow\nend\n\nbegin\n prog = irxevent\n button = KEY_DOWN\n repeat = 0\n config = Key Down CurrentWindow\n    end\n\nbegin\n prog = irxevent\n button = KEY_LEFT\n repeat = 0\n config = Key Left CurrentWindow\nend\n\nbegin\n prog = irxevent\n button = KEY_RIGHT\n repeat = 0\n config = Key Right CurrentWindow\nend\n\nbegin\n prog = irxevent\n button = KEY_PLAY\n config = Key Return CurrentWindow\n repeat = 0\nend\n\nbegin\n prog = irxevent\n button = KEY_OK\n config = Key Return CurrentWindow\n repeat = 0\nend\n\nThis is just a demonstration that only defines six buttons on the remote (the arrow keys, OK and Play, the latter two both sending the equivalent of the Return/Enter key on the keyboard.  It is enough to do basic navigation of the launcher.  Now if there was only some way to kill irxevent when a program that is LIRC compatible is running, and restart it when you have exited all such programs, without putting too much load on system resources, this would work great!\nNOTE: There is a documentation page on irxevent here.  By looking at that I was finally able to deduce that if you replace CurrentWindow with unity-2d-shell, then it will only work on the Launcher.  But the problem with that is that it brings the Launcher to the foreground (sometimes), even if you are inside another program.  There is supposed to be a way to use a \"Focus\" option, so the keypresses will only work if the target program has focus.  But besides the obvious issue of \"how do you give focus to Launcher in the first place after exiting another program?\", the other problem is that using Focus in the manner shown in the documentation, for example...\nbegin\n prog = irxevent\n button = KEY_UP\n repeat = 0\n config = Key Up Focus unity-2d-shell\nend\n\n...seems to kill the operation of irxevent altogether - it won't respond to button presses at all.  Remove the word \"Focus\" and it works fine again, but interferes with other software.\nThe only way I can see that might make this work is to have a way to kill irxevent when any software on an \"exclusion list\" is running, and restart it if none of that software is running.  But I don't know how to do that, and I would hope there is a more elegant solution.\n\nA: I found this article and worked the problem quite a while, and finally got it working, sort of.  You can see what I did in the first two posts in this thread on Ubuntu Forums.  I hope someone can develop this a bit further.\n", "Q: Creating A Shortcut to Open Terminal & Run A Command everyone. I'm new to Ubuntu Gnome, and I just wanted to know if it's possible to create a shortcut such as CTRL+1, and have the terminal popup and run a command such as 'sudo apt-get upgrade'.\nIs this possible, and if so how can it be done?\nThank you!\n\nA: Yes, this can be done.  \nInstall xbindkeys:  \nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys  \n\nAnd create the config file:  \ntouch .xbindkeysrc \n\nAnd now edit the file:  \ngedit .xbindkeysrc\n\nAdd this to the file:  \n\"gnome-terminal -e 'sudo apt-get upgrade'\"\nControl+1\n\nSave the file.  \nNow you need to add xbindkeys to \"Startup Application\".  That is addressed near the bottom of this answer on remapping keys. \nThe only problem with this solution is, if there aren't any prompts, the terminal will only stay open long enough to get your password and ask if you want to run the upgrade.

AutoKey is a keyboard macro processor that allows you to associate any key/modifier combination with a script that can do almost anything you can do from your keyboard and a lot more.\nAutoKey has a script recorder and a simple way to enter basic key sequences, but its scripts are written in Python and can do almost anything you can code.\nThe simplest way to use it is to have it send keystrokes to your applications/desktop.  When used this way, the system/applications cannot tell that it's not you typing, so there is no API or other interface needed, they just do what \"you\" typed.\nAutoKey can also process phrases. When you type a triggering character string, it can substitute new text for that string (either immediately or after you type a separator character like a newline or tab.)\nIt also has window filters so that you can restrict a particular phrase or script to only run in particular types of windows (like ones that have Mozilla in the title so they work only in things like Firefox or Thunderbird).\nAutoKey currently has Gtk and Qt versions.\nEdits:\nInstallation Guide\nUser Forum\nActive user forum.\nThere are a number of example scripts in the wiki. Because it's primarily a GUI app with a lot of options, examples would require a lot of screenshots and a whole article. \nI have a phrase defined so that when I type \"Jmail!\", it instantly replaces it with my rather long email address.\nI wrote a script that is triggered by typing Ctrl-P which is only active in windows that have \"Mozilla\" in their title.  Typing Ctrl-P brings up the (Firefox or Thunderbird) print dialog, selects Print to File and then fills in the name of the next available print file in my print queue (I number them 01, 02, ... and the script reads the queue directory, finds the last file number and increments it by 1).  I use it with my duplex printing emulation software (duplexpr) to eliminate a ton of keystrokes and mouse movements.\nI have seen some other scripts from gamers that let them access information about their character and resources very quickly so they can stay focused on the action.\n\nA: Using xkb\nxkb is the X Keyboard extension.

It uses a config file, my default located in your home directory, to change key bindings into certain commands.\nTo create a default config file you use the command:\nxbindkeys --defaults\n\nWhich prints the default config file.  So if you want to create the file containing the default values you would use:\nxbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc\n\nWhich prints the default values into a hidden file named .xbindkeysrc located in home (~).\nNow to actually change the bindings of keys we first need to know what the name or keysym of those keys is.  xbindkeys allows us to use the -k handle to find the name of a key or key combination.  Run:\nxbindkeys -k\n\nAnd press a key or key combination.  Your output will look something similar to this (when pressing space):\n\"NoCommand\"\nm:0x10 + c:65\nMod2 + space\n\n\"No Command\" tells us that currently no command is associated with the Space key.\nm:0x10 + c:65\nMod2 + space  \n\nIs the name of the key/key combination.\nthe config file..\nLets open up the config file you made earlier:\ngedit .xbindkeysrc  \n\nHere is an excerpt from the default config file:\n#\n# A list of keys is in /usr/include/X11/keysym.h and in\n# /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h\n# The XK_ is not needed.\n#\n# List of modifier:\n#   Release, Control, Shift, Mod1 (Alt), Mod2 (NumLock),\n#   Mod3 (CapsLock), Mod4, Mod5 (Scroll). \n#\n\n# The release modifier is not a standard X modifier, but you can  \n# use it if you want to catch release events instead of press events\n\n# By defaults, xbindkeys does not pay attention with the modifiers\n# NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock.\n# Uncomment the lines above if you want to pay attention to them.\n\n#keystate_numlock = enable\n#keystate_capslock = enable\n#keystate_scrolllock= enable\n\n# Examples of commands:\n\n\"xbindkeys_show\" \n control+shift + q  \n\nEvery line beginning with # is a comment and won't be read or run by xbindkeys.\nSo far the only line that isn't commented out is:\n\"xbindkeys_show\" \n control+shift + q  \n\nThis excerpt shows the basic syntax of xbindkeys commands:\n\"Command to run (in quotes)\"\nkey to associate with command (no quotes)  \n\nSo as you can see:\n\"xbindkeys_show\" \n control+shift + q  \n\nRuns the command xbindkeys_show when you press Ctrl+Shift+q.\nbind keys to commands..\nNow lets try binding a few keys.  I recommend clearing the entire default file so that it's blank.  It contains preset key bindings you probably don't want.\nNow lets say you want to use Ctrl+b to open your browser.  First you need to know what the name or keysym of Ctrl+b is.  As mentioned earlier you can use xbindkeys -k to find the name of a key or keys, but there is an easier way.  For simple combinations like Ctrl+b you can just use:\nControl+b\n\nA lot easier isn't it!\nNow find the command for your favorite browser:\n\n*\n\n*For Firefox: firefox\n\n\n*For Chromium: chromium-browser\n\n\n*For Opera:  opera\nRemember the syntax from earlier?  The xbindkeys command to launch Firefox (or your other favorite browser) when you press Ctrl+b is:\n\"firefox\"\nControl+b\n\nNow put that in your config file and save it.  Now you might notice your command doesn't work yet, that's because xbindkeys isn't running.  To start it just run xbindkeys from a terminal.  Your Ctrl+b should now start your browser!\nbind keys to other keys..\nIf you want a key on your keyboard to call a different key on your keyboard, you will need an extra piece of software as xbindkeys does not support this on it's own.  I know of two programs which we can use, xdotool and xte.  I prefer xte so I'm going to use that.\nInstall it:\nsudo apt-get install xautomation\n\nThe syntax for xte is like this:\nxte 'command key/mousebutton/xyCoordinates'\n\nExamples:\n\n*\n\n*To call a single key press:  xte 'key keyName'\n\n\n*To call a key combination:  xte 'keydown keyName' 'keydown secondKeyName' 'keyup keyName' 'keyup secondKeyName\n\n\n*To call a mouse button:  xte 'mouseclick buttonNumber'  (We'll discuss finding button numbers a little latter)\n\n\n*To move the mouse:  xte 'mousemove xCoordinate yCoordinate'\n\n\n*And more! Read man xte\nNow that you know the command for simulating key presses you can call it from your xbindkeys script, like this:\n\"xte 'key b'\"\nControl+b  \n\nAs you might guess, this calls xte 'key b' when we press Ctrl+b, which would enter a b into any document you might be currently working on.\nI thing to note however is that xbindkeys and xte don't always work very well together.  Sometimes you have to press the keys exactly at the same time to get output, other times it works just fine.  This may or may not have to do with system configuration and/or hardware.. I'm not sure.  See maggotbrain's answer for a more reliable way of binding keys to other keys.\nbind mouse buttons to commands..\nYou can also use xbindkeys to bind mouse buttons to commands (and thence keyboard shortcuts, see above). The basic format for mouse buttons should be familiar to you now:\n\" [command to run]  \"\nb:n\n\nWhere [command to run] is the command you want to run and n the number of the mouse button you want to use for that command.\nIf you don't know the number of your mouse button you can use xev to find out what it is:\nxev | grep button\n\nThe output will be something like this:\nuser@host:~$ xev | grep button\n    state 0x10, button 1, same_screen YES\n    state 0x110, button 1, same_screen YES\n    state 0x10, button 2, same_screen YES\n    state 0x210, button 2, same_screen YES\n    state 0x10, button 3, same_screen YES\n    state 0x410, button 3, same_screen YES\n\nWhen I press each of my mouse buttons.\nFor example:\n\" firefox \"\nb:2\n\nLaunches firefox when I press my middle mouse button.\n\nA: The shortcut already exist as WWW, just change it to Ctrl+Alt+b.  No need to create a new one.\n\n\nA: CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM)\nCCSM lets you change some system keyboard shortcuts.\nTo install it, use the Software Center, or this command:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nFor example\nI used it to change the \"Window spread\" shortcut from the default Super+W to Super+Tab, like on Windows 10. From my answer on another thread:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Run CCSM from the Dash.\n  \n*Go to Window management -> Scale -> Bindings tab ->     Initiate Window Picker\n  \n*Click the keyboard shortcut (<Super>w on your PC, but <Super>Tab in this screenshot).\n\n  \n*Click Grab key combination, press the desired key(s), then click OK.\n\n\n\nA: I wanted to press Print Screen to save a screen shot using the gnome-screenshot application, as in Mint\nBut I wanted to do it using terminal, not GUI, as I want to make it default while creating a custom ISO using squashfs tools.\nFirst I installed gnome-screenshot using command\nsudo apt-get install gnome-screenshot\n\nThen I assigned the custom shortcut using Settings -> Keyboard ->\n Custom shortcuts -> Add (+) button -> \nIn the dialog:\n\n\n*\n\n*Name : Screen shot\n\n*Command: gnome-screentshot\n\n\nPress Add Button\nThen press the Print screen key. \nKey is now bound, and I can save the screen shots as required.\nBut not using terminal, it's the GUI way\nThen I installed dconf-editor using\nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\nAnd search for gnome-screenshot\nI find my custom key bindings at this path \n/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/\n\nValues of keys are:\n\n\n*\n\n*binding 'Print'\n\n*command 'gnome-screenshot'\n\n*name 'print screen'\n\n\nNow I copy these and delete the GUI custom shortcut key\nI open terminal and type these commands\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/command \"'gnome-screenshot'\"\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/binding  \"'Print'\"\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/name \"'print screen'\"\n\nAnd voila \nNow I can save screen shots without any GUI only using dconf and terminal. I don't need dconf-editor any more either, it was just installed to get the values.\n\nA: I tried Kevin's solution (the xmodmap approach) on ubuntu 18.04. It didn't work in my case. Yet this procedure made it work finally:\n\n\n*\n\n*copy xmodmap .Xmodmap in a file called .xsession rather than .xinitrc. \n\n*change the permissions of the file (right-click, properties, permission tab, changing the permissions to \"read and write\" and ticking the box down the window) \n\n*add a startup application with /home/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/.xsession as command.\n\n", "Q: Where is \"txt.cfg\"?

Not sure what games you have that you are trying to download.

In there, look for a subfolder called chrome.\nIf it doesn't exist, create it.\nTo create the chrome folder you can use your file manager (or the command line with mkdir chrome).\nIf chrome does exist, look for a file called userContent.css. Otherwise, create an empty text file with this name in the chrome folder.\nNow open userContent.css with a text editor and paste in or append this code:\nINPUT, TEXTAREA {color: black !important; background: #aaaaaa !important; }\n\nSave the file (as plain text) and close the text editor.\nRestart Firefox.\nYou should now have black text on a light gray background.

I'd prefer using rdiff or rsync over ssh. Just ask, if you need further assistance on any step. This method allows you to place the backup target machine to internal network, so anyone hacking your site can not access your backups.\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup backup account on the www server, create the public + private ssh keys without a password for that account.

If it says it is signed then this means that it was signed with some private key so that it could be installed in EFI mode on an EFI system.\n", "Q: How to verify installed os type as minimal virtual machine Trying to install Ubuntu 10.04 as guest.\n\nPress F4 and choose Minimal Virtual Machine and then > selected Install Ubuntu Server\n\nNow is there a way to confirm that installed Machine is Minimal VM rather than other Normal/Minimal \nafter installing it is still showing kernel type as \n 2.6.32-38-generic-pae\n\n\nA:  cat /proc/modules |wc -l \n\nand compare modules, minimal vm have less modules than normal installation.\n", "Q: How can I connect to local server? I am newbie on Ubuntu.

I want to implement my own cloud and one of my friend told me that this can be done very easily on Ubuntu using Eucalyptus. Can anyone tell me how?\n\nA: According to Wikipedia, Eucalyptus is an infrastructure to provide cloud services with a computer cluster. That means that Eucalyptus is a quite large and complex system that is meant to be run on a cluster of several or many computers. An Eucalyptus installation is comprised of (at least) 5 or 6 different components, like a cluster controller, a storage controller, a node controller and so forth. It is recommended that each of this component is run on its own machine. \nFrom the impression I get of your plans, Eucalyptus might be way to large for what you want to do. You maybe want to look into ownCloud instead.\n", "Q: Customizing Ubuntu's splash screen and welcome text I've created my own customized version of Ubuntu 12.04 using ubuntu-builder, but now I would like to get rid of the default splash screen and the welcome text related to Ubuntu that appear during the boot process and change it to my own customized welcome screen. Is this possible?\n\nA: Why not. Look in the directory /usr/share/images/ there would be directory containing images of different resolution. Replace those images with your custom images. Make sure to place your image in all resolution given there, and you are done.  You can even customize logo and welcome message with your quotes or any thing you like.

I have Windows installed on one SSD. The SATA cable is currently unplugged because I'm about to install two Linux distros on another SSD, those being Linux Mint 14 and BackTrack 5. \nNow, I used GParted to create the following partitions on the sda SSD:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 with Ext4 file system for Linux Mint\n\n*sda2 with Swap for Linux Mint\n\n*sda3 with Ext4 file system for BackTrack 5\n\n*sda4 with Swap for BackTrack 5\n\n*sda5 with Ext4 file system for /Home (to share file among distros)\n\n\nNow, I'm in the process of installing Linux Mint. It's asking me where I want to install GRUB. Ideally, I want to switch my BIOS to boot from the hard drive where my Linux distros are on, because I've read that GRUB will see Windows and add it to its menu. This seems to be the easiest method of triple booting (2 Linux, 1 Windows). \nHowever, do I install GRUB on the sda hard drive? I placed a boot flag on the sda1 partition, so should I install it there instead?\nsda hard drive?\nsda1 partition?\n\nA: I have a similar setup,\nsda for Windows,\nsdb1 with /boot of first distro and boot flag\nsdb2 with /boot of 2nd distro\nsdb6 and sdb6 for the distros.\nWhat I did is install GRUB on the sdb drive and make my bios boot from that drive first.\nI also had installs with GRUB in the MBR and on both occasions windows was available. \nhowever I am installing 2 distros and I have the problem that GRUB does only see 1 distro and windows, depending on from which install I install GRUB\nmaybe a shared boot partition would solve this problem.\n\nA: Boot flag has nothing to do with booting and grub. It is used by Windows to know which partition you boot from with Windows. A few BIOS need a boot flag on a primary partition, so we still suggest one, but which partition does not matter.\nDo not share /home. You likely will get configuration conflicts. But you can share all your data in a shared data partition.\nKeep grub from the install you use the most in the MBR to boot. You will have to update each grub when you get updates with sudo update-grub so the boot version of grub has the latest info. os-prober usually looks at the other grub.cfg file to find its entries.\nMore advanced but better when you get multiple installs is to use 40_custom and manually create your own boot stanza to boot a partition not the specific kernel.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MaintenanceFreeCustomGrub2Screen\n", "Q: Starting DesktopCouch or CouchDb on Lubuntu 12.10 I have installed DesktopCouch on my Lubuntu 12.10 using apt-get\nsudo apt-get install desktopcouch\n\nInstallation was ok, but when I try to start it with command couchdb, I get the following error:\n{\"init terminating in do_boot\",{{badmatch,{error,{bad_return,{{couch_app,start,\n[normal,[\"/etc/couchdb/default.ini\",\"/etc/couchdb/local.ini\"]]},{'EXIT',{{badmatch,\n{error,{error,enoent}}},[{couch_server_sup,start_server,1,   \n[{file,\"couch_server_sup.erl\"},{line,56}]},{application_master,start_it_old,4,\n[{file,\"application_master.erl\"},{line,274}]}]}}}}}},[{couch,start,0\n[{file,\"couch.erl\"},{line,18}]},{init,start_it,1,[]},{init,start_em,1,[]}]}}\n\nCrash dump was written to: erl_crash.dump\ninit terminating in do_boot ()\n\nLine-breaks added to the JSON for better readability\nI have checked file /etc/couchdb/default.ini and I have created folder for data mentioned there (it was /var/lib/couchdb/1.2.0/) and assigned the 777 access rights to it.

Do you know what the problem might be?\n\nA: Don't install or use desktopcouch. It is no longer maintained or supported. See the EOL announcement for desktopcouch. Also, couchdb will soon be completely disabled on the Ubuntu One servers, as announced recently. It's not stated in that announcement, but notes sync was the last remaining service backed by couchdb on the server. Once it's down, there will be no more couch access on Ubuntu One (syncing with which was the sole reason for desktopcouch). The desktopcouch package has been removed from the archive completely in 13.04.\n", "Q: Annoying autorenaming in Guake I love Guake drop-down terminal, but it has an annoying issue. When I use many tabs, I hate when the tab names rename each time I execute a command or navigate in one of them. I want to rename any tab and maintain the name in all sessions. For instance, when I use Midnight Commander and I enter in a long path folder, the tab expands and it's horrible. I see tab name mc [user@machine_name]:/weird/long/infinite/path when I navigate to /weird/long/infinite/path folder.\nCan I have always the same name for each tab, even when renaming it manually?\n\nA: I have found a way to disable the annoying renaming. I found in my guake Python script (in version 0.4.3-3) in lines 996 to 1002:\ndef on_terminal_title_changed(self, vte, box):\n    use_them = self.client.get_bool(KEY(\"/general/use_vte_titles\"))\n    if not use_them:\n        return\n    page = self.notebook.page_num(box)\n    self.tabs.get_children()[page].set_label(vte.get_window_title())\n\nAs the script shows, /general/use_vte_titles key prevents the autorenaming feature. It is Guake uses GConf to configure his options (explanation). I had to install gconf-editor package to edit Guake options executing sudo apt-get install gconf-editor. Then I executed gconf-editor, I browsed to /apps/guake/general and unmarked use_vte_titles key. Closed the editor. Next time I executed Guake the autorenaming feature was disabled.\nNow, all the tabs are named Terminal and if I rename one, it still named all the session with the same name.\nIt would be helpful to add this key into the Guake preferences dialogue. But this solution worked anyway.\n\nA: On the command line:\nvim ~/.gconf/apps/guake/general/%gconf.xml\nThere should be an entry something like this:\n<entry name=\"use_vte_titles\" mtime=\"1404143215\" type=\"bool\" value=\"true\"/>\n\nJust change it to:\n<entry name=\"use_vte_titles\" mtime=\"1404143215\" type=\"bool\" value=\"false\"/>\n\nSave the file and restart guake.\n\nA: Consider simply shortening the terminal title. The algorithm is defined in .bashrc, the terminal title will be respected by Guake as you have noticed:\nMy .bashrc contains the following:\n# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir\ncase \"$TERM\" in\nxterm*|rxvt*)\n    PROMPT_COMMAND='PS1X=$(pwd | sed -r \"s-^$HOME/--;s-^$HOME-~-;s-^(.[^/]*)/.*/-\\1/.../-\")'\n    PS1=\"\\[\\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\"'$PS1X'\"\\a\\]$PS1\"\n    ;;\n*)\n    ;;\nesac\n\nThe host name is not shown anymore, and only the first and the last path component is shown:\n$HOME -> ~\n$HOME/some/deep/sub/dir -> some/.../dir\n/usr/local/deeply/inside/there -> /usr/.../there\nWith this setting, the tab buttons are narrow enough but still contain useful information.\nSee also:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/q/3497885/946850\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/q/26844/19205\n\nA: just run\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/guake/general/use_vte_titles --type boolean false\n\nand restart your terminal,\neasy as pie(3.14)\n\nA: Yeah I had this issue as well and I am so surprised that it still appears in recent Guake versions. In the latest version I think there is an option to name the terminals as Terminal 1, Terminal 2 etc which doesn't help much either.\nIn the past few years I have employed a simple script in my .zshrc (I use Zsh terminal, but you can apply something similar in Bash).\nfunction chpwd {\n if [ -e \".guakerc\" ]; then\n   setupguake\n else\n    guake -r ${PWD##*/}\n fi\n}\n\nfunction setupguake() {\n  . $(pwd)/.guakerc\n\n  if ((${+name})); then\n    guake -r ${name}\n  fi\n}\n\nEssentially what this does, it monitors any directory change (through chpwd) and if a .guakerc file is found it runs it. Inside that file you can setup the guake title and many other things.\nIf no .guakerc file is found (the most usual case), it just sets the folder name as the terminal name. So if you are in a folder named /home/username/Development/social-app it will rename the terminal as social-app.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: How to access the NTFS partition where I've installed BOOT-LOADER of ubuntu 9.04?

How can I do this?\nThanks in advance.\nDanny\nEDIT:\nI forgot to mention that the home directories are encrypted.\n\nA: I'm not sure what have you tried so far, so I'll try to explain a bit.\nIf you just want to move the files from one home directory to another, you could run\nmv /path/to/old/hdd/home/$USER/stuff ~\n\nwhich will copy your files. If you prefer not doing it via the command line, you could try nautilus (the file browser that opens when you open \"Home\" in Gnome).\nIf you don't know how to find your old partition, you should first of all mount it (which you can do easily from Nautilus), then navigate to home/username in the old hdd, where username is your username.\nNow it might happen that when you copy the files, their ownership remains, which might bother you. Normally when you copy files to your home directory, they will change ownership and become \"yours\". If this is not the case, you could just create a target folder and chmod it to force all its content to inherit ownership:\nmkdir target\nchmod 2775 target\n\n…and then copy files to the \"target\" directory.\nOr, you could just chown $USER copied-files -R to gain ownership of the copied files.\nUPDATE: If your home directory was encrypted, try the procedure described in this thread:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Swapped hard disks between the two laptops\n  \n*Installed new system\n  \n*Created a user with the same username and password\n  \n*On completion I booted to recovery mode, set the old /home partition in fstab and moved the /var/lib/ecryptfs/ directory from the\n  old system to the new (so to have the same old keys) (backup is\n  advised of course)\n  \n*Booted the new system and everything worked like before\n  \n\nIf you did not have /home on a separate partition, you could just\n\n\n*\n\n*log out with your user on the new system\n\n*move your old home directory out of the way (using root)\n\n*copy the old home directory from the old HDD to the new one\n\n*log in with the user that has the same username and password (useradd it if it does not exist, or passwd your password temporarily back to what it was on the old system)\n\n*copy the files to some other folder that does not get encrypted (i.e. out of your home dir)\n\n*logout again\n\n*swap back to your new home directory (again with root)\n\n*move the files from the temporary place to your new home directory\n\n\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Plans to automatically support existing GPT partitions during installation? I have a desktop with a 2TB HD (Used for data) and a 120GB SSD currently used for Windows.

Only thing you need is a static backup path, in my case it's /media/filip/red/backup.\ndconf write /org/gnome/deja-dup/backend \"'local'\"\ndconf write /org/gnome/deja-dup/local/folder \"'/media/filip/red/backup'\"\n\nThe volume (here /media/filip/red) is LUKS-encrypted volume mounted from USB stick. But on my Ubuntu (20.04) deja-dup does not detect this LUKS drive when running from cron, for some reason.\n", "Q: Redirecting /dev/null to some other device Is it possible to redirect, ie create /dev/null as non-null device, like /dev/console or /dev/stdout? This obviously has to be done before init runs create creates a standard /dev/null. Upstart seems to dislike simple symlink to /dev/stdout.\n\nA: \nWikipedia\n/dev/null or the null device is a special file that discards all data written to it (but reports that the write operation succeeded) and provides no data to any process that reads from it\n\nThe answer is no: redirecting from /dev/null is impossible since, after /dev/null is done there is nothing left to redirect. You need to alter the program you want to see the messages from to echo these results to a log file before a /dev/null comes into play.\n", "Q: Is there a way to echo an alias? I have set some aliases in my .bashrc file and for some reason one of them does not behave as expected.\nSince I don't remember the exact command assigned to that alias, I would like to see the command to find out what's wrong.\nExcept the obvious opening the .bashrc file to see it, is there a command that just echos the command assigned to that alias?\n\nA: Instead of using grep, you can just type alias aliasname to see what an alias is set to.\nFor example, alias ls will return ls='ls --color=auto'.\nAlso take a look at the type and whence commands, which return more detailed information about utilities, including executable files in your path, shell built-ins, aliases, and shell functions.\n\nA: It is as simple as typing\nalias\n\non command line. This will list ALL aliases so if you know specifics you can grep that like so ..\nalias|grep rm \n\nto find commands that use rm where you can substitute rm for anything alias would show you to find that specific alias.\n\nA: which rm\n\nmay be the most useful.  Normally, it just shows the full path of executable as found in your $PATH.  If there are multiple executables of that name, it shows the first one found (the one that would be executed).  If there is an alias, it shows the alias in addition to the path.\nwhereis rm\n\ncan also help figure out things like this.  While which shows the first instance found in $PATH, whereis shows them all.  \n", "Q: How to install an already downloaded .crx file extension in chrome?

Since Ubuntu accepted my onboard RAID 0, I used the 2 SSD's with Ubuntu last to store data on, but first I installed BSD a couple times on them. I ended up having to find a freeware thing online which saved the two SSD's and I was able to run those two with my system now. However, I have one SSD left and I want to try booting from USBs as well, but I seem to run into the same problem with both the SSD's and USBs: no matter what I do Ubuntu keeps wanting to save something on those drives, call it \"lost and found\" (locked so I can't see what's in it), and that seems to be what's holding up my disks from being able to COMPETELY ERASE A HARD DRIVE WITH NOTHING NOTHING ON IT!!!!!!!!!!! NOTHING!!!!!!!! Just a fresh SSD and USB to reload the operating systems.. Both the SSD's and USB seem have the same problem finding a way to boot.. tand formatting but that doesn't dAnd the two SSD's that work can't not work without loading into the Grub screen (which I timed out to 0 seconds but it still shows up for a second).. \nThus far, I've tried Gparted, Disk Utility, Shred.. and some program online that was able to fix my solid state drives to load ubuntu on them, but I lost that.. I just want a bootable drive with NO GRUB whatsoever!!!!!! Just one whole disk with NO LEFTOVERS!!! That's it(why can't it be this easy?). I'm not worried about security or secure delete, I just want bootable disks, that's all.. How do I do this? I understand formatting but that doesn't do the trick either\nfor whatever reason, shredding, deleting partitions and reformatting doesn't actually erase everything.. I wanna know how to do this cause it seems you should be able to do this more easily.. \n\nA: What's happening to you is that you're letting Ubuntu format the disk, and so it's putting a Linux filesystem on it. Linux filesystems tend to have a lost+found directory.\nDelete partitions. Don't create any new partitions. Don't reformat. Let the other OS' installer do the formatting.\n\nA: Another option. Using a live USB, find your disk's device name using lsblk, and then run:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=512 count=1 of=/dev/DEVICE\n\n(from Paradoxical's answer, except that I was about to comment that bs=512 count=1 will suffice; I'm not sure why he deleted his answer)\nThis is the quickest way. It wipes out your disk's partition table, so it will appear to be empty to any basic scan. However, make sure that you get the correct device and that the disk is unmounted first.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation in VirtualBox - not using base memory in RAM I am installing Ubuntu right now under VirtualBox in Windows 7. It is going extremely slow and VirtualBox is only using about 128 MB of RAM out of the 1024 MB I set as Base memory to it.\nIs it supposed to do this? It might be an off topic question but I try asking here.\n\nA: Virtualbox uses two separate applications, the actual virtual machine, and the Virtual Box Manager. We can not test this here, but it seems likely that the RAM usage you observed is from the Virtual Box Manager, the GUI to manage all your virtual machines, and not from the VM itself.\nTo speed up Ubuntu we need to make sure the following is met:\n\n\n*\n\n*enable VT-x or AMD-V in BIOS, and in the VM settings\n\n*assign enough RAM (1024 is fine but leave at least 512 MB better more for the host)\n\n*give enough Video RAM (choose 128 MB)\n\n*enable 3D acceleration in the VM settings\n\n*install Guest Additions for (limited) hardware 3D acceleration\n\n*from Ubuntu 12.10 performance is better from 2 CPU cores onward (note that if you have only a dual-core system that this may affect the host operability)\n\n", "Q: How heavy is Mate desktop environment? Considering the same reasons as in this previous question on Cinnamon, it would be interesting to know where does Mate DE stands in this context - between Unity and KDE on the one hand, and Xfce and LXDE on the other. \nSo, to clearify:\nOn a laptop with 1GB of RAM there's a sensible yet tolerable difference between LXDE and Xfce: between these and Gnome and especially KDE and Unity, the difference is decisive. I use in parallel Xfce and LXDE, and wander whether there's another usable DE for me on this computer: all are \"usable\" of course, but compared to LXDE/Xfce not all are acceptable.\n\nThis questions stands being closed: I guess you should close the other one too then. \n\nAs reediting was suggested in comment: to put it as non-subjectively as I can: is Mate heavier on resources than Xfce? Is it lighter than KDE? \n\nA: I'd place it between Gnome2 and KDE, but very very close to Gnome2.  This is based on a netbook, where performance differences are very apparent.\n", "Q: Failed to run Android SDK manager I have installed Android SDK in my Eclipse EE IDE.
