["Q: Open URL from Bash script I have a text file\nGoogle.com\nYoutube.com\nGmail.com\nYahoo.com\n\nI am trying to open them with Lynx. Here is the thesis.\nI will store all of those links at a txt file, say links.txt and then I need to open them with Lynx and then terminate Lynx by using kill. \nHere the code I wrote but its not correct \nfor i in links.txt\ndo\nlynx $i\nsleep 10\npkill lynx\ndone\n\nWhats wrong here?\n\nA: After several iterations...\nfor url in $(cat links.txt); do\n    timeout 10 lynx \"$url\"\ndone\n\nLynx is blocking (and has to be to work) so sleeping doesn't work properly and it also tries to nab stdin which makes piping things \"interestingly\" difficult. See here for iterating lines in a file.\nLynx can be a bit annoying with its prompts for allowing cookies. You can either change its settings if it's a problem or you can pass in the -accept_all_cookies flag, like so:\nfor url in $(cat links.txt); do\n     timeout 10 lynx -accept_all_cookies \"$url\"\ndone\n\nToday I learned about the timeout command, so I'm happy.\n\nTo print a status at the end, the only way I can see how is to check the URL is okay separately, like so:\nfor url in $(cat links.txt); do\n     timeout 10 lynx -accept_all_cookies \"$url\"\n     if [[ $(curl -o /dev/null --silent --head --write-out '%{http_code}\\n' \"$url\") -eq \"200\" ]]; then\n        echo \"Getting $url successful\"\n     else\n        echo \"Getting $url unsuccessful\"\n     fi\ndone\n\n\nA: In your script the lynx call locks the terminal and it will never call sleep 10 and pkill because lynx exits just when you hit \"Q\".\nSo i whould prefer something different. Why don't you use wget. \nSomething like this:\nfor url in $(cat links.txt); do\n  wget -qO- $URL\n  sleep 1\ndone\n\nwget exits after downloading the link. Lynx is more like an interactive console browser (it locks the terminal), it's not made for scripts.\n", "Q: ACL tool for audit of Ubuntu production servers In my production environment, I have close to 10 Ubuntu 12.04 Servers and I want to get the list of users from them.

I had bad RAM. When I removed it, the problem seemed to go away.\nI tried another 1 GB DIMM and the problem appeared again. I removed the 2nd DIMM and the problem continued periodically.\nI looked in /var/crash but I don't see segmentation faults in the crash output. Just very hard to tell what / where the problem is.\nMy experience is that Windows could handle bad DIMMs better than Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How do I execute a program with default variables? How can I execute a program (specifically a bash alias) with the default environment variables?\nConsider this example:\nexport test=\"something I dont want to exist\"\n\nalias _xterm='xterm -fn 7x13 -fa \"Ubuntu Mono:size=12:antialias=false\"'\n\n_xterm\n\nIn the spawned xterm instance, the variable $test shouldn't be set.\n\nA: You could execute your command in an empty environment:\nenv -i _xterm\n\n\nA quick test harness:\n$ export TMUX=3\n$ bash -c 'echo $TMUX'\n3\n$ env -i bash -c 'echo $TMUX'\n# nothing echos\n\n\nPreserving $DISPLAY, $USER, etc:\n$ env -i bash -c 'echo $DISPLAY'\n# nothing\n$ env -i DISPLAY=$DISPLAY bash -c 'echo $DISPLAY'\n:0\n\n\nOr you could explicitly exclude just some variables with the env -u option:\n$ export TMUX=3\n$ env -u TMUX bash -c 'echo $TMUX'\n# nothing\n\n\nA: The names of default environment variables are written with capital letters. Now, assuming that you will define new environment variables with tiny letters (as it is in your example test), instead to use a simple alias _xterm, you can use a function _xterm where you have to unset the new environment variables and keep only the default environment variables for the new shell instance:\n_xterm () {\n    for var in $(env | cut -d\"=\" -f1)\n    do\n        if [[ ! \"$var\" =~ [^a-z] ]]; then\n            unset $var   #or env -u $var\n        fi\n    done\n    xterm -fn 7x13 -fa \"Ubuntu Mono:size=12:antialias=false\"\n}\n\nLike this, your new environment variables are not available in the new shell instance, but when you comeback to the old shell instance you can still use them.\n", "Q: Broadcom's BCM43227 freezes Ubuntu I am running an Ubuntu 13.04 (fresh installation) in my laptop Acer Aspire 5750G. After being working some time, Ubuntu gets stuck, it freezes, and the only thing I can do is to switch off the laptop. I had the same problem with Ubuntu 12.04.\nAfter several tests and having tried everything I could, I came up with the problem: the wireless card and its driver. I have a Broadcom BCM43227 and the driver I use is BCMWL. I suspect the problem comes from there, because when I am connected through a wired Ethernet connection, the laptop works perfectly. However, while working wireless, I always get frozen.\nI went through all the installation instructions of BCM drivers I found in several forums, but nothing works for me. I mean, I have a wireless connection, I can connect to the Internet and everything goes as it should, but it suddenly gets stuck.\nI hope someone could help me. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: There are 2 drivers available for BCM43227 at the moment; one is bcmwl (provided by package bcmwl-kernel-source), and b43 (which is included in the kernel). According to b43's page, support of BCM43227 is 'WIP'.\nYou can try checking out and building the linux wireless repository (see wireless.kernel.org); their drivers are merged into the kernel with some delay, so you might get different results.\nYou can try reporting the error to Broadcom (don't expect much response on it, though, but it always worth a shot, if nothing else, to raise awareness), or add a miniature sized USB wireless controller that works under Ubuntu. Note, they stick out of the laptop by 6mm or so nowadays, they really are tiny.\n", "Q: how to open multiple files with the default program from terminal? I tried to open all my .mp3 files from a folder using xdg-open  but I found out it opens just one! So I searched a little but there was not such a question! I found \"evince\" but apparently it open text files and gnome-open also opens one file.\nI want to open all files of the same format in a folder from the terminal.\nI'm new to Ubuntu so please explain a little more.\n\nA: I wrote a small script /usr/local/bin/o, although you could just call it /usr/local/bin/xdg-open and replace the default command if you wanted (assuming your $PATH gives it priority). Also, if it is given no argument, this script will open the current directory instead.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nif [ $# -eq 0 ]; then\n  xdg-open . &> /dev/null\nelse\n  for file in \"$@\"; do\n    xdg-open \"$file\" &> /dev/null\n  done\nfi\n\nIf you don't want to open the current directory with no argument, this retains the default behaviour, i.e. shows usage.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nif [ $# -eq 0 ]; then\n  xdg-open &> /dev/null\nelse\n  for file in \"$@\"; do\n    xdg-open \"$file\" &> /dev/null\n  done\nfi\n\nN.B. this is agnostic about the default program's ability to parse multiple arguments, but instead will call each command once for each argument. I don't think there's an elegant way around this, since users may want to xdg-open different kinds of files, and some commands will not take multiple arguments anyway.\n\nA: You can try:\nls *.mp3 | while read -r file; do xdg-open \"$file\"; done\n\nls *.mp3 wil list all mp3 files from the current directory, each one on its own line, and the output is piped to an while loop witch read the content of each line and it will open that content (which is the name of a mp3 file in this case) in its default application.\n\nA: I wrote this bash script to cover all the usage cases I could think of:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -euo pipefail; shopt -s failglob # bash strict mode\n\nmax=${max:-10} # Set default maximum if $max is not set\n[[ ${all:-} ]] && max=$# # Set max to all files if $all is non-null\n\nfor file in \"${@:1:$max}\"; do\n  xdg-open \"$file\"\ndone &>>~/.xsession-errors\n\nFeatures:\n\n\n*\n\n*Writes error output to ~/.xsession-errors rather than polluting the terminal or throwing it away\n\n*Defaults to opening a maximum of 10 files (to not overload screen / processor)\n\n*Can set a new maximum with max=20 open $(ls -Q)\n\n*Allow opening all files, eg all=1 open $(ls -Q)\n\nA: Indeed. You could use shell to get around this, like this:\nls *.mp3 | xargs -n 1 xdg-open\n\nThis is very simplistic though, and doesn't work for any special case (spaces, non-ascii characters). An improvement for this would be\nls -b *.mp3 | sed -e s+^+\\\"+ -e s+\\$+\\\"+ | xargs -n 1 xdg-open\n\nThis is quite complex this way, though. A more robust, but simpler solution in this case would be to use find:\nfind -iname '*.mp3' -print0 | xargs -0 -n 1 xdg-open\n\n\nA: Here is a one-liner:\nls -AQp | grep \"\\.mp3\\\"$\" | xargs `xdg-mime query default audio/mpeg | grep -oP '.+(?=\\.desktop)'`\n\nAs I have VLC installed (and as a default for mp3s), this opens all mp3-files in a directory with VLC for me. This is not any sort of \"universal-solve-it-all-and-work-in-every-freaking-case\", but it should work.\nExplanation:\nls -AQp lists \"almost all\" files, quoting filenames and appending slash to names of directories. Replace -p with --file-type if you wish to exclude symlinks as well. Quoting in case of spaces in filenames.\ngrep \"\\.mp3\\\"$\" selects only files that ends with \".mp3\" (plus double-quote).\nxargs redirects the whole lot to program that following subshell returns.\nsubshell:\nxdg-mime query default audio/mpeg gives default app's name in format \"app.desktop\" for files whose mime is audio/mpeg. You can check mimetype for any file in your environment with xdg-mime query filetype /path/to/file. I got \"audio/mpeg\" for mp3-file.\ngrep -oP '.+(?=\\.desktop)' gets the \"app\" from \"app.desktop\".\nIf you're going to use it very frequently in a system that's not going to change much, you might want to shorten it to this:\nls -AQp | grep \"\\.mp3\\\"$\" | xargs default_app\n\nWhere you replace default_app with the actual program that opens with the files. You can figure out its name with this:\nxdg-mime query default audio/mpeg | grep -oP '.+(?=\\.desktop)'\n\n\nxdg-open wont work with this problem, because it accepts only one argument by design. If using xargs -n1, you're propably gona hit the wall with that the resulting app in question might open every file in a new instance, which might get ugly in more than one way.\n\nA: You can use these commands\ncd /path/to/source_folder\n\nfind . -type f -name *.mp3 -exec vlc {} \\+\n\nonly if your music player supports multiple files as command line arguments. Replace vlc with your music player of choice.\nThis works with RhythmBox and VLC in my testing.\n\nA: Use this command for mp3 files if you want to open files in VLC.\nvlc /directory/*.mp3\n\nNote: Use cvlc to use VLC without interface.\n", "Q: How does command-not-found determines if user is administrator I am administrator of two ubuntu servers. On one of them, when I try to run a command (for instance irb1.9.1) from a package that is not installed, I get the following message:\nThe program 'irb1.9.1' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1\n\nOn the other server, I get the following answer:\nThe program 'irb1.9.1' is currently not installed.  To run 'irb1.9.1' please ask your administrator to install the package 'ruby1.9.1'\n\nI can sudo on both servers, so I don't understand how the first one knows I can install the package myself and shows me the command to run, while the second doesn't. \nWhere does the difference come from and how can I get the second server to give me the command like the first server?\nEdit to answer Braiam's comment, apt-cache policy return the same on both servers:\n$ apt-cache policy command-not-found\ncommand-not-found:\n  Installed: 0.3ubuntu7.1\n  Candidate: 0.3ubuntu7.1\n  Version table:\n *** 0.3ubuntu7.1 0\n        500 http://dk.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     0.3ubuntu7 0\n        500 http://dk.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring/main amd64 Packages\n\n\nA: Difference probably occurs because you use different bash versions or different shells. Use: \necho $SHELL\nbash --version\n\nto check your current shell and/or your current bash version.\n\nA: Investigating the topic a bit more, I found that command-not-found was using the /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/CommandNotFound/CommandNotFound.py script, which contains the following line:\nself.user_can_sudo = grp.getgrnam(\"sudo\")[2] in posix.getgroups() or grp.getgrnam(\"admin\")[2] in posix.getgroups()\n\nSo basically anyone in the sudo or admin groups will be considered as an administrator. One of the machines was configured to use the wheel group instead, so visudo would show:\n%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nOn the server I wasn't member of the sudo or admin groups, so command-not-found wouldn't know I could execute apt-get commands with sudo. After adding myself to the sudo group as well, I now get the apt-get command to execute printed out on the terminal.\n", "Q: kerberos ticket watcher I just switched from openSuSe to Ubuntu 12.04.

Keep in mind, I'm a complete newb who has never installed before.\nMy computer is a standard Acer Aspire 5000 (from 2006) and was wondering if anybody else has done this install and can tell me if anything went wrong... like no wireless internet connection, or being really slow, etc...\n\nA: Try it. The standard Ubuntu CD can be booted to and you can test it out before you install anything.\nThe wireless is a Broadcom BCM4318 and that should be supported by the b43 driver but you'll need the firmware-b43-installer to get it working which will mean you need a cable plugged in for part of the installation process:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nAgain you can test that in the LiveCD without harming the computer. You'll need to reload the driver though (rebooting isn't an option, for obvious reasons):\nsudo modprobe -r b43 bcma\nsudo modprobe b43\n\n\nI do appreciate this is probably all Greek and does nothing to lessen the image that you need to use the command line to deal with Linux, but it's an old computer with only old, ropey drivers available... Sometimes a bit of copying and pasting is a necessary evil.\n\nA: Hi I'm a noob at this but I installed lxle64 on my Acer 5000. It installed fast and flawlessly as far as I can tell.

If I start them they both open up a python shell\n\nA: idle3 is a package that depends on idle-python3.3 and Python 3.3 (in Quantal, probably 3.2 in older Ubuntus) amongst other things. From the description (from apt-cache show idle3):\n\nThis package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default\n   Python 3 version (currently v3.3).\n\n\nThe package itself provides a /usr/bin/idle3 script which imports the library provided by the idle-python3.3 package. idle-python3.3 provides a version specific /usr/bin/idle-python3.3 script too.\n\nA: idle3 is a package that depends on idle-python3.5, python3 and python3-tk (module for portable GUI with Tkinter). \nHere is  a visualization of the dependency relationship between the differents packages. \n \ndebtree idle3 --max-depth= 3 | dot -Tpng > idle3.png\n\n", "Q: what are alternative program for ETABS?

Everything else works fine. It loads fine but then the HDMI connection drops and it goes to the Laptop screen. I've looked through settings and can't find alternate display methods other than Display #1 and Window mode.\nWhat gives?\n\nA: This seems to be an issue with XBMC full screen mode. There are people recommending to start XBMC in windowed mode on the secondary screen to then configure Compiz to not draw windows decoration there.\n\nI would like to discourage you from these rather crude measures as you have a rather good chance to accidentally ruin your desktop on your main screen.\n\nWhat I do now is to set my TV in \"Mirror displays\" mode from System Settings -> Displays (e.g. see: Resolution and screens not detected properly). By this XBMC is identically displayed in full screen mode on both screens.\nThis of cource will only then work flawlessly when both, the screen geometry of your laptop, and the screen geometry of your TV are the same.\n\nA: In XBMC (or Kodi, as it's now called, open it) go to SYSTEM on the right side end of the on screen list. Click SETTINGS underneath. Then select \"Settings\" and once there change the \"Settings Level\" to Expert by clicking the Setting Level area twice. Select \"Settings\" then \"Video Output\" and change to video device to your HDMI output (you can also block the other screen unless you feel you may want to use as much in the future).\nI am certain this will absolutely solve your issue (as I have experienced it myself and resolved it this way).\nIf my answer enables the resolution of your issue then please press the up arrow on the left of my post [where there is an up arrow above a number above a down arrow and all others whom this helps should do the same] as it provides a benefit to my and your status on the website for you to do so) or mark it as \"Answered\" or \"the answer\" if possible.\nIf you would rather see as much by video, please ask me and I will create a video showing as much with my HP Notebook and TV by HDMI [I would be using an Asus monitor instead, but computers generally are not concerned if the HDMI device on the other end of the cable is a Television or a Monitor with speakers such as my Asus monitor].\nRespectfully,\nDavid\n", "Q: GDbus.Error:org.openobex.Error.Failed: Unable to request session problem This image & title explains all\n\nAny way to solve this GDbus.Error:org.openobex.Error.Failed: Unable to request session error\n\nA: It's a bug\nThere is a open bug report about this.\nApparently you can work around the problem installing and using blueman.\n\nA: If you run \"bluez-simple-agent\" (terminal or Alt + F2) you can send files.\n\nA: I received this error message too when trying to send files between laptop and phone, but it wasn't solved by using a different method of sending/receiving.\nI could connect and 'pair' my device, however I couldn't send any files.\nThe problem was solved by finding and killing some other interfering processes.

When I open the webpage locally, FF gives me a popup box asking whether I want to open the php file of a page with gedit.\nIs there any way to download a full web page as plain html so that I can access them in a browser locally?\n\nA: Alternatively, you can force wget to rename every extension to HTML on download with the --adjust-extension/-E flag:\nwget --convert-links --mirror --trust-server-names --adjust-extension the_website.com\n\n\nA: They're not actually PHP files though, they just have PHP extensions. There's no simple fix for this. You could rename all the files to .html but then all the links would need fixing too.\nThe simplest way is to serve the files instead of Firefox opening them directly. You can do that by cding into the directory and then using some python magic:\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080\n\nAnd then opening http://localhost:8080 in your browser.\n\nAgain, these aren't real PHP, they're just saved in files that mirror the URL. You don't need to set up PHP and/or Apache (et al) to view them.\n\nEdit: if you have PHP installed you can use PHP's built-in server:\n php -S localhost:8080\n\nThat should handle the mimetype issue, but I wouldn't bother if you don't have PHP installed.\n\nA: Httrack is pretty good at downloading entire webpages as static offline-copies.\nI've used it a few times with good results.\n", "Q: Error 0xc000007b after installing Ubuntu 13.10 I am trying to install Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit with UEFI enabled (since Windows came preinstalled) and I want to keep Windows.

You should be able to boot to rEFInd, which should give options for both Windows and Linux -- probably at least two for Linux. Select a Linux option with the string vmlinuz in the description. If this boots Linux, install the Debian package version of rEFInd, which will replace GRUB as your boot manager. If rEFInd fails, post details, including any error messages you see.\nAnother point: I doubt if it's related to your problem, but a common issue with Windows 8/Linux dual-boot setups is the new Windows \"fast startup\" feature. This feature turns shutdown operations into suspend-to-disk operations, which has the undesirable effect of not properly unmounting filesystems. This in turn results in filesystem damage because the two OSes don't share the same view of the disk. Thus, it's imperative that you disable this feature, as described here (among other places).\n\nA: Try 32 bit version of EFI. \nThe windows you are using is 32 bit, so mbr is writed in 32 bit manner.

I want my server system to be kept on for always. I don't want it to shut down automatically. What is the setting commands for it? \nMy server version is 10.04.4\n\nA: There are several reasons for a computer to shutdown, and I can quickly identify 4:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a process (or cron job) shutting it down;\n\n*Power outage, abnormal shutdown;\n\n*Power outage, gracefull shutdown by your UPS;\n\n*Hardware failure.\n\n\nYou can see the reason for the shutdown with this command:\nsudo last -x\n\nThis command is used to list all system loggins, but it also displays the shutdown, reboot and boot times.\nWhen you shutdown your computer, the run level changes to zero, so you should see this line:\nrunlevel (to lvl 0)\n\nIf you don't see it, then it's an abnormal shutdown (power outage), and that means you should install an UPS.\n\nA: It's a hardware or software problem. If your server is too hot or defective it may do an emergency shutdown after a while to prevent damage.\nUse from a console less /var/log/syslog and dmesg (the last in pipe with grep) to find the reason for the shutdown.\nIf it's NOT an hardware problem (eg. no kernel warnings) then watch in those places (with ls for dirs and nano to edit files) to find shutdown commands & remove them (interpret * as a wildcard please):\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/init/\n\n*/etc/init.d/\n\n*/etc/rc.local\n\n*/etc/rc*.d\n\n\n(if you find \"bad\" commands here your system might have been violated, it's not a standard behaviour).\nIf you use cron (installed by default), see here:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/cron.*\n\n*/etc/crontab\n\n\nThe cron's places may vary depending on your configuration.\n(if you find bad stuff here, watch for bad packages or intrusions)\nImportant note: you should not edit cron's files manually, but use a specific software if you can.\nIf you feel that your system has been haltered or violated reinstall it (do a backup first) OR try to use an Open Source antivirus solution (some malware/virus/backdoor/rootkit can infect Linux!).\nIf you still can't solve (bad situation) and don't want to reinstall, use sudo update-rc.d ENTRY disable to disable the non exential software, but first try to boot in single use mode to see if it's an internal problem.\nIt's all I can suggest for now, I've done my best.Try to solve & have a good experience.\n", "Q: How do I block GRUB from appearing when resuming from hibernation?

This won't work as you'll need a USB host port to accept the dongle (and the printer will need to know how to use it). No. No go.\nHowever you can buy little wireless print-servers that are intended to do what you're suggesting.

How can I invoke TeX Live via command line, without a GUI (as this is on a remote server)?\n\nA: Yes, that command will install a basic but fully functional LaTeX environment.\nYou then compile a document mydoc.tex:\nlatex mydoc\nlatex mydoc\n\nWhich will produce a dvi file which you can further convert to postscript with dvips. (Or other output formats, eg png with dvipng.) In the more likely event that you want PDF output, use pdflatex instead of latex. (I assume this is available in 10.04, I don't have a copy on hand to check).\nIf you are running on a server, you might want the option -interaction=nonstopmode, otherwise it will pause and wait for your input if it finds an error in the document.\nIt is necessary to run latex/pdflatex more than once since during the first pass it will produce various auxiliary files which it then uses to improve the layout the next time around.\nMore detailed questions about latex are probably best asked on the appropriate stackexchange.\n", "Q: No battery indicator when logged in as second (non-sudo) user I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity.\nI have a setup with two users, one with sudo privileges for admin use, and one without for daily use.\nWhen logged in as the non-privileged user, there's no battery indicator.\nWhen logged in as the sudo user, the battery indicator is present.\nChecking in dconf (with dconf-editor), the battery indicator seems to be enabled.

At the risk of sounding like a complete dumb: is the Linux kernel required to run Linux?\nI ask because I'm brand spanking new to the Linux scene and Google doesn't help with this question.\n\nA: I think what you want to ask here is actually: is the Linux kernel required to run the GNU operating system?\nIf this is the case, then the answer is no. Linux is not the official kernel of GNU. The GNU project officially comes with an another kernel: Hurd.\nGNU runs on the FreeBSD kernel too. Debian is one of the few (probably the only one) distributions that offer GNU on the FreeBSD kernel.\nWhat is Linux?\nLinux is a kernel. The traditional definition of kernel states that it is that piece of software that lets processes communicate with the hardware.\nYou rarely interact with Linux directly.\nWhat is GNU?\nIt is an operating system. If you have ever fiddled with the command line, than you have interacted with GNU. Some (but not all) commands like ls, cp and rm are part of GNU. Even the Bash shell is part of GNU. GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program.\nThere are high chances that you have interacted with GNU directly.\nWhat is Hurd?\nMach is a micro-kernel. Hurd is a complete kernel based on Mach. Both Mach and Hurd are part of the GNU project.\nOn the contrary, Linux is not part of GNU; it is an independent project.\nFrom this point of view, Linux is an alternative to Hurd, like KDE is an alternative to GNOME.\nWhy do most people say 'Linux' when they actually mean 'GNU'?\nThis is a long story. The GNU website provides and excellent explanation. I cannot do better:\n\n\n*\n\n*How did it come about that most people call the system “Linux”?\n\n*GNU Users Who Have Never Heard of GNU\nThe correct name for operating systems that offer both GNU and Linux is GNU+Linux or GNU/Linux. Here are the details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why GNU/Linux?\n\n*Linux and the GNU Project\n\nA: Yes. Kernel is THE most important part of any operating system. \n\nA: The Linux operating system consists of two parts:\n\n*\n\n*Kernel developed by Linux Torvalds.\n\n*GNU Tools:\n\n*\n\n*Richard Stallman, the founder of GNU project.\n\n\n\nWhen the system boots, it starts with the kernel.\nIf something is wrong in the kernel you'll find an error like \"Kernel Panic\"\n\nA: short answer: Yes, you need it.\nLong answer: The kernel is like the engine of a car. Without it your system does nothing. You can find all info you need about what the kernel is on this website\nthe kernel is automatically installed during your linux installation.\n\nA: The kernel is one of the first parts of an operating system to be loaded on startup. It handles hardware through drivers, and thus allocates system resources to processes running on the OS. If you did not have a kernel, your operating system would be unable to function.\n", "Q: redirect facebook visit to another webpage I'm looking for a way to redirect visits to facebook to another website.

It is instead a filesystem problem, and in particular a problem with NTFS, which is a Windows filesystem. If you're sharing this disk with Windows, NTFS can be a reasonable choice, but if the disk is used only with Linux, NTFS is a poor choice, and your problem illustrates why: There are no good Linux tools for repairing damage to NTFS. The ntfsfix utility is named somewhat deceptively. Although it can fix some very minor problems, mostly ntfsfix just sets a flag in the filesystem that causes Windows to run more extensive checks and repairs the next time the disk is used from Windows.\nIn your case, the solution that's most likely to help is to use Windows. If Windows can't fix it automatically or semi-automatically (by using CHKDSK or its GUI front-ends), you should ask on a Windows forum, because NTFS is not a Linux-native filesystem. Beware, though: Attempts to fix filesystem damage sometimes make matters worse. You might want to back up the data (as in sudo dd if=/dev/sdb2 of=/path/to/some/backup-file.img) before doing anything else. The location pointed to by of= must have enough free space to hold the raw image data (about 300GiB).\nIf you can't get any results even after asking on a Windows forum, you could use PhotoRec to try to recover files.

The Medibuntu Project has come to an end: what do I do now?\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I find packages on my system which came from medibuntu? The previous question seems to list medibuntu packages explicitly - is there a way to query the package database by the source?\n\n*Do I need to remove them so that they are replace by maintained packages from other sources?\n\n*Which repository contains those packages now?\n\nA: By now almost all the medibuntu packages have been already superseded with packages from the main repos (restricted, universe, multiverse), so the task is to eliminate the traces of medibuntu.\nYou would probably be better off installing aptitude before hand (see below).\nAs root, do the following to forget medibuntu:\naptitude purge medibuntu-keyring\nrm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list\naptitude update\n\nNow, to purge the packages which come from medibuntu, do this:\naptitude purge $(dpkg-query -W -f='${PackageSpec}\\t${Maintainer}\\n' '*' |\\\n  grep medibuntu-maintainers@lists.launchpad.net |\\\n  cut -f1)\n\nYou might have to select an alternative dependency problem resolution (e.g., aptitude might suggest that you remove a 100 packages if you purge a medibuntu library libavutil; say no and it will offer to install the same library from an alternative source).\nThis means that you will probably be better off using aptitude than apt-get for this task because the former offers the alternatives for dependency problem resolution.

When the display manager begins, it runs X. Then the user is given options of which WM or DE they wish to run. \nSo when the display manager starts, does it simply run \"startx\"? After that, what configuration in what file gets changed when the user selects the WM/DE they want to run?

In Ubuntu (using the default LightDM), you can click the Ubuntu icon in the upper right of the \"login pane\" to change DEs:\n\n\nMost DMs will provide a configuration file, where a system default session can be selected. It may also store the last used session for each user, e.g. to allow one user to always login to Gnome instead of Unity.\nWhen you log in, the DM simply looks at if you have a preference stored, then runs the .desktop file for the session in your preference or the system default.\n", "Q: Windows is not booting any more after resizing \"/\" On my machine I have two ubuntu partitions and one windows partition.

Its annoying to use Xterm instead of the default Terminal.\n\nA: Using your xterm write those commands:\nsudo apt-get remove gnome-terminal\nsudo apt-get install gnome-terminal\n\nThe password is your account password and those commands will reinstall gnome-terminal, which should be the \"default\" terminal.\nI hope it will fix.\n\nA: Follow these steps to set gnome-terminal as default\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute following command in terminal\nexo-preferred-applications\n\n\n*Preferred Applications Window will open go to Utilities tab.\n\n*Under Terminal Emulator chose Gnome Terminal.\nif Gnome Terminal not listed, install it by sudo apt-get install gnome-terminal\n\n*Close the window.\nThat's all..!  Reply if something goes wrong..:)\n\nA: If you removed Unity, you may be missing other desktop dependencies, or they may not be on their latest versions. To get everything installed again, open up Xterm and run these commands:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nThis will reinstall the ubuntu-desktop meta package, which depends on all the other components of the desktop (and was likely removed if you ran apt-get purge unity).\nIf you're still missing the default Terminal, then run this command:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-terminal\n\n", "Q: Touchpad multi-tap buttons not configured correctly on 12.04 LTS I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 on an Acer C7 chromebook with chrubuntu. Overall, it works very well, but there is one minor problem. I would like one finger for left click, and two for right click. \nI can achieve this easily with the following commands\nsynclient TapButton1=1\nsynclient TapButton2=3\nsynclient TapButton3=2\n\nHowever, after reboot (or closing/opening the lid), when I query synclient, the settings are as follows:\nTapButton1 = 3\nTapButton2 = 1\nTapButton3 = 0\n\nThis is an odd and undesirable three-finger left click! This persists, even though I have added the following lines to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.conf\nOption \"TapButton1\" \"1\"\nOption \"TapButton2\" \"3\"\nOption \"TapButton3\" \"2\"\n\nI've tried adding the synclient commands to correctly configure the touchpad to /etc/rc.local, but it still starts up incorrectly. The only workaround is a script that sets up the touchpad correctly, which I run everytime I re-open the lid. It works, but not the most elegant fix for an otherwise excellent system\nAny idea how I can make the touchpad configured correctly at startup, or re-opening the lid?

It runs OK. on windows\n\nA: If you have a decent router, the PPPoE connection is (or should be) handled in the router and is stored in it, unaffected by power down resets. The connection to your computer becomes a VPN to the router (LAN). Very few routers (only very old ones) need the PPPoE to be reset for every computer or operating system. If they do, you have very little firewall protection between you and the web, in which case I'd recommend a new one, SMC, Netgear etc. ....\nYou can boot in windows and check the connection settings there, make a note of them including any passwords, then boot back into Ubuntu and make sure the connection is the same. Ubuntu nearly always finds the correct settings for a LAN entirely on its own, unlike some others!\n", "Q: How to shut down cleanly on signal from UPS? Sp, our little Ubuntu server already killed a hard drive from a sudden power failure when the IPS wenr dead. The UPS sends a network signal to the LAN, but i don't know how to get Ubuntu to recognize the signal from the UPS?\n\nA: Install and configure nut-server and nut-client to work with your UPS. Note that however, it does not work with all available UPS systems available.\n\nA: If you're running a UPS (I have two APC 1400 units) you don't have to have LAN connection as the UPS should just kick in and maintain power, on mains failure it will (or should) sound a very audible alarm and mine will wake me even when I'm snoring in the next room.\nOne problem I often find is that a UPS unit is frequently loaded beyond it's capability. It is the cause of many headaches and crashes that using underrated supplies, causes spikes and voltage variations that are exactly what you are trying to avoid. Power failures often come with random pulses that will kill most drives unless the UPS is stable and working well within its limits ... are you sure yours are capable of handling at least 30% more than your system needs? My two main systems (750Watts max each) run off the two 1400VA units and the router runs on its own 350VA. This way it all stays alive.\nOh yeah, check the life of the batteries, they are definitely not immortal and even though they might take a full charge, they may not deliver anything like they did when new. The UPS only tells you a battery needs replacing when it is utterly dead, not nearly early enough!\nCheck with the UPS manufacturer's website for Linux specific LAN event power software, it will almost certainly be there as a free downland, as most servers run in Linux and UPS units are mostly in use on servers.\n", "Q: Dragging and dropping from browser to Nautilus saves link instead of file, how to change default action?

I had to reformat my drive because my computer does not support 12.04 or higher. Now when I go to the update manager it is not recognising a Internet connection. I have an Internet connection and it works fine this is confusing. My computer is a satellite A10 Toshiba laptop with a 75g drive and a 32 bit processor. All I want is for this computer is for it to upgrade to 11.10 so I can run it on my tv via vga adapter. 10.10 does not support this feature without going batty on me. Any answers would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I am not sure if it is possible to upgrade an unsupported release.. and if it's possible, it's not possible to upgrade to 11.10 directly. It is only possible to upgrade to the next release (so in this case, to 11.04) or from LTS to LTS (So for example, from 10.04 to 12.04)\nSo that basically means that the only way to get to the release you want is to do a clean install.\n", "Q: fatal error: log4cxx/logger.h: No such file or directory I am getting this error whenever I am compiling my c++ code from command line.\nfatal error: log4cxx/logger.h: No such file or directory\nIs there any easy way to download the log4cxx package from the command line using apt get?\nI do found the wiki which talks about downloading it and compiling it step by step..

I was looking through my system with du -sch ./* to find the big useless files I may have stockpiled with no reason, when I found this:\n$ du -sch ./*\ndu: cannot read directory ‘./drbunsen/.gvfs’: Permission denied\ndu: cannot read directory ‘./drbunsen/.cache/dconf’: Permission denied\n18G ./drbunsen\n18G total\n\n$ cd drbunsen/\n$ du -sch ./*\n601M ./Desktop\n20K ./Documents\n598M ./Downloads\n4.0K ./flash\n4.0K ./Music\n8.0M ./Pictures\n4.0K ./Public\n4.0K ./Templates\n4.0K ./Ubuntu One\n8.0K ./Videos\n11G ./VirtualBox VMs\n6.9M ./workspace\n12G total\n\nHow do I make hidden files visible? du -sch ./.* gives the same result as du -sch ./*.\n\nA: I have same question in coreutils mailing list, because it was hard to me to remember this weird command by @don.joey. And Bob Proulx proposed better, more natural command: \ndu -ahd1 | sort -h\n\nIf you want to list all of the files in the current directory then\n  either use '.' or don't give it any file arguments at all.  Also you\n  may want to use the -d, --max-depth=N option.\nTry this:\ndu -hd1\n\n\nA: Use\ndu -sch .[!.]* * |sort -h\n\nin your home folder.\nAlternatively, the command I use most frequently is\nncdu\n\nEasy to install if needed: \nsudo apt-get install ncdu\n\n\nA: This also works to show hidden files and dirs:\ndu -sch $(ls -A .) | sort -h\n\n\nA: When you run that same command inside the directory, it is not including the hidden files which start with . in the count. If you have Steam for example installed, it default to installing games under ~/.local/share/Steam/ and it itself is installed there as well.\nUnder bash you apparently need to run du -sch .[!.]* * as it does not properly expand the .* glob. Under zsh or other shells, du -sch * .* should work, as .* should be expanded to include the list of all hidden files in the current directory.\n\nA: I don't think the du utility has a command line switch to process hidden files by default.\nOne way of achieving this is to use the find utility to find the hidden files that you are interested in and then run the du utility on each entry:\nfind ./ -maxdepth 1 -name '.*' -exec  du -hs {} \\;\n\nThis gives you additional flexibility as you may only be interested in directories:\nfind ./ -maxdepth 1 -type d -name '.*' -exec  du -hs {} \\;\n\nOr you may want to see all hidden files and directories deep to the current working directory:\nfind ./ -name '.*' -exec  du -hs {} \\;\n\nIt's not much harder to sort the output, so you can easily identify large hidden files that could help you save disk space:\n{ find ./ -maxdepth 1 -iname '.*' -exec  du -hs \\{\\} \\; ;} | sort -h\n\n", "Q: Internet is insanely slow on home network only with one computer I've got a really weird problem.

I realize that ssh keys are set (and I have one) but I need to log in to the node directly as networking is not coming up properly.\nIs there a way to change this in the preseed?\n\nA: As stated in MAAS documentation, altering the preseed files is not recommended, because it might prevent MAAS from properly commissioning and installing nodes.\nAre you able to connect to the node using SSH and user ubuntu? If so, looking in /var/log/dmesg and /var/log/syslog can help diagnosing startup and networking issues.\nIf you need to alter the preseeds, you can find the full documentation, describing all supported settings here.

This is the one you need to edit for changes to be applied for your Apache setup which utilizes the in-built PHP module to Apache.\n/etc/php/5.6/fpm/php.ini is for the php5-fpm processor, which is a fastcgi-compatible 'wrapper' for PHP processing (such as to hand off from NGINX to php5-fpm) and runs as a standalone process on the system (unlike the Apache PHP plugin)\n\nFor versions of Ubuntu lower than 16.04, /etc/php/5.6/,/etc/php/7.0/,/etc/php/7.1/, and so on, are replaced by /etc/php5/ and so on.

I have removed LibreOffice from my Kubuntu system last week. I installed the latest version of OpenOffice. However, for some strange reason the software center is telling me I have updates for LibreOffice. \nCould it be that I still have the PPA for LibreOffice install? Can someone please tell me how to remove the LibreOffice PPA and prevent the software center from installing LibreOffice or any updates for it. I would like to stick with just OpenOffice.\nThank you\n\nA: To remove the libreoffice ppa run the following commands:\n  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa --remove\n  sudo apt-get update\n\nTo make sure no libre office components are left behind:\n sudo apt-get purge libreoffice*\n\n\nA: To find out if you have any PPAs, open a terminal, and type sudo bash, followed by your password. Then cd to /etc/apt/sources.list.d and type ls | grep libre*. If you see any results in the terminal from this, you probably have a LibreOffice ppa, which you can delete using rm (whatever results the previous command gave you), or by using rm libreoffice*. However, it's worth noting that LibreOffice is also available from the Ubuntu Main source, which you shouldn't remove.\nAs for any LibreOffice trying to reinstall/upgrade itself, Ubuntu will only ever upgrade packages that are already installed. Just because you are subscribed to a software source, doesn't mean the software in said source will be installed. Odds are, you have some remaining peaces of LibreOffice left.\nI would first try running sudo apt-get autoremove, and see if that helps. The autoremove command tells apt-get to remove any unnecessary packages from your system, some of which may be LibreOffice-related. However, if apt-get thinks some of the packages are important, it will not remove them, as may be the case here.\nYou can probably test this using sudo apt-get purge libre* -s. Do note that the -s at the end tells apt-get only to simulate the removal process: nothing actually gets changed. However, you will see a number of apps which the system pretends to remove, in which case you should be able to pick out the ones that actually seem LibreOffice-related (be warned: many apps and libs will probably be unrelated; use caution when removing them, as they may be important to your system) using sudo apt-get purge (program). From there, you can run sudo apt-get autoremove like I mentioned above, and that should get rid of LibreOffice completely.\n", "Q: How to assign a shortcut key to send my system into hibernation?

I referred this Ubuntu Forums Thread but couldn't find any solution for this.\nAny solution please?\n\nA: If you need to setup hibernation shortcut sequence, you go to Ubuntu System settings (Ctrl+Alt+T and then typing gnome-control-center) and then choosing keyboard settings. \n\nUnder that, you will see a tab that says \"shortcuts\", and there will be an option to set a custom command :\n\nThen you will need to put the command you want to hibernate your computer.\n\nA: Firstly, Hibernate will need to be enabled.

They might be a sign of memory corruption or some software bugs.  I would run memcheck. \n\nA: What is wrong is that at the time that your machine was reset the data for the log file had not been written from memory (the kernel's disc cache) to disc, but the metadata recording its current size had been.

My rEFInd documentation page on installing rEFInd goes into more detail for rEFInd, and you can adjust the critical commands for other boot programs, such as GRUB.\nDoing it the \"right\" way requires an EFI-mode boot in order to register GRUB with the firmware; however, you can install the files from a legacy-mode boot and then use Windows, an EFI shell, or sometimes even the firmware's built-in user interface to register the boot program with the firmware.\nAlternatively, you can give the boot program the name EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on the EFI System Partition (ESP). This is a fallback filename for EFI-mode booting; if no other boot program is available, the firmware uses this filename. In fact, if you intend to move your USB device from one computer to another, this is the preferred way to do it, since then you won't need to register the boot loader with each computer's firmware.\n", "Q: How do I disable Virtual Consoles tty[1-6]?

I am interested in knowing how software update works (technically). What all are the components that checks, downloads and installs new update and how do they work.\n\nA: That's something for a complete 600 pages book! 8-) More or less, someone gets a software project, compiles it and creates a package and stores it in a repository.\nPackages receive a version so the system can recognize older and newer versions.\nThe package system on your computer can access the repository and see whether new versions of packages that are installed on your computer have available. If so, it offers you the possibility to upgrade.\nThere is a lot more to it than just that. For example, when upgrading a server you want to stop the server, do the upgrade, then restart the server. These steps are accomplished by pre and post scripts as described on this page:\nhttp://windowspackager.org/documentation/implementation-details/scripts-and-processes\nAnother important point, different packages may not be compatible between each others. For example, if you install Postfix you cannot also install sendmail because both offer the same functionality (although there are ways to offer both software via the alternative links.) Similarly, installing Apache and httplight would generally be in conflict because both use port 80 by default. Again, you can fix the conflict by tweaking the settings of each server, but by default the operating system is likely going to tell you that you cannot do that.\nYou may want to read about the Debian Policy Manual\nhttp://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/\nas it gives you quite a bit of information in that regard.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses apt under the hood for doing package management which provides and interface to dpkg for the actually  installation, updates and removal of packages.\nFrom Debian (as ubuntu as a Debian derivative) http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html#_the_event_flow_of_the_package_management the flow is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update\n\n*\n\n*Fetch archive metadata from remote archive\n\n*Reconstruct and update local metadata for use by APT \n\n\n*Upgrade\n\n*\n\n*Chose candidate version which is usually the latest available version for all installed packages\n\n*Make package dependency resolution \n\n*Fetch selected binary packages from remote archive if candidate version is different from installed version \n\n*Unpack fetched binary packages \n\n*Run preinst script\n\n*Install binary files \n\n*Run postinst script \n\n\n\nFurther reading\nFor info on dpkg and apt: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkgtools.en.html\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto\nFor info on pre and post scripts:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html#s-maintscripts\n", "Q: No option to start Ubuntu OS after installtion I successfully installed Ubuntu however, every time I startup my lapyop it goes straight to windows 8 OS.

I downloaded Ubuntu 12.04.3 64 bit from this site (I have a Toshiba p850 i7, so it is a new laptop, that's why I chose 64 bit), and I mounted it on a USB using universal USB installer.\nI tried booting from USB with UEFI on, but I got a black screen with GNU grub, and a grub command line. I tried rebooting but with UEFI off (CSM), it booted normally, but it didn't detect my Windows 8 operating system. I suppose that's because I booted with UEFI off. I need my PC to dual boot, so I want Ubuntu to be installed with UEFI on.\n\nA: First, I'm not sure that Universal USB Installer is the best tool for creating the USB drive. This question and answers cover the issue, so you may want to consult it. In Linux, dd works, and there are ports of dd to Windows, such as dd for Windows and WinDD. I haven't tried either of those tools, so I can't promise either will work for you.\nSecond, the problem with the installer not \"recognizing\" Windows is deceptive. The installer is probably detecting the Windows partitions just fine, but isn't giving you the option to automatically resize and set up Linux next to them. In this case, you must use the (poorly-named) \"Something Else\" installation option, as described here (among many other places). Note that some sites describe use of this option on BIOS-based computers, but one detail is different for EFI systems: You must create an EFI System Partition (ESP) and tell Ubuntu to use it by marking it as an \"EFI boot partition.\"\nFinally, if all else fails, it is possible to install Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and then install an EFI boot loader for Linux after the fact. rEFInd is likely to be the easiest to install, although you may need to install an EFI filesystem driver for ext4fs to get it to work.\n\nA: First check that your BIOS firmware version is up-to-date.  There was a known problem with older firmwares.  Don't let boot-repair rename the bootloaders, not necessary, and you might need the efi-boot menu to boot windows (bug 1091464).\n", "Q: Owner of /usr/lib is not root Virtualbox program error:\n\nFailed to open a session for the virtual machine ....

Pressing alt + tab brings up a carousel of all the icons of my open applications, and by hitting tab I can cycle through them. By releasing tab it brings the window of the application I'm currently on to the front of the screen.\nBut how do I quickly and efficiently jump to an application that has multiple windows open? I often have multiple Terminal windows open, for example. But I have to cycle onto the terminal icon, and then cycle through all of the open terminal windows to find the window I want.\nIn OSX, an application with multiple windows can still be quickly 'tabbed' into because it opens the last window of the application that you were working on (I think). Can I emulate this behaviour, or at least speed up my workflow in Ubuntu? I want to jump between sublime text and the last terminal window I was working in (of my many terminal windows).\n\nA: When too many apps are open, searching in the Activities Overview can prove to be more useful. Activities Overview can be accessed with the Super key.\nFor example, to quickly switch to using the Google Chrome app :\n\n*\n\n*Press Super\n\n*Type prefix \"ch\" and press Enter to switch to using the Google Chrome app.\n\nWith this method, you jump directly to the desired app without having to worry about the open windows.\n\nA: Pressing alt + ` will bring up the app switcher but only for windows of that application, if that's what you're looking for.\nAlso, Super + Tab will switch through applications by running down the Unity Launcher, and when you open the application with multiple windows, it will automatically open the last active window.\n\nA: If you press Alt  + Tab  and get into the application switcher, you can press Up or Down keys to switch between different windows of the currently highlighted app. \n\nA: You can create keyboard shortcuts(key bindings) to jump to your preferred apps quickly using jumpapp.\nFor example, since I am a software engineer who relies on efficiently using the Terminal, Google-Chrome, and Visual-Studio-Code apps a lot, I bound:\n\n*\n\n*Terminal: Ctrl + P\n\n*Google Chome: Alt + Q\n\n*Visual Studio Code: Ctrl + M\nIt took a little while to build muscle memory, but the benefit definitely outweighed the cost.\nimportant : Because jumpapp works best with X11 window manager, you will need to switch from Wayland(default window manager) to X11 window manager using instructions here or here\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu to a preformatted partition I tried to install Ubuntu from a USB stick but I got confused when it started to install on my external USB drive.

You can copy a single file with the command scp mymodem:/path/to/file . where mymodem is the host name of your modem. If you want to copy all the files, you need to be a bit more careful, because you need to exclude some special files from /dev and /proc and /sys.\nIf your modem has the command rsync, then the following will do (-x excludes filesystems other than the root filesystem):\nrsync -ax mymodem:/ --exclude=/dev mymodem-files\n\nIf your modem has only the most basic set of tools, scp -r should still work. Make sure to exclude the problematic toplevel directories.\nmkdir mymodem-files\ncd mymodem-files\ndirs=$(ssh mymodem ls / | grep -Evx 'dev|proc|sys')\nfor d in dirs; do scp -rp mymodem:/$d .; done\n\nWhere the “admin password” is stored is very dependent on the modem. It may be in /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow if it's a unix password, or in a completely different place if it's a password solely for the web interface. If the modem software is doing things right, you won't be able to find what the password was, but you'll be able to change it by modifying a file if you locate where the password is and figure out what kind of hash is used.\n", "Q: IDE for Developing windows phone 8 applications in Ubuntu I used to work with Ubuntu, and I don't want to switch back to Windows platform.

When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n", "Q: How can I transfer Ubuntu from a stick to a new SSD My SSD died a month ago, I ordered a new SSD that has just arrived. \nIn the meantime I had installed (with friendly help) and had been running Ubuntu from a USB stick.\nNow I'd like to transfer Ubuntu from the USB stick on to the new installed SSD.\nWhat should I do?\nAt the moment the SSD is not mounted and is formatted as FAT 32 bits.\n\nA: You can use dd to clone the USB stick to SSD.\ndd if=/dev/sdx of=/dev/sdy\nWhere sdx is the drive you wish to clone from and sdy is the drive you wish to clone to.\nThis can be dangerous if you are not expert with dd, Google before proceeding.\nWhat are you using on the USB, a Full install or a Persistent install?\nA Persistent install has limitations when used as a main o/s, such as inability to upgrade and update. You would also need to make an ext4 casper-rw partition to get more than 4GB of persistence.\nIf you are using a Full install you can expand partition size after cloning.\nIf you do not wish to use dd, you can copy using rsync, grsync is a gui version.\n", "Q: I cant connect to the wireless internet on Uuntu 13.04 im a new ubuntu user and i just installed ubuntu 13.04 to run alongside windows.

The question was asked over 2 years ago and clearly it was not smart to try it mainly due to the USB bottleneck of the card reader.\nCan we expect the situation to be any different today?\n\n\n*\n\n*SD cards are faster (or it's cheaper to get faster ones),\n\n*card readers may transition to USB 3.0 (not too soon?),\n\n*it is possible to just install the system to a SD/MMC (/home on\nHDD) and use F2fs (with minor tweaking, /boot on a different partition fs,\nSaucy coming with gparted 0.16). [well I hope the result is better than a live-usb...]\n\n\nBonus question: could MMC be better than SD (my Vaio has a dedicated MMC reader that would thus be put to good use)))?\n\nA: For what it's worth, I was able to install ubuntu 13.10 on f2fs. I used vmware for that, which makes it easier to mess with disks, but I see no reason why it wouldn't work with physical drives. Here's what I had to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install base operating system to disk1. I made two partitions: one for /boot (128Mb), and another for root file system (the rest). Both formatted as ext4, since installer did not give me option\n\n*Once operating system has installed:\n\n*\n\n*install package f2fs-tools using apt-get\n\n*modify /etc/initramfs-tools/modules, adding line f2fs to the end\n\n*run update-initramfs to regenerate initramfs with f2fs support in it\n\n*modify /etc/fstab, and replaced UUID=xxx with references to actual devices (/dev/sda1 for /boot and /dev/sda2 for root)\n\n\n*make a duplicate of disk1 to disk2 for backup\n\n*I used a separate Ubuntu installation for this step, but you could get away with the one you are installing, or maybe even live cd:\n\n\n*\n\n*format /dev/sda2 on disk1 as f2fs using mkfs.f2fs /dev/sda2\n\n*copy all files from ext4:\nmkdir /mnt/a\nmkdir /mnt/b\nmount /dev/sda2 /mnt/a -t f2fs\nmount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/b\ncd /mnt/b\ncp -a * /mnt/a/\n\n\n*Disconnect disk2 and restart machine. On grub prompt, press e to edit boot commands. There will be line looking like linux /vmlinuz-3.xx.xx-generic root=UUID=uuuuuuu xx. Replace UUID=uuuuuuuu part with /dev/sda2 and press F10 to boot\n\n*If you successfully booted, run update-grub2 to fix boot config. You should be able to boot properly at this time\n\n\nThis is it. I'm sure there's a lot more elegant way of doing it, but that can at least get you going.\n", "Q: I need a good solution to bypass internet censorship on Ubuntu I live in Iran, where  many websites are blocked from access by a professional local firewall.\nI'm looking for a free  VPN, HTTPS, or any possible proxy software/solution for Ubuntu that could let me to bypass the censorship, so that I could at least access Facebook and Twitter.\nI'm saying free because I'm a full time college student and I really can't afford buying a VPN service alongside of other costs to just be able to access Facebook and Twitter.\nI do use Hotspot Shield  for Windows, which is very fast and does the job.

If you don't want to see the BIOS console, use the quiet boot option in your BIOS options.\nTo see the BIOS options press F2, F8, F12 or Canc, depending on your BIOS version and model.\nIf the BIOS takes too much time you can disable the virus boot memory protection (leave it enabled if you use Windows or use the pc for production purposes) and the extra device checks.\nHave a nice day.\n", "Q: Folder links not working after reboot I want to create a link (like shortcut in windows) to a folder stored in one of my drives.

I have modified file with sed to remove additional spaces and other stuff but then I noticed space that was immune to regular command:\nsed -r 's:some-text :some-text:g' -i file\n\nAfter using cat -A file I found out that this looks like this:\n<p>M-BM- Lorem ipsum</p>\n\nHow to remove it?\n\nA: The M-BM- characters are an ASCII representation of byte sequence 0xc2 0xa0, which is the UTF8 encoding of unicode character A0 - a non-breaking space character. This character can be inserted in both LibreOffice and Microsoft Word documents using the key sequence Ctrl+Shift+SPACE.\nFor example if we create a new .odt document in LibreOffice and type ABCCtrl+Shift+SPACEDEF, then Save As... Text (ignoring the warning that the document may contain features that cannot be saved in that format), then view the resulting .txt file with cat:\n$ cat nbsp.txt \nABC DEF\nand then again with the -v switch to show non-printing characters\n$ cat -v nbsp.txt \nM-oM-;M-?ABCM-BM- DEF\nNote that we also get an initial sequence M-oM-;M-? or hexadecimal 0xef 0xbb 0xbf which is the UTF8 byte order mark (BOM) consistent with the file type reported by the file command i.e.\n$ file nbsp.txt \nnbsp.txt: UTF-8 Unicode (with BOM) text\nUsing od to print the hexadecimal values in byte order we see\n$ od -tx1 nbsp.txt\n0000000 ef bb bf 41 42 43 c2 a0 44 45 46 0a\n0000014\nIt is possible to manipulate these characters using standard tools like sed or tr by specifying the hex codes as escape sequences e.g. to replace the non-breaking space with a plain ASCII space\n$ sed 's/\\xc2\\xa0/ /g' nbsp.txt\nABC DEF\nChecking again with od confirms the replacement by an ordinary ASCII space 0x20 (decimal 32)\n$ sed 's/\\xc2\\xa0/ /g' nbsp.txt | od -tx1\n0000000 ef bb bf 41 42 43 20 44 45 46 0a\n0000013\nIn gnome-terminal (and maybe other UTF8-aware terminal emulators), it's also possible to enter the unicode code point value directly using the key sequence Ctrl+Shift+u followed by a hexidecimal value then the Enter key - the sequence shows up initially as u̲.̲.̲.̲ but then the character should compose when you hit Enter e.g. for the same non-breaking space replacement we can do\n$ sed 's/Ctrl+Shift+ua0\nwhich displays as\n$ sed 's/̲/̲u̲a̲0̲\n\nand then completes as\n$ sed 's/ / /g' nbsp.txt\nABC DEF\nUsing cat -v we can confirm the M-BM- sequence has become an ordinary space\n$ sed 's/ / /g' nbsp.txt | cat -v\nM-oM-;M-?ABC DEF\nYou may want to look at more generic encoding converters such as iconv and uconv as well.\n\nA: After trying a lot of things, I have finally found solution. To replace that weird character with sed, you need to copy and paste exact text that contains that weird space near it, and then paste it directly into sed command:\nsed -r 's:paste-here:<p>:g' -i file\nWhich will look like this in sed command:\nsed -r 's:<p> :<p>:g' -i file\nbut it will work anyway.\n\nA: You can remove ^M from the files directly via sed command, e.g.:\nsed -i'.bak' s/\\r//g *.*\n\nIf you're happy with the changes, remove the .bak files:\nrm -v *.bak\n\n\nA: \"cat -v file \" will show the non-printing characters in the file. Just redirect the output to some temporary file and use vim for replacing the M-BM- characters with nothing.\n%s/M-BM- //g\nEasiest solution.\n\nA: little script for remove this devil M-BM- caracter ! ;) Just in case will be help any people.\n#!/bin/bash\n#############################################################################\n# SCRIPT:   M-BM-Remover.sh\n# DESCRIPTION:\n#           This script will be able to detect hidden caracter \"M-BM-\",\n#               And/Or remove this !\n# REVISIONS:\n#           2014/06/11  YG\n#____________________________________________________________________________\n#\n# PARAMETERS:\n#  > $1  :TARGET,      (e.g. '\"*.sh\"' )\n#  > $2  :ACTION,      (e.g. 'remove' )\n#  > $2  :BACKUP,      (e.g. '' )\n#\n#############################################################################\n\nTARGET=$1\nACTION=$2\nBACKUP=$3\n\nif [ \"$TARGET\" = \"\" ]\nthen\n    echo 'Need to choose target file'\n    echo 'M-BM-Remover [TARGET] [show/remove] [backup]'\n    echo 'Example : M-BM-Remover \"*.sh\" remove backup'\n    exit\nfi\n\necho \"ACTION = $ACTION\";\necho \"TARGET = $TARGET\";\necho\n\nif [ \"$ACTION\" = \"show\" ]\nthen\n    for file in $TARGET\n    do\n        if [ \"$file\" != \"M-BM-Remover.sh\" ]\n        then\n            echo \"Traitement de $file ...\"\n            cat -v $file | grep M-BM-\n            NB=`cat -v $file | grep M-BM- | wc -l`\n            echo \"Occurence(s) : $NB\"\n        fi\n    done \nfi\n\nif [ \"$ACTION\" = \"remove\" ] || [ \"$ACTION\" = \"\" ]\nthen\n    for file in $TARGET\n    do\n        if [ \"$file\" != \"M-BM-Remover.sh\" ]\n        then\n            echo \"Traitement de $file ...\"\n            NB=`cat -v $file | grep M-BM- | wc -l`\n            if [ \"$BACKUP\" = \"backup\" ]\n            then\n                cat $file > $file.bak\n            fi\n            cat -v $file.bak | sed s/M-BM-//g > $file\n            echo \"Occurence(s) removed : $NB\"\n        fi\n        echo\n    done \nfi\n\n", "Q: Nvidia driver - After install - No unity or black screen with cursor I'm using Ubuntu 13.04 x64, I've tried many distros based on Ubuntu/Debian as well.\nFor example: Mint 13,14,15 KDE & Cinnamon, Kubuntu, Xubuntu etc.\nMy graphic cards: - Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000 (DEFAULT)\n                  - NVIDIA GeForce GT635M 2GB (Need to be installed correctly)\nI was looking on the internet to find the sulotion, but nothing.\nThen I tried:  \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nAfter reboot, Unity dissappered or black screen with cursor.\nI've also tried to look into \"Driver Manager\" but there was nothing to install..\nSomeone knows the solution?\nHow to install my Nvidia Driver correctly and make it working.\n\nA: I suggest you remove the nvidia drivers, and then install bumblebee, since you got optimus:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia*\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia\n\nAfter that, reboot and hope it works.\n", "Q: I can't rename a file using the terminal if it came from a parameter I am automating some deployment task with an .sh script but at some point I need to rename a file but it is not working.

(For information on how to compile and install source packages, see CompilingEasyHowTo).\nBinary packages are ones which have been made specifically for one type of computer, or architecture. Ubuntu supports the x86 (i386 or i686), AMD64 and PPC architectures. The correct binary packages will be used automatically, so you don't have to worry about picking the right ones. To find out which one you are using, open your terminal, type uname -m then hit the Enter key.\n\n\nA: Basically, Source packages need to be compiled by you before installing (they are the code itself) (using make and a compiler).\nBinary packages are already compiled for your achitecture and only need to be installed (using dpkg for example)\n", "Q: Deleting Crap necessary?

When I set the BIOS to boot from the IDE CD-ROM Device and try to start the machine I get the message: \"Strike F1 to retry reboot\" and \"No boot device available.\". Is the file I'm trying to boot from a \"bootable\" file? What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: You need to actually burn that ISO to DVD, since it will not fit on a CD, or createa bootable USB.  For the DVD, you can use ImgBurn, to get that accomplished, or just take a look at Install Ubuntu 13.04\n\nA: To create a bootable disk, find an application called Rufus and download it. I assume you're using Windows. After downloading the app, run it whilst you have a flash disk that you want to be bootable attached to your machine. Then it will prompt you to format the disk and make it bootable. Also, you need to specify the .iso image file that you want loaded onto the flash disk.\n\nIf you want to create a bootable disk in Ubuntu, find an app called Startup Disk Creator in your applist, or download it from Ubuntu Software Center.\n", "Q: Can MaaS Cluster Controller be on a VM I have limited number of servers and since it is a small setup it would be a waste to have a server dedicated to the cluster controller.\nI was wondering if it can be installed on a VM on my laptop so whenever I make changes I just turn it on and use it.\nIf that is possible could the cluster controller be moved to a physical server later when the environment gets larger?\n\nA: I am not an expert here, but I don't see a reason not to do this, as long as the VM gets a static IP. By having all the data on the VM, you actually gain an advantage by having the ability to move the VM to a more powerful machine if you need to, to without having to worry about migration the configuration DB or files.\nWith that being said, I am not sure how to actually migrate the VM's data to a physical server without having to redefine the cluster again.\nTip: The controller should not use much CPU, but In case you are using juju and you see the controller get bogged down due to \"nonce already used\" do this workaround: https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1190986\n", "Q: Determine how long the server was off, when it off and when it back on Is there an application i can install on my server so as to know (be notified ) that server has gone off and for how long it was off and also know the time it went on again.\nAm trying nagios but cant figure out that option. \nBetter still  an application to indicate network usage by graph between give time intervals and store logs for reference\n\nA: All you need to do is in the terminal just type the following:\nuptime\n\nIt shows you the current time and the very next thing is the duration (for how long your system has been running).\n", "Q: Can I open MS Office PowerPoint presentations in Ubuntu? If I install Ubuntu can I load and use my original Microsoft PowerPoint presentation on the Ubuntu OS and use the slideshow features to give a presentation?  Is it also possible to easily convert the Microsoft PowerPoint presentation into the Ubuntu format and present it that way.\n\nA: The use of Microsoft Power Point presentations is supported by default in Ubuntu. After a fresh installation you will also have Libre Office installed.\nThis office suite comes with Impress, a presentation software similar to Power Point. With Impress you can not only import and view presentations including slide shows but you will also be able to export your presentations to Power Point format for use in a Windows computer.\n\n*\n\n*Read more on Impress here: Libre Office - Impress\nHaving said that, we need to address possible issues than may arise from converting Power Point to Impress which eventually need some fine tuning after importing:\n\n*\n\n*special effects or transitions may not always work as expected\n\n*the page layout may vary when using fonts not available on Ubuntu (we can, however install the MS Core Fonts for free, and any other TTF fonts)\n\n*multiple images may not be perfectly arranged\n\nTherefore, and because we do not really know much on the presentations you have, the best approach is to just try this out. You do not have to install Ubuntu to do this. It is perfectly fine to boot your computer with an Ubuntu CD (or USB).\nInstead of installing choose to \"Try out Ubuntu\".\nYour hard drive will not be touched but you will have access to your local hard drives when opening them through the file browser Nautilus (folder icon on the left side launcher).\nYour Power Point presentations can then be opened on double click with Impress.\n", "Q: Can juju detect down service? I would like to have a MySQL separated on two servers with one being a master and the other a slave. Can juju detect if the master is down and promote the slave or would I have to do it manually?\n\nOK after playing around with this a little more I realized that adding a MySQL unit is not the same as adding a MySQL slave. In the gui it shows multiple instances of MySQL not slaves with relationship with master.\nWhat are these units that are being added? Backups or slaves? If they are slaves how can you tell which unit is the master? If the master reboots does one of the slaves become master?\n\nA: Adding more units of the mysql charm does not create slaves.\nTake a look at MySQL charm documentation. If you need to have master/slave replication, you need to deploy 2 instances of the mysql charm, e.g. one named \"mysql\" and the other \"mysql-slave\", then you need to add a relation between them. Using the command line, you can do it like this:\n# deploy second service\njuju deploy mysql mysql-slave\n\n# add master to slave relation\njuju add-relation mysql:master mysql-slave:slave\n\nIn the Juju GUI, you can do the same visually.\n", "Q: How can I get the vice C64 (commodore 64) emulator to work I want to play games on the vice emulator on Ubuntu 14.04. I have never managed to get vice working in Ubuntu. What are the steps needed to achieve this?\n\nA: To install vice with the default roms, you can\n\n\n*\n\n*Install vice from the system repos\nsudo apt-get install vice\n\n\n*Install the roms,\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the source tarball http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/index.html#download and extract it to /tmp\n\n*Run the following commands to copy over the data files,\nfind /tmp/vice-*/data \\\n  -mindepth 1 \\\n  -type d \\\n  -exec sudo cp -rnv {} /usr/lib/vice/ \\;\n\nnow you can use x64 and x64sc to run the bin files.\n\nA: update --- there is a new release now, 3.3, and as 3.2, works great.\nI managed to compile it with trial-and-errors adding the following libraries: \nsudo apt install xa65 libreadline-dev libxaw7-dev libgtkmm-3.0-dev libpulse-dev\n\nand compiled with \n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install \n\n...and it seems to work (the lib hack is not needed anymore). Seems a quite live project! \nOriginal content:\nYou can compile the native version pretty easily (well...).

In vanilla Ubuntu, there is a quite useful application called Nautilus-open-terminal, which allows the user to open the terminal in any folder by simply right-clicking and selecting \"Open in terminal\".\nLubuntu uses PCManFM, not Nautilus, so installing this program would be useless. Is there another way to achieve this right-click option?\n\nA: Edit (2015-05-06): Technically, as of when this answer was originally answered, the answer is \"No, you cannot add this functionality in any way\". However, this may mean I simply do not know if there is a way.\nAh, I finally noticed how PCManFM does it while watching a video review of said OS.\nTo open a terminal in a folder, simply move \"outside\" the folder, right-click on said folder, and the option to open folder in terminal will be in the right-click menu.\nFor example, say I want to open a terminal in my \"Downloads\" folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move \"outside\" or \"above\" the folder, which in this case would be my home folder, /home/lubuntuUsername\n\n*Right-click on the \"Downloads\" folder\n\n*Select \"Open in Terminal\"\n\n\nAfter following these steps, a terminal should open, with the path set as lubuntuUsername@computerName:~/Downloads$\n\nA: According to Add Open Folder as Root to PCMan File Manager's context menu ,\nyou can create terminal.desktop in ~/.local/share/file-manager/actions/\nAnd add content like this \n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Action\nTooltip=Open Terminal\nName=Open Terminal\nProfiles=profile-one;\nIcon=utilities-terminal\n\n\n[X-Action-Profile profile-one]\nMimeTypes=inode/directory;\nExec=deepin-terminal -w %f\nName=Default profile\n\nI use Deepin Terminal so my Exec is deepin-terminal -w %f. You should change this if you use other terminal. For example, you can use gnome-terminal --working-directory %f for Gnome Terminal.\n\nA: Out of the box functionally does not support this currently.\nHowever you can do this in one simple key stroke F4\n\nA: No you cannot access it via right click method.\nAlternative approach is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to that folder you want to open \n\n\n*\n\n*click on the 'Tools' menu.\n\n*There is an option to 'Open Current Folder In Terminal'\nalternatively you can go to that directory and use f4\ni assume you are using PcManFM, the default FM\n\nA: Well, given that Lubuntu is thought of as a \"lighter\" distro, we'll find quite a few favorite features totally missing or not where we'd expect them to be. In this specific case, if you navigate to a particular folder in PCManFM, please press F4 to open a terminal in the current folder.  (You can see the F4 option and others such as \"Open Current Folder as Root\" in the Menu, Tools dropdown of PCManFM.)\nThis doesn't mean that there isn't a way to add the \"open terminal here\" to PCManFM's right-click menu. But I don't know of one. Instead, I've installed Thunar, the file manager by default in Xubuntu, and that does have the option you want along with useful things like Custom actions.\n", "Q: Cannot import gnuradio.

Only the latter will be accessible without root permissions.\nDefine an autostart application in HOME\n1. Find autostart directory\nWe first need to know where out autostart directory resides. According to the X-Desktop specifications the location should be as follows:\n\nIf the same filename is located under multiple Autostart Directories only the file under the most important directory should be used.  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Example: If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set the Autostart Directory in the user's home directory is ~/.config/autostart/  \n  \n*Example: If $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is not set the system wide Autostart Directory is /etc/xdg/autostart/  \n  \n*Example: If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS are not set and the two files /etc/xdg/autostart/foo.desktop and ~/.config/autostart/foo.desktop exist then only the file ~/.config/autostart/foo.desktop will be used because ~/.config/autostart/ is more important than /etc/xdg/autostart/\n  \n\nIn a standard Ubuntu installation $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not defined. The autostart directory therefore resides in ~/.config/autostart. Any .desktop file located in this directory will start the corresponding application on login.\n2. Create the autostart directory if not present\nBefore we can populate the autostart directory we need to check for its presence, and eventually have to create it.\n3. Define .dektop file\nFor Unity and GNOME a minimum .desktop file will have the following content to enable autostarting an application:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=</path/to/application>\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName=<name of application>\n\nWe may distribute a template .desktop file with our application to copy it to or delete it from the autostart directory depending on user options set.\nDefine a system wide autostart application\nTo enable an autostarting application for all users we need to populate the system wide autostart directory (e.g. /etc/xdg/autostart) with our .desktop file.\nTo be able to do this from user options we need to temporarily allow root permissions. This can e.g. be done by calling a subprocess with pkexec from our settings dialog.\n\nSee also this related question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I start applications automatically on login?\n", "Q: How to set my Broadcom BCM4313 wireless card into AP mode? I've been trying to create an Access Point hotspot using hostapd, but I get an error message saying that my card doesn't support AP mode. I tried sudo iwconfig eth1 mode master and I get the following error:\nError for wireless request \"Set Mode\" (8B06) :\n    SET failed on device eth1 ; Invalid argument.\n\nHow do I get Ubuntu to recognize the card's AP mode function? Because it clearly supports Access Point mode as it works perfectly with Connectify on Windows.\nAs per the output of lspci | grep Wireless, my card is:\n03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11bgn Wireless Network Adapter (rev 01)\n\n\nA: Access Point mode Hotspot on BCM4313\nBCM4313 can operate on AP mode using brcmsmac driver, starting from 3.10 linux kernel onwards. For a very long time, BCM4313 didn't have AP mode support under any linux driver. But now, you got lucky, coz both AdHoc(IBSS) and AP mode have been implemented for brcmsmac. So, for making AP mode work for BCM4313, you need a linux kernel newer than 3.10. Use Ubuntu 12.04.5LTS, Ubuntu 14.04LTS or a newer release. If you're using a Ubuntu 12.04LTS version older than 12.04.5, install the package  linux-generic-lts-trusty . \nFor more details about upgrading 12.04LTS's kernel, visit this link.\nOnce you have a suitable kernel, make sure you are not running other Broadcom drivers like bcmwl-kernel-source,b43,etc. If yes, uninstall them. No need to explicitly install brcmsmac, as it is already a preinstalled module in the linux kernel. Now, create Access Point hotspot according to this answer.

It upgrades all packages within the distribution but does not upgrade to the next distribution.\nSo what you did is something you do not want to cancel, you will stay with 12.04.\n", "Q: running adb via wifi on ubuntu 13.04 First, im new on linux so please bear with me.\nI have a rooted android phone and i was able to run the adb via wifi network on windows, where i just need to go to the adb's directory and type adb connect.\nHowever, i can't just do that in my ubuntu. Everytime i enter adb connect, the terminal always said that i dont have the adb and i must install it. When i check the ADT Bundle (I downloaded the bundled one from here), i can see the adb is there inside the platform-tools folder.\nI already tried to change the directory to the platform-tools and run the adb connect from there, but its still not working.\nDo i need to install the adb again via terminal? Or did i miss something?\nYou may be wondering why dont i just download the adb (again) via terminal and do trial and error? The answer is because i dont have a good internet connection, so i want to avoid unnecessary downloads.\nThanks for your time :D\n\nA: The answer is easy enough, i just need to use ./adb connect instead of adb connect on ubuntu. Thanks :D\n\nA: First enable ADB over network on your android device by running Developer Options->ADB over network.\nOn Ubuntu terminal, goto the folder where sdk platform tools are installed, for example (change <user> for your username):\ncd /home/<user>/Android/Sdk/platform-tools\n\nthen run:\n./adb connect <host>:<port>\n\nyou will verify HOST and PORT on your android phone, when you enable adb over network.  For example:\n./adb connect 192.168.0.107:5555\n\nthen you must open Android Device Monitor (in Android Studio Tools->Android->Android Device Manager\nonce inside ADM, click on the down arrow under Devices and choose option Reset adb.  \nIn terminal, run adb connect again.

I want to install it from deb package so I need to find out what package contains that module.\nSometimes the solution for this task is pretty simple. For example if I need to install File::Find::Rule I just convert the name to lowercase, change :: to - and add lib to the beginning and -perl to the end.

You can pass file name to it and it will show you the package containing that file. It search not only the packages that are installed on your system, but also the package that are available for installation.\nTo find out the deb package that contains Debian::AptContents you should run: \n$ apt-file search Debian/AptContents.pm\ndh-make-perl: /usr/share/perl5/Debian/AptContents.pm\n\n\nA: You could use search at packages.ubuntu.com\nE.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=precise&searchon=contents&keywords=find%2Frule.pm\n\n*http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=precise&section=all&arch=any&keywords=aptcontents.pm&searchon=contents\n\nA: From a console whereis PACKAGE_OR_COMMON_FILE: it will print any occurrence of a system file.\nIf you have aptitude use: aptitude search PACKAGE_NAME.

Any idea why?\nAnd when I try to find the group by \ncat /etc/group | grep \"1096358339\"\n\nI do not get any output (also running sudo takes ages).\n\nA: It looks like your user has been added to an invalid group. Run grep {your username} /etc/passwd and your user-group number is the 4th field (usually a number just before your full name). In Ubuntu you should be in a group of the same name (and number) as your user. For you this is probably set to 1096358339 for some reason, so set it to be the same as the number in the 3rd column, which is your user number.\nAlso, if this is the case, you may need to fix your files after you change your group or they have invalid ownership.

I have recently placed an online order for Fujitsu Lifebook AH502\nThe laptop is yet to be delivered.\nI was about to download 64-bit Ubuntu 13.04, thinking that my laptop is 64 bit.\nBut this is AMD version. Does it make difference (that my laptop will be Intel)?\nOR should I download 32 bit version? Will it work better on my machine?\nIs there any other variant of Ubuntu that will work better on my machine?\n\nA: To answer in short: AMD64 (aka x86_64) refers to 64-bit architecture used by AMD as well as Intel (and VIA and few others too). It's called AMD64 only because AMD was first to come up with a 64-bit CPU architecture.\nSimilarly, Intel x86 refers to 32-bit implementations of Intel & AMD equally.\nWhat it implies for you: You can (and should) use the 64-bit version you downloaded even if the machine's using an Intel CPU. I'm using the same version on an Intel laptop.\nFor further info: check this Wikipedia page\n\nA: AMD is a x64bit architecture, so you definitely should download the 64bit version. However, in terms of the operation system version itself, if you really dig for the more improved and advanced features Ubuntu has to offer, just wait 90 more hours (4 days) for Ubuntu 13.10.

I do not have a very fast internet connection, so ideally I want to download Ubuntu with all of the packages I require so I can install them all from CD/DVD/USB without the need to use my internet connection for downloading additional packages. \nSpecifically, I need to ensure that I have all of the plugins required for video and audio playback, amongst others.\nWhat is the best suitable version to achieve this?\n\nA: I doubt there are any differences between Ubuntu versions, that make one more suitable than another for slow Internet connections.\nI think Debian has some versions on several disks that include more packages.\nUbuntu comes on a ~700 MB ISO, which can only hold so many packages. Even like that, it is not trivial to install from the Ubuntu CD.\n\nA: There used to be quite a few distros which included \"everything\" you needed to have Ubuntu running out of the box. It appears they've all been deprecated now. \nThere are ways to download needed packages to flash drives or CDs and to use those devices to install the software. If you're coming from the scenario that you're downloading a CD and taking it home to your computer, I am truly sorry but you're going to have to put a little more work into it. \nWe have a more detailed question regarding installing packages on Ubuntu without internet access which details how to install packages that are included on the Ubuntu installation media. Also this question detailing how to install packages that aren't on the Ubuntu installation media.\n\nA: I guess what \"This Guy\" here is looking for is Ubuntu based Distro with pre installed packages for audio and video playback. Not talking much, IMHO, I would suggest Best Match for You is \"Linux Mint\". It has in-built VLC installed with the Distro Installation. So you don't need to worry about audio video playback as well, plus its Ubuntu backend, Hope that helps. If you find this good enough, be kind to accept my answer. Enjoy.\n\nA: Well Ubuntu installation can be performed from DVD or USB whatever you prefer, made by the downloaded .iso from official website itself and it contains most of the required things like -\n\n\n*\n\n*After installation you don’t need to worry about anti-viruses as you need them in windows, Virus's can't affect Linux easily.\n\n*You don’t need to download any graphics drivers or any hardware drivers (in most of the cases excluding NVIDIA graphic card drivers etc).\n\n*You don’t need to download any Office like stuffs as in windows there is a 1 GB's installation setup for Microsoft Office , because Ubuntu comes with Libre-Office that really works nicely .\n\n*I have seen your profile ,you have mentioned that you are a C,C++ lang. developer so in Ubuntu you don't need to install any C compiler , just use gcc, and gcc+.\nSo completing your requirement there is only one package that you need to install that is Ubuntu-restricted-extras, that actually adds support for MP3 playback and decoding, support for various other audio formats (GStreamer plugins), Microsoft fonts, Java runtime environment, Flash plugin, LAME (to create compressed audio files), and DVD playback. \nSo basically, once you have installed Ubuntu you would need to get approximately 30MBs of data from the internet, which is probably small enough that you can download it with your mobile phone internet. \nIf you have fluctuating network then use terminal instead of Ubuntu-Software-Center because even after restart you can start downloading again with the same command:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nThat should be it. Hope I have explained what you want. Enjoy Ubuntu!\n\nA: The installation of the OS works without an internet connection. You can download all packages you want to install for your audio processing from the Ubuntu repositories in deb format and install them manually with\nsudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file\n\nfrom CDs or DVDs.\nNote that you have to download all dependencies as well so this is going to be a pretty tedious task and you have to be precise because you can't install your programs if even one dependency is missing.\n", "Q: How can I recover from accidental chown -R I am an Ubuntu newbie, and I accidentally typed chown www-data:www-data * -R.\nAfter a while, I tried to restart, but my computer couldn't even start, saying: \n# Your screen, graphics cards, and input device settings could not be detected correctly. \n# You will need to configure these yourself. \n\nthe command I executed is like this:\ncd /home\nsudo chown www-data:www-data * -R  \nsudo usermod -a -G www-data username\n\nIs there any way I can get out of this mess? Thank you\n\nA: Try booting using advanced settings, and do a system restore...there is an option for that on the ubuntu bootloader menu\n\nA: If you accidentally change the ownership of everything in /home and it contains only home directories named after their respective owners, then you can revert that change as root like this:\ncd /home\nchown root:root .\nfor f in *; do\n  case \"$f\" in\n    lost+found) owner=root:root;;\n    *) owner=\"$f:\";;\n  esac\n  chown -R \"$owner\" \"$f\"\ndone\n\nThere may be a few corner cases like configurational or temporary files of some subsystem like X.org or Pulse inside those directories, which should be owned by root or some system account, but they shouldn't be too much of a problem.\n", "Q: Run Eclipse on Nexus 7 with Ubuntu 13.04 Desktop I want to develop simply java app (without GUI) on my Nexus 7 (2012) running Ubuntu 13.04 and I have a question.\nI installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my Nexus 7 (2012), installed jdk-7u10-ea-fx-8_0_0-embedded-linux-arm-sfp.tar.gz.\nAfter this I downloaded Eclipse Standard 4.3.1, extracted it and tried to run the eclipse executable,but nothing happened.\nCan someone help me?\n\nA: Java is indeed a cross platform language and should work on any platform... but..\nEclipse uses native libraries for it's GUI toolkit ; it's likely you don't have a build of these compiled for ARM. The actual native binaries are encapsulated in the JAR files supplied ; this is why Eclipse bundles come in platform specific flavours, but the Eclipse foundation don't prepare ARM builds.\nIf you really want Eclipse on Ubuntu on ARM you'll have to build Eclipse, and it's native libraries, for ARM, yourself. I'm not sure as to how practical that is without a certain amount of research.\n", "Q: Error : no such partition I took an empty partition on my hard disk, and put it into a gtp??? file and made it primary.

Maybe the new drive snuck in front of your system drive.\n", "Q: Deja Dup gets stuck on \"Preparing...\" or \"Reading...\" (when backing up) A week ago, I upgraded to Ubuntu 13.10 (with deja-dup 27.3.1-0ubuntu1). Since then, Deja Dup hasn't been able to complete any backups.\nIt goes through Preparing, and in the beginning, it managed to get to Reading. Then, it would list 101 files in the details window. After that, the progress bar keeps spinning back and forth, but there's no disk nor network activity. The system monitor reports deja-dup as running, but the sub-process duplicity is sleeping. All the files it lists are small, most of them 1kb-1000kb.\nAfter an update(?) a few days ago, it can't even get past Preparing. Now, it doesen't start any subprocess, and it often freezes.\nWhat I've tried:\n-Giving it a empty backup destination and setting it to ignore the last file it lists. No difference.\n-When running \"deja-dup --backup\" in a terminal, I get a empty(white) window and no terminal output.\n-After I start the backup, I am unable to open the backup settings or to retry the backup until I reboot the computer. The same happens if I start, then cancel/postpone the backup before opening settings or restarting the backup.\n-I have also tried removing ~/.cache/deja-dup folder, but it doesn't seem to make any difference.\nAny idea how I can get it to work again? Or can anyone recommend a similar program?\n\nA: You could try this from a terminal to see what's going on:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have a look at file /tmp/deja-dup.log after running the following line and replicating the problem (the file gets written after the deja-dup exits):\nDEJA_DUP_DEBUG=1 deja-dup --backup > /tmp/deja-dup.log\n", "Q: \"E:Read error - read (5: Input/output error), E:The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.\" So I keep trying to install things on my laptop and whenever I try to use sudo apt-get I get the same errors every  time,\nSystemError: E:Read error - read (5: Input/output error), E:The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.\n\nAlso whenever I try to open software Center through my desktop Icon it will just freeze leaving me to force quit. \nIf I try to use the command software-center in my terminal I get the longest list in the world which is, \nche.open()\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/overrides/GLib.py\", line 629, in <lambda>\n    return (lambda data: callback(*data), user_data)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/db/pkginfo_impl/aptcache.py\", line 261, in open\n    self._cache = apt.Cache(progress)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/apt/cache.py\", line 105, in __init__\n    self.open(progress)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/apt/cache.py\", line 150, in open\n    self._cache = apt_pkg.Cache(progress)\nSystemError: E:Read error - read (5: Input/output error), E:The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.\n2013-10-13 10:13:52,685 - softwarecenter.db.pkginfo_impl.aptcache - INFO - aptcache.open()\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/overrides/GLib.py\", line 629, in <lambda>\n    return (lambda data: callback(*data), user_data)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/db/pkginfo_impl/aptcache.py\", line 261, in open\n    self._cache = apt.Cache(progress)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/apt/cache.py\", line 105, in __init__\n    self.open(progress)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/apt/cache.py\", line 150, in open\n    self._cache = apt_pkg.Cache(progress)\nSystemError: E:Read error - read (5: Input/output error), E:The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.\n2013-10-13 10:13:57,365 - softwarecenter.db.pkginfo_impl.aptcache - INFO - aptcache.open()\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/overrides/GLib.py\", line 629, in <lambda>\n    return (lambda data: callback(*data), user_data)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/db/pkginfo_impl/aptcache.py\", line 261, in open\n    self._cache = apt.Cache(progress)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/apt/cache.py\", line 105, in __init__\n    self.open(progress)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/apt/cache.py\", line 150, in open\n    self._cache = apt_pkg.Cache(progress)\nSystemError: E:Read error - read (5: Input/output error), E:The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.\n\nThat's only about one-tenth of the list which is too long to read.

You can set your PC to always boot from USB first if there is one present.\nIn the case you give, are you sure that your USB stick properly has a bootable OS on it?

In this case you sometimes you can't even see the window that moved off-screen, so you can't use the Alt + Drag method as you have no part of the window to grab onto (please correct me if this is inaccurate information and I was wrong). This method places the window somewhere you can see, so you can now resize and move the window again.\n\nA: Try to press alt (keep it pressed) and then click with the mouse on the window and move it. \nAlso, try alt + spacebar, move (or m), and move it with the arrows.\nAny result?\n", "Q: Can't write/delete to external usb 12.04 ubuntu I'm not a computer guru but I do like the ethos of open source so I use Ubuntu for day to day stuff. My interest is photography and I have a large external drive with all my pictures on it. \nRecently my wife pulled the usb out of the computer without unmounting it. \nI've tried several of the suggestions here and on Google without luck.\nchmod 777 -R\nchown root:user /meida/Hd-drive\n\nIt's fat32 file system.\nWhen I try to delete files on the USB it says it's read only file system.\nReformatting isn't an option as all my pics are stored there (a hard lesson for the future).\n\nA: You could treat your photo archive's sudden status as a read-only disk, as an opportunity to buy a backup disk, and make a copy!\nfsck is the repair tool you were looking for. First, some info. In a terminal window run mount|grep media. It will print something like\n/dev/sdb1 on /media/user/HD-drive type vfat (followed by some noise)\n\nAnd maybe other disks as well. You're looking for the device ID corresponding to your mounted drive, /dev/sdb1 in my example. Next, unmount the disk and run the repair tool.\nsudo umount /media/user/HD-drive\nsudo fsck.vfat -a -l /dev/sdb1\n\nwhere /dev/sdb1 is the device discovered earlier (and probably will be not exactly the same on your system). fsck will attempt to fix anything broken on your drive, and will list names of any files it found remarkable. Make a note of the file names, if any.\nWith any luck your disk will be fine now. Wait a minute after fsck completes, unplug it, and plug it back in. Though the disk (should) look healthy now, some files may be damaged. You may want to come back and ask for tips detecting damage, just for peace of mind. Be sure to check any files fsck may have mentioned.\nPersonally I would hie me off to get a backup disk, make a copy, and only then attempt the recovery process above. Any files you find were damaged, you may be able to copy back to the original disk from the pre-fix copy you just made. Unlikely but possible. Keep both disks then, and use the original for your working copy for a while, until you're pretty confident it's in good shape and the pre-fix copy is no longer helpful. Once you've reached that point, copy the original disk back over the copy, and begin using the copy as an active backup.\n", "Q: How to install the grub image on a bios_grub partition and esp at the same time? I need this to boot from portable GPT hdd on computers of both types(BIOS and EFI).\n\nA: Using GRUB for both modes can be problematic, because the grub.cfg file may need to be subtly different for the two modes -- or at least, I've seen problem reports from people who try to use the same file in both modes. Thus, I recommend using one boot loader in BIOS mode and another one in EFI mode. It's likely to be easiest to set up GRUB in BIOS mode and another boot loader for EFI mode. See my Web page on the topic for a rundown of what's available. rEFInd is likely to be the easiest to set up and manage, but ELILO can work well, too, if you're comfortable with a LILO-style configuration file.\n", "Q: Nemo 2.0 does not render desktop correctly with Compiz I am using Ubuntu without Unity but with Compizan Nemo as file manager. Since the update to Nemo 2.0 it does not render the desktop correctly anymore. \nInstead of the background picture I see a black background and every window movement leaves a strange effect on the desktop:\n\nIs this is a bug? Where to post Nemo bugs. Does someone know a workaround?\nEDIT: I have created a bug report here.\nThe problem is, that in Nemo 2.0 it's capability to render the desktop was removed. See here\n\nA: Cinnamon is causing problems when running Nemo desktop under Unity. You have to completely remove both packages, add the Nemo only PPA from NoobsLab, the Backports and Cinnamon repositories install Cinnamon packages along with Nemo, finally reinstall and configure Nemo. \nHere are the steps that I followed to get Nemo installed independently:\n\n\n*\n\n*Completely remove Nemo and Cinnamon\nsudo apt-get --purge remove nemo cinnamon\n\n*Make sure all packages are removed by using Synaptic Package Manager\n(there is probably a way to use regex with the apt-get remove command\nbut I am not comfortable enough to try that) Note: I did this\nbecause some packages were not automatically removed using apt-get, I\nsearched for both Cinnamon and Nemo to manually select any packages\ninstalled for either package then used the completely remove\noption.\n\n*Purge all entries for Cinnamon and Nemo from the compiz settings\ndatabase\ndconf reset -f /org/cinnamon/\ndconf reset -f /org/nemo/\n\n*Add the NoobsLab PPA and install Nemo Version 5.0~raring~NoobsLab.com\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/nemo\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nemo nemo-fileroller\n\n*Add Nemo to the mime defaults\nxdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory application/x-gnome-saved-search\n\n*Nemo by default is set to handle the desktop but Nautilus overrides that so just disable Nautilus\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\nVoilà! Nemo is happily taking care of your desktop again!\n\nUpdate:\nIf your desktop is black when you first login:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Startup Applications (dash->Startup Applications) \n\n*Click \"Add\"\n\n*\n\n*Name: Nemo\n\n*Command: nemo -n\n\n*Comment: Start the Nemo Desktop Manager\n\n\n\nReboot and Nemo will start\n\nA: Since I had originally installed nemo following the instructions listed here:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2012/12/how-to-install-nemo-file-manager-in.html\nI reversed it using ppa-purge instead of manually hunting down all the packages:\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable\n\nAfter that I followed Andy Braham's instructions to used the NoobsLabs PPA for Nemo.\n\nA: I had what I think was a closely related problem.  I am running Gnome Shell in Quantal 12.10 and loaded Nemo to replace Nautilus.  Unfortunately, I don't recall how I installed it.\nAfter a while, my desktop failed to render properly.  It looked strange; as-if the theme had been lost.  The Look-and-Feel of Gnome Shell was gone.  The colors made editing filenames on icons impossible.  There were a number of other major annoyances.\nI followed Andy Braham's advice (from the accepted answer) to remove the software.  But then I followed the Noob Labs's blog posting http://www.noobslab.com/2013/10/nemo-file-manager-with-extensions-for.html to reinstall Nemo.\nAfter a reboot, the problem was resolved.  I hope it stays resolved.  But I'm not sure, since I saw the problem come and go (mostly come and stay) prior to the fix.\n[It really seems that Ubuntu is fragmenting into either a) an unacceptably de-featured desktop OS; or b) a difficult to configure desktop OS.  Hopefully that will improve eventually.]\n\nA: I had the same problem, but got it working now with nemo 2.2.1.\nWhat I did was\n\n\n*\n\n*purge cinnamon-daily completely as mentioned by user114408\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-daily\n\n\n*follow all steps as mentioned by Andy Braham including the update, except I used http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/nemo/ubuntu instead of noobslab.\nI don't have the glitch anymore. I will try install cinnamon again (stable version this time) and if the problem comes back I'll post it here. But since you aren't using cinnamon, the above should work. Worked for me in Ubuntu 14.04 anyway.\n", "Q: end_request i/o error, dev sdc sector xxxx - SSD crash?

The device is specified by the port to which it is attached, and optionally an address (daisy) on the daisy chain of devices on that port.\n\nExample\nA printer setup tool detects an HP LaserJet 3390 on the local USB by getting the following IEEE-1284 device ID:\nMFG:Hewlett-Packard;\nCMD:PJL,PML,MLC,POSTSCRIPT,PCLXL,PCL;\nMDL:HP LaserJet 3390;\nCLS:PRINTER;\nDES:Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 3390;\nMEM:MEM=53MB;\n1284.4DL:4d,4e,1;\nCOMMENT:RES=1200x1;\nBy the way there is also an on-line database that can be accesses using wget: https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/Database/Query\n\nA: Yes, Linux (as well as Windows) is usually able to identify devices without the help of an operator. In addition it has (generic) drivers for many common devices, which Ubuntu ships by default, and there are programs running in the background watching for new devices, that need their driver loaded. Windows does roughly the same thing.\nThe main difference are their sets of shipped device drivers. I wouldn't say that either Linux or Windows have a larger set of drivers, but it's not unusual to find a device which runs out of the box on one but not the other.\n\nA: Answer is yes. Unlike Windows, Ubuntu can detect any kind of device without installing prior device drivers externally. It has got all kinds of Generic drivers inbuilt which are required on daily purpose.\n", "Q: Error installing Ubuntu via wubi on Windows 8 I get this error:\nCouldn't retrieve files from disk image\n\nwhen installing via Wubi from an Ubuntu ISO CD which I previously downloaded.\nHere's my error log file.

I've been running a dual boot setup for over a year. I recently moved to 13.04.

I am not sure what to do. I've tried looking for the initrd file or something, but I can't seem to find my linux partitions...\nThanks!\n\nA: It can be your display driver problem. maybe after updating your system the newest driver is not matched with our vga. Try uninstall your display driver and reinstall it. \n", "Q: What does \"./\" mean in linux shell? What does the command ./ mean? For example, sometimes we call a file with ./config, sometimes ../config, thanks\n\nA: ./config means you're calling something in the current working directory. In this case config is an executable. You have to specify the path for executables if they're outside your $PATH variable and that's why config isn't enough.\n../config would be used if the config executable were in the parent of the current working directory. \n", "Q: What's a dead ogonek, and where is it on my keyboard? I was changing a shortcut on gnome terminal and I found that:\n\nWhat is it?\n\nA: An ogonek is an diacritic mark that looks like a right-facing hook placed underneath a letter. It originates from central European languages such as Polish and Lithuanian.\nĄĘĮǪŲY̨ ąęį ǫųy̨\nA dead key is a key that doesn't insert any character when you press it, but affects the next character you type. Dead keys add an accent to the next letter. So if you press dead ˛ then A, you get the character Ą.\nIt's weird to have a shortcut on this key. Unless your keyboard layout is meant for a language that uses this accent, you wouldn't have this key.\n\nA: I've never heard about this \"dead ogonek\", but I googled something for you, which may probably be helpful:\nHere you can find the explaination of a keyboard dead-key: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key\nAnd here what does \"ogonek\" mean: http://www.personal.psu.edu/ejp10/blogs/gotunicode/2009/01/ogonek-vs-cedilla-accent.html\n\nA: There are so called \"dead\" keys which do not produce a character when typing but are used to put diacritics such as accents on characters.\nOne of these diacritics is the Ogonek, or \"Nasal Hook\", below shown for the letter O:\nǪ\n", "Q: Borderless windows but keep title bar I don't really like the look of the borders on the windows of applications I'm running. I've tried disabling window decorator, but that takes away the title bar and shadow as well. Ideally, I would like to see it as described in this article, where they include the following image:\n\n\nA: This is possible by editing the metacity file of the theme you're using.

Download the deb or rpm from https://www.trillian.im/get/linux/6.1/linux.html\n\nA: The \"Additional Chat Protocols for Thunderbird\" addon is not supported in Thunderbird 24.0, the default version in Ubuntu. You can either downgrade your Thunderbird version, or use another IM client such as Pidgin. Pidgin supports many protocols and integrates very well with the Ubuntu UI.\nThunderbird chat supports the XMPP protocol. See whether the service you want to use supports XMPP.\n\nA: Empathy and Pidgin are popular choices for multi-protocol instant messaging clients in Ubuntu Linux. They're both based on the same library libpurple and therefore roughly the same features.\nUnfortunately there is no FOSS solution for Skype without the proprietary client, because Skype doesn't allow that.\n", "Q: vim-airline status bar not shown when only single file is open I am recently start using Vim (Vim-gnome) and also use plugin vim-airline.

After upgrade from 13.04 I'm not able to switch languages with Caps Lock.\nLooks like upgrade broke previous settings (annoying). How do you make Caps Lock switch languages again using UI Settings? setxkbmap magic is not suitable.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 13.04 this was simple: go to System Setting → Keyboard Layout → Options → Key(s) to change layout and tick Caps Lock:\n\nBut in Ubuntu 13.10, Keyboard Layout, now called Text Entry, has undergone many changes, and for the moment, until a  a correct fix for this bug will be released, is a little bit more complicated to switch input language with Caps Lock.\nAfter I added the following PPA to my list of sources using the following command:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:attente/1218322\n\nand after I upgraded my system using:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nI was able to change the default Super+Space keyboard shortcut to Caps Lock:\n\nMany thanks to William Hua (attente) for his Input source switching PPA.

It either produced a popup window informing of a crash, or no output at all.\nThe only way I got it fixed was thanks to @braiam who told me to delete /etc/X11/xorg.conf and reboot, which finally fixed it.\nIf @braiam is willing to write an answer, I will accept that instead of this of mine.\n", "Q: Brother HL-2240 printer driver Where can I find a good driver for a brother hl-2240 printer.

I am moving my Ubuntu box to a new hardware and for that i must clone the entire harddisk to a new one.\nI have read about clonezilla and dd but i am unsure how to use them.\nI could also hook up both harddisks to a windows machine and clone there.\nWhat is the best way to do that?\n\nA: To me, the 'best' most version agnostic way to switch an install between system is to dump out the package list on your old system, and copy over configuration files. (and yes, for disclosure's sake, this is identical to my serverfault answer)\nuse dpkg --get-selections to dump out a list of installed packages, and install them with dpkg --set-selections. Create the same users as the source system if necessary - cat /etc/passwd should list them out, and you can check with diff to see if the two lists are identical. \nThen use rsync or some other tool to duplicate your /etc/ folder for settings, various /home/ folders for users (and check permissions here) and other folders like /var/www/. Test, make sure everything's there, and you're done. Takes me less time than to set up a fresh system.  \nIts currently in limbo, but if you're running an older version of ubuntu, remastersys would have done a good job creating a livecd identical to a running install. Someone else is working on taking over development, and I'll be updating this answer when it is.\nBoth these options give a good deal more flexibility than imaging\n\nA: Are you sure that you want to clone the entire hard disk since you are switching hardware?  (I have never personally tried to clone a hard drive between different hardware, but I imagine there might be problems.)\nA better approach might be to do a clean install of ubuntu on your new hardware - that way all your new hardware will be autodetected and properly configured. Let's say your old computer is A, and your new one is B. Once you have clean ubuntu on B, connect both computers to the same network. Then you can use rcp (faster but unencrypted) or scp (encrypted but slower) to copy only your home directory from A to B. The command that you run on B will look something like this:\nscp -r <user>@<ip.address.of.A>:/home/<user>/* /home/<user>/\n\n(Note you would have to have sshd running on A to execute this command)\nBy copying your home directory, you will get all of your Documents and hopefully development stuff copied over. You will also get the application settings from A that are stored in your home folder in dotfiles. You will have to reinstall the software that you had on A, but with a package manager and a relatively fast internet connection, it isn't a big deal. I routinely use this approach for new installations. In fact, now I just have a dedicated hard drive partition for my home directory, and whenever I install a new distro, I simply mount that partition as my home directory. It works pretty well.\nAlso note that if you do decide to copy the whole drive, clonezilla is very easy to use. You basically make a live CD or USB of it like you would with ubuntu, and then when you boot using that live CD, it just takes you through a guided set of steps to copy the hard drive. I've used it two or three times to make complete backups and it's not tough at all.\n", "Q: ATI Mobility Radeon M82/M86/RS780M I have a HP Pavilion dv5-1200eo Entertainment Notebook PC with ATI Mobility Radeon M82/M86/RS780M and I haven't been able to find any working drivers for it.\nIt is overheating and working poorly.

(With some performance impact)\nOn a side note, if somebody could also tell me (in the comments) if the amd fx-6300 is compatible with xen, that would be great. (It does support virtualization, but I know with intel, there is Vt-d and Vt-x, and I'm not sure if it matters with AMD though..)\n\nA: With modern (2006 or so) hardware, virtualization is easier, safer, more convenient, you name it; I don't know why anyone would duel* boot any more, if they have more than minimal hardware. There are many hypervisors to choose from. I understand Xen is a fine choice, though I have no personal experience with it. I have used VirtualBox and VMware. I prefer the former.\n(* Yes that's a joke, for those of us who can spell.)\nYou do indeed run both OSes simultaneously. You'll boot to the primary (host) OS, and when you want, launch an application to install or run guest OSes. The guest(s) will run in their own windows, much like any application. Guests can be constrained to run in a reduced portion of your hardware. On a four core, 8GB machine guests can be made to run as a two (or one!) core machine with 2GB of RAM, and they will run just so, with nearly the same performance as they would on raw metal with those specs. Their \"hard disk,\" by the way, will be a file, a very large file, in your host OS's file system.\nJust a couple of things to look out for. You really do want hardware that supports hardware virtualization (VT-x on Intel, AMD-V on AMD chips). Some hypervisors (like Xen) can run specially modified guest OSes on lesser CPUs, and that's commendable, but you'll be happier with hardware support. You'll need RAM enough to cede to the guest OS. Find the option to allow guest OSes to run in (host) swap space and turn it off. Allocate enough RAM to the guest that it won't need to swap internally: 2GB minimum for Ubuntu with Unity or Windows Vista. Windows XP and just about any other Linux OS/Desktop will run fine in 1GB. (Xubuntu for example works fine in 1GB, if you don't make great demands on it from within.) In any case you can probably adjust the RAM and CPU afterward. Also I suggest allocating all disk space for the guest OS's hard disk image up front when you install the guest, when you're given a choice of doing that or allowing it to grow.\nAh! Harrumph -- I should say that video performance will suffer in the guest. Gaming and 3D won't work well. Even so, on my desktop box with oomph, where I keep Flash confined to a guest OS, streaming video on Flash is entirely watchable full screen.\n", "Q: booting off a usb drive once i click the usb drive to boot off of it says \n\"SYSLINUX 4.06 EDD 2012-10-13 Copyright (C) 1994-1012 H.

When creating the virtual machine and selecting the ISO file, VMWare automatically detected the Ubuntu operating system and suggested using Easy Install. I'm not sure why this did not work for you.\nI am guessing that you created a new virtual machine and called it 'Ubuntu 13.04', even if you did not yet install Ubuntu 13.04. To install Ubuntu on this machine, you will need to mount the Ubuntu ISO file into its virtual CD player.\nOne way to do this is to select your virtual machine and press 'Edit virtual machine settings'. Then, select 'CD/DVD (sata)' from the menu on the left. Select 'Use ISO file' on the right, browse and select the ISO file that you downloaded. You should now boot from the Ubuntu live disk from where you can install the operating system.\nIf this still does not work, your downloaded ISO file could be corrupt. This would explain why VMWare did not recognise the ISO file. An indication could simply be the file size of the ISO file, which should be 785MB for the 64 bit version and approximately the same for the 32 bit version. If your file is significantly smaller, your download was probably interrupted.\n", "Q: Backup Server docs and sql files with Grive Has anyone ever used Grive for Ubuntu Server backs up to Google Drive?\nHow safe would this be? \n(Not sure if my \"anti-google\" boss would like it too much but still)\n\nA: Grive is not the first tool that would try to use google drive space as a remote backup tool; it started with one that used gmail+fuse to emulate a disk drive on mails.\nHow safe would it be?

Preferably with a bash or with keyboard. This will be used when watching a video on the primary screen and not needed the other 2 monitors. IE the setup I have in windows is a program that allows me to \"blank\" any monitors i want with a keyboard shortcut.

I had a bad php script running that basically opened up for a mysql injection. And because of a stupid configuration from my side this mysql injection ended with a escalation exploit where the person gained access to everything.\nI managed to catch this in time and backed up my stuff and wiped the server.\nSo, i've re-installed and re-evaluated everything i thought i knew and started from scratch.\nWhat do i have running ... well.\n\n\n*\n\n*apache2 2.2.22\n\n*php5 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.8 with Suhosin Patch 0.9.10)\n\n*mysql-server \n\n*postfix \n\n*ssh \n\n*iptables\n\n\nI've installed all of these individually, i didn't do \"apt-get install lamp\". apt-get install ssh apache2 mysql-server php5 php5-mysql postfix iptables ... is pretty much it i think.\nFor apache2, i've followed a few guides which i can't seem to find among my 300+ tabs in firefox. I'm sure there must be some more stuff i need to do to fully secure apache.\nFor php5 i made sure i installed suhosin patch and i followed a guide or two where i edited the config. I'm sure there must be something here as well that i could do to protect myself.\nMy mysql server is set up to only accept from localhost. I use ssh tunnel to be able to connect to it with navicat so i can do backups and such. I've made sure that all users besides root does not have any server privileges, this was what screwed the pooch the last time (yes i know, silly me ... i had completely forgotten that i had used a user in the past to remote connect then used that for something else which then let to the escalation exploit). And i've added a line in the config that stops mysql from being able to load local files into tables and such. Either way ... i feel that i've done what i can with mysql server for now.\nPostfix was a default install, i did nothing. I later uninstalled it because i did not find a suitable guide for it. And i saw so many said that postfix is a disaster to configure and if left in default state, you are begging for a hack. Or so they said... shrugs\nWhat i've done so far is secured ssh by running it on a alternative port and i've used puttygen to generate a rsa key with 4096bit encryption with a passphrase. I've disabled root login via ssh config and pam. The only way to log in to ssh now is via the rsa pubkey using the key i generated. And this works really great. And i feel confident that ssh is secure now. No way in without the private key and the password as far as i understand.\niptables, well, every server needs iptables. I have a bunch of ip's i've blocked. And probably more to be blocked in the future.\nAlright ... soo, now on my freshly installed server, i've managed to revert almost everything. I have removed the php page that was the entry point for the hacker and i've used a clean install of files for my SMF forum software. I've kept the attachments of the forum though as they were an important part of my forum. Basically i'm ready to boot up my forum with the old database and force all users to change passwords.\nNow, the hacker, is a former forum user on my forum. So i sort of know him. He saw hacking my server as a gift to me so i could clean up the security hole. Now this might be so ... it has indeed made me more security aware. So much so that i've spent almost 2 weeks non-stop reading up on the internet about how to secure these services that i am running.\nNow, with my freshly installed server, i get a private message over steam from the same guy (the hacker), stating he found another loop hole, but he's not going to tell me what it is this time because i iptabled him and his VPN.\nThe guy feels that he should be rewarded for breaking into my server. Personally, if a person breaks in, you don't offer him cake and coffee. You break his legs ... then call the cops. coughs\nAnyway, this brings me to postfix. I installed this because i don't want to pay for a mail delivery system for my forum when all i need to do is send a few emails a day. It's not a huge forum, so the odd chance is that the only times i will send a lot of emails is when i do newsletters to my 250+ members.\nI feel sure that apache, php5 and ssh are secure. And i feel secure that my wordpress frontpage and SMF forum are secure as well (i uninstalled almost all most and went with only the most basic mods). Like i said, all files are fresh but my attachments from the SMF forum.\nBut i feel that i might be getting trolled here.\nThough i might be wrong ...\nI am in need of a postfix service tho, just so the forum can send mail. I don't need to recieve any. So i'm wondering, can i keep postfix with default settings? Or will these open me for attack?\nThe guy, like i said, is either trolling me because he wants me to be more paranoid or he's telling me the truth.\nCould anyone shed some light here?\nI mean, apache, php, mysql and ssh seem secure. If there are more php files laying around that he can mysql intject into, then he at least won't get far as none of the users have grant, nor do they have server privileges. So i'm guessing the postfix is his entry point? Or am i just being trolled?\n\nA: They're talking to you over Steam? Talk to the police and ask them to talk to Valve. At the very very least you could hope they lose a Steam account and associated games.\nProactive disclosure is one thing, but making a hole and then saying you can do it all over again is criminal extortion.\nAdditionally I'd have an introductory conversation with a lawyer for pressing civil action against the user (if identification could be plausible through subpoena). Work out how much your time has been worth and the time for a professional to audit your server (now they've done untold things to it) and multiply that by three and sue them for that.\n\nSecurity wise, I'd put money on it being one of your sites. Even more so if you've just ripped them off your old installation and stuck them (or their data) on your new server. The attacker has had, one assumes, write access to all your databases. You don't know what rights they have on your sites. It's possible, if not likely given that they're coming back, that they've added new vulnerabilities to conveniently close for you now.\nI'd look at service migration. Find a different forum and use that. Check the admin accounts. Check uploaded files and their permissions. Delete abandoned accounts.\nIn terms of raw access, the only things people can access externally should be the webserver and the non-standard SSH port. Postfix does not need to be externally accessible to send email. And I'd use ufw than trying to manually feed rules into iptables. People make silly mistakes with iptables; ufw is just a lot easier to understand.\nMany mailer services (MailChimp for one) have free tariffs for low-usage which it would seem you are within.\nYou should have fail2ban running so brute SSH attacks are IP-blocked.\nKeep better logs and copy them offsite regularly. When somebody has broken in, look for the intrusion. Find out what it was.\nI would perhaps go one further and separate out your services. Virtualise your sites into individual containers (docker, lxc, etc). You'll use ~50MB more RAM per site in overhead but one site going down won't tank the server. Quite the opposite, you'll find out which site has the hole.\n\nI feel like I would know what to do in a situation like this but it would take me a lot of time and a lot of stress. I host servers and I've had quite a lot of experience with Ubuntu since I started using it many years ago... \n...But even I would consider talking to a professional about auditing my server.

No offence intended, you're out of your depth and you need more than community help.\n", "Q: Can't redirect standard output I'm following along with the examples in Chapter 6 Redirection of The Linux Command Line (2012).  I am trying to redirect the standard output of an ls command to a text file.  I keep receiving a permission denied error. I'm using Ubuntu 13.04.  See below:\nta2tyrants@Vaio:/$ ls -l /usr/bin >> ls-output.txt\nbash: ls-output.txt: Permission denied\n\nI tried to run this command using root access and get the same error:\nta2tyrants@Vaio:/$ sudo ls -l /usr/bin >> ls-output.txt\nbash: ls-output.txt: Permission denied\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Is there a way to get around this?\n\nA: Solution 1: redirect to a file you can write to\nYour current working directory is /, which by default can only be modified by root. Type cd ~ to change to your home folder, or cd followed by the path to a directory you can write to, then do it again.\nSolution 2: redirect with sh under sudo\nShell redirections are not passed along to programs. This means that even if execute a program under sudo, redirection (like >>) will still be performed under your account. This is what happens:\n  sudo         ls -l /usr/bin         >>/ls-output.txt\n-------------------------------------------------------\n|     execute external program      | redirect stdout |       what your shell sees\n| sudo | command to execute as root |                            what sudo sees\n\nIf you want to sudo a redirect, you need to run a shell as root. You can do this:\n     sudo         sh   -c '      ls -l /usr/bin           >>/ls-output.txt   '\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|      execute external program (pass the single-quoted string verbatim)      | your shell\n|    sudo       |                command to execute as root                   |    sudo\n                | sh | -c | execute external program |    redirect stdout     | root shell\n\nThat way, the redirect is part of a sh invocation that is done under sudo.\nSolution 3: redirect with tee under sudo\nAs Oli♦ suggested, you can also pipe your command into tee:\n       ls -l /usr/bin          |     sudo        tee /ls-output.txt\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| execute external program | pipe |      execute external program       | your shell\n                                  |  sudo  | command to execute as root |    sudo\n\nNote that the tee is executed under sudo, but not the ls. This is because tee needs root priveleges (to write to /ls-output.txt), and ls does not. If the program generating output did need root privileges, you would need to sudo both of them.\n   sudo        ls -l /root              |    sudo        tee /ls-output.txt\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|     execute external program      | pipe |     execute external program      | your shell\n| sudo | command to execute as root |                                             sudo #1\n                                           | sudo | command to execute as root |  sudo #2\n\nAlso, if you don't want the output displayed on the screen, you can add >/dev/null to the very end of the line.\n", "Q: Back up a 12.04 system, then upgrade to 13.04 using a liveusb, then restore backup to regain files. Does that work? i'm getting ready to upgrade my 12.04 install to 13.04, but i have seriously personalized my system with external PPAs, Ubuntu Tweak, and the like. I backed up my system with Deja-Dup, and I was wondering if once my upgrade is finished, i can get all my settings back in 13.04 by restoring from Deja-Dup.  Will it even be able to restore? Anyway, it's not a huge deal if it can't. I'm still going to upgrade.  I have all the important stuff safe.  It would just be a pain if i had to set up all my settings again.  If you got any ideas, please say.  I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.\n\nA: Short answer is no! Don't rely on Deja Dup. You are better off saving all files manually and then putting them back after your install. Here's what happened to me at the weekend:\nI did a full deja dup back up on 12.04, selecting a tried and trusted external HD as backup location. No encryption on the back up. Then I did a clean install of 13.04. \nMy first action after successful install was to restore from deja dup. No can do! It says \"no backups to restore\". \nA look at the relevant folder in the drive shows it contains 1007 volumes of difftar.gz archived files but deja dup, which created these, does not recognise them. \nI have been trying to get to the data through the command terminal but all commands are met with responses like \"Command line error: Expected 2 args, got 0\"\nI may be able to get at this data by manual unarchiving each of the 1007 volumes but imagine the time and hassle....    \nPerhaps I have done something fundamentally wrong (i.e. just followed the deja dup directions). If anyone has advice it would be much appreciated. \n\nA: This worked fine for me, moving from 13.10 to 14.04.  The part about cloud backup using Copy.com is not necessary or required, but it's a nice additional safeguard and free.  Also encrypted.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up Copy.com (or other choice of free cloud backup utility) to sync a folder on my Ubuntu machine.  Create softlinks in that folder of any files which need more immediate or constant backup -- they don't actually have to be moved into the folder since links accomplish the backup just as well.  You can, however, move files into the sync folder if you really want them to exist only in your cloud backup and its local sync copies on whatever machines you set up.\n\n*Create a machine-specific named backup folder for each of your machines inside of the cloud sync folder.  On each of your machines, configure the ubuntu backup utility to backup your home folder to the corresponding backup folder inside the cloud sync folder.\n\n*Many common apps cause slight problems with the backup app by unnecessarily setting the wrong permissions on hidden folders inside of your home folder. In most cases you can safely chown -R foo:foo ~ where foo is your username and typically your user group name.  That will set all permissions recursively under your home folder such that backups will not fail for that reason.\n\n*Now your regular ubuntu backups will be made and also the backup files themselves will be further backed up to the cloud. \n\n*One other suggestion is to add /usr/share/fonts to your backup settings since it's no fun to go and re-download all of your preferred extra fonts after a system reinstall.\n\n*At this point you can safely do a clean install of Ubuntu, like from a USB stick (recommended... just use the built-in System Disk Creator which finally works this year, no longer necessary to reach for Unetbootin, though that still works too).\n\n*From the clean install, you will of course lose all your installed software and solutions for making that easier is the subject of some other post.  But as far as your personal data (and fonts, if you choose), just set up Copy.com or your choice of cloud sync as one of the first things you do with the clean new system, then do the same ubuntu backup settings config as before.  As soon as your initial sync completes, the ubuntu backup utility is ready to restore your home folder just as you had it before the system install.  Do make intelligent choices at this point if there are config file conflicts; in some cases you may want to accept the new versions of certain files if your new OS version has made certain types of changes.  But that's beyond the scope of this answer.\nGood luck and enjoy the resilience and safe recovery that this brings.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 and MacBook 4,1 wireless problem; NO wired connection I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 to dual boot with OS X Lion on my MacBook 4,1 (early 2008). Wireless doesn't work. Ubuntu knows--get the Broadcom driver, right? Sure, but the problem is I'm tethered to an iPhone and thus have no access to a wired connection to download it in Ubuntu! So my question is how do I download the driver on OS X and install it in Ubuntu?\nUPDATE 1: I followed the instructions here, had problems the first time I tried it (gave me a big screen full of text and had to restart), and now get the text \"Invalid ROM contents\" before the Ubuntu desktop loads. Wireless still does not work.\nAny solutions?\nUPDATE 2: I just tried following instructions here and here. Didn't work! For some reason it can't get anything from the install media. It seems like certain files are missing or don't work and certain options are just unavailable. With Broadcom's own instructions, I get \"Operation not permitted\" on the Terminal commands under step 2 of the instructions for a fresh installation.\nThere has to be an answer!\nUPDATE 3: I am able to connect to the internet briefly with Ubuntu using Bluetooth to tether. The connection is intermittent, only staying on for a few seconds before disconnecting and connecting again. I can visit web pages but I can't say it would work on package downloads. I tried installing the Broadcom drivers through \"Additional Hardware\" but got the same error message I got before about not being able to install it.\nUPDATE 4: The output of lspci -nn | grep -i network is\n02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4321 802.11a/b/g/n [14e4:4328] (rev 03)\nand of uname -r,\n3.8.0-29-generic\nsudo modprobe b43 doesn't seem to do anything. I do still have the /lib/firmware/b43 folder and contents as explained in UPDATE 1--it gave me some trouble.\n\nA: I'm proud to report that wireless is now, for the most part, working!\nI went back over Broadcom's instructions (see the second link under UPDATE 2), but used the sudo command before everything to solve the permissions issue. The make command (no clean) worked, automatically using the cfg80211 API. On step 1 of the instructions for a fresh installation, I had to issue rmmod ssb_hcd before rmmod ssb as the former was using the latter, and I blacklisted both modules. On step 2, modprobe lib80211 and modprobe cfg80211 worked. On step 3, in addition to the cp and depmod commands, I used echo wl >> /etc/modules instead of the command suggested for Fedora/SUSE (thanks to gertvdijk for the link to that). I had to go back and follow the instructions for \"Common issues\" under step 2 to prevent ssb from loading at boot, even though it was blacklisted.\nEverything worked until I ran a software update. The kernel was updated, so I did exactly what I did before and it now works again. So unfortunately it looks like this method must be repeated every time the kernel is changed.\nOnly problem now is it often seems to take a while before I actually get an internet connection. It recognizes the network and all, but I find I have to keep retrying to load web pages for a while. Sometimes disconnecting and reconnecting helps. The patchiness of my provider's data network through iPhone tethering over WiFi makes it difficult to identify exactly where the issue is. I sometimes have trouble with it in OS X and even on other computers in the house, and frequently have to reset the personal hotspot option (and sometimes the cellular data network connection) on the phone. So I'm not thinking it's a problem with Ubuntu. It just seems worse with it, but I'm probably just nitpicking. It is weird, though, that I only see two \"bars\" of signal strength. Then again, OS X only shows the tethering icon, with no indication of signal strength, so who knows.\nUPDATE: Perhaps I spoke too soon! It's getting really annoying having to either wait or play around with network settings to get a good internet connection. I just tried OS X and Ubuntu right next to each other and there's definitely something funky going on with the way Ubuntu is getting wireless. Strange that it wasn't like this the other day when I first got it working.\n", "Q: Xubuntu software update not working?

To do that, you select the paragraph (or part of it) and the Format>Paragraph (or get to the same point using the right-click menu.)\nThis brings up the paragraph formatting menu, where you can change the before and after spacing. If you do this, your selected paragraph will have different spacing to the others, even though it has the same style applied.\nTO fix this, select all the affected paragraphs (at once, or a few at a time) then Format>\"Clear direct formatting.\" That will leave only the style.\nNote that the line spacing is also specified in the style, and can also be overridden on a per-paragraph basis.\n", "Q: How to update my already installed Ubuntu Touch image?

In the article, it says that SteamOS is based on Ubuntu. Is this true? And if so, does this mean that Steam's entire library will be available on Ubuntu? Sorry, slightly off-topic. Article Link\n\nA: No, its based on Debian 7.1\nSee http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse/discussions/1/648814395741989999/ for more info.\nYou can browse the test repo at http://repo.steampowered.com/hometest/dists/stable/steam/binary-amd64/Packages\nIt includes a steam-desktop metapackage as well as steam client and valve recovery partition\n\nA: There are two questions here:\nSteam OS is Ubuntu-based (EDIT: this appeared to be the case at the time, now evidently the correct answer is that it is actually a new Debian-derivative). Therefore it is likely that most games ported to Steam OS will also be runnable on \"stock\" Ubuntu (although I imagine that post Steam OS Valve is less likely to be interested in supporting other Linux versions).\nThe entire library is very unlikely to be available on Linux (in my opinion - what follows is unsourced): \n\n\n*\n\n*Major bits of middleware (eg, Unreal, PhysX, etc) will presumably be ported, and recent games that are built on them can presumably then be ported easily. New games using these will probably be available for Linux.\n\n*Some recent games using such middleware might be ported. Nonetheless, companies have relatively little incentive to add support for a new platform for something which is no longer a big seller and for which they already have your money.\n\n*There are fair number of games that are, for want of a better word, abandonware - the original developers have gone bust or the publisher has scattered them to the winds, and there is little or no chance of anyone digging up the original code and making a Linux port.\n\nA: Since Steam OS isn't released yet and there is no official information on what Linux distribution it will be based off, we are left speculating about it now.\nSince Steam for Linux is currently officially supporting Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10 that the future Steam OS will be something that is very similar to Ubuntu. Even when it won't be Ubuntu, porting the software to Ubuntu and its brethren will be easy.\nYou might find more information on the Steam on Linux community page.\n\nA: Original quote from steampowered.com \n\n\nSo, what is SteamOS Beta?\n\nSteamOS Beta is an early, first-look public release of our Linux-based\n  operating system. The base system draws from Debian 7, code named\n  Debian Wheezy. Our work builds on top of the solid Debian core and\n  optimizes it for a living room experience. Most of all, it is an open\n  Linux platform that leaves you in full control. You can take charge of\n  your system and install new software or content as you want.\n\nBut also they say:\n\nNot running Linux yet?\nUbuntu is our favorite version of Linux.\n\nSo i really hope that they support both. And because Ubuntu is based on Debian too, i would guess they do.\n", "Q: Suspend problems Dell XPS 15 - Ubuntu 13.04 I have a Dell XPS 15 laptop with an external display through the mini-displayport, and I am completely unable to get the suspend functionality working correctly with Ubuntu 13.04 Raring Ringtail.\nWith any of the 3.8 kernels, suspending the computer seems to work correctly for about a half second, and then the fan starts up to full blast, and the activity light stays on (instead of the slow blink that indicates sleep mode).\nWith 3.9, I can initiate suspend correctly, but the laptop only displays a blank screen upon resume.\nThe 3.10 kernel suspends and resumes correctly except for the mini-displayport crashing. My external monitor goes into power saving mode after the computer wakes up from suspend and stays that way until I restart the computer, even after restarting lightdm.\n3.11 encounters other errors when resuming.\nThis is getting extremely frustrating. Any help or insight would be much appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: Looks like it's the \"rapid start\" feature that causes problems, it tries to wake up and shut down the computer after a few hours, but it fails in Ubuntu and makes it eat up the battery.\nYou can disable it in the bios (F12, setup) to fix this, and it should work great - on 13.10.\n", "Q: How to run command on connect to network How can I automatically run a command whenever my computer connects to a network?\nI want it to run in these situations:\n\n\n*\n\n*On power on and login to Unity\n\n*On waking up from suspend or hibernate\n\n*When it connects to a network after disconnection\n\n\nI first tried the /etc/pm/sleep.d/ for suspend and hibernate, but they run before computer connects to the network and because my command is a transaction in the network, It doesn't work at all.

From my understanding of Linux, all distros are are just a bunch of pre-packaged packages. In theory, couldn't I start with Ubuntu and eventually turn it into something similar to #! only by installing/uninstalling packages?\nThe reason I ask is that I'm new to Linux. I'm looking to pick a distribution that I can use for both my desktop and laptop. I like the way it looks, but some people have told me that if you don't know exactly what you need/want to pick Ubuntu. However, I've been looking at the posts here and a lot of the screen shots that I like are Arch/#!. I'm willing to do a bunch of research, and I feel that I might even learn to use Linux better with something other than Ubuntu?\nAny input?\n\nA: Distro matters mainly for these reasons:\n1) It will define the default (or lack of) GUI (e.g. Gnome, Xfce, KDE, Unity, Cinnamon etc)\n2) It will define the default set of app software installed\n3) It will define its package manager - the app that un/installs software\nOne option is to try some of the distros out in a virtual machine (VM) on your main machine, e.g. using VirtualBox which is free and which supports Linux in a VM on Windows (and vice versa).  Personally speaking, this would involve too much time and effort :-)\nHave a look at distrowatch.com .  I would say the main contenders would be Mint, Ubuntu, Kubuntu or if you are of a techy disposition, Scientific Linux or CAE Linux.\nIn my opinion, having to choose a distro is one of the biggest barriers to using Linux :-) .  Once you have installed it once though, it's easy to trash it and do it again, so it's no biggy really.\nEdit:  MadMike raised an important point about Long Term Support releases (LTS) - I too favour these as they give stability but provide bug fixes e.g. over several years.\n\nA: See Arch compared to Ubuntu (below is from that link). \n\nArch is designed for users who desire a do-it-yourself approach, whereas Ubuntu provides an autoconfigured system which is meant to be more user-friendly. Arch is presented as a much more minimalist design from the base installation onward, relying heavily on the user to customize it to their own specific needs. In general, developers and tinkerers will probably like Arch better than Ubuntu, though many Arch users have started on Ubuntu and eventually migrated to Arch.\n\nArch is marketed as mainly a 'do it yourself' distro. You install almost everything by yourself (the whole installation seems to be command line). See also the 'Arch Linux' page of the ArchWiki for an overview of Arch.\nIf you're new to Linux, I'd suggest you stick with Ubuntu (or derivatives) or maybe Linux Mint. However, you may get more out of Arch if you put some effort in for a more customized distribution.\n\nit is the user who decides what his Arch system will be.\n\nAs a final note, you can always install Arch (or Ubuntu) into a virtual machine and see if you like it.\n", "Q: How do I install a specific video codec in Ubuntu? Before you ask, yes, I've installed Medibuntu. This codec is not in that pack--specifically I am trying to install SCLS.dll, which stands for Screen Capture Lossless Codec, a codec that works with CamStudio's desktop recording software.\nIt works fine in Windows, but when I have attempted to install it on Linux, I have had zero luck through Ubuntu itself, or through Wine. When I install through Wine, GOM player simply crashes and Windows Media Player won't load the files at all--those are the only two media players I know of that have correctly made use of the SCLS codec in Windows--and in Ubuntu, the \"Videos\" program can't find it--so I suppose the second part of my question would be how to direct the \"Videos\" program to my codec?\n\nA: \na codec that works with CamStudio's desktop recording software.\n\nSadly, if the makers don't make available the codec for the community in binary (or even better the source) is unlikely that you can use the codec in any Linux distributions.\n\nThis codec is free for non-commercial use.\nTo use it in commercial projects buy a license here.\n\nHere free means as no-cost per use.\nSeems also that mplayer might support this codec. Is unclear if they mean that the can reproduce the codec or that they are able to codec raw video into this codec.\nFor people that are interested in adding codecs\nNormally an apt-cache search <name of the codec> should suffice. In this particular case it returned non-useful results:\napt-cache search scls\ntexlive-latex-base - TeX Live: Basic LaTeX packages\n\nOther codecs might have more luck.\n\nA: The good news is that both 64bit and 32bit versions of MPlayer will now play these files, certainly the one that I have downloaded from the MPlayer sample site.

So, please bare if i asked a silly question.\n\nA: It is possible to install your own kernel from the mainline, but not recommended.\nUnless you have some specific piece of hardware that doesn't work in 3.8 but is supported in 3.11, the changes are very unlikely to make a difference to you.\nYou can read a (shortened but not short) list of changes at eg, KernelNewbies. The Linux kernel as a whole supports a large number of different computer architectures and peripherals and hence most changes probably don't affect the hardware you are using. Changes to the core might make minor differences in eg, file system performance but in most cases you won't notice the difference.\nIn addition, installing your own means you don't get the advantage of the package manager's scripts which streamline installing a new kernel - for instance, you'll have to manually update grub to boot the new kernel and manually install any proprietary drivers (nvidia, broadcom, etc) you were using.\nIf security issues are fixed in newer kernel versions, they are patched in the currently supported Ubuntu versions and you get these fixes by running a normal Software Update.\nUbuntu 13.10 Saucy Salamander will be released in the next few weeks with a 3.11 kernel.\n", "Q: Installing Kingsoft on 13.10 I am trying to install Kingsoft in 13.10.

Does the Wubi allow you to create a proper ext4 partition and install Ubuntu?\nOr is it that the Wubi will only allow me to install it in the C partition? \n\nA: It runs under Windows file systems, not ext4. So it has to go on C.\nOtherwise Ubuntu needs a separate partition formatted to ext4, in which case you won't need Wubi. You can install directly onto the partition.\n", "Q: ubuntu 13.10 jgrasp unable to compile due to javac error I am fairly new to linux and ubuntu. I have download jgrasp and installed all the necessary jdk packages. However when i try to compile a jgrasp program i get an error saying that javac is not in the folder i am saving the file in.\nany ideas?\n\nA: It's not saying it's not in the same folder as the file, it's saying it can't find it on your path. Make sure you have the full JDK installed, not just the JRE, and make sure it is the JDK \"bin\" directory that is first on your system path.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 on Gateway NV57H44u turns monitor idle even when told not to The screen is shutting off when power settings are NOT set to make it turn off.\nI am running Ubuntu 13.04 on an Gateway NV57H44u.

Im not able to boot from live cd as well. So I cant provide any more relevant data. But I found that this is due to hardware problem but how should I proceed now?\n\nA: The mem test showing errors tells you that you have a bad memory module, your data is safe in your hard disk and should not be affected.\nPossible solutions to make your system boot again:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove one by one the memory modules in your computer and try booting again, replace if possible the bad memory module with a working one;\n\n\n*\n\n*It should be easy enough to locate, remove and install modules in any computer. They are normally located near the CPU socket:\n\n\n*Restore the memory modules that are good back to their original positions.\n\n\n*Make a backup of your disk and restore it in to a working computer, with minimal work you will be able to boot it up in to your working environment without issues.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 is lagging on my Asus Laptop I have an Asus laptop with a core i3 processor, 4GB memory and an NVidia 540M graphics card, as well as an Intel graphics card.\nI have just installed Ubuntu 13.04 and it is lagging. By lagging I mean being non-responsive for a few seconds even while i'm using the terminal. I have tried updating the drivers via apt-get but it did not do the trick.\nIs Ubuntu using the second Intel graphic card and that is why the update did not help?\n\nA: I think that I have found the issue. It appears that my mouse R.A.T. 3 was causing the delays. After I have plugged in a standard USB mouse the problems resolved. I think that I would need a driver that supports the R.A.T mouse. \nThanks for the help.\n\nA: That's strange. I have an Asus too. It's the same than yours except for the processor, mine has an i5. But Ubuntu 13.04 runs ok. Did you have any problem during the installation? Maybe you should reinstall.\nThe other thing is that you need to install Bumblebee, in order to use the Intel card normally, and not update the graphic cards as usual.\nA useful guide here Bumblebee \nIn other case, u should try another distro and see if you have the same problem\n :) Hope this helps\n\nA: Solved the issue completely.

I want to view the contents of my .bash_history file but don't know how to get there via the command line.\n\nA: If you want to access the actual file itself, just use your favorite text editor (I use emacs but you can use pluma of gedit or vimor whatever):\nemacs ~/.bash_history\n\nThat is the default location if your history file. If you don't find anything there, you may have changed the history file's name. This is stored in the $HISTFILE variable, so print it out to check its current value:\necho $HISTFILE\n\n\nIf, instead of the file, you just want to see your history, you can run history as @minerz029 suggested. The history command with no options just prints the contents of your $HISTFILE followed by the commands executed in the current shell that have not yet been written to that file, with line numbers.\n\nA: If you actually need the output of the .bash_history file, replace history with\ncat ~/.bash_history in all of the commands below.\nIf you actually want the commands without numbers in front, use this command instead of history:\nhistory | cut -d' ' -f 4-\n\notherwise, there will be no difference (except if you're using a different shell).\n\nLast 15 commands\nYou can use\nhistory | tail -n 15\n\nto get only the last 15 lines of your history with the last executed printed last (at the bottom).\n\nSearching for a command\nAlternatively, use\nhistory | grep \"apt-get\" | tail -n 15\n\nto get the last 15 commands which contained apt-get with the last executed printed last (at the bottom). You can replace apt-get with any command (or command argument) you want to search for (it can be a regular expression).\n\nScrolling through history\nYou can use\nhistory | tac | less\n\nto scroll through all the commands executed starting with the most recent at the top. Press q to exit.\nSimilarly, use\nhistory | grep \"apt-get\" | tac | less\n\nto scroll through all the commands executed with \"apt-get\" in them (including arguments) starting with the most recent at the top. Press q to exit.\n\nA: \nYou may want to try \"suggest box\"-like history https://github.com/dvorka/hstr - it reads Bash history and allows for quick navigation.\n\nA: In addition to minerz029's excellent answer.\nTo reiterate - the 'history' command prints the history along with a number next to it.\nYou can pipe the output of history into grep, less etc.\nThe ouput of history also shows a number on the left next to the output.  e.g.\n  469  free\n  470  ps -fA\n  471  ps -fA | grep xend\n  472  free\n  473  sudo vi /etc/xen/xend-config.sxp \n  474  cat /etc/default/grub \n\nWith this number you can re-run the command.\ne.g. to re-run 473 I would type into the terminal\n admin@xen1~$ !473\n\nfollowed by the enter key to repeat the command next to 473 in the history output.\nYou can also search interactively backwards in the command history by typing ctrl + r keys then start typing some of the contents of the command and it will search and fill it out.  When you've found it you can type enter to repeat it, or press the [tab] key to copy it to the command line to edit the command first.\nOf course, those last two options work in the bash shell.  I'm not sure if these features work in other shells.  But since bash is the Ubuntu default shell you should find them there.\n", "Q: What does CN mean in aria2 downloading info?

Our app is hosted on a private repo that requires an SSH key to access, and the node-app charm assumes that the repo is available publicly. \nIs there a way to install the key automatically and securely? \n\nA: The short answer is no, but the long answer is a little more complicated.\nAccording to the node-app charm's documentation there does not seem to be a way to configure it to take credentials.  There's two ways you could work around this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the code for the charm and modify it to accept credentials.  You can then either deploy your modified charm or (preferably) submit the modification to the charm store so others can use that feature.\n\n*(less desireable and not scalable) You could manually add the ssh key to the deployed machine:\njuju deploy node-app\n\nssh to the machine that was created: \njuju ssh node-app/0\n\nand manually add the ssh key to that machine in whatever way your repo supports.\nNumber 2 is the least work, but it's also the most manual and least repeatable.

I was looking for some viewers that can handle displaying both pictures and PDFs (ideally, PPTs, but I reckon that's asking too much), with transitions (fade in, fade out, etc).\nOn top of that, I needed a CLI interface (not GUI).\nAny suggestions?\nEdit: Ideally I was looking for a single viewer, but if it can't be done then what are the alternatives? Right now, I'm thinking about using fbi for everything (that would include extracting each slide as an image). I don't really like this solution, especially because fbi doesn't really support transitions between each photo (a simple fade-in would suffice).\nEdit2: I wanted to make a script that used these viewers, that's why I wanted to avoid GUIs.\n\nA: To my knowledge, there is no truly CLI interface to view PDFs, Pictures, or PPT presentations, those all require graphical interfaces to display transitions and pictures.\nWhile I'm fairly certain that text within a PDF or a PPT can probably be displayed after some conversion to other formats, there is no CLI interface which I know of that can actually do what you're asking for.\nI am also certain there is no one all-inclusive viewer for this, and you'll have to use multiple tools if you want the GUI.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 repeatedly freezes (have experienced thrice in one hour) I am having this problem from the time.

I believe if I keep on directly restarting the computer, my computer may get damaged any time. \n\nA: Are you using VMware or any other software to run Ubuntu inside Windows?\nIf that is the case it is a common problem occurred to everyone who have less configuration Computers. It is recommended to upgrade hardware when running OS in OS.\n\nA: Which virtual management software are you running and do you have this option enabled in your bios?\nOne thing you could do is start firefox from the command line of an open shell like konsole while logging the screen.

I installed ffmpeg using this command \nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\nAfter the installation i tried this command in terminal \nffmpeg\n\nbut i got error message like this\nroot@client85-desktop:~# ffmpeg\nbash: /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg: cannot execute binary file\n\nHow can i solve this issue? \n\nA: The path /usr/local/bin/ indicates, that you have installed a custom version of ffmpeg. The version you have installed with apt-get install is located at /usr/bin/ (without the \"local\" part). To execute the version apt-get has installed, run\n/usr/bin/ffmpeg\n\nYou can remove /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg or mark it as non-exexcutable with sudo chmod -x /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg. Run hash -r so the change takes effect in the current shell. Log out and log back in so that the change takes effect for every graphical application.\nAs soon as /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg has been treated with one of the above mentioned method, simply calling ffmepg will start the one at /usr/bin/ffmpeg by default.\nEdit Added information from @Ramchandra_Apte on how to do this without a complete reboot.\n\nA: Yeah something isn't quite right here. If you install ffmpeg, its binary is installed to /usr/bin/ffmpeg, not /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg.\nSo the first assumption I have to make is either:\n\n\n*\n\n*You've installed a non-standard ffmpeg package\n\n*Something else has included a weird local and broken copy of ffmpeg for some reason.\n\n\nFirst see if /usr/bin/ffmpeg will run. If it does, at least you've probably got the proper ffmpeg installed and we can just focus on removing the dud copy. If you don't, you've gone and got yourself a dodgy copy.  I'm not you, I don't know what you've done but remove dodgy repositories and generally clean house.\nNow let's see if there's a package associated with this /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg version\ndpkg -S /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg\n\nThat will either tell you it hasn't found anything or it will tell you which package it came from. If there's a package, sudo dpkg -r <package name> and try ffmpeg again.\nIf there's no package you're left in the unenviable spot of needing to manually remove it. If you've built this from source, you can cd into the source directory and run a sudo make uninstall. If you still claim not to know where this came from you can try a sudo rm /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg but I can't say what effect that may have on other applications if this is something that they've done.\n", "Q: How to launch google-chrome/chromium application shortcut in fullscreen/kiosk mode I'm trying to boot a chrome application shortcut in full screen (kiosk mode).\nLaunching as an application shortcut is straightforward by appending the command --app=http://website.com.

I doesn't look like the option exists.\nIs this option hidden, or are there alternatives? A way of starting chrome in fullscreen by default? I'm guessing that there is a way to fake a key press on F11 after chrome has started. Though this really isn't an ideal solution.\n\nA: Peter Beverloo has comprised a list of command line options at http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/\n\nA: In my case only --kiosk didn't help that much because I wanted to run in app mode (--app=URL) -- which disables some distractions like navbar or bookmarks.\nI've found from Peter Beverloo's link in other answer this --start-fullscreen flag. So OP would probably go with something like\nTLDR\n$ google-chrome --start-fullscreen --app=http://website.com\n\n\nA: How to use Chrome browser in kiosk-mode\nUse it like this:\ngoogle-chrome --kiosk http://example.com\nchromium-browser --kiosk http://example.com\n\ntested with Ubuntu 12.04, google-chrome-stable 30.0.1599.66-1 and chromium-browser 28.0.1500.71-0ubuntu1.12.04. But only if there is no other instance of the browser running.\nSo close all browser windows and then use it with the option and it should definitely  work as expected.\nOther things I've learned\nChecking --help or man google-chrome didn't help because:\n\nChromium has hundreds of undocumented command-line flags that are added\nand removed at the whim of the developers.   Here,  we  document  rela‐\ntively stable flags.\n\nSo --kiosk is an option that is deliberately un-document, because it might disappear at a whim... which it didn't since over 2 years.

We use sshfs with PAM/automount to share server files for each workstation in our network. We use -o reconnect as parameter for sshfs, mostly because our users suspended their computers and on wake sshfs would not reconnect (or respond, or anything).\nFor example:\nsshfs mvaldez@192.168.128.1:/home/mvaldez/REMOTE /home/mvaldez/RemoteDocs -o reconnect,idmap=user,password_stdin,dev,suid\n\nJust a note, if the remote computer is really down, sshfs may become unresponsive for a long time.\n", "Q: How do I install gfortran?

I've created a partition for the host machine with 20GB which will be more than enough to start with.\nHowever, when I look at the Logical Volumes through Webmin, the SWAP_1 volume has got about 15GB taking almost the entire partition for nothing.\nI'm new to Linux and did my research into how to reduce/remove the swap but couldn't get it to work.\nI've added the following line: \nvm.swappiness=0\n\non\n/etc/sysctl.conf\n\nI have rebooted the system and the swap size remains the same.\nI have also tried to switch swap off through the command: \nswapoff -a\n\nBut that also did not work.\nI'm a bit confused with all of these things as it is a kind a new world for me. \nAll I want is to have as close as 20GB as possible available on my partition.\n\nA: vm.swappiness controls the kernel's preference on how much to use swap vs trimming back the filesystem cache to free up memory.  swapoff stops using swap.  Neither has a thing to do with disk partitions.  If you are using LVM, then you want lvresize to change the size of the volume.\nsudo -s\ncat /etc/fstab\nswapoff -a\nlvresize vg0/SWAP_1 -L 4G\nmkswap -U long-uuid-here /dev/vg0/SWAP_1\nswapon -a\n\nLook at your /etc/fstab and figure out the uuid of the swap volume and copy/paste that into the mkswap line so that it will be reformatted to the new size, but keep the old uuid.\nAlternatively since you have plenty of ram, you could do without swap entirely.  Edit /etc/fstab to remove the swap line after running swapoff -a, then use lvremove vgo/SWAP_1 to delete the volume.\n", "Q: How to install a lastest version of package? I have Qt Creator 2.4 installed from package manager, but version 4.8 is out now, and I want to try it. How to properly update to the lastest version, should I download and install it manually?\n\nA: Ubuntu usually doesn't provide the very latest version of a package because Ubuntu focus on stability. So if you want to install a new version of a program, you can either download the code and compile from source (harder) or just use a PPA (easier).\nAssuming you prefer the easier, just search in launchpad the package you want and you probably will find a PPA for what you're looking for.

I have an IR remote set up and can control everything I need to with it, 99% of the time.\nHowever text input on a remote isn't very easy. I don't need to do it very often but when I do, it feels easier to walk 15 feet to plug in a USB keyboard and do it that way. However...

On a technical level, I'd rather a solution that gave me a way to temporarily turn the laptop into a remote keyboard. \n\nA: You should be able to do that using the xdotool command, after specifying the appropriate X display e.g. to simulate a single 'down arrow' press in the currently active window\n$ DISPLAY=:0 xdotool getactivewindow key Down\n\nFor entering literal text, you can use xdotool type <string> e.g.\n$ DISPLAY=:0 xdotool getactivewindow type 'your text here'\nThe xdotool package should be available from the Universe repository.\n\nA: Using x2x and some X11 forwarding, I got this to work.\nssh -X htpc x2x -to :0\n\nThe only downside currently is I had to bum into a TTY to kill SSH to exit it.

A number of different users have the same problem as you (specifically the Cannot Access Secondary GPU problem).\nOnce you have bumblebee properly setup you should see that most (if not all) of your problems will go away. You can see what is left over to fix and take it from there.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I have a Lenovo W530 with the nvidia Optimus and I upgraded my nvidia-319-updates drivers to nvidia-331 and it resolved several video display issues. It also appears to be faster display.\n\nA: Same thing happened to me; I was missing the package bumblebee-nvidia. When you install NVidia's drivers, they replace your system's libGL.so therefore breaking your integrated graphics, which is a Bad Thing(tm) since integrated is what actually runs your display and DE. Installing bumblebee-nvidia moves NVidia's libGL.so out of the way so integrated can work.\nThis is not needed for the Nouveau driver, since that driver is happy using the system libGL.so.\n", "Q: How I can auto end specific process?

You may wish to register with Launchpad and add to the bug report I linked.\n\nA: Well, at least you can get the Bluetooth working by following the steps:\nFirst, you will need to upgrade your kernel.\nFor a 32-bit system:\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.11-saucy/linux-headers-3.11.0-031100-generic_3.11.0-031100.201309021735_i386.deb   \nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.11-saucy/linux-headers-3.11.0-031100_3.11.0-031100.201309021735_all.deb    \nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.11-saucy/linux-image-3.11.0-031100-generic_3.11.0-031100.201309021735_i386.deb\n\nFor a 64-bit system:\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.11-saucy/linux-headers-3.11.0-031100-generic_3.11.0-031100.201309021735_amd64.deb    \nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.11-saucy/linux-headers-3.11.0-031100_3.11.0-031100.201309021735_all.deb    \nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.11-saucy/linux-image-3.11.0-031100-generic_3.11.0-031100.201309021735_amd64.deb\n\nFor both 32-bit & 64-bit systems, run the following command to install the kernel images:\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.11.0*.deb linux-image-3.11.0*.deb\n\nAfter booting into the new kernel, type:\nsudo insmod /lib/modules/3.11.4-031104-generic/kernel/drivers/staging/btmtk_usb.ko\n\nNow, to load the module on every reboot, add btmtk_usb to /etc/modules and then type:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\n", "Q: Explanations for a complete noob Ok, so I'm thinking of switching to Ubuntu for all but gaming and CAD (I'm an engineering student). I've never tried any form of Linux (unless Android counts), so I don't know the first thing about it. My main question is:\nHow user-/idiot-friendly is it? Do I need to be adept at programming to use Ubuntu? I've heard the joke that Linux is the Ikea of OS's, but I've only done very basic Matlab and Python. So any advanced (or even basic) command line use will probably be beyond me. Any advice/tips?\n\nA: You do not need to use the command line or program in Linux any more or less then any other OS. If you wish to do so, you may find it easier.\nMany Ubuntu users never program or use the command line.\nFor the most part, Python is the same on any OS.\nOne thing you should understand, however, is Linux is not a drop in replacement for Windows and in general your windows applications / programs will not easily run on Linux.\nI suggest you boot Ubuntu and see if you like it. You can also test it in Virtualbox.\n", "Q: How to run Windows Skype on Ubuntu using Wine? I'm trying to use Skype on Ubuntu. I tried installing it in Wine. Installing it went fine, but when I try to login, it gives me error code 1814; resource name not found. What can I do to fix this?\n\nA: Native Skype on Ubuntu\nThere is a native Skype client for Ubuntu.  You can open the Software and Updates applet included All Ubuntu flavors and click on the tab that says \"Other Software\".  Make sure the Canonical Partners is ticked.  Then you will be able to install the program through your favorite standard Ubuntu install method (software center, synaptic, or terminal).\nor simply type:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install skype\n\n\n You can download it from the Skype for Linux download page. Choose the Ubuntu 12.04 version from the list of distributions.\nThis is by far the easiest way to install Skype on Ubuntu, but there are some disadvantages to this version, the main one being that Group video chat, or video conferencing is disabled. Video Chat between just two people works.\n\nA: Skype for Windows on Wine using PlayOnLinux\nTo get the best result for running Skype for Windows on Linux using Wine, follow these steps. (Tested using Ubuntu 15.10, but it should work fine for earlier versions)\ntl;dr\n\n\n*\n\n*Skype version 6.21.32.104: link.\n\n*Wine version 1.9.1 acting as Windows 8.1 32bit.\n\n*Add /legacylogin /username:USERNAME /password:PASSWORD as arguments to skype.exe.\n\n*Run export PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60 before running Wine.\n\n\n1.

Why is Ubuntu not able to locate the package? I am wired and connected to the internet.\n\nA: That specific package isn't packaged in Ubuntu 10.04 and up. If you're trying to compile a custom kernel, the correct way to get the prerequisites in Ubuntu 10.04 and later is to run these commands:\nsudo apt-get install fakeroot build-essential crash kexec-tools makedumpfile kernel-wedge\nsudo apt-get build-dep linux\nsudo apt-get install git-core libncurses5 libncurses5-dev libelf-dev asciidoc binutils-dev\n\nHardy is a completely different version of Ubuntu, and can't be installed to another version. If you need Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron), you would need to find a copy of it online, download it, then write it to a CD or DVD.\nThat said, 8.04 is long out of service, and it's recommend to use a newer version of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to get rid of toolbar text? How to get rid of the text that appears at the bottom of all toolbar icons? It suddenly has shown up after a system crash although I didn't change anything and now I can't make it disappear:\n\nI tried to set the following setting with dconf-editor:\norg.gnome.desktop.interface toolbar-style\n\nto the value ›text‹ and logged out and in, but didn't help at all. What to do?\nUPDATE: The setting in gconf is correct as shown by the screenshot:\n\n\nA: Run the following command in terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface toolbar-style 'icons'\n\nThe other valid values are: 'both', 'both-horiz', and 'text'.\nThe changes should be visible immediately, so you don't need any restart or re-login. \n\nA: I found out that this problem occurs when the Cinnamon ppa ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable is used. It is related with:\nNemo 2.0 does not render desktop correctly with Compiz\nGTK2 applications are not themed correctly\nPurging the ppa resolves all of those tree problems:\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable\n\n", "Q: Interrupted installation of Ubuntu leads to endless restarting I was installing Ubuntu 12.04(?) Lts and I didn't notice that my battery was running out because I fell asleep while waiting for the installation. When I tried to restart the pc after recharging, I tried to reinstall it. When the cd is attached my pc restarted after sometime. When I remove the cd it leads to the grub rescue. \nBy the way I'm new in using Ubuntu so I'm not very familiar with it.\n\nA: Just restart the installation from the start. Probably the installation got half finished and didn't complete. Also, remember to leave your portable devices connected to AC always that you are installing something big, like an OS.\n", "Q: Windows 7 with Ubuntu on Dell studio 15 Dell studio 15. C: 40gb primary (win7), 130gb on D: and E: How to go dual boot with Ubuntu and what about drivers?If my dell driver cd will work???\n\nA: Driver CD generally gives only Windows drivers.\nYou can download drivers from net.\nElse most of the commonly used drivers work with your hardware. Ubuntu is clever enough to make them work. so don't worry.\nYou can go for dual boot.\nJust be careful when giving partitions for installation.\nCreate USB bootable drive of Ubuntu and start setup from it.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Why does alien need sudo privilege? I wonder why does alien need sudo privileges while converting a .rpm file to .deb in a non-privileged directory(eg. my home directory).\nIs this a security feature(which I believe is redundant, since installing the package would need dpkg, which needs sudo privileges)?\n\nA: Because packages can contain files owned by different users and I believe the conversion process extracts the files and then builds a .deb from there.  Setting the permissions on the extracted files requires root access.\nNote that you should be able to use fakeroot to work around this.\n", "Q: Using any nvidia-* package causes system to hang on boot I'm using a GeForce GTX 660 on a custom built system. The nouveau driver works properly and I can use Ubuntu normally with it. However I'd like to use NVIDIA's driver.\nI have not really found an official guide for this so I'm sort of winging it.\nI've seen suggestions to install packages from Ubuntu Software Center, but nothing appears in the \"Additional Drivers\" tab, so I'm doing this all from apt.\nI've attempted to install nvidia-304, nvidia-319 (the one I expect would work), and nvidia-331 (from xorg-edgers just for the hell of it). They all have the same result: after making my selection in grub, it behaves as though it's about to boot but hangs at a solid dark purple screen. If I remove 'quiet' from the boot parameters, it hangs at two brief messages citing which kernel it's loading. If I set vga=vesa:off I see the usual boot messages, though it hangs all the same with nothing of note in the logs.\nMy current kernel is 3.8.0-31-generic. Any ideas?\n\nA: It may have been one of two things for me, but here's what I did to fix it:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-313-updates\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nI kind of doubt the driver version had anything to do with the problem. I previously had not tried the 313 version before, but it appears to be available in a vanilla Ubuntu install. I suspect later versions of the driver should work, but this one I believe will be good enough for me.\nI noticed that I did not have a /etc/X11/xorg.conf installed on my machine by default after installing these packages, so I ran the nvidia-xconfig utility to generate one. I think this had more of a hand in the fix.\n", "Q: Cant create a file and write to it from a .sh script I am trying to create a file and write to it using a .sh script but is not working(Nothing is being created, and I don't see any error).\nThis is how that part of my script looks like:\nfacesConfigContent=\"<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>\n<faces-config version=\\\"2.2\\\"\n              xmlns=\\\"http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee\\\"\n              xmlns:xsi=\\\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\\\"\n              xsi:schemaLocation=\\\"http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-facesconfig_2_2.xsd\\\">\n</faces-config>\"\nfacesConfigFileName=\"faces-config.xml\"\ncd ~/Desktop/${artifactId}/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF\necho ${facesConfigContent} > ${facesConfigFileName} \n\nDo you see something wrong?\n\nA: What exactly is $artifactId ??

So you need to modify the PATH envar declaration inside that file, not inside the .profile!\nUse this only if you want to change the PATH value for every users!\n\nA: Don't use a space before or after = when you assign a value to a variable in bash. The right way is:\nPATH=\"/user/share/android-sdk-linux/tools:$PATH\"\n\nFor the changes to take effect, restart your computer or source your .profile file using the following command:\nsource ~/.profile\n\nIf you want to change the path for all users, add that line in /etc/profile file. Again a restart is required.\n", "Q: Mount network drive - line 3 in /etc/fstab is bad I am a Ubuntu 12.04 novice and am seriously struggling to mount my network drive. \nI can see it in Nautilus, and its properties detail its name as 'Seagate Expansi'.\nI have installed cifs, created the folder /media/public and added the line:\n//192.168.1.1/Seagate Expansi /media/public cifs guest 0 0  \n\n...to etc/fstab. however when I run: \nsudo mount -a \n\nI receive the error:\nline 3 in /etc/fstab is bad\n\nI kind of understand what the error is telling me, but I don't understand where I have gone wrong.

So I will just give an example and hopefully your response can clear it up for me. I need some random piece of software. For lack of creativity, I will call this program \"ubsoft\". I'm downloading this program from some random site called \"ubsoft.com\". Now please put me into your shoes. If you just downloaded this file, how would you install it if you can't do it via apt-get because the proper repository doesn't exist?\n\nA: The default way to install software on Linux is using the package manager, which in the case of Ubuntu is apt-get or the software centre. Otherwise you can compile the package from source.\nTo be fair, you should ask ubsoft.com if they are not using the package method. The method will differ from package to package. For example, some may require running an install script/program, while others may just require uncompress of an archive.\nTherefore, my response is 'it depends.'\n", "Q: Installing motherboard drivers Yesterday I've successfully installed Ubuntu 12.04 (x64), but something's bothering me, what about the drivers of my motherboard?

So do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the device\n\n*Type sudo dmesg -c - A lot of stuff will come up, but we are basically clearing the logs.\n\n*Plug in the device\n\n*Type dmesg\n\n*Look at the logs for any errors that may help you. They are usually self explanatory. If not, edit your post to include them.\n\n\nEdit based on user comment\nGiven that you commented that no errors occurred, I will assume you mean no output after clearing the logs. In that case, I would speculate that you have a hardware issue with the dongle. Try it on another computer and verify that it works correctly. If the dongle works on another computer, check the USB ports with some other usb device to make sure they work correctly.\n", "Q: Updated stuff with Updatemanager problem I thought I needed to update stuff because of my computer randomly logging me out, So I saw that there was 1,418 updates so I installed them then after that I restarted the computer and I logged in and all that I saw was only my background picture of my desktop...

It's one of my favorite pieces of software. Cross-platform compatible dictionary look-up! It's highly customizable and compatible with a plethora of different dictionary formats and pretty much any website out there (e.g. wikipedia, dict.cc, etc.):\n\nYou can either install it from the USC or get one of the latest development releases from the OpenSUSE build repository (e.g. for 12.04 LTS/amd64).\nAs far as dictionaries are concerned, I'd suggest you install Wordnet 3.0 to get started. Some notes on supported dictionary formats and where to find them may be found here.\n\nA: Artha dictionary also doing same job which I realized now.\nIt sets ctrl+alt+W as the shortcut initially which you can change.\nAnd once you select a word and press those keys, the notification like thing pops up.\n", "Q: What nfs export settings do I need to boot the Ubuntu live discs over a network?

What MaaS does is let you manage other physical servers from the MaaS server, using the MaaS API. \nYou can build a setup where the MaaS server manages virtual machines and you can use those virtual machines using the MaaS API, but this would be used more for testing MaaS out than for production -- there are better systems (that don't involve MaaS) to use for running a bunch of virtual servers on one physical machine (like LibVirt and KVM or even LXC, which I hear Juju has and is continuing to work on their support for).\nYou might look at How do I configure juju for local usage? if you are wanting to just be able to deploy Juju charms That method would bypass using MaaS, and instead use something called containers (also referred to as LXC) that should let you deploy charms to the local computer but with the charm in it's own sandbox.\n\nA: Installing Local Cloud Infrastructure using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS MAAS\n", "Q: unable to connect to internet through lan I am connected both lan cable and wifi with ubuntu. while lan connects to a local gigabit network with no internet gateway.  I cannot ping google.com or any address  in internet.\n-> if I unplug network cable or \"ifconfig eth0 down\" than wifi network forks fine. \n-> I can ping to any local ip connected in both network.\n\nA: I think you want to use your wireless connection while you are connected to the local lan.\nThe problem is, when you connect to both, wlan AND lan, the networkmanager sets one default route, normally the one from the local lan. What you have to do is deleting the default route of you local lan, and adding the default route of your wlan device. You can find this out which default route is set by typing: \nroute -n\n\nit shows you something like this: \n0.0.0.0         10.16.0.1       0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0\n10.16.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1      0        0 eth0\n192.168.20.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     2      0        0 wlan0\n\nas you can see my default route leads through 10.16.0.1.\ndeleting default route (in my case):\nroute del default gw 10.16.0.1\n\nadding default route to the wlan connection (in my case): \nroute add default gw 192.168.20.1\n\nafter all it should look like this (in my case): \n0.0.0.0         192.168.20.1    0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 wlan0\n10.16.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1      0        0 eth0\n192.168.20.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     2      0        0 wlan0\n\n", "Q: How to install last version of unity in ubuntu 12.04 Can you tell me how install last unity version in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: Sadly, there isn't the 7.10 package of Unity available in repositories, nor PPA's.

So, I'm very familiar with developing in Windows. But, when I wanted to switch over to Ubuntu, it was very difficult to adopt.\nNow, I'm OK in using Ubuntu. I'm currently interested in doing some basic programs in Ubuntu so that I can start contributing in the coming years.\nI know this is a weird silly question. I went through developer.ubuntu.com. But, it focuses only on mobiles. But, I need to develop for PCs. Not in cloud or web. Just a simple desktop application. I don't know where to start.\nIn google, I find a lot of stuff that leads mostly to developer.ubuntu.com. So, bare with me if this question is silly.\nAlso, I have basic knowledge in CSS, JavaScript, C, C++, Java\n\nA: For PC apps, you may try learning python as it will help you in many aspects.

How do I install apache, php, and mysql on a usb flash drive in ubuntu? I know you can do it on windows, but I'd like to be able to run it from a linux operating system.\n\nA: The only way you can achieve this is if your entire Ubuntu OS is installed on a flash drive. The packages you want to install integrate themselves into your OS as they require common packages to function correctly. You could change the path of your apache directory for example so that your websites reside on your usb if you like: Easy way to change apache www location\nIf you want to install Ubuntu on a usb have a look at this link: Can I install Ubuntu to my 32 GB USB pen drive?\n\nA: There is XAMPP for Linux, but I'm still a bot unsure if it can be installed to a USB drive. Grepping trough XAMPP for Linux it becomes apparent that everything is hardwired to the /opt/lamp/ folder. The XAMPP  installer will copy everything in this /opt/lamp/ and doesn't give you an alternative.\nSo if someone would move this folder to a USB-Stick, one would need to create a softlink cd /opt; ln -s /media/Enter-Label-of-USB-Stick/lamp back to this place.\nAnd you would need to do this on every PC where this stick is supposed to be used.\nNote: Answer is untried and somewhat incomplete.\n", "Q: Unable to install java on my ubuntu Whenever I try to install java on my Ubuntu, it show error like\nPackage dependencies cannot be resolved.\nThis error could be caused by required additional software packages which are missing or not installable.

The default dbpath in Ubuntu is /var/lib/mongodb so it seems you have changed that in the config file to be ~/mongodb/db.  \nIf you do that, the ~ will expand to be the home folder for the user that the service is running as.  Hence you would need to create /home/mongodb/db or /home/mongod/db/, not /root/db, and make sure it is owned by the relevant user to use that setting.\nI would recommend using a full path to eliminate the confusion.

Open python in a terminal and type the following:\n$ python\nPython 2.7.4 (default, Sep 26 2013, 03:20:26) \n[GCC 4.7.3] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import numpy\n>>> import scipy\n>>> import cython\n>>> exit()\n\nThe above, has to be without errors.

I would like to use that ... \nIs there a way to install it and have it behave as I described above ?\n(please use descriptive explanations as I am almost a newbie on Linux)\nThanks all.\n\nA: I believe you would be able to use the project https://launchpad.net/magick-rotation\nthough I do not have a Dell Inspiron Duo rather I am using a HP EliteBook 2760p and have successfully used that project to run shell scripts from which point one could script what ever they wanted including calls to existing programs. \nAs for the touch interface, \"Ubuntu Touch\" is mostly for phones but you have a tablet pc...unsure the complexity of switching between the \"Unity\" and the \"Touch\" interface...\nThough to the point of scripting the screen rotation you can find the following example here\n#!/bin/bash\n\nold=\"0\"\nwhile true; do\n    if [[ -e /sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/tablet ]]; then\n        new=`cat /sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/tablet`\n        if [[ $new != $old ]]; then\n            if [[ $new == \"0\" ]]; then\n                echo \"Rotate to landscape, hide CellWriter.\"\n                xrandr -o normal\n                xsetwacom set stylus rotate none\n                xsetwacom set eraser rotate none\n                xsetwacom set touch rotate none\n                cellwriter --hide-window\n            elif [[ $new == \"1\" ]]; then\n                echo \"Rotate to portrait, show CellWriter.\"\n                xrandr -o right\n                xsetwacom set stylus rotate cw\n                xsetwacom set eraser rotate cw\n                xsetwacom set touch rotate cw\n                cellwriter --show-window\n            fi\n        fi\n        old=$new\n        sleep 1s\n    fi\ndone\n\n# From Red_Lion post #576:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=845911&p=7732316\n\nThere is a poject called desktop-switcher which has an non maintained \"sourced code base\" which might be helpful if you want to do more than scripting as suggested above...\n", "Q: Cannot find curl-config in Ubuntu 13.04 I am installing package RCurl in R and getting an error\n  checking for curl-config... no\n  Cannot find curl-config\n  ERROR: configuration failed for package ‘RCurl’\n\nI have tried to install libcurl on Ubuntu, but it doesn't solve my problem have some dependecies\nsudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev\nSome packages could not be installed.

If I move the /home/... folders to a btrfs partition, can I still enable per user quota? That is, each user should be able to use a limited amount of storage.\n\nA: \nDoes btrfs support per user quota?\n\nNo, it doesn't.\n\nIf I move the /home/... folders to a btrfs partition, can I still enable per user quota? That is, each user should be able to use a limited amount of storage.\n\nYes, the trick is to use a subvolume for each home.\nBtrfs supports subvolume quotas since Linux Kernel 3.6.\n(Note that Ubuntu Precise has 3.2, Quantal has 3.5, Raring has 3.8, and note that you can install the Raring Hardware Enablement Stack on Precise, to have an updated kernel.)\nInstructions to enable quotas are in the Btrfs FAQ, \"How do we implement quota in BTRFS?\". Subvolumes created after btrfs quota enable support quotas automatically. Subvolumes created before btrfs quota enable need manual intervention to support quotas.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the btrfs filesystem\n\n*Enable quota: btrfs quota enable mountpoint\n\n*(If the filesystem already contains subvolumes, enable their quota support:)\n\n\n*\n\n*List the subvolume IDs with btrfs subvolume list. The number that follows ID (at the beginning of each line) is the subvolume's id.\n\n*Create a qgroup with btrfs qgroup create 0/subvolume-id path-to-subvolume (don't forget to replace the subvolume-id with the correct id)\n\n*Rescan the subvolumes, since the quota settings have been changed: btrfs quota rescan\n\n\n*Create new subvolumes that you need: btrfs subvolume create mountpoint/subvolume-name\n\n*Limit the subvolume usage: btrfs qgroup limit 100G path-to-subvolume\n\n*Profit.\n\n\nFinally, set up /etc/fstab to mount the subvolumes automatically at boot:\n\nUUID=uuid-of-the-filesystem /home/mountpoint btrfs defaults,subvolid=subvolume-id 0 0\n\nAlternatively, you may use LABEL=label or /dev/sdxn to refer to the btrfs filesystem.\nTo apply the changes to fstab without rebooting: mount -a\n\nA: No, Btrfs doesn't support user quota, It supports directory quota. So you can add quota for each user directory, but if you have shared directory with multiple users/groups then you can't set/count space for every user separately.\nSo you can't limit userX to be able to put 1MB of files in /home/shared and another userY to be able to put 10MB of files in the same /home/shared folder. But you can set different limits for /home/userX and /home/userY.\nThis is not user quota, but sub-volume quota. You can put multiple sub-volumes in single limit (for example user have /home/userX/ and /backups/userX/ then both can be under single limit.\n", "Q: Desktop.exe in Ubuntu I have installed ubuntu on my laptop and Desktop.

Can this be done on the same machine or do I need to have separate machines?\n\nOne machine can host both Samba (file and print service) and Apache (web service) IF it's a powerful enough machine.

Windows automagically mounts a CD and doesn't tell you what it's doing. Linux tells you what's going on, and mounting is the process of reading the directory of the CD and making it readable by the computer. (Well, that's the 50 cent explanation, anyway).\n-3-\n\ndoes this mean I need to have a CD burner in my machine?\n\nNo, it does not.\n\nThe machine has clean / wiped & formatted HDD so no conflicts with any other op sys or software.\nStarting to pull my hair out as I have been trying to install for a week now.\nWhen trying to create a bootable CD of the desktop version it failed as it is 707mb and a CD is only 700MB.\n\nWell, it's a little secret, but some folks measure files in multiples of a million, and other folks measure capacity in multiples of 2^13 (= 1,048,576). So, sometimes a MB is not an MB or is a little more.\nYou can fit the contents of an Ubuntu desktop install onto a CD-R, so I think what happened is perhaps you used a CD-RW disc instead of a CD-R disc, or left the CD-R open to hold more files, as only a closed ('mastered') CD-R can be used for booting.\nAlso, the CD-R might be bad; I never buy CD-Rs made in China or India, and vastly prefer those Made In Japan (TM) to those made in Taiwan. /rant\n-4-\n\nMy system is 32x Dual P3 processors and 512mb ram 160gb HDD.

Musta been a fast server when it was new.\nThat will run Ubuntu or Kubuntu, but a little slowly.

Also on start up after pressing F9 to choose boot device USB won't appear in the list, only optical disk, netbook disk and network if I enable it.)\nI wanted to resize the boot partiton to make space for the installation but I couldn't do that because it seems that the whole HDD is the boot partiton so it can't be unmounted using Gparted.\nMy partition system is the following:\nDisk /dev/sda: 250.1 GB, 250059350016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 30401 cylinders, total 488397168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x000e6661\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   486318079   243158016   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2       486320126   488396799     1038337    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5       486320128   488396799     1038336   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nSo how can I make a new partition to be able to install a \"new\" Ubuntu and get rid of the old one. Or any better solution for this problem?\nI hope it's not a catch 22...\n\nA: You shouldn't have to repartition the disk just to reinstall Ubuntu. It seems like you just have one partition for Ubuntu, and one Swap partition in an extended partition, which is a standard partitioning scheme for an Ubuntu installation.\nYou could boot the Ubuntu iso from the Grub menu. When you boot from the iso file, you will be able to press a key upon boot to get to the Live boot menu. Add the toram kernel option.\nYou will be able to choose whether you want to save programs or Home folder data or just erase everything and reinstall.\nAnd importantly, make reliable backup before executing the procedure! Though nothing should go wrong if you ensure that you know what you're doing.\n\nA: There are 2 parts to this:\nOpen a terminal and run ls /boot If boot is full of old kernels you can go remove happy on them, I recommend keeping the original, the latest and the one before latest. the lowest number is normally the shipping kernel, the highest number will be the latest.\nTo grow boot you first need to shrink another partition so you have free space. I would suggest using the gparted tool on the live cd to do this. First decrease the size of/ or /home depending on your setup. Then increase the size of boot.\n", "Q: setup ssh encryption keys Here is the situation:\nI have 4 Linux servers. /home is same for all the four servers. (It's a network drive).

So I added the public key to authorized key for $HOME/.ssh directory\nBut when I try to ssh to these servers, it still asks for the password. \nHelp please!\n\nA: When you enter ssh hostname SSH tries password-based auth by default. So you have to enter an additional option to the command:\nssh -i .ssh/private-key-of-host hostname\n\nAfter the -i option should be the filename of your key. Now you can login without entering a password.\nHowever there another possibility: You can have a configuration file in .ssh/config. Enter here:\nHost Foo\n  HostName 123.45.67.89\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/private-key-of-host\n\nNow you can enter ssh Foo and SSH tries to connect to the host mentioned in HostName (can be a IP address or a hostname) with the key from IdentityFile.\n", "Q: How do I restore deleted kernel initrd files?

And when I start my computer I can only access the grub of course.\nI am fairly new to linux so please keep that in mind.\nThank you for your help, I really appreciate it, I'm going crazy without my computer.\n\nA: You can manually download the .deb package from the official repository server http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux/. Just use your web browser. There you have to find the kernel you need. In my case its called linux-image-3.2.0-35-generic_3.2.0-35.55_amd64.deb.

However, this job must also wait for a different service to be started before it starts.

For reference, I wanted to have the job start once CUPS is started and my task has finished. When CUPS had printers configured, it would start slowly and the script would run correctly (in cases 1 and 3, 2 never worked properly). However, when CUPS did not have any printers configured it would start instantly (I mean, WTF Upstart, why does this happen in the first place?) but more importantly my job would not run.\nI have come to the conclusion that Upstart in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is completely broken.

I tries using steps from this forum below and still no luck.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1983054&page=4\nAny help would be nice, \nThanks.\n\nA: I was able to use the IRC room to help fix this. The issue is that I am in a Hyper-V environment. This box was using a legacy network adapter when it was on 10.04. Now that it is on 12.04 I removed the legacy adapter and added a new adapter, and it works now. thanks to the user hydruid\n", "Q: Where in linux file system can i see files of Hadoop HDFS? I am a just data analyst hails from non cs background (not a hardcore system programmer) working on linux OS. While exploiting analysis using hadoop, a question was coming to my mind that ... \n/ is a root under which all files of your system exists in a hierarchical manner. In hadoop envirorment, a special file system called as HDFS is there which is actually meant to store huge files to be processed by hadoop programming frameworks.\nhadoop -fs put localfile.txt \n\nAlthough, such files should be accessible under /. so where can i see such files by using cat, less or more linux commands without prefixing hadoop -fs\nIf, unfortunately i get some error in hadoop/HDFS environment, then how can i acess my data which is still residing on my linux machine.\n\nA: You can use hdfs fsck utility to locate the name of the block and then you can manually find it in the local filesystem:\n$ echo \"Hello world\" >> test.txt\n$ hdfs dfs -put test.txt /tmp/\n$ hdfs fsck /tmp/test.txt -files -blocks\n/tmp/test.txt 12 bytes, 1 block(s):  OK\n    0.

Use that to locate the file:\n$ find /hadoop/hdfs/data/current/BP-1186293916-10.25.5.169-1427746975858/current/finalized -name 'blk_1075191146*'\n/hadoop/hdfs/data/current/BP-1186293916-10.25.5.169-1427746975858/current/finalized/subdir22/subdir29/blk_1075191146_1451047.meta\n/hadoop/hdfs/data/current/BP-1186293916-10.25.5.169-1427746975858/current/finalized/subdir22/subdir29/blk_1075191146\n\n$ cat /hadoop/hdfs/data/current/BP-1186293916-10.25.5.169-1427746975858/current/finalized/subdir22/subdir29/blk_1075191146\nHello world\n\nYou can see full example with explanation here\n\nA: You cannot directly browse HDFS from terminal using cat or similar commands. HDFS is a logical file system and does not directly map to Unix file system. You should have an HDFS client and your Hadoop cluster should be running. When you browse HDFS, you are getting your directory structure from namenode and actual data from datanodes. \nAlthough you cannot browse, data is there stored by datanode daemon. Its path is specified by dfs.data.dir property in hdfs-site.xml. \nDirectory structure is stored by namenode daemon and its path is specified by dfs.name.dir property in hdfs-site.xml\n\nA: Hadoop stores it data locally in forms of block on each datanode and that property is configurable in hdfs-site.xml file under dfs.data.dir property\nIn most of the case it is \n$HADOOP_HOME/data/dfs/data/hadoop-${user.name}/current\n\n\nA: In fact you can cat the contents of your file using;\nhdfs dfs -cat /user/test/somefile.txt\n\nIn Hadoop Namenode holds all the information about files like filename, metadata, directory, permission, the blocks which form the file, and block locations. In case of namenode failure you will lose the files since you dont know which blocks form which file although you have all the content on datanodes.\nSince files are stored as blocks in Hadoop, if you know the blockid and datanodes of files you can see the content of them. Here we are assuming the files are text files. \nFinally HDFS supports mapping an HDFS directory to a local NFS share. This  way you can access hdfs without using any hdfs specific commands. \n\nA: You can navigate to all the files who are managed by hadoop by simply writing following command:\nMore appropriate command is hdfs dfs -ls \nThe command given on linux terminal will show an output of / directory in which 1st columns shows the file's permissions, 2nd column shows the user of the file and 3rd column shows name of the file\n", "Q: Are encrypted deja-dup backups resumable? I have about 1TB of data I'd like to make an encrypted backup of over a period of a few sessions. I'm guessing under the hood deja-dup uses something like rsync and only modifies a backup when necessary (files have been added or changed). However, when making an encrypted backup does each file have to be reencrypted before it can be compared to its backed up version? That is, can an encrypted backup resume where it left off, or must it start from the beginning, doing each encryption along the way?\n\nA: Deja-dup is a front-end for duplicity. An interrupted backup(encrypted or not) can be resumed without starting all over again, you only lose the progress of the last chunk/slice of the backup-chain. By default in deja-dup slices are of about 50M, so not much of a loss. Anyway if you've that much data to backup I'd suggest using a command-line tool with more options and flexibility (dar, rdiff-backup, or maybe duplicity itself)\n", "Q: Software center not opening on Ubuntu 13.04 due to Gdk-ERROR I know there's a lot of other questions about similar problems, but my error seems different from the others. (Apologies if I actually missed the one that addresses mine)\nWhen I open Software Center I get this error. I tried to remove it (apt-get remove --purge software-center and re-installed it, but the error remained). What is wrong?

How can I create a shortcut for URL in my desktop? I want to use them in Firefox or Chrome. \nIf a copy and paste didn't work. \nWhat script I have to use?  \n\nA: I needed something like this, but Gnome (now?) requires *.desktop files to be in specific locations, so using those directly wouldn't solve my problem, as I wanted web-links for reference mostly in project folders. And they wouldn't be cross-platform compatible either.\nEventually I turned to Microsoft's .url files, which are easily constructed and look like this:\n[InternetShortcut]\nURL=https://askubuntu.com\n\n\n(I read that the trailing line break is important, and probably should be \\r\\n for Windows compatibility)\nAnd created a .desktop specification to handle them:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=URL Handler\nMimeType=application/x-mswinurl;\nExec=bash -c \"set -e; P=$(python3 -c 'import configparser,sys,urllib.parse; c=configparser.ConfigParser(); c.read(sys.argv[1])\\ntry:\\n    u=c[\\\"InternetShortcut\\\"][\\\"URL\\\"]\\n    if not urllib.parse.urlparse(u).scheme in [\\\"http\\\",\\\"https\\\",\\\"ftp\\\",\\\"ssh\\\"]: raise Exception(\\\"Invalid scheme in URI\\\")\\n    print(u)\\nexcept Exception as e: print(e,file=sys.stderr); exit(3);' %f); xdg-open \\\"$P\\\"\"\n\nPut that into a file in ~/.local/share/applications/<whatever>.desktop. In my case Gnome immediately bound *.url files to them.\nThis requires xdg-utils package (for xdg-open, it's likely there if you have a desktop-environment) and python 3.\nI really really didn't want to use python, but doing unchecked parsing on something like this didn't suit me. The largest parts of the python script are to avoid infinite loops among other dangers -- in case someone gets funny ideas and puts a file name in a .url file. It ensures that a scheme is present and is one of http(s), ftp, ssh. I guess that list can be easily extended, but I actually don't know which schemes Windows supports.\n\nA: In Ubuntu an URL shortcut is stored in a .desktop file as follow (for example):\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Link to Ask Ubuntu\nType=Link\nURL=http://www.askubuntu.com/\nIcon=text-html\n\nYou can drag links from Firefox or Chrome and drop them on the Desktop or any other folder where you have permissions to save files.\nNote: Link will appear on your Desktop or your file explorer (i.e. caja) under the name in the line Name=…, not by its actual filename. And without any ….desktop extension.\n\nA: Add this to your ~/.bashrc:-\nfunction createUrlShortcut {\n    if [ \"$#\" -ne 3 ]; then\n        echo \"Illegal number of parameters. Usage : createUrlShortcut Name Url FileBaseName\"\n    fi\n    printf \"[Desktop Entry]\\nEncoding=UTF-8\\nName=$1\\nType=Link\\nURL=$2\\nIcon=text-html\" > ~/Desktop/$3.Desktop\n}\n\nTo create a shortcut, do as follows:-\ncreateUrlShortcut RGB-Dataset https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download RGBD-Dataset-Link\n\nThe first argument is the name you want to be displayed in nautilus.\nThe second argument is the url.\nThe third argument is the actual name of the file which will be appended by .Desktop extension.\nNote that this will create a file with name RGBD-Dataset-Link.Desktop but will be displayed as RGB-Dataset in nautilus.\n\nA: Try this.  Install Gnome Panel, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-panel\n\nOnce installed type this:\ngnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/path/to/shortcut\n\n(location of shortcut).  In the example below, I will create a shortcut for Ubuntu.com and place it inside the Documents folder.  Once I hit Enter a window will open with the properties.  See images below.\ngnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/Documents\n\n\n\nOnce done, just click on them newly created shortcut.\n\nA: Additionally, like all solutions that involve a command line, one can do it with a the mouse in three steps in a Chromium like browser :\n\n*\n\n*Click on the menu (the three vertical dots on top right).\n\n*Click on \"more tools…\"\n\n*Click on \"create application shortcut\" to create a shortcut on your desktop\n\n*(depending on your configuration) : You could need to right click on the shortcut and add execution permissions\n\nAfterward, one .desktop file shall be added to the desktop of the creator.\n\nA: This solution is multi-platform also:\n\n*\n\n*Create a new simple text file with an .html extension and whatever name you want.\n\n\n*Edit the file with the program you want and add this content:\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; url=https://askubuntu.com\" />\n    </head>\n    <body> </body>\n</html>\n\n\n\n*Save the file.\n\nA: You can just copy the following into a text file and save it with a .desktop file extension in the desktop folder\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=google-chrome http://google.com\nName=the name of the shortcut\nIcon=/path/to/your/photo\n\nThis works for me on Ubuntu 20.04. It uses the terminal for launching a URL.\nyou can change google-chrome to firefox if you like that browser more.\nI tried different things but this was the one that helped me out.\n\nA: Edit: using Type=Link is superior (see accepted answer).\nAs some others suggested, a desktop file launching the browser with the url as an argument works really well.\nI would like to add that you can pass it to xdg-open (installed by default) instead of firefox or google-chrome, to open up the default browser instead of having the browser hardcoded into the file.\nSomething like:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Shortcut name\nExec=xdg-open https://example.com/\nType=Application\nIcon=applications-internet\n\nDon't forget to include the protocol (https:// in this case), or xdg-open will be looking for a directory instead.\nThen, make sure to right click the file on the desktop and select \"Allow Launching\" (Ubuntu 20.04) to turn it into a desktop icon.\n\nA: Wow this was sticky!

You should pass for 11.04, 11.10, 12.04 LTS and then you land to 12.10.\nSecond, that method of upgrade is too long and complicated, and there are a bunch of things that could go wrong (actually you have reached that stage). You will need to download ~12GiB worth of updates to reach the 12.10 release.\nThird, because of first and second, it will be more easy and less precarious just doing a backup of your important stuff, download the ISO for Ubuntu 13.04 or 12.04 LTS from the main page, burn it or create a live usb and install Ubuntu. There is a full guide here in how to do so.\n", "Q: Lubuntu 13.04 minimal auto-login deosn't work I have install lubuntu 13.04 minimal on an old netbook.\nI would like to use autologin.\nI have changed the first lines of /etc/lxdm/default.conf to the following:\nautologin=arthur\ntimeout=3\nsession=/usr/bin/startlubuntu-netbook\n\nBut it doesn't change anything. Everytime I start the netbook I have to choose my user and enter the password.\nThanks!\nRegards,\nArthur\n\nA: Try this, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo su\nnano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf or nano /etc/lxdm/lightdm.conf\n\nMake sure that the following two lines are in there, save the file and exit, reboot to test.\nautologin-user=USERNAME\nautologin-user-timeout=0 \n\n", "Q: Google Chrome update won't install due to unmet dependencies There was an update for Google Chrome today, and it wasn't installable due to unresolved dependencies. How can I correct this?\n\n\nA: See, I am also having this problem, and I did a little research of my own to see what the issue was. Also, I have the same exact errors that were posted.\nAs it turns out, the Google Code Developers for 32-bit Ubuntu/Debian Google Chrome \"made a goof,\" and accidentally added those dependencies which are of 64-bit architecture, and inaccessible by 32-bit Ubuntu/Debian. The 64-bit program is working fine, as it turned out.\nAll we can do is wait until another update comes out that will fix this issue; I am currently waiting patiently, using Chromium as my backup. Make sure to update/install when a new Google Chrome version is released as it will possibly--and hopefully--fix this issue.\nIf you can not wait, I have read that the unstable/beta version of Chrome does not have this issue as it was resolved during the development of this new version. You can download it here.\nI would only download that if you can not wait or use another browser until the stable update comes out.\nsource: Google Chrome update won't install due to unmet dependencies\n\nA: You have probably encountered this bug: Wrong 64-bit dependencies on 32-bit version of Ubuntu. It's being worked on. \nAll I can suggest is that you keep watching that bug's progress and stay on your current version until it's well and truly fixed. There are a few comments there indicating that it's fixed but then look at a more recent bug report which has been merged into #304017, which is why I'm suggesting patience. If you wish, just sudo untick the Google Chrome ppa in your Software Sources for now. You can re-enable it whenever you wish.\n\nA: Try this.\nDownload dummy packages:\nwget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85403877/ubu13-chrome-fix/lib32gcc1_4.7.3-1ubuntu1_all.deb\nwget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85403877/ubu13-chrome-fix/lib32stdc%2B%2B6_4.7.3-1ubuntu1_all.deb\nwget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85403877/ubu13-chrome-fix/libc6-i386_2.17-0ubuntu5_all.deb\n\nThen install them:\nsudo dpkg -i lib32gcc1_4.7.3-1ubuntu1_all.deb lib32stdc++6_4.7.3-1ubuntu1_all.deb libc6-i386_2.17-0ubuntu5_all.deb\n\nThen you can install Google Chrome:\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_i386.deb\n\n\nA: I was experiencing exactly the same problem, on two different 32-bit 12.04 machines; see Unable to select Chrome updates on Ubuntu 12.04\nHowever, I can report that as of noon EST on 23 Oct 2013, the problem seems to be resolved for me.  The Chrome update could be selected, and it installed successfully.\n", "Q: Frequent GUI pauses in Ubuntu 13.04 / Unity / Intel HD4000 I'm experiencing very frequent (and regular) GUI pauses on my system. \nEvery 30 seconds (pretty much exactly) the GUI will freeze for maybe .25 to .5 seconds. The mouse stops moving, keys stop echoing and a stopwatch timer briefly pauses. \nI'm using the Intel Graphics driver available from: https://download.01.org/gfx/ubuntu/13.04/main\nI've looked in a few places and tried a few things for a solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've checked cron and anacron for scheduled processes. \n\n*I've disabled background processes (eg mysql, postgres, apache) not that these were doing anything anyway\n\n*I've checked the following posts and tried the suggestions there:\nUnity GUI pauses/freezes for less than a few seconds\nHow to go about troubleshooting frequent system pauses\nI've watched the system using top and System Monitor and there are no spikes (or even blips) of cpu usage when the pauses occur. \nThere are no obvious error messages in dmesg or syslog \nThere is loads of free RAM (8GB+) and no swap usage\nIf it helps it's a ZooStorm i5 laptop with a HD4000 GPU, 16GB Ram and an SSD.\nAny help / suggestions would be very gratefully received.\n\nA: Ok, problem solved for me at least.\nI ended up doing a clean install of 13.10 and using the open source MESA driver available from this ppa: https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/graphics-drivers/\n13.10 works perfectly for me so far, compiz settings works great (wobbly windows FTW), and the mouse pad has even started working again.\n", "Q: How to bring up wireless after it sometimes goes down on reboot (wlan0 up gives error)? I run (K)Ubuntu 12.10/12.04 in a triple boot with Windows 7 and access the Intenet wirelessly. This works perfectly most of the time. Sometimes after a normal reboot, the wireless connection dissapears. In Ubuntu, it manifests itself in \"Device not ready\" being shown in Network Manager, and in Kubuntu, the WLAN Interface is \"Unavailable\" in the corresponding KDE Network Manager widget. Normally, when available, my wireless connection's SSID is displayed and I automatically get connected to it.\nAt this point, the only thing that helps me get back the wireless is booting in and out of Windows 7 and then back to (K)Ubuntu. However, I would like to be able to fix the problem without having to rely on Windows 7 being there.\nBelow are some relevant command outputs I've used for debugging:\nuser@user-desktop:~$ lspci -nnk | grep -iA2 net\n02:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

Wireless appears to be lost randomly sometimes on a reboot (both after installing some updates and also when none were installed before the reboot)\n2. When it is lost in one of the (K)Ubuntu's, it is also unavailable in the other one after booting into it\n3. The only thing that brings back the wireless is rebooting into Windows 7 and back\nHow can I re-enable my wireless in this case?\n\nA: Have you ever tried manually adding the server back onto your list? Just go under your internet tab and hit \"edit connections\". Click on the wireless tab and hit add. You have to know the server's name and password, but I'm sure you do. If that doesn't work maybe try rebooting your wi-fi by unplugging it and then plugging it back in.\n", "Q: Securely erase hard drive using the Disk Utility I am planning on selling my laptop. So I formatted my disk using the Disk Utility and chose to overwrite the disk with zeroes.\nTwo questions:\nIs this the same as overwriting the disk using dd?\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda\n\nAnd is this method secure enough so that buyers can't easily recover the previous data? Or should I take additional measures (like encrypting the disk, destroying the headers, etc.)?\n\nA: Yes, the disk utility uses a method similar to the one with dd you describe, or a faster and more secure one more like:\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda bs=1M\n\nThis introduces a lot more fuzz to the overwriting pattern than zeros only, which should be more difficult to restore but not noticeably slower to perform.\nSome people claim, this is not enough and one should overwrite hard disks multiple times and with more elaborate patterns (scrub(1) can do both of that as per the other answer), but most will say once is enough, if an attacker wants to restore more than a few bits with a significant chance.\nEdit: Apparently /dev/urandom peaks at ~13 MiB/s on at least two systems including mine. Therefore simonp suggested a different approach using openssl(1):\nhead -c 32 /dev/urandom | sudo openssl enc -rc4 -nosalt -pass stdin -in /dev/zero -out /dev/sda\n\n\nA: Another option for reference is to use the ATA Secure Erase method using hdparm.\nThe problem with using OS level commands such sa DD is that they will only erase blocks seen by the OS. Any spare blocks (especially reserved cells on SSDs) will not be erased.\nhttps://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase\n\nTo reiterate: (2017-Jul)\nThe ONLY plausible method (for HDD, SSHD and SSD) is to use the ATA 'Enhanced Secure Erase' (ESE) command to 'remove' all stored and residual data.\nIf this command can NOT be used, the media needs to be 'destructed' (converted to <2mm size fragments, or melted in a furnace).\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*This advice ignores older magnetic-media (from pre-2001 and/or less then 15GB in capacity).\n\n*Some PC BIOS (or OS) block the ATA command(s) from being run, and some (much older) brand/models (of drive) are problematic, due to poor implementation of ESE.\n\n*The lesser ATA 'Secure Erase' command is faster but only overwrites with 'zeros', rather than a random pattern.\n\n*The only truly better method than using ESE is NOT having data on the drive in the first place. This can be achieved by using full-disk encryption (FDE) or self-encrypting drives (SED).\n\n\nA: The \"bootom line\" AFIK is that the data has to be over written or it can be retrieved. There are many tools / methods to do this. \nThe consensus is that you only have to make one pass, so additional passes take additional time and put excessive wear and tear on the hard drive.\nWhile there are many solutions, I prefer scrub.\nscrub /dev/sda\n\nOr if you prefer\nscrub -p dod /dev/sda\n\nSee also\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-unix-make-retrieving-data-more-difficult.html\n\n*http://www.robwhalley.co.uk/secure_erasing.html\n\n*http://linux.die.net/man/1/scrub\n\n*http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-89862-7_21\n\nA: Nwipe, it's a fork of DBAN but unlike DBAN is actively in development.

There is no Downloads folder there. Say your username is johndoe. In this case your home folder will be /home/johndoe. \nEither way, it is easier to use ~ which is a substitute to your home folder.\n", "Q: Architectures EM64T® , x86-64 , ia32 , IA64 , Intel®64 , x86 , amd64 , amd32 Which packages should install for Architectures EM64T® , x86-64 , ia32 , IA64 , Intel®64 , x86 , amd64 , amd32 , Mach64 ?\n\nA: In practice, on modern Windows and GNU/Linux, the following are indistinguishable (meaning, if your system claims to support at least one of these, the same software will run on these):\n\n\n*\n\n*EM64T\n\n*x86-64\n\n*Intel 64\n\n*amd64\n\n\nLikewise for these:\n\n\n*\n\n*ia32\n\n*x86\n\n*amd32\n\n\nIA64 is \"Itanium\", which is a totally different architecture that is not in any way related to any of the above. \nAlso, all modern CPUs that support the first group (amd64, etc.) also support code compiled for the second group (x86, etc.) because 64-bit CPUs can execute 32-bit code in a sort of compatibility mode.\nThere's also an x32 architecture, which is a very new development in software and currently only supported on GNU/Linux, which uses 32-bit addresses, with the 64-bit (amd64) architecture.\nSo, throwing out all the marketing terminology, what we really have as far as distinct software compatibility environments is:\n\n\n*\n\n*amd64, which uses the 64-bit instruction set and uses 64-bit virtual addresses (actually 48-bit in current implementations);\n\n*x86, which uses the 32-bit instruction set and uses 32-bit virtual addresses;\n\n*IA64 also known as Itanium, which runs on \"Itanium\" CPUs only (and uses a 64-bit virtual address);\n\n*x32, which uses the 64-bit instruction set and 32-bit virtual addresses (basically the instructions/registers from amd64, and the memory model of x86). This results in slightly reduced memory usage in sacrifice for a lower maximum memory per process.\n\n", "Q: Different versions of libstdc++6 on 12.04 After upgrading Server 10.04 to 12.04, I was receiving errors related to lgcc_s while trying to compile with g++ and gcc. There are several versions of libgcc_s installed in /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/, including 4.6 and 4.8. If I create a symlink to the libgcc_s.so in the 4.6 directory to /usr/lib so its on my path, the compilation gives the error ld: unable to find lgcc_s. If I link the version from the 4.8 folder, everything works. Checking the version of libstdc++6 gives\napt-cache policy libstdc++6\nlibstdc++6:\n  Installed: 4.8.1-2ubuntu1~10.04.1\n  Candidate: 4.8.1-2ubuntu1~10.04.1\n  Version table:\n *** 4.8.1-2ubuntu1~10.04.1 0\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     4.6.3-1ubuntu5 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/main amd64 Packages\n\nThe version of g++ is 4.6.3.\nOn a clean 12.04 install, only the 4.6 directory is available in /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/. Further, the output of apt-cache policy libstdc++6 is\nlibstdc++6:\n  Installed: 4.6.3-1ubuntu5\n  Candidate: 4.6.3-1ubuntu5\n  Version table:\n *** 4.6.3-1ubuntu5 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nWhy are the versions of libstdc++6 different after the install? Why does linking the library from the 4.8 directory work but the 4.6 directory doesn't? How can I remove the 4.8 version of libstdc++6 without wrecking its dependencies (which are pretty much every program on the system)?\nFinally, the overarching reason for asking these questions is that I'm trying (and failing) to build several software packages (Cantera and RDKit) that are failing at various C++ compiler steps. I want to eliminate the gcc as the source of the problem, and this inconsistency sticks out to me.\n\nA: As you see in the clean installation the 4.8.1-2ubuntu1~10.04.1 version of the package doesn't exist in precise (I'm wondering from where you got it, since only saucy has that package, maybe a PPA). The best method is removing the package and installing from the repositories. In some cases apt-get will refuse so you must force it to do your will:\nsudo apt-get -f install libstdc++6=4.6.3-1ubuntu5\n\nI would check for other packages that might have the same condition.\n", "Q: How do I find out the kernel version I am running? \nThe path to previous driver is\nusually /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/net/wireless\n\nI need this info so I can finish updating my STA Broadcom wireless. However, I'm a noob at Ubuntu and I'm not sure how to find the kernel version or kernel.\nI checked /lib/modules/ and found this:\n2.6.27-10-generic  2.6.32-30-generic  2.6.32-34-generic  2.6.32-38-generic\n2.6.27-7-generic   2.6.32-31-generic  2.6.32-35-generic  3.2.0-54-generic\n2.6.28-19-generic  2.6.32-32-generic  2.6.32-36-generic  3.2.0-54-generic-pae\n2.6.31-23-generic  2.6.32-33-generic  2.6.32-37-generic\n\nWhich one is the running kernel?\nAnother question. Is there a snippet so I don't have to cut and paste?\nThanks for your time! :)\n\nA: uname -a and uname -r will give you the information of the kernel used.\n\nA: if you don't want to open a terminal, you can view your kernel version using gnome-system-monitor. Look for the system monitor in the menu and look in the first tab System.\n\n\nA: You can use the two following commands:\nuname -r \n\nfor version - output like:\n3.5.0.17-generic\n\nand\nuname -v\n\nfor update time - output like:\n#-ubuntu SMP Tue Oct 9 19:32:08 UTC 2012\n\n\nA: The official version of an Ubuntu kernel is found in the /proc/version_signature file (mainline kernels may lack this file, in which case uname -r is sufficient).\nThis file contains both the full Ubuntu version of the kernel and the mainline version on which it is based. The first field is always Ubuntu, the second field is the Ubuntu kernel version, and the final field is the upstream version:\n\n$ cat /proc/version_signature\nUbuntu 2.6.35-6.9-generic 2.6.35-rc3\n\nThis and many questions just like it are answered in Ubuntu Kernel Team's wiki specifically the FAQ.\n\nA: Well there are multiple ways to find the kernel version\nOpen terminal and execute:\nuname -r\n\nIt would display something like:\n3.8.0-30-generic\n\nYou can get further information on the current kernel with\nuname -a\n\nIt would display something like:\nLinux saurav-P4I45Gx-PE 3.8.0-30-generic #44~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Aug 23 17:33:45 UTC 2013 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\n\nAnother way to know the kernel version is to open Synaptic Package Manager and search for linux image. You have to check for the installed Kernel version.\nAnother way to find version of installed kernels is to run this command:\ndpkg -l | grep linux-image | grep ii\n\nor for just the version strings:\ndpkg -l | grep linux-image | grep ii | awk '{print $3}'\n\nThe latest kernel (the one with the highest version number) will boot by default, so if you have rebooted since the last kernel update, and you have not made adjustments to boot into a kernel other than the default, then you can be reasonably confident that the highest version number displayed will be the version of the running kernel, but you should use uname for more reliable information.\n\nA: On systems that follow the FHS you should be able to get the kernel information with the following command:\ncat /proc/version\n\nAlso, you can see other kernels that you have installed on your system and may be able to boot into with GRUB or another bootloader by using the following command:\nls /boot/vmlinuz*\n\n", "Q: Why is the monitor's backlight turning off, when I use the Intel® Sandybridge Mobile drivers? Recently, I have installed Ubuntu on my Acer Aspire Notebook. Everything works flawlessly, except for the graphics card. For example when I try to watch movies they run at a much lower frame rate than in Windows. I suspect the system is running in VGA mode.\nTherefore I checked the boot options with cat /proc/cmdline, and it seems nomodeset is activated. However, if I try to remove that, the Display turns off.\n\nA: Finally I have found the problem, and solved it. The problem was apparently that the monitor backlight was completely switched off. Until now I have used the Bootoption nomodeset to prevent it. However, I just had to add the following boot options instead:\nacpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi=Linux video.use_bios_initial_backlight=0\n\n", "Q: why do i keep getting the message network autoconfiguration failed I am unable to install because it says my network is not using the dhcp protocol. I have no idea what that is. There is currently no Os on my computer as I have a brand new hard drive. I am connected to the internet via cable.\n\nA: DHCP is the protocol that is used to configure networking on a device. It provides a new device with the networking information it needs, such as IP address, netmask, default gateway, DNS servers, and optionally other information such as NTP servers.\nThe box at the other end of the cable that is plugged in to your computer's ethernet port should be providing this information.\n", "Q: no access to delete files within /tmp I've deleted a similar posting I made to clarify this issue so it's not a double post.\nmy /tmp folder is full of random files. My actual storage space is fine but because there literally hundreds of thousands of these little files, before long I'll get errors due to the sheer number of files.\nI've tried various options like running cron and various sudo rm file* but after I installed Midnight Commander and tried to delete, I received this note:\n\"shell commands will not work when you are on a non-local file system\"\nSo, how do I get local? I've been trying via the Terminal command line on Mac, then I tried all the same things via VMWare but no go. I tried straight Linux commands as well as using Midnight Commander. With the pure Linux I had no errors nor indication that rm wasn't working until I ran another ll commmand and saw the files so at least I received that note above from Midnight Commander.\nMy permissions are set the same as the testing/dev server which is identical to the live server where I'm having problems but its /tmp folder is clean.\n\nA: First, the usual permission bits for the /tmp directory are 1777. The leading 1 indicates that the directory's sticky bit has been set, which means that although multiple users may write to the directory, they retain ownership of any files written there so that only they (or root) may delete them. Hence without sudo you will only be able to delete your own files from /tmp. As well, some files in /tmp may be open and/or locked by other processes and you should not attempt to delete them unless you know the locks are 'stale' - you can check for open files with lsof e.g.\n$ sudo lsof +d /tmp\n\nto see any open files at the top level of the directory, or\n$ sudo lsof +D /tmp\n\nto show open files anywhere in /tmp and its subdirectories - see the OUTPUT section of the lsof manpages man lsof for an explanation of what the various columns mean.\nThe second issue you are likely facing is that although commands like rm can take multiple filename arguments (including expanded wildcards or shell globs), there is a limit to the allowed length of the argument list. For example, if we create 100,000 files in /tmp\n# touch /tmp/file{000000..099999}\n# ls /tmp/file* | wc -l\n100000\n\n(so far so good) but if we add a further 100,000 files, the expanded shell glob (i.e. the list of files to be deleted) becomes too long for the ls command line \n# touch /tmp/file{100000..199999}\n# ls /tmp/file* | wc -l\n-bash: /bin/ls: Argument list too long\n0\n\nand similarly we can't delete in one go with rm\n# rm -f /tmp/file*\n-bash: /bin/rm: Argument list too long\n\nThe solution is to break down the wildcard list into manageable subsets - you did that manually, but it is possible to do it automatically using the xargs command e.g.\n# echo /tmp/file* | xargs rm -f\n\nYou could also have used the find command with a -exec or -execdir action and the {} + argument replacement syntax - from man find\n-exec command {} +\n              This  variant  of the -exec action runs the specified command on\n              the selected files, but the command line is built  by  appending\n              each  selected file name at the end; the total number of invoca-\n              tions of the command will  be  much  less  than  the  number  of\n              matched  files.   The command line is built in much the same way\n              that xargs builds its command lines.  Only one instance of  `{}'\n              is  allowed  within the command.  The command is executed in the\n              starting directory.\nfor example\n# find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -name 'file*' -type f -exec rm -f {} +\n\nalthough the xargs version will likely be faster if you only need to delete from the top level of /tmp (i.e. not from any subdirectories).\nIf the directory continues to fill up you should really investigate which users / processes are creating the files and why. If you changed /tmp's permissions you should reset them to 1777.\n\nA: If sudo rm -rf foldername not working then follow below procedure \nCheck with command \nwhich rm \n\nthen check the path. in my case it was /bin/rm then run command like\n/bin/rm -rf foldername\n\n", "Q: how to pass a{sv} arguments to gdbus? i have problem to passing the arguments of the function in a dictionary format (string,variant); i try to run a screencast in gnome and to start the function i need to pass these asrguments:\n-method name=\"Screencast\"-\n  -arg type=\"s\" direction=\"in\" name=\"file_template\"/-\n  -arg type=\"a{sv}\" direction=\"in\" name=\"options\"/-\n  -arg type=\"b\" direction=\"in\" name=\"flash\"/-\n  -arg type=\"b\" direction=\"out\" name=\"success\"/-\n  -arg type=\"s\" direction=\"out\" name=\"filename_used\"/-\n-/method-\n\nthis is my call:\n~$ gdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.Shell.Screencast --object-path /org/gnome/Shell/Screencast --method org.gnome.Shell.Screencast.Screencast \"test_ %d_ %t.webm\" {dict:string:variant:\"draw-cursor\",true,\"framerate\",35,pipeline,\"vp8enc min_quantizer=13 max_quantizer=13 cpu-used=5 deadline=1000000 threads=%T ! queue ! webmmux\"}\n\nthis is the rror output: \"a{sv}\": 0-33:can not parse as value of type 'a{sv}'.\nerror is in the syntax? thx\n\nA: a{sv} should be represented like:\n\"{'String': <'variant_value'>, 'String2': <'variant_value'>}\"\n\nTo figure this out I called org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.GetAll on some object interface because that returns a{sv}.\nFor example, the CreateInterface method in wpa_supplicant takes a{sv}:\ngdbus call -y -d fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1 -o /fi/w1/wpa_supplicant1 -m fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1.CreateInterface \"{'Ifname': <'wlan0'>}\"\n\nor to add multiple interfaces (a true array of string:variant):\n\"{'Ifname': <'wlan0'>, 'Ifname': <'wlan1'>}\"\n\n", "Q: How do I fix loud fan noise and heat on my Sony Vaio? I have Sony Vaio with AMD E2-2000 (1,75GHz) processor, 4GB RAM, and it runs Windows 8 as a default OS. After I installed Ubuntu 13.04, it worked but the fan sound got louder and the laptop would heat faster. What should I do to fix this problem?\nI have tried looking for Ubuntu Netbook Edition but it seems its no more supported.  \n\nA: I would recommend you TLP for advanced power management. It can be configured and finetuned in many ways. By default, it is optimized mainly for good battery life when running on battery (which also means less heat and fan noise), but battery mode can be enabled manually or you can configure it how you want. Look at this answer on askubuntu for details how to use it.\n\nA: I also have this problem in a Vaio. In my case I have to switch off the main GPU and keep working only the integrated one in each system start.

I mean setting up a Minecraft Server/Client as a kiosk shouldn't be that difficult, should it?\nAll in all, how do I set up a blank Ubuntu server that runs only Minecraft (or other jar file)?\n\nA: You can do this very easily using Workbench, a web-based Linux configuration and build system created by my company, RapidRollout (I am the founder). Workbench has built-in support for configuring a Java application to run as a kiosk application like you describe.

Welcome to Ubuntu!\n\nA: Can't comment yet (I wish reputation worked between stackoverflow and askubuntu). Akshar is right.\nThe problem is that Windows decides to place files all over the partition, not just at the beginning and fill to the end. The resize partition system inside Windows does NOT move files to another part of the partition that is empty, so if it sees files very near the end, it just gives up.

I am computer friendly however I am very unfamiliar with Linux/ubuntu. Im not even sure I know what it is. I just cant afford to buy windows 7.\n\nA: You do not need the Internet on the computer you are installing Ubuntu on; however, you will need the Internet to get Ubuntu. You will need a blank DVD or a USB drive to create an install disk. There are some excellent instructions on the Ubuntu website. Also, does the \"other PC\" have a hard drive? The disk size for installing a Linux-based operating system is fairly small and a 1.5 TB hard drive seems a bit overkill. You can install Ubuntu to the 1.5TB hard drive on the \"other PC\", but I wouldn't install it on the \"decent PC\". The potential to hose your working PC is too great if you are not experienced. So here are some steps to follow:\n\n\n 1. Create an Ubuntu install disk on your \"decent PC\".\n 2. For best results, if your \"other PC\" has a hard drive, use that disk to install Ubuntu on to.\n 3.

However, I am trying to combine this into one command, and \npython ~/Downloads/usbmuxd-1.0.8/python-client/tcprelay.py -t 22:2222\nssh -l root -p 2222 127.0.0.1\n\ndoes not work. After running the python command, I cannot run any other commands in that window. How would I go about putting these two commands together?\nThank you\n\nA: You need to let the first command run in the background and start the second one after the first has been initiated. I'm sure there is a more elegant way (of sorts) but this should do the trick.\n\npython ~/Downloads/usbmuxd-1.0.8/python-client/tcprelay.py -t 22:2222 &\nssh -l root -p 2222 127.0.0.1\n\nThe ampersand at the end tells bash to run the python command in the background.\nIn the event you need to run the script a second time you might need to find the running python command and kill it, before you can run it a second time. Else it will complain that the port is already blocked.\n\nA: An adaptation of MadMike's answer, you can use the following commands:\npython ~/Downloads/usbmuxd-1.0.8/python-client/tcprelay.py -t 22:2222 &\n\nwhile ! (: < /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/2222) 2>/dev/null; do\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\nssh -l root -p 2222 127.0.0.1\n\nThis will execute the python program in the background, then wait (checking once a second) until internal port 2222 is open. It will then run the ssh program.\nSource for checking if a port is open\n", "Q: how to check S.M.A.R.T., hdd performance etc, on VPS There are a little bit problem.\nOn local machine (own), all works fine, but, since I moved my projects to VPS (you know, internet all the time, electricy backups and so on), I notified, that a lot of programs aren't work or aren't work properly.\nI couldn't check SMART on my VPS\nsudo apt-get install smartmontools\nsudo smartctl --all /dev/sda\nresults:\nsmartctl open device: /dev/sda failed: No such device\nSo, how can I check SMART and performance on VPS?\n\nA: Disk Statics i/O can be monitored using \nsar -b\n\nThis will show the CPU static \nsar\n\nThis will show the i/o every 5 secs \niostat -x 1\n\nDiagonis Hight I/O Wait using command \nsudo iostat\n\nsudo iotop\n\nConfigure sysstat\nedit the file under\nvim /etc/default/sysstat\n\nENABLED=\"false\"\n\nto\n\nENABLED=\"true\"\n\nIN VPS u cant check the SMART , i think so , But not confirmed \nIm using monit to monitor Our VPS server's\n", "Q: ffmpeg - Create a mp3 file with album art from an mkv file I want to create an mp3 file from a given mkv file using ffmpeg\nthe output of ffmpeg -i is as follows\n\nSeems stream 0 codec frame rate differs from container frame rate: 59.94 (2000000/33367) -> 29.97 (30000/1001)\nInput #0, matroska,webm, from 'Spiral - 09.mkv':\n  Duration: 00:23:09.65, start: 0.000000, bitrate: N/A\n    Chapter #0.0: start 0.097000, end 1389.654000\n    Metadata:\n      title           : 00:00:00.097\n    Stream #0.0: Video: h264 (High), yuv420p, 640x428, PAR 1:1 DAR 160:107, 23.98 fps, 29.97 tbr, 1k tbn, 59.94 tbc (default)\n    Stream #0.1(jpn): Audio: aac, 48000 Hz, stereo, s16 (default)\n    Stream #0.2: Audio: aac, 48000 Hz, stereo, s16\n    Stream #0.3: Subtitle: [0][0][0][0] / 0x0000 (default)\n\nNow I used the following command to create the file.

I've downloaded Ubuntu 13.10 daily CD and I want to upgrade all my computers using this Live CD (they all run Ubuntu 13.04 presently).\nHow can I upgrade to Ubuntu 13.10 exploiting the packages in the CD? Is there any standard procedure for this?\nI tried this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I rebooted into Live CD, searching for an option like \"Upgrade from 13.04 to 13.10\" (I think it used to appear in the alternate CD) but found nothing like that. -EDIT- Even if the option is not present it is possible to \"mimic it\" by entering manual partitioning and tell Ubuntu to reuse the existing partitions without formatting them. Ubuntu will keep user's data and install the updated software. Nevertheless this is not a viable solution because after the upgrade one has to reinstall all the programs he needs, since it is like having a vanilla Ubuntu.\n\n*I booted into Ubuntu 13.04 and added the CD to my software sources. I then proceeded with the upgrade however the CD was never accessed and everything was downloaded from the web.\n\n\nI know, I know... I have other options rather than using the Live CD, namely:\n\n\n*\n\n*Forget the CD and setup apt-cacher in the LAN\n\n*Copy the deb files from the CD into /var/cache/apt/archives/\nBut this looks unreasonable to me... Why can't I insert the CD and exploit its contents? I would like to avoid apt-cacher and if possible avoid also manually copying the packages.\nAny idea on how to accomplish this?\n\nA: You need the Alternate CD/DVD, which has all the packages required to perform upgrade. In other words, it is a replacement for the on-line access to Ubuntu repositories.\nThe Live CD contains only the current version of Ubuntu and its packages and just copies that over to your drive after dealing with partitioning.\n", "Q: `Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library. ` when starting apps from the commandline I didn't get an answer but I wasn't doing anything and this is an interesting topic.

Don't use cfdisk as it is an old buggy POS that only understands the msdos partition table, which doesn't support disks > 2TB.  Use parted instead, which supports gpt.\nMore importantly, I don't think you even have a partition table in the raid array.  It is more typical to just format the whole array rather than partition it up, so just try mounting the array.\n", "Q: Juju didn't configure rabbitmq for openstack? I have installed ubuntu Openstack HA with juju with all 24 servers. But my openstack is not working at all. On dashboard on every page I get errors saying \"could not retrieve usage information\", \"could not retrieve volume information, \"could not retrieve .....etc   \nI spent hours and have discovered that juju has not done configuration correctly. I found that on cloud controller in nova.conf juju has added rabbitmq vhost entry, but that virtual host is not added in rabbitmq. Then how is it supposed to work? And on juju-gui canvas rabbitmq is all green and is working fine, which in reality it is not.\nI am really wondering if juju has really done correct configuration in all 24 servers now, I am getting the feeling that it would have been faster if I would have done openstack deployment manually instead of using juju. Why was the virtual host entry not added in rabbitmq? How should I solve this?\n\n\nA: To resolved your immediate problem (lack of vhost creation in RabbitMQ - which is odd) I'd remove and then re-add the relation between nova-cloud-controller and RabbitMQ:\njuju remove-relation rabbitmq-server nova-cloud-controller\njuju add-relation rabbitmq-server nova-cloud-controller\n\nThis should force re-creation of the vhost in RabbitMQ; the RabbitMQ charm should have done this anyway so it would be good to dig into this further to figure out what went wrong; are any vhosts listed if you login to one of the rabbitmq service units and run:\nsudo /usr/sbin/rabbitmqctl list_vhosts\n\nThe problem you are seeing would indicate a bug in the charm/some sort of race condition during cluster bring-up for RabbitMQ. \n", "Q: How to move specific files while preserving their directory structure I have large directory with lots of files and directories on a remote Windows system where I only have FTP access.\nI had to do some modifications in some of the files, so I downloaded the whole directory to run a find and replace command in files recursively.\nUsing Git locally, I was able to get the list of modified files. (Their is no Git on the Windows system, so I can't push/pull. Besides, I only have FTP access.)\nNow I need to update the files on the Windows system. Uploading file by file manually can be frustrating as there are a lot of modified files.\nSome of the files are located in subdirectories and sub-subdirectories.\nFor example this structure (There are a lot more files):\n./\n |--- file1\n |--- file2\n |--- dir1\n |     |--- file1.1\n |     |--- dir1.1\n |           |---- file1.1.1\n |--- dir2\n       |--- file2.1\n       |--- file2.2\n       |--- file2.3\n\nHow can I copy them (or moving them is even fine) to a new location, while preserving their directory structure.\nThis way, in my FTP client, I would just move the whole folder. It will manage the directory structure by itself.\nKeep in mind, that the subdirectories have other unmodified files in them, which I do not want to be copied.\nGit gave me this list, so it did half the work:\nfile1\nfile2\ndir1/file1.1\ndir1/dir1.1/file1.1.1\ndir2/file2.1\ndir2/file2.2\ndir2/file2.3\n\n\nA: Why don't you use curlftpfs? I think that would be simpler that uploading and downloading a whole directory structure.\nsudo apt-get install curlftpfs\n\nMount a remote ftp filesystem:\ncurlftpfs -v user:password@ftp-server.com/path/ /mnt/\n\nThen edit or modify whatever you have to, and unmount the fs.

I'm running my bash script like this:\nARCHIVE=/path/to/archive ./myScript\n\nin my script I am doing this:\n#find the number of non-empty directories in the given dir \ndirs=$(find $ARCHIVE -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -not -empty -type d | wc -l)\n#find the number of files in the given dir\nmsgs=$(find $ARCHIVE -type f | wc -l)\n\necho \"Number of directories: $dirs\"\necho \"Total number of messages: $msgs\"\n\nThis works great when I am running the script on a subset of the data I'm looking at, which is located in a dir at the same level as the script. However, the actual data is in someone else's directory and when I run it with the ARCHIVE variable set to that location, both values return as 0. I have a similar script that I use as well, and the find command there does not work on the second directory either.  Strangely enough, I use some egrep commands and they work just fine for both. \nWhy can I not use find in this manner?\n\nA: Try passing the directory you want to search as a parameter to the bash script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n# First argument to script shall be directory in which to search\nARCHIVE=$1 \n\n#find the number of non-empty directories in the given dir \ndirs=$(find \"$ARCHIVE\" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -not -empty -type d | wc -l)\n#find the number of files in the given dir\nmsgs=$(find \"$ARCHIVE\" -type f | wc -l)\n\necho \"Number of directories: $dirs\"\necho \"Total number of messages: $msgs\"\n\nRunning the script, called dirfiles, on my home directory:\n$ ./dirfiles ~\nNumber of directories: 27\nTotal number of messages: 8703\n\nAnd on /usr/lib:\n$ ./dirfiles /usr/lib\nNumber of directories: 161\nTotal number of messages: 9630\n\nFurthermore, find offers three ways to resolve symbolic links:\n\n\n*\n\n*-P: don't follow symbolic links\n\n*-L: follow symbolic links\n\n*-H: don't follow symbolic links except when processing command line arguments.\n\n\nIf you don't want to follow symlinks, but $ARCHIVE happens to be one, then perhaps -H is the way to go. \n\nA: This is happen because probably you don't have read permissions in someone else's directory. If you don't have read permissions, you can't view/search/find any content. You can check this with the following command:\nls -l /home/username/directory\n\nAlso be sure that those files or directories for which you search are really files or directories (first character from 10 character string permission is - or d, not something else - l in your case which stands for symbolic links).\n\nls shows permissions as a 10 character string, for example -rw-r--r--.

Hello there I have recently downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 and installed it alongside with my windows7. After I finished my installation it asked me to upgrade and I upgraded but after that my Ubuntu desktop became 12.10. Now again it asks me to upgrade to 13.04. \nI am really confused cause as on the Ubuntu download center it is stated that Ubuntu 12.04 will have support till 2017. \nWhat is really happening? Do I need to upgrade every time it asks me to upgrade or can I skip the upgrade. And what will happen to my first installed Ubuntu 12.04 version? Will it have support till 2017? \nI am really a beginner with Linux and Ubuntu. \n\nA: Ubuntu have two different release types\n\n\n*\n\n*Normal releases come out every six months and the next one 13.10 is due out tomorrow.  Normal releases are supported for 9 months\n\n*LTS (Long Term Stable) releases come out every two years and are supported for 5 years.  12.04 is the latest LTS release and is supported until April 2017.\nThe reason for the two different release types is that LTS releases remain stable for a long time so are useful for business and for those users who don't want to keep updating their system.  The Normal releases allow users to try all the latest features so that when the next LTS release comes out everything has been well tested for users who prize stability over new features.\nMany people such as myself only use LTS releases for day to day work and don't rush to install the next LTS release.\nIf you have only recently installed Ubuntu you may want to reinstall 12.04 so you don't have to keep updating.\nRun the update manager select Preferences and make sure Notify me of a new Ubuntu version is set to For long-term support versions as shown.\nYou will then not be notified of a new version until April 2014 and you can choose to update at any time you choose from then until support runs out in 2017.\n\n\nA: 12.04 will be supported until 2017. \nFor someone new to Ubuntu I would suggest sticking with that. \nSince you already upgraded and this is a fresh install (I assume), the easiest thing to do is reinstall Ubuntu 12.04. Since you have 12.10 installed, this time when you install from the liveCD you will have the option to replace the current 12.10 installation with 12.04. Do That. Then if you are ever asked to upgrade simply say No.\n\nA: Read this Links you will came to know About the Difference Between upgrade and dist-upgrade\nWhat is “dist-upgrade” and why does it upgrade more than “upgrade”? \nWhy use apt-get upgrade instead of apt-get dist-upgrade?\nClick here\n", "Q: Hot to update Ubuntu Server packages with yum update?

After more work, the forums and posts say it's a good idea to have Windows on first, then add Ubuntu. So I got my copy of Windows 7 (known working) and made a bootable usb stick with it.\nWhen I attempt to boot from the usb stick, I get a black screen for a couple of seconds, then Ubuntu boots.

How to start Putty in a maximized window in Ubuntu 12? \nWhen I use Windows, I use this method\nBut in Ubuntu, I don't have this option. \n\nA: You can start putty with -geometry option. For example:\nputty -geometry 1000x1000 hostname\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Apparently you cannot enlarge the initial (configuration) window with -geometry.\n\n*Also the -geometry setting is ignored if it is overwritten by the terminal size in Putty.\n\n\nActually the most convenient form to specify the size of the Putty window is by using the Putty configuration.  You can have different default settings by giving them with the -load option on the commandline.  See below.\nFollowing settings can be changed which affect the size of the resulting Window:\n\n\n*\n\n*Font (Category :: Window :: Fonts) by using another size\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Window Columns and Rows (Category :: Window)\n\n\n\nIf you only need a single setting, do it as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Putty\n\n*Click on Session\n\n*Click on Default Settings\n\n*Click on Load\nThen edit the above settings to your needs.  Afterwards do not forget to save it via:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on Session\n\n*Click on Default Settings (or, for additional settings as explained below, enter the name of the configuration you want to save in the textbox above Default Settings)\n\n*Click on Save\nNow if you open Putty the next time, enter the Host Name and click Open the altered Default Setting will be loaded and give your Screen the chosen size.\nBy copying this Default Setting to some small/medium/large setting, you can even have different defaults active when loading Putty.  All you have to do is to leave blank the Host Name in these additional defaults.  Then start it as follows, from shortcuts or commandline:\nputty -load small HOST\nputty -load medium HOST\nputty -load large HOST\n\nLeave HOST away if you want to enter it into Putty.  (If you leave away the -load XXX then Putty will use Default Settings).\nIf you save some configuration with a Host Name preset, and saved under HOST1 for example,\n\nyou can start this session directly from commandline by loading this configuration:\nputty -load HOST1\n\nYou can re-use this saved session as a template and override the Host Name as well from commandline, as follows\nputty -load HOST1 another.host.example.com\n\nHTH\nPS: Sometimes Putty is just a bit too straight forward to be easily understood ;)\n", "Q: Unpacking rar file gives empty folder I have a kinda weird problem.

I shrunk the main OS (Win 8) partition and then disabled fast boot in the power options in Win 8. Then I entered the UEFI and changed the mode to Legacy mode. Then booted from the Live USB drive and installed ubuntu. During installation I created 2 mount points (/ and swap) and when I tried to proceed it warned me of a requirement to have another boot partition of 1MB in size. I did that too. May be this was a mistake (dont know). Then tried to run ubuntu and things were fine. Restarted the laptop to see if Win 8 also worked. It did not and was asking to insert the Win 8 disk. I recalled there was a boot repair utility for ubuntu. I installed that and tried to repair the boot partition so that both OS would boot normally. The boot repair utility changed the mode to UEFI (I saw that happening) and then when I restarted the laptop I got the following message \nerror: file '/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod' not found \ngrub rescue> \nNow the problem is that I am not able to restore my system. I am not able to get into the BIOS. Nor does the laptop recognize a Live USB drive, nor do I have a Windows installer CD. Can anyone help me with this situation? \n\nA: You made the classic mistake (which the installer should prevent or at least warn you about, IMHO) of installing in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode to a computer that's already booting Windows in EFI mode. Given your current situation, your best hope of recovery is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and prepare the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. (You can do this with any working computer.)\n\n*Enter the firmware setup tool on the non-booting computer. I know you said you can't do this, but there must be a way to do it, even if it involves setting a jumper to clear the NVRAM or temporarily unplugging the hard disk.\n\n*In the firmware setup utility, disable Secure Boot. Note that the procedure to do this varies from one computer to another, so I can't offer a step-by-step procedure.\n\n*Boot the rEFInd medium. It should present options to boot both Linux and Windows. Test them both. If either doesn't work, it may be necessary to do something to fix the problem, so post back with details.\n\n*Boot to Linux.\n\n*Identify your EFI System Partition (ESP). This is a FAT partition that shows up in parted or GParted as having its \"boot flag\" set, or in gdisk as having a type code of EF00. It's normally one of the first two or three partitions on the disk, but it can reside elsewhere.\n\n*Type sudo mkdir -p /boot/efi.\n\n*If it's not already mounted there, mount your ESP on /boot/efi, as in sudo mount /dev/sda2 /boot/efi if the ESP is /dev/sda2.\n\n*Install the Debian-package version of rEFInd.\n\n*Edit /etc/fstab to ensure that the ESP will be mounted at /boot/efi when you reboot. (This step is recommended, but not required.)\n\n\nAt this point, your computer should boot from the hard disk using rEFInd. That said, there are buggy EFIs out there, so it's possible you'll run into problems. If so, post back with details.\nIf you want to use Secure Boot, you can do so, but you'll need to take extra steps to get rEFInd working with Secure Boot. See the rEFInd Secure Boot documentation for details.\nOne more point: Ubuntu 13.10 was released recently, so you might want to use it instead of 13.04. That said, I've not yet done a 13.10 installation, so I'm not sure if it's got any real advantages over 13.04. Chances are it does something better, though, at least on EFI-based systems, since EFI development for Linux has been proceeding at a fairly rapid clip over the past couple of years.\n", "Q: Manually start Kerio VPN I've installed Kerio VPN client for my Ubuntu (13.04 x64).

From what he says, XP will start to boot and then completely crash.  I haven't seen the laptop yet, but I'd like to explore the possibility of wiping the OS and installing Ubuntu. Would this be a possibility?  Should I look at burning Ubuntu to CD and trying to boot from the CD, or is there a way to get rid of the OS mess first, and then try and boot from a blank laptop?  I am not sure how the XP system got corrupted (whether it's a virus or perhaps something wrong with the laptop itself).  Any advice or tips on how to approach this (or whether it's worth it) would be greatly appreciated.  Thank yoU!\n\nA: There is no need to wipe the computer first. By installing with the option \"Replace Microsoft Windows ...\" the Windows partitions will be removed and formatted before Ubuntu is installed.\nSo on the software side, there is nothing to fear. You should still be careful if the \"corruption\" doesn't stem from old and/or unstable hardware. Do a stress test to be sure that your hardware is reliable. Also do run the Memory test from the Ubuntu live system.\n", "Q: How to fix Ubuntu 12.04.3 boot to black screen full of errors in white text, after upgrading on dell inspiron 1501 I am running a Dell Inspiron 1501\nI use Linux only. No Microsoft or Apple operating systems (or really anything closed-source). I've only been using Linux for a little over a year but I'm starting to gain a comfortable level of familiarity with the system and terminology.\nI've been having some issues with Quantel Quetzal and Raring Ringtail, especially with older hardware, so I opted to install Ubuntu 12.04.3 Precise Pangolin on the Inspiron 1501. I checked my MD5 sum after downloading my ISO and all was good. I have in fact used this iso/dvd to install Precise Pangolin successfully on a few other systems (some of which are even older than this laptop).\nInstall goes fine. The wireless card doesn't work out of the box but this is a known issue which is fairly easy to fix. So, first thing I did was open up a terminal and run\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nwhich, part way through, crashed (I assume lightdm and possibly X) and took me to a black screen filled with white lines of text that were either errors or just the ouputs of commands. The reason I say that is because I was unable to gleam any useful information from the output on the screen. I did take a picture however and will post a link. \nAfter that, every time I boot the system it goes right to that black screen posting all the error messages or output in white text. I never get a purple Ubuntu splash, so from what I can tell after reading this wiki article: \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/BlankScreen\nThat means that after the kernel is selected, it is unable to correctly implement the settings it needs. If the purple splash never shows, the frame buffer was never set correctly right? This leads me to believe that it could be a kernel issue? The wiki suggested to try and pinpoint the issue by rolling back kernels until I find one that works. Is this my best option? I think I'm going to give it a try anyways and will let everyone know if I am able to solve the issue this way.\nI have since done a few reinstalls and some trouble-shooting including a couple hours scouring the net for anyone with any kind of similar issue. Most of the issues I could find involved getting a black screen after login and none of them said anything about any information output on this black screen.\nMy reinstalls have taught me that there is no issue updating, but as soon as I run\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nmy system goes to the black screen and every time I boot it up it does the same thing. The only way to fix is by reinstall. I never get any ability to log in. After a hard power off to the laptop (because I cannot use ctrl+alt+del to reboot) when it boots again it goes to the grub boot menu and I can select between regular boot, recovery mode and the two memtest options. I never tried the memtest options but the other two both lead to the same black screen.\nSome people having a black/blank screen issue claim to have fixed it by using 12.10 or 13.04 but I believe they were having a different issue where they got a black/blank screen after logging in. I think I will still give these images a try, but mostly figured I would just wait another day or two for 13.10.\nOther things I figured I would try from the following three articles:\nAfter logging in, there's a black screen and my cursor, nothing else! in Ubuntu 12.10\nBlack Screen on Login\nAfter Upgrading to 12.04 I can't get to the login screen\ninclude opening a terminal using ctrl+alt+f1 and trying a variety of reseting unity, x settings, lightdm (or switching to gdm); but I doubt this will work or that I will even be able to access a terminal. I'm pretty sure the whole system is stuck after it loads the last line on the black screen. \nI will try these things and post more information when I have.

Simple question but hard answer, i searched around in Google a solution to make a dynamic widget to control and see the volume with Awesome Window manager but i can't find a working solution.\nAny one got a solution to this ?\n\nA: I simply followed the tutorial at http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Volume_control_and_display and it worked. However, volume control was only via keyboard. Is this what you were looking for?\nI should note that I'm on debian (testing) which I think uses awesome 3.4.\n-- Update: After some testing out, I found http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Farhavens_volume_widget, which has mouse controls (scroll mouse to control volume, and click to toggle mute). Following the tutorial works on my box.\n\nA: I'd like to mention following implementations just in case somebody is interested to have a volume control widget compatible with Awesome WM 4+:\n\nFrom left to right:\n\n\n*\n\n*volume widget\n\n*volumebar-widget\n\n*volumearc-widget\nAll three widgets support mouse control: scroll up/down - increases/decreases volume, click - toggles mute.\n\nA: If you have media keys you can use this\nawful.key({}, \"XF86AudioRaiseVolume\", function () awful.util.spawn(\"amixer -D pulse sset Master 2%+\", false) end),\nawful.key({}, \"XF86AudioLowerVolume\", function () awful.util.spawn(\"amixer -D pulse sset Master 2%-\", false) end),\nawful.key({}, \"XF86AudioMute\", function () awful.util.spawn(\"amixer -D pulse sset Master toggle\", false) end),\n\nin globalkeys in your rc.lua script\n\nA: volumeicon worked out of the box for me. Note that this is not an AwesomeWM widget but a standalone project written in C. The advantage of this over the Awesome widgets are: \n\n\n*\n\n*can use mouse to interact with widget and adjust volume (scroll wheel or dragging volume bar)\n\n*works out of the box with PulseAudio and multiple output sinks\n\n*configurable notifications when volume is adjusted (GTK+-style or FreeDesktop-style notifications, or none at all)\n\n*opens a mixer of your choice on middle click\n\n\n\nIf you'd prefer a pure Lua Awesome widget, here is a list of available ones: \n\n\n*\n\n*awesome-zen\n\n*streetturltle widgets (3 styles: 1, 2, 3)\n\n*lain (2 styles: 1, 2)\n\n*vicious\n\n*blingbling\n\n*obvious\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10, bumblebee and power management problem First of all my laptop is asus n55sf with ubuntu 13.10.\nI've installed bumblebee and it's working quite good (I've tried e.g. optirun firefox and it's working fine). \nRight now I have problem with power management.

If the process terminates unexpectedly, the disk space is freed.  MySQL does this:\n\nMySQL arranges that temporary files are removed if mysqld is terminated. On platforms that support it (such as Unix), this is done by unlinking the file after opening it. The disadvantage of this is that the name does not appear in directory listings and you do not see a big temporary file that fills up the file system in which the temporary file directory is located. (In such cases, lsof +L1 may be helpful in identifying large files associated with mysqld.)\n—http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/temporary-files.html\n\nImportant Point: When a file that is still open is deleted, the space is not actually freed on the disk until the last process holding a handle on the file closes it.  Until the file is closed, nobody, including root, can free that space other than by killing the process.  Conversely, killing (or gracefully stopping, if possible) the process should always free the space. \nSo I would recommend you take a look at what your system may have in the way of open and deleted files and this may give you something to go on.\nIn the case of my system, MySQL does have a number of temporary files open, some of them fairly large.\nIf you want to peek inside those files, it's easily done, though the nature of what you'll be able to discern varies widely.  Take the PID and the digits under FD that do this... example, PID 2842 FD 350:\n$ sudo strings /proc/2842/fd/350 | less\n\nIf MySQL does have deleted temporary files open, stopping and restarting MySQL will free up that space, and then you'll need to investigate what might be keeping those open of they are lingering longer than appropriate and whether you have queries that are generating inordinately large temporary tables and exhausting your /tmp space.  If your /tmp directory is its own partition/filesystem then df -h will give you a better answer regarding free and used space.  You probably don't need to worry too much about the actual size of the directory entry itself.\nAnd of course it might not be MySQL. :)\n\nA: ext[234] does not shrink the size of directories when you delete files; it just marks the entries as deleted so they can be reused later.  If you really want to reclaim those 34 MB, you will need to delete and recreate the directory, or boot into rescue mode and run e2fsck -D on the volume.\n", "Q: Buzzing sound when speaker idle i just installed Ubuntu, and am a new user.

I would like to install Ubuntu on a partition and leave the other NTFS partitions that I have as they are. I have data on them and I cannot move it at the moment.\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nA: Generally yes.\nNewest versions see chkdsk flag and will not let you mount it and see the hibernation flag and will not let you mount it either. But do not use hibernation if dual booting.\nBest not to write a lot into Windows system partition or c: drive. Read is fine. It is more that the Linux NTFS driver exposes all the hidden files & folders that Windows hides. So you can have accidents. I used to always change Windows to show hidden files and learned how to fix it after moving or deleting something I should not have.\nAlways a good idea to have a shared NTFS data partition or d: drive in Windows.

I am searching a way to see time in terminal while I use it parallel. The time would change automatically when it passes. It would be awesome if it would display left to my command prompt.\nIf this is my command prompt in terminal:\nsaurav@saurav-P4I45Gx-PE:~$\n\nThen I would like to see clock(time) as:\nsaurav@saurav-P4I45Gx-PE[06:27:01]:~$\n\nor\nsaurav@(06:27:01):~$\n\nor any other format. where 06:27:01 is the time. What I want is just to show the time which changes when seconds pass.\nSo is there any way to achieve this?\n\nA: I'm not sure that is so simple to achieve this using the default bash shell (but I'm not saying that it's impossible). You will probably need a command/function which is able to refresh the command prompt every second without interfering with anything you type on the prompt. \nThe Z shell (zsh) has a built-in command, called zle, which, when used with the reset-prompt argument, forces the prompt to be re-expanded, then redisplays the edit  buffer.\nIf you want to try it, use the following steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install Z shell with this command:\nsudo apt-get install zsh\n\n\n*When you run zsh for the first time, choose 0 when you are asked.\n\n*Edit the ~/.zshrc file and add the following lines:\nsetopt PROMPT_SUBST\nPROMPT='%B%F{red}%n@%m%f%F{yellow}[%D{%L:%M:%S}]%f:%F{blue}${${(%):-%~}}%f$ %b'\nTMOUT=1\n\nTRAPALRM() {\n    zle reset-prompt\n}\n\nSave the file and close it.\n\n*In your terminal, when you are still using zsh, run source ~/.zshrc, or simply zsh, to reset your prompt. Now your prompt should look like:\nsaurav@saurav-P4I45Gx-PE[1:25:21]:~$\n\nwith some colors.\n\n*If you like it, run chsh -s /bin/zsh to change your current shell to /bin/zsh (a re-login  is required for this change to take effect).\n\n*Run exit if you want to exit from zsh shell.\nHere is a 15 second screencast from my terminal:\n\n\nA: If you want to display running time in your terminal you can use this command.

You can view the bash documentation for other options.\n\nA: This question has been bothering me for a few days, and here's my edited post with all the material I've learned. Specifically , my goal was to achieve showing clock next to prompt in BASH. Just like Radu Radeanu mentioned in his answer, the key is to find a function or variable what is able to constantly refresh the command prompt or redraw the screen, without interfering with your screen or with whatever you type. While, this is possible to achieve with while loop, as shown by G_P, the constant redrawing of the screen with tput function messes up with whatever text is on my screen at the instant it refreshes. I've come pretty close to achieving what the OP asked by modifying somewhat the code G_P posted , but still I believe Radu's answer is the closest to what OP wants. Without further ado, here's some of the things I've learned, presented for your judgement.\n#1, My preferred solution: Terminal Multiplexer \nTerminal multiplexer is a software that allows splitting the terminal screen into two or more screens. In particular, I want to draw attention to Byobu terminal. This ncurses based terminal emulator, allows you to show time, CPU percentage, memory, and whole bunch of other indicators. In the screenshot from my byobu terminal you can see cpu temperature, battery percentage, internet connection quality, CPU frequency, RAM, date, and of course time. If you're mostly concerned with constantly monitoring these things while in terminal, Byobu is the way to go. In fact , I've come to like it so much, I've set it to automatically load while login into tty. The only quirk is that in tty you can't actually merge the separate windows - only switch between tabs with F3 and F4 keys.\n\nAn alternate solution involving multiplexing windows is by using splitvt, which splits the screen into two parts. You can run a terminal clock such as tty-clock , use watch command with date, or you can code one yourself with a script. More on that later.\nIn the screenshot you can see one part of the split with normal bash prompt on top, and in the lower one you can see a script running, that just constantly refreshes output of date command with clear command.\n\n#2 , While Do Loop and tput\nThis is probably the closent to what the person who asked the question wanted implemented with bash.\nG_P has posted a great solution involving the while do and tput commands. However in G_P's code there were two things I didn't like. One, the clock was to the right of the prompt, and two - because sleep cycle is 1 second (refer to the original code where it says sleep), the screen is redrawn every second, and that messes up my output. What I did, is to edit my bash prompt to be one line lower with \\n operator and change G_P's code so that tput operator would position the clock right above the prompt, and refresh every 60 seconds; that allows me to see hours and minutes (and I don't exactly care about minutes), while  the clock's loop doesn't mess up my screen. First, here's my prompt:\nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\n[*\\u@Ubuntu*]\\n $(date) :\\w\\$  ' \n\nAnd here's G_P's modified code: enter code here\n while sleep 60;do tput sc;tput cup 0 0;date +%R;tput rc;done &\n\nSmall edit: I've noticed that this code above doesn't bring up the clock right away sometimes. Here's a better version: while true; do tput sc;tput cup 0 0;date +%R;tput rc; sleep 60;  done &  This one places clock on screen first, then lets bash know to go through sleep cycle of 60 second\nNote, the tput cup 0 0 places clock into upper right corner of the screen, right above my prompt and sleep 60 changes sleep cycle to 60 seconds, because that way I can monitor only hours and minutes instead of every second. This way, whatever text i have on the screen isn't affected, for the most part (only when i happen to run a command the same time clock refreshes).\n\nPS1 line is already in your .bashrc profile, so you just need to tweak it a little. The while do loop should be added somewhere in the same file, preferably in the end with # comment that this is stuff you added initially. And don't forget to always back up any file like that just in case you make bubu and need to go back to the way it was.\n#3, Scripting and other\nThis part is merely for those who want to see time. For those who want to constantly monitor it, #1 and #2 are preferred options.\nSo as we already have seen the while do loop is pretty useful. Here's how you can create a clock with while do loop, date, and sleep commands.\n\nHit return/enter, and you basically will see output of date command shown on cleared screen every second.  If you don't want to type all that every time, turn all this stuff into  script: \n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile true\ndo\nclear;date\nsleep 1\ndone\n\nNow you can run that script with splitvt in one instance of bash, while working in the other.\nAnother solution is watch -n1 date command, which will continuously execute date command with period of 1 second. \nIn Conclusion: I've learned some things while trying to find the answer to this question, and I hope my findings helped you in some way, and I hope I was able to contribute on this question. Byobu terminal IMHO is the best solution, but decide for yourself, make some research, and choose whichever way works best for you. \nSome of the things I've found while researching:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repeat Command in Unix \n\n*Some Bash Prompt Examples\n\n*Floating Clock Prompt\nMy original post, the minimalistic solution: Edit your ~/.bashrc file. I prefer editing it with nano, so\nnano ~/.bashrc\n\nHere's the portion of my own edited file:\nif [ \"$color_prompt\" = yes ]; then\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\$'    \nelse\n   # PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}[*\\u@Ubuntu*]:\\w\\$ '\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}[*\\u@Ubuntu*]\\t:\\w\\$ '\nfi\n\nAfter else statement the first line is commented out with # (this is my old prompt), now the second line is the one you want, and specifically \\t operator. That shows running time in 24 hour format. For more info check out this . Also a small note, I'm using the stuff after else, because i'm not using colored prompt. \nPS: Please let me know if I should add anything to my answer or edit it in any way, but for the most part i believe this is most conclusive answer i could come up with, and at least I personally won't be adding anything new to it.\n\nA: If all you want to do is show a clock, just use date:\nwhile :; do date +%r; sleep 1 ; done\n\nThat will show the time every second until you stop it with CtrlC.

This means that you should access the server from your laptop, but you shouldn't allow the server to access the laptop in the same way.  It may not be obvious here, but with larger networks, this security problem becomes more evident.\nWhy not mount the remote directories locally, and then ssh into the machine (sshfs, fuse, fstab)?  Is it because the files on the laptop are updated, and those updated version are needed on the remote machine (rsync)? After the server runs, are the files updated and you need to then bring those processed copies down?  If you provided an example workflow, including the files, that information would be helpful to answer your question.\nYou say you want to be able to edit the files using local software, so you can set up sshfs on your laptop to connect to the remote server, so long as you're okay with not editing the files while not having access to the server.\nAnother option is to use rsync, which might be a better solution if the source of truth, or updated copies swap between the laptop and server.  You would be able to sync them both, and tell rysnc which system is the most up-to-date.\n\nIt sounds to me like you've just overthought this a bit, and instead of logging into the server and mounting your directories from the laptop, go ahead and mount those directories from the server to the laptop, and then ssh into the system.\nTo make all of this easier, look into setting up .ssh/config with PubKeyAuthentication.\n", "Q: Control Linux from Putty in Windows Is it possible to control a Linux machine (EDIT: like a bash/sudo terminal line) from Putty (or other SSH/Telnet client) that's running off another machine and operating system?

I'm quite sure that this package doesn't magically patch my kernel. For one thing, the current RTAI release does not even support the kernel that's running under my Ubuntu installation.\nSo what does that package do, and what is it useful for? It creates a folder named \"kernel-patches\" under /usr/src, that contains some .patch.gz files for some 2.6.x linux kernels. It also comes with some userland libraries (binaries and headers) that you would normally use to compile your RTAI application. When I try to compile a sample with those libraries, the executable, unsurprisingly, segfaults.\nThe package description describes what RTAI is and not what purpose that package is meant to serve.\n\nA: The RTAI package in Ubuntu is a collection of files necessary to patch a kernel. But this 'kernel' is not the one being used in your Ubuntu installation, is for kernel versions from www.kernel.org. This extract from the user manual from RTAI describes more on that:\n\nThis means that RTAI is designed to run on a standard Linux kernel\n  which can be downloaded from http://www.kernel.org and not on the\n  kernel's source code that comes with the most common distributions...\n\nThe other files, besides the patches, are for programming userland application. They are libraries, 'includes', etc.\n\nA: Has no purpose actually. Cause RTAI needs untouched vanilla kernel. So mostly this package does not work for installed kernel.\nAlso RTAI patch is compatible with specific kernel that has to be downloaded for patch and make real time applications work for you.\n", "Q: No audio while tab casting with Chromecast and Chromium I just got my Chromecast and it rocks, but I can't seem to get it to play audio while tab-casting from Chromium.

Why is writing a program in text files or via the terminal a better option (as I read) than using IDE(s) like Visual Studio on Windows?\nDo the features an IDE provides exist there (eg. showing compilation errors) or is it a manual process? \n\nA: I'd like to provide my more general thoughts to the question: \n\"Why is Linux a better environment for programming?\"\nI think the most important reason why to develop on Linux is because you have full insight into most software internals. You are able to learn how things actually work if you are interested. That allows you to learn and adapt good or bad practices by seeing them in action. This allows more diversity for your ideas.\n\nA: This sort of hypothetical might do better on Programmers.SE because it's likely to be pretty one-sided here. That said, I was a .NET developer for a few years and came to depend on Visual Studio. It does a lot for you and yes, I particularly like the integrated debugger...  However, I think there are a few reasons people choose Linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu is free. Windows and VS can be extremely expensive.\n\n*Ubuntu is free. Windows and VS give you very little control over how you use them.\n\n*Ubuntu is a programming environment straight out of the box. Tools like Bash, grep, sed, awk. Windows is historically a big pain in the bottom to script from. Batch files are awful and even with PowerShell, the command-line experience in Windows pales into insignificance when compared to Bash and the GNU tools. You can port some of that over to Windows but it's not the same experience.\n\n*Complicated setups are easy to automate and replicate through apt-get, tools like Puppet, Chef, Juju, Fabric and simple scripting.\n\n*Some things don't need complicated IDEs. I'm a Python developer these days and I'm perfectly happy with its own built-in tools and debugger. I use a text editor, the command line and fabric... And I'm way more in control than I was under .NET. I can build, test, commit and deploy my webapps with a single Fabric command.\nThat's not to say there aren't monolithic IDEs. Eclipse and Netbeans. MonoDevelop. KDevelop4 and QT Creator. They all have their users who swear by them.\nIs Ubuntu better for you? Who knows. It's a very capable and very customisable system. If you give it a chance and alter your workflow to allow it to help you, you should be able to make it stick.\n\nA: Why Linux is better for programming\nIDEs\nBesides Visual Studio and Xcode, which serve their specific purposes, most popular IDEs are multiplatform. It might seem like there are gazillion IDEs for dozens of languages, but in the end most of them are based on either Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA or NetBeans. What they have in common is that they are all Java-based. Java works more efficiently on Linux, than on any other OS on the same hardware. In fact, Java is as much as 20% faster on Linux, than on OS X on same hardware. Many of these IDEs are ready to install with one click in Ubuntu Software Center.\nCompiler\nGCC has very much become industry standard. Beyond any doubt its primary platform is Linux, where it's best supported. And it's free and royalty-free.\nAdditional tools\nLinux provides unique tools, not available on other platforms, like for example Valgrind (a tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling). Linux also comes with debugging tools such as strace and ltrace, which can be used to debug even production code (i.e. not compiled with debugging symbols). Equivalent tools for Windows are either non-existent or very expensive and do not provide the same functionality.\nEase of installing OSS\nUbuntu has an excellent package manager. In most cases installing software is just apt-get install package-name (you can do it with GUI too, either Ubuntu Software Center or Synaptic). Once installed, they get automatically updated by the system with bugfix releases. The package system also automatically keeps track of dependencies, so you don't have to worry about other packages needed; they will be installed automatically.\nOn the other hand, in Windows you have to manually download and install packages, and if they require some other packages, you have to do that manually too. There is no system wide updating either, each software package either implements its own annoying updater or does not update at all.\nProduction machines are very likely to be Linux\nIf you doing any kind of programming for back-end, for web, for cloud, etc. it's very likely that your target machines are Linux. There are lot less nasty surprises when you're developing on same kind of OS as your target machine.\nOf course, you might be developing a desktop application for Windows, but nowadays this is kind of a niche job market for programmers.\n\nA: \nWhy is writing a program in text files or via the terminal a better option (as I read) than using IDE(s) like Visual Studio on Windows?\n\nIt's not, I can argue that it's quite the opposite. Generally though, people tend to prefer tools which they're better at. The type of tools you use might benefit the ease of writing programs. So for example, I can write Java programs just fine with vim but it's really counter productive as opposed to a full fledged IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ. Jon Skeet gave a great answer to the question Why use an IDE. \nBack to your original question, the only thing Linux is better at is C programming. Everything else you can do on Linux you can also do on Windows and vice-versa (programming wise). C programming is better on Linux for historical reasons, it offers a great set of tools (which you can get on Windows BTW but it's much easier to set up Linux for it). Likewise, if you're writing C# and like .NET then Windows is a better choice for obvious reasons. Everything else is completely subjective and you'll hear pros and cons of both sides. \n\nA: What tools (text editor or IDE) you use for programming is a matter of choice. Generally speaking you can say: Beginners and very small projects tend to use better text editors, like sublime text or a modified version of gedit. Just because you learn more when using plain text editors. IDEs can screw up your learning process by automating things (like Visual Studio does ;) ).\nWhen it comes to professionals, messing with lots of tools and languages, IDEs come in handy, because they can do so much more for you, if you let them. There are many IDEs to choose from, depending on the language you want to program in. There are better ones and also less convenient ones.\nMy personal experience is, that an Ubuntu OS is by far faster and easier to setup for development than Windows. I presume, this is because most of the tools and programs I use are build on Linux and because I do not have to search the internet for download links to my favorite programs. It is just an 'apt-get install program1 program2 program3' away. In comparison: I need 3 working days to install and configure a fresh Windows install with everything I need for programming (company, not private, that would be faster), but it is just one day for the same task in Ubuntu.\nMy experience is, that programmers, who switch to Linux for programming have (most of the time) a deeper understanding of technical contexts and how basics work. Mac and Windows users tend not to know why something works this way or why it does not. I am not sure if you can actually learn something from working with Linux or if just that those williong to learn switch to Linux.\nHope my \"blafasel\" helps a bit...\n\nA: I would like to add one more important reason though; Ubuntu is great for experimenting with new libraries, languages, IDEs and compilers. Everything is one apt-get away.\nSo you've heard about a fancy language called Haskell:\nsudo apt-get install ghc\nnano hello.hs\n<copy-paste hello world example>\nghc -o hello hello.hs\n./hello\nHello World!\n\nOh, you've heard a fancy editor for Haskell:\nsudo apt-get install <fancy-editor-for-haskell>\n\nThe same with C/C++ libraries, you just apt-get install them and the binaries and the headers go to the right folders, and you can just #include them in your source files without even needing to check where they get placed!\nIn essence, it's not about how fast you can setup your day-to-day working environment. It's also about how extremely fast you can setup an experimental environment. I believe that's what accelerates the learning experience under Linux.\n\nA: Here's an opinion from a primarily Microsoft platform developer. If you're not targeting the .NET ecosystem I would argue that your best option is Ubuntu. You will have a much easier time obtaining, configuring, and using tools for almost every other platform/language if you are on Ubuntu instead of Windows.\nThe value of Microsoft's toolchain is that it is HIGHLY integrated. From the IDE to Source Control, Project Management, Build, Deployment, Database, Cloud Infrastructure, ad nauseum. Microsoft makes it VERY easy if you're going full-bore with their platform.\nAs some have mentioned, deviating from the Microsoft Way can be a pain. Using .NET for your code and Oracle for your database...d'oh that's gonna be a pain.\nWant to create an .NET web application and deploy it to Amazon Web Services...not very straight forward.\nBut if you stay within the Microsoft Ecosystem...that baby will sing like a mocking bird for you. In the hands of a competent software developer, the Microsoft Platform is like PEDs for a talented athlete. It's not going to enable an amateur programmer to create the next Facebook. But it will give an edge to a talented developer who understands how the pieces fit together.\nThe argument for the free (as in beer) cost of getting started with Ubuntu is out the door, there are a number of programs Microsoft offers that let you get started with their tools for free. Including Bizspark which gives your startup company 3 years of licenses (including production use licenses of their tools). And Dream spark which gives it to students for free.\nThat being said, if you want to explore and learn new languages and platforms, you'll find better tools to get started on Ubuntu and if you're looking for work outside of the Microsoft ecosystem, you're going to need to be familiar with Ubuntu.\n\nA: I use both tools, IDEs and text-editors with Command-Line Interface (bellow referred to as CLI), to write programs.\nWhat Linux offers is a useful CLI starting from the default installation. If you don't need that and you are just using an IDE anyway, then there isn't much of a difference anymore (IMHO).\nIDEs\n\n\n*\n\n*IDEs are very good when it comes to integrating many features and present them in a graphical GUI.\n\n*The downside is, it can overwhelm someone new to this. Now you will have two things to learn: the IDE and the programming language.\n\n\nText editors and CLI tools\n\n\n*\n\n*Text editors and CLI tools don't take long to learn.\n\n*If something doesn't work, it is easy to see which tool doesn't work as expected.\n\n*It easier too look up problems with Google as everything is text-based.\n\n*Programming with text editors and CLI tools is faster and more responsive, especially comparing them on older hardware.\n\n*You can work with them even on low resolution screens.\n\n*It allows you to program and debug with minimal resources on a remote server.\n\n\nI often do my prototyping with text-based tools. Later, when there are more files to manage, I value the refactoring tools an IDE is offering me.\n\nA: I'll throw my answer into the ring (though I believe these all are good ones too).\nThe most basic answer you can get is that it's all about philosophy.\n\nIn the Microsoft world, it's a bit religious - You have the gods on Mt. Redmond who must be petitioned if you want anything implemented. Sometimes they will listen, other times your sacrifices and pleas will fall on deaf ears. Perhaps they were out hunting. Microsoft controls the entire ecosystem - they own the OS, they own the IDE, and they couple them together in ways that are probably inappropriate to talk about on a SE network. Even within the IDE pieces are tightly coupled - it may be called integrated but I think coupled is more accurate. If you would like to change things up a bit, Gates forbid that you would want to alter something in a way that either the designers of Windows or Visual Studio did not expressly allow. And then throw in technologies like IE, and IIS, Microsoft servers, and MS SQL Server, and Office... and everything is a nice big   happy family. But if you should want to leave part of the family behind? shudder!\n\nOn the other hand, you have Linux, which inherits from the Unix philosophy that each piece should be responsible for its own small sphere of responsibility. It should do one thing, and do it well. And preferably, communication should happen by way of strings of text. As others have pointed out, sed, awk, grep, etc. are perfect examples of this. They do the one thing that they are designed to do, and they do it very well. If you need to do two things, then you combine the two tools. Which is very easy to do. \nBecause sed expects nothing besides the input coming in will be text, that means that anything that can produce text does not have to reinvent the wheel. They can simply use sed. And because sed produces text, anything that can read text can use the output from sed. Text is very universal (there are some exceptions to this), and it's very easy to combine these types of things together.\nNot only is it easy to combine them, but it's also very easy to split them apart - if I decide that I no longer need to edit a stream, but I want to filter the results, rather than passing my text to sed, I can pass it to grep instead.\nNow, this is the fundamental philosophy behind development in a Linux environment - so even if you go up from there, many tools provide similar sorts of interfaces. They allow you to decompose them into parts, or interface with them through the command line or ports or HTTP. \nAnd even if that were not the case, you also have open source software. Most (if not all) software on the Linux platform is open source. So if you don't like how it's written you are completely, totally, absolutely able to change the software yourself. This is incredibly empowering. Can't break apart that IDE the way you want to? Either make the changes and submit them back upstream, or fork the project. Not sure why something behaves the way it does? Use the source, Luke! Need to be able to automate something through the command line? Hack on the project and stick your changes in. Come across a bug, or a security issue? Hey guess what - you can fix that yourself, you don't have to wait for SP3.432vb89234.startdate1eQ to come out.\nYou can combine the tools that you want and you need. And if there's something that is in your way, you are 100% able to get that changed. Even if you don't have the capability, you could certainly pay someone to develop that change - or even suggest it to someone else who has the know-how. \nThe reason this is better for programming is because when you come across friction, you can eliminate it from your workflow. Because development is hard there are a lot of things that you have to think about to be a successful programmer, and the more you have to think about the harder it is to think about other things. \nEliminating friction is key.\nSo if the Microsoft ecostystemreligion is where you feel at home, and you enjoy the tools so much that it doesn't provide you with much/any friction... well, it's probably just fine then.\nBut if you don't fit the Microsoft Mold(tm), patent pending, then you will run into friction. Development will be a pain. Each time you wish you could do something, but can't, that will drain precious cognitive resources. And if that's the case, then a Linux development environment is probably for you.\n\nA: I would argue that a Linux distribution is an IDE.\nFor a start, Unix was designed from the outset to be a development environment.  It was written by programmers for programmers.  Most Unixes, and Linux, still ship with development tools in their default configuration.  And missing parts are only an apt-get (or the equivalent) away.  Windows, on the other hand, is a terrible development environment until you install an IDE, which is not cheap, or a trivial process.\nAn IDE is more integrated, in the sense that IDEs are more tightly coupled than using GCC, Git and Vi (for example).  Tight coupling allows things like `intellisense' to work better.  But on the other hand, loose coupling has many advantages (e.g. flexibility, interchangeability, lack of lock-in).  \nAnd advances in compiler design (compilers with easily separable front-ends such as LLVM) might eventually mean better support for features such as syntax error highlighting even in loosely coupled environments.\n\nA: On the matter of philosophy:  Ubuntu/Linux permits the computer programmer direct access to the internals and hardware, whereas Windows is a sort of gatekeeper.  This is an important philosophical issue when it comes to programming.  So, philosophically speaking, this feature being an advantage will depend upon whether the user is sufficiently knowledgeable or technically aware of the importance of it. \nOn the matter of programming: The entire system architecture of Ubuntu/Linux is founded upon the Unix tradition of small, simple programs doing one thing, and then piping them together to do more complex things.  For a programmer this architecture is incredibly powerful, and, in my view, is the reason why Unix will prevail in the long run against every other software architecture on every platform.  One of the few places where Unix is not currently dominant is the desktop, but that will change over time.  Distributions like Ubuntu are helping to see this evolution through.  \nI don't dispute, however, that there are some very good programming environments on Windows.  For programming within a corporate environment, these often dominate. \n\nA: Speed is the sort answer.\nI find that with an graphical IDE like Visual Studio or QtCreator that I use the mouse too much when I should be using short cuts. Each time you switch context you are having to pause your brain, focus on your target and wait for the action. Whereas pressing F5 is infinitely quicker.\nNow if you are using vim, Emacs or something else that doesn't have nice looking buttons you'll be focused on the key presses, you have one method and become faster because its routine.\nThe errors are presented in a more verbose way with a command line interface, which I prefer, and it also gives feedback during compilation. One thing I hate about Visual Studio is the default is a little icon indicating its doing a compile, then you get an error list out.\nWith a narrow view you'll keep to the 80 column width which helps readability, I've seen code that spans out to the 200 column width. With code fitting to 80 columns you can have 4/5 windows open at a time.\nWith a CLI editor you can code remotely, no need for a slow (compared to text) RDP session to your Visual Studio. You could code over a GSM link.\nVisual form development kind of sucks. One advantage you might put on a GUI IDE is that you can draw your screens and its quicker. However in my experience its fine for a prototype but often you get better results with doing it manually in code. The VS2012 Code Analyser this morning just warned me about 200+ problems with code that was auto-generated by Visual Studio?!?!?\n\nA: I think your real question might be, \"Are there any Visual Studio alternatives that will run on Ubuntu, since it won't?\"\nMonoDevelop.  \nIt's workable, but you'll hate it if you're used to VS and all the features.   \nThere is NO advantage to using a text editor.  Remember that nice thing called Intellisense?  Not happening (but MonoDevelop has something like it).  Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Middle-button scroll not working in Ubuntu 12.04 [Thinkpad X230] My track-point works, so does my track pad.

I don't understand how some packages are managed in Ubuntu. How are they moved from unstable to testing?\nThe Debian FAQ says:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Unstable has the most recent (latest) versions. But the packages in unstable are not well tested and might have bugs\n  \n*Stable contains old versions of packages. But this package is well tested\n  \n*Testing falls between these two extremes\n  \n\nAt the moment I'm running Raring 13.04 (unstable). Saucy 13.10 (testing) has more recent packages, which breaks this rule.  \nSolution\nUbuntu's version management is not the same as Debian's one: It's development which then becomes, gets merged into, stable. \nThe current state of Ubuntu is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Raring 13.04 is stable\n\n*Ubuntu Saucy 13.10 is development\nSo it's all normal to have more recent packages in Saucy. See answers for more details.\nMisunderstanding solved ;)\n\nExtension  \nWell, now I understood raring is stable and saucy development (now is shifted to \"saucy --> trusty\" as well), how can this situation be explained regarding the 'virtualbox' package:  \n\n  \n*\n  \n*raring (4.2.10-dfsg-0ubuntu2.1)\n  \n*saucy (4.2.16-dfsg-3)\n  \n*virtualbox (4.3.0-89960~Ubuntu~raring)\n  \n\nHere, raring provides newer than saucy, which fits Ubuntu's workflow.  \nBut VirtualBox provides newest to stable Ubuntu versions, instead of the development one. \nSince the Ubuntu development version is intended to be merged as a stable Ubuntu in the end, it doesn't make sense for VirtualBox to provide for stable and not for development.  \nAny input about that ?\n\nA: Ubuntu =/= Debian. The fact that Ubuntu is based on Debian, and the fact that Ubuntu takes packages from Debian's testing, imply no relationship between them, including package management and package compatibility.\nRaring and Saucy are different distributions, with different repositories, and different versions of the packages. \nFor example, Raring has Libreoffice 4.0, and will always have it until its End Of Life, while Saucy has 4.1, and will always have it.\n\nA: It is important to distinuish the difference between the Debian and Ubuntu package landing workflows here. I think you've conflated these and that this is the cause of your confusion.\nDebian has unstable and testing. Ubuntu does not.\nDebian's unstable is always called sid. Debian's testing is currently called jessie (which will be the name of the next stable release when it's ready).\nUbuntu's \"Raring\" 13.04 is the latest stable release of Ubuntu. Ubuntu's \"Saucy\" will be 13.10, is the development release and is expected to be released today (at which point it will replace Raring as the latest stable release).\nUbuntu does have a rough equivalent of Debian's unstable->testing flow. In Ubuntu, we call it proposed migration, documented here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration. In Ubuntu's case, we have a roughly analogous saucy-proposed->saucy flow, where \"saucy\" represents the name of the development release and thus changes every release.\n\nA: While Ubuntu follows much of Debian's package management guidelines, and indeed many Ubuntu packages come without modification from Debian, there is a different cycle. The packages in different Ubuntu versions do not map directly to particular Debian sections. One of the motivations for Ubuntu was a desire to have more frequently releases than Debian, which necessarily involves a different structure.\nThere is no stable, testing and unstable. There is always one development release, and several currently-supported short-term and long-term releases. Once a release is made, the package versions are generally not changed, and updated for bug and security fixes, not for new features. \nIn debian, there is a single unstable release (sid), which in theory can be continually updated forever (expect lots of things to break). In Ubuntu, a new development release is started immediately after the previous release. This is populated with a mixture of packages, mostly from Debian testing/unstable along with a number of Ubuntu specific ones. There is then a 6-month cycle during which bugs are fixed and integration between packages tested. The versions of packages to be included in the release are fixed some time before the release is made to give time for testing. Finally, the development version becomes the new release, and the cycle repeats.\nYou can read about the Ubuntu release process here.\n", "Q: Sending HEX with CuteCom I'm working a lot with CuteCom at the moment.

You want to drop there packets addressed to the mentioned IP, not the ones coming from it (which is pointless in this chain).\nThat's why you have to change -s (--source) to -d (--destination) in the rule:\n# iptables -A OUTPUT -d 172.21.7.188 -j DROP\n\nBut even when you were dropping only incoming packets, it was kind of enough, one could say. It's true that ping was returning (ICMP echo reply was reaching your host) without above line, and consulting tcpdump or wireshark would show ping-related datagrams (i.e. outgoing and incoming), but the ping application wasn't receiving incoming datagrams, because they were dropped.\nObviously it's rather unwise to drop only incoming packets in most of the cases, because it leads to different state on both ends of the connection (at connection level or at application level).\n\nAnswer to edited question\nIf after correction it still doesn't work, then I suspect your firewall has already some rules that make your new rules unreachable. The way you added your rules makes them appended at the end of the chain. You should remove your new rules first (same commands as for appending, but change -A to -D).\nNow add your rules to the beginning of chains (i.e. insert them at given rule number 1) they are suited for (same commands as for appending, change -A to -I):\n# iptables -I INPUT  -s 172.21.7.188 -j DROP\n# iptables -I OUTPUT -d 172.21.7.188 -j DROP\n\nNow it should work.\n", "Q: How to install separate+ gimp-plugin for cmyk support?

Instead, I did this:\ncd /usr/local/bin\nsudo ln -s \"PATH/pypy3-2.1-beta1-src/pypy/goal/pypy3\" .\n\nThis creates a symbolic link (shortcut) to the location of the pypy3 file. Now, when you type pypy3 in the terminal, it'll launch. It's not a neat solution, but seeing as PyPy3 is in beta anyway, that'll have to do.

I have created a .py file and saved it in my \"Python\" folder located on my desktop.\nNow, I want to execute that particular file named \"use.py\".\nHow can I execute the file using LXTerminal?\n\nA: You've got several options here (choose the one you like best):\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the file itself executable.\n\n\n*\n\n*On the first line of the file, make sure the \"shebang\" is there:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nThis is needed for the shell so that it knows how to run the file.\n\n*Mark the file executable on the filesystem:\nchmod +x thefile.py\n\n\n*Run it like any other executable:\n./thefile.py\n\nor\n/full/path/to/thefile.py\n\n\n\n*Run the file directly in the Python interpreter:\npython thefile.py\n\nThe disadvantage of this is that everyone who would like to run the file should know how to call it.

Earlier today, after restarting due to some input issues, I started getting the message upon selecting Ubuntu from GRUB, \"errors were found while checking the disk drive for /\". I opted to ignore it, and Ubuntu loaded as normal. Upon checking the Disk Utility tool, I see the SMART status \"Disk has a few bad sectors\". When checking the specific information, I am given a warning for \"Current Pending Sector Count\". What does this mean? Should I allow an automated attempt to fix the issue? I've had further trouble caused by allowing automated fixes to run before because of conflicts with Windows 8 and UEFI, but I have no idea if there is any association between that and this issue. I can't imagine this is due to physical hard drive damage, as it is very new hardware. Thanks to anyone who can explain it. \n\nA: There are several duplicates of this question, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*What to do if Disk Utility shows bad sectors pending in SMART?\n\n*I dropped my laptop. SMART says there are bad sectors. Can I fix this?\n\n*I have 4029 bad sectors. Should I worry?\n\n*SMART Disk Failure 05 - Reallocated Sector Count: Creating a Partition Ubuntu 12.04\nUnfortunately, the answers vary. My own opinion is that, once bad sectors start showing up in a SMART test, the disk has become unreliable. I therefore recommend replacing it ASAP.\n\nA: Sometimes sudden power failure can result in one sector being reported as bad because it didn't get completely written.  You can run sudo smartctl -t long /dev/sda to ask the drive to test itself.  Check the status every once in a while with sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda and when it finds a bad sector, note the sector number, then do:\nsudo dd iflag=direct if=/dev/sda count=1 skip=sector of=/dev/null\n\nThat should report an IO error, if not then something is wrong and you should not proceed.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero count=1 oflag=direct of=/dev/sda seek=sector\n\nThis will try to re-write that sector full of zeros.  This should succeed and the SMART pending_sector count should drop by one.  If the sector was physically damaged, then the reallocated_count will go up by one.  Repeat the process until you have no more pending sectors and if you have no reallocated sectors either, then it was just sudden power loss, and the drive is fine.  If you do have reallocated sectors, then then drive may be on its way out and you should replace it.\n\nA: Following psusi recommendation, I succeeded clearing my \"bad sector\".\nFor more details for beginners:\n sudo smartctl -t long /dev/sda\n sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda \n\nI obtained:\n 196 Reallocated_Event_Count 0x0032   200   200   000    Old_age   Always       -     0\n 197 Current_Pending_Sector  0x0032   200   200   000    Old_age   Always       -       1\n\n (...)\n\n # 1  Extended offline    Completed: read failure       90%     47004         2730908512\n\n sudo dd iflag=direct if=/dev/sda count=1 skip=2730908512 of=/dev/null\n\nGave me an error, but:\n sudo dd if=/dev/zero count=1 oflag=direct of=/dev/sda seek=2730908512\n\nSucceeded and\n sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda \n\nGave me no more errors:\n 196 Reallocated_Event_Count 0x0032   200   200   000    Old_age   Always       -     0\n 197 Current_Pending_Sector  0x0032   200   200   000    Old_age   Always       -       0\n\nSo, thank you very much psusi for your reply, years later it's still useful :-)\nKind regards,\nTxvs\n", "Q: How to reclaim unused windows partition I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a machine that previously have windows.

Moreover, you can have more than one version of  OpenOffice and more than one version of LibreOffice without any conflict.\nLibreOffice can be found in the Ubuntu Software Center. If you want the latest version, you can find it at http://www.libreoffice.org/download/.\nTo install OpenOffice (now known as Apache OpenOffice), open the terminal and run these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:upubuntu-com/office\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install openoffice\n\nSource: How To Install Apache OpenOffice 3.4 Via PPA On Ubuntu\n\nA: Actually it cannot be done by simply install via apt or by running dpkg with the program install files.\nWhen installing, both programs write the soffice core program link in /usr/bin/. This conflict prevents both programs from installation in Ubuntu. You will get an error trying to overwrite /usr/bin/soffice.\n\nA: I know this is old, but, I looked for this answer and figured it out on Ubuntu 18.04\n\n\n*\n\n*If Libreoffice is already installed, uninstall it from terminal:\n\n\nsudo apt remove --purge libreoffice*\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the DEB files for both Libreoffice and Open office\nhttp://www.openoffice.org/download/index.html\n\n*Expand the openoffice debs files (in gnome, just double click them and drag them to the desktp for instance), navigate to the DEBS folder and enter the following from terminal:\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\n*Navigate to the desktop integration folder and issue the same command as you did in #3\n\n*Now, do the same with libre office\nhttps://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/\nIt seems that Libre Office adds a link to the system which does not let you install Open Office.

It only happens for an hours or so then it works again. Is it still caching from when I changed the DNS? Could there be some sort of max connection problem in Ubuntu or Apache?\n\nA: If it's something like \"max connections\" you should check the error logs from your apache server during that time: /var/log/apache2/error.log or where ever you configured your error logs.\nTo check the dns-problem, you can go to several dns lookup services, just type \"online dns lookup\" in Google and check if the results are correct.

I thought it's better to learn the newest version of Python. Using apt-get tells me that all of the above are the most recent versions. The reasons are explained here:\nChanging Python default in 12.04 LTS\nSo I apt-get python3 and ipython3, but how to have the latest Pylab set for my Python3 interpreter?\n\nA: Ubuntu/Debian treats python and python3, and their associated libraries as different packages (rather than one being an upgraded version of the other), since there are fairly few libraries which have a common codebase executable in both python 2 and 3.\nThus, you want python3-numpy, python3-scipy, python3-matplotlib, etc. Unfortunately, python3-matplotlib is not available in 12.04 (it is available from 13.04). You might be able to find a PPA containing it, but I personally don't know one to recommend.\n(Other libraries you might want to consider for a scientific python setup might include sympy, pandas, and the various scikit packages).\nEdit: Learning python 3 rather than 2 is a sensible goal, but if you're restricted to 12.04 you're likely to find support lacking in a number of libraries. That being the case, the best course is probably to use python 2 while ensuring you write forward-compatible code - see the official porting guide for suggestions.\n", "Q: How can I set view preferences to sorted by reverse date modified?

Nautilus's preferences allow you to set sort by date modified (oldest first), but not reverse date modified (newest first).\nDoes anyone have suggestions on setting sorted by reverse date modified as default?\n\nA: There's an additional parameter default-sort-in-reverse-order that doesn't appear to be accessible from the in-application preferences menu, but can be set in the dconf database - I think this will do you want.\nThere is a GUI dconf-editor that allows you to modify such hidden settings - it's not installed by default but available by installing the dconf-tools package. Alternatively you can set it from the command line using gsettings\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences default-sort-in-reverse-order true\n\nIf the dconf-tools package is installed, there is an equivalent dconf command line\n$ dconf write /org/gnome/nautilus/preferences/default-sort-in-reverse-order\n\n\nYou can revert the change any time with\n$ gsettings reset org.gnome.nautilus.preferences default-sort-in-reverse-order\n\nor\n$ dconf reset /org/gnome/nautilus/preferences/default-sort-in-reverse-order\n\nNote that it applies to whatever the default sort order is, so for example if you change back to sort-by-name that will be reversed as well - there doesn't seem to be a way to specify the sort direction individually. \n", "Q: Remove Duplicate Windows Entry In Grub2 Hi there im quite new to Linux\nI have problem with my grub\nWindows entry show twice in the grub and probably in wrong partition\n\nAs you can see there is 2 entry for Windows 7\nI can only boot to windows using loader on /dev/sda2\nI think loader for windows should be on /dev/sda1, but the loader on it render black screen to me\nI think i did something wrong with my windows and endup with this grub..\nIs there a way to fix this?

I have a dual boot Windows 7 / Ubuntu 12.04 desktop and I have installed openSSH server in both (using cygwin64 under windows). I connected from my laptop, running Ubuntu 12.04, to the Cygwin64 openSSH server, and an entry to ~/.ssh/known_hosts was normally added. Now, I am trying to connect to Ubuntu openSSH server (same IP, domain name) and I get the error: \nWARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! \n\nThis is of course because the 2 servers running on different OSes on the same machine have created different public keys and corresponding fingerprints. Is there any way to synchronize them (i.e. copy all the public key info from one to the other)?\n\nA: This isn't the best way to get around the problem. If you configure the Ubuntu side to use a different IP address than you use in Windows you shouldn't have this problem.\nIf you can't do that, a more straight forward solution is to disable host key checking for that host on your laptop.  \nNote, doing this will prevent ssh from warning you about a man-in-the-middle attack where someone is impersonating your dual boot system on your network, but that probably has a very low chance of happening.\nTo disable host key checking, add the following to the top of ~/.ssh/config or /etc/ssh/ssh_config:\nHost <HOSTNAME OR IP ADDRESS>\nStrictHostKeyChecking no\nUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\n\nThe 'StrictHostKeyCheck no' option will prevent your laptop from checking the remote host identification, and the 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null' option will cause ssh to save the remote host's identification to /dev/null, meaning it won't be saved.\n\nA: The default host key file is /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key for protocol version 1, and /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key and/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key for protocol version 2.  Try copying these files from your Ubuntu system to your Cygwin system (or vice versa). \nAnother option is to use the HostKey configuration option in sshd_config to point to an alternative host key file that is the same on both systems. \n", "Q: How can I print four copies of single image on a sheet of paper, one in each corner? I have an image in tif format and I want to print 4 copies of the image on the same piece of paper. Is there a way to do this in Ubuntu 12?\n\nA: Here's an example for making a comp with ImageMagick.\nconvert xc:white -page A4 \\\n    -page +0+0 image.tiff \\\n    -page +250+0 image.tiff \\\n    -page +0+250 image.tiff \\\n    -page +250+250 image.tiff \\\n    -flatten output.pdf\n\nI don't know what the exact coordinates will be, but try this and play around with it.\nThe quick alternative would just be using something like Inkscape or GIMP to create a composition manually.\n", "Q: How to check why my static IP isn't working? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop edition.  I'm not overly familiar with the unix side, but I'm learning. \nFrom a fresh install, I basically only installed XAMPP.  My webserver now works fine (although with dynamic IP).\nI'm at a university, so the IT office gave me a static IP and all the accompanying info to set it up.\nMy subdomain with the university works (although, IP dynamic)\nIn an attempt to apply static IP, I then modified my /etc/network/interfaces file to the effect of:\nauto lo eth0\niface lo inet loopback\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.101\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n\nThis killed my network connection: I can't even ping the computer (or ping any other systems from the computer).  It seems pretty straightforward, but something obviously went wrong.  I'm not sure where to even begin debugging?\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu Desktop, then it is running its own network manager (conveniently called NetworkManager) and will override the /etc/network/interfaces file. You either need to setup static ip's through NetworkManager, or disable it.\n\nA: If you are going to use static ip address, make sure removing dhcp client\nsudo apt-get remove dhcp-client\n\nAnd then use only \nauto lo eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.101\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    network 192.168.1.0\n    broadcast 192.168.1.255\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n\nSpecify your name server(DNS servers) under /etc/resolv.conf\nsudo vi /etc/resolv.conf\n\nand put e.g \nname server 8.8.8.8\n\nAfter doing all this, make sure restarting your network by:\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\n", "Q: Where can I download Ubuntu Touch 1.0?

Is there a way I can upgrade this to the latest version (13)?\nthank you.\n\nA: No.  You can only upgrade from a release to the next release, or from a LTS release to another LTS release.  Since your installation is so old, it would probably behoove you to just reinstall from scratch, rather than perform the time-consuming upgrades one at a time.

If I switch to ubuntu from windows will my programs from windows still work on ubuntu? or will I have to download the ubuntu counterpart of the program?\n\nA: It's aways better to use a native program.\nBut if you desire, you could try running your windows programs using Wine (See winehq.org) or through a virtual machine. The later has a mode which you can run your machines \"like they were native\". As in, without the virtual machine explicitly being displayed\n\nA: In general its usually best to try and find an Ubuntu or at least Linux equivalent of any program you want rather than  try to run Windows applications.\nIn many cases you will find suitable software for free in the software centre.\nFor those cases where this is not possible there is a compatibility layer called Wine which can be used to run some Windows programs but its less than perfect many programs run very well others are next to useless.  There is a database to indicate how well many popular programs run.  You can install Wine from the software centre.\nFor Windows programs that don't run well under wine you also have the option of installing Windows inside a virtual machine such as Virtualbox also available from the software centre but this requires a Windows licence and install media.\nFinally if you really need a Windows machine you can dual boot Windows and Ubuntu switching between the two of them as necessary.\n", "Q: How to access the Keyboard Layout Options in 13.10+ In 13.04 or below I only needed to access the keyboard layout and then click on the Options button as seen in the image below:\n\nIn 13.10 the Options button is missing as seen in the following image:\n\nSo what is the new method to access any and all Keyboard Layout Options.

I didn't encounter this problem on my laptop in the past before. Did I somehow screw up on my part?\n\n\nA: If you check your hard drive with Gparted, you will notice that it will have a Yellow warning mark in any of your NTFS partitions. The way to fix it is shutting down totally Windows (no hibernation, no suspend, but correct shutdown of the system). If that doesn't get rid of the warning, you should run chkdsk /f in cmd (just type cmd in the start menu) with Administrative Privileges and restart Windows twice.\nIn case of Windows 8, apart of the actions above, you should disable Fast Boot and shutdown the system.\n\nA: You can try remounting your Windows drive in gparted. Although this sounds strange but sometimes it works. \n1. Open gparted and close that installation window.\n\n2. In gparted, unmount every hard disk you see (/dev/sda1, for an example)\n3.

As an example, I have debug.conf that looks like:\n\nstart on stopped networking and stopped screen-cleanup\ntask\nscript\n    date\nend script\n\nI have added a date call at the end of screen-cleanup.conf's script, and at the beginning of networking's post-stopped script as well. The time stamps should allow me to see roughly what order things were run in.\nI have rebooted several times now and the behaviour seems to be variable. Initially I found that the above \"debug\" job would run after \"networking\" but before \"screen-cleanup\" had finished (based on the date outputs). Since then I have tried various tests and found that similar conditions, but dependent on signals I was sending via initctl emit (to save me from having to reboot) rather than \"stopped\", work as expected.\nTo explore the behaviour at boot more I have created and removed various test jobs and now I find that the \"debug\" job does not run at all. I copied the conf file to another name and changed the \"and\" to an \"or\" and verified that that job does fire twice on boot.\nI have looked at the cookbook but I can't see what I'm doing wrong. screen-cleanup is a task as well, if that makes a difference (its the file that came with the screen package apart from my additional call to date).\nI'm running 13.10 though I'm hoping for something that works back to 12.04 LTS at worst.\nEDIT: and after more reboots I'm back to the job triggering on the first thing to stop (networking), rather than the last (screen-cleanup). I can only assume there is an extra factor I'm not noticing.\n\nA: The behaviour of stopped networking has changed between Ubuntu 12 and 13 because the networking job is no longer a task. That causes the stopped networking condition to fire, effectively, on system shutdown.\nThe times when the job seems to have fired early are presumably times when it has actually fired just before the reboot.\nThere is a bug report about the cookbook suggesting \"stopped networking\" without mentioning it's changed behaviour between releases. I have moved to static-network-up which appears to fire after ifup -a has been run so is probably much the same. The cookbook suggests this won't work on anything older than Ubuntu 11 however. \n", "Q: Nvidia Optimus on 13.10 Use initial Support or Bumblebee?

This is, because my native language has some non ASCII characters, and apparently the localization was not quite correct earlier.\nSimplest way to find the culprits is to run:\ncd /etc/apt/sources.list.d\nfile *.list\n\nThen open in editor each of the files that is not listed as \"ASCII text\" and remove any characters that seem like garbage.\n\nA: Check out sources.list.d for any dotfiles (files starting with a period) containing binary garbage (which the python unicode decoder blows chunks on). I had this same problem and when I removed the dotfiles out of /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ it worked again.\n", "Q: `Kernel panic - not synicing: No init found` while installing any version of Ubuntu I tried to install Ubuntu 13.10 however I've got a problem:\nThe live environment works fine, and the installation too.

Should I hit the reset button and format my hard drive? All of my files are backed up to Ubuntu one.\n\nA: Don't push the reset button, I had the same problem. Ubuntu 13.10 could not upgrade my apps and that is why it froze. Wait for about another half an hour depending on how many apps you have and it should give you an error message and tell you the installation was finished.

I've googled around a lot and also asked AOC customer service and accoring to them, there are no drivers for me to download. I asked around a bit and the general feedback I've been given is that Linux has display drivers inherently. One person said that I should find out what chipset my monitor uses and try downloading the driver for that specific chipset. If that's the best way to do it, then would anyone be able to help me locate where I can download a DL 4000 chipset driver please. If this isn't the best approach, would anyone be able to direct me down the right path. \nIncase it's relevant: my laptop is an ASUS N56V and I'm currently dual booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.04\n\nA: As of this writing DisplayLink has not released data to the open source community for the DL-4000, and there is no support.

(How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)  by running Boot repair! \n\nA: The upgrade from 8 to 8.1 worked great for me. In addition, if I choose to set the Windows bootloader as the first (default) option, every time I boot or restart the computer there is now a new blue screen that looks like the screen you see with the \"Advanced Startup\" screen that first appeared in Windows with Windows 8. From this screen, there was an option to continue booting to Windows 8.1, Boot to Linux Mint 15, or boot with EFI USB. Surprisingly enough, when I selected the Linux option, I was greeted by the GRUB menu. Since I'm seeing this blue screen any time I boot or reboot to Windows, I just made the Windows bootloader the default option. That's a whole lot easier than it was before with Windows 8 and all the frustrations with the BCD, boot-repair, rEFInd, etc. Trivial bonus: you can use the mouse/cursor on that blue startup screen as well.\nHere's a quick picture I snapped of the sceen:\n\n\nA: I also just upgraded to Windows 8.1 from 8 and GRUB was just fine, didn't need to do anything other than be on alert so that I would choose the Windows option in GRUB the two times the PC rebooted during the whole process.

How do I sync (upload to/download from) my contacts, with my Ubuntu Touch OS?\n\nA: Ubuntu Touch has EDS (Evolution-data-server) installed. So you can sync it using syncevolution.\nFirst install latest stable version from repo:\nFor =>14.04\nsudo apt-get install syncevolution syncevolution-provider-uoa\n\nFor <=13.10\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://downloads.syncevolution.org/apt stable main\"\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install syncevolution-evolution\n\nIf you are using Google-Contacts, then export all contacts as vcf (i.e allcontacts.vcf) & then import it using following command at terminal (Change the path & database accordingly):\nsyncevolution --import /path/to/file/allcontacts.vcf backend=evolution-contacts database=Personal\n\nTo know the names of all available databases type:\nsyncevolution --print-databases\n\nFor more info visit:\n\n\n*\n\n*SyncEvolution - Community Help Wiki\n\n*SyncEvolution\n\nNOTE :\nIf vcard file (contacts.vcf) doesn't have new line space after END:VCARD, syncevolution might fail to import all the contacts. \n\nA: It is possible to sync your Official Aquaris Ubuntu Edition with e.g. Owncloud using CardDAV. This is what I did (see wiki.ubuntuusers.de for source):\n\n\n*\n\n*First I added the certificate of my site to the folder /usr/share/ca-certificates and updates the ca-cert database, since it is self-signed:\nsudo mount /dev/loop0 / -o remount,rw\nsudo cp /home/phablet/Downloads/server.crt /usr/share/ca-certificates\n\nAdd a star to the new certificate while running the configuration\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates\n\n\n*Add the syncevolution configuration:\nsyncevolution --keyring=no --configure --template webdav username=<USERNAME> password=<PASSWORD> syncurl=\"in-its.de/owncloud\" target-config@owncloud\nsyncevolution --configure --template SyncEvolution_Client sync=none syncURL=local://@owncloud username= password= peerIsClient=1 owncloud\nsyncevolution --configure database=https://<SERVER>/owncloud/remote.php/carddav/addressbooks/<USERNAME>/contacts backend=carddav target-config@owncloud contacts\nsyncevolution --configure sync=two-way backend=contacts database=\"Persönlich\" owncloud contacts\n\n\n*Run sync:\nsyncevolution --sync slow owncloud contacts\n\nThat made all my Owncloud contacts available on my Ubuntu Phone.\nAnd CalDAV works similar:\nsyncevolution --configure database=https://<SERVER>/owncloud/remote.php/caldav/calendars/<USERNAME>/personal backend=caldav target-config@owncloud calendar\nsyncevolution --configure sync=two-way backend=events database=\"Persönlich\" owncloud calendar\n\nAnd then sync it:\nsyncevolution --sync slow owncloud calendar\n\nSo CalDAV and CardDAV are working!\n\nA: Here is a simpler and more up-to-date answer for Ubuntu Touch 14.09/14.10.\nEven if it is easier that it used to be (no need to be root, no need to use the developer mode...) an app that automates this would be appreciated.\nImport\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy your contacts (as one or multiple .vcf, other formats might work too) to your device.

Then install Dekko on the Ubuntu Touch device, receive the email and open the attachment - it will then be automatically imported. No terminal required, and it only takes seconds once Dekko is installed. \n\nA: Another manual approach for backup/restore of contacs, calendar, ... is\n\n\n*\n\n*start data manager on the phone\n\n*get permission for all files (input PIN,...)\n\n*make all files visible (settings show hidden files)\n\n*copy the whole folder home/phablet/.local/share/evolution to \"documents\"\n\n*connect the phone to another computer/laptop via usb\n\n*unlock home screen on the phone to allow access to the phone via usb\n\n*copy the evolution folder to your harddrive\n\n\nFor restoring just do it the other way around.\nThe folder evolution contains all contacts, notes, calendar-events. So you may as well only backup/restore individual files.\n\nA: If you encounter some trouble to import a vcf file with a vcd format version 2.1, you can import it first in evolution software installed in a linux desktop, then export it with evolution : you'll have a vcf in 3.0 version, and import in you ubuntu phone will work properly.\n\nA: syncevolution --import /path/to/file/allcontacts.vcf backend=evolution-contacts database=system-address-book\n\n", "Q: Why am I not able to shutdown, log-off and restart after an upgrade to Ubuntu 13.10? After the update neither my desktop (Asus) nor my laptop (HP) respond to the shut-down, log off or restart commands in the right top tool bar.\nHow do I fix the issue?\n\nA: Had the same problem and found out that even \"shutdown\" command from terminal didn't help much either.\nI am using also Cairo dock and found out that if I try to restart or shutdown from Cairo, it does.\nSilly may seems but for me worked.\n\nA: Same problem after upgrading from 13.04 to 13.10 on an Asus desktop running Unity. The problem occurs only after SUSPEND/RESUME, either manual SUSPEND via the Shutdown menu (upper right corner of screen) or by the System Settings/Power suspend timeout after 30 minutes (current SUSPEND setting).\nStarting a terminal session and running 'sudo reboot' or 'sudo shutdown now' takes the O/S into single user mode (I believe). A Control-D continues the process a little further.

So I'd like to ask if any of you have som experencie with running ubuntu on this notebook. Getting touch screen work is not so important, I'm more interested in installation (is UEFI a problem?), if wifi, ethernet etc. work out of box and what is the battery life while running linux.\n\nA: I just bought one, and it runs great. Everything seemed to work, even booting off the flash drive.\nI'm pretty sure you can install it with UEFI, but for now I just went all legacy.\nJust turn off all the UEFI stuff in the BIOS setup, and anything that says 'security', and turn on anything that says legacy.\nThe downside of going the legacy route, is that the Win8 option in the grub loader won't boot Win8. You have to hit F-12 when booting and select Win8 that way.\nIf you use legacy mode, the dual-boot option comes up during install. It wouldn't come up if I booted up in UEFI mode. But I know it can be done, I just recently did it with another laptop, but already forgot all the details.\nIt's good to shrink the Windows 8 partition (inside Windows) to <100GB, so that GRUB can make a partition under 100gb, or else GRUB doesn't work.\nIdeally, I would've wanted to scrub the whole drive, and re-install Win8 and Ubuntu from scratch so I could have it exactly like I wanted it, but didn't want to spend the time or copying of the recovery partitions, etc.\nThe touchscreen works really well in Ubuntu.  \nThe only problem I had was the brightness control didn't work. This fixed it and posted here: How do I get brightness working on a Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga?\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_osi=\\\"!Windows 2012\\\"\"   \nsudo update-grub\n\nI'd suggest installing tlp for power saving. Battery life seems to be at about 3 - 3.5 hours from it's estimate. The only problem is that the auto-dimmer doesn't seem to work when unplugging power. I'm sure that's fixable.\nI think if I can spin down the drive more (have not heard it spin down yet), it would work well.\nI'll probably buy a second power adapter, so I can have one ready to plug in wall at home, and carry the other with me. Saw one for $25. I would definitely get a 6-cell battery for it, if Lenovo comes out with one.\n\nA: I cannot boot from USB on Ideapad S10 Touch :(\nWhat I have done:\n\n\n*\n\n*updated BIOS already to newest version (up to today - version 16).\n\n*set \"legacy\" support in BIOS boot options set \"legacy first\" in BIOS\n\n*boot options tried to boot my USB stick on other computer -\nsuccessfully\n\n\nProblem:\nWhenever there is USB stick present, laptop just remains stuck with initial \"lenovo\" pre-BIOS screen.

And it works.... till restart of any machine. Note that I do not have to setup anything on linux again to make windows->linux printing work.\nI am begging for advice.\n\nA: This is consequence of an very old bug in CUPS.\nSo to fix this, just edit the file /etc/init/smbd.conf:\nsudo gedit /etc/init/smbd.conf\n\nThen replace the line:\nstart on (local-filesystems and net-device-up)\n\nFor this:\nstart on (local-filesystems and started cups and net-device-up)\n\nI have successful in Ubuntu Saucy (13.10).\n", "Q: /etc/pm/power.d scripts not executing after update to 13.10 I recently updated to Ubuntu 13.10 and realized that scripts in /etc/pm/power.d do not fire anymore.

Is there any way to make it work.\nI have a script which automatically changes the brightness on my monitor if the power cable is plugged out and I would like to be able to use it again.\nUPDATE\nI realized that the main reason why the scripts aren't executing automatically is because the upowerd is not running. If i run upower --monitor, the scripts start to execute whenever I connect or disconnect the charger.\nThe man upowerd says the following:\n\nupowerd provides the org.freedesktop.UPower service on the system message bus. Users or administrators should never need to start this daemon as it will be automatically started by dbus-daemon(1) whenever an application calls into the org.freedesktop.UPower service.  \n\nWhy doesn't the upowerd start automatically on boot?\n\nA: I ended up adding the\nupower -e\n\nline to my /etc/rc.local file, which just enumerates the available power sources and starts upowerd if it's not already running.\n\nA: I was able to get it working by just installing pm-utils, afterwards the scripts ran properly:\nsudo apt-get install pm-utils\n\n", "Q: Are the flashing instructions on the Ubuntu website safe for Nexus 10?

And now I can't get Windows 7 to read it as well as Ubuntu 11.10.

The problem is, gcc has cleaned up header dependencies, so with a gcc version >=4.3 some code isn't compiling anymore. See http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/porting_to.html for what to include to avoid compile errors.

I then tried Ubuntu Server 13.04 and got the exact same problems as with Debian. After installing, the system doesn't show any boot-selection and tells me:\nMissing operating system\n\nMy setup is pretty simple:\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sdc - 1TB HDD (+ 3 other NTFS HDD)\n\n*/dev/sdc1 - EFI, 100MiB, bootable\n\n*/dev/sdc4 - ext4, 65GiB, Ubuntu/Debian\n(sdc2 & sdc3 are NTFS disks with data. Somewhat lacking SATA-ports, therefore no OS-only HDD/SSD)\n\nGRUB seems to be installed on /dev/sdc4, and /dev/sdc1 only contains a EFI folder; I'm not sure if that's appropriate/correct.\nI used UNetbootin on OS X to make an 8GB USB-drive bootable and used the standard AMD64-iso, running a Perl script which eradicates a couple of naming-errors (different story). Using this tutorial and actually disabling UEFI and using Legacy-only didn't work either -- the USB drive didn't even bother to boot.\nI have run out of ideas. I'd just like to install and use either Debian or Ubuntu Server!\n\nA: Knowing more about your setup may be helpful. In particular, you mention using OS X to prepare your boot medium, but you also don't mention any OS X partitions, so it's not clear if the computer is a Mac or some other type of computer. If it's a Mac, I recommend you post back with clarifications, including whether you've actually got an OS X installation on this system. If it's a UEFI-based PC, one of the following will probably get things up and running:\n\n\n*\n\n*If Secure Boot is enabled on your computer, disable it. Then download and prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R with my rEFInd boot manager. (Note that there are download links for images of both type.) Boot with it. This should get Linux booting. You can then install the Debian-package version of rEFInd, which should take over the boot manager duties on your computer.\n\n*Run the Boot Repair utility from an emergency disc booted in EFI mode. In many cases, this will get GRUB working again. In case it doesn't, be sure to record the URL that the program presents. You can then post it here, since it will hold additional details that may be of use in diagnosing your problem.\n\n\nIf you've got a Mac, rEFInd is likely to be the more useful tool, but you should install it from OS X, not from Linux. (That is, don't use the Debian package; use the .zip file from OS X.)\n", "Q: Convert from EFI to BIOS boot mode I have a Samsung Notebook NP900X4C with an LUKS encrypted installation on it. The system is booting in UEFI mode.\nThe problem is that the samsung-notebook kernel module is disabled in UEFI mode and due to that I am missing features like the keyboard backlight.\nIs it possible to modify the current installation so it can boot in BIOS mode?\nIs this correct that the basic steps would be converting the disk from GPT to MBR and installing grub from a live CD? Would this be possible with a LUKS partition?\n\nA: I figured out the exact way by myself. Rod Smith was right, it’s easier than I thought.\nHere the solution if anybody else needs it:\nOriginal Partition Layout:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1  (EFI Partition)\n\n*/dev/sda2  (Boot Partition)\n\n*/dev/sda3  (LVM2/LUKS encrypted Root & Swap)\n\n\nConverting to BIOS boot:\n\n\n*\n\n*I deleted the EFI Partition and created a new partition with the bios_grub flag instead of it.\n\n*Using this tutorial I mounted the encrypted file system, chrooted into it and installed GRUB.\n\n*Remove the EFI Partition from /etc/fstab.\n\n\nA: It's possible and it's easier than you think. Linux can boot fine from a GPT disk in BIOS mode, so there's no need to do the MBR-to-GPT conversion. With any luck, all you'll need to do is to install a BIOS-mode boot loader (GRUB, LILO, or SYSLINUX) to the disk. There are three caveats, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've never used LUKS, so I'm not sure how this would affect things. I wouldn't expect any problems, but that might be my lack of experience talking.\n\n*Some EFIs have quirky requirements for booting in BIOS mode. Most commonly, some will only boot in BIOS mode if they see a boot/active flag on an MBR partition, and this is normally absent on GPT disks. You can work around this by using an old version of fdisk (one that lacks GPT support, which was added only very recently) to set the boot/active flag or by using a new version of parted to set a flag (whose name I don't recall offhand) on the whole disk. If you're lucky you won't need to deal with this issue. See this page for more on this problem.\n\n*If the computer is dual-booting with Windows, converting it to boot in BIOS mode is likely to be much trickier. In this case, it might be easier to install rEFInd as a boot manager. rEFInd can then boot Windows in EFI mode and boot the BIOS-mode GRUB (or whatever you end up using). To do so, though, you'll need to edit refind.conf: Uncomment the scanfor line and ensure that hdbios is among the items that are scanned.\n\n\nA: Converting Ubuntu into BIOS mode\nNote: Use this procedure only to convert an UEFI mode Ubuntu installation to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Such a conversion may be necessary if some hardware doesn't work correctly under UEFI mode. (Graphics cards are a common source of problems.) Converting to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode while Windows boots in UEFI mode can make the boot process more awkward -- you'll need to use the computer's built-in boot manager to switch between OSs, and some computer's have such poor boot managers that this may be impossible.\n\n*\n\n*If Ubuntu is installed on a GPT disk (you can check it via the sudo parted -l command), use GParted partition editor to create a BIOS-Boot partition (1MB, unformatted filesystem, bios_grub flag) at the start of its disk.\n\n*Start Boot-Repair, and select Advanced options -> GRUB location tab.\n\n*Uncheck the Separate /boot/efi partition option\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Apply button in the lower right corner.\n\n*Set up your BIOS so that it boots the HDD in Legacy mode. Generally this setting is located in the Boot tab → Boot order section of the BIOS.\n\nSource: revised from: UEFI - Community Help Wiki\n\nA: I know this is old (sorry for necro) but I found no guide out there that actually work for my Ubuntu 16.04, and I struggled with @Lukas S's answer, as well as with the official Ubuntu UEFI to BIOS guide (@karel's answer). Posting it here rather than editing the Ubuntu wiki guide as this askubuntu question pops up earlier in all search engines.\nIn fact, I'm surprised either of those 3 guides can actually work for anyone as-is because UEFI systems do not (typically) have the grub-i386-pc files needed for grub-install to work, so they fail at that step. Boot-repair also fails when trying to repair (saying \"grub-pc cancelled\"). Probably the authors of these guides had those files somehow, maybe from previous struggles.\nMy setup was a typical EFI system, which is actually an old Ubuntu 16.04:\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1=fat32 (esp,efi) partition\n\n*/dev/sda2=Linux system\n\n*/dev/sda3=swap (unimportant, you don't have to have this)\n\n*the Linux system on sda2 lacks the /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc folder which has the modules needed for BIOS boot and grub-install\n\nMy disk is also GPT, and this is perfectly fine - no need to convert gpt to msdos.\nSteps that I had to do to successfully convert from UEFI to BIOS:\n\n*\n\n*delete the sda1 partition\n\n\n*recreate one which is unformatted but with the bios_grub flag. Note: Gparted is iffy, in that when I chose \"unformatted\" when creating it, it gave me a fat32 one (which grub-install doesn't like). I had to right-click \"format to\" and chose \"cleared\", then applied, then added the \"bios_grub\" flag.\n\n\n*boot in BIOS mode (important!) from a Ubuntu live CD. I used Xubuntu 20.04.3. It's important to boot in BIOS mode because that will give you the grub-i386-pc files you need later.\n\n\n*mkdir /mnt/sda2\n\n\n*mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2\n\n\n*for f in sys dev proc; do mount -o bind /$f /mnt/sda2/$f; done\n\n\n*rsync -a /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc /mnt/sda2/usr/lib/grub/ (important! no / after i386-pc)\n\n\n*chroot /mnt/sda2 /bin/bash\n\n\n*grub-install /dev/sda\nDone. Rebooted and the system now boots in BIOS mode from the hard drive.\nMy 16.04 now has newer grub-pc-i386 files in /usr/lib/grub, but it's not bothered. It's encouraging to know this procedure work cross distribution versions. I plan to upgrade to 20.04 anyway.\np.s.

You can install it by typing:\napt-get install gnome-session-fallback\n\nIf you have some idea, please give me a hint...\nThank you!\n\nA: gnome-session-fallback is a transitional package, which causes gnome-system-flashback to be installed.  It actually is installed, but the bash suggestion tool doesn't know about the change, so it keeps suggesting that you install it.\nAs to your actual problem, there are several related questions posted here on AU, but none of them have a real solution (as of 10/22/2013):\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 13.10 VNC server not working\n\n*Does gnome-fallback.desktop require accelerated graphics in 13.10?\n\nA: I needed the graphical interface, so I removed everything from Gnome and installed KDE. I added the line \nstartkde &\n\nin my .vnc/xtstartup file. Now the graphical interface with VNC works again. KDE starts with a crash, but it seems to run. I will try to find out where the crash happens.\n\nA: It looks like the script /usr/bin/gnome-session-fallback is missing from the package.\nOn 13.04 the script has the following two lines:\n#! /bin/sh\nexec gnome-session --session gnome-fallback \"$@\"\n\nYou may try to create this script yourself and see if that solves the problem.\n\nA: Alternatively you might install xfce4 desktop and enjoy a neat and full-featured evnironment through VNC, provided you add a line startxfce4 & in  .vnc/xstartup file. The line exec x11/xinit/xinitrc should be hashed instead. \nI experienced similar inconvenience and since gnome-session simply does not work I decided so switch to xfce4. No bugs, no hassle. Just fine.\n", "Q: Login loop after upgrade to 13.10 Ubuntu has upgraded to 13.10, but when I reboot I can't login, even when I try with the guest session.  I am brought back to the login screen.\nI press Ctrl+Alt+F1 and login. Then I remove the file ~/.Xautohrity and reboot. After that it can login from LightDM but a new error appears:\nCould not acquire name on session bus\n\nand when I reboot it can't login again.\nHow can I fix this? Note that I have another Desktop environment installed alongside Unity.\n\nA: I had a similar problem but fixed it by removing Cinnamon. If this is also the case for you, try the following: sudo apt-get remove --purge cinnamon* and then sudo apt-get autoremove\nIf you don't have cinnamon installed but any other desktop environment alongside Unity, try to uninstall those. (Gnome fallback should be fine though)\n\nA: I solved by opening the terminal (Alt+Ctrl+T) and enter: \nsudo /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults --show-manual-login true\n\nRestart the computer\n\nA: I had the same problem. I wasn't able to login to my user account then I logged in as guest and in terminal switched to my user account as I didn't know what is the password for guest account then typed this command and restart:\nsudo /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults --show-manual-login true\n\nIt will give you three options when you want to login again after a restart:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your user account \n\n*Manual login by typing the user name and password \n\n*Guest\n\n\nThe 'manual login' option worked for me.\n", "Q: Can I safely use suspend/hibernate during an upgrade? How will the upgrade progress react if I put the computer to sleep or hibernate it meanwhile upgrading? Right now it's downloading packages, if I close the lid, take the computer to work and start it up and connect it to another wireless network, will the process be cancelled?\nUpdate:\nSuspend and reconnect to a different network works fine during the package downloading process, but what about suspend meanwhile it installs packages or downloads the upgrade manager?\n\nA: As your edited question states, suspending does not usually cause a problem. You can minimize the already slim chances more by disconnecting from your internet connection so that the apt program can suspend the downloads gracefully.  There is always a chance that your computer may not suspend/hibernate correctly. If that happens, there is a chance that apt may lose track of the file it was downloading, likely the worst that that would cause would be having to restart that particular file again, so it's still only a small risk.\n\nTo answer your updated question, I would not suspend it while it is installing packages. Even on a good suspend and resume it might cause problems if you stopped it in the middle of updating important files, they might not install correctly.  If it crashed during the resume process, it would very likely cause partially installed packages, which can be recovered from, but it can be a headache that you can avoid by waiting a few minutes until the installation is complete.\nAs to the second part of your edit, I assume that by \"Upgrade Manager\" you are talking about upgrading your release, i.e. from 13.04 to 13.10.  Upgrading releases uses the apt program as well, it just downloads a lot more files before it installs them, so the answer is the same.  It is safe to suspend the download in the middle, but I would still disconnect the internet connection before shutting down/suspending. \nThe only difference is that it is more important to let the actual installation finish before shutting down, a partially installed distribution upgrade is much harder to recover from than a package upgrade; In a package upgrade you could just uninstall the package and reinstall it, but if you have 13.04 systems trying to boot with 13.10 files(for example) you could have a system that will not boot.  Again, you could still likely recover from that, but, it would be a lot more work.\nTo sum it up in one sentence, you should be safe suspending/shutting down during the file downloads, but I would not ever shut the computer down during the actual install of those files.  (Also I would not do it on battery power to avoid a low-power related shutdown)\n", "Q: How can I force the phone screen to stay on I flashed Ubuntu for phones on a device and would like the display to stay on while I take photographs or video of the device. How can I do that?\n\nA: Either, on the device in the terminal app issue the command:-\nstop powerd\n\nAlternatively from a computer connected to the device, with the android tools installed issue:-\nadb shell stop powerd\n\n\nA: There is another way, from:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Testing\n# Run this in another terminal window and leave it running to\n# make sure display stays on for the tests:\nadb shell powerd-cli display on bright\n\n", "Q: Is there wubi for Ubuntu 13.10 Is there a wubi installer for Ubuntu 13.10 x64? \n\nA: According to my research, Wubi support (officially) was discontinued from 13.04 and onwards.  Wubi is not available for 13.10 as a result.  Wubi is only available still with 12.04 LTS according to the Wubi documentation and windows installer pages.\nAn alternative would be to install VirtualBox inside of your Windows installation and then install Ubuntu to a VirtualBox Virtual Machine, which would run Ubuntu inside of a virtual machine, which in turn is inside Windows.  This however requires you to boot up to Windows first before using VirtualBox to access Ubuntu.\n\nA: Nope. Sorry. But nope. It's for 12.04 LTS only. And I would not reccommend installing ubuntu or any os/distro from wubi (if you could) because it often leads to problems like windows won't start. I would say use UNetBootin to put the ISO on a flash drive or use InfraRecorder to put it on a disc. A walkthrough on how to install ubuntu can be found here.\n\nA: There is a Wubi 13.10 here. It's been tried by others, and seems to work without a hitch, but please remember that it's officially unsupported.\n", "Q: Nexus 4 Ubuntu Dual Boot? Not sure if this is already answered.  I remember that the Ubuntu Edge claimed it could dual boot to normal android and ubuntu.  Is this still the case?  If i install on my Nexus 4 will i have a choice to boot into either Ubuntu or my already existing Android OS?\n\nA: How to Dual boot/Multi boot Ubuntu Touch/Ubuntu Phone on Nexus 4.\nYes, it is very much hardware specific because all the different phones on the market use very different System-On-Chip(SOC)'s in them.  The Nexus 4 is definitely the best one for running Ubuntu Phone/Ubuntu Touch on at present because it has the most RAM: 2GB and it has the most cores(QUAD-CORE) and most importantly because the Nexus 4 is one of only four devices officially supported by Canonical.\nI have done my best to summarize everything necessary to dual-boot android 4.2.2 and the latest functional/stable(saucy 100) ubuntu phone on the Google Nexus 4:\nhttp://adequatech.ca/#ubuntuphonerunsonwindrogersnexus4\nIt takes about 30 minutes to an hour to finish the entire recipe and get up and dual-booting.  \nThe real question here:  \"Is all this worth the effort?\".  Yes. You will have a phone with a different GUI, a conversation piece, that works for daily tasks.  It is easier to develop applications for and most importantly it is because it's a real GNU/Linux running on the phone just like your desktop which is most important for your digital freedom and digital privacy.  The Google Nexus 4 is definitely worth buying.  Google should continue selling this phone. \nThe reason Android 4.2.2 is specified is because some of the radio firmware changed in later versions of Android jellybean and Android kitkat resulting in losing call/sms/wifi capability from within Ubuntu Touch/Phone. Don't upgrade the Android version on the Nexus 4 after the above recipe.  In your Android 4.2.2, disable automatic upgrades as much as you can in play store settings and security settings.\n", "Q: How do I remove the mouse battery indicator? I just upgraded from 13.04 to 13.10 and it seems there has been a new notification/status bar thingy (sorry I'm new to Ubuntu) for my mouse battery. It is in the place where it normally tells me how much laptop battery time/charge I have left. If I click on it, I can see the laptop battery status.\nI want to disable the info for the mouse and only display for my laptop battery. How do I do this? \n\nA: It seems that is a known issue, I'm not certain if there is a definitive way. Do you have laptop-mode-tools installed? \nYou can wait for it to be fixed, that's all I really know. \n", "Q: problems with RT3290 card running using RT2800 driver on Ubuntu 13.04 I have the RT3290 Ralink wireless card run using the original RT2800 driver that came with the 13.04 system, on an ASUS F75V laptop.\nEvery time I reboot, Rf-kill shows the wireless as hard-blocked. It cannot be unblocked using neither Rf-kill nor the supposed Fn+f2 key combination, as various other posts suggest. After boot, in network manager, both the wifi and the airplane mode show up as \"off\".\nI dug up a workaround on some obscure forum thread which I unfortunately was unable to dig up again (this was awhile back):\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn airplane mode on (it stays on).\n\n*Hit the \"on\" button for the wireless (it will go back to off very quickly).\n\n*Immediately send the computer into sleep mode. \n\n*Wake the machine up. Wireless is working (it's a miracle!).\n\n\nUnfortunately, the effects don't last past the next system boot. I am tired and annoyed by having to redo this \"trick\" over and over again...\nSo, I tried the official RT3290 driver (Following this post: How do I get a Ralink RT3290 wireless card working?).\nAfter reboot, the wireless was supposedly on (not blocked as usual). However, no wireless networks were discovered (and this is at the same location where the RT2800 driver worked previously without fail after the \"trick\").\nI removed the RT2800 driver from the blacklist, and now I'm back to the airplane-sleep trick workaround.\nAny suggestions on how to fix it once and for all?\nThanks!\nUPDATE: I upgraded to kernel 3.11.5 and tried the rt3290sta driver again. Unfortunately, same result... Wireless is on and unblocked, no networks visible.\nJust to confirm that I have RT3290,\nlspci -nnk | grep RT\n\nyields \n    03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Ralink corp.

After emerging from suspend, the wireless worked!\nWhat this shows is that either rt3290sta and rt2800pci suffer from the same problem, or, more likely, that the problem is not in the driver itself but elsewhere.\n\nA: What finally solved the problem was this solution by @chili555 here:\nWireless disabled by hardware switch on an Asus X550V\nFor me, values 1 and 4 both worked.\nAs an aside, at the moment of this post I am on Trusty alpha (yikes!), which means the 3.12 kernel, and using the rt2800pci driver that came with the kernel by default.\n", "Q: Ubuntu display - no existent My HP Pavillion Dv5 1004nr worked great with Ubuntu up until 11.04. Now, ever since Unity desktop environment the display has been sporadic at best. I was told that the video driver bugs (known and largely ignored) were fixed for the ATI raedon card in my laptop with 13.04. So I installed it. 13.04 doesn't even detect the display. Boots to black screen every time now. Is there ever going to be a fix for the AMD architecture with ATI raedon chipsets? do the developers even care? this has been an issue for years, and no sign of a fix in sight....\n\nA: The legacy graphics driver that you need is not available in the Ubuntu Software Center in Ubuntu 13.04. That is why you're getting a black screen. This is also the reason why your HP Pavilion dv5-1004nr laptop worked great with Ubuntu up until Ubuntu 11.04.\nHowever you can still install the correct graphics driver for your HP Pavilion dv5 1004nr laptop on Ubuntu 13.04 by adding this Ubuntu PPA (Personal Package Archive): ppa:makson96/fglrx to your system's Software Sources. In order to install the AMD Catalyst Legacy 13.1 graphics driver on Ubuntu 13.04, open the terminal and run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-legacy  \n\n...and then reboot to enable the AMD Catalyst Legacy 13.1 graphics driver.\nTaking a longer range view of things, the AMD Catalyst Legacy 13.1 graphics driver is not supported for Ubuntu 13.10, and Ubuntu 13.04 will not be supported by updates after January, 2014. So that doesn't give you an operating system that is supported by updates for a long period of time unless you install Ubuntu 12.04, which is a Long Term Support release that is supported by updates until April, 2017. The same terminal commands listed above are also the commands used to install the AMD Catalyst Legacy 13.1 graphics driver in Ubuntu 12.04.\nFor the time being you still have Ubuntu 13.04, so this gives you an opportunity to test whether the AMD Catalyst Legacy 13.1 graphics driver solves your black screen problem, and then after that you can decide whether or not to install Ubuntu 12.04.\n", "Q: Can I set up a cron job on Ubuntu Phone I've been looking around, and can't find if Ubuntu Touch can run cron.\nSo my question is: Can it?\nAlso does it have a standard set of bash utils installed?\n\nA: Cron and many command line tools are available. It is however not possible to safe any changes made to crontab unless you make your system partition writeable. \nThe implications of making your system partition writeable and how to do it have been discussed in various posts.\nA work around has been suggested in this answer. It involves invoking a script with an infinite loop by upstart (from ~/.config/upstart/). If you are going to use the sleep command in this script, you may want to consider that sleep currently behaves different to what you might expect.\n", "Q: After upgrade to 13.10 64-bit I am unable to update kernel the upgrade went well.

All windows I open have a black, boxy border, including popups, as you can see in the provided image. (The black box in the bottom right is a terminal, which fails to display any text. However, I can enter commands and they execute.) I followed the steps in this post: How do I reset my Unity configuration? to reset Unity using the unity-tweak-tool. Although helpful, that did not fix the issue. I'm thinking this may be a graphics card driver issue.\nAny help is much appreciated.\n\n\nA: I was able to fix the black borders in Ubuntu 13.10 with the commands below. Although I did not have problems with terminal not showing text.\nReset compiz settings:\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\n\nThen restart Unity:\nsetsid unity\n\n(Source)\n\nA: I had the same problem. I fixed it by installing Mir, following these instructions:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mir/Installing\nI had to use XTerm because Terminal was all black.\n\nA: I had the same issue this is what I did:\nTo fix the large black borders bug in Ubuntu, open ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css (create the ~/.config/gtk-3.0 folder if it doesn't exist) with a text editor (I'll use Gedit below):\nmkdir -p ~/.config/gtk-3.0\ngedit ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\n\nand in this file, add the following:\n.window-frame {\nbox-shadow: none;\nmargin: 1px;\n}\n\nThis forces any theme you use to have a 1 pixel border. You can use any value you want - for instance, use \"0\" for borderless windows.\nThen save the file and close all the applications affected by the black border bug (or you can log out and log back in), then try them again and you shouldn't see large black borders any more. \nsource\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.4lts iPhone 5 can't mount. test this computer loops endlessly Just what the subject said. \nWife just got a new iPhone 5c iOS 7.

However after upgrading to 13.10, very strange things started happening.\nFirst I started noticing that Apache2 was hitting RLIMIT_NPROC which was set to 50, even though Apache actually only seemed to have a couple of processes. See more detail in this thread. I assumed it was a problem related to the upgrade of Apache 2.2 to Apache 2.4.\nHowever now I am also experiencing strange things with RLIMIT_AS. In my application I set RLIMIT_AS to 1e9 (1GB) for each process, which should be more than enough. However I am randomly getting out of memory errors.\nHas something changed between kernel 3.8 and 3.11 in the way setrlimit works?\n\nA: There where changes to apparmor that could affect rlimit enforcement in the Ubuntu 3.11 kernel in saucy. Note these changes currently only apply to the Ubuntu Saucy kernel and not to the upstream kernels as saucy is using apparmor patches that have not entered the upstream kernel yet.\nIf rlimits are not working correctly please file a bug.\n", "Q: How to activate subpixel font hinting for the text inside Firefox, Chrome and evince? I used the answers to this question to tune the subpixel font hinting in the Unity interface. However, the text rendered inside Firefox , Chrome or evince doesn't use subpixel anti-aliasing. Sadly these three applications are the one which need it the most.\nSubpixel font hinting is enabled almost everywhere else.\nHow to activate it for these applications ?\n\nA: Firefox seems not to read the GTK configuration, but it does will honor your ~/.fonts.conf which basically contains the font configuration, including the sub-pixel order.\nThis is an example .fonts.conf which comes from a 2005 blog post which may help out, what you most likely want to change is the rgba value (sub-pixel order) to match your LCD and maybe the antialias value.\n<?xml version='1.0'?> <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'> <fontconfig>\n<match target=\"font\">\n    <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"autohint\">\n        <bool>false</bool>\n    </edit>\n</match>\n<match target=\"font\">\n    <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"rgba\">\n        <const>rgb</const>\n    </edit>\n</match>\n<match target=\"font\">\n    <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"hinting\">\n        <bool>true</bool>\n    </edit>\n</match>\n<match target=\"font\">\n    <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"hintstyle\">\n        <const>hintfull</const>\n    </edit>\n</match>\n<match target=\"font\">\n    <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"antialias\">\n        <bool>true</bool>\n    </edit>\n</match> </fontconfig>\n\n\nA: There are two places where you can alter the fonts appearance:\n1. Run dconf and find org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings schema. Hinting, antialiasing and RGBA order can be set there. These settings affect GTK and Unity applications.\n2. Take a look at /etc/fonts/conf.d folder. It actually contains symlinks from /etc/fonts/conf.avail. For example, if you want to change your hinting style from slight to full, remove one symlink and add another.\nsudo rm /etc/fonts/conf.d/10-hinting-slight.conf\nsudo ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/10-hinting-full.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/\n\nIn your case check whether 10-no-sub-pixel.conf symlink exists in /etc/fonts/conf.d folder. If yes, remove it and add 10-sub-pixel-rgb.conf symlink as described earlier.\nThese settings affect non-GTK applications like Firefox and some other.\nIf you need some proven resources about fonts configuration you can look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fonts (mostly consists of custom ~/.fonts.conf and quite old). Another great resource is https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Font_Configuration (contains multiple hints and up to date).\nBTW Direct editing of /etc/fonts/fonts.conf is not recommended. You'd better add /etc/fonts/local.conf or ~/.fonts.conf with your custom settings which will prevail over the settings in /etc/fonts/fonts.conf.\n", "Q: How to interpret Ubuntu's ON/OFF toggle buttons? I have the same question as another poster and his question wasn't answered.  It seemed like the people giving help didn't understand the question, so here we go again.  The original poster's question is below.\nWhat does the OFF on an ON/OFF toggle switch mean?  Is it saying the function is OFF, or is it saying if you click it, it will turn OFF?  I find it confusing.  \nI don't care about why anybody designed it that way, I just want the answer to the simple question above.  I am that dumb I have to ask the question.\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/262242/how-to-interpret-gnomes-on-off-toggle-buttons\n\nA: If it shows 'off', that is the current state. If you click it and it goes from on->off, there you have it. It's now off.\n\nA: \nas you can see in the picture, orange = ON and grey = OFF\nit's like the Latex philosophy: WYSIWYM - what you see is what you mean\nit's definitely not WYSIWYG  ;-)\n", "Q: What is the upgrade manager? What exactly is the role of the upgrade manager?\nI've noticed that the last few releases of ubuntu downloads an upgrade manager once you press the upgrade button. I thought the upgrade was merely handled by apt?\n\nA: It is still handled by apt. All the Graphic Software install programs in Ubuntu do invoke apt in the background and provide buttons and a nice looking gui. But it's nearly the same as when you type apt-get install <package-name> in a terminal.\n\nA: The upgrade manager is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the APT system. It uses update-manager-core as back end which at the same time uses python-apt. So at the end you will be still using the apt-get libraries to get the work done.\nThe Upgrade Manager instead of the usual sudo apt-get upgrade uses a tactic similar to sudo apt-get dist-upgrade which normally removes/installs more packages than what upgrade does. So, yeah, behind the curtains you are still using apt just that with a nice GUI that doesn't looks as scary as the command line.\n", "Q: Booting system without full network configuration, how to reverse? Hi I am running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and I have not been able to connect to the internet through a cable from the satellite. So I found the following advice:\nstart the terminal and type\ngksu gedit /etc/network/interfaces\nFile will opened in gedit. It will be empty or should contain \nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\nIn gedit add following lines and save it and close\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\nand restart the network manager It works fine with my case\nSo I followed it and now ubuntu says \"waiting for network configuration\", followed by \"Booting system without full network configuration\". It takes a few minutes to start the computer now. It also got rid of the little connection icon that normally lets me know if networks are in range or if a wire is plugged in. My question is how do I reverse this? And is there a way to be able to connect to the internet through the wire.\nYour help would be greatly appreciated. I am completely new to this and it was my first attempt at using the terminal and it back fired ;)\nThank you so much, Sandra\n\nA: To undo it you can remove the lines that the guide had you add to the /etc/network/interfaces file, and restart the network manager. \nHowever, it sounds like you're not getting an IP address. I don't know how you'd plug directly into a satellite, but if you're plugging into a router (which is plugged into a satellite) I suggest rebooting it and waiting a few minutes (and then restarting your pc or network manager) to see if it helps. \n\nA: So you basically say you're using a desktop version of Ubuntu otherwise you wouldn't have the network manager icon. In order to get this configuration working you'll need to make the file /etc/network/interfaces empty and add network connections using your network manager tool.\n", "Q: Intel GMA X3100 external monitor resolution issue I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 on a MacBook 4,1 (Intel GMA X3100 graphics chipset) on an external monitor, but can only get a resolution of 1024 x 768 (I get 1280 x 1024 in OS X).\nI'm able to force the resolution to 1280 x 1024 using the xrandr command as per these instructions, but there are two issues now:\n\n\n*\n\n*The screen is off center, by maybe a couple dozen pixels up and to the left.\n\n*The instructions are for 10.04, and the directions for making the change permanent do not work in 12.04.\nAny way to fix this?\nUPDATE: I believe the driver is the root of the problem.

Your display adapter is recognized correctly with the same output as mine.\n-Use the xrandr command as you have to set the resolution correctly.\n-Use the orientation command to set the monitor to the left (or right) of the built in display\n-(For me this step fixed the pixel overlap issue: NOW go into the settings for your system and move the arrangement. \nThis destkop settings application is sure to be different for your version of Ubuntu; 18.04 is back to gnome and no longer the unity desktop.\nOnce you're happy with the set of xrandr commands that work for you, I recommend placing those into \"~/.xprofile\". These commands will automatically run when you log in at the terminal and get your desktop.\nThis link is excellent from the ubuntu wiki, and gives you other options for automatically configuring this.\nNote: As you know configuring new resolutions can get tricky; if you pick a bad resolution you may get only one screen or NO screens. I get the terminal application in front and have a history of commands ready with resolution settings. Use the arrow keys and  to see if you can dial it in.\n    If you get black screens, usually unplugging the second monitor and/or closing the laptop lid for 30 seconds and reopening it will remedy the issue temporarily.\n", "Q: Can't use PHP extension Mcrypt in Ubuntu 13.10 (Nginx, PHP-FPM) I installed a fresh Ubuntu 13.10 on my laptop.

I've done this setup many times and it always worked.\n\nA: I had the same problem after I upgraded to 13.10 this evening. Apparently this is a genuine Ubuntu 13.10 bug: “phpmyadmin do not recognize php5-mcrypt”. The PHP modules got moved from the conf.d directory to the mods-available directory, and the mcrypt module got left behind.\nTo fix it I put a symlink to the mcrypt.ini file in the PHP config.\nApache\nIf you use Apache (rather than php-fpm):\nsudo ln -s /etc/php5/conf.d/mcrypt.ini /etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/20-mcrypt.ini\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nphp-fpm\nOr for php-fpm (rather than Apache):\n\n\n*\n\n*Make symbolic link to ini files in mods-available  \nsudo ln -s /etc/php5/conf.d/mcrypt.ini /etc/php5/mods-available/mcrypt.ini\n\n\n*Enable mods  \nsudo php5enmod mcrypt\n\n\n*Restart FPM  \nsudo service php5-fpm restart\n\n\n\nA: Or, use:\nsudo apt-get install php5-mcrypt\n\nIm not sure of this will work on standard php installs - I installed php 5.5.7 using the package from:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5\nsudo apt-get update\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu for old pc Ubuntu Admins, please listen to me..

My CPU seems to be going from 70 to 30 every 5 seconds or so. Same for the wireless. Weird stuff going on\n\n\nA: Well, maybe there is a heavy process running behind as root, and you can't see it normally in System Monitor. Go to the processes tab, click 'View' in the menu and select 'All Processes' if you see one (it should be in one of the sub-folders), then check for the one that uses the highest CPU usage. One big possibility is the oneconf process, that eats up the CPU and RAM at some times. (You can't remove it if you want to use software center, it's a dependency)  \nBesides that, Ubuntu is quite strange as it will magically update your software catalog in some times (that's why for your WIFI) just because it wants to check for system updates (and the CPU and RAM usage will be high). Hope that helps\n", "Q: Can't use PHP extension Solr in Ubuntu 13.10 (Apache) After I upgraded to Ubuntu 13.10, the local development version of my website stopped working with a PHP warning:\ninclude(SolrQuery.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory\n\nI checked the pecl solr extension is installed:\n> sudo pecl install solr\npecl/solr is already installed and is the same as the released version 1.0.2\n\nI checked the Solr Apache extension is set up:\n> cat /etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/solr.ini\nextension=solr.so\n\nAny idea where the problem could be?\n\nThe command php -m doesn't seem to show solr.\n\nA: The fix was to uninstall and then reinstall the solr pecl extension:\nsudo pecl uninstall solr\nsudo pecl install -n solr\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\nBefore uninstalling, I noticed the solr.so was in the wrong place (/usr/lib/php5/20100525/solr.so).

First, I hope that this is not a duplicate, because I found my question quite strange and unique, and I don't have any idea with it.  These days I heard of the new Ubuntu release, version 13.10 and I am quite excited. I have been stuck in 12.04 for such a long time and it's time for a good upgrade. So...I ran update-manager -d and tried to go up to 12.10. (I decided to go up one by one)\nIt took a very long time to download all the required kernel and packages...and soon installing...and some questions asking me if I want to replace the old config files. I did some tweaking with that system before (changing startup applications, TMPFS, zram-enabler, etc) and I thought that it will cause a real crash if I keep these config files. So, I replaced all of them but it goes too slow and it's time I've to go to school. I asked my grandfather if he could help me to click all the 'Replace' buttons for me and shut down the computer after the upgrade finished. \nWhen I was back from school, he told me that he accidentally clicked 'Keep' for the last popup box, and my computer can't function now. The grub menu is still there (made it appear by using the SHIFT key trick), and the splash screen is still visible, and I hope that the login screen is still there, or at least the tty so that I can still do a rescue, but nothing worked. CTRL+ALT+F1 does nothing, and I am sure that the monitor is still functioning.  So what can I do now? \n\nA: In a case like this, you probably don't want to invest too much time in troubleshooting the problem and after that doing the entire chain of upgrades from Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 13.10. Considering that a fresh install only takes about a half hour, I recommend that you backup all your personal data, using an Ubuntu live CD/DVD/USB if necessary, and then do a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.10. \nMany things have changed from Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 13.10, such as the way to access Software Sources and Additional Drivers from the desktop, and doing a fresh install will also prevent possible problems from being introduced somewhere in the chain of upgrades from Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 13.10.\n", "Q: How to Install Ubuntu Touch on Nexus 4 using Mac OS X? Will this work on a Mac? I want to install Ubuntu Touch on Nexus 4 but I'm pretty sure apt-get isn't compliant with the fruit shell.

It would be cool if like torrent, it pause and resume on connection!\n\nA: If you do it from the terminal, apt remembers what it has already downloaded, and it should just reasume where it left off. It is the same with yum on Fedora.\nTo update with apt in the terminal, do:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nand:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nto do a dist upgarde (ie. ubuntu 13.04 to 13.10) then do:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nfor more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt-get.html and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto\n", "Q: How can I tell state of program seemingly running I had Firefox running, then (possibly) as a result of a key combination I don't recall, it quickly vanished from screen and Task Bar/Window List.\nps ax | grep firefox returns the below+the unneeded grep firefox line (Both ps and the GUI Task Manager, show firefox with seemingly unchanging RSS, VM-SIZE and 0% CPU usage):\njohndoe      1916 36.6 14.0 923772 504372 tty1    Sl   13:30  12:15 firefox\n*CORRECTED*\npstree | grep firefox returns:  \ninit─┬─2*[ROX-Filer───firefox───25*[{firefox}]]\nHow can I tell what state the program is in?\n\nA: It's probably a zombie process.\n\nZ    defunct (\"zombie\") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent.\n\nIf you run ps ax | grep firefox it will show you the status of the process, you can check against this list of status of the process (you must read the STAT column).

It worked well, but when the official release caught up to the bug fixes I dried to drop the PPA packages and there are some of them I can not get rid of.\nPackages were from here: https://launchpad.net/~andrikos/\nI know how to down grade packages using Synaptic (Force Version...) and apt-get package=version.  However, with some of the packages there are so many dependencies that is is no feasible to uninstall them all (as Synaptic wants to do).\nThis is what I would like to do:\nsudo apt-get install -f libncurses5=5.9-10ubuntu4 libncursesw5=5.9-10ubuntu4 libncurses5:i386=5.9-10ubuntu4 libncursesw5:i386=5.9-10ubuntu4 libtinfo5=5.9-10ubuntu4 libtinfo5:386=5.9-10ubuntu4\n\nBut I get several hundreds of packages that have to be removed to meet the request.

I even uninstalled/reinstalled that applet with no luck.\nAlso my \"clock\" settings under System Preferences are all disabled.

I performed a reboot and my clock is back.\n\nA: There's a bug report for that in Launchpad.\nQuick fix:\nOpen terminal (ctrl + alt + T) and type\nkillall unity-panel-service\n\n\nA: Found the issue.  I built a few libraries from source earlier in /usr/local/lib .  indicator-datetime-service found those libraries before the system libraries in /usr/lib for some reason.  It shouldn't have done that.\nOne of those libraries pulled in the old libical.so.0 dependency which was no longer available.  When I deleted all the GNOME/Evolution related libraries in /usr/local/lib I could start indicator-datetime-service again and my clock shown up.\nSo also try...\nldd --verbose /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/indicator-datetime-service\n\nAnd look for any \"not found\" messages in the output.  If you have a library dependency issue it will most likely show up in that output.\n\nA: I had the same problem, (no clock displayed and settings disabled)\nI had to select the default server for update in System Preferences.\nReboot, and the clock was back.\n", "Q: Keyboard not working 100% after Ubuntu 13.10 upgrade I have this weird issue on my laptop right now.

But other than this (on the desktop), no output from the keyboard when using all the other apps - as in I start to type and nothing comes out. \nThe surprising thing is that when I shift to Guest session, the keyboard functions normally. \nWhen I shift to another TTY, like Alt+F5, keyboard works normally.\nThis is the first time I've encountered this so far in my use of Linux. Keyboards normally never fail on any of the desktop environments I've used over the years.\nAny ideas what's happening? Could be the config files on my home is too messy already.

When I plug the headphones into the jack, there is sound for about 1 second and then it cuts out.  The laptop speakers work fine.  I've tried editing analog-output.conf and analog-output-headphones.conf but haven't been successful.  I've also uninstalled/reinstalled pulseaudio and have tried using alsamixer.  \nWhat am I doing wrong?  I'm pulling my hair out!\n\nA: Type alsamixer into your terminal. Then scroll with your directional keys to the right until the tab \"auto-mut\" is highlighted red. If your problem is anything like mine, it will be \"Enabled.\" Hit the up directional arrow to change the status to \"Disabled.\" That did the trick for me. \n\nA: I had the same issue since 13.10 upgrade. I poked around in alsamixer, sytematically changing settings, and found that if I changed the automute setting to line out. It worked for me, hopefully it will work for you. \n", "Q: Netflix Desktop not working after update Netflix Desktop was working fine until I upgraded to Ubuntu 13.10 today. Now, it gives me the message that the silverlight plugin has crashed. I tried different workarounds and to even downgrade my silverlight version to 4--apparently 5 does not work.\nI would appreciate help with this issue, and I'm sure I'm not the only one experiencing it.\n\nA: you need to uninstall netflix-desktop and wine-compholio by purging them both \napt-get purge netflix-desktop wine-compholio\n\nAfter this is done follow the instructions here:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2013/08/pipelight-use-silverlight-in-your-linux.html\n\nA: Thanks! Actually, I was able to solve it a few days ago using the last few comments here. It was determined that my issue had something to do with hw-acceleration. I didn't get the chance to post back here.\n\nA: If you tried pipelight without success do this:\nsudo pipelight-plugin --disable-all\nsudo rm /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libpipelight.so\npipelight-plugin --disable-all\nIn my case the problem was related to hardware acceleration. Running netflix desktop using the command below worked for me:\nwine-browser --disable-hw-acceleration\nIf the above works for you you can make changes to the launcher that will stick until the next update to netflix-desktop by issuing the following commands:\nsudo mv /usr/share/wine-browser-installer/hw-accel-default /usr/share/wine-browser-installer/hw-accel-default2\necho -e '#!/bin/sh\\nexit 1;' | sudo tee /usr/share/wine-browser-installer/hw-accel-default\nsudo chmod +x /usr/share/wine-browser-installer/hw-accel-default\nSource: https://answers.launchpad.net/netflix-desktop/+question/237615\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 upgraded from 13.04 issues The keyboard stopped working after a while, I started using 13.04 again VIA USB because I am waiting for the keyboard issues that 13.10 has to get an update. 13.04 had tons of issues I didn't care about because most of it worked. Now almost none of it works. There's even a huge amount of graphical errors.

Is it okay to delete all the kernels that aren't the 3.8.0-31 generic one?\n\nA: When you dist-upgrade you move on to the new kernel. Excepting troubles you'd never normally boot into one of the older kernels you've left behind. Me I like to remove all but the most recent two of linux-image* and linux-headers* once I've accumulated four or five. I have jettisoned 3.8.0-19.30 through 3.8.0-26.38, and I'm due for another cleaning.\nI don't know why an app would affect /boot though.

I reinstalled Ubuntu and I did not install any programs, I just rebooted after logging in. It came to the login just fine. You need to install one program at a time until you get to that one program that makes the whole OS go screwy. That is my only suggestion, I hope this helps.\n\nA: I had sorta same issue.\nHave Lenovo W520. Put the video card to be in discrete mode and disabled optimus from BIOS.\nI installed ubuntu 13.10 64bit and the computer would hang. Nvidia 304 or 319 alike...\nI then put 'acpi_backlight=vendor' onto the the linux line (the one refering to vmlinuz), and the boot never hanged. hope this helps somebody!\n\nA: Because you are on a time constraint my advise would be to simply re-install. Otherwise you will have to troubleshoot your system to find out the problem. It may be a simple fix but there is no guarantee. In the future you should test the upgrade using a LiveCD. Take this as a lesson. \n", "Q: How to remove synaptic without installing all the unwanted packages? I am trying to uninstall synaptic.

I've already dropped to terminal (ctrl+alt+f2) and done this:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nsudo apt-get install unity\n\nLogging in as a guest session also fails.\nLogging in to other window managers works with varying degrees of success.\nNote: I have Cinnamon 2.0 installed from PPA.\nI'm using a 2 monitor setup.\nAlso of note is that the session prior to my upgrade to 13.10 the background of unity failed to display at all, instead showing what was there in the screen buffer from the previous frame. The entire OS worked correctly otherwise though, so I just ignored it for the session. No other upgrades or even updates were done prior to this occurring.\nMy upgrade path to 13.10 was basically this: Install 13.04 alongside Windows 7, use ubuntu as a glorified web browser for a while, get updates (in preparation for 13.10), install 13.10.\nI also used Unity Tweak Tool to change some aspects of unity, particularly auto-hide.\nAny help or ideas would be appreciated, as I'm typing this on my phone :(\n\nA: After some research it seems to be that Unity in 13.10 has serious issues if Cinnamon 2.0 is installed. I don't have a full answer yet, but I at least have some more things to try now.\nOK I found an answer! Unfortunately it means removing cinnamon entirely, but until it doesn't mess up unity I'll have to hold off.\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo apt-get purge --auto-remove cinnamon\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get update -f\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get remove .*cinnamon.*\nsudo apt-get remove .*nemo.*\n\nReboot and everything should be working! It's likely that not all of these steps are needed, but that's what I did to resolve the issue.\n\nA: FIX :  \nStart ubuntu and login\nnow in the blackscreen go to the terminal :  \nctrl-alt-f1\n\ntype      \nnautilus  \n\nand enter,   error? no problem........ now type  \nunity   \n\nand enter     error? np   now without exiting or stoping the unity comand return to the ubuntu interface\nin my pc  is  ctrl-alt-f7  , then now you can open terminal:  \n\nctrl-aLT-t\n\nand type\nnautilus\n\nnautilus will open  ( DO NOT CLOSE NAUTILUS ), now open another terminal without closing nautilus terminal, and type   \nsudo software-properties-gtk\n\nsearch for graphic drivers ....  my problem was the default drivers of X.org\nI have an ati video card and I installed the drivers of fglrx-updates\nif you have nvidia install the drivers of nvidia or if you have ati install the one that i installed, then reboot\nafter login u will see nautilus running well and the wallpaper the only thing not working is unity...\nopen terminal and type:\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\nsetsid unity\n\nthats it.\nI hope this fix your problem.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. After the upgrade, no dash, no unity menu, only the desktop screen. All I could do was ctrl-alt-t for terminal or of course alt-f1 etc.\nI tried all of the fixes mentioned here and elsewhere without any change.\nFinally I ran the unity-tweak-tool --reset-unity and that didn't do anything (though I forgot to reboot). So I ran unity-tweak-tool from the terminal window and manually reset to default each of the setting screen. I then rebooted and now unity is running fine.\nI had tweaked somethings in 13.04, however I thought it wasn't much (icon package, some of the dash behaviors, touchpad behaviour).\nHope this might help someone.\n\nA: I had similar issue after installing cinnamon desktop, unity doesn't start.\nRemoved cinnamon completely and that's all, just logout no need to reboot. \n\nA: I revived my Unity with these steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal, type: sudo apt-get purge alacarte caribou cinnamon cinnamon-bluetooth cinnamon-common cinnamon-control-center cinnamon-control-center-data cinnamon-desktop-data cinnamon-screensaver cinnamon-session cinnamon-settings-daemon cinnamon-translations cjs gir1.2-accountsservice-1.0 gir1.2-caribou-1.0 gir1.2-cinnamondesktop-3.0 gir1.2-clutter-1.0 gir1.2-cogl-1.0 gir1.2-coglpango-1.0 gir1.2-gkbd-3.0 gir1.2-gtkclutter-1.0 gir1.2-json-1.0 gir1.2-muffin-3.0 gir1.2-panelapplet-4.0 gir1.2-polkit-1.0 gir1.2-upowerglib-1.0 gir1.2-xkl-1.0 gnome-applets gnome-applets-data gnome-icon-theme-full gnome-media gnome-panel gnome-panel-data gnome-session-flashback gnome-themes-standard gnome-themes-standard-data gtk2-engines-pixbuf indicator-applet-complete libcaribou-common libcaribou0 libcinnamon-control-center1 libcinnamon-desktop0 libcjs0c libgnome-media-profiles-3.0-0 libmozjs185-1.0 libmuffin0 libnemo-extension1 libopencv-calib3d2.4 libopencv-contrib2.4 libopencv-core2.4 libopencv-features2d2.4 libopencv-flann2.4 libopencv-highgui2.4 libopencv-imgproc2.4 libopencv-legacy2.4 libopencv-ml2.4 libopencv-objdetect2.4 libopencv-photo2.4 libopencv-video2.4 libpanel-applet-4-0 libtbb2 mesa-utils metacity muffin-common nemo nemo-data nemo-fileroller notification-daemon python-opencv python-pyatspi \n\n*After it is finished: sudo apt-get autoremove --purge\n\n*After these, type: sudo apt-get install gnome-shell\n\n*Restart, it will work from now on: you can log in to Unity by choosing on LightDM login screen. \n", "Q: How do reactivate IBUS after upgrading to Ubuntu 13.10 IBUS icon does not appear after upgrading to Ubuntu 13.10. I can't even find the IBUS icon from the Dash. May I know how to reactivate the IBUS? Thanks.\n\nA: I found the answer to fixing this to work with Korean by the following, which basically says you to into terminal, then type\nibus restart\n\nibus-setup\n\nThen you can adjust the settings for the ibus that are missing in the menus!  It worked for me, and now I am able to use Shift+Hangul key after setting it the way that I want. So I suggest you type those two lines into terminal.\n:\n한글키로 한영전환은 잘되고있습니다....\n\n\n우선 제가 사용한 방법은...\n\n그냥 소프트웨어 센터에서 ibus-hangul 만 체크해서 설치하고\n\n언어설정에서 기본입력기를 ibus로 바꿔주고\n\n터미널에서\n\nibus restart\n\nibus-setup\n\n\nA: I found no way to get the ibus icon, either on the desktop nor on the upper bar. But just typing ibus-setup in a terminal gave me access to the settings of ibus.\n\n\n*\n\n*Then I can access and select the ibus keyboard layout with the shortcut applied.\n\n*An icon does appear on pressing the shortcut.\n\n*Using LibreOffice, I had to choose another shortcut than the default [Super-Space], adding a [CRTL-ALT-Space], which does work correctly.\n\n*Also, as I have a Swiss-French keyboard, I must select \"Use the system keyboard\" in the advanced setup, otherwise I get a US keyboard layout.\n\n\nA: Open a terminal window and type/paste:\ndpkg -l ibus* | grep ^ii| awk '{print $2}' | xargs sudo apt-get --reinstall install\n\nThen reboot. After rebooting click on 'Text Entry Settings', followed by + / add-option and choose your language.\nThen it should work just fine.\n\nA: Several of the settings from ibus-setup have been moved to System Settings >> Text Entry, but something in this change to the backend has broken some key functionality in Ibus. Ultimately, this needs a bug report; but I haven't figured out exactly what to report just yet.\nDepending on the languages you use Ibus for, you may still be able to get it to work well enough.\nState of Ibus after installation\nAfter a fresh install of 13.10, I could not add Ibus input sources in Text Entry. Moreover, although apt showed Ibus as installed (which it was), searching in the Dash showed Ibus as not installed.\nPartial resolution\nReinstall Ibus: sudo apt-get install --reinstall ibus\nAfter reinstalling Ibus and rebooting, Ibus input methods were available in Text Entry.\nSome methods, such as Anthy for Japanese, seemed to integrate well with the new system. Anthy configuration settings were available from a button that appears next to the keyboard layout button when Anthy is highlighted in Text Entry. All in all, Anthy worked fine. \nSo depending on the language you need, you may find everything is ok after reinstalling Ibus.\nLarger problems with Chinese input methods\nChinese input methods from Ibus seem to be completely broken. ibus-setup can no longer communicate properly with DConf, reporting permission problems accessing /run/user/<uid>/dconf/. The settings themselves are still available in dconf-editor, but most of them do not seem to be honored by the new backend setup and changing them had no effect. When highlighting the Chinese input methods in Text Entry, a configuration button did not appear like it did for Anthy.\nAs a result, it no longer seems possible to change the pinyin configuration or show the configuration menu. In it's current initial state, pinyin input offers both simplified and traditional characters for some words, but not all of them, making it impossible to type in one or the other, let alone to switch on the fly. Changing the simplified/traditional setting in dconf-editor is one of the few that worked -- but only after rebooting, which is obviously not practical.\nSuggestion\nI imagine these issues will be fixed in time as the bug reports start coming in, but one suggestion is to use fcitx if you need Chinese input. fcitx is used by Ubuntu Kylin. Install it, switch the default input method in System Settings >> Language Support to fcitx, and reboot. After that, configuration menus for all input methods were available again. (You don't need to uninstall Ibus if you will still use it in some cases.) Like Ibus, several fcitx input methods have separate packages, so you may want to browse the packages in Synaptic.\n\nA: I also found that there is something wrong with ibus. And now I just can't input any chinese to my emacs, which works prefectly on ubuntu 13.04.\n", "Q: After upgrade to Ubuntu 13.10, system is very slow I got an notification for automatic upgrade from 13.04 to 13.10 on two of my systems..

I don't use kmail on my Ubuntu anymore. I use Thunderbird now.\nstill I have this 1.6GB large file \n~/.local/share/akonadi/file_db_data\n\nI only guess, it is so large, cause my IMAP folder is about that size and It was created, when I tried out kmail.\nIs that file needed for anything else than kmail?\nIf I would remove the whole akonadi-server with \napt-get remove --purge kmail akonadi-server\n\nwould that delete anything I could still use although I don't use KDE anymore?\nFor example, I still use krusader and some passwords stored there seem to come from the kde-wallet.\n\nA: In general: things that reside in ~/.local/ in a sub-directory belong to the software that the directory is named after. file_db_data belongs to akonadi so deleting the file will affect akonadi. If you do not care about that anymore it is safe to delete both the file and the directory. \nThis:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge kmail akonadi-server\n\nshould also remove that directory and the file. It will not delete krusader. \n\nA: \nThe Akonadi database is NOT your MAIN data storage. Even if it gets destroyed, removed, your data is still safe.\n\nhttps://blogs.kde.org/node/4503\nHowever, if you'll still use Akonadis functionality and you really need the disk space, I would instead recommend to uncouple unneeded data sources (IMAP mail folders etc) and execute this command: akonadictl vacuum\n", "Q: Compiz plugin (Grid) does not update in CCSM I upgraded to 13.10. Compiz itself has been updated properly to 0.9.10.2, but in CCSM, one* plugin (Grid) shows up as the old version.

Ubuntu 13.10 will not boot, it won't even show the grub menu or Ubuntu booting. There is just a purple screen for 20 seconds then a black screen, then the screen says entering power save mode. here are my system specs:Intel DQ965GF Motherboard (OS independant), Intel core 2 64-bit, 12GB HHD (SATA), 200GB HHD (SATA, installed here), 250GB HHD (SATA, Encrypted with LUKS), 3GB DDR2 RAM (DIMM 0 A 1024MB,DIMM 1 A 524MB, DIMM 0 B 1024MB, DIMM 1 B 524MB),2 Rewritable DVD drives (one SATA and one IDE), small floppy drive and car reader, and AMD gallium 0.4.

Does this mean  will never be able to use Ubuntu 13.10? I think I am screwed.\n\nA: I will suppose that your hardware is OK (the power save mode is handled by your screen).\nMaybe your GRUB configuration file has been truncated/corrupted; I suggest to directly reinstall Ubuntu from a new media. Follow carefully this procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the last version from torrent; if you can't use HTTP (standard download) but after that check the MD5 sum of the file (torrent clients will do a similar operation automatically).\n\n*Buy a new DVD and check it's integrity.\n\n*From your BIOS option (try F2, F8, CANC ecc. more times at the power on) disable any builtin boot sector protection (like the boot VIRUS protection) and any Interl/AMD fast -startup option (like the \"SpeedStep\").\n\n*Burn and Install Ubuntu without the internet connection support.\n\n*Remove the DVD and let it cool down; close the reader/writer device.\n\n*Close the reader/writer device and reboot.\n\n*Press ENTER on the Ubuntu entry of the GRUB menu. Don't press other keys.\n\n\nIf this procedure doesn't function you can burn a Live Distribution to check your GRUB configuration or use a specific software. I've already talked here about this type of problems with GRUB; the specific software (in the bottom of the post) can be also installed on a Live Distro.\nA suggestion: don't throw away your old Linux DVDs, they can always be useful, so conserve them in a safe & dark place.\nLet me know with a comment if you solve or not, I'll answer to your questions.\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu 13.04 in ativ book 9 lite im trying install ubuntu 13.04 but when installation finished cant start ubuntu please help with bios configuration and how to install ubuntu on this ativ book 9 lite.\ni try disabling fast boot, disabling secure boot, etc but no result.\n\nA: Finally I install windows, update bios then install Ubuntu with out secure boot and with out custom partitions it work then customize partitions. \n\nA: Actually this machine can boot Ubuntu with secure boot on. Or in Legacy CSM mode(non-EFI) Just boot your install medium in UEFI mode. It won't boot directly after installation, so you need to use a liveUbuntu medium again and run through boot-repair, So secure boot is correctly set up.\nFor some unknown reason it refuses to boot regularly, non secured UEFI installations correctly.\nAlso the samsung-laptop kernel module will be disabled, which makes, for example, some of the hot-keys not to work. It will probably take a long time until that driver is rewritten or Samsung starts to get the reputation that they learn to implement non-brickable firmwares.

one again after the upgrade ?\nEDIT: apparently it has something to do with AMD proprietary binaries ... i think\n\nA: As ZiglioNZ says, the first thing you need to do is remove the xorg-edgers repo:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge xorg-edgers\n\nOne of my laptops worked after this. However on another laptop this didn't seem to fix the problem. Checking the log file /var/log/dist-upgrade/main.log I noticed that the error hadn't changed, I was still seeing a failure like:\n2013-10-28 14:38:03,043 DEBUG Installing 'xserver-xorg-video-all' (Distro KeepInstalledPkgs rule)\n2013-10-28 14:38:03,518 ERROR Dist-upgrade failed: 'E:Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.'\n\nSo I simply uninstalled the offending package and tried the upgrade again:\nsudo apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-all\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nand the upgrade was able to continue successfully this time.\nOnce the upgrade was complete, I then had a working system but apparently no X driver. So the first thing I did after login was add the xorg-edgers ppa back in and install the necessary driver:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331\n\n\nA: Try this:\n sudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n sudo ppa-purge xorg-edgers\n\nSee also this. It seems to be working for me, I'm in the middle of the upgrade.\n", "Q: Cursor disappearing in a Ideapad Yoga? Upgraded from 13.04 to 13.10 on my Ideapad Yoga yesterday, hoping it might have fixes for a couple of issues I've been having. While it seems to have made the touchscreen more usable, it has made the problem with my trackpad even worse.\nIn 13.04 and below, the cursor occasionally (maybe once or twice a day) would completely stop working and to get it working again I would run\nsudo modprobe -r psmouse\nsudo modprobe psmouse\n\nand it would be happy again, now every hour or so, my cursor just goes invisible, you can tell its still there as you can hover over things and they will respond. Again running\nsudo modprobe -r psmouse\nsudo modprobe psmouse\n\nworks but it's getting a little annoying now its so frequent!\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on things to try? \n\nA: FYI, doug's response here seems to have solved the problem for me. Several hours now with no issue. Using Synergy heavily as well, which was always a sure way to make it vanish.\nThe gist: gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.cursor active false\nThanks for the modprobe suggestion, though. That made the issue at least tolerable!\n\nA: Try hitting alt + ctrl + F6, then alt + ctrl + F7. \nThis will switch two virtual console 6 then back virtual console 7. This brings my mouse pointer back. If it works for you then you can do this automatically by adding a script to:\n/etc/pm/sleep.d/\nI called mine 'mouse_hack' and in it all I have is: 'chvt 6; chvt 7'.\nIt should be owned by root, and be executable. \nThis just automates what you did manually above whenever your computer resumes.\n\nA: This is not a complete answer but may mitigate the problem. This occurs for me when I unlock my computer, among other conditions (VLC, as mentioned, forr example). If you put your modprobe lines into a bash script and place the script in /etc/pm/sleep.d , then it runs automatically on resume, and this for me makes sure I have my pointer each time I wake up my computer.\nBit of a hack for now, but it saves me some trouble at least.\n", "Q: Upgraded to 13.10, screen regularly flashes between red, green, blue, greys after boot. No X11 or Unity I have a Z77 board with a GeForce GTX 670. My monitor is a Korean 27\" IPS with only a single DVI Dual-link connection, and a resolution of 2560x1440. After upgrading to 13.10 today, Unity and the X Window System are non-functional. After booting up, all I see is a screen that flashes between red, green, blue, various blacks, greys, and whites at regular intervals. From here I can switch to command line, and that displays fine, but starting lightdm takes me back to the flashing colors. I had this problem on 13.04, but I was able to fix it by editing xorg.conf with the proper information about my monitor. No such luck for 13.10. I have tried: \n\n\n*\n\n*installing different drivers (i.e. nvidia-current, nvidia-experimental)\n\n*plugging into both DVI ports on my 670\n\n*editing xorg.conf myself\n\n*letting the Nvidia package do the xorg.conf configuration automatically\n\n\nAdmittedly I know very little about X Window system, and all my editing was based on xorg.conf files posted by others that were claimed to work, none of which used the same combination of monitor and video card as mine. I'm out of ideas at this point, input from someone who knows what they're doing would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Article explaining the issue and solution: http://neogregious.blogspot.com/2013/05/korean-ips-monitors-and-nvidia-under.html\nHere is a short summary of the solution(credit goes to Greg Fawcett):\nCreate an xorg conf:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nNow you need to edit the new xorg.conf file:\nsudo vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nFind the section below, and add the - Option \"IgnoreEDIDChecksum\" \"DFP\" - line :\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    Option         \"IgnoreEDIDChecksum\" \"DFP\"\nEndSection\n\nSave the file, and reboot.\n\nA: Seems like your graphics drivers are messed up. You'll need to purge all the Nvidia packages you created by experimenting with them:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\nThen reinstall the Nvidia-current:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nDon't forget to reboot!\n", "Q: Can't install Bumblebee on Ubuntu 13.10 I have a newly installed Ubuntu 13.10, and I have followed instructions from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee. \nThe first two steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*(not needed for 13.10 Saucy and newer) sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\n\n*Enable the Universe and Multiverse repositories (for bumblebee and nvidia packages respectively). \nThese two steps are OK.\nBut the third step is: \n\n*sudo apt-get update\nAfter invoke this command, here is the result:\nW: can not dowload http://ppa.launchpad.net/bumblebee/stable/ubuntu/dists/saucy/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\nE: Some index files failed to download.

Right now, If I try to move my pointer (using the mouse), it won't work. I need to wait a couple of seconds. (The touchpad works fine)\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I found my problem to be laptop-mode-tools. \nI removed that and installed TLP instead. Everything is perfect now.\n", "Q: Downgrade to Nautilus 3.4 from Ubuntu 13.10 / Nautilus 3.8 I just updated to Ubuntu 13.10 and greatly dislike Nautilus 3.8 that comes with it. In Ubuntu 13.04 I used the instructions in this article to get back some of the features from Nautilus 3.4, but unfortunately that doesn't work anymore. I particularly miss dividing up the window with F3 to have two folders show at the same time. The new search function I also find pretty terrible.\nI checked out Nemo but I would much prefer downgrading to Nautilus 3.4.\n\nA: I'm going to risk answering this question since I now feel I have collected enough information on this issue. Basically downgrading to Nautilus 3.4 seems not to be an option at this time; it was coded for an earlier version of GTK, thus it wont compile on Ubuntu 13.10. The only practical way is installing a different file browser.\nAs it happens, Nemo is actually a fork of Nautilus 3.4 that has kept all the features of the latter (adding a few more). I've been using it since yesterday and the interface is almost the same, a seamless transition for the user. Thus installing Nemo is not very far from downgrading to Nautilus 3.4. I haven't done it yet, but it is possible to set Nemo as the default file browser.\nAll features I used in Nautilus 3.4 seem to function properly in Nemo (e.g. Connect to Server). The only exception at this stage is the integration with RabbitVCS, there's a package available but non functional at the moment. Since RabbitVCS doesn't work on Nautilus 3.8 either, it is not a regression.\nUpdate II: There's no need to install Cinnamon, just install the Nemo package:\nsudo apt-get install nemo\n\nUpdate I: Nemo's appearance can be tweaked into something closer to the default Unity style.

I get the following error message: \n\nThe xsp4 web server cannot be found. Please ensure that it is\n  installed.\n\nBut mono-xsp4 is installed and runs automatically or can be run manually (sudo service mono-xsp4 start or just xsp4)\nHowever I had some problems getting mono-xsp4 to work (I don't know if this is related to the monodevelop problem so I describe it aswell). On apt-get install mono-xsp4 I got:\nBinding Mono XSP 4 address: 0.0.0.0  \n * You have an incomplete /etc/xsp4/debian.webapp  \n * To fix it, you need to install at least one package for xsp4 (like asp.net-examples)\n\nInstalling asp.net-examples simply (re-)installs mono-xsp2 and I didn't find any asp.net4-examples package.\nThus mono-xsp4 would not still run. I realized there are no applications set in /etc/xsp4/debian.webapp  (empty except <apps></apps>) and by simply copying /etc/xsp2/debian.webapp to /etc/xsp4/ I could start mono-xsp4 (however, of course, there are no asp4 examples installed)\nBack to monodevelop: In monodevelop I set the ip and port correctly to the ip and port mono-xsp4 is using but still xsp4 is not found. Whether mono-xsp4 is already running or I stopped it so monodevelop can start it itself, I always get the error message above.\nCan somebody help me out? Is this a bug of monodevelop 4.1.7 (I need version v4 otherwise the VS2012 solution won't open correctly) or is something wrong with my mono-xsp4 install?\nI would love to use the lastest monodevelop v4 stable version but I didn't find any ubuntu 13.04 repository for it.\n\nA: I can answer my own question:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~keks9n/+archive/monodevelop-latest\ngives the answer:\n\nIf you want to debug ASP.NET applications make sure that you are using\n  your system Mono runtime ( http://i.imgur.com/SO93KJ2.png ).

advance.\n\nA: Searching for info on similar errors, probably too late to help but maybe useful for others?\nI just tried making a new encfs directory, added a dozen files, moved and deleted a couple files, then unmounted. And on re-mounting it then I got similar errors to some of yours:\nThere's always the (DirNode.cpp:132) error decoding filename: .encfs6.xml where it tries to decode the config .encfs6.xml file, and then it listed a few getattr error No such file or directory errors for files that just weren't there. I don't know why but I suspect it's got something to do with the filename encryption, causing it to look for files that aren't there anymore? Maybe you've got some programs trying to read the files that are supposed to be there & generating errors?\nYou've also got several (FileNode.cpp:127) calling setIV on (null) errors at the start, I didn't try the external IV chaining so maybe it's normal?\nfyi- Also when trying to access (ex. cat) a file that doesn't exist in the un-encrypted directory it will give an \"getattr error No such file or directory\" with an encrypted filename that's apparently created on-the-fly, and then afterwards checked for an existing file to decrypt. I suppose it's more secure that way, where the alternative would be keeping a decrypted list of all files in ram.\nAnyway, here's what I'd try: \n\n\n*\n\n*Stop syncing with your phone in case your phone's backup is still good & your desktop files have become corrupted. Or maybe the syncing is what corrupted them. And make a backup copy of the Desktop's files in case they're good & it's encfs that's the problem & something you try messes them up. Only work on copies of files, good data recovery practice \"just in case\".\n\n*Try a fsck on your drive in case it's going bad, maybe even a reboot (works for windoze, couldn't hurt?)\n\n*Manually create the directory \"/home/sri/Documents/OfficeData\" just in case something went wrong there, log had \"...does not exist. Should it be created? (y,n)\"\n\n*Try using a backup copy of the .encfs6.xml file & see if it works. I'd try the phone's backup first, and if not then a known good copy from a separate non-sync'd \"frozen\" backup.\n\n*If still bad, try a full backup copy & see if it works. If yes, then can try  copying the files changed since the backup, one at a time, and see if they can now be read. The file attributes look the same on the encrypted files and the decrypted files (at least in my files)\n\n*If nothing's worked, try un-install & re-install of encfs itself, or look for an updated version of encfs to try. Speaking of which maybe your system updated encfs and now the newer version can't decrypt your files... Or try from a live disk of ubuntu, a live disk from a different computer even if the files are worth the effort?\n\n\nFor the future, I'd keep frequent known good backups somewhere too, not only sync'd since it could sync corruption & get ruined. Maybe unencrypted or saved with a different encryption, like a tarball | gpg -c ? Data recovery & encryption are usually at odds with each other.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Phone OS 1.0 makes my Galaxy Nexus a lame duck I am testing Ubuntu Phone OS since 2 months. In this time the speed and reaction of Phone OS increased by every update. Yesterday I made an update to 1.0 via phablet-flash ubuntu-system --no-backup . Now I have a phone OS that is incredible slow. Is this problem known? Are there any options to solve this speed problem? Looking for some answers. Thanks a lot.\n\nA: Yes, it is a known problem:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/mir/+bug/1182930\nUnfortunately the Galaxy Nexus is starting to show its age, so certain operations that can run efficiently on newer hardware are problematic on the it.  Things may improve, but I don't know if there is a concrete time line.\nAs a temporary solution, you could try disabling Mir on the phone by deleting the file /home/phablet/.display-mir and rebooting, which will switch back to the Surface Flinger display server.

Should be it working or is it not? After reading a couple of other forums that relates to this question, they say to use a 700MB CD which I am but again is not working. Another question is that the reason for this is because I have a School Desktop which I use and the OS seems to have crashed and that OS files seem to be missing so this looks like an option at the moment. So basically, Can't burn it on a CD (says its too small) and trying to rework a partial dead computer...\n\nA: 12.04.03 is 708MB in size. \nIt only fits on a 800MB CD, but they are rare (at least in my country). \nYour best bet is to burn it on a DVD or put the installer on an USB drive, if your PC ist capable of booting from usb.\n\nA: \n*Get a 4gb usb\n\n*Download the iso of the Ubuntu \n\n*Download Universal USB Installer(If you are using windows to make bootable usb)\n\n*Make bootable usb \n\n*Use that on system where you want to install the Ubuntu\nDone\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu 13.10 work on a Toshiba NB305 NB-305 Netbook?

A temporary solution is to type the following command in the terminal:\nsudo killall tor\n\nRestart Vidalia and it should work with tor like a charm. But the real problem is that every time you want to use tor with Vidalia, you will need to input that command in the terminal...\nThe Problem with tor and Vidalia\nUpon installation, tor will automatically start-up when booting Ubuntu. When you open Vidalia, it will first check if there is an existing tor process and try to connect to the control port of tor. All we need to do is reconfigure tor so it allows Vidalia to connect and start using the tor process.\nHow to solve and fix error message: Vidalia detected that the tor software exited unexpectedly. Please check the message log for recent warning or error messages.\nFirst step: is to open the configuration file of tor. Open a terminal and input this command:\nsudo gedit /etc/tor/torrc\n\nAfter the file opens, scroll down to line 53 to line 60 and you will see something like this:\n ## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor ## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.\n #ControlPort 9051 ## If you enable the controlport, be sure to enable one of these ## authentication methods, to prevent attackers from\n accessing it. #HashedControlPassword\n 16:872860B76453A77D60CA2BB8C1A7042072093276A3D701AD684053EC4C\n #CookieAuthentication 1\n\nSecond Step: Remove # from #ControlPort 9051 so line 55 looks like this:\nControlPort 9051\n\nThen enable password authentication by removing # from #HashedControlPassword so line 58 looks like this:\nHashedControlPassword\n\nThird Step: Input the following command into the terminal to create a password for tor, but where it says, “mypassword,” replace that with a password of your choosing:\ntor --hash-password mypassword\n\nThe terminal will respond with a hash that looks like this:\n16:816172DEB125A9CA603A6A8A5C16D0642DA4556E4EC417E6B9AAC9AF0D\n\nCopy this entire hash string, and then replace the defauld value on line 58.\nThis is how our torrec file looked like when we finished configuring it:\n## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor ## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt. ControlPort 9051 ## If you enable the controlport, be sure to enable one of these ## authentication methods, to prevent attackers from accessing it. #HashedControlPassword 16:816172DEB125A9CA603A6A8A5C16D0642DA4556E4EC417E6B9AAC9AF0D #CookieAuthentication 1\n\nFourth Step: Save the torrc file: ctrl + s and close it. Then restart tor by inputing this to a terminal:\nsudo /etc/init.d/tor restart\n\nThat's it! Open Vidalia and it should now be able to start and stop tor without a problem.\nNote: If Vidalia gives you an error with failing to authenticate with tor, just exit vidalia and re-open it.\nsource \n", "Q: Black screen macbook pro 7.1 / Ubuntu 13.10 Ubuntu 13.10 installed ok on my macbook pro 7.1.\nBy default it was using the opensource video driver which just about worked (I could log into unity), but froze after about 5 minutes of use each time.\nAfter trying to install the various proprietary nvidia drivers I get a black screen after reboot:\n\n\n*\n\n*refited screen: ok\n\n*grub menu: ok\n\n*ubuntu logo appears on screen: ok\n\n*black screen: not ok\n\n\nA: I'm guessing you installed Ubuntu in EFI-boot mode?

I'm using Rockbox on my iPod Classic 80 GB. I'm interested in what applications are available for Ubuntu to manage my Rockbox media library.\nCan you describe what features each application has? For example: music synchronization, podcast support, video encoding to MPEG, easy GUI...\nPlease limit your answers to 1 application per answer.\n\nA: You can use any program to manage your media for Rockbox because rockbox creates it's own database that's independent of the actual directory structure, so any utility that can somehow sync it's Music to a flashdrive works with rockbox (you could even sync your library with rsync or unison).\nBanshee (http://banshee.fm) is a nice, but sometimes unstable and buggy, music manager with nice UI and features like maintaining a directory structure based on the metadata of the music, managing podcasts, plugins for LastFM, Amazon etc. Managing Videos. Banshee even has special rockbox support (rockbox is detected via the .rockbox directory) but this only works if you delete the directories created by apple (ipod_control etc) otherwise it will be detected as iPod. When using banshee keep in mind that it can't embed Covers into music files but stores the covers in ~/.share/media-art\nOther nice programs are Rhythmbox and Guayadeque. Rhythmbox has many of the same features as Banshee with a clean UI and Guayadeque is much less user friendly but has many nice features, of which the custom copy feature is the most interesting for Rockbox because you can specify in what directory structure you want music to be copied.\nBut see for yourself, you can easily manage the same directory of music with all three applications at the same time, so don't be afraid to try out all three.\n", "Q: How to avoid typing 'python' when running .py scripts?

Then you can run it by just typing the name. That is because usr/local/bin is a directory that Python check for executables.\nThats the extent of my knowledge.

When using (K)ubuntu 13.04, my network printer worked fine. After upgrading to (K)ubuntu 13.10 today, I can no longer print. I get the error \"The printer is not responding.\"\nI've tried to add the printer again, and it is automatically recognised. I can add it, and select it from print dialogue boxes, but I get the same error.\nBrother HL-2040, Kubuntu 13.10 (KDE 4.11.2)\n==EDIT==\nI attempted connecting the printer directly with a USB cable, and this worked fine, so it's not a problem with drivers.

Further, it prints fine over the network from my wife's MacBook.\n==EDIT 2==\nI've tried another printer over a different network, and that works fine. The one that doesn't work is connected over an Apple Airport Extreme. (Although, as stated above, it used to work fine.)\n\nA: Thanks to helpful information from the KDE forums, it seems that Avahi/Bonjour isn't working properly. Presumably this is a regression introduced recently, although I only seem to have problems with the printer connected to the Airport Extreme.\nHence, use the IP address of the printer as specified here. i.e. add the printer as socket://[ip address of Airport Extreme]:9100. Fortunately for me I already had my Airport Extreme set up with a static IP, but it'd be annoying otherwise. Also, I've no idea how you'd configure it if you had two printers connected to the router.\n\nA: I don't know if it's pertinent, but my network printer stopped working after the upgrade to Kubuntu 13.10 as well.

I've decided that i want to take everything over to Ubuntu and don't mind learning new programming languages (in fact i'm looking forward to it) But i don't want to change what i do in regards to how i approach a new project.\nCurrently i use a CMS to host my sites and then i build console applications to do back end stuff e.g. My current site uses a C# application to data mine a website where i use that information to remain competitive with my affiliate marketing.\nSo what would be a good language(s) to learn in order to migrate successfully to Ubuntu with the least amount of downtime.\nMy understanding is that i would need to learn PHP for the CMS Websites and Python for the terminal programs. But someone has mentioned i can use Python for both.\nAny ideas?\nMany thanks\nSean\n\nA: If you have web applications developed with ASP.Net the easiest way to migrate to Ubuntu is to simply deploy them with ModMono. Mono in general supports most what you do with C# on Windows. Before learning a new language I'd try that route.\nOtherwise I'd advise you to go on with Java + Eclipse, thus sticking to high level OO languages.\n\nA: If you are a good C# developer you should find using PHP or Python pretty easy to get to grips with (I moved from .net to the Linux-based open source world 8 months ago).\nPHP is not a good language, but its popular and with programming experience you should not fall into the many pitfalls of PHP. Use a good framework ASAP, Cake, Sympfony, Yii or Zend for example will help with a more pleasurable PHP development experience.\nIn the circles I frequent the default CMS seems to be Wordpress and for things too complex for Wordpres, Drupal, but I personally prefer to roll my own with a framework.\nFor Python you can write for the web, Django is a popular framework.\nAlso, Ruby on Rail IMHO is worth a good look and is a nice framework/stack for web development.\nOne big change that you will need to do is to get away from the IDE mentality. Learn how to install and configure from the command line and use a text editor (I like Geany with is like a lightweight IDE), not needing to run a debugger.\n", "Q: What is preferable way to upgrade system? There are (at minimum) two ways to upgrade Ubuntu. \n\n\n*\n\n*Using Update Manager.\n\n*Using apt-get upgrade (sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade) in a terminal.\nAre those two ways equal or is one of them preferable?\n\nA: They are not equal. apt-get upgrade doesn't upgrade releases at all, it just upgrades packages in the current release sources.\nThe Update Manager is the GUI frontend to apt-get, and the command line equivalent for that would be do-release-upgrade (without sudo). These two would be more or less  equivalent.\nIf do-release-upgrade reports No new release found, check that in Software & Update, the setting \"Notify me of a new Ubuntu version\" is set to \"any version\".\n\nA: We have a common mis-understanding of what 'upgrade' and 'dist-upgrade' mean for apt-get.\nIn summary: neither one upgrades Ubuntu (or Debian) releases. But they are different. Usually, the best option is to use dist-upgrade. Unless there is a technical reason, always do a dist-upgrade.\nFrom the man page:\nupgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages\n           currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in\n           /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new\n           versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no\n           circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages\n           not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of\n           currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without\n           changing the install status of another package will be left at\n           their current version. An update must be performed first so that\n           apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.\ndist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade,\n           also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions\n           of packages; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and\n           it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the\n           expense of less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade\n           command may therefore remove some packages. The\n           /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which\n           to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for\n           a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual\n           packages.\n\nA: They are equal, but you may find the terminal method more convenient since you don't have to navigate through GUIs.\n", "Q: I can't navigate in the 3D view of modo 701 in Ubuntu 13.04.

Otherwise, you can momentarily take a look at the \"fast way\" below.\n\n*\n\n*Open your eclipse.desktop file:\n sudo -H gedit /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop\n\n(If you can't find it in this path, try in ~/.local/share/applications/eclipse.desktop. Otherwise, you could have to find yours using locate command).\n\n\n*Replace the Exec= line with this:\n Exec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= eclipse\n\nWhere \"eclipse\" is the path to your eclipse executable. In this case it's just \"eclipse\" since there's a symlink in /usr/bin folder.\nNOTE: If you can't find your eclipse.desktop file, you can simply create one from scratch in the above path, and fill it with these lines:\n    [Desktop Entry] \n    Type=Application \n    Name=Eclipse \n    Icon=eclipse \n    Exec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= eclipse \n    Terminal=false \n    Categories=Development;IDE;Java;\n\n\n\n*Save the file.\n\nNow you can run Eclipse from its icon as usual.\n(Fast but repetitive way)\nIf you haven't got any eclipse.desktop file and you don't want to create it at the moment, you can simply run Eclipse with this command:\nUBUNTU_MENUPROXY= eclipse\n\nwhere \"eclipse\" is the path to your eclipse executable. Note that this is just the fast way to run Eclipse once. If you don't want to remember this command and use it every time you have to run Eclipse, follow the \"stable way\" above.\nOr you can make an alias out of it\nalias eclipse = 'UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= eclipse'\n\nand the command eclipse will work fine.\n\nSources:\n\n*\n\n*Keenformatics - How To show Eclipse menu in Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy Salamander (my blog)\n\n*Ubuntu documentation - EnvironmentVariables\n\n*Eclipse menus doesn't show up in Saucy\n\nA: In my case there were two versions of the file in /usr/share/applications:\neclipse.desktop\nEclipse.desktop\n\nEither delete one of them, or change the Exec line in both of them as described above.\nThe third version of the file is in the home folder:\n~/.local/share/applications/Eclipse.desktop\n\nYou can either delete this last one or change the Exec line in this one too.\nAll you have to do is change the Exec line as follows:\nExec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= /path/to/eclipse/eclipse\n\n\nA: You need to edit a file called eclipse.desktop to include the MENUPROXY option.\n\n\n*\n\n*Depending on your install, this location will vary. To find it, type sudo find / -name eclipse.desktop.\n\n*Once you find the location, open up the file in your favorite editor. For me, this is vim, so I type sudo vim /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop (Note that your location may be different, see the first step.\n\n*When in the file, look for a line that looks something like this-> Exec=/opt/eclipse/eclipse. (Note that yours may just have the \"eclipse\" in there without the full path).\n\n*After finding that line, comment it out. Then add this line: Exec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= /opt/eclipse/eclipse (Edit as needed. If your install did not have the full path, or if it had a different path, adjust here). Note the space after MENUPROXY= .

Use the -f option to match against the complete command line, /proc/pid/cmdline.\n\nThe reason is that process names are limited to 16 bytes including the NULL termination byte. From the prctl manpage:\n\nPR_SET_NAME (since Linux 2.6.9)\nSet the name of the calling thread, using the value in the location pointed to by (char *) arg2. The name can be up to 16 bytes long, including the terminating null byte. (If the length of the string, including the terminating null byte, exceeds 16 bytes, the string is silently truncated.)\n\nSee What is the maximum allowed limit on the length of a process name?\n\nA: I think it's not a limit on the pattern length in pgrep itself, but a limit on the length of the comm (command) field in the /proc/[pid]/stat files (which is where the information in ps comes from).\nAccording to man proc, the definitions for /proc/[pid]/stat come from /usr/src/linux/fs/proc/array.c so you would need to look there for a definitive answer.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 freezing on splash screen (boot screen) after upgrade from 13.04 I just updated my ubuntu 13.04 to 13.10 using the built in update software.

In short, will I be forced to upgrade one day to use the latest kernels?\nDowngrading seems extremely difficult, and I'm not able to set aside the time for a backup and reinstall.\n\nA: At some point in the distant future, possibly, but practically no, you can track the latest mainline kernel.  You might try upgrading again though now that 13.10 is final since 13.04 will only be supported for 3 more months, and after that, you don't want to keep running it without getting security fixes.\n", "Q: After removing Ubuntu Builder there is still folder in home directory. Why? How to remove it? I removed Ubuntu Builder using Synaptic with option Mark for Complete Removal. I thought that gonna delete folder (made by Ubuntu Builder) in home dir, but it's not.\nAFAIK Mark for Complete Removal is same as Purging, and that should delete all files made by program. Am I wrong?\nIs it safe to delete it with sudo rm -r /home/ubuntu-builder because it is in home dir?\nAnd last question. Why is it made folder in /home instead in ~/ dir?\n\nA: Ubuntu builder creates it's own user account to build the new Ubuntu image in. The folder you're seeing is the home folder from this user.\nMy guess as to why it's still there is that Ubuntu Builder probably creates this user on runtime (when it's launched) and not when it's installed.\nYou can remove it by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal, then entering this command:\nsudo rm -r /home/ubuntu-builder\n\n", "Q: Why did 13.10 break my custom keyboard layout?

I've used click install and click register to install a click app on Ubuntu (not Ubuntu Touch).

Is there some tool that shows where a given .desktop file is, or is there a way to see the equivalent to $PATH for .desktop files?\nNote: this is similar to, but not a duplicate of, How to find the .desktop files for pinned applications in the Unity launcher?\n\nA: I figured out how to find the path of a .desktop file based off of this answer, which is similar but not quite what I wanted.\nFirst, pin the app in question to the Launcher. Then, run the following command:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites\n\nIn my case, the output was: \n['application://nautilus.desktop', 'application://firefox.desktop', 'application://thunderbird.desktop', 'application://chromium-browser.desktop', 'application://libreoffice-writer.desktop', 'application://libreoffice-calc.desktop', 'application://ubuntusdk.desktop', 'application://gnome-terminal.desktop', 'application://gedit.desktop', 'application://com.ubuntu.developer.mdspencer.ubuntu-tasks_ubuntu-tasks_0.5.1.desktop', 'application://xchat.desktop', 'unity://running-apps', 'unity://expo-icon', 'unity://devices']\n\nSo the name of the .desktop file is:\ncom.ubuntu.developer.mdspencer.ubuntu-tasks_ubuntu-tasks_0.5.1.desktop\n\nWhich shows what my problem is.

Why is this there? How can I remove (if it's unnecessary)?\nThanks in advance for an answer!\n\nA: EDIT: in this particular instance it may be a bug - see \"Light Display Manager\" is offered as login option. The suggested workaround is to add the lightdm account to the list of hidden-users explicitly by editing your /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file i.e.\n[UserAccounts]\nminimum-uid=500\nhidden-users=nobody nobody4 noaccess lightdm\nhidden-shells=/bin/false /usr/sbin/nologin\n\nThe lightdm display manager decides whether to display an account on the login screen based on the numerical value of the account's UID. Usually in Ubuntu regular user accounts have UID values above 1000 and 'system' accounts such as the lightdm account itself have low-number UIDs and therefore don't show up - the threshold is set by a minimum-uid value in the /etc/lightdm/users.conf file e.g.\n\n[UserAccounts]\nminimum-uid=500\n\nso if you are seeing the lightdm account on the login screen, either this value is set too low, or the lightdm account got created with an unusually high UID - you can check with the id command e.g.\nid lightdm\n\nOther *nix flavors may use different conventions for the minimum UID for regular user accounts so it's possible yours differ if the accounts were migrated or were chosen for compatibility with another system. You can see the default values for your own system by looking in the /etc/login.defs file.\n\nA: In reality there are many accounts in your system. I'll show you: execute a terminal (xterm is fine) and run cat /etc/passwd... every line is a valid account in your system.\nExecute man 5 passwd and man 5 shadow to obtain more (always useful) info.\nYou should ignore the new account created by the login manager and use your account.\nIf you are curious run sudo less /etc/shadow to see the real account lines of the modern Unix systems like Ubuntu; in this file each line is an account with a crypted password, but the file can be read only by root, so is more secure.Find the login manager account and observe the second camp: if it's \"*\" or \"!\", it's all ok, because an user can't use it (you are also an user :) ) and your PC is relatively secure.Just a note: if there is a crypted password (unreadable chars) in the new account you are warned as an intruder may have created a false account for a backdoor access, but I think this isn't the case.Good evening and have a nice experience.\n\nA: Looks like a bug in 13.10 (3.11.0-12 kernel) regardless of the minimum-uid - as stated in the referenced bug ticket, lightdm can be added to /etc/lightdm/users.conf as in:\nhidden-users=nobody nobody4 noaccess lightdm\n", "Q: No partitions recognised while installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 8 I have decided to install Ubuntu on my laptop alongside Windows 8, the OS I have currently installed and that I don't want to uninstall because I need some programs.\nI have downloaded the ISO and burned it into a CD. Everything in the installation goes well until I have to choose where to install it. It doesn't recognise my Windows 8 and it sees my disk as if it was all empty space (500 GB).\nWhat should I do to install Ubuntu?\n\nA: If the \"Something Else\" partitioning option is showing the disk as completely unpartitioned, then chances are you've run into a libparted bug that causes tools that use that library (such as the Ubuntu installer) to think the disk is empty when in fact the partition table is not to libparted's liking.

For that reason the packages have been removed in Debian sid, and that removal has trickled down to Ubuntu 13.10.\nThere is nobody working on reintroducing these packages as far as I know, though it would be great if somebody stepped up.\nIt is still possible to manually install the plugins, but some functionality will be broken (svn 1.7 which is part of 13.10 has some behaviour changes compared to earlier versions).\n % apt-get install python-subvertpy\n % mkdir -p ~/.bazaar/plugins\n % bzr branch lp:bzr-svn ~/.bazaar/plugins/svn\n % bzr branch lp:bzr-gtk ~/.bazaar/plugins/gtk \n\n", "Q: Newest version of a library newbie here: how does it work, if Ubuntu currently features a certain version of a library but there is already a newer version of it at developer's site, do I have to wait for the next major release of Ubuntu to eventually incorporate it?\nFor example, currently in Ubuntu there is libabc-1.2-dev, but the developer already release 1.3.

Ubuntu 13.10's release notes mention that it includes Linux 3.11, which supports something called zswap:\n\nZswap is a lightweight, write-behind compressed cache for swap pages. It takes pages that are in the process of being swapped out and attempts to compress them into a dynamically allocated RAM-based memory pool.

This results in a significant I/O reduction and performance gains for systems that are swapping\n\nThat sounds cool.

This should fully remove gcompris from your system.\n", "Q: Ubuntu GNOME 13.10 cannot change window border theme I installed Ubuntu Gnome 13.10 and when I change GTK theme using Gnome Tweak Tool, only theme of widgets changes, theme of Window border remains same.\nCan somebody help me to fix this issue ?\n\nA: To change to theme Adwaita, open a terminal and do:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme Adwaita\n\nSource: How can you change the GTK Theme and Window Decorations separately in Unity?\n\nA: I found solution to this problem here: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=167309\nSee post #10.\n\nA: Thanks to the solution linked by user62716: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=167309, let me type it out here.\ncd /usr/share/pyshared/gtweak/\nsudo gedit gsettings.py\n\nInsert this before line 37:\nif schema_name == \"org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences\":\n    schema_filename = schema_name + \".gschema.xml\"\n\nNow it should look like: \ndef __init__(self, schema_name, schema_dir=None, schema_filename=None, **options):\n    if not schema_dir:\n        schema_dir = gtweak.GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR\n    if schema_name == \"org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences\":\n        schema_filename = schema_name + \".gschema.xml\"\n    if not schema_filename:\n        schema_filename = schema_name + \".gschema.xml\"\n\nSave, and exit.

Any info would be great!\n\nA: If the ASUS Eee PC 1000HA is the same one I have, then it requires the 32-bit version. Not so sure, but for a netbook, typically just download the 32-bit ISO and perform a clean install after backing up the data.

I don't need any user input in the application, I'd just like at least one monitor to not switch off after a while when my computer is locked.\nHas anyone done something similar? Or am I better off running a dashboard on a separate computer?\n\nA: I haven't tried it myself, but you could  probably have a background service which would periodically output an image (jpg, png, etc) which you could then set as the lock screen wallpaper.  The service would just overwrite the image to update the screen.\nGranted, it's untested and there's the chance that the lockscreen won't refresh when the image changes.  Also, it doesn't answer the question of keeping the monitors from sleeping (I'm looking for that answer as well, which is how I found your question).\n", "Q: Unable to change brightness with ubuntu 13.10 on ASUS 453t series (It worked with Ubuntu 13.04) The brightness icon is shown but nothing happens.\nEven if I try to change the brightness in \"System Settings\" nothing happens.\nThe thing is it didn't happen with Ubuntu 13.04, so I would like to know how to solve it or how to erase the upgrade to use the 13.04 version.\n\nA: Got the workaround for this \nEdit the file /etc/default/grub.

Can I simply remove it in Ubuntu Software Centre? I like my Laptop clean and having unmessy software that I never use. \nI normally use Chromium Browser to do all the stuff, I think I am heavy user of Google, and love the simplicity of Ubuntu. Lol! Can anyone tell or guide me? Thanks! \n\nA: Yes, you can \"safely\" uninstall any of the default programs that are shipped with Ubuntu - and it is easily done using the Ubuntu Software Center as you already suggested.\nHowever, in my opinion it is a good idea to have a default application for the most basic tasks required on your computer, just in case your Google services cannot do anything for you online. If you go to System Settings > Details > Default Applications you can see the programs Ubuntu will open to do the most simple tasks on your computer. In case you don't like the programs shipped with Ubuntu you can do any replacement you like here.\n\nA: Yes all aforementioned apps can be removed easily through USC or CLI. \nConsider that some of mentioned apps you want to remove may be dependent on shared supporting files with different other apps.\nI personally never remove any default app since you run a risk of damaging the system. Risk is bigger with some applications and lower with others, of course with some apps there is no risk at all, however I believe it is best to avoid the risk.\nUbuntu doesn't have pollution like win powered systems and unused apps do not make any difference on performance if not uninstalled.\n\nA: As other users already mentioned, the pre-installed applications like the one that you have mentioned are easy to uninstall.\nHave in mind that whenever you want to uninstall any application, if this is just a utility for the user and no other software depends upon this, then you wont have any issue removing it from the system.\nSo the question that you have to ask your self is: Does this application is useful directly or indirectly? Then you choice :)\n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but it may benefit others who see this, I would recommend that you make an Ubuntu install to a flash drive (Not a Live Installer, an actual install) and try deleting different programs on that to see if they effect any other parts of the system. This way, you have a harmless way to find out what can be easily removed.\n", "Q: Compiz / Unity permission problem?

With the 12.04 version I have plenty of extensions for filing the images that I do on gimp and can upload them to facebook. I noticed that the 13.10 version has only a few extensions for saving a file from gimp. \nWhich extension should I use to save a file that facebook will accept in this 13.10 version?\n\nA: When you go to the \"Save as\" the formats available are kinds that keeps all of your work in progress inside GIMP, such as layers, transparency and such settings.\nIf you want to share your work on Facebook you have to export your image as a bitmap-type of file. Go to \"Files\" > \"Export\" and you will have plenty of formats to choose from that will allow you to upload it to Facebook and other services, such as .png and .jpeg.\n\nA: I don't know if this was different before, but you need to export your picture, not save it.  \nOpen File -> Export \n \nand from there you can select from a range of file formats including .png and .jpg to save your file as:  \n\n", "Q: Files: Name column basically useless in list view.

And it is even not possible to change the column size manually.\nFunnily, in some situations it quickly flickers from a larger column width to the small one back and forth before settling on the small size.\nUnnecessarily to say, it is extremely annoying.\nIs there a way around this or is this just \"bad design\"?\nOh yeah, Ubuntu 13.04 & 13.10, Files version 3.8.2.\n\nA: Since the default file manager does not seem to support what I want, I looked into alternative file managers and installed Nemo (note that this is more difficult at the moment, see below). It is similar enough while having many more features and not displaying the above mentioned annoying issue (at least for version 1.x, see below).\nAlternatively, PCManFM seems to actually not have this issue.

It does not have an as beautiful the UI though (but still good enough).\n\nInstalling Nemo on Ubuntu 13.10 is not as easy. There exists a PPA which provides a seemingly compatible version of Nemo 2.0 for Saucy Salamander (ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable). It worked fine at first, being more useful than the default Nautilus, although still having this issue but only with even narrower windows. However, this will also install Cinnamon 2.0. And this currently breaks Unity in 13.10. I experienced that after a restart, where I was not able to login before removing all cinnamon/nemo packages first. So beware!\nThe otherwise official repo at https://launchpad.net/~noobslab/+archive/nemo provides Nemo (version 1.x, currently 1.7.4) for Ubuntu. As of now there is no version for saucy, however. But I was able to install the version for raring by downloading the deb packages for:\n\n\n*\n\n*gir1.2-nemo-3.0\n\n*libnemo-extension1\n\n*nemo-data\n\n*nemo\n\n\nAll but the actual nemo package installs fine. Nemo has a dependency on libgnome-desktop-3-4 but Ubuntu 13.10 has libgnome-desktop-3-7. So what I did was extract the deb package, modify the DEBIAN/control file, repackage it and install it. As a last step I had to link the dynamic library for 3-7 to 3-4 because Nemo expects this library.\n# extract the raring package\nmkdir nemo\ncd nemo\ndpkg-deb -x ../nemo.deb .\ndpkg-deb -e ../nemo.deb\n\nnano DEBIAN/control\n# modify libgnome-desktop dependency from 3-4 to 3-7\n# repackage\ndpkg-deb -b . ../nemo~saucy.deb\n\n# link the libraries\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/libgnome-desktop-3.so.7 /usr/lib/libgnome-desktop-3.so.4\n\n# install nemo~saucy.deb\n\n\nA: Collapse the sidebar on the left, or drag the name column to be leftmost, or both.\n\nA: When the file manager is your active window. Go to Files > Preferences. Here you will find a \"List Columns\" and you can check or uncheck the columns that you actually need. In this way you can make a workaround of your problem.\nFor your specific problem: An idea would be to uncheck the owner (as in your screenshot you are the owner of all the files anyway, so whats the point of displayed this) and maybe also the MIME-type (this information is usually represented by the icon anyway)\nYes, one might consider it bad design that you can't set a specific width for some of the columns.\nAs a sidenote. Instead of going to Files > Preferences. While being in List-view you can also just click the \"down arrow\" next to the list/grid-icons inside the file manager and choose \"Visible columns\".\n\nA: I have found a way to install easily nemo, without dependency, at this URL: http://www.lffl.org/2013/10/nemo-file-manager-ubuntu-linux-dipendenze-cinnamon.html.\nIt is written in italian, the heart of the process is:\nTo install Nemo in Ubuntu 14.04, 13.10, 13.04, 12.10 e 12.04 you can write in a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/nemo\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nemo nemo-fileroller dconf-tools**\n\nfor setting Nemo as default file manager in Ubuntu you have to write:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\n\nto have the same icons and links as Nautilus it is enough write:\ngsettings set org.nemo.desktop show-desktop-icons false\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons true\nxdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory application/x-gnome-saved-search**\n\nif you need more info, ask me\n\nA: on menu bar go to view then visible columns. try to uncheck some column that are not very useful like MIME-type, and you can leave name,size and type only.\nthis problem i think is caused by long display name(you can see on your MIME-type column). But hope they will fix this problem of not be able to resize columns or moving\n", "Q: Does cinnamon 2.0 really break your 13.10 desktop? I was reading an article that warns not to use cinnamon 2.0 on ubuntu 13.10 or it will break. Is this true? This is the article. \nhttp://news.softpedia.com/news/Cinnamon-2-0-Corrupts-Unity-on-Ubuntu-13-10-390736.shtml\n\nA: \nUpdate 7. december 2013: This happened just at the release of 13.10, but it is reported that this shouldn't cause issues any more.\n\nYes, this is true, it happened to me as well. I couldn't login to the Unity session after upgrading to 13.10 and had to uninstall Cinnamon to get it working. It seems like this is the solution for everyone having a similar problem.\nMy knowledge is limited and I can't tell you the exact reason why this is happening :) But your link already gives a possible reason for the problem - a common gnome package.\n\nA: From what I can tell, Cinnamon 2.0 still uses some parts of Gnome 3 that are different from the ones that Unity expects so you can only have one or the other working until Cinnamon totally removes all Gnome references from it. I prefer Cinnamon over Unity by far so installed Xbuntu to be sure I don't start with rogue Gnome parts installed and put Cinnamon on it as my desktop to try it out.\nOn a fresh install I just did, the files I think are in conflict are:\ngnome-session-common 3.9.90\ngnome-session 3.9.90\ng-system-monitor 3.8.2\ng-terminal-data 3.6.1\ng-terminal 3.6.1\ngnome-session-fallback 3.6.2\n\nI am pretty sure Unity needs other versions to run. Hope that helps.\n\nA: While Cinnamon team is working to fix the issue, here is the quick way to fix it. Open a terminal and use the following command:\nsudo rm -f /usr/share/upstart/sessions/cinnamon-se*\n\nThis will remove the Cinnamon files from the upstart session. The trick is suggested by Michael Webster of Cinnamon dev team.\n\nA: The problem only occures with Cinnamon 2.0 from an additional repository. I recommend to uninstall Cinnamon by simply using sudo apt-get remove .*cinnamon.* and sudo apt-get remove .*nemo.*\nThe repository probably was disabled automatically during Ubuntu upgrade, but it might be good to check this or remove it: http://ppa.launchpad.net/gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable/ubuntu\nNow reinstall Cinnamon and Nemo simply trough the Ubuntu repositories. You can use apt-get, Synaptic or even the Software Center.\nWith Ubuntu 13.10 Cinnamon and Nemo are easy to choose for all Ubuntu users! :) Though instead of version 2.0 you will get 1.8.4 (as of today)\n\nA: Actually the situation seems to be slightly better than \"you have to remove Cinnamon\", at least with its more recent releases. I had the same issue because of Nemo which I prefer over standard Ubuntu file manager. So I uninstalled Cinnamon completely (via Synaptic, but the method does not matter really), logged into Unity which was working, and then installed Cinnamon again.\nAfter this procedure, Unity (currently 7.1.2 version) is working quite normally as far as I can tell alongside cinnamon-2.0.12 and nemo-2.0.6 (at this moment). The only glitch is that it is not able to display any desktop background, be it plain colour or a photo.\n", "Q: gedit-developer-plugins on Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy Salamander I've installed gedit-developer-plugins on a fresh Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy Salamander\nI've lauched gedit (from the terminal) but when I turn a GDP plugin on (in this case GDP Find) I get the following error:\n\n(gedit:3640): libpeas-WARNING **: Could not find loader 'python' for plugin 'gdpfind'\n\nThe same error only shows while turning on GDP plugins, the others work well.\nAny solution to make this plugins work again?\n\nA: I'm afraid things may depend on the developer responsible for the plugin. But, you could first try the solution presented here: Problem With Gedit Plugins and Python3 on 13.04.\nI updated to Lubuntu 13.10 and installed the gedit version available in the software center (v 3.8.3). Then I tried to install doublesave and markdown-preview both of which worked for me in Lubuntu 13.04. I ran into the same problem as you and changing Loader= as suggested in the first link didn't help me.\nI did an internet search and concluded that the issue maybe something that the individual plugin developer has to modify unless the Loader= fix works for you.\n\nA: It seams that the old plugin (0.5.15) use the python provided by old gedit (3.6)\nit's possible to get the stable plugins (1.1.0) that with with gedit (3.8.3) in saucy at\nhttps://launchpad.net/~sinzui/+archive/ppa\nJust run:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:sinzui/ppa\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install gedit-developer-plugins\n\nAnd then you can turn the GDP plugins on. \nEDIT for UBUNTU 14.04\nTo enable GDP Format plugin you must install python-pocket-lint, just run:\nsudo apt-get install python-pocket-lint\n\nIf you are in a hurry, just do everything in one command:\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:sinzui/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install gedit-developer-plugins python-pocket-lint\n\n", "Q: gnome panel items testing out gnome to see if it may be better for me.

Is there any regression in the kernel? A live 13.04 doesn't show this problem. Also filed bug #1241897.\n\nA: The only workaround is to use an older kernel from raring. I'm using 3.8.0-32 and it works like a charm.\nThe real solution would be for someone to look into bug #12341897 and fix the regression.\n\nA: I had also this kind of problem. I was able to solve it partially by unloading and loading the wifi kernel module. In my case the rtl8192se.\nThe commands I used were:\nmodprobe -r rtl8192se\nmodprobe rtl8192se\n\nIn your case of a \"88E8001 Gigabit Ethernet Controller\" it's the driver skge.\nmodprobe -r skge\nmodprobe skge\n\n", "Q: Stuck at \"Installation Type\" screen while installing I'm installing Ubuntu from a USB, onto a computer running Windows 7.

From the Ubuntu website screenshots, this should be pretty straightforward!\nWhat do I need to do to get Ubuntu installed?\n\nA: My 13.10 install got stuck at a previous screen, asking if i wanted to replace windows, do something else, etc. The 'continue' button wouldn't enable.  I clicked back, then next, and it cleared the problem.  you probably already tried that?\n\nA: Make sure your disk is readable.  In my case AHCI was not set in the bios.\nYou can boot the usb in Try Ubuntu mode, then run terminal.  Next try fdisk -1 or parted -l.  \nIf your harddrive isn't in the list then make sure its bios settings are correct.\n\nA: Make sure you do not have a bootguard, e.g., Symantec PGP, as it does not allow dual boot and you may end up losing your data. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10, kernel 3.11 blank screen issue with hybrid graphics On my HP Envy, which has both an Intel on-chip graphics card and an Nvidia Geforce:\n*-display UNCLAIMED     \n   description: 3D controller\n   product: GK208M [GeForce GT 740M]\n   vendor: NVIDIA Corporation\n   physical id: 0\n   bus info: pci@0000:01:00.0\n   version: a1\n   width: 64 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: cap_list\n   configuration: latency=0\n   resources: memory:d2000000-d2ffffff memory:a0000000-afffffff  memory:b0000000-b1ffffff ioport:5000(size=128) memory:b2000000-b207ffff\n*-display\n   description: VGA compatible controller\n   product: 4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller\n   vendor: Intel Corporation\n   physical id: 2\n   bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\n   version: 06\n   width: 64 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n   configuration: driver=i915 latency=0\n   resources: irq:46 memory:d3000000-d33fffff memory:c0000000-cfffffff ioport:6000(size=64)\n\nI have trouble with all newer kernels. I basically had to install 12.04 LTS and use their 3.5 kernel family to get the system to boot. The 3.8 from 12.10 or the newest 3.11 from Ubuntu 13.10 leave me with a black screen upon boot. On one occasion I did hear the \"log in\" sound, but the screen did not display anything. I have purged all nvidia drivers so I guess it should just use the intel drivers, but apparently this is all messed up with newer kernel versions.\nThis is different from the other \"nvidia boots into blank screen\" bug in that I don't rely solely on an nvidia card. Surely the intel on-chip card should be supported and leave me with something different from a blank screen?\nAgain, it only works with kernel versions 3.5.0-41-generic, not with the 3.11.0-12 one that ships with Ubuntu 13.10.\nWhen I go into the grub menu and change the boot options from 'quiet splash' to 'nomodeset' I am able to boot the system, but then I don't get any graphics and trying 'sudo service lightdm start' doesn't succeed (I get 100% CPU for apport, but this doesn't do anything either, so I kill it).\nHelp, I'm all out of ideas.\nEDIT: Let me add that I'm using the EFI boot system and have a dual-boot installation with Windows 8. \n\nA: Turns out that everything was more or less fine, just that the screen brightness upon boot was set to 0. I have no idea why this change in behaviour coincides with going to a newer kernel, but at least now everything works when I just increase the screen brightness. \nNext step: Figure out how to make it boot with full brightness.\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem on the same PC and also figure it out that increasing screen brightness showed up login screen.\nDid you manage to change screen brigthness != 0 at start up?\nConcerning the graphics card, do you manage to change between intel/nvidia?\nThank you\n\nA: Uninstall all previous drivers you have and do the following:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-319 nvidia-settings-319 nvidia-prime\n\nThen go to nvidia drivers setting page and set intel gpu for daily use.\nPS: The prime package is for Hybrid systems, this will work perfect for you, if you find any updated driver please tell me and I will change the 319 for the newest version, thank you.\n", "Q: Where can I get ubuntu in german I am German.

Is there some documentation on how to do that?\n\nA: It is entirely possible, QML is the language used to define an interface and how it reacts to certain things, JavaScript is used to extend this slightly, giving you the tools to write some pretty cool things, but to harness the full power or Ubuntu you will NEED to write C++\nHere is a helpful link \nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=41078787\nI haven't really found any real, usable documentation as yet, remember the touch platform is still rather young. \n", "Q: Flash Drives Installer? I know I used to be able to install Ubuntu on a flash drive, then install it on a hard drive, using the flash, instead of a CD. Its been a few years since I've had to install from a flash drive, so I'm wondering, is it still possible, and if so, how? Also any information on dual-boot with Windows 7 64bit would be appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: Yes, you still can.  And it's quite intuitive using Ubuntu's Startup Disk Creator.  Search for it in Dash.  Put your USB stick in, browse to the drive, browse to your iso, and hit Make Startup Disk.  More detailed instructions here.\n", "Q: 13.10 broke radeon HDMI audo Makes me so angry that after finally figuring out to modify grub configuration to set radeon.audio=1 13.10 update killed my audio.\nZero sound through HDMI.\nHow to fix this?\nDell Zino HD. \n\nA: Unfortunately after upgrading my Dell Studio 1535 HDMI output is not available anymore, too. It worked before, radeon.audio=1 is known to Grub and editing /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf did not fix the problem, too.\nReinstalling Pulseaudio and Alsa several times did not help although no output is muted in Alsamixer.\nBut, after selecting an older 3.8 instead of 3.11 Kernel in Grub2 I was able to get HDMI audio working again!\nAfter installing the mainline 3.11.6 kernel the HDMI output works, too.\n", "Q: Downloading a Windows driver on 13.10 How would I go about downloading a windows driver, such as WNA 3100 to Ubuntu 13.10? I was unaware that I would be unable to use my wireless card upon installing it onto my computer before I had done so already.\n\nA: A Windows driver isn't going to work on Ubuntu.  You'll need to find a Linux driver for your device, and either use your Ethernet port or copy it to a USB stick.\n", "Q: Am I being served a beta release of 13.10? Today, I followed the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SaucyUpgrades (Ubuntu Desktops 13.04 to 13.10). When I got to step #6, the release notes popped up, and the first two lines said:\n\nWelcome to the Ubuntu 'Saucy Salamander' development release\nThis is still a BETA release. Do not install it on production\n  machines.\n\nIs my system trying to get outdated files, or is is safe to ignore those notes?\n\nA: The problem here is that the message has not been updated already. The files are the official 13.10 release but since the message still shows the previous text (when it was Beta) it shows like that to any users that tries to update.\nThe same thing happened with 12.10 to 13.04 and 12.04 to 12.10. If you do wait about a day (up to a week) the message should change to \"Welcome to the Ubuntu 'Saucy Salamander'\".\nGive it time while the developers work on this \"high priority\" bug ;). It confused me too until I updated.\n\nA: 13.10 is not a beta release anymore.  13.10 is a stable release.  If you were on the Beta release ISOs, or are installing the Beta release ISOs, the system should still update to the latest versions in the repos, as your updates should still be applied because the repositories used are the same as the full released versions now.\nThis is an issue of where the community docs were just out of date.\nThe documentation has been updated to reflect that it is no longer a beta release.\n\nA: Even if it is labelled a beta release you will be getting the same files as the stable release.\nFor more info:\nI installed an alpha or beta, am I up to date with the final release if I keep upgrading?\n\nA: Always hashcheck downloaded isos from the official releases at releases.ubuntu.com.  The check will not only detect transmission errors but detect old or altered versions.  \n\nIf the problem persists, the cause may be far in the past.  You cannot expect official updates to fix everything in an altered iso.\n", "Q: Dual boot Win 7 Ubuntu - home and boot partitions have no mount point After installing Ubuntu 12.04.3 on a Windows 7 laptop, running Ubuntu Disk Utility showed the following partition information;\n/dev/sda1 NTFS, Bootable, Filesystem, Labled: System Reserved, 105MB, Not Mounted\n\n/dev/sda2 NTFS, no flag, Filesystem, no label, 84GB, Not Mounted\n\n/dev/sda3 Usage: Container for logical partitions.

If I copy the kernel of windows and tries to run in linux will it be possible to edit and create my own new one which is competiting to windows.?\n\nA: No, this is completely not possible.\nThe kernel is responsible for controlling everything your computer does, it has very specific interfaces and Windows and Linux are not compatible.\nThere are efforts to make Linux applications run on Windows such as the Cygwin project, and efforts to make Windows applications run on Linux, such as the Wine project. The other extreme is that some people are attempting to re-create windows, called ReactOS.\nYou could not copy the windows kernel since it is built from source code which only Microsoft has access to and to which only they have copyright for.\nYour best bet is to learn programming and contribute to one of the projects mentioned above.\n", "Q: desktop has become a grey void in Xubuntu 13.10 I upgraded from xubuntu 13.04 to 13.10. Everything seemed fine. Then I turned the computer off... rebooted and signed in and the desktop wallpaper and icons and files on the desktop are gone. Replaced by a grey void. the top and bottom panels are still present and I can run programs from the menu or the launcher along the bottom of the screen. \nIf I go into settings and try to change my wallpaper it shows the correct image selected yet the desktop stays grey. I change the ocons that are to be listed on the desktop and it stays empty grey.\nPlease someone help me.\n\nA: I've had the very similar problem several times. What seems to help in most cases is the deletion of the sessions cache while you are not Xfce-logged-in:\n\n*\n\n*If you are logged in, then log out. (ensure that you are not logged in at Xfce.)\n\n\n*At the login screen press the combination Ctrl+Alt+F1 to reach a terminal based login.\n\n\n*Login with your normal credentials.\n\n\n*Delete the cached sessions directory:\nrm -rf ~/.cache/sessions/\n\n\n\n*Press Ctrl+D to logout.\n\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F7 to get back to you normal GUI login screen. (if that does not work, try F6 or F8 instead of F7.)\nThat should solve the problem.\nIf you instead delete the directory while being logged in at Xfce, sometimes Xfce seems to reinstall a corrupted session cache when logging out, even if the corresponding checkbox is unchecked.\nAnother often suggested solution involves the deletion of ~/.config/xfce4, but that means loss of some data. See https://mynixworld.info/2015/10/20/xfce-desktop-grey/ for restoring.\n\nA: do you have any conflicting Xorg packages? I had been using the oibaf PPA to get upstream Mesa stuff but they aren't building for Saucy yet so when I upgraded I had to manually go into synaptic and force the \"older\" versions of some of the packages which would've been installed with 13.10 by default to stop getting some graphical corruption.\n\nA: I doubt you still have this problem, but for anyone else reading--\nI just had the same problem, and was about to give up and revert to Ubuntu (I initially had Ubuntu, but didn't like the Unity thing, so I downloaded and ran Xubuntu desktop, which pretty much acts like you're using Xubuntu) when I stumbled on a really odd solution. If you restart your computer, you'll get to the bootloader. I'm not sure if it's the same with real Xubuntu, but mine  had the options: \"Ubuntu\" and \"Ubuntu advanced options\". I hit enter on \"Advanced options\" and it kinda gave me a list of previous releases. I selected \"Ubuntu 13.10 w/ Linux kernel 3.13 yadayada..\" and everything went back to what I had (expectedly so). But when I rebooted and went back to the current 14.04 release, everything was back to normal. The desktop background was there, icons were there, right-clicking worked, everything.\nTL;DR try restarting and enter a previous release, then restarting again and enter the current release.\n\nA: Also just stumbled on another possible answer. I right-clicked the desktop background and hit \"properties\". It gave me an error message saying \"Thunar was not found\" so I re-downloaded Thunar (I'm sure I had it before, at some point it must have been deleted). So that might have something to do with it too.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 13.10 Wifi doesn't work - DHCP timeout I have a Realtek RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n WiFi adapter in my computer. Today I upgraded to 13.10 and I can't connect. Before upgrading WiFi worked just fine. I can see WiFi networks, but it just gives the error \"IP configuration was unavailable\" when trying to connect. Other devices work just fine. I've tried deleting the configuration and remaking it multiple times, and that doesn't work.\nSo, looking at syslog, it seems the DHCP request is timing out.

On a working Ubuntu install I installed Ubuntu Customization Kit (UCK) and I used to customize the original ISO of Kubuntu 13.10. Basically, UCK chroots in the ISO and allows you to customize it. I started UCK and asked it to give me access to a console, then I modified /etc/apt/sources.list and I added this line:\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy-proposed main restricted universe multiverse\n\nto enable the download of newest (unstable) packages. Then I ran apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade, which installed, among the others, plasma-nm and other networking-related packages. Then I ended the UCK session and built a new ISO. If I start my system using this customized ISO then DHCP does not timeout and apparently everything works fine.\nI can put my ISO online if anyone is interested (just leave a comment, I don't want to upload 1GB if nobody is going to use it), however I urge you to create your own ISO because its simple and you don't have to trust me and assume that I didn't tamper the ISO.\nBe aware that I only tested the live system and I did not run a full install. YMMV.\n\nA: I had the same problem while installing 13.10 from a daily build ISO. Completely upgrading the system fixed the issue for me.\nThe steps I followed were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use an ethernet connection (because manually configuring wireless is a pain)\n\n*Run dhclient eth0 to configure it and make sure the interface is up\n\n*Do the apt-get update / apt-get dist-upgrade routine\n\n*Delete any previously stored wireless connections\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nThat fixed the issue for me. However, every so often Network Manager was trying to take over and de-configured the connection, thus the download stopped. I had to cancel the download, run dhclient eth0 again, and then resume the dist-upgrade. \nI hope it works for you! \n\nA: There are some problems with the driver that is included with 13.10.  It seems to be getting worse and worse.\nIf you feel adventurous, I took the driver source code and fixed it up for myself.  I posted it on Github:  https://github.com/FreedomBen/rtl8188ce-linux-driver\nSo far this is the only version of the driver that I know of (besides the pre-packaged one) that compiles and works on Ubuntu 13.10.  There are installation instructions in the README.md file.\n\nA: This is not really an answer, it is a work-around. It seems like, as was noted already, the driver included with the kernel in 13.10 is defective. I installed kernel version 3.8.13-03081312-generic from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/ and booted from it. My wireless is working fine now.\nEdit: The driver in kernel 3.9.11-030911-generic also works, and that is what I am using now.\nAnd yet another update: Kernel 3.12.0-031200-generic has fixed the problem.\n\nA: You could try to use this script i made lay it in network:\nbin/sh\nCase ![%] in\n      .bin/sh\n      nmcli nm sleep=false 'network'\n  End case\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: Update manager has managed to hang itself while updating (13.04 to 13.10) I was updating my Ubuntu from 13.04 to 13.10. All the packages were downloaded and were being installed, while all of a sudden the update manager window went dim. \nI ran ps -A and I can see a process called saucy however, how can I get my update manager to restart? I am afraid that since my updates manager has already (and possibly) installed some of the packages, my installation might go kaput and I might have to start everything from zero. \nPlease help. \n\nA: This is an especially serious problem, which also occurred in an earlier release, since it blocks a novice user's fix of the problem (no way to update). The hang also stops a user from logging out, risking a dangerous power down as a solution. (Don't ever do that -- you'll need to manually eliminate software list fragments from root or the GUI updater will never work again.) Although somewhat risky, you can drop to Terminal and use a KILL [process ID] command to dismiss the hung process (after using ps -ux to retrieve the process ID), then use apt-get update (and) upgrade in Terminal for future updates, until you're certain the GUI updater is repaired.\n\nA: unfortunately, I have the same problem, on two computers. The first box looks suspiciously like a new install.\nThe second one I was more careful, dropped to console, killed the updater.

I also have Intel Wireless 7260 (not sure about the -N) and either of the following works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing a newer kernel version, by installing linux-generic-lts-saucy, in 12.04.3 or older.\n\n*Using the recently released and latest version, 12.04.4, from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nNote that Ubuntu 13.10 also works out of the box (but I personally prefer LTS versions).\n\nA: I had the same problems in the beginning, trying 12.04 and 13.04\nIt was solved after upgrading to 13.10 where all drivers where detected automatically.\n", "Q: Restarting update manager after freezing! While upgrading a distribution, the update manager freezes. How to restart the process of a safe upgrade? \n\nA: I have taken the following steps to solve the condition: \nsudo pkill saucy\n\nThis will kill the process named saucy which has frozen. Then there would be a need to reconfigure the downloaded packages. To do this: \nsudo dpkg --configure -a \n\nThere may be some packages which might have downloaded but not installed. To install them, do the following: \nsudo apt-get upgrade \n\nFinally, it might be possible that your system has actually not detected the upgrade (Well, strange things happen with computers!). Therefore to alleviate this problem run: \nsudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: You can find the the process ID (PID) for the software updater by running: $ ps -aux | grep \"Software Updater\"\nfrom the command line.

Then, I went and checked the Keyboard shortcut settings and found out that it had been set to \"Super+Space\"(which BTW didn't work either). So I tried to change it back to \"Alt+Shift\" but it just doesn't work; when I press \"Alt+Shift\" to set it up as the toggle-language shortcut, the box automatically resets itself to its previous value(without any errors whatsoever). As far as I've checked I couldn't find any thing obvious corresponding to the shortcut \"Alt+Shift\" either.\nI've currently set up the shortcut as \"Ctrl+Space\"; so I can toggle the language.

For interpreted/vm languages(e.g. python, java, shell scripts) can apparmor be set to only confine a particular script or program?  If so, how?\n\nA: Yes it's possible. It's also in use in Ubuntu, especially on the phone.\nTo get a basic apparmor script, you can use aa-autodep from the apparmor-utils package.\nQuick example for python:\ncat >> ~/myapp << EOF\n#! /usr/bin/python\nEOF\n\nsudo aa-autodep ~/myapp\n\ncat /etc/apparmor.d/home.<user-name>.myapp\n\nThis will give you something like:\n# Last Modified: Mon Feb 24 18:31:50 2014\n#include <tunables/global>\n\n/home/sam/myapp flags=(complain) {\n  #include <abstractions/base>\n  #include <abstractions/python>\n\n  /home/sam/myapp r,\n  /usr/bin/python2.7 ix,\n\n}\n\nThen you can expand on that.\n\nA: Well, actually using ' /usr/bin/python2.7 ix,' is not a good idea.\nSince exploited code may execute python from shell, for example:\npython -c 'some evil code'.\nThis definitely not what you want and totally breaks sandbox concept (what apparmor is). \nix means inherit same restrictions as parent profile. In this case, i'm not sure if executing external commands under same restrictions as /home/sam/myap is a good idea.\nSince we're talking about security, we should ask: why external command/python called from /home/sam/myapp should be able to access for read/write/deleting files created by /home/sam/myapp or system wide sensitive files? or even create connection to external system? (remember the old case of skype reading unnecessary files under /etc?)\nSo the more secure solution is use child profile (subprofile) to running external python program\n#include <tunables/global>\n\n/home/sam/myapp flags=(complain) {\n  #include <abstractions/base>\n\n\n  /home/sam/myapp r,\n  /usr/bin/python2.7 Cx -> trusted_domain,\n\n  profile trusted_domain {\n\n   #include <abstractions/....>\n\n   #include <abstraction/python>\n   /usr/bin/my-python-app r,\n   ... your policy for data, logs, connections, python files...\n  }\n\n}\n\n\nA: I think yurii is confused possibly and thinks that \"ix\" means \"unconfined\" which would be \"Ux\" or \"ux\". I don't see any escape vulnerability here with launching python again either from a shell or subprocess.\nMore on the execution flags can be found at https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/wikis/QuickProfileLanguage\n", "Q: Kubuntu never gets to the login screen I am not sure if Xorg is using the right device...

However I cannot install or remove anything! \nI read a lot about users with the same problem, but their solutions are not working for me. \nPlease help. Thanks a lot!\n\nA: Try this.\nOpen a terminal and enter:\n~$ cd /usr/src\n/usr/src$ ls\n\nYou will see something like this:\ntotal 16K\ndrwxr-xr-x 24 root root 4,0K Σεπ  29 22:35 linux-headers-3.2.0-54/\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 root root 4,0K Σεπ  29 22:35 linux-headers-3.2.0-54-generic/\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4,0K Σεπ  29 22:56 nvidia-319-319.32/\n\nThe output may (and will) differ according to your set up.\nTake a close look at the folders named linux-headers-*. These are the headers from all your linux images that you have installed. If you have too many of them, they will take up A LOT of space and inodes. You only need to keep the latest one you boot from.\nLet's say you have an older kernel, eg. 3.2.0-53. To remove it, type:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge linux-image-3.2.0-53-generic linux-headers-3.2.0-53 linux-headers-3.2.0-53-generic\n\nfor each one of them.\nIf all of the above fail, then try to delete the OLDER KERNEL headers' folders manually:\nsudo rm -rf /usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-53{,-generic}\n\n\nA: You can try Ubuntu Tweak to clean old kernels. First install it using these commands\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nRun the program and then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the \"Janitor\" tab\n\n*Select the \"Old Kernel\" checkbox\n\n*Select kernel versions to remove (keep 2 at leats - just in case)\n\n*Press \"Clean\"\n\n\n\n\nA: I just had the same issue\nOn Ubuntu Linux 16.04.1 it seems that sudo apt autoremove will clean up all the unnecessary /usr/src/linux-headers- files and free the corresponding inodes\n\nA: Since the case involves a system with 100% HD usage, so, installing any application will not work. The only safe option is to delete unnecessary files first.\nFirst in row would be temporary files \nsudo rm -rf /tmp/*\n\nSecond, delete the cached applications. These are the binaries of applications and upgrades downloaded through the lifespan of the system. Normally this would be no less than 500 MB in an average Ubuntu system with one year of operation, and would give you a breather to install another apps.\nsudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/*deb\n\nThen I would recommend deleting old log files\nsudo rm /var/log/*gz\n\nBy this you would have at least free space of around 700 MB. This will allow you to work with utilities and install new ones.\nThen I would install ncdu, which is a fast utility to scan the whole harddisk, and order directories by size. It is really fast, and works like a charm. \nsudo apt-get install ncdu\n\nthen run it with the command\nsudo ncdu /\n\nThe slash after ncdu is to scan from the root directory.\nAll the above works in ubuntu server as well as Desktop.\nNow, after doing all the above, and you are running on a Desktop environment, then , you can \ngo for GUI utilities such as ubuntu-tweak (which is excellent by the way) and delete the old kernels. I usually keep the latest kernel, and the one before the latest, in case of upgrade failures.\nHope that this would help.\n\nA: Another way is to search for the folders which are eating up your inode count.\nSee here: Broken package after update: linux-headers, error: BrokenCount >0\nThis is the most important part:\nIn a terminal, cd to root to start:\n# cd /\n\nThen search for the folders eating up most inodes:\n# for i in `ls -1A`; do echo \"`find $i | sort -u | wc -l` $i\"; done | sort -rn | head -20\n\nAnd so on, you will be able to find the folders which heed removed or packages, kernel headers, images that need uninstalled.\n", "Q: completely remove xfce from xubuntu 13.04 and install gnome I don't like unity in new ubuntu. So I download xubuntu for my laptop. Now I don't like xfce as well and I want gnome. How can I completely remove xfce from xubuntu 13.04 and install gnome 3.8?\n\nA: Start with installing \"gnome-session\" then you can change your desktop environment from xfce4 to gnome at log in time.\nIf you really want to remove xfce4 after trying gnome check out the instructions here. They were written for 12.10 but it will point you in the write direction.\nMany of the packages you're instructed to remove are useful programs that work in gnome as well as xfce4 (such as abiword, gmusicbrowser to name two). \nI'd start by limiting myself to removing packages named \"xf*\" or \"xubuntu*\". After remove those packages many orphaned libraries can be autoremoved.\nDon't just cut and paste the instructions there or you'll end up installing Unity again by installing \"ubuntu-desktop\".\n\nA: If you want gnome similar to as it was is Ubuntu 10.04 then you can install the Gnome Classic Desktop as described in this question:\nHow to revert to GNOME Classic Desktop?\nSince 13.04 however there is an official variant of Ubuntu with Gnome as the default desktop Ubuntu Gnome.\nIf you want this I recommend you do a backup and a clean install.

It seemed to go all right, however after the system restarted and booted up Ubuntu 13.10, it began experiencing several problems. Some of them were due to expected conflicts with the updated OS, however right now I cannot figure out why certain hardware functions are now \"broken\" and how to fix them. \nAs far as I can tell, these are the sound (permanently muted), mic (picks up no sound), brightness (set at maximum brightness regardless of using keyboard shortcuts or moving the screen brightness slider) and trackpad (mouse does not move, however plugged-in USB mouse does)\nThis sounds to me like a driver issue, however I cannot figure out how to re-enable my drivers, re-install them, or whatever I have to do here.

In your situation; do a ifconfig -a and see if the WiFi interface is even there at all.

I am thinking like in the android phone way, you upgrade your OS but no files are gone. Is there anyway to do that??\n\nA: Well, there isn't a need to delete files in the first place.\n\n\n*\n\n*For normal users, you get a GUI dialog box pop up to ask if you want to upgrade to the newest release.\n\n*The command line method is sudo do-release-upgrade -d or sudo sed -i 's/raring/saucy/g' /etc/apt/sources.list; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade -y; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y.\n\n*The CD method is simply clicking upgrade when asked how you want to install.\nHowever, it's advisable to make a /home partition when you first install Ubuntu so you can always do a complete fresh install and still have all of your files.\n", "Q: Startup problems, 13.10 and 13.04 I've run several previous Ubuntu systems on the same Eee PC with no problem. Then switched to xfce for about a year, now am trying to switch back to see what's new in Ubuntu.\nOn 13.04 and also 13.10, I download on a Mac, and did get the correct md5, and did write and verify on a DVD-R sucessfully.

I had problems installing 13.04 on a Mac using a few-years-old DVD-RW.  Went to the store and got a different brand of DVD; that solved the problem.  Also check that the speed at which you're burning the disk is compatible.  Heck, even if you can run LiveCD, it may be that there are bad sectors on the disk that prevent full installation.  The DVDs are made differently and some (generally the more expensive, of course) are more compatible with the ISO and your Mac than are others.\nIf it's not the DVD then what I've seen on the forums indicates a possible RAM error.  You might check the forums as there are some questions on I/O errors and RAM.  Here's hoping it's just a faulty/cheap DVD.\n", "Q: Where to find touchpad settings in Ubuntu 13.10?

When i bought the desktop i also purchased a D-Link DWA-123 Model USB wifi adapter. It was discovered (although very slow) when using my live-cd to install Ubuntu, however after installation it stopped all together. I then moved my desktop to the router and used Ethernet to run updates and after these updates the wifi adapter was discovered again, however due to playing around with endless \"fix\"s all over the ask Ubuntu forums i believe i may have  mixed up some of the setting around for my drivers. When i start up my desktop my D-link adapter is undiscovered, after openning the terminal and using \"sudo modprobe rt2800usb\" it is discovered but is very slow and  i have attempted to download games in steam and watching the download rate flat line for a few seconds  then spike up to maybe 100-200kb/s then flat again. Using  my laptop at the same location running  win7 i can download at a rate of 400kb/s+ actual download rate through steam, and the  internet connection on it is fine.\nAfter having no luck with finding a fix i went out today and purchased a TP-Link TL-WN823N usb wifi adapter.

To install, first install Eclipse from the Ubuntu Software Centre and then see this guide. \nhttp://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html\nThere is another option, you can use Android Studio, which is based on another IDE called IntelliJ, however this is an early release which is not yet stable, and so using Eclipse is still recommended at this time. \nFor more information on Android Studio, see here;\nhttp://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html\n", "Q: I tried to update from 13.04 to 13.10.

I just got a update notification saying version 13.10 of ubuntu can be updated. I wanted to see if anyone has updated and if so, is it good and is there any bugs in it?\n~Steam gamer\n\nA: I upgraded. Really like it so far. It doesn't have any big new features, but it does some awesome under the hood improvements. Especially on the gaming side and looking at your name, you might be interested in that! There have been a lot of performance improvements for 3D applications (like games).\nOther notable new features are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Smart Scopes: You can now search for a lot of other sources than just Amazon. Also you can turn of the scopes you aren't intested in.\n\n*Updated packages: All standard applications like LibreOffice, Firefox and Thunderbird are updated to the latest version\n\n\nA: There are not many major changes in 13.10. You can find a review of it here. \nhttp://www.zdnet.com/ubuntu-13-10-saucy-salamander-review-smart-scopes-in-mir-out-7000022022/\nThe biggest change is the addition of more smart scopes, for searching online resources from the dash. I have been finding it useful, however it is not a major change. \nIt's up to you if you would like to upgrade. Ubuntu 13.04 will be supported into 2014, so there isn't an urgent need to upgrade. See here for the support periods of Ubuntu releases. \nHow long will Ubuntu 13.04 be supported for?\nNaturally however, 13.10 contains some improvements and upgrades to software packages so for that reason, you may want to upgrade. \n\nA: From the release notes:\n\nAs is to be expected, at this stage of the release process, there are some significant known bugs that users may run into with this release of Ubuntu 13.10. \n\nThis is nothing really too exciting as it will be the same for all new releases. Severe bugs will be fixed very soon, less severe bugs will be fixed over time, some bug will even persist over several releases.\n\n\n*\n\n*So if you are concerned about your system stability you should wait for a month after a release to reduce the risk to run into issues. \n\n*In case you feel like being able to fix things you may update on the release day but then it is an even better idea to have a recent backup before upgrading in case you need to revert.\n\n", "Q: No sounds after upgrade I upgraded my Ubuntu to 13.10 and now I can't hear any sounds.\nI checked on alsamixer that voices are on.

YouTube is still launching when I press those buttons. Even after few reboots, and reinstalling this webapp problem remains. Any solution?\n\nA: After you uninstalled unity-webapps-youtube youhave to remove manually YouTubeyoutubecom.desktop from this directories: ~/.local/share/applications/ and /usr/share/applications.

Sometimes, when installing things its says \"dependencies\" are missing.  \nWhat are dependencies?\n\nA: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware#Package_Dependencies\nA dependency is a file that something you are trying to install requires.\nYou can see what dependencies something requires at packages.ubuntu.com\nFor instance http://packages.ubuntu.com/saucy/firefox\nYou can see that firefox has dependencies, recommends and suggests. \nhttps://superuser.com/questions/70031/what-is-the-difference-between-recommended-and-suggested-packages-ubuntu\nPut simply you need dependencies, you can get away without recommends and suggests. \nI use an xfce system - I used to install nautilus - to install that I did so without installing the recommends. \n\nA: Dependency is a broad software engineering term used to refer when a piece of software relies on another one.\nCoupling (computer programming)\n\nIn software engineering, coupling or dependency is the degree to which each program module relies on each one of the other modules.\n\nProgram X uses Library Y.\nX depends on Y. Y is X's dependency.\n\nBut being specific to your scenario, this dependency talk outputted by the OS to you refers to software packages (what you referred as things).\nA software package may depend on another software package. The package manager resolves all this for you.\nBy dependencies are missing the package manager is saying to you that it is attempting to install a software package (probably a program in your case) that depends on another package that he couldn't find.\nDependency solving can be a little complex sometimes, but normally the package manager is able to retrieve everything he needs from repositories.\n\nA: Sometimes when you install programs, they rely on other programs to work. These other programs are called dependencies. \nFor example, if I write a messenging application, and I want my messages to be encrypted, instead of creating a way to encrypt the messages myself, I'll use a package that someone else has written, which will do the encryption for me. Now when you want to install my program, you need my program, but you also need the package I used to encrypt the messages. My program depends on the other program. \nWhen Ubuntu installs new programs, it installs them from a big warehouse of programs called a repository or a repo. It's quite clever too, if it notices that a program depends on another program, it will install both at the same time so you don't have to worry about it. \nHowever, problems come up when a program depends on another program, but Ubuntu can't find it in the repositories. \nThis happens more often when there is a new version of Ubuntu, becase a new version of Ubuntu means a whole new repository, and sometimes not all programs are updated for the new version of Ubuntu and therefore aren't in the repository. Over time, as programs get updated and added to the new repository, this problem should happen less and less. \nI hope that helps.\n", "Q: Recommended setup dualboot EFI Let me firstly update you on my current situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*HDD 1: solid state drive (GPT) with Windows 8.1 in EFI setup (no secure boot, has EFI partition)\n\n*HDD 2: regular hard disk (MBR) with Ubuntu 13.04 alongside a documents partition in NTFS.\nNow it used to be like this ever since I reinstalled Windows in EFI. In legacy mode Ubuntu booted fine (when I override boot to my HDD 2 in BIOS), although according to the Ubuntu tutorials it's not exactly recommended to have two boot methods.\nI want to install 13.10 as clean as possible, and I can now decide to change setup. What can you suggest I'd do? I know it worked fine in 'hybrid' (legacy + EFI) and EFI is the way to go, but I want everything to be coherent and streamlined.\n\nA: If Windows8 is installed in UEFI mode, you need to install Ubuntu in UEFI mode too.\nHere is how to convert your Ubuntu install in UEFI mode: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#Converting_Ubuntu_into_EFI_mode\n\nA: It can work either way. The trouble with the mixed-mode setup is that you need to be an expert to set it up and maintain it, particularly with two hard disks. The chain of possible options just becomes too complex to try to describe online or guide an individual through. The fact that it's working for you now means that you managed to stumble upon a working solution, but I wouldn't bet on that continuing to work when you upgrade.\nIn theory, there's no need to convert your second disk from MBR to GPT to boot in EFI mode. Your first disk presumably has an EFI System Partition (ESP), and when you install Ubuntu, it should detect that and use it to hold an EFI-mode version of GRUB 2. Even if it doesn't, you could manually install any EFI-mode boot loader you like after the fact, and it should work. That said, if there are bugs in your specific firmware or in Ubuntu that would cause problems with a mixed MBR/GPT setup in EFI mode, you can convert non-destructively from MBR to GPT using gdisk (which is in the gdisk or gptfdisk package in Ubuntu, but I don't recall which, offhand).\n", "Q: Not video player works at all Xubuntu 13.10 No of the video player work, vlc, smplayer, parole etc. etc. \nI sometimes get an error, but mostly I get a screen with weird colors and a couple of weird sounds.\nAny help or suggestions?\n\nA: By default Ubuntu disables some 3rd party sources, which might include some video playback.\nFrom the Settings Manager option in menu open \"Software & Updates\".

The major problem is the mouse becoming jerky.\nCan someone please suggest anything which can solve this problem?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I recommend you determine what system resource is limiting performance during slow down. By that I mean is your CPU at 100% or maybe your hard drive is running like mad. There are system monitor tools that will give you this information in real time such as \"gnome-system-monitor\".\nThe system monitor can also tell you what process is using the resource. You could also use a terminal program like \"top\" or the nicer looking \"htop\" to identify the process.\n", "Q: Could Autorun Virus, affect my PC via Wine? I have installed wine and i am afraid that viruses will affect my PC now.

A virus is just an application that does particular things. If wine supports those things, they're going to work as designed. If wine doesn't, you're going to see a bunch of messy errors.\nIt's really not possible to give one answer that covers all viruses.\nI generally consider it better to just avoid them in the first place.\nWhat does a virus run under Wine have access to?\nHaving seen another answer claiming that Wine can't hurt anything, I think it's important to add that it's not true. Wine has access to more than enough to ruin your day.\nFor your convenience, your home directory is symlinked to My Documents. That means you can save things easily from Wine applications but it also means that even a basic virus could, for example, encrypt all your Ubuntu documents and hold them hostage.\n\nA: Some viruses will explore all drives. Which means, yes, they can infect your PC. Others only infect the system drive, which sounds bad, but remember, the system drive in Windows is C:/ which is a virtual drive in Wine. But, Wine redirects user folders to your ubuntu folders, so they could have an effect. In other words, your home folder could be infected. It's a Windows virus - it'll target system folders - for the virtual drive, not Ubuntu. Basically, they can do harm, but if they don't outside of the virtual C drive, you can just delete the virtual drive and re-install Wine.\n", "Q: How to enable extra typographic characters in Ubuntu 13.10?

But I've been wanting to uninstall Linux for a while to reclaim memory for my steam games on windows, the only thing that keeps holding me back is the thought of dealing with grub. But since windows 8.1 knocked it out, what would happen if I just deleted my Linux partitions and reallocated that memory? And what's the watermark all about?\n\nA: Yes, you can just trash your Linux partitions, lose all the data on them in the process, and resize a Windows partition to reclaim the free space.\n\nA: Alright. I trashed my linux partitions, and everything was fine. it wouldnt let me merge the unallocated memory with my c drive because they werent continguous on the partition table so I formated the unallocated memory as a windows partition to store data so I still have that storage that i can access. Ive already put 3 games on. And I forgot I had to disable secureboot to install linux but booting into bios, going to boot options and enabling secure boot ridded me of the watermark and had no effect on my system. You can disable it anytime you wanna boot into linux or something. Hope this helps anyone who was having the same issues as me!\n", "Q: Can anybody help me resolve these FWTS issues? See the list below. I have no clue where to start.\nI ran firmware testsuitelive (USB). Some tests failed, which might explain the issues I'm having with my machine (constant reboot after shutdown or suspend, I assume these are ACPI issues).\nI have the latest BIOS on my system.\nMany thanks in advance for helping sort those out!\nResults generated by fwts: Version V0.26.03 (Thu Dec 20 16:46:56 CST 2012).\n\nSome of this work - Copyright (c) 1999 - 2010, Intel Corp.

I am not sure right now, what takes precedence, or how the shell handles the situation.

Ubuntu's Wacom tablet calibration works great, but other desktops (xfce for example) do not work nearly as well when using 2 monitors. I've been searching around for a solution, but it occurred to me that if I could locate the saved calibration settings from when I ran Ubuntu's calibration app, I might be able to use them to manually calibrate my tablet in xfce. Does anyone know where the settings are saved?\n\nA: I do not know the actual answer to your question (where the calibration values are stored) but let me give you some pointers on how to obtain these values:\nBy using the xinput command-line tool you can query all properties of you tablet.\n$ xinput\n\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                          id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech Optical USB Mouse                id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                         id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Dell Dell USB Keyboard Hub                id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Dell Dell USB Keyboard Hub                id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nThis will give you the list of devices. Look for your Wacom device (not present in my example), and remember its id value. The IDs may change upon reboot, btw.\nThen query the device properties by issuing\n$ xinput --list-props <id>\n\nwhere <id> is the ID number of your device. It will now show a list of all the properties that are set for your Wacom tablet.\nNow run a calibration in Ubuntu and purposely really screw it up by clicking in wrong places. Then store the properties in a file:\n$ xinput --list-props <id>  >xinput-cal-wrong.txt\n\nThen run a calibration in Ubuntu and do it correctly. Again, store the values in a file:\n$ xinput --list-props <id>  >xinput-cal-correct.txt\n\nNow compare the text files, and watch the differences. These are obviously the properties that the calibration tool changes, and you can record these values. You can apply them in XFCE on the command-line by setting the properties, for example for the Area properties:\n$ xinput --set-prop <id> 'Area' -20 12 87064 65691\n\nYou can put the necessary commands in your ~/.xinitrc file, which is called when your window system starts. I also recommend to look at the xsetwacom command-line tool, which has similar syntax and can also be used to get and set properties.\n", "Q: upgrade from Lubuntu 13.04 to 13.10 failed and system doesn,t boot I tried to upgrade lubuntu 13.04 to 13.10 using Software Update Manager and received several errors during upgrade process.

I have an ssd hard drive that is bootable from my old computer. It is a standard BIOS, however, I built a new computer with Z87 motherboard that is a UEFI. What I'd like to do is boot from this hard drive without wiping out the hard drive. I've tried booting from legacy mode, doesn't seem to work. Part of the multitude of problems is my partitioning scheme, which is GPT. sdx1 is the btrfs system, sdx2 swap, sdx3 is bios_grub. \nI've tried setting the UEFI/BIOS to boot in legacy mode, I've tried turning my swap partition into a Grub EFI boot, I've tried copying the file system onto a new drive installed on the new system. However, copying the information doesn't keep the filesystem or subvolumes intact. I've also tried boot-repair which is when I overwrote the swap space. I'd really rather not start over on a new install, so any other suggested trees to bark up would be appreciated.\nFor the record, I hate you Microsoft, and ASUS I understand complying with microsoft, but make it optional... I'm really disappointed in that I have to deal with Windows 8 when I have nothing to do with it.\nSomething I think I could try, but would like to hear from more experienced users. Moving the sdx1 (btrfs /@/@home) partion and opening up a 100 MB partition on the beginning sectors and install efi compatible Grub2 installation. Would it work? How to move a partition?\n\nA: First, some EFIs have odd requirements when booting from GPT in BIOS mode. See my Web page on the topic for details. In most cases, setting the boot/active flag on the type-0xEE partition in the protective MBR will fix the problem. Note that you need fdisk (but not the very latest version!) or some other GPT-unaware tool to do this. (The very latest version of parted can also do this, but I don't recall the precise details.)\nSecond, if that doesn't help, you may be able to install an EFI-mode boot loader on the disk to get the job done. See my Web page on EFI boot loaders for information on what's available and how to install them. GRUB 2 might be fairly easy to install if you can chroot into the system in EFI mode; or you can try installing rEFInd, which you can install manually (not via the Debian package) or after using chroot.\n", "Q: package broken, and no installation accepted by terminal I installed cinnamon and then was trying to install other apps but as you can see on the picture, package brocken, any ideas how could this error be solved?\nThanks\n\n\nA: \nCheck if you are using third party repositories. If so disable them,\n  since they are a common source of problems.\n\nTo check if you are using third party repositories, go to System Settings → Software & Updates and select Other Software tab, and if you are really using third party repositories, disabe them:\n\n\nFuthermore run the following command in a terminal: apt-get install -f\n\nTo do so, open your terminal and run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nMore about: How do I resolve unmet dependencies after adding a PPA?\n", "Q: Grub-Customizer made Windows 7 disappear from Grub2 I am running dual-boot Ubuntu 12.04/Windows7. I wanted to change the boot order in Grub2 to have Windows on top of the list.\nI installed Grub-Customizer on Ubuntu 12.04 using the following terminal commands copied from another post:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:adabbas/1stppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nAfter installing, I launched Grub-Customizer from Dash Home. Windows 7 does not appear in the list. I closed the program and was prompted to save the current settings.\nUpon rebooting, Windows did not appear in the Grub2 list.\nI went back into Grub-Customizer and clicked the \"Revert\" button but still no Windows 7.\nDoes anyone know how I can fix this?\n\nA: Boot-Repair can undo the settings generated by GRUB-Customizer.\nRun Boot-Repair --> Advanced Options -> GRUB options tab --> tick \"Purge GRUB and reinstall it\" --> Apply\nIndicate the URL that will appear if any issue.\n\nA: You can run\n\nsudo update-grub\n\nto generate a new grub config file and let grub detect all the OS installed on your system.\nAnyway, if you want to change the deafult entry in GRUB, you can edit the /etc/default/grub file. The value of GRUB_DEFAULT indicates the default boot item in the grub menu. This settings takes either a string or a numeric value:\nString: menuentry name\nYou can give to it the entry name in this way:\n\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"Menu entry\"\n\nYou can take the entry name from this file /boot/grub/grub.cfg. In it you will find some lines starting with \"menuentry\", the string between the \" \" indicates the entry name.\n\nNumeric value: entry number\nYou can also give an \"entry number\" instead of the entry name to GRUB_DEFAULT. For example, if you want the second entry to be the default, just edit like this:\n\nGRUB_DEFAULT=2\n\nHere too, you can see the entry number inside the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg counting the \"menuentry\" lines.\nDon't forget to run a sudo update-grub after the modifications in order to make changes to GRUB_DEFAULT into the real grub config.\n", "Q: Force apt-get to ask all install questions again? While installing jackd using apt-get, I gave the wrong answer to some questions. How do I force apt-get to ask me the question again? I'd really rather do this through the package manager than making the changes manually.\nI tried to purge it and install it again. I have also tried dpkg-reconfigure jackd.\n\nA: It's likely that dpkg-reconfigure is the solution, but sometimes the package to which the question belongs is not named the same as the package you installed - either because it was a meta-package, or because the question belonged to one of the dependent packages.\nIn that case, it can be helpful to look at the debconf database to see if there is a likely candidate, using debconf-show e.g.\n$ sudo debconf-show --listowners | grep jack\njackd2\nand it turns out that\n$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure jackd2\n\ndoes indeed prompt the question that you are looking for. \n\nA: For the benefit of the reader in case you stumble over a similar thing, this here helps to solve following problem(s):\n\n\n*\n\n*After a package is installed you see, that many things are at the wrong place.\n\n*dpkg-reconfigure package does not help either, as this might leave unwanted (or even dangerous) debris behind (for example, when switching to username git for package gitolite3 it  does not clean up the default gitolite3 user - as it cannot know if this user was used in the meanwhile).\n\n*After uninstalling the package, Debian still \"magically\" remembers the last values entered at the next install.\n\n*You can see some package configuration values on dpkg-reconfigure, which are not asked on apt-get install\n\n*You hate Curses-GUIs or love plain text consoles\n\n\nHave apt ask for every possible configuration value\nDEBIAN_FRONTEND=readline DEBIAN_PRIORITY=low apt-get install PACKAGE\nHowever, this might not ask for everything if there are already cached answers.  These are kept in something called debconf.  The file where it is kept is called /var/cache/debconf/config.dat.\nTo see all this information, run following command, perhaps before you try to install PACKAGE:\ndebconf-show PACKAGE\n\nSee below on some ways to get rid of unwanted entries (there are zillion of more ways, of course).\n\nWarning:\nNever ever edit /var/cache/debconf/config.dat on your own.  Look at it, but do not alter it with an editor.  It's a picky file.  Spaces, TABs, etc., do not touch these, keep them as-is.  Some editors try to do clever things with spaces in text files.  They will destroy config.dat.  And most time you cannot even see it.\nInstead use the proper tools (some are in debconf-utils):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*debconf-get-selections to dump everything\n  \n*debconf-set-selections to set things\n  \n*debconf-show PACKAGE to see all debconf parameters of PACKAGE (this is everything dpkg-reconfigure PACKAGE would ask)\n  \n*echo PURGE | debconf-communicate PACKAGE to delete all debconf information of a PACKAGE\nBut beware, these are not designed for normal people.\n\nHow to get rid of everything of a package\n\nWarning!  apt-get purge (aka. apt-get remove --purge) might destroy valuable user data.  Be sure you kept a backup, just in chance.  You have been warned.\n\nThe opposite of apt-get install PACKAGE is apt-get remove --purge PACKAGE.  Nowadays we can write apt-get purge PACKAGE for this, too.  Without purging, some things are left behind, such that you can quickly install the PACKAGE again with all the previous settings and data intact.  This includes all the questions asked when the PACKAGE was installed the first time.\nHowever apt-get purge PACKAGE removes all traces of the PACKAGE, including it's configuration and quite often even valuable user data which was stored by or for the PACKAGE will be removed entirely as well!\nSo if you see, that something went wrong when installing a PACKAGE, you can use apt-get purge PACKAGE to get rid of it, such that you can try again to install it correctly.  Later, after you have used PACKAGE a while, apt-get purge PACKAGE probably comes out very evil.\nNote that apt-get purge PACKAGE sometimes leaves debris behind when a package was reconfigured with dpkg-reconfigure PACKAGE, because purge operates on what is known at \"purge-time\", and not what was before that, because there is little to no history about what was before the last dpkg-reconfigure.\nBut if you are sure there is no valuable data left which is not backed up and you want to start from fresh with some package, do an apt-get purge PACKAGE.  Note that you can do this even after a package was removed with apt-get remove PACKAGE.\nHow to find the package\nYou have know a file, but do not know which package it belongs to, this finds it:\ndpkg -S /path/to/file\n\nIf this does not output anything, it does not belong to a PACKAGE.  So perhaps it is user data or debris.  You decide.\nFor a COMMAND you can type (note that the quotes are important) to find it's PACKAGE:\ndpkg -S \"`which COMMAND`\"\n\nIt you found the package, you can get a list of all files in a package:\ndpkg -L PACKAGE\n\n(Note that this does not include some files, which are generated by the install scripts.)\nHowever finding a package only works for installed packages.  If you need the same info for not yet installed packages, try the tool apt-file search filename (you need to run apt-file update first to initialize it's database).\nTo sum it up\n\n\n*\n\n*You have a PACKAGE already installed and want to reconfigure it\ndpkg-reconfigure PACKAGE\n\n\n*You want to re-install a PACKAGE with the current settings\n    apt-get install --reinstall PACKAGE\n\n*You want to re-install a PACKAGE from scratch, with deletion of all previous (possible precious) data, and have all possible questions asked again:\napt-get purge PACKAGE\nDEBIAN_PRIORITY=low apt-get install PACKAGE\n\n\n*If you dislike Curses interface and want a line-driven interface\nadd DEBIAN_FRONTEND=readline in front of apt-get\n\n*If you even dislike the readline interface and want dead simple line editing as well\nadd TERM=dumb in front of apt-get (note that this is nothing special from debconf, this works since Unix was born).\n(Note that you can set this in the Environment as well like export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=readline, of course.)\nFYI\nThe best source known to me, where debconf is explained, such that you can really understand it, and where I took most of the details for this here, is following link, but the page is in German language:\nhttp://debiananwenderhandbuch.de/debconf.html\nBTW:\n\n\n*\n\n*I write this as a reference to myself, too, because I cannot remember all the details.  It's all just too exotic and mostly absent from the man pages.\n\n*This answer is too long.  Which probably means, apt and debconf are still too confusing.\n\nA: I too just ran into this same issue (on Ubuntu Server 18.04) where I had installed jackd and wanted to reconfigure it to enable the realtime priorities, which I had selected No to on the initial installation.\nI still had the installation text displayed on my screen when I scrolled back. (via Shift-PageUp) and when I saw these two lines:\nSetting up jackd1 (1:0.125.0-3) ...\nSetting up jackd (5) ...\n\nI figured I could try reconfiguring jackd1 instead of jackd.\nSure enough, I did a sudo dpkg-reconfigure jackd1 and I was prompted for the realtime question again.\nWhen I answered yes this time, it changed the \n/etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf.disabled file into /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf which is what I sort of expected.\nOut of curiosity, I issued the command that @steeldriver did, and my system did show jackd1 instead of jackd2, so that all makes sense.\nsudo debconf-show --listowners | grep jack\njackd1\n\n", "Q: how to install nginx after removed it manually I have installed nginx using apt\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nginx\n\nThen I used whereis nginx and removed all files manually using rm  now I wanna re-install nginx but it doesn't work and returning error:\nawk: cannot open /etc/nginx/nginx.conf (No such file or directory)\n\nI create /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  then use apt-get install nginx it installed completely doesn't work.  \noutput of sudo dpkg -l | grep nginx:\nii  nginx                                      1.4.3-1~raring0                        all          small, powerful, scalable web/proxy server\nii  nginx-common                               1.4.3-1~raring0                        all          small, powerful, scalable web/proxy server - common files\nii  nginx-full                                 1.4.3-1~raring0                        i386         nginx web/proxy server (standard version)\n\n\nA: Since you managed to install it anyhow first thing you've to do is to remove it completely with the configuration files\nFollow these steps to remove it completely and install it again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal and execute these commands:\nsudo apt-get autoremove nginx\nsudo apt-get --purge remove nginx\nsudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo find / | grep nginx | sudo xargs rm -rf\n\n the last command will remove the repository also so you've to add it again by:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable\n\nNow try to install it again by:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -f install nginx\n\n\n*Hope it would solve your issue.

Ubuntu did not install properly and Windows 7 won't boot. Please help I have been using windows 7 for many years, but wanted to learn more about ubuntu.\nSo I used EaseUS partition manager to create a new partition on my hard drive. I then burned Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on to a CD, and booted Ubuntu from the CD. After trying out ubuntu for a bit, I decided to install it. Here is what I did:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/vYMQ6\n(screenshots and descriptions of everything I did is given in the album above).\nUbuntu still works from \"Live CD\" so I was able to copy my important files into a USB drive.

I just a beginner to Ubuntu as well (I was installing it to learn more about it). So, any help would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: For Windows repair unable to detect the operating system, I think marking partition sda2 (your 100mb system partition) as \"Active\", should do the trick. Detailed instructions on how to do that are available here: http://www.sevenforums.com/installation-setup/88872-startup-repair-menu-doesn-t-see-operating-system.html#post767041\nI am not sure why your installation failed, but I think sda4 was somehow mounted or in a bad state. I would suggest deleting that partition altogether, and using the \"Use free space\" install method in the \"Installation type\" step. \nAlternatively, delete the partition (using Windows Disk Management tool, for example), and then create it manually as ext4 with mount point \"/\" if you want to. \n", "Q: Find files with a minimum filename length I'd like to find all files in a certain folder which have a filename of at least n characters (extension included). Is there any way to achieve this with find?\n\nA: I think the simplest way is to use:\nfind . -name \"??????????*\"\n\nwhere the number of ? characters is equal with n. Is simple because is hard to forget it.\nBut the nicest way is to use the -regex option to find file names with n or more characters:\nfind . -regextype posix-egrep -regex \".*[^/]{n}\"\n\nwhere n should be a natural number (the minimum filename length).\nSee man find fore more about.\n\nA: You could use the find command with a -regex test\n$ find /path/to/folder -regextype posix-basic -regex '.*/.\\{5,\\}'\n\nor\n$ find /path/to/folder -regextype posix-extended -regex '.*/.{5,}'\n\nNote that -regex is a path match rather than a file match - hence you need to match the leading .*/ as well, before the 5+ character filename\n\nAlternatively, for a pure bash solution, you could enable extended shell globbing and then use the pattern !(@(?|??|???|????)) meaning 'anything that does not match one or two or three or four  characters'\n$ shopt -s extglob\n$ ls -d /path/to/folder/!(@(?|??|???|????))\n\nIf you want to include subdirectories, you can enable the globstar option as well and add a ** wildcard i.e.\n$ shopt -s extglob globstar\n$ ls -d /path/to/folder/**/!(@(?|??|???|????))\n\nfor example\n$ ls -d **/!(@(?|??|???|????))\nabcde  abcdef  abcdefg  subdir  subdir/abcde  subdir/abcdef  subdir/abcdefg\n\nwhile the non inverted matches (files shorter than 5 characters) are \n$ ls -d **/@(?|??|???|????)\na  ab  abc  abcd  subdir/a  subdir/ab  subdir/abc  subdir/abcd\n\nTo unset the options afterwards, use\n$ shopt -u extglob globstar\n\n\nA: Python approach:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nimport os,sys\n\n\ndef main():\n    treeroot = sys.argv[1]\n    base_len = int(sys.argv[2])\n    for dir,subdirs,files in os.walk(treeroot):\n         for f in files: \n             if len(f) >= base_len:\n                 fullpath = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(dir,f))\n                 print(fullpath)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__' : main()\n\nUsage is simple:\n./find_files_len.py /path/to/top_directory/  minimal_length\n\nFor example:\n./find_files_len.py /etc  5 \n\nThat'll give us all files with basename of at least 5 characters , found recursively through /etc/ and all its subdirectories. Note that full path of the file will be printed to the command-line\n\nA: You could loop over the list of files returned by find and test the length of each file's basename:\nmin_fname() {\n    for path in $(find \"$1\" -type f); do \n        bn=\"${path##*/}\"\n        if (( \"${#bn}\" >= $2 )); then \n            echo \"$path\" \n        fi \n    done\n}\n\n# usage: min_fname dir value\n\n$ min_fname /tmp 5\n$ min_fname /home/user 10\n\nThis function uses only find and Bash builtin mechanisms, and no regex matching.

This is the current update manager for 13.10 Unity.\nSoftware Update refers to gnome-update-viewer. \ngnome-update-viewer was still available in 13.04 as part of the Gnome desktop, but has been removed from 13.10. On my fresh install of 13.10, a descriptive listing for it (without the package) shows up in Software Center. Synaptic and apt-cache do not show the package at all. (I had thought Software Center used the apt database, but it must be pulling the info from somewhere else.)\nIf Software Update is the one finding the updates on your system, perhaps you are running the Gnome Desktop rather than Unity or perhaps you upgraded to 13.10 and had it already been installed. So this may be the correct setup for your system. \nIf you need to switch, there should be a backend setting that will take care of it. I would first try reinstalling update-manager with sudo apt-get install --reinstall update-manager.\n", "Q: error: file '/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod' not found I have xubuntu in a computer at the moment, but I want to put Windows 7 on it.

Why do I get Ubuntu error when trying to put up Windows?\n\nA: From where or what do are you trying to boot windows 7 or xp?? If you want to choose between windows 7 or xp and Ubuntu on start up you will need to install windows first and then  Linux on another partition to get a proper grub file. If you reinstall Ubuntu after installing Windows you can choose that you want to install Ubuntu alongside Windows and you should be thine.   \n", "Q: Why do we need to be root in terminal for shutdown and restart? When we install/remove/update packages or make any changes which require administrative privileges we are prompted for the password of admin user who has the sudo privileges - this happens both via GUI and terminal.\n\nHowever, if we try to shutdown and restart via terminal, it complains that we need to be root:\n$ reboot\nreboot: Need to be root\n\n$ shutdown now\nshutdown: Need to be root\n\nBut we are never asked for a password when we perform these actions via the cog-wheel at top right.\n\nWhy is there this discrepancy?\n\nA: The reason you don't need to be root to initiate a shutdown from the GUI is largely a matter of convenience for the typical desktop user. The system knows that you're the user logged in on the console, so if you shut down the computer by mistake, you can presumably turn it back on.\nFor a user in the shell, you might very well be logged in remotely, so the system requires that you be logged in as root in order to issue a shutdown command. This prevents a regular user logged into a server from shutting it down while other people are using it, and while there's not necessarily anybody physically there to start the computer back up.\nThe reason that shutdown doesn't provide a GUI prompt for the super-user password is probably simply that there's no real utility to be gained there - if you are on the console, where the prompt would appear, you could just use the cog-wheeel menu instead. If you wanted to have a command-line prompt for the super-user password for shutdown, that's already available with \"sudo shutdown\".\n\nA: The shutdown on the cog-wheel checks if you are allowed to shutdown the machine. This is done via PolicyKit. In case of shutdown this statement in the file /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.consolekit.policy is checked:\n<action id=\"org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.stop\">\n  <description>Stop the system</description>\n  <message>System policy prevents stopping the system</message>\n  <defaults>\n    <allow_inactive>no</allow_inactive>\n    <allow_active>yes</allow_active>\n  </defaults>\n</action>\n\nThe PolicyKit triggers a dbus-send command. In case of shutdown it would be:\ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.Hal /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.SystemPowerManagement.Shutdown\n\nThere is a daemon running in the background with root-Privileges that invokes the shutdown command for you.\nWhen you want to be able to shutdown the machine \"the old way\" via command line (shutdown, reboot, halt, ...), then you need to add the suid-Bit to those commands. But be aware, everyone on your system, that has access to the shell could then shutdown your machine.\n\nA: In a multi-user system, the last thing you want is your users logging in and being able to randomly reboot the server at any time, thus the command line version of Reboot is a superuser-only command, hence needing you to be root or have sudo rights.\nDitto the Halt and PowerOff commands too.\n\nA: Ubuntu is a distribution of the GNU/Linux Operationg System which in turn belongs to the Unix system family - a common architecture for a number of modern Operating Systems.\nTraditionally Unix used to run on mainframe computers. Central computing facilities which serve dozends or hundreds of users via remote terminals. Since all users relied on the availability of the mainframe, no single user was allowed to issue a shutdown command. An idea that is fundamental to the Unix architecture - the system kernel will never initialise a shutdown unless the according function is called by a superuser process.\nIn contemporary desktop systems developers have gone through certain pains to make the shutdown  available to the mere desktop user. A common technique is, to let the login manager, which usually runs in the security context of the root user, handle shutdown and reboot. In this case the graphical shell issues a request to the login manager to shutdown the computer. This involves using inter process communication (IPC), usually via the dbus service.\nThe above mentioned policykit extends this process by providing a standardised framework through which the login manager (or whatever program provides the shutdown service) can check what users are allowed to cause a shutdown, and through wich an administrator can configure those permissions respectively.\nSome desktop environments don't use IPC-based services but rather a set of helper programs to provide the same or similar functions. Those helper programs would be called through mechanisms, allowing to change into the superuser context, like sudo, suid, or a policykit mechanism similar to sudo.\nIn any case, the dumb traditional shutdown program on the shell doesn't work this way, It requires you to see that it is run in a superuser context.\n\nA: Because Linux is commonly used as a server or similar, and SSHing into a linux box, even a normal Ubuntu laptop, is quite common. \nThing is, you may not want people with SSH access to be able to shut it down, especially when there may be other remotely logged in users using it. Someone with access to the GUI — well, he can shut it down on his own anyway with the physical power button.\nAlso, a remotely logged in user won't be able to turn it back on. \n\nA: \nWhen I reboot via the GUI I can do that without my sudo password.\n\nOnly if you're the only one logged in. If there are any other users (including console users) you may have to enter a root password. This is the same on OS X and newer Windows versions.\n\n\nWhy is that? What's happening internally of the ubuntu system there?\n\nThe following command:\n/usr/bin/dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=\"org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit\" /org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Manager org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Manager.Stop\n\n\nD-Bus is an IPC mechanism - a medium for local communication between processes running on the same host.\nD-Bus is \"smarter\" than low-level message-passing protocols such as UDP. On the other hand, it does carry messages as discrete items—not continuous streams of data.\nD-Bus has a structured view of the data it carries, and deals with data in binary form; integral numbers of various widths, strings, and so on. Because data is not just \"raw bytes\" to D-Bus, messages can be validated.\n-- Free Desktop\n\nWhy doesn't the shutdown command just check if anyone is logged in? That seems an unmercenary feature to be honest. I can imagine it would save time sometimes, but a consistent console is often preferred. I don't want commands to sometimes require a password after running it, and sometimes not.\nMy pronouns are He / Him\n", "Q: Installing Software in recovery mode For some reason I can only successfully boot into recovery mode. I want to install drivers software updates, etc. My question is. If I install these software in recovery mode will they be applies like they normally would in the normal (non-recovery)?\n\nA: Proper way to upgrade/install/update Software in Recovery Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*When your system starts chose Recovery Mode (2nd option in grub menu).\n\n*From the Menu just go to Grub option, it will give a message like Updating grub will mount your system in read/write mode. Just chose yes to mount your system in read/write mode. It will update your grub and will exit from Grub menu.\n\n*chose network option it may enable your network.Note: It would be best if you connected via Wired Network\n\n*Then chose dpkg menu from the list, chose yes for all. It will fix any broken packages.\n\n*Finally chose root option and login. Execute following commands one after another:\n# apt-get autoremove\n# apt-get autoclean\n# apt-get update\n# apt-get -f install\n# apt-get dist-upgrade\n# apt-get upgrade\n\nThen reboot your system and check whether your are able to use Ubuntu or not. Run this command to reboot:\n# reboot\n\nHope either of this method works for you.. Reply if something goes wrong.\n\nA: Why is your system not booting in the normal mode? Do you see any errors or indications why it failed? \nYou can install software in the recovery mode, but there are a couple of things to keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Only / is mounted, so if you have a separate /var, /usr, /home, you need to mount then yourself\n\n*Filesystems are mounted read-only, so you need to remount them using sudo mount -o remount,rw /\n\n*Drivers for your network card or wireless interface may not be loaded\n\n\nPackages installed in the recovery mode do persist in the normal mode. \n", "Q: Problems with networking after suspend I have some problems on my Asus notebook since I upgraded to Ubuntu 13.10:\n\n\n*\n\n*Networking (wifi and lan) won't work after resume from suspend.

If not you can install it with the command sudo apt-get gksu\n$ gksu nautilus           # browse files as root\n$ gksu gedit /etc/fstab   # edit file as root\n\nThis command is a frontend to the su and sudo commands, designed for running graphical programs, so it is used the same way as them. See the man page for more information.\n\nA: \nYou should never use normal sudo to start graphical applications\n  as root. Using sudo with graphical apps has the potential to corrupt\n  your environment by  allowing root to take ownership of and/or change\n  permissions on critical  files that you must own. The forums\n  frequently see panicked requests  for help from users who can no\n  longer log in after running graphical  applications under sudo.\nPlease note that many websites and old threads advise the use of gksu.\n  However, such search results are obsolete. gksudo has not been updated\n  for years and is not even available in Bionic (18.04) and higher. gksu\n  has been replaced by pkexec, but even pkexec is being deprecated by\n  the mainline Ubuntu developers. They have taken  the position that\n  file manipulation and editing under root should be  restricted to the\n  command line.\nWe can only surmise what the motives were behind this decision:\n  perhaps  there are just too many users who run into problems running\n  graphical  apps as root. In any case, running graphical apps as root\n  now requires  workarounds and additional steps.\nFlavour-specific workarounds\nThere are a number of flavour-specific options for running graphical\n  applications as root:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You can use pkexec on those flavours that support this option. As of 18.04, only Xubuntu supports this option by default, as shown in\n  the following examples:\npkexec thunar  \npkexec mousepad /etc/fstab  \n\n  \n*By default, Kubuntu allows easy access to a root file manager: KDE Launcher → Computer → Root-Dolphin\nFrom there: (→ edit file) will open up a root instance of Kate.\n  \n*Mainline\nUbuntu and Gnome use Nautilus as their file manager. Any flavor running Nautilus will allow you to install the package nautilus-admin\n  which will add two python extensions to Nautilus. These extensions add\n  options that allow root access: Open as Administrator and Edit\n  as Administrator\nIt is also possible to install the missing Policykit files for both Nautilus and Gedit. See this\n  site\n  for instructions and links. A     knowledgeable user could build\n  further Policykit files for alternate     file managers and editors by\n  using the linked files as templates. They     are simple XML files\n  that can be edited with a standard text editor.\nGeneral workarounds\nThe following methods will work on all flavors:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Use the command line. Simple text editors like nano are quite easy to    learn. If you prefer a quasi-graphical file manager, install\n  Midnight    Commander. Both of these apps run under sudo with no\n  problems. Examples:\nsudo mc  \nsudo nano /etc/fstab  \n\n  \n*Notwithstanding the earlier warning, it is possible to use sudo with graphical apps provided you add the -H flag. This flag is\n  critical: it properly sets root to its own environment instead of\n  improperly inheriting the user's environment. Use of the -H flag is\n  mandatory. Failing to use this flag may corrupt critical system files\n  and prevent you from logging in.\nWith sudo -H almost any graphical app can be launched under root within any 'buntu flavor. This includes each flavor's default\n  graphical editor and file manager.\nAn appreciable danger with sudo -H is that the -H flag is easy to forget. And all it takes is one omission for the damage to be done.\n\nSource: Ubuntu documentation RootSudo\n", "Q: Cannot boot after Ubuntu 13.10 install on UEFI machine My ultimate goal is to get Ubuntu working on my new Sony Vaio Pro 13, a Haswell ultrabook.  The hardware seems to be well-supported as I can boot a LiveCD and use the system fully for as long as I wish.\nThe Sony Vaio Pro 13 has a UEFI BIOS and seems to be tightly integrated with the Windows 8 which it came preinstalled with.  I have tried multiple ways of installing Ubuntu 13.10 and none get me to a point where I can boot my machine into Ubuntu.  \nWhen performing the installation with the BIOS turned to Legacy mode, near the very end of the installation it crashes hard with a kernel panic (\"not syncing: Attempted to kill init!\").  Installation with UEFI turned on (Secure boot turned off) succeeds perfectly.  However, upon rebooting I simply receive a BIOS screen saying that the Vaio could not boot Windows.  Switching to Legacy mode nets me an 'Operating system not found' error.\nAs far as I can tell, the BIOS on this machine has absolutely no option to bring up a boot selection menu.  When installing in Legacy mode, the Ubuntu installer recognizes that Windows 8 is present and I asked it to install in a dual-boot configuration.  When installing in UEFI mode, the installer recognized the previously attempted Ubuntu installation (which failed with a kernel panic) but did not mention Windows 8 at all.  I asked the installer to erase the prior Ubuntu install and replace it.  The install succeeded without issue, but left my system in a state where it can not boot to either Ubuntu or Windows 8.  I'm not terribly concerned about preserving Windows 8, but I would like to be able to boot SOME OS to use the machine...  Right now I'm just using the LiveCD which works perfectly.\nI'm an experienced Linux user and software developer, but I'm not very familiar with the changes UEFI brings with it.  Is there a way for me to check if GRUB is present on the disk?  Is there a way to force reinstallation of it?\n\nA: Your Boot Repair output looks OK to me -- as far as I can tell, you should be booting to GRUB when the computer starts up. It could be you've got buggy firmware, though, so you might check Sony's Web site for an update. (Of course, if you need to boot Windows to update the firmware, that could get ugly.) If you can update the firmware but the problem persists, re-running Boot Repair might fix the problem.\nAnother thing you can try is preparing a CD-R or USB flash drive with my rEFInd boot manager. (There are download links for both media types on that site.) If rEFInd boots, it should provide a menu with various options. The Windows option should work, as should an Ubuntu option that boots via GRUB. There should also be at least one option to boot a vmlinuz* file. This one won't work unless you hit F2 or Insert twice to edit the kernel options. Adding ro root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root should work. If you can get into Linux via rEFInd, you can try installing the rEFInd Debian package. Ordinarily, this would set up rEFInd as your default boot manager, thus solving your problem. (This will also obviate the need to add kernel options manually.) Unfortunately, given the nature of your problem, I'm not sure this will work for you, but it's worth a try.\nIf installing rEFInd to your hard disk doesn't work, you could keep fiddling with EFI firmware settings in an effort to find a workaround. Check the Installing rEFInd Manually and Alternative Naming Options sections of the rEFInd documentation for some ideas. Alternatively, if a USB flash drive does the job as a workaround, you could buy a small USB flash drive to hold rEFInd and leave it permanently installed in one of your computer's USB ports. (Some drives are very small -- nearly flush when fully inserted.)\nOne more comment: Your Boot Repair output indicates inconsistent naming of the volume group that holds your root (/) filesystem. Sometimes it's /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root, but other times it's /dev/mapper/ubuntu-vg-root. It looks to me like the former is correct and the latter is a result of a bug in the Boot Repair script itself, but it's worth keeping this inconsistency in mind. I vaguely recall hearing of a case in the past when somebody used a dash (-) in a volume group name and it caused problems, but I don't recall the details. It's unlikely that this is the source of your current problem, since it sounds like nothing that could read the volume group is even launching, but if you get rEFInd or GRUB to launch but then run into problems getting the system to fully boot, you might just try deleting the whole physical volume and re-installing again, this time using a volume group name that lacks a dash.\n\nA: I could not get Linux to boot with GPT disk partitions.  Perhaps switching the BIOS boot mode from UEFI to Legacy also removes GPT support.  After writing a new partition table, in traditional MBR (MSDOS) format, I could boot.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Except sometime (once in a million) the laptop would boot. Do all the things you did, legacy mode etc, and then do this.\nIt was easily fixed by adding \nlibata.force=noncq\n\nto the Kernel options. You can do this by pressing e on the grub menu and adding this to the line that starts with linux, so that it looks something like:\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-3.x.x-xx-generic root=UUID=0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 ro    quiet splash libata.force=noncq $vt_handoff\n\nThen press F10 to continue.\nOnce you've booted edit the grub config so that the changes are permeneant.\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nthen replace\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nwith:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash libata.force=noncq\"\n\nand run\nsudo update-grub\n\nThen reboot.\nThere maybe some useful information here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sony_Vaio_Pro_SVP-1x21\n", "Q: Wireless not connecting on Ubuntu 13.10, Toshiba Satellite pro L 650 I have just installed Ubuntu 13.10 on my Toshiba Satellite Pro L650.

I want to replace the synaptic icon (although it could be any other).\nI have found the Desktop Entry, Icon Theme and Icon Naming specifications that gnome follows (somewhat?), but even though I've been reading for a while now, the time has come to ask.\nIn /usr/share/applications there is \"Synaptic Package Manager\", and it contains Icon=synaptic. Now, I kinda guess that I maybe know that the dock uses the 48x48 size of icons, but when I put both \"synaptic.svg\" and \"synaptic.png\" (because I don't know how to figure out which extension is being looked for), even a plain \"synaptic\" in my 48x48 theme folder (and others, and other themes... etc, even using ~/.icons to be sure it gets looked up first), guess what?\nThe icon doesn't change.\nNot even after a lot of gtk-update-icon-cache whatevertheme both in usr/share/icons and in $HOME/.icons\nI'm a bit confused.

It does not matter what extension has icon (.svg, .png, etc), the important thing is that the path to the new icon (inclusive its extension) to be introduced correctly.\nThat should be enough.\n\nA: To change the icon of an application it is often better to just use a custom .desktop file in the user's home directory rather than changing icon files in the system-wide icon themes. It is also advisable to not edit a .dektop file in /usr/share/applications as this may be reset any time (e.g. by an update).\nA good approach to display a different icon, and without the need of root permissions or tampering with root directories is to just copy any application's .desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications. \nWe can then edit the desktop file with any editor to change the path to our custom icon:\nIcon=/full/path/to/icon  # or name of icon\n\nWe have to grant this .desktop file permission \"Allow executing file as program\".\nAfter logging out and log back in the settings in ~/.local/share/applications will override system wide settings and our desired icon will be displayed.\n", "Q: Samsung 305u notebook touchpad not working in Ubuntu 13.10 I just installed Ubuntu 13.10 on my Samsung 305u notebook. \nThe problem is that the touchpad (cursor and clicking) doesn't work, it does nothing.

(Libraries, codecs (If this is even a Linux concept) linked to a relative location), to be used on a system without a package manager, or similar system installed?\nI often use a customised Ubuntu LiveCD (that has a broken Rhythmbox install on, and I have lost the source to recreate) on different computers, and thought it would be easier to have the media player on a flash drive, instead of having to (presumably) install this other one on the TMPFS, or perform (after I figure out what is wrong) adjustments to the TMPFS to get the existing media player install running as expected, after each startup.\n\nA: Well, there is this MoviX GNU/Linux distribution, which is a few megabyte big and you are supposed to burn it onta CD or DVD together with some media files. When booting it would simply play the media files from the live medium and spare you the hassle of making sure the buddys to which you hand a movie CD have appropriate media codecs installed.\nOther than that... well in a distribution without a package manager you are normally supposed to compile mplayer or VLC or whatever you like on your own.\nYou can use a normal desktop system to compile any of those media players using the -static flag. This allows you to copy the resulting program to any system, where needed libraries are not installed.\nI'm not aware of any project which offeres precompiled statical binaries of media players nor am I aware of any GNU/Linux media player with a windows-style binary installer.\n\nA: All Ubuntu desktop distributions come with a media player accessible from a live session. Even the leightweight Lubuntu distribution is able to play audio and video from a live session without the need of any other additional applications.\nSome non-free codecs to allow playing media content encoded with these may not be included in the base installation system. If that is the case you will have the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot a live system and then always download and install codecs needed from within the live session.\n\n*Make a bootable USB drive with persistence to put your codecs in.\n\n*Install Ubuntu to an USB drive with all customizations you need to carry with you.\n\n*Make your own customized live  CD.\n\n\nIt may also be an option for you to keep the codecs (and their dependencies) needed on a removable drive to install from there on machines which do not have an internet connection. But note that you will not be able to use these packages on machines with another architecture or running a different distribution then.\nAll media players have dependencies not only on (optional) codecs but also on various other packages, including the sound architecture, the multi-media framework, or a sound server used. These dependencies are often far more data than the actual media player. This also true for so called light weight or command line media players. Therefore a self-containing media player package is a rather odd thing to have.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Start menu Shutdown/Restart have the same function I am using Ubuntu 13.10.

I used partition editor to shrink my home partition by 2GB. Now I want to take the unallocated space and add it to sda1. I can't figure out how to accomplish this.\n(This is an old question where I found an answer - below. It has been suggested that it is a duplicate of How to resize partitions?, but this isn't exactly the case. I was using gparted but my problem turned out to be connected to the swap.)\n\nA: I found the answer in a brilliant suggestion:\nGParted wont resize extended partitions\nThe problem was that although I hadn't mounted the disk, the swap partition which is inside the extended partition was still being used. I had to boot from the disk on key (as usual) but then right click on the swap partition and turn off the swap.\nThen I could resize my extended partition and shrink it by the 2 GB. Since I had 2 GB of unallocated data, it took 30 seconds. Then I could take the unallocated space which was no longer part of the extended partition and add it to sda1 by resizing sda1. That took a minute or so.\nThe price of shrinking down sda6 by 2 GB I had already paid. That was expensive as it took some 5+ hours. In any case it is done and it works. Gparted is a great tool!\n\nA: Your unallocated is inside the extended partition. You should be able to move the start of the unallocated to the start of sda6. Then you will have unallocated outside of the extended that you can add to sda1.\nBut why are you using 12GB with a separate /home? I have my /home inside my / with 10GB used and 2 or 3GB of that is .wine for Picasa. But all my data is in separate data partitions. May be time to houseclean?\nAnother choice is to shrink /home by 20 or 25GB and create another / partition for your new install.\n\nA: It is worthwhile to grow your / partition if you can... but when that's not possible, or if you'd like to put it off for a bit, a workaround is possible. On a couple of my machines I normally mount /var/cache/apt to a folder on a different partition for use during upgrade.\nfor example, if /home is a different partition\nsudo mkdir /home/cache\nsudo cp -a /var/cache/apt /home/cache/apt\nsudo mount -o bind /home/cache/apt /var/cache/apt\n\nAfter that dist-upgrade usually works.\n", "Q: Is there any way for me to be able to get my surround back to my G930 Headset? I have a Logitech G930 headset. I recently decided to go 100% full on ubuntu, and i am loving it so far. However, this is sadly the only thing i've hit a brick wall with. I have googled ways to find drivers for the logitech G930 or get Logitech gaming software to work.\nNormally this would not be a issue, but when you have surround turned off on the logitech G930 it sounds plastic and horrible. Is there ANY way to get this to work?\nBest regards, Marco.\n\nA: Unfortunately, at the moment, the drivers only support analog and digital stereo, as you can see here.\n", "Q: Two monitors when only having one in 13.10 I just did a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.10 64bit, and it says that I have 2 monitors, when I actually only have one\n\nI have a Dell XPS 15 with Nvidia graphics card if that helps in anyway\n\nA: I am not an expert but I had the same problem. I have finally find the solution on this forum (here).\nFirst, enter xrandr in your terminal. You will see that there are several outputs which are connected. The LVDS1 is your laptop's screen.\nNormally, there is another outpout called VGA-1 orVGA-2 which is also connected. You have to note the name of this output.\nThen, edit your grub with gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub and add video=VGA-1:d (VGA-1 is the name of the wrong output) in the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX line (you must have something like GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"video=VGA-1:d\").\n\n\n*\n\n*If your output is called like VGA-1-1, set video=VGA-1:d (setting video=VGA-1-1:d won't work).\n\n*If your output is called like VGA-1-2, set video=VGA-2:d (setting video=VGA-1-2:d or video=VGA-1:d does not seem to work, although one may still try them out separately to be certain).\nThen update your grub with sudo update-grub and reboot.\n\nA: See my suggestion in Mouse cursor flickering with ubuntu 13.10. Installing Bumblebee got rid of the unwanted display and flickering mouse cursor. xrandr -q also displayed only the correct displays whereas before installing BB, it showed the built-in display as well as an extra VGA-1-1 as being connected.\n", "Q: PHP is not working well on Ubuntu 13.10 and mcrypt is missing in phpmyadmin I've upgraded from UBUNTU 13.04 to 13.10 but I can not work with PHP pages or phpmyadmin .\nI've tried this way to install lamp on Ubuntu sudo apt-get install lamp-server^ phpmyadmin\nand I've done all of the configuration correctly after installation I've added this line  Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf to  /etc/apache2/apache2.conf then I restarted apache2 \nNow I have two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*In phpmyadmin on the bottom of the page is this error : The mcrypt extension is missing.

For example, if you are using the Laravel 4 framework, the artisan CLI will detect mcrypt.ini in /etc/php5/mods-available/, but the framework itself seems to look for it in /etc/php5/conf.d/. You need a copy of it in both locations for everything to work:\ncp -i /etc/php5/conf.d/mcrypt.ini /etc/php5/mods-available/\nsudo php5enmod mcrypt\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\nA: Actually the right place for mcrypt.ini file is in mods-available directory not in conf.d.

The fdisk warnings about entries not being in disk order and about partition 1 not starting on a cylinder boundary can be ignored. (In fact, the second of these identifies your version of fdisk as being pretty ancient. I recommend you upgrade.)\nSecond, Linux uses memory that's not otherwise being used for buffers and caches to improve performance. On such a system, it's not uncommon for nearly all available memory to be in use, with little or no use of swap space. For instance, here's the output of free on one of my computers:\n$ free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          7469       7380         89          0        124       3847\n-/+ buffers/cache:       3407       4062\nSwap:         6143        717       5426\n\nYou might think that memory was being nearly maxed out (7469MiB in use and only 89MiB free), with little use of swap space. You need to pay attention to the -/+ buffers/cache line, though; that line tells you how much memory is being used by programs. In this case, it's less than half the available memory.

Right now I am trying to figure out TrueCrypt and Spotify.\nMy first attempt at asking for advice was regarding TrueCrypt and can be found on r/linux4noobs. Unfortunately I didn't get any responses.\nTrueCrypt recommends checking the integrity of the installation tarball by downloading a signature, importing and signing their public key, and using something like 'gpg --verify'. I can download TrueCrypt's public PGP key directly from their website (sort of over HTTPS, but there doesn't appear to be any sort of SSL cert -- public key download) and confirm that it is the same one as is on MIT's PGP server. But since I haven't signed anyone else's PGP key, there's no way for me to know that the signatures that I see on MIT's PGP server for TrueCrypt are reliable. (I mean, I assume that they are, but that's not a great solution.) So it feels like there must be some way to bootstrap this process (without going to a keysigning event) for someone like me who just wants to check the integrity of software that I download. I now realize the importance of keysigning events, but it seems there should be another way as well. For example, why don't people/groups provide their public keys over HTTPS, using SSL certs as a bootstrapping mechanism?\nIn a similar vein, I am trying to install Spotify natively. They recommend adding their key using:\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 94558F59\n\nBut I assume this all happens in the clear, without any signing. Checking signatures on their key, I used the following:\n$ sudo apt-key adv --list-sigs\n\n...\n\npub   2048R/94558F59 2012-06-25 [expires: 2015-06-25]\nuid                  Spotify Public Repository Signing Key <operations@spotify.com>\nsig 3        94558F59 2012-06-25  Spotify Public Repository Signing Key <operations@spotify.com>\n\nIt appears that the only signature is a self-signature. Again, I'm left feeling that I'm just kicking the can down the road. Sure, I'll be able to verify that the software I download was signed by the private key associated with the public key that I signed, but how do I gain confidence that the public key that I received belonged to who I thought it did?\nI apologize for the wall of text, and if the answer is to read about PGP, I'm happy to. And I apologize for omitting links. Apparently without reputation only 2 links are allowed.\nThanks in advance for any help you can provide.\n\nA: TrueCrypt\nTheir key is available on the keyservers (for example on Ubuntu's). It has also quite a bunch of signatures, so you could be able to build a trust path to that key.\nBuilding a trust path cannot work if you do not trust any other keys. Going to some keysigning event (or just find some guys to sign key's with, have a look at biglumber is the best way for being able to trust in their key.\nAnother chance would be to trust CAcert respectively their OpenPGP key. They're also signing OpenPGP keys and have a huge reputation in the web of trust. But it requires trusting them, decide yourself -- I do.\nSpotify\nChecking the key on various keyservers confirms your concerns, they did not do any keysigning. There is no way to find a trust path between you and Spotify.\nAn advantages still available: If you trust that key (gpg --edit-key 94558F59, then trust), you will be able to realize future changes of the key. You do not know if the key is really owned by Spotify right now, but nobody will be able to trick you into bad software in future (given that you had the right key right now).\nYou also might want to report a bug to Spotify that they should get their key signed.\n", "Q: New search tab page on Chromium defaults to \"fvdsearch?

You will not only have the version that others indicated, but also future versions updated automatically.\nThe appropriate entry for /etc/apt/sources.list would be, according to the documentation:\ndeb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib\n\nAddendum\nThis answer of mine tries to keeping in spirit with the \"don't install packages from source if you don't have to\" and to \"stay only with packages from curated repositories\". This applies in general and also especially for the case of security-minded people asking/learning about security.\nAlso, installing things from source and compiling yourself without them being in a Debian package makes dpkg (and higher level tools, like apt and aptitude) not aware of removing libraries that the tools depend on, like libpcap and OpenSSL (via libssl-variants).\nThere is a high probability of programs breaking when one of their underlying libraries is removed from the system (like OpenSSL pre-1.1 to OpenSSL 1.1 or any other library transition at all).\nI understand that a Debian package may not have existed at the time the question was asked, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*Asking in Debian or Ubuntu for a package like this is a very good way to have it included not only in your Ubuntu release but with high probability, in future ones, so that you can keep using the program.\n\n*Packaging programs is a very nice way to learn about the programs and your system in general and there are nice folks (including yours truly) that are always willing to help people enrich our distributions.\n\n*Expanding on the point above, when a package gets included in the distribution, its compiled/prepared version becomes available to every user of the distribution and it obviates the need of \"I have the program and can send it to you privately\". This is a contribution in the true spirit of \"Free Software and giving back to the community\" (even though I understand that, sometimes, you may simply want to use something quickly).\n\n*Once the package gets approved in Debian or Ubuntu, it can become available \"forever\" for future reference, since a snapshot of both its source version as well as its binary version are present at snapshot.debian.org\n\nA: apt-get install libssl-dev\n\napt-get install libpcap0.8-dev\n\nthen try make.\n", "Q: pdf comments and insert / delete / extract pages in Evince I use Evince / Ubuntu 12.04 at home.\nI use(d) all Windows up to 7 except Vista at work.\nPDFs are more widespread each year.\nEvince is a great reader.\nBusiness use needs Office and Acrobat Standard capabilities.\nOpen Office / Libre Office work great.\nI use pdf mod to delte / add / combine pdfs.\nTrue comments in pdfs seems to be missing.\nIt would be better to have a native app vs a wine app.\nAre there plans to add commenting and insert / extract / delete page capabilities to Evince?\nSeems like that a serious missing part of Ubuntu / Linux. \n\nA: I do not know about Evince plans, but used this link to get \"pdf-edit\" software filtered to Linux platform.\nhttp://alternativeto.net/tag/pdf-editor/?platform=linux\nWhat seems to be a nice app is PdfMod.

I have a couple of premade Win2k3 VMs that I need to use for some application testing that need to be run at the same time on the same machine. I'm running 13.04 Desktop and do this often with VirtualBox, whereby I run multiple instances at the same time.\nI assumed that I could do the same with VMWare Player (I have version 6), but quickly noticed that by default it only allows me to run one instance.\nIs there a way to run multiple guests at the same time from Player? I do have an eSXI server that I normally might use, but I need to be portable and it would be preferable to just have these run at the same time...\n\nA: Unlike VirtualBox, by default with VMware Player if one tries to launch a second instance (e.g. another machine that you want to run at the same time), the original running machine comes into focus and one doesn't get to the 'library\" list. One never is able to get back to interface in 'home' state where you can choose the machine while a machine is running. After some experimentation, I did discover that one can do an ALT+F2 and type in \"vmplayer\" and get to the machine picker mode... from there, one can indeed run another machine... I think I just need to create launchers specific to my machines....\n\nA: Since the latest VirtualBox was having visual issues with Ubuntu 14.10 (At least until a new virtualbox comes out), I used VMWare PLayer to practice some Server-Client stuff. Since I needed at least 2 Guests, the way I opened multiple VMs with VMWare was to simply middle click the VMWare icon on the Launcher or simply open another VMWare in dash.\nThis is the same mouse button which closes browser tabs or opens Chrome/Firefox links in another tab. In my case it is the scroll wheel button.\nFrom there I used a different VM since opening the same VM on different VMWare players can create a problem. Here is an image of how it looks right now:\n\nA couple of tips regarding this:\n\n\n*\n\n*VMWare Player does NOT come with an easy to use multiple VM management window for simultaneous VMs. It only has the main window where it offers which VM you want to run and that's it. You have to open one VMWare Player for each VM. Big difference when compared to VirtualBox for example where the main window stays independent of how many VMs you end up running (I have tested at least 8 VMs at the same time). So you need to open an additional VMWare Player for each VM you wish to run.\n\n*Doing CTRL+ALT to escape a VM sometimes will make the Ubuntu HUD appear on the host. To make this less annoying, do the key combination backwards, like ALT+CTRL\n\n*Make sure that no VM is sharing any resource with another VM (Like a HDD, CDROM or Webcam), because they might have issues, especially if it is the same Virtual HDD they are sharing.\n\n*As a comparison I did between VirtualBox and VMWare in Ubuntu Discourse the more VMWare Players you have, the more blood sucking cpu/memory draining VMs you will have as shown in the image below:\n\nI am currently running only 3 VMs, two are assigned 2GB of RAM and one 4 GB. So if you are running one VM, you can easily choose between VirtualBox or VMWare Player, but if you are looking into creating a virtual network on guest VMs, VMWare Player would not be recommended over VirtualBox. In my particular case, I would rather wait until VirtualBox has correct support for Ubuntu 14.10 than having to stay with VMWare Player.\n\nA: VMware Player runs virtual machines in a separate window. VMware Player includes features that enable users to create and configure their own virtual machines for optimal performance and access any devices connected to their PC. \nUse VMware Player to create virtual machines with the latest 32-bit and 64-bit Windows and Linux operating systems. With Easy Install it’s easier than installing them directly on your PC.\nVMware Player can be used by anyone to run virtual machines on a Windows or Linux PC. VMware Player makes it quick and easy to take advantage of the security, flexibility, and portability of virtual machines.VMware Player\nYes its possible to run multiple OS's with it at the same time. I have XUbunutu 13.10 running as host, with Windows 8, Ubuntu 13.10, Ubuntu 12.04, and Fedora 20.\nAlso you may take a look at Run Multiple Operating Systems At Once With VMware Player for more info.\n\nA: Based on this answer to my only slightly related question, it seems like it should be possible, but only with VMware Workstation.\nWhile I asked about running identical VMs simultaneously, the answer indicates that VMware Player requires an extension of some kind called Workstation in order to run multiple guests on the same host.\nI wish I could be more helpful, but this might at least get you close ;-)\n", "Q: changing 'switch language keys' no longer working in 13.10 I have Ubuntu 13.10 installed.\nfrom Text Entry Settings I added Arabic to keyboard layouts then tried to change the 'Switch to next source using: ' field.

If Windows isn't already installed,\n  install it first.\n\nSo it sounds like you need to recovering GRUB after reinstalling Windows. Ubuntu provides the instructions at this location:\nReinstalling GRUB 2\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#Reinstalling_GRUB_2\nI hope this will help you. Good luck.\n", "Q: Do I need JDK & JRE in Ubuntu? In Windows 7 I had to install jdk & jre to program with eclipse. In the software center I can only find OpenJDK Java 7 Runtime. Do I need both to program in eclipse?\n\nA: Open up your terminal and type:\njava -version\nYou will have to install it if your program is not found. Take a look at these instructions: \nHow to Install Oracle Java JRE on Ubuntu Linux\n\nA: A simpler way for beginners is to install oracle JDK via a PPA : http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html\nJust three lines, copy-pasted will give you the desired functionality\n", "Q: Why is \"libunity-scopes-json-def-desktop\" part of non-Unity flavors in 13.10? OS: Lubuntu 13.10, clean install.\nI noticed an update for libunity-scopes-json-def-desktop. To find out what that is, I ran apt-cache show libunity-scopes-json-def-desktop and saw this, in part:\n[10:44 AM] ~ $ apt-cache show libunity-scopes-json-def-desktop\nPackage: libunity-scopes-json-def-desktop\nPriority: optional\nSection: gnome\nInstalled-Size: 52\nMaintainer: Ubuntu Core Developers <ubuntu-devel-discuss@lists.ubuntu.com>\nArchitecture: all\nSource: libunity\nVersion: 7.1.2+13.10.20131010-0ubuntu2\n...\n...\nDescription-en: binding to get places into the launcher - desktop def file\n libunity is a shared library to be able to interact with the launcher\n and add places in Unity environment.\n...\n This package contains default scopes definition for the destkop.\n...\n...\nTask: ubuntu-desktop, ubuntu-usb, edubuntu-desktop, edubuntu-usb, xubuntu-desktop, lubuntu-desktop, ubuntustudio-desktop, ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n\nIs the presence of this package in Lubuntu and other non-Unity flavors intentional?\n\nA: It is not just libunity-scopes-json-def-desktop. There are other Unity-related packages as well. I looked at /var/log/apt/history.log and found:\n\ngir1.2-unity-5.0                  GObject introspection data for the Unity library\nlibunity-protocol-private0        binding to get places into the launcher - private library\nlibunity-scopes-json-def-desktop  binding to get places into the launcher - desktop def file\nlibunity9                         binding to get places into the launcher - shared library\n\nLooking at the output ofapt-cache showpkg libunity9, for example, shows that several common, \"cross-environment\" packages such as deja-dup, empathy, evolution, psensor, and thunderbird,  carry libunity9 as a dependency. And libunity9 has some of the Unity packages listed above as dependencies.\nIn other words, having these Unity packages present in a non-Unity desktop is quite understandable.\n", "Q: phpliteadmin cant find sqlite3 I installed sqlite3 using sudo apt-get install sqlite3.

To answer your second question though, by default you have to use the bootloader (GRUB) that comes with Linux, as the Windows bootloader won't recognize the linux distribution.  There have been posts online about configuring the Windows bootloader with the information to boot a Linux distro, but I'm not sure how relevant they are to Windows 8.\nAs for your three primary partitions, I would venture that one is the boot partition for Windows 8 (as Windows 7 used that type of setup), and one is probably the recovery partition for your computer. So, you'll want to resize the main data partition (C:). Ubuntu Should do this for you, if you run the installation from a Live CD.\n", "Q: How can I change my graphics card power profile?

Then the upgrade prompted me:\nCancel the running upgrade?\nThe system could be in an unusable state if you cancel the upgrade. \nYou are strongly advised to resume the upgrade.\n\nI selected Cancel Upgrade and now the upgrade is frozen (not stuck as before). I don't know the name of the process so I cannot kill it through the gnome-system-monitor.\nAlso, I noticed that the menu bars have disappeared from open windows.\n\nUpdate\nI restarted lightdm with sudo service lightdm restart and that seemingly solved the graphical issues at the time. dpkg still would not run since another process was using it. Then the computer became extremely slow and froze (felt like I was using windows!). I decided to alt+sys rec+REISUB.\nWhen the System tried to start up, there was this following message:\nFilesystem check or mount failed.\nA maintenance shell will now be started.\nCONTROL-D will terminate this shell and continue booting after re-trying\nfilesystems. Any further errors will be ignored.\n\nNo matter what I do, ctrl+d returns the following message:\nexit\nmountall start/starting\nFilesystem check or mount failed.\nA maintenance shell will now be started.\nCONTROL-D will terminate this shell and continue booting after re-trying\nfilesystems. Any further errors will be ignored.\n\nI tried booting in recovery mode and selected to repair system using dpkg and that got stuck in the same place the upgrade was stuck.\nGoing back into the maintenance shell, I tried:\n$ fsck\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\ne2fsck 1.42.8 (20-Jun-2013)\n/dev/sda2: clean, 679749/18587648 files, 51278336/74323968 blocks\n\nThen I tried:\n$ fsck -f\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\ne2fsck 1.42.8 (20-Jun-2013)\nPass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes\nPass 2: Checking directory structures\nPass 3: Checking directory connectivity\nPass 4: Checking reference counts\nPass 5: checking group summary information\n/dev/sda2: 679749/18587648 files(0.3% non-contiguous), 51278336/74323968 blocks\n\nRight now I am using 12.10 via a thumbdrive I had lying around. Tried to repair file system using:\n$ sudo fsck -t ext4 /dev/sdb2\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\ne2fsck 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)\next2fs_check_if_mount: Input/output error while determining whether /dev/sdb2 \nis mounted.\n/dev/sdb2: clean, 679749/18587648 files, 51278336/74323968 blocks\n\nI made sure the partition was unmounted before trying that of course.\n\nAfter trying mount -o remount, rw / and using the recommended dpkg --configure -a in the maintenance shell, it seem to continue upgrading where it left off (that made it pass where it was stuck on prior attempts). However, it seems to have aborted due to too many errors. I then restarted the system and it booted fine (I was happy at that point).

I have a 32-bit EeePC with 4GB RAM. Can I install Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit on it? I want to know whether I should install Ubuntu 32-bit or 64-bit before I download the iso.\n\nA: The above answer doesn't quite apply to Ubuntu. Ubuntu can use physical address extensions:\nhttp://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-decide-if-you-should-use-32bit-or-64bit-ubuntu#.UnFNYfmnqQk.\nIt really boils down to what software you use. eeePC is pretty standard stuff on the inside , so no driver issues on 32 or 64 bit. Also the oldest eeePCs do not support 64bit (I'm assuming yours does). Either is good, 32 with pae or 64bit. I'd go with 32bit since I'm assuming that working memory sets will be slightly more compact and memory use will be more efficient. However, Ubuntu recommends 64 bit in this article, so unless you are planning on being tight on ram, 64bit execution will be faster: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/32bit_and_64bit\n\nA: To get all the bang for your buck you should install the 64 bit system.  While the 32 bit can make use of 4 gigs, this refers to TOTAL addressable memory.  This can include graphics cards, system memory etc etc.  This doesn't mean you can't use 32 bit, it'll run; it just won't make use of all your resources.  Go with 64.\nFor an explanation of all this 32-64 bit stuff, check this article out: http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/clearing-up-the-3264-bit-memory-limit-confusion/3124\n", "Q: upgrade from ubuntu 13.04 to 13.10 causes vmware workstation 9 problems So, upgrading caused problem where running VMware Ws 9 needed patches to accommodate linux kernel 3.11.

Chances are it's the fact that the Boot Info Script is saying that GRUB is looking on /dev/sda1 (an NTFS partition) for its configuration file. It was probably an error in your manual GRUB installation that caused this problem. Running Boot Repair is likely to be the easiest way to fix this problem.\nIf you're still booting straight to Windows, try checking your firmware's boot options concerning which disk to boot. GRUB is installed in the first disk (/dev/sda), but if your firmware is set to boot from the second disk (/dev/sdb), that might explain a boot direct to Windows. If this is your problem and you fix it, though, you'll probably end up with GRUB problems and need to run Boot Repair, as just described.\n", "Q: Network doesn't work after upgrading to 13.10 I upgraded from 13.04 to 13.10, and a number of things stopped working.\nMost importantly, I don't have internet access anymore.

I seem to have Flash player plugin installed in both chromium and firefox (I haven't tried chrome though, I'll try it later to see what happens) I don't know if that's enough but I just need to fix that bug. Could someone advice me to do something? Is there anything I can do?\n\nA: Chrome has flash built-in.  You will have to uninstall flash since Chrome may have issues with trying to deal with two versions of Flash.\nI currently use Chrome and find the built-in flash good.\nChromium, the open source version of Chrome, does not have built-in flash.  Therefore, you will have to download Chrome directly from Google.\nThe other option is to create a RAMDisk.  RAMDisk can speed up flash videos.  Furthermore, 64-bit Ubuntu seems to be faster than 32-bit Ubuntu.  Although, the computer must be able to support 64-bit.\nAdobe stopped providing updates for Flash.  Therefore, Chrome is the only way to keep up-to-date with the latest flash versions in Linux.\nAs for me, I have used Firefox, Chromium, and Chrome.  Chrome works the best.  Unfortunately, I had to uninstall PulseAudio and install ALSA.  PulseAudio was causing some issues with some flash games.  The volume control kept going on then mute which caused some issues.\nFrom what I understand, Flash works best with ALSA.  In any case, trial and error maybe the only way to find out what works best in your system.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Evince 3.10 with menubar I find that the 2 buttoms menu from  the  evince v3.10.0 are  not really useful.\nWhy did ubuntu NOT re add an menubar?.

(using ssh) once per computer restart a window dialog appeared containing a textbox for inserting my SSH passphrase and confirmed with OK. Then the passphrase was no longer required until the next start of my system.\nAfter upgrading to 13.10\nAfter upgrading to Ubuntu 13.10 that window doesn't appear anymore but a message in terminal appears:\nEnter passphrase for key '/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa': \n\n...every time when cloning a git repository this appears.\nHow can I fix this? I want to enter my passphrase only once.\n\nA: Short answer\nUse AddKeysToAgent and add the following to your .ssh/config at the beginning:\nAddKeysToAgent yes\n\nand run git/ssh/... If it's not enough, check your ssh version and check that ssh-agent is loaded with these instructions:\n1) Check the openssh version\nFirstly check that your ssh version, it must be greater of equal to 7.2:\nssh -V\n\n2) Edit the config file\nIf it's the case just add in your .ssh/config one line at the beginning:\nAddKeysToAgent yes\n\nOther options are no (the default), yes, confirm (optionally followed by a time interval), ask or a time interval.\n3) Check if ssh-agent is already open\nUsually distributions automatically load an ssh-agent. To check it, run\nps aux | grep -v grep | grep ssh-agent\n\nIf you don't see any line containing it, you need to load it by running:\neval $(ssh-agent)\n\nNote that this enable the agent only on the current terminal, so to enable it everywhere, you can try to add this line in your ~/.profile file and reboot.\n\nA: I've spend far too long to get it running on WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04. Finally, we need to start ssh-agent on spawning new console, but don't load a key then. Load key upon first usage and use AddKeysToAgent.\nAdd following at the end of your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:\nSSH_ENV=\"$HOME/.ssh/agent-environment\"\n\nfunction start_agent {\n    /usr/bin/ssh-agent | sed 's/^echo/#echo/' > \"${SSH_ENV}\"\n    chmod 600 \"${SSH_ENV}\"\n    . \"${SSH_ENV}\" > /dev/null\n}\n\nif [ -f \"${SSH_ENV}\" ]; then\n    . \"${SSH_ENV}\" > /dev/null\n    #ps ${SSH_AGENT_PID} doesn't work under cywgin\n    ps -ef | grep ${SSH_AGENT_PID} | grep ssh-agent$ > /dev/null || {\n        start_agent;\n    }\nelse\n    start_agent;\nfi\n\n\nNote that /usr/bin/ssh-add; is deliberately missing here, comparing\nto original script.\n\nAnd add following at the end of ~/.ssh/config file:\nHost *\n   AddKeysToAgent yes\n\n\nA: This Atlassian document (archive.org backup) fixed the issue for me on Ubuntu 14.04 Server Edition:\nJust add this values into your .bashrc file:\nSSH_ENV=$HOME/.ssh/environment\n   \n# start the ssh-agent\nfunction start_agent {\n    echo \"Initializing new SSH agent...\"\n    # spawn ssh-agent\n    /usr/bin/ssh-agent | sed 's/^echo/#echo/' > \"${SSH_ENV}\"\n    echo succeeded\n    chmod 600 \"${SSH_ENV}\"\n    . \"${SSH_ENV}\" > /dev/null\n    /usr/bin/ssh-add\n}\n   \nif [ -f \"${SSH_ENV}\" ]; then\n     . \"${SSH_ENV}\" > /dev/null\n     ps -ef | grep ${SSH_AGENT_PID} | grep ssh-agent$ > /dev/null || {\n        start_agent;\n    }\nelse\n    start_agent;\nfi\n\nAnd after logging in, it asks for password only once and it caches.

When adding a new private key you will be prompted for the passphrase once and only once. \nAnd then:\n$ ssh-add /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa\nEnter passphrase for /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa: \nIdentity added: /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa)\n\n...where username is your username. You can do the same using $USER variable:\n$ ssh-add /home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nAlternatively, just use ~ for your home directory.\n$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nAnd the problem was fixed.\n\nA: I use this:\nvim ~/.profile\n\neval `/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=pkcs11,secrets,ssh,gpg`\nexport SSH_AUTH_SOCK\nexport GPG_AGENT_INFO\n\n\nA: If you use azure .ppk file\nJust convert it to pem and add permission 400 with simple steps:\nsudo apt-get install putty\nputtygen <path_to_key>/keyname.ppk -O private-openssh -o <path>/aws_key.pem\nsudo chmod 400 <path>/aws_key.pem\nssh -vi aws_key.pem ubuntu@<ip_address>\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 18.04, the ssh-agent is started when the session X is opened, it is managed in the file /etc/X11/Xsession.options:\n# cat /etc/X11/Xsession.options\n# $Id: Xsession.options 189 2005-06-11 00:04:27Z branden $\n#\n# configuration options for /etc/X11/Xsession\n# See Xsession.options(5) for an explanation of the available options.\nallow-failsafe\nallow-user-resources\nallow-user-xsession\nuse-ssh-agent\nuse-session-dbus\n\n\nA: Alternate solution is use keychain.\nMan page.\n\nKeychain helps you to manage SSH and GPG keys in a convenient and secure manner. It acts as a frontend to ssh-agent and ssh-add, but allows you to easily have one long running ssh-agent process per system, rather than the norm of one ssh-agent per login session.\nThis dramatically reduces the number of times you need to enter your passphrase.\n\n\nA: If you are using ubuntu 18.04 or later, gnome keyring will launch ssh-agent and set the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable. You can always verify after reboot using the command pgrep -af ssh-agent to see if ssh-agent is running and if its launched by gnome keyring you should see the output like 214325 /usr/bin/ssh-agent -D -a /run/user/1000/keyring/.ssh\nIf NOT you can add the following to .bashrc before adding the keychain commands.\neval `/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=pkcs11,secrets,ssh,gpg`\nexport SSH_AUTH_SOCK\nexport GPG_AGENT_INFO\n\nTo take advantage of storing the secrets in the gnome keyring, all we need is to install Seahorse aka Passwords and Keys from the Ubuntu software store using which we can add SSH keys and its passphrases using GUI.\nAdd the below section to SSH config file at $HOME/.ssh/config if not already present.\nHost *  \n    AddKeysToAgent yes\n\n\nAfter adding the keys and its passphrases to the seahorse, install keychain and then add the following line to .bashrc.\nkey_files=('~/.ssh/id_rsa1' '~/.ssh/id_rsa2')\n# This will inherit the ssh-agent started by the gnome keyring and hence\n# we don't need to enter passphrases after every reboot.\n/usr/bin/keychain --agents ssh --inherit any --eval ${key_files[*]}\nsource \"$HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh\"\n\n", "Q: How to make nvidia command permanent I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 with an Nvidia GeForce GT620 video card.

The dash is simply too laggy when it comes to type something into it moreover it takes more than 3 secs to open so I can type something inside. It's FASTIDIOUS and quite disappointing. I've seen this issue in computers with much more power resources and that somewhat comply with the standard requirements. Come one I've seen this bug on pc's with 3gb of RAM and 2,6Ghz processors not to mention the advanced graphic cards. Can this bug be solved in the future or will it stick around with Ubuntu as long as it's installed on my pc? Please answer something.\n\nA: It's a bug with your hardware and graphics drivers rather than Ubuntu and Unity. The dash is faster than it was with Ubuntu 13.04 or prior releases. If you're using open source drivers, you'll want to immediately add the oibaf PPA to get better open source drivers for your graphics card. However, since oibaf currently does not support Saucy, you'll need to edit oibaf to use raring repos instead.\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers; sudo sed -i 's/saucy/raring/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/oibaf*; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade -y; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y\n\nThen reboot.\nIf you are using proprietary drivers you will need to uninstall them first. If you are using NVDIA you need to use the closed source drivers from NVIDIA instead with sudo apt-get install nvidia-current -y\n\nA: If you don't really care to have a fancy dash and you just want it to work, I would recommend getting lubuntu.  It is a lot less fancy and much faster.  Just put \nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop \ninto terminal.

And it more than likely would work for ubuntu.  you open the older repository in sources.list and pin the package desired and give it a higher Priority and it will pull those packages on the list that u need. documentation here , http://www.leonli.co.uk/blog/debian-7-0-wheezy-php-5-3-install-downgrade-from-php5-4/.\n\nA: I think best solution for now (and future too) is Vagrant. Vagrant can make lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments. All what you need is in Ubuntu software center. So installation is very easy.\nIn next step you need vagrant boxies with your dev environments. Go to https://puphpet.com/ and configure box what you need (ex. PHP 5.3) and download.

Of course, in the second case could be a maintainer that decided to prepare MariaDB for Ubuntu and submitted their source code.\nEither way, it requires \"someone\" to do the work. This is the case of the packages included in the so called \"multiverse\" and \"universe\" repositories.\nSo, the exact reason why MariaDB isn't included into Ubuntu \"main\" repository?\nThe most likely reason is because Debian is undergoing the process to add MariaDB into their main repository and Ubuntu maintainers don't want duplicated efforts.\nThe bug/wish to include MariaDB into Debian can be followed here. There is also a master plan about what the mariadb package should do, and what functions should include.\n", "Q: Install Everpad on Ubuntu 13.10 and 14.04 I just installed a fresh copy of Ubuntu 13.10 and wanted to install Everpad but there is some issue as the PPA for it is missing it.\nThese were the commands which I execute (took help from http://www.webupd8.org/2012/09/everpad-integrates-evernote-with-ubuntu.html and everywhere its the same):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nvbn-rm/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install everpad\n\nThe following which what I get when the last command is executed:\nReading package lists...

When I get e-mails in gmail I can choose reply-to address. Is there such a possibility in Evolution? I know that in the advanced settings, you can specify the return address for the account, but how to make sure that there was a list of multiple addresses and be able to choose just one? Or maybe there is a possibility that at once expose the return address for letters?\n\nA: If you're in the message editor, you might have noticed that your \"From\" address is a drop-down box, letting you select from which account you want to send the mail. That's where you can do so.\nIn case you need additional \"identities\" there, I haven't found a convenient way to simply \"configure a list\" – but you can setup \"dummy accounts\" with no \"inbound mail server\" (i.e. setting \"Server Type\" to \"None\" for incoming), just configuring their \"outgoing\" (SMTP) settings. They will appear in the drop-down as well then.\nAs you requested more detailed instructions, here a short step-by-step:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Evolution, open the menu Edit → Settings\n\n*EMail Accounts should already be selected. If not, do so.\n\n*On the right hand side, push the \"Add\" button This starts the assistant.\n\n*Hit \"Next\"\n\n*Enter the name, mail address 1, reply-to. Push \"Next\".\n\n*Next screen is for where to pull mail from. In the \"Server Type\" drop-down on the very top, select \"None\". This will empty the form, and you can push the \"Next\" button again.\n\n*On the next screen, enter the data for how mail using this \"alias\" should be sent. Use the SMTP settings for the account you chose for the \"from\" address (1).\n\n*Again, push the \"Next\" button and verify your settings.\n\n*If everything looks fine, one more \"Next\" creates the alias.\n\n\nNow it should be available in the mail editor's drop down.\n", "Q: How do I install Moodle?

Please use a different name.\n\nNow I can rename it to Test2.txt followed by renaming to test.txt\n\nA: You can use the rename command.\nIt's not actually a built-in shell command, like mv, but a pearl script that comes by default with most GNU/Linux distros. It's usage is a bit different from mv because it uses Pearl regular expressions to compare against a list of files.\nHere's how to use it in your case:\n\nrename 's/Test\\.txt/test\\.txt/' *\n\nThe s tells the rename command to search and replace all occurrences of Test.txt with test.txt. The dots . inside the regular expression must be escaped with a \\, that's why the filenames are written like Test\\.txt. Notice the * at the end of the command, that means to look through all files in the current directory.\nYou can pass the -n option to the rename command if you want to test it without making any changes.\n", "Q: How to connect to a network from terminal I recently updated to 13.10 from 13.04.

While live booting I used gparted to create a SWAP area of 1GB and formatted the remaining free space as EXT4. These two were /dev/sda4 and /dev/sda5 respectively. The EXT4 was flagged as the boot loader (grub) partition.\nThen, I installed Ubuntu on the EXT4 through the desktop icon while live-booting from CD with no problems. After the installing was finished, I rebooted the laptop, the CD popped out, and I got to the rEFIt boot loader screen. I selected the \"partition tool\" from the menu and rEFIt said it successfully synced my partitioning tables.\nI shut down the computer, turned it back on, got to the rEFIt screen again and now I had two options: Boot Mac OS and Boot Ubuntu from HD. \nWhenever I try to boot into Ubuntu, I get a white screen with the Linux penguin greyed out in the middle, and after a few seconds a black screen with the text \"Missing operating system...\"\nI suspect there is a problem with the partition tables, but I don't know how to fix it. If anyone can help I can include the report from the Partition Inspector tool that came with rEFIt.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: First, rEFIt has been abandoned. I've forked the project as rEFInd and added significant new capabilities, particularly for handling Linux installations. You might therefore want to try using rEFInd. You should be able to use a CD-R or USB flash drive image (although these sometimes don't work on some Macs) for testing.\nSecond, the procedure you followed creates a hybrid MBR, which is an ugly and dangerous hack that's not required to boot Linux on most Macs. You're usually better off installing Linux in EFI mode and using a conventional GPT disk. This will require using an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux (rEFInd in conjunction with a 3.3.0 or later kernel works well for this) rather than the BIOS-mode GRUB.\nThird, if you installed GRUB to the Linux partition, that means that there's no BIOS-mode boot loader in the disk's MBR. If you must do a BIOS-mode boot, you probably need a BIOS-mode boot loader in the MBR, so you'll need to install one. The Boot Repair tool should be able to put GRUB there, or you can do it manually from a live CD.\n", "Q: How to change the Ubuntu Touch calendar to Hijri?

I have a 80Gb HDD with one partition for Ubuntu and want to partition it into two partitions 60G/20G. \nHow can I do this?\n\nA: Note: Make sure that the drive is empty; otherwise make sure that you have a complete backup of its content, because creating a partition will erase all data on the drive.\nOpen Dash, and search for Gparted, and click on it.  If its not installed, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nOnce installed open the application, and enter your password.  Once it open, follow the step below:\nIf the drive is new, Click on Device, and choose Create Partition Table; otherwise skip to the step in the third image.\n\nKeep the Default, and click Apply\n\nRight click on the Unallocated space, and choose New\n\nCreate a 60GB partition.  Once you enter all the info, click Add\n\nThen Right click on the Unallocated space, and choose New\n\nCreate a 20GB partition.  Once you enter all the info, click Add\n\nClick on the Green check mark to Apply pending operations\n\nAnd just click Apply to start.\n\nOnce done, just click Close, and that's it.\n\n\nA: Use a Live-CD with Gparted to shrink the 80 GB partition to 60 GB and then create a 20 GB partition in the unallocated space that the shrinking procedure creates.\nInformation on the use of Gparted, plus a number of references to how-to sites and video tutorials, can be found at:  http://linuxnorth.wordpress.com/manual-partitioning/ \n\nA: You cannot partition your drive unless you unmount it(and you cannot unmount that partition which has the current OS installed on it).

My current system boots to console and I do not want to use a display manager.\nAfter updating to Ubuntu 13.10, I realised that the ConsoleKit is no longer used for managing user logins and systemd-logind service is used instead.\nMy .xinitrc config for Ubuntu 13.04 looked like this:\nexec ck-launch-session startxfce4\n\nThe ck-launch-session enabled me to mount disks or shutdown/reboot/suspend the PC.\nThe only place where I could find documentation for how to enable these features was in the documentation for Arch Linux:\n\nUsers should first set up systemd-logind to manage their session. If systemd is running as the system init daemon, then this is already happening.\nNext, the user must launch systemd by putting the following in their ~/.xinitrc: /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --user\nThe user should remove any instances of ck-launch-session or dbus-launch from their ~/.xinitrc, as those commands are unneeded.\n\nHowever, as Ubuntu uses upstart and not the systemd, I can't do that on my configuration.\nI tried doing something similar so I put this in my .xinitrc:\nexport DESKTOP_SESSION=xfce\ninit --user\n\nAnd the xfce session starts, but I'm still not able to mount the hard disks or reboot, shutdown and suspend my PC. It's effectively the same as calling startxfce4 directly.\nIf I start the X server with the vt01 argument, where 01 is the id of the current tty, everything works fine, but I can't use stuff like CTRL+C to terminate the server if something hangs. Yes, there are workarounds like calling killall xinit, but this doesn't solve the problem.\nI think that I'm not allowed to do shutdown If i start the X server in a new tty is because a new logind session is not cretated. After reading the logind documentation, I realize that I probably need to create a new session upon starting the X server and that session should be marked as active when I'm in the X server. This can be checked with the following command:\nloginctl show-session $XDG_SESSION_ID | grep Active\n\nThe following line in the logind documentation confuses me:\n\nCreateSession() and ReleaseSession() may be used to open or close login sessions. These calls should never be invoked directly by clients. Creating/closing sessions is exclusively the job of PAM and its pam_systemd module.\n\nSo my question is how can I make PAM create a new logind session upon starting the X server?\n\nA: I've spent all night looking at this for my Ubuntu console boot + Openbox setup and was in the same boat as you. systemd isn't used fully in Ubuntu 13.10 but it does replace ConsoleKit as you said.

Initially, I was not able to boot from my hard drive or from a Live DVD. However, I could boot from a live USB. Different distros behaved a little differently, but none would fully boot and no solutions others had posted worked for me. This was a Lenovo x201 laptop, after replacing Windows 7 with Ubuntu.\n\nA: Your Windows boot error sounds like you ran Boot Repair on the computer some time ago, then subsequently re-installed GRUB. Up to a couple of months ago, Boot Repair was aggressive in renaming Microsoft's boot loader (bootmgfw.efi) and replacing it with another copy of GRUB, which would create the problem you describe. If I'm right, re-running Boot Repair and using the Advanced option to restore backed-up files may fix that part of the problem. You'll need to boot from an emergency/live CD to do this, of course.\nYour Linux problem is more obscure. It may indicate a problem in the initial RAM disk (initrd) or on your installed system. Either is a very strange error, since this is very basic stuff that should not be causing problems. A problem here is most likely a symptom of some other problem, like a disk that's full or otherwise failing. Perhaps more clues would be present in the Boot Repair logs; when you run that program, it spits back a URL with logs. Post that URL here for us to see.\n\nA: ...same case. I installed from USB stick and that was the reason: while writing the image with Universal-USB-Installer to the stick (from Win 7) my Virus scanner blocked writing of a file named 'autorun'.

I am running xubuntu 13.10 on a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon. It works very well, except the behaviour of my clickpad (touchpad where the buttons are built into the surface) makes it essentially unusable.\nThe default behaviour means that the whole area of the clickpad moves the mouse cursor, so that when I try and click anything, the mouse will move around slightly and I will miss my target.\nAfter googling around, I saw suggestions suggesting that I should modify my /etc/X11/xorg.d/50-synaptics file (man) so that the AreaBottomEdge option is set to the height of the button area on my clickpad.\nThis worked in that it prevented the mouse from moving when I touch the clickable area, but it now does not allow me to move the mouse with another finger while holding the left click button down, so I cannot do selections/dragging/etc.\nWhat I am after is configuration settings (or a different driver) that will turn off mouse movement over the clickable area of the clickpad, but still allow me to move the mouse while another finger is resting on, or clicking down on the clickable area. Essentially I want to make the clickable areas act like real buttons.\nThank you.\n\nA: Try editing your /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf and adding this:\nOption \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"RBL RBR RBT RBB MBL MBR MBT MBB\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*RBL is Right Button Left, \n\n*RBR is Right Button Right, \n\n*RBT is Right Button Top, \n\n*RBB is Right Button Bottom, \n\n*MBL is Middle Button Left, \n\n*MBR is Middle Button Right, \n\n*MBT is Middle Button Top, \n\n*MBB is Middle Button Bottom.\n\n\nThis defines the area of the clickpad where the touching clicks do not move the cursor. Maybe this didn't work way back then.\nMy ELAN1300:00 clickpad has these numbers where the middle button is from 40% to 60% of the touchpad width:\nOption \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"1924 0 1600 0 1379 1923 1600 0\"\n\nThere can also be % values instead of touchpad coordinates:\nOption \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"1924 0 90% 0 1379 1923 90% 0\"\n\nThis says the bottom 10% of the touchpad is reserved for the Soft Buttons and a touch will not move the cursor when beginning in that area. The /var/log/Xorg.0.log should show the final numbers used by the Xserver after interpreting the config file.\n", "Q: How Can I Install Adobe Air on 12.04 64-bit?

My attempts to do so myself are failing. The system should be en_GB in UTF-8 mode. The output of locale -a includes en_GB.utf8. locale outputs the following:\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nLANG=en_GB.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en_GB:en\nLC_CTYPE=en_GB.utf8\nLC_NUMERIC=en\nLC_TIME=en\nLC_COLLATE=en_GB.utf8\nLC_MONETARY=en\nLC_MESSAGES=en_GB.utf8\nLC_PAPER=en\nLC_NAME=en\nLC_ADDRESS=en\nLC_TELEPHONE=en\nLC_MEASUREMENT=en\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=en\nLC_ALL=\n\nVarious programs throw locale-related errors, mostly non-fatal, for example:\n(process:2711): Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library.\nUsing the fallback 'C' locale.\n\nHowever, I'm also getting crashes at bootup from Keyboard Input Methods and when attempting to use the Language Support section of System Settings. At present, my /etc/default/locale file reads as follows, which was copied from the locale output on a working system (though I might have made one or two changes since then):\nLANG=en_GB.utf8\nLANGUAGE=\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nLC_NAME=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nLC_ALL=\n\nAt various points trying to fix this, I've managed to cause apt to throw 400 errors when trying to run apt-get update, and render the system entirely unbootable by causing mountall to crash.\nI've tried various solutions I've found by Googling the problem, including running locale-gen and dkpg-reconfigure locales, with no luck.\nWhat's going on and how can I fix it?\nEdit: So setting LC_ALL=en_GB.utf8 fixes the local issues, but it causes a pile of error messages when I try and SSH into other machines that don't have en_GB.utf8 available. This doesn't happen on my other Ubuntu boxes, so there must be a way of getting the local settings sorted without setting LC_ALL and causing these issues.\n\nA: Even if your /etc/default/locale looks correct, I recommend that you change it to just contain\nLANG=en_GB.UTF-8    \n\n(which in effect is the same thing).\nBut the problem seems to be that something in your user settings messes up the locale. I don't know anything about Chrubuntu, but assuming that you have access to the Ubuntu GUI for setting languages, I suggest that you go to System Settings -> Language Support and explicitly set both the language and the regional formats from there.\nIn any case, it's never ever a good idea to set LC_ALL via /etc/default/locale.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 - no USB devices after restart I have a fresh install of ubuntu 13.10.

My system is Ubuntu 12.04, running inside a virtual machine on Mac OS 10.5.8. To use the VM, I opened an NAT bridge and forwarded port 5037 for adb, I can see the Nexus with adb and e.g. use the adb shell into it. USB ports are also forwarded to the VM.\nI follow these instructions to the letter. My bootloader is unlocked, just as it was described in the instructions. Now I encounter different issues, when executing sudo phablet-flash ubuntu-system --no-backup.\nOn the first run, it got stuck in this state:\nINFO:phablet-flash:Decompressing partitions/recovery.img from /home/till/Downloads/phablet-flash/imageupdates/pool/device-5ba3031cb0d6fc624848266edba781e3e821b6e1e8dd21105725f0ab26077d0a.tar.xz\nINFO:phablet-flash:Restarting device... wait\nINFO:phablet-flash:Restarting device... wait complete\nINFO:phablet-flash:Booting /tmp/tmpMSN8bm/partitions/recovery.img\n< waiting for device >\ndownloading 'boot.img'...\nOKAY [  1.772s]\nbooting...\nOKAY [  0.005s]\nfinished. total time: 1.779s\nINFO:phablet-flash:Waiting for recovery image to boot\n\nThe following happened: around the line \"INFO:phablet-flash: Restarting...\", it rebooted into the bootloader. The bootloader shows only for two seconds, then the screen goes off and the phone stays off. But I do notice, that the screen is not off - it is just black, but the background light is on. If I wait long enough, phablet-flash aborts with ERROR:phablet-flash:Wait for recovery expired\nOn the second try, I wanted to manually start the bootloader and choose \"Recovery mode\". Pressing \"volume down+power\" at first did nothing. Releasing the buttons and then pressing them again brought me into the bootloder.

I noticed that adb does not show the phone in recovery mode: Typing adb devices, when the Nexus 4 is in recovery mode, shows the serial number and the state device, where it should show recovery. \nShould the phone be rooted? This is not mentioned in the instructions. \n\nA: OK, I found the issue. I will post the answer for reference for everyone, who tries the same: Installing Ubuntu Touch on a phone, when you use a virtual machine for the Ubuntu that you are using.\nThe primary issue: To be able to access the Nexus from inside the VM, I had to activate a \"device filter\" so that Ubuntu inside the VM can see the phone. The device filter has to be different for the phone, when it is in Recovery mode!\nIn detail:\nI first flashed the phone to Android 4.2.2. This way I was able to at least see the Recovery mode that comes with the Ubuntu Touch installation (NB: It seems that stock Android on the Nexus 4 does not ship with Recovery mode [citation needed]). The problem remained, that phablet-flash remained at INFO:phablet-flash:Waiting for recovery image to boot. \nAfter I installed the CWM Recovery image, I found out that adb cannot see the device in Recovery mode. Hence I checked the VirtualBox settings and added the Nexus 4 as a device filter again in the USB settings. It turned out that in Recovery mode, the product ID of the phone is different, hence it was not forwarded to the guest OS in the VM and phablet-flash could not continue, as soon as the phone was in R-mode. \nI hope this helps, if someone happens to try the same.\n", "Q: I want to return my computer to factory settings from Windows. ¿How do I uninstall Ubuntu to avoid any conflict?

So first,  I want to uninstall Ubuntu, (which in fact is a little untidy because it was the first time I installed it and I use it to experiment, for example I didn't install the Home folder in another partition), then restart the laptop with default factory settings to fix Windows, and then install Ubuntu again.\nSo, it is necessary to uninstall Ubuntu before I return my laptop to factory settings?\nIf it is necessary, how do I uninstall it properly?\nIs there any way to only reinstall Ubuntu without affecting Windows?\nThanks in advance...\n\nA: Did you install Ubuntu using Wubi.exe ? or did you use a bootable medium ? \n-- If it is by using wubi.exe; you can definitely uninstall Ubuntu and start over. If you installed it in another partition using bootable medium, you might want to \n(i) format that partition and reinstall it using a bootable medium (OR)\n(ii)In case you do not want to format the partition --> Insert the bootable medium containing the version of Ubuntu that you want to install and boot from it, and select \"Reinstall Ubuntu XX.XX\" after selecting \"Install Ubuntu\"(instead of \"Try Ubuntu\").\n\nA: No, you have not remove ubuntu. in windows recovery, system remove everthing include windows own patitation. after create everthing, patitations, filetables. like a fresh format. so you do not need remove ubuntu. it will automaticly. \n", "Q: no root file system defined error in ubuntu 13.10 installation I have installed ubuntu 13.10 along with windows 7 without creating any new partition. I am using a bootable pendrive to do so and the installation completes succesfully in the same drive in which windows is installed. But when the pc restarts to complete the installation this error shows up !! This same thing is successfully completed in another pc but in my pc it is showing an error. Pls help as i dont want to create a new partition and dont want to run it as a live cd.\n\nA: First of all, digest this fact -- ubuntu works on an ext4 partition while, on the otherhand, Windows runs on an NTFS partition. If you decide to run Ubuntu and Windows on same partition, you might want to consider using Wubi.exe(Windows Ubuntu Installer).\n[This installs Ubuntu and Windows on the same partition, but i would suggest you have two different partitions for the sake of performance. I believe that the system becomes slow in course of time due to fragmentation -- SUMMARY: use different partitions for Ubuntu and Windows].\nOtherwise, if you decide to remove Windows (ofcourse after backing up all the important data) and shift to Ubuntu, while installing Ubuntu, go for the option \"Other\", and go for creating a new partition table, then define the root for your file system, and then install ubuntu.\n", "Q: Struck with a serious issue when upgrading to ubuntu 13.10 from 13.04 I installed ubuntu 13.04 alongside windows xp professional.  When I tried to upgrade to 13.10 from 13.04, it took some time to download and then it started cleaning the files and then message was displayed that xp cleaned (this msg was seen by my younger brother and then he cut the power off) . Now the computer when starts displays this screen and I dont know how to proceed. To anyone giving solution I would like tell you that I prefer xp over linux(personal reasons). So is there any way to get out of this problem, I neither can open xp nor linux? \nSorry, I was tensed, please understand my situation, really sorry for that, here is what I meant : This is what I am getting when I start my PC\n\n\nA: If you upgraded from 13.04 to 13.10 using Software Updater (formerly Update Manager) then it's probable your brother misunderstood a message and stopped your upgrade. If you were using a Live CD/USB it's possible you select a fresh install on 13.10 and were over writing your XP partition.\nI recommend you use a Live CD/USB of Ubuntu and boot your system selecting the Try out Ubuntu option. Once you are in the trial session mount the partition on your hard drive to see if your XP and Ubuntu partitions are still there.\nIf XP is still there then you are in good shape and only need to repair your Master Boot Record (MBR). You'll want to read up about the MBR before touching it. Windows forums are probably better for that but the Linux SystemRescueCd has a tool to simply recover the MBR.\n", "Q: Ubuntu will not install with dual boot I have a Desktop with a 1 TB HD and Win 7 installed.  When I try to install Ubuntu as a dual boot system the only option it allows is to write over Win 7.  I've installed dual boot versions on other computers with no problems.\n\nA: Most probably you already have 4 primary partitions, which is the maximum. If you already have 4 primary partitions, Ubuntu cannot add another partition for itself. \nYou would have to rethink your partition table. For example, you could delete one partition and create an extended partition instead. Extended partitions are like wrappers which can contains many partitions.\n", "Q: What software can I use to download torrents I just installed Ubuntu 13.10, Saucy Salamander. I would like to install a different Linux distribution, but all of my download crash. I want to use a torrent instead. What software can I install to download torrents in Ubuntu? I used Utorrent in Windows 8 but I don't think they have that for Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can use the default torrent client that ships with Ubuntu which is Transmission. If you would like something that more familiar to utorrent you can use qBitTorrent. \nTo open Transmission you can simple search for it in the Dash. To get qBitTorrent you have to go to the Software Center and then search for it and install it:\n\nThis is what it looks like:\n\n\nA: Use Transmission a simple torrent downloader. It's installed by default. \n", "Q: Ubuntu thinks I have two displays When I first installed Ubuntu I noticed that my mouse would flicker a lot, which caused me to investigate. I remembered back when I ran Fedora I had an issue where it thought I had two displays (hp-dv7 4285dx laptop). In Fedora, this didn't cause any issues. In Ubuntu, it causes the mouse the flicker a lot. The fix I've been using is to just go into settings > displays and disable the display that doesn't actually exist. The only problem is that this is not permanent. Each time I start up Ubuntu, I have to go back in and disable this display. They're each just titled \"Built-in Display\", and have the same resolution.\nMy laptop does have two graphics cards: one on-board and one dedicated. I'm not sure if maybe that is causing is an issue? Any guidance towards this would be great.\nThanks!\n\nA: I have/had the same problem (Acer 3820TG laptop) with 2 video chipsets. Ubuntu 14.04.\nMain problems were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cursor flickers or disappears completely.\n\n*I would launch programs and the window was on the other screen (I thought it hadn't launched correctly, urrgh!) so I couldn't see it.\n\n\nAs a workaround I selected Mirror Displays in System Settings/Screen Display.(Both screens reported identical attributes so no resolution conflict expected)\nIt gave me a problem warning but has fixed these problems. SO far its working but I don't know why it detects two in-built displays. Like you, I suspect the 2 graphics cards to one monitor are confusing it.\n\nA: I still occasionally get this issue running Zorin OS 15.3 on a 2015 MacBook Pro, (Zorin is built on Ubuntu). Occasionally a few pixels at the top of the screen flicker and/or the OS thinks there's a second monitor connected.\nThis isn't a fix, but I simply opened the settings app and the issue went away. It may be a fluke, but I'm guessing something initialized or re-evaluated the active monitors when I opened the settings app.\n", "Q: Sudo not available in guest login When I login as guest I am unable to execute any command with sudo.\nE.g.:\nsudo ps\n\nreturns:\nsudo: unable to change to sudoers gid: Operation not permitted\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: It is every easy to do administrative tasks from  a guest session. The su is disabled, but they cannot disable ssh.\nAll you have to do is ssh into an account in the sudoers list on localhost:\nssh <username>@localhost\n\nwhere <username> is that of the account. \n\nA: I recommend against all the solutions here, again for security reasons. In the use-case outlined by the op in his response:\n\nA guest user is logged in and I/root come over and want to do something(say, copy a specific file from my profile to the guest's desktop) which requires root and sudo seems to be the most convenient way of doing that.\n\nThe most convenient way of doing this is to execute su [your username]. By default root has no password and you can't use that username, so use your regular admin account. You will then be prompted for your password. You can then execute what commands you wish, perhaps prepending them with sudo, typing your password again. When you are finished using your own account's permissions, type exit and they will be returned to their own prompt.\n\nA: Rather than trying to fix it, consider creating a second user with sudo privileges. Hopefully this is straighforward to do via the unity ui, since I only know how to do it by editing /etc/sudoers. That way, \"guest\" remains unpriviliged like it's supposed to be, and you can make the second user as secure or insecure as you like.\n\nA: This is designed as a security feature, really.  The \"guest\" user has a locked down set of permissions and are denied access to sudo, su, and other commands.\nIf you need to access those commands, you can login as your own user on the TTY, through Ctrl+Alt+F1 or any of the other F# keys up to 6, and login through that, however guest user is locked out of the administrative commands and such.\n\nA: The guest user in Ubuntu is a generated user every time you log in with guest. See:\nguest-5VczkW@host:~$ grep guest /etc/passwd\nguest-5VczkW:x:115:125:Guest,,,:/tmp/guest-5VczkW:/bin/bash\n\nThe name guest-5VczkW is changing with every guest session. The script that generates this user is the a script called guest-account:\nwhich guest-account\n/usr/sbin/guest-account\n\nNow you can edit this sciript by adding the guest user to a sudo group. So every new generated guest user is added to this group that has the right to gain root-privileges.\nBut, I can't recommend this intrusion into the system. It's a major security risk. In your situation I would just make a new normal user called \"guest\" with a password that everyone knows, and add this user to the sudo group. But notice, even with this solution everyone that known the guest login can change the system significantly.\n", "Q: Can't install Ubuntu Software Center I'm running Ubuntu 13.10 32bit with Gnome 3.8 but am missing the Ubuntu Software Center.

I cannot find this online anymore, but I suspect you can give a try to the Ubuntu Server installlation CD. You can install the Ubuntu desktop even from the Server installation - it is really the same distribution, just with different default package selections.\nUbuntu used to employ the Debian System installer, which offers all the RAID features. The server Installation CD probably still does something similar, though I am not up to date on that.\nAlso I would recommend to use one of your SSDs as /-Partition and mount the Bulk-Storage to /home or /srv, depending on your use. Symlinking /home and /srv together is also not unheard of. The reason is that the operating system can really profit from the speedup offered by the SSD, so it would be a waste to put it on the disks. Also if your SSD breaks you can always just reinstall the OS, the safety offerd by the RAID1 is much more important for your own data.\n", "Q: Trying to install ubuntu for nexus unable to locate package I am trying to install on my nexus 10 Ubuntu.

Should I alter my xorg.conf?\n\nA: Because OpenGL 4.x is not yet implemented in Mesa 9.2 as far as I know. I read an article (german) some days ago that 3.3 is planned for Mesa 10.0 and an OpenGL 4.0 implementation is also in the works.\nSee also this document: http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/tree/docs/GL3.txt\n", "Q: Suspend/resume issue hp envy m6 :) I just installed Ubuntu 13.10 on my HP envy m6.\nWhen I press the \"power\" button and select to suspend, it looks like it goes to sleep (power light flashing, as expected).\nWhen I press the power button to wake it (or anything else), it stops flashing and goes solid (as it should) but the screen is black.\nI tried CTRL+ALT+F1 but nothing seems to happen.\nIs there something I can do to get Ubuntu to resume from suspend?\nEDIT: I tried getting any updates for Ubuntu as well as updating my BIOS. Neither seems to have any effect.\nEDIT: Tried the 2nd script from Ubuntu 12.04 LTS suspend fix and it seemed to have no effect. Tried the 1st script and now I can't seem to suspend at all - Ubuntu seems to try to suspend and then immediately goes to the password prompt. With some combination of things I seem to be able to get a new crash, though, involving wpa_supplicant. I allowed it to submit feedback. My WiFi seems to be working fine (I assume this is what WPA is).\nEDIT: I know this is 'askubuntu', but I did try latest Linux Mint / Cinnamon. Results were exactly the same (black screen, power light solid after waking up - just as before, I can make it reboot by mashing CTRL+ALT+DEL but CTRL+ALT+F1/etc. doesn't work). Trying Ubuntu 12.04 next.\nEDIT: Ubuntu 12.04 WORKS! At least it seems to with a quick test. Came right back up after suspend. If I don't have any other problems and no answers are suggested, I'll make my own answer and accept it. Maybe someone can use this information to help troubleshoot the real issue. Would be nice to be on the latest version... but suspend would've been a deal-breaker for me. Hope this info helps someone.\nEDIT: Installed proprietary ATI driver (not the experimental/beta one) and the issue is back. I can CTRL+ALT+F1 to go to terminal and then sudo stop lightdm, sudo start lightdm which seems to bring me back. The fixes in the forum post didn't fix it either, one prevents machine from suspending the other just doesn't seem to have an affect.\nEDIT: Tried the fix here ati suspend issue but seem to get the same result.\nI noticed something new (which may have been there all along). Though screen is black, if I move the trackpad mouse as far right as possible, the mouse cursor appears at the left side of the screen. It can travel up/down, but not to the right. I can travel left \"off\" the screen, and seemingly pretty far.\n\nA: I wish I had an answer, but I can at least commiserate with you. I have an Envy 15 and am experiencing the same problem you are.\nI was previously running 13.04 and did not experience this problem, so it seems new to 13.10.  I've tried everything you've tried, with no success.

The problem originated when I was trying to fix this problem. Things went horribly, horribly wrong and I ended up with a new problem altogether. The last thing I did was run\nsudo apt-get install\nand that caused my system to freeze. I restarted my computer and it would not boot from the harddrive.

It returned this message:\nInvalid partition table on /dev/sda -- wrong signature 5208.\nThe drive appeared as a 2TiB unallocated drive with an error. The drive had 4 partitions before (plus random unallocated space). There was a fat32 partition, an ext4 partition which contained ubuntu 13.04/13.10 (I don't even know which one at this point), an extended partition which contained a swap partition for my ubuntu partition (I was meaning to move that ubuntu partition into the extended partition, never got around to it), and another partition (I don't remember how I formatted it).

First off, I was using a 4 gig thumbdrive to boot Ubuntu 12.10 to work with. I had limited space on the drive and could only install new utilities by uninstalling others (like Thunderbird). One utility I came accross was called fixparts. I don't believe that there is a ppa with fixparts in it, so I had to download the .deb and install it with Ubuntu software center. The online documentation/tutorial recommends using fdisk to first backup the MBR data so that if fixparts further corrupts it, it can be restored. I did so (assume the drive we want to fix is sda) with \nsudo fdisk -d /dev/sda > parts.txt\n\nand to restore the data\nsudo fdisk -f /dev/sda < parts.txt\n\nTo use fixparts you just need to provide it with the drive you want to work on\nsudo fixparts /dev/sda\n\nFrom there you can use the interface. It will first tell you the primary partitions it found. It will not list the Extended partitions. You can then issue commands on what you want to do. If you want a list of commands, just use ? See online documention in above links for more details. Fixparts didn't exactly fix things for me, but it got me started. I restored the original Partition Table using the before mentioned command with fdisk and then used fdisk to make my Linux partition bootable. Simply launching fdisk without arguments, or with the drive after it, will allow you to use an interface similar to fixparts. So I ran\nsudo fdisk /dev/sda\n\nand set the 2nd partition to bootable. When I booted, I was able to run Ubuntu 13.04 like normal and access all my partitions.\nIf someone understands the technical reasons for why this fixed things, please feel free to rewrite this mess of an answer and I will select it as best answer.\n", "Q: Using installed fonts in gnome-terminal Recently I have been messing with gnome-terminal to make it look more appealing.

Setting font permissions resolved my problem. For example:\nchmod 755 ~/.fonts/cure.se.ttf\n\nThen open new terminal instance.\n\nA: Updating your font cache might solve the issue.

However, I want to find out how I can access it from a Remote Desktop (I.e: Not on the Wireless Network at Home). \n\nA: When you ssh daemon is already running you can estimate by the following command on which interface sshd is listening (in my case):\n$ netstat -putan | grep sshd\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1690/sshd\n\nAs you can see my ssh daemon is listening on 0.0.0.0:22 that means on every network interface at port 22. This behavior is configured in the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config where you can set another address to listen on by the following statement:\nListenAddress 1.2.3.4\n\nWhere 1.2.3.4 is the address to listen on. In your case you can set 0.0.0.0 or the specific public ip-address of your PC.\nIf your computer is behind a firewall you need to forward the port (default: 22) to your computer. But I recommend to use another port than 22, because most bots out there are trying to brute force login via ssh over port 22 as you will see in /var/log/auth.log.\n", "Q: Difference between linux subdirectories I am building a computer and installing Linux of it. I am considering of getting:\nA small capacity SSD for frequently accessed files (such as the OS and programs),\nA small capacity hard drive for frequently written files (such as temp files),\nAnd a large capacity hard drive for backup, and various media (such as music and movies).\nSo how should I divide the subdirectories so that I can minimize wear on the SSD but keep my computer fast? Below are a couple of websites I visited, but I still need clarification. Thanks in advance, Sam.\nTable 3-2 of http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html\nhttp://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html\n\nA: Bulk data does normally go to /home and /srv, with the latter often beeing completely unused on desktop systems. Obviously these two directories should reside on your \"big\" storage, possibly symlinked to each other.\n/dev, /proc and /sys are not usually written to on the file system. Instead temporary file systems get mounted into these folders and consequently there is no need to put them anywhere else. Same goes for /mnt (rarely used today) and /media, on which empty mount point directories are created each time you put in a USB drive or similar medium. This is not likely to ever kill your SSD though.\n/bin, /sbin, /lib, /usr and /etc are all classical examples for things you would keep on the SSD, Those dorectories contain your program files and they are not normally written into unless you modify your software setup or make system wide configuration chages.\n/var is the only directory which is supposed to contain changing, persistent data during regular system operation, by your logic you would put this one on the small hard disk.\nTrickier is what to do with /tmp and /run. These two contain rapidly changing data, which is not needed across reboots. The system can profit a lot from the speedup provided by having those on the SSD, however they would also be the most weary storage areas.\nDirectories of this name are also available in /var, yet they are seperate because the equivalents in the / directory are considered more vital to the system function and traditionally they should be available even in situations where /var is unmountable for some reason. Actually it is rather safe to symlink them to /var/tmp and /var/run respectively.\nYou can also think about mounting them as ram disks, but beware that some applications might try to write a lot of data into these folders and lately I came across programs that rely on persisten directory structures in /run and /var/run or mechanisms that tend to act irritated when writing data to /tmp early in the boot process and finding themselfes unable to retrieve this data later after a ramfs has been mounted there.\nIn general I would not worry too much about straining a modern SSD. They are an order of magnitude more durable than a common USB stick and I am happily running /var, /run/ and /tmp on a SSD myself. The increase in operation speed is probably worth it.\n", "Q: My clock has disappeared So I have looked online (believe it or not) and I can't seem to find anything to help me with my issue.

I'm having trouble deploying the Havana Openstack charms on precise for cinder, nova-cloud-controller, and quantum-gateway. I'm using MaaS running Virsh managed KVM machines.\nI'm getting errors with the install hooks.\nI read that you can use juju debug-hooks to try to find the problem, but that you basically get given a terminal to the machine so you can do whatever the hook would have done by hand. I've seen a blog post that said you could run a command in the terminal to run the hook. I'd just like to get some more visibility on what is failing, so I am thinking that if I can run the hook in the terminal, I might see output that tells me what is happening.\nHow can I manually trigger a hook in a debug-hooks terminal? Or is there a better way to find what is causing a charm to fail to deploy?\n\nA: You can find the answer to this in our debugging hooks section of the docs.\nWhat you'll need to do is launch debug-hooks from the Juju client machine, then resolve the error with the --retry flag (or retry from the Juju Gui if you are using it). This will re-execute the hook and trap the event in the debug-hooks window. From there you will be in the right directory to run the hook file by typing hooks/<name-of-failed-hook> to get output. When you are done, simply press Ctrl D to exit the terminal and signal to Juju that the hook is finished executing.\n\nA: As all of your charms failed to install, I'd check out the contents of /var/log/juju on each of the failed service units; you can ssh to them using juju:\njuju ssh nova-cloud-controller/0\n\nLooking at the log contents should tell you what's up; as you are deploying OpenStack Havana from the Cloud Archive for Ubuntu 12.04, I would suspect that your servers can't access ubuntu-cloud.archive.canonical.com - either directly or via squid-deb-proxy if you are using that feature on your MAAS server.\n", "Q: \"GPT detected. Please create a BIOS-Boot partition\" while using boot-repair Since I updated Windows to 8.1 my Grub menu disappeared. I ran Ubuntu using Live USB, I used Boot-Repair but something went wrong. If I click on Reccomended repair I get this error:\n\nGPT detected. Please create a BIOS-Boot partition (>1MB, unformatted filesystem, bios_grub flag). This can be performed via tools such as Gparted. Then try again. Alternatively, you can retry after activating the [Separate /boot/efi partition:] option.\n\nSo I tried to set my sda9 (I think that it's the Ubuntu system partition, since it's ext4) with the bios_grub flag and then to run Boot-Repair again. It didn't work.\nI don't know what to do. My Grub was working fine (using UEFI) before I updated Windows.\nI removed the bios_grub flag. Then I used fsck and it didn't find any error. So I tried again with Boot-Repair but it always gives me the \"GPT detected\" error. My boot is on UEFI mode, Secure Boot is \"off\".\nWhen I boot my PC with SecureBoot OFF, I can reach the GRUB menu. But it's empty (the only voice is \"System Setup\").\nI mounted my Ubuntu system disk:\nsudo mount /dev/sda9 /mnt\n\nand the other things:\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\nI logged on the system with chroot:\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nI re-installed grub:\ngrub-install /dev/sda\nupdate-grub2\n\nBut it still doesn't work.\n\nA: You can handle this issue as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Gparted.\n\n*Identify the boot partition. Mine is the first 16.00MiB on my system disk.\n\n*Delete the partition (you will not want to delete the wrong partition and lost all the data on it! Stop if you don't know what you are doing!).\n\n*Create a new partition (do not format it to any filesystem), apply the settings.\n\n*Flags the new partition as bios_grub using Manage Flags option.\nNow, try boot-repair again.\n\nA: First, the bios_grub flag in parted or GParted is a way to identify a BIOS Boot Partition. GRUB 2 uses this partition to hold part of its boot code when the computer boots in BIOS mode. It's normally about 1MiB in size, although it can be smaller in some cases. Most importantly, if Boot Repair re-ran the GRUB installer after you set the bios_grub flag on your Linux root (/) partition, you may have trashed that partition. Thus, before you do anything else, I recommend you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the bios_grub flag from your Linux root (/) partition.\n\n*Test your Linux root (/) partition with fsck (or equivalent functionality in GParted or other GUI tools). If the partition has errors, fix them or restore your system from a backup. Only once you're sure that you can mount the partition and use it normally should you proceed.\n\n\nSecond, you had this problem because you booted your emergency disc in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode rather than in EFI mode. You need to learn how to control your computer's boot mode. You can usually do this via a boot manager that's accessed by hitting Esc or a function key early in the boot process (before GRUB appears); but there's no standardization on how to access this boot manager or what options it provides. Thus, you may need to experiment to figure this out.\nThird, if you can figure out how to boot your live CD in EFI mode, Boot Repair should fix the problem. Alternatively, you should be able to use a CD-R or USB flash drive version of my rEFInd boot manager to get Linux booted. Once Linux is up and running, you should be able to use efibootmgr to restore GRUB as the default boot loader, but the details depend on how it's configured now. Briefly, you must use the -o option to efibootmgr to set GRUB's entry as the first one. This question and answers cover the issue from a different angle. Instead of restoring GRUB, you could consider installing rEFInd to your hard disk, too.\n\nEDIT: Try using my rEFInd boot manager: Use the USB flash drive or CD-R image to create a suitable medium and boot from that. This should give you an option for Windows and at least one option for Linux. If you can boot both Windows and Linux, install the Debian package of rEFInd in Linux. This should switch the computer to use rEFInd by default, and you should be able to boot everything normally.\n", "Q: Drivers for Ubuntu 13.10 I just installed Ubuntu 13.10, my screen resolution is not fitting my screen as  the ubuntu interface is all around stretching over the screen, so i thought i might install nvidia's driver that i know can let me adjust the exact resolution i need. So i began a 2 hour quest, i downloaded the driver hoping i would have a wizard to instal it, but yeah, so i tried to do a bit of research and i found that feature, i think its called in english additional drivers, but it wont show the nvidia drivers, i tried the terminal, but once i write the commands i found it asks for a password but i cant type anything once the password is asked.\nSo, my question, obviously, how do i install this driver? I am not sure if this is appropriate, but why doesnt ubuntu have a wizard to install things? I feel like im working for the OS, when it should be the other way around, but i love the concept of linux, so im pushing forward and trying to use it. Another thing is, i had to install a bunch of drivers and applications for the drivers in windows, do i need to install any other driver? I cant change my mouse's sensibility in the os, it seems, so how do i do it? I'm sorry i'm asking all of this, but it seems necessary.\n\nA: First open a terminal using ctrl + alt + T. Then type in the command:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nAfter it's installed, reboot.\nMouse sensitivity can be adjusted by going to System Settings > Mouse & Touchpad and dragging the Pointer speed slider.\nYou can find the System Settings Application in the launcher at the left of the screen or by searching for it in the Dash (Press  to launch the dash.)\n", "Q: Should I use a separate 'admin' user as my \"root sudo\" or grant sudo to my 'app' user? I'm still wrapping my brain around the Ubuntu 'nullify root' user management philosophy (and Linux in general) and I'm wondering if I should 'replace' my root user with a user called 'admin' (which basically has all the powers of the root, when using sudo) and create another user called 'app' that will be the primary user for my app.\nHere's the context:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'll be running a LNMP stack on Ubuntu 12.04 Server LTS.\n\n*There will be only one app running on the server.\n\n*The 'app' user needs to have SUPER privileges for MySQL.\n\n*PHP will need to be able to exec() shell commands.\n\n*The 'app' user will need to be able to transfer files via SFTP.\n\n\nAnd I'm thinking this would be the best approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*nullify 'root' user\n\n*create a user called 'admin' that will be a full sudoer of root, this will be the new \"root\" user of NGINX, PHP, and MySQL (and all system software)\n\n*grant SUPER privileges to 'app' in MySQL\n\n*Grant SFTP privileges to only the 'app' user.\n\n\nAs I'm new to this, and the information I've found in researching it tends to be of a more general nature, I'm wondering if this is a solid approach, or if it's unorthodox in a way that would cause issues down the road.\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: Full sudo permissions should be reserved for actual human users. A user in whose context you plan to run network services primarily doesn't need those. You can also think about disabling the password and login shell for such a purely \"virtual\" user, by blanking the password field in /etc/shadow and settind the shell in /etc/passwd to /bin/false.\nCreating separate users for services, app users, as you call it, is a common technique.\n", "Q: Digital Ocean LAMP stack z-panel installation “cannot execute binary file” on Ubuntu 12.04 Having an issue installing z-panel on a Digital Ocean VPS running Ubuntu 12.04.

I have seen that the new DivX Player 10 shows off H.265/HEVC playback, the successor of H.264. I wonder how I may get this support in Linux. Is there a need to install a codec specific for this format? How?\n\nA: An alternative to @longsleep's great answer is, if using VLC: as noted here you can upgrade to VLC 2.2.x or higher to get HEVC/H.265 support. If on 14.04, you need to add this repo to get 2.2.x+ versions of VLC:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media\n\nsudo apt-get update, and \nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade or sudo apt-get install vlc vlc-plugin-libde265 \nYou can also install others if you want: vlc-plugin-*\nThe repo doesn't have the gstreamer1.0-libde265 package but does have a lot of other \"upgraded, advanced or not normally available multimedia packages for Trusty\" 14.04 for those who like LTS versions. \n\nA: There is also a PPA for libde265 GStreamer integration. With that installed one can playback H.265 with all GStreamer applications (Browsers, Totem, etc.).\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:strukturag/libde265\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow try playing back a .mkv containing HEVC/H.265 content using any GStreamer-aware player (e.g. \"totem\"). This should detect the missing codec and prompt to install the libde265 GS plugin (make sure to select the 64bit or 32bit version depending on your architecture).\nYou can also install the corresponding GStreamer plugin directly:\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-libde265\n\nOr for GStreamer 1.0 applications:\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-libde265\n\nThere is also a VLC plugin available:\nsudo apt-get install vlc-plugin-libde265\n\nDetails here: GStreamer plugin for 4K H.265/HEVC video streaming \n\nA: Yet another alternative - if you have Google Chrome installed - is to add/install H.265 / HEVC player (in)to your Chrome browser.\nAfter that, you can head straight to \"Google Chrome Applications\" (at your Ubuntu distro menu) and run the player. Or you can just start Google Chrome, type in the URL chrome://apps and hit Enter. This will cause Google Chrome to show you its installed apps, so you can run H.265 / HEVC player straight from there.\nBy using this alternative method, there's no need to install any library, codec, player plugin or whatever, because everything you need for H.265/HEVC playback support is already embedded in the H.265 / HEVC player.\nI've already used H.265 / HEVC player to watch a couple of two-hour-long H.265/HEVC encoded movies, and I didn't experience any playback issue.\n", "Q: Application Switcher next, previous, up, down shortcuts in 13.10 I'm missing these options in 13.10 ccsm:\n\nNow that I upgrated to 13.10, I can't find those options at all.

That's why those options were removed in ccsm\nNow the arrow shortcuts are hardcoded in unity code and cannot be customizable anymore. Unless you change the code recompile unity.

It's my main development machine, so quite important.  The disk size is 8Gb.\nRecently I started to get pop-up warnings about low disk space.  I cleaned up what I could and kept going.  The messages would stop for a while, then start again.\nThis morning my IDE (phpStorm) started complaining that it was out of disk space and could not save changes.  This seemed odd to me, since the alerts had just started again and were reporting that I had 200Mb left.  (In past days I have received alerts with less than 100Mb left, but have still operated OK).\nAnyhow, I did some quick research and decided that I needed to resize the VM disk and then run GParted.  In preparation for this, however, I stopped the machine to make a clone of it.  Now, neither the clone or the original machine will boot.  They just hang with a cursor flicking in the top left.\nI'm sure there are a number of ways to deal with this, but I'd like to get a handle on the options before I rush in.  Any ideas?\n\nA: Try pressing 'shift' or 'escape' immediately after starting the VM to show the GRUB menu. Then choose the 'recovery' option. From there you should be able to choose 'free up disk space' or 'root shell', and from the root shell you can resize the partition and filesystem.\nAlternatively, boot the VM from a recovery ISO image.\n", "Q: PCSX2 1.0.0 installation issues I've followed all the tutorials I can find to get this emulator to work and I'm now getting this error.

Kind of an ID10T Error but I did find the saucy to raring very helpful as I did not know about that being an issue. I had it trying to install a version I didn't have. The following allowed me to download it successfully:\nsudo sed -i 's/saucy/raring/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*pcsx2*\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install pcsx2-unstable\n\nHope this helps others! And thank you so much mmstick for the help!\n\nA: Currently, PCSX2 does not have any packages for saucy. However, you can use raring repos:\nsudo sed -i 's/saucy/raring/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*pcsx2*; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install pcsx2-unstable -y\n\nThen it should work, as the above replaces saucy with raring.\n", "Q: New installation not letting me boot to windows I have an HP Pavilion running Windows 7. Not wanting to make any changes to my 1TB hard drive, I installed Ubuntu 13.10 on a separate 40GB hard drive in the same computer. After installation, I can neither boot to the Windows drive or select the Windows drive from the GRUB menu. GRUB menu only shows options for Ubuntu. I have tried booting to the Windows drive from the bios, but it simply passes it right up like its not there and boots to the Ubuntu drive. The only way to boot to Windows is to disconnect the Ubuntu drive itself, but I don't want to open the tower every time I want to switch between them. Looking for some help. Can I get the Ubuntu drive to recognize the Windows drive maybe?\n\nA: Open a terminal and run sudo update-grub which should search all connected hard drives and find the Windows loader, thus adding it to grub. Normally this would have been discovered during the installation of Ubuntu by default, however.\n", "Q: How can i install ubuntu on my ntfs hdd without formatting? My hdd is just one partition in ntfs (500gb) and 430 gb is used by my photos/movies/music etc which I never will want to lose. Actually I installed Ubuntu on a usb flash drive (using it right now) but it is too slow that way. But my problem is : My computer is damaged ( maybe chipset or but not sure) and none of the windows versions (xp,vista,7) works on my pc. I get blue screen error as soon as windows startup logo shows. But Ubuntu just works flawless. That means I cannot use wubi. I wanted to shrink my hdd without losing data (which can be done in windows) but found nothing about that on Ubuntu forums. Is this possible? Or install Ubuntu on my ntfs filesystem?\nNote : I don't have chance to backup 400 gbs of data.\nSorry for my question if it's written a bit compex. I hope you get the point and someone has an idea ;)\n\nA: You cannot install Linux on NTFS as NTFS does not support UNIX user/group file permissions. You can try to use gparted on the Ubuntu CD to resize the partition, but you run the risk of losing data. I think you should buy a 1TB portable USB3 hard drive. They often sell for around $70-100 on Newegg/Amazon.\n", "Q: Trouble with web browsers Randomly one day I turn on my computer into Ubuntu and all of a sudden firefox (my browser of choice) keeps opening on its own, and if I let it will open 100+ instances of firefox so I had to uninstall it.\nSo then I try google chrome and it starts doing the same exact thing. So I uninstall that and try chromium and whadya know, same thing. Then I try opera and strangely enough, it works just fine.\nBut to my dismay I find opera to be a slow alternative, not very good and often unresponsive. So I really want to use firefox its my favourite browser. and this clearly seems to be a problem with the OS not the specific software. This problem makes my installation of Ubuntu virtually useless so if anyone has had this same problem or knows any sugestions it will be much appreciated thanks.\n\nA: Try these once hope it would help you\n\n\n*\n\n*First completely remove firefox with it's configuration file using following commands:\nsudo apt-get autoremove firefox\nsudo apt-get --purge remove firefox\n\n\n*Then remove the the ~/.mozilla directory by using this command:\nrm -r ~/.mozilla\n\nIt will remove the configuration file/history of firefox for the current user\n\n*Then re-install firefox using this:\nsudo apt-get -f install firefox\n\nIf it doesn't help then repeat the same procedure beginning from step 1, just replace the command in step 2 with this one:\nsudo find / | grep -i firefox | sudo xargs rm -rf\n\nReply if something goes wrong..\nAlternated Way\nRun this command in terminal:\nexo-preferred-applications\n\nThen under Web Browser chose some other browser as you told Opera is working fine, select that. Restart your system and check if it happens again..\n", "Q: Where is my new Gnome 3.10 software? After upgrading to Gnome 3.10 via the Gnome3 and Gnome3-staging I don't see the new software center, maps or any of the new software jazz that is suppose to come with Gnome 3.10. I see the window and top menu changes and It states I am running Gnome 3.10 in the system details app.\nSo where are my new apps that are supposed to be part of Gnome 3.10? as seen here\n\nA: I don't think packages for all the new apps that you have mentioned are available in the gnome ppas, so far I have seen only the following.\nWeather app - The package name is gnome-weather, and is available via the Gnome 3 staging ppa.\nGnome music is available via ricotz/testing.\nGnome maps is in the staging ppa.\n", "Q: 13.10 won't load any web pages After my upgrade to 13.10 (saucy salamander) fire fox won't load any pages, not even the startup page I continuously get a \"server not found\" error. What could it be? I've looked and no one else has asked about this problem\n\nA: Generally a \"server not found\" message means that there is no active internet connection. Check to see if this is the issue first.\nYou may have to unplug both your Modem and router (if applicable) for at least 30 seconds, then plug them back in.\n", "Q: SSH: Dynamic DNS vs Port Forwarding I recently set up SSH on my newly installed ubuntu, and already set up public key authentication and know that it works properly remotely on my local network. Now I decided that I would make it available to myself outside my LAN, so I'm wondering whether to use the router port-forward way or the no-ip/dynamic dns way.(if the server isn't already online automatically)\nWhich one is more preferred, from a security standpoint and in general? (Or is it already made available online from when I originally installed it?)\n-Thanks\n\nA: These are basically two different things, both of which you may want to use to some capacity. Port forwarding allows you to open up a port (in this case port 22) on your outside facing router to allow traffic to a certain computer on your subnet (the computer you want to SSH into). This essentially opens up your computer to the outside world so you can log into it from outside your local intranet. \nThe dynDNS portion is what would allow you to point a domain name (EX www.mycomputer.com) to the IP address that your ISP assigned to you. The reason this is so helpful is that most residential ISPs will use a non-static IP address (meaning that it changes every so often) and this would require you to keep track of the IP as it changes> dynDNS allows you to use the domain name and have it automagically resolve to whatever IP you have at the time. \nSo in short; you will most likely want to use both in order to SSH into your machine from outside your local intranet.\nAs far as security is concerned you should be ok on a properly patched/configured system. Of course there is always the potential for attack when you open a computer to the internet but it is regularly done without much problem.\nThe only thing you are likely to see is scripts attempting to break your password but that is why you use public keys to authenticate ;)\n", "Q: How do i make a COMPLETE BOOTABLE iso of my system? Exactly as the title posts. I want to make a completely bootable iso of my system incase something breaks. Not just the files but the whole system!\n\nA: Look at CloneZilla (http://clonezilla.org/) to make an image of your hard drive. You can then dump that image onto another HDD and boot it just like it was the original.\nNOTE: The second drive has to be at least as big as the original drive.\n", "Q: xubuntu 13.10 xfce4-power-manager not working I found that if xfce4-power-manager does not work if it is started with /usr/bin/xfce4-power-manager, the process is there but no power icon would be shown, the Power Manager in Settings does not work either. \nHowever if I start xfce4-power-manager with command xfce4-power-manager --no-daemon option, everything works normally.
